[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much atten- tion in the recent past [1,2] due to its potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC) [35]."

[2] "The structure of Cr species in the catalysts is further inves- tigated by XAS which provides information not only on the oxida- tion and coordination state (XANES) of the Cr species but also on the degree of clustering (EXAFS) [36]."

[3] "XRD patterns of the catalysts are compared in Fig. 3. Catalysts 5CrSBA-15 and 10CrSBA-15 show XRD reflections at 2θ of 24.6,"
"33.2, 36.2, 41.6, 50.3, 54.9, 63.5, 65.15, 73.05and 76.87 which are characteristic for crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase [36,47,48]."

[4] "In general,conversion of C3H8 increased with Cr content from 0.5 to 5 wt%. In particular, 0.5CrSBA-15, which contains exclusively isolated Cr species in Td coordination as evidenced by the Raman spectrum (Fig. 5a), shows reasonable C3H8 conversion and it gradually decreases with time, indicating the involvement of the isolated Cr species in DHP."

[5] "In contrast, it was concluded that coordinatively unsaturated clustered Cr(III) and/or Cr(II) sites play an important role in the activation of alkanes while crys- talline α-Cr2O3 are rather inert [9,10,12]."

• "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past [1,2] due to its potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC) [35]."

• "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad * of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene [6,7]."

• "Typically, the CrOxAl2O3 catalyst system is used for industrial processes, for example in the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) that runs at cyclic operation (reaction and regeneration) at 850 K [8]."

• "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively. Thus, the de-activated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing dehydrogenation activity, selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability, which makes the process not only complex but also expensive."

• "As evidenced from various studies, the distribution of Cr species is strongly dependent on the nature of the support, Cr content and method of activation [2330]."

• "It is known that DHP activity increases with Cr loading and a typical industrial Cr catalyst contains 13 wt% Cr at which level heterogeneous distribution of Cr species is virtually unavoidable [2330]."

• "In the present work, a series of Cr catalysts with varying Cr content (0.510 wt%) was prepared aiming to create a well defined Cr site distribution in the catalysts and thereby to derive the catalytic function of each specific Cr species."

• "To this end, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 supports were employed. On high surface area mesoporous SBA-15, it was expected that highly dispersed and completely accessible isolated Cr species can be created."

• "The structure and catalytic properties of these Cr species are compared with those supported on γ-Al2O3, which is typically used in industrial DHP processes and is also known to contain well defined Cr site distribution depending on the Cr content [26,27,30]."

• "In situ XANES studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state."

• "Remarkably, among xCrSBA-15, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr)."

• "In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."

• "For instance, studies on Cr ZrO2 catalysts with a Cr content of 0.05 to 0.8 wt% showed that mononuclear Cr(III) species are the active sites [31]."

• "In a different study, La doped CrAl2O3 and CrZrO2 catalysts monitored during DHP simultaneously by in situEPR andUV/vis coupled with online GC showed that in both the catalysts the oxidation state of Cr is not higher than (III) however, coordination state of Cr species was not discussed [11]."

• "On the other hand, a study on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) with CO2 over Cr/H- ZSM-5 concludes that a redox cycle between Cr+6 and Cr+3 is important for a high dehydrogenation rate [22]."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with advancements focusing on structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Industrial applications have included cracking and dehydrogenation processes, with research emphasizing the optimization of catalyst properties for enhanced efficiency and selectivity.

2. The nature of chromium oxide species varies based on the support material. At a 1 wt% Cr loading, SBA-15 predominantly contains isolated chromium(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination, whereas γ-Al2O3 supports a mix of isolated sites alongside oligomers, including dimers.

3. Upon interaction with propane, chromium(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination are quickly reduced to chromium(III) and their coordination number increases, indicating the immediate involvement of these species in the dehydrogenation process.

4. The catalytic activity of chromium species, whether isolated or oligomeric, is influenced by the support material. The study reveals that isolated chromium(III) species with coordination numbers greater than four exhibit superior activity, selectivity, and stability compared to chromium sites on the surface of crystalline chromium(III) oxide particles on SBA-15.

5. In contrast, oligomeric chromium species are found to be more active and selective than isolated chromium species on Al2O3. However, oligomers are less stable against regeneration processes compared to isolated species, affecting their performance in repeated reactions.
