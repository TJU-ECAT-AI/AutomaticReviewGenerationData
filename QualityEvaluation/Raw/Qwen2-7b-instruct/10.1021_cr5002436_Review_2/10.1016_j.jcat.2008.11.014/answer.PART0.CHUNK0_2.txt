[1] "As evidenced from various studies, the distribution of Cr species is strongly dependent on the nature of the support, Cr content and method of activation [2330]."
[2] "At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains merely isolated Cr(VI) species in Td coordination whereas γ -Al2O3 contains, besides isolated sites, a fraction of oligomers (including dimers)."
[3] "In situ XANES studies evidence that isolated Cr(VI) species in Td coordination are immediately reduced to Cr(III) and their coordination number increased (>4) upon interaction with C3H8."
[4] "The intrinsic catalytic activity of Cr species (isolated or oligomers) depends on the support (SBA-15 or Al2O3) where they have been stabilized as evidenced by the catalytic results."
[5] "In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) species with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast,oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than iso- lated Cr species stabilized on xCrAl2O3 for DHP."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with advancements focusing on structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Industrial applications have included cracking and dehydrogenation processes, with research emphasizing the optimization of catalyst properties for enhanced efficiency and selectivity.

2. The nature of chromium oxide species varies based on the support material. At a 1 wt% Cr loading, SBA-15 predominantly contains isolated chromium(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination, whereas γ-Al2O3 supports a mix of isolated sites alongside oligomers, including dimers.

3. Upon interaction with propane, chromium(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination are quickly reduced to chromium(III) and their coordination number increases, indicating the immediate involvement of these species in the dehydrogenation process.

4. The catalytic activity of chromium species, whether isolated or oligomeric, is influenced by the support material. The study reveals that isolated chromium(III) species with coordination numbers greater than four exhibit superior activity, selectivity, and stability compared to chromium sites on the surface of crystalline chromium(III) oxide particles on SBA-15.

5. In contrast, oligomeric chromium species are found to be more active and selective than isolated chromium species on Al2O3. However, oligomers are less stable against regeneration processes compared to isolated species, affecting their performance in repeated reactions.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著发展，研究重点集中在结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂以及反应机制。工业应用包括裂解和脱氢过程，研究着重于优化催化剂性能以提高效率和选择性。

2. 根据负载量的不同，铬氧化物物种的性质会有所变化。在1 wt%的铬加载下，SBA-15主要包含四面体配合的孤立铬(VI)物种，而γ-Al2O3则同时包含孤立位点和寡聚体，包括二聚体。

3. 与丙烷相互作用时，四面体配合的铬(VI)物种迅速还原为铬(III)，其配位数增加，表明这些物种立即参与脱氢过程。

4. 铬物种（孤立或寡聚）的催化活性受支撑材料的影响。研究表明，SBA-15上配位数大于四的孤立铬(III)物种在活性、选择性和稳定性方面优于表面的铬(III)氧化物颗粒上的铬位点。

5. 相比之下，寡聚铬物种在Al2O3上的活性和选择性高于孤立铬物种。然而，寡聚体在再生过程中相对于孤立物种更为敏感，影响它们在重复反应中的表现。
