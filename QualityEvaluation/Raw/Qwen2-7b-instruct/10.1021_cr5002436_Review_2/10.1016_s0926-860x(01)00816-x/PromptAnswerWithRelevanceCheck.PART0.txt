1. Since the discovery of chromium oxide-based catalysts in 1933, they have been widely used in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of butenes during World War II. They have also been adapted for newer applications, such as the production of propylene and isobutylene, with advancements in technology including the introduction of platinum and modified platinum catalysts. Companies like Shell, Gulf, and Dow have also utilized similar dehydrogenation technologies.

2. The Catofin process, developed by Houdry, operates on a cyclic principle akin to the Catadiene process, which was originally developed for the production of butadiene. It was commercialized for the production of isobutylene and propylene, with multiple units operational worldwide.

3. The equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of paraffins increases significantly with an increase in carbon number. This means that as the carbon chain gets longer, the reaction becomes more thermodynamically favorable.

4. It is crucial for dehydrogenation processes to maintain high selectivity and yield of olefins over prolonged operation without interruptions. 

5. The main role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to facilitate the main reaction while managing other unwanted reactions. Platinum modifiers play a key role in weakening the interaction between platinum and olefins without affecting the interaction with paraffins.

6. Alumina is chosen as a support material for catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and capability to maintain high dispersion of platinum, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

7. The choice of reactor design is critical for the success of catalytic processes, influencing parameters such as heat transfer efficiency and the ability to handle reaction conditions effectively.

8. Over 1 million metric tons of propylene and 2 million metric tons of isobutylene are produced annually through the use of dehydrogenation processes.

9. At 680 degrees Celsius, a strontium ferric chloride catalyst provided a high conversion of 90% and selectivity of 70% for ethylene production.

10. By incorporating tin into the catalyst and hydrogen into the feed, the selectivity to ethylene could be enhanced to over 85% at an ethane conversion of 67%, showcasing the adaptability of catalysts for optimized performance.

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have been utilized in dehydrogenation processes for the production of butenes from butanes. These butenes were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to create high-octane aviation fuel. More recently, these catalysts have also been used in conjunction with platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include optimizing catalyst structures, identifying active sites, selecting support materials, modifying with promoters, and understanding reaction mechanisms. The catalysts are typically contained in a fixed shallow bed within a reactor, which might be spherical, cylindrical, or horizontal, balancing gas flow distribution and minimizing pressure drop.

2. As carbon number increases, the equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation notably rises. This implies that the efficiency of the process escalates with the size of the hydrocarbon chains.

3. Producing light olefins through the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires maintaining reasonable conversion levels and high olefin selectivity.

4. The primary function of dehydrogenation catalysts is to expedite the main reaction while managing other reactions.

5. Alumina is chosen as the support material due to its exceptional thermal stability and mechanical strength under various conditions.

6. Selectivity declines as conversion increases, as n-mono-olefins are consecutively converted into by-products.

7. Heat is generated through the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn), supplemented by direct fuel combustion and heat released in the chromium redox cycle.

8. The selectivity-conversion relationship can be modeled using Eq. (5) if rate functions, relative rate constants, and equilibrium constants are known.

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved in dehydrogenation processes by being used in fixed shallow beds within spherical, squat vertical cylindrical, or horizontal cylindrical reactors. They've been applied extensively for the production of butadiene and isobutylene, with modifications to handle propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene conversions. In the late 1980s, their application expanded further to include dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutyrene. As of 2000, there were eight Catofin units in operation for isobutylene production, each capable of producing around 2.8 million metric tons annually. Alternative processes in the former Soviet Union were also developed in the late 1950s. The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation rises significantly with increasing carbon numbers. To maintain high yields over long periods, the process must avoid shutdowns. Multi-stage adiabatic reactors with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) are used in the Oleflex process. Modified catalysts simplify the reaction pathways for both light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation. In paraffin dehydrogenation, the conversion rate is described by equations involving rate constants and equilibrium constants. Selectivity decreases with increased conversion due to consecutive conversion of n-mono-olefins into by-products. The choice of reactor design is crucial for process success. Ethane oxydehydrogenation at 300-400°C uses vanadium-containing reducible metal oxide catalysts, while at 500°C, phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts or iron-containing solid solution catalysts are used. At 650-800°C, a variety of materials without common molybdenum and vanadium elements are employed. Catalysts tested by Phillips include those with lithium, titanium, and manganese, or cobalt, phosphorous, and specific promoters. High-temperature ethane oxydehydrogenation over Pt-PtSn coated monolith catalysts was researched by Schmidt and colleagues at the University of Minnesota.

Key industrial applications and research focus areas include understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms to minimize side reactions, coke formation, and maximize efficiency. The catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed inside a reactor with designs that balance gas flow distribution and pressure drop. Coke formation during the dehydrogenation step necessitates parallel reactors for dehydrogenation while others are being purged or regenerated. The Houdry Catadiene process was extensively used for butadiene production, while newer catalysts like those by UOP enable stable activity over several years without regeneration. The equilibrium conversion increases with temperature, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation also rise. Continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, particularly with noble metal catalysts, enables high-yield olefin production over long periods without shutdowns.

Companies like Phillips Petroleum and Houdry further advanced the technology, particularly by using dehydrogenation at less than atmospheric pressure for higher conversions. Houdry also commercialized the chromia-alumina dehydrogenation system for butadiene production. The Catadiene and Catofin processes extended the use of these catalysts to propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.
