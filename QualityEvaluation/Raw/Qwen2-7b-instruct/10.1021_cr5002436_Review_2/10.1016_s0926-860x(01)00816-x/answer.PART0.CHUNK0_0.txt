1. Since the discovery of chromium oxide-based catalysts in 1933, they have been widely used in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of butenes during World War II. They have also been adapted for newer applications, such as the production of propylene and isobutylene, with advancements in technology including the introduction of platinum and modified platinum catalysts. Companies like Shell, Gulf, and Dow have also utilized similar dehydrogenation technologies.

2. The Catofin process, developed by Houdry, operates on a cyclic principle akin to the Catadiene process, which was originally developed for the production of butadiene. It was commercialized for the production of isobutylene and propylene, with multiple units operational worldwide.

3. The equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of paraffins increases significantly with an increase in carbon number. This means that as the carbon chain gets longer, the reaction becomes more thermodynamically favorable.

4. It is crucial for dehydrogenation processes to maintain high selectivity and yield of olefins over prolonged operation without interruptions. 

5. The main role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to facilitate the main reaction while managing other unwanted reactions. Platinum modifiers play a key role in weakening the interaction between platinum and olefins without affecting the interaction with paraffins.

6. Alumina is chosen as a support material for catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and capability to maintain high dispersion of platinum, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

7. The choice of reactor design is critical for the success of catalytic processes, influencing parameters such as heat transfer efficiency and the ability to handle reaction conditions effectively.

8. Over 1 million metric tons of propylene and 2 million metric tons of isobutylene are produced annually through the use of dehydrogenation processes.

9. At 680 degrees Celsius, a strontium ferric chloride catalyst provided a high conversion of 90% and selectivity of 70% for ethylene production.

10. By incorporating tin into the catalyst and hydrogen into the feed, the selectivity to ethylene could be enhanced to over 85% at an ethane conversion of 67%, showcasing the adaptability of catalysts for optimized performance.

1. 自1933年铬氧化物催化剂被发现以来，它们在脱氢过程中得到了广泛应用，尤其是在二战期间用于生产丁烯。随着技术的进步，铂或改性铂催化剂也逐渐引入到该领域。壳牌、海湾和杜邦等公司也采用了类似的脱氢技术。

2. 哈德里开发的Catofin工艺在原理上类似于先前的Catadiene工艺，最初用于生产丁二烯，并随后商业化用于生产异丁烯和丙烯。目前全球有多家Catofin装置在运行。

3. 随着碳链长度的增加，脱氢反应的平衡常数显著增加。这意味着碳链越长，反应就越有利于热力学。

4. 脱氢过程需要维持高选择性和高产率的烯烃，且在长时间内无需停机。

5. 脱氢催化剂的主要作用是加速主要反应同时控制其他反应。铂修饰剂在保持铂与烯烃相互作用的同时，减弱铂与烷烃的相互作用，起到关键作用。

6. 硅酸铝因其出色的热稳定性和机械强度以及能够维持铂高分散度而成为催化剂支撑材料的选择，这对实现高脱氢活性和选择性至关重要。
