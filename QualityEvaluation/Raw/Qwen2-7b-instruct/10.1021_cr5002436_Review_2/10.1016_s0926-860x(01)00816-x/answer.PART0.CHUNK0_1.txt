1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have been utilized in dehydrogenation processes for the production of butenes from butanes. These butenes were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to create high-octane aviation fuel. More recently, these catalysts have also been used in conjunction with platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include optimizing catalyst structures, identifying active sites, selecting support materials, modifying with promoters, and understanding reaction mechanisms. The catalysts are typically contained in a fixed shallow bed within a reactor, which might be spherical, cylindrical, or horizontal, balancing gas flow distribution and minimizing pressure drop.

2. As carbon number increases, the equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation notably rises. This implies that the efficiency of the process escalates with the size of the hydrocarbon chains.

3. Producing light olefins through the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires maintaining reasonable conversion levels and high olefin selectivity.

4. The primary function of dehydrogenation catalysts is to expedite the main reaction while managing other reactions.

5. Alumina is chosen as the support material due to its exceptional thermal stability and mechanical strength under various conditions.

6. Selectivity declines as conversion increases, as n-mono-olefins are consecutively converted into by-products.

7. Heat is generated through the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn), supplemented by direct fuel combustion and heat released in the chromium redox cycle.

8. The selectivity-conversion relationship can be modeled using Eq. (5) if rate functions, relative rate constants, and equilibrium constants are known.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂在从丁烷中生产丁烯的过程中得到了应用，并将其二聚化为辛烯，然后氢化为辛烷以制备高辛烷值航空燃料。近年来，这些催化剂也与铂或改性铂催化剂结合使用。工业应用和研究重点包括优化催化剂结构、识别活性位点、选择支撑材料、促进剂修饰以及理解反应机制。催化剂通常包含在球形、垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形反应器中的固定浅床中，平衡气体流动分布并最小化压降。

2. 随着碳数增加，烷烃脱氢的平衡常数显著提高。这意味着随着碳链尺寸的增加，过程效率会提高。

3. 通过催化脱氢轻烷烃制备轻烯烃需要维持合理的单次转化率和高烯烃选择性。

4. 脱氢催化剂的主要作用是加速主反应同时控制其他反应。

5. 由于其在各种条件下的出色热稳定性和机械强度，氧化铝被选作支撑材料。

6. 随着转化率的增加，选择性下降，因为n-单烯烃连续转化为副产品。

7. 再生（碳烧）过程中存储的催化剂床热能提供部分热量，补充直接燃料燃烧产生的热量和铬的氧化还原循环释放的热量。

8. 如果知道速率函数、相对速率常数和平衡常数，则可以通过等式（5）来建模选择性-转化率关系。
