[1] "During World War II, catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[3] "The Houdry Catadiene process was used extensively for the production of butadiene, either by itself (n-butane to butadiene) or in conjunction with catalytic oxydehydrogenation of n-butene to butadiene."
[4] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutyrene."
[5] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobutylene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."
[6] "In 1959, an alternative chromia-alumina catalytic dehydrogenation process was developed in the former Soviet Union."
[7] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases."
[8] "Very importantly, it must be able to produce olefins in high yields over long periods of time without shutdowns."
[9] "The Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR."
[10] "Over modified catalysts, the major reaction pathways for both light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation systems are simpler (Fig. 7)."
[11] "In paraffin dehydrogenation, the rate of paraffin conversion (x) and mono-olefin production (sx) are given by Eqs. (1) and (2) respectively:dx dt = f1(ki, Kipj) (1) d(sx) dt = f2(ki, Ki, pj) (2)"
[12] "Selectivity decreases as the conversion increases because n-mono-olefins are consecutively converted into by-products."
[13] "The choice of reactor design plays a very important role in the success of catalytic processes."
[14] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 300400 C is conducted with reducible metal oxide catalysts usually containing vanadium."
[15] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 500 C may be conducted with phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts or iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with one or more metal oxides."
[16] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 650800 C is conducted with a variety of materials, most not containing the elements molybdenum and vanadium, which are common in lower-temperature catalysts."
[17] "Workers at Phillips Petroleum Company have examined catalysts comprising lithium, titanium, and manganese, and catalysts comprising cobalt, phosphorous, and at least one promoter selected from a list of elements."
[18] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation over Pt and Pt-Sn coated monolith catalysts at high temperatures and extremely short contact times has been the subject of work by Schmidt and coworkers at the University of Minnesota for the past several years."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved in dehydrogenation processes by being used in fixed shallow beds within spherical, squat vertical cylindrical, or horizontal cylindrical reactors. They've been applied extensively for the production of butadiene and isobutylene, with modifications to handle propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene conversions. In the late 1980s, their application expanded further to include dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutyrene. As of 2000, there were eight Catofin units in operation for isobutylene production, each capable of producing around 2.8 million metric tons annually. Alternative processes in the former Soviet Union were also developed in the late 1950s. The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation rises significantly with increasing carbon numbers. To maintain high yields over long periods, the process must avoid shutdowns. Multi-stage adiabatic reactors with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) are used in the Oleflex process. Modified catalysts simplify the reaction pathways for both light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation. In paraffin dehydrogenation, the conversion rate is described by equations involving rate constants and equilibrium constants. Selectivity decreases with increased conversion due to consecutive conversion of n-mono-olefins into by-products. The choice of reactor design is crucial for process success. Ethane oxydehydrogenation at 300-400°C uses vanadium-containing reducible metal oxide catalysts, while at 500°C, phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts or iron-containing solid solution catalysts are used. At 650-800°C, a variety of materials without common molybdenum and vanadium elements are employed. Catalysts tested by Phillips include those with lithium, titanium, and manganese, or cobalt, phosphorous, and specific promoters. High-temperature ethane oxydehydrogenation over Pt-PtSn coated monolith catalysts was researched by Schmidt and colleagues at the University of Minnesota.
