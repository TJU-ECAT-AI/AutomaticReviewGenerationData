[1] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."
[2] "Important aspects in dehydro- genation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."
[3] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[4] "The actual design reflects a compromise between gas flow distribution across a large cross-sectional area and the need to maintain a low pressure drop."
[5] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallelsome for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerating."
[6] "The Houdry Catadiene process was used extensively for the production of butadiene, either by itself (n-butane to butadiene) or in conjunction with catalytic oxydehydrogenation of n-butene to butadiene."
[7] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
[8] "In a somewhat abbreviated form for the production of mono-olefins, this can be expressed as follows:x2 e = Kp Kp + P"
[9] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[10] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[11] "Very importantly, it must be able to produce olefins in high yields over long periods of time without shutdowns."
[12] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved to include platinum or modified platinum catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms to minimize side reactions, coke formation, and maximize efficiency. The catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed inside a reactor with designs that balance gas flow distribution and pressure drop. Coke formation during the dehydrogenation step necessitates parallel reactors for dehydrogenation while others are being purged or regenerated. The Houdry Catadiene process was extensively used for butadiene production, while newer catalysts like those by UOP enable stable activity over several years without regeneration. The equilibrium conversion increases with temperature, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation also rise. Continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, particularly with noble metal catalysts, enables high-yield olefin production over long periods without shutdowns. The STAR technology, developed by Phillips Petroleum, also plays a role in isobutane dehydrogenation, showcasing advancements in catalyst design and application.

1. 自1933年的发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂已经发展到包含铂或改性铂催化剂在脱氢过程中。工业应用和研究重点领域包括理解结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制，以最小化副反应、焦炭形成并最大化效率。催化剂包含在固定浅床内位于反应器中，设计平衡气体流动分布和压力降。焦炭形成期间的脱氢步骤需要并行反应器进行脱氢，同时其他反应器被净化或再生。胡德里猫迪恩过程广泛用于丁二烯生产，而UOP的新催化剂使稳定活动持续几年而不需再生。随着温度的增加，均衡转化率也会上升，但副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活也会增加。连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，特别是使用贵金属催化剂，允许长时间无停机高产率烯烃生产。菲力普斯石油公司开发的STAR技术也在异丁烷脱氢方面发挥作用，展示了催化剂设计和应用的进步。
