<p>Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and was also independently developed by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) in the United States, together with ICI in England. The first UOP-designed plant came on stream in Billingham, England, in 1940 and was soon followed by two other units in Heysham, England, in 1941.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this butane dehydrogenation was to produce butenes, which were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel.</p>
<p>Other companies soon followed these pioneering efforts. For example, Phillips Petroleum built a multi-tubular dehydrogenation reactor near Borger, TX, in 1943.</p>
<p>However, the most significant development was made by Houdry using dehydrogenation at less than atmospheric pressure for higher per-pass conversions. This process, which came on stream toward the end of World War II, was also used for the production of butenes.</p>
<p>After the war, Houdry further developed and commercialized the chromia-alumina dehydrogenation system and extended it to the production of butadiene in what became known as the Catadiene process.</p>
<p>In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder. The actual design reflects a compromise between gas flow distribution across a large cross-sectional area and the need to maintain a low pressure drop.</p>
<p>A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallel - some for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated.</p>
<p>The Houdry Catadiene process was used extensively for the production of butadiene, either by itself (n-butane to butadiene) or in conjunction with catalytic oxydehydrogenation of n-butene to butadiene.</p>
<p>Large quantities of butadiene have become available over the past 30 years, mostly as a by-product from the thermal cracking of naphtha and other heavy hydrocarbons. This market shift has resulted in the shutdown of all on-purpose catalytic dehydrogenation units for butadiene production in North America, western Europe, and the far East.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutene. The new process application called Catofin operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process.</p>
<p>Steam is used as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants and, thus, to achieve reasonable conversion levels of about 30-40% for propane and 45-55% for butanes. Steam also helps slow down the deposition of carbon (coke) on the catalyst, thereby, extending cycle time from minutes to hours.</p>

Historically, chromium oxide-based catalysts were first developed and commercialized for butane dehydrogenation to produce butenes, which were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes for high-octane aviation fuel. This process was pioneered in Germany, the US (UOP), and England (ICI). Companies like Phillips Petroleum and Houdry further advanced the technology, particularly by using dehydrogenation at less than atmospheric pressure for higher conversions. Houdry also commercialized the chromia-alumina dehydrogenation system for butadiene production. The Catadiene and Catofin processes extended the use of these catalysts to propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Steam was used as a diluent to improve conversion rates and reduce coke deposition, extending cycle times from minutes to hours.

历史上，铬氧化物催化剂首先用于将丁烷脱氢生成丁烯，然后二聚为辛烯并氢化为辛烷以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。这项技术最初在德国、美国（UOP）和英国（ICI）得到开发和商业化。Phillips石油公司和Houdry等公司进一步改进了技术，特别是通过使用低于大气压的脱氢方法来提高转化率。Houdry还商业化了铬氧化铝脱氢系统用于丁二烯生产。Catadiene和Catofin过程扩展了这些催化剂对丙烷和异丁烷脱氢的应用。蒸汽作为稀释剂用于提高转化率并减少积碳沉积，从而将循环时间从几分钟延长到数小时。
