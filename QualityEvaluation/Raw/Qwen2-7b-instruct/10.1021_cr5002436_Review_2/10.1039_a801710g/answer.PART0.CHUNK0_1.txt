The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant. Initially, they were pivotal in industrial processes, particularly in the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and light paraffin dehydrogenation, utilizing chromium-on-silica and chromium-on-alumina systems. Research focuses on understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms that enhance their efficiency. For instance, the dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts demonstrates the role of Cr6 reduction, leading to the formation of CO/CO2 cracking products. The activity is closely tied to the formation of Cr3 species, indicating their significance in the catalytic process. It is acknowledged that while Cr2 species might contribute, Cr3 appears more active, suggesting advancements in catalyst design and optimization based on these findings.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展取得了显著进步。最初，它们在工业过程中至关重要，特别是在高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）生产和轻质石蜡脱氢中，使用了硅胶上的铬和铝酸盐上的铬系统。研究重点在于理解结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制，以提高其效率。例如，在500°C下对支持的铬氧化物催化剂进行的丁烷脱氢研究表明，Cr6的还原导致CO/CO2裂解产物的形成。活动性与Cr3物种的形成成正比，表明它们在催化过程中的重要性。承认Cr2物种可能有所贡献，但Cr3似乎更活跃，这表明基于这些发现的催化剂设计和优化方面的进展。
