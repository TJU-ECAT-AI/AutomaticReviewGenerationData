1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, becoming indispensable in the chemical industry for producing essential commodity chemicals. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include understanding their structure, identifying active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. These catalysts are notably used in processes such as HDPE polymerization and light paraffin dehydrogenation.

2. Research has highlighted the importance of supported chromium oxide catalysts in chemical industries, particularly in processes like the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and catalytic conversion of light paraffins to isobutane, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and propylene. Their industrial significance has driven extensive studies aiming to uncover the molecular structure of chromium oxides and correlate it with catalytic performance.

3. Despite advancements, previous characterization studies were often conducted under controlled conditions, which limited the direct applicability of the data to real-world catalytic scenarios. In situ spectroscopic methods, complemented by online activity and selectivity measurements, are now essential for a comprehensive understanding of supported metal oxide catalysts' actions.

4. In this study, researchers investigated the role of chromium oxide catalysts in n-butane dehydrogenation reactions using in situ UVVIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. They aimed to establish the significance of different chromium states (Crn) in alkane dehydrogenation and relate their findings to recent publications on active dehydrogenation sites.

5. The dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts showed a positive correlation with the chromium content and support composition. The maximum conversion was achieved after 515 minutes of operation, and the catalysts exhibited high selectivity for but-1-ene and but-2-ene, with a selectivity of around 90%.

6. The deactivation mechanism of the catalysts was attributed to the formation of coke on the catalyst surface, leading to loss of activity. However, the study also suggested that Cr3 species might be more active than Cr2 species, contributing to the enhanced dehydrogenation efficiency observed in the catalysts.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的演变，成为化学工业生产重要商品化学品的关键。关键的工业应用和研究焦点领域包括理解其结构、识别活性位点、选择合适的支撑材料、引入促进剂以及阐明反应机制。这些催化剂在高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）聚合和轻烷基脱氢化等过程中特别有用。

2. 研究强调了支持型铬氧化物催化剂在化学工业中的重要性，特别是它们在生产高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和催化转化轻烷基为异丁烷、甲基叔丁基醚（MTBE）和丙烯等过程中的应用。由于其工业重要性，已经进行了大量研究，旨在揭示铬氧化物的分子结构并将其与催化性能相关联。

3. 尽管取得了进展，但先前的表征研究往往是在受控条件下进行的，这限制了数据对实际催化情况的直接适用性。原位光谱方法，结合实时活动性和选择性测量，现在对于全面理解支持金属氧化物催化剂的行动至关重要。

4. 在这项研究中，研究人员使用原位UVVIS漫反射光谱法研究了铬氧化物催化剂在n-丁烷脱氢反应中的作用，并探讨了不同铬状态（Crn）在烷烃脱氢作用中的意义及其与最近关于活性脱氢位点的研究成果之间的关系。

5. 支持型铬氧化物催化剂的脱氢活性与铬含量和支撑组分成正比。在515分钟后达到最大转换率，催化剂显示出对丁-1-烯和丁-2-烯的高选择性，选择性约为90%。

6. 催化剂失活机制归因于催化剂表面形成焦炭，导致活性丧失。然而，研究表明，Cr3物种可能比Cr2物种更活跃，这解释了催化剂中观察到的增强的脱氢效率。
