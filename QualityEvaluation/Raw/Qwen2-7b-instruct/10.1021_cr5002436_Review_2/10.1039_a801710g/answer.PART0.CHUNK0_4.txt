[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in chemical industries for the production of important commodity chemicals. Indeed, several large volume industrial processes rely on supported chromium oxides as a heterogeneous catalyst."
[2] "Chromium-on-silica is the famous Philips polymerization catalyst, responsible for about one third of the world production of high density polyethylene (HDPE)."
[3] "Similarly,chromium-on-alumina is used as a light paraffin dehydroge- nation catalyst employed in the Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE processes."
[4] "In this work, we have investigated supported chromium oxide catalysts in n-butane dehydrogenation reactions by using in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopy. This allows us to probe Cr6, Cr3 and Cr2 in reaction condi- tions, while the reaction products (CO/CO2 , CH4 , C2H6 ,) can be monitored by on-line gas chromatography."
[5] "The dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increased with increasing Cr content, and content of the support, and a maximal conversion was reached after 515 min on-stream. The selectivity towards but-1-ene and but-2-ene was ca. 90%, and deactivation of the catalysts was due to coke formation."
[6] "The initial reduction of Cr6 after exposing the catalyst to n-butane was responsible for the formation of and CO/CO2 cracking products and (C1, C2 C3)."
[7] "The dehydrogenation activity was proportional to the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction. Although the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2 species cannot be ruled out,it seems that Cr3 was more active than Cr2."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant, particularly in the context of industrial applications and research focus areas. These catalysts are crucial for the production of commodity chemicals such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and paraffin derivatives. Key industrial applications include the catalytic production of HDPE using chromium-on-silica and the dehydrogenation of light paraffins using chromium-on-alumina catalysts. Research focuses on understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts. In the context of n-butane dehydrogenation, the study highlights that the activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increases with the chromium content and the support material, reaching a peak conversion rate after 515 minutes. The selectivity towards but-1-ene and but-2-ene is around 90%, and catalyst deactivation is attributed to coke formation. The initial reduction of chromium(6) species leads to the formation of cracking products and oxygen-containing compounds. The activity of the catalyst is proportional to the amount of chromium(3) formed upon reduction, indicating that chromium(3) species are more active than chromium(2) species in the dehydrogenation process.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的演变具有重要意义，特别是在工业应用和研究焦点领域。这些催化剂对于生产商品化学品至关重要，如高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和轻质烷烃衍生物。主要的工业应用包括使用铬-硅催化剂生产HDPE和使用铬-铝催化剂进行轻质烷烃脱氢。研究重点在于理解这些催化剂的结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制。在丁烷脱氢的背景下，研究表明，支持的铬氧化物催化剂的活性随着铬含量和支撑材料的增加而提高，峰值转化率出现在515分钟后。但-1-烯和但-2-烯的选择性约为90%，催化剂失活归因于焦炭形成。催化剂活性与还原后形成的铬（3）量成正比，表明铬（3）物种比铬（2）物种在脱氢过程中更为活跃。
