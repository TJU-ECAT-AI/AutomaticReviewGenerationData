1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in their industrial applications and research focus areas. They are now crucial for producing important commodity chemicals, such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and paraffin derivatives, through processes like polymerization and dehydrogenation. Research focuses on understanding the structure of chromium oxides, identifying active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, optimizing promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.

2. The significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to enhance industrial processes efficiently and economically. For instance, chromium-on-silica catalysts play a vital role in HDPE production, accounting for about one-third of global HDPE output. Similarly, chromium-on-alumina catalysts are used in the production of isobutane, MTBE, and propylene, contributing to significant portions of their respective markets.

3. Recent advancements in the field involve developing spectroscopic techniques that allow measurements under conditions closely resembling real catalytic environments. This has facilitated a deeper understanding of how chromium oxides function within these processes.

4. The dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts improves with the addition of chromium content and support material. The optimal conversion rate is achieved after approximately 515 minutes of operation. 

5. The initial reduction of chromium hexavalent (Cr6) species upon exposure to the reactants leads to the formation of chromium trivalent (Cr3) and chromium divalent (Cr2) species, which are associated with enhanced catalytic activity. While the activity of Cr2 species cannot be definitively excluded, Cr3 appears to be more active than Cr2 based on observed trends in catalytic performance.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在工业应用和研究重点领域经历了显著发展。它们现在对于生产重要商品化学品至关重要，如高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和烷烃衍生物，通过聚合和脱氢等过程。研究集中在理解铬氧化物的结构、活性位点、选择合适的支撑材料、优化促进剂以及阐明反应机制。

2. 这些催化剂的重要性在于它们能够高效经济地增强工业流程。例如，基于硅酸盐的铬催化剂在HDPE生产中起着关键作用，约占全球HDPE产量的三分之一。同样，基于铝酸盐的催化剂用于生产异丁烷、甲基叔丁基醚（MTBE）和丙烯，对这些产品的市场贡献巨大。

3. 最近的研究进展涉及开发允许在接近真实催化条件进行测量的光谱技术。这使得更深入地了解铬氧化物在这些过程中如何工作成为可能。

4. 支持的铬氧化物催化剂的脱氢活性随着铬含量和支撑材料含量的增加而提高。最大转化率在大约515分钟后实现。

5. 铬六价（Cr6）物种在暴露于反应物时的初始还原导致形成铬三价（Cr3）和铬二价（Cr2）物种，与增强的催化活性相关联。虽然不能排除Cr2物种的活性，但根据观察到的趋势，Cr3似乎比Cr2更为活跃。
