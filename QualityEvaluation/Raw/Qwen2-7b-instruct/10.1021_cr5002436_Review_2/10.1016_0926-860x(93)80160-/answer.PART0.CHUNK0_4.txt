<p>Zirconium dioxide has recently been the focus of some attention as catalyst support.</p>
<p>The catalyst surface was conditioned mainly by the reaction atmosphere, so that sample reduction with carbon monoxide at 623 K before catalysis did not influence the activity above 773 K.</p>

The document discusses the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts, focusing on their industrial applications and research areas. Key aspects include:

1. Chromium oxide catalysts are well documented for their superior performance, typically supported on aluminas.
2. Zirconium dioxide has gained attention as a catalyst support.
3. Catalyst activity is primarily conditioned by the reaction atmosphere rather than pretreatment methods.
4. The active sites consist of mononuclear chromium (III) species with two coordinative unsaturations, possibly including adjacent oxygen ions from the support.
5. The catalysts exhibit similarities to those used in propane dehydrogenation, suggesting the same active site is responsible for both reactions.
6. The dehydrogenation of isobutane on these catalysts is efficient and selective, with high conversion to isobutene and minimal formation of byproducts.
7. The document includes details on catalyst preparation, such as the use of zirconia and alumina supports, and the preparation of chromium oxide catalysts through equilibrium adsorption.
8. The dehydrogenation rate correlates positively with chromium concentration, with a linear relationship across different temperatures.
9. The catalysts show improved stability and activity when treated with oxygen at 773 K.
10. The deactivation mechanism involves coke formation, which affects the rate of dehydrogenation.

This document contributes to the understanding of chromium oxide catalysts, particularly in the context of dehydrogenation processes, highlighting their structure, active sites, and optimization strategies.
