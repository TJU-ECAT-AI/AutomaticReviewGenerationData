[1] "A subject of considerable practical interest is the conversion, by catalytic dehydrogenation, of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes."
[2] "In a recent paper [13], we reported a study of the dehydrogenation of pro- pane on CrOx/Zr02 catalysts and showedthatthe system is active and selective to propene at 723-823 K."
[3] "The main results of this study werethe following: (i) the surface composition and with it the catalytic properties are conditioned chiefly by the reaction atmosphere, irrespective of catalyst pretreatment,"
[4] "Moreover, the average turnover frequency (propene molecules produced per second per total chromium atom) was found to be substantially higher for the CrOX/Zr02 system in comparison with CrOx/A1203 or CrOx/Si02."

1. The conversion of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes through catalytic dehydrogenation is a topic of significant practical interest.

2. The dehydrogenation of propane on CrOx/Zr02 catalysts has been shown to be active and selective towards propene at temperatures ranging from 723 to 823 K.

3. The surface composition and catalytic properties of the CrOx/Zr02 catalysts are primarily influenced by the reaction atmosphere, rather than the catalyst's pretreatment.

4. The average turnover frequency of the CrOx/Zr02 system is notably higher in comparison to CrOx/A1203 or CrOx/Si02.

5. Recent research has focused on the dehydrogenation of isobutane using the same type of chromia/zirconia catalysts.

6. The synthesis of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) through the reaction with methanol has provided additional motivation for studying isobutane dehydrogenation.

7. The pretreatment process aims to remove carbonaceous species from the surface, restoring the initial chromium oxidation state.

8. There is a clear relationship between the increase in chromium content and an increase in the reaction rate.

9. The support's activity matches well with the experimental measurements for the ZC catalysts.

10. Potassium ions are primarily externally adsorbed onto oxygen ions, preventing their participation in the catalytic process.
