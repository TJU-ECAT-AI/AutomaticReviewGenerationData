<p>The superior performances of chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented.</p>
<p>As regards oxide systems, the superior performances of chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented.</p>
<p>In a recent paper [13], we reported a study of the dehydrogenation of propane on CrOx/Zr02 catalysts and showed that the system is active and selective to propene at 723-823 K.</p>
<p>The main results of this study were:</p>
<p>(i) the surface composition and with it the catalytic properties are conditioned chiefly by the reaction atmosphere, irrespective of catalyst pretreatment,</p>
<p>(ii) oxygen treatment at 773 K completely restores the activity of a deactivated catalyst,</p>
<p>(iii) the active sites are mononuclear CrIllspecies, and</p>
<p>(iv) adjacent surface 0 2- ions of the support are also probably involved in the active centre.</p>
<p>We have more recently turned our attention to the dehydrogenation of isobutane on the same type of chromia/zirconia catalysts and our findings are included in the present paper.</p>
<p>The aim of the treatment was to clean the surface of carbonaceous species left from previous experiments and restore the initial chromium oxidation state.</p>
<p>At this low chromium concentration, all chromium atoms are dispersed on the surface of zirconia and accessible to the reactant, as demonstrated by a FT-IR study of adsorbed nitric oxide [11] (dinytrosyls are by far the most abundant species) and a nitric oxide adsorption study (yielding NO/ Cr ratio :::::: 2) [10].</p>
<p>To the same end, we selected CrOx/Si02 and CrOx/y-AI20s samples with chromium concentration in the same region (well below the monolayer value) for a comparison with ZC.</p>
<p>The results of the experiments designed to measure the amount of coke produced after various times-on-stream, can be utilized to examine the effect of coke on the rate of the main reaction (dehydrogenation).</p>
<p>This point is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the decrease of the dehydrogenation rate relative to the initial one, (r0 - r) / r0', is reported vs. the amount of coke per unit catalyst surface (carbon atoms nm:").</p>
<p>Moreover, previous studies from this and other laboratories [13,18,19] have pointed out that coke is produced mainly by further dehydrogenation of the alkene or else by the dehydrogenation of an unsaturated adsorbed precursor of the alkene.</p>
<p>Fig. 2 shows that when the number of the coke carbon atoms equals the number of chromium atoms on the surface of the sample ZCO.29 (ca. 1.9 atoms nm- 2) the activity amounts to roughly 90% of the initial one.</p>
<p>Therefore, although coke formation probably starts at the dehydrogenation sites, the deposit grows and settles in such a way as to involve the surrounding areas of the support as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, it can be noted that there is still some activity when the amount of coke corresponds to 20 carbon atoms nm:", i.e, ten times the number of surface chromium atoms and almost three times the number of total surface cations (7.2 atoms nm- 2 [6]).</p>
<p>Consequently, a value of roughly 3 apparent in Fig. 1b for the (conversion to propene) / (conversion to methane) ratio actually indicates that the number of molecules of the two hydrocarbons is similar.</p>
<p>This result suggests that the main reaction responsible for the formation of gaseous by-products is the cracking of the isobutane molecule.</p>
<p>A contribution of a surface initiated homogeneous reaction cannot be ruled out, but blank experiments have shown that homogeneous cracking never exceeds one tenth of that observed for the catalyst ZCO.29 (Fig. 1b).</p>
<p>The extent of the cracking reactions is very small with our catalysts, even at 823 K (see Fig. 1b), so that a few sites of sufficiently high strength would probably suffice.</p>
<p>A mechanism involving the protonation of the alkane and the formation of a non-classical pentacoordinated carbonium ion, which then decomposes into a methane molecule and a carbenium ion, was proposed to explain the cracking of alkanes on acidic materials, such as H-ZSM-5 [20,21] and H-Y zeolites [22].</p>
<p>Zirconia-based catalysts possess considerably lower Brönsted acidity.</p>
<p>However, Nakano et al. [23] used infrared spectroscopy to show that hydroxyl groups exist on Zr02 capable of giving a pyridinium ion from adsorbed pyridine above 473 K, therefore acting as Brönsted acid sites.</p>
<p>Moreover, the extent of the cracking reactions is very small with our catalysts, even at 823 K (see Fig. 1b), so that a few sites of sufficiently high strength would probably suffice.</p>
<p>Influence of the pretreatment and reproducibility of activity Fig. 3 shows the results of several experiments on a single portion (0.5 g) of differently pretreated ZCO.29 catalyst.</p>
<p>At 773 K or below, sample prereduction with carbon monoxide leads to a higher initial activity, which declines with time-on-stream.</p>
<p>At 723 K or 673 K, the activity increases with time-on-stream, reaches a maximum and then decreases (for a reaction temperature of 773 K) or continues to increase (for reaction temperatures of 723 K and 673 K).</p>
<p>It is also noted (see Fig. 3, lower part) that, at high time-on-stream values, pretreatment memory is lost, and the dehydrogenation rates of both s.o. and carbon monoxide prereduced catalyst tend to converge at all given temperatures.</p>
<p>Concerning the regenerability of the catalyst ZCO.29, Fig. 3 (upper part) shows that activity at 823 K (both initial value and trend with time-on-stream) after 9 reaction-regeneration cycles (0) and 22 reaction-regeneration cycles (X) is almost identical.</p>
<p>Other relevant features are the extent of reduction attainable with carbon monoxide at 623 K (3.00.1 electrons per chromium atom measured from the 13th to the 17th cycle, a value conforming to that measured for many fresh s.o. ZC specimens [5-13] and the BET surface area (17.6 and 17.4 m2g- 1 for the fresh catalyst after s.o. and 28 cycles, respectively).</p>
<p>Isobutane concentration The dependence of the dehydrogenation rate on isobutane concentration in the reactant stream for the catalyst ZCO.29 is illustrated in Fig. 4.</p>
<p>From the two compositions, 5 molar% isobutane (open symbols) and 20 molar% isobu- tane (solid symbols), we can estimate the reaction order with respect to the reactant in this composition range.</p>
<p>If we neglect the rate of the reverse reaction, the reaction order for isobutane is: n=log(r(20)/r(5)/log(20/5), where r(20) and r(5) stand for rates when the reactant mixture contains 20% and 5% isobutane, respectively.</p>
<p>Based on ro values, the calculation gives the same value (n= 1.0) for the whole explored range 673-823 K.</p>
<p>Hydrogen addition Fig. 5 shows the influence of hydrogen addition to the reactant mixture for experiments carried out with ZCO.29 at 823 K and 773 K.</p>
<p>The presence of hydrogen leads to a slowing down of the deactivation, accompanied by a decrease of the initial dehydrogenation rate.</p>
<p>Specifically, the lines represent the best fittings (least squares method) of the ro(s) values of ZC catalysts (open symbols).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) the reaction rate increases with chromium content,</li>
<li>(ii) a linear increase satisfactorily represents the experimental data,</li>
<li>(iii) at any temperature, the extrapolation to abscissa=0 shows a positive intercept, which represents a contribution not related to the chromium component.</li>
</ul>
<p>This underlines the need to examine the activity of the support; moreover, since zirconia activity depends on the extent of surface hydration [13], it was essential to measure the dehydrogenation rate of zirconia in the same experimental conditions as those of the ZC samples.</p>
<p>The results for the support are shown in Fig. 6 as solid symbols at abscissa = O. It can be seen that the intercepts of the lines drawn for ZC catalysts satisfactorily match the experimentally measured activity of the support.</p>
<p>For the calculation, it is further assumed that the contribution of the support to the activity of the ZCcatalysts does not substantially change with the chromium surface concentration.</p>
<p>Specifically, the contribution of the support is assumed equivalent to the intercept value at the various temperatures.</p>
<p>Indeed, at maximum chromium concentration (ca. 1.9 atom nm:"), the fraction of zirconia surface covered by chromium is 1.9/7.2=0.26 (7.2 represents the number of surface cations per nm" on zirconia [6]).</p>
<p>Consequently, the fraction of bare zirconia surface contributing to the activity of the ZC samples varies from about 1 (most dilute ZC samples) to 0.74.</p>
<p>As a first approximation, changes in this contribution may be considered negligible.</p>
<p>Given the above assumptions, the conclusion can be drawn that Nodoes not substantially vary with the chromium surface concentration at a given temperature, and its value corresponds to the slope of the line.</p>
<p>Specifically, Novalues of 2.8, 9.4, 19 and 28'10- 3 molecules i-C4Hs S-l atc/ may be calculated for the reaction temperatures 673 K, 723 K, 773 K and 823 K, respectively.</p>
<p>The independence of the turnover frequency of the chromium concentration was also deduced for the dehydrogenation of propane [13,14].</p>
<p>In these previous studies, specific experiments of selective oxidation of CrI to CrIll with water enabled us to assess the active oxidation state of chromium (CrIll).</p>
<p>The results of the present investigation suggest that the chromium active species operating for isobutane dehydrogenation is identical with that of propane dehydrogenation, namely a mononuclear Crll site with two coordinative vacancies.</p>
<p>ZCK catalysts Industrial dehydrogenation chromia/alumina catalysts are known to contain small quantities (up to a few percent) of alkali ions, very often potassium.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is generally accepted that potassium has a beneficial effect, related to the poisoning of acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions (cracking and coking), which lower the selectivity and shorten the lifetime of the catalyst.</p>
<p>To verify whether potassium exerts a similar positive influence to chromia/zirconia catalysts, we examined some ZCK samples.</p>
<p>As a preliminary measure, we analyzed the effect of the potassium addition to the pure support.</p>
<p>Unlike Na + , potassium is not incorporated upon a heat treatment at 773K and tends to remain well dispersed on the Zr02 surface.</p>
<p>In the present work, we examined a sample containing 0.36 wt.-% K (ZKO.36), which should conform to these previous findings.</p>
<p>Concerning the catalytic properties, we found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) the dehydrogenation rate for ZKO.36 is roughly one order of magnitude lower than that for Zr02,</li>
<li>(ii) the deactivation and cracking rates for the two samples are similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to examine the influence of potassium on the catalytic properties of chromia/zirconia catalysts, we investigated two samples with different potassium content (namely ZCKO.26; 0.36i and ZCKO.37; 0.06).</p>
<p>Fig. 7 illustrates the main results, together with the corresponding ones for the sample ZCO.29, for the purpose of comparison.</p>
<p>Given the difference in chromium concentration, the results are shown as average turnover frequencies per total chromium atoms.</p>
<p>No allowance was made for the support activity, since estimates of this part of activity at various times-on-stream are unreliable.</p>

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Initially developed for various industrial applications, these catalysts have become pivotal in processes requiring selective dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons to produce more valuable alkenes. Key research focuses have centered on understanding the catalyst's structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. 

The structure of these catalysts typically involves chromium oxide particles supported on various substrates like alumina or zirconia. Promoters, such as potassium, have been introduced to enhance selectivity by neutralizing acidic sites that might otherwise cause undesirable reactions like cracking and coking, thereby extending catalyst life and improving efficiency. 

Active sites on chromium oxide catalysts are often characterized as mononuclear chromium(III) species with two coordinative vacancies, sometimes involving an adjacent oxygen ion from the support material. These sites enable efficient conversion of hydrocarbons like propane and isobutane into alkenes through a series of chemical reactions, including dehydrogenation and cracking. 

Research efforts have also focused on understanding how these catalysts interact with the reaction atmosphere, demonstrating that the catalytic properties are largely influenced by the gas-phase conditions rather than the catalyst's initial preparation. This highlights the dynamic nature of the active sites, which adapt to changing environments, and underscores the importance of surface chemistry in determining catalyst performance.

Moreover, the role of the support material, particularly zirconia, has been extensively studied. Zirconia not only provides a stable framework for the chromium oxide but also contributes to the catalyst's overall activity, particularly at lower temperatures. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the zirconia surface, which act as Bronsted acid sites, further enhances the catalyst's ability to perform dehydrogenation reactions efficiently.

In summary, the evolution of chromium oxide catalysts since their discovery has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure-function relationships, optimization of active sites, and tailoring of support materials to improve selectivity and activity. These catalysts continue to play a crucial role in petrochemical industries, particularly in processes like the conversion of low-value hydrocarbons into higher-value products.

The overall picture that emerges from the study of chromium oxide-based catalysts reveals their versatility and adaptability in dehydrogenation processes. The findings suggest that the same active site responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane also operates in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. This site involves mononuclear chromium(III) species with two coordinative vacancies, possibly accompanied by an adjacent oxygen ion from the support. The presence of such active sites, along with the optimized support materials and promoters, ensures the high activity and selectivity observed in these catalysts.

The results highlight the importance of surface chemistry and the intricate relationship between the catalyst's structure, active sites, support materials, and promoter incorporation. These factors collectively determine the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation processes, making chromium oxide-based catalysts indispensable tools in the petrochemical industry for converting low-value hydrocarbons into more valuable alkenes.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展。最初，它们被开发用于各种工业应用，并在需要选择性脱氢将饱和烃转化为更宝贵的烯烃的过程中发挥了关键作用。研究重点主要集中在理解催化剂的结构、识别活性位点、优化支撑材料、引入促进剂以及阐明反应机制。

这些催化剂的结构通常涉及以氧化铬颗粒形式存在的铬氧化物，支撑在如氧化铝或二氧化锆等基质上。引入诸如钾这样的促进剂有助于通过中和可能导致副反应（裂解和结焦）的酸性位点来增强选择性，从而延长催化剂寿命并提高效率。

这些催化剂上的活性位点通常被描述为单核的铬(III)物种，具有两个协调空缺，有时还涉及支持材料中的相邻氧离子。这些位点能够高效地将烃类转化为烯烃，包括脱氢和裂解一系列化学反应。

研究工作也关注了这些催化剂如何与反应气氛相互作用，显示了其催化性质很大程度上受到气体相条件的影响，而与催化剂的初始制备无关。这突出了表面化学在决定催化剂性能方面的重要性。

此外，支撑材料的作用，特别是二氧化锆，受到了广泛研究。二氧化锆不仅为氧化铬提供了稳定框架，而且对催化剂的整体活性也至关重要，尤其是在较低温度下。二氧化锆表面上存在的羟基团作为Bronsted酸位点，进一步增强了催化剂进行脱氢反应的能力。

综上所述，铬氧化物催化剂自从其发现以来的发展体现了对其结构功能关系的理解、活性位点优化和支撑材料定制的进展。这些催化剂继续在石油化学工业中发挥关键作用，特别是在将低价值烃转化为更高价值产品的过程中。

从研究铬氧化物基催化剂的视角，可以得出它们在脱氢过程中的多功能性和适应性。研究表明，在丙烷脱氢中起作用的相同活性位点也参与了异丁烷脱氢。这种位点涉及到单核的铬(III)物种，具有两个协调空缺，可能伴随支持材料中的相邻氧离子。通过这些活性位点以及优化的支撑材料和促进剂的结合，确保了这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的高活性和选择性。

结果强调了表面化学及其与催化剂结构、活性位点、支撑材料和促进剂引入之间的复杂关系。这些因素共同决定了催化剂在脱氢过程中的性能，使铬氧化物基催化剂成为石油化学工业中不可或缺的工具，用于将低价值烃转化为更宝贵的烯烃。

The document discusses the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts, focusing on their industrial applications and research areas. Key aspects include:

1. Chromium oxide catalysts are well documented for their superior performance, typically supported on aluminas.
2. Zirconium dioxide has gained attention as a catalyst support.
3. Catalyst activity is primarily conditioned by the reaction atmosphere rather than pretreatment methods.
4. The active sites consist of mononuclear chromium (III) species with two coordinative unsaturations, possibly including adjacent oxygen ions from the support.
5. The catalysts exhibit similarities to those used in propane dehydrogenation, suggesting the same active site is responsible for both reactions.
6. The dehydrogenation of isobutane on these catalysts is efficient and selective, with high conversion to isobutene and minimal formation of byproducts.
7. The document includes details on catalyst preparation, such as the use of zirconia and alumina supports, and the preparation of chromium oxide catalysts through equilibrium adsorption.
8. The dehydrogenation rate correlates positively with chromium concentration, with a linear relationship across different temperatures.
9. The catalysts show improved stability and activity when treated with oxygen at 773 K.
10. The deactivation mechanism involves coke formation, which affects the rate of dehydrogenation.

This document contributes to the understanding of chromium oxide catalysts, particularly in the context of dehydrogenation processes, highlighting their structure, active sites, and optimization strategies.
