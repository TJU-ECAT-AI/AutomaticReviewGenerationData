<p>The subject of considerable practical interest is the conversion, by catalytic dehydrogenation, of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes.</p>
<p>As regards oxide systems, the superior performances of chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented.</p>
<p>Zirconium dioxide has recently been the focus of some attention as catalyst support.</p>
<p>We have more recently turned our attention to the dehydrogenation of iso- butane on the same type of chromia/zirconla catalysts and our findings are included in the present paper.</p>
<p>An added stimulus to our research was the importance of isobutene in the synthesis of methyl tert-butyl ether, MTBE, by reaction with methanol.</p>
<p>The main results of this study were (i) the surface composition and with it the catalytic properties are conditioned chiefly by the reaction atmosphere, irrespective of catalyst pretreatment, (ii) oxygen treatment at 773 K completely restores the activity of a deactivated catalyst, (iii) the active sites are mononuclear CrIllspecies, and (iv) adjacent surface 0 2- ions of the support are also probably involved in the active centre.</p>
<p>The overall picture shows closesimilarities with that of propane dehydrogenation studied previously.</p>
<p>Specifically, the No values for the isobutane reaction on chromia/zirconia are ca. 20% lower than those for the propane reaction in the overall temperature range explored.</p>

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, primarily through advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to convert low-value saturated hydrocarbons into higher-value alkenes.

2. Key industrial applications of chromium oxide-based catalysts include the production of alkenes from hydrocarbons, which are used in various chemical processes including the synthesis of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE).

3. Research focuses on the surface composition and catalytic properties of these catalysts, which are primarily influenced by the reaction atmosphere rather than the catalyst's pretreatment. Oxygen treatment at 773 K effectively restores the activity of deactivated catalysts.

4. Active sites in these catalysts are identified as mononuclear chromium (III) species with two coordinative unsaturations and likely an adjacent oxygen ion from the support, which plays a role in the reaction mechanism.

5. The performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts shows similarities with propane dehydrogenation, particularly in the stability of activity above 773 K, the effect of potassium addition, the invariance of turnover frequency with chromium loading, and the higher turnover frequency compared to other chromium oxide systems.

6. The effectiveness of chromium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes is attributed to the presence of a unique active site, involving mononuclear chromium (III) species with two coordinative unsaturations and an adjacent oxygen ion from the support, which facilitates the dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，主要通过对其结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解进行改进。它们在脱氢化过程中的应用至关重要，能够将低价值的饱和烃转化为更有价值的烯烃。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂的关键工业应用包括从烃类生产烯烃，这些烯烃用于各种化学过程，如甲基叔丁基醚（MTBE）的合成。

3. 研究重点在于催化剂的表面组成及其催化性质，这些性质主要受反应气氛的影响，而不是催化剂的预处理。773 K的氧气处理可以有效恢复失活催化剂的活性。

4. 这些催化剂中的活性位点被识别为具有两个配位不饱和度的单核铬（III）物种以及支持物上的邻近氧离子，该氧离子在反应机制中发挥作用。

5. 铬氧化物催化剂的性能与丙烷脱氢化过程显示出相似性，特别是在高于773 K的活性稳定性、钾添加的效果、铬负载下转速频率的不变性和与其它铬氧化物系统相比的更高转速频率。

6. 铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢化过程中的有效性归因于一个独特的活性位点的存在，该位点涉及具有两个配位不饱和度的单核铬（III）物种以及支持物上的邻近氧离子，这促进了脱氢化反应。
