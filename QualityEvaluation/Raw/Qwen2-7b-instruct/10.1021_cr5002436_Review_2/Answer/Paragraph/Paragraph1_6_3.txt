            The vast majority of catalysts suggested for FTO contain iron, offering economic advantages over cobalt but with distinct differences in activity and selectivity. The design strategy used by Kang et al. for a zeolite supported FTO catalyst showcases the use of a bifunctional catalyst where the FT active metal transforms syngas into primary straight hydrocarbon chains that undergo cracking on the acid zeolite to produce shorter hydrocarbons. Wang et al.'s FeMn catalyst demonstrates a high C2C4 olefins selectivity (50%) at high CO conversion rates (over 90%) with a methane selectivity of about 30%. The highest light olefins selectivity was obtained with a catalyst prepared using the Fe4(CO)13H2 precursor impregnated on alumina, highlighting the effectiveness of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

            Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have significantly advanced, focusing on structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms. They play a pivotal role in dehydrogenation processes, notably in the production of petrochemicals like polypropylene, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide. Research focuses on enhancing catalyst activity and selectivity, exploring the roles of chromium species (Cr3+, Cr2+, Cr6+) in dehydrogenation, and the impact of support materials. Challenges like carbon deposition leading to deactivation necessitate periodic regeneration through oxidation, while advanced reactor designs manage these processes, optimizing conversion rates. The text highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions between chromium species and support materials to improve catalyst efficiency.

            Chromium oxide catalysts, initially used for WWII butane-to-butenes conversion, have evolved to efficiently convert propane to propene industrially. Their operating conditions under 0.3 to 0.5 atm and 823 to 923 K demonstrate the catalysts' ability to undergo detailed analysis via X-ray diffraction, UV-visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, EPR, IR, and temperature-programmed reduction. The deactivation of these catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes due to carbonaceous species deposition on the catalyst surface necessitates periodic regeneration through oxidation. Advanced reactor designs manage these processes, optimizing conversion rates.

            Chromium oxide-based catalysts, discovered in 1933, have evolved significantly, playing a crucial role in dehydrogenation processes to produce propene and isobutene from paraffins. Their industrial significance stems from the extensive use of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, where redox-active Cr3+ sites on the catalyst's surface are believed to serve as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Studies show that at lower loadings, chromium anchors as Cr6+ species on the aluminum oxide support, while at higher loadings, Cr3+ sites resist oxidation, stabilized by the alumina support. The reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under specific conditions, such as hydrogen, methane, or n-butane at 580°C, confirms the importance of these sites in catalytic activity.

            Chromium oxide catalysts, since their 1933 discovery, have significantly advanced, notably in ethylene polymerization, forming the Phillips catalyst for high-density polyethylene production. They've expanded to linear low-density polyethylene and copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1. Also pivotal in propylene polymerization, dehydrogenation, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming, these catalysts' research emphasizes structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Insights like the redox behavior of chromium on alumina, sulfur dioxide, and silica-alumina highlight ongoing studies aiming to elucidate catalytic properties.

            Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, focusing on understanding their structure, active sites, and reaction mechanisms. Key applications include dehydrogenation processes in refining and CO gas sensor technology. Precious metals like Pt, Pd, Rh, and Au are traditionally used for efficiency near ambient temperatures, but efforts focus on developing cost-effective alternatives using base metals and multi-component systems. Studies on the impact of chromium oxide surfaces on CO, CO2, and O2 adsorption behavior and the effects of gamma irradiation on Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts contribute to their environmental and industrial significance. Research highlights the role of Cr2O3 content and calcination temperature in influencing catalyst properties, with findings indicating that an increase in chromium oxide content enhances activity.

            Chromium oxide catalysts, discovered in 1933, have evolved significantly, focusing on identifying active sites, understanding the favored chromium(I1) oxidation state, and studying the nuclearity and structure of these sites. Key research areas include the role of coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(I1) ions, which are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation, and the impact of carbonaceous deposits on these sites. Studies employing infrared spectroscopy and kinetic measurements have elucidated the nature of the active sites and the consistency of the apparent activation energy across different dehydration temperatures. These advancements highlight the catalysts' importance in dehydrogenation processes, underscoring ongoing efforts to optimize their performance and understand the underlying mechanisms.

            Chromium oxide-based catalysts have significantly impacted chemical reactions, especially in petrochemicals since their discovery in 1933, with key applications in refining crude oil, petrochemical synthesis, and fuel/plastic production. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst structure, identifying active sites (chromium species), selecting support materials (e.g., SBA-15), utilizing promoters (like cerium), and exploring reaction mechanisms. Structure's arrangement and dispersion enhance performance, while support materials stabilize catalysts, affecting efficiency. Promoters improve activity, and reaction mechanisms often involve chromium reduction for dehydrogenation, with CO2 as an oxidant.

            Chromium oxide-based catalysts, pivotal in industrial processes since their 1933 discovery, notably for producing HDPE and LLDPE via the Phillips catalyst, and facilitating butane dehydrogenation. Their industrial significance and molecular structure, especially under hydrated and dehydrated conditions, attract extensive research. Techniques like in situ Raman spectroscopy are employed to study these catalysts under catalytic conditions, revealing insights into their reactivity during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation. Research highlights the ease of reduction of polymeric surface chromium oxide species over monomeric ones on the same support, impacting redox behavior. This behavior is temperature-dependent, observable through Cr6+ Raman band intensities during butane dehydrogenation.

            Supported vanadium oxide catalysts contain a vanadia phase deposited on the surface of an oxide support (e.g., A1203, TiO2, SIO2, etc.). In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3, and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR. The higher surface density of surface vanadia species increases the number of catalytic active sites and minimizes unwanted side reactions from exposed oxide support sites. Comparison of the molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species. Supported vanadia catalysts possess unique properties among supported metal oxide catalysts, including a weaker acidic character relative to other transition metal oxides, which may minimize unwanted side reactions.

            The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane under oxidative and nonoxidative conditions has been investigated in a flow apparatus. Under nonoxidative conditions at 823 K, the initial activity varies between 1.56 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1 for the sample Ga/Cr 70/30 and 2.62 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1 for the sample Ga/Cr 50/50. Under oxidative conditions, the catalytic activity at 673 K, after 5 h of reaction, varies between 0.45 and 1.22 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1. The system was found to be highly active and selective in the dehydrogenation of propane at 723–823 K. Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III). The deactivation rate and the amount of coke formed are a function of the chromium dispersion and content, the deactivation rate being higher at higher amounts of Cr2O3 deposited on alumina. That means, according to De Rossi et al., that oxygen ions located on pillars and zirconium phosphate layers, neighbors to metallic ions, are involved in the DH of propane. When comparing DH and ODH data, some interesting points must be noticed: The activity in the conversion of propane to propene is much higher using the oxidative method, the last reaction being at a lower temperature, 673 K. A VAPO-5 has been prepared as described by Concepcion et al. for a comparative study and tested under the same conditions as the pillared Ga/Cr solids. On one hand, this aluminophosphate presents an activity value of 0.14 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1, a much lower value than those observed for pillared catalysts (Figure 3). In this way, the porous structure of the pillared material improves the accessibility of both molecules to the catalytic active sites.

            Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Over V-Mg-O Catalysts was a 1988 study by ChemInform demonstrating that adjusting the propane/O2 ratio impacts propane conversion and propene formation selectivity, notably at 500-540°C, where a shift from 1:2 to 1:1 ratios decreases propane conversion (from 33% to 23%) while increasing propene formation selectivity (from 43% to 53%). This illustrates the catalysts' selective and efficient performance, highlighting their industrial significance.

            The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mciver and by Kearby. All the newer studies primarily focus on identifying the active sites, influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selecitivity, as well as elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism. The catalystic oxidation of CO by O2 is of environmental and industrial importance, utilizing in an increasing number of practical applications. The most efficient CO-oxidation catalysts are precious metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh and Au which catalyse the CO-oxidation reaction near ambient temperatures. Multi-component catalyst systems exhibit high catalystic performance as compared to a single component system. The physicochemical effect of chromium oxide surfaces on the adsorption behaviour of CO, CO2 and O2 has been made the object of several inves- tigations using IR techniques. The effect of g-irradition on surface and cata- lystic properties of Cr2O3/Al2O3 was the object of recent investigations. The present work aimed to investigate the role of Cr2O3 content and precalcination temperature of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 system on its physicochemical, surface and catalystic properties. The data of specific surface areas of different adsorbents precalcined at various temperatures enabled the activation energy of sintering (DEs) to be determined by applying the relation [37,38]: SBET=A exp DEs RT. The increase in the catalystic activity due to the presence of increasing amounts of chromium oxide could also be attributed to a possible increase in the specific surface area of the treated catalysts. The departure of OH groups strongly bound to the catalysts surface takes place by heating at 400C (c.f. Fig. 1) or by exposure of these solids to suitable dose of g-rays [26].

                    自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在烷烃脱氢过程中的演化和工业重要性得到了显著提升。它们在聚丙烯、丙烯酸和丙二醇等石油化工产品的生产中扮演着至关重要的角色。研究重点包括催化剂结构的优化、活性位点的识别、支持材料的选择、促进剂的应用以及反应机理的探索。

                    自二战期间用于丁烷转化为丁烯以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著发展，现在能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。在0.3至0.5大气压和823至923开尔文的操作条件下，这些催化剂通过X射线衍射、紫外可见光谱、拉曼光谱、X射线光电子能谱、电子顺磁共振、红外光谱和温度程序化还原等技术进行详细分析。碳沉积导致催化剂失活需要定期通过氧化再生，而先进的反应器设计则管理这些过程，以优化转化率。

                    自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展显著，尤其是在乙烯聚合中形成菲利普斯催化剂，为高密度聚乙烯生产提供基础。它们已扩展到线性低密度聚乙烯和乙烯与丁烯-1的共聚。在聚丙烯聚合、脱氢、脱环化和催化重整中也发挥关键作用，这些催化剂的研究强调了结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制。关于铬氧化物表面对于CO、CO2和O2吸附行为的影响以及γ辐射对Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂性质的影响的研究，为它们在环境和工业领域的显著意义做出了贡献。研究强调了铬氧化物含量和煅烧温度对催化剂性质的影响，发现增加铬氧化物含量可以提高活性。

                    铬氧化物催化剂自1933年发现以来，发展显著，重点在于识别活性位点、理解铬(I1)氧化状态的偏好以及研究这些位点的核数和结构。关键研究领域包括负责乙烷脱氢的协调不饱和A型铬(I1)离子的作用，以及碳沉积对这些位点的影响。使用红外光谱学和动力学测量的研究已经阐明了活性位点的性质和不同脱氢温度下显热激活能的一致性。这些进展突出了催化剂在脱氢过程中的重要性，并强调了优化其性能和理解潜在机制的持续努力。

                    铬氧化物催化剂自1933年发现以来，在化学反应领域，尤其是石化领域，产生了重大影响，涉及原油精炼、石化合成和燃料/塑料生产。研究重点在于优化催化剂结构、识别活性位点（铬物种）、选择支持材料（例如SBA-15）、利用促进剂（如铈）以及探索反应机理。结构的排列和分散提高了性能，而支持材料稳定了催化剂，影响了效率。促进剂提高了活性，反应机制通常涉及铬的还原以促进脱氢，CO2作为氧化剂。

                    自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在工业过程中发挥了关键作用，特别是通过菲利普斯催化剂生产HDPE和LLDPE，以及促进丁烷脱氢。它们在分子结构，特别是在水合和脱水条件下的研究吸引了广泛的研究兴趣。原位拉曼光谱技术被用来研究这些催化剂在催化条件下的性质，揭示了它们在甲醇氧化和丁烷脱氢/氧化过程中的反应性。研究强调了表面铬氧化物物种易于还原的程度，这取决于相同的支撑。这种行为在不同的脱氢温度下是温度依赖性的，可以通过丙烷脱氢时Cr6+拉曼带强度的变化来观察。

                    支持的钒氧化物催化剂包含一个在氧化物支持（例如A1203、TiO2、SIO2等）表面上沉积的钒亚价态。近年来，这种支持的钒氧化物催化剂在氧化应用中找到了广泛的商业应用：选择性氧化间二甲苯为邻苯二甲酸酐、芳基芳烃的氨氧化、选择性催化还原NOx与NH3以及控制SO2氧化为SO3期间的SCR。表面钒物种的更高表面密度增加了催化活性位点的数量，并且减少了暴露于氧化物支撑位点的不希望的副反应。比较分子结构信息与相应的反应性/选择性信息提供了有关表面钒物种反应性的见解。支持的钒氧化物催化剂在支持金属氧化物催化剂中具有独特的特性，包括相对其他过渡金属氧化物（例如钼、铬、铼等）较弱的酸性特征，这可能减少不希望的副反应。

                    在流体装置中对丙烷的氧化和非氧化脱氢进行了调查。在823K的非氧化条件下，样品Ga/Cr 70/30的初始活性为1.56 μmol丙烯·g-1·s-1，样品Ga/Cr 50/50的初始活性为2.62 μmol丙烯·g-1·s-1。在673K的氧化条件下，经过5小时反应后，催化活性范围从0.45到1.22 μmol丙烯·g-1·s-1。该系统在723至823K的温度范围内表现出高度的活性和选择性。Cr(III)物种是活性位点，可能存在邻近Cr(III)的氧化物离子的作用。催化剂的失活速率和焦炭形成的数量是铬分布和含量的函数，失活速率在铝上沉积的Cr2O3量较高时更高。根据De Rossi等人的说法，位于支柱和锆磷酸层上的氧离子，与金属离子相邻，参与了丙烷的DH反应。比较DH和ODH数据时，一些值得注意的要点是：使用氧化方法将丙烷转化为丙烯的活性更高，最后的反应在较低温度（673 K）下进行。描述由Concepcion等人准备的VAPO-5作为比较研究，并在相同的条件下测试了作为层状Ga/Cr固体的基底。一方面，这种铝磷灰石表现出0.14 μmol丙烯·g-1·s-1的活性值，远低于层状催化剂观察到的活性（图3）。这样，多孔结构的层状材料改善了两个分子对催化活性位点的可访问性。

                    1988年的ChemInform研究展示了调整丙烷/O2比如何影响丙烷转化率和丙烯形成选择性，特别是在500-540°C的温度范围内，从1:2到1:1比率导致丙烷转化率从33%降至23%，而丙烯形成选择性从43%增至53%。这表明催化剂的选性和效率，突显了它们的工业重要性。

                    直到1960年代后期，关于Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的主要结果总结在Poole和Mciver的综述论文中以及Kearby的综述论文中。所有后续的研究主要集中在识别活性位点；影响制备和处理条件对铬氧化物物种的特性以及催化活性/选择性的影响；以及阐明脱氢机制。

                    催化CO的氧化与O2的反应在环境保护和工业领域至关重要，正被越来越多的实际应用所利用。最高效的CO氧化催化剂是铂、钯、铑和金，它们在接近室温下催化CO氧化反应。多组分催化剂系统表现出高于单一成分系统的高催化性能。铬氧化物表面对于CO、CO2和O2吸附行为的影响已被多种红外技术对象的多项研究调查。γ辐射对Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂表面和催化性质的影响是最近的研究对象。这项工作旨在研究Cr2O3含量和预煅烧温度对Cr2O3/Al2O3系统的物理化学、表面和催化性质的影响。不同预烧结温度下的特定表面积数据允许通过应用关系[37,38]:SBET=A exp DEs RT来确定烧结的激活能量。由于添加越来越多的铬氧化物而导致催化剂活性的增加也可以归因于处理催化剂后可能增加的特定表面积。

                    丙烷在500°C至540°C的温度范围内进行氧化和非氧化脱氢的研究表明，从1:2到1:1的丙烷/O2比例变化导致丙烷转化率从33%降低至23%，而丙烯形成选择性从43%增加至53%。这表明催化剂的选择性和效率，突显了它们的工业重要性。
