Key industrial applications and research focus areas include the structure of chromium oxides, which can exist in various forms supported on materials like alumina and zirconia. Active sites, primarily chromium species, enable the dehydrogenation of propane to propene and hydrogen under non-oxidative conditions, or to propene and oxygen under oxidative conditions. Gallium (Ga) as a promoter enhances catalytic activity. Reaction mechanisms differ under oxidative and non-oxidative conditions. Support materials, such as zirconium phosphate, improve accessibility and mechanical strength. Promoters like Ga aid in dispersion and create a porous structure. Deactivation is influenced by factors like chromium dispersion and content.
