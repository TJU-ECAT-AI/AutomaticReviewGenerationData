            Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have significantly evolved, particularly in industrial applications for dehydrogenating alkanes into alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene. They're also explored for oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidation of organic compounds with oxygen, though oxygen usage often results in deep oxidation, reducing selectivity. Recently, carbon dioxide has garnered attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, serving as a mild oxidant. Its role in partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane, has been reported. This study focuses on analyzing the kinetic aspects of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, aiming to elucidate the role of CO2 and the reaction mechanism, contributing to the catalysts' multifaceted research.

These catalysts have been pivotal in the petrochemical industry, notably in the production of high-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene, and ethylene-butene-1 copolymers. They are also crucial in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst performance through structure optimization, identifying active sites, selecting support materials, utilizing promoters, and exploring reaction mechanisms.

            Challenges, including deactivation due to carbon deposition, are managed through periodic oxidation for catalyst regeneration. Advanced reactor designs address both deactivation and regeneration, optimizing performance and efficiency. Chromium oxide catalysts continue to evolve, driven by ongoing research into their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms.

            The catalyst's role in alkane dehydrogenation is proportional to the amount of surface chromium, peaking at 7.5 wt.% CrAl2O3 catalysts at 500°C with 2% isobutane in N2. Cr-sites outperform Cr2q-sites in alkane dehydrogenation. The active A-type chromium(I1) ions responsible for ethane dehydrogenation are coordinatively unsaturated Cr(I1) ions in a state of low nuclearity. These findings underscore the catalysts' significance in dehydrogenation processes and their continued research focus.

            Future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies.
