Until now, most characterization studies were conducted under conditions that were quite distant from actual catalytic conditions. Surface Cr-species form under reaction conditions at the expense of Cr6. The degree of reduction, as assessed by the amount of H2 or CO consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, diminishes with the increase in the number of reduction-dehydrogenation recalcination cycles.

The development of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been significant since their discovery in 1933, particularly in their industrial importance for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. This process offers an alternative route for obtaining alkenes from inexpensive saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks, which are then used in polymerization and other organic syntheses.

          Chromium(III) ions are considered active sites in these catalysts, with oxide ions nearby potentially playing a supportive role. The system demonstrates high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation at temperatures ranging from 723 to 823 K.

          One major challenge in dehydrogenation processes is the formation of coke during the reaction in an inert atmosphere, which necessitates a regeneration process. Additionally, the endothermic nature of the process leads to high temperatures, posing further challenges.

          Under oxidative conditions, the catalyst shows stable activity at 673 K with negligible deactivation, highlighting its robustness in maintaining efficiency even in demanding environments.

          The activity of the catalyst varies depending on the specific composition, with the Ga/Cr 10/90 sample demonstrating the highest activity. Sometimes, VMgO compounds can achieve activity levels up to 1.8 μmol of propene per gram of catalyst per hour, typically operating at a higher temperature of 773 K.

          It is suggested that the rate-determining step in oxidative dehydrogenation might be controlled by the reaction rate of potassium-exchanged pillared solids and unexchanged homologues, implying a significant role of potassium ions in modifying the catalyst's activity and selectivity.
