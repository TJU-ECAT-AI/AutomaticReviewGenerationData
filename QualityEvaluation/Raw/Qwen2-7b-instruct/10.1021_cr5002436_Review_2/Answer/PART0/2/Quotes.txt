          [10] "The ALE catalysts, together with catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation were examined for oxidation state distribution of chromium (XPS and wet-chemical method), dispersion of CrOx (H2-TPR, solubility of Cr6+ surface species, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and IR), and activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has a considerable industrial impact because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstock of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."

          [5] "Reduction of Cr6+ (and Cr5+) under dehydrogenation conditions or during the prereduction of CrOx/Al2O3 has been concluded to result mainly in the formation of Cr3+, i.e. redox Cr3+ [3,4,7,8,10,1214]."
          [6] "Al2O3 support appears to stabilize Cr3+ against reduction below the 3+ state [1,15], although some papers also describe the formation of Cr2+[1620]."
          [7] "In our work [21],we showed that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ by hydrogen,methane, or n-butane at 580C [21], and in accordance with others [7,8,10,14], we proposed that the redox Cr3+ sites are active in dehydrogenation."

          [10] "The ALE catalysts, together with catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation were examined for oxidation state distribution of chromium (XPS and wet-chemical method), dispersion of CrOx (H2-TPR, solubility of Cr6+ surface species, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and IR), and activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has a considerable industrial impact because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstock of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."

          [9] "In the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction, the Cr6+ species as the active phase is reduced to Cr3+ as a less active species by the dehydrogenated process, simultaneously, the reduced Cr3+ species can be reoxidized to Cr6+ species by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species play an important role in the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction over the catalysts."

[1] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:"
          [2] "CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13]."
          [3] "In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propene formation and in a consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."
          [2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."
          [3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]."
          [4] "At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+,which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]."
          [5] "Reduction of Cr6+ (and Cr5+) under dehydrogenation conditions or during the prereduction of CrOx/Al2O3 has been concluded to result mainly in the formation of Cr3+, i.e. redox Cr3+ [3,4,7,8,10,1214]."
          [6] "Al2O3 support appears to stabilize Cr3+ against reduction below the 3+ state [1,15], although some papers also describe the formation of Cr2+[1620]."
          [7] "In our work [21],we showed that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ by hydrogen,methane, or n-butane at 580C [21], and in accordance with others [7,8,10,14], we proposed that the redox Cr3+ sites are active in dehydrogenation."
          [8] "In the present study, the saturating reaction of Cr(acac)3 with Al2O3 was investigated in detail by recording FT-IR spectra of the surface Cr complex."
          [9] "Furthermore, catalysts were prepared by ALE with a Cr loading up to 12.5 wt.% Cr (10 cycles)."
          [10] "The ALE catalysts, together with catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation were examined for oxidation state distribution of chromium (XPS and wet-chemical method), dispersion of CrOx (H2-TPR, solubility of Cr6+ surface species, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and IR), and activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has a considerable industrial impact because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstock of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
          [2] "As a consequence, only a limited amount of information is known about the oxidation state and coordination environment of the active dehydrogenation site."
          [3] "Therefore, research must be directed towards the catalytic characterization under in situ conditions."
          [4] "The goal of this paper is to explore its possibilities and limitations for studying heterogeneous catalysts."
          [5] "Taking into account the surface areas of the used supports and that monolayer coverage is only reached at about 4 Crnm1, one can conclude that the Cr-based catalysts under study with the exception of 4 wt.% ZrO are below monolayer coverage and predominantly contain surface Cr-species."
          [6] "It is important to stress that this technique has been successfully introduced in the field of drugs and pharmaceuticals design."
          [7] "However, to our best knowledge, not in the field of heterogeneous catalysis."
          [8] "It is clear that at high reaction temperatures the dehydrogenation activity increases with increasing IEP; i.e., with an increasing amount of Al O in the support."
          [9] "In order to develop a relevant model to relate the Cr-speciation with the reaction time and temperature, the gas composition, the support composition and the Cr-loading, one has to define the response factor z."
          [10] "We have selected as response factor z the Kubelka-Munk intensity of the band typical for reduced Cr."

[1] "In the case of silica supported vanadia, the surface vanadia coverage was found to be approximately 7-8 VOx per nm 2."
          [2] "However, the polymerized surface vanadia species, which are more concentrated at higher surface concentrations, are more easily reduced than the isolated surface vanadia species."
          [3] "For hydrocarbon oxidation reactions where the TOF increases with surface vanadia coverage it is not clear if this trend is due to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds or other factors (e.g., surface acidity, lateral interactions, number of active sites, etc.)."
          [4] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species."
          [5] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."

[1] "The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is strongly dependent on the specific support and can be evaluated by following the relative intensities of the Cr6+ RS bands as a function of the reaction temperature during butane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "This subject has been recently reviewed by us and there is now a general consensus that different oxidation and coordination states of Cr (Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6) can be present, which depend on the pretreatment, the Cr loading, and the support type and composition."
          [3] "We have demonstrated for the first time by Raman spectroscopy that two types of surface chromium oxide species are present on inorganic oxides: a monomeric species, which is difficult to reduce, and a polymeric species, which is more easily reducible on the same support."
          [4] "The sequence in redox behavior of supported chromium oxide species is not directly related with the catalytic activity during methanol oxidation."

[1] "Both supported chromium and a-Cr203 are known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [2] "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site. Chromium(I1) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (l-3),although Cr(II1) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."
          [3] "The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium catalysts has been studied by infrared spectroscopy, together with kinetic measurements."
          [4] "Low nuclearity A-type chromium(I1) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiOZ catalysts."
          [5] "The active A-type chromium(I1) sites were selectively poisoned by carbonaceous deposits during the dehydrogenation of ethane."
          [6] "Turnover frequencies, based on the calculated number of surface chromium atoms, were similar for Cr/SiOZ, Cr/A1201, and o-CrZOs, but a CrY zeolite was essentially inactive since chromium ions remain in the +3 oxidation state."
          [7] "The nuclearity of the active sites has also been investigated."
          [8] "Isolated and paired Cr(I1) ions have been identified through infrared studies."
          [9] "These divalent chromium ions are labelled A-type and B-type chromium(I1) ions,respectively."
          [10] "The evidence from the present study suggests that the coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(I1) ions,which result in the carbonyl band at 2182 cm-l,are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation."

[1] "Monitoring the events taking place in solid catalysts under operating conditions is crucial for understanding the reaction mechanism of many important chemical processes (13)."
          [2] "The current note introduces a new approach for measuring UVvis diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra of an operating catalyst."
          [3] "As an example, the changes taking place in chromia/alumina catalysts during alkane dehydrogenation are monitored by UVvis DR spectroscopy."
          [4] "Increasing the alumina pretreatment temperature had a positive effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the catalysts."
          [5] "Calcination at 1200C strongly deactivated all the catalysts (propene yield of approximately 4%)."
          [6] "The yield of propene for the series of chromia/alumina catalysts, where the alumina pretreatment temperature and the catalyst calcination temperature were varied, is shown in Fig. 2."
          [7] "The positions of the absorption bands are characteristic of the coordination environment of Cr3+ (23)."
          [8] "The main advantage of the current fiberoptic setup compared with the Praying Mantis setup is the speed of data collection: fast processes with the time scale of seconds can be followed through the use of a photo diode array detector."

[1] "The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known."
          [2] "Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and by oxidation."
          [3] "The designs of commercial reactors for this process take different approaches both to managing the deactivation and to the regeneration."
          [4] "The process takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis."
          [5] "In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke, which is deposited during the reaction cycle."

[1] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity."
          [2] "The initial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalyst of Frey and Huppke was prepared by coprecipitation of aluminium and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide, but numerous modified preparation procedures have since been developed."
          [3] "Generally speaking, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts can be prepared by three techniques:"
          [4] "In situ capabilities have only recently become commercially available, allowing for a limited number of in situ characterization studies."

[1] "Despite of the number of publications on the direct production of lower olefins via the FischerTropsch reaction, there has been no commercial application for this process in view of the low C2C4 olefins selectivity, low mechanical or chemical stability, or high methane production of some of the catalysts proposed up to now."
          [2] "Researchers have developed different catalytic systems based on metals that exhibit CO hydrogenation activity. Among these metals only iron, cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium have been found to be sufficiently active for their application."
          [3] "Iron is more robust than other metals and can withstand some contaminants present in coal or biomass-based syngas."
          [4] "The FTO route becomes more feasible with every improvement on activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic system. Iron can be presented as the metal of choice for the FTO reaction as it is inexpensive, it is highly selective toward olefins, and it is possible to achieve methane selectivities below the prediction of the ASF product distribution."
          [5] "The development of catalytic processes for the conversion of CO2 into olefins might gain importance in the future as an alternative pathway for light olefins production."

          [3] "Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."
          [4] "The accessibility of reactants to the active phase is a key factor that determines the efficiency of a catalyst."
          [5] "The higher the chromium content on the catalysts, the higher the number of active sites and the accessibility for the ODH of propane and oxygen, Cr(III) possibly being the active phase."
          [6] "The mechanism for the ODH is totally different to that of the DH reaction."

[1] "The catalystic oxidation of CO by O2 is of environmental and industrial importance. This re- action is being utilized in an increasing number of practical applications."
          [2] "The physicochemical effect of chromium oxide surfaces on the adsorption behaviour of CO, CO2 and O2 has been made the object of several inves- tigations using IR techniques."
          [3] "The rise in calcination temperature to 1000C made the appearance of minute amounts of a-Al2O3 and Cr3O4 besides the other phases (a-Cr2O3 and u-, k-Al2O3)."
          [4] "The activation energy of sintering (DEs) decreases markedly from 21 to 7.6 kJ mol1 by increasing the amount of Cr2O3 from 4.3 to 8.3 wt.% then increases progressively reaching to 33 kJ mol1 in the presence of 42.7 wt.% Cr2O3."
          [5] "The curves relating the catalystic activity (reaction rate constant per unit surface area) and precalcination temperature exhibited a maximum at 700 or 800C depending on the amount of Cr2O3 present."
          [6] "The rise in both Cr2O3 content and precalcination temperature of Cr2O3/Al2O3 system did not modify the mechanism of CO oxidation by O2 but changed the concentration of catalytically ac- tive constituents (surface chromium oxide species)."
