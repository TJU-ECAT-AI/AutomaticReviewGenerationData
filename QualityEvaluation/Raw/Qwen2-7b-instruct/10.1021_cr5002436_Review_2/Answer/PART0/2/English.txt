Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with advancements focusing on understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to convert low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into valuable alkenes. Despite progress, much remains unknown about the precise oxidation state and coordination environment of the active dehydrogenation sites.

In the context of silica-supported vanadia, the observed surface vanadia coverage is approximately 7-8 VOx per square nanometer. It is noted that polymerized surface vanadia species, which are more prevalent at higher surface concentrations, are more susceptible to reduction compared to isolated surface vanadia species. When the turnover frequency (TOF) in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions increases with surface vanadia coverage, it is uncertain whether this pattern is attributed to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds or other factors such as surface acidity, lateral interactions, or the number of active sites. The specific phase of the oxide support and the specific preparation method do not seem to affect the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites necessary for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions is contingent upon the specific reactant molecule involved.

The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is highly dependent on the specific support material and can be assessed by observing the relative intensities of the Cr6+ Raman bands as a function of the reaction temperature during butane dehydrogenation. Recent reviews have established a common understanding that different oxidation and coordination states of chromium (Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6) can exist, which are influenced by the pretreatment, chromium loading, and the type and composition of the support. Raman spectroscopy has enabled the identification of two distinct surface chromium oxide species on inorganic oxides: a monomeric species that is challenging to reduce and a polymeric species that is more readily reducible on the same support. It has been observed that the sequence of redox behavior among supported chromium oxide species does not directly correlate with their catalytic activity during methanol oxidation.

Supported chromium and a-Cr203 are recognized as active catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. Several attempts have been made to pinpoint the active site, with chromium(I1) being the preferred oxidation state. The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium catalysts has been explored using infrared spectroscopy and kinetic measurements. It is believed that low nuclearity A-type chromium(I1) ions are the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiOZ catalysts. The active A-type chromium(I1) sites are selectively poisoned by carbonaceous deposits during ethane dehydrogenation. Divalent chromium ions, identified as A-type and B-type chromium(I1) ions, have been studied. The evidence suggests that the coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(I1) ions, producing a carbonyl band at 2182 cm-l, are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation.

          These advancements contribute to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide catalysts in modern chemical processing, emphasizing the importance of continuous research and development in this area.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly advanced in both industrial applications and research focus areas. Initially used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butenes during World War II, these catalysts have been refined over decades. Industrial applications now include converting propane to propene, with commercial processes operating under conditions of 0.3 to 0.5 atmospheres and 823 to 923 Kelvin. The process takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke, which is deposited during the reaction cycle.

Commercial chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically made up of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support material, often with dopants to control deactivation and enhance selectivity. The original catalyst developed by Frey and Huppke involved coprecipitation of aluminum and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide, but many modified preparation methods have been introduced since then. Generally, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts can be produced using three techniques. The ability to perform in situ characterization has only recently become commercially feasible, enabling a limited number of in-situ studies.

Although numerous publications discuss the direct production of lower olefins via the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, commercial applications have been limited due to issues with low olefin selectivity, poor mechanical or chemical stability, and high methane production from some catalysts. Researchers have developed catalytic systems based on metals with CO hydrogenation activity, with iron, cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium being the most active. Iron is noted for its robustness and ability to handle contaminants in coal or biomass-based syngas. Improvements in catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability make the FTO route more viable, with iron being a preferred choice due to its low cost, high olefin selectivity, and potential to achieve methane selectivities below predictions. The future development of CO2-to-olefin conversion processes could become increasingly significant as an alternative pathway for light olefins production.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Initially, chromium oxide supported on alumina was widely used due to its high refractory surface area. However, issues like rapid deactivation due to side reactions and cracking led to the development of new support materials like zirconium phosphate, which provided a more stable structure for the chromium oxide. The focus shifted towards optimizing the dispersion of chromium oxide, leading to the creation of pillared materials where chromium oxide nanoparticles are permanently separated between the layers of the solid, enhancing the catalyst's surface area and reactivity.

          Research now emphasizes the role of chromium species, particularly Cr(III), in the activation of both propane molecules and oxygen, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism for oxidative dehydrogenation differs significantly from that of pure dehydrogenation, suggesting that chromium species play a crucial role in the activation of oxygen molecules.

          The use of potassium ion-exchanged samples also highlights the impact of surface chemistry on the catalyst's performance, indicating that the presence of potassium ions can modify the basicity of oxygen ions adjacent to active metal centers, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been evolving since their discovery in 1933, primarily through advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have gained significance in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to facilitate reactions efficiently and economically. Industrial applications range from petrochemical processing to environmental remediation, particularly in the reduction of harmful emissions and the recycling of valuable resources. Key research focus areas include the optimization of catalyst structures to enhance the selectivity and yield of desired products, the development of more durable and stable catalysts, and the integration of catalysts into practical industrial processes. Promoters, which are substances added to improve the catalyst's performance, are also a critical area of study. Understanding the precise locations and functionalities of active sites on the catalyst surface, as well as the interactions between the catalyst and the substrate, is crucial for advancing catalyst design and application. The physicochemical properties of chromium oxide catalysts, including their surface area, pore structure, and thermal stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. By manipulating these properties, researchers aim to tailor the catalysts to specific reaction conditions, thereby enhancing their efficiency and reducing costs. The presence of chromium oxide in the catalyst mixture affects the sintering process, which involves the aggregation of particles and the growth of crystallite sizes. This process impacts the catalyst's surface area and porosity, which are critical factors affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Understanding the mechanisms behind sintering and controlling these processes are essential for developing high-performance catalysts. Increasing the amount of chromium oxide in the Cr2O3/Al2O3 system leads to a rise in the catalyst's activity, as indicated by the reaction rate constant per unit surface area. This enhancement is attributed to an increase in the concentration of catalystically active constituents, such as surface chromium oxide species, without altering their energetic nature. However, the balance between the amount of chromium oxide and the resulting catalyst performance is critical, as too much chromium oxide can hinder the sintering process and reduce the catalyst's activity.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene using oxygen was an important process as an alternative to thermal cracking of ethane. Carbon dioxide is a promising oxidant for ethane dehydrogenation. The activity of the Ce-modified Cr/SBA-15 catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 is enhanced. The addition of cerium species significantly improves the dispersion of chromium species in 5CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. High-angle XRD results indicate that the addition of cerium species clearly improves the dispersion of chromium species in CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. Low-angle XRD and nitrogen adsorption isotherm results show that the well-defined hexagonally ordered structure of the catalysts was not disrupted during preparation. TPR results show that chromium species in Cr/SBA-15 and 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts exist as Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, with Cr6+ playing a crucial role in ODH of ethane with CO2. The addition of cerium species to Cr/SBA-15 catalysts dramatically alters redox properties and enhances the catalytic activity of chromium species in 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. In the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction, the Cr6+ species as the active phase is reduced to less active Cr3+ species by the dehydrogenation process. Simultaneously, reduced Cr3+ species can be reoxidized to Cr6+ species by CO2, making the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species important for the ODH of ethane with CO2 over catalysts.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts show contrasting effects when exposed to CO2. In Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, CO2 negatively impacts catalytic properties, whereas it exhibits a positive effect on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites can engage in alternative oxidative pathways for propene formation and participate in the consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been driven by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts are now widely used commercially to convert paraffins into propene and i-butene, demonstrating their significant role in dehydrogenation processes. The catalysts contain various chromium oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) depending on pretreatment, chromium concentration, and catalyst support material. At low loadings, chromium is anchored on aluminum oxide mainly as Cr6+ surface species. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation. The reduction of Cr6+ under dehydrogenation conditions or during pre-reduction of CrOx/Al2O3 leads to the formation of redox Cr3+ sites, which are considered active in the dehydrogenation reaction. Alumina supports seem to stabilize Cr3+ against reduction below the 3+ state, though some studies suggest the presence of Cr2+. The saturation reaction of chromium acetyl acetonate (Cr(acac)3) with aluminum oxide was explored in detail, utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to examine the surface chromium complex. Catalysts with a chromium loading up to 12.5 wt.% were prepared through atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and impregnation methods. These catalysts were evaluated for chromium oxidation state distribution, chromium oxide dispersion, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), solubility of Cr6+ surface species, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and infrared spectroscopy, as well as their activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane.

The physicochemical properties of chromium oxide catalysts, including their surface area, pore structure, and thermal stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. By manipulating these properties, researchers aim to tailor the catalysts to specific reaction conditions, thereby enhancing their efficiency and reducing costs. The presence of chromium oxide in the catalyst mixture affects the sintering process, which involves the aggregation of particles and the growth of crystallite sizes. This process impacts the catalyst's surface area and porosity, which are critical factors affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Understanding the mechanisms behind sintering and controlling these processes are essential for developing high-performance catalysts. Increasing the amount of chromium oxide in the Cr2O3/Al2O3 system leads to a rise in the catalyst's activity, as indicated by the reaction rate constant per unit surface area. This enhancement is attributed to an increase in the concentration of catalystically active constituents, such as surface chromium oxide species, without altering their energetic nature. However, the balance between the amount of chromium oxide and the resulting catalyst performance is critical, as too much chromium oxide can hinder the sintering process and reduce the catalyst's activity.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene using oxygen was an important process as an alternative to thermal cracking of ethane. Carbon dioxide is a promising oxidant for ethane dehydrogenation. The activity of the Ce-modified Cr/SBA-15 catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 is enhanced. The addition of cerium species significantly improves the dispersion of chromium species in 5CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. High-angle XRD results indicate that the addition of cerium species clearly improves the dispersion of chromium species in CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. Low-angle XRD and nitrogen adsorption isotherm results show that the well-defined hexagonally ordered structure of the catalysts was not disrupted during preparation. TPR results show that chromium species in Cr/SBA-15 and 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts exist as Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, with Cr6+ playing a crucial role in ODH of ethane with CO2. The addition of cerium species to Cr/SBA-15 catalysts dramatically alters redox properties and enhances the catalytic activity of chromium species in 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. In the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction, the Cr6+ species as the active phase is reduced to less active Cr3+ species by the dehydrogenation process. Simultaneously, reduced Cr3+ species can be reoxidized to Cr6+ species by CO2, making the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species important for the ODH of ethane with CO2 over catalysts.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts show contrasting effects when exposed to CO2. In Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, CO2 negatively impacts catalytic properties, whereas it exhibits a positive effect on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites can engage in alternative oxidative pathways for propene formation and participate in the consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been driven by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts are now widely used commercially to convert paraffins into propene and i-butene, demonstrating their significant role in dehydrogenation processes. The catalysts contain various chromium oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) depending on pretreatment, chromium concentration, and catalyst support material. At low loadings, chromium is anchored on aluminum oxide mainly as Cr6+ surface species. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation. The reduction of Cr6+ under dehydrogenation conditions or during pre-reduction of CrOx/Al2O3 leads to the formation of redox Cr3+ sites, which are considered active in the dehydrogenation reaction. Alumina supports seem to stabilize Cr3+ against reduction below the 3+ state, though some studies suggest the presence of Cr2+. The saturation reaction of chromium acetyl acetonate (Cr(acac)3) with aluminum oxide was explored in detail, utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to examine the surface chromium complex. Catalysts with a chromium loading up to 12.5 wt.% were prepared through atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and impregnation methods. These catalysts were evaluated for chromium oxidation state distribution, chromium oxide dispersion, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), solubility of Cr6+ surface species, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and infrared spectroscopy, as well as their activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with advancements focusing on understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to convert low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into valuable alkenes. Despite progress, much remains unknown about the precise oxidation state and coordination environment of the active dehydrogenation sites.

In the context of silica-supported vanadia, the observed surface vanadia coverage is approximately 7-8 VOx per square nanometer. It is noted that polymerized surface vanadia species, which are more prevalent at higher surface concentrations, are more susceptible to reduction compared to isolated surface vanadia species. When the turnover frequency (TOF) in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions increases with surface vanadia coverage, it is uncertain whether this pattern is attributed to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds or other factors such as surface acidity, lateral interactions, or the number of active sites. The specific phase of the oxide support and the specific preparation method do not seem to affect the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites necessary for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions is contingent upon the specific reactant molecule involved.

The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is highly dependent on the specific support material and can be assessed by observing the relative intensities of the Cr6+ Raman bands as a function of the reaction temperature during butane dehydrogenation. Recent reviews have established a common understanding that different oxidation and coordination states of chromium (Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6) can exist, which are influenced by the pretreatment, chromium loading, and the type and composition of the support. Raman spectroscopy has enabled the identification of two distinct surface chromium oxide species on inorganic oxides: a monomeric species that is challenging to reduce and a polymeric species that is more readily reducible on the same support. It has been observed that the sequence of redox behavior among supported chromium oxide species does not directly correlate with their catalytic activity during methanol oxidation.

Supported chromium and a-Cr203 are recognized as active catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. Several attempts have been made to pinpoint the active site, with chromium(I1) being the preferred oxidation state. The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium catalysts has been explored using infrared spectroscopy and kinetic measurements. It is believed that low nuclearity A-type chromium(I1) ions are the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiOZ catalysts. The active A-type chromium(I1) sites are selectively poisoned by carbonaceous deposits during ethane dehydrogenation. Divalent chromium ions, identified as A-type and B-type chromium(I1) ions, have been studied. The evidence suggests that the coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(I1) ions, producing a carbonyl band at 2182 cm-l, are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly advanced in both industrial applications and research focus areas. Initially used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butenes during World War II, these catalysts have been refined over decades. Industrial applications now include converting propane to propene, with commercial processes operating under conditions of 0.3 to 0.5 atmospheres and 823 to 923 Kelvin. The process takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke, which is deposited during the reaction cycle.

Commercial chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically made up of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support material, often with dopants to control deactivation and enhance selectivity. The original catalyst developed by Frey and Huppke involved coprecipitation of aluminum and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide, but many modified preparation methods have been introduced since then. Generally, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts can be produced using three techniques. The ability to perform in situ characterization has only recently become commercially feasible, enabling a limited number of in-situ studies.

Although numerous publications discuss the direct production of lower olefins via the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, commercial applications have been limited due to issues with low olefin selectivity, poor mechanical or chemical stability, and high methane production from some catalysts. Researchers have developed catalytic systems based on metals with CO hydrogenation activity, with iron, cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium being the most active. Iron is noted for its robustness and ability to handle contaminants in coal or biomass-based syngas. Improvements in catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability make the FTO route more viable, with iron being a preferred choice due to its low cost, high olefin selectivity, and potential to achieve methane selectivities below predictions. The future development of CO2-to-olefin conversion processes could become increasingly significant as an alternative pathway for light olefins production.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Initially, chromium oxide supported on alumina was widely used due to its high refractory surface area. However, issues like rapid deactivation due to side reactions and cracking led to the development of new support materials like zirconium phosphate, which provided a more stable structure for the chromium oxide. The focus shifted towards optimizing the dispersion of chromium oxide, leading to the creation of pillared materials where chromium oxide nanoparticles are permanently separated between the layers of the solid, enhancing the catalyst's surface area and reactivity.

          Research now emphasizes the role of chromium species, particularly Cr(III), in the activation of both propane molecules and oxygen, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism for oxidative dehydrogenation differs significantly from that of pure dehydrogenation, suggesting that chromium species play a crucial role in the activation of oxygen molecules.

          The use of potassium ion-exchanged samples also highlights the impact of surface chemistry on the catalyst's performance, indicating that the presence of potassium ions can modify the basicity of oxygen ions adjacent to active metal centers, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

          These advancements contribute to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide catalysts in modern chemical processing, emphasizing the importance of continuous research and development in this area.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly advanced in both industrial applications and research focus areas. Initially used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butenes during World War II, these catalysts have been refined over decades. Industrial applications now include converting propane to propene, with commercial processes operating under conditions of 0.3 to 0.5 atmospheres and 823 to 923 Kelvin. The process takes place in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle, hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam then subjected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke, which is deposited during the reaction cycle.

Commercial chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically made up of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support material, often with dopants to control deactivation and enhance selectivity. The original catalyst developed by Frey and Huppke involved coprecipitation of aluminum and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide, but many modified preparation methods have been introduced since then. Generally, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts can be produced using three techniques. The ability to perform in situ characterization has only recently become commercially feasible, enabling a limited number of in-situ studies.

Although numerous publications discuss the direct production of lower olefins via the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, commercial applications have been limited due to issues with low olefin selectivity, poor mechanical or chemical stability, and high methane production from some catalysts. Researchers have developed catalytic systems based on metals with CO hydrogenation activity, with iron, cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium being the most active. Iron is noted for its robustness and ability to handle contaminants in coal or biomass-based syngas. Improvements in catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability make the FTO route more viable, with iron being a preferred choice due to its low cost, high olefin selectivity, and potential to achieve methane selectivities below predictions. The future development of CO2-to-olefin conversion processes could become increasingly significant as an alternative pathway for light olefins production.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Initially, chromium oxide supported on alumina was widely used due to its high refractory surface area. However, issues like rapid deactivation due to side reactions and cracking led to the development of new support materials like zirconium phosphate, which provided a more stable structure for the chromium oxide. The focus shifted towards optimizing the dispersion of chromium oxide, leading to the creation of pillared materials where chromium oxide nanoparticles are permanently separated between the layers of the solid, enhancing the catalyst's surface area and reactivity.

          Research now emphasizes the role of chromium species, particularly Cr(III), in the activation of both propane molecules and oxygen, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism for oxidative dehydrogenation differs significantly from that of pure dehydrogenation, suggesting that chromium species play a crucial role in the activation of oxygen molecules.

          The use of potassium ion-exchanged samples also highlights the impact of surface chemistry on the catalyst's performance, indicating that the presence of potassium ions can modify the basicity of oxygen ions adjacent to active metal centers, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been evolving since their discovery in 1933, primarily through advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have gained significance in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to facilitate reactions efficiently and economically. Industrial applications range from petrochemical processing to environmental remediation, particularly in the reduction of harmful emissions and the recycling of valuable resources. Key research focus areas include the optimization of catalyst structures to enhance the selectivity and yield of desired products, the development of more durable and stable catalysts, and the integration of catalysts into practical industrial processes. Promoters, which are substances added to improve the catalyst's performance, are also a critical area of study. Understanding the precise locations and functionalities of active sites on the catalyst surface, as well as the interactions between the catalyst and the substrate, is crucial for advancing catalyst design and application. The physicochemical properties of chromium oxide catalysts, including their surface area, pore structure, and thermal stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. By manipulating these properties, researchers aim to tailor the catalysts to specific reaction conditions, thereby enhancing their efficiency and reducing costs. The presence of chromium oxide in the catalyst mixture affects the sintering process, which involves the aggregation of particles and the growth of crystallite sizes. This process impacts the catalyst's surface area and porosity, which are critical factors affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Understanding the mechanisms behind sintering and controlling these processes are essential for developing high-performance catalysts. Increasing the amount of chromium oxide in the Cr2O3/Al2O3 system leads to a rise in the catalyst's activity, as indicated by the reaction rate constant per unit surface area. This enhancement is attributed to an increase in the concentration of catalystically active constituents, such as surface chromium oxide species, without altering their energetic nature. However, the balance between the amount of chromium oxide and the resulting catalyst performance is critical, as too much chromium oxide can hinder the sintering process and reduce the catalyst's activity.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene using oxygen was an important process as an alternative to thermal cracking of ethane. Carbon dioxide is a promising oxidant for ethane dehydrogenation. The activity of the Ce-modified Cr/SBA-15 catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 is enhanced. The addition of cerium species significantly improves the dispersion of chromium species in 5CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. High-angle XRD results indicate that the addition of cerium species clearly improves the dispersion of chromium species in CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. Low-angle XRD and nitrogen adsorption isotherm results show that the well-defined hexagonally ordered structure of the catalysts was not disrupted during preparation. TPR results show that chromium species in Cr/SBA-15 and 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts exist as Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, with Cr6+ playing a crucial role in ODH of ethane with CO2. The addition of cerium species to Cr/SBA-15 catalysts dramatically alters redox properties and enhances the catalytic activity of chromium species in 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. In the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction, the Cr6+ species as the active phase is reduced to less active Cr3+ species by the dehydrogenation process. Simultaneously, reduced Cr3+ species can be reoxidized to Cr6+ species by CO2, making the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species important for the ODH of ethane with CO2 over catalysts.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts show contrasting effects when exposed to CO2. In Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, CO2 negatively impacts catalytic properties, whereas it exhibits a positive effect on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites can engage in alternative oxidative pathways for propene formation and participate in the consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been driven by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts are now widely used commercially to convert paraffins into propene and i-butene, demonstrating their significant role in dehydrogenation processes. The catalysts contain various chromium oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) depending on pretreatment, chromium concentration, and catalyst support material. At low loadings, chromium is anchored on aluminum oxide mainly as Cr6+ surface species. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation. The reduction of Cr6+ under dehydrogenation conditions or during pre-reduction of CrOx/Al2O3 leads to the formation of redox Cr3+ sites, which are considered active in the dehydrogenation reaction. Alumina supports seem to stabilize Cr3+ against reduction below the 3+ state, though some studies suggest the presence of Cr2+. The saturation reaction of chromium acetyl acetonate (Cr(acac)3) with aluminum oxide was explored in detail, utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to examine the surface chromium complex. Catalysts with a chromium loading up to 12.5 wt.% were prepared through atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and impregnation methods. These catalysts were evaluated for chromium oxidation state distribution, chromium oxide dispersion, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), solubility of Cr6+ surface species, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and infrared spectroscopy, as well as their activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with advancements focusing on understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to convert low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into valuable alkenes. Despite progress, much remains unknown about the precise oxidation state and coordination environment of the active dehydrogenation sites.

In the context of silica-supported vanadia, the observed surface vanadia coverage is approximately 7-8 VOx per square nanometer. It is noted that polymerized surface vanadia species, which are more prevalent at higher surface concentrations, are more susceptible to reduction compared to isolated surface vanadia species. When the turnover frequency (TOF) in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions increases with surface vanadia coverage, it is uncertain whether this pattern is attributed to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds or other factors such as surface acidity, lateral interactions, or the number of active sites. The specific phase of the oxide support and the specific preparation method do not seem to affect the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites necessary for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions is contingent upon the specific reactant molecule involved.

The redox behavior of supported chromium oxides is highly dependent on the specific support material and can be assessed by observing the relative intensities of the Cr6+ Raman bands as a function of the reaction temperature during butane dehydrogenation. Recent reviews have established a common understanding that different oxidation and coordination states of chromium (Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6) can exist, which are influenced by the pretreatment, chromium loading, and the type and composition of the support. Raman spectroscopy has enabled the identification of two distinct surface chromium oxide species on inorganic oxides: a monomeric species that is challenging to reduce and a polymeric species that is more readily reducible on the same support. It has been observed that the sequence of redox behavior among supported chromium oxide species does not directly correlate with their catalytic activity during methanol oxidation.

Supported chromium and a-Cr203 are recognized as active catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. Several attempts have been made to pinpoint the active site, with chromium(I1) being the preferred oxidation state. The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium catalysts has been explored using infrared spectroscopy and kinetic measurements. It is believed that low nuclearity A-type chromium(I1) ions are the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiOZ catalysts. The active A-type chromium(I1) sites are selectively poisoned by carbonaceous deposits during ethane dehydrogenation. Divalent chromium ions, identified as A-type and B-type chromium(I1) ions, have been studied. The evidence suggests that the coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(I1) ions, producing a carbonyl band at 2182 cm-l, are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation.
