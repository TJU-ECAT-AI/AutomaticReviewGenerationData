          Chromium oxide-based catalysts, particularly those of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 type, have been extensively studied since their discovery in 1933. Their superior properties in alkane dehydrogenation have made them a preferred commercial choice. Recent research primarily focuses on identifying active sites, understanding how preparation and treatment conditions affect the catalyst's properties, and elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism.

          Commercial chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically made up of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support material, often with dopants to control deactivation and enhance selectivity. The original catalyst developed by Frey and Huppke involved coprecipitation of aluminum and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide, but many modified preparation methods have been introduced since then. Generally, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts can be produced using three techniques. The ability to perform in situ characterization has only recently become commercially feasible, enabling a limited number of in-situ studies.

          [1] "Up to now, most reported characterization studies were done under conditions often far away from real catalytic conditions."
          [2] "Surface Cr-species are formed under reaction conditions at the expense of Cr6."
          [3] "The extent of reduction (as determined from the amount of H2 or CO consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts) decreases with increasing number of reduction-dehydrogenation recalcination cycles."

      <English>
          Until now, most characterization studies were conducted under conditions that were quite distant from actual catalytic conditions. Surface Cr-species form under reaction conditions at the expense of Cr6. The degree of reduction, as assessed by the amount of H2 or CO consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, diminishes with the increase in the number of reduction-dehydrogenation recalcination cycles.

          The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has significant industrial implications, as it offers a pathway to obtain alkenes from inexpensive saturated hydrocarbons. A critical review of the current knowledge on chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly the industrially employed Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, is presented. Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process requiring high temperatures and low pressures to achieve substantial alkenes yields. The main findings on Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s were outlined in reviews by Poole and McLver [6] and Kearby [7]. These catalysts undergo industrial cycling under oxidizing and reducing conditions, which profoundly impacts their physical and chemical structure, eventually causing catalyst deactivation. In situ techniques are now commercially available, facilitating a limited number of in situ characterization studies. In situ DRS spectroscopy on 0.18.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts reveals that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane, predominantly forming pseudo-octahedral Cr3.

          Since the discovery of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts by Frey and Huppke [4,5], several industrial companies have conducted extensive research to develop commercial dehydrogenation processes. Typically, commercial chromium-based catalysts consist of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support, often with dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity. The chromium loading usually ranges around 13 wt%, though dehydrogenation activity has been observed across the entire range from 0 to 20 wt%. Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is preferred for industrial use, other supports like zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have also been thoroughly studied. Alumina's undesirable characteristic of catalyzing degradation reactions, such as cracking and carbon deposition, leading to catalyst deactivation, is addressed by poisoning responsible acid sites with alkali ion dopants, primarily potassium, at up to 2 wt%. The surface composition of freshly prepared catalysts varies depending on the overall chromium loading, alumina surface area, and calcination treatment. Under reaction conditions, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species. The industrial cycling of these catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions significantly impacts their physicochemical structure, ultimately resulting in catalyst deactivation.
