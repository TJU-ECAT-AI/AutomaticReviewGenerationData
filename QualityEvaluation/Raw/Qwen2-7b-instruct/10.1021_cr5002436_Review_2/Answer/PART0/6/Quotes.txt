          [2] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity."
          [3] "The Cr loading is mostly around 13 wt% Cr [56], but dehydrogenation activity has been observed in the entire range between 0 and 20 wt% Cr."
          [4] "Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail [7]."
          [5] "Alumina possess the undesired feature of catalyzing degradation reactions, i.e. cracking and coking, leading to catalyst deactivation. To overcome these problems, the responsible acid sites are often poisoned with an alkali ion dopant, mostly potassium, in a concentration up to 2 wt%."
          [6] "As a consequence, different surface species are observed on the surface of freshly prepared catalysts, their relative concentration mainly depending on the overall Cr loading, the alumina surface area, and the calcination treatment."
          [7] "Cr/Al2O3 catalysts contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species under reaction conditions."
          [8] "The industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions strongly affects their physicochemical structure, and ultimately leads to catalyst deactivation."
