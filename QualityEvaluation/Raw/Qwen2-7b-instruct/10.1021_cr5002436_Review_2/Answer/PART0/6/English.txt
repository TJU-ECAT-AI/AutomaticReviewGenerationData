Since the discovery of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts by Frey and Huppke [4,5], several industrial companies have conducted extensive research to develop commercial dehydrogenation processes. Typically, commercial chromium-based catalysts consist of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support, often with dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity. The chromium loading usually ranges around 13 wt%, though dehydrogenation activity has been observed across the entire range from 0 to 20 wt%. Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is preferred for industrial use, other supports like zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have also been thoroughly studied. Alumina's undesirable characteristic of catalyzing degradation reactions, such as cracking and carbon deposition, leading to catalyst deactivation, is addressed by poisoning responsible acid sites with alkali ion dopants, primarily potassium, at up to 2 wt%. The surface composition of freshly prepared catalysts varies depending on the overall chromium loading, alumina surface area, and calcination treatment. Under reaction conditions, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species. The industrial cycling of these catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions significantly impacts their physicochemical structure, ultimately resulting in catalyst deactivation.
