          Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site of chromium oxide-based catalysts, with chromium(I1) being the favored oxidation state. Studies have shown that the nuclearity of the active sites is of interest, and that the coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(I1) ions, which result in a carbonyl band at 2182 cm-l, are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation. At low loadings, the active site is believed to be a coordinatively unsaturated Cr(I1) ion in a low nuclear state. The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium catalysts has been studied using infrared spectroscopy and kinetic measurements. The active A-type chromium(I1) sites are selectively poisoned by carbonaceous deposits during the dehydrogenation of ethane. The apparent activation energy remains constant across different dehydration temperatures, indicating that the number of sites changes but not the type. The active A-type chromium(I1) sites were studied using infrared spectroscopy and kinetic measurements.

          对于铬氧化物基催化剂的活性位点，已进行了大量尝试，其中1价铬是最受青睐的氧化状态。研究表明，活性位点的核度是值得关注的，协调不饱和的A型铬(I1)离子，产生2182 cm-l的羰基带，负责乙烷脱氢。在低负载下，活性位点被认为是一个在低核度状态的配位不饱和Cr(I1)离子。通过红外光谱和动力学测量研究了铬催化剂上乙烷脱氢的活性位点。活性A型铬(I1)位点在乙烷脱氢过程中被碳沉积物选择性地毒化。不同脱水温度下的显着激活能保持不变，表明改变的是位点的数量而非类型。使用红外光谱和动力学测量研究了活性A型铬(I1)位点。

          [1] "Both supported chromium and a-Cr203 are known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [2] "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site. Chromium(I1) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (l-3),although Cr(II1) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."
          [3] "The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium catalysts has been studied by infrared spectroscopy, together with kinetic measurements."
          [4] "Low nuclearity A-type chromium(I1) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiOZ catalysts."
          [5] "The active A-type chromium(I1) sites were selectively poisoned by carbonaceous deposits during the dehydrogenation of ethane."
          [6] "Turnover frequencies, based on the calculated number of surface chromium atoms, were similar for Cr/SiOZ, Cr/A1201, and o-CrZOs, but a CrY zeolite was essentially inactive since chromium ions remain in the +3 oxidation state."
          [7] "The nuclearity of the active sites has also been investigated."
          [8] "Isolated and paired Cr(I1) ions have been identified through infrared studies."
          [9] "These divalent chromium ions are labelled A-type and B-type chromium(I1) ions,respectively."
          [10] "The evidence from the present study suggests that the coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(I1) ions,which result in the carbonyl band at 2182 cm-l,are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation."

          Supported chromium and a-Cr203 are recognized as active catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. Several attempts have been made to pinpoint the active site, with chromium(I1) being the preferred oxidation state. The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium catalysts has been explored using infrared spectroscopy and kinetic measurements. It is believed that low nuclearity A-type chromium(I1) ions are the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiOZ catalysts. The active A-type chromium(I1) sites are selectively poisoned by carbonaceous deposits during ethane dehydrogenation. Divalent chromium ions, identified as A-type and B-type chromium(I1) ions, have been studied. The evidence suggests that the coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(I1) ions, producing a carbonyl band at 2182 cm-l, are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation.
