          [1] "Most characterization studies on supported chromium oxide catalysts describe the catalyst structure under conditions often far away from real catalytic ones."
          [2] "The dehydrogenation activity is proportional with the amount of in situ measured surface Cr, and maximum for a 7.5 wt.% CrAl2O3 catalyst operating at 500°C in 2% isobutane in N2."
          [3] "Cr-sites are more active in alkane dehydrogenation than Cr2q-sites."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with advancements focusing on understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They have become crucial in dehydrogenation processes due to their ability to convert low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into valuable alkenes. Despite progress, much remains unknown about the precise oxidation state and coordination environment of the active dehydrogenation sites.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的进化，重点研究包括理解其结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制。由于它们能够将低成本饱和烃转化为有价值烯烃，它们在脱氢化过程中变得至关重要。尽管取得了进展，但对于活性脱氢化位点的确切氧化状态和配位环境仍知之甚少。

          [1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has a considerable industrial impact because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstock of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
          [2] "As a consequence, only a limited amount of information is known about the oxidation state and coordination environment of the active dehydrogenation site."
          [3] "Therefore, research must be directed towards the catalytic characterization under in situ conditions."
          [4] "The goal of this paper is to explore its possibilities and limitations for studying heterogeneous catalysts."
          [5] "Taking into account the surface areas of the used supports and that monolayer coverage is only reached at about 4 Crnm1, one can conclude that the Cr-based catalysts under study with the exception of 4 wt.% ZrO are below monolayer coverage and predominantly contain surface Cr-species."
          [6] "It is important to stress that this technique has been successfully introduced in the field of drugs and pharmaceuticals design."
          [7] "However, to our best knowledge, not in the field of heterogeneous catalysis."
          [8] "It is clear that at high reaction temperatures the dehydrogenation activity increases with increasing IEP; i.e., with an increasing amount of Al O in the support."
          [9] "In order to develop a relevant model to relate the Cr-speciation with the reaction time and temperature, the gas composition, the support composition and the Cr-loading, one has to define the response factor z."
          [10] "We have selected as response factor z the Kubelka-Munk intensity of the band typical for reduced Cr."
