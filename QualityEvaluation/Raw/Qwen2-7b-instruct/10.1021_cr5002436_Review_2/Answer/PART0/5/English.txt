The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has significant industrial implications, as it offers a pathway to obtain alkenes from inexpensive saturated hydrocarbons. A critical review of the current knowledge on chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly the industrially employed Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, is presented. Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process requiring high temperatures and low pressures to achieve substantial alkenes yields. The main findings on Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s were outlined in reviews by Poole and McLver [6] and Kearby [7]. These catalysts undergo industrial cycling under oxidizing and reducing conditions, which profoundly impacts their physical and chemical structure, eventually causing catalyst deactivation. In situ techniques are now commercially available, facilitating a limited number of in situ characterization studies. In situ DRS spectroscopy on 0.18.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts reveals that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane, predominantly forming pseudo-octahedral Cr3.
