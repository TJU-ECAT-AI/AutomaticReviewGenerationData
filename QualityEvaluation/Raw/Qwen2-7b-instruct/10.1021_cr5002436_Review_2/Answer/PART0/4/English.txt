Until the late 1960s, the main findings regarding Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts were compiled in review papers by Poole and Mclver [6] and Kearby [7]. Subsequent research has explored catalysts such as CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3, and CrOx/ZrO2. A critical review of the current knowledge on chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly the industrially utilized Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, is provided here. In situ capabilities are now commercially accessible, and it has been discovered that there is a roughly quantitative link between the formation of pseudo-octahedral Cr3 by reduction and the dehydrogenation activity.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely utilized in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes since their discovery in 1933. These catalysts, when supported on various materials, demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane at temperatures between 723 and 823 K.

          A significant inconvenience in dehydrogenation processes in an inert atmosphere is the necessity of a regeneration step due to coke formation. Additionally, the endothermic nature of the process requires high temperatures, presenting further challenges.

          An alternative approach involves carrying out the catalytic process under oxidative conditions (ODH) with the presence of oxygen. This method still faces unresolved issues regarding the unknown reaction mechanism and the control of the high reactivity of the resulting products from the dehydrogenation process.

          The observed high activity of these catalysts is attributed to the presence of chromium(III) ions with coordination vacancies. In an inert atmosphere, these vacancies enable the activation of propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. Under oxidative conditions, the metal ion and oxygen form a labile coordination, which subsequently transfers to propane, yielding propene and water.

          The deactivation of catalysts used in dehydrogenation reactions is a controversial topic in the literature. Some researchers propose a correlation between deactivation and the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst, while others attribute this phenomenon to the appearance of chromium(II), which coincides with the formation and deposition of coke.

          In the structure of these catalysts, chromium(III) active sites are more accessible for propane oxidation compared to those found in chromium(III) oxide with a corindon-type structure, where vacancies are limited to the particle surface.

          The activity of these catalysts remains practically constant over extended periods, and the observed activity is closely related to the surface content of chromium.
