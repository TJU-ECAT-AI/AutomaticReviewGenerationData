          [5] "It was found that there is a  more or less  quantitative relationship between the amount of pseudo-octahedral Cr3 formed by reduction and the dehydrogenation activity."

[1] "Metals deposited on different supports and supported chromium oxide have been used as heterogeneous catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [2] "The system was found to be highly active and selective in the dehydrogenation of propane at 723–823 K."
          [3] "The dehydrogenation of propane in an inert atmosphere has two important inconveniences. The first one is the obliged regeneration process due to coke formation, and the second comes from the high-temperature reaction due to the endothermal nature of the process."
          [4] "An alternative way is to carry out the catalytic process under oxidative conditions (ODH), that is, with oxygen. This alternative has still two unsolved problems: the reaction mechanism not being well-known and the control of the high reactivity of the reaction products derived from the dehydrogenation process."
          [5] "The observed high activity is attributed to the presence of Cr(III) with coordination vacancies that, in an inert atmosphere, can activate propane molecules, yielding propene and hydrogen; while under oxidative conditions is capable of activating oxygen, by a labile coordination between the metal ion and oxygen, and its subsequent transfer to propane yielding propene and water."
          [6] "The deactivation of catalysts of this type for DH reactions is a subject of controversy in the literature. While some authors have proposed a correlation between deactivation and the amount of deposited coke on the catalyst,4,30-32 others have attributed this deactivation to the appearance of Cr(II), which would appear simultaneously with the formation and deposition of coke."
          [7] "In this structure, Cr(III) active sites are more accessible for propane oxidation than those in the case of Cr2O3 with a corindon-type structure where vacancies are only restricted to the particle surface."
          [8] "The activity is practically constant for a long time and the observed activity is also related to the surface chromium content."
