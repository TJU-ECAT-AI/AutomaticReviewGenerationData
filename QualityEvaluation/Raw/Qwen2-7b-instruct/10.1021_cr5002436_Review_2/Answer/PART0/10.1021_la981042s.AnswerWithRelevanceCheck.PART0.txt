          [1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane under oxidative and nonoxidative conditions has been investigated in a flow apparatus."
          [2] "Under nonoxidative conditions at 823 K, the initial activity varies between 1.56 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1 for the sample Ga/Cr 70/30 and 2.62 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1 for the sample Ga/Cr 50/50."
          [3] "Under oxidative conditions, the catalytic activity at 673 K, after 5 h of reaction, varies between 0.45 and 1.22 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1."
          [4] "The system was found to be highly active and selective in the dehydrogenation of propane at 723–823 K."
          [5] "Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."
          [6] "In the case of the system CrOx/ZrO2 reported by De Rossi et al.,4 the initial activity found for propene was only 0.68 μmol·g-1·s-1, working at the same reaction temperature."
          [7] "The deactivation rate and the amount of coke formed are a function of the chromium dispersion and content, the deactivation rate being higher at higher amounts of Cr2O3 deposited on alumina."
          [8] "That means, according to De Rossi et al.,4 that oxygen ions located on pillars and zirconium phosphate layers, neighbors to metallic ions, are involved in the DH of propane."
          [9] "When comparing DH and ODH data, some interesting points must be noticed: The activity in the conversion of propane to propene is much higher using the oxidative method, the last reaction being at a lower temperature, 673 K."
          [10] "A VAPO-5 has been prepared as described by Concepcion et al.13 for a comparative study and tested under the same conditions as the pillared Ga/Cr solids. On one hand, this aluminophosphate presents an activity value of 0.14 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1, a much lower value than those observed for pillared catalysts (Figure 3)."
          [11] "In this way, the porous structure of the pillared material improves the accessibility of both molecules to the catalytic active sites."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, particularly in their application to dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include:

          - **Structure**: Chromium oxides can exist in various forms, such as supported on various supports, including alumina, zirconia, and layered zirconium phosphates. These structures allow for dispersion of active chromium species, enhancing the accessibility of reactants to active sites.

          - **Active Sites**: Active sites are typically associated with chromium species, especially chromium(III), which can participate in the activation of propane molecules. Chromium(III) species, often in coordination vacancies, are crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane, yielding propene and hydrogen under non-oxidative conditions, or propene and oxygen under oxidative conditions.

          - **Support Materials**: Supports like zirconium phosphate provide a porous structure, enabling better mechanical strength, thermal stability, and large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active chromium species and enhances reactivity.

          - **Promoters**: In the context of this study, gallium (Ga) is introduced as a promoter. The mixed Ga/Cr oxides enhance the catalytic activity, likely due to the enhanced dispersion of active sites and the creation of a more porous structure that facilitates the interaction of propane molecules with active sites.

          - **Reaction Mechanisms**: Under oxidative conditions, chromium species can activate oxygen, leading to the production of water and propene. This mechanism is distinct from non-oxidative conditions, where chromium activates propane directly, producing propene and hydrogen.

          - **Deactivation**: The deactivation of chromium oxide catalysts, particularly due to coke formation, is influenced by factors such as the dispersion and content of chromium. Higher amounts of chromium can lead to faster deactivation rates, highlighting the importance of optimizing chromium concentration for sustained activity.

          Research in this field continues to explore the optimization of chromium oxide catalysts, focusing on improving selectivity, stability, and activity, particularly in the context of dehydrogenation processes. The ability to operate at lower temperatures for oxidative dehydrogenation, as demonstrated in this study, represents a significant advancement, potentially reducing energy requirements and enhancing economic viability.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中的应用经历了显著的演变。关键的工业应用和研究焦点领域包括：

          - **结构**：铬氧化物可以以不同的形式存在，例如支持在各种支撑材料上，包括氧化铝、氧化锆和层状锆磷灰石。这些结构允许活性铬物种的分散，增强反应物与活性位点的接触。

          - **活性位点**：活性位点通常与铬物种关联，特别是铬(III)，它可以在非氧化性条件下参与丙烷分子的活化，产生丙烯和氢气；或在氧化性条件下活化氧气，产生水和丙烯。

          - **支撑材料**：如层状锆磷灰石等支撑材料提供多孔结构，增强机械强度、热稳定性和大表面积，有助于活性铬物种的分散并增强反应性。

          - **促进剂**：在此研究中，镓（Ga）作为促进剂引入。混合的Ga/Cr氧化物提高了催化活性，可能是因为活性位点的增强分散以及形成更多孔结构，这有助于丙烷分子与活性位点的相互作用。

          - **反应机制**：在氧化性条件下，铬物种可以激活氧气，导致水和丙烯的生成。这一机制与非氧化性条件下的机制不同，在非氧化性条件下，铬直接激活丙烷，产生丙烯和氢气。

          - **失活**：铬氧化物催化剂的失活，特别是由于焦炭形成，受铬的分散和含量等因素的影响。更高的铬含量可能导致更快的失活速率，强调优化铬浓度对于保持活性的重要性。

          该领域的研究继续探索铬氧化物催化剂的优化，旨在提高选择性、稳定性和活性，特别是在脱氢过程中的应用。能够在较低温度下进行氧化性脱氢的发现，代表了一项重大进步，可能降低能效要求并提升经济可行性。

          The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Initially, chromium oxide supported on alumina was widely used due to its high refractory surface area. However, issues like rapid deactivation due to side reactions and cracking led to the development of new support materials like zirconium phosphate, which provided a more stable structure for the chromium oxide. The focus shifted towards optimizing the dispersion of chromium oxide, leading to the creation of pillared materials where chromium oxide nanoparticles are permanently separated between the layers of the solid, enhancing the catalyst's surface area and reactivity.

          Research now emphasizes the role of chromium species, particularly Cr(III), in the activation of both propane molecules and oxygen, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism for oxidative dehydrogenation differs significantly from that of pure dehydrogenation, suggesting that chromium species play a crucial role in the activation of oxygen molecules.

          The use of potassium ion-exchanged samples also highlights the impact of surface chemistry on the catalyst's performance, indicating that the presence of potassium ions can modify the basicity of oxygen ions adjacent to active metal centers, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展已经显著地推进了对它们结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解。最初，由于其高耐火表面面积，铝氧合物上支持的铬氧化物被广泛用作轻烷烃脱氢的异质催化剂。然而，由于快速失活和裂解等问题导致了新的支持材料的发展，如锆磷酸盐，为铬氧化物提供了更稳定的结构。研究重点转向优化铬氧化物的分散，通过创造层间隔开的纳米颗粒结构，提高了催化剂的表面积和活性。

          现在的研究强调铬物种，特别是Cr(III)，在促进丙烷分子和氧气激活中的作用，促进了脱氢过程。氧化脱氢的机制与纯脱氢大不相同，表明铬物种在激活氧气分子中起着关键作用。

          对钾离子交换样品的应用也突出了表面化学对催化剂性能的影响，表明钾离子的存在可以修改相邻活性金属中心的氧离子的基本性，从而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

          [1] "Metallic chromium was discovered in 1933."
          [2] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has great industrial importance because it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes for the polymerization and other organic syntheses from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

          The development of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been significant since their discovery in 1933, particularly in their industrial importance for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. This process offers an alternative route for obtaining alkenes from inexpensive saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks, which are then used in polymerization and other organic syntheses.

          Chromium(III) ions are considered active sites in these catalysts, with oxide ions nearby potentially playing a supportive role. The system demonstrates high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation at temperatures ranging from 723 to 823 K.

          One major challenge in dehydrogenation processes is the formation of coke during the reaction in an inert atmosphere, which necessitates a regeneration process. Additionally, the endothermic nature of the process leads to high temperatures, posing further challenges.

          Under oxidative conditions, the catalyst shows stable activity at 673 K with negligible deactivation, highlighting its robustness in maintaining efficiency even in demanding environments.

          The activity of the catalyst varies depending on the specific composition, with the Ga/Cr 10/90 sample demonstrating the highest activity. Sometimes, VMgO compounds can achieve activity levels up to 1.8 μmol of propene per gram of catalyst per hour, typically operating at a higher temperature of 773 K.

          It is suggested that the rate-determining step in oxidative dehydrogenation might be controlled by the reaction rate of potassium-exchanged pillared solids and unexchanged homologues, implying a significant role of potassium ions in modifying the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展在工业应用上有着重要意义，尤其是对轻烷烃脱氢的过程。这一过程提供了一种从廉价饱和烃原料中获得烯烃的替代途径，随后用于聚合和其他有机合成。

          铬(III)离子被认为是这些催化剂中的活性位点，附近可能存在的氧化物离子起辅助作用。该系统在723至823 K的温度范围内显示出高活性和选择性，在丙烷脱氢过程中表现突出。

          脱氢过程的一个主要挑战是在惰性气氛下反应期间形成焦炭，这需要一个再生过程。此外，过程的吸热性质导致高温，进一步提出了挑战。

          在氧化条件下，催化剂在673 K的温度下显示出稳定的活性，几乎没有失活现象，表明即使在苛刻环境下也能保持高效。

          催化剂的活性取决于特定的组成，Ga/Cr 10/90样品显示出最高活性。有时，VMgO化合物可以达到每克催化剂每小时1.8 μmol的丙烯产率，通常在更高温度的773 K下操作。

          据推测，氧化脱氢过程的决定性步骤可能由钾离子交换的层状固体和未交换同系物的反应速率控制，暗示钾离子在调节催化剂活性和选择性方面起着重要作用。

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely utilized in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes since their discovery in 1933. These catalysts, when supported on various materials, demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane at temperatures between 723 and 823 K.

          A significant inconvenience in dehydrogenation processes in an inert atmosphere is the necessity of a regeneration step due to coke formation. Additionally, the endothermic nature of the process requires high temperatures, presenting further challenges.

          An alternative approach involves carrying out the catalytic process under oxidative conditions (ODH) with the presence of oxygen. This method still faces unresolved issues regarding the unknown reaction mechanism and the control of the high reactivity of the resulting products from the dehydrogenation process.

          The observed high activity of these catalysts is attributed to the presence of chromium(III) ions with coordination vacancies. In an inert atmosphere, these vacancies enable the activation of propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. Under oxidative conditions, the metal ion and oxygen form a labile coordination, which subsequently transfers to propane, yielding propene and water.

          The deactivation of catalysts used in dehydrogenation reactions is a controversial topic in the literature. Some researchers propose a correlation between deactivation and the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst, while others attribute this phenomenon to the appearance of chromium(II), which coincides with the formation and deposition of coke.

          In the structure of these catalysts, chromium(III) active sites are more accessible for propane oxidation compared to those found in chromium(III) oxide with a corindon-type structure, where vacancies are limited to the particle surface.

          The activity of these catalysts remains practically constant over extended periods, and the observed activity is closely related to the surface content of chromium.

          在惰性气氛下进行脱氢过程的一个主要不便之处是由于焦炭形成而必须进行的再生步骤。此外，过程的吸热性质需要高温，进一步提出了挑战。

          一种替代方法是在氧气存在的条件下，在氧化条件下（ODH）进行催化过程。这种方法仍然面临着未知反应机制和控制脱氢过程中产生的产物高度反应性的未解决问题。

          这些催化剂观察到的高活性归因于存在铬（Ⅲ）离子和配位空位。在惰性气氛中，这些空位使丙烷分子得到活化，从而形成丙烯和氢气。在氧化条件下，金属离子与氧形成不稳定配位，随后将其转移到丙烷，产生丙烯和水。

          催化剂在脱氢反应中的失活是一个在文献中引起争议的话题。一些研究人员提出失活与催化剂上沉积的焦炭量之间存在相关性，而其他研究人员将这一现象归咎于铬（Ⅱ）的出现，它同时伴随着焦炭的形成和沉积。

          在这些催化剂的结构中，铬（Ⅲ）活性位点对于丙烷氧化比那些在具有类柯林顿结构的铬（Ⅲ）氧化物中更容易接触，后者的空位仅限于粒子表面。

          这些催化剂的活性在长时间内保持基本不变，并且观察到的活性与表面铬含量密切相关。
