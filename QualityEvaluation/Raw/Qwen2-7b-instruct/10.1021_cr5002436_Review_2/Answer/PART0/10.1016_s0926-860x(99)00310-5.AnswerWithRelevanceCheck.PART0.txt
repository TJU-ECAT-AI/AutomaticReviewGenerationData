          Chromium oxide-based catalysts, especially those utilizing chromium on aluminum oxide support, have been extensively studied since their discovery in 1933. They are industrially significant due to their extensive use in producing propene and isobutene from their respective paraffins. The catalysts' performance is closely tied to the presence of redox-active Cr3+ sites on the surface of the CrOx/Al2O3 material. At lower loadings, chromium tends to anchor as Cr6+ species on the aluminum oxide support, while at higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation. Recent studies confirm that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction. These sites are capable of reducing Cr6+ to Cr3+ under specific conditions, such as in the presence of hydrogen, methane, or n-butane at 580°C. Alumina support stabilizes the Cr3+ species against reduction below the 3+ state, although there are reports of the formation of Cr2+ under certain conditions.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂，特别是利用铬在氧化铝支持上的催化剂，已经进行了广泛的研究。由于它们在从相应的烷烃生产丙烯和异丁烯方面的广泛应用，这些催化剂在工业上具有重要意义。催化剂的性能与CrOx/Al2O3材料表面的可还原Cr3+位点的存在密切相关。在较低负载下，铬倾向于作为Cr6+物种锚定在氧化铝支持上，而当负载较高时，催化剂也包含Cr3+，这种物种抵抗氧化。最近的研究证实，可逆或非可逆暴露的Cr3+位点在脱氢反应中作为活性位点发挥作用。在特定条件下，如氢、甲烷或n-丁烷存在下，这些位点能够将Cr6+还原为Cr3+。氧化铝支持物稳定了Cr3+物种，使其在低于3+状态时不进一步还原，尽管也有报道在某些条件下形成了Cr2+。

          The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been driven by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts are now widely used commercially to convert paraffins into propene and i-butene, demonstrating their significant role in dehydrogenation processes. The catalysts contain various chromium oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) depending on pretreatment, chromium concentration, and catalyst support material. At low loadings, chromium is anchored on aluminum oxide mainly as Cr6+ surface species. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation. The reduction of Cr6+ under dehydrogenation conditions or during pre-reduction of CrOx/Al2O3 leads to the formation of redox Cr3+ sites, which are considered active in the dehydrogenation reaction. Alumina supports seem to stabilize Cr3+ against reduction below the 3+ state, though some studies suggest the presence of Cr2+. The saturation reaction of chromium acetyl acetonate (Cr(acac)3) with aluminum oxide was explored in detail, utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to examine the surface chromium complex. Catalysts with a chromium loading up to 12.5 wt.% were prepared through atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and impregnation methods. These catalysts were evaluated for chromium oxidation state distribution, chromium oxide dispersion, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), solubility of Cr6+ surface species, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and infrared spectroscopy, as well as their activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展受到了对其结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制理解进步的推动。这些催化剂现在广泛应用于商业上将烷烃转化为丙烯和异丁烯，展示了它们在脱氢过程中的重要作用。根据预处理、铬浓度和催化剂支持材料的不同，催化剂含有不同的铬氧化态（6+、5+、3+和2+）。在较低负载下，铬主要以Cr6+表面物种的形式锚定在氧化铝上。在较高负载下，催化剂也包含Cr3+，这种物种抵抗氧化。在脱氢条件下或在预还原CrOx/Al2O3期间，Cr6+的还原导致形成可逆Cr3+位点，这些位点被认为是脱氢反应中的活性位点。氧化铝支持物似乎可以稳定Cr3+，防止其在低于3+状态时进一步还原，但有些研究也描述了Cr2+的存在。对于铬酸乙酰丙酮（Cr(acac)3）与氧化铝的饱和反应进行了详细研究，使用傅里叶变换红外（FT-IR）光谱法来检查表面铬复合物。通过原子层外延（ALE）和浸渍方法制备了最高含铬量为12.5 wt.%的催化剂。这些催化剂被评估了铬氧化态分布、铬氧化物分散、氢气温度程序化还原（H2-TPR）、Cr6+表面物种溶解度、X射线衍射（XRD）和红外光谱，以及它们在异丁烷脱氢作用的活性。
