Chromium(III) species, often in coordination vacancies, are crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane, yielding propene and hydrogen under non-oxidative conditions, or propene and oxygen under oxidative conditions.\n\n          - **Support Materials**: Supports like zirconium phosphate provide a porous structure, enabling better mechanical strength, thermal stability, and large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active chromium species and enhances reactivity.\n\n          - **Promoters**: In the context of this study, gallium (Ga) is introduced as a promoter.

These structures allow for dispersion of active chromium species, enhancing the accessibility of reactants to active sites.\n\n          - **Active Sites**: Active sites are typically associated with chromium species, especially chromium(III), which can participate in the activation of propane molecules. Chromium(III) species, often in coordination vacancies, are crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane, yielding propene and hydrogen under non-oxidative conditions, or propene and oxygen under oxidative conditions.\n\n          - **Support Materials**: Supports like zirconium phosphate provide a porous structure, enabling better mechanical strength, thermal stability, and large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active chromium species and enhances reactivity.\n\n          - **Promoters**: In the context of this study, gallium (Ga) is introduced as a promoter. The mixed Ga/Cr oxides enhance the catalytic activity, likely due to the enhanced dispersion of active sites and the creation of a more porous structure that facilitates the interaction of propane molecules with active sites.\n\n          - **Reaction Mechanisms**: Under oxidative conditions, chromium species can activate oxygen, leading to the production of water and propene. This mechanism is distinct from non-oxidative conditions, where chromium activates propane directly, producing propene and hydrogen.\n\n          - **Deactivation**: The deactivation of chromium oxide catalysts, particularly due to coke formation, is influenced by factors such as the dispersion and content of chromium. Higher amounts of chromium can lead to faster deactivation rates, highlighting the importance of optimizing chromium concentration for sustained activity.\n\n          Research in this field continues to explore the optimization of chromium oxide catalysts, focusing on improving selectivity, stability, and activity, particularly in the context of dehydrogenation processes.
