          - **Active Sites**: Active sites are typically associated with chromium species, especially chromium(III), which can participate in the activation of propane molecules. Chromium(III) species, often in coordination vacancies, are crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane, yielding propene and hydrogen under non-oxidative conditions, or propene and oxygen under oxidative conditions.

          - **Support Materials**: Supports like zirconium phosphate provide a porous structure, enabling better mechanical strength, thermal stability, and large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active chromium species and enhances reactivity.

          - **Promoters**: In the context of this study, gallium (Ga) is introduced as a promoter. The mixed Ga/Cr oxides enhance the catalytic activity, likely due to the enhanced dispersion of active sites and the creation of a more porous structure that facilitates the interaction of propane molecules with active sites.

          - **Reaction Mechanisms**: Under oxidative conditions, chromium species can activate oxygen, leading to the production of water and propene. This mechanism is distinct from non-oxidative conditions, where chromium activates propane directly, producing propene and hydrogen.

          - **Deactivation**: The deactivation of chromium oxide catalysts, particularly due to coke formation, is influenced by factors such as the dispersion and content of chromium. Higher amounts of chromium can lead to faster deactivation rates, highlighting the importance of optimizing chromium concentration for sustained activity.

          - **Active Sites**: Active sites are typically associated with chromium species, especially chromium(III), which can participate in the activation of propane molecules. Chromium(III) species, often in coordination vacancies, are crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane, yielding propene and hydrogen under non-oxidative conditions, or propene and oxygen under oxidative conditions.

          - **Support Materials**: Supports like zirconium phosphate provide a porous structure, enabling better mechanical strength, thermal stability, and large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active chromium species and enhances reactivity.

          - **Promoters**: In the context of this study, gallium (Ga) is introduced as a promoter. The mixed Ga/Cr oxides enhance the catalytic activity, likely due to the enhanced dispersion of active sites and the creation of a more porous structure that facilitates the interaction of propane molecules with active sites.

          - **Reaction Mechanisms**: Under oxidative conditions, chromium species can activate oxygen, leading to the production of water and propene. This mechanism is distinct from non-oxidative conditions, where chromium activates propane directly, producing propene and hydrogen.

          - **Deactivation**: The deactivation of chromium oxide catalysts, particularly due to coke formation, is influenced by factors such as the dispersion and content of chromium. Higher amounts of chromium can lead to faster deactivation rates, highlighting the importance of optimizing chromium concentration for sustained activity.

The higher surface density of vanadia species leads to an increased number of catalytic active sites, thereby reducing unwanted side reactions from exposed oxide support sites. Comparative studies between molecular structure and reactivity/selectivity information offer insights into the properties of surface vanadia species. These catalysts exhibit unique characteristics among supported metal oxide catalysts, with bulk vanadia having a weaker acidic nature compared to other transition metal oxides, which may minimize unwanted side reactions.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts, especially those utilizing chromium on aluminum oxide support, have been extensively studied since their discovery in 1933. They are industrially significant due to their extensive use in producing propene and isobutene from their respective paraffins. The catalysts' performance is closely tied to the presence of redox-active Cr3+ sites on the surface of the CrOx/Al2O3 material. At lower loadings, chromium tends to anchor as Cr6+ species on the aluminum oxide support, while at higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation. Recent studies confirm that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction. These sites are capable of reducing Cr6+ to Cr3+ under specific conditions, such as in the presence of hydrogen, methane, or n-butane at 580Â°C.

Chromium(III) species, often in coordination vacancies, are crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane, yielding propene and hydrogen under non-oxidative conditions, or propene and oxygen under oxidative conditions.

          - **Support Materials**: Supports like zirconium phosphate provide a porous structure, enabling better mechanical strength, thermal stability, and large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active chromium species and enhances reactivity.

          - **Promoters**: In the context of this study, gallium (Ga) is introduced as a promoter. The mixed Ga/Cr oxides enhance the catalytic activity, likely due to the enhanced dispersion of active sites and the creation of a more porous structure that facilitates the interaction of propane molecules with active sites.

          - **Reaction Mechanisms**: Under oxidative conditions, chromium species can activate oxygen, leading to the production of water and propene. This mechanism is distinct from non-oxidative conditions, where chromium activates propane directly, producing propene and hydrogen.

          - **Deactivation**: The deactivation of chromium oxide catalysts, particularly due to coke formation, is influenced by factors such as the dispersion and content of chromium. Higher amounts of chromium can lead to faster deactivation rates, highlighting the importance of optimizing chromium concentration for sustained activity.
