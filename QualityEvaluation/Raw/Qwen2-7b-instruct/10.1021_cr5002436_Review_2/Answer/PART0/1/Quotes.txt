          [3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant, and utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane [11-13] and oxidative coupling of methane [14], has been reported."
          [4] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [15-25]. However, the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction are still under discussion."

[1] "The vast majority of the catalysts suggested for FTO contain iron. In comparison to cobalt, iron is less expensive, it has a lower activity, Fe FischerTropsch products have a higher olefin content, as iron is less reactive to secondary hydrogenation reactions, and it displays lower methane selectivity at the high temperatures necessary to drive alpha to lower values."
          [2] "Another strategy used by several researchers to improve the catalytic performance of catalysts for the direct production of lower olefins from synthesis gas is the use of Fe-based bimetallic catalysts."

          [5] "Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."
          [6] "In the case of the system CrOx/ZrO2 reported by De Rossi et al.,4 the initial activity found for propene was only 0.68 μmol·g-1·s-1, working at the same reaction temperature."
          [7] "The deactivation rate and the amount of coke formed are a function of the chromium dispersion and content, the deactivation rate being higher at higher amounts of Cr2O3 deposited on alumina."
          [8] "That means, according to De Rossi et al.,4 that oxygen ions located on pillars and zirconium phosphate layers, neighbors to metallic ions, are involved in the DH of propane."
          [9] "When comparing DH and ODH data, some interesting points must be noticed: The activity in the conversion of propane to propene is much higher using the oxidative method, the last reaction being at a lower temperature, 673 K."
          [10] "A VAPO-5 has been prepared as described by Concepcion et al.13 for a comparative study and tested under the same conditions as the pillared Ga/Cr solids.

          [9] "The increase in the catalystic activity due to the presence of increasing amounts of chromium oxide could also be attributed to a possible increase in the specific surface area of the treated catalysts."

[1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2]."
          [2] "Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [3-9], or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [10], however, the use of oxygen as an oxidant is frequently accompanied by deep oxidation, resulting in a decrease in product selectivity."
          [3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant, and utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane [11-13] and oxidative coupling of methane [14], has been reported."
          [4] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [15-25]. However, the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction are still under discussion."
          [5] "In this study, we investigated (1) the kinetic analysis for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, and (2) the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species in order to reveal the role of CO2 and the reaction mechanism."

          [7] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromium-silica interaction."
          [8] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate."
          [9] "The formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
          [10] "The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
          [11] "Moreover, crystalline α-Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst."
          [12] "The above general description concerning Cr/SiO2 systems indicates that for obtaining a high activity, a high dispersion of Cr species has to be achieved."

[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."
          [2] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]."
          [3] "The most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,14]."
          [4] "CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts with Cr loading up to 12.5 wt.% Cr (10 cycles) have been prepared."
          [5] "In our work [21],we showed that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ by hydrogen,methane, or n-butane at 580C [21], and in accordance with others [7,8,10,14], we proposed that the redox Cr3+ sites are active in dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Al2O3 support appears to stabilize Cr3+ against reduction below the 3+ state [1,15], although some papers also describe the formation of Cr2+[1620]."
