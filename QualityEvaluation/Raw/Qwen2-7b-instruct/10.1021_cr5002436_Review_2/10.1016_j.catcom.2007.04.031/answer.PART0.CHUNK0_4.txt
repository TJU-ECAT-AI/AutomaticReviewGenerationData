<p>Production of light alkenes from C2C4 saturated hydrocarbon feedstock via dehydrogenation reaction is of high practical importance [1]. The catalysts most frequently used in industry for this reaction are alumina-supported chromia [2,3]. The oxides of molybdenum, vanadium and some other metals on high surface area supports were also reported as catalysts for this reaction [4-8]. Recently, we have observed that non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene could be effectively performed over various transition metal catalysts supported on MgAl mixed oxide [9].</p>
<p>The catalysts were prepared from layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors synthesized by conventional coprecipitation of metal cations under basic conditions [10,11]. It was found that among all tested catalysts the chromium-containing material demonstrated the most attractive catalytic behavior showing ethane conversion markedly higher than with other catalysts, considerably high selectivity to ethylene, and low coking ability.</p>

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely utilized in dehydrogenation processes, especially for converting C2-C4 saturated hydrocarbons into alkenes. These catalysts, often supported on alumina or other high surface area supports, have shown high efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.
