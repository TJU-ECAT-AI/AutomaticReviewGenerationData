[1] "Production of light alkenes from C2C4 saturated hydrocarbon feedstock via dehydrogenation reaction is of high practical importance [1]."
[2] "The catalysts most fre- quently used in industry for this reaction are alumina- supported chromia [2,3]."
[3] "Recently, we have observed that non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene could be effec- tively performed over various transition metal catalysts supported on MgAl mixed oxide [9]."
[4] "It was found that among all tested catalysts the chromium-containing material demonstrated the most attractive catalytic behavior showing ethane conversion markedly higher than with other catalysts, considerably high selectivity to ethylene,and low coking ability."
[5] "The results obtained with the catalyst derived from the CrO2 4 -containing LDH (i.e.,[C-1]Cr/MgAlOX) appeared also attractive, as 27% conversion of ethane and almost 74% selectivity to ethylene were attained with that catalyst."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include the production of light alkenes through dehydrogenation reactions. Traditionally, alumina-supported chromium oxide (chromia) has been widely used. However, recent research has focused on optimizing catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. Chromium-containing materials have shown superior catalytic behavior, with notable increases in ethane conversion, selectivity to ethylene, and low coking ability. Specifically, chromium oxide catalysts derived from layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have demonstrated attractive catalytic performance, achieving 27% ethane conversion and 74% selectivity to ethylene with a catalyst prepared from LDH containing CrO4 ions.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展经历了结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制理解的进步。关键工业应用包括通过脱氢反应生产轻烯烃。传统上，铝酸盐支持的铬氧化物（铬化物）被广泛使用。然而，近年来的研究重点是优化非氧化脱氢乙烷至乙烯的催化剂。含有铬的材料在催化性能方面表现出色，显著提高了乙烷转化率、乙二醇选择性和低结焦能力。具体而言，从层状双氢氧化物（LDH）前体制备的铬氧化物催化剂显示出吸引人的催化性能，实现了用含CrO4离子的LDH制备的催化剂27%的乙烷转化率和74%的乙二醇选择性。
