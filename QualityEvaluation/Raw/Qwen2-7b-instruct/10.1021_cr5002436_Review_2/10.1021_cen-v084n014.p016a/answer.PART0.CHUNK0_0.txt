Numerical methods are being developed to solve the atomic structures of materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles and nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, without relying on traditional crystallography techniques. These methods utilize data from X-ray and neutron diffraction studies of powders and noncrystalline samples, specifically atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), to construct structures of aperiodic materials. An example of this application is the determination of the structure of C60 buckyballs using PDF data from neutron scattering on a solid-phase sample.

对于缺乏长程有序的材料，如纳米粒子和半导体纳米块，正在开发数值方法来解决其原子结构，而无需依赖传统的晶体学技术。这些方法利用粉末和非晶样品的X射线和中子衍射研究数据，特别是原子对分布函数（PDF），来构建无序材料的结构。这种方法的一个应用是使用中子散射在固体样品上的Buckyball上获得的PDF数据确定C60的结构。
