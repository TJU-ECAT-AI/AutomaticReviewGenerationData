Numerical methods have been developed to solve the atomic structures of aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles and materials lacking long-range order, using data from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and noncrystalline samples. The data used in this process are called atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), which consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram indicating the frequency of specific spacings. This computational technique, named Liga, was successfully applied to determine the structure of C60 buckyballs, showing close agreement with experimental data despite minor deviations attributed to data noise and experimental constraints.

已经开发出了数值方法来确定无序材料（如纳米颗粒和缺乏长程有序的材料）的原子结构，这些方法使用粉末和非晶态样品的X射线和中子衍射研究数据。这些用于此过程的数据称为原子对分布函数（PDFs），包括原子间距离列表和表示特定距离频率的直方图。这种计算技术，名为Liga，成功应用于确定Buckyball C60的结构，实验数据与计算结果非常接近，尽管存在轻微偏差，这是由于数据噪声和实验限制造成的。
