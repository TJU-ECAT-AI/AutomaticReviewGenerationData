[1] "Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography."
[2] "A new computational method,though, is poised to help with the problem. Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[3] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[4] "Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs."
[5] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."

Numerical methods are being developed to solve the structures of materials without relying on traditional crystallography techniques, particularly for nanoparticles and other aperiodic materials. These methods utilize data from X-ray and neutron diffraction studies, focusing on atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs). An innovative computational technique, named the Liga method, was applied to determine the structure of buckminsterfullerene (C60) by comparing theoretical cluster structures with experimental PDF data. While the calculated data closely matched the experimental measurements, slight deviations from the ideal C60 structure were noted, attributed to noise in the data and experimental limitations.

正在开发数值方法来解决没有依赖传统晶体学技术的材料结构问题，特别是对于纳米粒子和其他无长期有序的材料。这些方法利用X射线和中子衍射研究的数据，专注于原子对分布函数（PDF）。一种创新的计算技术，命名为Liga方法，被应用于通过比较理论簇结构与实验PDF数据，确定buckminsterfullerene（C60）的结构。虽然计算数据与实验测量结果高度吻合，但计算结构与理想C60结构略有偏差，这归因于数据噪声和实验限制。
