The numerical method developed by researchers enables the determination of atomic structures for aperiodic materials, utilizing atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) obtained from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. These functions provide lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram indicating the frequency of specific spacings between atoms. Despite slight deviations from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise and experimental constraints, the calculated data closely aligns with experimental measurements.

研究人员开发的数值方法允许确定非周期性材料的原子结构，利用从X射线和中子衍射研究中获得的原子配对分布函数（PDF）。这些函数提供了原子间距的列表以及表示特定间距之间原子对频率的直方图。尽管与理想结构的C60存在轻微偏差，主要是由于噪声和实验限制，但计算数据与实验测量结果非常接近。
