Numerical methods are being developed to solve the atomic structures of materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles and nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, without relying on traditional crystallography techniques. These methods utilize data from X-ray and neutron diffraction studies of powders and noncrystalline samples, specifically atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), to construct structures of aperiodic materials. An example of this application is the determination of the structure of C60 buckyballs using PDF data from neutron scattering on a solid-phase sample.

Numerical methods have been developed to solve the atomic structures of aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles and materials lacking long-range order, using data from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and noncrystalline samples. The data used in this process are called atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), which consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram indicating the frequency of specific spacings. This computational technique, named Liga, was successfully applied to determine the structure of C60 buckyballs, showing close agreement with experimental data despite minor deviations attributed to data noise and experimental constraints.

Numerical methods are being developed to solve the structures of materials without relying on traditional crystallography techniques, particularly for nanoparticles and other aperiodic materials. These methods utilize data from X-ray and neutron diffraction studies, focusing on atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs). An innovative computational technique, named the Liga method, was applied to determine the structure of buckminsterfullerene (C60) by comparing theoretical cluster structures with experimental PDF data. While the calculated data closely matched the experimental measurements, slight deviations from the ideal C60 structure were noted, attributed to noise in the data and experimental limitations.
