[1] "Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography."
[2] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[3] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[4] "Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs."
[5] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."
[6] "Aperiodic materials are among the technologically most interesting nanoscale materials currently under study. The new approach to solving these materials' structures could be widely applicable."

Numerical methods have been developed to solve the structures of materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles and semiconductors, without relying on traditional crystallography techniques. These methods utilize data from X-ray and neutron diffraction studies of non-crystalline samples, specifically atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), to construct structures atom by atom. An algorithm called the Liga method was employed to determine the structure of C60 buckyballs, matching the experimental data closely while acknowledging slight deviations due to data noise and experimental constraints. This computational approach is expected to be broadly applicable to the study of aperiodic nanoscale materials, offering a significant advancement in understanding and utilizing these complex structures.

数值方法已被开发用于解决缺乏长程有序的材料，如纳米颗粒和半导体的结构，而无需依赖传统的晶体学技术。这些方法利用非晶样品的X射线和中子衍射研究数据，特别是原子对分布函数（PDF），以逐个原子构建结构。Liga方法被用来确定C60巴基球的结构，其实验数据匹配得非常接近，但计算结构与理想结构略有偏差，这是由于数据噪声和实验限制所致。这种计算方法有望广泛应用于研究无序纳米尺度材料，为理解并利用这些复杂结构提供重大进展。
