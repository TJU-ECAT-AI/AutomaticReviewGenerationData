[1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene,propene,and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes."
[2] "Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[3] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts."
[4] "However, the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction are still under discussion."
[5] "We investigated (1) the kinetic analysis for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, and (2) the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species in order to reveal the role of CO2 and the reaction mechanism."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been utilized industrially for the production of lower alkenes through the dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes. They have also been studied for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and the use of CO2 as an enhancer in the dehydrogenation process, although the exact role of CO2 and the reaction mechanism remain subjects of ongoing research.

2. This study aimed to analyze the kinetic aspects of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, as well as to understand the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species to elucidate the role of CO2 and the reaction mechanism.

1. 自从1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂在工业上被用于通过烷烃脱氢生产低级烯烃。它们还被研究用于低级烷烃的氧化脱氢以及二氧化碳作为增强剂在脱氢过程中的作用，尽管CO2的作用和反应机制仍然是研究讨论的话题。

2. 此次研究旨在分析丙烷在含有CO2的Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂上的脱氢动力学，并了解铬氧化物物种的动态行为，以揭示CO2的作用和反应机制。
