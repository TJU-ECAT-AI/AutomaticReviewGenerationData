Catalytic conversions of alkanes into the corresponding alkenes are of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes.
Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene,propene,and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2].
Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation,because CO2 can also act as a mild oxi- dant,and utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions,such as CO2 reforming of methane [1113] and oxida- tive coupling of methane [14],has been reported.

1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly due to their increasing importance in alkane-to-alkene conversions driven by the rising demand for alkenes. They have been industrially utilized for producing lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene via dehydrogenation. Recently, CO2 has gained attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, acting as a mild oxidant and being used in partial oxidation reactions like CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane.

1. 自1933年发现以来，由于烷烃转化为烯烃的需求增加，铬氧化物基催化剂已经经历了显著的发展。它们被工业上用来通过脱氢生产诸如乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯等低碳烯烃。近年来，二氧化碳作为脱氢反应的共供气体受到了关注，它能作为温和的氧化剂，并在甲烷的部分氧化反应中被利用，如二氧化碳重整甲烷和甲烷的氧化耦合。
