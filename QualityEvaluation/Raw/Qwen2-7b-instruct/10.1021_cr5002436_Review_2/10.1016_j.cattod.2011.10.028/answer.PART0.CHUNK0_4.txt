"Catalytic conversions of alkanes into the corresponding alkenes are of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes."
"The dehydrogenation of alkanes is endothermic and inevitably controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium, requiring substantial energy consumption."
"Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes."
"Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
"Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant, and utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane [1113] and oxidative coupling of methane [14], has been reported."
"In this study, we investigated (1) the kinetic analysis for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, and (2) the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species in order to reveal the role of CO2 and the reaction mechanism."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has seen significant advancements in their industrial applications and research focus areas. These advancements are primarily centered around improving the structure, identifying and enhancing active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating detailed reaction mechanisms. Chromium oxides have been notably utilized for the dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce alkenes, with silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides being industrially employed for the production of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene. 

Research efforts have also focused on the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and the utilization of CO2 as a mild oxidant, which can enhance the dehydrogenation process. This interest in CO2 is partly due to its potential as a sustainable feedstock for chemical synthesis. The role of CO2 in these processes is still under investigation, and studies have explored the kinetic analysis of dehydrogenation reactions, the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species, and the mechanisms underlying these reactions, particularly in the presence of CO2. This includes understanding how CO2 interacts with chromium oxide species, affects the redox cycles between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4, and influences the overall catalytic activity and product selectivity.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展在工业应用和研究重点领域取得了显著进步。这些进展主要集中在改进结构、识别并增强活性位点、选择合适的支撑材料、引入促进剂以及阐明详细的反应机制上。铬氧化物被广泛应用于烷烃脱氢生成烯烃，硅酸盐和铝酸盐支持的铬氧化物被工业上用于生产如乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯等低级烯烃。

研究工作还集中在对低级烷烃的氧化脱氢以及二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂的利用，这可以增强脱氢过程。对二氧化碳的兴趣部分源于其作为化学合成可持续原料的潜力。在二氧化碳作用下的作用机理仍需深入研究，包括探索脱氢反应的动力学分析、铬氧化物物种的动态行为以及这些反应的机制，特别是二氧化碳与铬氧化物物种的相互作用、影响Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4的氧化还原循环以及总体催化活性和产物选择性的变化情况。
