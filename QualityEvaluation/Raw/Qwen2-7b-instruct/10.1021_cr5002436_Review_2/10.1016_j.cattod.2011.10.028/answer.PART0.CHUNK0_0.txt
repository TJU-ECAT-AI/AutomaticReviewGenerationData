[1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2]."
[2] "Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [3-9], or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [10], however, the use of oxygen as an oxidant is frequently accompanied by deep oxidation, resulting in a decrease in product selectivity."
[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant, and utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane [11-13] and oxidative coupling of methane [14], has been reported."
[4] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [15-25]. However, the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction are still under discussion."
[5] "In this study, we investigated (1) the kinetic analysis for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, and (2) the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species in order to reveal the role of CO2 and the reaction mechanism."

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in their industrial applications and research focus areas. These catalysts are primarily utilized for the production of lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes. They have also been explored for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and for the oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen. However, the use of oxygen often leads to deep oxidation, decreasing product selectivity. Recently, CO2 has gained attention as a co-feed gas in dehydrogenation processes due to its ability to act as a mild oxidant. The study of chromium oxide species' dynamics and their interaction with CO2 has been crucial in understanding the role of CO2 in these reactions and the underlying mechanisms.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的发展，特别是在其工业应用和研究重点领域的演变。这些催化剂主要应用于通过烷烃的脱氢生产低级烯烃，如乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯。它们还被探索用于低级烷烃的氧化脱氢以及与其他有机化合物的氧氧化。然而，氧气的使用通常会导致深度氧化，降低产物的选择性。近年来，二氧化碳因其作为温和氧化剂的作用而受到广泛关注，作为脱氢过程中的共供气体，在某些部分氧化反应中已被报道利用二氧化碳。研究铬氧化物物种的动态行为及其与二氧化碳的相互作用对于揭示二氧化碳在这些反应中的作用和反应机制至关重要。
