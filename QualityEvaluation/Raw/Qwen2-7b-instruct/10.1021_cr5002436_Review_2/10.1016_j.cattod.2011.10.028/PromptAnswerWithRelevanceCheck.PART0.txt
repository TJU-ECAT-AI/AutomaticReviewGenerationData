[1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2]."
[2] "Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [3-9], or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [10], however, the use of oxygen as an oxidant is frequently accompanied by deep oxidation, resulting in a decrease in product selectivity."
[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant, and utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane [11-13] and oxidative coupling of methane [14], has been reported."
[4] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [15-25]. However, the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction are still under discussion."
[5] "In this study, we investigated (1) the kinetic analysis for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, and (2) the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species in order to reveal the role of CO2 and the reaction mechanism."

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in their industrial applications and research focus areas. These catalysts are primarily utilized for the production of lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes. They have also been explored for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and for the oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen. However, the use of oxygen often leads to deep oxidation, decreasing product selectivity. Recently, CO2 has gained attention as a co-feed gas in dehydrogenation processes due to its ability to act as a mild oxidant. The study of chromium oxide species' dynamics and their interaction with CO2 has been crucial in understanding the role of CO2 in these reactions and the underlying mechanisms.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has seen significant advancements in their industrial applications and research focus areas. These advancements are primarily centered around improving the structure, identifying and enhancing active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating detailed reaction mechanisms. Chromium oxides have been notably utilized for the dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce alkenes, with silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides being industrially employed for the production of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene. 

Research efforts have also focused on the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and the utilization of CO2 as a mild oxidant, which can enhance the dehydrogenation process. This interest in CO2 is partly due to its potential as a sustainable feedstock for chemical synthesis. The role of CO2 in these processes is still under investigation, and studies have explored the kinetic analysis of dehydrogenation reactions, the dynamic behavior of chromium oxide species, and the mechanisms underlying these reactions, particularly in the presence of CO2. This includes understanding how CO2 interacts with chromium oxide species, affects the redox cycles between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4, and influences the overall catalytic activity and product selectivity.
