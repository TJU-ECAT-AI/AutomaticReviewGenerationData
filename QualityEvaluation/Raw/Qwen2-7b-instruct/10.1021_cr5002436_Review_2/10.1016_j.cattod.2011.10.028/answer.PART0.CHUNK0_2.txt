[1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2]."
[2] "Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [3-9], or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [10], however, the use of oxygen as an oxidant is frequently accompanied by deep oxidation, resulting in a decrease in product selectivity."
[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant, and utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane [11-13] and oxidative coupling of methane [14], has been reported."
[4] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [15-25]. However, the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction are still under discussion."

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in industrial applications, particularly in the production of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through dehydrogenation processes. These catalysts are also being investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and the oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen. However, the use of oxygen often leads to deep oxidation, reducing product selectivity. More recently, carbon dioxide has gained attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation due to its ability to act as a mild oxidant. Its use in partial oxidation reactions, like CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane, has been reported. Despite these advancements, the role of carbon dioxide in dehydrogenation and the underlying reaction mechanisms are still subjects of ongoing research.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂在工业应用中经历了显著的发展，特别是在通过脱氢过程生产低烯烃（如乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯）方面。这些催化剂还被研究用于低烷烃的氧化脱氢和与其他有机化合物的氧气氧化。然而，氧气的使用通常会导致深度氧化，降低产物选择性。最近，二氧化碳因其作为温和氧化剂的能力而受到关注，作为脱氢反应的共供气。它在甲烷部分氧化反应中的应用，如二氧化碳重整甲烷和甲烷氧化耦合，已被报道。尽管取得了这些进展，二氧化碳在脱氢中的作用以及这一反应机制仍然是当前研究的重点。
