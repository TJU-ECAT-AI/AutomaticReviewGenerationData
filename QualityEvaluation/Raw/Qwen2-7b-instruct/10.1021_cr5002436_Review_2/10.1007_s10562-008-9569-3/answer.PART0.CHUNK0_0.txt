<p>Chromium oxide supported on SBA-15 was modified with Ce species by an incipient method. The effect of Ce on the activity of Cr/SBA-15 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 was investigated.</p>

<p>The cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species can be carried out viaing the dehydrogenation of ethane and oxidation of CO2 processes.</p>
<p>In the present work, a series of catalysts using Cr as activity species, based on SBA-15 as the support and CeO2 as the promoter, were prepared by the impregnation method, and their catalytic activity for ODH of ethane with CO2 were investigated.</p>

<p>The overall amount of chromium detected and the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio at the catalyst surface increases gradually with higher Ce loading from 0 to 10%.</p>
<p>The H2 consumption of the peaks corresponds to the amount of Cr6+ species on Cr-based catalyst.</p>
<p>The TOF values of 5.0Cr10Ce/SBA-15 are higher than the other catalysts in the range of measured temperatures, suggesting that active Cr sites in 5.0Cr10Ce/SBA-15 is more effective to build ethylene molecules.</p>

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933, focusing on structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include petrochemical processes like cracking, reforming, and isomerization.

2. Research focuses on understanding how structure, active sites, support materials, and promoters affect catalyst performance. The structure of chromium oxide catalysts typically involves chromium oxide particles dispersed on a support material, often with specific shapes like nanoparticles or layers.

3. Active sites are crucial for the catalyst's performance, with chromium ions in various oxidation states, such as Cr6+ and Cr3+, playing significant roles in dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Support materials like SBA-15 provide ordered structures and high surface areas, improving the dispersion of chromium species and enhancing catalytic activity. Promoters like cerium oxide (CeO2) improve dispersion and redox properties.

5. Reaction mechanisms involve redox cycles between chromium species and reactants like ethane and carbon dioxide. Oxygen species generated by promoters facilitate the reaction.

6. In dehydrogenation processes, chromium species are reduced to less active forms by the reaction, but can be reoxidized by the same reactants, creating a dynamic redox cycle that contributes to the catalyst's efficiency.

7. The addition of cerium oxide to chromium oxide catalysts improves dispersion, redox properties, and overall catalytic activity, particularly in reactions involving carbon dioxide.

8. Thermal stability and dispersion of active metals are crucial factors in catalyst stability and longevity during reactions.

9. Changes in the interaction between chromium species and support materials during reaction and regeneration treatments can impact catalyst performance and longevity.
