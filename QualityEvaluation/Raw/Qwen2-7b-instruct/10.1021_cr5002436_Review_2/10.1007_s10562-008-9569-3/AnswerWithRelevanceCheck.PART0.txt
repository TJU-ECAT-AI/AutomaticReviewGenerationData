          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have played a significant role in various chemical reactions, particularly in the petrochemical industry since their discovery in 1933. Their key applications include refining crude oil, petrochemical synthesis, and fuel and plastic production. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst structures, identifying active sites (typically chromium species), selecting support materials like SBA-15, utilizing promoters such as cerium, and exploring reaction mechanisms. The structure of catalysts, which involves the arrangement and dispersion of active components, is essential for enhancing their performance. Support materials stabilize the catalysts, impacting their efficiency, while promoters like cerium improve catalytic activity. Reaction mechanisms often involve the reduction of chromium species to enable the dehydrogenation of alkanes, with carbon dioxide acting as an oxidant.

          [1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene by O2 was an important process as an alternation to thermal cracking of ethane."
          [2] "Carbon dioxide is a promising oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane."
          [3] "The activity is enhanced for Ce modified Cr/SBA-15 catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2."
          [4] "The addition of Ce species markedly improves the dispersion of the chromium species in the 5CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts."
          [5] "The high-angle XRD results suggest that the addition of Ce species obviously improves the Cr species dispersion in the CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts."
          [6] "The low-angle XRD and N2 sorption isotherms results indicate that the well-defined hexagonally ordered structure of the catalysts was not destroyed during the preparation process."
          [7] "TPR results indicate the Cr species in Cr/SBA-15 and 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts existed with Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, and the Cr6+ species play an important role in the ODH of ethane with CO2."
          [8] "The addition of Ce species to Cr/SBA-15 catalysts remarkably changes the redox properties and enhances the catalytic activity of Cr species in the 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts."
          [9] "In the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction, the Cr6+ species as the active phase is reduced to Cr3+ as a less active species by the dehydrogenated process, simultaneously, the reduced Cr3+ species can be reoxidized to Cr6+ species by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species play an important role in the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction over the catalysts."

          Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene using oxygen was an important process as an alternative to thermal cracking of ethane. Carbon dioxide is a promising oxidant for ethane dehydrogenation. The activity of the Ce-modified Cr/SBA-15 catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 is enhanced. The addition of cerium species significantly improves the dispersion of chromium species in 5CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. High-angle XRD results indicate that the addition of cerium species clearly improves the dispersion of chromium species in CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. Low-angle XRD and nitrogen adsorption isotherm results show that the well-defined hexagonally ordered structure of the catalysts was not disrupted during preparation. TPR results show that chromium species in Cr/SBA-15 and 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts exist as Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, with Cr6+ playing a crucial role in ODH of ethane with CO2. The addition of cerium species to Cr/SBA-15 catalysts dramatically alters redox properties and enhances the catalytic activity of chromium species in 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. In the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction, the Cr6+ species as the active phase is reduced to less active Cr3+ species by the dehydrogenation process. Simultaneously, reduced Cr3+ species can be reoxidized to Cr6+ species by CO2, making the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species important for the ODH of ethane with CO2 over catalysts.

          通过氧气进行的乙烷脱氢至乙烯的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个重要的过程，作为热裂解乙烷的替代方法。二氧化碳是用于乙烷脱氢的有前景的氧化剂。通过二氧化碳进行的乙烷脱氢，Ce改性的Cr/SBA-15催化剂的活性得到增强。向5CrCe/SBA-15催化剂中添加铈物种显著提高了铬物种的分散度。高角度XRD结果表明，铈物种的添加明显改善了CrCe/SBA-15催化剂中铬物种的分散度。低角度XRD和氮吸附等温线结果显示，在准备过程中，催化剂的定义良好的六角有序结构未被破坏。TPR结果显示，Cr/SBA-15和5.0CrCe/SBA-15催化剂中的铬物种以Cr6+和Cr3+形式存在，Cr6+在CO2与乙烷脱氢反应中起着重要作用。向Cr/SBA-15催化剂中添加铈物种显著改变了还原-氧化性质，并增强了5.0CrCe/SBA-15催化剂中铬物种的催化活性。在CO2与乙烷脱氢反应中，作为活性相的Cr6+物种通过脱氢过程被还原为活性较低的Cr3+物种。同时，还原的Cr3+物种可以通过CO2重新氧化为Cr6+物种，因此Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的还原-氧化循环在CO2与乙烷脱氢反应中催化剂上起着重要作用。
