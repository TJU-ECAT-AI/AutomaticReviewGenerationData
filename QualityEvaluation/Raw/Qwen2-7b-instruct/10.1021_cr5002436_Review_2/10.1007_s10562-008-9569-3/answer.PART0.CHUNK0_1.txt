<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene by O2 was an important process as an alternation to thermal cracking of ethane.</p>
<p>However, the challenge of this reaction was to avoid over-oxidation in order to obtain high selectivity towards ethylene.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide has received much attention.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is a promising oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane.</p>
<p>The activity is enhanced for Ce modified Cr/SBA-15 catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2.</p>
<p>Many research results showed the supported Cr-based catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the ODH reaction.</p>
<p>An important property of ceria is the oxygen storage capacity (OSC), i.e. the ability to adsorb and release oxygen under oxidizing and reducing conditions.</p>
<p>SBA-15 has successfully been applied as a support for various catalytically active phases.</p>
<p>The influence of solvents on the formation of metal and its oxides nanoparticles in SBA-15 was also investigated.</p>
<p>However, there is little literature about the catalyst using SBA-15 as support for the ODH of ethane with CO2.</p>
<p>The main goal is to explore the CeO2 effect on the activity behavior of the catalysts for the ODH of ethane with CO2.</p>
<p>The formation rate (TOF) of ethylene is calculated using the ethylene yield data the turnover frequency, defined in terms of ethylene moles formation per chromium atom per unit time.</p>
<p>For the ODH of ethane over Cr-based catalyst, Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the ODH of ethane.</p>
<p>In our case, the above TPR and XPS results also indicate that the appropriate addition of Ce species can increase reducibility of chromium and the ratio of Cr6+/Cr3+ in the catalysts, which can well account for their different initial catalytic activities in the ODH of ethane.</p>
<p>For the ODH of ethane with CO2, considerable amounts of CO and H2O are formed during the reaction, demonstrating the occurrence of a reaction between CO2 and H2 (water gas shift reaction).</p>
<p>After the reaction for 5 h, the gas flow of the mixture of C2H6 and CO2 was replaced with a gas flow of CO2 at 30 mL/min to treat with the catalysts for 12 h.</p>
<p>It is noted the activity of 5Cr/SBA-15 and 5Cr10Ce/SBA-15 catalysts was recovered insufficiently.</p>
<p>The H2-TPR profiles of the 5Cr/SBA-15 and 5Cr10Ce/SBA-15 catalysts, including before and after reaction and after regeneration by CO2 are shown in Fig. 9.</p>
