[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene by O2 was an important process as an alternation to thermal cracking of ethane."
[2] "Carbon dioxide is a promising oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane."
[3] "The activity is enhanced for Ce modified Cr/SBA-15 catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2."
[4] "The addition of Ce species markedly improves the dispersion of the chromium species in the 5CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts."
[5] "The high-angle XRD results suggest that the addition of Ce species obviously improves the Cr species dispersion in the CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts."
[6] "The low-angle XRD and N2 sorption isotherms results indicate that the well-defined hexagonally ordered structure of the catalysts was not destroyed during the preparation process."
[7] "TPR results indicate the Cr species in Cr/SBA-15 and 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts existed with Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, and the Cr6+ species play an important role in the ODH of ethane with CO2."
[8] "The addition of Ce species to Cr/SBA-15 catalysts remarkably changes the redox properties and enhances the catalytic activity of Cr species in the 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts."
[9] "In the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction, the Cr6+ species as the active phase is reduced to Cr3+ as a less active species by the dehydrogenated process, simultaneously, the reduced Cr3+ species can be reoxidized to Cr6+ species by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species play an important role in the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction over the catalysts."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include dehydrogenation processes, particularly in converting lighter hydrocarbons to heavier ones. The focus areas of research have been:

1. **Structure**: The structure of chromium oxide catalysts has evolved to include the incorporation of different support materials such as mesoporous silica SBA-15, which enhances dispersion and stability of chromium species.

2. **Active Sites**: The importance of chromium species in different oxidation states (Cr6+ and Cr3+) for catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions has been highlighted. Redox cycles between these states play crucial roles in enhancing catalytic efficiency.

3. **Support Materials**: Materials like SBA-15 have been used to maintain the structure and functionality of chromium species, allowing for better control over the catalytic properties.

4. **Promoters**: Elements like cerium (Ce) have been introduced to improve dispersion and redox properties of chromium species, enhancing the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation processes.

5. **Reaction Mechanisms**: The mechanism of dehydrogenation, especially when involving carbon dioxide, has been explored, showing how chromium species interact with reactants and products in a cyclic manner, facilitated by promoters like cerium.

These advancements have contributed to the significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, leading to more efficient and selective conversion of hydrocarbons in industries like petrochemicals and refining.
