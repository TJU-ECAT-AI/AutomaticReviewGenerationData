[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers) (Tullo, 2003). Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[2] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
[3] "Especially, if the catalyst reaches a high temperature during coke combustion, this migration occurs more rapidly."
[4] "Raman spectroscopy is an excellent method to track the different types of coke as they are being deposited on the catalyst (Chua and Stair, 2003)."
[5] "In this study it will be shown how information gathered using UVVis and Raman spectroscopy can be linked to the observed catalytic activity for the propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "During the first 2 h of dehydrogenation there is a slow formation of coke on the catalyst, while at the same time the catalytic activity increases."
[7] "It should be noted that although after 2 h in Fig. 6A the rate at which the absorbance of the sample increases becomes higher, this does not mean that the actual coke formation rate also increases."
[8] "The possibility to track the coke content at the catalyst in a chemical reactor is highly attractive for the chemical industry. Using cheap and robust spectroscopic probes linked via optical fibers to a spectrometer, one can gain information on how changes or disturbances to a process affect the amount of coke produced."
[9] "Coke is a crucial parameter for the activity of the catalyst. A small amount of coke increases the activity, while it becomes a deactivating agent as the coke content increases."
[10] "These affordable and robust UV-Vis probes can give valuable insight in industrial processes where coke formation is an important parameter in the process."
