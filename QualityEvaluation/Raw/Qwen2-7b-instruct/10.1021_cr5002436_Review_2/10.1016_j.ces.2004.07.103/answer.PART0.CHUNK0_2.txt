1. Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in the realm of dehydrogenation processes. They have become critical in industries due to their ability to facilitate reactions efficiently. Research focuses on understanding the catalyst's structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These factors contribute to their significance in dehydrogenation processes by enhancing selectivity, improving yield, and extending catalyst life.

2. The key industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts include petrochemical production, specifically in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons like propane to produce propene. These catalysts are also utilized in the cracking of hydrocarbons to produce lighter olefins, essential components in various petrochemical products.

3. The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by advancements in understanding their structure-function relationships, which includes the identification of active sites, the role of support materials in stabilizing the catalyst, and the optimization of promoters to enhance catalytic activity. Reaction mechanisms have been studied to understand how these catalysts operate under various reaction conditions, leading to improvements in process efficiency and selectivity.

4. During the dehydrogenation cycle, the catalyst activity fluctuates due to the formation of coke on the catalyst surface and the reduction of chromium from hexavalent (Cr(VI)) to trivalent (Cr(III)). Coke formation reduces the activity of the catalyst, whereas the initial reduction enhances activity. The complex interplay between coke formation and catalyst reduction is crucial in maintaining optimal catalytic performance.

5. The absorbance at 1000 nm provides a measure of the overall darkening of the sample, which is indicative of the accumulation of coke on the catalyst. This measurement is a valuable tool for quantifying coke content and monitoring its impact on catalyst activity.

6. A small amount of coke on the catalyst surface can improve activity by facilitating the adsorption of propane onto the catalyst. This suggests that coke acts as an active site for the adsorption of reactants, potentially enhancing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. However, excessive coke buildup leads to a decrease in activity as it blocks access to the active sites, thus deactivating the catalyst.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，尤其是在脱氢反应领域。它们在工业中的应用主要集中在促进石油化学品生产，特别是通过脱氢过程将丙烷转化为丙烯。研究重点包括理解催化剂的结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制，这些因素共同决定了其在脱氢过程中的重要性。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂的关键工业应用包括石油化学产品的生产，尤其是通过脱氢过程将碳氢化合物（如丙烷）转化为轻质烯烃。此外，它们还用于裂解碳氢化合物以产生轻质烯烃，这些是各种石油化学品的基本成分。

3. 这些催化剂的演变受到对催化剂结构功能关系的深入了解的推动，包括识别活性位点、理解支持材料如何稳定催化剂以及优化促进剂以增强催化活性的研究。对反应机制的研究有助于理解在不同反应条件下催化剂的工作原理，从而提高过程效率和选择性。

4. 在脱氢周期中，催化剂活性的变化主要由催化剂表面的焦炭形成和六价铬（Cr(VI)）还原为三价铬（Cr(III)）这两个原因引起。焦炭的形成会降低催化剂的活性，而初期的还原则能提高活性。焦炭与催化剂还原之间的复杂相互作用对于维持最佳催化性能至关重要。

5. 在1000 nm处的吸光度提供了一种量化样本变暗程度的方法，这可以反映出催化剂上焦炭的积累情况。这一测量工具对于量化焦炭含量并监测其对催化剂活性的影响具有重要意义。

6. 催化剂表面少量的焦炭可以改善活性，因为它能够促进丙烷吸附到催化剂上。这表明焦炭作为吸附反应物的活性位点，可能提高了脱氢过程的效率。然而，过量的焦炭堆积导致活性位点被阻塞，从而降低了催化剂的活性。
