[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers) (Tullo, 2003). Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[2] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) (Bhasin et al., 2001)."
[3] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst."
[4] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."
[5] "Each reactor undergoes a cycle of typically 12 min of propane de- hydrogenation, 3 min purge/evacuation, 12 min of catalyst regeneration using air, 3 min of purge/evacuation optionally followed by a catalyst reduction."
[6] "The 5 reactors are switched in such a manner that the overall plant operates in a 5488"
[7] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
[8] "In the regeneration cycle the coke is combusted and the chromium is reoxidized."
[9] "Currently the cycle times for the Catofin process are fixed and based on past experience."
[10] "Spectroscopy is an excellent manner to track the state of the catalyst during the process."
[11] "A combination of UVVis and Raman spectroscopy to monitor the state of the catalyst during its lifetime would provide a much better insight in the catalyst health and allow making other choices based on this information to keep the process running most efficiently."
