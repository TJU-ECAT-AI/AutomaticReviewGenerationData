[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has in- creased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers) (Tullo, 2003)."
[2] "Currently the cycle times for the Catofin process are fixed and based on past experience."
[3] "Especially, if the catalyst reaches a high temperature during coke combustion, this migration occurs more rapidly."
[4] "This is a more direct approach than by monitoring the reactor performance."
[5] "Using cheap and robust spectroscopic probes linked via optical fibers to a spectrometer, one can gain information on how changes or disturbances to a process affect the amount of coke produced."

The demand for propene has grown considerably over the last decade, surpassing the supply from traditional methods like ethane steam crackers and FCCs. The cycle times for the Catofin process are set based on historical data. High temperatures during coke combustion lead to a faster migration of chromium. Monitoring the production of coke through spectroscopy offers a more direct insight compared to assessing reactor performance. Affordable and reliable UV-Vis probes connected via optical fibers to a spectrometer can provide information on how process alterations impact coke formation.

过去十年，丙烯的需求显著增加，超过了传统方法如乙烷蒸汽裂解和FCC（流化床催化裂解）提供的数量。Catofin工艺的循环时间基于以往的经验设定。在焦炭燃烧时达到高温度会加速铬的迁移。通过光谱法监测焦炭生成提供了比评估反应器性能更直接的方法。便宜且坚固的紫外可见光探头通过光纤连接到光谱仪，可以获取过程变化如何影响焦炭生成的信息。
