The dehydrogenation of propane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications involve the production of propene from propane, which has become more attractive due to increased demand and limitations of conventional sources. The Catofin process, utilized by companies like ABB Lummus, employs chromium oxide catalysts on an alumina support for propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst's activity fluctuates due to two main factors: the formation of coke and the reduction of chromium from Cr(VI) to Cr(III). High temperatures during coke combustion expedite chromium migration into the alumina support. The catalyst's activity peaks early in the cycle, decreasing subsequently. This decline is confirmed by a rise in overall sample absorbance at 1000 nm, indicating coke formation. The coke content affects the catalyst's performance reversibly, impacting activity levels.

Coke is a critical parameter influencing the catalyst's activity. A small amount enhances activity likely by improving propane adsorption, whereas excessive coke leads to deactivation. Monitoring the coke content through UVVis spectroscopy provides insights into catalyst health and enables adjustments to operational parameters like cycle times, pressure, temperature, and feed rates to optimize efficiency. The coke profile indicates that coke forms primarily from propene, not propane, and its presence correlates with the catalyst's loss of activity, as observed by the coke coverage on the catalyst surface.

自1933年发现以来，以铬氧化物为基础的催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的应用和发展显著。关键的工业应用包括利用丙烷生产丙烯，这得益于需求的增长和传统来源的限制。ABB Lummus等公司使用的Catofin工艺采用铬氧化物负载在氧化铝上的催化剂进行丙烷脱氢。催化剂活性的变化主要由两个原因引起：催化剂表面焦炭的形成和Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)。焦炭燃烧时的高温加速了铬向氧化铝支持物的迁移。催化剂活性的峰值出现在循环早期，随后逐渐下降。这一下降通过在1000 nm处样本吸收率的增加得到证实，表明焦炭的形成。焦炭含量对催化剂性能的可逆影响导致活性水平变化。

焦炭是影响催化剂活性的关键参数。少量焦炭可以提高活性，可能通过改善丙烷吸附来实现；而过量的焦炭会导致催化剂失活。通过紫外可见光谱监测焦炭含量提供有关催化剂健康状态的见解，并允许调整操作参数（如循环时间、压力、温度和进料速率）以优化效率。焦炭轮廓显示，焦炭主要由丙烯而非丙烷形成，并且其存在与催化剂活性的丧失相关，这从催化剂表面上的焦炭覆盖程度中观察到。
