The dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over chromium oxide-based catalysts has evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include the production of olefins and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. Research focus areas include the optimization of catalyst structure, the identification of active sites, selection of support materials, incorporation of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms. These advancements aim to enhance selectivity, yield, stability, and minimize side reactions. The literature indicates that adding magnesium oxide to the supports can moderate acidity, increase the interaction between platinum and the supports, and enhance desorption of dehydrogenation products, leading to improved selectivity and yield. The optimal magnesium/aluminum molar ratio for achieving the highest n-dodecene yield was found to be 1/3. Furthermore, the literature suggests that the deposition of coke over catalysts can increase selectivity, and the online TOF-MS monitoring technology provides real-time, continuous analysis of reaction products during high temperature reactions.
