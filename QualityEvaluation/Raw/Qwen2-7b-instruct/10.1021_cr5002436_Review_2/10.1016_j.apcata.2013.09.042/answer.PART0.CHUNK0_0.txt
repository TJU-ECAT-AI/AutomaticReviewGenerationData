[1] "A detailed study of the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over Al2O3- and Mg  Al O-supported Pt Sn catalysts was reported."
[2] "Adding Mg to the supports achieved the following:(i) moderated the total acidity of the catalysts,weakening the strong acidic sites;(ii) increased the interaction between the Pt and the supports,weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the Pt surface and Pt

bond strength to promote the desorption of the dehydrogenation products;(iii) increased the total pore volume and pore size diameter;(iv) decreased both the specific surface area of the supports and the Pt dispersion on the catalysts."
[3] "The catalysts with added Mg inhibited the side reactions and enhanced both the mono-olefin selectivity and the yield while suppressing the dehydrogenation activity."
[4] "When the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3,the optimal n-dodecene yield could be obtained."
[5] "The coke deposition over the catalysts can increase the selectivity of the catalysts."
[6] "The on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology is a proven and effective method that can be applied in situ during high temperature reactions for detecting the products over the catalysts rapidly and continuously."

1. A comprehensive investigation into the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over aluminum oxide and magnesium-aluminum oxide-supported platinum-tin catalysts was conducted. 

2. Adding magnesium to the supports resulted in a reduction of total acidity, weakening the strong acidic sites. It also enhanced the interaction between platinum and the supports, reducing the adsorption of n-dodecane on the platinum surface and Pt-C bond strength, which facilitated the desorption of dehydrogenation products. Moreover, it increased the total pore volume and pore diameter. 

3. Incorporating magnesium into the catalysts reduced side reactions, improving the mono-olefin selectivity and yield while curbing dehydrogenation activity.

4. When the magnesium-to-aluminum molar ratio reached 1/3, the optimal n-dodecene yield was achieved.

5. Depositing coke on the catalysts could enhance the selectivity of the catalysts.

6. The online TOF-MS monitoring technique proved to be a reliable and efficient method for detecting products in real-time during high-temperature reactions, enabling continuous and accurate analysis of catalyst performance.

1. 对于铝氧化物和镁铝氧化物支持的铂锡催化剂的十二烷脱氢反应进行了全面的研究。

2. 添加镁到载体中，降低了催化剂的总酸性，削弱了强酸性位点。同时，它增强了铂与载体之间的相互作用，减少了铂表面的吸附力和Pt-C键强度，促进了脱氢产物的脱附。此外，它还增加了总孔体积和孔径大小。

3. 将镁加入催化剂中减少了副反应的发生，提高了单烯烃的选择性和产率，抑制了脱氢活性。

4. 当镁与铝的摩尔比达到1/3时，获得了最佳的十二碳烯产率。

5. 催化剂上沉积焦炭可以提高催化剂的选择性。

6. 在高温反应中进行在线TOF-MS监测技术被证明是一种可靠且有效的方法，用于实时检测催化剂上的产品，实现快速、连续的性能分析。
