[1] "A detailed study of the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over Al2O3- and Mg  Al O-supported Pt Sn catalysts was reported."
[2] "Adding Mg to the supports achieved the following: (i) moderated the total acidity of the catalysts, weakening the strong acidic sites; (ii) increased the interaction between the Pt and the supports, weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the Pt surface and Pt C bond strength to promote the desorption of the dehydrogenation products; (iii) increased the total pore volume and pore size diameter; (iv) decreased both the specific surface area of the supports and the Pt dispersion on the catalysts."
[3] "The catalysts with added Mg inhibited the side reactions and enhanced both the mono-olefin selectivity and the yield while suppressing the dehydrogenation activity."
[4] "When the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3, the optimal n-dodecene yield could be obtained."
[5] "The catalyst stability was also enhanced, while the coke formation was lowered by increasing the Mg addition along."
[6] "The coke deposition over the catalysts can increase the selectivity of the catalysts."
[7] "The on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology is a proven and effective method that can be applied in situ during high temperature reactions for detecting the products over the catalysts rapidly and continuously."

The dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over chromium oxide-based catalysts has evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include the production of olefins from paraffins. Research focuses on catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Chromium oxide catalysts are known for their ability to efficiently convert long-chain paraffins into olefins. Promoters such as magnesium oxide help to moderate acidity, increase interaction between platinum and the support, weaken adsorption, and promote desorption of products. This leads to enhanced mono-olefin selectivity and yield, while suppressing dehydrogenation activity. Optimal catalyst performance is achieved when the magnesium-to-aluminum molar ratio reaches 1/3, resulting in the highest n-dodecene yield. Increased magnesium addition enhances catalyst stability and reduces coke formation. The on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology provides real-time detection of products during high temperature reactions, improving the understanding of the reaction process.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的应用和研究已经取得了显著进展。主要工业应用包括从烷烃生产烯烃。研究重点集中在催化剂结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制上。铬氧化物催化剂以其高效将长链烷烃转化为烯烃而闻名。添加镁等促进剂可以调节酸性，增加铂与支撑材料之间的相互作用，减弱铂表面吸附力和铂-C键强度，从而促进产物的释放。这导致单烯选择性和产率的增强，同时抑制脱氢活性。当镁与铝的摩尔比达到1/3时，可以获得最佳的十二碳烯产率。增加镁的添加量可以提高催化剂稳定性并减少结焦形成。在线TOF-MS监控技术能够实时检测高温反应中催化剂上的产物，从而改善对反应过程的理解。
