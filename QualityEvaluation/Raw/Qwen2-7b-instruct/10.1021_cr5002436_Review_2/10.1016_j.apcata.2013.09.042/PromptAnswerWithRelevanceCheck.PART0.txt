1. A comprehensive investigation into the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over aluminum oxide and magnesium-aluminum oxide-supported platinum-tin catalysts was conducted. 

2. Adding magnesium to the supports resulted in a reduction of total acidity, weakening the strong acidic sites. It also enhanced the interaction between platinum and the supports, reducing the adsorption of n-dodecane on the platinum surface and Pt-C bond strength, which facilitated the desorption of dehydrogenation products. Moreover, it increased the total pore volume and pore diameter. 

3. Incorporating magnesium into the catalysts reduced side reactions, improving the mono-olefin selectivity and yield while curbing dehydrogenation activity.

4. When the magnesium-to-aluminum molar ratio reached 1/3, the optimal n-dodecene yield was achieved.

5. Depositing coke on the catalysts could enhance the selectivity of the catalysts.

6. The online TOF-MS monitoring technique proved to be a reliable and efficient method for detecting products in real-time during high-temperature reactions, enabling continuous and accurate analysis of catalyst performance.

The study investigated the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over Pt Sn/Mg Al2O3 catalysts, focusing on the impact of magnesium oxide addition on catalyst performance. The Mg/Al mole ratio influenced the catalyst's acidity, pore structure, and Pt dispersion. Higher Mg content led to a decrease in specific surface area, pore volume, and acidity, which in turn reduced dehydrogenation activity. However, it increased mono-olefin selectivity and yield. The optimal n-dodecene yield was achieved with a 1/3 Mg/Al molar ratio. An in situ TOF-MS technique was developed for continuous monitoring of dehydrogenation products, offering insights into reaction dynamics and product distribution.

该研究探讨了含镁氧化铝支持的铂锡催化剂上n-十二烷脱氢的性能，重点关注了镁含量对催化剂的影响。不同的Mg/Al摩尔比影响了催化剂的酸性、孔结构和铂分散度。较高的Mg含量导致特定表面面积、孔体积和酸性的下降，进而减少了脱氢活性。然而，它增加了单烯烃的选择性和产率。通过1/3的Mg/Al摩尔比可以获得最佳的n-十二烯产率。开发了一种原位TOF-MS技术用于脱氢产物的连续监测，为了解反应动态和产物分布提供了见解。

The dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over chromium oxide-based catalysts has evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include the production of olefins and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. Research focus areas include the optimization of catalyst structure, the identification of active sites, selection of support materials, incorporation of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms. These advancements aim to enhance selectivity, yield, stability, and minimize side reactions. The literature indicates that adding magnesium oxide to the supports can moderate acidity, increase the interaction between platinum and the supports, and enhance desorption of dehydrogenation products, leading to improved selectivity and yield. The optimal magnesium/aluminum molar ratio for achieving the highest n-dodecene yield was found to be 1/3. Furthermore, the literature suggests that the deposition of coke over catalysts can increase selectivity, and the online TOF-MS monitoring technology provides real-time, continuous analysis of reaction products during high temperature reactions.

The dehydrogenation products were analyzed by GC. A single photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (SPI-TOF-MS) was developed and used to monitor the dehydrogenation products on-line during continuous reactions.
Adding Mg to the supports decreased the specific surface area, increased the pore volume and diameter, moderated the acidity, and changed the strong acidic sites to weak ones.
The dehydrogenation activity of the catalysts was inhibited, while the mono-olefin selectivity and yield were enhanced by Mg addition.
Using a 1/3 Mg/Al molar ratio generated the optimal n-dodecene yield over the Pt Sn/Mg Al O catalysts.
The TOF-MS was reliable for detecting the dehydrogenation products of the long-chain paraffins rapidly, continuously, and accurately.
Interestingly, TOF-MS can be used to monitor the reactions on-line and in situ, providing analyses of the products during high temperature reactions.

The dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over chromium oxide-based catalysts has evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include the production of olefins from paraffins. Research focuses on catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Chromium oxide catalysts are known for their ability to efficiently convert long-chain paraffins into olefins. Promoters such as magnesium oxide help to moderate acidity, increase interaction between platinum and the support, weaken adsorption, and promote desorption of products. This leads to enhanced mono-olefin selectivity and yield, while suppressing dehydrogenation activity. Optimal catalyst performance is achieved when the magnesium-to-aluminum molar ratio reaches 1/3, resulting in the highest n-dodecene yield. Increased magnesium addition enhances catalyst stability and reduces coke formation. The on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology provides real-time detection of products during high temperature reactions, improving the understanding of the reaction process.
