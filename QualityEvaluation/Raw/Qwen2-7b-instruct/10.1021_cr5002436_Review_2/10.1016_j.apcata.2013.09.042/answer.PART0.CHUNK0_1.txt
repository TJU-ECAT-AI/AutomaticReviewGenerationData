<p>The strong acidic sites in the alumina-supported catalysts favored the formation of aromatics and low selectivities for mono-olefins.</p>
<p>Adding Mg  to the sup- ports achieved the following:(i) moderated the total acidity of the catalysts,weakening the strong acidic sites;(ii) increased the inter- action between the Pt and the supports,weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the Pt surface and Pt

bond strength to promote the desorption of the dehydrogenation products;(iii) increased the total pore volume and pore size diameter;(iv) decreased both the specific surface area of the supports and the Pt dispersion on the catalysts.</p>
<p>The catalysts with added Mg inhibited the side reactions and enhanced both the mono-olefin selectivity and the yield while suppressing the dehydrogenation activity.</p>
<p>When the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3,the optimal n-dodecene yield could be obtained.</p>

The study investigated the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over Pt Sn/Mg Al2O3 catalysts, focusing on the impact of magnesium oxide addition on catalyst performance. The Mg/Al mole ratio influenced the catalyst's acidity, pore structure, and Pt dispersion. Higher Mg content led to a decrease in specific surface area, pore volume, and acidity, which in turn reduced dehydrogenation activity. However, it increased mono-olefin selectivity and yield. The optimal n-dodecene yield was achieved with a 1/3 Mg/Al molar ratio. An in situ TOF-MS technique was developed for continuous monitoring of dehydrogenation products, offering insights into reaction dynamics and product distribution.

该研究探讨了含镁氧化铝支持的铂锡催化剂上n-十二烷脱氢的性能，重点关注了镁含量对催化剂的影响。不同的Mg/Al摩尔比影响了催化剂的酸性、孔结构和铂分散度。较高的Mg含量导致特定表面面积、孔体积和酸性的下降，进而减少了脱氢活性。然而，它增加了单烯烃的选择性和产率。通过1/3的Mg/Al摩尔比可以获得最佳的n-十二烯产率。开发了一种原位TOF-MS技术用于脱氢产物的连续监测，为了解反应动态和产物分布提供了见解。
