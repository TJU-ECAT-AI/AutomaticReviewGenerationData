[1] "The catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2 (SC, 0.08 to 0.99% chromium by weight), CrOx/Al2O3 (AC, 0.16 to 1.55%), and α-Cr2O3 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been investigated."
[2] "Before catalytic experiments, SC and AC samples were activated with oxygen at 773 K (s.o. treatment) followed or not followed by reduction with CO or H2 at 623 K."
[3] "In SC catalysts reduced with CO, the formation of carbonyls and nitrosyls of three different CrII species was confirmed."
[4] "Relying on (i) the dependence of the activity on chromium content, (ii) IR results, and (iii) ESR data, it is suggested that mononuclear CrIII with two coordinative vacancies is the active site for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[5] "The catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3, and α-Cr2O3 is compared with that of CrOx/ZrO2, measured previously."

2. The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane using CrOx/SiO2 (SC), CrOx/Al2O3 (AC), and α-Cr2O3 catalysts across a range of temperatures (723 to 823 K). The catalysts were activated with oxygen at 773 K, followed by reduction with CO or H2 at 623 K. Some SC samples underwent dehydration under vacuum at 1023 K prior to activation.

2. 研究采用CrOx/SiO2（SC）、CrOx/Al2O3（AC）和α-Cr2O3催化剂在723至823 K的温度范围内进行丙烷脱氢实验。催化剂在773 K下用氧气激活，随后在623 K下用CO或H2进行还原。部分SC样品在激活前在1023 K下在真空条件下进行脱水处理。

3. Surface species formed upon adsorption at room temperature (RT) of CO or NO were studied by IR spectroscopy on CrOx/SiO2 samples subjected to treatments similar to those used before catalytic experiments. The presence of various CrII species, including carbonyls and nitrosyls, was confirmed in SC catalysts reduced with CO. However, after treatments involving reduction with H2 at 773 K, heating with H2O after CO reduction, or exposure to propane post-reduction, only a carbonyl and a dinitrosyl of CrIII were observed.
