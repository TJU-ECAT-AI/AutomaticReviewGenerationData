[1] "The catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2 (SC, 0.08 to 0.99% chromium by weight), CrOx/Al2O3 (AC, 0.16 to 1.55%), and α-Cr2O3 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been investigated."
[2] "Before catalytic experiments, SC and AC samples were activated with oxygen at 773 K (s.o. treatment) followed or not followed by reduction with CO or H2 at 623 K."
[3] "Assuming all chromium to be in the +6 state after s.o., the average oxidation number of chromium ( ) is 2 in SC samples reduced with CO and 3 with H2."
[4] "In AC catalysts, values progressively increase in consecutive reduction experiments, from = 2.2 to = 4.2."
[5] "All catalysts are highly selective to propene and undergo a deactivation process during time on stream."
[6] "Relying on (i) the dependence of the activity on chromium content, (ii) IR results, and (iii) ESR data, it is suggested that mononuclear CrIII with two coordinative vacancies is the active site for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[7] "The catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3, and α-Cr2O3 is compared with that of CrOx/ZrO2, measured previously."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 involves advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons for the production of olefins. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst properties such as chromium content, which affects activity, and studying surface chemistry through techniques like infrared spectroscopy and electron spin resonance to identify active sites. Comparisons with other catalyst systems, such as CrOx/ZrO2, highlight differences in performance, possibly due to unique interactions between chromium and the support material. The study suggests that mononuclear CrIII with two coordinative vacancies may be the active site for propane dehydrogenation.
