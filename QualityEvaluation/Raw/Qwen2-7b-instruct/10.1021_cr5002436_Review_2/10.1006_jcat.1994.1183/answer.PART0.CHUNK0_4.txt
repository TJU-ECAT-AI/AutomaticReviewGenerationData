[1] "The catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2 (SC, 0.08 to 0.99% chromium by weight), CrOx/Al2O3 (AC, 0.16 to 1.55%), and α-Cr2O3 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been investigated at 723 to 823 K in a flow apparatus."
[2] "Before catalytic experiments, SC and AC samples were activated with oxygen at 773 K (s.o. treatment) followed or not followed by reduction with CO or H2 at 623 K."
[3] "Assuming all chromium to be in the +6 state after s.o., the average oxidation number of chromium ( ) is 2 in SC samples reduced with CO and 3 with H2."
[4] "In AC catalysts, values progressively increase in consecutive reduction experiments, from = 2.2 to = 4.2."
[5] "All catalysts are highly selective to propene and undergo a deactivation process during time on stream."
[6] "The s.o. treatment completely restores the activity."
[7] "The reduction mode does not influence the catalytic activity."
[8] "Surface species formed upon adsorption at room temperature (RT) of CO or NO were studied by IR spectroscopy on CrOx/SiO2 submitted to treatments analogous to those used before catalytic experiments."
[9] "In SC catalysts reduced with CO, the formation of carbonyls and nitrosyls of three different CrII species was confirmed."
[10] "Interestingly, all these species were absent when the sample was (i) reduced with H2 at 773 K, or (ii) heated with H2O after reduction with CO, or (iii) exposed to propane after reduction with either CO or H2."
[11] "After treatments (i) through (iii), a carbonyl and a dinitrosyl of CrIII were the only species formed on CO or NO adsorption at RT."
[12] "Relying on (i) the dependence of the activity on chromium content, (ii) IR results, and (iii) ESR data, it is suggested that mononuclear CrIII with two coordinative vacancies is the active site for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[13] "The catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3, and α-Cr2O3 is compared with that of CrOx/ZrO2, measured previously."
[14] "Possible reasons for the substantially higher activity of CrOx/ZrO2 are discussed."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly advanced the field of dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include the understanding of catalyst structures, identification of active sites, selection of support materials, exploration of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms. Chromium oxide catalysts have been studied extensively for their ability to selectively convert propane into propene, demonstrating high catalytic activity. The study involves treatments such as surface oxidation (s.o.), reduction with CO or H2, and dehydration under vacuum, which influence the catalyst's performance and stability. The oxidation state of chromium in these catalysts varies depending on the activation conditions, indicating its critical role in the catalytic activity. The selective formation of specific surface species upon adsorption of gases like CO or NO at room temperature, observed through infrared spectroscopy and electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques, suggests that mononuclear CrIII with two coordinative vacancies may act as the active site for propane dehydrogenation. Comparisons with other chromium oxide catalysts, such as CrOx/ZrO2, highlight the importance of support materials in determining catalytic efficiency. The research focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms and optimizing the catalyst properties for improved performance in industrial applications.
