The literature does not provide specific details about the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 or their key industrial applications and research focus areas related to dehydrogenation processes. It focuses on various industrial developments and projects such as chemical manufacturing facilities, power plant constructions, and expansions in different industries. Therefore, I cannot provide answers based on the given document regarding the evolution and applications of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.
