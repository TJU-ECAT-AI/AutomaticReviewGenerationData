[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation with chromia/alumina is an industrially important route for producing light alkenes [1]."
[2] "This system has been extensively studied during the past decades [27]."
[3] "The activity of the chromia dehydrogenation catalysts can be enhanced, e.g. by adding alkali dopants [8], or by the use of zirconia as the support material [9]."
[4] "Zirconia deposition on alumina decreased the Lewis acidity of the support and the coke formation rate during the dehydrogenation."
[5] "The dehydrogenation activities of the supports were low. Deposition of chromium (12 atCr/nm2) increased the activity for all catalysts."
[6] "The chromia/zirconia catalyst had the highest activity, whereas the use of zirconia/alumina support decreased the activity."
[7] "The results suggested that the Lewis acidity alone is not important for the activity of the chromia-containing catalysts, but the phase of zirconia might have an influence."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include production of light alkenes via dehydrogenation. Research focuses on catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms.

2. Over the past decades, extensive studies have been conducted on enhancing the activity of chromium oxide catalysts. Methods include adding alkali dopants or utilizing zirconia as the support material.

3. Depositing zirconia onto alumina reduces the Lewis acidity of the support, thereby decreasing the coke formation rate during dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Initially, the dehydrogenation activities of the supports were quite low. However, after adding 12 atomic percent chromium per square nanometer, the activity improved for all catalyst types.

5. The catalyst with a chromium/zirconia combination displayed the highest dehydrogenation activity, while using a zirconia/alumina support resulted in a lower activity.

6. The findings indicate that the Lewis acidity of the material alone does not determine the activity of chromium-containing catalysts. Instead, the phase of the zirconia plays a significant role.

1. 自1933年以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的演变。关键的工业应用包括通过脱氢生产轻烯烃。研究重点集中在催化剂结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制上。

2. 在过去的几十年里，对提高铬氧化物催化剂活性的大量研究进行了深入探讨。方法包括添加碱性掺杂剂或使用锆作为支撑材料。

3. 将锆沉积到氧化铝上降低了支撑材料的Lewis酸性，从而减少了脱氢反应过程中的焦炭形成速率。

4. 初始时，支持材料的脱氢化活性相当低。然而，在每平方纳米添加12个原子百分比的铬后，所有催化剂的活性均有所提升。

5. 含有铬/锆的催化剂显示出了最高的脱氢化活性，而使用锆/氧化铝支撑材料导致活性降低。

6. 研究结果表明，仅由材料的Lewis酸性决定催化剂的活性并不重要。相反，锆的相态在其中扮演着重要角色。
