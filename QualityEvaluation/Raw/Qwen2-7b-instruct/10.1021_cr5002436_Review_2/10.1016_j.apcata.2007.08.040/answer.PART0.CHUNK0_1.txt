[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation with chromia/alumina is an industrially important route for producing light alkenes [1]."
[2] "The activity of the chromia dehydrogenation catalysts can be enhanced, e.g. by adding alkali dopants [8], or by the use of zirconia as the support material [9]."
[3] "Zirconia deposition on alumina decreased the Lewis acidity of the support and the coke formation rate during the dehydrogenation."
[4] "The dehydrogenation activities of the supports were low. Deposition of chromium (12 atCr/nm2) increased the activity for all catalysts."
[5] "The chromia/zirconia catalyst had the highest activity, whereas the use of zirconia/alumina support decreased the activity."
[6] "The coke deposition rate increased with increasing dehydrogenation activity."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been crucial in the industrial production of light alkenes through dehydrogenation processes since their discovery in 1933.
2. Enhancements in catalyst activity can be achieved by incorporating alkali dopants or utilizing zirconia as a support material.
3. Depositing zirconia on alumina lowers the Lewis acidity of the support and reduces the coke formation rate during the dehydrogenation process.
4. Without chromium deposition, the dehydrogenation activities of the supports were minimal. However, chromium deposition at a density of 12 atoms per nanometer squared increased the activity across all catalyst types.
5. The catalyst with a combination of chromium and zirconia showed the highest dehydrogenation activity, while the use of zirconia/alumina as a support material decreased the activity.
6. The rate of coke deposition increased with the level of dehydrogenation activity.

1. 自1933年发现以来，含铬氧化物的催化剂在通过脱氢过程生产轻烯烃方面发挥了重要作用。
2. 催化剂活性的提升可以通过添加碱性掺杂剂或使用氧化锆作为支撑材料来实现。
3. 在氧化铝上沉积氧化锆降低了支撑材料的Lewis酸性并减少了脱氢过程中焦炭的生成速率。
4. 在没有铬沉积的情况下，支撑材料的脱氢活性较低。然而，每纳米平方12个原子的铬沉积提高了所有催化剂类型的活性。
5. 含有铬和氧化锆的催化剂显示出了最高的脱氢活性，而使用氧化锆/氧化铝作为支撑材料降低了活性。
6. 脱氢活动水平越高，沉积的焦炭速率也越高。
