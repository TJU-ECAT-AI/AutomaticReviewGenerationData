1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, primarily focusing on improving industrial applications and research areas such as catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications involve producing light alkenes through dehydrogenation processes.

2. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide catalysts, researchers often incorporate alkali dopants or utilize zirconia as a support material. 

3. Depositing zirconia on alumina reduces the Lewis acidity of the support, thereby decreasing the coke formation rate during dehydrogenation processes.

4. Initially, the dehydrogenation activities of the catalysts were found to be low.

5. Introducing chromium at a concentration of 12 atoms per square nanometer increased the overall activity of the catalysts.

6. Among the catalysts tested, the chromia/zirconia combination demonstrated the highest dehydrogenation activity, while the use of zirconia/alumina as a support led to a decrease in activity.

7. The rate of coke deposition increased with a rise in the dehydrogenation activity, highlighting the importance of understanding this relationship for optimizing catalyst performance.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著发展，主要集中在改进工业应用和研究领域，如催化剂结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制。关键工业应用包括通过脱氢过程生产轻烯烃。

2. 为了提高铬氧化物催化剂的活性，研究人员通常会采用添加碱性掺杂剂或使用氧化锆作为支持材料的方法。

3. 在铝酸盐上沉积氧化锆降低了支持材料的Lewis酸性，并减少了脱氢过程中的焦炭生成速率。

4. 初始的脱氢活性测试结果显示，催化剂的活性较低。

5. 将铬以每平方纳米12个原子的浓度引入提高了所有催化剂的整体活性。

6. 其中，氧化铬/氧化锆组合表现出最高的脱氢活性，而使用氧化锆/铝酸盐作为支撑材料导致活性下降。

7. 随着脱氢活性的增加，焦炭沉积速率也会上升，这强调了理解这种关系对于优化催化剂性能的重要性。
