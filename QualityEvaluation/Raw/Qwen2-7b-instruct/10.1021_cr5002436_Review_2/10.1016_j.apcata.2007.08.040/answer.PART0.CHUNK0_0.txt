The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Industrial applications have included processes such as dehydrogenation, reforming, combustion, and reduction. Research has focused on enhancing catalyst activity through modifications like adding alkali dopants or utilizing zirconia as a support material. Despite zirconia's positive impact on activity, its low surface area has been addressed by depositing it onto high surface area oxides like alumina. Surface composition and characteristics of zirconia/alumina systems have been studied extensively. The activity of catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation has been influenced by factors such as the amount of chromium, the phase of zirconia, and the rate of coke deposition. The Lewis acidity of the support material was found not to be the sole determinant of catalyst activity, suggesting that the phase of zirconia plays a significant role.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展已经通过对其结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解改进。工业应用包括脱氢、重整、燃烧和还原等过程。研究重点集中在通过添加碱性掺杂剂或使用氧化锆作为支撑材料来增强催化剂活性。尽管氧化锆对活性有正面影响，但其低比表面积的问题已通过将其沉积到高比表面积氧化铝上得到解决。对氧化锆/氧化铝系统的表面组成和特性进行了广泛研究。在异丁烷脱氢过程中，催化剂的活性受到诸如铬含量、氧化锆相态和焦炭沉积速率等因素的影响。研究结果表明，支持材料的Lewis酸度并非催化剂活性的唯一决定因素，氧化锆的相态似乎起着重要作用。
