[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation with chromia/alumina is an industrially important route for producing light alkenes [1]."
[2] "The activity of the chromia dehydrogenation catalysts can be enhanced, e.g. by adding alkali dopants [8], or by the use of zirconia as the support material [9]."
[3] "Zirconia deposition on alumina decreased the Lewis acidity of the support and the coke formation rate during the dehydrogenation."
[4] "The dehydrogenation activities of the supports were low. Deposition of chromium (12 atCr/nm2) increased the activity for all catalysts."
[5] "The chromia/zirconia catalyst had the highest activity, whereas the use of zirconia/alumina support decreased the activity."
[6] "The results suggested that the Lewis acidity alone is not important for the activity of the chromia-containing catalysts, but the phase of zirconia might have an influence."
[7] "The higher activity of chromia/zirconia compared with the activities of the alumina- and zirconia/alumina-supported chromia catalysts might originate from more easily available chromium species or from a beneficial interaction between the zirconia support and the chromium species."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been crucial in dehydrogenation processes since their discovery in 1933, primarily used for producing light alkenes. They can be enhanced by adding alkali dopants or using zirconia as the support material.
2. Depositing zirconia on alumina reduced the Lewis acidity of the support and lowered the coke formation rate during the dehydrogenation process.
3. The dehydrogenation activities of the catalysts were initially low, but the addition of chromium (at a density of 12 atoms per square nanometer) increased the activity across all catalyst types.
4. The chromia/zirconia catalyst demonstrated the highest dehydrogenation activity, while the use of a zirconia/alumina support led to a decrease in activity.
5. The Lewis acidity of the support material was not the sole determinant of catalyst activity; the phase of the zirconia played a significant role.
6. The enhanced activity of the chromia/zirconia catalyst might stem from the availability of more accessible chromium species or an advantageous interaction between the zirconia support and the chromium components.

1. 自1933年以来，氧化铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中的重要性显著，主要用于生产轻烯烃。通过添加碱土金属掺杂剂或使用锆作为载体材料可以增强其活性。
2. 将锆沉积到氧化铝上降低了支持材料的Lewis酸度，并减少了脱氢过程中焦炭的生成速率。
3. 催化剂的脱氢活性最初较低，但添加铬（每平方纳米12个原子）提高了所有催化剂的活性。
4. 氧化铬/锆催化剂表现出最高的脱氢活性，而使用锆/氧化铝支持则降低了活性。
5. 支持材料的Lewis酸度并非决定催化剂活性的唯一因素；锆的相态对性能影响显著。
6. 氧化铬/锆催化剂活性增强可能源于更易获得的铬物种的存在或者锆支持与铬成分之间有利的相互作用。
