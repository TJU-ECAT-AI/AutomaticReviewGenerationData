[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."
[2] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+,which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]."
[3] "Reduction of Cr6+ (and Cr5+) under dehydrogenation conditions or during the prereduction of CrOx/Al2O3 has been concluded to result mainly in the formation of Cr3+, i.e. redox Cr3+ [3,4,7,8,10,1214]."
[4] "One approach to obtaining well-defined supported oxide catalysts is the use of atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) [25,26], which is a solvent-free technique relying on saturating gas-solid reactions."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with their development driven by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. They are currently utilized commercially in the production of propene and i-butene from paraffins, demonstrating their significant role in dehydrogenation processes.
2. At low loadings, chromium is primarily anchored on alumina as Cr6+ surface species. However, at higher loadings, the catalysts contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation. This dual nature of chromium in different oxidation states contributes to the catalytic efficiency.
3. Under dehydrogenation conditions, Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+, forming redox Cr3+ sites, which are considered active in the dehydrogenation reaction. These redox sites play a crucial role in the conversion process.
4. A novel approach for obtaining well-defined supported oxide catalysts involves the use of atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), a solvent-free technique that relies on saturating gas-solid reactions to prepare catalysts with controlled structures.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的演变，其发展得益于对结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制的深入理解。它们目前在丙烯和异丁烯从烷烃的生产中得到广泛应用，证明了其在脱氢过程中的重要性。
2. 在低负载下，铬主要以六价表面物种形式锚定在氧化铝上。然而，在高负载下，催化剂包含三价铬，具有抗氧化性。这种双态铬在不同氧化状态下的特性促进了催化效率。
3. 在脱氢条件下，六价铬被还原为三价铬，形成可逆三价铬位点，被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。这些可逆位点在转化过程中起着关键作用。
4. 一种新型制备具有精确结构的氧化物催化剂的方法是原子层外延（ALE）技术，这是一种无溶剂技术，依赖于饱和气固反应来制备具有可控结构的催化剂。
