1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts, particularly those utilizing chromium on aluminum oxide support, have been extensively studied since their discovery in 1933. They are industrially significant due to their extensive use in producing propene and isobutene from their respective paraffin precursors. The catalysts' performance is closely tied to the presence of redox-active Cr3+ sites on the surface of the CrOx/Al2O3 material.

2. At lower loadings, chromium tends to anchor primarily as Cr6+ species on the aluminum oxide support. However, at higher loadings, the catalyst composition includes Cr3+, which resists further oxidation.

3. Redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites are identified as the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. This conclusion is supported by recent studies which propose that these sites enable efficient conversion of paraffins to olefins.

4. The authors report the successful preparation of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts with a chromium loading of up to 12.5 wt.% using the atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) technique.

5. The laboratory's research indicates that Cr6+ can be reduced to Cr3+ under conditions involving hydrogen, methane, or n-butane at 580°C. This reduction process is thought to occur on the active sites responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction.

6. The aluminum oxide support is noted to stabilize the Cr3+ species against reduction below the Cr3+ state, although there are reports of the formation of Cr2+ under certain conditions.

1.X铬氧化物催化剂，尤其是那些使用铬在铝氧化物支持上的催化剂，自1933年的发现以来就进行了广泛的研究。它们在工业上具有重要性，主要由于它们被广泛用于从相应的烷烃生产丙烯和异丁烯。催化剂性能与CrOx/Al2O3材料表面的可还原Cr3+位点的存在密切相关。

2.在较低负载下，铬倾向于主要作为Cr6+物种锚定在铝氧化物支持上。然而，在较高负载下，催化剂成分包括Cr3+，该物种抵抗进一步氧化。

3.可还原或暴露的非可还原Cr3+位点被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。这一结论得到了最近研究的支持，这些研究认为这些位点能够有效地将烷烃转化为烯烃。

4.作者报告了使用原子层外延（ALE）技术成功制备了CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，其中的铬负载最高可达12.5 wt.%。

5.实验室的研究表明，在氢、甲烷或n-丁烷存在下，580°C时Cr6+可以被还原为Cr3+。这种还原过程被认为发生在负责脱氢反应的活性位点上。

6.铝氧化物支持被注意到稳定了Cr3+物种，使其在低于Cr3+状态的条件下不受还原，尽管有报道在某些条件下形成了Cr2+。
