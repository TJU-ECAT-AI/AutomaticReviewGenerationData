[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."
[2] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+,which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]."
[3] "Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,14]."
[4] "In our work [21],we showed that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ by hydrogen,methane, or n-butane at 580C [21], and in accordance with others [7,8,10,14], we proposed that the redox Cr3+ sites are active in dehydrogenation."
[5] "One approach to obtaining well-defined supported oxide catalysts is the use of atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) [25,26], which is a solvent-free technique relying on saturating gassolid reactions."
[6] "In the present study, the saturating reaction of Cr(acac)3 with Al2O3 was investigated in detail by recording FT-IR spectra of the surface Cr complex."
[7] "Furthermore, catalysts were prepared by ALE with a Cr loading up to 12.5 wt.% Cr (10 cycles). The ALE catalysts, together with catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation were examined for oxidation state distribution of chromium (XPS and wet-chemical method), dispersion of CrOx (H2-TPR, solubility of Cr6+ surface species, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and IR), and activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been extensively studied since their discovery in 1933, with significant commercial applications in producing propene and i-butene from paraffins. They have evolved to contain both Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, where Cr6+ is mainly found on the Al2O3 surface, while Cr3+ is more resistant to oxidation. Redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites are identified as active sites in dehydrogenation reactions, and they can be reduced from Cr6+ by hydrogen, methane, or n-butane under certain conditions. New approaches such as atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) have been developed to prepare well-defined supported oxide catalysts with precise control over the structure and active sites.

2. The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts includes advancements in understanding the active sites involved in dehydrogenation processes. Research focuses on the structure of the catalysts, including the distribution and stability of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. Studies also investigate the support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms to enhance catalytic performance. Techniques like ALE are employed to improve the dispersion of chromium species and tailor the catalyst properties for optimal dehydrogenation efficiency.

3. The catalysts' structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms are critical factors contributing to their significance in dehydrogenation processes. The presence of redox Cr3+ sites, which can be reduced from Cr6+ under specific conditions, plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation reaction. Understanding these sites and their interactions with the support material, like Al2O3, helps in designing catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity. Promoters, such as those used in ALE, can further improve the catalyst's performance by controlling the dispersion and reactivity of the active sites.

4. The development of ALE as a technique for preparing chromium oxide-based catalysts represents a significant advancement in the field. This method allows for the precise control of the catalyst's structure, leading to well-defined surfaces with controlled active sites. By investigating the saturation reactions of Cr(acac)3 with Al2O3 and analyzing the FT-IR spectra of the resulting surface complexes, researchers can gain insights into the catalyst's structure and functionality. The ability to prepare catalysts with a Cr loading up to 12.5 wt.% through ALE highlights the technique's potential for achieving high activity in dehydrogenation processes. Comparisons with catalysts prepared using traditional impregnation techniques can provide valuable information on the advantages and limitations of different preparation methods.

5. In the context of chromium oxide-based catalysts, the active sites responsible for dehydrogenation reactions are typically redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites. These sites can be identified through various characterization techniques, such as XPS, which reveals the oxidation state distribution of chromium. Additionally, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and solubility measurements can indicate the nature and distribution of the active sites on the catalyst surface. By examining the activity of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of i-butane, researchers can evaluate the effectiveness of these sites in facilitating the desired chemical transformation. The comparison of catalysts prepared by ALE and impregnation techniques suggests that the former can offer advantages in terms of activity and selectivity due to the more uniform distribution of active sites.
