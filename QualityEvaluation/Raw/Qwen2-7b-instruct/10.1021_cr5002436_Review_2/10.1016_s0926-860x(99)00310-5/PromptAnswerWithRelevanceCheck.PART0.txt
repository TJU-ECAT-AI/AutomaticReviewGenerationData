1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts, particularly those utilizing chromium on aluminum oxide support, have been extensively studied since their discovery in 1933. They are industrially significant due to their extensive use in producing propene and isobutene from their respective paraffin precursors. The catalysts' performance is closely tied to the presence of redox-active Cr3+ sites on the surface of the CrOx/Al2O3 material.

2. At lower loadings, chromium tends to anchor primarily as Cr6+ species on the aluminum oxide support. However, at higher loadings, the catalyst composition includes Cr3+, which resists further oxidation.

3. Redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites are identified as the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. This conclusion is supported by recent studies which propose that these sites enable efficient conversion of paraffins to olefins.

4. The authors report the successful preparation of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts with a chromium loading of up to 12.5 wt.% using the atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) technique.

5. The laboratory's research indicates that Cr6+ can be reduced to Cr3+ under conditions involving hydrogen, methane, or n-butane at 580°C. This reduction process is thought to occur on the active sites responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction.

6. The aluminum oxide support is noted to stabilize the Cr3+ species against reduction below the Cr3+ state, although there are reports of the formation of Cr2+ under certain conditions.

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been extensively studied since their discovery in 1933, with significant commercial applications in producing propene and i-butene from paraffins. They have evolved to contain both Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, where Cr6+ is mainly found on the Al2O3 surface, while Cr3+ is more resistant to oxidation. Redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites are identified as active sites in dehydrogenation reactions, and they can be reduced from Cr6+ by hydrogen, methane, or n-butane under certain conditions. New approaches such as atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) have been developed to prepare well-defined supported oxide catalysts with precise control over the structure and active sites.

2. The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts includes advancements in understanding the active sites involved in dehydrogenation processes. Research focuses on the structure of the catalysts, including the distribution and stability of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. Studies also investigate the support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms to enhance catalytic performance. Techniques like ALE are employed to improve the dispersion of chromium species and tailor the catalyst properties for optimal dehydrogenation efficiency.

3. The catalysts' structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms are critical factors contributing to their significance in dehydrogenation processes. The presence of redox Cr3+ sites, which can be reduced from Cr6+ under specific conditions, plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation reaction. Understanding these sites and their interactions with the support material, like Al2O3, helps in designing catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity. Promoters, such as those used in ALE, can further improve the catalyst's performance by controlling the dispersion and reactivity of the active sites.

4. The development of ALE as a technique for preparing chromium oxide-based catalysts represents a significant advancement in the field. This method allows for the precise control of the catalyst's structure, leading to well-defined surfaces with controlled active sites. By investigating the saturation reactions of Cr(acac)3 with Al2O3 and analyzing the FT-IR spectra of the resulting surface complexes, researchers can gain insights into the catalyst's structure and functionality. The ability to prepare catalysts with a Cr loading up to 12.5 wt.% through ALE highlights the technique's potential for achieving high activity in dehydrogenation processes. Comparisons with catalysts prepared using traditional impregnation techniques can provide valuable information on the advantages and limitations of different preparation methods.

5. In the context of chromium oxide-based catalysts, the active sites responsible for dehydrogenation reactions are typically redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites. These sites can be identified through various characterization techniques, such as XPS, which reveals the oxidation state distribution of chromium. Additionally, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and solubility measurements can indicate the nature and distribution of the active sites on the catalyst surface. By examining the activity of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of i-butane, researchers can evaluate the effectiveness of these sites in facilitating the desired chemical transformation. The comparison of catalysts prepared by ALE and impregnation techniques suggests that the former can offer advantages in terms of activity and selectivity due to the more uniform distribution of active sites.

2. 铬氧化物催化剂的发展包括对参与脱氢过程的活性位点结构的理解进步。研究重点放在催化剂的结构上，包括Cr6+和Cr3+物种的存在及其稳定性。此外，支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的研究也被用于提高催化性能。原子层外延（ALE）等新技术的应用旨在精确控制催化剂的结构，从而获得具有明确活性位点的催化剂。

3. 在脱氢过程中，催化剂的结构、活性位点、支持材料和反应机制是其重要贡献的关键因素。还原Cr3+位点的作用，这些位点可以在特定条件下从Cr6+还原，对于脱氢反应至关重要。理解这些位点及其与支持材料（如Al2O3）的相互作用有助于设计具有增强活性和选择性的催化剂。促进剂，例如在ALE中使用的那些，可以进一步通过控制活性位点的分散性和反应性来改进催化剂的性能。

4. 作为制备铬氧化物催化剂的技术，ALE代表了该领域的重大进展。这种方法允许对催化剂的结构进行精确控制，从而获得具有定义明确表面和控制活性位点的催化剂。通过研究Cr(acac)3与Al2O3的饱和反应并分析表面复合物的FT-IR光谱，研究人员可以获得有关催化剂结构和功能的见解。能够通过ALE制备Cr负载高达12.5 wt.%的催化剂强调了该技术在实现脱氢过程高效性的潜力。与使用传统浸渍技术制备的催化剂进行比较，可以提供有关不同制备方法优势和限制的有价值信息。

5. 铬氧化物催化剂中的活性位点负责脱氢反应，通常是还原或非还原暴露的Cr3+位点。通过各种表征技术，如XPS，可以揭示铬的氧化状态分布。此外，氢温度程序还原（H2-TPR）和溶解度测量可以指示活性位点在催化剂表面上的性质和分布。通过评估催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中的活性，研究人员可以评估这些位点在促进所需化学转换的有效性。比较通过ALE和浸渍技术制备的催化剂表明，前者可能在活动性和选择性方面提供优势，因为活性位点的分布更加均匀。

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied extensively since their discovery in 1933, primarily due to their commercial-scale application in converting paraffins into propene and i-butene. These catalysts are characterized by the presence of various chromium oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) depending on pretreatment, chromium concentration, and catalyst support material. At lower loadings, chromium tends to anchor on aluminum oxide as Cr6+ surface species, while at higher loadings, Cr3+ forms, which resists oxidation. The redox Cr3+ sites are believed to be active in dehydrogenation processes. Aluminum oxide supports stabilize Cr3+ against further reduction to Cr2+. Research focuses on understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts.

2. The saturation reaction of chromium acetyl acetonate (Cr(acac)3) with aluminum oxide was explored in detail, utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to examine the surface chromium complex. This study involved preparing catalysts with a chromium loading up to 12.5 wt.% through atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and impregnation methods. The catalysts were evaluated for chromium oxidation state distribution, chromium oxide dispersion, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), solubility of Cr6+ surface species, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and infrared spectroscopy. Their activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane was also assessed.
