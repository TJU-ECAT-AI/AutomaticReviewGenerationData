[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."
[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."
[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]."
[4] "At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+,which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]."
[5] "Reduction of Cr6+ (and Cr5+) under dehydrogenation conditions or during the prereduction of CrOx/Al2O3 has been concluded to result mainly in the formation of Cr3+, i.e. redox Cr3+ [3,4,7,8,10,1214]."

[7] "In our work [21],we showed that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ by hydrogen,methane, or n-butane at 580C [21], and in accordance with others [7,8,10,1214], we proposed that the redox Cr3+ sites are active in dehydrogenation."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied extensively since their discovery in 1933, primarily due to their commercial-scale application in converting paraffins into propene and i-butene. These catalysts are characterized by the presence of various chromium oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) depending on pretreatment, chromium concentration, and catalyst support material. At lower loadings, chromium tends to anchor on aluminum oxide as Cr6+ surface species, while at higher loadings, Cr3+ forms, which resists oxidation. The redox Cr3+ sites are believed to be active in dehydrogenation processes. Aluminum oxide supports stabilize Cr3+ against further reduction to Cr2+. Research focuses on understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts.

2. The saturation reaction of chromium acetyl acetonate (Cr(acac)3) with aluminum oxide was explored in detail, utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to examine the surface chromium complex. This study involved preparing catalysts with a chromium loading up to 12.5 wt.% through atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and impregnation methods. The catalysts were evaluated for chromium oxidation state distribution, chromium oxide dispersion, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), solubility of Cr6+ surface species, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and infrared spectroscopy. Their activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane was also assessed.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂已经进行了深入研究，主要因为它们在将烷烃转化为丙烯和异丁烯方面的商业规模应用。这些催化剂以不同的铬氧化态（6+、5+、3+和2+）存在，具体取决于预处理、铬浓度和催化剂支持材料。在较低负载下，铬倾向于作为Cr6+表面物种锚定在氧化铝上，而在较高负载下，形成Cr3+，其抵抗氧化。认为可逆的Cr3+位点是脱氢反应中的活性位点。氧化铝支持物稳定了Cr3+，使其不易进一步还原至Cr2+。研究重点在于理解催化剂的结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制。

2. 对于铬酸乙酰丙酮（Cr(acac)3）与氧化铝的饱和反应进行了详细研究，使用傅里叶变换红外光谱法（FT-IR）来检查表面铬复合物。通过原子层外延（ALE）和浸渍方法制备了最高含铬量为12.5 wt.%的催化剂。对这些催化剂进行了氧化态分布、铬氧化物分散、氢气温度程序化还原（H2-TPR）、Cr6+表面物种溶解度、X射线衍射（XRD）和红外光谱的评估。它们在异丁烷脱氢作用的活性也得到了测试。
