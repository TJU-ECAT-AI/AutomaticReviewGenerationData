[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."
[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."
[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]."
[4] "At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+,which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]."
[5] "Reduction of Cr6+ (and Cr5+) under dehydrogenation conditions or during the prereduction of CrOx/Al2O3 has been concluded to result mainly in the formation of Cr3+, i.e. redox Cr3+ [3,4,7,8,10,1214]."
[6] "Al2O3 support appears to stabilize Cr3+ against reduction below the 3+ state [1,15], although some papers also describe the formation of Cr2+ [1620]."
[7] "In our work [21],we showed that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ by hydrogen,methane, or n-butane at 580C [21], and in accordance with others [7,8,10,1214], we proposed that the redox Cr3+ sites are active in dehydrogenation."
[8] "Conventionally, CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared from Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solution by impregnation."
[9] "One approach to obtaining well-defined supported oxide catalysts is the use of atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) [25,26], which is a solvent-free technique relying on saturating gas-solid reactions."
[10] "CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts with Cr loading up to 8.8 wt.% (seven cycles) have been prepared [27]."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms contributing to their importance in dehydrogenation processes. These catalysts are now widely used commercially to convert paraffins into propene and i-butene.

2. Research focuses on the oxidation states of chromium, with consensus indicating that at low loadings, chromium is mainly anchored on alumina as Cr6+ surface species. At higher loadings, chromium also exists as Cr3+, which is less reactive and more stable.

3. The reduction of Cr6+ under dehydrogenation conditions leads to the formation of redox Cr3+ sites, which are active in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina supports seem to stabilize Cr3+ against reduction below the 3+ state, though some studies suggest the presence of Cr2+.

4. The conventional preparation of chromium oxide catalysts involves impregnation with chromium nitrate or chromic acid solutions. However, newer methods such as atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) have been explored to improve the definition of active sites on the support surface.

5. The study demonstrated the preparation of chromium oxide catalysts with a Cr loading up to 12.5 wt.% through ALE, suggesting improvements in catalyst preparation methods over conventional impregnation techniques.

1.X铬氧化物催化剂自1933年发现以来经历了显著发展，对它们的结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解进步促进了它们在脱氢过程中的重要性。这些催化剂现在广泛用于商业上将烷烃转化为丙烯和异丁烯。

2. 研究集中在铬的氧化状态上，共识表明，在低负载下，铬主要以Al2O3表面物种的形式存在于铬6+。在高负载下，铬也存在为Cr3+，这更不活泼且更稳定。

3. 在脱氢条件下，Cr6+的还原导致形成可逆Cr3+位点，这些位点在脱氢反应中是活跃的。氧化铝似乎可以稳定Cr3+防止其在低于3+状态时还原，尽管有些研究也描述了Cr2+的存在。

4. 常规制备铬氧化物催化剂的方法涉及使用铬硝酸盐或重铬酸盐溶液进行浸渍。然而，已经探索了新的方法，如原子层外延（ALE），以改善支持表面上的活性位点定义。

5. 研究显示，通过ALE方法可以制备Cr负载高达12.5 wt.%的铬氧化物催化剂，表明与常规浸渍技术相比，催化剂制备方法有所改进。
