1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, primarily through advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include refining and petrochemical processes, where they are crucial for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.

2. Research focuses on optimizing the catalyst's composition, structure, and support materials to achieve a balance between activity and stability. Promoters, such as alkali metals, are added to enhance catalytic performance. Reaction mechanisms involve the role of chromium ions of various charges, with Cr2+ and Cr3+ playing significant roles in the initial activity and deactivation.

3. Industrial catalysts often contain a small amount of alkali metals, which improve their catalytic properties. The presence of these metals, along with chromium, influences the catalyst's activity and stability. The lattice energy and bond energy differences between y and α forms of alumina contribute to the variation in activity across different chromium-alumina solid solutions.

4. The structure of the catalysts, including the phase diagram in the Cr2O3-Al2O3 system, affects their activity and stability. Higher chromium content leads to faster deactivation, while aluminum-rich solutions tend to be more stable.

5. The dehydrogenation process involves the adsorption of hydrocarbons onto the catalyst surface, followed by the removal of hydrogen atoms to form olefins. This process is facilitated by the presence of active chromium ions, which are responsible for the catalytic activity.

6. The slow deactivation process is linked to the formation of ion pairs containing at least one chromium ion. These ion pairs are more prevalent in aluminum-rich catalysts, explaining their slower deactivation.

7. The activity of industrial catalysts could be improved by synthesizing materials with optimized compositions and structures. Un-supported low-surface area solid solutions sometimes exhibit properties similar to industrial catalysts, indicating potential improvements in activity and stability.

8. The stability of catalysts is closely tied to the distribution and availability of chromium ions. In y solid solutions, the weaker bond between the surface and chemisorbed oxygen allows for a higher number of available chromium ions, contributing to their higher activity.

9. The presence of chromium with high valencies after regeneration of catalysts suggests that the catalyst's activity is influenced by the redox state of the chromium ions. The stabilization of chromium(III+) by γ or δ phases explains the observed effects on activity during the initial period of the dehydrogenation run.

10. Industrial catalysts often require optimization to find the best compromise between activity and stability. Techniques such as impregnation and coprecipitation can lead to catalysts with desired properties, but may not always achieve the optimal balance. X-ray measurements can provide insights into the composition and structure of the catalysts, guiding the development of more effective catalysts.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，主要集中在对其结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解上。关键的工业应用包括精炼和石油化工过程，在这些过程中，它们对于异丁烷的脱氢至关重要。

2. 研究的重点是优化催化剂的组成、结构和支持材料，以实现活动性和稳定性的平衡。添加如碱金属等促进剂可以增强催化性能。反应机制涉及各种价态的铬离子的作用，Cr2+ 和 Cr3+ 在初始活性和失活中起着重要作用。

3. 工业催化剂通常包含少量的碱金属，这些金属提高了其催化性能。铬与铝的组合对催化剂的活性和稳定性产生了影响。不同铬-氧化铝固溶体的活性差异归因于γ和α相之间的晶格能和表面化学吸附氧的能量差异。

4. 催化剂的结构，包括Cr2O3-Al2O3系统的相图，影响其活性和稳定性。高铬含量导致更快的失活，而铝富集的解决方案倾向于更稳定的特性。

5. 脱氢过程涉及烃类化合物在催化剂表面的吸附，随后通过去除氢原子形成烯烃。这一过程由表面上的活性铬离子的催化作用所促进。

6. 失活的缓慢过程与至少含有一个铬离子的离子对的形成有关。这些离子对在铝富集的催化剂中更为常见，解释了它们较慢的失活。

7. 工业催化剂的活性可以通过合成具有优化组成的材料来提高。无支撑低表面积固体溶液有时表现出与工业催化剂类似的特点，表明了提高活性和稳定性的潜力。

8. 催化剂的稳定性与其分布和可用的铬离子密切相关。在γ固溶体中，表面和化学吸附氧之间较弱的键允许存在更多的可用铬离子，从而增加了其活性。

9. 再生后催化剂中存在的高电荷铬的存在表明，催化剂的活性受到铬离子氧化还原状态的影响。γ或δ相对铬(III+)的稳定化解释了在脱氢过程初期活动性变化的现象。

10. 工业催化剂需要优化以找到活动性和稳定性之间的最佳折衷。诸如浸渍和共沉淀等技术可以产生具有所需特性的催化剂，但可能无法总是达到最佳平衡。X射线测量可以提供有关催化剂组成和结构的见解，指导开发更有效的催化剂。

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, initially used in commercial processes for dehydrogenation reactions. Their development has focused on improving structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, incorporating promoters, and understanding reaction mechanisms. These advancements have been crucial in enhancing their efficiency and selectivity in various industries.

2. Key industrial applications of chromium oxide-based catalysts include petrochemical processes, where they are utilized for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Research efforts aim at refining catalyst properties to increase activity, stability, and reduce deactivation rates, ensuring optimal performance in industrial settings.

3. Structure, active sites, support materials, and promoters are central research areas. Studies investigate how the crystalline structure influences catalytic activity and stability. Active sites are often associated with specific ions, such as Cr+ ions, which play crucial roles in dehydrogenation processes. Support materials like alumina enhance the dispersion of active species, while promoters like alkali metals can improve catalyst performance.

4. Reaction mechanisms are another significant area of investigation. Understanding how reactants interact with the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of products, is essential for optimizing catalyst design. This knowledge helps in predicting catalyst behavior under different operating conditions.

5. Chromium oxide-alumina solid solutions, characterized by varying compositions, offer tailored properties for specific applications. The document highlights that catalysts with a low content of chromium ions exhibit high initial activity, while those with a higher content show rapid deactivation. The role of Cr+ ions is emphasized in the initial activity and deactivation processes.

6. The electronic theory and multiplet theory are employed to explain the adsorption of paraffins and products of reactions on chromium oxide surfaces. These theories contribute to understanding the adsorption states, chemisorption strengths, and the life times of surface complexes, influencing catalytic activity.
