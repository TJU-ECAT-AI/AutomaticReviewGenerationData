1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been utilized commercially for dehydrogenation processes since their discovery in 1933. These catalysts undergo rapid deactivation during dehydrogenation and are recycled in cycles with reactivation in an oxidizing atmosphere.

2. Dehydrogenations are straightforward reactions.

3. Chromium ions with a charge of +2 are likely responsible for the initial high activity of the catalysts, which is rapidly inhibited.

4. Reaction byproducts are probably formed via homogeneous reactions within the reference reactor.

5. Chromium oxide (CrO) behaves as a semiconductor of type p in an oxidizing atmosphere and type n in a reducing atmosphere.

6. Information about solid solutions containing chromium and aluminum oxides is scarce.

7. An unarguable description of the adsorption state of a paraffin on CrO in its n state or specifically on a Cr+ action cannot be formulated.

8. The temperature rise during the first minute after introducing a hydrocarbon was negligible for a solid solution with a y phase.

9. The usual active component in Al&-CrO solid solutions seems to be the Cr+ ion.

10. The temperature rise observed during the initial period of the dehydrogenation run is attributed to Cr5+ ions stabilized by r-phases.

1. 自1933年以来，含铬氧化物的催化剂已在商业上用于脱氢反应。这些催化剂在脱氢过程中快速失活，并在氧化气氛中循环再生。

2. 脱氢反应相对简单。

3. +2价的铬离子可能负责催化剂的初始高活性，这种活性很快被抑制。

4. 反应副产品的形成可能是通过参考反应器内的同质反应。

5. 铬氧化物（CrO）在氧化气氛中表现为p型半导体，在还原气氛中表现为n型半导体。

6. 关于含铝氧化物和铬氧化物的固体溶液的信息很少。

7. 对于CrO在n状态或具体在Cr+作用下的吸附状态，无法得出无可争议的描述。

8. 引入烃类后的一分钟内，含有y相的固体溶液中的温度上升很小。

9. Al&-CrO固体溶液中通常活跃的成分似乎是Cr+离子。

10. 初始脱氢运行期间观察到的温度上升归因于r相中稳定化的Cr5+离子。
