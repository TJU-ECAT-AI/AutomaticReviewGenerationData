1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been utilized in commercial processes since their discovery in the early stages of industrial chemistry. They have been widely applied in dehydrogenation processes, which are typically carried out in cycles lasting from 15 minutes (Houdry process) to 2 hours (Phillips process).

2. Dehydrogenation reactions are relatively straightforward. However, considering the deactivation of catalysts during these processes, researchers aim to optimize the reaction conditions and catalyst compositions.

3. The dehydrogenation of isobutane was selected as a test reaction due to its simplicity and potential industrial importance. It offers the advantage of producing minimal side reactions compared to the dehydrogenation of normal butane, where multiple olefin isomers, or even diolfin, might be produced.

4. For the purpose of this discussion, it is beneficial to incorporate insights from electronic theory and multiplet theory to understand the catalytic behavior of chromium oxide-aluminum oxide systems.

5. To analyze the mechanisms underlying the deactivation of catalysts during dehydrogenation processes, researchers utilize theoretical frameworks like electronic theory and multiplet theory.

1. 自从工业化学早期阶段发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经在商业过程中得到应用。它们广泛应用于脱氢化过程，这些过程通常在持续15分钟（胡德里过程）到2小时（菲利普斯过程）的时间内进行循环。

2. 脱氢反应相对简单。然而，考虑到催化剂在这些过程中的失活，研究人员致力于优化反应条件和催化剂组成。

3. 选择异丁烷脱氢作为测试反应的原因是其简单性和潜在的工业重要性。与正常丁烷的脱氢相比，它提供了形成最小副产品的优势，后者可能产生多种烯烃异构体，甚至二烯烃。

4. 对于本讨论的目的，结合电子理论和多重态理论的观点有助于理解铬氧化物-铝氧化物系统的催化行为。

5. 为了分析催化剂在脱氢化过程中失活的机制，研究人员利用电子理论和多重态理论等理论框架进行分析。
