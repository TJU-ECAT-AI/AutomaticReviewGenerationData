1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been utilized commercially since their discovery in 1933, and they play crucial roles in dehydrogenation processes, often undergoing transformation into solid solutions under high temperatures.
2. Dehydrogenation is a straightforward reaction, typically requiring cycles of around 15 minutes (Houdry process) to 2 hours (Phillips process).
3. It's expected that at high temperatures, chromia and alumina react to form solid solutions.
4. Isobutane dehydrogenation was selected as a test reaction because it generates minimal byproducts, unlike normal butane dehydrogenation, which produces various olefin isomers or even diols.
5. Our studies revealed that forming solid solutions with varying chromium oxide (CrO3) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) contents is challenging at low temperatures.
6. Isobutane was chosen as a test reaction due to its ability to undergo dehydrogenation without producing significant byproducts.
7. The advantage of isobutane dehydrogenation lies in its ability to generate isobutene without forming other olefin isomers or diols.
8. Synthesizing solid solutions with chromium oxide content ranging from low to over 50% mol requires high temperatures, as our findings suggest.
9. The active sites in dehydrogenation processes could be identified as the Cr2+-Cr4+ couples, as suggested by Stone for CrO3-rich solid solutions.
10. The interpretation that these active sites might consist of incompletely coordinated ions is plausible but awaits further validation.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂在商业过程中得到了广泛应用，并在脱氢反应中发挥关键作用，通常在高温下转化为固体溶液。
2. 脱氢反应相对简单，典型的周期长度从15分钟（霍德里过程）到2小时（菲利普斯过程）不等。
3. 预计在高温条件下，铬氧化物和氧化铝会发生反应形成固体溶液。
4. 选择异丁烷作为测试反应，因为它在生成异丁烯的同时几乎没有副产品产生，而正常但烷的脱氢则会产生各种烯烃异构体或甚至二烯烃。
5. 我们的研究表明，在较低温度下仅能困难地合成从低CrO3含量到超过50%摩尔CrO3的组成范围的固体溶液。
6. 选择异丁烷作为测试反应是因为它可以进行脱氢而不形成其他烯烃异构体或二烯烃的主要副产品。
7. 异丁烷脱氢的优势在于其仅生成异丁烯，而没有形成其他烯烃异构体或二烯烃。
8. 研究发现，合成具有不同CrO3和Al2O3含量的固体溶液需要较高的温度。
9. 脱氢反应中的活性位点可能是石墨提到的Cr2+-Cr4+对，这是CrO3富集固体溶液的特征。
10. 这些活性位点可能由未完全配位的离子组成的观点是合理的，但需要进一步验证。
