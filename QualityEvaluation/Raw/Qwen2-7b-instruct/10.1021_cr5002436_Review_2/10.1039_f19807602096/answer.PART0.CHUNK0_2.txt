[1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."
[2] "The extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of chromia present on the surface."
[3] "Evidence supporting the presence of Cr2+ ions on the surface has also been provided."
[4] "Preliminary kinetic results suggested that Cr2 + ions, which were identified in the present work, could play some role in the dehydrogenation of ethane by facilitating the breakage of a C-H bond as previously suggested."

The study of chromium oxide-based catalysts has evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, primarily focusing on understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include their use in dehydrogenation processes. The research highlights the importance of chromium ions undergoing oxidation-reduction reactions, with the extent of reduction to Cr2+ ions depending on the concentration of chromia present on the surface. Evidence supports the presence of Cr2+ ions on the catalyst surface, and preliminary kinetic studies suggest that these ions play a crucial role in facilitating the breakage of C-H bonds during ethane dehydrogenation.
