[1] "The surface composition of chromia-alumina catalysts has been investigated."
[2] "Electron spin resonance was used to follow changes in the signal ascribed to Cr3+ ions (at g = 1.986) after reduction in dry hydrogen (Cr' + produced) and in hydrogen + water-vapour mixture at 500C (only Cr3+ produced)."
[3] "Evidence supporting the presence of Cr2+ ions on the surface has also been provided."
[4] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."
[5] "Although surface configuration as well as suggestions as to the valence state of chromium ions have received much attention, no definite conclusion as to the role of the 2 + and 3 + valence states has been reached."
[6] "Preliminary kinetic results of ethane dehydrogenation on these catalysts have also been reported."
[7] "The extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of chromia present on the surface."
[8] "Preliminary kinetic studies show that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ than on Cr3+ sites."
[9] "Chromia-alumina samples containing 1.0, 3.70,4.30, 5.02,6.11 and 11.02 wt % Cr,03 were prepared and examined in the present work."
[10] "The rate of ethane dehydrogenation depends on the initial pressure of ethane which suggested first-order kinetics."
[11] "Although it is early at this stage to give details on the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation, it is, however, reasonable to believe that Cr2+ ions were probably responsible for a high initial activity which was very rapidly inhibited."
[12] "To summarise, catalysts containing known amounts of Cr2 + and Cr3 + on alumina were prepared and examined by e.s.r. which revealed that the extent of reducing Cr3 ' to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of the chromia present on the surface."
[13] "Preliminary kinetic results suggested that Cr2 + ions, which were identified in the present work, could play some role in the dehydrogenation of ethane by facilitating the breakage of a C-H bond as previously suggested."

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly, particularly in the context of dehydrogenation processes. Their industrial applications and research focus areas have expanded to include:

1. Structure: The study of how the structure of the catalyst affects its performance, including the arrangement of chromium oxide and alumina components.
2. Active Sites: Identification and characterization of specific sites on the catalyst surface that are responsible for the catalytic activity, such as Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions.
3. Support Materials: Development of more efficient and stable support materials that enhance the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation reactions.
4. Promoters: Exploration of substances that improve the catalytic properties of chromium oxide-based catalysts, potentially increasing their efficiency in dehydrogenation.
5. Reaction Mechanisms: Understanding the detailed steps involved in dehydrogenation reactions facilitated by these catalysts, particularly the role of Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions in bond-breaking processes.

These advancements have contributed to the significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, leading to improvements in efficiency and selectivity in industrial applications such as petrochemical production.
