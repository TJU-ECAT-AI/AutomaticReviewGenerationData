The study focuses on the surface composition of chromia-alumina catalysts and their catalytic activity. It shows that the extent of reduction to Cr2+ ions depends on the concentration of chromia present on the surface. Kinetic studies indicate that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ sites compared to Cr3+ sites. The presence of Cr2+ ions on the surface is confirmed. The study also highlights that the sensitivity of Cr2+ ions to oxidation by oxygen or water vapor requires careful purification of the gases used. Chemical changes in the surface layer of the catalyst during pretreatment affect its catalytic behavior. The activity of catalysts containing Cr3+ ions might be attributed to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated sites during the loss of water, leading to the creation of OH- groups on the surface. The reaction mechanism involves the conversion of Cr3+ to Cr2+ through the formation of a metal-carbon bond.

研究集中在氧化铝催化剂的表面组成及其催化活性。研究表明，表面铬离子的还原程度取决于表面铬酸盐的浓度。动力学研究表明，乙烷脱氢反应在Cr2+位点的速度比在Cr3+位点快。证实了表面存在Cr2+离子。研究还指出，Cr2+离子对氧或水蒸气的氧化敏感性需要仔细净化所使用的气体。催化剂表面层在预处理过程中发生的化学变化影响其催化性能。含Cr3+离子的催化剂的活性可能归因于水蒸发导致表面形成OH-团簇，进而形成配位不饱和位点。反应机制涉及Cr3+到Cr2+的转化，形成金属-碳键。
