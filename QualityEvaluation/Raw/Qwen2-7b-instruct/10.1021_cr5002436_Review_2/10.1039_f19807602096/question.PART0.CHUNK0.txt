Surface Composition and Catalytic Activity of Chromia-Alumina Catalysts
BY FATHY
M. ASHMAWY?
Chemistry Department, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester M60 1QD Received 9th January, 1980 The surface composition of chromia-alumina catalysts has been investigated. Electron spin resonance was used to follow changes in the signal ascribed to Cr3+ ions (at g = 1.986) after reduction in dry hydrogen (Cr' + produced) and in hydrogen + water-vapour mixture at 500C (only Cr3+ produced). The extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of chromia present on the surface. Preliminary kinetic studies show that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ than on Cr3+ sites. Evidence supporting the presence of Cr2+ ions on the surface has also been provided.One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia- alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions.Although surface configuration as well as suggestions as to the valence state of chromium ions have received much attention,'-' no definite conclusion as to the role of the 2 + and 3 + valence states has been reached.It has been suggested 3 9 that the surface chromium ions are either Cr2+ or Cr3+ depending on the equilibrium : Cr203 +

Preliminary kinetic results of ethane dehydrogenation on these catalysts have also been reported.

The sensitivity of Cr2 + to oxidation by oxygen and/or water vapour necessitated further purifications of the gases used in the present work.
Research grade ethane of 99.9 % purity (Air Products, U.S.A.) was purified by successive condensation and distillation under reduced pressure and at - 196C propane (< 0.05 %) was the chief impurity present. Hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen were high purity products (B.O.C.). The hydrogen was further purified by a Deoxo catalyst followed by a molecular sieve trap and finally a liquid nitrogen trap. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated a purity of at least
99.9 %. Dissolved gases were removed from doubly distilled water by subjecting it to three
successive freeze-evacuate-thaw cycles at liquid nitrogen temperature.
The chromia-alumina catalysts were prepared by impregnation of A120, prepared from Al- isopropoxide by hydrolysis at 100C with chromic acid solutions of different concentrations and On leave from the Faculty of Science, University of Tanta, Tanta, Egypt. 2096 Published on 01 January 1980.

2097 by subsequent drying at 100C and calcining in air at 500C for 5 h before they were finally reduced.
Since Cr,O, is quite stable toward redction,it is essential to consider the thermodynamics of the equilibrium between Cr203 and CrO under reducing conditions.
The standard free energy change at 527C for reaction (1) is AGO = 66.94 kJ.". l 2  This value corresponds to equilibrium constant K = pH,O/pH, = 3 x Therefore, for hydro- gen partial pressure of one atmosphere, water partial pressure must exceed 3 x lop5 atm to prevent reduction to CrO.
In the present work two types of reductions were carried out at 500C and at 1 atm pressure for 8 h followed by outgassing at 500C for 1 h :(i) catalysts reduced in carefully purified and dried hydrogen (Cr2 + produced) ;(ii) reduction with hydrogen saturated with water vapour (only Cr3 + produced), this was achieved by allowing hydrogen to flow through a water trap maintained at room temperature. Saturation of the hydrogen with water vapour was sufficient to reoxidise Cr2+ to Cr3+ according to reaction (1).
Chromia-alumina samples containing 1.0, 3.70,4.30, 5.02,6.11 and 11.02 wt % Cr,03 were prepared and examined in the present work.
The oxidation-reduction treatments were carried out in a silica reaction vessel attached to an all glass system which could be evacuated to lop6 Torr. The rate of ethane dehydrogenation was followed by measuring the pressure change in a constant volume reaction vessel. The product, ethylene, was identified by mass analysis using an A.E.I. type MSlO mass spectrometer.
The e.s.r. measurements were carried out on a Decca type XI spectrometer. The intensities of the e.s.r. signals were calculated from the experimental first derivative signals of the samples and the spin calibrant (CuSO, . 5H,O, 5.731 x 10" spin g-').The spin concentrations were reproducible to better than 10 %. All the e.s.r. measurements were made at room temperature.

A sharp signal, near 3300 G of line width of 50 G, which has its origin in the Cr5+ ions,I3 was observed in all oxidized catalysts at 500"C, fig. l(c) and 2(c). This signal disappeared completely upon reduction at 500C. No attention was given to this signal since it has been shown that Cr5+ ions play no role in dehydrogenation reactions.' All the oxidized catalysts except the 1.0 wt % Cr203-A1,03 are characterized by the presence of a broad signal near 1500 G which is caused by isolated Cr3+ ions l 3 (6- phase). The &phase disappeared completely in the oxidized 1.0 wt % catalyst which was due to the formation of the diamagnetic Cr6+ ions. However, upon reduction at 500C the &phase reappeared. This indicates that at lower chromia concentrations almost all of the chromium ions are on the surface. This behaviour was not observed for catalysts with higher chromia concentrations, fig. 2(c),where some of the Cr3 + in the &phase resisted oxidation at 500C.The characteristic broad spectrum near 2400 G,which has its origin in Cr3 + ions in strong interaction (fl-phase),was obtained upon reducing the samples with hydrogen saturated with water vapour at 5OO0C,fig. 2(a). A further reduction in the spectrum,fig. 2(b),was also seen when the catalyst was reduced with dry hydrogen at 500C followed by evacuation at the same temperature [see also fig. l(b)]. This further reduction is believed to be due to the formation of Cr2 + ions (these do not give e.s.r. signals at room temperature).No reduction in the e.s.r. signals was observed for catalysts treated with dry hydrogen at temperatures below 500C. It is doubtful, therefore, that reduction to Cr2 + would occur below that temperature.It is important to see from fig. 3 that the extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends not only on the partial pressure of water vapour, but also on the amount of the chromia Published on 01 January 1980.

was carried out on some of the catalysts reduced with dry hydrogen. These were treated with water which had previously been outgassed. The amount of water adsorbed was in the range of 1.5 x No hydrogen was detected at room temperature and no increases in the 6- or P-phase signals were observed. However, by heating the catalysts at z 600C hydrogen was liberated. The number of moles of hydrogen liberated per the total chromium present per gram of catalyst were calculated and were related to the equivalent amount of Cr2 +. These results are depicted in fig. 3 where it can be seen that the amount of Cr2 + per total chromium calculated from this experiment is less than that obtained from the e.s.r. measurements. This may be explained as being due to diffusion of some Cr2+ ions into the interior of the support (solid solution) and therefore they were not accessible to react with the water adsorbed. mol (g catalyst)- '.Published on 01 January 1980.

It is clearly possible, as seen from the trend of the results in fig- 3, that at the lowest chromium concentrations essentially all of the chromium ions have been reduced to Cr2 +. On the other hand, at higher chromia concentrations bulk chromia (P-phase) is formed on the surface where the degree and ease of reduction to Cr2+ may be affected by a stabilizing influence exerted by the alumina lattice.
Burwell et aL3 have suggested a mechanism for reducing Cr3+ to Cr2+ where hydrogen reacts as two protons to convert two oxide ions to hydroxide ions and the electrons reduce Cr3 + to Cr2 + One can imagine, therefore, that the reverse of the above mechanism would lead to The liberation of hydrogen in our the desorption of hydrogen upon water treatment. experiments seems to agree with this mechanism.

The latter was demonstrated by testing the activities of the catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation.
The reaction was carried out at 527"C, which was slightly above the activation temperature of the catalyst. The 5.02 wt % Cr203-A1203 catalyst was examined and was found to be active at the initial stage of the reaction.
Preliminary studies showed that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation depends on the initial pressure of ethane which suggested first-order kinetics.
The results depicted in fig. 4 show that the rate of dehydrogenation proceeds much faster on catalysts containing Cr2+ ions. Although it is early at this stage to give details on the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation, it is, however, reasonable to believe that Cr2+ ions were probably responsible for a high initial activity which was very rapidly inhibited. that the role of Cr2+ in alkane dehydrogenation is to facilitate the breakage of a C-H bond through (a) incomplete coordination of surface metal ions and (b) the formation of metal-carbon bond of sufficient stability. The fulfilment of these requirements is favoured when the metal has a low effective nuclear charge which is accomplished in a low oxidation state.
It is, however, important to mention that the activity of catalysts containing Cr3 + ions, prepared and activated in the present work, may be due to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated sites (c.u.s.) during loss of water by condensation involving surface OH- groups : It has been suggested previously Cr2 + seems to fulfil the above requirements.
