[1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."
[2] "Preliminary kinetic studies show that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ than on Cr3+ sites."
[3] "Evidence supporting the presence of Cr2+ ions on the surface has also been provided."
[4] "The extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of chromia present on the surface."
[5] "Preliminary kinetic results of ethane dehydrogenation on these catalysts have also been reported."
[6] "The surface chromium ions are either Cr2+ or Cr3+ depending on the equilibrium."
[7] "It is clear from the above results that marked chemical changes take place in the surface layer of supported chromia during various pretreatments, which might lead to differences in catalytic behaviour."
[8] "The latter was demonstrated by testing the activities of the catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation."
