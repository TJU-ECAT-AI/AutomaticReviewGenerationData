[1] "The surface composition of chromia-alumina catalysts has been investigated."
[2] "Evidence supporting the presence of Cr2+ ions on the surface has also been provided."
[3] "The extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of chromia present on the surface."
[4] "Preliminary kinetic results of ethane dehydrogenation on these catalysts have also been reported."
[5] "It is clear from the above results that marked chemical changes take place in the surface layer of supported chromia during various pretreatments, which might lead to differences in catalytic behaviour."
[6] "Although it is early at this stage to give details on the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation, it is, however, reasonable to believe that Cr2+ ions were probably responsible for a high initial activity which was very rapidly inhibited."
[7] "The role of Cr2+ in alkane dehydrogenation is to facilitate the breakage of a C-H bond through (a) incomplete coordination of surface metal ions and (b) the formation of metal-carbon bond of sufficient stability."
[8] "The activity of catalysts containing Cr3 + ions, prepared and activated in the present work, may be due to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated sites (c.u.s.) during loss of water by condensation involving surface OH- groups."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have undergone significant evolution since their discovery in 1933, particularly in the context of their industrial applications and research focus areas. Key advancements include improvements in catalyst structure, identification of active sites, selection of support materials, incorporation of promoters, and elucidation of reaction mechanisms.

2. The research primarily focuses on understanding the surface chemistry of these catalysts, specifically the behavior of chromium ions in different oxidation states (Cr2+ and Cr3+) and their impact on catalytic activity. Studies investigate how the presence and concentration of chromium oxide affect the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation processes.

3. The presence of Cr2+ ions plays a crucial role in the initial high activity of catalysts during ethane dehydrogenation, though this activity is quickly inhibited. The mechanism involves facilitating the breaking of a C-H bond through incomplete coordination of surface metal ions and the formation of a stable metal-carbon bond.

4. The activity of catalysts containing Cr3+ ions can be attributed to the creation of coordinatively unsaturated sites (c.u.s.) during the loss of water, which may involve surface OH groups. This process contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness in alkane dehydrogenation.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展，特别是在其工业应用和研究重点领域。关键进展包括催化剂结构的改进、活性位点的识别、支持材料的选择、促进剂的引入以及反应机理的阐明。

2. 研究主要集中在理解这些催化剂的表面化学特性，特别是不同氧化状态（Cr2+和Cr3+）的铬离子行为及其对催化活性的影响。研究探讨了铬氧化物的存在和浓度如何影响催化剂在脱氢过程中的性能。

3. Cr2+离子在乙烷脱氢过程中初期高活性的出现至关重要，但这种活性很快被抑制。该机制涉及通过表面金属离子的不完全配位和形成足够稳定的金属碳键来促进C-H键的断裂。

4. 含有Cr3+离子的催化剂的活性可以归因于水丢失过程中表面OH基团参与下形成的配位不饱和位点（c.u.s.）。这一过程有助于催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的有效性。
