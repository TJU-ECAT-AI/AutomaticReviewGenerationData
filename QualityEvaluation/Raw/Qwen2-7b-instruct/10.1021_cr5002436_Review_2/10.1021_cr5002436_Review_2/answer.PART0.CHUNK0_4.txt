4.2 Chromium Oxide-Based Catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933. During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels. These catalysts have been applied to several processes for the dehydrogenation of light olefins henceforth.

The nature of the active sites involves understanding the exact nature of CrO sites where paraffin molecules adsorb. On freshly prepared catalysts, various surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, have been identified. Chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia, and amorphous chromia have also been identified through various techniques. The relative concentration of these species depends on factors like chromium loading, calcination treatment, and the support employed.

Prior to the 1990s, studying the structure of chromium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts was limited due to the lack of in situ spectroscopic techniques. These techniques allowed researchers to observe that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction. Consequently, Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, and a mixture of both Cr3+ and Cr2+ have been proposed as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

Nuclearity, the need for a highly dispersed active phase, is highlighted by the fact that activity first rises with increasing chromium loading but drops when crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming. Three different types of Cr3+ ions have been spectroscopically detected at these loadings, suggesting that both isolated and clustered Cr3+ centers are catalytically active.

Selectivity changes over time, with the selectivity toward alkenes initially being low and the catalyst producing mainly carbon oxides. Eventually, a high selectivity of 93.6% can be reached at a conversion of 55%.

Catalyst deactivation occurs over the course of a catalytic cycle due to the deposition of coke. The weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages of the reaction, but conversion continues to drop beyond this point. After each reaction-regeneration cycle, the catalyst regains most of its activity, but the loss of activity is not entirely reversible. The heat released during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, causing the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step.

The nature of the support is crucial for both the mechanical properties of the catalyst and the interaction of the carrier with the active phase. Alumina is the most common support, but alternatives like zirconia and silica have also been investigated. Zirconia is considered a viable substitute for alumina due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a relatively high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites.

Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This is attributed to their ability to stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and/or increase the number of active chromium sites.

In summary, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Industrial applications include dehydrogenation processes for producing high-octane aviation fuels. Key research focus areas include the structure of the catalysts, the nature of active sites, the role of support materials, the use of promoters, and the mechanisms of the dehydrogenation reaction.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by significant advancements in their industrial applications and research focus areas. These catalysts have been pivotal in dehydrogenation processes, notably for the production of high-octane aviation fuels. Since the initial reports by Frey and Huppke, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina have been utilized to dehydrogenate butane into butene, which are then dimerized and hydrogenated for fuel production. The application scope has expanded to cover multiple processes for the dehydrogenation of light olefins.

Key industrial applications and research focus areas include:
1. **Structure of Catalysts**: Understanding the precise nature of active sites, such as CrO sites where paraffin molecules adsorb, has been crucial. Freshly prepared catalysts exhibit a range of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. Techniques like Raman spectroscopy have been instrumental in identifying chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia, and amorphous chromia, with the relative concentration influenced by factors like chromium loading, calcination treatment, and support type.
   
2. **Active Sites**: The nature of active sites has been extensively studied, focusing on the role of CrO sites in dehydrogenation reactions. Surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the reaction, leading to the identification of Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, and a mixture of both as potential active sites. This has been confirmed through spectroscopic analysis, highlighting the importance of nuclearity, dispersion, and coordination in determining catalytic activity.

3. **Support Materials**: The choice of support material is critical for both the mechanical integrity of the catalyst and the interaction between the active phase and the support. Alumina remains the most commonly used support, but alternatives such as zirconia and silica have been explored for their unique properties. Zirconia, in particular, has gained attention due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, making it a viable substitute for alumina in dehydrogenation catalysts.

4. **Promoters**: Alkali metals, including K, Rb, and Cs, have been recognized for their ability to promote both activity and selectivity in chromium-based catalysts. Their role in stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the dispersion of active sites has been pivotal in enhancing catalytic performance.

5. **Reaction Mechanisms**: While detailed mechanisms of the dehydrogenation reaction over chromium oxide-based catalysts have not been fully elucidated, studies have focused on understanding the role of active sites, the influence of support materials, and the effects of promoters. Research has also delved into the structural changes within the catalysts during the reaction cycle, including the formation and dissolution of active Cr species, and the impact of regeneration steps on catalyst performance.

In summary, the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been characterized by advancements in their application across dehydrogenation processes, alongside concurrent developments in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts continue to be refined for improved efficiency and selectivity in industrial applications, reflecting ongoing research efforts aimed at optimizing their performance for various chemical transformations.
