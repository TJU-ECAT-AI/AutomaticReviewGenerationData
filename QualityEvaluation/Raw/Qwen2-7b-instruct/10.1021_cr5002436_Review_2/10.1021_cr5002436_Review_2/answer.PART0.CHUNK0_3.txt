4.2 Chromium Oxide-Based Catalysts
Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933. (143)
During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels.
Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied.
Nature of the Active Sites
Because the adsorption of paraffin molecules takes place on CrO sites, understanding the exact nature of these species under dehydrogenation reaction conditions is critically important.
Prior to the 1990s, the study of the structure of chromium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts had been restricted to conditions far removed from those found under real operation.
Role of the Support
The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.
Role of the Promoters
Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been extensively researched since their initial discovery in 1933. They gained prominence due to their industrial application in dehydrogenating butane into butene for high-octane aviation fuel production. Research efforts have centered on the catalyst's structure under various reaction conditions, the identification of active sites, the role of the support material, the impact of alkali metal promoters, and the mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions. Understanding the active sites and the nature of the adsorption of paraffin molecules on CrO sites is crucial. Prior studies focused on conditions far from real-world operations. The nature of the support plays a significant role in the catalyst's performance, affecting both its mechanical properties and catalytic activity. Alkali metals, such as potassium, rubidium, and cesium, have been found to enhance both the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经进行了广泛的研究。它们因在将丁烷脱氢为丁烯以生产高辛烷值航空燃料方面的工业应用而获得了重要性。研究工作集中在催化剂在不同反应条件下的结构、活性位点的识别、载体材料的作用、促进剂对活性的影响以及脱氢反应机制。理解活性位点和正构烷烃分子在CrO位点的吸附性质至关重要。早期研究关注的是远离实际操作条件的情况。支持材料的性质对催化剂性能具有重要意义，不仅影响其机械性能，还影响催化活性。钾、铷和铯等碱金属已被发现能够提高铬基脱氢催化剂的活性和选择性。
