4.2 Chromium Oxide-Based Catalysts
Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933. (143)
During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels. These catalysts have been applied to several processes for the dehydrogenation of light olefins henceforth. (26)
Prior to the 1990s, the study of the structure of chromium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts had been restricted to conditions far removed from those found under real operation. (151)
With respect to nuclearity, the need for a highly dispersed active phase is highlighted by the fact that, while activity first rises with increasing chromium loading, a drop in activity is observed when the loading is such that crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming, as illustrated in Figure 16. (163-165)
In conclusion, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions. (171, 173)
Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated. (29)
The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity. (193)

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 includes their application in industrial processes, such as dehydrogenating butane to produce butene for high-octane aviation fuels. Research focuses on the catalyst's structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms to achieve high activity and selectivity. The catalysts' activity declines over time due to coke deposition, necessitating periodic regeneration. The choice of support affects both the catalyst's mechanical properties and its activity and selectivity.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展包括它们在工业过程中的应用，如将丁烷脱氢为丁烯以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。研究重点在于催化剂的结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制，以实现高活性和选择性。由于焦炭沉积导致催化剂活性下降，需要定期再生。支撑材料的选择不仅影响催化剂的机械性能，还影响其活性和选择性。
