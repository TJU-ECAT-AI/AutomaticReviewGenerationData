[1] "Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933."
[2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."
[3] "The study of the structure of chromium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts had been restricted to conditions far removed from those found under real operation."
[4] "This phenomenon has been measured by UVvis spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 18."
[5] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[6] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."
[7] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."
[8] "Additionally, the presence of alkali metal promoters increases the dispersion of the active phase by assisting the formation under oxidizing conditions of Cr6+ complexes that subsequently give rise to Cr3+ under a reducing atmosphere."
[9] "The method used for introducing Cr into the LDH precursors was found to determine several properties of the resulting mixed oxides, such as surface area, catalytic performance, coking resistance, and thermal stability against sintering."
[10] "Interestingly, it has been observed that while the selectivity of this material toward cracking decreases with time-on-stream, its selectivity toward the alkene tends to remain constant."

Answer: 

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts, initially reported by Frey and Huppke in 1933, have undergone extensive investigation since then. In the 1940s, these catalysts were used industrially by UOP to dehydrogenate butane into butene, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuels. The structure of these catalysts under real operational conditions remained a subject of limited study until in situ spectroscopic techniques became available.

2. The incorporation of chromium oxide into the alumina framework through sintering affects the catalyst's activity. The similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, leading to the formation of an inactive chromia-alumina spinel.

Answer: 

1. 铬氧化物基催化剂自1933年由弗莱和胡普克首次报告其脱氢活性以来，一直在积极研究。在20世纪40年代，这些催化剂被UOP用于工业上将丁烷脱氢成丁烯，然后将其二聚并氢化为高辛烷值航空燃料。直到原位光谱技术出现，对这些催化剂在实际操作条件下的结构的研究才受到限制。

2. 铬氧化物被整合到氧化铝框架中通过烧结影响催化剂的活性。铝3+和铬3+相似的离子半径和电荷使得铬3+能够扩散并随后被整合到氧化铝的八面体位点中，导致形成一种不活跃的铬氧化物-氧化铝尖晶石。
