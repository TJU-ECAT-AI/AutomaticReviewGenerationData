4.2 Chromium Oxide-Based Catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933.
Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied.
Nature of the Active Sites Understanding the exact nature of CrO sites under dehydrogenation reaction conditions is critically important. Freshly prepared catalysts exhibit various surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. These species' relative concentration depends on factors like chromium loading, calcination treatment, and support used.
Prior to the 1990s, studying the structure of chromium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts was limited to conditions far removed from real operation. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques allowed probing these catalysts under reaction conditions. It was observed that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction.
Albeit selectivity is insensitive to chromium loading, it changes over time. High activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts can be achieved by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or operating conditions.
Catalyst Deactivation Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose activity due to coke deposition. The weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time. However, conversion continues to drop beyond this point, indicating that the carbon originally deposited becomes more detrimental for catalytic activity over time.
The role of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.
Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and/or increase the number of active chromium sites.

Dehydrogenation activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts has significantly evolved since their initial discovery in 1933. Initially used industrially to dehydrogenate butane to produce butene for high-octane aviation fuels, these catalysts have been widely applied to several processes for dehydrogenating light olefins. Key research focuses include the catalyst's structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support material, the impact of alkali metal promoters, and the reaction mechanisms involved.

The structure of chromium oxide-based catalysts was historically limited to conditions far from real operation until the advent of in situ spectroscopic techniques. These advancements allowed researchers to probe catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction.

Selectivity towards alkenes initially remains low during the induction period, as highly oxidized, inactive chromium species are reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states. Over time, a high selectivity of up to 93.6% can be reached at a conversion of 55%.

The nature of the active sites includes both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ ions, which are critical for high activity and selectivity. Other factors such as the origin of Cr3+ species, the addition of CO2 as a mild oxidant, and the operating conditions also influence the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts.

Catalysts lose activity due to coke deposition over time, but the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages of the reaction. Activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane, while alkane conversion is inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity is directly proportional to alkene selectivity.

Support materials, such as alumina, zirconia, and silica, play crucial roles in governing the mechanical properties of the catalyst and influencing catalyst activity and selectivity. The interaction between the carrier and the active phase can profoundly impact catalytic performance.

Alkali metals, like potassium, rubidium, and cesium, promote both the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts by stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the number of active chromium sites. However, doping with certain alkali metals like potassium can decrease activity in some cases.

自1933年首次报道铬氧化物的脱氢活性以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的活性已经显著发展。最初，它们被用于工业上将丁烷脱氢为丁烯以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。这些催化剂已被广泛应用于多种轻质烯烃的脱氢过程。关键的研究焦点包括催化剂在不同反应条件下的结构、活性位点的性质、载体材料的作用、碱金属促进剂的影响以及脱氢反应机制。

早期对铬氧化物基催化剂结构的研究局限于与实际操作条件相去甚远的条件。直到开发出原位光谱技术，研究人员才得以在反应条件下研究催化剂，发现表面Cr3+物种在脱氢反应初期以牺牲Cr6+物种的形式产生。

在诱导期初期，选择性向烯烃的转变率较低，因为高度氧化且不活性的铬物种被还原为具有较低氧化状态的活性铬物种。随着时间的推移，可以达到高达93.6%的选择性，转化率为55%。

活性位点包括分散和配位不饱和的Cr3+离子，这是实现高活性和选择性的关键。其他因素如Cr3+物种的起源、CO2作为温和氧化剂的添加以及操作条件也影响铬脱氢催化剂的活性。

由于焦炭沉积导致催化剂失活，但催化剂的重量在反应初期阶段增加。活性与反应温度和烷烃的部分压力成正比，而烷烃转化率与空间速度成反比，选择性与烯烃选择性成正比。

支持材料，如氧化铝、氧化锆和二氧化硅，在决定催化剂的机械性能和催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。载体与活性相之间的相互作用可以深远地影响催化性能。

钾、铷和铯等碱金属通过稳定支撑结构、降低表面酸度和增加活性铬物种的数量来促进铬基脱氢催化剂的活性和选择性。然而，在某些情况下，添加钾等碱金属可能会降低活性。

Answer: 

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts, initially reported by Frey and Huppke in 1933, have undergone extensive investigation since then. In the 1940s, these catalysts were used industrially by UOP to dehydrogenate butane into butene, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuels. The structure of these catalysts under real operational conditions remained a subject of limited study until in situ spectroscopic techniques became available.

2. The incorporation of chromium oxide into the alumina framework through sintering affects the catalyst's activity. The similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, leading to the formation of an inactive chromia-alumina spinel.

Answer: 

1. 铬氧化物基催化剂自1933年由弗莱和胡普克首次报告其脱氢活性以来，一直在积极研究。在20世纪40年代，这些催化剂被UOP用于工业上将丁烷脱氢成丁烯，然后将其二聚并氢化为高辛烷值航空燃料。直到原位光谱技术出现，对这些催化剂在实际操作条件下的结构的研究才受到限制。

2. 铬氧化物被整合到氧化铝框架中通过烧结影响催化剂的活性。铝3+和铬3+相似的离子半径和电荷使得铬3+能够扩散并随后被整合到氧化铝的八面体位点中，导致形成一种不活跃的铬氧化物-氧化铝尖晶石。

(163-165)
In conclusion, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions. (171, 173)
Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated. (29)
The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity. (193)

4.2 Chromium Oxide-Based Catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933. During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels. These catalysts have been applied to several processes for the dehydrogenation of light olefins henceforth.

The nature of the active sites involves understanding the exact nature of CrO sites where paraffin molecules adsorb. On freshly prepared catalysts, various surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, have been identified. Chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia, and amorphous chromia have also been identified through various techniques. The relative concentration of these species depends on factors like chromium loading, calcination treatment, and the support employed.

Prior to the 1990s, studying the structure of chromium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts was limited due to the lack of in situ spectroscopic techniques. These techniques allowed researchers to observe that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction. Consequently, Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, and a mixture of both Cr3+ and Cr2+ have been proposed as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

Nuclearity, the need for a highly dispersed active phase, is highlighted by the fact that activity first rises with increasing chromium loading but drops when crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming. Three different types of Cr3+ ions have been spectroscopically detected at these loadings, suggesting that both isolated and clustered Cr3+ centers are catalytically active.

Selectivity changes over time, with the selectivity toward alkenes initially being low and the catalyst producing mainly carbon oxides. Eventually, a high selectivity of 93.6% can be reached at a conversion of 55%.

Catalyst deactivation occurs over the course of a catalytic cycle due to the deposition of coke. The weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages of the reaction, but conversion continues to drop beyond this point. After each reaction-regeneration cycle, the catalyst regains most of its activity, but the loss of activity is not entirely reversible. The heat released during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, causing the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step.

The nature of the support is crucial for both the mechanical properties of the catalyst and the interaction of the carrier with the active phase. Alumina is the most common support, but alternatives like zirconia and silica have also been investigated. Zirconia is considered a viable substitute for alumina due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a relatively high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites.

Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This is attributed to their ability to stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and/or increase the number of active chromium sites.

In summary, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Industrial applications include dehydrogenation processes for producing high-octane aviation fuels. Key research focus areas include the structure of the catalysts, the nature of active sites, the role of support materials, the use of promoters, and the mechanisms of the dehydrogenation reaction.

This has been confirmed through spectroscopic analysis, highlighting the importance of nuclearity, dispersion, and coordination in determining catalytic activity.

3. **Support Materials**: The choice of support material is critical for both the mechanical integrity of the catalyst and the interaction between the active phase and the support. Alumina remains the most commonly used support, but alternatives such as zirconia and silica have been explored for their unique properties. Zirconia, in particular, has gained attention due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, making it a viable substitute for alumina in dehydrogenation catalysts.

4. **Promoters**: Alkali metals, including K, Rb, and Cs, have been recognized for their ability to promote both activity and selectivity in chromium-based catalysts. Their role in stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the dispersion of active sites has been pivotal in enhancing catalytic performance.

5. **Reaction Mechanisms**: While detailed mechanisms of the dehydrogenation reaction over chromium oxide-based catalysts have not been fully elucidated, studies have focused on understanding the role of active sites, the influence of support materials, and the effects of promoters. Research has also delved into the structural changes within the catalysts during the reaction cycle, including the formation and dissolution of active Cr species, and the impact of regeneration steps on catalyst performance.

In summary, the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been characterized by advancements in their application across dehydrogenation processes, alongside concurrent developments in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts continue to be refined for improved efficiency and selectivity in industrial applications, reflecting ongoing research efforts aimed at optimizing their performance for various chemical transformations.
