4.2 Chromium Oxide-Based Catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933.
Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied.
Nature of the Active Sites Understanding the exact nature of CrO sites under dehydrogenation reaction conditions is critically important. Freshly prepared catalysts exhibit various surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. These species' relative concentration depends on factors like chromium loading, calcination treatment, and support used.
Prior to the 1990s, studying the structure of chromium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts was limited to conditions far removed from real operation. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques allowed probing these catalysts under reaction conditions. It was observed that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction.
Albeit selectivity is insensitive to chromium loading, it changes over time. High activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts can be achieved by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or operating conditions.
Catalyst Deactivation Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose activity due to coke deposition. The weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time. However, conversion continues to drop beyond this point, indicating that the carbon originally deposited becomes more detrimental for catalytic activity over time.
The role of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.
Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and/or increase the number of active chromium sites.

Dehydrogenation activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts has significantly evolved since their initial discovery in 1933. Initially used industrially to dehydrogenate butane to produce butene for high-octane aviation fuels, these catalysts have been widely applied to several processes for dehydrogenating light olefins. Key research focuses include the catalyst's structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support material, the impact of alkali metal promoters, and the reaction mechanisms involved.

The structure of chromium oxide-based catalysts was historically limited to conditions far from real operation until the advent of in situ spectroscopic techniques. These advancements allowed researchers to probe catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction.

Selectivity towards alkenes initially remains low during the induction period, as highly oxidized, inactive chromium species are reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states. Over time, a high selectivity of up to 93.6% can be reached at a conversion of 55%.

The nature of the active sites includes both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ ions, which are critical for high activity and selectivity. Other factors such as the origin of Cr3+ species, the addition of CO2 as a mild oxidant, and the operating conditions also influence the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts.

Catalysts lose activity due to coke deposition over time, but the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages of the reaction. Activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane, while alkane conversion is inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity is directly proportional to alkene selectivity.

Support materials, such as alumina, zirconia, and silica, play crucial roles in governing the mechanical properties of the catalyst and influencing catalyst activity and selectivity. The interaction between the carrier and the active phase can profoundly impact catalytic performance.

Alkali metals, like potassium, rubidium, and cesium, promote both the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts by stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the number of active chromium sites. However, doping with certain alkali metals like potassium can decrease activity in some cases.

自1933年首次报道铬氧化物的脱氢活性以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的活性已经显著发展。最初，它们被用于工业上将丁烷脱氢为丁烯以生产高辛烷值航空燃料。这些催化剂已被广泛应用于多种轻质烯烃的脱氢过程。关键的研究焦点包括催化剂在不同反应条件下的结构、活性位点的性质、载体材料的作用、碱金属促进剂的影响以及脱氢反应机制。

早期对铬氧化物基催化剂结构的研究局限于与实际操作条件相去甚远的条件。直到开发出原位光谱技术，研究人员才得以在反应条件下研究催化剂，发现表面Cr3+物种在脱氢反应初期以牺牲Cr6+物种的形式产生。

在诱导期初期，选择性向烯烃的转变率较低，因为高度氧化且不活性的铬物种被还原为具有较低氧化状态的活性铬物种。随着时间的推移，可以达到高达93.6%的选择性，转化率为55%。

活性位点包括分散和配位不饱和的Cr3+离子，这是实现高活性和选择性的关键。其他因素如Cr3+物种的起源、CO2作为温和氧化剂的添加以及操作条件也影响铬脱氢催化剂的活性。

由于焦炭沉积导致催化剂失活，但催化剂的重量在反应初期阶段增加。活性与反应温度和烷烃的部分压力成正比，而烷烃转化率与空间速度成反比，选择性与烯烃选择性成正比。

支持材料，如氧化铝、氧化锆和二氧化硅，在决定催化剂的机械性能和催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。载体与活性相之间的相互作用可以深远地影响催化性能。

钾、铷和铯等碱金属通过稳定支撑结构、降低表面酸度和增加活性铬物种的数量来促进铬基脱氢催化剂的活性和选择性。然而，在某些情况下，添加钾等碱金属可能会降低活性。
