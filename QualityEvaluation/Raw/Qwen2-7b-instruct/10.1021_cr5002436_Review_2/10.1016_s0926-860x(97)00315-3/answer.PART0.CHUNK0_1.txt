<p>Interest was mainly focused on the zirconia support, but alumina and silica were also examined for comparison.</p>
<p>As given above, it was considered worthwhile to extend the studies giving attention to systems with higher loading of chromium, thereby moving towards systems whose surface chemistry approaches that of industrial catalysts.</p>
<p>It is noted that the discrepancies are always in the same direction. In fact, the turnover frequency estimate of the concentrated samples is always higher than that of the dilute catalysts.</p>

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved since their discovery in 1933 to become significant in dehydrogenation processes due to their industrial applications and research focus areas. Key applications include propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization and isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. Research focuses on catalyst structures, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms.

2. The dehydrogenation activity per total chromium atom is notably higher for zirconia-based catalysts compared to alumina- and silica-based catalysts.

3. There is a proportionality found between activity and high-oxidation state chromium, indicating the involvement of high-oxidation state chromium species in generating catalytic activity.

4. The higher activity per high-oxidation state chromium atom of the zirconia-based system is attributed to the higher concentration of mononuclear chromium(V) species on zirconia, which reduce to active mononuclear chromium(III) species under reaction conditions.

5. The practical application of the chromium/zirconia system as a dehydrogenation catalyst relies on stabilizing high surface area zirconia at working temperatures without altering the positive chromium support interaction that benefits catalytic activity.

1. 自1933年发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂通过其工业应用和研究重点领域（包括催化剂结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂以及反应机制）在脱氢过程中变得重要。关键应用包括丙烷脱氢为丙烯用于聚合和异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯。研究焦点在于催化剂结构、活性中心、支持材料、助剂以及反应过程。

2. 铬负载量更高的催化剂系统的脱氢活性相对于氧化铝和二氧化硅基催化剂系统而言显著提高。

3. 发现了活性与高氧化态铬之间的比例关系，这表明高氧化态铬物种参与了催化活性的产生。

4. 钛酸盐基系统中每高氧化态铬原子更高的活性部分归因于钛酸盐上较高的单核铬(V)物种浓度，这些物种在反应条件下还原为活性单核铬(III)物种。

5. 实际应用钛酸盐/铬催化剂作为脱氢催化剂依赖于在工作温度下稳定高表面面积钛酸盐而不改变对支持表面的有利铬相互作用，这一相互作用有利于催化剂活性。
