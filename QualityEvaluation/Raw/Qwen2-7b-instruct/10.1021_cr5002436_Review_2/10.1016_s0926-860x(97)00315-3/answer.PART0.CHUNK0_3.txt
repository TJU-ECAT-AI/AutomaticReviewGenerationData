<p>The present investigation has examined structural and catalytic properties of numerous chromia/zirconia, chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica catalysts,covering a wide range of Cr concentration.</p>
<p>This study allows some final conclusion to be drawn:(i) several Cr species are present on the surface of the investigated catalysts in amounts depending on the specific support and Cr concentration.</p>
<p>(ii) the dehydrogenation activity per total Cr atom is substantially higher for zirconia-based catalysts than for g-alumina- and silica-based ones.</p>
<p>(iii) a proportionality is found between activity and high-oxidation state Cr, thus indicating the involvement of high-oxidation state Cr species in generating the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>(iv) the higher activity per high-oxidation state Cr atom of the zirconia-based system is thought to be related to the higher concentration on zirconia of mononuclear CrV species, which reduce to the active mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions.</p>
<p>(v) the practical application of the chromia/ zirconia system, as dehydrogenation catalyst, relies upon the stabilization of high surface area ZrO2 at the working temperature. This stabilization would necessarily involve some changes in the surface properties of zirconia. The goal would be to obtain this stabilization without altering the positive Cr support interaction, which is beneficial for the catalytic activity.</p>

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include alkane dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of propene from propane and isobutene from isobutane. Research focuses on optimizing the catalyst structure to enhance activity, stability, and selectivity. Key areas of investigation include the identification of specific Cr species on the catalyst surface, their role in catalytic activity, and the interaction between Cr and the support material. Promoters such as alkali oxides are used to improve catalyst performance. Reaction mechanisms explore how Cr species undergo reduction to form active sites that facilitate dehydrogenation reactions. The goal is to develop catalysts that efficiently convert alkanes to alkenes while minimizing byproduct formation and maintaining high activity over multiple reaction cycles.

The significance of chromium oxide catalysts lies in their ability to operate under mild conditions, reducing energy requirements and improving efficiency in industrial processes. The zirconia-based catalysts stand out due to their superior dehydrogenation activity, which is attributed to the stabilization of high surface area zirconia at operating temperatures, maintaining a favorable Cr-support interaction. Mononuclear CrV species, which reduce to mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions, are believed to play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of zirconia-based catalysts. The practical application of these catalysts in dehydrogenation relies on stabilizing the zirconia support without compromising the positive effects of the Cr-support interaction.

To summarize, the evolution of chromium oxide catalysts has been driven by a deepening understanding of their structure-function relationships, optimization of active sites, and development of strategies to maintain high activity and selectivity under industrial conditions. The zirconia-based catalysts represent a significant advancement in this field, offering improved performance in alkane dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展突出了对结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解。关键工业应用包括烷烃脱氢过程，尤其是丙烷转化为丙烯和异丁烷转化为异丁烯。研究重点在于优化催化剂结构以提高活性、稳定性和选择性。主要研究领域包括确定催化剂表面特定的Cr物种、它们在催化作用中的作用以及Cr与支持材料之间的相互作用。碱金属氧化物等促进剂用于改善催化剂性能。反应机理探索了Cr物种如何在还原过程中形成活性位点以促进脱氢反应。目标是开发能够高效地将烷烃转化为烯烃并减少副产品生成的同时保持高活性的催化剂。

铬氧化物催化剂的重要性在于它们能够在温和条件下运行，降低能源需求并提高工业过程的效率。锆基催化剂因其优越的脱氢活性而突出，这归因于在操作温度下稳定高表面积锆石，同时保持Cr-支持相互作用的有利效果。认为单核CrV物种在还原后转化为单核CrIII物种，在zirconia基催化剂中起着关键的催化作用。这些催化剂在脱氢应用的实际使用依赖于稳定锆石支持而不牺牲Cr-支持相互作用的正面影响。

总之，铬氧化物催化剂的发展是由对其结构功能关系的深入理解、活性位点优化和维持高活性和选择性策略的发展所推动的。zirconia基催化剂代表了这一领域的显著进展，在烷烃脱氢过程中提供了改进的性能。
