<p>The present investigation has examined structural and catalytic properties of numerous chromia/zirconia, chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica catalysts,covering a wide range of Cr concentration.</p>
<p>This study allows some nal conclusion to be drawn:(i) several Cr species are present on the surface of the investigated catalysts in amounts depending on the specific support and Cr concentration.</p>
<p>(ii) the dehydrogenation activity per total Cr atom is substantially higher for zirconia-based catalysts than for g-alumina- and silica-based ones.</p>
<p>(iii) a proportionality is found between activity and high-oxidation state Cr, thus indicating the involvement of high-oxidation state Cr species in generating the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>(iv) the higher activity per high-oxidation state Cr atom of the zirconia-based system is thought to be related to the higher concentration on zirconia of mononuclear CrV species, which reduce to the active mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions.</p>
<p>(v) the practical application of the chromia/ zirconia system, as dehydrogenation catalyst, relies upon the stabilization of high surface area ZrO2 at the working temperature. This stabilization would necessarily involve some changes in the surface properties of zirconia.</p>

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been driven by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization and isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene for producing methyl tert-butyl ether as octane number boosters for unleaded gasoline. Research focuses on improving catalyst performance through optimizing support materials, such as zirconia, alumina, and silica, and adjusting the chromium loading to stabilize high surface area ZrO2 at working temperatures. The presence of various chromium species on catalyst surfaces, their interaction with supports, and the role of high-oxidation state chromium in catalytic activity are critical aspects of this research. The higher activity of zirconia-based catalysts compared to alumina- and silica-based catalysts is attributed to the higher concentration of mononuclear chromium(V) species on zirconia, which reduces to active mononuclear chromium(III) species under reaction conditions. The practical application of chromium/zirconia systems in dehydrogenation relies on stabilizing the high surface area of ZrO2 at working temperatures without compromising the positive interaction between chromium and the support material.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展受到对其结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制理解的推动。关键工业应用包括丙烷脱氢为丙烯用于聚合以及异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯用于生产甲基叔丁基醚作为无铅汽油的辛烷值提升剂。研究重点集中在通过优化支持材料（如氧化锆、氧化铝和二氧化硅）和调整铬负载来稳定工作温度下的高表面区域ZrO2。催化剂表面上存在的各种铬物种、它们与支持材料的相互作用以及高氧化态铬在催化活性中的作用是这一研究的关键方面。与氧化铝和二氧化硅基催化剂相比，氧化锆基催化剂较高的活性归因于氧化锆上较高浓度的一价铬（V）物种，这些物种在反应条件下还原为活性的一价铬（III）物种。氧化锆/铬系统的实际应用依赖于在工作温度下稳定高表面区域的ZrO2，同时不损害铬与支持材料之间的正相互作用。
