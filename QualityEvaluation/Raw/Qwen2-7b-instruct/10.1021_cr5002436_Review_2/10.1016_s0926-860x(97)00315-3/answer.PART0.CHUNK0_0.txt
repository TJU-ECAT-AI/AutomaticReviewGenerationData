Chromia/zirconia catalysts with Cr content exceeding the monolayer.
A comparison with chromia/alumina and chromia/silica for isobutane dehydrogenation

Several Cr species were identied, namely CrVI, CrV (ESR g-signal), CrIII (ESR d-signal), small CrIII oxide clusters (ESR b-signal) and a-chromia. 

The catalytic activity in the isobutane dehydrogenation was studied at 723 and 773 K in a flow microreactor. It was found that the activity per total Cr atom was markedly higher for the zirconia-based catalysts compared with the other two systems in all the explored Cr concentration range.

The relative abundance of these Cr species was found to be mainly controlled by the specific support employed and the Cr concentration. 

That is, the CrOx/ZrO2 interaction maintains its positive effect well beyond the monolayer capacity of this support. Moreover, the catalytic activity correlated with the amount of high-oxidation state chromium (CrVI and CrV), evaluated by the quantity of extractable Cr or by the consumption of carbon monoxide in the catalyst reduction. 

The larger concentration of mononuclear CrV species on zirconia, confirmed here, is thought to be responsible for the higher activity of the zirconia-based catalysts, through reduction to active mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions.

The dehydrogenation activity per total Cr atom is substantially higher for zirconia-based catalysts than for alumina- and silica-based ones.

A proportionality is found between activity and high-oxidation state Cr, thus indicating the involvement of high-oxidation state Cr species in generating the catalytic activity.

The higher activity per high-oxidation state Cr atom of the zirconia-based system is thought to be related to the higher concentration on zirconia of mononuclear CrV species, which reduce to the active mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization and isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene, which is increasingly utilized for producing methyl (or ethyl)-tert-butyl ether through reaction with methanol (or ethanol). Research focuses on understanding the structure, identifying active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. The document highlights that the dehydrogenation activity per total chromium atom is notably higher for zirconia-based catalysts compared to alumina- and silica-based systems. A critical finding is the correlation between catalytic activity and the presence of high-oxidation state chromium species, suggesting their pivotal role in catalytic action. The zirconia-based system's superior performance is attributed to a higher concentration of mononuclear chromium(V) species on the zirconia surface, which reduce to active mononuclear chromium(III) species under reaction conditions, contributing to enhanced activity.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展对脱氢过程的重要性产生了显著影响。关键工业应用包括丙烷脱氢制丙烯用于聚合和异丁烷脱氢制异丁烯，后者越来越多地用于通过与甲醇（或乙醇）反应生产甲基（或乙基）叔丁基醚。研究重点在于理解结构、识别活性位点、选择合适的支撑材料、引入促进剂以及阐明反应机制。文献强调，总铬原子中的脱氢化活性对于锆基催化剂远高于铝基和硅基催化剂。一个关键发现是活性与高氧化态铬物种之间的相关性，表明它们在催化作用中起着核心作用。锆基系统性能的优越性归因于锆基表面高浓度的一核铬(V)物种，这些物种在反应条件下还原为活性的一核铬(III)物种，从而导致活性增强。
