Chromia/zirconia catalysts with Cr content exceeding the monolayer.
A comparison with chromia/alumina and chromia/silica for isobutane dehydrogenation

Several Cr species were identied, namely CrVI, CrV (ESR g-signal), CrIII (ESR d-signal), small CrIII oxide clusters (ESR b-signal) and a-chromia. 

The catalytic activity in the isobutane dehydrogenation was studied at 723 and 773 K in a flow microreactor. It was found that the activity per total Cr atom was markedly higher for the zirconia-based catalysts compared with the other two systems in all the explored Cr concentration range.

The relative abundance of these Cr species was found to be mainly controlled by the specific support employed and the Cr concentration. 

That is, the CrOx/ZrO2 interaction maintains its positive effect well beyond the monolayer capacity of this support. Moreover, the catalytic activity correlated with the amount of high-oxidation state chromium (CrVI and CrV), evaluated by the quantity of extractable Cr or by the consumption of carbon monoxide in the catalyst reduction. 

The larger concentration of mononuclear CrV species on zirconia, confirmed here, is thought to be responsible for the higher activity of the zirconia-based catalysts, through reduction to active mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions.

The dehydrogenation activity per total Cr atom is substantially higher for zirconia-based catalysts than for alumina- and silica-based ones.

A proportionality is found between activity and high-oxidation state Cr, thus indicating the involvement of high-oxidation state Cr species in generating the catalytic activity.

The higher activity per high-oxidation state Cr atom of the zirconia-based system is thought to be related to the higher concentration on zirconia of mononuclear CrV species, which reduce to the active mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has significantly contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization and isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene, which is increasingly utilized for producing methyl (or ethyl)-tert-butyl ether through reaction with methanol (or ethanol). Research focuses on understanding the structure, identifying active sites, selecting appropriate support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. The document highlights that the dehydrogenation activity per total chromium atom is notably higher for zirconia-based catalysts compared to alumina- and silica-based systems. A critical finding is the correlation between catalytic activity and the presence of high-oxidation state chromium species, suggesting their pivotal role in catalytic action. The zirconia-based system's superior performance is attributed to a higher concentration of mononuclear chromium(V) species on the zirconia surface, which reduce to active mononuclear chromium(III) species under reaction conditions, contributing to enhanced activity.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include alkane dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of propene from propane and isobutene from isobutane. Research focuses on optimizing the catalyst structure to enhance activity, stability, and selectivity. Key areas of investigation include the identification of specific Cr species on the catalyst surface, their role in catalytic activity, and the interaction between Cr and the support material. Promoters such as alkali oxides are used to improve catalyst performance. Reaction mechanisms explore how Cr species undergo reduction to form active sites that facilitate dehydrogenation reactions. The goal is to develop catalysts that efficiently convert alkanes to alkenes while minimizing byproduct formation and maintaining high activity over multiple reaction cycles.

The significance of chromium oxide catalysts lies in their ability to operate under mild conditions, reducing energy requirements and improving efficiency in industrial processes. The zirconia-based catalysts stand out due to their superior dehydrogenation activity, which is attributed to the stabilization of high surface area zirconia at operating temperatures, maintaining a favorable Cr-support interaction. Mononuclear CrV species, which reduce to mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions, are believed to play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of zirconia-based catalysts. The practical application of these catalysts in dehydrogenation relies on stabilizing the zirconia support without compromising the positive effects of the Cr-support interaction.

To summarize, the evolution of chromium oxide catalysts has been driven by a deepening understanding of their structure-function relationships, optimization of active sites, and development of strategies to maintain high activity and selectivity under industrial conditions. The zirconia-based catalysts represent a significant advancement in this field, offering improved performance in alkane dehydrogenation processes.
