1. Calcium carbonate is widely utilized as a filler in various industries such as plastics, paper, rubber, coatings, light chemicals, and architectural materials. The global market dynamics are closely tied to the paper, automotive, plastics, and construction industries, which are influenced by the global economy's cyclical fluctuations.

2. The comprehensive report covers market trends, issues, drivers, company profiles, and strategic industry activities. It provides market estimates and projections for major geographic markets, along with detailed analyses of ground calcium carbonate (GCC) and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) product segments and their end-use markets.

3. The global demand for carbon black is anticipated to experience dynamic growth until 2019, as per a market study by Ceresana Research. This growth is largely attributed to the expansion of the tyre production sector, which consumed over 7.8 million tonnes in 2011. Additionally, the report highlights that the automotive industry is the largest sales market for carbon black, driving both the tyre segment and a wide range of rubber products' utilization.

4. The ASTM International standard ASTM D7823 was developed to identify and qualify low-level, regulated phthalates in poly(vinyl chloride) plastics. This standard is crucial for analytical laboratories, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA).

The global market for additives, particularly focusing on calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and carbon black, is influenced by trends in paper, automotive, plastics, and construction industries. These industries are affected by the cyclical fluctuations of the global economy. Ground CaCO3 (GCC) is the largest and fastest-growing product segment in the global market. Asia Pacific represents the largest and fastest-growing regional market for CaCO3, driven by the rapid progress of its plastics and paper industries, especially in China. This region is expected to remain a major contributor to growth. Similarly, demand for carbon black is expected to rise dynamically until 2019, with Asia Pacific being the main driver for growth. Consumption and production volumes in this region are projected to increase by more than 4.5% annually. In the USA, section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) prohibits certain products from containing specific phthalates, leading to the development of a new ASTM International standard for identifying and qualifying these phthalates in poly(vinyl chloride) plastics.

The additives for polymers market includes various components such as ground calcium carbonate (GCC) and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). GCC represents the largest and fastest-growing product segment, primarily used in the plastics industry. PCC, however, is driven by increasing consumption in the paper and rubber industries, especially in China where the domestic demand for paints and plastics in the construction industry is surging. In North America and Europe, the establishment of satellite plants is expected to positively impact the PCC market. Globally, the demand for carbon black is projected to rise dynamically until 2019, largely influenced by the growth in the automotive industry, particularly in Asia Pacific where consumption and production volumes are anticipated to increase significantly. The environmental, health, and safety issues related to the additives for polymers market are highlighted through the ASTM International standard for identifying and qualifying phthalates in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, which aims to ensure compliance with laws such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and European Union Directive 2005/84/EC.
