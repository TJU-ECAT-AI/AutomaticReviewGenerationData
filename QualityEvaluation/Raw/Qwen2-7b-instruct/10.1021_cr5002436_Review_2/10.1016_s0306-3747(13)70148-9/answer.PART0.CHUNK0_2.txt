The global market for additives, particularly focusing on calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and carbon black, is influenced by trends in paper, automotive, plastics, and construction industries. These industries are affected by the cyclical fluctuations of the global economy. Ground CaCO3 (GCC) is the largest and fastest-growing product segment in the global market. Asia Pacific represents the largest and fastest-growing regional market for CaCO3, driven by the rapid progress of its plastics and paper industries, especially in China. This region is expected to remain a major contributor to growth. Similarly, demand for carbon black is expected to rise dynamically until 2019, with Asia Pacific being the main driver for growth. Consumption and production volumes in this region are projected to increase by more than 4.5% annually. In the USA, section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) prohibits certain products from containing specific phthalates, leading to the development of a new ASTM International standard for identifying and qualifying these phthalates in poly(vinyl chloride) plastics.

全球添加剂市场，特别是对于碳酸钙（CaCO3）和炭黑的需求，受造纸、汽车、塑料和建筑行业趋势的影响。这些行业受到全球经济周期性波动的影响。粒状碳酸钙（GCC）是全球最大的和增长最快的市场细分产品。亚太地区代表了最大的和增长最快的碳酸钙市场区域，推动了其塑料和造纸工业的快速发展，尤其是中国。该地区预计将保持增长的主要贡献者。同样，对炭黑的需求预计到2019年将动态增长，其中亚太地区是主要的增长驱动力。该地区的消费量和产量预计每年增长超过4.5%。在美国，2008年消费者产品安全改进法案第108节禁止某些产品含有特定的邻苯二甲酸盐，导致制定了一项新的美国材料试验协会标准，用于确定聚氯乙烯塑料中这些邻苯二甲酸盐的存在情况。
