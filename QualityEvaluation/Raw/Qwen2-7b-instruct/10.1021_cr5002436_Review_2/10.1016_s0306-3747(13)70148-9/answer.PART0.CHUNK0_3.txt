The additives for polymers market includes various components such as ground calcium carbonate (GCC) and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). GCC represents the largest and fastest-growing product segment, primarily used in the plastics industry. PCC, however, is driven by increasing consumption in the paper and rubber industries, especially in China where the domestic demand for paints and plastics in the construction industry is surging. In North America and Europe, the establishment of satellite plants is expected to positively impact the PCC market. Globally, the demand for carbon black is projected to rise dynamically until 2019, largely influenced by the growth in the automotive industry, particularly in Asia Pacific where consumption and production volumes are anticipated to increase significantly. The environmental, health, and safety issues related to the additives for polymers market are highlighted through the ASTM International standard for identifying and qualifying phthalates in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, which aims to ensure compliance with laws such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and European Union Directive 2005/84/EC.

添加剂聚合物市场包括各种成分，如碳酸钙（GCC）和沉淀碳酸钙（PCC）。GCC代表最大的和最快的增长产品段，主要用于塑料行业。然而，PCC的增长动力来自于纸张和橡胶行业的消费增加，特别是在中国，国内对油漆和塑料在建筑业的需求正在激增。在北美和欧洲，卫星工厂的建立有望为PCC市场带来积极影响。全球碳黑需求预计到2019年将动态增长，主要受汽车行业发展的影响，特别是亚太地区，预计该地区的消费量和生产量都将显著增加。全球对碳黑的需求预计将从2011年的水平增长超过310万吨。碳黑的主要消费领域是各种类型的轮胎；这一领域在2011年消耗了超过780万吨碳黑。碳黑用于轮胎和其他多种橡胶产品的填充物，在其他工业领域如塑料、油漆、清漆和印刷油墨中作为着色剂使用。环境、健康和安全问题是添加剂聚合物市场关注的重点，通过美国材料与试验协会（ASTM）国际标准来识别和验证聚氯乙烯（PVC）塑料中的邻苯二甲酸盐，以确保符合《消费者产品安全改进法》2008年法案和欧盟指令2005/84/EC等法律法规的要求。
