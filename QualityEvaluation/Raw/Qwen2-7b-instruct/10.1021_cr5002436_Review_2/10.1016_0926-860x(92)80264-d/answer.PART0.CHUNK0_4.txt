[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has a considerable industrial importance because it represents a route to obtaining alkenes for polymerization and other organic syntheses from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
[2] "The activity and selectivity of chromia-supported catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation has been known for many decades."
[3] "Gamma-alumina is widely employed since it is a refractory high surface area material, but it presents the undesired feature of catalyzing side reactions (cracking and coking), leading to catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The acidic sites responsible for the side reactions can be poisoned with alkali ions (very often potassium) with satisfactory results."
[5] "Zirconia possesses interesting features, as for instance, the presence of weakly acidic and basic sites and sufficient resistance to thermal sintering when chromium is present."
[6] "Moreover, Hino and Arata [7] report that chromia on zirconia displays higher activity in the dehydrocyclization of hexane in comparison with chromium on other supports."
[7] "The chemical and textural properties of the solid and the stability of the different chromium species on its surface have been studied by various techniques, including differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron spin resonance (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared spectros- copy (IR), and gas volumetric redox cycles."
[8] "The activity for both reactions was related to coordinatively unsaturated Cr species."
[9] "The detrimental effect of the potassium addition on the activity suggests that Oa- ions adjacent to Cr active species are involved in the dehydrogenation site."
[10] "The small decrease of activity observed after reaction with water at 773 K can be accounted for by considering that the coordinative unsaturation requirements of a small fraction of active sites could be lost upon water adsorption."

Dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly chromium oxide-based ones, have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications involve converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into alkenes for polymerization and other organic synthesis processes. Research focuses on catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Gamma-alumina, though refractory and high-surface-area, often catalyzes unwanted cracking and coking reactions. Poisoning these with alkali ions, like potassium, can mitigate these issues. Zirconia, with its weakly acidic/basic sites and resistance to thermal sintering, offers promising properties for catalyst support. Chromium species' stability and coordination on the surface are studied through various analytical techniques. Active sites are linked to coordinatively unsaturated chromium species, and potassium addition negatively impacts activity by altering nearby oxygen ions. Water treatment can reduce activity by affecting the coordination of active sites.

自1933年发现以来，脱氢催化剂，尤其是铬氧化物基催化剂，在工业应用和研究重点方面取得了显著进展。关键的工业应用涉及将低成本饱和烃转化为用于聚合和其他有机合成过程的烯烃。研究集中在催化剂结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂以及反应机制。尽管γ-氧化铝具有耐热性和高表面积，但其催化裂解和结焦等副反应是不希望的。通过用碱性离子，如钾，来毒化这些物质可以缓解这些问题。具有弱酸性和碱性位点，并且在铬存在时具有足够的热稳定性，锆石被认为是催化剂支撑的有前景的特性。通过各种分析技术研究了铬物种在表面的稳定性和协调。活性位点与可协调的铬物种有关，钾添加会负面影响活性，因为它改变了附近的氧离子。水处理可以降低活性，因为它影响了活性位点的协调。
