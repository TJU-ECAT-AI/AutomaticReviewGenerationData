[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has a considerable industrial importance because it represents a route to obtaining alkenes for polymeriza- tion and other organic syntheses from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydro- carbons."
[2] "In our laboratory the preparation and characterization of the CrO,/ZrOz system has been investigated for some years. In particular, the chemical and textural properties of the solid and the stability of the different chromium species on its surface have been studied by various techniques, including differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD ) , electron spin resonance (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS ), infrared spectros- copy (IR), and gas volumetric redox cycles [ 5,8-101."
[3] "The activity of CrO,/ZrOa (ZC) catalysta (0.05 to 0.8% chromium by weight) in the dehydrogenation of propane at 723-823 K has been investigated in a flow apparatus."
[4] "The active centres are mononuclear Cr species. Surface 02- ions adjacent to the Cr active species are most probably involved in the dehydrogenation site."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been crucial in dehydrogenation processes since their discovery in 1933, primarily enabling the production of alkenes from inexpensive saturated hydrocarbons. These catalysts are vital for polymerization and other organic synthesis processes.
2. The laboratory has extensively studied the chromium oxide-zirconia system, focusing on the chemical and textural properties of the solid, as well as the stability of different chromium species on its surface. Techniques like differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, electron spin resonance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and volumetric redox cycles have been utilized.
3. The catalysts of chromium oxide/zirconia (ZC) compositions with chromium concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.8% by weight were examined for their activity in propane dehydrogenation at temperatures between 723-823 K using a flow apparatus.
4. The active sites are mononuclear chromium species, with surface oxygen ions near the active chromium species likely playing a role in the dehydrogenation process.
