<p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has a considerable industrial importance because it represents a route to obtaining alkenes for polymeriza- tion and other organic syntheses from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydro- carbons.</p>
<p>The activity and selectivity of chromia-supported catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation has been known for many decades [ 1,2].</p>
<p>In our laboratory the preparation and characterization of the CrO,/ZrOz system has been investigated for some years.</p>
<p>The present paper deals with the results concerning catalysts with low chro- mium loading (up to 0.8 wt.%, corresponding to a surface concentration of 1.8 a&, nm -2) in which all chromium ions are actually accessible to the reactant.</p>
<p>The activity was measured in a flow apparatus at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>Catalysts supports Zirconia was prepared by hydrolysis of zirconium oxychloride, dried at 383 K and used as such or calcined in air for 5 h at 773 K or 923 K [5].</p>
<p>The zirconia support exhibits some activity for the dehydrogenation of pro- pane at or above 773 K.</p>
<p>A nearly-linear increase of catalytic activity with increasing chromium con- centration is observed.</p>
<p>The apparent activation energy, E,, has been found to be nearly independent of the chromium content.</p>
<p>The values of the exponents a, c, p and y were determined from In r vs. In p plots for ZCO.8 (773) at 723 K (Fig. 9).</p>
<p>It is likely that the support acts as a sink for the water adsorbed on chromium containing sites.</p>
<p>Chromium species active in the reaction, however, are not sites on which water is preferentially adsorbed.</p>
