[2] "In our laboratory the preparation and characterization of the CrO,/ZrOz system has been investigated for some years. In particular, the chemical and textural properties of the solid and the stability of the different chromium species on its surface have been studied by various techniques, including differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD ) , electron spin resonance (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS ), infrared spectros- copy (IR), and gas volumetric redox cycles [ 5,8-101."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have become indispensable in dehydrogenation processes, particularly for producing alkenes from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. Their industrial applications are extensive, including petrochemical processing, organic synthesis, and the production of olefins. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst properties to enhance dehydrogenation efficiency and selectivity, reducing side reactions like cracking and coking, and improving catalyst stability through the use of appropriate support materials and promoters. The structure of these catalysts, characterized by mononuclear chromium species, plays a crucial role in their activity, with oxygen ions near the active sites believed to facilitate the dissociative adsorption of reactants and the desorption of products. The detrimental effect of potassium addition highlights the importance of controlling the local environment around active sites for optimal catalytic performance.

The key contributions to their significance include:
1. The development of more efficient and selective catalysts by understanding the structure and properties of active sites.
2. The optimization of support materials to improve stability and reduce side reactions.
3. The introduction of promoters to enhance catalytic activity and stability.
4. Advances in reaction mechanisms that elucidate how these catalysts facilitate dehydrogenation processes efficiently.
5. The improvement of deactivation mechanisms, such as coke formation, to prolong catalyst life and reduce costs.

Dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly chromium oxide-based ones, have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications involve converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into alkenes for polymerization and other organic synthesis processes. Research focuses on catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Gamma-alumina, though refractory and high-surface-area, often catalyzes unwanted cracking and coking reactions. Poisoning these with alkali ions, like potassium, can mitigate these issues. Zirconia, with its weakly acidic/basic sites and resistance to thermal sintering, offers promising properties for catalyst support. Chromium species' stability and coordination on the surface are studied through various analytical techniques. Active sites are linked to coordinatively unsaturated chromium species, and potassium addition negatively impacts activity by altering nearby oxygen ions. Water treatment can reduce activity by affecting the coordination of active sites.

自1933年发现以来，脱氢催化剂，尤其是铬氧化物基催化剂，在工业应用和研究重点方面取得了显著进展。关键的工业应用涉及将低成本饱和烃转化为用于聚合和其他有机合成过程的烯烃。研究集中在催化剂结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂以及反应机制。尽管γ-氧化铝具有耐热性和高表面积，但其催化裂解和结焦等副反应是不希望的。通过用碱性离子，如钾，来毒化这些物质可以缓解这些问题。具有弱酸性和碱性位点，并且在铬存在时具有足够的热稳定性，锆石被认为是催化剂支撑的有前景的特性。通过各种分析技术研究了铬物种在表面的稳定性和协调。活性位点与可协调的铬物种有关，钾添加会负面影响活性，因为它改变了附近的氧离子。水处理可以降低活性，因为它影响了活性位点的协调。
