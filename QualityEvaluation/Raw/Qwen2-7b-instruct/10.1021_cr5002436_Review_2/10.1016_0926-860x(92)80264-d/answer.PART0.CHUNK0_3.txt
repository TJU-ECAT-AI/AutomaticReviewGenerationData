The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been driven by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include the production of alkenes from saturated hydrocarbons for polymerization and organic synthesis. Research focuses on improving catalyst efficiency, stability, and selectivity through detailed analysis of the solid's chemical and textural properties, stability of chromium species, and interactions with various techniques like DTA, XRD, ESR, XPS, and infrared spectroscopy. Support materials play a crucial role in stabilizing different oxidation states and enhancing the active sites. Promoters, such as potassium, alter the properties of oxygen ions bonded to chromium and support cations, impacting the dissociative adsorption of reactants and hydrogen desorption. The recovery of activity through oxygen treatment highlights the importance of oxygen in the active site. Mononuclear chromium species are identified as the active centers, with surface oxygen ions adjacent to the active species likely involved in the dehydrogenation process.
