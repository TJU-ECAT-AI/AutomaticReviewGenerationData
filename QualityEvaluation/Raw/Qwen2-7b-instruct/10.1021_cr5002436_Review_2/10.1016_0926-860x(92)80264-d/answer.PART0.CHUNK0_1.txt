[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has a considerable industrial importance because it represents a route to obtaining alkenes for polymeriza- tion and other organic syntheses from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydro- carbons."
[2] "The activity of CrO,/ZrOa (ZC) catalysta (0.05 to 0.8% chromium by weight) in the dehydrogenation of propane at 723-823 K has been investigated in a flow apparatus."
[3] "Gamma-alumina is widely employed since it is a refractory high surface area material, but it presents the undesired feature of catalyzing side reactions (cracking and coking), leading to catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The acidic sites responsible for the side reactions can be poisoned with alkali ions (very often potassium) with satisfactory results."
[5] "Zirconia displays a dehydrogenation activity at T 2 773 K, poisoned by small amounts of water."
[6] "The average turnover frequency (per total surface chromium atom) is nearly independent of the chromium content, indicating that the active centre is mononuclear."
[7] "After reduction with carbon monoxide, samples contain CP and Cr in nearly equal amounts."
[8] "A subsequent selective oxidation of Cr to Cr with water at 773 K hardly affects the activity, therefore suggesting that Crm species are active."
[9] "The detrimental effect of the potassium addition on the activity suggests that Oa- ions adjacent to Cr active species are involved in the dehydrogenation site."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have become indispensable in dehydrogenation processes, particularly for producing alkenes from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. Their industrial applications are extensive, including petrochemical processing, organic synthesis, and the production of olefins. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst properties to enhance dehydrogenation efficiency and selectivity, reducing side reactions like cracking and coking, and improving catalyst stability through the use of appropriate support materials and promoters. The structure of these catalysts, characterized by mononuclear chromium species, plays a crucial role in their activity, with oxygen ions near the active sites believed to facilitate the dissociative adsorption of reactants and the desorption of products. The detrimental effect of potassium addition highlights the importance of controlling the local environment around active sites for optimal catalytic performance.

The key contributions to their significance include:
1. The development of more efficient and selective catalysts by understanding the structure and properties of active sites.
2. The optimization of support materials to improve stability and reduce side reactions.
3. The introduction of promoters to enhance catalytic activity and stability.
4. Advances in reaction mechanisms that elucidate how these catalysts facilitate dehydrogenation processes efficiently.
5. The improvement of deactivation mechanisms, such as coke formation, to prolong catalyst life and reduce costs.
