[1] "The principal conclusions were as follows:"

[2] "There is an oxidation state lower than that of the site active for hydrogen-deuterium equilibration. That lower site is inactive."

[3] "If the active site contains chromium (as seems certain) then that chromium ion is not directly accessible to molecular hydrogen."

[4] "The transitory intermediate active site appears to be a partially hydroxylated Cr3+ in tetrahedral configuration, with a higher oxidation state possible."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Initially, they were used primarily in dehydrogenation processes. Research focus areas have expanded to include understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, exploring suitable support materials, studying promoter effects, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include petrochemical processing, refining, and the production of chemicals such as ethylene, propylene, and aromatics.

2. The active sites in chromium oxide catalysts are characterized by a lower oxidation state than that of the site responsible for hydrogen-deuterium equilibration. This lower state is inactive, suggesting that the active site operates at a higher oxidation state.

3. The active sites in chromium oxide catalysts are not directly accessible to molecular hydrogen. This implies that the hydrogen must undergo a series of reactions or intermediate steps before it can interact with the active site.

4. The transitory intermediate active site is hypothesized to be a partially hydroxylated Cr3+ ion in a tetrahedral configuration. This site can exist in a higher oxidation state, indicating a dynamic nature and potential for reactivity in dehydrogenation processes.

1. 自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的发展。最初，它们主要应用于脱氢过程。研究重点领域扩展到了催化剂结构的理解、活性位点的识别、合适支撑材料的选择、促进剂效应的研究以及反应机制的阐明。关键工业应用包括石油化学加工、精炼和化学品生产，如乙烯、丙烯和芳香族化合物。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂的活性位点具有比氢-氘平衡反应位点更低的氧化状态。这个较低的状态是不活跃的，暗示活性位点在较高的氧化状态下操作。

3. 铬氧化物催化剂的活性位点不能直接接触分子氢。这意味着氢必须经历一系列反应或中间步骤，才能与活性位点相互作用。

4. 暂时性中间活性位点被假定为部分羟基化的Cr3+离子，处于四面体构型中。该位点可以存在更高的氧化状态，表明其动态性质和在脱氢过程中的潜在反应性。
