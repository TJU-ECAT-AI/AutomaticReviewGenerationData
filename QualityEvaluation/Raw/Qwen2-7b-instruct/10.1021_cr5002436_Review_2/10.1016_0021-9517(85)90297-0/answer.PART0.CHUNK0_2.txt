1. Several attempts have been made to identify the active site of chromium oxide-based catalysts. Chromium(I1) is often favored by researchers as the oxidation state, though Cr(II1) has also been proposed.
2. During ethane dehydrogenation, active A-type chromium(I1) ions were selectively poisoned by carbon deposits.
3. The nuclearity of chromium in the active site plays a significant role in catalytic activity.
4. The catalytic activity for ethane dehydrogenation decreased in the order Cr/A1203 > Cr/SiO;? > a-Cr20,+ Cry.
