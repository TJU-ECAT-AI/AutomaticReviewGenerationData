The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by a deepening understanding of their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications have included the dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly ethane, to produce ethylene. The active sites for ethane dehydrogenation are believed to be low nuclearity A-type chromium(I1) ions. The nature of these active sites was studied using infrared spectroscopy and kinetic measurements. The concentration of active A-type chromium(I1) ions increases with dehydration temperatures. However, the number of sites rather than their type changes upon dehydration. These active sites are selectively poisoned by carbonaceous deposits during ethane dehydrogenation. The apparent activation energy remains constant across different dehydration temperatures, suggesting that the number of sites, but not their type, changes. The specific activity of chromium catalysts depends on the support material, and the catalysts are rapidly poisoned by coking. The accessibility of chromium ions is also a critical factor influencing the catalytic activity of chromium-based catalysts.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展已经深入到了其结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解。关键工业应用包括烷烃特别是乙烷的脱氢生产乙烯。乙烷脱氢的活性位点被认为是低核铬(I1)型离子。通过红外光谱学和动力学测量研究了这些活性位点的性质。脱氢温度增加时，活性A型铬(I1)离子的浓度会增加。然而，在高温下脱氢，改变的是位点的数量而不是类型。这些活性位点在乙烷脱氢过程中被碳沉积物选择性地毒害。不同脱氢温度下的显着激活能表明，改变的是位点的数量而非类型。催化剂的特定活性取决于支撑材料，并且催化剂容易受到结焦的毒害。铬离子的可接近性也是影响铬基催化剂活性的关键因素。
