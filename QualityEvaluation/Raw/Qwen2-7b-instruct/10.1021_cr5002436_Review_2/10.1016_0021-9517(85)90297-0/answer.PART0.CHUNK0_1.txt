[1] "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site."
[2] "Chromium(I1) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (l-3), although Cr(II1) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."
[3] "The nuclearity of the active sites has also been investigated."
[4] "Evidence from the present study suggests that the coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(I1) ions, which result in the carbonyl band at 2182 cm-l, are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation."
[5] "At low loadings the active site is believed to be a coordinatively unsaturated Cr(I1) ion, which is in a state of low nuclearity."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has seen advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts have found significant applications in dehydrogenation processes. The active sites for these catalysts have been extensively researched, with chromium(I1) ions being identified as the preferred oxidation state. The nuclearity of these active sites has also been studied, revealing that the coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(I1) ions, which produce a carbonyl band at 2182 cm-l, are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation. At low loadings, the active site is thought to be a coordinatively unsaturated Cr(I1) ion in a low nuclear state.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展在结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制方面取得了进展。这些催化剂在脱氢化过程中有重要的应用。对于这些催化剂的活性位点进行了广泛的研究，发现铬(I1)离子是首选的氧化状态。对活性位点的核度也进行了研究，发现能够产生2182 cm-l的羰基带的配位不饱和A型铬(I1)离子是乙烷脱氢的活性位点。在低负载下，活性位点被认为是处于低核度状态的配位不饱和Cr(I1)离子。
