[2] "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site. Chromium(I1) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (l-3),although Cr(II1) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."

[6] "Turnover frequencies, based on the calculated number of surface chromium atoms, were similar for Cr/SiOZ, Cr/A1201, and o-CrZOs, but a CrY zeolite was essentially inactive since chromium ions remain in the +3 oxidation state."
