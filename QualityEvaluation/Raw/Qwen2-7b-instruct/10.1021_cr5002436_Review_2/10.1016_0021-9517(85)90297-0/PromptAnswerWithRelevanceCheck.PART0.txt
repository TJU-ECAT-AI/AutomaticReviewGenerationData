<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by a deepening understanding of their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications have included the dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly ethane, to produce ethylene. The active sites for ethane dehydrogenation are believed to be low nuclearity A-type chromium(I1) ions. The nature of these active sites was studied using infrared spectroscopy and kinetic measurements. The concentration of active A-type chromium(I1) ions increases with dehydration temperatures. However, the number of sites rather than their type changes upon dehydration. These active sites are selectively poisoned by carbonaceous deposits during ethane dehydrogenation. The apparent activation energy remains constant across different dehydration temperatures, suggesting that the number of sites, but not their type, changes. The specific activity of chromium catalysts depends on the support material, and the catalysts are rapidly poisoned by coking. The accessibility of chromium ions is also a critical factor influencing the catalytic activity of chromium-based catalysts.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展已经深入到了其结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解。关键工业应用包括烷烃特别是乙烷的脱氢生产乙烯。乙烷脱氢的活性位点被认为是低核铬(I1)型离子。通过红外光谱学和动力学测量研究了这些活性位点的性质。脱氢温度增加时，活性A型铬(I1)离子的浓度会增加。然而，在高温下脱氢，改变的是位点的数量而不是类型。这些活性位点在乙烷脱氢过程中被碳沉积物选择性地毒害。不同脱氢温度下的显着激活能表明，改变的是位点的数量而非类型。催化剂的特定活性取决于支撑材料，并且催化剂容易受到结焦的毒害。铬离子的可接近性也是影响铬基催化剂活性的关键因素。

JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS 91, 155-166 (1985) The Dehydrogenation of Ethane over Chromium Catalysts HELI J. LUGOANDJACK H. LUNSFORD Department of Chemistv, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843 Received May 31, 1984; revised September 1, 1984

The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium supported on silica gel has been studied by infrared spectroscopy, together with kinetic measurements. Low nuclearity A- type chromium(I1) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiOZ catalysts. Higher dehydration temperatures increased the concentration of active A-type chro- mium(H) ions. The apparent activation energy was the same for different dehydration temperatures, which indicates that the number but not the type of site changed upon dehydration at elevated temperatures. The active A-type chromium(I1) sites were selectively poisoned by carbo- naceous deposits during the dehydrogenation of ethane. Turnover frequencies, based on the calcu- lated number of surface chromium atoms, were similar for Cr/SiOZ, Cr/A1201, and o-CrZOs, but a CrY zeolite was essentially inactive since chromium ions remain in the +3 oxidation state. o 1985 Academic Press, Inc

活性位点为低核度A型铬（I1）离子，存在于氧化铝支持的铬催化剂上。较高的脱水温度增加了这些活性A型铬（H）离子的浓度。不同脱水温度下的显着激活能保持不变，表明改变的是位点的数量而非类型。活性A型铬（I1）位点在乙烷脱氢过程中会被碳沉积物选择性地毒害。根据表面铬原子数计算的周转频率对于Cr/SiOZ、Cr/A1201和o-CrZOs来说相似，但CrY沸石基本上是无活性的，因为铬离子保持在+3氧化态。
