The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include processes such as alkane dehydrogenation, which is used for producing high-purity propene. The research focus areas have been on optimizing catalyst performance through modifications to support materials, such as increasing the amount of θ-alumina by raising the alumina pretreatment temperature, which positively impacts dehydrogenation activity. However, calcination at high temperatures can lead to severe deactivation. UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy has proven effective in monitoring changes in the coordination environment and oxidation state of supported metal oxides, providing insights into their behavior under reaction conditions. The fiber optic setup offers advantages over previous methods, such as faster data collection, enabling the tracking of fast processes within seconds. This technique is applicable to transition metal ions that exhibit absorption bands in the UVvis region, enhancing its utility in catalyst research.
