[1] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an industrially important process that is a viable route, for example, for the production of high-purity propene used for the production of polymer materials (19)."
[2] "The current note introduces a new approach for measuring UVvis diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra of an operating catalyst. The technique is based on the use of optical fiber technology, by which the state of solid transition metal oxide catalysts can be probed while they are positioned as a fixed bed in a catalytic reactor."
[3] "The effect of alumina pretreatment temperature for the catalytic activity is studied. In addition, the differences in activity caused by a deactivating thermal treatment of chromium/alumina catalysts are investigated by in situ UVvis DR measurements."
[4] "The yield of propene for the series of chromium/alumina catalysts, where the alumina pretreatment temperature and the catalyst calcination temperature were varied, is shown in Fig. 2. The data points (17.1 min on stream) represent a stable situation of the catalysts, where all the Cr6+ has been converted to Cr3+ and the initial CO2, CO, and H2O formation (20) no longer affect the product distribution."
[5] "As an example, we discuss the spectra of two chromium/alumina catalysts, which were both prepared on alumina pretreated at 600C, but the calcination temperatures were 600 and 1200C. The former is here referred to as the fresh catalyst and the latter as the deactivated catalyst."
[6] "The positions of the absorption bands are characteristic of the coordination environment of Cr3+ (23). For spectra measured at room temperature, Cr3+ located inside an α-alumina structure (i.e., ruby) has dd transitions at 18,150 and 24,700 cm1 (23), whereas Cr3+ in Cr2O3 has bands at 16,600 (26) and 21,700 cm1 (27)."
[7] "Previously, the activity of supported chromium catalysts were investigated in isobutane dehydrogenation at 350 to 500C (15). The catalysts were monitored in situ by UV vis DR spectroscopy in a Praying Mantis DR attachment (Harrick) equipped with a photomultiplier detector."
[8] "The main advantage of the current fiberoptic setup compared with the Praying Mantis setup is the speed of data collection: fast processes with the time scale of seconds can be followed through the use of a photodiode array detector."
[9] "Monitoring the changes taking place in the coordination environment and oxidation state of supported metal oxides under reaction conditions was successful by optical fiber UVvis DR spectroscopy. This technique is generally applicable to transition metal ions, which possess absorption bands in the UVvis region."
