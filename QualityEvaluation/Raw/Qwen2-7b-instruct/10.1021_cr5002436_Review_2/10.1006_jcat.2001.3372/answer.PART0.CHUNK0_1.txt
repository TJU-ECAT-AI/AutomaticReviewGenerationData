[1] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an industrially important process that is a viable route, for example, for the production of high-purity propene used for the production of polymer materials (19)."
[2] "The effect of alumina pretreatment temperature for the catalytic activity is studied."
[3] "Calcination at 1200C strongly deactivated all the catalysts (propene yield of approximately 4%)."
[4] "During the first 30 s of propane on stream, there was an absorption band centered at 25,00026,000 cm1, which was due to Cr6+ (22)."
[5] "For spectra measured at room temperature, Cr3+ located inside an α-alumina structure (i.e., ruby) has dd transitions at 18,150 and 24,700 cm1 (23), whereas Cr3+ in Cr2O3 has bands at 16,600 (26) and 21,700 cm1 (27)."
[6] "The main advantage of the current fiberoptic setup compared with the Praying Mantis setup is the speed of data collection: fast processes with the timescale of seconds can be followed through the use of a photo diode array detector."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been significant in dehydrogenation processes since their discovery in 1933. Their industrial applications include the production of high-purity propene used for polymer material manufacturing. Research focuses on catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms.
2. The catalysts' activity is influenced by the alumina pretreatment temperature. Higher temperatures lead to increased θ-alumina formation, enhancing catalytic activity.
3. High calcination temperatures, such as 1200°C, significantly deactivate catalysts, reducing propene yield to approximately 4%.
4. During the initial 30 seconds of propane exposure, Cr6+ is readily reduced to Cr3+, as observed through absorption bands centered at 25,000-26,000 cm-1.
5. Cr3+ species within the catalyst have distinct absorption bands depending on their location—inside an α-alumina structure (ruby) or in Cr2O3. The bands' positions vary based on temperature and crystal structure.
6. The fiber optic setup offers advantages over traditional methods, including faster data collection, enabling real-time monitoring of processes with short timescales.

1. 自1933年以来，铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中一直具有重要意义。它们的工业应用包括用于聚合材料制造的高纯度丙烯生产。研究重点在于催化剂结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制。
2. 催化剂的活性受到铝氧烷预处理温度的影响。较高的温度导致θ-铝氧烷形成量增加，从而增强催化活性。
3. 高的煅烧温度，如1200°C，严重地使催化剂失活，导致丙烯产率降至约4%。
4. 在最初30秒的丙烷暴露期间，Cr6+迅速还原为Cr3+，这通过中心位于25,000-26,000 cm-1的吸收带观察到。
5. 催化剂中的Cr3+物种根据其位置（在α-铝氧烷结构（红宝石）内或在Cr2O3中）具有不同的吸收带。这些带的位置根据温度和晶体结构而变化。
6. 光纤光学设置相对于传统方法的优势在于更快的数据收集速度，允许实时监控具有短时间尺度的过程。
