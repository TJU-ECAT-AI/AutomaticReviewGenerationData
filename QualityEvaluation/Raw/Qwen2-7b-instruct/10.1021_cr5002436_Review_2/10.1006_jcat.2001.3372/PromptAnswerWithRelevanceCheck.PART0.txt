[1] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an industrially important process that is a viable route, for example, for the production of high-purity propene used for the production of polymer materials (19)."
[2] "The effect of alumina pretreatment temperature for the catalytic activity is studied. In addition, the differences in activity caused by a deactivating thermal treatment of chromium/alumina catalysts are investigated by in situ UVvis DR measurements."
[3] "The yield of propene for the series of chromium/alumina catalysts, where the alumina pretreatment temperature and the catalyst calcination temperature were varied, is shown in Fig. 2."
[4] "UVvis DR spectra were recorded continuously in situ during the catalytic experiments. As an example, we discuss the spectra of two chromium/alumina catalysts, which were both prepared on alumina pretreated at 600C, but the calcination temperatures were 600 and 1200C."
[5] "Increasing the measurement temperature from room temperature to 580C shifts the maximum position of the bands at about 17,000 and 22,000 cm1 to lower energy by about 700 and 200 cm1, respectively."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Their industrial applications are extensive, particularly in processes involving dehydrogenation, which is vital for producing high-purity propene used in polymer manufacturing. Research focuses on understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, selecting suitable support materials, incorporating promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.

2. The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has led to advancements in their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into alkenes, with a particular emphasis on the impact of alumina pretreatment temperatures. Higher temperatures enhance catalytic activity, potentially due to the increased formation of θ-alumina, which improves performance. Conversely, excessive calcination temperatures can lead to severe deactivation.

3. Variations in alumina pretreatment temperatures significantly influence the catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts. Higher temperatures result in improved activity, likely because they promote the formation of more θ-alumina, a form of alumina known for its superior catalytic properties. However, extreme temperatures can lead to severe deactivation.

4. Continuous UVvis diffuse reflectance (DR) spectroscopy provides real-time insights into the changes occurring within the catalyst during alkane dehydrogenation. It allows researchers to monitor the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+, observe coke formation, and assess the stability of Cr6+ during oxidative regeneration.

5. Changes in the coordination environment and oxidation state of supported metal oxides under reaction conditions can be effectively monitored using optical fiber UVvis DR spectroscopy. This technique is applicable to transition metal ions that exhibit absorption bands in the UVvis region, offering advantages over other methods in terms of data collection speed and compatibility with catalytic fixed-bed reactors.
