[1] "Metallic chromium was discovered in 1933."
[2] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has great industrial importance because it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes for the polymerization and other organic syntheses from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."
[3] "Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."
[4] "The system was found to be highly active and selective in the dehydrogenation of propane at 723-823 K."
[5] "The dehydrogenation of propane in an inert atmosphere has two important inconveniences. The first one is the obliged regeneration process due to coke formation, and the second comes from the high-temperature reaction due to the endothermal nature of the process."
[6] "Under oxidative conditions, the catalytic activity at 673 K, after 5 h of reaction, varies between 0.45 and 1.22 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1 and the deactivation was inappreciable."
[7] "The observed activity values after 300 min of reaction for the pillared Ga/Cr solid series varies between 0.45 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1 (sample Ga/Cr 70/30) and 1.22 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1 (sample Ga/Cr 10/90)."
[8] "Sometimes, VMgO compounds reach activity values of up to 1.8 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1 but always working at 773 K."
[9] "This step probably controls the reaction rate because all observed activities of potassium-exchanged pillared solids and of unexchanged homologues are very similar."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts were discovered in 1933, and they play a significant role in industrial processes, particularly in converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into alkenes through dehydrogenation.
2. Chromium(III) ions are considered active sites in these catalysts, with oxide ions nearby potentially playing a supporting role.
3. Chromium oxide catalysts have shown high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation at temperatures ranging from 723 to 823 K.
4. Dehydrogenation processes in an inert atmosphere suffer from issues like mandatory regeneration due to coke formation and high temperatures caused by the endothermic nature of the process.
5. Under oxidative conditions, chromium oxide catalysts demonstrate stable activity at a lower temperature of 673 K, with insignificant deactivation.
6. The activity of chromium oxide catalysts varies significantly depending on the specific composition, with the Ga/Cr 10/90 sample showing the highest activity.
7. Chromium molybdate compounds can achieve activity levels up to 1.8 μmol of propene per gram of catalyst per hour, but this is typically at a higher temperature of 773 K.
8. The presence of chromium ions on the catalyst surface is crucial for controlling the reaction rate in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
