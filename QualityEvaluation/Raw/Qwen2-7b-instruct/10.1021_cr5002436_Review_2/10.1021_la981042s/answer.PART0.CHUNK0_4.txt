[1] "Metallic catalysts, including metals such as palladium, platinum, and rhodium, were the first catalysts used for dehydrogenation processes. They were discovered in the early 20th century and gained widespread industrial application in the 1930s."
[2] "Since their discovery, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly in terms of their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms."
[3] "The key industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts include the production of alkenes from alkanes, which is crucial for the synthesis of polymers and other organic compounds."
[4] "Research focus areas have encompassed the development of new catalyst structures, the identification of active sites on the catalyst surface, the optimization of support materials to enhance catalyst stability and activity, the incorporation of promoters to improve catalytic performance, and the elucidation of detailed reaction mechanisms."
