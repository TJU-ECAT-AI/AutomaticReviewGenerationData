[1] "Metals deposited on different supports and supported chromium oxide have been used as heterogeneous catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[2] "The system was found to be highly active and selective in the dehydrogenation of propane at 723–823 K."
[3] "The dehydrogenation of propane in an inert atmosphere has two important inconveniences. The first one is the obliged regeneration process due to coke formation, and the second comes from the high-temperature reaction due to the endothermal nature of the process."
[4] "An alternative way is to carry out the catalytic process under oxidative conditions (ODH), that is, with oxygen. This alternative has still two unsolved problems: the reaction mechanism not being well-known and the control of the high reactivity of the reaction products derived from the dehydrogenation process."
[5] "The observed high activity is attributed to the presence of Cr(III) with coordination vacancies that, in an inert atmosphere, can activate propane molecules, yielding propene and hydrogen; while under oxidative conditions is capable of activating oxygen, by a labile coordination between the metal ion and oxygen, and its subsequent transfer to propane yielding propene and water."
[6] "The deactivation of catalysts of this type for DH reactions is a subject of controversy in the literature. While some authors have proposed a correlation between deactivation and the amount of deposited coke on the catalyst,4,30-32 others have attributed this deactivation to the appearance of Cr(II), which would appear simultaneously with the formation and deposition of coke."
[7] "In this structure, Cr(III) active sites are more accessible for propane oxidation than those in the case of Cr2O3 with a corindon-type structure where vacancies are only restricted to the particle surface."
[8] "The activity is practically constant for a long time and the observed activity is also related to the surface chromium content."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been utilized since their discovery in 1933 for dehydrogenation processes, initially focusing on light alkanes. They have evolved to incorporate metals on various supports and chromium oxide, showing high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation under different conditions.

2. Research focuses on understanding the structure of these catalysts, identifying the active sites, optimizing support materials, exploring promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. 

3. Challenges include developing catalysts that operate efficiently at lower temperatures, improving stability against deactivation, and addressing the reaction mechanisms of dehydrogenation under oxidative conditions.

4. Chromium(III) ions play a crucial role in both inert and oxidative environments, activating propane molecules to form propene and hydrogen in the former and oxygen to form propene and water in the latter.

5. Deactivation mechanisms involve coke formation, which affects both inert and oxidative dehydrogenation processes. In oxidative conditions, the appearance of chromium(II) is considered another factor contributing to deactivation.

6. The porous structure of the catalysts enables better accessibility of reactants to the active sites, enhancing the efficiency of propane oxidation under oxidative conditions.

7. Potassium-exchanged catalysts maintain constant activity over time, showing a direct correlation between activity and the amount of surface chromium content.

8. The use of potassium ions in chromium oxide-based catalysts allows for high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation, working at lower temperatures compared to traditional vanadium-containing catalysts.
