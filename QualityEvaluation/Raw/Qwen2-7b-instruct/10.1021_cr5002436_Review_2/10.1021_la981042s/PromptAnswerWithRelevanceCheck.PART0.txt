[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane under oxidative and nonoxidative conditions has been investigated in a flow apparatus."
[2] "Under nonoxidative conditions at 823 K, the initial activity varies between 1.56 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1 for the sample Ga/Cr 70/30 and 2.62 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1 for the sample Ga/Cr 50/50."
[3] "Under oxidative conditions, the catalytic activity at 673 K, after 5 h of reaction, varies between 0.45 and 1.22 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1."
[4] "The system was found to be highly active and selective in the dehydrogenation of propane at 723–823 K."
[5] "Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."
[6] "In the case of the system CrOx/ZrO2 reported by De Rossi et al.,4 the initial activity found for propene was only 0.68 μmol·g-1·s-1, working at the same reaction temperature."
[7] "The deactivation rate and the amount of coke formed are a function of the chromium dispersion and content, the deactivation rate being higher at higher amounts of Cr2O3 deposited on alumina."
[8] "That means, according to De Rossi et al.,4 that oxygen ions located on pillars and zirconium phosphate layers, neighbors to metallic ions, are involved in the DH of propane."
[9] "When comparing DH and ODH data, some interesting points must be noticed: The activity in the conversion of propane to propene is much higher using the oxidative method, the last reaction being at a lower temperature, 673 K."
[10] "A VAPO-5 has been prepared as described by Concepcion et al.13 for a comparative study and tested under the same conditions as the pillared Ga/Cr solids. On one hand, this aluminophosphate presents an activity value of 0.14 μmol of propene·g-1·s-1, a much lower value than those observed for pillared catalysts (Figure 3)."
[11] "In this way, the porous structure of the pillared material improves the accessibility of both molecules to the catalytic active sites."

How have chromium oxide-based catalysts evolved since their discovery in 1933, and what are the key industrial applications and research focus areas (such as structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms) that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes?

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, particularly in their application to dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include:

1. **Structure**: Chromium oxides can exist in various forms, such as supported on various supports, including alumina, zirconia, and layered zirconium phosphates. These structures allow for dispersion of active chromium species, enhancing the accessibility of reactants to active sites.

2. **Active Sites**: Active sites are typically associated with chromium species, especially chromium(III), which can participate in the activation of propane molecules. Chromium(III) species, often in coordination vacancies, are crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane, yielding propene and hydrogen under non-oxidative conditions, or propene and oxygen under oxidative conditions.

3. **Support Materials**: Supports like zirconium phosphate provide a porous structure, enabling better mechanical strength, thermal stability, and large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active chromium species and enhances reactivity.

4. **Promoters**: In the context of this study, gallium (Ga) is introduced as a promoter. The mixed Ga/Cr oxides enhance the catalytic activity, likely due to the enhanced dispersion of active sites and the creation of a more porous structure that facilitates the interaction of propane molecules with active sites.

5. **Reaction Mechanisms**: Under oxidative conditions, chromium species can activate oxygen, leading to the production of water and propene. This mechanism is distinct from non-oxidative conditions, where chromium activates propane directly, producing propene and hydrogen.

6. **Deactivation**: The deactivation of chromium oxide catalysts, particularly due to coke formation, is influenced by factors such as the dispersion and content of chromium. Higher amounts of chromium can lead to faster deactivation rates, highlighting the importance of optimizing chromium concentration for sustained activity.

Research in this field continues to explore the optimization of chromium oxide catalysts, focusing on improving selectivity, stability, and activity, particularly in the context of dehydrogenation processes. The ability to operate at lower temperatures for oxidative dehydrogenation, as demonstrated in this study, represents a significant advancement, potentially reducing energy requirements and enhancing economic viability.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂经历了显著的演变，尤其是在脱氢过程中的工业应用和研究重点领域（如结构、活性位点、支撑材料、促进剂和反应机制）方面。关键的工业应用和研究焦点包括：

1. **结构**：铬氧化物可以以多种形式存在，包括支持在各种支撑材料上，如氧化铝、氧化锆和层状锆磷灰石。这些结构允许活性铬物种的分散，增强反应物与活性位点的接触。

2. **活性位点**：活性位点通常与铬物种相关联，尤其是铬(III)，它可以在非氧化性条件下参与丙烷分子的活化，产生丙烯和氢气，在氧化性条件下则活化氧气，产生水和丙烯。

3. **支撑材料**：支撑材料如层状锆磷灰石提供了多孔结构，增强了机械强度、热稳定性和大表面积，这有利于活性铬物种的分散和提高反应活性。

4. **促进剂**：在此研究中，镓（Ga）作为促进剂引入。混合的Ga/Cr氧化物提高了催化活性，可能是因为活性位点的增强分散以及多孔结构的形成，这有助于丙烷分子与活性位点的相互作用。

5. **反应机制**：在氧化性条件下，铬物种可以激活氧气，导致水和丙烯的生成。这一机制与非氧化性条件下的机制不同，在非氧化性条件下，铬直接活化丙烷，产生丙烯和氢气。

6. **失活**：铬氧化物催化剂的失活，特别是由于焦炭形成，受到因素如铬的分散和含量的影响。更高的铬含量可能导致更快的失活速率，强调优化铬浓度对于保持活动性的重要性。

该领域的研究继续探索铬氧化物催化剂的优化，旨在提高选择性、稳定性和活性，特别是在脱氢过程中。能够在较低温度下进行氧化性脱氢的发现，代表了一项重大进展，可能降低了能源需求并提高了经济可行性。

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Initially, chromium oxide supported on alumina was widely used due to its high refractory surface area. However, issues like rapid deactivation due to side reactions and cracking led to the development of new support materials like zirconium phosphate, which provided a more stable structure for the chromium oxide. The focus shifted towards optimizing the dispersion of chromium oxide, leading to the creation of pillared materials where chromium oxide nanoparticles are permanently separated between the layers of the solid, enhancing the catalyst's surface area and reactivity. Research now emphasizes the role of chromium species, particularly Cr(III), in the activation of both propane molecules and oxygen, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism for oxidative dehydrogenation differs significantly from that of pure dehydrogenation, suggesting that chromium species play a crucial role in the activation of oxygen molecules. The use of potassium ion-exchanged samples also highlights the impact of surface chemistry on the catalyst's performance, indicating that the presence of potassium ions can modify the basicity of oxygen ions adjacent to active metal centers, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

[4] "An alternative way is to carry out the catalytic process under oxidative conditions (ODH), that is, with oxygen. This alternative has still two unsolved problems: the reaction mechanism not being well-known and the control of the high reactivity of the reaction products derived from the dehydrogenation process."
[5] "The observed high activity is attributed to the presence of Cr(III) with coordination vacancies that, in an inert atmosphere, can activate propane molecules, yielding propene and hydrogen; while under oxidative conditions is capable of activating oxygen, by a labile coordination between the metal ion and oxygen, and its subsequent transfer to propane yielding propene and water."
[6] "The deactivation of catalysts of this type for DH reactions is a subject of controversy in the literature. While some authors have proposed a correlation between deactivation and the amount of deposited coke on the catalyst,4,30-32 others have attributed this deactivation to the appearance of Cr(II), which would appear simultaneously with the formation and deposition of coke."
[7] "In this structure, Cr(III) active sites are more accessible for propane oxidation than those in the case of Cr2O3 with a corindon-type structure where vacancies are only restricted to the particle surface."
[8] "The activity is practically constant for a long time and the observed activity is also related to the surface chromium content."
