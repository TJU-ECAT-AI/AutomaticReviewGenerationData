The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Initially, chromium oxide supported on alumina was widely used due to its high refractory surface area. However, issues like rapid deactivation due to side reactions and cracking led to the development of new support materials like zirconium phosphate, which provided a more stable structure for the chromium oxide. The focus shifted towards optimizing the dispersion of chromium oxide, leading to the creation of pillared materials where chromium oxide nanoparticles are permanently separated between the layers of the solid, enhancing the catalyst's surface area and reactivity. Research now emphasizes the role of chromium species, particularly Cr(III), in the activation of both propane molecules and oxygen, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism for oxidative dehydrogenation differs significantly from that of pure dehydrogenation, suggesting that chromium species play a crucial role in the activation of oxygen molecules. The use of potassium ion-exchanged samples also highlights the impact of surface chemistry on the catalyst's performance, indicating that the presence of potassium ions can modify the basicity of oxygen ions adjacent to active metal centers, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展已经显著地推进了对它们结构、活性位点、支持材料、促进剂和反应机制的理解。最初，由于其高耐火表面面积，铝氧合物上支持的铬氧化物被广泛用作轻烷烃脱氢的异质催化剂。然而，由于快速失活和副反应等问题，导致了新的支持材料的发展，如锆磷酸盐，为铬氧化物提供了更稳定的结构。研究重点转向优化铬氧化物的分散，通过创造层间隔开的纳米颗粒结构，提高了催化剂的表面积和活性。现在，研究强调铬物种，特别是Cr(III)，在促进丙烷分子和氧气激活中的作用，促进了脱氢过程。氧化脱氢的机制与纯脱氢大不相同，表明铬物种在激活氧气分子中起着关键作用。钾离子交换样品的应用也突出了表面化学对催化剂性能的影响，表明钾离子的存在可以修改相邻活性金属中心的氧离子的基本性，从而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。
