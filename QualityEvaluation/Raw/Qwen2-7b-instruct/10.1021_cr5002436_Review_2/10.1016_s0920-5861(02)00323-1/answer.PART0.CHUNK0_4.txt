<p>Vanadium was discovered in 1801 in Mexico by the Spanish mineralogist A.M. del Rio, who considered it to be present in a particular brownish lead mineral.</p>
<p>Vanadium is one of the most abundant and widely distributed metals in the earths crust and is found in about 152 different minerals, in certain iron ores and also in the form of organic complexes in some crude oils.</p>
<p>The major sources of vanadium are titaniferrous magnetite ores from mines in Australia, China, Russia and South Africa.</p>
<p>Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are used in the manufacture of important chemicals (e.g. sulfuric acid, phthalic anhydride) and in the reduction of environmental pollution (e.g. nitrogen oxides from flue gas of power plants).</p>
<p>The importance of vanadium in supported metal oxide catalysis is further underlined by Fig. 1. This figure summarizes the number of papers (expressed as a percentage of the total number of papers) of several transition metals in the field of metal oxide catalysis, which can be found in the open literature.</p>
<p>Most catalysts based on vanadium oxide consist of a vanadium oxide phase deposited on the surface of an oxide support, such as SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2.</p>
<p>Supporting a metal oxide on the surface of another oxide was initially proposed to improve the catalytic activity of the active metal oxide phase due to a gain in surface area and mechanical strength.</p>
<p>However, during the last decade catalyst scientists have unambiguously shown that the activity and selectivity of supported metal oxide catalysts are significantly affected by the properties of the support oxide material. This is generally known as the metal oxidesupport effect, although its exact origin and mechanism of operation is still unclear.</p>
<p>The fundamental basis for the catalytic performances of supported vanadium oxides lies in the variability in geometric and electronic structure of surface vanadium oxides.</p>

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant, driven by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include dehydrogenation processes where these catalysts play crucial roles. The research focus areas have shifted towards optimizing these aspects to enhance efficiency and selectivity in chemical synthesis, particularly in the production of valuable chemicals such as sulfuric acid and phthalic anhydride. The metal oxide-support effect, which impacts the activity and selectivity of supported catalysts, continues to be an active area of investigation. Understanding the geometric and electronic structures of surface chromium oxides has become fundamental to improving their performance in various catalytic applications.
