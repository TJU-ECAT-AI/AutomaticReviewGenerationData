The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant, primarily due to advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These catalysts are crucial in dehydrogenation processes, facilitating the conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable products like alkenes. Key industrial applications include refining and petrochemical processes, where they enhance efficiency and yield. Research focuses on optimizing catalyst properties for better performance, stability, and selectivity, aiming to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact. The development of more sophisticated characterization techniques and theoretical models has been instrumental in advancing the field, allowing for more precise control over catalyst behavior and improved design of dehydrogenation processes.
