[1] "Vanadium was discovered in 1801 in Mexico by the Spanish mineralogist A.M. del Rio."
[2] "Later on, in 1830, the Swedish chemist N.G. Sefstrm rediscovered the element and named it in honor of Vanadis, the old Norse name for the Scandinavian goddess Freyjaa fertility goddess because of its beautiful multicolored compounds."
[3] "Titaniumaluminumvanadium alloys are used in, e.g. aero-engine gas turbines and in the undercarriages of planes."
[4] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are used in the manufacture of important chemicals (e.g. sulfuric acid, phthalic anhydride) and in the reduction of environmental pollution (e.g. nitrogen oxides from flue gas of power plants)."
[5] "This figure summarizes the number of papers (expressed as a percentage of the total number of papers) of several transition metals in the field of metal oxide catalysis, which can be found in the open literature."

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in the late 19th century. They are now widely used in industrial processes, particularly in the manufacturing of important chemicals such as sulfuric acid and phthalic anhydride, and in the reduction of environmental pollution from sources like power plant emissions. Key industrial applications and research focus areas include the structure of the catalysts, identification of active sites, selection of support materials, use of promoters, and understanding of reaction mechanisms.
