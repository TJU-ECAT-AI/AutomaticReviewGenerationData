The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These developments have significantly contributed to their importance in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the production of various chemicals, such as sulfuric acid and phthalic anhydride, and the reduction of environmental pollution, notably through the abatement of nitrogen oxides from power plant flue gases. The fundamental performance of these catalysts is rooted in the variability of their geometric and electronic structures. The metal oxidesupport effect, which refers to the significant impact of the support oxide properties on the catalyst's activity and selectivity, remains an area of ongoing research despite efforts to elucidate its precise origin and operational mechanism. While the document does not provide an exhaustive list of all catalytic applications, it emphasizes the importance of spectroscopic tools in advancing our understanding of the chemistry of supported vanadium oxides throughout their life cycle, from synthesis to deactivation. This includes examining the molecular structures under hydrated, dehydrated, and reduced conditions, as well as the active surface vanadium oxide during specific reactions like the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and the deactivation of fluid catalytic cracking catalysts.
