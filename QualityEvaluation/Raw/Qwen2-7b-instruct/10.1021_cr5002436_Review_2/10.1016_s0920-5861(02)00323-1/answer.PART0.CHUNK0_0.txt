<p>Vanadium was discovered in 1801 in Mexico by the Spanish mineralogist A.M. del Rio...</p>
<p>In 1830, the Swedish chemist N.G. Sefstrm rediscovered the element and named it in honor of Vanadis, the old Norse name for the fertility goddess because of its beautiful multicolored compounds.</p>
<p>The major sources of vanadium are titaniferrous magnetite ores from mines in Australia, China, Russia and South Africa.</p>
<p>Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are used in the manufacture of important chemicals (e.g. sulfuric acid, phthalic anhydride) and in the reduction of environmental pollution (e.g. nitrogen oxides from flue gas of power plants).</p>
<p>The fundamental basis for the catalytic performances of supported vanadium oxides lies in the variability in geometric and electronic structure of surface vanadium oxides.</p>
<p>The importance of vanadium in supported metal oxide catalysis is further underlined by Fig. 1. This figure summarizes the number of papers (expressed as a percentage of the total number of papers) of several transition metals in the field of metal oxide catalysis, which can be found in the open literature.</p>
<p>Most catalysts based on vanadium oxide consist of a vanadium oxide phase deposited on the surface of an oxide support, such as SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2.</p>
<p>Supporting a metal oxide on the surface of another oxide was initially proposed to improve the catalytic activity of the active metal oxide phase due to a gain in surface area and mechanical strength.</p>
<p>During the last decade catalyst scientists have unambiguously shown that the activity and selectivity of supported metal oxide catalysts are significantly affected by the properties of the support oxide material. This is generally known as the metal oxidesupport effect, although its exact origin and mechanism of operation is still unclear.</p>
<p>No exhaustive discussion of all the catalytic applications of supported vanadium oxides available in the open literature will be given (Table 2).</p>

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by advancements in understanding their structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms. These developments have significantly contributed to their importance in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the production of various chemicals, such as sulfuric acid and phthalic anhydride, and the reduction of environmental pollution, notably through the abatement of nitrogen oxides from power plant flue gases. The fundamental performance of these catalysts is rooted in the variability of their geometric and electronic structures. The metal oxidesupport effect, which refers to the significant impact of the support oxide properties on the catalyst's activity and selectivity, remains an area of ongoing research despite efforts to elucidate its precise origin and operational mechanism. While the document does not provide an exhaustive list of all catalytic applications, it emphasizes the importance of spectroscopic tools in advancing our understanding of the chemistry of supported vanadium oxides throughout their life cycle, from synthesis to deactivation. This includes examining the molecular structures under hydrated, dehydrated, and reduced conditions, as well as the active surface vanadium oxide during specific reactions like the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and the deactivation of fluid catalytic cracking catalysts.
