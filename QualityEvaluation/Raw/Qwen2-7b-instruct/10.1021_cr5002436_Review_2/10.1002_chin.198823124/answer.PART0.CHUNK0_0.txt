The literature discusses the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over V-Mg-O catalysts, focusing on the effects of changing the propane/O2 ratio on propane conversion and propene formation selectivity. It was published on June 7, 1988, and has been cited 10 times. The abstract highlights that at temperatures between 500-540°C, altering the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 leads to a decrease in propane conversion from 33% to 23% and an increase in propene formation selectivity from 43% to 53%.
