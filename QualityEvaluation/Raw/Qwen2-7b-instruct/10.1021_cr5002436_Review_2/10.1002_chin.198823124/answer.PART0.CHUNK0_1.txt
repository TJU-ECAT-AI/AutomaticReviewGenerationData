<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over V-Mg-O catalysts has been studied in the literature. At temperatures ranging from 500 to 540 degrees Celsius, changing the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 leads to a decrease in propane conversion (from 33% to 23%) and an increase in the selectivity of propene formation (from 43% to 53%).

文献中研究了V-Mg-O催化剂上丙烷的选择性氧化脱氢。在500至540摄氏度的温度范围内，将丙烷/O2的比例从1:2更改为1:1会导致丙烷转化率（从33%降至23%）下降以及丙烯形成选择性的提高（从43%增至53%）。
