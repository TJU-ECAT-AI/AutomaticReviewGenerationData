Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over V-Mg-O catalysts, focusing on the effects of changing the propane/O2 ratio on propane conversion and propene formation selectivity. It was published on June 7, 1988, and has been cited 10 times. The abstract highlights that at temperatures between 500-540°C, altering the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 leads to a decrease in propane conversion from 33% to 23% and an increase in propene formation selectivity from 43% to 53%.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over V-Mg-O catalysts has been studied in the literature. At temperatures ranging from 500 to 540 degrees Celsius, changing the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 leads to a decrease in propane conversion (from 33% to 23%) and an increase in the selectivity of propene formation (from 43% to 53%).
