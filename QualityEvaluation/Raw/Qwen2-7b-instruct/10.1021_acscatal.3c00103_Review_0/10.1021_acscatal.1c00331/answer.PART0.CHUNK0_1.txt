[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
[2] "The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity."
[3] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[4] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[5] "There are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH. The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
[6] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH. The role of small-sized (around 3 nm) Pt particles is not yet clear in the literature."
[7] "Some studies indicated that they are very coke resistance, but the opposites were also reported."
[8] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
[9] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."
[10] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."
[11] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."
[12] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."

In response to the increasing industrial demand for propylene, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are employed to address the challenges posed by traditional production methods. PDH offers a more efficient and effective route to mass produce propylene, thereby meeting the rising demands. However, the catalysts utilized in PDH, particularly those based on platinum (Pt), face significant deactivation issues due to the formation of coke. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome these problems by enhancing stability and improving recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of cofeeding reductive gases like hydrogen, promoting Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn), and modifying the nature of the support material to control coke formation. Additionally, the exploration of small-sized Pt particles, single Pt atom catalysts, and computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) contribute to a deeper understanding of the deactivation mechanism and the complex reaction network involved in PDH. These advancements pave the way for more efficient and sustainable PDH processes.

为应对丙烯需求的急剧增加，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术被用来解决传统生产方法带来的挑战。PDH提供了一种更高效、更有效的途径来大量生产丙烯，以满足不断增长的需求。然而，用于PDH的催化剂，特别是基于铂（Pt）的催化剂，面临着由于焦炭形成而导致的严重失活问题。创新的催化剂设计策略旨在通过增强稳定性并提高在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中的可回收性来克服这些问题。这些策略包括使用共喂养还原气体，如氢气，促进Pt与第二金属（如锡（Sn）），以及修改支撑材料的性质以控制焦炭形成。此外，探索小型化Pt颗粒、单个Pt原子催化剂和基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算模拟有助于对PDH的失活机制和涉及的复杂反应网络有更深的理解。这些进展为更有效和可持续的PDH过程铺平了道路。
