[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
[2] "The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity."
[3] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[4] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
[5] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[6] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
[7] "In recent days, the new strategies of catalysts design in PDH are proposed and verified to effectively curb coke formation."
[8] "For example, the size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance."
[9] "Moreover, the size and exposed surfaces are also found to influence the reaction mechanism and kinetics of PDH."
[10] "Furthermore, the size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance."
[11] "The coke is formed immediately when the catalyst is exposed to propane, as shown in Figure 3."
[12] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
[13] "The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support."
[14] "Furthermore, hydrogens also aggregate the degree of coke graphitization which requires a higher regeneration temperature."
[15] "The promoters, such as Sn, directly tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both a geometry and electronic perspective, which simultaneously increase activity and stability."
[16] "The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH."
[17] "The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing a more efficient and selective route to produce propylene compared to traditional methods such as catalytic cracking. This is achieved by converting propane directly into propylene, which is both energy-intensive and selective.

2. Innovative catalyst design strategies for PDH include the use of single atom/site and confined metal cluster catalysts. These catalysts exploit the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions, and can be deposited in specific positions within zeolites, taking advantage of unique interactions between the catalyst and support material, thereby enhancing stability and reducing coke formation.

3. The Pt-based catalysts used in PDH have been extensively studied due to their high selectivity and durability. However, coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade their performance and stability.

4. The coke formation in PDH is addressed through methods such as cofeeding hydrogen, which removes the coke precursor and weakens the acidity of the support, thus reducing coke formation.

5. Metal promoters like tin (Sn) are used to modify the Pt catalysts, affecting their geometry and electronic properties. This modification simultaneously increases the activity and stability of the catalysts, contributing to better performance in PDH.

6. The coke formation starts immediately upon exposure of the catalyst to propane, as indicated by rapid coke deposition in the initial moments of the reaction.

7. Various methods have been proposed in literature to mitigate coke formation in PDH, including cofeeding reductive gases, using alloyed Pt catalysts, modifying the support material, and employing new catalyst designs like single atom/sites and confined clusters.

8. Hydrogen cofeeding in PDH helps remove the coke precursor and weakens the acidity of the support, leading to a reduction in coke formation and improved catalyst stability.

9. Metal promoters such as copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), and indium (In) can be added to the Pt catalysts. These promoters have been found to have similar effects to tin in improving selectivity and stability, often attributed to the bimetallic interaction between Pt and the promoter.

10. The addition of aluminum (Al) to the Pt catalyst can increase the coking rate due to the introduction of more acidic sites. However, the optimal composition, such as PtSnAl0.2/SBA-15, can be determined to balance activity and stability.

11. The support material plays a critical role in coke formation. The use of modified supports like PtSn/ZnAl2O4, PtSn/CeAl2O3, and Ga-modified Mg(Al)O can improve the catalyst's ability to resist coking.

12. The pore structure of the support affects both the activity and stability of the catalyst. A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more coke, impacting the catalyst's performance.

13. New strategies like single atom/site and confined cluster catalysts are being developed. These catalysts show promise in reducing coke formation and improving stability, as they can exploit the size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH.

14. The coke formation in PDH is inevitable, but strategies like transferring coke from the active metal to the support can help accommodate more coke before regeneration, extending the catalyst's life.

15. To address the complex issue of coke formation in PDH, collaborations between experimental and computational techniques are needed to understand the mechanisms at a molecular level, including the transformation between disordered coke and graphitic coke.

1. 近年来，丙烯的需求急剧增加，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供比传统方法更高效、选择性更高的途径来生产丙烯，以应对这一挑战。这种方法直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，既消耗能量又具有高选择性。

2. PDH催化剂设计的新策略包括单原子/位点和受限金属簇催化剂的使用。这些催化剂利用了脱氢和副反应对尺寸依赖性的不同，并且可以在沸石中特定位置沉积，利用催化剂和支持材料之间的独特相互作用，从而增强稳定性并减少焦炭形成。

3. 铂基催化剂在PDH中被广泛研究，因为它们具有高选择性和耐用性。然而，焦炭在反应过程中形成会显著降低其性能和稳定性。

4. PDH中的焦炭形成通过向系统中添加氢气的方法得到缓解，这可以去除焦炭前体并减弱支撑物的酸性，从而减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂稳定性。

5. 铜（Cu）、铝（Al）和铟（In）等金属促进剂被添加到铂催化剂中，这些促进剂对铂催化剂的作用与锡相似，提高了选择性和稳定性，通常归因于铂和促进剂之间的二元合金效应。

6. 添加铝（Al）到铂催化剂中可能会增加焦炭生成率，因为这引入了更多的酸性位点。然而，确定最佳组成，如PtSnAl0.2/SBA-15，可以平衡活性和稳定性。

7. 支持材料在焦炭形成中起关键作用。使用改性支持材料，如PtSn/ZnAl2O4、PtSn/CeAl2O3和Ga修饰的Mg(Al)O，可以改善催化剂抵抗焦炭的能力。

8. 支持结构影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。具有更均匀、更高连接和更大孔径的孔结构的支持可以容纳更多焦炭，影响催化剂的性能。

9. 新策略，如单原子/位点和受限簇催化剂的开发，显示出在减少焦炭形成和提高稳定性方面的潜力，因为它们可以利用PDH中脱氢和副反应对尺寸的依赖性。

10. 在PDH中，焦炭的形成是不可避免的，但可以通过转移焦炭从活性金属到支撑物来帮助在再生之前容纳更多焦炭，从而延长催化剂的使用寿命。

11. 为了应对PDH中复杂的问题，需要实验技术和计算技术之间的合作，以理解分子水平上的机制，包括无序焦炭和石墨化焦炭之间的转变。

12. 为了进一步减少焦炭的影响，建议采用以下三个方面：
   1. 创新的活性中心设计：几何活性位点已被证实是控制焦炭形成的关键因素。单个铂已经足以从丙烷中提取氢，而副反应，如氢解，则需要多个PtPt位点。因此，由合金和通过支持物的空间限制合成的小集合铂（如铂单原子线或周围被不活跃元素包围的铂单原子）似乎是良好的候选者。
   2. 焦炭迁移：在PDH中，焦炭的形成是不可避免的。在活性金属和支撑物之间容纳更多焦炭并在再生前保持活性的一种有效方式是使焦炭迁移。迁移与金属和支撑物的性质紧密相关，如氧的活性和孔结构，以及金属-支撑界面也会影响迁移。因此，解决焦炭迁移机制需要结合实验表征和第一原理模拟。
   3. 焦炭形成动力学：目前可用的模型主要提供了现象描述，而对于无序焦炭和石墨化焦炭之间的转变进行深入研究的研究极为罕见，这阻碍了发现有效方法抑制焦炭的发展。这可能是由于焦炭前体的多样性以及网络的复杂性所致。虽然将此方法应用于PDH中的焦炭可能并不直接，但对于石墨生长的金属催化剂所采用的方法，例如大规模动力学蒙特卡洛模拟（110-112）和分子动力学（113-115），可能为提供更多见解。
