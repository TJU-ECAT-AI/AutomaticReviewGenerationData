<p>As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years.</p>
<p>There are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH.</p>
<p>It is revealed that the geometry of the active sites has a pivotal importance to side reactions.</p>
<p>The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation.</p>
<p>A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts.</p>
<p>Although the exact composition of coke is still under debate, the precursors of coke are most likely to be from the deep dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide.</p>
<p>For example, the size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance.</p>
<p>The catalyst containing smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the size and exposed surfaces are also found to influence the reaction mechanism and kinetics of PDH.</p>
<p>Specifically, the electronic effect is found to influence the energy barrier of dehydrogenation and desorption of products, and the geometry effect has effects on the local coverage of free sites for the side reaction.</p>
<p>In recent days, the new strategies of catalysts design in PDH are proposed and verified to effectively curb coke formation.</p>
<p>The concept of a single atom/site is applicable for Pt catalysts, which achieve not only good activity but also impressive stability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis are size-dependent.</p>
<p>Under this principle, single atom/site strategies were explored to optimize PDH performance.</p>
<p>Overall, the application of single atom/site not only significantly reduce the coke formation but also create a new direction to optimize PDH performance.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a more efficient route to produce propylene. The oxidative PDH process involves converting propane into propylene through a catalytic reaction, while nonoxidative PDH methods aim to do so without the use of oxygen. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both types of PDH processes. These strategies focus on modifying the catalyst structure, composition, and support to reduce coke deposition, which is a major cause of deactivation and instability in PDH.

2. The innovative catalyst design strategies include:

   - **Cofeeding gases**: Using hydrogen and water vapor to remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support, thereby reducing coke formation.
   - **Metal promoters**: Incorporating tin (Sn) or other metals as promoters to modify the nature of the Pt catalyst. Sn, for instance, can constrain Pt into smaller ensembles, reducing the occurrence of side reactions and enhancing stability.
   - **Support modification**: Altering the nature of the support to control coke formation. This can involve changing the support's acidity or introducing additives that facilitate the transfer of coke from the active metal to the support.
   - **New catalyst design**: Developing new catalyst designs such as single atom/sites or confined metal clusters. These designs exploit the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH, aiming to reduce coke formation while maintaining high activity and stability.
   - **Regeneration strategies**: Implementing methods to periodically regenerate the catalyst by burning off coke deposits, while minimizing the risk of catalyst sintering or loss of dispersion.

These strategies collectively aim to improve the efficiency and longevity of PDH processes, making them more viable and sustainable for industrial use.

1. 烷烃脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供更高效的丙烯生产途径，解决了化工行业对丙烯需求激增和传统生产方法的局限性。氧化PDH过程涉及通过催化剂反应将丙烷转化为丙烯，而非氧化PDH方法则旨在无需氧气的情况下实现这一目标。为了克服失活、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，适用于两种类型的PDH过程。

2. 创新的催化剂设计策略包括：

   - **共喂养气体**：利用氢气和水蒸气去除焦炭前体并减弱支撑物的酸性，从而减少焦炭形成。
   - **金属促进剂**：引入锡（Sn）或其他金属作为促进剂来修改铂催化剂的性质。例如，Sn可以约束铂进入较小的团簇，减少副反应的发生，增强稳定性。
   - **支撑材料修改**：改变支撑材料的性质以控制焦炭形成。这可能涉及改变支撑材料的酸碱性或引入添加剂，使焦炭从活性金属转移到支撑材料。
   - **新型催化剂设计**：开发单原子/位点或受限金属簇等新催化剂设计。这些设计利用PDH中脱氢和副反应随尺寸依赖性，旨在减少焦炭形成的同时保持高活性和稳定性。
   - **再生策略**：实施周期性再生催化剂的方法，如燃烧掉焦炭沉积物，同时尽量避免催化剂聚集或分散性的损失。

这些策略共同旨在提高PDH过程的效率和持久性，使其更适合工业应用，并且更加可行和可持续。
