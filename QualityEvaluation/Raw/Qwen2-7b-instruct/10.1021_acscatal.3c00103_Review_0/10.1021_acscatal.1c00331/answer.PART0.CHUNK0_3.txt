[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
[2] "The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity."
[3] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[4] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH."
[5] "It is indicated that Sn promoter could constrain Pt in a small ensemble, which is detrimental to side reactions."
[6] "The role of small-sized (around 3 nm) Pt particles is not yet clear in the literature."
[7] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
[8] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."
[9] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."
[10] "The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation."
[11] "It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."
[12] "The composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."
[13] "Overall, the prevention of coke formation achieved impressive progress, and many efforts have been made to understand and alleviate the detrimental effects."
[14] "The most straightforward method to curb coke is to modify the structure and composition of the Pt catalyst."
[15] "The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH."
[16] "The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by providing an efficient and effective route to produce propylene, especially in on-purpose catalytic processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

2. The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved due to the complex process of coke formation. Coke is typically composed of aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite species, but the specific composition varies with reaction conditions and catalyst systems.

3. Single atom/site strategies and confined Pt clusters in zeolite have been developed to exploit the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH. These strategies show promise in reducing coke formation and enhancing catalyst stability.

4. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) provide valuable insights into the deactivation mechanisms of PDH catalysts, aiding in the development of more effective catalyst designs.
