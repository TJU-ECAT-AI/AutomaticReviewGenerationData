<p>Although these catalyst candidates show excellent activity in a laboratory test, they are still not industrially implemented.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of chromium oxide catalyst is the toxicity, which potentially causes issues with regard to safety and post-treatment.</p>
<p>Another side effect of coke removal is that the catalyst could agglomerate and lose activity under harsh conditions during regeneration.</p>
<p>There is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability.</p>
<p>It is suggested that Sn blocked the undercoordinated sites and constrained Pt particles into smaller ensembles.</p>
<p>Moreover, the electronic effect is also revealed. The X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra showed that the absorption edge is shifted to higher energy, indicating Sn withdraws electrons from Pt.</p>
<p>However, the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still not concluded as there is a lack of guiding principle to govern a search.</p>
<p>The data from either experiment or computation feed into a machine learning model, which not only efficiently screens highly effective catalysts candidates but also possibly identifies a valid descriptor.</p>
