The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique addresses the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering an alternative to oil-based cracking processes. It produces propene, a crucial industrial chemical. Commercial PDH technologies employing catalysts with chromium or platinum suffer from environmental concerns due to the toxicity of chromium compounds and the ecological harm caused by using chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial zinc oxide (ZnO). These catalysts are designed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. The development utilizes a mixture or layered structure of ZnO with a support material such as zeolite or a common metal oxide. The active ZnOx species are formed through a reaction of support hydroxyl (OH) groups with zinc atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550°C. The role of defective OH groups is identified as crucial for the formation of active ZnOx species. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and its commercial analogue, KCrOx/Al2O3, are tested under industrially relevant conditions, demonstrating a significant increase in propene productivity while maintaining comparable propene selectivity.
