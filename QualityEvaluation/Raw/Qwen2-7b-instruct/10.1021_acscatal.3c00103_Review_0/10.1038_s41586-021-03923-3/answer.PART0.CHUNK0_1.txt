"Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2."
"This metal oxide and a support (zeolite or common metal oxide) are used as a physical mixture or in the form of two layers with ZnO as the upstream layer."
"Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C."
"For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered a viable alternative to traditional oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an essential industrial chemical. The innovative approach involves the development of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.

2. The catalyst design strategy involves combining ZnO with a support material, which can be zeolite or a common metal oxide, either as a physical mixture or in a layered structure with ZnO as the top layer. 

3. Upon reductive treatment at temperatures above 550°C, Zn atoms from ZnO react with OH groups on the support surface to form active ZnOx species. Defective OH groups play a crucial role in the formation of these active species.

4. The newly developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst was tested alongside a commercial analogue of KCrOx/Al2O3 under industrially relevant conditions for approximately 400 hours on a propane stream, demonstrating high propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

1. PDH是生产丙烯这一工业基础化学品的重要替代石油裂解工艺的选择。创新方法涉及基于商用ZnO开发环境兼容的催化剂。

2. 催化剂设计策略包括将ZnO与支持材料（如沸石或普通金属氧化物）结合，作为物理混合物或以分层结构存在，其中ZnO位于顶层。

3. 在超过550°C的还原处理过程中，ZnO中的Zn原子与支持表面的OH基团反应形成活性ZnOx物种。有缺陷的OH基团在形成这些活性物种中起着决定性作用。

4. 新开发的ZnOsilicalite-1催化剂与商业KCrOx/Al2O3的类比在相同设置下，在接近丙烷转化率的情况下，对丙烷流进行了大约400小时的测试，显示出类似丙烯选择性的高丙烯生产力。
