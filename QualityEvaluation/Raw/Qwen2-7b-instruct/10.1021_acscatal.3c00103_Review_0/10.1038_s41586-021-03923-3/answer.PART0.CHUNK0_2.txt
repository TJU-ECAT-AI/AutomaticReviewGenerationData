<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2.</p>
<p>The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.</p>
<p>This metal oxide and a support (zeolite or common metal oxide) are used as a physical mixture or in the form of two layers with ZnO as the upstream layer.</p>
<p>For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.</p>
<p>The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.</p>

The literature discusses an innovative catalyst design strategy for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) aimed at addressing the challenges of traditional production methods, particularly focusing on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability. The approach involves the preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. These catalysts are designed to work in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, with the key innovation lying in the formation of active ZnOx species through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550°C. The development of ZnOsilicalite-1 and its comparison with a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates the effectiveness of this strategy in achieving higher propene productivity while maintaining comparable propene selectivity.

文献讨论了一种用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）的创新催化剂设计策略，旨在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战，特别是针对克服活性衰减问题、提高稳定性和增强可循环利用性的策略。该方法涉及基于商用ZnO制备环境兼容的负载型催化剂。这些催化剂被设计为在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中工作，关键创新在于通过将支持OH基团与在550°C以上还原处理时从ZnO生成的Zn原子反应形成活性ZnOx物种。开发的ZnOsilicalite-1及其与商业KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂的比较表明，这种策略在保持相似的丙烯选择性的同时实现更高的丙烯产率的有效性。
