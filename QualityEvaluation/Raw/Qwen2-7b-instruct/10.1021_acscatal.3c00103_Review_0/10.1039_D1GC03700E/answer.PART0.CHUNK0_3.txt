[1] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
[2] "In the case of DDH, the formation of coke remains the biggest challenge, as it is thermodynamically favoured under conditions that enable high propane conversion."
[3] "Overoxidation is prevalent due to CO2 being the thermodynamically favoured product."
[4] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
[5] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
[6] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
[7] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
[8] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."

1. Propane dehydrogenation techniques, particularly oxidative and non-oxidative processes, address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering more environmentally friendly and sustainable alternatives. They aim to produce propylene with high efficiency, using non-toxic reactants and potentially renewable feedstocks. Catalyst design strategies focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability to ensure efficient and sustainable production processes.

2. In non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the formation of coke is a significant challenge. This is because coke formation is thermodynamically favored under the conditions that maximize propylene yield. To overcome this issue, catalysts need to be designed to minimize coke formation while maximizing propylene yield.

3. In oxidative PDH, overoxidation is a common issue, which leads to the formation of unwanted by-products like CO and CO2. This is because CO2 is thermodynamically favored under the reaction conditions. Catalyst design for oxidative PDH should aim to control overoxidation to enhance propylene yield.

4. The scarcity of certain catalyst elements, such as platinum and chromium, is addressed by recommending the use of more abundant chemical elements. This can help in reducing costs and increasing the sustainability of PDH processes.

5. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in PDH offers environmental advantages, as it can consume CO2 in the process. However, the low activity of catalysts in the oxidative PDH of propane limits its practical application. Further research is needed to develop more active catalysts for CO2-based PDH.

6. Catalyst design considerations vary for different PDH processes. Regardless of the method, the balance between acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial. This balance affects the efficiency of the PDH reaction, influencing both the selectivity to propylene and the stability of the catalyst.

7. Future research in PDH should prioritize improving the selectivity of catalysts to propylene in both non-oxidative and oxidative PDH processes. For CO2-based PDH, the low intrinsic activity of catalysts towards CO2 presents a significant barrier to commercial application, requiring further optimization of catalyst design.

8. The overarching theme in catalyst design for PDH processes is the optimization of the surface chemistry of the catalyst to achieve the desired balance between propylene yield and selectivity, while minimizing unwanted side reactions. This requires a detailed understanding of the specific requirements of each PDH sub-reaction, including the role of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface.

1. 烯烃脱氢（PDH）技术，特别是氧化性和非氧化性过程，通过提供更环保和可持续的选择来应对工业对丙烯需求增加以及传统生产方法的局限性。它们旨在高效地使用无毒反应物和潜在的可再生能源来生产丙烯。催化剂设计策略集中在克服脱活问题、提高稳定性和可回收性，以确保高效的可持续生产过程。

2. 在非氧化性PDH中，焦炭的形成是最大的挑战，因为焦炭的形成在能够最大化丙烯产率的条件下是热力学上有利的。为了克服这一问题，催化剂需要被设计成在减少焦炭形成的同时最大化丙烯产率。

3. 在氧化PDH中，过氧化是常见的问题，导致形成不希望的副产品如CO和CO2。这是因为CO2是在反应条件下热力学上优选的产品。氧化PDH的催化剂设计应致力于控制过氧化以增强丙烯产率。

5. 使用CO2作为软氧化剂在PDH中提供了环境优势，因为它可以在过程中消耗CO2。然而，丙烷氧化PDH中催化剂的低活性限制了其实际应用。进一步的研究需要开发更活跃的催化剂用于基于CO2的PDH。

6. PDH过程的催化剂设计考虑各不相同。无论方法如何，催化剂表面的酸性和碱性位点之间的平衡至关重要。这种平衡影响PDH反应的效率，影响丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

7. 未来PDH研究应优先提高催化剂的丙烯选择性，在非氧化性和氧化PDH过程中。对于基于CO2的PDH，催化剂对CO2的低内在活性构成了商业应用的重大障碍，需要进一步优化催化剂设计。

8. PDH过程催化剂设计的核心主题是优化催化剂表面化学，实现所需的丙烯产率与选择性的平衡，同时最小化不必要的副反应。这需要深入了解每个PDH子反应的具体要求，包括催化剂表面酸性和碱性位点的作用。
