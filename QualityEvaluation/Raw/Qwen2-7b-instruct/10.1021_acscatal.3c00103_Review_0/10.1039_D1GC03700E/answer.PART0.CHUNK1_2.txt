[1] "Despite SiO2 having a large surface area, and that many different types of silica supports having been tested, the low reactivity of silanol groups towards V precursors means that a relatively low loading of isolated V sites are reported."

In addressing the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques utilize innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. 

For oxidative PDH, the review by Carrero et al. highlights that the activity of supported vanadia catalysts can be explained by the energy of oxygen defect formation, which defines the reducibility of the site and the redox potential. This insight guides the optimization of catalyst formulations.

To improve catalyst activity, acidic supports have been explored, as they increase the activity of ODH-O2 catalysts. For instance, supporting vanadia on SBA-15 via wet impregnation achieves a high surface density of 1.6 V nm2 without V2O5 crystallite formation, boosting dispersion and activity.

Nonetheless, the use of acidic supports can negatively impact selectivity and overall productivity, as they tend to activate propene. Balancing the support's acidity to maintain high selectivity is a critical challenge in PDH catalyst design.

In nonoxidative PDH, the cationanion double hydrolysis (CADH) approach has been employed to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, with the crystallization temperature varying between 25120 C. This method directly impacts the catalyst's performance.

The addition of sodium ions to the silica support enhances the dispersion of isolated vanadia species, boosting propane conversion. This example showcases the role of surface modification in improving catalyst performance.

These strategies exemplify the ongoing efforts in PDH catalyst design to optimize activity, selectivity, and stability, addressing the challenges in propylene production efficiently and sustainably.

针对丙烷需求量增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过创新催化剂设计策略来解决脱活问题、增强稳定性和提高可回收性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中均取得了显著进展。

卡雷罗等人的综述指出，支持型钒基催化剂的活性可以由氧缺陷形成能解释，这决定了位点的还原性和电化学性质。这一洞察指导了催化剂配方的优化。

为了提高催化剂活性，已探索使用酸性支持物，它们增加了ODH-O2催化剂的活性。例如，通过湿浸渍在SBA-15上支持的钒，实现了高达1.6 V nm2的表面密度，而没有形成V2O5结晶体，从而增强了分散性和活性。

然而，酸性支持物可能导致选择性降低和总体生产力下降，因为它们倾向于激活丙烯。平衡支持物的酸性以保持高选择性是PDH催化剂设计中的关键挑战。

在非氧化性PDH中，已经采用离子双水解（CADH）方法合成具有高比表面积和纯γ-Al2O3相的介孔Al2O3，结晶温度在25120 C之间变化。这种方法直接影响催化剂性能。

向硅酸盐支持物中添加钠离子增强了孤立钒物种的分散性，提高了丙烷转化率。这个例子展示了表面改性在提高催化剂性能方面的角色。

这些策略体现了PDH催化剂设计持续努力优化活性、选择性和稳定性，有效且可持续地应对丙烯生产挑战。
