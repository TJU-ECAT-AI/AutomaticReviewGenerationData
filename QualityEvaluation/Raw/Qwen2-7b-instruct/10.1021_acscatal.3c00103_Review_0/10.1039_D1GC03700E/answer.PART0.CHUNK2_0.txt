[1] "While the current focus of government policy is based on net zero carbon, it is clear that society will still need a wide range of products based on carbon-containing molecules. It is now essential that the chemical industry focusses on accessing such carbon from sustainable sources."

[2] "Across the more active propane dehydrogenation catalysts known, there is a range in the abundance and production of the chemical elements required."

[3] "The ODH-O2 reaction has recently been dominated by the discovery of boron-based catalysts, which are highly abundant compared to most other ODH-O2 catalysts such as V."

[4] "While supported chromium oxides, which have been reported for DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2, Fe-ZSM-5, which is highly active for ODH-N2O, has a unique dimeric Fe2+ site that can activate N2O but not O2."

[5] "The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking."

1. The chemical industry needs to focus on accessing carbon from sustainable sources to meet the ongoing demand for products based on carbon-containing molecules, aligning with the shift towards net-zero carbon policies.

2. There is a diversity in the abundance and production of chemical elements used in active propane dehydrogenation catalysts, which impacts their sustainability and scalability.

3. Boron-based catalysts, being highly abundant, have become a prominent choice in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, surpassing the less abundant vanadium-based catalysts in terms of accessibility.

4. Fe-ZSM-5, an active catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrogen dioxide, has a unique dimeric Fe2+ site capable of activating nitrogen dioxide, which is distinct from its role in activating oxygen.

5. The most advanced catalysts in literature rely on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but these catalysts require regular regeneration due to the formation of coke, indicating a need for catalyst design improvements.

1. 化学工业需要专注于从可持续来源获取碳，以满足对基于碳分子的物质产品的持续需求，这与净零碳政策的重点相吻合。

2. 在已知的活性丙烷脱氢催化剂中，化学元素的可用性与生产存在多样性，这影响了它们的可持续性和可扩展性。

3. 由于硼基催化剂的高丰度，它们已成为氧化脱氢丙烷与氧气反应的主要选择，超越了较少丰度的钒基催化剂，在可获得性方面处于领先地位。

4. Fe-ZSM-5是一种在氮氧化物中激活氮氧化物进行丙烷氧化脱氢的活性催化剂，具有独特的二聚Fe2+位点，这与其在激活氧气中的作用不同。

5. 文献中报告的最先进催化剂依赖于铬氧化物或铂促进锡氧化物，但这些催化剂由于焦炭的形成需要定期再生，表明需要改进催化剂设计。
