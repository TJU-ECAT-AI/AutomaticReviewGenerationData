[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
[2] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
[3] "While the results in this work reveal a crucial role in the sub-surface composition of the catalyst, this aspect of catalyst design is often overlooked."
[4] "The commercial interest in further developing dehydrogenation technologies is evident from a simple examination of the patent literature."
[5] "The commercial dehydrogenation of propane is exclusively carried out in the absence of an oxidant."
[6] "The commercial processes are based on Pt or Cr, as shown in Table 2."
[7] "Overall, each dehydrogenation reaction has unique operating conditions and challenges, which are dictated by their thermodynamics."

1. Propane dehydrogenation techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering alternative, potentially more sustainable routes to propylene production. These methods aim to improve catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. Innovative catalyst design includes the use of promoters, modifying the support material, and adjusting the metal-support interactions to optimize performance.

2. The development of catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is gaining interest, particularly with the fall in propane prices due to the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. This has spurred efforts to develop renewable and green routes to propylene production, such as direct propane dehydrogenation.

3. The sub-surface composition of catalysts plays a crucial role in their performance and stability, yet this aspect is often overlooked in catalyst design. Understanding and optimizing the sub-surface properties could lead to significant improvements in catalyst efficiency.

4. The patent literature reflects the growing commercial interest in developing dehydrogenation technologies, highlighting advancements in catalyst design and process engineering aimed at improving efficiency, reducing costs, and minimizing environmental impact.

5. Currently, the commercial dehydrogenation of propane is exclusively carried out in the absence of an oxidant, utilizing catalysts based on precious metals like Pt or Cr. These catalysts are optimized for high propene yield and selectivity.

6. The most advanced commercial processes for propane dehydrogenation rely on Pt or Cr-based catalysts, as detailed in Table 2. These processes demonstrate high initial activity and selectivity, with typical conversion and selectivity values provided in the table.

7. Each dehydrogenation reaction, whether oxidative or non-oxidative, presents unique operating conditions and thermodynamic challenges. These include managing the formation of unwanted byproducts like coke, controlling reaction temperatures, and balancing acid-base properties on the catalyst surface to ensure optimal propene production.
