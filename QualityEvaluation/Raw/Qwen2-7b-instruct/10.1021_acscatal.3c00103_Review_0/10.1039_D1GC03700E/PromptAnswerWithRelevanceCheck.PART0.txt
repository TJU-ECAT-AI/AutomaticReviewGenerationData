1. Propane dehydrogenation techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering more environmentally friendly and economically viable alternatives. These methods aim to produce propylene directly from propane, reducing the energy consumption and environmental impact compared to conventional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. For instance, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for achieving optimal performance across different dehydrogenation methods.

2. The catalyst design for propane dehydrogenation processes, whether non-oxidative or oxidative, should prioritize improving the selectivity of propene production. The effectiveness of catalysts in these processes can be significantly influenced by the surface chemistry, specifically the balance between acidic and basic sites. Optimizing these sites can lead to more efficient and stable catalysts, capable of achieving high propene yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

3. Future research directions in the design of dehydrogenation catalysts should concentrate on enhancing the selectivity towards propene production. This is particularly important for both direct dehydrogenation (DDH) and oxidative dehydrogenation using oxygen (ODH-O2) processes. On the other hand, catalysts designed for oxidative dehydrogenation using carbon dioxide (ODH-CO2) face challenges due to their lower intrinsic activity with respect to carbon dioxide, which can limit propene yields.

4. Considering the scarcity of certain catalytic elements used in these processes, researchers are exploring alternatives that utilize more abundant chemical elements. This not only addresses the issue of scarcity but also potentially reduces costs and environmental impacts associated with rare metals. By focusing on the availability of common elements, the sustainability of dehydrogenation catalysts can be improved.

In addressing the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques utilize innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. 

For oxidative PDH, the review by Carrero et al. highlights that the activity of supported vanadia catalysts can be explained by the energy of oxygen defect formation, which defines the reducibility of the site and the redox potential. This insight guides the optimization of catalyst formulations.

To improve catalyst activity, acidic supports have been explored, as they increase the activity of ODH-O2 catalysts. For instance, supporting vanadia on SBA-15 via wet impregnation achieves a high surface density of 1.6 V nm2 without V2O5 crystallite formation, boosting dispersion and activity.

Nonetheless, the use of acidic supports can negatively impact selectivity and overall productivity, as they tend to activate propene. Balancing the support's acidity to maintain high selectivity is a critical challenge in PDH catalyst design.

In nonoxidative PDH, the cationanion double hydrolysis (CADH) approach has been employed to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, with the crystallization temperature varying between 25120 C. This method directly impacts the catalyst's performance.

The addition of sodium ions to the silica support enhances the dispersion of isolated vanadia species, boosting propane conversion. This example showcases the role of surface modification in improving catalyst performance.

These strategies exemplify the ongoing efforts in PDH catalyst design to optimize activity, selectivity, and stability, addressing the challenges in propylene production efficiently and sustainably.

针对丙烷需求量增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过创新催化剂设计策略来解决脱活问题、增强稳定性和提高可回收性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中均取得了显著进展。

卡雷罗等人的综述指出，支持型钒基催化剂的活性可以由氧缺陷形成能解释，这决定了位点的还原性和电化学性质。这一洞察指导了催化剂配方的优化。

为了提高催化剂活性，已探索使用酸性支持物，它们增加了ODH-O2催化剂的活性。例如，通过湿浸渍在SBA-15上支持的钒，实现了高达1.6 V nm2的表面密度，而没有形成V2O5结晶体，从而增强了分散性和活性。

然而，酸性支持物可能导致选择性降低和总体生产力下降，因为它们倾向于激活丙烯。平衡支持物的酸性以保持高选择性是PDH催化剂设计中的关键挑战。

在非氧化性PDH中，已经采用离子双水解（CADH）方法合成具有高比表面积和纯γ-Al2O3相的介孔Al2O3，结晶温度在25120 C之间变化。这种方法直接影响催化剂性能。

向硅酸盐支持物中添加钠离子增强了孤立钒物种的分散性，提高了丙烷转化率。这个例子展示了表面改性在提高催化剂性能方面的角色。

这些策略体现了PDH催化剂设计持续努力优化活性、选择性和稳定性，有效且可持续地应对丙烯生产挑战。

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a more sustainable and efficient method for propylene production. This is achieved through the conversion of propane to propylene, which can be done via non-oxidative, oxidative, or carbon dioxide-assisted routes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes. Key challenges addressed by these strategies include the formation of coke, which is thermodynamically favored under conditions for high propylene yield, and the minimization of side-reactions such as hydrogenolysis and cracking. 

For instance, the use of catalysts containing elements like platinum (Pt), chromium (Cr), gallium (Ga), and vanadium (V) has been explored to optimize the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high activity and selectivity, while Cr-based catalysts offer cost-effectiveness and stability. Gallium catalysts are noted for their benign nature and potential for high activity, albeit with lower stability compared to Pt catalysts. Vanadium-based catalysts are seen as alternatives due to their low cost and toxicity, with the optimization of vanadium loading and support interactions playing a critical role in their performance.

To overcome deactivation issues, catalyst design strategies aim to inhibit or switch-off undesirable side-reactions. This includes the use of promoters to modify the catalyst surface properties, such as adjusting the balance of acid and base sites, and employing advanced synthesis methods to ensure the isolation of active catalyst species. For example, the introduction of gallium into the framework of a zeolite support can lead to the formation of isolated gallium single-sites, which are active for CH activation and exhibit high selectivity in the PDH process. Similarly, the addition of potassium to Pt/Ga catalysts can enhance stability by promoting recombination of hydrogen atoms, thus preventing coke formation and maintaining high propylene yield.

Moreover, catalyst design is focused on achieving a balance between activity and stability, with strategies aimed at minimizing coke formation and improving the recyclability of catalysts. This is achieved by optimizing the catalyst composition, support material, and preparation methods. For instance, the use of ordered mesoporous materials, such as MCM-41, as supports for vanadium catalysts can lead to improved activity and stability due to their high surface area and well-defined pore architecture. 

In summary, the development of advanced catalyst design strategies for PDH processes addresses the challenges of deactivation, enhances stability, and improves recyclability, making PDH a viable and sustainable alternative to traditional propylene production methods. These strategies leverage the unique properties of various catalyst components to optimize the PDH process, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly propylene production.
