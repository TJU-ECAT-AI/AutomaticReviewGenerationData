[1] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
[2] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
[3] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
[4] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
[5] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."

1. Propane dehydrogenation techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering more environmentally friendly and economically viable alternatives. These methods aim to produce propylene directly from propane, reducing the energy consumption and environmental impact compared to conventional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. For instance, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for achieving optimal performance across different dehydrogenation methods.

2. The catalyst design for propane dehydrogenation processes, whether non-oxidative or oxidative, should prioritize improving the selectivity of propene production. The effectiveness of catalysts in these processes can be significantly influenced by the surface chemistry, specifically the balance between acidic and basic sites. Optimizing these sites can lead to more efficient and stable catalysts, capable of achieving high propene yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

3. Future research directions in the design of dehydrogenation catalysts should concentrate on enhancing the selectivity towards propene production. This is particularly important for both direct dehydrogenation (DDH) and oxidative dehydrogenation using oxygen (ODH-O2) processes. On the other hand, catalysts designed for oxidative dehydrogenation using carbon dioxide (ODH-CO2) face challenges due to their lower intrinsic activity with respect to carbon dioxide, which can limit propene yields.

4. Considering the scarcity of certain catalytic elements used in these processes, researchers are exploring alternatives that utilize more abundant chemical elements. This not only addresses the issue of scarcity but also potentially reduces costs and environmental impacts associated with rare metals. By focusing on the availability of common elements, the sustainability of dehydrogenation catalysts can be improved.

1. 烯丙烷脱氢技术通过提供更环保和经济可行的替代方案，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加以及传统生产方法的限制。这些方法旨在直接从丙烷中生产丙烯，与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化等过程相比，可以降低能源消耗和环境影响。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服脱活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性。例如，催化剂表面的酸性和碱性位点的平衡对于不同脱氢方法的性能至关重要。

2. 烯丙烷脱氢催化剂的设计，无论是非氧化还是氧化的，都应专注于提高丙烯的生产选择性。这些过程的有效性很大程度上受到表面化学的影响，特别是酸性和碱性位点的平衡。优化这些位点可以使催化剂更加有效且稳定，能够实现高丙烯产率的同时减少副反应。

3. 未来在脱氢催化剂设计方向的研究应该集中于提高丙烯生产的选择性。这对于直接脱氢（DDH）和使用氧气的氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）过程尤为重要。另一方面，设计用于使用二氧化碳的氧化脱氢（ODH-CO2）催化剂面临着挑战，由于其相对于二氧化碳的较低内在活性，这可能限制丙烯产率。

4. 考虑到某些用于这些过程的催化元素的稀缺性，研究人员正在探索使用更常见化学元素的替代方案。这不仅解决了稀缺性问题，而且可能降低了与稀有金属相关的价格和环境影响。通过关注常见元素的应用，可以改善脱氢催化剂的可持续性。
