[1] "Despite SiO2 having a large surface area, and that many different types of silica supports having been tested, the low reactivity of silanol groups towards V precursors means that a relatively low loading of isolated V sites are reported."
[2] "However, it should be noted that the intrinsic activity of the V/SiO2 catalysts did not increase; the calculated TOFs were similar for V supported on promoted and unpromoted SiO2. Instead, the presence of Na+ simply facilitated a greater density of isolated V sites."
[3] "In contrast, incipient-wetness techniques can still be improved, with hydration of the surface or doping being effective strategies."
[4] "This is an excellent example of doping having a beneficial effect."

Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes. These strategies focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Some key strategies include:

1. Utilizing acidic supports to increase the dispersion and stability of vanadia (V) species on the catalyst surface. This helps to maintain high selectivity and activity by controlling the formation of overoxidation products.

2. Incorporating dopants such as sodium (Na) to promote the formation of isolated vanadia sites. This increases the density of active vanadia species, thereby improving the overall catalytic performance.

3. Improving the impregnation techniques to optimize the dispersion of vanadia species. Techniques like hydration of the support surface or doping can lead to enhanced dispersion and selectivity.

4. Employing one-step synthesis methods to form catalysts that exhibit higher dispersion and stability of vanadia species. These methods often lead to superior catalytic performance compared to conventional surface impregnation techniques.

为了应对工业对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的局限性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略旨在克服活性丧失问题、提高稳定性并增强可回收性，同时适用于氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程。一些关键策略包括：

1. 利用酸性载体来增加载体表面上钒（V）物种的分散度和稳定性。这有助于通过控制过氧化产物的形成，维持高选择性和活性。

2. 引入钠（Na）等掺杂剂以促进孤立钒物种的形成。这增加了活性钒物种的密度，从而改善整体催化性能。

3. 改进浸渍技术以优化钒物种的分散度。表面润湿或掺杂等方法可以导致增强的分散度和选择性。

4. 使用一步合成方法形成表现出更高分散度和稳定性的催化剂。这些方法往往导致与传统表面浸渍技术相比更优的催化性能。
