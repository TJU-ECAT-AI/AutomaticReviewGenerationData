To address the challenges posed by the increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques leverage catalyst design strategies aimed at overcoming deactivation, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability. For oxidative PDH processes, innovative catalysts featuring weak and moderate surface acidity, along with promoting elements such as boron (B), gallium (Ga), copper (Cu), and nickel (Ni), reduce Pt utilization, making them economically and environmentally favorable alternatives. For nonoxidative PDH, catalysts with controlled redox and acid-base properties are developed to minimize competing reactions like reforming. These strategies are particularly crucial for optimizing the performance of catalysts in ODH-CO2 and ODH-N2O reactions, which have seen incremental improvements but require a step-change in catalyst performance for commercial viability.

In the case of ODH-O2, boron-based catalysts have shown promise due to their stability, non-hazardous nature, and abundance, offering a potentially sustainable route to propylene production. These catalysts, while showing good on-stream stability, need to achieve higher propene selectivity to surpass the performance of the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts.

ODH-CO2, though attracting academic interest for its potential in utilizing CO2, faces challenges due to low selectivity and stability. Catalysts featuring Cr- or Ga-based systems have seen incremental improvements but require a significant leap in performance for commercial application. 

ODH-N2O, the least studied reaction, has seen minimal progress in recent years. Its commercial viability hinges on addressing the economic costs associated with using N2O as an oxidant and enhancing catalyst performance.

In summary, the development of PDH catalysts focuses on improving selectivity, stability, and recyclability, with strategies tailored to the specific requirements of each PDH process. Advances in catalyst design, particularly in ODH-O2, ODH-CO2, and ODH-N2O, aim to overcome existing challenges and pave the way for more sustainable propylene production.

为了应对丙烯工业需求增长和传统生产方法的限制，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过催化剂设计策略来克服失活、提高稳定性和增强可循环利用性。在氧化PDH过程中，通过弱酸性和中等表面酸性的催化剂，以及促进元素如硼（B）、镓（Ga）、铜（Cu）和镍（Ni），可以降低铂（Pt）的利用率，使它们成为经济和环境友好的替代品。

对于非氧化PDH，开发具有控制还原性和酸碱性质的催化剂以最小化竞争反应，如重整，是至关重要的。这些策略对优化催化性能特别关键，特别是对于需要催化剂性能跃升的ODH-CO2和ODH-N2O反应。

对于ODH-O2，由于其稳定性、无危害性和丰富性，硼基催化剂显示出潜力，提供了一种可能的可持续丙烯生产途径。尽管这些催化剂显示出良好的在线稳定性，但需要更高的丙烯选择性才能超越最活跃的PDH和ODH-O2催化剂。

ODH-CO2虽然吸引了学术界的兴趣，因为它有可能利用二氧化碳并发展碳中和或碳负排放过程，但仍面临挑战，主要是低选择性和稳定性。基于Cr-或Ga系统的催化剂已经看到了一些改进，但需要显著的性能提升才能实现商业应用。

ODH-N2O是最少研究的反应，最近几年进展有限。其商业可行性依赖于解决使用N2O作为氧化剂的经济成本问题，并增强催化剂性能。

总的来说，PDH催化剂的发展重点是提高选择性、稳定性和可循环利用性，针对每个PDH过程的具体要求进行定制。在ODH-O2、ODH-CO2和ODH-N2O方面的催化剂设计进步旨在克服现有挑战，并为更可持续的丙烯生产铺平道路。
