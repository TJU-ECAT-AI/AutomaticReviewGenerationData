[1] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially."
[2] "The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking."
[3] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts."
[4] "ODH-CO2 has attracted interest, mostly in academia, due to the prospect of utilising CO2 and developing carbon neutral or carbon-negative processes."
[5] "ODH-N2O is the least studied reaction and progress has not been substantial in recent years."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering alternative, more sustainable routes for propylene production. These include oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes that can utilize renewable feedstocks and avoid the formation of coke, which is a major issue in conventional methods.

2. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability involve focusing on catalyst supports with weak and moderate surface acidity, incorporating promoting elements like boron, gallium, copper, and nickel. Intermetallic alloys and mixed metal oxides are also emerging as viable alternatives to chromium oxide or platinum-based catalysts.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen (ODH-O2) offers a pathway that avoids coke formation, which is a major advantage over traditional methods. However, until recently, the space-time yield (STY) of ODH-O2 catalysts lagged significantly behind those of oxidative dehydrogenation with hydrogen (DDH). Advances in boron-based catalysts have improved the prospects for commercial application.

4. Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide (ODH-CO2) is gaining interest due to the potential for utilizing carbon dioxide and creating carbon-neutral or carbon-negative processes. However, the performance of catalysts for this reaction has not seen substantial improvements in recent years. There is a need for a step-change in catalyst performance to make this process viable beyond academic interest.

5. Propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide (ODH-N2O) is the least studied reaction among the PDH processes. Progress in this area has not been substantial in recent years, mainly due to the high cost and low availability of nitrous oxide. However, the most active catalysts reported, such as Fe-ZSM-5, can achieve high STYs, making this process potentially attractive in certain integrated facilities.

1. 烯丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供更可持续的丙烯生产途径，以应对工业对丙烯需求的增长以及传统生产方法的局限性。这些包括氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程，可以利用可再生能源，并避免在常规方法中形成的焦炭问题。

2. 开发创新的催化剂设计策略以克服失活问题、提高稳定性和提高可回收性，涉及关注具有弱和中等表面酸性的催化剂支持，引入促进元素如硼、镓、铜和镍。间金属合金和混合金属氧化物也正在成为铬氧化物或铂基催化剂的可行替代品。

3. 使用氧气的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）提供了一条完全避免形成焦炭的途径，这是传统方法的一个重大优势。然而，在最近几年中，ODH-O2催化剂的时空产率（STY）远远落后于氢气氧化脱氢（DDH）。在硼基催化剂的进步下，商业应用的可能性得到了改善。

4. 丙烷脱氢与二氧化碳（ODH-CO2）正受到关注，主要是由于利用二氧化碳和开发碳中和或碳负向过程的潜力。然而，该反应的催化剂性能近年来并未取得实质性进展。需要催化剂性能的突破，使这一过程在学术兴趣之外变得可行。

5. 丙烷脱氢与二氧化氮（ODH-N2O）是PDH过程中研究最少的反应。近年来在此领域的进展并不显著，主要是由于二氧化氮的成本高且获取量低。然而，报告的最活跃催化剂，如Fe-ZSM-5，可以实现高的STY，使其在某些集成设施中可能有吸引力。
