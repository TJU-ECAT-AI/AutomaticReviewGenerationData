[1] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
[2] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."
[3] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
[4] "In the case of DDH, the formation of coke remains the biggest challenge, as it is thermodynamically favoured under conditions that enable high propane conversion."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a more sustainable and efficient method for propylene production. This is achieved through the conversion of propane to propylene, which can be done via non-oxidative, oxidative, or carbon dioxide-assisted routes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes. Key challenges addressed by these strategies include the formation of coke, which is thermodynamically favored under conditions for high propylene yield, and the minimization of side-reactions such as hydrogenolysis and cracking. 

For instance, the use of catalysts containing elements like platinum (Pt), chromium (Cr), gallium (Ga), and vanadium (V) has been explored to optimize the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high activity and selectivity, while Cr-based catalysts offer cost-effectiveness and stability. Gallium catalysts are noted for their benign nature and potential for high activity, albeit with lower stability compared to Pt catalysts. Vanadium-based catalysts are seen as alternatives due to their low cost and toxicity, with the optimization of vanadium loading and support interactions playing a critical role in their performance.

To overcome deactivation issues, catalyst design strategies aim to inhibit or switch-off undesirable side-reactions. This includes the use of promoters to modify the catalyst surface properties, such as adjusting the balance of acid and base sites, and employing advanced synthesis methods to ensure the isolation of active catalyst species. For example, the introduction of gallium into the framework of a zeolite support can lead to the formation of isolated gallium single-sites, which are active for CH activation and exhibit high selectivity in the PDH process. Similarly, the addition of potassium to Pt/Ga catalysts can enhance stability by promoting recombination of hydrogen atoms, thus preventing coke formation and maintaining high propylene yield.

Moreover, catalyst design is focused on achieving a balance between activity and stability, with strategies aimed at minimizing coke formation and improving the recyclability of catalysts. This is achieved by optimizing the catalyst composition, support material, and preparation methods. For instance, the use of ordered mesoporous materials, such as MCM-41, as supports for vanadium catalysts can lead to improved activity and stability due to their high surface area and well-defined pore architecture. 

In summary, the development of advanced catalyst design strategies for PDH processes addresses the challenges of deactivation, enhances stability, and improves recyclability, making PDH a viable and sustainable alternative to traditional propylene production methods. These strategies leverage the unique properties of various catalyst components to optimize the PDH process, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly propylene production.

在工业对丙烯需求增加以及传统生产方法限制的大背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过将丙烷转化为丙烯，提供了更加可持续和高效的方法来生产丙烯。这通过将丙烷转化为丙烯实现，可以是无氧化、氧化或二氧化碳辅助的方式。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服脱活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，从而改善PDH过程。

例如，铂（Pt）、铬（Cr）、镓（Ga）和钒（V）基催化剂被探索用于优化PDH过程。基于铂的催化剂因其高活性和选择性而受到青睐，而基于铬的催化剂则以其成本效益和稳定性而受到重视。镓催化剂以其温和的性质和潜在的高活性受到关注，尽管其稳定性与铂催化剂相比较低。钒基催化剂被视为替代品，因为它们的成本低且毒性小，优化钒负载和支持相互作用对于它们的性能至关重要。

为了克服脱活问题，催化剂设计策略旨在抑制或关闭不希望的副反应。这包括使用促进剂来修改催化剂表面性质，如调整酸和碱位点的平衡，并采用先进的合成方法确保活性催化剂物种的隔离。例如，在沸石支持中引入镓可以导致形成孤立的镓单个位点，这些位点对CH激活具有活性，并表现出高的选择性PDH过程。

此外，催化剂设计集中在实现活性和稳定性的平衡上，通过策略来最小化焦炭形成并提高催化剂的可回收性。这通过优化催化剂组成、支撑材料和制备方法来实现。例如，使用有序介孔材料，如MCM-41，作为钒催化剂的支持物，由于其高表面积和定义明确的孔结构，可以导致改进的活性和稳定性。

总之，PDH过程的高级催化剂设计策略解决了脱活问题、提高了稳定性和增强了可回收性，使PDH成为传统丙烯生产方法的可行且环保的替代方案。这些策略利用各种催化剂成分的独特性质来优化PDH过程，导致更有效和环境友好的丙烯生产。
