[1] "In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, how do propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges, and what innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes?"
[2] "Despite the fact that ODH-CO2 of light alkanes has been known for over twenty years, catalyst design has largely been limited to a handful of metal oxide catalysts, namely chromia and gallia."
[3] "The number of studies on supported nanoparticle catalysts for ODH-CO2 are relatively few and those available indicate that this field of research has great potential. The major challenge is in understanding and inhibiting side-reactions such as reforming, which are known to proceed over this class of catalyst, unlike in Cr- and Ga-based catalysts."
[4] "While the current focus of government policy is based on net zero carbon, it is clear that society will still need a wide range of products based on carbon-containing molecules. It is now essential that the chemical industry focusses on accessing such carbon from sustainable sources."
[5] "The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking. Therefore, the future of DDH catalyst design should focus on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking."
[6] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts."
[7] "ODH-CO2 has attracted interest, mostly in academia, due to the prospect of utilising CO2 and developing carbon neutral or carbon-negative processes."
[8] "ODH-N2O is the least studied reaction and progress has not been substantial in recent years."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by employing innovative catalyst design strategies aimed at overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Catalysts are being developed with optimized physical properties, improved selectivity, and reduced side-reactions to maximize propylene yield.

2. Research on ODH-CO2 catalysts has historically been limited to a few metal oxide catalysts like chromia and gallia, reflecting the complexity and challenges in utilizing carbon dioxide as an oxidant in PDH processes.

3. Studies on supported nanoparticle catalysts for ODH-CO2 indicate significant potential for advancing PDH technology, though major challenges include understanding and inhibiting side-reactions like reforming, which are not prevalent in Cr- and Ga-based catalysts.

4. The chemical industry is shifting focus towards accessing carbon from sustainable sources, recognizing the need for PDH processes that utilize renewable feedstocks to meet the demand for propylene while aligning with net-zero carbon policies.

5. Future developments in DDH catalyst design aim to reduce deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking, targeting more selective and stable catalysts that minimize the formation of coke during the reaction.

6. The ODH-O2 process has emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional DDH, offering a pathway to avoid coke formation completely. However, achieving comparable space-time yields (STY) to DDH catalysts remains a significant challenge, especially for catalysts like supported vanadia.

7. ODH-CO2 processes are gaining interest due to their potential for utilizing carbon dioxide and developing carbon-neutral or carbon-negative production methods. Research in this area is focused on optimizing catalysts for efficient CO2 activation and propylene formation.

8. The least-studied PDH reaction, ODH-N2O, has seen minimal progress in recent years. The high cost and low availability of N2O as an oxidant, along with technical challenges in its utilization, have limited advancements in this area of research.
