The challenges faced by traditional propylene production methods, such as high energy consumption, cost, and environmental impact, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. Innovative catalyst design strategies, including optimized preparation techniques, doping with other metals, and the use of novel materials, are developed to improve performance, stability, and recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. In oxidative PDH, vanadia-based catalysts are commonly used, while boron-based catalysts, especially those with edge-hydroxylated boron nitride materials, show remarkable promise. Nonoxidative PDH utilizes a variety of catalysts, including metal oxides and transition metal binary molybdates. Strategies such as one-step synthesis, improved surface loading, and tailored support properties are employed to enhance catalyst performance. Understanding the reaction mechanism and identifying active sites is essential for further improving PDH efficiency and reducing deactivation risks. Continuous refinement of catalyst formulations and optimization of operating conditions aim to maximize productivity and selectivity, meeting the growing demand for propylene in a sustainable way.
