[1] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
[2] "In the case of DDH, the formation of coke remains the biggest challenge, as it is thermodynamically favoured under conditions that enable high propane conversion."
[3] "Over the course of five dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the CrAl-800 catalyst demonstrated superior regenerative ability, and the initial STY was 60 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 4, entry 9), which is comparable to many of the Pt catalysts reported in the literature."
[4] "It was found that low Cr loadings contribute to the dispersion of monomeric Cr6+ species, with some Cr3+ species and coordinative vacancies also being observed."
[5] "The authors postulated the main active site for CH activation was Ga3+ embedded within the γ-Al2O3 framework."

1. Propane dehydrogenation techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by providing a more sustainable, atom-economic, and potentially renewable route to propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the formation of coke is a significant challenge in nonoxidative PDH processes due to its thermodynamic favorability under high propane conversion conditions. Oxidative PDH processes, on the other hand, face the challenge of overoxidation, which can limit propene yield.

2. In the context of dehydrogenation catalyst design, the dispersion of monomeric Cr6+ species, along with the presence of some Cr3+ species and coordinative vacancies, plays a crucial role in determining the activity and stability of chromium-based catalysts. These factors are essential in achieving high propane conversion while minimizing unwanted side reactions like coke formation.

3. A CrAl-800 catalyst demonstrated superior regenerative ability and comparable performance to many Pt catalysts, with an initial STY of 60 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1. This highlights the potential of chromium-based catalysts as a viable alternative in dehydrogenation processes.

4. The dispersion of monomeric Cr6+ species, along with the presence of some Cr3+ species and coordinative vacancies, contributes to the activity and stability of chromium-based catalysts. These factors are critical in achieving high propane conversion while minimizing side reactions.

5. Gallium is considered an active constituent for the dehydrogenation of propane, mainly through oxidic, tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species. The Ga3+ species are embedded within the γ-Al2O3 framework, functioning as the main active site for CH activation in gallium-based catalysts.
