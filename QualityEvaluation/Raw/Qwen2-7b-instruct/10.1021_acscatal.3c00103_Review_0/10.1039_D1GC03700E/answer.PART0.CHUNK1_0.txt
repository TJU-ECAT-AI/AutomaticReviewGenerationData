[1] "Despite SiO2 having a large surface area, and that many different types of silica supports having been tested, the low reactivity of silanol groups towards V precursors means that a relatively low loading of isolated V sites are reported."
[2] "It was shown that with increasing V content, the V environments went from isolated VO4 species to Mg3V2O8, and no crystalline V2O5 was detected, even with V loading levels of 25 wt% when using co-impregnation of V and Mg."
[3] "The authors attributed this to increased dispersion of Co metal species, a consequence of the mild reoxidation conditions resulting in markedly smaller (6 nm) Co metal nanoparticles, contrary to those observed in the fresh (34 nm) and reduced counterparts (25 nm)."
[4] "This is among the most active B catalysts reported to date."
[5] "The increased dispersion caused by doping the titanate with K led to an increase in propene yield by 20% when compared to undoped Mo-TNT catalysts, despite a lower conversion."

1. The low reactivity of silanol groups towards vanadium precursors limits the loading of isolated vanadium sites on silica supports.
2. At high vanadium content, the vanadium environment transitions from isolated VO4 species to Mg3V2O8 without forming crystalline V2O5.
3. The increase in dispersion of cobalt metal species, due to mild reoxidation, leads to smaller cobalt nanoparticles (6 nm) compared to fresh (34 nm) and reduced (25 nm) counterparts.
4. The catalyst based on boron is among the most active reported for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
5. Doping titanate nanotubes with potassium enhances dispersion, resulting in a 20% increase in propene yield with a slight reduction in conversion.

1. 硅醇基团与钒前体的低反应性限制了硅胶支撑上的孤立钒站点的负载量。
2. 在高钒含量下，钒环境从孤立的VO4物种转变为Mg3V2O8，并且在共浸渍钒和镁的情况下未检测到结晶的V2O5。
3. 轻微氧化导致的分散性增加使得钴金属物种的大小减小至6 nm（与新鲜的34 nm和还原的25 nm相比）。
4. 基于硼的催化剂是迄今为止报告的最活跃的氧化脱氢丙烷催化剂之一。
5. 钛酸盐纳米管中添加钾提高了分散性，导致丙烯产率提高20%，同时转化率略有下降。
