<p>It is estimated that such high demand for propene won't be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products.</p>
<p>Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products.</p>
<p>Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time.</p>
<p>Concerns connected to meeting demand for propene without simultaneously decreasing production of remaining valuable products also favour intensification of fundamental research.</p>
<p>One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehydrogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs.</p>
<p>The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed.</p>
<p>High dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.</p>
<p>Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure.</p>
<p>We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.</p>
<p>Dealumination with acid nitrate leads to significantly reduction of Si/Al module from 17 to 1000. This has great impact on catalytic performance in CO2-PDH process.</p>
<p>In series of CrxSiBeta catalysts a correlation between number of redox Cr species and catalytic performance was found.</p>

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by providing selective processes dedicated to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol. Innovative catalyst design strategies, focusing on silica supports with ordered mesoporous structures, aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and optimize redox chromium species for high catalytic performance in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. Dealumination of Beta zeolite leads to significant improvements in catalytic performance for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, and a correlation between the number of redox chromium species and catalytic performance is observed across a series of CrxSiBeta catalysts.
