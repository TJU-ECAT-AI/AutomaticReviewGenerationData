<p>It is clear from Table 3 that CrxSiBeta exhibits high catalytic performance, similar to other well know chromium oxide-based system supported on mesoporous silica supports (SBA-1, SBA-15, MCM-41, MSU-x) or active carbon. In CrxSiBeta series maximum initial yield 27.2 % was obtained on the sample with 7wt % of Cr.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is clear that dealumination significantly improve both activity and selectivity. In the case of Cr2.0AlBeta reference catalyst, the low selectivity to propylene is due to high concentration of strong acid sites over AlBeta support which prefer cracking of propane. Thus, over Cr2.0AlBeta in product predominates methane, ethane and ethene produced in cracking reaction.</p>
<p>To clarify deactivation process the catalysts was investigated upon catalytic test by UVvis DRS. During the CO2-PDH process over Cr2.0SiBeta and Cr2.0AlBeta the spectra were collected in two time period. The first period between 01min and second ones between 1240min on stream. The Fig. 9 summaries the spectra collected in these two periods.</p>
<p>Over different Cr-containing Beta materials the yield of propene rise with the number of redox Cr species which on various silicas depend on their pore structure and specific surface area of method of Cr incorporation/deposition as well as total Cr content. Typically, the yield rises with the increase of total Cr content up to the maximum value (monolayer coverage). After exceeding the monolayer coverage of support the redox Cr species are no longer stabilized (attached directly with support) and during the preparation there are decompose to less active and non-redox Cr2O3 particles.</p>
<p>Finally, the effect of CO2 on catalytic performance was investigated.</p>
<p>Comparing to others catalytic systems, for instance palladium supported on Ce-based supports the promoting the effect of CO2 on Cr-based systems is moderate.</p>

1. In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing a selective process for producing propylene from propane. Traditional methods such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking produce propylene as a co-product, but they also yield other valuable products. Selective PDH processes, including propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of oxygen (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2-PDH), offer higher conversion rates and propylene yields compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Additionally, CO2-PDH processes can utilize carbon dioxide, which is often a waste product, as a co-reactant, making the process environmentally friendly and economically advantageous.

2. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include dealumination of the support material. Dealumination reduces the concentration of aluminum, which can lead to the formation of strong acid sites that favor cracking reactions rather than dehydrogenation. By preparing chromium-containing beta zeolite catalysts through dealumination, researchers can create materials with improved catalytic properties for CO2-PDH. The dealuminated form of beta zeolite, in particular, shows enhanced performance in CO2-PDH processes due to its ability to reduce the concentration of strong acid sites and increase the number of redox chromium species, which are essential for achieving high catalytic performance.

3. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the reaction mixture positively influences the formation rate of propylene in PDH processes. This is because CO2 can facilitate the reaction by shifting the equilibrium towards the production of propylene. The promoting effect of CO2 on propylene formation is observed in the case of chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts, but not in the case of the reference catalyst based on alumina. The CO2-induced enhancement in propylene formation is attributed to the ability of CO2 to participate in the water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of the PDH reaction in favor of propylene production. This effect is more pronounced in catalysts with dealuminated supports, as these materials exhibit better stability and selectivity towards propylene formation in the presence of CO2.

4. The relationship between the number of redox chromium species and catalytic performance in PDH processes is closely tied to the support material. In the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on different siliceous supports, such as ordered or unordered mesoporous silica, there is a direct correlation between the number of redox chromium species and the catalytic performance. However, in the case of chromium-containing beta zeolite catalysts, this correlation does not persist beyond a certain chromium content. The reason for this difference lies in the specific interactions between chromium and the support material, which affect the stability and reactivity of the redox species. In beta zeolite, the dealumination process plays a critical role in enhancing the catalytic properties by reducing the concentration of strong acid sites and increasing the number of redox chromium species, thereby improving the overall performance of the catalyst.

1. 在对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的情况下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种选择性过程从丙烷生产丙烯来应对这些挑战。传统的裂解方法和催化裂解方法产生丙烯作为副产品，但同时也产生其他有价值的产物。选择性的PDH过程，包括在氧气存在下进行的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）或在二氧化碳存在的丙烷脱氢（CO2-PDH），与非氧化性脱氢相比提供了更高的转化率和丙烯产率。此外，CO2-PDH过程可以利用二氧化碳，这是一种常见的废物产品，作为共反应物，使过程环境友好且经济上有利。

2. 正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略，以克服失活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，包括对支持材料的钝化。通过减少铝的浓度，可以降低强酸位点的浓度，这些位点倾向于促进裂解而不是脱氢。通过制备含铬的贝塔沸石催化剂，研究人员可以创建具有改进性能的材料用于CO2-PDH。钝化的贝塔沸石形式在CO2-PDH过程中表现出增强的性能，因为这种材料能够减少强酸位点的浓度并增加还原态铬物种的数量，这对于实现高催化性能至关重要。

3. 二氧化碳（CO2）的存在在PDH过程中正向影响丙二烯的形成速率。这是因为CO2可以通过促进反应来实现这一点，将平衡倾向丙二烯的生产。在含铬硅基质催化剂中观察到CO2诱导的丙二烯形成增强作用，但在基于氧化铝的参考催化剂中未观察到。CO2引起的丙二烯形成增强归因于CO2参与水气转移（RWGS）反应的能力，这有利于PDH反应中的丙二烯生产。这种效应在含有钝化支持材料的催化剂中更为显著，因为这些材料在CO2存在下表现出更好的稳定性和丙二烯生成的选择性。

4. 红外铬物种和催化性能之间的关系与支持材料密切相关。对于不同的硅基质支持的铬氧化物催化剂，红外观测到的铬物种数量与催化性能之间存在直接相关。然而，在含铬的贝塔沸石催化剂中，这种相关性在超过一定铬含量后不再持续。这种差异的原因在于铬与支持材料之间特定的相互作用，这影响了红外观测到的物种的稳定性及其活性。在贝塔沸石中，钝化过程在提高催化性能方面起着关键作用，通过降低强酸位点的浓度并增加红外观测到的铬物种的数量，从而改善催化剂的整体性能。
