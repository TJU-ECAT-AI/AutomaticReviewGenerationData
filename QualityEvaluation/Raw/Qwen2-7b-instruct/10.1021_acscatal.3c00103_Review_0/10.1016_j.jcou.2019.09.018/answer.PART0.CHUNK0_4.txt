[1] "Concerns connected to meeting demand for propene without simultaneously decreasing production of remaining valuable products also favour intensification of fundamental research."
[2] "Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure."
[3] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."
[4] "In CrxSiBeta series linear proportion between formation rate and number of redox species is observed up to 2wt % of Cr. After exceeding this content catalytic performance did not correlate further with number of redox sites."

In addressing the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques aim to enhance efficiency and stability. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on improving both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, dealumination of Beta zeolite with acid nitrate leads to a significant reduction in the Si/Al ratio, which greatly impacts catalytic performance in CO2-assisted PDH processes. This approach allows for enhanced yield and selectivity to propene in the presence of CO2. The study highlights the importance of silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure, as an effective support for high chromium dispersion. Moreover, the catalyst design enables a switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2, where the formation rate of propene increases with CO2 presence over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts but exhibits a negative effect over Cr-containing AlBeta catalysts. The research also identifies that there is a linear relationship between the formation rate and the number of redox chromium species in CrxSiBeta catalysts up to 2wt% of Cr, beyond which the catalytic performance does not correlate further with the number of redox sites. Additionally, the study compares the effect of CO2 on propene formation in Cr-based systems to other catalytic systems, noting that the promoting effect of CO2 on Cr-based systems is generally less pronounced compared to systems with palladium supported on ceria-based supports.

为了应对丙烯工业需求增加和传统生产方法的限制，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术旨在提高效率和稳定性。创新的催化剂设计策略专注于改进氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程。例如，通过酸硝酸处理将Beta沸石进行去铝化，导致Si/Al比率显著降低，这极大地影响了CO2辅助PDH过程的催化性能。这种方法允许在丙烷脱氢过程中在有无CO2的情况下实现丙烯生成速率的提高，特别是在Cr含有的SiBeta沸石催化剂的存在下。研究强调了有序介孔结构的二氧化硅作为高效铬分散的有效支持的重要性。此外，催化剂设计使操作模式能够切换为在丙烷脱氢存在或不存在CO2之间，丙烯生成速率在CO2存在的模式下对Cr含有的SiBeta沸石催化剂增加，但在Cr含有的AlBeta催化剂上则显示出负效应。研究还发现，在CrxSiBeta催化剂中，形成速率与红氧化铬物种的数量之间存在线性关系，直到2wt%的Cr，超过此含量，催化性能不再与红氧化位点的数量成正比。此外，与基于铈的支撑系统相比，研究比较了CO2对Cr基系统中丙烯形成的影响，指出CO2促进效果在Cr基系统中的表现通常较弱。
