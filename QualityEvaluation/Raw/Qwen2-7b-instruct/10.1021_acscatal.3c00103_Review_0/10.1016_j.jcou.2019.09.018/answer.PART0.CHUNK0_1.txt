1. Increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods lead to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques that address these challenges by providing a dedicated process for propylene synthesis. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

2. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex, involving various scenarios such as non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or Cr(III) species or redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant. High dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are critical for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.

3. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support to ensure high dispersion, with silica, especially of ordered mesoporous structure, considered a promising support for its ability to provide a large specific surface area and facilitate high chromium species dispersion.

4. The dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion through simple impregnation procedures result in excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH, demonstrating the importance of dealumination in improving catalytic properties.

5. Dealumination of Beta leads to a significant reduction in the number of acid sites, impacting the catalytic performance in CO2-PDH processes.

6. Propane conversion and selectivity to propene exhibit a variable relationship with time-on-stream (TOS), with deactivation occurring initially at a faster rate that slows down over time.

7. The addition of CO2 enhances the formation rate of propene over chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts, compared to PDH processes using inert gas dilution only. This effect is observed across various catalytic systems, with the magnitude varying based on differences in the contribution of oxidative and non-oxidative pathways.

8. When comparing the effect of CO2 on different catalytic systems, such as palladium supported on Ce-based supports, the promoting effect of CO2 on Cr-based systems is generally moderate, reflecting differences in the pathways involved in propene formation.

1. 随着工业对丙烯需求的增长以及传统生产方法的限制，新的选择性过程用于仅从丙烷合成丙烯正在变得越来越重要。通过提供专门用于丙烯合成的工艺，PDH技术解决了这些挑战。创新的催化剂设计策略旨在克服脱活问题、提高稳定性并改善可回收性，适用于氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程。

2. 在CO2存在的丙烷脱氢机制中，丙烷可能通过参与Cr(II)或Cr(III)物种的非氧化脱氢或涉及二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂参与的还原氧化机制进行脱氢。高分散性和存在还原氧化铬物种是实现CO2-PDH过程中高催化性能的关键因素。

3. 铬通常在支撑上分散以确保高分散度，特别是有序介孔结构的硅酸盐被认为是一种很有前景的支持材料，因为它能提供大量的比表面积并促进高铬物种的分散。

4. 通过简单浸渍程序对去铝化Beta沸石进行铬分散的结果表明，去铝化Beta与CO2-PDH表现出优秀的催化剂性能，表明去铝化在改善催化性能中的重要性。

5. 去铝化Beta导致酸性位点数量显著减少，影响CO2-PDH过程的催化性能。

6. 环烷烃转化率和丙烯选择性随时间-在线（TOS）的变化而变化，脱活初期速率较快，随后逐渐减慢。

7. 添加CO2增加了使用铬基SiBeta沸石催化剂的丙烷脱氢过程中的丙烯生成速率，与仅使用惰性气体稀释的PDH过程相比。这种效应在不同催化系统中普遍存在，但不同系统的丙烯形成路径贡献差异导致效果幅度不同。

8. 将CO2与基于Ce的支持的钯基催化剂进行比较时，Cr基系统中CO2的促进作用通常较弱，反映了不同途径在丙烯形成过程中所起的作用。
