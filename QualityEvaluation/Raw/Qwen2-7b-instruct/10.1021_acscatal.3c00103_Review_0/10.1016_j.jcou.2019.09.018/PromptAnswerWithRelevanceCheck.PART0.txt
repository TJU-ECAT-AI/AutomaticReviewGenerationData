<p>It is estimated that such high demand for propene won't be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products.</p>
<p>Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products.</p>
<p>Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time.</p>
<p>Concerns connected to meeting demand for propene without simultaneously decreasing production of remaining valuable products also favour intensification of fundamental research.</p>
<p>One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehydrogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs.</p>
<p>The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed.</p>
<p>High dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.</p>
<p>Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure.</p>
<p>We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.</p>
<p>Dealumination with acid nitrate leads to significantly reduction of Si/Al module from 17 to 1000. This has great impact on catalytic performance in CO2-PDH process.</p>
<p>In series of CrxSiBeta catalysts a correlation between number of redox Cr species and catalytic performance was found.</p>

<p>It is clear from Table 3 that CrxSiBeta exhibits high catalytic performance, similar to other well know chromium oxide-based system supported on mesoporous silica supports (SBA-1, SBA-15, MCM-41, MSU-x) or active carbon. In CrxSiBeta series maximum initial yield 27.2 % was obtained on the sample with 7wt % of Cr.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is clear that dealumination significantly improve both activity and selectivity. In the case of Cr2.0AlBeta reference catalyst, the low selectivity to propylene is due to high concentration of strong acid sites over AlBeta support which prefer cracking of propane. Thus, over Cr2.0AlBeta in product predominates methane, ethane and ethene produced in cracking reaction.</p>
<p>To clarify deactivation process the catalysts was investigated upon catalytic test by UVvis DRS. During the CO2-PDH process over Cr2.0SiBeta and Cr2.0AlBeta the spectra were collected in two time period. The first period between 01min and second ones between 1240min on stream. The Fig. 9 summaries the spectra collected in these two periods.</p>
<p>Over different Cr-containing Beta materials the yield of propene rise with the number of redox Cr species which on various silicas depend on their pore structure and specific surface area of method of Cr incorporation/deposition as well as total Cr content. Typically, the yield rises with the increase of total Cr content up to the maximum value (monolayer coverage). After exceeding the monolayer coverage of support the redox Cr species are no longer stabilized (attached directly with support) and during the preparation there are decompose to less active and non-redox Cr2O3 particles.</p>
<p>Finally, the effect of CO2 on catalytic performance was investigated.</p>
<p>Comparing to others catalytic systems, for instance palladium supported on Ce-based supports the promoting the effect of CO2 on Cr-based systems is moderate.</p>

1. In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing a selective process for producing propylene from propane. Traditional methods such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking produce propylene as a co-product, but they also yield other valuable products. Selective PDH processes, including propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of oxygen (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2-PDH), offer higher conversion rates and propylene yields compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Additionally, CO2-PDH processes can utilize carbon dioxide, which is often a waste product, as a co-reactant, making the process environmentally friendly and economically advantageous.

2. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include dealumination of the support material. Dealumination reduces the concentration of aluminum, which can lead to the formation of strong acid sites that favor cracking reactions rather than dehydrogenation. By preparing chromium-containing beta zeolite catalysts through dealumination, researchers can create materials with improved catalytic properties for CO2-PDH. The dealuminated form of beta zeolite, in particular, shows enhanced performance in CO2-PDH processes due to its ability to reduce the concentration of strong acid sites and increase the number of redox chromium species, which are essential for achieving high catalytic performance.

3. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the reaction mixture positively influences the formation rate of propylene in PDH processes. This is because CO2 can facilitate the reaction by shifting the equilibrium towards the production of propylene. The promoting effect of CO2 on propylene formation is observed in the case of chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts, but not in the case of the reference catalyst based on alumina. The CO2-induced enhancement in propylene formation is attributed to the ability of CO2 to participate in the water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of the PDH reaction in favor of propylene production. This effect is more pronounced in catalysts with dealuminated supports, as these materials exhibit better stability and selectivity towards propylene formation in the presence of CO2.

4. The relationship between the number of redox chromium species and catalytic performance in PDH processes is closely tied to the support material. In the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on different siliceous supports, such as ordered or unordered mesoporous silica, there is a direct correlation between the number of redox chromium species and the catalytic performance. However, in the case of chromium-containing beta zeolite catalysts, this correlation does not persist beyond a certain chromium content. The reason for this difference lies in the specific interactions between chromium and the support material, which affect the stability and reactivity of the redox species. In beta zeolite, the dealumination process plays a critical role in enhancing the catalytic properties by reducing the concentration of strong acid sites and increasing the number of redox chromium species, thereby improving the overall performance of the catalyst.

1. 在对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的情况下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种选择性过程从丙烷生产丙烯来应对这些挑战。传统的裂解方法和催化裂解方法产生丙烯作为副产品，但同时也产生其他有价值的产物。选择性的PDH过程，包括在氧气存在下进行的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）或在二氧化碳存在的丙烷脱氢（CO2-PDH），与非氧化性脱氢相比提供了更高的转化率和丙烯产率。此外，CO2-PDH过程可以利用二氧化碳，这是一种常见的废物产品，作为共反应物，使过程环境友好且经济上有利。

2. 正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略，以克服失活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，包括对支持材料的钝化。通过减少铝的浓度，可以降低强酸位点的浓度，这些位点倾向于促进裂解而不是脱氢。通过制备含铬的贝塔沸石催化剂，研究人员可以创建具有改进性能的材料用于CO2-PDH。钝化的贝塔沸石形式在CO2-PDH过程中表现出增强的性能，因为这种材料能够减少强酸位点的浓度并增加还原态铬物种的数量，这对于实现高催化性能至关重要。

3. 二氧化碳（CO2）的存在在PDH过程中正向影响丙二烯的形成速率。这是因为CO2可以通过促进反应来实现这一点，将平衡倾向丙二烯的生产。在含铬硅基质催化剂中观察到CO2诱导的丙二烯形成增强作用，但在基于氧化铝的参考催化剂中未观察到。CO2引起的丙二烯形成增强归因于CO2参与水气转移（RWGS）反应的能力，这有利于PDH反应中的丙二烯生产。这种效应在含有钝化支持材料的催化剂中更为显著，因为这些材料在CO2存在下表现出更好的稳定性和丙二烯生成的选择性。

4. 红外铬物种和催化性能之间的关系与支持材料密切相关。对于不同的硅基质支持的铬氧化物催化剂，红外观测到的铬物种数量与催化性能之间存在直接相关。然而，在含铬的贝塔沸石催化剂中，这种相关性在超过一定铬含量后不再持续。这种差异的原因在于铬与支持材料之间特定的相互作用，这影响了红外观测到的物种的稳定性及其活性。在贝塔沸石中，钝化过程在提高催化性能方面起着关键作用，通过降低强酸位点的浓度并增加红外观测到的铬物种的数量，从而改善催化剂的整体性能。

In addressing the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques aim to optimize the production of propylene efficiently. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on improving the stability, enhancing selectivity, and facilitating recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. 

Dealumination of Beta zeolite supports leads to significant changes in their acid-base properties, affecting catalytic performance in CO2-PDH processes. Lower acidity on SiBeta supports is beneficial for achieving high propene selectivity (over 80%), whereas higher acidity on AlBeta supports tends to promote propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons.

In a switching operation mode between propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2, the rate of propene formation increases notably over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts when CO2 is present, contrasting with a negative effect on propene formation rates observed over Cr-containing AlBeta catalysts. 

The relationship between the yield of propene and the number of redox chromium species varies depending on the silica support's pore structure, surface area, and method of chromium incorporation. Typically, the yield increases up to a maximum when chromium is monolayer-covered on the support. Beyond this point, the stabilization of redox chromium species diminishes, leading to decomposition into less active chromium oxide particles.

For CrxSiBeta catalysts, a linear relationship exists between the formation rate of propene and the number of redox chromium species until a 2wt% threshold is reached. Above this content, the catalytic performance does not correlate further with the number of redox sites.

In the presence of CO2, the formation rate of propene increases alongside the formation of carbon monoxide and a decrease in hydrogen formation rate. The addition of CO2 does not halt hydrogen formation.

In contrast to Pd/Ce-based catalysts, where CO2 dissociation facilitates both oxidative propene dehydrogenation (PODH) and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, over Cr/Silica-based catalysts, such dissociation is less pronounced, leading to propene production primarily through the PDH reaction.

在应对工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的挑战时，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术旨在高效地优化丙烯的生产。创新的催化剂设计策略集中在提高稳定性、增强选择性以及促进可回收性上，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中。

通过酸化处理将贝塔沸石载体去铝，导致其酸碱性质发生显著变化，影响CO2-PDH过程中的催化性能。在SiBeta载体上的较低酸度有利于实现丙烯选择性超过80%，而AlBeta初始载体的高酸度倾向于促进丙烷裂解为较轻的烃类。

在以CO2存在与不存在之间切换的操作模式下，当CO2存在时，丙烯形成速率在Cr含有的SiBeta沸石催化剂上明显增加，与Cr含有的AlBeta催化剂上丙烯形成速率降低形成对比。

丙烯的产量与红铬物种的数量之间的关系依赖于不同硅酸盐支持物的孔结构、表面面积以及铬的掺入/沉积方法。通常，当铬在支持物上形成单层覆盖时，产量会增加。超过这一点后，红铬物种的稳定不再持续，导致分解成活性较低的氧化铬粒子。

对于CrxSiBeta催化剂，红铬物种数量与丙烯形成速率之间存在线性关系，直到达到2wt%的阈值。超过此含量，催化性能不再与红铬位点数相关联。

在CO2存在的情况下，丙烯形成速率随着碳一氧化合物的形成和氢形成速率的下降而增加。添加CO2不会停止氢的形成。

相比之下，与Pd/Ce基催化剂相比，CO2的分解在铈基支持物上促进了氧化性丙烯脱氢（PODH）和逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应，而在Cr/Silica基催化剂上，这种分解作用不那么明显，导致主要通过PDH反应产生丙烯。

In addressing the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques aim to enhance efficiency and stability. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on improving both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, dealumination of Beta zeolite with acid nitrate leads to a significant reduction in the Si/Al ratio, which greatly impacts catalytic performance in CO2-assisted PDH processes. This approach allows for enhanced yield and selectivity to propene in the presence of CO2. The study highlights the importance of silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure, as an effective support for high chromium dispersion. Moreover, the catalyst design enables a switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2, where the formation rate of propene increases with CO2 presence over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts but exhibits a negative effect over Cr-containing AlBeta catalysts. The research also identifies that there is a linear relationship between the formation rate and the number of redox chromium species in CrxSiBeta catalysts up to 2wt% of Cr, beyond which the catalytic performance does not correlate further with the number of redox sites. Additionally, the study compares the effect of CO2 on propene formation in Cr-based systems to other catalytic systems, noting that the promoting effect of CO2 on Cr-based systems is generally less pronounced compared to systems with palladium supported on ceria-based supports.

为了应对丙烯工业需求增加和传统生产方法的限制，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术旨在提高效率和稳定性。创新的催化剂设计策略专注于改进氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程。例如，通过酸硝酸处理将Beta沸石进行去铝化，导致Si/Al比率显著降低，这极大地影响了CO2辅助PDH过程的催化性能。这种方法允许在丙烷脱氢过程中在有无CO2的情况下实现丙烯生成速率的提高，特别是在Cr含有的SiBeta沸石催化剂的存在下。研究强调了有序介孔结构的二氧化硅作为高效铬分散的有效支持的重要性。此外，催化剂设计使操作模式能够切换为在丙烷脱氢存在或不存在CO2之间，丙烯生成速率在CO2存在的模式下对Cr含有的SiBeta沸石催化剂增加，但在Cr含有的AlBeta催化剂上则显示出负效应。研究还发现，在CrxSiBeta催化剂中，形成速率与红氧化铬物种的数量之间存在线性关系，直到2wt%的Cr，超过此含量，催化性能不再与红氧化位点的数量成正比。此外，与基于铈的支撑系统相比，研究比较了CO2对Cr基系统中丙烯形成的影响，指出CO2促进效果在Cr基系统中的表现通常较弱。
