<p>Comparing catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties.</p>
<p>Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.</p>
<p>Over different Cr-containing Beta materials the yield of propene rise with the number of redox Cr species which on various silicas depend on their pore structure and specific surface area of method of Cr incorporation/deposition as well as total Cr content.</p>
<p>Typically, the yield rises with the increase of total Cr content up to the maximum value (monolayer coverage). After exceeding the monolayer coverage of support the redox Cr species are no longer stabilized (attached directly with support) and during the preparation there are decompose to less active and non-redox Cr2O3 particles.</p>
<p>In CrxSiBeta series linear proportion between formation rate and number of redox species is observed up to 2wt % of Cr. After exceeding this content catalytic performance did not correlate further with number of redox sites.</p>
<p>Over Cr2.0SiBeta, in CO2 presence, rises formation rate of propene and carbon monoxide while at the same time decreases formation rate of hydrogen. It should be pointed hear that addition CO2 never stops formation of hydrogen.</p>
<p>In the case of Pd/Ce-based catalysts a dissociation of CO2 to active O species and CO over ceria-based support facilitated both PODH and RWGS reactions, while over Cr/Silica based (or Si reach supports) catalysts such dissociation is not pronounced thus propene is produced mainly in PDH reaction.</p>

In addressing the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques aim to optimize the production of propylene efficiently. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on improving the stability, enhancing selectivity, and facilitating recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. 

Dealumination of Beta zeolite supports leads to significant changes in their acid-base properties, affecting catalytic performance in CO2-PDH processes. Lower acidity on SiBeta supports is beneficial for achieving high propene selectivity (over 80%), whereas higher acidity on AlBeta supports tends to promote propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons.

In a switching operation mode between propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2, the rate of propene formation increases notably over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts when CO2 is present, contrasting with a negative effect on propene formation rates observed over Cr-containing AlBeta catalysts. 

The relationship between the yield of propene and the number of redox chromium species varies depending on the silica support's pore structure, surface area, and method of chromium incorporation. Typically, the yield increases up to a maximum when chromium is monolayer-covered on the support. Beyond this point, the stabilization of redox chromium species diminishes, leading to decomposition into less active chromium oxide particles.

For CrxSiBeta catalysts, a linear relationship exists between the formation rate of propene and the number of redox chromium species until a 2wt% threshold is reached. Above this content, the catalytic performance does not correlate further with the number of redox sites.

In the presence of CO2, the formation rate of propene increases alongside the formation of carbon monoxide and a decrease in hydrogen formation rate. The addition of CO2 does not halt hydrogen formation.

In contrast to Pd/Ce-based catalysts, where CO2 dissociation facilitates both oxidative propene dehydrogenation (PODH) and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, over Cr/Silica-based catalysts, such dissociation is less pronounced, leading to propene production primarily through the PDH reaction.

在应对工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的挑战时，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术旨在高效地优化丙烯的生产。创新的催化剂设计策略集中在提高稳定性、增强选择性以及促进可回收性上，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中。

通过酸化处理将贝塔沸石载体去铝，导致其酸碱性质发生显著变化，影响CO2-PDH过程中的催化性能。在SiBeta载体上的较低酸度有利于实现丙烯选择性超过80%，而AlBeta初始载体的高酸度倾向于促进丙烷裂解为较轻的烃类。

在以CO2存在与不存在之间切换的操作模式下，当CO2存在时，丙烯形成速率在Cr含有的SiBeta沸石催化剂上明显增加，与Cr含有的AlBeta催化剂上丙烯形成速率降低形成对比。

丙烯的产量与红铬物种的数量之间的关系依赖于不同硅酸盐支持物的孔结构、表面面积以及铬的掺入/沉积方法。通常，当铬在支持物上形成单层覆盖时，产量会增加。超过这一点后，红铬物种的稳定不再持续，导致分解成活性较低的氧化铬粒子。

对于CrxSiBeta催化剂，红铬物种数量与丙烯形成速率之间存在线性关系，直到达到2wt%的阈值。超过此含量，催化性能不再与红铬位点数相关联。

在CO2存在的情况下，丙烯形成速率随着碳一氧化合物的形成和氢形成速率的下降而增加。添加CO2不会停止氢的形成。

相比之下，与Pd/Ce基催化剂相比，CO2的分解在铈基支持物上促进了氧化性丙烯脱氢（PODH）和逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应，而在Cr/Silica基催化剂上，这种分解作用不那么明显，导致主要通过PDH反应产生丙烯。
