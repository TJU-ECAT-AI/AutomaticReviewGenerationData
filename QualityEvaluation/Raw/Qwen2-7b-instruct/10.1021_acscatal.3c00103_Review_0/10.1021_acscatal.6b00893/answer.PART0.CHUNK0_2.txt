Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by efficiently converting propane into propylene. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies focus on improving the dispersion of active species and developing more robust materials and structures for the catalysts. Both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes benefit from these optimized catalyst properties to improve their efficiency.
