In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route to produce propylene, especially utilizing abundant propane resources from shale gas exploitation. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These strategies involve the use of hydrogen and carbon dioxide as cofeeding gases to reduce the desorption barrier of propylene and preserve metallic active sites. Furthermore, metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts are being explored, with careful consideration given to their interactions with supports and the introduction of promoters. This systematic approach aims to understand the multifaceted roles of these strategies in catalytic performance.
