[1] "Thereinto, polypropene with high chemical durability and elasticity can be applied in various sectors like construction and packaging."
[2] "The propane dehydrogenation technique has been considered a novel and promising route to produce propylene in the context of the appearance of abundant propane resources from the exploitation of shale gas."
[3] "However, the intrinsic toxicity of CrOx species along with the severe side reactions greatly impedes the application in industrial production."
[4] "With regard to Pt-based catalysts, although metallic Pt is broadly identified as a promising PDH catalyst due to its environmental amiability and excellent affinity to CH bonds on alkanes, the rapid deactivation of catalytic activity induced by sintering and coke and the high production cost are still big challenges."
[5] "Coke formation, coupled with the sintering behavior, is usually inevitable, resulting in an inexorable catalytic deactivation."
[6] "Driven by passionate scientific interests and practical demands, a series of reviews have been published to summarize previous studies, yet these mainly focus on comprehensive summaries of the PDH reaction or the introduction of various catalytic systems."
[7] "Consequently, a review of the strategies for enhancing catalytic stability is necessary and informative."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a novel and promising route to produce propylene, especially leveraging abundant propane resources from shale gas exploitation. Challenges such as the intrinsic toxicity of CrOx species and the rapid deactivation of Pt-based catalysts due to sintering and coke formation hinder industrial application. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. These strategies include promoter introduction, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification, which are crucial for developing more effective PDH catalysts.
