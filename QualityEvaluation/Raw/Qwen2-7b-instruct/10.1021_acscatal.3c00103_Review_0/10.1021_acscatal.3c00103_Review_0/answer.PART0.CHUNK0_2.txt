In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a novel and promising route to produce propylene, particularly leveraging abundant propane resources from shale gas exploitation. These techniques aim to overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability through innovative catalyst design strategies. For instance, hydrogen as a cofeeding gas can reduce the desorption barrier of propylene and preserve metallic active sites, improving the stability of Pt-based catalysts. Additionally, carbon dioxide as a mild oxidative cofeeding gas helps inhibit the aggregation of coke precursors on the catalyst surface, resisting the reduction of active metal oxides under reductive atmospheres during the PDH process. The design strategies of PDH catalysts focus on improving stability and recyclability through active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

在丙烯工业需求增加和传统生产方法限制的背景下，PDH技术通过提供一种新型且有前景的路线来生产丙烯，特别是利用从页岩气开采中获得的丰富丙烯资源。这些技术旨在通过创新催化剂设计策略来克服失活问题并提高稳定性。例如，氢作为共给气体可以降低丙烯的脱附壁垒，并保持铂基催化剂中的金属活性位点，从而改善其稳定性。此外，二氧化碳作为一种温和氧化的共给气体，有助于抑制催化剂表面的焦炭前体聚集，抵抗还原气氛下丙烷脱氢过程期间活性金属氧化物的还原。PDH催化剂的设计策略侧重于通过活性位点调节、金属支持相互作用增强和支持修改来提高稳定性和可回收性。
