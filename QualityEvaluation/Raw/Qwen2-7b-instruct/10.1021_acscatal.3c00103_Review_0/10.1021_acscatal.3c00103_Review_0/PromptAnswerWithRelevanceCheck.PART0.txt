In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing a viable alternative route to produce propylene from abundant propane resources. This method has gained prominence due to its potential to bypass the constraints imposed by the escalating oil prices and the complexity of traditional production processes. However, the use of conventional catalysts like chromium oxide (CrOx) and platinum (Pt)-based catalysts faces significant challenges, such as toxicity, side reactions, and rapid deactivation due to sintering and coke formation. To overcome these issues, researchers have developed innovative catalyst design strategies that focus on improving the stability and recyclability of PDH catalysts. These strategies include promoting the introduction of specific additives, enhancing the interaction between metals and supports, and modifying the support material itself. By doing so, they aim to prevent or mitigate the formation of coke and sintering, thereby preserving the active sites and ensuring consistent catalytic activity over multiple cycles.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a more accessible and potentially less expensive route to produce propylene, especially when dealing with abundant propane resources from shale gas exploitation. Traditional production methods, relying on oil-based cracking processes, face difficulties in meeting the demand due to the escalating oil prices and the high costs associated with their operation. The PDH technique, being nonoxidative, simplifies the reaction components and has already been successfully commercialized for industrial production, providing an alternative solution to the challenge of propylene production.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, researchers have developed innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies involve the introduction of promoters, enhancing the interaction between metals and supports, and modifying the support materials themselves. By doing so, they aim to regulate active sites, improve the stability of the catalysts, and increase their recyclability, which is crucial for maintaining efficiency in the PDH process. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges and prospects for the current status of catalyst synthesis, highlighting the ongoing efforts to optimize PDH catalysts for practical applications.
