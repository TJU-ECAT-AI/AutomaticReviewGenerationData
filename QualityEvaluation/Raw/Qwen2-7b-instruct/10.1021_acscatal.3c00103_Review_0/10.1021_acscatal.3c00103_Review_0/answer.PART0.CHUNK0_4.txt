In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a more accessible and potentially less expensive route to produce propylene, especially when dealing with abundant propane resources from shale gas exploitation. Traditional production methods, relying on oil-based cracking processes, face difficulties in meeting the demand due to the escalating oil prices and the high costs associated with their operation. The PDH technique, being nonoxidative, simplifies the reaction components and has already been successfully commercialized for industrial production, providing an alternative solution to the challenge of propylene production.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, researchers have developed innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies involve the introduction of promoters, enhancing the interaction between metals and supports, and modifying the support materials themselves. By doing so, they aim to regulate active sites, improve the stability of the catalysts, and increase their recyclability, which is crucial for maintaining efficiency in the PDH process. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges and prospects for the current status of catalyst synthesis, highlighting the ongoing efforts to optimize PDH catalysts for practical applications.

在丙烯工业需求增加以及传统生产方法限制的大背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种更便捷且可能成本更低的生产丙烯途径来应对这些挑战，尤其是在利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷资源时。传统的生产方法依赖于基于石油的裂解过程，面临着因油价上涨和操作成本高昂而难以满足需求的问题。非氧化性PDH技术简化了反应成分，并已成功实现工业化生产，为丙烯生产提供了替代解决方案。

为了克服脱活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中，研究人员开发了一系列创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略包括促进剂的引入、金属与支持材料之间作用力的增强以及支持材料本身的修改。通过这些措施，他们旨在调节活性位点、改善催化剂稳定性并提高其可回收性，这对于维持PDH过程的效率至关重要。此外，该综述讨论了当前催化剂合成状态的挑战和前景，突出了优化PDH催化剂以适用于实际应用的持续努力。
