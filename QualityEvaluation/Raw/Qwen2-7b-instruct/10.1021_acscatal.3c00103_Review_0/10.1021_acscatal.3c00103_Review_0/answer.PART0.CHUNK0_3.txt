[1] "Thereinto, polypropene with high chemical durability and elasticity can be applied in various sectors like construction and packaging."
[2] "The explosive growth of propylene consumption, coupled with the soaring oil price, makes it difficult for traditional techniques (fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil and steam cracking of naphtha) to satisfy the demand."
[3] "The propane dehydrogenation technique has been considered a novel and promising route to produce propylene in the context of the appearance of abundant propane resources from the exploitation of shale gas."
[4] "However, the intrinsic toxicity of CrOx species along with the severe side reactions greatly impedes the application in industrial production."
[5] "With regard to Pt-based catalysts, although metallic Pt is broadly identified as a promising PDH catalyst due to its environmental amiability and excellent affinity to CH bonds on alkanes, the rapid deactivation of catalytic activity induced by sintering and coke and the high production cost are still big challenges."
[6] "Coke deposition can occur on both the active compounds and the support surface, ultimately leading to catalytic deactivation by impeding mass transfer and poisoning the active sites."
[7] "Sintering is a process where the supported active compounds agglomerate via a particle migration and coalescence process or the Ostwald ripening process into bigger particles."
[8] "Besides, Cl2 is usually brought in to help the redispersion of the sintered active compounds in industrially utilized Pt-based catalysts."
[9] "To alleviate the catalytic deactivation and increase the potential for practical applications, plentiful researchers have been dedicated to transforming this situation and have already thought out certain optimized strategies."
[10] "Driven by passionate scientific interests and practical demands, a series of reviews have been published to summarize previous studies, yet these mainly focus on comprehensive summaries of the PDH reaction or the introduction of various catalytic systems."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing a viable alternative route to produce propylene from abundant propane resources. This method has gained prominence due to its potential to bypass the constraints imposed by the escalating oil prices and the complexity of traditional production processes. However, the use of conventional catalysts like chromium oxide (CrOx) and platinum (Pt)-based catalysts faces significant challenges, such as toxicity, side reactions, and rapid deactivation due to sintering and coke formation. To overcome these issues, researchers have developed innovative catalyst design strategies that focus on improving the stability and recyclability of PDH catalysts. These strategies include promoting the introduction of specific additives, enhancing the interaction between metals and supports, and modifying the support material itself. By doing so, they aim to prevent or mitigate the formation of coke and sintering, thereby preserving the active sites and ensuring consistent catalytic activity over multiple cycles.
