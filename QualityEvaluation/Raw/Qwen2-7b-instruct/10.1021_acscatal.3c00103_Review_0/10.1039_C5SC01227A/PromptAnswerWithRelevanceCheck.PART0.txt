In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative pathway to produce propylene efficiently. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, have faced issues with high energy consumption and low selectivity, particularly in the production of propylene. PDH processes, especially when optimized with advanced catalysts, can provide a more selective and efficient route to produce propylene from propane, thereby addressing the need for a cleaner and more sustainable chemical production process.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These strategies include:

1. **Alloy Catalysts**: Incorporating multiple metals into a single catalyst can tailor the electronic properties and surface structures to optimize the dehydrogenation reaction. For instance, the use of Pt-Rh alloys can lower the dehydrogenation barriers while maintaining high selectivity towards propylene, as opposed to pure Pt which might suffer from faster deactivation due to coke formation.

2. **Cluster Models**: Finite metal particle models can provide a more nuanced view of the reaction environment, allowing for the simultaneous description of various sites such as corners, edges, and terraces. This approach can help in designing catalysts with optimized reactivity and selectivity. For example, smaller nanoparticles can exhibit enhanced dehydrogenation activity due to the strain effects, which can lower the activation barriers for the initial dehydrogenation steps.

3. **Support Materials**: Incorporating support materials can help in stabilizing the catalyst structure, reducing sintering, and enhancing the recyclability of the catalyst. For instance, the use of supports like γ-alumina can provide a more controlled environment for the catalyst, helping in maintaining its activity and selectivity over multiple cycles.

4. **Modifying Catalyst Surface Properties**: Techniques such as surface modification with elements like boron, sulfur, or gold can alter the surface chemistry and structure, leading to improved stability and reduced coking. These modifications can prevent the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, which is a significant issue in PDH processes, thereby extending the catalyst life and improving efficiency.

5. **Incorporating Active Sites**: The development of catalysts with specific active sites tailored for PDH reactions can optimize the dehydrogenation pathways. For example, incorporating active sites that are optimized for the initial dehydrogenation steps while minimizing the formation of undesired byproducts can enhance the overall efficiency of the process.

6. **Advanced Characterization Techniques**: Utilizing advanced in situ characterization methods can aid in identifying the active sites and reaction pathways on the catalyst surface. This information can be fed back into the catalyst design process, allowing for continuous improvement and optimization of the catalyst performance.

By implementing these strategies, researchers aim to develop more robust, efficient, and sustainable PDH catalysts that can meet the growing demands for propylene production while minimizing environmental impact and operational costs. These advancements in catalyst design and process engineering are crucial for the chemical industry to adapt to changing resource availability and market needs, ensuring a more resilient and environmentally conscious production landscape.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术中，通过提供一种更选择性和高效的丙烯生产途径，以应对工业对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法面临的挑战。传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解在生产丙烯时面临高能消耗和低选择性的问题。PDH过程，特别是当优化高级催化剂时，可以提供一种更选择性的和高效的丙烯生产路径，从而解决清洁和可持续化学生产过程的需求。

为了克服催化剂失活、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. **合金催化剂**：将多种金属整合到单一催化剂中，可以根据反应特性调整电子性质和表面结构，优化脱氢反应。例如，铂铑合金的使用可以降低脱氢壁垒，同时保持高丙烯选择性，而纯铂可能由于焦炭形成导致更快的催化剂失活。

2. **簇模型**：有限金属颗粒模型可以提供更精细的反应环境描述，允许同时描述各种位置，如顶点、边缘和台阶。这种方法有助于设计具有优化活性和选择性的催化剂。例如，较小的纳米粒子可以通过应力效应降低初始脱氢步骤的激活壁垒。

3. **支持材料**：集成支持材料可以帮助稳定催化剂结构，防止烧结，并增强催化剂的循环能力。例如，γ-氧化铝的支持可以为催化剂提供更受控的环境，有助于维持其活动性和选择性，从而延长催化剂寿命并提高效率。

4. **修改催化剂表面性质**：采用硼、硫或金等元素进行表面修饰可以改变表面化学和结构，从而提高稳定性并减少焦炭沉积，这是PDH过程中一个重大问题，进而延长催化剂寿命并改善效率。

5. **特定活性位点的集成**：开发针对PDH反应定制的催化剂，优化初始脱氢步骤，同时最小化副产品的形成，可以提高整体生产效率。

6. **先进的表征技术**：利用先进的原位表征方法可以识别催化剂表面的活性位点和反应途径。这些信息可以反馈到催化剂设计过程中，实现持续改进和优化催化剂性能。

通过实施这些策略，研究人员旨在开发更坚固、高效且可持续的PDH催化剂，以满足对丙烯生产的日益增长的需求，同时减少环境影响和运营成本。这些催化剂设计和工艺工程的进步对于化工行业适应资源可用性和市场需求的变化至关重要，确保建立一个更加坚韧和环境友好的生产景观。

To address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are being developed to produce propylene more efficiently. These techniques aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. 

One innovative strategy involves the use of catalysts with optimized properties. For instance, Pt-based catalysts face challenges with low propylene selectivity and fast deactivation due to coke formation. Researchers have conducted detailed studies on the dehydrogenation of propane on various Pt surfaces, identifying 17 dehydrogenation steps and 11 CC bond breaking steps. They found that on Pt(111), the binding energy of propylene is notably higher (118 kJ/mol) compared to its dehydrogenation barrier (66 kJ/mol). This suggests that Pt(111) might not be the most efficient catalyst for propylene production.

Additionally, the study revealed that the initial dehydrogenation of ethylene is more favorable than its cracking into two CH2 groups, indicating a potential pathway to optimize propylene production. The research also highlighted the importance of step-edge sites in ethylene decomposition, showing that these sites are more reactive than regular sites, influencing the selectivity between initial CH and CC bond breaking.

In summary, the development of PDH techniques involves the optimization of catalyst properties, such as selectivity and stability, to efficiently produce propylene and mitigate deactivation issues. The use of advanced catalyst designs and understanding the specific roles of different sites on the catalyst surface can significantly enhance the performance of PDH processes.

为了应对工业对丙烯需求的增长以及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术正在被开发以更有效地生产丙烯。这些技术旨在克服脱氢过程中的失活问题、提高稳定性并改善循环利用性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中。

一种创新策略涉及使用具有优化特性的催化剂。例如，基于铂的催化剂面临低丙烯选择性和快速失活的问题，这是由于焦炭形成造成的。研究人员已经对丙烷在不同铂表面的脱氢进行了详细研究，识别出了17个脱氢步骤和11个碳-碳键断裂步骤。他们发现，在铂(111)表面上，丙烯的结合能比其脱氢壁垒高得多（118 kJ/mol与66 kJ/mol）。这表明铂(111)可能不是生产丙烯的最佳催化剂。

此外，研究表明，乙烷的初始脱氢比其裂解成两个CH2组更为有利，暗示了一条优化丙烯生产的潜在途径。研究还强调了边缘位点在乙烷分解中的重要性，显示这些位点比常规位点更活跃，影响初始CH和CC键断裂之间的选择性。

总之，PDH技术的发展涉及优化催化剂特性，如选择性和稳定性，以高效地生产丙烯并减少失活问题。通过先进的催化剂设计和理解催化剂表面特定位点的作用，可以显著增强PDH过程的性能。

In response to increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer a viable alternative. Commercial PDH catalysts, primarily categorized into chromium (Cr)-based and platinum (Pt)-based, face challenges such as low selectivity to propylene and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Studies by Yang et al. have explored the dehydrogenation processes on Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211) surfaces, revealing 17 dehydrogenation steps and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The binding energy of propylene on Pt(100) is notably higher than its dehydrogenation barrier, while on Pt(111), the binding energy drops, increasing the dehydrogenation barrier. Alloying Pt with tin (Sn) in the PtSn catalyst can mitigate deactivation issues by increasing the dehydrogenation barrier, attributed to the deeper d-band center compared to pure Pt. Unwanted coke formation occurs when carbon centers are fully dehydrogenated but not removed from the catalyst surface, affecting the selectivity of desired products and catalytic activity.

随着化石燃料储备的减少和天然气及页岩气利用的发展，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术成为生产丙烯的有前景的替代方案。商业PDH催化剂主要分为铬（Cr）基和铂（Pt）基两类，面临着低丙烯选择性和快速失活的问题，尤其是由于焦炭形成导致的。杨等人对Pt(111)、Pt(100)和Pt(211)表面的丙烷脱氢过程进行了深入研究，发现了17个脱氢步骤和11个碳碳键断裂步骤。在Pt(100)表面上，丙烯的结合能显著高于其脱氢壁垒，在Pt(111)表面上，结合能下降，导致脱氢壁垒增加。通过将Pt与锡（Sn）合金化制成PtSn催化剂，可以缓解失活问题，通过提高脱氢壁垒来实现，原因是Sn使Pt的d带中心更深，相比纯Pt而言。当碳中心完全脱氢但未从催化剂表面去除时，不希望的焦炭形成不仅降低了目标产品的选择性，还导致催化剂结构的改变和催化活性的降低直至完全失效。
