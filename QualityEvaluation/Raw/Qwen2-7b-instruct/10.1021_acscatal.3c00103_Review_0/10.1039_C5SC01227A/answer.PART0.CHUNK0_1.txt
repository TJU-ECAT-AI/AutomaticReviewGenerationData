To address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are being developed to produce propylene more efficiently. These techniques aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. 

One innovative strategy involves the use of catalysts with optimized properties. For instance, Pt-based catalysts face challenges with low propylene selectivity and fast deactivation due to coke formation. Researchers have conducted detailed studies on the dehydrogenation of propane on various Pt surfaces, identifying 17 dehydrogenation steps and 11 CC bond breaking steps. They found that on Pt(111), the binding energy of propylene is notably higher (118 kJ/mol) compared to its dehydrogenation barrier (66 kJ/mol). This suggests that Pt(111) might not be the most efficient catalyst for propylene production.

Additionally, the study revealed that the initial dehydrogenation of ethylene is more favorable than its cracking into two CH2 groups, indicating a potential pathway to optimize propylene production. The research also highlighted the importance of step-edge sites in ethylene decomposition, showing that these sites are more reactive than regular sites, influencing the selectivity between initial CH and CC bond breaking.

In summary, the development of PDH techniques involves the optimization of catalyst properties, such as selectivity and stability, to efficiently produce propylene and mitigate deactivation issues. The use of advanced catalyst designs and understanding the specific roles of different sites on the catalyst surface can significantly enhance the performance of PDH processes.

为了应对工业对丙烯需求的增长以及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术正在被开发以更有效地生产丙烯。这些技术旨在克服脱氢过程中的失活问题、提高稳定性并改善循环利用性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中。

一种创新策略涉及使用具有优化特性的催化剂。例如，基于铂的催化剂面临低丙烯选择性和快速失活的问题，这是由于焦炭形成造成的。研究人员已经对丙烷在不同铂表面的脱氢进行了详细研究，识别出了17个脱氢步骤和11个碳-碳键断裂步骤。他们发现，在铂(111)表面上，丙烯的结合能比其脱氢壁垒高得多（118 kJ/mol与66 kJ/mol）。这表明铂(111)可能不是生产丙烯的最佳催化剂。

此外，研究表明，乙烷的初始脱氢比其裂解成两个CH2组更为有利，暗示了一条优化丙烯生产的潜在途径。研究还强调了边缘位点在乙烷分解中的重要性，显示这些位点比常规位点更活跃，影响初始CH和CC键断裂之间的选择性。

总之，PDH技术的发展涉及优化催化剂特性，如选择性和稳定性，以高效地生产丙烯并减少失活问题。通过先进的催化剂设计和理解催化剂表面特定位点的作用，可以显著增强PDH过程的性能。
