[1] "Along with the decreasing fossil oil reserves and development on utilization of nature gas and shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) seems to be a promising alternative to produce propylene."
[2] "The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."

[5] "Similar as the discussion of alloy for methane dehydrogenation, the lower reactivity (i.e. higher dehydrogenation barrier) on PtSn alloy is due to the deeper d-band center compared to pure Pt."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative pathway to produce propylene efficiently. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, have faced issues with high energy consumption and low selectivity, particularly in the production of propylene. PDH processes, especially when optimized with advanced catalysts, can provide a more selective and efficient route to produce propylene from propane, thereby addressing the need for a cleaner and more sustainable chemical production process.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These strategies include:

1. **Alloy Catalysts**: Incorporating multiple metals into a single catalyst can tailor the electronic properties and surface structures to optimize the dehydrogenation reaction. For instance, the use of Pt-Rh alloys can lower the dehydrogenation barriers while maintaining high selectivity towards propylene, as opposed to pure Pt which might suffer from faster deactivation due to coke formation.

2. **Cluster Models**: Finite metal particle models can provide a more nuanced view of the reaction environment, allowing for the simultaneous description of various sites such as corners, edges, and terraces. This approach can help in designing catalysts with optimized reactivity and selectivity. For example, smaller nanoparticles can exhibit enhanced dehydrogenation activity due to the strain effects, which can lower the activation barriers for the initial dehydrogenation steps.

3. **Support Materials**: Incorporating support materials can help in stabilizing the catalyst structure, reducing sintering, and enhancing the recyclability of the catalyst. For instance, the use of supports like γ-alumina can provide a more controlled environment for the catalyst, helping in maintaining its activity and selectivity over multiple cycles.

4. **Modifying Catalyst Surface Properties**: Techniques such as surface modification with elements like boron, sulfur, or gold can alter the surface chemistry and structure, leading to improved stability and reduced coking. These modifications can prevent the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, which is a significant issue in PDH processes, thereby extending the catalyst life and improving efficiency.

5. **Incorporating Active Sites**: The development of catalysts with specific active sites tailored for PDH reactions can optimize the dehydrogenation pathways. For example, incorporating active sites that are optimized for the initial dehydrogenation steps while minimizing the formation of undesired byproducts can enhance the overall efficiency of the process.

6. **Advanced Characterization Techniques**: Utilizing advanced in situ characterization methods can aid in identifying the active sites and reaction pathways on the catalyst surface. This information can be fed back into the catalyst design process, allowing for continuous improvement and optimization of the catalyst performance.

By implementing these strategies, researchers aim to develop more robust, efficient, and sustainable PDH catalysts that can meet the growing demands for propylene production while minimizing environmental impact and operational costs. These advancements in catalyst design and process engineering are crucial for the chemical industry to adapt to changing resource availability and market needs, ensuring a more resilient and environmentally conscious production landscape.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术中，通过提供一种更选择性和高效的丙烯生产途径，以应对工业对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法面临的挑战。传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解在生产丙烯时面临高能消耗和低选择性的问题。PDH过程，特别是当优化高级催化剂时，可以提供一种更选择性的和高效的丙烯生产路径，从而解决清洁和可持续化学生产过程的需求。

为了克服催化剂失活、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. **合金催化剂**：将多种金属整合到单一催化剂中，可以根据反应特性调整电子性质和表面结构，优化脱氢反应。例如，铂铑合金的使用可以降低脱氢壁垒，同时保持高丙烯选择性，而纯铂可能由于焦炭形成导致更快的催化剂失活。

2. **簇模型**：有限金属颗粒模型可以提供更精细的反应环境描述，允许同时描述各种位置，如顶点、边缘和台阶。这种方法有助于设计具有优化活性和选择性的催化剂。例如，较小的纳米粒子可以通过应力效应降低初始脱氢步骤的激活壁垒。

3. **支持材料**：集成支持材料可以帮助稳定催化剂结构，防止烧结，并增强催化剂的循环能力。例如，γ-氧化铝的支持可以为催化剂提供更受控的环境，有助于维持其活动性和选择性，从而延长催化剂寿命并提高效率。

4. **修改催化剂表面性质**：采用硼、硫或金等元素进行表面修饰可以改变表面化学和结构，从而提高稳定性并减少焦炭沉积，这是PDH过程中一个重大问题，进而延长催化剂寿命并改善效率。
