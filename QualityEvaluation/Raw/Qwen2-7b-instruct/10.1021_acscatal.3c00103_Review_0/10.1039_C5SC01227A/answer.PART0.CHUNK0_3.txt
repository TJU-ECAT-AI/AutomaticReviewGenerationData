[1] "Along with the decreasing fossil oil reserves and development on utilization of nature gas and shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) seems to be a promising alternative to produce propylene."
[2] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
[3] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps."
[4] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."
[5] "Similar as the discussion of alloy for methane dehydrogenation, the lower reactivity (i.e. higher dehydrogenation barrier) on PtSn alloy is due to the deeper d-band center compared to pure Pt."
[6] "Coke may, for instance, form if carbon centers are completely dehydrogenated but not removed from the catalyst surface. The unwanted formation of carbonaceous depositions not only decreases the selectivity towards the desired products, but also leads to the modification of a catalyst and the reduction of the catalytic activity up to complete deactivation."

In response to increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer a viable alternative. Commercial PDH catalysts, primarily categorized into chromium (Cr)-based and platinum (Pt)-based, face challenges such as low selectivity to propylene and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Studies by Yang et al. have explored the dehydrogenation processes on Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211) surfaces, revealing 17 dehydrogenation steps and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The binding energy of propylene on Pt(100) is notably higher than its dehydrogenation barrier, while on Pt(111), the binding energy drops, increasing the dehydrogenation barrier. Alloying Pt with tin (Sn) in the PtSn catalyst can mitigate deactivation issues by increasing the dehydrogenation barrier, attributed to the deeper d-band center compared to pure Pt. Unwanted coke formation occurs when carbon centers are fully dehydrogenated but not removed from the catalyst surface, affecting the selectivity of desired products and catalytic activity.

随着化石燃料储备的减少和天然气及页岩气利用的发展，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术成为生产丙烯的有前景的替代方案。商业PDH催化剂主要分为铬（Cr）基和铂（Pt）基两类，面临着低丙烯选择性和快速失活的问题，尤其是由于焦炭形成导致的。杨等人对Pt(111)、Pt(100)和Pt(211)表面的丙烷脱氢过程进行了深入研究，发现了17个脱氢步骤和11个碳碳键断裂步骤。在Pt(100)表面上，丙烯的结合能显著高于其脱氢壁垒，在Pt(111)表面上，结合能下降，导致脱氢壁垒增加。通过将Pt与锡（Sn）合金化制成PtSn催化剂，可以缓解失活问题，通过提高脱氢壁垒来实现，原因是Sn使Pt的d带中心更深，相比纯Pt而言。当碳中心完全脱氢但未从催化剂表面去除时，不希望的焦炭形成不仅降低了目标产品的选择性，还导致催化剂结构的改变和催化活性的降低直至完全失效。
