[1] "Along with the decreasing fossil oil reserves and development on utilization of nature gas and shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) seems to be a promising alternative to produce propylene."
[2] "The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
[3] "Yang et al.93 also experimentally compared activity and selectivity of 12 nm cubic and octahedral Pt particles, which expose large area of Pt(100) and Pt(111), respectively. Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
[4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

In addressing the increasing demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer a viable solution. These methods allow for the conversion of propane into propylene, a key building block in the chemical industry. Innovations in catalyst design are crucial to overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in PDH processes. Catalysts incorporating promoters like late transition metals, main-group metals (such as Sn and Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides have been developed to increase robustness against coking, thereby improving the overall efficiency and longevity of PDH reactions.
