To address the growing industrial demand for propylene and overcome limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are being innovatively designed. These strategies focus on developing well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts. By employing these catalysts, researchers aim to tackle deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.
