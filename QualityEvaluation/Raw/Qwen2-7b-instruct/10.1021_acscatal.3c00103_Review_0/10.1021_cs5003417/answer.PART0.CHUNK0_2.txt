[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to its potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact compared to conventional processes."
[2] "One of the main challenges in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is the deactivation of catalysts, which limits their long-term stability and efficiency."
[3] "To overcome deactivation issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, to improve stability and recyclability."
[4] "These catalysts are designed to operate under mild conditions, reducing the formation of coke and other unwanted byproducts, which contribute to catalyst deactivation."

Propane dehydrogenation techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. Innovations in catalyst design, particularly the use of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These catalysts are engineered to operate under mild conditions, minimizing the formation of coke and other byproducts that typically lead to catalyst deactivation.
