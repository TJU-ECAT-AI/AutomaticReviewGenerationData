The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by providing an efficient alternative. Innovations in catalyst design focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability. For oxidative PDH, strategies include the development of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Nonoxidative PDH processes also benefit from advanced catalysts that optimize propylene yield and reduce energy consumption.
