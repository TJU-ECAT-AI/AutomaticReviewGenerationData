Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering more efficient and sustainable methods for propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies aim to increase yield, reduce energy consumption, and prolong catalyst life, thereby contributing to more environmentally friendly and economically viable propylene production.
