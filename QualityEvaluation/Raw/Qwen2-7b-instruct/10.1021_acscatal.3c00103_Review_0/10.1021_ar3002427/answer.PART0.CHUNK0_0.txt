[1] "With dwindling supplies of precious metals and increasing demand, fundamental understanding of catalyst sintering is very important for achieving clean energy, a clean environment, and atom selectivity in chemical conversion processes."
[2] "The general phenomena can be captured correctly, but the mechanisms cannot be determined."
[3] "While the specific time for the transition from one phase to another depends on the metal, support, and gas atmosphere, we propose to divide the process of catalyst sintering into three distinct phases."
[4] "The original formulation of the mechanism of sintering by coalescence assumes diffusive particle migration."
[5] "At high temperatures, other parasitic phenomena, such as support sintering, also become important."

To address the challenges of increasing demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are being developed to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovations in catalyst design focus on creating materials that can withstand harsh operating conditions, retain their activity over extended periods, and efficiently convert propane into propylene with high selectivity. Strategies include the use of advanced materials, optimized support structures, and tailored surface modifications to improve the catalyst's resistance to sintering and other degradation pathways. These advancements aim to maximize efficiency, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact in PDH processes.
