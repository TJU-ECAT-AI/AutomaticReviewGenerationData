The literature discusses the challenges faced by traditional production methods for propylene, particularly the limitations in meeting the increasing industrial demand. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are highlighted as a solution to these challenges, offering a way to produce propylene more efficiently. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

In the context of PDH, the literature delves into the mechanisms of catalyst sintering, specifically focusing on the processes of particle migration and Ostwald ripening. It is noted that in the initial stage of catalyst sintering, Ostwald ripening is responsible for the rapid loss of activity, particularly when particles are very small. This is supported by in situ TEM observations and Monte Carlo simulations. As particles grow larger, sintering slows down, and the literature suggests that atom transfer becomes the most likely mechanism for further growth. The study of model Pt/SiO2 samples under various conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of these strategies in mitigating sintering and maintaining catalyst performance over time.

文献讨论了传统生产方法在丙烯需求增长背景下的挑战，特别是满足这一增长的需求。丙烷裂解（PDH）技术被作为解决这些挑战的一种手段，提供了一种更有效生产丙烯的方式。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服活性衰减问题、提高稳定性并改善氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中的可回收性。

在PDH的背景下，文献深入探讨了催化剂烧结的机制，特别关注了粒子迁移和奥斯特瓦尔德溶解的过程。文献指出，在催化剂烧结的早期阶段，奥斯特瓦尔德溶解对活性的快速损失负责，尤其是在粒子非常小时。这得到了原位透射电子显微镜观察和蒙特卡洛模拟的支持。随着粒子尺寸的增长，烧结速度放缓，并且文献表明，原子转移可能是进一步生长的最可能机制。在不同条件下对模型Pt/SiO2样本的研究证明了这些策略在维持催化剂性能和时间上的有效性。

The document discusses the process of sintering in metal nanoparticles, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity in industrial applications such as fuel production, chemical synthesis, and exhaust cleanup. The two primary mechanisms proposed for sintering are particle migration and coalescence (PMC), and Ostwald ripening (OR). The sintering process is divided into three phases: a rapid loss of activity, a slowdown in sintering, and a potential stable performance. The document highlights that the loss of activity is primarily caused by the disappearance of the smallest particles, aligning with atomistic simulations. In the intermediate phase, a combination of PMC and OR is observed, though the relative contributions are not fully understood. In the later stages, the particles grow larger, and other phenomena such as support restructuring become significant. The document concludes that OR is the dominant process causing nanoparticle growth, leading to a loss of surface area and activity. Controlling sintering involves strategies like anchoring particles within a porous support or adding components to alter the composition or support surface structure to improve stability and performance.

文档讨论了金属纳米颗粒的烧结过程，这对于工业应用至关重要，如燃料生产、化学合成和废气处理。提出的两种主要烧结机制是粒子迁移和凝聚（PMC）以及奥斯特瓦尔德细化（OR）。烧结过程被分为三个阶段：活性快速下降、烧结速度减慢以及可能达到稳定性能。文献强调活性损失主要是由于最小粒子的消失，这与原子级模拟的结果一致。在中间阶段，观察到PMC和OR的组合，但这些过程的相对贡献尚未完全理解。在后期阶段，粒子变大，并且其他现象如支撑重构变得重要，尤其是在高温下。文献结论指出，OR是导致纳米粒子尺寸增长的主要过程，导致表面面积和活性的损失。控制烧结的方法包括将粒子锚定在多孔支撑中或添加成分以改变组成或支撑表面结构来提高稳定性与性能。

Catalyst sintering, particularly in high-temperature catalytic processes, poses a significant challenge to industries aiming to produce clean fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The loss of catalyst activity due to sintering is addressed by understanding the underlying mechanisms. Two primary mechanisms are proposed: particle migration and coalescence (PMC) versus Ostwald ripening (OR). The process of sintering is typically divided into three phases: an initial rapid loss of activity, a slowdown, and a potential stabilization. Recent advancements in in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques enable the observation of catalyst behavior under real operational conditions. Studies reveal that OR is the primary driver of rapid sintering in the early stages, characterized by the disappearance of the smallest particles. As the catalyst ages, sintering slows down, and the largest particles begin to grow, often through coalescence events. In the later stages, the catalyst may reach a performance plateau, influenced by factors such as support restructuring at high temperatures. Insights into the detailed mechanisms of sintering can guide the development of more durable catalysts, capable of self-repair and designed for extended operation.

在高温催化过程中，催化剂失活是工业界面临的一大挑战，这涉及到清洁燃料、化学品和制药产品的生产，以及汽车和固定能源装置的废气处理。通过理解其背后的机制，可以解决催化剂失活问题。两种主要机制被提出：粒子迁移与凝聚（PMC）和奥斯特瓦尔德成核（OR）。通常将烧结过程分为三个阶段：活性迅速丧失、速度减慢以及催化剂可能达到稳定性能。近来，原位透射电子显微镜（TEM）技术的进步使得能够在实际操作条件下观察催化剂的行为成为可能。研究表明，在早期阶段，OR是导致快速烧结的主要原因，特征为最小颗粒的消失。随着催化剂的老化，烧结速度减慢，最大的颗粒开始通过凝聚事件增长。在后期阶段，催化剂可能会达到一个性能平台，受到高温下支撑结构重排等因素的影响。深入了解烧结机制可以帮助开发更耐用的催化剂，能够自我修复，并设计用于长期运行的催化剂。

1. The decreasing supply of precious metals and rising demand necessitate a deep understanding of catalyst sintering for the advancement of clean energy, environmental cleanliness, and atom selectivity in chemical conversion processes. Metal nanoparticles, serving as active sites in heterogeneous catalysts, are crucial for industrial applications such as fuel production, chemical synthesis, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and exhaust cleanup from vehicles and stationary power plants.

2. Sintering, or thermal deactivation, is a significant mechanism for catalyst inactivation, particularly in high-temperature processes like steam reforming and automotive exhaust treatment.

3. The study of Pt/SiO2 nanoparticles under oxygen pressure and temperature conditions revealed that over 10 hours of observation, there was no substantial change in the particle count per unit area, indicating that particle migration (PM) was not responsible for the observed changes.

4. Understanding the initial stages of sintering is vital because it provides insights into the behavior of the smallest metal particles in heterogeneous catalysts, which are often the most active and selective.

5. The early stages of nickel sintering were characterized by the ripening of small particles. After 30 minutes of heating, the small particles vanished, whereas the remaining particles grew in size.

6. An activation energy of 264 kJ/mol was derived from the model fitting of the experimental observations, which was consistent with the thermodynamic energies relevant to the catalyst system. This energy, combined with a deterministic model for Ostwald ripening, enabled accurate predictions of the particle size distribution after 30 minutes of sintering.

7. As a catalyst ages, the rate of decline in its surface area decreases, a common observation across various experimental studies employing diverse techniques.

8. Under extreme conditions (1:1 hydrogen to water at 750°C), the particle size distribution exhibited a tail, fitting a log-normal distribution very well, and particles larger than 20 nm were observed.

9. The sintering mechanism is not solely diffusive particle migration; other possibilities include attractive migration and coalescence, nondiffusive migration along edges with potential collisions, or simple coalescence of particles without migration when they are close enough to touch or have overlapping diffusive fields of adatom species.

10. At high temperatures, such as 900°C, the Tammann temperature for alumina is surpassed, leading to the transformation of alumina from a high-surface-area transitional form to a low-surface-area α-alumina.

1. 随着稀有金属供应的减少和需求的增长，催化剂烧结的理解对于实现清洁能源、环境清洁以及化学转化过程中的原子选择性非常重要。金属纳米颗粒作为异质催化剂的活性位点，在燃料生产、化学合成、制药制造和车辆及固定电源排放清理等方面具有重要工业应用。

2. 烧结，或热失活，是催化剂失效的重要机制，尤其是在蒸汽重整、汽车废气处理等高温催化过程中。

3. 在氧气压力和温度条件下研究Pt/SiO2纳米颗粒时发现，在10小时的观察中，单位面积上的颗粒数量没有显著变化，表明粒子迁移（PM）不是引起观测变化的原因。

4. 理解初期烧结的重要性在于它提供了关于最小金属颗粒在异质催化剂中的行为的见解，这些颗粒往往是活性和选择性最高的。

5. 镍在早期阶段的烧结是由小颗粒的晶化主导的。加热30分钟后，小颗粒消失，而剩余的颗粒增长。

6. 从模型拟合实验观察中推导出264 kJ/mol的激活能，与催化剂系统相关的热力学能量一致。结合确定性模型进行奥斯特瓦尔德细化，可以准确预测30分钟烧结后颗粒大小分布。

7. 随着催化剂老化，其表面区域下降的速度减慢，这是各种技术实验的普遍观察。

8. 在极端条件（1：1氢气到水蒸气下750°C）下，颗粒大小分布出现了尾巴，很好地拟合了对数正态分布，并观察到大于20nm的颗粒。

9. 烧结机制不仅仅是扩散粒子迁移；其他可能性包括吸引迁移和凝聚、沿着边缘的非扩散迁移（如上述）可能的碰撞，或者当颗粒接近或具有重叠的扩散场时简单地凝聚，没有迁移。

10. 在900°C这样的高温下，已经超过了氧化铝的Tammann温度，导致氧化铝从高表面面积过渡形式转变为低表面面积α-氧化铝。
