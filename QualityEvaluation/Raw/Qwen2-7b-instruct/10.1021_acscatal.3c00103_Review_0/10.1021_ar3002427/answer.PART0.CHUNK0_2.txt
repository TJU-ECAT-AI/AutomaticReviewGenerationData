[1] "Metal nanoparticles contain the active sites in heterogeneous catalysts, which are important for many industrial applications including the production of clean fuels, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and the cleanup of exhaust from automobiles and stationary power plants."
[2] "Sintering, or thermal deactivation, is an important mechanism for the loss of catalyst activity. This is especially true for high temperature catalytic processes, such as steam reforming, automotive exhaust treatment, or catalytic combustion."
[3] "Scientists have proposed two mechanisms for sintering of nanoparticles: particle migration and coalescence (PMC) and Ostwald ripening (OR)."
[4] "In this Account, we divide the process of sintering into three phases. Phase I involves rapid loss in catalyst activity (or surface area), phase II is where sintering slows down, and phase III is where the catalyst may reach a stable performance."
[5] "The rapid loss of activity is caused by the disappearance of the smallest particles. These findings are in good agreement with representative atomistic simulations of sintering."
[6] "In phase II, sintering slows down since the smallest particles have disappeared. We now see a combination of PMC and OR, but do not fully understand the relative contribution of each of these processes to the overall rates of sintering."
[7] "In phase III, the particles have grown large and other parasitic phenomena, such as support restructuring, can become important, especially at high temperatures."
[8] "In conclusion, the recent literature, especially on in situ studies, shows that OR is the dominant process causing the growth of nanoparticle size. Consequently, this leads to the loss of surface area and activity."
[9] "The improved catalytic performance in these catalysts must result from confining the particles within the porous structure. The lack of pore connectivity may slow the overall rate of sintering and a second benefit is improved metalsupport contact within the pore structure."

The document discusses the process of sintering in metal nanoparticles, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity in industrial applications such as fuel production, chemical synthesis, and exhaust cleanup. The two primary mechanisms proposed for sintering are particle migration and coalescence (PMC), and Ostwald ripening (OR). The sintering process is divided into three phases: a rapid loss of activity, a slowdown in sintering, and a potential stable performance. The document highlights that the loss of activity is primarily caused by the disappearance of the smallest particles, aligning with atomistic simulations. In the intermediate phase, a combination of PMC and OR is observed, though the relative contributions are not fully understood. In the later stages, the particles grow larger, and other phenomena such as support restructuring become significant. The document concludes that OR is the dominant process causing nanoparticle growth, leading to a loss of surface area and activity. Controlling sintering involves strategies like anchoring particles within a porous support or adding components to alter the composition or support surface structure to improve stability and performance.

文档讨论了金属纳米颗粒的烧结过程，这对于工业应用至关重要，如燃料生产、化学合成和废气处理。提出的两种主要烧结机制是粒子迁移和凝聚（PMC）以及奥斯特瓦尔德细化（OR）。烧结过程被分为三个阶段：活性快速下降、烧结速度减慢以及可能达到稳定性能。文献强调活性损失主要是由于最小粒子的消失，这与原子级模拟的结果一致。在中间阶段，观察到PMC和OR的组合，但这些过程的相对贡献尚未完全理解。在后期阶段，粒子变大，并且其他现象如支撑重构变得重要，尤其是在高温下。文献结论指出，OR是导致纳米粒子尺寸增长的主要过程，导致表面面积和活性的损失。控制烧结的方法包括将粒子锚定在多孔支撑中或添加成分以改变组成或支撑表面结构来提高稳定性与性能。
