[1] "With dwindling supplies of precious metals and increasing demand, fundamental understanding of catalyst sintering is very important for achieving clean energy, a clean environment, and atom selectivity in chemical conversion processes."
[2] "Metal nanoparticles constitute the active sites in heterogeneous catalysts, which are important for many industrial applications including the production of clean fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals and in cleanup of exhaust from automobiles and stationary power plants."
[3] "The growth of supported metal nanoparticles is referred to as sintering and it results in loss of active surface area. Sintering, or thermal deactivation, is an important mechanism for the loss of catalyst activity, especially for high temperature catalytic processes, such as steam reforming and automotive exhaust conversion."
[4] "We recently studied model Pt/SiO2 samples (9) under 560 Pa of O2 at 550 C for up to 10 h in an environmental transmission electron microscope. The mean particle diameter was smaller than 3 nm, and the interparticle separation was about 5 nm. Over the 10 h of observation there was no significant change in the number of particles per unit area, ruling out PMC as being responsible."
[5] "Understanding this initial stage of sintering is important because it provides insight into the behavior of the smallest metal particles in heterogeneous catalysts which are also in many cases the most active and selective."
[6] "The early stages of Ni sintering were dominated by ripening of the smallest particles. Figure 2 shows an image of the Ni catalyst after reaching 650 C and after 30 min of heating with the beam off. The small particles have all disappeared while the remaining particles (marked with numbers) have grown in size."
[7] "Remarkably, this activation energy combined with a deterministic model for OR allowed predictions of particle size distribution after 30 min of sintering that closely matched the experimental observations."
[8] "As the catalyst is aged, the rate of decline in catalyst surface area slows down. This is a general observation of many experimental studies using a variety of techniques."
[9] "In each case the PSDs developed a tail on the right and fit the log-normal distribution very well. Under the harshest conditions (1:1 H2/H2O at 750 C), particles larger than 20 nm were observed."
[10] "The original formulation of the mechanism of sintering by coalescence assumes diffusive particle migration. Other mechanisms are also likely, and possibly significant, such as attractive migration and coalescence, nondiffusive migration along edges (noted above) with possible collisions, or simple coalescence of particles without any migration when the particles are close enough to be either touching or having an overlapping diffusive field of adatom species."
[11] "At high temperatures, other parasitic phenomena, such as support sintering, also become important. For instance, at 900 C, we have already exceeded the Tammann temperature for alumina. The alumina transforms from a high surface area transitional alumina into low surface area α-alumina."

1. The decreasing supply of precious metals and rising demand necessitate a deep understanding of catalyst sintering for the advancement of clean energy, environmental cleanliness, and atom selectivity in chemical conversion processes. Metal nanoparticles, serving as active sites in heterogeneous catalysts, are crucial for industrial applications such as fuel production, chemical synthesis, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and exhaust cleanup from vehicles and stationary power plants.

2. Sintering, or thermal deactivation, is a significant mechanism for catalyst inactivation, particularly in high-temperature processes like steam reforming and automotive exhaust treatment.

3. The study of Pt/SiO2 nanoparticles under oxygen pressure and temperature conditions revealed that over 10 hours of observation, there was no substantial change in the particle count per unit area, indicating that particle migration (PM) was not responsible for the observed changes.

4. Understanding the initial stages of sintering is vital because it provides insights into the behavior of the smallest metal particles in heterogeneous catalysts, which are often the most active and selective.

5. The early stages of nickel sintering were characterized by the ripening of small particles. After 30 minutes of heating, the small particles vanished, whereas the remaining particles grew in size.

6. An activation energy of 264 kJ/mol was derived from the model fitting of the experimental observations, which was consistent with the thermodynamic energies relevant to the catalyst system. This energy, combined with a deterministic model for Ostwald ripening, enabled accurate predictions of the particle size distribution after 30 minutes of sintering.

7. As a catalyst ages, the rate of decline in its surface area decreases, a common observation across various experimental studies employing diverse techniques.

8. Under extreme conditions (1:1 hydrogen to water at 750°C), the particle size distribution exhibited a tail, fitting a log-normal distribution very well, and particles larger than 20 nm were observed.

9. The sintering mechanism is not solely diffusive particle migration; other possibilities include attractive migration and coalescence, nondiffusive migration along edges with potential collisions, or simple coalescence of particles without migration when they are close enough to touch or have overlapping diffusive fields of adatom species.

10. At high temperatures, such as 900°C, the Tammann temperature for alumina is surpassed, leading to the transformation of alumina from a high-surface-area transitional form to a low-surface-area α-alumina.

1. 随着稀有金属供应的减少和需求的增长，催化剂烧结的理解对于实现清洁能源、环境清洁以及化学转化过程中的原子选择性非常重要。金属纳米颗粒作为异质催化剂的活性位点，在燃料生产、化学合成、制药制造和车辆及固定电源排放清理等方面具有重要工业应用。

2. 烧结，或热失活，是催化剂失效的重要机制，尤其是在蒸汽重整、汽车废气处理等高温催化过程中。

3. 在氧气压力和温度条件下研究Pt/SiO2纳米颗粒时发现，在10小时的观察中，单位面积上的颗粒数量没有显著变化，表明粒子迁移（PM）不是引起观测变化的原因。

4. 理解初期烧结的重要性在于它提供了关于最小金属颗粒在异质催化剂中的行为的见解，这些颗粒往往是活性和选择性最高的。

5. 镍在早期阶段的烧结是由小颗粒的晶化主导的。加热30分钟后，小颗粒消失，而剩余的颗粒增长。

6. 从模型拟合实验观察中推导出264 kJ/mol的激活能，与催化剂系统相关的热力学能量一致。结合确定性模型进行奥斯特瓦尔德细化，可以准确预测30分钟烧结后颗粒大小分布。

7. 随着催化剂老化，其表面区域下降的速度减慢，这是各种技术实验的普遍观察。

8. 在极端条件（1：1氢气到水蒸气下750°C）下，颗粒大小分布出现了尾巴，很好地拟合了对数正态分布，并观察到大于20nm的颗粒。

9. 烧结机制不仅仅是扩散粒子迁移；其他可能性包括吸引迁移和凝聚、沿着边缘的非扩散迁移（如上述）可能的碰撞，或者当颗粒接近或具有重叠的扩散场时简单地凝聚，没有迁移。

10. 在900°C这样的高温下，已经超过了氧化铝的Tammann温度，导致氧化铝从高表面面积过渡形式转变为低表面面积α-氧化铝。
