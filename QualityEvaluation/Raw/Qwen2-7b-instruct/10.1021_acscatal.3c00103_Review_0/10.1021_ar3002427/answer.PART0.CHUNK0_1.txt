The literature discusses the challenges faced by traditional production methods for propylene, particularly the limitations in meeting the increasing industrial demand. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are highlighted as a solution to these challenges, offering a way to produce propylene more efficiently. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

In the context of PDH, the literature delves into the mechanisms of catalyst sintering, specifically focusing on the processes of particle migration and Ostwald ripening. It is noted that in the initial stage of catalyst sintering, Ostwald ripening is responsible for the rapid loss of activity, particularly when particles are very small. This is supported by in situ TEM observations and Monte Carlo simulations. As particles grow larger, sintering slows down, and the literature suggests that atom transfer becomes the most likely mechanism for further growth. The study of model Pt/SiO2 samples under various conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of these strategies in mitigating sintering and maintaining catalyst performance over time.

文献讨论了传统生产方法在丙烯需求增长背景下的挑战，特别是满足这一增长的需求。丙烷裂解（PDH）技术被作为解决这些挑战的一种手段，提供了一种更有效生产丙烯的方式。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服活性衰减问题、提高稳定性并改善氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中的可回收性。

在PDH的背景下，文献深入探讨了催化剂烧结的机制，特别关注了粒子迁移和奥斯特瓦尔德溶解的过程。文献指出，在催化剂烧结的早期阶段，奥斯特瓦尔德溶解对活性的快速损失负责，尤其是在粒子非常小时。这得到了原位透射电子显微镜观察和蒙特卡洛模拟的支持。随着粒子尺寸的增长，烧结速度放缓，并且文献表明，原子转移可能是进一步生长的最可能机制。在不同条件下对模型Pt/SiO2样本的研究证明了这些策略在维持催化剂性能和时间上的有效性。
