Catalyst sintering, particularly in high-temperature catalytic processes, poses a significant challenge to industries aiming to produce clean fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The loss of catalyst activity due to sintering is addressed by understanding the underlying mechanisms. Two primary mechanisms are proposed: particle migration and coalescence (PMC) versus Ostwald ripening (OR). The process of sintering is typically divided into three phases: an initial rapid loss of activity, a slowdown, and a potential stabilization. Recent advancements in in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques enable the observation of catalyst behavior under real operational conditions. Studies reveal that OR is the primary driver of rapid sintering in the early stages, characterized by the disappearance of the smallest particles. As the catalyst ages, sintering slows down, and the largest particles begin to grow, often through coalescence events. In the later stages, the catalyst may reach a performance plateau, influenced by factors such as support restructuring at high temperatures. Insights into the detailed mechanisms of sintering can guide the development of more durable catalysts, capable of self-repair and designed for extended operation.

在高温催化过程中，催化剂失活是工业界面临的一大挑战，这涉及到清洁燃料、化学品和制药产品的生产，以及汽车和固定能源装置的废气处理。通过理解其背后的机制，可以解决催化剂失活问题。两种主要机制被提出：粒子迁移与凝聚（PMC）和奥斯特瓦尔德成核（OR）。通常将烧结过程分为三个阶段：活性迅速丧失、速度减慢以及催化剂可能达到稳定性能。近来，原位透射电子显微镜（TEM）技术的进步使得能够在实际操作条件下观察催化剂的行为成为可能。研究表明，在早期阶段，OR是导致快速烧结的主要原因，特征为最小颗粒的消失。随着催化剂的老化，烧结速度减慢，最大的颗粒开始通过凝聚事件增长。在后期阶段，催化剂可能会达到一个性能平台，受到高温下支撑结构重排等因素的影响。深入了解烧结机制可以帮助开发更耐用的催化剂，能够自我修复，并设计用于长期运行的催化剂。
