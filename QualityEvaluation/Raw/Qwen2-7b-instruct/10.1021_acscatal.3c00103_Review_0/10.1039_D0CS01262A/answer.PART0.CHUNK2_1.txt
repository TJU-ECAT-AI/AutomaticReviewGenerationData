[1] "The advantage of this approach is that overoxidation of the reactants and products can be reduced and therefore the olefin selectivity can be enhanced."
[2] "The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."
[3] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."

To address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer a promising solution. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, suffer from inefficiencies and environmental concerns. PDH allows for the production of propylene from propane at lower temperatures, avoiding the formation of coke and other byproducts. This makes it thermodynamically favorable even at low temperatures, thus reducing energy requirements and enhancing sustainability.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These strategies focus on modifying the electronic and geometric properties of catalysts. For instance, the introduction of dopants like tin, titanium, gallium, copper, cobalt, zinc, iridium, and indium can improve catalyst selectivity by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing deep dehydrogenation reactions. The use of core-shell Pt-based catalysts, near-surface alloys (NSAs), and specific support materials like graphene oxide can also tune the catalytic properties.

For oxidative PDH, catalysts like supported vanadium oxides are known for their high thermal stability and large surface area. The MVK redox mechanism, involving lattice oxygen, is particularly effective. By carefully engineering the surface properties, such as modifying the oxygen activity and reducing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, catalysts can be optimized for enhanced selectivity and stability.

For nonoxidative PDH, the use of supported metal oxides, like vanadium oxide, is common. The active sites on these catalysts, such as terminal oxygen sites, are crucial for the activation of the CH bond in propane. The support material and dispersion of the metal oxide play significant roles in modifying the electronic properties of the oxygen sites, thereby affecting their activity in activating the CH bond.

In summary, by leveraging advanced catalyst design strategies, PDH processes can be tailored to efficiently produce propylene with high selectivity, stability, and recyclability. These advancements are crucial for meeting the growing demand for propylene while minimizing environmental impacts.

为了应对丙烯需求的增长和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术提供了有前景的解决方案。传统的生产方式，如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解，存在效率低下和环境问题。而PDH则允许在较低温度下从丙烷生产丙烯，避免形成焦炭和其他副产品。这使得PDH即使在低温下也具有热动力学优势，从而减少了能源需求并提高了可持续性。

为了克服催化剂失活、增强稳定性并提高可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略侧重于修改催化剂的电子和几何特性。例如，通过引入锡、钛、镓、铜、钴、锌、铱和铟等掺杂剂，可以改善催化剂的选择性，减弱丙烯的吸附并抑制深度脱氢反应。使用Pt基核心壳催化剂、近表面合金（NSAs）和特定支撑材料如石墨烯氧化物也可以调节催化性能。

对于氧化PDH，像支持的钒氧化物这样的催化剂因其高热稳定性和大表面积而知名。MVK还原机制，涉及晶格氧，特别有效。通过精心工程化表面性质，如调整氧活性和减少氧空位的形成能，可以优化催化剂以提高选择性和稳定性。

对于非氧化PDH，使用支持的金属氧化物，如钒氧化物，是常见的做法。催化剂上的活性位点，如单键氧位点，对于丙烷中CH键的激活至关重要。支撑材料和金属氧化物的分散对修改氧位点的电子性质具有重要影响，从而影响其在激活CH键时的活性。

总之，通过利用先进的催化剂设计策略，PDH过程可以根据高效生产丙烯、高选择性、稳定性和可回收性的需求进行定制。这些进步对于满足不断增长的丙烯需求并最小化环境影响至关重要。
