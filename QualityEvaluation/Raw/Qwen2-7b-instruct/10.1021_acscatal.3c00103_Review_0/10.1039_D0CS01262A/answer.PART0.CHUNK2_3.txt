[1] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."
[2] "However, side reactions, such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation, can be promoted even more dramatically by the increase in temperature."
[3] "The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."
[4] "The addition of one or more main-group metals or TMs, such as Sn, In, Cu, and Ga, is also an effective way to reduce the tendency to form coke."
[5] "Near-surface alloys (NSAs) having a host metal (such as Pt) as the subsurface and solute metals as the overlayer exhibit unique chemical and physical properties distinct from those of their constituent metals."

To address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer an alternative route. These methods tackle the challenges by providing a more efficient and environmentally friendly method to produce propylene. Innovations in catalyst design aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Strategies include the use of near-surface alloys (NSAs) that possess unique chemical and physical properties, the addition of one or more main-group metals or transition metals (TMs) like tin (Sn), indium (In), copper (Cu), and gallium (Ga) to reduce the formation of coke, and optimizing the electronic structure of metal oxides to change the activity of oxygen sites in activating the CH bond of propane. These advancements aim to reduce byproduct formation, maintain catalytic stability, and extend the operational life of catalysts, thereby improving the efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes.

为了应对丙烯需求的大幅增长以及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术提供了一种替代方案。这些方法通过提供更高效且环保的方法来生产丙烯来解决这些挑战。在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中，通过优化催化剂设计来克服失活问题、提高稳定性并改善可回收性。策略包括使用近表面合金（NSAs），这些合金具有其组成金属所不具备的独特化学和物理性质；添加主族金属或过渡金属（TM）如锡（Sn）、铟（In）、铜（Cu）和镓（Ga）以减少焦炭形成；以及优化金属氧化物的电子结构，改变氧原子在激活丙烷中的活性。这些进步旨在减少副产品的形成、保持催化剂的稳定性，并延长催化剂的使用寿命，从而提高PDH过程的效率和可持续性。
