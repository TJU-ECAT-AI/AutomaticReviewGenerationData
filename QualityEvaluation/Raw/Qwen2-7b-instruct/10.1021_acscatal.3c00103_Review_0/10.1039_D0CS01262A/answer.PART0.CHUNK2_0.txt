[1] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."
[2] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330"
[3] "However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity."
[4] "The nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."
[5] "This is due to the weakened binding strength of propylene and the higher energy barrier for deep dehydrogenation on Pt(111)."
[6] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
[7] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
[8] "This provides a guideline for design of PDH catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance."
[9] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
[10] "The adsorption strength of the intermediates is the key parameter in tuning the activity and selectivity."
[11] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
[12] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
