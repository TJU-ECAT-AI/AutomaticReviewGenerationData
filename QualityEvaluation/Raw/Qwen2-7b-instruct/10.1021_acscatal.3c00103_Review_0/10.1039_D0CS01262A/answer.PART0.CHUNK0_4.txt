The document discusses how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges posed by the increasing demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods. PDH processes are innovative because they enable the conversion of propane into propylene, a key intermediate in the petrochemical industry. The document also explores the development of catalyst design strategies aimed at overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

The main target of the review is to provide fundamental insights into the CH bond activation of light alkanes, particularly methane, ethane, and propane. This knowledge can guide the optimization of catalysts for future research. Despite the success of current catalyst applications, several key questions remain unanswered, including the identification of effective active sites, detailed reaction mechanisms, rate-determining steps, and factors influencing selectivity and carbon formation during activation and conversion processes.

To improve the efficiency of catalyst systems for selective CH activation, a better understanding of the underlying factors is crucial. The review covers the direct and oxidative activation of CH bonds in methane, detailing the mechanistic insights derived from density functional theory (DFT) and microkinetic analysis. It emphasizes the importance of considering factors like metal/oxide surfaces, nanoparticle size, and the interplay between steam and dry reforming in optimizing catalyst performance for PDH processes.

The document outlines the objectives of the review, which is to summarize recent advancements in computational catalysis that pertain to the activation of CH bonds in light alkanes. It focuses on the role of heterogeneous transition metals, oxides, and metal/oxide catalysts in achieving high activity, selectivity, and coke formation resistance in the conversion of light alkanes.
