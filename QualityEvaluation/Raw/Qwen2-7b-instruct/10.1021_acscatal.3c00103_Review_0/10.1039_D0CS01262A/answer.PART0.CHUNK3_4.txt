In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by converting propane into propylene, a more valuable chemical feedstock, through a series of chemical reactions. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These strategies focus on optimizing the composition and structure of the catalysts, particularly by adjusting the ratio of terminal vanadium (VO) sites to other oxygen sites on the surface of vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts. By balancing the cluster size, researchers aim to achieve a compromise between high activity and selectivity, with sub-monolayer VOx catalysts showing potential for high propylene yields.

To improve the selectivity towards propylene, alkali metal additives are used to block active centers on the catalyst surface, inhibiting unwanted side reactions such as consecutive propylene and parallel propane combustion. Additionally, studies indicate that hydroxyl (OH) groups on the supported VOx catalysts can lead to lower PDH activity and less coke formation, contributing to the development of more efficient catalysts. Furthermore, the introduction of oxidants like carbon dioxide can re-activate deposed redox catalysts, potentially overcoming issues of over-oxidation and low propylene selectivity.

Innovative catalyst designs, such as single-atom catalysts (SACs) anchored on metal oxides, offer new opportunities for enhancing catalytic performance. These SACs exhibit distinct properties from supported nanoclusters, allowing for a better understanding of the structure-reactivity relationship. By trapping single atoms or units like platinum (Pt) or platinum oxide (PtO2) on supports like iron oxide (Fe2O3) through strong metal-support interactions (SMSI), researchers create catalysts that can be selectively used for PDH while maintaining stability and activity.

Another strategy involves the use of metal oxide interfaces and locally coordinated oxygen, which significantly modifies the electronic properties of active sites and their relation to the catalytic performance of alkane conversion. Computational models predict that certain single-atom-doped zirconium oxide catalysts can exhibit higher activity than pristine zirconium oxide surfaces, offering new opportunities for developing more cost-effective heterogeneous catalysts.

Overall, these advancements in catalyst design are aimed at achieving a balance between high activity, selectivity, and stability, while also reducing the risk of coking and enhancing recyclability. The integration of computational catalysis, including density functional theory (DFT), scaling relationships, and descriptor-based microkinetic modeling, enables a more detailed and accurate description of catalytic reactions at surfaces, facilitating the design of catalysts that can effectively convert light alkanes to valuable products like propylene, in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

在丙烷工业需求增长和传统生产方法限制的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过一系列化学反应将丙烷转化为更宝贵的化学品原料丙烯，以解决这些挑战。为了克服催化剂失活、提高稳定性和增强可循环利用性的问题，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略集中在优化催化剂组成和结构上，特别是通过调整范德华氧化物（VOx）催化剂表面的终端钒（VO）位点与其他氧位点的比例。通过平衡簇大小，研究人员旨在实现活动性和选择性的折衷，其中亚单层VOx催化剂显示出高丙烯产量的潜力。

为了提高向丙烯的选择性，正在使用碱金属添加剂来阻塞催化剂表面的活性中心，从而抑制连续丙烯和平行丙烷燃烧等不希望的副反应。此外，研究表明，支持在VOx催化剂上的羟基（OH）组分可以降低PDH活性并减少焦炭形成，从而有助于开发更高效的催化剂。此外，引入如二氧化碳这样的氧化剂可以重新激活由于金属氧化物还原而失效的红氧催化剂，可能克服过氧化和丙烯选择性低的问题。

创新的催化剂设计，如单原子催化剂（SACs）锚定在金属氧化物上，为提高催化性能提供了新的机会。这些SACs在活性中心的性质上与支持纳米团簇显着不同，这为理解结构-活性关系提供了机会。通过在铁氧化物（Fe2O3）等支持材料上通过强金属-支持相互作用（SMSI）捕获孤立的铂（Pt）原子或铂氧化物（PtO2），研究人员创建了可以在PDH中选择性使用的同时保持稳定性和活性的催化剂。

另一项策略涉及金属氧化物界面和局部配位氧的使用，这些氧显著改变了活性位点的电子性质，并与烷烃转换的催化性能有关。计算模型预测，某些掺杂的锆氧化物催化剂比纯锆氧化物表面具有更高的活性，为开发更经济的异质催化剂提供了新机遇。

总的来说，这些催化剂设计的进步旨在实现活动性、选择性和稳定性的平衡，同时降低结焦风险并增强可循环利用性。集成计算催化，包括密度泛函理论（DFT）、比例关系和描述符微动力学建模，使表面反应的详细和准确描述成为可能，从而促进了能够有效将轻烷烃转化为有价值产品（如丙烯）的催化剂的设计，在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中。
