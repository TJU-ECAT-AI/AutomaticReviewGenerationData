[1] "Dependence of activity and selectivity on the cluster size and valence state"
[2] "Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane: the initial ODH dominant period leading to propylene, water and CO2 formation and the non-ODH dominant period (see Fig. 36d)."
[3] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported VOx, the VO mainly contributes to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and deep oxidation to CO2 in the ODH dominant period."
[4] "With the consumption of the VO during the reaction, the AlOV sites become dominating active sites for propylene formation."
[5] "The cluster size needs to be compromised between the activity and selectivity, and sub-monolayer VOx could provide a high propylene yield, which has been very recently confirmed experimentally by Gong and coworkers."
[6] "Propane conversion and the propylene yield could be described by a kinetic model including propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion."
[7] "The dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers."
[8] "On V2O5 powders and supported VOx, the dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers."
[9] "The formation energy of oxygen vacancy or hydrogen affinity was identified as the descriptor to describe the oxygen activity."
[10] "The lattice oxygen is the main active site. It significantly adds complexity in DFT modeling, where the activity of oxygen depends on the local structure and coordination as well as oxygen vacancy."
[11] "The alloy of Pt with a second metal and a coreshell structure is an effective way to lower the ethylene and propylene desorption energy and increase the olefin selectivity and lower the coking potential, but at the expense of lower activity."
[12] "The single metal or metal clusters on oxides could be explored to break down the constrained relation to enhance the catalytic performance."
[13] "The active sites are highly dynamic on oxides due to their redox nature, with generation and filling of the oxygen vacancy."
[14] "Better scaling relationships for adsorption energy and activation energy on oxides need to be explored based on a big dataset."
[15] "Machine learning and artificial intelligence could be explored to significantly accelerate catalyst development."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by efficiently converting propane into propylene, a key intermediate in the petrochemical industry. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. Key aspects of these strategies include:

1. **Optimizing Cluster Size and Valence State**: Researchers focus on the balance between cluster size and valence state to achieve optimal activity and selectivity for propylene production. For instance, small clusters with a low ratio of terminal VO sites can increase propylene selectivity but might compromise activity, whereas larger clusters or polymeric VOx with a higher VO ratio could lower propylene selectivity. Sub-monolayer VOx has been shown to provide a high propylene yield, as confirmed by Gong and coworkers' experimental evidence.

2. **Kinetic Modeling**: A kinetic model encompassing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion helps describe the conversion process and propylene yield. This model takes into account the dependencies of reaction rates on propane concentration, oxygen, and water vapor pressures, providing insights into the efficiency of the conversion.

3. **Uniform Active Sites**: Studies reveal that both surfaces of V2O5 powders and supported VOx have identical dependencies on propane, oxygen, and water vapor concentrations, indicating that they share similar active centers. This finding supports the development of catalysts with uniform active sites that can maintain consistent performance under varying reaction conditions.

4. **Modulating Oxygen Activity**: Researchers investigate the role of oxygen vacancy or hydrogen affinity as descriptors for oxygen activity, crucial for controlling the catalytic process. Understanding the local structure and coordination of oxygen, along with the oxygen vacancy, aids in fine-tuning the oxygen activity to reduce unwanted side reactions and improve selectivity.

5. **Advanced Catalyst Structures**: Innovative catalyst designs, such as alloys containing platinum with another metal or core-shell structures, aim to reduce the desorption energy of ethylene and propylene while increasing olefin selectivity and reducing coking potential. These materials, however, might come with a trade-off in activity.

6. **Dynamic Active Sites and Redox Nature**: The redox nature of oxide catalysts introduces dynamic active sites that can change over time, influenced by the generation and filling of oxygen vacancies. Modeling these dynamic sites requires sophisticated computational approaches to capture the evolving nature of the active surfaces during the catalytic process.

7. **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**: Advanced computational tools, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, are being employed to accelerate the development of new catalysts. These technologies help in predicting catalyst performance, optimizing design parameters, and identifying promising catalyst candidates with high efficiency and stability.

These strategies leverage the latest advancements in materials science, catalysis, and computational chemistry to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and economic viability of propylene production through PDH, addressing the growing industrial demand while minimizing environmental impact.

在丙烯需求增长和传统生产方法限制的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯来应对这些挑战。为了克服催化剂失活、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略的关键方面包括：

1. **优化簇大小和电荷状态**：研究人员专注于在活性和选择性之间平衡簇大小和电荷状态，以实现最佳的丙烯生产。例如，具有较低终端VO比例的小簇可以增加丙烯的选择性，但可能牺牲活性；而较大的簇或聚合的VOx具有更高的VO比例则可能会降低丙烯的选择性。Gong和同事的实验证据证实了亚单层VOx能够提供高丙烯产率。

2. **动力学建模**：包含丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）、并行丙烷燃烧和顺序丙烯燃烧的动力学模型有助于描述转化过程和丙烯产量。该模型考虑了丙烷浓度、氧气和水蒸气压力对反应速率的影响，为理解转化效率提供了洞见。

3. **均匀活性位点**：研究表明，V2O5粉末和支持的VOx表面在丙烷、氧气和水蒸气浓度上的依赖性相同，表明它们共享相似的活性中心。这一发现支持了开发具有均匀活性位点的催化剂，这些位点可以在不同条件下保持一致性能。

4. **调控氧活性**：研究者探索氧空位或氢亲和力作为描述氧活性的指标，对于控制催化过程至关重要。理解氧的局部结构和配位，以及氧空位，有助于精确调整氧活性，减少副反应并提高选择性。

5. **高级催化剂结构**：含有铂与其他金属的合金或核心壳结构等创新催化剂设计旨在降低乙烷和丙烷的脱附能，同时提高烯烃选择性和降低结焦倾向，尽管这可能牺牲活性。

6. **动态活性位点和还原性质**：氧化物催化剂的还原性质引入了动态活性位点，这些位点会随时间变化，受氧空位的生成和填充影响。捕捉这些活性表面在催化过程中不断演变的特性需要高度复杂的计算方法。

7. **机器学习和人工智能**：先进的计算工具，包括机器学习和人工智能，正在用于加速新催化剂的发展。这些技术有助于预测催化剂性能、优化设计参数，并识别具有高效率和稳定性的有前景的催化剂候选者。

这些策略利用材料科学、催化和计算化学的最新进展，通过提高效率、可持续性和经济可行性，改进PDH生产丙烯，以满足日益增长的工业需求，同时减少环境影响。
