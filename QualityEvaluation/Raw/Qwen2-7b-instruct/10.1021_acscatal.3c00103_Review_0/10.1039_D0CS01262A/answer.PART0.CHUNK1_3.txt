[1] "In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, how do propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges, and what innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes?"

PDH techniques address the growing industrial demand for propylene by offering a more efficient and flexible production method compared to traditional processes. These techniques aim to convert propane into propylene through dehydrogenation. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the use of bimetallic catalysts, such as Ni-based catalysts, and supports like CeO2 can improve the activity and carbon formation resistance for DRM. Additionally, the development of single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts and the incorporation of promoters like La2O3 can further optimize the catalytic performance. These strategies aim to reduce catalyst deactivation, increase stability, and enhance the recyclability of the catalysts, thereby making PDH processes more sustainable and economically viable.

在丙烯日益增长的工业需求和传统生产方法限制的背景下，PDH技术通过提供比传统过程更高效和灵活的生产方式来应对这些挑战。这些技术旨在将丙烷转化为丙烯通过脱氢。创新的催化剂设计策略集中在克服失活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性上，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中。例如，使用双金属催化剂，如基于镍的催化剂，以及支持如CeO2可以改善DRM的活性和碳形成抵抗力。此外，单原子合金（SAA）催化剂和促进剂La2O3的开发可以进一步优化催化性能。这些策略旨在减少催化剂失活、增加稳定性并提高催化剂的可回收性，从而使PDH过程更加可持续和经济可行。
