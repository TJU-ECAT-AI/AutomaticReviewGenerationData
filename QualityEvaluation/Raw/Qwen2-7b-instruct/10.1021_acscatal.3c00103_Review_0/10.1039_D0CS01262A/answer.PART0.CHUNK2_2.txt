[1] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."
[2] "The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."
[3] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
[4] "This is also reflected in more negative Bader charges of oxygen sites on the (100) than (001) surfaces. This indicates that the oxygen sites are the nucleophilic centers to attack the positively charged H atoms and activate the CH bond."
[5] "The oxygen activity in VOx seems to be of vital importance for CH bond activation."
[6] "The formation energy of surface oxygen vacancy can be identified as a dominant parameter in determining the adsorption mode and the catalytic activity of metal oxides."

To address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer a promising alternative. Innovations in catalyst design aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. Strategies include modifying catalyst structures and electronic properties to optimize CH bond activation, reducing the formation of coke, and utilizing supports that lower the formation energy of oxygen vacancies to boost activity. These advancements aim to improve propylene selectivity, reduce byproduct formation, and extend catalyst life.

Innovative catalyst design strategies for PDH processes focus on:
1. Optimizing CH bond activation by modifying catalyst structures to enhance nucleophilic attack on positively charged H atoms, improving the selectivity for propylene formation.
2. Reducing coke formation by adjusting catalyst properties to lower the rate of coke deposition, particularly on surfaces with higher coking rates due to larger surface areas.
3. Enhancing catalyst stability through modifications that reduce the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for adsorption and catalytic activity, thereby maintaining efficient propylene production over longer periods.

These strategies collectively aim to make PDH processes more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable, addressing the growing demand for propylene in various industries.

为了应对丙烯需求增长以及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术提供了一种有前景的替代方案。催化剂设计创新旨在克服催化剂失活问题、提高稳定性并增强可回收性。策略包括修改催化剂结构和电子性质以优化碳氢键激活、减少焦炭形成，并利用能够降低表面氧空位形成能的支持体来提升活性。这些改进旨在提高丙烯选择性、减少副产品的生成，并延长催化剂使用寿命。

PDH过程的催化剂设计创新重点在于：
1. 通过修改催化剂结构来优化核进攻性，改善对正电荷氢原子的亲核攻击，从而提高丙烯形成的专一性。
2. 通过调整催化剂特性来减少焦炭形成，特别是针对由于表面面积较大而导致更高焦炭形成率的表面。
3. 通过修改来增强催化剂稳定性，降低氧空位的形成，后者对于吸附和催化活性至关重要，从而保持高效的丙烯生产更长时间。

这些策略共同目标是使PDH过程更加高效、可持续且经济可行，以满足各个行业不断增长的丙烯需求。
