[1] "The only feedstock that can achieve high selectivity to olefins is ethane because ethylene is sufficiently unreactive towards oxygen compared to ethane."
[2] "This is true for ethane and ethylene, but not for propane and propylene."
[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation, which couples the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the strongly exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, exhibits higher ethane conversion and lower operation temperature compared to steam cracking, which leads to growing interest in this process."
[4] "However, major practical challenges with ODH reaction still occur, which are (1) additional safety measures associated with O2 in the feed and (2) the development of highly active and selective catalysts due to the high reactivity of olefins compared with the corresponding paraffins."

These quotes provide insights into the challenges and advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane. The first quote highlights that ethane is uniquely suited for achieving high selectivity in the formation of olefins, unlike propane and propylene, due to ethylene's lower reactivity with oxygen. This specificity is crucial for the selective production of olefins. The second quote emphasizes that while ODH offers higher ethane conversion and lower operational temperatures compared to steam cracking, it faces significant challenges. These include the necessity for additional safety measures related to the presence of oxygen in the feedstock and the requirement for catalysts that can efficiently and selectively convert ethane into olefins, considering the high reactivity of olefins compared to paraffins. These challenges underscore the ongoing research and development efforts aimed at overcoming the practical hurdles of ODH technology to make it a viable and efficient process for olefin production.

这些引文提供了有关乙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的挑战和进展的见解。第一句提到，由于乙烯与乙烷相比反应性较低，因此只有乙烷能够实现高选择性地形成烯烃，这与丙烷和丙烯不同。这种特异性对于选择性生产烯烃至关重要。第二句强调，尽管与蒸汽裂解相比，ODH具有更高的乙烷转化率和更低的操作温度，但其仍面临重大实践挑战。这些包括氧气在原料中需要额外的安全措施以及需要高效且选择性地将乙烷转化为烯烃的催化剂，考虑到烯烃与烷烃相比的高反应性。这些挑战凸显了正在进行的研究和发展工作，旨在克服ODH技术的实践障碍，使其成为一个可行且高效的烯烃生产过程。
