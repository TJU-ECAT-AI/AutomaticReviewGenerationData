<p>Moreover, the supply of certain chemicals such as propylene, butadiene, and BTX has become constrained. Their shortage in the market is the main driving force for the renewed interest in producing them from alkanes, as low-cost feedstocks for chemical production.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation is one of the major routes to fill the lower olefin gap in terms of future production and demands.</p>
<p>A better understanding of the factors governing the fundamental aspects mentioned above is important to design more efficient catalyst systems to promote selective CH activation.</p>
<p>That is, based on the DFT calculated energetics, the scaling relationships are obtained and used to predict the energetics of other adsorbates or on other catalyst surfaces, which are further employed as input parameters of the microkinetic model.</p>
<p>The results of the mechanistic studies depend on temperature, pressure, and reactant composition.</p>
<p>It unravels the basic electronic features of the CH cleavage process to the targeted products.</p>
<p>Finally, the design of new catalysts and improvement of the catalysts are reviewed and proposed based on the fundamental understanding and theory-driven catalyst design.</p>
<p>Moreover, the oxide is one of the crucial types of catalysts to promote methane conversion.</p>
<p>The promotional effects of O* and OH* in activating CH bonds on the group 11 metals were related to the MO/MOH binding energy and their basicity when binding with metal.</p>
<p>As such, enhanced promotional effects were observed on the group 11 metal surfaces by O*/OH* over direct metal activation due to their weak MO/MOH bonding.</p>
<p>Moreover, the O* and OH* are more negatively charged when binding with the group 11 metals, thus increasing their basicity and ability to promote CH activation.</p>
<p>However, taking the coverage effect of OH* into account could reasonably lead to the direct CH4 dissociation route being dominant.</p>
<p>For instance, the geometries of the transition states (TSs) for CH4 dehydrogenation on close-packed Ni(111) and stepped Ni(211) surfaces are shown in Fig. 2(a and b), with the corresponding activation energies listed.</p>
<p>The high barrier of CH  C + H results mainly from the stability of CH* (electronic effect) coupled with the perpendicular nature of CH* (geometrical effect).</p>
<p>The Ni(211) surface exhibits lower activation energies than the Ni(111) surface due to the existence of under-coordinated atoms on the stepped (211) surface, leading to higher binding strengths of surface intermediates and more stabilization of transition states and final states.</p>
<p>This underlines the theory that the binding energy of an adsorbate to a metal surface is strongly dependent on the electronic structure of the surface itself.</p>
<p>The TS energy is linearly correlated with H binding energy.</p>
<p>In addition, all materials they explored that occurred through the surface-stabilized pathway seem to follow the TS scaling relationship which is linearly related to the final state energy.</p>
<p>However, regardless of the transition states, the nucleophilic surface oxygen attacks the electrophilic H in the CH bond to form an OH bond in CH bond activation.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrated that these scaling relations were valid for several reducible and irreducible oxides, sulfides, and promoted metals.</p>
<p>This suggested that at weak H binding strength, the reaction was limited by CH bond activation.</p>
<p>Both the CHO route and CO route were considered by Zhu et al.93 on a Ni(111) surface.</p>
<p>On each model termination, one possible lattice O site exists for catalysis.</p>
<p>The typical geometries of CH activation transition states over the perovskite(001) surface A and B terminations can be found in the lower part of Fig. 5(a).</p>
<p>The stronger the hydrogen adsorption on the lattice O or the easier the O vacancy formation at the lattice-O site, the lower the CH activation barrier of methane.</p>
<p>The study also demonstrated that stabilizing Ni catalysts with particle sizes 6 nm (Fig. 10b) could be a good strategy to achieve high activity for SRM reaction.</p>
<p>The modeling well reproduced the size-dependent activity observed from the kinetic study, namely lower activity on larger sized Ni particles (Fig. 10b).</p>
<p>The TOFs were observed to be inversely proportional to particle size and linearly related to dispersion, in good agreement with reported experimental results.</p>
<p>Although Rh exhibits very high activity, other noble metals such as Ru, Pt, Pd, and Ir are also active for SRM, but these metals are usually too expensive to be applied in conventional industrial reformers.</p>
<p>Several types of carbon have been reported on the catalysts towards methane reforming and decomposition,150 with atomic carbon, encapsulating carbon, and filamentous carbon being the most important.</p>
<p>It was suggested that the formation of monolayer encapsulating carbon blocked the active sites and hence deactivated the methane reforming, the filamentous carbon formation and the encapsulating carbon formation itself.</p>
<p>The C* site coverage is an important parameter to characterize carbon formation.</p>
<p>This explains why very small particles cannot grow filamentous carbon under normal conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, Eizenberg and Blakely observed the formation of monolayer graphene on a Ni(100) surface in experiments.156,157</p>
<p>Therefore, for large-scale hydrogen production through SRM, the pressure is above 10 bar.</p>
<p>Ni-based bimetallic catalysts by alloying Ni (the active metal) with another metal (e.g. Au,160 Ru,161 Rh,55 Co,162 Pt,163,164 Ag,165 and Sn166) are generally used to reduce methane dissociation and enhance the surface reaction of carbon removal, which could effectively increase catalyst resistance to deactivation and improve catalyst stability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the DFT-calculated C adsorption energies on Pt/Ni(111), Pd/Ni(111), Au/Ni(111), and Rh/Ni(111) were less negative than that on Ni(111), indicating that coke formation was suppressed to a certain extent on these bimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>The NiRh bimetallic catalyst was therefore suggested as a good candidate for methane dissociation due to improvement in both activity and stability, which has been verified by experimental observations.168,169</p>
<p>The addition of Ag into Ni catalysts reduced the catalytic activity towards SRM but enhanced coke formation resistance.</p>
<p>Liu et al.171 reported that segregated NiCu was a good SRM catalyst to suppress coke formation, which displayed the highest carbon deposition resistance among Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, NiFe, NiCo, NiCu, and segregated NiCu catalysts via DFT study.</p>
<p>NiRu, and NiPt alloys are promising bimetallic catalysts to effectively increase catalyst resistance to carbon deposition without sacrificing much activity or even with enhanced activity for SRM reaction.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting abundant and low-cost propane feedstocks into propylene and other value-added products. Innovations in catalyst design aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Catalysts are optimized for efficient and selective activation of CH bonds in propane, leading to the production of propylene and other high-value products.

2. In the context of PDH, theoretical approaches such as density functional theory (DFT) and microkinetic modeling are utilized to understand the mechanisms of CH bond activation, selectivity, and deactivation processes. These methodologies provide insights into the electronic features of the activation process, predict reaction energetics, and guide the design of catalysts with improved performance. The integration of DFT with microkinetic modeling allows for the prediction of reaction pathways, rate-determining steps, and the optimization of catalysts to ensure high activity, selectivity, and stability under various operating conditions. This theoretical framework is essential for advancing PDH technologies and achieving more efficient and sustainable chemical production processes.
