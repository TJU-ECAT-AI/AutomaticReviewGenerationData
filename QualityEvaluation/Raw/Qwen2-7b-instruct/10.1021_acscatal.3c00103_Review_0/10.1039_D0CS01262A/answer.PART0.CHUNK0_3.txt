[1] "Despite their successful applications at an industrial scale, several central questions remain unanswered, such as active sites effectively activating CH bonds, the detailed reaction mechanism of catalytic cycles, rate-determining steps (RDSs), and factors governing the selectivity and carbon formation in activation and conversion processes of methane and light alkanes."
[2] "The global demand for light alkenes has increased due to the increasing demand of their corresponding polymers. The light olefin market across the globe is expected to reach USD 475.8 million at a compound annual growth rate of 5.85% by the end of 2027. Besides, with a shift of the feedstock from naphtha to natural gas feedstocks, the supply of certain chemicals such as propylene, butadiene, and BTX has become constrained."
[3] "Catalyst improvements Carbon formation on Ni-based catalysts is the main obstacle to the commercialization of DRM.140 To investigate the carbon formation scheme on Ni-based catalysts, Wang et al.140 compared the whole reaction network of DRM over flat Ni(111) and step Ni(211) surfaces, as well as flat Ni3C(001) and step Ni3C(111) by DFT calculations."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing demand for propylene by efficiently converting propane into propylene, overcoming the limitations of traditional production methods that often require expensive and energy-intensive processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies aim to create catalysts with optimized active sites, improved selectivity, and better resistance to deactivation and coking.

2. The demand for propylene and its derivatives, such as polypropylene, has surged globally, leading to a significant growth in the light olefin market. By 2027, the market for light olefins, including propylene, is forecasted to reach USD 475.8 million at a compound annual growth rate of 5.85%. This growth is partly attributed to the shift from naphtha to natural gas feedstocks, which has led to constraints in the supply of certain chemicals like propylene, butadiene, and BTX.

3. In addressing the challenges of propane dehydrogenation, researchers have focused on understanding the reaction networks and mechanisms, particularly in the context of Ni-based catalysts. Wang et al. have compared the performance of different surfaces, such as flat Ni(111) and step Ni(211), and Ni3C surfaces, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This comparative analysis helps in identifying the most effective surface configurations for enhancing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process, thereby contributing to the development of more robust and selective catalysts.

1. 烯烃裂解（PDH）技术通过高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，解决了对丙烯日益增长的需求，克服了传统生产方法中成本高和能耗大的问题。在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中，创新的催化剂设计策略正在开发中，以解决活性衰减、提高稳定性和改善可回收性的问题。这些策略旨在创建具有优化活性位点、改进选择性和更好的抗衰减和结焦能力的催化剂。

2. 对于丙烯及其衍生物如聚丙烯的需求在全球范围内急剧增加，推动了轻质烯烃市场的增长。到2027年，轻质烯烃市场（包括丙烯）的规模预计将达到47.58亿美元，复合年增长率预计为5.85%。这一增长部分归因于从石脑油转向天然气作为原料的转变，这导致了丙烯、丁二烯和BTX等某些化学品供应的限制。

3. 在应对PDH挑战的过程中，研究人员已经专注于理解反应网络和机制，特别是在镍基催化剂的背景下。王等人比较了不同表面（如平滑的Ni（111）和阶梯状的Ni（211），以及Ni3C表面）的性能，使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。这种对比分析有助于确定提高裂解过程效率的最佳表面配置，从而促进更坚固、更选择性的催化剂的发展。
