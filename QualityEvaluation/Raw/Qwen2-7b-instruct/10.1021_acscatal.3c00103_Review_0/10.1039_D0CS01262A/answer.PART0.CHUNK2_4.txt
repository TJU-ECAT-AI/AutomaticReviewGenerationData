To address the growing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer a promising solution. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, face issues with unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability. PDH, particularly oxidative PDH, avoids the formation of coke and can operate at lower temperatures compared to direct dehydrogenation. Catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

1. Innovative catalyst design strategies include modifying the geometrical and electronic structures of catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of platinum nanoparticles, alloying platinum with transition metals or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. For instance, increasing the cluster size of vanadium oxide on titanium dioxide supports can lead to higher propylene selectivity and better stability.

2. Alloying platinum with tin (Sn) can shift the d-band center of surface platinum atoms further below the Fermi level, weakening the binding strength of propylene and increasing the energy barrier for deep dehydrogenation, thereby enhancing propylene selectivity.

3. The introduction of gallium (Ga) as a promoter on platinum/ceria-alumina catalysts can decorate platinum nanoparticles, block low-coordinated defect active sites, and enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility, leading to improved catalyst stability and propylene selectivity.

4. Selecting suitable catalyst supports, such as titanium dioxide, can modify the electronic properties of the oxygen sites, changing their activity in activating the CH bond of propane. This is achieved by altering the formation energy of oxygen vacancy, which serves as a descriptor for the adsorption behavior and catalytic activity of metal oxides.

5. The formation energy of oxygen vacancy correlates with the activity of lattice oxygen in metal oxides. Lower formation energy corresponds to higher oxygen activity, facilitating more efficient adsorption and catalytic reactions. This understanding can guide the search for new catalysts with optimized properties for PDH.

为了应对丙烯需求的增长以及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术提供了一个有前景的解决方案。传统的生产方式，如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解，面临丙烯选择性差、催化剂快速失活和稳定性不佳的问题。PDH，特别是氧化性PDH，可以在较低温度下运行，避免了形成焦炭，相比直接脱氢更有优势。催化剂设计策略旨在克服催化剂失活问题，提高稳定性和循环利用性，同时在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中都适用。

1. 创新的催化剂设计策略包括修改催化剂的几何结构和电子性质，如控制铂纳米颗粒的大小和形状、合金化铂与过渡金属或主族金属，以及选择合适的催化剂支撑物。例如，增加范德华氧化物在钛酸盐支撑上的簇集尺寸可以提高丙二醇选择性和稳定性。

2. 铂与锡（Sn）的合金化可以将表面铂原子的d带中心向下移动到费米能级以下，减弱丙烯的结合强度并增加进一步脱氢的能量壁垒，从而增强丙二醇选择性。

3. 在铂/氧化铈-氧化铝催化剂中添加镓（Ga）作为促进剂可以装饰铂纳米颗粒，阻止低协调缺陷活性位点，并增强氧存储能力和表面氧流动性，从而提高催化剂稳定性与丙二醇选择性。

4. 选择适当的支撑物，如二氧化钛，可以修改氧位的电子性质，改变它们激活丙烷中的CH键的能力。这通过改变表面氧空位的形成能量来实现，该能量作为描述吸附行为和金属氧化物活性的参数。

5. 氧空位的形成能量与氧化态氧的活性相关联。较低的形成能量对应更高的氧活性，有利于更有效的吸附和催化反应。这种理解可以指导寻找具有优化特性的新催化剂，以优化PDH过程。
