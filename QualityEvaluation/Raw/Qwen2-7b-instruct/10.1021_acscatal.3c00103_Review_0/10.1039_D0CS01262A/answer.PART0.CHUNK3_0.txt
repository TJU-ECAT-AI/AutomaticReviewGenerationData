[1] "The selectivity of propylene remains a challenge in ODH of propane."
[2] "The ratio of the terminal VO to the other two oxygen sites is a key parameter in the catalyst design."
[3] "Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane."
[4] "Propane conversion and the propylene yield could be described by a kinetic model including propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion."
[5] "The dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers."
[6] "For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced."
[7] "However, the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations."
[8] "On V2O5 powders and supported VOx, the dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers."

[11] "These findings are in line with experimental and DFT studies by Liu et al. and Sattler et al.,333,456 which clearly showed that the addition of a trace amount of Pt could accelerate H2 desorption over ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts and affect the distribution of Ga3+, thereby leading to a higher activity than the pristine surfaces."

In response to the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are being developed to address these issues by focusing on enhancing catalyst design strategies. Innovations aim to overcome deactivation, improve stability, and boost recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Key strategies include:

1. Optimizing the ratio of terminal VO to other oxygen sites to tailor catalyst selectivity and activity.
2. Dividing the PDH process into distinct stages, particularly focusing on the roles of terminal VO sites and the impact of oxygen vacancy modifications on electronic structure.
3. Utilizing kinetic models to describe the conversion of propane into propylene, accounting for various reaction pathways such as oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
4. Ensuring identical dependencies of reaction rates on propane, oxygen, and water concentrations to optimize surface active center efficiency.
5. Reducing energy barriers for water elimination through the participation of oxygen molecules in the PDH reaction, facilitating more efficient propane activation.
6. Managing the complex interplay between different pressures of propane, oxygen, and water to maintain optimal catalytic performance.
7. Employing single-atom catalysts to achieve distinct properties from supported nanoclusters, offering potential improvements in selectivity and stability.
8. Leveraging the synergistic effects of metal additives, such as potassium, to inhibit unwanted combustion reactions and enhance propylene selectivity.
9. Enhancing the catalytic performance of molybdenum oxides by tailoring their active sites to mimic those of vanadium-based catalysts.
10. Exploiting the unique properties of single-atom oxides anchored on supports through strong metal-support interactions to create thermally stable catalysts.
11. Modifying the electronic structure of catalyst surfaces by incorporating trace amounts of precious metals like platinum, which can accelerate hydrogen desorption and influence the distribution of reactive species, thereby increasing overall catalytic activity.

These advancements in catalyst design are crucial for achieving high propylene yields, improved selectivity, and enhanced durability, ultimately supporting the sustainable and efficient production of propylene in industrial settings.
