1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by providing an efficient and selective pathway to produce propylene from propane. These techniques aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes through innovative catalyst design strategies.

2. The global demand for light alkenes, particularly propylene, is growing due to their use in the production of polymers. The market for light olefins, including propylene, is expected to reach USD 475.8 million by the end of 2027, growing at a compound annual rate of 5.85%.

3. Catalytic dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and favor high equilibrium conversion under conditions of high temperature and low alkane pressure.

4. Alkanes with alkyl chains longer than C8 are prone to cause severe coke formation, which can lead to deactivation and poisoning of the catalyst in dehydrogenation processes.

5. The rate-determining step (RDS) in the conversion of methane varies with temperature. As temperature increases, the RDS shifts from methane dissociation to carbon formation due to the entropy loss associated with methane.

6. Industry employs catalytic processes such as steam reforming, dry reforming, partial oxidation, and dehydrogenation to produce hydrogen and light alkenes like ethylene, propylene, and butylene from methane.

7. The presence of oxygen species (O* or OH*) on the catalyst surface can reduce the overall reaction rate by blocking active sites.

8. Industry uses catalytic processes like steam reforming, dry reforming, partial oxidation, and dehydrogenation to produce hydrogen and light alkenes from methane.

9. The aim of this review is to provide fundamental insights into the activation of CH bonds in light alkanes, offering guidance for optimizing catalysts in future research.
