[1] "The selectivity of propylene remains a challenge in ODH of propane."
[2] "A study of deep oxidation of propane to CO2 on V2O5(001)424 revealed that the terminal VO sites are the active sites for the formation of acetone from i-propoxide and the further combustion of acetone to CO2."
[3] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported VOx, the VO mainly contributes to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and deep oxidation to CO2 in the ODH dominant period."
[4] "Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane: the initial ODH dominant period leading to propylene, water and CO2 formation and the non-ODH dominant period."
[5] "Propane conversion and the propylene yield could be described by a kinetic model including propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion."
[6] "The activation energies of CO and CO2 formation from secondary propylene combustion are less than the activation energy for propylene formation on TiO2/SiO2-supported VOx catalysts, leading to the inverse conversion versus selectivity relationship."
[7] "It has been illustrated that the oxygen vacancy modified the electronic structure of active species and even change the reaction mechanism."
[8] "For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced."
[9] "However, the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations."
[10] "On V2O5 powders and supported VOx, the dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers."
[11] "Significant efforts have been devoted to improving the activity of the different O sites for propane ODH of the supported VOx catalyst."
[12] "Alkali metal additives have been found to improve the propylene selectivity for propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts; the effect is explained by a modification of the acid-base properties of the catalysts."
[13] "On VOx/SiO2 catalysts, the potassium additive by blocking active centers on the catalyst surface exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on the consecutive propylene and parallel propane combustion and has a lower influence on ethylene and ethane combustion."

[15] "Fu et al. reported that the initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides follows the same ODH mechanism as V-based catalysts in that lattice oxygens participate the CH activation."
[16] "On the Ga2O3(100) surface, it is difficult for the H atoms in the OH groups to form H2 or H2O."
[17] "The most feasible reaction pathway for the initial propane activation is H abstraction by the terminal MoO site and the CH activation for methylene is 0.20 eV more favorable than that for the methyl CH bond."
[18] "Propane ODH activation energies (1.031.31 eV) are higher than those for propylene combustion (0.530.67 eV), where the measured difference in activation energy (0.500.63 eV) between the both is larger than the difference in the weakest CH bond dissociation enthalpy between propane and propylene (0.42 eV)."
[19] "Chen et al. also reported that VOx catalysts are much more active than MoOx catalysts with similar H2 reduction rates."
[20] "Zhu et al. systematically studied the catalytic performance of PDH on Cr2O3, ZnO, V2O3, and Ga2O3."
[21] "There are oxygen vacancies that can exist on the ZnO surfaces, also implying that the reaction path of the ODH mechanism could occur in the initial reaction stage."
[22] "Atanga et al. proposed that CO2 as a mild oxidant for the ODH of propane can reactivate deactivated redox catalysts caused by metal oxide reduction, and the introduction of CO2 can also overcome the problems of over-oxidation and low propylene selectivity."

In response to the industrial demand for propylene, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are developed to address challenges such as increasing efficiency, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, particularly in oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Key strategies include:

1. **Improving Selectivity**: The terminal VO sites on V2O5 are found to be crucial for acetone formation, which is essential for propylene production. The study of different VO sites on γ-Al2O3 supports reveals the importance of oxygen vacancies in modifying the electronic structure and reaction mechanisms, leading to more efficient propylene formation.

2. **Dividing Reaction Phases**: Xiong and colleagues' findings indicate that the PDH process can be divided into distinct phases, highlighting the role of oxygen vacancies in altering the reaction pathways. This insight aids in optimizing the catalyst design for better selectivity and activity.

3. **Kinetic Modeling**: The PDH process can be described by a kinetic model that includes the primary ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion. Understanding these steps helps in predicting and controlling the yield of propylene.

4. **Activation Energy Optimization**: The study of activation energies for CO and CO2 formation versus propylene formation suggests the importance of catalyst design to optimize the energy barriers for these reactions. This knowledge guides the development of catalysts with improved efficiency.

5. **Alkali Metal Additives**: The use of alkali metals like potassium improves propylene selectivity by blocking active sites, influencing the combustion pathways and reducing unwanted byproducts.

6. **OH Group Effects**: Research indicates that hydroxyl (OH) groups on supported VOx catalysts can lead to lower PDH activity and less coke formation, suggesting the importance of OH group management in catalyst design.

7. **Metal Oxide Catalysts**: Studies on molybdenum oxides, gallium oxides, and chromium oxides reveal similar active sites and pathways for CH bond activation, influenced by lattice oxygens. These insights contribute to the development of catalysts with optimized reactivity.

8. **Oxygen Vacancy Influence**: Oxygen vacancies are recognized as critical factors in modifying the electronic structure of active species, potentially altering reaction mechanisms and improving catalyst performance.

9. **Initial Propane Activation**: The pathway for initial propane activation involves H abstraction by the terminal MoO site, demonstrating the importance of specific surface sites in catalytic processes.

10. **Propane ODH vs. Propylene Combustion**: The comparison of activation energies highlights the challenges in balancing propylene yield and selectivity, guiding the development of catalysts with optimized energy profiles.

11. **Comparative Catalyst Performance**: VOx catalysts are shown to be more active than MoOx catalysts, emphasizing the potential of vanadium-based catalysts for efficient propylene production.

12. **Systematic Studies**: Comprehensive evaluations of catalysts like Cr2O3, ZnO, V2O3, and Ga2O3 reveal the impact of surface characteristics, including oxygen vacancies, on catalytic performance.

13. **Role of Oxygen Vacancies**: The presence of oxygen vacancies on ZnO surfaces suggests their potential in facilitating the initial reaction stages of PDH, contributing to the overall catalytic activity.

14. **Utilization of Mild Oxidants**: CO2 is identified as a mild oxidant capable of reactivating PDH catalysts, offering a solution to the challenges of over-oxidation and low propylene selectivity.

These strategies, guided by computational catalysis and experimental studies, aim to enhance the efficiency, stability, and recyclability of PDH processes, addressing the growing demand for propylene in industrial applications.
