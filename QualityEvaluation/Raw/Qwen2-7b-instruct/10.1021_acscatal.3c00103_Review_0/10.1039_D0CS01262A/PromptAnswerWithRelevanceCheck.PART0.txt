The only feedstock that can achieve high selectivity to olefins is ethane because ethylene is sufficiently unreactive towards oxygen compared to ethane.
This is true for ethane and ethylene, but not for propane and propylene.
Oxidative dehydrogenation, which couples the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the strongly exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, exhibits higher ethane conversion and lower operation temperature compared to steam cracking, which leads to growing interest in this process.
However, major practical challenges with ODH reaction still occur, which are (1) additional safety measures associated with O2 in the feed and (2) the development of highly active and selective catalysts due to the high reactivity of olefins compared with the corresponding paraffins.
</quotes>


<EnglishVersionAnswer>
These quotes provide insights into the challenges and advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane. The first quote highlights that ethane is uniquely suited for achieving high selectivity in the formation of olefins, unlike propane and propylene, due to ethylene's lower reactivity with oxygen. This specificity is crucial for the selective production of olefins. The second quote emphasizes that while ODH offers higher ethane conversion and lower operational temperatures compared to steam cracking, it faces significant challenges. These include the necessity for additional safety measures related to the presence of oxygen in the feedstock and the requirement for catalysts that can efficiently and selectively convert ethane into olefins, considering the high reactivity of olefins compared to paraffins. These challenges underscore the ongoing research and development efforts aimed at overcoming the practical hurdles of ODH technology to make it a viable and efficient process for olefin production.

The selectivity of propylene remains a challenge in ODH of propane.
The ratio of the terminal VO to the other two oxygen sites is a key parameter in the catalyst design.
Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane.
Propane conversion and the propylene yield could be described by a kinetic model including propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion.
The dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers.
For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced.
However, the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations.
On V2O5 powders and supported VOx, the dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers.
The initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides follows the same ODH mechanism as V-based catalysts.
Single-atom catalysis is an area of intense current research.
These findings are in line with experimental and DFT studies by Liu et al. and Sattler et al.,333,456 which clearly showed that the addition of a trace amount of Pt could accelerate H2 desorption over ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts and affect the distribution of Ga3+, thereby leading to a higher activity than the pristine surfaces.

In response to the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are being developed to address these issues by focusing on enhancing catalyst design strategies. Innovations aim to overcome deactivation, improve stability, and boost recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Key strategies include:

1. Optimizing the ratio of terminal VO to other oxygen sites to tailor catalyst selectivity and activity.
2. Dividing the PDH process into distinct stages, particularly focusing on the roles of terminal VO sites and the impact of oxygen vacancy modifications on electronic structure.
3. Utilizing kinetic models to describe the conversion of propane into propylene, accounting for various reaction pathways such as oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
4. Ensuring identical dependencies of reaction rates on propane, oxygen, and water concentrations to optimize surface active center efficiency.
5. Reducing energy barriers for water elimination through the participation of oxygen molecules in the PDH reaction, facilitating more efficient propane activation.
6. Managing the complex interplay between different pressures of propane, oxygen, and water to maintain optimal catalytic performance.
7. Employing single-atom catalysts to achieve distinct properties from supported nanoclusters, offering potential improvements in selectivity and stability.
8. Leveraging the synergistic effects of metal additives, such as potassium, to inhibit unwanted combustion reactions and enhance propylene selectivity.
9. Enhancing the catalytic performance of molybdenum oxides by tailoring their active sites to mimic those of vanadium-based catalysts.
10. Exploiting the unique properties of single-atom oxides anchored on supports through strong metal-support interactions to create thermally stable catalysts.
11. Modifying the electronic structure of catalyst surfaces by incorporating trace amounts of precious metals like platinum, which can accelerate hydrogen desorption and influence the distribution of reactive species, thereby increasing overall catalytic activity.

Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.
The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330
However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.
The nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration.
This is due to the weakened binding strength of propylene and the higher energy barrier for deep dehydrogenation on Pt(111).
The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation.
Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation.
This provides a guideline for design of PDH catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance.
The adsorption strength of the intermediates is the key parameter in tuning the activity and selectivity.

<p>Moreover, the supply of certain chemicals such as propylene, butadiene, and BTX has become constrained. Their shortage in the market is the main driving force for the renewed interest in producing them from alkanes, as low-cost feedstocks for chemical production.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation is one of the major routes to fill the lower olefin gap in terms of future production and demands.</p>
<p>A better understanding of the factors governing the fundamental aspects mentioned above is important to design more efficient catalyst systems to promote selective CH activation.</p>
<p>That is, based on the DFT calculated energetics, the scaling relationships are obtained and used to predict the energetics of other adsorbates or on other catalyst surfaces, which are further employed as input parameters of the microkinetic model.</p>
<p>The results of the mechanistic studies depend on temperature, pressure, and reactant composition.</p>
<p>It unravels the basic electronic features of the CH cleavage process to the targeted products.</p>
<p>Finally, the design of new catalysts and improvement of the catalysts are reviewed and proposed based on the fundamental understanding and theory-driven catalyst design.</p>
<p>Moreover, the oxide is one of the crucial types of catalysts to promote methane conversion.</p>
<p>The promotional effects of O* and OH* in activating CH bonds on the group 11 metals were related to the MO/MOH binding energy and their basicity when binding with metal.</p>
<p>As such, enhanced promotional effects were observed on the group 11 metal surfaces by O*/OH* over direct metal activation due to their weak MO/MOH bonding.</p>
<p>Moreover, the O* and OH* are more negatively charged when binding with the group 11 metals, thus increasing their basicity and ability to promote CH activation.</p>
<p>However, taking the coverage effect of OH* into account could reasonably lead to the direct CH4 dissociation route being dominant.</p>
<p>For instance, the geometries of the transition states (TSs) for CH4 dehydrogenation on close-packed Ni(111) and stepped Ni(211) surfaces are shown in Fig. 2(a and b), with the corresponding activation energies listed.</p>
<p>The high barrier of CH  C + H results mainly from the stability of CH* (electronic effect) coupled with the perpendicular nature of CH* (geometrical effect).</p>
<p>The Ni(211) surface exhibits lower activation energies than the Ni(111) surface due to the existence of under-coordinated atoms on the stepped (211) surface, leading to higher binding strengths of surface intermediates and more stabilization of transition states and final states.</p>
<p>This underlines the theory that the binding energy of an adsorbate to a metal surface is strongly dependent on the electronic structure of the surface itself.</p>
<p>The TS energy is linearly correlated with H binding energy.</p>
<p>In addition, all materials they explored that occurred through the surface-stabilized pathway seem to follow the TS scaling relationship which is linearly related to the final state energy.</p>
<p>However, regardless of the transition states, the nucleophilic surface oxygen attacks the electrophilic H in the CH bond to form an OH bond in CH bond activation.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrated that these scaling relations were valid for several reducible and irreducible oxides, sulfides, and promoted metals.</p>
<p>This suggested that at weak H binding strength, the reaction was limited by CH bond activation.</p>
<p>Both the CHO route and CO route were considered by Zhu et al.93 on a Ni(111) surface.</p>
<p>On each model termination, one possible lattice O site exists for catalysis.</p>
<p>The typical geometries of CH activation transition states over the perovskite(001) surface A and B terminations can be found in the lower part of Fig. 5(a).</p>
<p>The stronger the hydrogen adsorption on the lattice O or the easier the O vacancy formation at the lattice-O site, the lower the CH activation barrier of methane.</p>
<p>The study also demonstrated that stabilizing Ni catalysts with particle sizes 6 nm (Fig. 10b) could be a good strategy to achieve high activity for SRM reaction.</p>
<p>The modeling well reproduced the size-dependent activity observed from the kinetic study, namely lower activity on larger sized Ni particles (Fig. 10b).</p>
<p>The TOFs were observed to be inversely proportional to particle size and linearly related to dispersion, in good agreement with reported experimental results.</p>
<p>Although Rh exhibits very high activity, other noble metals such as Ru, Pt, Pd, and Ir are also active for SRM, but these metals are usually too expensive to be applied in conventional industrial reformers.</p>
<p>Several types of carbon have been reported on the catalysts towards methane reforming and decomposition,150 with atomic carbon, encapsulating carbon, and filamentous carbon being the most important.</p>
<p>It was suggested that the formation of monolayer encapsulating carbon blocked the active sites and hence deactivated the methane reforming, the filamentous carbon formation and the encapsulating carbon formation itself.</p>
<p>The C* site coverage is an important parameter to characterize carbon formation.</p>
<p>This explains why very small particles cannot grow filamentous carbon under normal conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, Eizenberg and Blakely observed the formation of monolayer graphene on a Ni(100) surface in experiments.156,157</p>
<p>Therefore, for large-scale hydrogen production through SRM, the pressure is above 10 bar.</p>
<p>Ni-based bimetallic catalysts by alloying Ni (the active metal) with another metal (e.g. Au,160 Ru,161 Rh,55 Co,162 Pt,163,164 Ag,165 and Sn166) are generally used to reduce methane dissociation and enhance the surface reaction of carbon removal, which could effectively increase catalyst resistance to deactivation and improve catalyst stability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the DFT-calculated C adsorption energies on Pt/Ni(111), Pd/Ni(111), Au/Ni(111), and Rh/Ni(111) were less negative than that on Ni(111), indicating that coke formation was suppressed to a certain extent on these bimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>The NiRh bimetallic catalyst was therefore suggested as a good candidate for methane dissociation due to improvement in both activity and stability, which has been verified by experimental observations.168,169</p>
<p>The addition of Ag into Ni catalysts reduced the catalytic activity towards SRM but enhanced coke formation resistance.</p>
<p>Liu et al.171 reported that segregated NiCu was a good SRM catalyst to suppress coke formation, which displayed the highest carbon deposition resistance among Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, NiFe, NiCo, NiCu, and segregated NiCu catalysts via DFT study.</p>
<p>NiRu, and NiPt alloys are promising bimetallic catalysts to effectively increase catalyst resistance to carbon deposition without sacrificing much activity or even with enhanced activity for SRM reaction.</p>

Dependence of activity and selectivity on the cluster size and valence state
Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane: the initial ODH dominant period leading to propylene, water and CO2 formation and the non-ODH dominant period (see Fig. 36d).
Over γ-Al2O3 supported VOx, the VO mainly contributes to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and deep oxidation to CO2 in the ODH dominant period.
With the consumption of the VO during the reaction, the AlOV sites become dominating active sites for propylene formation.
The cluster size needs to be compromised between the activity and selectivity, and sub-monolayer VOx could provide a high propylene yield, which has been very recently confirmed experimentally by Gong and coworkers.
Propane conversion and the propylene yield could be described by a kinetic model including propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion.
The dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers.
On V2O5 powders and supported VOx, the dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers.
The formation energy of oxygen vacancy or hydrogen affinity was identified as the descriptor to describe the oxygen activity.
The lattice oxygen is the main active site. It significantly adds complexity in DFT modeling, where the activity of oxygen depends on the local structure and coordination as well as oxygen vacancy.
The alloy of Pt with a second metal and a coreshell structure is an effective way to lower the ethylene and propylene desorption energy and increase the olefin selectivity and lower the coking potential, but at the expense of lower activity.
The single metal or metal clusters on oxides could be explored to break down the constrained relation to enhance the catalytic performance.
The active sites are highly dynamic on oxides due to their redox nature, with generation and filling of the oxygen vacancy.
Better scaling relationships for adsorption energy and activation energy on oxides need to be explored based on a big dataset.
Machine learning and artificial intelligence could be explored to significantly accelerate catalyst development.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by efficiently converting propane into propylene, a key intermediate in the petrochemical industry. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. Key aspects of these strategies include:

1. **Optimizing Cluster Size and Valence State**: Researchers focus on the balance between cluster size and valence state to achieve optimal activity and selectivity for propylene production. For instance, small clusters with a low ratio of terminal VO sites can increase propylene selectivity but might compromise activity, whereas larger clusters or polymeric VOx with a higher VO ratio could lower propylene selectivity. Sub-monolayer VOx has been shown to provide a high propylene yield, as confirmed by Gong and coworkers' experimental evidence.

2. **Kinetic Modeling**: A kinetic model encompassing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion helps describe the conversion process and propylene yield. This model takes into account the dependencies of reaction rates on propane concentration, oxygen, and water vapor pressures, providing insights into the efficiency of the conversion.

3. **Uniform Active Sites**: Studies reveal that both surfaces of V2O5 powders and supported VOx have identical dependencies on propane, oxygen, and water vapor concentrations, indicating that they share similar active centers. This finding supports the development of catalysts with uniform active sites that can maintain consistent performance under varying reaction conditions.

4. **Modulating Oxygen Activity**: Researchers investigate the role of oxygen vacancy or hydrogen affinity as descriptors for oxygen activity, crucial for controlling the catalytic process. Understanding the local structure and coordination of oxygen, along with the oxygen vacancy, aids in fine-tuning the oxygen activity to reduce unwanted side reactions and improve selectivity.

5. **Advanced Catalyst Structures**: Innovative catalyst designs, such as alloys containing platinum with another metal or core-shell structures, aim to reduce the desorption energy of ethylene and propylene while increasing olefin selectivity and reducing coking potential. These materials, however, might come with a trade-off in activity.

6. **Dynamic Active Sites and Redox Nature**: The redox nature of oxide catalysts introduces dynamic active sites that can change over time, influenced by the generation and filling of oxygen vacancies. Modeling these dynamic sites requires sophisticated computational approaches to capture the evolving nature of the active surfaces during the catalytic process.

7. **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**: Advanced computational tools, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, are being employed to accelerate the development of new catalysts. These technologies help in predicting catalyst performance, optimizing design parameters, and identifying promising catalyst candidates with high efficiency and stability.

These strategies leverage the latest advancements in materials science, catalysis, and computational chemistry to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and economic viability of propylene production through PDH, addressing the growing industrial demand while minimizing environmental impact.

The advantage of this approach is that overoxidation of the reactants and products can be reduced and therefore the olefin selectivity can be enhanced.
The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst.
The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation.
Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH.

To address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer a promising solution. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, suffer from inefficiencies and environmental concerns. PDH allows for the production of propylene from propane at lower temperatures, avoiding the formation of coke and other byproducts. This makes it thermodynamically favorable even at low temperatures, thus reducing energy requirements and enhancing sustainability.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These strategies focus on modifying the electronic and geometric properties of catalysts. For instance, the introduction of dopants like tin, titanium, gallium, copper, cobalt, zinc, iridium, and indium can improve catalyst selectivity by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing deep dehydrogenation reactions. The use of core-shell Pt-based catalysts, near-surface alloys (NSAs), and specific support materials like graphene oxide can also tune the catalytic properties.

For oxidative PDH, catalysts like supported vanadium oxides are known for their high thermal stability and large surface area. The MVK redox mechanism, involving lattice oxygen, is particularly effective. By carefully engineering the surface properties, such as modifying the oxygen activity and reducing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, catalysts can be optimized for enhanced selectivity and stability.

For nonoxidative PDH, the use of supported metal oxides, like vanadium oxide, is common. The active sites on these catalysts, such as terminal oxygen sites, are crucial for the activation of the CH bond in propane. The support material and dispersion of the metal oxide play significant roles in modifying the electronic properties of the oxygen sites, thereby affecting their activity in activating the CH bond.

In summary, by leveraging advanced catalyst design strategies, PDH processes can be tailored to efficiently produce propylene with high selectivity, stability, and recyclability. These advancements are crucial for meeting the growing demand for propylene while minimizing environmental impacts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing a more efficient and sustainable method of producing propylene compared to traditional methods. Traditional methods often involve high energy consumption and low selectivity, leading to the formation of unwanted byproducts. PDH, on the other hand, selectively converts propane to propylene through controlled dehydrogenation reactions. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, innovative catalyst design strategies focus on optimizing the active sites for propylene formation. These strategies include:

1. **Adjusting Cluster Size and Valence State**: Small clusters with a low ratio of terminal VO sites to other oxygen sites increase propylene selectivity, while maintaining sufficient activity. Polymeric VOx with a high VO ratio can lower propylene selectivity but may improve activity. The balance between activity and selectivity is crucial for catalyst design.

2. **Utilizing Active Sites**: Terminal VO sites are key for acetone formation and further combustion to CO2. These sites also play a role in propylene formation. The presence of lattice oxygen on metal oxides is essential for CH bond activation, leading to the formation of desired propylene and undesired COx species.

3. **Incorporating Metal Additives**: Alkali metal additives can improve propylene selectivity by modifying the acid-base properties of the catalyst. Potassium, for example, inhibits consecutive propylene and parallel propane combustion, enhancing propylene selectivity.

4. **Exploring Other Catalysts**: Beyond vanadium-based catalysts, chromium, gallium, molybdenum, and mixed metal oxides are studied for their ability to perform redox reactions without structural collapse. These catalysts allow for the activation of CH bonds without significant loss of structure.

5. **Single Atom Oxide Hybrids**: Single-atom catalysts (SACs) offer unique properties due to their defined local structures, allowing for precise control over the catalytic activity and selectivity. Strategies like SMSI (Strong Metal-Support Interaction) are employed to keep single atoms from aggregating and to anchor them effectively on supports.

6. **Kinetic Analysis and Microkinetic Modeling**: Computational approaches using density functional theory (DFT) combined with descriptor-based scaling relationships aid in understanding the pathways of CH bond activation, olefin desorption, and deep CH bond activation. These models help in designing catalysts that optimize the trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability.

7. **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**: Advanced computational tools are being explored to accelerate the development of catalysts by predicting their performance and optimizing the catalyst composition and structure.

By employing these strategies, PDH techniques aim to address the challenges of industrial demand for propylene while improving efficiency, reducing environmental impact, and enhancing the recyclability of catalysts.

Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.
The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst.
The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation.
This is also reflected in more negative Bader charges of oxygen sites on the (100) than (001) surfaces. This indicates that the oxygen sites are the nucleophilic centers to attack the positively charged H atoms and activate the CH bond.
The oxygen activity in VOx seems to be of vital importance for CH bond activation.
The formation energy of surface oxygen vacancy can be identified as a dominant parameter in determining the adsorption mode and the catalytic activity of metal oxides.

The selectivity of propylene remains a challenge in ODH of propane.
A study of deep oxidation of propane to CO2 on V2O5(001)424 revealed that the terminal VO sites are the active sites for the formation of acetone from i-propoxide and the further combustion of acetone to CO2.
Over γ-Al2O3 supported VOx, the VO mainly contributes to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and deep oxidation to CO2 in the ODH dominant period.
Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane: the initial ODH dominant period leading to propylene, water and CO2 formation and the non-ODH dominant period.
Propane conversion and the propylene yield could be described by a kinetic model including propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion.
The activation energies of CO and CO2 formation from secondary propylene combustion are less than the activation energy for propylene formation on TiO2/SiO2-supported VOx catalysts, leading to the inverse conversion versus selectivity relationship.
It has been illustrated that the oxygen vacancy modified the electronic structure of active species and even change the reaction mechanism.
For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced.
However, the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations.
On V2O5 powders and supported VOx, the dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers.
Significant efforts have been devoted to improving the activity of the different O sites for propane ODH of the supported VOx catalyst.
Alkali metal additives have been found to improve the propylene selectivity for propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts; the effect is explained by a modification of the acid-base properties of the catalysts.
On VOx/SiO2 catalysts, the potassium additive by blocking active centers on the catalyst surface exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on the consecutive propylene and parallel propane combustion and has a lower influence on ethylene and ethane combustion.
Zhao et al. reported that OH groups on supported VOx catalysts can lead to lower PDH activity and less coke formation by combined experimental and calculational studies.
Fu et al. reported that the initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides follows the same ODH mechanism as V-based catalysts in that lattice oxygens participate the CH activation.
On the Ga2O3(100) surface, it is difficult for the H atoms in the OH groups to form H2 or H2O.
The most feasible reaction pathway for the initial propane activation is H abstraction by the terminal MoO site and the CH activation for methylene is 0.20 eV more favorable than that for the methyl CH bond.
Propane ODH activation energies (1.031.31 eV) are higher than those for propylene combustion (0.530.67 eV), where the measured difference in activation energy (0.500.63 eV) between the both is larger than the difference in the weakest CH bond dissociation enthalpy between propane and propylene (0.42 eV).
Chen et al. also reported that VOx catalysts are much more active than MoOx catalysts with similar H2 reduction rates.
Zhu et al. systematically studied the catalytic performance of PDH on Cr2O3, ZnO, V2O3, and Ga2O3.
There are oxygen vacancies that can exist on the ZnO surfaces, also implying that the reaction path of the ODH mechanism could occur in the initial reaction stage.
Atanga et al. proposed that CO2 as a mild oxidant for the ODH of propane can reactivate deactivated redox catalysts caused by metal oxide reduction, and the introduction of CO2 can also overcome the problems of over-oxidation and low propylene selectivity.

The only feedstock that can achieve high selectivity to olefins is ethane because ethylene is sufficiently unreactive towards oxygen compared to ethane. This is evidenced by the bonding strength difference in paraffins and olefins. The weakest CH bond in ethane has a bond energy of 4.35 eV, whereas the weakest CH bond in ethylene has an energy of 4.60 eV.
For propane and propylene, the weakest CH bond has a bond energy of 4.16 and 3.74 eV respectively. A more significant difference exists for CC bond energy; the weakest CC bond in ethylene is a double bond with a bond energy of 7.46 eV compared to 4.29 eV in propylene, in which the weakest CC bond is a single bond.

To address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques utilize innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, researchers are developing catalysts that can selectively convert propane to propylene without unwanted side reactions, optimizing the catalytic activity and reducing the energy consumption. Innovative approaches include the use of supported metal oxides, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and other advanced materials that offer enhanced surface area, improved thermal stability, and better selectivity. Additionally, catalysts are designed with specific properties to facilitate the activation of CH bonds in propane, leading to the formation of propylene through selective dehydrogenation reactions. These advancements contribute to more efficient and environmentally friendly PDH processes, supporting the growth of the petrochemical industry and ensuring a sustainable supply of propylene.

The bonding strength difference between paraffins and olefins plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity of olefin production. Ethane, due to its weaker CH bonds compared to ethylene, serves as the optimal feedstock for achieving high selectivity to olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process. The analysis at the molecular level reveals that the weakest CH bond in ethane has a bond energy of 4.35 eV, while the weakest CH bond in ethylene has an energy of 4.60 eV. This difference ensures that ethane can be selectively converted to ethylene under ODH conditions without undergoing over-oxidation to form CO and CO2. In contrast, propane and propylene have weaker CH bonds, which makes them more reactive towards oxygen, leading to a less favorable selectivity towards olefin production. The distinction between ethane and ethylene lies in their ability to maintain stability against oxygen, enabling ethane to serve as a superior feedstock for the production of olefins through ODH processes.

To address the growing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer a promising solution. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, face issues with unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability. PDH, particularly oxidative PDH, avoids the formation of coke and can operate at lower temperatures compared to direct dehydrogenation. Catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

1. Innovative catalyst design strategies include modifying the geometrical and electronic structures of catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of platinum nanoparticles, alloying platinum with transition metals or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. For instance, increasing the cluster size of vanadium oxide on titanium dioxide supports can lead to higher propylene selectivity and better stability.

2. Alloying platinum with tin (Sn) can shift the d-band center of surface platinum atoms further below the Fermi level, weakening the binding strength of propylene and increasing the energy barrier for deep dehydrogenation, thereby enhancing propylene selectivity.

3. The introduction of gallium (Ga) as a promoter on platinum/ceria-alumina catalysts can decorate platinum nanoparticles, block low-coordinated defect active sites, and enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility, leading to improved catalyst stability and propylene selectivity.

4. Selecting suitable catalyst supports, such as titanium dioxide, can modify the electronic properties of the oxygen sites, changing their activity in activating the CH bond of propane. This is achieved by altering the formation energy of oxygen vacancy, which serves as a descriptor for the adsorption behavior and catalytic activity of metal oxides.

5. The formation energy of oxygen vacancy correlates with the activity of lattice oxygen in metal oxides. Lower formation energy corresponds to higher oxygen activity, facilitating more efficient adsorption and catalytic reactions. This understanding can guide the search for new catalysts with optimized properties for PDH.

It provides a guideline for the rational design of new catalysts with improved selectivity.
The ratio of the terminal VO to the other two oxygen sites is a key parameter in the catalyst design.
Small cluster VOx with a low VO ratio could increase the propylene selectivity at the expense of lowering the activity, while polymeric VOx with a high VO ratio could lower the propylene selectivity.
The cluster size needs to be compromised between the activity and selectivity.
Sub-monolayer VOx could provide a high propylene yield.
Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane.
Over γ-Al2O3 supported VOx, the VO mainly contributes to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and deep oxidation to CO2 in the ODH dominant period.
With the consumption of the VO during the reaction, the AlOV sites become dominating active sites for propylene formation.
Propane conversion and the propylene yield could be described by a kinetic model including propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion.
Propylene is the most abundant primary product.
CO and CO2 are formed by the secondary combustion of propylene.
On V2O5 powders and supported VOx, the dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical.
In addition to these studies, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the activity of the different O sites for propane ODH of the supported VOx catalyst.
Alkali metal additives have been found to improve the propylene selectivity for propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts.
On VOx/SiO2 catalysts, the potassium additive by blocking active centers on the catalyst surface exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on the consecutive propylene and parallel propane combustion.
Zhao et al.433 also reported that OH groups on supported VOx catalysts can lead to lower PDH activity and less coke formation by combined experimental and calculational studies.
For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced.
However, the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations.
In other types of catalysts, such as Cr-based catalysts, Ga-based catalysts, Mo-based catalysts, and mixed metal oxides, have also been studied in the ODH of propane.
Significant efforts have been devoted to improving the activity of the different O sites for propane ODH of the supported VOx catalyst.
Liu et al.402 studied PDH on perfect Ga2O3(100) by DFT calculations.
On the Ga2O3(100) surface, it is difficult for the H atoms in the OH groups to form H2 or H2O.
For MoOx catalysts, similar active centers are present on supported MoOx, MoO3, and ZrMo2O8.
Surface O and OH groups are the most abundant surface intermediates that can lead to a rate expression to accurately describe the measured kinetics of propane ODH.
For the transition state for this elementary step, the electrons are transferred from lattice oxygens to metal centers as an i-propoxide and an OH group from propane.
Chen et al. also reported that VOx catalysts are much more active than MoOx catalysts with similar H2 reduction rates.
Zhu et al.358,391,405,439 systematically studied the catalytic performance of PDH on Cr2O3, ZnO, V2O3, and Ga2O3.
There are oxygen vacancies that can exist on the ZnO surfaces, also implying that the reaction path of the ODH mechanism could occur in the initial reaction stage.
However, if oxidants are introduced into the reaction gas, the dehydrogenation reaction could follow the ODH mechanism to remove the H atoms absorbed on the surface.
Some supports have been considered to anchor single metal atoms by theoretical calculations.
For instance, Pt1Cr2O3(0001) and Pt1ZnO(1010) oxides were constructed by Chang et al.,405 and show higher activity than their pristine surfaces by lowering the activation energy for the RDS and promoting H2 desorption.
These findings are in line with experimental and DFT studies by Liu et al. and Sattler et al.,333,456 which clearly showed that the addition of a trace amount of Pt could accelerate H2 desorption over ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts and affect the distribution of Ga3+, thereby leading to a higher activity than the pristine surfaces.
On the Pt1Ga2O3(100) surface, a Pt-doped Ga2O3 catalyst shows a bifunctional character in PDH where the PtO site brings about dehydrogenation, while the GaO site is active for desorbing H2.
The kinetics of the PDH reaction over M1V2O3 (M = MnCu, RuAg, and OsAu) were studied by Zhang et al.391
Moreover, it shows that the VO(o) site is the dominant active site over V2O3(0001).
In this review, we attempted to illustrate the recent substantial progress made by using such theoretical methods in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of CH bonds of light alkanes and in the discovery of new and more effective catalysts for light alkane conversion on metal and metal oxides.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by converting propane into propylene, a more valuable chemical feedstock, through a series of chemical reactions. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These strategies focus on optimizing the composition and structure of the catalysts, particularly by adjusting the ratio of terminal vanadium (VO) sites to other oxygen sites on the surface of vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts. By balancing the cluster size, researchers aim to achieve a compromise between high activity and selectivity, with sub-monolayer VOx catalysts showing potential for high propylene yields.

To improve the selectivity towards propylene, alkali metal additives are used to block active centers on the catalyst surface, inhibiting unwanted side reactions such as consecutive propylene and parallel propane combustion. Additionally, studies indicate that hydroxyl (OH) groups on the supported VOx catalysts can lead to lower PDH activity and less coke formation, contributing to the development of more efficient catalysts. Furthermore, the introduction of oxidants like carbon dioxide can re-activate deposed redox catalysts, potentially overcoming issues of over-oxidation and low propylene selectivity.

Innovative catalyst designs, such as single-atom catalysts (SACs) anchored on metal oxides, offer new opportunities for enhancing catalytic performance. These SACs exhibit distinct properties from supported nanoclusters, allowing for a better understanding of the structure-reactivity relationship. By trapping single atoms or units like platinum (Pt) or platinum oxide (PtO2) on supports like iron oxide (Fe2O3) through strong metal-support interactions (SMSI), researchers create catalysts that can be selectively used for PDH while maintaining stability and activity.

Another strategy involves the use of metal oxide interfaces and locally coordinated oxygen, which significantly modifies the electronic properties of active sites and their relation to the catalytic performance of alkane conversion. Computational models predict that certain single-atom-doped zirconium oxide catalysts can exhibit higher activity than pristine zirconium oxide surfaces, offering new opportunities for developing more cost-effective heterogeneous catalysts.

Overall, these advancements in catalyst design are aimed at achieving a balance between high activity, selectivity, and stability, while also reducing the risk of coking and enhancing recyclability. The integration of computational catalysis, including density functional theory (DFT), scaling relationships, and descriptor-based microkinetic modeling, enables a more detailed and accurate description of catalytic reactions at surfaces, facilitating the design of catalysts that can effectively convert light alkanes to valuable products like propylene, in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.
