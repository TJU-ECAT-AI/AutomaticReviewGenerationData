In the face of rising demand for olefins and the constraints of conventional manufacturing methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques tackle these issues by efficiently converting light alkanes into olefins. Innovations in catalyst design aim to overcome deactivation problems, boost stability, and enhance recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For oxidative PDH, solid oxygen carriers such as ceria (CeO2), antimony oxide (SbO4), indium oxide (In2O3), tungsten oxide (WO3), lead oxide (PbOx), thallium oxide (Tl2O3), and bismuth oxide (BiO3) are explored to selectively oxidize hydrogen produced by the steam methane reforming (SHC) reaction. Metal oxides like gallium oxide (GaOx), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (VOx) have garnered attention as alternative catalysts for nonoxidative PDH, although their effectiveness cannot always be fully restored through regeneration. Recent developments in operando spectroscopy, including UVvis and Raman spectroscopy, facilitate more advanced process management and monitoring of catalyst degradation.

面对对烯烃需求的增长和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过更高效和可持续的方式将轻质烷烃转化为烯烃，解决了这些挑战。在催化剂设计方面，研究人员正在开发策略以克服失活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，适用于氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程。对于氧化性PDH，铈（CeO2）、锑（SbO4）、铟（In2O3）、钨（WO3）、铅（PbOx）、铊（Tl2O3）和铋（BiO3）等固体氧载体被探索用于选择性氧化由蒸汽甲烷重整（SHC）反应产生的氢气。作为非氧化性PDH的替代催化剂，镓氧化物（GaOx）、钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（VOx）已经引起了关注，尽管它们的活性通常不能完全通过再生步骤恢复。最近在原位光谱学技术方面的进展，包括紫外可见光谱和拉曼光谱，使更高级的过程管理和监控催化剂降解成为可能。
