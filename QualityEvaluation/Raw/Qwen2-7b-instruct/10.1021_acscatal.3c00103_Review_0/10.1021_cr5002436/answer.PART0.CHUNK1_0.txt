Industrial demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to stay robust. Alternative methods, including dehydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins (MTO), are gaining competitiveness against traditional processes like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Over the last few years, numerous new PDH projects have been announced. There is room for enhancement in current dehydrogenation technologies to reduce the usage of noble metals, boost catalyst stability, and optimize energy efficiency. Progress is expected in other areas. Careful management of regeneration conditions is crucial to avoid irreversible catalyst deactivation when removing coke from spent catalysts.

工业对烯烃，尤其是丙烯的需求预计将在可预见的未来保持稳定。替代方法，如脱氢和甲醇到烯烃（MTO），正在传统过程如流化床催化裂化和蒸汽裂解中获得竞争力。近年来，已宣布了大量新的PDH项目。当前的脱氢技术仍有改进空间，以降低贵金属的使用量、提高催化剂稳定性并优化能效。在其他领域也有可能取得进展。当从废弃催化剂中去除焦炭时，需要仔细控制再生条件，以避免不可逆的催化剂失活。
