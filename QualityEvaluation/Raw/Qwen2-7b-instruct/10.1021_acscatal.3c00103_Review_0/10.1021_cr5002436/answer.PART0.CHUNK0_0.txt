[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[3] "In fact, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[4] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[5] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[6] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[7] "To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to compare such a wide range of dehydrogenation catalysts in a single review article, although other reviews have been published in recent years dealing with the dehydrogenation of light paraffins."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by utilizing more efficient conversion technologies that can produce propylene from natural gas, which is abundant and inexpensive. Innovations in catalyst design focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability. For instance, the Catofin and Oleflex processes employ fluidized bed reactors and adiabatic fixed bed reactors, respectively, to optimize the dehydrogenation process. Catalysts like platinum, chromium oxide, gallium oxide, and indium oxide are developed to improve the selectivity and efficiency of the PDH processes. The profitability of PDH is influenced by the price differences between propane and propylene, and current market conditions favor PDH. The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years due to advancements in technology and growing demand for propylene.
