[1] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[2] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[3] "For both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."
[4] "Operando spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The process of coke formation in dehydrogenation catalysts is complex and not fully understood.
2. Accumulated coke obstructs reactant diffusion to the catalyst surface, reducing catalytic activity.
3. Industrial Pt and CrOx catalysts can irreversibly deactivate if coke is not properly removed during regeneration.
4. Operando spectroscopy can monitor the amount and type of coke forming on catalyst surfaces without intrusion.

1. 焦炭形成的过程在脱氢催化剂中非常复杂且不完全了解。
2. 积累的焦炭阻碍反应物向催化剂表面扩散，降低催化活性。
3. 工业用的Pt和CrOx催化剂在再生过程中如果不能妥善去除焦炭可能会永久性失活。
4. 在线光谱法可以在不侵入的情况下监测焦炭在催化剂表面上的生成和积累量。
