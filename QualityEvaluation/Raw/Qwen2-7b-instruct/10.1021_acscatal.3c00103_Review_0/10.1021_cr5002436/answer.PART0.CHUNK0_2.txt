[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "In Figure 1, the uses as well as the recent and predicted future growth of the olefin supply and demand are shown."
[3] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[5] "In fact, the use of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites has been noted as a key factor in promoting both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts."
[6] "As early as 1977, Fiedorow et al. showed that Pt/Al2O3 catalysts more readily sinter in an oxygen-containing atmosphere than in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at temperatures above 600 C."
[7] "Indeed, the high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[8] "However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3."
[9] "Indeed, it has been observed that Cr3+ species that are both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated are key to achieving high activity and selectivity over chromium-based hydrogenation catalysts."
[10] "In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, catalysts based on these materials display an initial conversion of 18.1% with a selectivity toward propylene of 87.1% at 550 C."

To address the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques leverage the abundant supply of natural gas, particularly from shale gas deposits. Innovations in catalyst design focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Key strategies include:

1. **Utilizing Shale Gas**: The abundance and cost-effectiveness of shale gas, particularly ethane, enable a shift from traditional feedstocks like naphtha for steam cracking operations, leading to more efficient PDH processes.

2. **Catalyst Promotion and Design**: Incorporating alkali metals like potassium, rubidium, and cesium into catalyst formulations helps stabilize the support structure, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites, thereby boosting both activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

3. **Regeneration Strategies**: Efficient regeneration techniques, such as combustion of coke deposits and redispersion of catalyst components, are essential for maintaining high activity levels across multiple cycles.

4. **Support Material Optimization**: Choosing suitable support materials, such as zirconia or titania, that offer enhanced stability and activity, particularly by facilitating the redispersion of active chromium species during regeneration.

5. **Advanced Reaction Mechanisms**: Development of catalysts with dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated chromium species, which are crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity in PDH reactions, especially in ethane dehydrogenation.

6. **Surface Area Management**: Ensuring high surface area in catalyst formulations, particularly for materials like mesoporous silica or zirconia, allows for better stabilization of active sites and reduces the risk of sintering.

These strategies collectively aim to optimize PDH processes, making them more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable, while meeting growing demand for propylene and other olefinic compounds.

为了应对对丙烯等基础化学品需求增加以及传统生产方法的限制，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术利用丰富的天然气资源，尤其是页岩气，来解决这些问题。在催化剂设计方面，通过以下几个关键策略来克服失活问题、提高稳定性和增强可循环性，适用于氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程：

1. **利用页岩气**：由于页岩气（特别是乙烷）的丰富和成本效益高，使得从传统的裂解原料（如石脑油）转向使用页岩气进行蒸汽裂解操作成为可能，从而提高了PDH过程的效率。

2. **催化剂促进与设计**：在催化剂配方中加入钾、铷、铯等大碱金属有助于稳定载体结构、降低表面酸性，并增加活性位点的数量，从而提高PDH反应中的活性和选择性。

3. **再生策略**：有效的再生技术，包括燃烧碳沉积物和催化剂成分的再分散，对于维持多个周期内高活性水平至关重要。

4. **支持材料优化**：选择像氧化锆或二氧化钛这样的支持材料，它们能提供更好的稳定性、活性，特别是在再生过程中有利于活性铬物种的再分散。

5. **高级反应机制**：开发包含分散且具有协调不饱和铬物种的催化剂，这些物种对于实现PDH反应中的高活性和选择性尤其重要，尤其是在乙烷脱氢化过程中。

6. **表面积管理**：确保催化剂配方中有足够的表面积，特别是对于多孔硅或氧化锆等材料，这有助于更好地稳定活性位点并减少结块的风险。

这些策略共同作用于优化PDH过程，使其更加高效、经济和环境友好，以满足不断增长的丙烯和其他烯烃化合物的需求。
