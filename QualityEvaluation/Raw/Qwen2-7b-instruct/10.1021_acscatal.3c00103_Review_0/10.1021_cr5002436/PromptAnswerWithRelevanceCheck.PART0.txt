The growing demand for propylene and other light olefins has spurred interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as an alternative or supplementary method to traditional production processes. PDH allows for the conversion of propane into propylene, addressing the challenges of increasing demand and limitations of conventional methods. Innovations in catalyst design focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability. 

These innovations involve the development of more active and selective catalysts, optimization of operating conditions, and the introduction of novel materials. For instance, platinum-based catalysts often incorporate promoters like tin to suppress side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, thus maintaining high olefin selectivity. Chromium oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are engineered to ensure a high dispersion of active sites while minimizing coke formation through the strategic use of supports and promoters.

To overcome deactivation issues, researchers are exploring strategies such as incorporating alkali metals to modify catalyst properties, using materials with improved thermal stability, and developing new synthesis methods to create catalysts with optimized active sites. The goal is to extend the lifetime of catalysts, reduce energy consumption, and minimize waste generation. The ongoing advancements in PDH technology aim to make the process more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable for the petrochemical industry.

由于丙烯等轻烯烃作为化学基础材料的广泛应用，轻烯烃如丙烯（丙烯）和乙烯（乙烯）在化学工业中是最重要的化合物类型之一。这些基础化学品广泛用于生产聚合物（如聚乙烯和聚丙烯）、氧化物（如乙二醇、甲醛、乙酮和丙烯氧化物）以及重要的中间体（如乙苯和丙酮）。近年来，对这些基础化学品的需求持续增长，所有主要市场的需求和产量均呈现正向增长，除了欧元区，受到最近经济衰退的影响。

蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）是获取这些轻烯烃最常用的方法。然而，脱氢反应在热力学上有限且高度吸热，根据勒夏特列原理，需要更高的反应温度或更低的烷烃分压来实现高转化率。例如，要将C2-C4烷烃转化为50%的烷基化物，在1巴下通常需要550-750°C的温度。幸运的是，这些副反应被特定的催化剂所催化，这些催化剂不需要参与脱氢反应，这意味着通过精心设计催化剂可以获得高烯烃产率。

截至撰写本文时，每年约有500万吨丙烯通过丙烷脱氢（PDH）生产。然而，预计在未来几年这一数字会显著增加，因为全球已宣布并正在建设中的新PDH装置数量众多，许多装置已经开工。

为了克服催化剂失效问题、提高稳定性并改善可回收性，研究人员正在开发更活跃和选择性更强的催化剂，优化操作条件，并引入新材料。铂基催化剂通常通过添加促进剂如锡来抑制氢解和异构化等副反应，从而保持高烯烃选择性。

为了解决催化剂失效问题，研究人员正在探索策略，如引入碱金属以改变催化剂性质，使用具有更好热稳定性的材料，以及开发合成方法以创建具有优化活性位点的催化剂。目标是延长催化剂寿命、减少能耗并减少废物产生。正在进行的PDH技术进步旨在使过程更加高效、可持续和经济可行，以满足石化行业的需要。

[1] "Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied."
[2] "Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time."
[3] "It is important to note that the advantages offered by the combustion of coke during the regeneration step far outweigh these unwanted side effects."
[4] "Indeed, it has been observed that when the space velocity (GHSV) decreased from 3600 to 600 h−1, ethane conversion increased from 27.6% to 31.4%, while selectivity to ethylene decreased from 91.7% to 64.9%."
[5] "It is clear that the optimal nuclearity of active Cr3+ sites remains a topic still under debate."
[6] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated. Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."
[7] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2."
[8] "Some of these catalysts were found to achieve ethane conversions of 27–30% and selectivity toward ethylene of 71–75%."

To address the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques leverage innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. In both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, researchers focus on the structure of catalysts under reaction conditions, the nature of active sites, the role of support materials, the impact of alkali metal promoters, and the dehydrogenation mechanism. 

These strategies aim to optimize the activity and selectivity of catalysts, with a particular emphasis on chromium oxide-based catalysts. While the selectivity of these catalysts is insensitive to chromium loading, it evolves over time. The advantages of coke combustion during the regeneration step often surpass the negative effects of coke deposition. Decreasing space velocity can boost ethane conversion while slightly lowering ethylene selectivity. The nuclearity of active chromium(III) sites remains a subject of ongoing debate, with the role of chromium species such as chromium(III), chromium(V), and chromium(VI) in the dehydrogenation process being crucial.

Alternative support materials like zirconia are explored due to their low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which make them suitable substitutes for alumina. The regeneration of chromium(II) from chromium(III) during the process enhances activity, and doping with alkali metals can promote both activity and selectivity. However, certain additives, like potassium, can negatively impact activity. 

Some catalysts have achieved ethane conversions of 27-30% and ethylene selectivities of 71-75% under certain conditions, showcasing promising advancements in catalyst design for PDH processes. These efforts collectively aim to improve the efficiency, stability, and recyclability of PDH catalysts, addressing the growing demand for propylene in the chemical industry.

为了应对丙烯工业需求增加和传统生产方法的局限性带来的挑战，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过创新催化剂设计策略来克服催化剂失活、提高稳定性和增强可循环利用性。在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中，研究人员专注于催化剂在反应条件下的结构、活性位点的性质、载体的作用、碱金属促进剂的影响以及脱氢机制。

这些策略旨在优化催化剂的活性和选择性，特别是铬氧化物基催化剂。虽然这些催化剂的选择性对铬含量不敏感，但随着时间的推移会发生变化。在再生步骤中燃烧焦炭的优点往往超过了焦炭沉积的负面影响。降低空间速度可以增加乙烷转化率，同时稍微降低乙烯选择性。活性铬（III）位点的核性仍然是一个仍在辩论的话题，脱氢过程中铬（III）、铬（V）和铬（VI）物种的作用至关重要。

探索替代支撑材料，如锆，由于其低表面酸性和增强的烧结抵抗力，成为替代氧化铝的可行选择。再生过程中的铬（II）从铬（III）形成增加了活性，并且添加碱金属可以促进活性和选择性。然而，某些添加剂，如钾，可能会影响活性。

一些催化剂已经实现了27%-30%的乙烷转化率和71%-75%的乙烯选择性，在特定条件下，这表明PDH催化剂设计取得了进步。这些努力集体地旨在提高PDH催化剂的效率、稳定性和可循环性，以应对化学工业对丙烯日益增长的需求。
