In response to the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are addressing these challenges by offering an alternative route for propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, such as coke formation, which limits the long-term stability and economic viability of PDH processes. Researchers are focusing on several approaches to enhance catalyst stability, improve selectivity, and facilitate recyclability. For instance, they are exploring the use of metal oxide-based catalysts with incorporated promoters to reduce coke formation and promote efficient hydrogen desorption. Additionally, strategies such as the use of solid oxygen carriers or oxidative dehydrogenation processes with controlled oxygen feed are being developed to mitigate the limitations of nonoxidative PDH. Operando spectroscopic techniques are also advancing, allowing for real-time monitoring of catalyst performance and coke formation, enabling dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases.
