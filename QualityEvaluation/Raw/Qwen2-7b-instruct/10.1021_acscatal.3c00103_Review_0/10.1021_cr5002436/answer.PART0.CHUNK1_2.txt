[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."
[2] "However, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[3] "Nevertheless, advancements can also be expected in other areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[4] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."
[5] "For both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."
[6] "These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state."

1. Despite the outstanding performance of platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, concerns over catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental issues related to Cr usage have prompted the exploration of alternative catalysts.
2. Metal oxide-based catalysts, while offering competitive performance, suffer from rapid deactivation primarily due to coke deposition, with their activity unable to fully recover through regeneration.
3. Innovations are anticipated in other areas, notably oxidative dehydrogenation, which avoids the thermodynamic constraints of nonoxidative dehydrogenation.
4. Numerous new PDH projects have been announced in recent years, with plans to utilize either chromium oxide/alumina (Catofin) or platinum-silver/alumina (Oleflex) catalysts.
5. Industrial use of Pt and chromium oxide catalysts necessitates careful management of coke removal during regeneration to prevent irreversible catalyst degradation.
6. The aforementioned findings suggest that adjusting the duration of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases can maintain catalyst activity more efficiently.
