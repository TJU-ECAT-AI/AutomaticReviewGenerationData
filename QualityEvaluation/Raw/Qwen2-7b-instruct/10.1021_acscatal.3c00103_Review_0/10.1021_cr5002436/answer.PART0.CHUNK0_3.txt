[1] "Due to their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
[3] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[4] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
[5] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
[6] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar."
[7] "Fortunately, these side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design."
[8] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[9] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

The growing demand for propylene and other light olefins has spurred interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as an alternative or supplementary method to traditional production processes. PDH allows for the conversion of propane into propylene, addressing the challenges of increasing demand and limitations of conventional methods. Innovations in catalyst design focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability. 

These innovations involve the development of more active and selective catalysts, optimization of operating conditions, and the introduction of novel materials. For instance, platinum-based catalysts often incorporate promoters like tin to suppress side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, thus maintaining high olefin selectivity. Chromium oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are engineered to ensure a high dispersion of active sites while minimizing coke formation through the strategic use of supports and promoters.

To overcome deactivation issues, researchers are exploring strategies such as incorporating alkali metals to modify catalyst properties, using materials with improved thermal stability, and developing new synthesis methods to create catalysts with optimized active sites. The goal is to extend the lifetime of catalysts, reduce energy consumption, and minimize waste generation. The ongoing advancements in PDH technology aim to make the process more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable for the petrochemical industry.

由于丙烯等轻烯烃作为化学基础材料的广泛应用，轻烯烃如丙烯（丙烯）和乙烯（乙烯）在化学工业中是最重要的化合物类型之一。这些基础化学品广泛用于生产聚合物（如聚乙烯和聚丙烯）、氧化物（如乙二醇、甲醛、乙酮和丙烯氧化物）以及重要的中间体（如乙苯和丙酮）。近年来，对这些基础化学品的需求持续增长，所有主要市场的需求和产量均呈现正向增长，除了欧元区，受到最近经济衰退的影响。

蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）是获取这些轻烯烃最常用的方法。然而，脱氢反应在热力学上有限且高度吸热，根据勒夏特列原理，需要更高的反应温度或更低的烷烃分压来实现高转化率。例如，要将C2-C4烷烃转化为50%的烷基化物，在1巴下通常需要550-750°C的温度。幸运的是，这些副反应被特定的催化剂所催化，这些催化剂不需要参与脱氢反应，这意味着通过精心设计催化剂可以获得高烯烃产率。

截至撰写本文时，每年约有500万吨丙烯通过丙烷脱氢（PDH）生产。然而，预计在未来几年这一数字会显著增加，因为全球已宣布并正在建设中的新PDH装置数量众多，许多装置已经开工。

为了克服催化剂失效问题、提高稳定性并改善可回收性，研究人员正在开发更活跃和选择性更强的催化剂，优化操作条件，并引入新材料。铂基催化剂通常通过添加促进剂如锡来抑制氢解和异构化等副反应，从而保持高烯烃选择性。

为了解决催化剂失效问题，研究人员正在探索策略，如引入碱金属以改变催化剂性质，使用具有更好热稳定性的材料，以及开发合成方法以创建具有优化活性位点的催化剂。目标是延长催化剂寿命、减少能耗并减少废物产生。正在进行的PDH技术进步旨在使过程更加高效、可持续和经济可行，以满足石化行业的需要。
