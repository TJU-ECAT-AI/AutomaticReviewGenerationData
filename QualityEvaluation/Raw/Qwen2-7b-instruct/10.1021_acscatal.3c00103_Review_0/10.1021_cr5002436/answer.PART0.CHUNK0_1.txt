[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
[3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[4] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[5] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[6] "Moreover, the products made by these olefins are shown in the graph to the right."
[7] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[8] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[9] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[10] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[11] "To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to compare such a wide range of dehydrogenation catalysts in a single review article, although other reviews have been published in recent years dealing with the dehydrogenation of light paraffins."
[12] "For example, Bhasin et al. wrote an extensive review on the industrial application of dehydrogenation technologies in 2001, which includes a comparative discussion of the state of the art of oxidative dehydrogenation technologies."
[13] "To date, five main industrial processes for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been patented, two of which are currently being used to produce light olefins."
[14] "The majority of these new facilities will be built in China or the United States and will use either the Catofin (Lummus) or the Oleflex (UOP) technologies."
[15] "Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018."
[16] "Furthermore, in Table 2, a comparison is made between the two most important processes, Catofin and Oleflex."

In response to growing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method to produce propylene from propane, which is more cost-effective and efficient compared to conventional processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature highlights several key points:

1. The demand for propylene has increased steadily over the years, with all major markets experiencing growth except the Eurozone due to the economic downturn.
2. Shale gas production in the United States has significantly increased, lowering gas costs and making it a more attractive energy source and feedstock for producing transportation fuels and chemicals.
3. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is highly influenced by the price difference between propane and propylene, making current market conditions favorable.
4. Numerous new PDH installations have been announced globally, with many already under construction, indicating a significant increase in propylene production capacity.
5. Dehydrogenation technologies offer a targeted production of olefins instead of a mixture, optimizing processes for polymer-quality purity.
6. Comparative reviews of various dehydrogenation catalysts have not been extensively conducted, though several reviews have addressed the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, including oxidative and industrial applications.
7. Patent-protected processes like Catofin and Oleflex are widely used for propane dehydrogenation, with plans to build new facilities in China and the US using these technologies.
8. The projected annual production of propylene is expected to grow by 14 million tons by 2018 due to the expansion of new PDH installations.

These advancements in PDH techniques, along with strategic innovations in catalyst design and optimization, aim to meet the escalating demand for propylene in a more sustainable and economically viable manner.

针对丙烯需求的增长以及传统生产方法的限制，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种从丙烷生产丙烯的方法来解决这些挑战，这种方法相比传统过程更为经济有效。在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略以克服失活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性。文献中强调了几个关键点：

1. 近年来，所有主要市场的需求增长，除了欧元区，因为受到了经济衰退的影响。
2. 美国的页岩气产量显著增加，降低了天然气成本，使其作为能源来源和生产运输燃料或化学品的原料更具吸引力。
3. 丙烷脱氢的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷与丙烯的价格差异，当前市场条件非常有利。
4. 全球宣布了许多新的PDH安装项目，其中许多已经开工建造，预示着丙烯年产量将大幅增长。
5. 脱氢化技术提供了目标生产烯烃而不是混合物的能力，优化了聚合物质量纯度的过程。
6. 比较各种脱氢催化剂的综述未被广泛进行，但一些综述已探讨了轻烷烃的脱氢，包括氧化性和工业应用。
7. Catofin和Oleflex等专利保护过程广泛用于丙烷脱氢，计划在中国和美国建立新设施使用这些技术。
8. 预计到2018年，由于新建PDH安装项目的扩张，每年丙烯的生产量将增长至1400万吨。

这些PDH技术的进步，以及在催化剂设计和优化方面的战略创新，旨在以更可持续和经济有效的方式满足不断增长的丙烯需求。
