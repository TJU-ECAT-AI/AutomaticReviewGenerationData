[1] "The development of advanced dehydrogenation technologies, catalyst design and new chemistry in catalytic propane dehydrogenation reactions. Despite the significant and challenging task ahead, we believe that a combination of intensified dehydrogenation processes, controllable synthesis methodologies, and fine characterization techniques, together with mechanistic investigation, will further ensure the development of propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "However, steps will need to be taken to overcome drawbacks of this reaction and improve the energy efficiency, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
[3] "Moreover, advanced characterization and deeper discussion of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions are still inadequate."
[4] "Although grand opportunities exist, several major challenges in the aspects of dehydrogenation technologies, catalyst development and characterization as well as theoretical stimulation methods should be considered."
