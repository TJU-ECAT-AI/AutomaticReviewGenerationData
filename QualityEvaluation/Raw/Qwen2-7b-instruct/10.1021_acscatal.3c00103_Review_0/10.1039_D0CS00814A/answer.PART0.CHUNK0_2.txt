1. The Oleflex and Catofin processes have been widely used in industrial applications for propane dehydrogenation, while the STAR process is in the process of industrialization. A variety of catalysts, including metal-based, metal oxide-based, and non-oxide-based catalysts, have been developed for PDH reactions due to their ability to efficiently activate paraffinic CH bonds and minimize cleavage of CC bonds.

2. Controlling the acidity of the support is crucial to prevent the formation of unwanted coke and alkane isomerization, ensuring better catalytic performance.

3. The active site on Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions. This structure enables the catalyst to efficiently activate propane molecules for dehydrogenation.

4. Adding noble metals like Rh nanoclusters can significantly affect the reducibility of zirconia, thereby impacting the catalytic activity of zirconia-based catalysts.

5. The amount of coordinatively unsaturated penta-coordinate Al atoms on the surface of Al2O3 can greatly influence the catalytic properties of the catalyst, affecting its activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

1. Oleflex和Catofin过程已经在工业中广泛应用，而STAR过程正在进入工业化阶段。几十年来，开发出了包括铂基、氧化物基和非氧化物基在内的多种催化剂，用于直接进行PDH反应，这些催化剂因其对烷基CH键的亲和力和对CC断裂的低活性而表现出高效性能。

2. 控制支撑材料的酸性对于防止生成不希望的焦炭和烷烃异构化至关重要，这将有助于保持更好的催化性能。

3. Ga2O3上的活性位点是提供配位不饱和Ga3+离子的Lewis酸位点。这种结构允许催化剂有效地激活丙烷分子进行脱氢反应。

4. 添加如铑纳米团簇等贵重金属可以显著影响氧化锆的还原性，从而影响基于氧化锆的催化剂的活性。

5. Al2O3表面配位不饱和五面体Al原子的数量可以极大地影响催化剂的催化性质，影响其在PDH反应中的活性和选择性。
