[1] "Despite the significant and challenging task ahead, we believe that a combination of intensified dehydrogenation processes, controllable synthesis methodologies, and fine characterization techniques, together with mechanistic investigation, will further ensure the development of propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
[3] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
[4] "The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts."
[5] "However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions. Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
