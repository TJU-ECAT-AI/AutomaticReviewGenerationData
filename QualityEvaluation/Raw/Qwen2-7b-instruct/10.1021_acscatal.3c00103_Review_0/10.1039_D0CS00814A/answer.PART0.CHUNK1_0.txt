[1] "However, further improvements with lower noble metal loadings and deactivation rates are highly desired."
[2] "In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures."
[3] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
[4] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."
[5] "Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH. However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."

1. Lower noble metal loadings and reduced deactivation rates are highly sought after improvements in propane dehydrogenation processes. 
2. The selection of supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly affects the structure of the catalysts used in these processes.
3. Operando/in situ characterization techniques, including in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM), should be encouraged for detailed analysis of catalyst behavior.
4. Establishing a universal connection between catalyst structure and activity is a pressing concern in this field.
5. While single-site Pt catalysts have been explored, they still face challenges like sintering and reconstruction, particularly under propane dehydrogenation conditions.
