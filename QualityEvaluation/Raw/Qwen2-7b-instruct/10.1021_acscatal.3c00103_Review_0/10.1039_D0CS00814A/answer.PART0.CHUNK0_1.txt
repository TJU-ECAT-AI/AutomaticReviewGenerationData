[1] "Propyne is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."
[2] "However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."
[3] "In the past few years, increasing technologies for propylene production have been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins process."
[4] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
[5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by producing pure propylene as a single product, unlike hybrid products. This makes PDH a more efficient and targeted method for propylene production. 

2. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues in PDH processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn, to enhance activity and selectivity while reducing the need for precious metals. Strategies like controlled regeneration and the use of promoters to stabilize catalysts are also being explored. For nonoxidative PDH, efforts are focused on improving the stability of metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium oxides, by modifying their structure and support to reduce coke formation and improve recyclability.

1. PDH技术通过生产纯丙烯作为单一产品，而不是混合物，来解决对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法的局限性。这使得PDH成为更有效和针对性的丙烯生产方法。

2. 在PDH过程中克服失活问题的创新催化剂设计策略包括使用双金属催化剂（如PtSn），以增强活性和选择性，同时减少对贵金属的需求。探索的策略还包括受控再生和使用促进剂稳定催化剂。对于非氧化PDH，努力提高铬氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂的稳定性，通过修改其结构和支持来减少焦炭形成并改善可回收性。
