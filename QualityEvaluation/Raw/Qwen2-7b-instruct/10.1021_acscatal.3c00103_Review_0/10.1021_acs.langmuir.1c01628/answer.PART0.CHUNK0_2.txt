The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by offering a more efficient alternative. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking, face issues with high energy consumption and environmental concerns. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These strategies focus on optimizing the composition, structure, and support materials of the catalysts. For oxidative PDH processes, the development of stable and active catalysts is crucial for maintaining high conversion rates and selectivity. In nonoxidative PDH processes, the emphasis is on achieving a balance between high activity and reduced sintering, which leads to catalyst deactivation. Simulations have been instrumental in understanding the sintering rate and mechanism of supported Pt nanoparticles, aiding in the design of more effective catalysts.
