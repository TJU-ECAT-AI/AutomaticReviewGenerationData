To address the growing industrial demand for propylene and overcome the limitations of traditional production methods, researchers are focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques offer a more efficient way to produce propylene, which is crucial in various industries such as petrochemicals and plastics manufacturing. In PDH processes, scientists are developing innovative catalyst design strategies aimed at overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing the stability of the catalysts, and improving their recyclability. This includes the use of supported Pt nanoparticles, which can be optimized through multiscale simulation to achieve better performance in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.
