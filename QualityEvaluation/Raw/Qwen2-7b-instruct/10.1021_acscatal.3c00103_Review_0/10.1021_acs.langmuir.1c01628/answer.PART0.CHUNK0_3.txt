Sintering rate and mechanism of supported Pt nanoparticles are being investigated through multiscale simulation to develop innovative catalyst design strategies that address the challenges posed by the increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. These strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Propane dehydrogenation techniques offer a promising alternative to traditional methods due to their efficiency and ability to meet the growing demand for propylene.
