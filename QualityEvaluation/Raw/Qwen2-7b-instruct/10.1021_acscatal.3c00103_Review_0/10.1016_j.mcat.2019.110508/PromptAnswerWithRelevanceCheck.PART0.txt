In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by converting propane into propylene more efficiently and economically. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies. Specifically, they are focusing on:

1. Utilizing transition metal catalysts with optimized properties that are determined by the characteristics of the support material, aiming for low-cost and green systems that offer good stability.

2. Employing ZnO as a catalyst, which is known for its Lewis acidic properties, capable of facilitating heterolytic CH bond cleavage and simultaneously inhibiting the rupture of CC bonds. This is done by dispersing Zn species effectively across the support material.

3. Using high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite as a support, which provides a suitable acidic environment, good structural properties, and a sparse distribution of Al sites. This allows for better dispersion of Zn species and reduces the likelihood of aggregation into bulk ZnO on the surface.

4. Analyzing the distribution and forms of Zn species, as well as identifying the nature of active Zn species through various characterization techniques, to optimize the catalytic performance.

5. Designing catalysts that are environmentally friendly, low-cost, and reusable, thereby offering a promising solution for industrial propylene production.

These strategies not only improve the efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes but also contribute to the development of more versatile and robust transition metal catalysts for propylene production.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by converting propane to propylene efficiently. Traditional methods often use costly catalysts such as PtSn and CrOx, which hinder their widespread industrial applications due to high costs and toxicity. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome these issues by developing more cost-effective, non-toxic, and reusable catalysts. In particular, ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite are shown to have high catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in PDH processes. This is achieved through the rational elevation of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the HZSM-5 support, which facilitates the dispersion of Zn species and reduces side reactions. The small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are proposed as active phases that enhance the catalytic performance. These catalysts offer a promising solution for industrial propylene production, addressing both economic and environmental concerns.
