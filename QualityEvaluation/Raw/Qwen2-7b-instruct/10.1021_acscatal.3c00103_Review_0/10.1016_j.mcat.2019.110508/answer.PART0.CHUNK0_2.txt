<question>Why is the acidity of the Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst important for PDH, and how does the high-silica HZSM-5 support affect this property?</question>
<li>The acidity of the Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is important for PDH as it can significantly improve propylene selectivity by suppressing side reactions. The high-silica HZSM-5 support has low acidity, which positively affects propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions.</li>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The acidity of the Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is crucial for PDH because it can substantially enhance propylene selectivity by curbing side reactions. The high-silica HZSM-5 support, with its low acidity, positively impacts propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by facilitating propylene desorption and reducing side reactions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
Zn/HZSM-5催化剂的酸性对于PDH至关重要，因为它可以显著提高丙烯选择性并抑制副反应。高硅HZSM-5支持物具有低酸性，这一特性正向影响丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性，通过促进丙烯脱附并减少副反应来实现。
