[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products."
[2] "However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."
[3] "Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."
[4] "Zn is generally regarded as an effective promoter of Pt based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation to help improve the catalytic activity and stability."
[5] "In this work, ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites (Zn/xHZSM-5, where x represents SiO2/Al2O3 ratio) were prepared by using impregnation method and tested in PDH."
[6] "As a result, ZnO supported on the HZSM-5 zeolite with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (250) exhibited much better selectivity toward propylene and stability compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios."
[7] "The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."
[8] "Comprehensive techniques including N2 sorption, XRD, SEM, TEM, DR UVvis, XPS, C3H6-TPD, NH3-TPD and TGA jointly evidence that the high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions."
[9] "Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites."
[10] "The facile and highly effective ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is environmentally friendly, low-cost and easy to be prepared, representing a promising propane dehydrogenation catalyst."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative pathway to produce propylene from propane. Traditional methods often involve expensive and toxic catalysts like platinum and chromium oxide, which hinder their widespread industrial application. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on developing low-cost, green, and stable catalyst systems for PDH. Zinc (Zn) is recognized as an effective promoter for Pt-based catalysts, enhancing their activity and stability. In this study, researchers have designed ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites, which demonstrate superior selectivity and stability in PDH compared to those with lower silica-alumina ratios. These catalysts exhibit a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after 10 hours of reaction. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite provides a suitable environment for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. It is proposed that small ZnO clusters directly connected to the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite act as active phases, contributing to the catalyst's effectiveness. This ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is environmentally friendly, low-cost, and reusable, representing a promising approach for industrial propylene production.
