In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a more efficient and potentially lower-cost alternative to conventional methods. These techniques aim to convert propane directly into propylene, thereby enhancing the supply of this valuable chemical feedstock. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. Specifically, researchers have focused on utilizing ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite. This material provides superior structural and acidic properties, enabling better dispersion of Zn species and reducing side reactions. The high-silica HZSM-5 supports ZnO catalysts efficiently, leading to enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability. This approach offers a promising solution for PDH, contributing to the sustainable and efficient production of propylene.
