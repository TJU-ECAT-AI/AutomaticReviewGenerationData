In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by converting propane into propylene more efficiently and economically. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies. Specifically, they are focusing on:

1. Utilizing transition metal catalysts with optimized properties that are determined by the characteristics of the support material, aiming for low-cost and green systems that offer good stability.

2. Employing ZnO as a catalyst, which is known for its Lewis acidic properties, capable of facilitating heterolytic CH bond cleavage and simultaneously inhibiting the rupture of CC bonds. This is done by dispersing Zn species effectively across the support material.

3. Using high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite as a support, which provides a suitable acidic environment, good structural properties, and a sparse distribution of Al sites. This allows for better dispersion of Zn species and reduces the likelihood of aggregation into bulk ZnO on the surface.

4. Analyzing the distribution and forms of Zn species, as well as identifying the nature of active Zn species through various characterization techniques, to optimize the catalytic performance.

5. Designing catalysts that are environmentally friendly, low-cost, and reusable, thereby offering a promising solution for industrial propylene production.

These strategies not only improve the efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes but also contribute to the development of more versatile and robust transition metal catalysts for propylene production.

在丙烯工业需求增长和传统生产方法限制的背景下，PDH技术通过更高效和经济地将丙烷转化为丙烯来应对这些挑战。为了克服失活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。具体而言：

1. 利用具有优化特性的过渡金属催化剂，其性能由支持材料的特性确定，旨在实现低成本和绿色系统，并提供良好的稳定性。

2. 使用ZnO作为催化剂，因其具有Lewis酸性质，能够促进CH键的异裂并同时抑制CC键的断裂。通过有效地在支持材料中分散Zn物种来实现这一目标。

3. 使用高硅含量的HZSM-5沸石作为支撑，提供合适的酸性环境、良好的结构特性和稀疏的Al位点分布。这有助于更好地分散Zn物种并减少表面聚集为粗大的ZnO。

4. 分析Zn物种的分布和形式，以及确定活性Zn物种的性质，通过各种表征技术进行优化，以优化催化性能。

5. 设计环保、低成本且可重复使用的催化剂，从而为工业丙烯生产提供有前景的解决方案。

这些策略不仅提高了PDH过程的效率和可持续性，而且也为开发更多多用途和稳定的过渡金属催化剂贡献了力量。
