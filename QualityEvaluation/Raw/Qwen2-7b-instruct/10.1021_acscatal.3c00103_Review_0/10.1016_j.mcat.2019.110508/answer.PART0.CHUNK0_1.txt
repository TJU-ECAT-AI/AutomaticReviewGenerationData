[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products."
[2] "However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."
[3] "In short, isolated Zn2+ species and small bonded ZnO clusters were both reported to serve as LAS which were able to facilitate the heterolytic CH bond cleavage and simultaneously depressed the rupture of CC bond."
[4] "It is widely known that the catalytic activity of transition metal catalyst is greatly determined by the properties of supports, while the researches on ZnO catalysts supported on various materials in PDH are not enough."
[5] "The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."
[6] "As a result, the catalytic performance and reaction stability of the ZnO catalysts increase as rationally elevating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support."
[7] "Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites."
[8] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by converting propane to propylene efficiently. Traditional methods often use costly catalysts such as PtSn and CrOx, which hinder their widespread industrial applications due to high costs and toxicity. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome these issues by developing more cost-effective, non-toxic, and reusable catalysts. In particular, ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite are shown to have high catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in PDH processes. This is achieved through the rational elevation of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the HZSM-5 support, which facilitates the dispersion of Zn species and reduces side reactions. The small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are proposed as active phases that enhance the catalytic performance. These catalysts offer a promising solution for industrial propylene production, addressing both economic and environmental concerns.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法限制的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯来解决这些挑战。传统的生产方法经常使用成本高昂且有毒的催化剂，如PtSn和CrOx，这阻碍了它们在工业中的广泛应用。创新的催化剂设计策略旨在克服这些问题，通过开发更经济、无毒且可重复使用的催化剂。特别是，通过高硅含量的HZSM-5分子筛支持的ZnO催化剂，在PDH过程中表现出高催化活性、稳定性和可回收性。这得益于对HZSM-5支撑材料的SiO2/Al2O3比例的合理提升，这有助于分散Zn物种并减少副反应。直接连接到HZSM-5骨架的小ZnO簇被提议为活性相，可以增强催化性能。这些催化剂为工业丙烯生产提供了有前景的解决方案，同时解决了经济和环境问题。
