[1] "The activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts are strong functions of the morphology of the catalytic active phase, which governs both the density and type of active sites."
[2] "To realize materials with the desired reactivity, cutting-edge catalysts are often the product of novel synthetic strategies and advanced computational studies. Combining these approaches allows for the prediction and fabrication of active motifs in a directed manner."
[3] "Unfortunately, catalyst sintering, or processes in which active surface area is lost due to irreversible agglomeration of atomic species or particles, inevitably leads to reduced active surface area and decreased catalytic activity."
[4] "To highlight the importance of fundamental mechanistic understanding of sintering processes, the first portion of this perspective highlights recent approaches to characterize sintering dynamics in heterogeneous catalysts."
[5] "We believe that by reviewing examples with mechanistic understanding of these aging phenomena, we can select approaches with the highest probability of successful application to new catalytic systems."

The document discusses the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind catalyst sintering, which is a process that leads to the loss of active surface area and decreased catalytic activity. It highlights the need for fundamental understanding of these processes to develop effective strategies for preventing sintering and maintaining the stability of catalysts. The document outlines various approaches, including chemical and physical methods, that can be used to mitigate sintering mechanisms. These strategies aim to balance considerations such as mass transfer and dispersion to ensure that the catalysts remain stable under reaction conditions. By gaining insight into the transient phenomena of catalyst sintering, researchers can design more resilient materials that are capable of maintaining their catalytic properties over extended periods of time.
