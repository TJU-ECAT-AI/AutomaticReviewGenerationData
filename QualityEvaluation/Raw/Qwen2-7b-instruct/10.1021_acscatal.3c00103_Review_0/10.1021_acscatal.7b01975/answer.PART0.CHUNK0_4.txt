[1] "The activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts are strong functions of the morphology of the catalytic active phase, which governs both the density and type of active sites."
[2] "To realize materials with the desired reactivity, cutting-edge catalysts are often the product of novel synthetic strategies and advanced computational studies."
[3] "However, catalyst active phases are ordinarily in the nanometer or atomic regime, and small morphological changes can result in large differences in catalytic properties."
[4] "Given painstaking efforts to design and fabricate active materials at the nanoscale, it is essential that these engineered structures and superior catalytic properties are preserved during working conditions."
[5] "Unfortunately, catalyst sintering, or processes in which active surface area is lost due to irreversible agglomeration of atomic species or particles, inevitably leads to reduced active surface area and decreased catalytic activity."
[6] "To highlight the importance of fundamental mechanistic understanding of sintering processes, the first portion of this perspective highlights recent approaches to characterize sintering dynamics in heterogeneous catalysts."

To address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are being developed with innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The document emphasizes the importance of understanding the morphology of the catalytic active phase, as it significantly influences the density and type of active sites, determining the reactivity of the catalysts. Novel synthetic strategies and computational studies are employed to create cutting-edge catalysts. However, the nanoscale nature of these active phases poses a challenge, as small morphological changes can drastically affect catalytic properties. Therefore, it is crucial to preserve engineered structures and superior catalytic properties during operational conditions. The document highlights the detrimental effects of catalyst sintering, which leads to a loss of active surface area and decreased catalytic activity. To gain insight into the sintering processes, recent approaches to characterize sintering dynamics in heterogeneous catalysts are discussed.
