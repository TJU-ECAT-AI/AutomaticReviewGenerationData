[1] "The activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts are strong functions of the morphology of the catalytic active phase, which governs both the density and type of active sites. To realize materials with the desired reactivity, cutting-edge catalysts are often the product of novel synthetic strategies and advanced computational studies. Combining these approaches allows for the prediction and fabrication of active motifs in a directed manner."
[2] "Unfortunately, catalyst active phases are ordinarily in the nanometer or atomic regime, and small morphological changes can result in large differences in catalytic properties."
[3] "To highlight the importance of fundamental mechanistic understanding of sintering processes, the first portion of this perspective highlights recent approaches to characterize sintering dynamics in heterogeneous catalysts."
[4] "Our goal is to stimulate more work both on the fundamental understanding of sintering mechanisms, and on the production of stable catalysts by directly targeting and suppressing specific sintering processes."

In addressing the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding and predicting the morphology of the catalytic active phase to ensure the desired reactivity. Novel synthetic strategies and advanced computational studies are combined to fabricate catalysts with targeted active motifs. Recognizing the nanometer or atomic regime of catalyst active phases, attention is paid to the significance of small morphological changes in catalytic properties. Fundamental mechanistic understanding of sintering processes is highlighted as crucial for developing stable catalysts that can directly target and suppress specific sintering processes.
