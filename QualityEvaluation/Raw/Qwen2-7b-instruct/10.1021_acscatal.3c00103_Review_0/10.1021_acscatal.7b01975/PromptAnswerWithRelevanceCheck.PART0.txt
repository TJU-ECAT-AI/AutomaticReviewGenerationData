[1] "The activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts are strong functions of the morphology of the catalytic active phase, which governs both the density and type of active sites. To realize materials with the desired reactivity, cutting-edge catalysts are often the product of novel synthetic strategies and advanced computational studies. Combining these approaches allows for the prediction and fabrication of active motifs in a directed manner."
[2] "Unfortunately, catalyst active phases are ordinarily in the nanometer or atomic regime, and small morphological changes can result in large differences in catalytic properties."
[3] "To highlight the importance of fundamental mechanistic understanding of sintering processes, the first portion of this perspective highlights recent approaches to characterize sintering dynamics in heterogeneous catalysts."
[4] "Our goal is to stimulate more work both on the fundamental understanding of sintering mechanisms, and on the production of stable catalysts by directly targeting and suppressing specific sintering processes."
