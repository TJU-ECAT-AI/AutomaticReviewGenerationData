[1] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[2] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."
[4] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility."
[5] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be efficient for enhancing the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[6] "Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
[7] "This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."
[8] "The active sites of CoOx@NC/S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
[9] "In order to understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) were investigated using in situ FT-IR."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative pathway to produce propene from propane. Traditional PDH processes often rely on catalysts containing chromium and platinum, both of which have significant drawbacks such as toxicity and high cost, respectively. Cobalt-based catalysts, on the other hand, are considered promising alternatives due to their abundance and potential for long-term utility in PDH applications. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, innovative catalyst design strategies, particularly focusing on active site isolation, are being developed. One such strategy involves synthesizing spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite. This approach leads to a catalyst that demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance for PDH, with a high propane conversion rate of 40% and a high propene selectivity exceeding 97%. No significant deactivation is observed even after prolonged operation at high temperatures, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of this novel catalyst design. Through a series of characterization techniques and investigations into both the forward PDH process and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation), the active sites and reaction mechanisms of cobalt species in PDH are elucidated, contributing to a deeper understanding of the catalytic process and paving the way for further advancements in PDH technology.
