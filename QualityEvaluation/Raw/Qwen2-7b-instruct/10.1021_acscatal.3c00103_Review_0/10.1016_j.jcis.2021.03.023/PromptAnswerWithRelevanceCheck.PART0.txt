To address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques focus on utilizing catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propene at high temperatures, typically above 500°C. Traditional methods rely on catalysts like Cr/Al2O3 for the Catofin process and PtSn/Al2O3 for the Oleflex process, but these suffer from drawbacks such as the toxicity of chromium and the high cost of platinum. Cobalt-based catalysts show promise due to the abundance of cobalt. To improve upon existing catalysts, researchers have developed strategies to isolate active sites, aiming to enhance stability, prevent aggregation, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The innovation described in the literature involves synthesizing spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite. This approach leads to a catalyst that exhibits high propane conversion and exceptional propene selectivity, with no significant deactivation observed even after 10 hours of operation at 600°C. By employing in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the mechanism of PDH on this catalyst was elucidated, revealing insights into its active sites and reaction pathways.

为应对工业对丙烯需求的增加以及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术侧重于利用能够高效将丙烷转化为丙烯的催化剂，在通常高于500°C的温度下进行。传统的生产方法依赖于Cr/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin过程和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的Oleflex过程，但这些方法存在铬的毒性问题和铂的高昂成本。钴基催化剂显示出前景，因为钴的储量丰富。为了改进现有的催化剂，研究人员开发了隔离活性位点的方法，旨在提高稳定性、防止聚集并改善氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中的可回收性。文献中描述的创新涉及在硅铝酸盐-1沸石上合成氮掺杂碳层内的空间隔离钴氧化物位点。这种方法导致了一种催化剂，其丙烷转化率高且丙烯选择性出色，在600°C运行10小时后并未观察到明显的失活现象。通过原位傅里叶变换红外光谱法，揭示了该催化剂的活性位点和反应途径机制，提供了有关其活性位点和反应途径的见解。

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative method to produce propene from propane. Traditional PDH processes often rely on chromium- or platinum-based catalysts, which can be toxic and expensive, respectively. Cobalt-based catalysts are seen as a promising alternative due to their earth abundance and potential for long-term utility. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as active site isolation, aim to enhance stability, prevent deactivation, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies involve confining isolated metal sites within nitrogen-doped carbon materials to stabilize metal species and prevent aggregation. The use of this approach leads to catalysts that demonstrate high propane conversion and selectivity for propene production, even under harsh operating conditions, thus addressing the challenges posed by traditional PDH processes.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative pathway to produce propylene from propane. Traditional PDH processes often rely on catalysts containing toxic chromium (Cr) or expensive platinum (Pt), which restrict their widespread use and sustainability. Cobalt-based catalysts, particularly those with isolated active sites, offer a promising alternative due to their earth abundance and potential for enhanced catalytic performance. The innovative catalyst design strategy discussed in the literature involves the synthesis of spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1). This catalyst exhibits exceptional PDH performance, with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity greater than 97%, even after a 10-hour reaction at 600°C. The in situ FT-IR spectroscopy indicates that the same intermediate product (Co-C3H7) is present during both propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation, suggesting a reverse reaction process.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route to produce propylene from propane, which avoids the high cost and environmental impact associated with conventional methods that rely on chromium and platinum catalysts. Innovations in catalyst design, particularly focusing on cobalt-based catalysts supported on specific materials like silicalite-1 zeolite, aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. These catalysts, such as CoOx@NC/S-1, demonstrate high propane conversion efficiency (40%) with exceptional propene selectivity (97%) and maintain this performance over time, even after prolonged operation at high temperatures (600°C). The spatial isolation of cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers on the zeolite surface is crucial for achieving such high performance, as it allows for the stabilization of the active sites and prevents aggregation, thus maintaining their reactivity and selectivity for PDH.
