<p>Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile.</p>
<p>The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH).</p>
<p>Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility.</p>
<p>Li et al. reported that the surface Co spinel formed by the tetracoordinated Co(II) sites on Al2O3 support under reaction condition was accounted for catalyzing PDH reaction, while large metallic Co particles formed by the reduction of Co3O4 crystallites during PDH were conducive to cracking reaction.</p>
<p>The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed.</p>
<p>Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis.</p>
<p>Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere.</p>
<p>The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C.</p>
<p>In order to understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) were investigated using in situ FT-IR.</p>

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative method to produce propene from propane. Traditional PDH processes often rely on chromium- or platinum-based catalysts, which can be toxic and expensive, respectively. Cobalt-based catalysts are seen as a promising alternative due to their earth abundance and potential for long-term utility. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as active site isolation, aim to enhance stability, prevent deactivation, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies involve confining isolated metal sites within nitrogen-doped carbon materials to stabilize metal species and prevent aggregation. The use of this approach leads to catalysts that demonstrate high propane conversion and selectivity for propene production, even under harsh operating conditions, thus addressing the challenges posed by traditional PDH processes.

针对工业对丙烯日益增长的需求以及传统生产方法的限制，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种从丙烷生产丙烯的替代方法来应对这些挑战。传统的PDH过程通常依赖于含铬或铂的催化剂，这些催化剂可能有毒或昂贵。钴基催化剂因其地球丰富性和长期实用性被视为有前景的替代方案。创新的催化剂设计策略，如活性位点隔离，旨在增强稳定性、防止失活并提高氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中可回收性。这些策略涉及在氮掺杂碳材料中封装孤立金属位点以稳定金属物种并防止聚集。使用这种方法导致的催化剂能够表现出高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，即使在苛刻的操作条件下也是如此，从而解决了传统PDH过程面临的挑战。
