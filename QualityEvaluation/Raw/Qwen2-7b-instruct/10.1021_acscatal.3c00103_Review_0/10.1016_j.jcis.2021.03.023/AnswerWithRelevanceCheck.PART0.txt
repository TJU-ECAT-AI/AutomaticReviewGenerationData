          "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
          "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."
          "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility."

          In the face of rising industrial demand for propylene and the constraints posed by traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are being employed as an alternative means to produce propylene from propane. Traditional PDH processes typically depend on catalysts containing hazardous chromium or costly platinum, which limit their widespread application and sustainability. Cobalt-based catalysts, especially those with isolated active sites, are considered promising alternatives due to their abundant nature and potential for improved catalytic performance. Innovations in catalyst design, including the isolation of active sites, aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

          针对工业对丙烯需求的增长以及传统生产方法的限制，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术作为从丙烷生产丙烯的替代途径得到了关注。传统的PDH过程往往依赖于含铬或铂的催化剂，这两种物质不仅有害且价格昂贵，限制了PDH产业的发展，迫切需要新的催化剂。钴基催化剂，特别是具有孤立活性位点的催化剂，因其丰富性以及可能的催化性能提升而被视为有前景的选择。在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中，通过活性位点隔离等创新催化剂设计策略旨在克服失活问题、提高稳定性并改善循环利用性。

          "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be efficient for enhancing the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          "Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
          "This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."
          "The active sites of CoOx@NC/S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
          "In order to understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) were investigated using in situ FT-IR."

          The active site isolation strategy has proven effective in enhancing the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation (PDH). A novel catalyst, CoOx@NC/S-1, was synthesized through a two-step process involving the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded onto silicalite-1 under nitrogen, followed by calcination in air. This catalyst exhibits outstanding PDH performance, with a 40% propane conversion rate and a propene selectivity exceeding 97%. Notably, the catalyst maintains its activity without significant deactivation after a 10-hour reaction at 600°C. The active sites on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst were confirmed through a series of characterization techniques, including hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction, diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst was explored by examining both the forward PDH process and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

          活性位点隔离策略已被证明能有效提升丙烷脱氢（PDH）的催化性能。通过两步过程合成了新型催化剂CoOx@NC/S-1，包括在氮气下对双金属Zn/Co Zeolitic Imidazole Frameworks负载在硅铝酸盐-1上的预处理，随后在空气中进行煅烧。该催化剂展现出卓越的PDH性能，丙烷转化率达到40%，丙烯选择性超过97%。值得注意的是，即使在600°C下运行10小时后，催化剂的活性也未出现明显衰减。通过一系列表征技术，包括氢气温度程序还原、漫反射紫外可见光谱和X射线光电子能谱，确认了CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂上的活性位点。此外，通过原位傅里叶变换红外光谱研究了PDH过程在CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂上的机制，包括正向PDH过程及其微观逆过程（丙烯氢化）。
