[1] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[2] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."
[4] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility."
[5] "In recent years, Co species supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation, but the selectivity of propene is not optimistic."
[6] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed."
[7] "Hu et al. synthesized tetrahedral Co2+ supported on silica by grafting CoIII(NH3)6Cl3 from ammonium hydroxide solution, which was highly selective toward propene."
[8] "Copret et al. prepared isolated cobalt oxide on a silica surface by surface organometallic chemistry method, which also showed high selectivity for propene."
[9] "However, the propane conversion was severely decreased due to the high surface free energy of the isolated Co sites."
[10] "Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis."
[11] "Zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), are composed of metal-containing nodes and organic linkers, which have been considered as suitable precursors for the synthesis of metal sites confined in N-doped carbon by pyrolysis."
[12] "Subsequently, the secondary metals are selectively removed in situ, and isolated metal sites confined in N-doped carbon materials can be synthesized during the pyrolysis process."
[13] "Nevertheless, there is no report on the N-doped carbon materials encaged isolated metal sites catalyst applied for PDH with excellent propene selectivity and catalytic stability, not mention to the study of the active sites and reaction mechanism of Co species for PDH reaction."
[14] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
[15] "The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."
[16] "The active sites of CoOx@NC/S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
[17] "In order to understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) were investigated using in situ FT-IR."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route to produce propylene from propane, which avoids the high cost and environmental impact associated with conventional methods that rely on chromium and platinum catalysts. Innovations in catalyst design, particularly focusing on cobalt-based catalysts supported on specific materials like silicalite-1 zeolite, aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. These catalysts, such as CoOx@NC/S-1, demonstrate high propane conversion efficiency (40%) with exceptional propene selectivity (97%) and maintain this performance over time, even after prolonged operation at high temperatures (600°C). The spatial isolation of cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers on the zeolite surface is crucial for achieving such high performance, as it allows for the stabilization of the active sites and prevents aggregation, thus maintaining their reactivity and selectivity for PDH.

针对工业对丙烯日益增长的需求以及传统生产方法的限制，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供从丙烷生产丙烯的替代途径，解决了这些挑战。这种方法避免了传统依赖铬和铂催化剂的工艺所带来的高成本和环境影响。在催化剂设计上的创新，特别是钴基催化剂在特定材料如沸石硅1型上的应用，旨在克服失活问题、提高稳定性并改善可回收性。例如，CoOx@NC/S-1这类催化剂表现出40%的丙烷转化率和高达97%的丙烯选择性，并且在长时间（10小时）在600°C下运行后，其性能保持稳定。空间隔离钴氧化物位点在氮掺杂碳层上沸石表面对于实现如此高的性能至关重要，它允许活性位点的稳定化，防止聚集，从而保持其PDH过程中的反应性和选择性。
