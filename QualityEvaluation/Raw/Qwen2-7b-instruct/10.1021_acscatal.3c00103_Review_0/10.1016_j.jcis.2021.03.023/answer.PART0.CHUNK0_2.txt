Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative pathway to produce propylene from propane. Traditional PDH processes often rely on catalysts containing toxic chromium (Cr) or expensive platinum (Pt), which restrict their widespread use and sustainability. Cobalt-based catalysts, particularly those with isolated active sites, offer a promising alternative due to their earth abundance and potential for enhanced catalytic performance. The innovative catalyst design strategy discussed in the literature involves the synthesis of spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1). This catalyst exhibits exceptional PDH performance, with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity greater than 97%, even after a 10-hour reaction at 600°C. The in situ FT-IR spectroscopy indicates that the same intermediate product (Co-C3H7) is present during both propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation, suggesting a reverse reaction process.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供从丙烷生产丙烯的替代途径，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加以及传统生产方法限制的问题。传统的PDH过程通常依赖于含毒性铬（Cr）或昂贵铂（Pt）的催化剂，这限制了它们的广泛应用和可持续性。基于钴的催化剂，尤其是具有孤立活性位点的催化剂，由于其地球丰富性和潜在的催化性能增强潜力，提供了有前景的替代方案。文献中讨论的创新催化剂设计策略涉及在硅铝酸盐-1沸石上合成氮掺杂碳层内的孤立钴氧化物位点（CoOx@NC/S-1）。该催化剂表现出卓越的PDH性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性大于97%，即使在600°C反应10小时后也未观察到明显的失活现象。原位FT-IR光谱显示，在丙烷脱氢和丙烯氢化过程中均存在相同的中间产物（Co-C3H7），表明存在一个逆向反应过程。
