<p>The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH).</p>
<p>Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility.</p>
<p>In recent years, Co species supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation, but the selectivity of propene is not optimistic.</p>
<p>The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed.</p>
<p>Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis.</p>
<p>Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere.</p>
<p>The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C.</p>
<p>To understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) were investigated using in situ FT-IR.</p>

To address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques focus on utilizing catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propene at high temperatures, typically above 500°C. Traditional methods rely on catalysts like Cr/Al2O3 for the Catofin process and PtSn/Al2O3 for the Oleflex process, but these suffer from drawbacks such as the toxicity of chromium and the high cost of platinum. Cobalt-based catalysts show promise due to the abundance of cobalt. To improve upon existing catalysts, researchers have developed strategies to isolate active sites, aiming to enhance stability, prevent aggregation, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The innovation described in the literature involves synthesizing spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite. This approach leads to a catalyst that exhibits high propane conversion and exceptional propene selectivity, with no significant deactivation observed even after 10 hours of operation at 600°C. By employing in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the mechanism of PDH on this catalyst was elucidated, revealing insights into its active sites and reaction pathways.

为应对工业对丙烯需求的增加以及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术侧重于利用能够高效将丙烷转化为丙烯的催化剂，在通常高于500°C的温度下进行。传统的生产方法依赖于Cr/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin过程和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的Oleflex过程，但这些方法存在铬的毒性问题和铂的高昂成本。钴基催化剂显示出前景，因为钴的储量丰富。为了改进现有的催化剂，研究人员开发了隔离活性位点的方法，旨在提高稳定性、防止聚集并改善氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中的可回收性。文献中描述的创新涉及在硅铝酸盐-1沸石上合成氮掺杂碳层内的空间隔离钴氧化物位点。这种方法导致了一种催化剂，其丙烷转化率高且丙烯选择性出色，在600°C运行10小时后并未观察到明显的失活现象。通过原位傅里叶变换红外光谱法，揭示了该催化剂的活性位点和反应途径机制，提供了有关其活性位点和反应途径的见解。
