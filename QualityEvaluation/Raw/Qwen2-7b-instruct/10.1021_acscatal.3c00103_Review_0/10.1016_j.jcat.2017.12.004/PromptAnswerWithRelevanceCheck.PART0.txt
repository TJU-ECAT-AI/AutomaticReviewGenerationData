<p>The lower olefins, especially propene, are essential petrochemical intermediates, widely used in the production of various chemicals. Propene is mainly produced through steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), while non-oxidative dehydrogenation (PDH) offers an attractive alternative due to the growing demand for propene and its derivatives.</p>
<p>Vanadium-based catalysts are considered potential alternatives to platinum- and chromium-based catalysts for commercial PDH, offering reasonable pricing and environmental friendliness. They have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, with their performance significantly affected by the support materials used, such as silica, zirconia, and aluminum oxide.</p>
<p>Porous VOX-SiO2 solids were synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures through an in-situ one-step synthesis method and evaluated by non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The catalysts' structure-performance relationship indicates that an increase in gelation temperature over a certain temperature range (60°C) has a slight influence on catalytic performance and remarkably shortens the gelation process time during one-step synthesis.</p>
<p>Note that when the catalyst is gelled above the boiling point of ethanol (78.3°C), the structure and performance of porous VOX-SiO2 solids are remarkably changed, particularly for the catalyst gelled at 90°C. Additionally, the catalyst calcined at 580°C exhibits superior stability, and a higher calcination temperature obviously influences structural properties and catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, investigated in this study, exhibits excellent long-term stability. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4h reaction, and the propene selectivity remains constant at around 91% over the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH.</p>

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route for propylene production that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and reduces carbon deposition. This is particularly useful in oxidative dehydrogenation processes (ODHP), which generate by-products due to deep oxidation of propene. Non-oxidative PDH processes, such as those utilizing vanadium (V)-based catalysts, offer several advantages over traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. V-based catalysts are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, making them suitable alternatives for commercial PDH processes. Research has focused on developing novel catalysts for PDH, including those based on gallium (Ga) and tin (Sn), which can potentially overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability.

The design of innovative catalysts for PDH involves the selection of appropriate supports and the optimization of synthesis parameters. For instance, porous VOX-SiO2 solids have been synthesized through an in-situ one-step method at different gelation and calcination temperatures. This approach allows for the adjustment of catalyst properties while maintaining efficiency. The gelation temperature significantly affects the structure and performance of the catalysts, with a moderate increase leading to improved yield and shortened synthesis time. However, gelation temperatures exceeding the boiling point of ethanol can negatively impact the catalyst's structure and performance. Calcination temperature also plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's stability and structural properties. The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, which was synthesized at a gelation temperature of 60°C and calcination temperature of 580°C, demonstrated excellent long-term stability, with a slow decrease in propane conversion and constant propene selectivity across multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

This research contributes to the development of more efficient and sustainable PDH processes, which could lead to advancements in the petrochemical industry and contribute to the global demand for propylene.

PDH催化剂设计涉及选择合适的支撑物并优化合成参数。例如，通过原位一步法合成了不同凝胶化温度和煅烧温度的多孔VOX-SiO2固体。这种方法允许调整催化剂的性质，同时保持效率。凝胶化温度显著影响催化剂的结构和性能，适度增加可以提高产率并缩短合成时间。然而，凝胶化温度超过乙醇沸点（78.3°C）可能会对催化剂的结构和性能产生负面影响。煅烧温度也对催化剂的稳定性及其结构特性起着关键作用。在60°C的凝胶化温度和580°C的煅烧温度下合成的60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂表现出卓越的长期稳定性，在多个反应再生周期内，丙烷转化率缓慢下降至45%，而丙烯选择性保持在约91%不变。

这项研究有助于开发更高效和可持续的PDH过程，这可能导致石油化工行业的进步，并为全球对丙烯的需求做出贡献。

<p>Compared with the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst obtained by a one-step hydrothermal method, VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized by the in-situ one-step method show markedly superior catalytic performance, except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. VOX-MCM-41 achieved 40% initial propane conversion and 79% propene selectivity, as shown in Fig. 2.</p>
<p>Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows higher initial propane conversion, propene selectivity, and catalytic stability than the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst. Xue et al. also reported the non-oxidation propane dehydrogenation of the 5.2V-MSNSs catalyst, which obtained 46% initial propane conversion and 80% propene selectivity.</p>
<p>The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability for PDH, which is beneficial for large-scale industrial experimentation with PDH.</p>
<p>In addition to gelation temperature, calcination temperature is another crucial factor for synthesizing VOX-SiO2 catalysts and plays an essential role in the structure and properties of these catalysts.</p>
<p>As calcination temperature increases, propane conversion gradually decreases, but propene selectivity slightly increases. The variation trends of propane conversion and propene selectivity are similar to those found in other studies.</p>
<p>The VOX-SiO2 catalyst gelation process may have a proportional gelation-temperature tipping point. Hence, the structural and catalytic properties of catalysts may show an obvious change after the tipping point; this point may be at approximately 60C based on catalytic performance for PDH.</p>
<p>The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows higher propene selectivity due to its higher calcination temperature, which leads to a more stable catalyst structure.</p>
<p>The spent 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts after the first and eighth cycle are denoted as the R-1 Cycle and the R-8 Cycle, respectively. The conversion of the catalyst slowly decreases with time and maintains at 30% after 10h reaction. The result suggests that V-SiO2 catalysts have good stability in this work.</p>
<p>These results indicate that the VOX-SiO2 catalyst with 60C gelation temperature and 580C calcination temperature exhibits superior long-term stability for PDH reaction.</p>

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative approach to produce propene without relying solely on conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking methods. PDH processes are particularly advantageous as they can be implemented without deepening the oxidation of propene, which avoids generating by-products that are often associated with the oxidative dehydrogenation process. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, researchers are developing innovative catalyst designs. These strategies involve the synthesis of catalysts with tailored properties, such as dispersion and stability of active metal species, and the utilization of support materials that can modulate the reaction environment and prevent catalyst deactivation. In this study, porous VOX-SiO2 solids were synthesized through an in-situ one-step method, which not only improves the efficiency of the synthesis process but also allows for the optimization of the gelation and calcination temperatures to tailor the catalyst's performance. The VOX-SiO2 catalysts showed marked superiority in catalytic performance compared to other catalysts, such as VOX-MCM-41, especially when the gelation temperature was set at 60°C. This catalyst demonstrated exceptional stability and long-term catalytic activity during repeated reaction-regeneration cycles, making it a promising candidate for large-scale industrial experimentation and application in PDH processes. By understanding the relationships between the structure and performance of these catalysts, researchers can develop more efficient and sustainable catalysts that contribute to the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法的局限性进行背景介绍时，PDH技术通过提供一种替代方法来解决这些挑战。与仅依赖蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解等传统方法相比，PDH过程特别有优势，因为它可以在不加深丙烯氧化的情况下生产丙烯，从而避免生成通常与氧化脱氢过程相关的副产品。为了克服催化剂失活、提高稳定性和增强可循环利用性，在PDH过程中，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略包括定制催化剂的性质，如活性金属物种的分散和稳定性，并利用支持材料调节反应环境，防止催化剂失活。在这项研究中，通过原位一步法合成了具有多孔结构的VOX-SiO2固体，不仅提高了合成过程的效率，而且还允许通过调整凝胶化和煅烧温度来优化催化剂的性能。与VOX-MCM-41等其他催化剂相比，VOX-SiO2催化剂显示出了显著的催化性能优势，尤其是在凝胶化温度设置为60°C的情况下。这种催化剂在反复反应再生周期中显示出极佳的稳定性以及长期的催化活性，使其成为大型工业实验和PDH过程应用的有前景候选者。通过理解这些催化剂结构与性能之间的关系，研究人员可以开发出更高效和可持续的催化剂，这将有助于多孔VOX-SiO2固体在催化领域的工业发展和应用。

<p>Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used.</p>
<p>Moreover, catalyst performance was strongly affected when different supports, such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, were used.</p>
<p>To the authors' knowledge, the use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH.</p>
<p>A mesoporous silica monolith has been reported and possesses superior textural properties, but needs a lengthy gelation period at room temperature (at least six weeks).</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yang et al. shortened the solvent evaporation process by using a liquid-paraffin medium to seal the ethanol solution, meaning that the prepared silica monolith can exactly copy the shape of the reactor.</p>
<p>The preparation method is environmentally-friendly, without loss of the VOX precursor.</p>
<p>By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration.</p>
<p>Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process.</p>
<p>The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOX-SiO2 catalysts for PDH reaction was studied in detail.</p>
<p>The prepared VOX-SiO2 catalysts were characterized using a variety of state-of-the-art techniques and evaluated by a non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>As gelation temperature increases, the pore volume and surface area of catalysts decrease, whereas the pore size shows no obvious variation except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst.</p>
<p>The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of 60-VOX-SiO2 catalysts with different calcination temperatures vary obviously with increasing temperature.</p>
<p>When the calcination temperature is 580C, the pore volume and surface area of the catalyst (60-VOX-SiO2-580) decrease slightly compared to the catalyst at 550C.</p>
<p>However, 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits relatively better stability at 580C reaction temperature for PDH, which can be attributed to the more stable structure of the catalyst calcined at the same temperature.</p>
<p>When the calcination temperature increases to 620C, the textural properties of catalyst in terms of pore size, pore volume, and surface area are poor.</p>
<p>The Raman spectra of VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts show obvious differences with increasing gelation temperature, implying that gelation temperature has a significant influence on the distribution of VOX species.</p>
<p>The peak of V2p3/2 can be deconvoluted into two peaks at around 517.6 and 516.6eV, which can be ascribed to V5+ and V4+ species respectively.</p>
<p>The calculated Si/V molar ratios of catalysts with different gelation temperatures show no evident variation with increasing gelation temperature, but the ratio by XPS is much larger than by ICP, suggesting that VOX species are mostly dispersed into the channels of the SiO2 solids.</p>
<p>The XPS analysis reveals a relationship between the gelation temperature and the state of surface VOX species.</p>
<p>With increasing gelation temperature, V5+ species on the catalyst surface increase, but V4+ species decrease, suggesting a slight increase in the polymerization degree of VOX species.</p>
<p>Because the gelation temperature at 75C is close to the boiling point of ethanol (78.3C), when approaching or exceeding this temperature, the structure of VOX-SiO2 solids and dispersion of VOX species can be seriously influenced.</p>
<p>As calcination temperature increases, the weak-acid site peak shifts to a higher temperature, the peak intensity of medium acid sites obviously decreases, and total surface acidity gradually decreases.</p>
<p>This can explain the variation in catalyst performance with different calcination temperatures.</p>
<p>However, the catalysts calcined at 550C and 580C have similar total surface acidity and only a slight variation in weak acid sites.</p>
<p>Given the catalytic activity and stability of the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, this catalyst has been selected for further study of the long-term stability of dehydrogenation-regeneration (DH) cycles for PDH.</p>
<p>For the eighth cycle test, the propane conversion maintains an approximately 10% decrease, but the propene selectivity shows a slight increase compared to the first DH cycle, suggesting that VOX species may be more stable with longer DH cycle times and that the catalyst possesses excellent long-term stability.</p>

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for producing propylene. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), often face issues with thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and the generation of by-products. PDH offers a non-oxidative approach that avoids these issues while still meeting the demand for propylene and its derivatives. Innovative catalyst design strategies, particularly focusing on vanadium-based catalysts, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. These strategies include the use of various supports, like silica, zirconia, and aluminum oxide, and the optimization of gelation and calcination temperatures to achieve superior catalytic performance and stability.

The authors explore the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in PDH reactions. They find that increasing the gelation temperature over a certain range (up to 60°C) has a slight impact on catalytic performance and significantly reduces the gelation process time during one-step synthesis. The catalyst prepared at 60°C shortens the gelation process time by half compared to the catalyst prepared at 30°C, achieving a similar catalytic yield after 4 hours of reaction. Beyond this tipping point, typically around 75°C, the structure and performance of the porous VOX-SiO2 solids experience notable changes. Calcination temperature also plays a crucial role, with the catalyst calcined at 580°C showing superior stability. Higher calcination temperatures lead to the formation of V2O5 crystallites, which can affect the structure and catalytic performance negatively.

The VOX-SiO2 catalyst with a gelation temperature of 60°C and calcination temperature of 580°C exhibits exceptional long-term stability for PDH reactions. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% over four hours of reaction, while the propene selectivity remains constant at around 91% across eight reaction-regeneration cycles. This work contributes to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH processes, which can benefit industrial applications and catalysis in general.

在对丙烯需求增长和传统生产方法限制的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种替代方法来解决这些挑战。传统的生产方式，如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC），经常面临热力学平衡限制和副产品的生成问题。PDH提供了非氧化性途径，避免了这些问题，同时仍能满足对丙烯及其衍生物的需求。创新的催化剂设计策略，特别是针对以钒为基础的催化剂，正在开发中，以克服活性衰减、提高稳定性并改善循环再生性，尤其是在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中。

作者研究了在PDH反应中不同凝胶化温度和煅烧温度对多孔VOX-SiO2固体的性质和催化性能的影响。他们发现，在一定范围内增加凝胶化温度（最高至60°C）对催化性能影响较小，并显著缩短了一步法合成过程中的凝胶化时间。凝胶化温度为60°C的催化剂将凝胶化过程时间缩短了一半与凝胶化温度为30°C的催化剂相比，实现了4小时反应后的相似催化产率。超过这个转折点，通常接近乙醇沸点（78.3°C），当接近或超过此温度时，VOX-SiO2固体结构和VOX物种的分散性会受到严重的影响。

煅烧温度也起着关键作用，其中在580°C煅烧的催化剂表现出优越的稳定性。随着煅烧温度的升高，形成了V2O5结晶体，这可能会影响结构和催化性能。 

凝胶化温度为60°C和煅烧温度为580°C的VOX-SiO2催化剂展现出PDH反应的长期稳定性。其丙烷转化率从55%缓慢下降到45%，而丙烯选择性在整个八次反应再生周期内保持稳定，约为91%。这项工作有助于开发更高效稳定的PDH过程催化剂，这将有利于工业应用和催化领域的发展。
