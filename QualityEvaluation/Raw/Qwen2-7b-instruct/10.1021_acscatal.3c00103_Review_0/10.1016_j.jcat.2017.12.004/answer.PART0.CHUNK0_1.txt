[1] "Lower olefins are essential petrochemical intermediates, especially propene, which is widely used as a feedstock in the production of a variety of chemicals."
[2] "Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages, such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably generates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene."
[3] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used."
[4] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts."
[5] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH, are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."
[6] "In previous studies, these catalysts have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[7] "Moreover, catalyst performance was strongly affected when different supports, such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, were used."
[8] "To the authors' knowledge, the use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH."
[9] "Porous VOX-SiO2 solids were synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures through an in-situ one-step method and evaluated by non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[10] "The structure-performance relationship of VOX-SiO2 catalysts indicates that an increase in gelation temperature over a certain temperature range (60°C) has a slight influence on catalytic performance and will remarkably shorten the gelation process time during one-step synthesis."
[11] "As a result, the VOX-SiO2 catalyst gelled at 60°C shortens the gelation process time by half compared to the catalyst gelled at 30°C and obtains a similar catalytic yield after 4h reaction."
[12] "When the catalyst is gelled above the boiling point of ethanol (78.3°C), the structure and performance of porous VOX-SiO2 solids will be remarkably changed, especially for the catalyst gelled at 90°C."
[13] "In addition, the catalyst calcined at 580°C exhibits superior stability, and the higher calcination temperature will obviously influence structural properties and catalytic performance."
[14] "Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst investigated in this study exhibits excellent long-term stability. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4h reaction, and the propene selectivity remains constant at around 91% over the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH."
[15] "The work reported here would be beneficial for further industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route for propylene production that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and reduces carbon deposition. This is particularly useful in oxidative dehydrogenation processes (ODHP), which generate by-products due to deep oxidation of propene. Non-oxidative PDH processes, such as those utilizing vanadium (V)-based catalysts, offer several advantages over traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. V-based catalysts are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, making them suitable alternatives for commercial PDH processes. Research has focused on developing novel catalysts for PDH, including those based on gallium (Ga) and tin (Sn), which can potentially overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability.

The design of innovative catalysts for PDH involves the selection of appropriate supports and the optimization of synthesis parameters. For instance, porous VOX-SiO2 solids have been synthesized through an in-situ one-step method at different gelation and calcination temperatures. This approach allows for the adjustment of catalyst properties while maintaining efficiency. The gelation temperature significantly affects the structure and performance of the catalysts, with a moderate increase leading to improved yield and shortened synthesis time. However, gelation temperatures exceeding the boiling point of ethanol can negatively impact the catalyst's structure and performance. Calcination temperature also plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's stability and structural properties. The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, which was synthesized at a gelation temperature of 60°C and calcination temperature of 580°C, demonstrated excellent long-term stability, with a slow decrease in propane conversion and constant propene selectivity across multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

This research contributes to the development of more efficient and sustainable PDH processes, which could lead to advancements in the petrochemical industry and contribute to the global demand for propylene.

在对丙烯日益增长的工业需求以及传统生产方法的局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种避免热力学平衡限制并减少碳沉积的替代途径来解决这些挑战。这特别适用于氧化脱氢过程（ODHP），后者由于深度氧化丙烯而产生副产品。非氧化PDH过程，例如基于钒（V）的催化剂的使用，为传统的铂（Pt）和铬（Cr）基催化剂提供了几个优势。V基催化剂价格合理且环保，使其成为商业PDH过程的合适替代品。研究已集中于开发PDH的新催化剂，包括基于镓（Ga）和锡（Sn）的催化剂，它们可能能够克服脱活问题、增强稳定性和提高可回收性。

PDH催化剂设计涉及选择合适的支撑物并优化合成参数。例如，通过原位一步法合成了不同凝胶化温度和煅烧温度的多孔VOX-SiO2固体。这种方法允许调整催化剂的性质，同时保持效率。凝胶化温度显著影响催化剂的结构和性能，适度增加可以提高产率并缩短合成时间。然而，凝胶化温度超过乙醇沸点（78.3°C）可能会对催化剂的结构和性能产生负面影响。煅烧温度也对催化剂的稳定性及其结构特性起着关键作用。在60°C的凝胶化温度和580°C的煅烧温度下合成的60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂表现出卓越的长期稳定性，在多个反应再生周期内，丙烷转化率缓慢下降至45%，而丙烯选择性保持在约91%不变。

这项研究有助于开发更高效和可持续的PDH过程，这可能导致石油化工行业的进步，并为全球对丙烯的需求做出贡献。
