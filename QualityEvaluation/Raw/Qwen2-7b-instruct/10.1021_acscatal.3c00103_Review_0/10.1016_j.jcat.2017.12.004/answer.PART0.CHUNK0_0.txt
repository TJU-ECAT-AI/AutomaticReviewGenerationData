<p>The lower olefins, especially propene, are essential petrochemical intermediates, widely used in the production of various chemicals. Propene is mainly produced through steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), while non-oxidative dehydrogenation (PDH) offers an attractive alternative due to the growing demand for propene and its derivatives.</p>
<p>Vanadium-based catalysts are considered potential alternatives to platinum- and chromium-based catalysts for commercial PDH, offering reasonable pricing and environmental friendliness. They have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, with their performance significantly affected by the support materials used, such as silica, zirconia, and aluminum oxide.</p>
<p>Porous VOX-SiO2 solids were synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures through an in-situ one-step synthesis method and evaluated by non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The catalysts' structure-performance relationship indicates that an increase in gelation temperature over a certain temperature range (60°C) has a slight influence on catalytic performance and remarkably shortens the gelation process time during one-step synthesis.</p>
<p>Note that when the catalyst is gelled above the boiling point of ethanol (78.3°C), the structure and performance of porous VOX-SiO2 solids are remarkably changed, particularly for the catalyst gelled at 90°C. Additionally, the catalyst calcined at 580°C exhibits superior stability, and a higher calcination temperature obviously influences structural properties and catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, investigated in this study, exhibits excellent long-term stability. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4h reaction, and the propene selectivity remains constant at around 91% over the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH.</p>

To address the growing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer an attractive alternative. Vanadium-based catalysts, known for their reasonable pricing and environmental friendliness, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on optimizing gelation and calcination temperatures to tailor the structure of porous VOX-SiO2 solids, ensuring superior catalytic performance, stability, and recyclability for PDH reactions.
