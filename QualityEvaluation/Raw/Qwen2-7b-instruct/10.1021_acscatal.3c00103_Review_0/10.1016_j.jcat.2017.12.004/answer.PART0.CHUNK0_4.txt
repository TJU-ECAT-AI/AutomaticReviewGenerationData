<p>In previous studies, these catalysts have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>Moreover, catalyst performance was strongly affected when different supports, such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, were used.</p>
<p>To the authors knowledge, the use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH.</p>
<p>The prepared VOX-SiO2 catalysts were characterized using a variety of state-of-the-art techniques and evaluated by a non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows higher initial propane conversion, propene selectivity, and catalytic stability than the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst.</p>
<p>When the gelation temperature increases to 90C, the catalyst follows a hysteresis loop at high relative pressure, and the pore size becomes larger, but the pore volume and surface area are reasonably decreased, which could occur because the relatively small channels are blocked by aggregated VOX species.</p>
<p>However, 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits relatively better stability at 580C reaction temperature for PDH, which can be attributed to the more stable structure of the catalyst calcined at the same temperature.</p>
<p>Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst investigated in this study exhibits excellent long-term stability. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4h reaction, and the propene selectivity remains constant at around 91% over the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering an alternative approach that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and reduces carbon deposition.
2. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. This includes the development of catalysts with specific structures, improved dispersion of active components, and better resistance to carbon deposition.
3. Gelation temperature significantly influences the structure and performance of VOX-SiO2 catalysts, with an optimal range of 60°C for achieving desirable catalytic properties. Higher temperatures lead to decreased stability and catalytic activity.
4. Calcination temperature plays a crucial role in the structure and properties of VOX-SiO2 catalysts, impacting their stability and catalytic performance. Catalysts calcined at 580°C exhibit superior stability, particularly in the PDH process.
5. The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst demonstrates remarkable long-term stability in PDH reactions, showing a slow decrease in propane conversion while maintaining a constant propene selectivity across multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.
