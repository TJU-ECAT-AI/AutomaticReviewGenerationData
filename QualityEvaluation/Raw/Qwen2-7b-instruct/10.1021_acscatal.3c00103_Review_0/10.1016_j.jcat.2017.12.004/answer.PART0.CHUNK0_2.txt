<p>Compared with the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst obtained by a one-step hydrothermal method, VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized by the in-situ one-step method show markedly superior catalytic performance, except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. VOX-MCM-41 achieved 40% initial propane conversion and 79% propene selectivity, as shown in Fig. 2.</p>
<p>Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows higher initial propane conversion, propene selectivity, and catalytic stability than the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst. Xue et al. also reported the non-oxidation propane dehydrogenation of the 5.2V-MSNSs catalyst, which obtained 46% initial propane conversion and 80% propene selectivity.</p>
<p>The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability for PDH, which is beneficial for large-scale industrial experimentation with PDH.</p>
<p>In addition to gelation temperature, calcination temperature is another crucial factor for synthesizing VOX-SiO2 catalysts and plays an essential role in the structure and properties of these catalysts.</p>
<p>As calcination temperature increases, propane conversion gradually decreases, but propene selectivity slightly increases. The variation trends of propane conversion and propene selectivity are similar to those found in other studies.</p>
<p>The VOX-SiO2 catalyst gelation process may have a proportional gelation-temperature tipping point. Hence, the structural and catalytic properties of catalysts may show an obvious change after the tipping point; this point may be at approximately 60C based on catalytic performance for PDH.</p>
<p>The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows higher propene selectivity due to its higher calcination temperature, which leads to a more stable catalyst structure.</p>
<p>The spent 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts after the first and eighth cycle are denoted as the R-1 Cycle and the R-8 Cycle, respectively. The conversion of the catalyst slowly decreases with time and maintains at 30% after 10h reaction. The result suggests that V-SiO2 catalysts have good stability in this work.</p>
<p>These results indicate that the VOX-SiO2 catalyst with 60C gelation temperature and 580C calcination temperature exhibits superior long-term stability for PDH reaction.</p>

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative approach to produce propene without relying solely on conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking methods. PDH processes are particularly advantageous as they can be implemented without deepening the oxidation of propene, which avoids generating by-products that are often associated with the oxidative dehydrogenation process. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, researchers are developing innovative catalyst designs. These strategies involve the synthesis of catalysts with tailored properties, such as dispersion and stability of active metal species, and the utilization of support materials that can modulate the reaction environment and prevent catalyst deactivation. In this study, porous VOX-SiO2 solids were synthesized through an in-situ one-step method, which not only improves the efficiency of the synthesis process but also allows for the optimization of the gelation and calcination temperatures to tailor the catalyst's performance. The VOX-SiO2 catalysts showed marked superiority in catalytic performance compared to other catalysts, such as VOX-MCM-41, especially when the gelation temperature was set at 60°C. This catalyst demonstrated exceptional stability and long-term catalytic activity during repeated reaction-regeneration cycles, making it a promising candidate for large-scale industrial experimentation and application in PDH processes. By understanding the relationships between the structure and performance of these catalysts, researchers can develop more efficient and sustainable catalysts that contribute to the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis.
