<p>Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used.</p>
<p>Moreover, catalyst performance was strongly affected when different supports, such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, were used.</p>
<p>To the authors' knowledge, the use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH.</p>
<p>A mesoporous silica monolith has been reported and possesses superior textural properties, but needs a lengthy gelation period at room temperature (at least six weeks).</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yang et al. shortened the solvent evaporation process by using a liquid-paraffin medium to seal the ethanol solution, meaning that the prepared silica monolith can exactly copy the shape of the reactor.</p>
<p>The preparation method is environmentally-friendly, without loss of the VOX precursor.</p>
<p>By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration.</p>
<p>Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process.</p>
<p>The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOX-SiO2 catalysts for PDH reaction was studied in detail.</p>
<p>The prepared VOX-SiO2 catalysts were characterized using a variety of state-of-the-art techniques and evaluated by a non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>As gelation temperature increases, the pore volume and surface area of catalysts decrease, whereas the pore size shows no obvious variation except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst.</p>
<p>The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of 60-VOX-SiO2 catalysts with different calcination temperatures vary obviously with increasing temperature.</p>
<p>When the calcination temperature is 580C, the pore volume and surface area of the catalyst (60-VOX-SiO2-580) decrease slightly compared to the catalyst at 550C.</p>
<p>However, 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits relatively better stability at 580C reaction temperature for PDH, which can be attributed to the more stable structure of the catalyst calcined at the same temperature.</p>
<p>When the calcination temperature increases to 620C, the textural properties of catalyst in terms of pore size, pore volume, and surface area are poor.</p>
<p>The Raman spectra of VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts show obvious differences with increasing gelation temperature, implying that gelation temperature has a significant influence on the distribution of VOX species.</p>
<p>The peak of V2p3/2 can be deconvoluted into two peaks at around 517.6 and 516.6eV, which can be ascribed to V5+ and V4+ species respectively.</p>
<p>The calculated Si/V molar ratios of catalysts with different gelation temperatures show no evident variation with increasing gelation temperature, but the ratio by XPS is much larger than by ICP, suggesting that VOX species are mostly dispersed into the channels of the SiO2 solids.</p>
<p>The XPS analysis reveals a relationship between the gelation temperature and the state of surface VOX species.</p>
<p>With increasing gelation temperature, V5+ species on the catalyst surface increase, but V4+ species decrease, suggesting a slight increase in the polymerization degree of VOX species.</p>
<p>Because the gelation temperature at 75C is close to the boiling point of ethanol (78.3C), when approaching or exceeding this temperature, the structure of VOX-SiO2 solids and dispersion of VOX species can be seriously influenced.</p>
<p>As calcination temperature increases, the weak-acid site peak shifts to a higher temperature, the peak intensity of medium acid sites obviously decreases, and total surface acidity gradually decreases.</p>
<p>This can explain the variation in catalyst performance with different calcination temperatures.</p>
<p>However, the catalysts calcined at 550C and 580C have similar total surface acidity and only a slight variation in weak acid sites.</p>
<p>Given the catalytic activity and stability of the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, this catalyst has been selected for further study of the long-term stability of dehydrogenation-regeneration (DH) cycles for PDH.</p>
<p>For the eighth cycle test, the propane conversion maintains an approximately 10% decrease, but the propene selectivity shows a slight increase compared to the first DH cycle, suggesting that VOX species may be more stable with longer DH cycle times and that the catalyst possesses excellent long-term stability.</p>

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for producing propylene. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), often face issues with thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and the generation of by-products. PDH offers a non-oxidative approach that avoids these issues while still meeting the demand for propylene and its derivatives. Innovative catalyst design strategies, particularly focusing on vanadium-based catalysts, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. These strategies include the use of various supports, like silica, zirconia, and aluminum oxide, and the optimization of gelation and calcination temperatures to achieve superior catalytic performance and stability.

The authors explore the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in PDH reactions. They find that increasing the gelation temperature over a certain range (up to 60°C) has a slight impact on catalytic performance and significantly reduces the gelation process time during one-step synthesis. The catalyst prepared at 60°C shortens the gelation process time by half compared to the catalyst prepared at 30°C, achieving a similar catalytic yield after 4 hours of reaction. Beyond this tipping point, typically around 75°C, the structure and performance of the porous VOX-SiO2 solids experience notable changes. Calcination temperature also plays a crucial role, with the catalyst calcined at 580°C showing superior stability. Higher calcination temperatures lead to the formation of V2O5 crystallites, which can affect the structure and catalytic performance negatively.

The VOX-SiO2 catalyst with a gelation temperature of 60°C and calcination temperature of 580°C exhibits exceptional long-term stability for PDH reactions. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% over four hours of reaction, while the propene selectivity remains constant at around 91% across eight reaction-regeneration cycles. This work contributes to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH processes, which can benefit industrial applications and catalysis in general.

在对丙烯需求增长和传统生产方法限制的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种替代方法来解决这些挑战。传统的生产方式，如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC），经常面临热力学平衡限制和副产品的生成问题。PDH提供了非氧化性途径，避免了这些问题，同时仍能满足对丙烯及其衍生物的需求。创新的催化剂设计策略，特别是针对以钒为基础的催化剂，正在开发中，以克服活性衰减、提高稳定性并改善循环再生性，尤其是在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中。

作者研究了在PDH反应中不同凝胶化温度和煅烧温度对多孔VOX-SiO2固体的性质和催化性能的影响。他们发现，在一定范围内增加凝胶化温度（最高至60°C）对催化性能影响较小，并显著缩短了一步法合成过程中的凝胶化时间。凝胶化温度为60°C的催化剂将凝胶化过程时间缩短了一半与凝胶化温度为30°C的催化剂相比，实现了4小时反应后的相似催化产率。超过这个转折点，通常接近乙醇沸点（78.3°C），当接近或超过此温度时，VOX-SiO2固体结构和VOX物种的分散性会受到严重的影响。

煅烧温度也起着关键作用，其中在580°C煅烧的催化剂表现出优越的稳定性。随着煅烧温度的升高，形成了V2O5结晶体，这可能会影响结构和催化性能。 

凝胶化温度为60°C和煅烧温度为580°C的VOX-SiO2催化剂展现出PDH反应的长期稳定性。其丙烷转化率从55%缓慢下降到45%，而丙烯选择性在整个八次反应再生周期内保持稳定，约为91%。这项工作有助于开发更高效稳定的PDH过程催化剂，这将有利于工业应用和催化领域的发展。
