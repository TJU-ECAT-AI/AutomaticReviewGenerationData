The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have prompted the development of new catalytic strategies, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). For oxidative PDH processes, researchers are focusing on the rational design of single-atom-doped gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts. These catalysts are designed to address issues such as deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. In nonoxidative PDH processes, similar strategies are also being explored to optimize the performance of the catalytic systems.

工业对丙烯的日益增长的需求以及传统生产方法的局限性，促使了新的催化策略的发展，尤其是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中。在氧化性PDH过程中，研究人员正在关注单原子掺杂镓氧化物（Ga2O3）催化剂的理性设计。这些催化剂旨在解决失活问题、提高稳定性并改善可回收性。在非氧化性PDH过程中，也正在探索类似的策略以优化催化系统的性能。
