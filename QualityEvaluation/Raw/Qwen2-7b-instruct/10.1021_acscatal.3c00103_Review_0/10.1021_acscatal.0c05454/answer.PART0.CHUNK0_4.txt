The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by employing innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Traditional PDH processes are prone to deactivation, reduced stability, and limited recyclability, which makes the development of durable and efficient catalysts essential for industrial applications.
