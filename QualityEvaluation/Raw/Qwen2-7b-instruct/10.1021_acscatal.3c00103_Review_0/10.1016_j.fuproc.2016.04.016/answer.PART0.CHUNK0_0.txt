<p>Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts.</p>
<p>However, catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms.</p>

To address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques aim to efficiently convert propane into propylene. Innovations in catalyst design strategies are crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include:

1. Optimizing catalyst composition to achieve a balance between dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion, ensuring that the energy input is efficiently utilized and the equilibrium is shifted towards propylene formation.

2. Enhancing catalyst stability through modification of the catalyst structure, such as by incorporating redox-active adatoms within the zeolite framework to mimic enzyme-like active sites that can facilitate CH bond activation at milder conditions.

3. Developing new catalysts with tailored properties, such as VOx-based catalysts, that can exhibit high alkene selectivity, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

4. Exploiting the synergy between the endothermic dehydrogenation step and the exothermic hydrogen combustion step, which can help in reducing the external energy input required for PDH processes.

5. Investigating the use of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) or membrane reactors to facilitate the stepwise oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, where the heat release from hydrogen combustion can be used to offset part of the energy input for dehydrogenation.

6. Incorporating additives like lithium or halides into catalysts to increase alkene selectivity and potentially improve the overall performance of PDH catalysts.

7. Studying the kinetics and mechanisms of CH bond activation on heterogeneous catalysts, aiming to understand the continuum from electrophilic to ambiphilic to nucleophilic attack on the substrate, which can inform the development of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

8. Exploring possibilities of creating active site mimics, inspired by enzymes and homogeneous catalysts, within solid frameworks to achieve efficient CH bond activation and alkane dehydrogenation over heterogeneous catalysts.</EnglishVersionAnswer>
