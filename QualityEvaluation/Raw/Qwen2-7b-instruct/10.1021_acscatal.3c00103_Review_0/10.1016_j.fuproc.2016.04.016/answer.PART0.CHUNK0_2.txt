<p>Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts.</p>
<p>For non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the two main catalyst types are platinum or chromium oxide. The two catalyst types produce different by-products and require different regeneration treatments. Moreover, factors responsible for irreversible deactivation of each catalyst type differ. In the next section, we provide brief descriptions about the nature of the active sites for the two catalyst types.</p>
<p>In the next section, we examine adsorption and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on microporous zeolite-based catalysts. Zeolites are ubiquitous materials in petroleum refining processes, and are used as catalysts, adsorbents, molecular sieves, etc.</p>
<p>Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>However, there remains the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over the VOx (groups V and VI transition metal oxides). This challenge is summarized in the macro-kinetic reaction network of propane over VOx catalysts.</p>
<p>Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts.</p>
<p>The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. VOx phase(s) in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces are critical for high alkene selectivity.</p>

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative pathway to produce propylene from propane. This process involves converting propane to propylene, which is a more valuable chemical used in various industries including plastics manufacturing. 

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies. For nonoxidative dehydrogenation, platinum and chromium oxide catalysts are commonly used. Platinum-based catalysts are selective for alkane dehydrogenation due to their high CH rupture and low CC scission activity. Chromium oxide catalysts are superior for non-oxidative dehydrogenation due to their ability to activate CH bonds via hydrogen abstraction. 

Zeolites, a ubiquitous material in petroleum refining, are also utilized in PDH processes. They are used as catalysts, adsorbents, molecular sieves, etc. Zeolites have a well-defined structure, allowing for the deduction of structure-activity relationships, which aids in the design of efficient and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation.

In oxidative PDH, the performance of vanadium-based catalysts is crucial. The nature of the vanadium oxide (VOx) phase significantly affects the catalyst's performance. In VOx catalysts, the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces, which is critical for high alkene selectivity.

Ni-based catalysts, such as NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ), Li-doped MgO, and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.), suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers. This continuum from electrophilic to ambiphilic to nucleophilic attack on the substrate provides new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Overall, these strategies aim to optimize the catalyst design to improve efficiency, stability, and recyclability in PDH processes, making them more suitable for industrial implementation.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供从丙烷到丙烯的替代途径，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的问题。这个过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯，这是一种在塑料制造等行业广泛应用的更有价值的化学物质。

为了克服催化剂失活、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。对于非氧化性脱氢，铂和铬氧化物催化剂通常被使用。铂基催化剂由于其高CH断裂和低CC断裂活性而选择性地用于烷烃脱氢。铬氧化物催化剂因其能够通过氢抽象激活CH键而在非氧化性脱氢中表现出优越性能。

在石油精炼中普遍使用的沸石也被用于PDH过程。它们作为催化剂、吸附剂、分子筛等使用。沸石具有明确的结构，允许推导出结构-活性关系，这有助于设计高效和选择性的催化剂进行脱氢。

在氧化性PDH中，钒基催化剂的表现至关重要。VOx相的性质显著影响催化剂的性能。在VOx催化剂中，VOx的氧配体与催化剂支持物之间的非共价键结合是高烯烃选择性所必需的。

镍基催化剂，如NiOx（NiOLiCl/SZ）、锂掺杂的镁氧化物和含卤化物的催化剂（MgDyLiCl、CeO2/2CeF3等），提出了电亲核和亲核CH激活机制。在Ni中心上发生电亲核CH激活，而通过[OX，其中X = Cl、F]中心发生的CH激活则为亲核。这一从电亲核到半亲核再到亲核攻击底物的过程提供了在寻找高效异质烷烃脱氢催化剂方面的新视角。

总的来说，这些策略旨在优化催化剂设计以提高PDH过程的效率、稳定性和可回收性，使其更适合工业应用。
