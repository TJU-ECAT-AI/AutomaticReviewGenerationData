<p>Despite the high alkene selectivity attained in the designs of platinum-based catalysts, there are still unexplored areas with the potential to enhance catalyst activity. For example, using zeolites enhances stability of platinum nanoparticles and rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework can be exploited to enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism.</p>
<p>The autothermal dehydrogenation approach seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt-based catalysts. This approach is still at the concept stage and is less favored by industry due to the requirement for multiple catalyst beds, feeds and process controls that make the reactor design and process operations in this approach more demanding.</p>
<p>Among the catalysts explored, VOx-based catalysts are most promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. VOx phase(s) in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces are critical for high alkene selectivity.</p>
<p>Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing alternative routes to produce propylene from propane. These methods aim to overcome the limitations of traditional production methods, which are often energy-intensive and have high environmental impacts. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to enhance the efficiency of PDH processes, focusing on improving catalyst activity, stability, and recyclability. For instance, using zeolites to stabilize platinum nanoparticles and incorporate redox-active adatoms into zeolite frameworks can enhance CH activation through the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism.

2. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed for PDH processes aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. In oxidative PDH, the focus is on catalysts like vanadium oxide (VOx), where the nature of the VOx phase is crucial for high alkene selectivity. Catalysts with VOx phases that have oxygen ligands bonded to the support through non-covalent forces tend to perform better. In nonoxidative PDH, strategies include the use of materials like nickel oxide (NiOx), lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li-doped MgO), and halide-containing catalysts. These materials are being analyzed for their ability to facilitate electrophilic or nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms, such as activation through electron-deficient Ni-centers or through [OX centers, where X = Cl, F], respectively.

1.PDH技术通过提供从丙烷生产丙烯的替代途径，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加的问题。这些方法旨在克服传统生产方法的局限性，后者通常能耗高且环境影响大。正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略旨在提高PDH过程的效率，重点关注增强催化剂活性、稳定性和可回收性。例如，使用沸石稳定铂纳米颗粒，并在沸石框架中引入氧化还原活性原子，可以通过Lewis基辅助脱质子化机制增强CH激活。

2.为克服PDH过程中存在的失活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略包括：对于氧化PDH，重点是像二氧化钒（VOx）这样的催化剂，其性质对高烯烃选择性至关重要。具有通过非共价力与支持物结合的氧配体的VOx相倾向于表现出更好的性能。在非氧化PDH中，材料如镍氧化物（NiOx）、锂掺杂镁氧化物（Li-doped MgO）和卤素包含的催化剂正在被分析，以实现通过电子缺陷Ni中心或通过[OX中心，其中X=Cl，F]等进行的亲电或亲核CH激活机制。
