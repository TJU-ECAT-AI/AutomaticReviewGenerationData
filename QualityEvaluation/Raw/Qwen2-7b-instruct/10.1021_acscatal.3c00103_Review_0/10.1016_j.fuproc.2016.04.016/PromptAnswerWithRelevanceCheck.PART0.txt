To address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques aim to efficiently convert propane into propylene. Innovations in catalyst design strategies are crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include:

1. Optimizing catalyst composition to achieve a balance between dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion, ensuring that the energy input is efficiently utilized and the equilibrium is shifted towards propylene formation.

2. Enhancing catalyst stability through modification of the catalyst structure, such as by incorporating redox-active adatoms within the zeolite framework to mimic enzyme-like active sites that can facilitate CH bond activation at milder conditions.

3. Developing new catalysts with tailored properties, such as VOx-based catalysts, that can exhibit high alkene selectivity, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

4. Exploiting the synergy between the endothermic dehydrogenation step and the exothermic hydrogen combustion step, which can help in reducing the external energy input required for PDH processes.

5. Investigating the use of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) or membrane reactors to facilitate the stepwise oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, where the heat release from hydrogen combustion can be used to offset part of the energy input for dehydrogenation.

6. Incorporating additives like lithium or halides into catalysts to increase alkene selectivity and potentially improve the overall performance of PDH catalysts.

7. Studying the kinetics and mechanisms of CH bond activation on heterogeneous catalysts, aiming to understand the continuum from electrophilic to ambiphilic to nucleophilic attack on the substrate, which can inform the development of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

8. Exploring possibilities of creating active site mimics, inspired by enzymes and homogeneous catalysts, within solid frameworks to achieve efficient CH bond activation and alkane dehydrogenation over heterogeneous catalysts.</EnglishVersionAnswer>

In addressing the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques utilize innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. 

For oxidative PDH, VOx-based catalysts stand out as particularly promising for the dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes, with the nature of the VOx phase playing a critical role in determining the catalyst's performance. Specifically, the phase in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support through non-covalent forces tends to exhibit higher alkene selectivity.

In nonoxidative PDH, autothermal approaches aim to reduce the external energy input required for dehydrogenation, though they are less favored due to the complexity in reactor design and process controls. Instead, the oxidative dehydrogenation approach can achieve similar objectives with simpler designs and controls.

Furthermore, analyses of catalysts like NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ), Li-doped MgO, and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3) have revealed electrophilic and nucleophilic mechanisms for CH activation. The electron-deficient Ni-center in NiOLiCl/SZ enables electrophilic activation, whereas nucleophilic activation occurs through the [OX centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts, where X represents halide ions.</EnglishVersionAnswer>

针对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的挑战，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过创新催化剂设计策略来克服催化剂失活问题、提高稳定性和循环利用性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中都发挥了作用。

在氧化性PDH中，VOx基催化剂在C3烷烃脱氢方面表现出特别的潜力，而VOx相的性质对催化剂性能至关重要。具体而言，氧配体与催化剂支持材料通过非共价键连接的VOx相倾向于表现出更高的烯烃选择性。

对于非氧化性PDH，自动热法试图降低外部能量输入需求，但它们因需要复杂的反应器设计和过程控制而受到行业青睐较少。相反，氧化性脱氢法可以以更简单的设计和控制实现类似的目标。

此外，对NiOx（NiOLiCl/SZ）、锂掺杂的MgO以及卤素包含催化剂（MgDyLiCl、CeO2/2CeF3）的分析揭示了CH激活的电亲核机制。NiOLiCl/SZ中的电子缺乏Ni中心允许电亲核激活，而在Mg-Dy-Li-Cl和CeO2/2CeF3催化剂中，通过[OX中心进行的亲核激活，其中X代表卤素离子。</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<p>For non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the two main catalyst types are platinum or chromium oxide.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative pathway to produce propylene from propane. This process involves converting propane to propylene, which is a more valuable chemical used in various industries including plastics manufacturing. 

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies. For nonoxidative dehydrogenation, platinum and chromium oxide catalysts are commonly used. Platinum-based catalysts are selective for alkane dehydrogenation due to their high CH rupture and low CC scission activity. Chromium oxide catalysts are superior for non-oxidative dehydrogenation due to their ability to activate CH bonds via hydrogen abstraction. 

Zeolites, a ubiquitous material in petroleum refining, are also utilized in PDH processes. They are used as catalysts, adsorbents, molecular sieves, etc. Zeolites have a well-defined structure, allowing for the deduction of structure-activity relationships, which aids in the design of efficient and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation.

In oxidative PDH, the performance of vanadium-based catalysts is crucial. The nature of the vanadium oxide (VOx) phase significantly affects the catalyst's performance. In VOx catalysts, the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces, which is critical for high alkene selectivity.

Ni-based catalysts, such as NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ), Li-doped MgO, and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.), suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers. This continuum from electrophilic to ambiphilic to nucleophilic attack on the substrate provides new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Overall, these strategies aim to optimize the catalyst design to improve efficiency, stability, and recyclability in PDH processes, making them more suitable for industrial implementation.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供从丙烷到丙烯的替代途径，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的问题。这个过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯，这是一种在塑料制造等行业广泛应用的更有价值的化学物质。

为了克服催化剂失活、提高稳定性和增强可回收性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。对于非氧化性脱氢，铂和铬氧化物催化剂通常被使用。铂基催化剂由于其高CH断裂和低CC断裂活性而选择性地用于烷烃脱氢。铬氧化物催化剂因其能够通过氢抽象激活CH键而在非氧化性脱氢中表现出优越性能。

在石油精炼中普遍使用的沸石也被用于PDH过程。它们作为催化剂、吸附剂、分子筛等使用。沸石具有明确的结构，允许推导出结构-活性关系，这有助于设计高效和选择性的催化剂进行脱氢。

在氧化性PDH中，钒基催化剂的表现至关重要。VOx相的性质显著影响催化剂的性能。在VOx催化剂中，VOx的氧配体与催化剂支持物之间的非共价键结合是高烯烃选择性所必需的。

镍基催化剂，如NiOx（NiOLiCl/SZ）、锂掺杂的镁氧化物和含卤化物的催化剂（MgDyLiCl、CeO2/2CeF3等），提出了电亲核和亲核CH激活机制。在Ni中心上发生电亲核CH激活，而通过[OX，其中X = Cl、F]中心发生的CH激活则为亲核。这一从电亲核到半亲核再到亲核攻击底物的过程提供了在寻找高效异质烷烃脱氢催化剂方面的新视角。

总的来说，这些策略旨在优化催化剂设计以提高PDH过程的效率、稳定性和可回收性，使其更适合工业应用。

Lower alkanes are readily available feedstocks from petroleum and gas resources. They are potential precursors to many value-added chemicals. However, there are very few commercial processes based on direct conversion of light alkanes to valuable chemicals. Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons [1] . Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents). Chemical processing under these severe conditions typically require large capital investments. The traditional application of light alkanes is based on the release of stored energy in the CC and CH bonds as heat energy via combustion. This reaction is less demanding in term of product selectivity because it simply entails moving from the extreme reduced state to complete oxidation of the alkanes. However, value-added chemicals obtainable from light alkanes are in-between the permissible oxidation states of a carbon atom (see Fig. 1) [2] . Thus, the main challenge of using lower alkanes to produce value-added chemicals is the development of economic and environment friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds that contain at least one carbon atom that can be assigned an oxidation number between 4 and + 4 [3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] .

Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they have π-electrons. Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers. At present, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are the main technologies used for industrial production ethene and propene. With these technologies, ethene production rate is higher than that of propene. However, market projections indicate a continued rise in the demand for ethene and propene, and growth in demand for propylene derivatives may outpace that for ethylene derivatives in the near future [7] . Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes. 

Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics. The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching (Fig. 2) [8] . 

Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. 

The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation. Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation. It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic. If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion. This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts. The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity. This structural heterogeneity makes the properties-performance correlation of the catalysts complicated. Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative direct conversion pathway for light alkanes to valuable chemicals. The traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, produce ethene at a higher rate than propene, which can lead to mismatches with market demands. PDH offers the potential for more direct and selective conversion of propane to propene, addressing the issue of supply-demand imbalances. Innovations in catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. For instance, platinum and chromium oxide-based catalysts are utilized for their selective dehydrogenation capabilities. Research is ongoing to optimize the mechanisms of CH activation, aiming to understand the pathway of CH bond cleavage as either homolytic or heterolytic, and whether the hydrogen abstraction occurs as a proton or hydride ion. This knowledge is crucial for improving catalyst efficiency. Additionally, the complexity of catalyst structural heterogeneity is recognized as a challenge, and the use of microporous zeolites as a starting point for more precise catalyst performance correlations is suggested. Overall, PDH technologies offer a promising avenue for more efficient and environmentally friendly production of propylene, addressing current market demands and technological limitations.
