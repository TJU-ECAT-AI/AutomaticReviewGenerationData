<p>Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts.</p>
<p>The autothermal dehydrogenation approach seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt-based catalysts. This approach is still at the concept stage and is less favored by industry due to the requirement for multiple catalyst beds, feeds and process controls that make the reactor design and process operations in this approach more demanding. The main objective of the autothermal dehydrogenation approach can be readily achieved using the oxidative dehydrogenation approach with a less complicated reactor design and process controls.</p>
<p>Among the catalysts explored, VOx-based catalysts are most promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. VOx phase(s) in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces are critical for high alkene selectivity.</p>
<p>Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts.</p>

In addressing the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques utilize innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. 

For oxidative PDH, VOx-based catalysts stand out as particularly promising for the dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes, with the nature of the VOx phase playing a critical role in determining the catalyst's performance. Specifically, the phase in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support through non-covalent forces tends to exhibit higher alkene selectivity.

In nonoxidative PDH, autothermal approaches aim to reduce the external energy input required for dehydrogenation, though they are less favored due to the complexity in reactor design and process controls. Instead, the oxidative dehydrogenation approach can achieve similar objectives with simpler designs and controls.

Furthermore, analyses of catalysts like NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ), Li-doped MgO, and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3) have revealed electrophilic and nucleophilic mechanisms for CH activation. The electron-deficient Ni-center in NiOLiCl/SZ enables electrophilic activation, whereas nucleophilic activation occurs through the [OX centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts, where X represents halide ions.</EnglishVersionAnswer>

针对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的挑战，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过创新催化剂设计策略来克服催化剂失活问题、提高稳定性和循环利用性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中都发挥了作用。

在氧化性PDH中，VOx基催化剂在C3烷烃脱氢方面表现出特别的潜力，而VOx相的性质对催化剂性能至关重要。具体而言，氧配体与催化剂支持材料通过非共价键连接的VOx相倾向于表现出更高的烯烃选择性。

对于非氧化性PDH，自动热法试图降低外部能量输入需求，但它们因需要复杂的反应器设计和过程控制而受到行业青睐较少。相反，氧化性脱氢法可以以更简单的设计和控制实现类似的目标。

此外，对NiOx（NiOLiCl/SZ）、锂掺杂的MgO以及卤素包含催化剂（MgDyLiCl、CeO2/2CeF3）的分析揭示了CH激活的电亲核机制。NiOLiCl/SZ中的电子缺乏Ni中心允许电亲核激活，而在Mg-Dy-Li-Cl和CeO2/2CeF3催化剂中，通过[OX中心进行的亲核激活，其中X代表卤素离子。</ChineseVersionAnswer>
