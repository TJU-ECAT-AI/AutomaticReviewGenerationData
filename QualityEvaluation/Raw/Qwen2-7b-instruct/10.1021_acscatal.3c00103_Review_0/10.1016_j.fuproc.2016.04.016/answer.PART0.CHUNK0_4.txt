Lower alkanes are readily available feedstocks from petroleum and gas resources. They are potential precursors to many value-added chemicals. However, there are very few commercial processes based on direct conversion of light alkanes to valuable chemicals. Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons [1] . Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents). Chemical processing under these severe conditions typically require large capital investments. The traditional application of light alkanes is based on the release of stored energy in the CC and CH bonds as heat energy via combustion. This reaction is less demanding in term of product selectivity because it simply entails moving from the extreme reduced state to complete oxidation of the alkanes. However, value-added chemicals obtainable from light alkanes are in-between the permissible oxidation states of a carbon atom (see Fig. 1) [2] . Thus, the main challenge of using lower alkanes to produce value-added chemicals is the development of economic and environment friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds that contain at least one carbon atom that can be assigned an oxidation number between 4 and + 4 [3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] .

Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they have π-electrons. Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers. At present, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are the main technologies used for industrial production ethene and propene. With these technologies, ethene production rate is higher than that of propene. However, market projections indicate a continued rise in the demand for ethene and propene, and growth in demand for propylene derivatives may outpace that for ethylene derivatives in the near future [7] . Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes. 

Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics. The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching (Fig. 2) [8] . 

Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. 

The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation. Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation. It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic. If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion. This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts. The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity. This structural heterogeneity makes the properties-performance correlation of the catalysts complicated. Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative direct conversion pathway for light alkanes to valuable chemicals. The traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, produce ethene at a higher rate than propene, which can lead to mismatches with market demands. PDH offers the potential for more direct and selective conversion of propane to propene, addressing the issue of supply-demand imbalances. Innovations in catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. For instance, platinum and chromium oxide-based catalysts are utilized for their selective dehydrogenation capabilities. Research is ongoing to optimize the mechanisms of CH activation, aiming to understand the pathway of CH bond cleavage as either homolytic or heterolytic, and whether the hydrogen abstraction occurs as a proton or hydride ion. This knowledge is crucial for improving catalyst efficiency. Additionally, the complexity of catalyst structural heterogeneity is recognized as a challenge, and the use of microporous zeolites as a starting point for more precise catalyst performance correlations is suggested. Overall, PDH technologies offer a promising avenue for more efficient and environmentally friendly production of propylene, addressing current market demands and technological limitations.
