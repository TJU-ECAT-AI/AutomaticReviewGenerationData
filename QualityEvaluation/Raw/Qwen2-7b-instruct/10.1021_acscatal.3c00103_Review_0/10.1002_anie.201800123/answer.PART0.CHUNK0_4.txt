[1] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."
[2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively.4 The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."
[4] "This paper describes the surface structure and the important role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts under reaction conditions employing in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculations."
[5] "It is shown that hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst."
[6] "The hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction."
[7] "A VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation method and the V loading is 6wt%, which is less than the theoretical monolayer V loading (12wt%) on γ-Al2O3."
[8] "The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)."
[9] "The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, which mainly contains V4+ species throughout the reaction, exhibits a relatively low PDH activity but good resistance to coke formation."
[10] "DFT calculations are applied to simulate the PDH process on different reduced VOx structures, and the results coincide well with experiments."
[11] "As shown in Figure1a, the initial activity of the 6V catalysts decreased as H2 pretreatment time increased."
[12] "The hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface are saturated before the H2 treatment."
[13] "The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is firstly reduced by H2, and the V=O structure on the outer most surface is combined with the adsorbed H2 molecules to form an adsorbed H2O."
[14] "The intensity of the VOH band is normalized by relative intensity (defined in the experimental section in the Supporting Information) to quantitatively describe the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[15] "As shown in Figure2, the initial activity (Figure2a) and relative deactivation rate (Figure2b) are found to be linearly related to the intensity of VOH band which represents the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[16] "The surface oxygen atoms (including but not limited to the top-site oxygen) can be removed by C3H8, thus generating COx in a very short period of time."
[17] "Our previous study has shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition."
[18] "The catalyst reduced by H2 mainly shows the valence state of 4+, while the VOx species on the fresh catalyst is reduced to a lower valence state (mainly 3+) under C3H8."
[19] "As shown in Figure4b and TableS8, the highest dehydrogenation barrier, 1.98eV, was observed over V2O5H2, which is consistent with the lowest initial activity observed experimentally with the existence of a surface VOH group."
[20] "The highly reduced V2O3 cluster, without V=O and VOH, prevents C3H6 desorption and promotes its dehydrogenation to form coke."
[21] "Unlike oxidative propane dehydrogenation, the reduction environment keeps vanadium oxide at low oxidative state and propane dehydrogenation continues by a non-oxidative mechanism."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative for on-purpose propylene production. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), rely on expensive raw materials and produce propylene as a byproduct. In contrast, PDH utilizes propane directly to produce propylene, which is more commercially attractive due to the abundance of shale gas resources and the low cost of propane. To overcome deactivation issues and improve stability and recyclability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. Specifically, supported vanadium catalysts are being optimized by controlling the surface hydroxyl group coverage. These hydroxyl groups significantly impact the catalytic performance of PDH reactions by reducing the activity and enhancing stability through the suppression of coke formation. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments are employed to study the surface structure and role of hydroxyl groups on vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, contributing to the development of more efficient and durable catalysts for both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

针对丙烯工业需求的增长和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供更经济高效、环境友好的丙烯生产替代方法，应对这些挑战。传统的生产方式依赖于昂贵的原料，并将丙烯作为副产品产生。相比之下，PDH直接利用丙烷生产丙烯，由于页岩气资源丰富和丙烷成本低廉，这种方法更具商业吸引力。为了克服催化剂失活问题并提高稳定性和可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。具体而言，正在优化以范德华催化剂，通过控制表面羟基团覆盖率来优化PDH反应。这些羟基团对PDH催化性能产生显著影响，通过降低活性和增强稳定性，抑制焦炭形成。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和原位漫反射红外傅立叶变换光谱（DRIFTS）实验被用于研究范德华氧化物（VOx）催化剂的表面结构和羟基团的作用，为开发更高效的非氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的催化剂做出贡献。
