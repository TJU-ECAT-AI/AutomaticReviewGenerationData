In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative pathway to produce propylene directly from propane. Traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) rely on oil byproducts, which are expensive and not always readily available. PDH offers a more cost-effective solution by utilizing the abundance of propane, especially in regions with significant shale gas production. 

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, researchers focus on designing catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and resist coke formation. In this study, a VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with surface hydroxyl groups (OH) is developed. These OH groups play a crucial role in stabilizing the catalyst by blocking the formation of coke, which is a common issue in PDH processes. The presence of OH groups also affects the catalytic performance, with lower concentrations leading to better stability and reduced coke formation. 

The catalysts are optimized through in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments, which monitor the evolution of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface under hydrogen (H2) pretreatment. The relationship between the concentration of hydroxyl groups and the catalytic performance is established, showing a direct correlation between the hydroxyl group concentration and the initial activity and stability of the catalyst. 

Moreover, the study employs density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to simulate the PDH process on different reduced VOx structures. These calculations reveal that the hydroxyl groups have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance, influencing the active sites and surface structure of the catalyst under reductive reaction conditions. The results indicate that the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species are responsible for the observed changes in catalytic performance and stability.

The research also discusses the importance of the V3+ site in the catalyst's activity for PDH reactions. The V3+ site is more active than other sites on supported VOx catalysts, which might explain why catalysts without hydrogen reduction show higher initial activity. This finding highlights the role of surface chemistry in determining the catalytic properties of PDH catalysts.

In summary, the development of VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with surface hydroxyl groups provides a novel approach to enhancing the stability and efficiency of PDH processes. By optimizing the catalyst's structure and composition, researchers aim to create catalysts that can withstand high temperatures, resist coke formation, and maintain high activity over multiple cycles, thus addressing the challenges associated with traditional propylene production methods.

在丙烯需求增长和传统生产方法限制的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供直接从丙烷生产丙烯的替代途径，解决了这些挑战。传统的生产方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）依赖于石油副产品，成本高昂且可获得性不稳定。PDH通过利用丰富的丙烷，特别是在拥有大量页岩气生产的地区，提供了更经济有效的解决方案。

为了克服PDH过程中的失活问题、提高稳定性并改进循环性，研究人员专注于设计能够承受高温并抵抗焦炭形成的催化剂。在本研究中，开发了一种表面含有多羟基（OH）的VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂。这些OH团对稳定催化剂至关重要，通过阻止焦炭形成来增强催化剂性能。OH团的存在还影响催化剂的性能，较低的浓度与更好的稳定性及减少焦炭形成有关。

通过原位差分反射红外傅里叶变换光谱法（DRIFTS）实验监测催化剂表面在氢（H2）预处理下的羟基演化过程。建立了OH团浓度与催化剂性能之间的关系，显示出OH团浓度与催化剂的初始活性和稳定性之间的直接相关性。

此外，使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算模拟不同还原VOx结构的PDH过程。这些计算揭示了OH团在决定催化剂在还原反应条件下活性和表面结构方面的重要性。结果显示，OH团在VOx物种上的存在对催化剂的PDH反应性能有根本性的影响。

研究还讨论了催化剂表面化学在确定PDH催化剂性质中的重要性。V3+位点在支持VOx催化剂的活性中更为活跃，这可能解释了在氢还原处理后催化剂具有更高的初始活性的现象。这一发现突出了表面化学在PDH催化剂性能方面的关键作用。

综上所述，开发表面含有多羟基的VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂提供了一种新颖的方法，以增强PDH过程的稳定性和效率。通过优化催化剂的结构和组成，研究人员旨在创建能够承受高温、抵抗焦炭形成并保持高活性的催化剂，从而解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的问题。
