[1] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
[2] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."
[3] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."
[4] "Very few studies are concerned with the detailed structure of the surface VOx species under the reaction conditions."
[5] "A VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation method and the V loading is 6wt%, which is less than the theoretical monolayer V loading (12wt%) on γ-Al2O3."
[6] "The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)."
[7] "It is shown that hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst."
[8] "The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, which mainly contains V4+ species throughout the reaction, exhibits a relatively low PDH activity but good resistance to coke formation."
[9] "DFT calculations are applied to simulate the PDH process on different reduced VOx structures, and the results coincide well with experiments."
[10] "The effects of H2 pretreatment were further characterized by in situ DRIFTS experiments."
[11] "The intensity of the VOH band is normalized by relative intensity (defined in the experimental section in the Supporting Information) to quantitatively describe the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[12] "The initial activity (Figure2a) and relative deactivation rate (Figure2b) are found to be linearly related to the intensity of VOH band which represents the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[13] "Bader charge analysis indicates the V oxidation state follows the trend V2O5>V2O5H2>V2O3, and is consistent with the valence-state distribution of vanadium by XPS."
[14] "As shown in Figure4b and TableS8, the highest dehydrogenation barrier, 1.98eV, was observed over V2O5H2, which is consistent with the lowest initial activity observed experimentally with the existence of a surface VOH group."
[15] "The highly reduced V2O3 cluster, without V=O and VOH, prevents C3H6 desorption and promotes its dehydrogenation to form coke."
[16] "Unlike oxidative propane dehydrogenation, the reduction environment keeps vanadium oxide at low oxidative state and propane dehydrogenation continues by a non-oxidative mechanism."
[17] "Our previous study has shown that the V3+ site is more active for PDH reaction than others on supported VOx catalysts."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional processes. Traditional methods often rely on expensive and toxic catalysts such as platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), which limit their commercial viability. Supported vanadium catalysts, on the other hand, are considered promising due to their significant activity, appropriate propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. These catalysts are designed to enhance stability and recyclability, particularly in non-oxidative PDH processes. By studying the detailed structure of the surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species under reaction conditions, researchers aim to optimize the catalyst's performance and reduce coke formation, thereby improving the efficiency and longevity of the PDH process.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法限制的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供更经济高效且环境友好的替代方案，解决了这些挑战。传统的生产方法往往依赖于昂贵且有毒的催化剂，如铂（Pt）和铬酸盐（CrOx），这限制了它们的商业可行性。而支持型钒催化剂因其显著的活性、适当的丙烯选择性和出色的再生性能而被认为是具有前景的。这些催化剂的设计旨在增强稳定性并提高可回收性，特别是在非氧化性PDH过程中。通过研究表面钒氧化物（VOx）物种在反应条件下的详细结构，研究人员致力于优化催化剂性能并减少焦炭形成，从而提高PDH过程的效率和寿命。
