[1] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively.4 The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."
[2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
[3] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."
[4] "This paper describes the surface structure and the important role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts under reaction conditions employing in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculations."
[5] "It is shown that hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst."
[6] "The hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction."
[7] "Clearly, the catalyst with lower initial activity deactivates more slowly."
[8] "The effects of H2 pretreatment were further characterized by in situ DRIFTS experiments."
[9] "As the reduction process proceeds, the H atom gradually migrates from H2O molecules to an adjacent O atom (which could be any of three types of O in the V-O-V, V=O, or V-O-Al structure) to form hydroxyl groups connected to either a V or Al atom."
[10] "The intensity of the VOH band is normalized by relative intensity (defined in the experimental section in the Supporting Information) to quantitatively describe the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[11] "As shown in Figure3A presents the DRIFTS profiles of a series of 6V samples after a 30minute reaction at 600C, among which the samples are pretreated with H2 for different periods of time (3120min)."
[12] "Therefore, the hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface are saturated before the H2 treatment."
[13] "According to the experimental phenomenon, a scheme of the VOH evolution is proposed."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). They enable the direct conversion of propane into propylene, a key feedstock for manufacturing polymers, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and phenol. To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, researchers are developing innovative catalyst designs. These strategies focus on tuning the surface structure and composition of catalysts, particularly by controlling the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts. Hydroxyl groups are shown to reduce the PDH activity and prevent coke formation, thereby improving the catalyst's stability and recyclability. The role of these groups is studied through in situ DRIFTS experiments and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, providing insights into the surface structure and dynamics of PDH reactions on VOx catalysts.

在对丙烯日益增长的工业需求和传统生产方法限制的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供更经济高效且环保的替代方案，解决了这些挑战。它们能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，这是制造聚合物、丙烯氧化物、丙烯腈和酚等产品的关键原料。为了克服催化剂失活问题、提高稳定性和可回收性，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略侧重于调整催化剂表面结构和成分，特别是通过控制范德华氧化物（VOx）催化剂表面上羟基的存在。羟基被证明可以降低PDH活性并防止焦炭形成，从而改善催化剂的稳定性与可回收性。通过原位DRIFTS实验和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算研究这些作用，提供了关于VOx催化剂上PDH反应表面结构和动力学的见解。
