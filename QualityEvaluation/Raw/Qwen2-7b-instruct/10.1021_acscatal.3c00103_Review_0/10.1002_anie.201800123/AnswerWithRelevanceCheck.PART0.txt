          [1] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
          [2] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."
          [3] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."
          [4] "This paper describes the surface structure and the important role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts under reaction conditions employing in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculations."
          [5] "It is shown that hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst."
          [6] "The hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction."
          [7] "A VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation method and the V loading is 6wt%, which is less than the theoretical monolayer V loading (12wt%) on γ-Al2O3."
          [8] "The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)."
          [9] "The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, which mainly contains V4+ species throughout the reaction, exhibits a relatively low PDH activity but good resistance to coke formation."
          [10] "DFT calculations are applied to simulate the PDH process on different reduced VOx structures, and the results coincide well with experiments."
          [11] "As shown in Figure1a, the initial activity of the 6V catalysts decreased as H2 pretreatment time increased."
          [12] "The hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface are saturated before the H2 treatment."
          [13] "The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is firstly reduced by H2, and the V=O structure on the outer most surface is combined with the adsorbed H2 molecules to form an adsorbed H2O."
          [14] "The intensity of the VOH band is normalized by relative intensity (defined in the experimental section in the Supporting Information) to quantitatively describe the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
          [15] "As shown in Figure2, the initial activity (Figure2a) and relative deactivation rate (Figure2b) are found to be linearly related to the intensity of VOH band which represents the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
          [16] "The surface oxygen atoms (including but not limited to the top-site oxygen) can be removed by C3H8, thus generating COx in a very short period of time."
          [17] "Our previous study has shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition."
          [18] "The catalyst reduced by H2 mainly shows the valence state of 4+, while the VOx species on the fresh catalyst is reduced to a lower valence state (mainly 3+) under C3H8."
          [19] "As shown in Figure4b and TableS8, the highest dehydrogenation barrier, 1.98eV, was observed over V2O5H2, which is consistent with the lowest initial activity observed experimentally with the existence of a surface VOH group."
          [20] "The highly reduced V2O3 cluster, without V=O and VOH, prevents C3H6 desorption and promotes its dehydrogenation to form coke."
          [21] "Unlike oxidative propane dehydrogenation, the reduction environment keeps vanadium oxide at low oxidative state and propane dehydrogenation continues by a non-oxidative mechanism."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are crucial for addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods. These methods offer a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which rely on expensive raw materials and produce propylene as a byproduct. By utilizing the abundance of propane, especially in regions with significant shale gas production, PDH processes become more commercially attractive.

Traditional catalysts, such as those based on platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), are restricted by their high cost and toxicity. In contrast, supported vanadium catalysts are considered a viable alternative due to their high activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The surface hydroxyl groups (OH) on these catalysts play a critical role in enhancing stability and reducing coke formation, thus improving the efficiency and longevity of the PDH process.

To overcome deactivation issues and improve stability and recyclability, researchers focus on tuning the surface structure and composition of PDH catalysts. This involves studying the evolution of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface under hydrogen (H2) pretreatment conditions and monitoring their impact on catalytic performance. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to simulate the PDH process on various reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) structures, aligning theoretical predictions with experimental observations.

The development of PDH catalysts with surface hydroxyl groups contributes to the optimization of catalyst design for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These catalysts are engineered to reduce coke formation, improve stability, and maintain high activity over multiple cycles, making them a sustainable and efficient solution for propylene production from propane. The research also emphasizes the importance of controlling the valence state of vanadium during the reaction, as it influences the catalytic performance and deactivation mechanisms, ultimately leading to the creation of more effective and durable catalysts for PDH applications.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术对于应对丙烯需求增长和传统生产方法限制带来的挑战至关重要。这些技术提供了一种更经济高效、更加环保的替代方案，与依赖昂贵原材料并以丙烯为副产品的传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解（FCC）相比更具优势。通过利用丰富的丙烷，尤其是在页岩气生产地区，PDH过程变得更加具有商业吸引力。

传统的催化剂，如基于铂（Pt）和铬酸盐（CrOx）的催化剂，受到高昂成本和毒性的限制。相比之下，支持型钒催化剂因其高活性、适当的丙烯选择性和出色的再生性能被视为替代选择。这些催化剂表面的羟基（OH）团在增强稳定性、减少焦炭形成方面起着关键作用，从而提高了PDH过程的效率和使用寿命。

为了克服催化剂失活问题、提高稳定性和可回收性，研究人员专注于调整PDH催化剂的表面结构和组成。这涉及到研究在氢（H2）预处理条件下催化剂表面羟基的演变，并监控其对催化性能的影响。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算被用于模拟各种还原的钒氧化物（VOx）结构上的PDH过程，理论预测与实验观测结果相匹配。
