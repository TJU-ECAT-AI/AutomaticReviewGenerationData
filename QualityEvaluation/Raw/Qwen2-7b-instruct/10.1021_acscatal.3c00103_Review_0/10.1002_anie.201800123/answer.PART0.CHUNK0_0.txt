[1] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
[2] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."
[3] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."
[4] "The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)."
[5] "It was found that the catalytic performance (including the initial activity and stability) of the 6V catalyst is closely connected to the VOH concentration, which is controlled by the H2 pretreatment time."
[6] "The hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction."
[7] "Catalytic tests were carried out at 600C on 6V samples that were pretreated with 28% H2/N2 for different periods of time (3120min) at the same temperature."
[8] "The effects of H2 pretreatment were further characterized by in situ DRIFTS experiments."
[9] "As shown in Figure1d, the relative intensity of VOH increases with the increasing H2 reduction time."
[10] "The intensity of the VOH band is normalized by relative intensity (defined in the experimental section in the Supporting Information) to quantitatively describe the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[11] "As shown in Figure4b and TableS8, the highest dehydrogenation barrier, 1.98eV, was observed over V2O5H2, which is consistent with the lowest initial activity observed experimentally with the existence of a surface VOH group."
[12] "Unlike oxidative propane dehydrogenation, the reduction environment keeps vanadium oxide at low oxidative state and propane dehydrogenation continues by a non-oxidative mechanism."
[13] "In contrast, the formation of acetone is much harder over structure II, thus leading to favorable production of propylene."
[14] "Our previous study has shown that the V3+ site is more active for PDH reaction than others on supported VOx catalysts,5a which might, to some extent, explain why the catalyst without H2 reduction shows higher initial activity in the present study."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an efficient and cost-effective route for propylene production, particularly from abundant propane sources like shale gas. Traditional methods using catalysts like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) are limited by high costs and toxicity, whereas supported vanadium catalysts offer a viable alternative due to their high activity, suitable propylene selectivity, and robust regeneration capabilities.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, researchers focus on tuning the surface structure of the catalyst. Specifically, the introduction of surface hydroxyl (OH) groups plays a crucial role. These OH groups are generated through hydrogen reduction (H2 pretreatment), leading to a decrease in the catalytic activity and an improvement in stability by inhibiting coke formation. The presence of OH groups blocks exposed vanadium ions, facilitating the desorption of propylene intermediates like propylene (C3H6) and preventing the formation of coke, thus maintaining the catalyst's efficiency over multiple cycles.

The development of such catalysts involves a detailed understanding of the surface structure and composition under both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH conditions. This includes the use of advanced analytical techniques like in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to monitor the evolution of hydroxyl groups and their impact on catalytic performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to simulate the PDH process on various reduced vanadium oxide structures, aligning theoretical predictions with experimental observations. This comprehensive approach enables the optimization of catalyst design for enhanced performance and longevity in PDH processes, contributing to sustainable and efficient propylene production.

在对丙烯日益增长的工业需求以及传统生产方法限制的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种高效且成本效益高的丙烯生产途径来应对这些挑战，特别是从页岩气等丰富丙烷来源。传统的催化剂如铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）受限于高昂的成本和毒性，而支持型钒催化剂由于其高活性、合适的丙烯选择性和出色的再生性能，提供了替代选择。

为了克服催化剂失活、提高稳定性和增强循环性，研究者专注于调整催化剂的表面结构。具体而言，表面羟基（OH）团的作用至关重要。这些OH团通过氢还原（H2预处理）产生，导致催化活性降低和稳定性提高，抑制焦炭形成。表面OH团阻断暴露的钒离子，促进丙烯中间体如丙烯（C3H6）的脱氢并防止焦炭形成，从而维持催化剂在多个周期内的效率。

开发此类催化剂涉及深入理解在氧化性和非氧化性PDH条件下的表面结构和组成。这包括使用高级分析技术如原位差分反射红外傅里叶变换光谱（DRIFTS）监测表面羟基组分及其对催化性能的影响。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算用于模拟不同还原的钒氧化物结构上的PDH过程，与实验观察结果相吻合。这种全面的方法使优化催化剂设计以实现增强的性能和持久性成为可能，在PDH过程中贡献于可持续和高效的丙烯生产。
