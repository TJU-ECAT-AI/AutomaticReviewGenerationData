[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials."
[2] "Despite this, there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played by the different surface species present on supported catalysts."
[3] "Isolated vanadia species show high activity, but very low selectivity due to the undesirable formation of coke."
[4] "Polymeric VOx species however show a greater selectivity towards the desired C4 dehydrogenation products."
[5] "The formation of polymeric vanadates from V2O5-like surface species can be achieved through treatment with O2 at high temperatures, thereby increasing catalytic activity."
[6] "After regeneration, the catalytic activity of the catalysts changes as a result of transformations to both the surface VOx species and the pure support, with vanadium appearing to catalyse a phase transformation in Al2O3 above 823 K."
[7] "The polyolefinic coke species removed by high temperature regeneration are not however the principle source of catalyst deactivation, which can instead be assigned to tightly bound reaction intermediates."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenge of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering alternative routes to produce propylene and other valuable chemicals, such as alkadienes. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

2. Catalysts for PDH processes are designed to efficiently convert propane into propylene, with a focus on achieving high selectivity and activity. Strategies include optimizing catalyst composition, structure, and regeneration protocols to maintain activity and stability over multiple reaction cycles.

3. Isolated vanadia species, while highly active, exhibit low selectivity due to the formation of coke, which is undesirable. On the other hand, polymeric vanadates show better selectivity towards the desired C4 dehydrogenation products, such as alkenes and alkadienes.

4. To increase catalytic activity, treatment of vanadium oxide surfaces with oxygen at high temperatures can lead to the formation of polymeric vanadates from V2O5-like species. This process enhances the catalytic properties of the PDH catalysts.

5. During regeneration, the nature of the vanadium oxide species and the alumina support undergo transformations. Vanadium catalyzes a phase transformation in the alumina support above 823 K, which affects the catalyst's activity.

6. High temperature regeneration removes polyolefinic coke species, but it is not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. Instead, tightly bound reaction intermediates are responsible for most of the observed catalyst deactivation.

1. 烯烃脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供生产丙烯和其他宝贵化学品的替代途径，应对工业需求增长和传统生产方法限制的挑战。创新催化剂设计策略旨在克服活性衰减问题，增强稳定性和提高再生性，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中。

2. PDH过程中的催化剂被设计为高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，重点是实现高选择性和活性。策略包括优化催化剂组成、结构和再生协议，以保持活动性和稳定性。

3. 分离的钒酸盐物种虽然活性高，但选择性低，因为它们会导致不希望的焦油形成。相反，聚合态VOx物种对所需的C4脱氢产物，如烯烃和二烯烃，具有更好的选择性。

4. 通过高温处理，从V2O5样表面物种形成聚合态钒酸盐可以增加PDH催化剂的活性。这提高了催化剂的催化性质。

5. 再生期间，范德华氧化物物种和支持氧化铝的性质发生转变。在823K以上的温度下，范德华催化铝氧化物支持发生相变，影响催化剂的活性。

6. 高温再生去除聚烯烃焦油物种，但这不是催化剂失活的主要原因。相反，紧密吸附的反应中间体是观察到的催化剂失活的主要原因。
