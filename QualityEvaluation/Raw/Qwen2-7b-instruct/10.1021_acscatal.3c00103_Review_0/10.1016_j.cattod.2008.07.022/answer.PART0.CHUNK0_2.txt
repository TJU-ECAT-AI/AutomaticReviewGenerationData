[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials."
[2] "Despite this, there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played by the different surface species present on supported catalysts."
[3] "From these data it is possible to determine structureactivity relationships, with polymeric vanadia clusters favouring the formation of butenes and butadienes, while more isolated species are highly active towards the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons retained on the catalyst surface post-reaction."
[4] "The main reactions occurring are the formation of retained carbon and the formation of butenes and butadienes."
[5] "While more isolated species show the greatest activity towards carbon formation the data shown in Fig. 5(a) suggest that polymeric vanadia species show the greatest activity in the dehydrogenation reaction."
[6] "That this was due to a change in the nature of the VOx species after regeneration was confirmed by UVvis spectroscopy studies."

1. The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is crucial for the production of alkenes and alkadienes, which are essential for fuels, plastics, and various other materials.
2. There is a scarcity of knowledge regarding the unique roles of the various surface components found on supported catalysts.
3. Based on the data, there are structure-activity relationships, where polymeric vanadia clusters favor the production of butenes and butadienes, whereas more isolated species are highly effective in creating polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons retained on the catalyst surface after the reaction.
4. The primary reactions involve the formation of retained carbon and the creation of butenes and butadienes.
5. Although more isolated species exhibit the highest activity in carbon formation, the data depicted in Figure 5(a) indicate that polymeric vanadia species display the highest activity in the dehydrogenation reaction.
6. The change in the nature of the VOx species after regeneration was confirmed by UVvis spectroscopy studies.
