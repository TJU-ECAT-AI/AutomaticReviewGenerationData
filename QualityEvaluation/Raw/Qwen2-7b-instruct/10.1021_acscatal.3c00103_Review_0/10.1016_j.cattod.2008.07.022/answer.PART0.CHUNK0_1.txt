[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials."
[2] "Despite this, there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played by the different surface species present on supported catalysts."
[3] "Isolated vanadia species show high activity, but very low selectivity due to the undesirable formation of coke."

[5] "The formation of polymeric vanadates from V2O5-like surface species can be achieved through treatment with O2 at high temperatures, thereby increasing catalytic activity."
[6] "After regeneration, the catalytic activity of the catalysts changes as a result of transformations to both the surface VOx species and the pure support, with vanadium appearing to catalyse a phase transformation in Al2O3 above 823 K."
[7] "The polyolefinic coke species removed by high temperature regeneration are not however the principle source of catalyst deactivation, which can instead be assigned to tightly bound reaction intermediates."

In addressing the growing industrial demand for propylene and the constraints posed by traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques offer a viable solution. These methods enable the conversion of propane into propylene, a key component in the manufacturing of various fuels, plastics, and other materials. Innovations in catalyst design focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. 

For instance, researchers aim to develop catalysts capable of selectively converting propane to propylene without the formation of undesired byproducts, such as coke. This is achieved by utilizing vanadia-based catalysts that can be transformed from vanadate-like surface species into polymeric vanadates at high temperatures, thus boosting catalytic activity. Moreover, the regeneration process plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst efficiency. By removing tightly bound reaction intermediates rather than solely focusing on polyolefinic coke, catalysts can regain their performance after being exposed to harsh reaction conditions. This approach ensures a sustainable and efficient PDH process that meets the demands of modern industry.

针对丙烷对丙烯以及传统生产方式带来的巨大工业需求和限制，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术提供了有效的解决方案。这些方法能够将丙烷转化为丙烯，这是燃料、塑料和其他材料制造的关键成分。在催化剂设计方面的创新集中在克服催化剂失活问题、提高稳定性和提高再生性，以适应氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程。

例如，研究人员致力于开发能够选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯而不会产生不希望的副产品如焦炭的催化剂。这通过利用基于五氧化二钒的催化剂实现，这些催化剂能够在高温下从类似范德华表面物种转化为聚型范德华，从而增强催化活性。此外，再生过程对于维持催化剂效率至关重要。通过去除紧密绑定的反应中间体而不是仅专注于聚烯烃焦炭，催化剂可以在暴露于苛刻反应条件后恢复其性能。这种方法确保了满足现代工业需求的PDH过程的可持续性和高效性。
