The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] . Such reactions are believed to proceed via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which reduced VOx centres that form during reaction are reoxidised by gas-phase oxygen. Recently, studies have investigated the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes over supported VOx catalysts in the absence of gas-phase oxygen where a different reaction mechanism must operate [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] .

To address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques focus on developing innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature highlights the importance of supported VOx catalysts in PDH reactions, where the mechanism involves the formation of reduced VOx centers during reaction and their reoxidation by gas-phase oxygen in ODH. However, in direct dehydrogenation of alkanes without gas-phase oxygen, a different reaction mechanism is required. This suggests that advancements in catalyst design could lead to more efficient PDH processes that better meet industrial demands for propylene production.

为应对丙烯工业需求增长及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术专注于开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略旨在克服催化剂失活问题、提高稳定性并改善在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中的可回收性。文献强调了支持型VOx催化剂在PDH反应中的重要性，其中反应机制涉及形成还原态VOx中心及其在气相氧参与下的重新氧化。然而，在无气相氧参与的烷烃直接脱氢中，需要不同的反应机制。这表明，催化剂设计的进步可能能够实现更高效的PDH过程，更好地满足工业对丙烯生产的需要。

1. PDH techniques specifically address the industrial demand for propylene by utilizing advanced catalysts and processes that efficiently convert propane to propylene. The focus is on developing catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and pressures, ensuring a steady production of propylene with minimal energy consumption and waste generation.

2. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to improve PDH processes include the use of supported VOx catalysts, which are tailored for both oxidative and nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are designed to have optimized surface properties, such as size, shape, and composition, to maximize the conversion of propane to propylene. Strategies also involve improving the catalyst's thermal stability, enhancing its ability to withstand repeated cycles, and increasing its recyclability.

3. These strategies overcome deactivation issues by incorporating features that prevent catalyst poisoning, maintain high activity even under harsh operating conditions, and enable easy regeneration. Enhanced stability is achieved through the use of robust catalyst materials and optimized reaction conditions. Improved recyclability is facilitated by designing catalysts that can be easily separated from the reaction products, allowing for their reuse without significant loss of efficiency.
