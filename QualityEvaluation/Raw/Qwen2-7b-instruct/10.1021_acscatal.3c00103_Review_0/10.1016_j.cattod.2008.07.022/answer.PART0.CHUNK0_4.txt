Industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are addressed through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These methods enable the conversion of propane to propylene, a critical feedstock for various industries. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For example, the literature discusses the importance of vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts and their structureactivity relationships. It highlights that isolated vanadia species exhibit high activity but low selectivity due to the formation of coke, whereas polymeric VOx species show better selectivity for the desired C4 dehydrogenation products. The catalysts' structure, influenced by factors like vanadium loading, calcination, and regeneration, plays a crucial role in determining their activity and selectivity. The literature also mentions that the deactivation of these catalysts is not primarily due to the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons but rather to tightly bound reaction intermediates.

工业界对丙烯的需求以及传统生产方法的局限性通过丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术得到解决。这些方法能够将丙烷转化为丙烯，这是许多行业的重要原料。创新的催化剂设计策略旨在克服失活问题、提高稳定性并改善氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程的可回收性。例如，文献强调了二氧化钒（VOx）催化剂及其活性与结构之间的关系的重要性。它指出，孤立的钒酸盐物种表现出高活性但低选择性，因为它们会导致焦炭的形成，而聚态VOx物种则显示出对所需C4脱氢产物更高的选择性。催化剂的结构，受如钒负载量、煅烧和再生等因素的影响，对于确定其活性和选择性起着关键作用。文献还提到，这些催化剂的失活主要不是由于大环芳烃的形成，而是由于紧密结合的反应中间体造成的。
