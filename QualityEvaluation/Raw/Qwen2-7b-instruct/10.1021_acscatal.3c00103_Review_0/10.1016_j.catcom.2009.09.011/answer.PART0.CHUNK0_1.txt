<p>Conversion of carbon dioxide almost did not change and was close to zero within a wide range of feed compositions.</p>
<p>The highest temperature below which carbon dioxide was not activated and did not take part in the isobutane dehydrogenation process was around 800-826 K.</p>
<p>At higher temperatures, carbon dioxide is consumed and takes part in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion.</p>
<p>It seems to be reasonable to assume that carbon dioxide removes hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhances isobutane conversion to isobutene as predicted by the thermodynamic calculations done for the two-step pathway of the dehydrogenation process.</p>

1. Carbon dioxide exhibited minimal conversion within a broad range of feed compositions, indicating it did not actively participate in the isobutane dehydrogenation process under these conditions.
2. Activation of carbon dioxide occurred at temperatures above approximately 800-826 Kelvin, enabling its involvement in the dehydrogenation process.
3. Above the specified temperature range, carbon dioxide consumption facilitated the dehydrogenation process, increasing the conversion of alkane substances.
4. It is plausible that carbon dioxide aids in removing hydrogen from the reaction mixture, thereby promoting the conversion of isobutane to isobutene, aligning with thermodynamic predictions for the two-step dehydrogenation pathway.

1. 在广泛的产品组成范围内，二氧化碳的转化率几乎不变且接近零，这表明在这些条件下它没有积极参与异丁烷脱氢过程。
2. 碳氧化合物的激活发生在约800-826开尔文以上的温度，这使得其参与脱氢过程成为可能。
3. 在指定的温度范围内以上，消耗碳氧化合物促进了脱氢过程，增加了烷烃的转化率。
4. 可以合理假设，二氧化碳有助于从反应混合物中去除氢，从而促进异丁烷转化为异丁烯，这与脱氢过程的两步途径的热力学计算预测相吻合。
