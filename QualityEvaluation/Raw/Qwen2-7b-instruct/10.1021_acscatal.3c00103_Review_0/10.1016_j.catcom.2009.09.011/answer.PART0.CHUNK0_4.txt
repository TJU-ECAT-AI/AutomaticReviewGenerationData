The study focuses on analyzing the most probable pathways of isobutane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide over vanadiummagnesium oxide catalyst. The experiments were conducted under atmospheric pressure with a constant total flow velocity of reagents, varying the initial molar ratio of CO2 (or He) to iC4H10 from 1 to 26. At a higher temperature, specifically 873 K, carbon dioxide was activated and consumed, with its conversion decreasing from 12 to 4 as the partial pressure increased. The two-step reaction pathway was found to give the highest hydrocarbon conversions across all reaction temperatures and reagent molar ratios. Below 800 K, isobutene was primarily produced through simple dehydrogenation, while CO2 acted as an inert gas. Above 826 K, carbon dioxide became consumable and participated in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. The presence of CO2 above 826 K led to a beneficial effect on the dehydrogenation reaction. Conversion of isobutane in the dehydrogenation reaction was unaffected by the presence of CO2 in the feed. The introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modified the physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface, increasing its acidity, which led to significant differences in the reaction outcomes, including alkane conversion, selectivity to desired olefins, and catalyst deactivation rates. However, the ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate the VMgOx catalyst was insufficient, as heating the catalyst in pure CO2 flow did not recover its initial activity.

研究的重点是分析异丁烷在氧化镁钒催化剂上的脱氢反应中二氧化碳的作用机制。实验在大气压下进行，保持反应物的总流速恒定（5400 cm3/h gcat），同时改变二氧化碳（或氦气）与iC4H10的初始摩尔比从1到26。在温度更高时，即873 K，二氧化碳被激活并消耗，其转化率从12降至4，随着二氧化碳分压的增加。两步反应途径被发现能够在所有反应温度和反应物摩尔比下提供最高的烃类转化率。低于800 K时，主要通过简单脱氢产生异丁烯，而二氧化碳作为惰性气体存在。高于826 K时，二氧化碳参与脱氢过程，提高整体烷烃转化率。二氧化碳在826 K以上对脱氢反应表现出有益的影响。二氧化碳的存在提高了异丁烷的转化率。异丁烷在脱氢反应中的转化不受二氧化碳在反应流中的存在影响。向反应流中引入弱酸性二氧化碳改变了催化剂表面的物理化学性质，增加了其酸度，导致反应结果的显著差异，包括烷烃转化率、目标烯烃选择性和催化剂结焦速率。然而，二氧化碳再生VMgOx催化剂的能力不足，因为将催化剂在纯二氧化碳流中加热无法恢复其初始活性。
