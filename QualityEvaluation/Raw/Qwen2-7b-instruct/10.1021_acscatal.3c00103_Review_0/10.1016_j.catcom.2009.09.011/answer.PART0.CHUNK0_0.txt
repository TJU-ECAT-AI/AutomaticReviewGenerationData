[1] "Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol)."
[2] "Further investigations showed that some catalysts were able to activate carbon dioxide, so these catalysts could be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[3] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."
[4] "The aim of study is analysis of the most probable pathways of the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction with carbon dioxide over vanadiummagnesium oxide catalyst."
[5] "The highest temperature below which carbon dioxide was not activated and did not take part in the isobutane dehydrogenation process was around 800826 K."
[6] "At higher temperatures, carbon dioxide is consumed and takes part in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion."
[7] "On the other hand, the differences observed at the temperature below 873 K can be caused by changes of the active center character."
[8] "Thus, the majority of researchers still consider the redox cycle as a prevailing mechanism for dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 over various transition metal oxide catalysts."
[9] "Nevertheless, the results of our investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over various vanadium oxide supported catalysts have shown that the latter situation occurs only when the catalyst surface contains strong basic sites."
[10] "Thus, medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalyst, is found to be most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an efficient means to convert propane into propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Key factors in these strategies include the optimization of catalyst composition, structure, and activity to ensure effective activation of carbon dioxide and propane at high temperatures. The research indicates that the activation of carbon dioxide requires the presence of a catalyst and typically begins around 800-826 K. Above this temperature, carbon dioxide becomes an active participant in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. The results suggest that the acid-base properties of the catalyst play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism, making medium-strength basicity and acidity optimal for the activation of both propane and carbon dioxide. This approach aligns with the thermodynamic analysis, which predicts that carbon dioxide removal of hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhancement of isobutane conversion to isobutene are likely outcomes.
