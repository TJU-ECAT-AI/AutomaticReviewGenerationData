[1] "Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol)."
[2] "Further investigations showed that some catalysts were able to activate carbon dioxide, so these catalysts could be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[3] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."
[4] "The aim of study is analysis of the most probable pathways of the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction with carbon dioxide over vanadiummagnesium oxide catalyst."
[5] "The highest temperature below which carbon dioxide was not activated and did not take part in the isobutane dehydrogenation process was around 800826 K."
[6] "At higher temperatures, carbon dioxide is consumed and takes part in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion."
[7] "On the other hand, the differences observed at the temperature below 873 K can be caused by changes of the active center character."
[8] "Thus, the majority of researchers still consider the redox cycle as a prevailing mechanism for dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 over various transition metal oxide catalysts."
[9] "Nevertheless, the results of our investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over various vanadium oxide supported catalysts have shown that the latter situation occurs only when the catalyst surface contains strong basic sites."
[10] "Thus, medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalyst, is found to be most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an efficient means to convert propane into propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Key factors in these strategies include the optimization of catalyst composition, structure, and activity to ensure effective activation of carbon dioxide and propane at high temperatures. The research indicates that the activation of carbon dioxide requires the presence of a catalyst and typically begins around 800-826 K. Above this temperature, carbon dioxide becomes an active participant in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. The results suggest that the acid-base properties of the catalyst play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism, making medium-strength basicity and acidity optimal for the activation of both propane and carbon dioxide. This approach aligns with the thermodynamic analysis, which predicts that carbon dioxide removal of hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhancement of isobutane conversion to isobutene are likely outcomes.

在对丙烯日益增长的工业需求和传统生产方法的局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种高效的将丙烷转化为丙烯的方法来应对这些挑战。正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略旨在解决催化剂失活问题、提高稳定性并增强循环利用能力，在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中。这些策略的关键要素包括优化催化剂组成、结构和活性，以确保有效激活二氧化碳和丙烷在高温下的活性。研究结果表明，二氧化碳的激活需要催化剂的存在，并通常开始于约800-826 K的温度。在此温度以上，二氧化碳成为脱氢过程中的积极参与者，从而增强整体烷烃转化率。研究结果表明，催化剂的酸碱性质在反应机制中起着关键作用，中等强度的基本性和酸性被认为是同时激活丙烷和二氧化碳的理想条件。这与热力学分析预测的结果相吻合，即二氧化碳从反应混合物中移除氢并增强异丁烷转化为异丁烯很可能是可能的结果。

1. Carbon dioxide exhibited minimal conversion within a broad range of feed compositions, indicating it did not actively participate in the isobutane dehydrogenation process under these conditions.
2. Activation of carbon dioxide occurred at temperatures above approximately 800-826 Kelvin, enabling its involvement in the dehydrogenation process.
3. Above the specified temperature range, carbon dioxide consumption facilitated the dehydrogenation process, increasing the conversion of alkane substances.
4. It is plausible that carbon dioxide aids in removing hydrogen from the reaction mixture, thereby promoting the conversion of isobutane to isobutene, aligning with thermodynamic predictions for the two-step dehydrogenation pathway.

1. 在广泛的产品组成范围内，二氧化碳的转化率几乎不变且接近零，这表明在这些条件下它没有积极参与异丁烷脱氢过程。
2. 碳氧化合物的激活发生在约800-826开尔文以上的温度，这使得其参与脱氢过程成为可能。
3. 在指定的温度范围内以上，消耗碳氧化合物促进了脱氢过程，增加了烷烃的转化率。
4. 可以合理假设，二氧化碳有助于从反应混合物中去除氢，从而促进异丁烷转化为异丁烯，这与脱氢过程的两步途径的热力学计算预测相吻合。

[1] "For a long time carbon dioxide was traditionally considered as an inert gas in the gas phase oxidation reactions."
[2] "This opinion resulted from relatively high thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecule under typical reaction conditions."
[3] "Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol)."
[4] "Further investigations showed that some catalysts were able to activate carbon dioxide, so these catalysts could be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[5] "On that basis, the researchers from Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT) developed a process for production of styrene from ethylbenzene using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant."
[6] "The KRICTDECSO process was implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operating at Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with the styrene production capacity of 100 tons per day."
[7] "Nevertheless, from the available literature it can be found that mechanism of the dehydrogenation strongly depends on such physicochemical properties of the catalyst as reducibility and acidity."
[8] "For lower hydrocarbons, most often used catalysts contain such elements as chromium, vanadium, iron, molybdenum, manganese, and other easily reducible oxides."
[9] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."
[10] "Also, Michorczyk reported similar results for a silica supported chromium oxide catalyst."
[11] "There can be also another possibility, where CO2 does not take part in the dehydrogenation reaction, but acts as an inert gas (i.e., it decreases partial pressure of the alkane feed and delivers heat required for the endothermic reaction)."
[12] "The aim of study is analysis of the most probable pathways of the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction with carbon dioxide over vanadiummagnesium oxide catalyst."
[13] "The experiments were done under atmospheric pressure and constant total flow velocity of the reagents (5400 cm3/h gcat) while the initial molar ratio of CO2 (or He) to iC4H10 was varied from 1 to 26."
[14] "At the temperature higher by 100, where carbon dioxide was activated and consumed at 873 K over VMgOx catalyst (conversion of CO2 decreased from 12 to 4 with its increasing partial pressure)."
[15] "The highest temperature below which carbon dioxide was not activated and did not take part in the isobutane dehydrogenation process was around 800826 K."
[16] "The beneficial effect of CO2 can be related to its gasification properties."
[17] "The isobutane dehydrogenation reaction at 873 K combined with periodical heating of the catalyst bed under carbon dioxide and oxygen flow at the same temperature was employed for examining the ability of CO2 to regenerate the catalyst."
[18] "The ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate VMgOx catalyst was insufficient, because heating of the used-up catalyst in pure CO2 flow did not recover its initial activity."
[19] "On the other hand, even small volume of air was able to reoxidize VMgOx surface."
[20] "It can be concluded that poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide reduces significantly contribution of redox mechanism to the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[21] "The acidbase properties of both the catalyst and the reagents seem to be essential for the reaction course over VMgOx."
[22] "The results obtained for isopropanol decomposition reaction carried out in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide over series of VMgOx catalysts proved that introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modified physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface by increasing its acidity."
[23] "In [8], [15], [30] we found also the opposite effect, where strong interaction of CO2 with the catalyst surface decreased the catalyst activity."
[24] "Thus, it can be concluded that medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalyst, is found to be most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process."
[25] "The catalytic tests and the kinetic investigations (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, respectively) prove that carbon dioxide activation requires presence of the catalyst and starts at the temperature about 800826 K."
[26] "This activation changes the overall reaction mechanism."
[27] "At lower temperatures carbon dioxide behaves as an inert gas – it merely decreases the hydrocarbon partial pressure."
[28] "On the other hand, above 826 K conversion of CO2 over VMgOx catalyst in both the dehydrogenation of isobutane and RWGS reaction becomes measurable."
[29] "Moreover, H2/CO molar ratio depends on both the isobutene yield and the carbon dioxide partial pressure."
[30] "Thus, it seems to be reasonable to assume that carbon dioxide removes hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhances isobutane conversion to isobutene as predicted by the thermodynamic calculations done for the two-step pathway of the dehydrogenation process."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, the document discusses how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by focusing on the activation of carbon dioxide through the use of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The document highlights that for the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the role of carbon dioxide is crucial only at temperatures above approximately 800-826 K, indicating that it can act as an inert gas at lower temperatures by decreasing the hydrocarbon partial pressure. However, at higher temperatures, carbon dioxide can be activated and participate in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing the overall conversion of isobutane to isobutene. The document further explains that the acid-base properties of both the catalyst and the reagents play a significant role in the reaction course over vanadium-magnesium oxide (VMgOx) catalysts, suggesting that medium-strength basicity and acidity are most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process. The document also mentions that the redox mechanism contributes significantly to the dehydrogenation reaction, but the poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide limits its contribution, emphasizing the importance of the acid-base properties over the redox mechanism in the activation of carbon dioxide.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法限制的背景下，文献讨论了丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术如何解决这些挑战，重点是通过催化剂激活二氧化碳。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服失活问题、提高稳定性和提高在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中可回收性。文献指出，在大约800-826 K以上的温度下，二氧化碳对于异丁烷脱氢至关重要，此时它可以作为惰性气体，仅通过降低烃类的分压来发挥作用。然而，在较高温度下，二氧化碳可以被激活并参与脱氢过程，从而增强异丁烷转化为异丁烯的整体转化率。文献进一步解释说，催化剂和反应物的酸碱性质在使用范德镁氧（VMgOx）催化剂时对反应路径起着重要作用，表明中等强度的基本性和酸性是使异丁烷和二氧化碳在脱氢过程中被激活的最佳条件。文献还提到，还原氧化机制对脱氢反应贡献显著，但二氧化碳的还原能力较差限制了其贡献，强调了酸碱性质比还原氧化机制在激活二氧化碳的重要性。

The document discusses how the activation of carbon dioxide requires the presence of a catalyst and occurs at temperatures around 800-826 K. This activation changes the overall reaction mechanism, allowing carbon dioxide to participate in the dehydrogenation process and enhance alkane conversion. The document also mentions that the acid-base properties of both the catalyst and the reactants play a crucial role in the reaction route, suggesting that the redox cycle is not the predominant mechanism in the presence of carbon dioxide over various transition metal oxide catalysts. The document highlights the importance of considering the catalyst's reducibility and acidity for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process. Furthermore, the document explores the use of periodic heating with carbon dioxide and oxygen at the same temperature to examine the catalyst's regeneration ability.

The study focuses on analyzing the most probable pathways of isobutane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide over vanadiummagnesium oxide catalyst. The experiments were conducted under atmospheric pressure with a constant total flow velocity of reagents, varying the initial molar ratio of CO2 (or He) to iC4H10 from 1 to 26. At a higher temperature, specifically 873 K, carbon dioxide was activated and consumed, with its conversion decreasing from 12 to 4 as the partial pressure increased. The two-step reaction pathway was found to give the highest hydrocarbon conversions across all reaction temperatures and reagent molar ratios. Below 800 K, isobutene was primarily produced through simple dehydrogenation, while CO2 acted as an inert gas. Above 826 K, carbon dioxide became consumable and participated in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. The presence of CO2 above 826 K led to a beneficial effect on the dehydrogenation reaction. Conversion of isobutane in the dehydrogenation reaction was unaffected by the presence of CO2 in the feed. The introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modified the physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface, increasing its acidity, which led to significant differences in the reaction outcomes, including alkane conversion, selectivity to desired olefins, and catalyst deactivation rates. However, the ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate the VMgOx catalyst was insufficient, as heating the catalyst in pure CO2 flow did not recover its initial activity.

研究的重点是分析异丁烷在氧化镁钒催化剂上的脱氢反应中二氧化碳的作用机制。实验在大气压下进行，保持反应物的总流速恒定（5400 cm3/h gcat），同时改变二氧化碳（或氦气）与iC4H10的初始摩尔比从1到26。在温度更高时，即873 K，二氧化碳被激活并消耗，其转化率从12降至4，随着二氧化碳分压的增加。两步反应途径被发现能够在所有反应温度和反应物摩尔比下提供最高的烃类转化率。低于800 K时，主要通过简单脱氢产生异丁烯，而二氧化碳作为惰性气体存在。高于826 K时，二氧化碳参与脱氢过程，提高整体烷烃转化率。二氧化碳在826 K以上对脱氢反应表现出有益的影响。二氧化碳的存在提高了异丁烷的转化率。异丁烷在脱氢反应中的转化不受二氧化碳在反应流中的存在影响。向反应流中引入弱酸性二氧化碳改变了催化剂表面的物理化学性质，增加了其酸度，导致反应结果的显著差异，包括烷烃转化率、目标烯烃选择性和催化剂结焦速率。然而，二氧化碳再生VMgOx催化剂的能力不足，因为将催化剂在纯二氧化碳流中加热无法恢复其初始活性。
