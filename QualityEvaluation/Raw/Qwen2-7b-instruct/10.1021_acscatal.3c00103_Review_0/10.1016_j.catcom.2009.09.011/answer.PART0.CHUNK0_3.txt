[1] "For a long time carbon dioxide was traditionally considered as an inert gas in the gas phase oxidation reactions."
[2] "This opinion resulted from relatively high thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecule under typical reaction conditions, (i.e., under atmospheric pressure and the temperature far below 1273 K)."
[3] "Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol)."
[4] "In the early nineties, however, it was found that addition of small amounts of CO2 (below 0.5%) to ethylbenzene feed in the presence of a commercial dehydrogenation catalyst decreased the catalyst deactivation by coke formation."
[5] "Further investigations showed that some catalysts were able to activate carbon dioxide, so these catalysts could be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[6] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."
[7] "The other reports claim that carbon dioxide influences the reaction course by modifying acidbase properties of the catalyst surface."
[8] "Michorczyk and Ogonowski [31] and Zheng et al. [32] concluded that the activation of carbon dioxide required temperatures higher than 823 K."
[9] "Consequently, conversion of isobutane in the dehydrogenation reaction was independent of the presence of CO2 in the feed."
[10] "The beneficial effect of CO2 can be related to its gasification properties."
[11] "Nevertheless, as it was shown in [26], the amount of coke generated during the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 was always higher than that in helium."
[12] "Carbon dioxide stream was able to gasify some part of the carbonaceous deposit formed on VMgOx catalyst surface, but it did not remove all the deposit under steady-state conditions, even though under atmospheric pressure at 873 K the time of Boudouard reaction was equal to the time of isobutane dehydrogenation in helium."
[13] "Thus, the rate of coking was faster than the rate of decoking."
[14] "The isobutane dehydrogenation reaction at 873 K combined with periodical heating of the catalyst bed under carbon dioxide and oxygen flow at the same temperature was employed for examining the ability of CO2 to regenerate the catalyst."

The document discusses how the activation of carbon dioxide requires the presence of a catalyst and occurs at temperatures around 800-826 K. This activation changes the overall reaction mechanism, allowing carbon dioxide to participate in the dehydrogenation process and enhance alkane conversion. The document also mentions that the acid-base properties of both the catalyst and the reactants play a crucial role in the reaction route, suggesting that the redox cycle is not the predominant mechanism in the presence of carbon dioxide over various transition metal oxide catalysts. The document highlights the importance of considering the catalyst's reducibility and acidity for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process. Furthermore, the document explores the use of periodic heating with carbon dioxide and oxygen at the same temperature to examine the catalyst's regeneration ability.

文献讨论了二氧化碳激活需要催化剂的存在，并在约800-826 K的温度下发生。这种激活改变了整个反应机制，使二氧化碳能够参与脱氢过程并增强烷烃转化率。文献还提到催化剂和反应物的酸碱性质对反应路径至关重要，暗示在含有二氧化碳的各种过渡金属氧化物催化剂中，还原性循环不是主要机制。文献强调考虑催化剂的可还原性和酸碱性对于激活异丁烷和二氧化碳在脱氢过程中的重要性。此外，文献探讨了使用二氧化碳和相同温度下的氧气进行周期性加热来检查催化剂再生能力的方法。
