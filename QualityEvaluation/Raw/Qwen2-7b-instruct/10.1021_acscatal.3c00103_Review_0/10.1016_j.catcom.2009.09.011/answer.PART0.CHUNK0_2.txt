[1] "For a long time carbon dioxide was traditionally considered as an inert gas in the gas phase oxidation reactions."
[2] "This opinion resulted from relatively high thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecule under typical reaction conditions."
[3] "Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol)."
[4] "Further investigations showed that some catalysts were able to activate carbon dioxide, so these catalysts could be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[5] "On that basis, the researchers from Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT) developed a process for production of styrene from ethylbenzene using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant."
[6] "The KRICTDECSO process was implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operating at Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with the styrene production capacity of 100 tons per day."
[7] "Nevertheless, from the available literature it can be found that mechanism of the dehydrogenation strongly depends on such physicochemical properties of the catalyst as reducibility and acidity."
[8] "For lower hydrocarbons, most often used catalysts contain such elements as chromium, vanadium, iron, molybdenum, manganese, and other easily reducible oxides."
[9] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."
[10] "Also, Michorczyk reported similar results for a silica supported chromium oxide catalyst."
[11] "There can be also another possibility, where CO2 does not take part in the dehydrogenation reaction, but acts as an inert gas (i.e., it decreases partial pressure of the alkane feed and delivers heat required for the endothermic reaction)."
[12] "The aim of study is analysis of the most probable pathways of the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction with carbon dioxide over vanadiummagnesium oxide catalyst."
[13] "The experiments were done under atmospheric pressure and constant total flow velocity of the reagents (5400 cm3/h gcat) while the initial molar ratio of CO2 (or He) to iC4H10 was varied from 1 to 26."
[14] "At the temperature higher by 100, where carbon dioxide was activated and consumed at 873 K over VMgOx catalyst (conversion of CO2 decreased from 12 to 4 with its increasing partial pressure)."
[15] "The highest temperature below which carbon dioxide was not activated and did not take part in the isobutane dehydrogenation process was around 800826 K."
[16] "The beneficial effect of CO2 can be related to its gasification properties."
[17] "The isobutane dehydrogenation reaction at 873 K combined with periodical heating of the catalyst bed under carbon dioxide and oxygen flow at the same temperature was employed for examining the ability of CO2 to regenerate the catalyst."
[18] "The ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate VMgOx catalyst was insufficient, because heating of the used-up catalyst in pure CO2 flow did not recover its initial activity."
[19] "On the other hand, even small volume of air was able to reoxidize VMgOx surface."
[20] "It can be concluded that poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide reduces significantly contribution of redox mechanism to the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[21] "The acidbase properties of both the catalyst and the reagents seem to be essential for the reaction course over VMgOx."
[22] "The results obtained for isopropanol decomposition reaction carried out in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide over series of VMgOx catalysts proved that introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modified physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface by increasing its acidity."
[23] "In [8], [15], [30] we found also the opposite effect, where strong interaction of CO2 with the catalyst surface decreased the catalyst activity."
[24] "Thus, it can be concluded that medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalyst, is found to be most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process."
[25] "The catalytic tests and the kinetic investigations (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, respectively) prove that carbon dioxide activation requires presence of the catalyst and starts at the temperature about 800826 K."
[26] "This activation changes the overall reaction mechanism."
[27] "At lower temperatures carbon dioxide behaves as an inert gas – it merely decreases the hydrocarbon partial pressure."
[28] "On the other hand, above 826 K conversion of CO2 over VMgOx catalyst in both the dehydrogenation of isobutane and RWGS reaction becomes measurable."
[29] "Moreover, H2/CO molar ratio depends on both the isobutene yield and the carbon dioxide partial pressure."
[30] "Thus, it seems to be reasonable to assume that carbon dioxide removes hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhances isobutane conversion to isobutene as predicted by the thermodynamic calculations done for the two-step pathway of the dehydrogenation process."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, the document discusses how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by focusing on the activation of carbon dioxide through the use of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The document highlights that for the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the role of carbon dioxide is crucial only at temperatures above approximately 800-826 K, indicating that it can act as an inert gas at lower temperatures by decreasing the hydrocarbon partial pressure. However, at higher temperatures, carbon dioxide can be activated and participate in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing the overall conversion of isobutane to isobutene. The document further explains that the acid-base properties of both the catalyst and the reagents play a significant role in the reaction course over vanadium-magnesium oxide (VMgOx) catalysts, suggesting that medium-strength basicity and acidity are most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process. The document also mentions that the redox mechanism contributes significantly to the dehydrogenation reaction, but the poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide limits its contribution, emphasizing the importance of the acid-base properties over the redox mechanism in the activation of carbon dioxide.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法限制的背景下，文献讨论了丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术如何解决这些挑战，重点是通过催化剂激活二氧化碳。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服失活问题、提高稳定性和提高在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中可回收性。文献指出，在大约800-826 K以上的温度下，二氧化碳对于异丁烷脱氢至关重要，此时它可以作为惰性气体，仅通过降低烃类的分压来发挥作用。然而，在较高温度下，二氧化碳可以被激活并参与脱氢过程，从而增强异丁烷转化为异丁烯的整体转化率。文献进一步解释说，催化剂和反应物的酸碱性质在使用范德镁氧（VMgOx）催化剂时对反应路径起着重要作用，表明中等强度的基本性和酸性是使异丁烷和二氧化碳在脱氢过程中被激活的最佳条件。文献还提到，还原氧化机制对脱氢反应贡献显著，但二氧化碳的还原能力较差限制了其贡献，强调了酸碱性质比还原氧化机制在激活二氧化碳的重要性。
