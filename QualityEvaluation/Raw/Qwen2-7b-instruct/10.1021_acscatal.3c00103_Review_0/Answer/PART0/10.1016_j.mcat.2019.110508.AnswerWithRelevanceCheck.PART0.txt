          [3] "In short, isolated Zn2+ species and small bonded ZnO clusters were both reported to serve as LAS which were able to facilitate the heterolytic CH bond cleavage and simultaneously depressed the rupture of CC bond."
          [4] "It is widely known that the catalytic activity of transition metal catalyst is greatly determined by the properties of supports, while the researches on ZnO catalysts supported on various materials in PDH are not enough."
          [5] "The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."
          [6] "As a result, the catalytic performance and reaction stability of the ZnO catalysts increase as rationally elevating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support."
          [7] "Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites."
