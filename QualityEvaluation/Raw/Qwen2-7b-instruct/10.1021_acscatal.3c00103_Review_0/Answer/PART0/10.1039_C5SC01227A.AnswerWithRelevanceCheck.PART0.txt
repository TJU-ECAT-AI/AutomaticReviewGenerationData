          [1] "Along with the decreasing fossil oil reserves and development on utilization of nature gas and shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) seems to be a promising alternative to produce propylene."
          [2] "The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
          [3] "On Ni(100), the rate determining step for CH4 decomposition is the D1 step, with >120 kJ mol1 barrier. The barriers of the other three steps are <65 kJ mol1."
          [4] "The existence of Au atoms also changes the electronic structure of neighboring Ni atoms, which leads to higher dissociation barriers, by 16 and 38 kJ mol1 on a Ni atom with one and two gold neighbors, respectively, compared with the barrier on clean Ni(111)."
          [5] "Similar as the discussion of alloy for methane dehydrogenation, the lower reactivity (i.e. higher dehydrogenation barrier) on PtSn alloy is due to the deeper d-band center compared to pure Pt."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production that is more efficient and flexible. Innovations in catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. For instance, adding promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides can increase robustness against coking. In oxidative PDH, the binding energy of propylene can be weakened through alloying, enhancing stability. In nonoxidative PDH, embedding a more reactive Rh atom to a less reactive surface can alter dehydrogenation pathways.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种更高效、更灵活的丙烯生产途径，来应对工业对丙烯需求的增长以及传统生产方法的局限性。在催化剂设计策略的创新中，旨在克服失活问题、提高稳定性并改善可回收性。例如，添加诸如过渡后期金属、主族金属包括Sn和Ga、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物等促进剂可以增强抗结焦能力。在氧化PDH中，可以通过合金化减弱丙烯的结合能，从而提高稳定性。在非氧化PDH中，嵌入一个活性更高的Rh原子到活性较低的表面上，可以改变脱氢路径。
