The thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecules under typical reaction conditions leads to low conversion rates of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K (less than 2%), due to the low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol). However, further investigations have revealed that certain catalysts can activate carbon dioxide, enabling its use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. This has been demonstrated through the development of a styrene production process from ethylbenzene using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant by researchers from the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). The KRICTDECSO process was successfully implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operated by Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with a daily styrene production capacity of 100 tons. The mechanism of dehydrogenation is highly dependent on the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, such as reducibility and acidity. For lower hydrocarbons, catalysts often contain elements like chromium, vanadium, iron, molybdenum, and manganese. Recent experiments on VMgOx catalysts have shown that reoxidation of species reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K is difficult and cannot restore the initial high oxidation state of vanadium cations. Additionally, Michorczyk's findings on a silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst corroborate this observation. While carbon dioxide can act as an inert gas, decreasing the partial pressure of alkane feed and delivering heat for the endothermic reaction, it can also be activated and consumed in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. The activation of carbon dioxide requires the presence of a catalyst and typically starts at temperatures around 800-826 K. The ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate VMgOx catalysts is limited; however, even a small volume of air can reoxidize the VMgOx surface. Poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide reduces the contribution of the redox mechanism to the dehydrogenation reaction, emphasizing the importance of the acid-base properties of both the catalyst and the reagents in the reaction course over VMgOx. The results of experiments on isobutane dehydrogenation show that the introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modifies the physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface, increasing its acidity. However, strong interactions between CO2 and the catalyst surface can decrease catalyst activity. Overall, medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalysts, are found to be most suitable for activating both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process. This approach aligns with thermodynamic calculations predicting enhanced isobutane conversion to isobutene when carbon dioxide is involved in the process.", "Chinese": "在对丙烯日益增长的工业需求和传统生产方法限制的背景下，二氧化碳在丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术中的作用经历了从传统上被视为气体相氧化反应中的惰性气体转变为潜在活性成分在氧化性脱氢过程中扮演角色的转变。CO2分子在典型反应条件下的热力学稳定性导致2273 K下碳氧化合物向CO和O2的转化率较低（少于2%），由于反应焓（在298 K时为293 kJ/mol）的低值。然而，进一步的研究揭示了一些催化剂能够激活二氧化碳，使其在氧化性脱氢反应中发挥作用。韩国化学技术研究所（KRICT）的研究人员通过使用二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂开发了从乙苯生产苯乙烯的过程，证明了这一点。KRICTDECSO过程在韩国的一个试点工厂成功实施，由三星通用化学品有限公司（SGC）运营，每天的苯乙烯生产能力为100吨。脱氢机制高度依赖于催化剂的物理化学性质，如可还原性和酸碱性。对于较低的碳氢化合物，催化剂通常包含如铬、钒、铁、钼和锰这样的元素。在VMgOx催化剂上的实验显示，用纯CO2在873 K下还原的物种很难重新氧化，无法恢复钒离子的原始高氧化状态。此外，Michorczyk关于二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂的发现也证实了这一观察结果。虽然二氧化碳可以作为惰性气体，仅通过降低烷烃的分压并提供所需的热量来促进反应，但它也可以被激活并在脱氢过程中消耗，从而增强整体烷烃转化率。二氧化碳的激活需要催化剂的存在，并通常开始在约800-826 K的温度下。二氧化碳再生VMgOx催化剂的能力有限；然而，即使是少量空气也能重新氧化VMgOx表面。二氧化碳的还原能力较弱减少了还原氧化机制对脱氢反应的贡献，强调了催化剂和反应物的酸碱性质在VMgOx催化剂上反应过程中的重要性。实验结果显示，将弱酸性CO2引入反应流中可以修改催化剂表面的物理化学性质，增加其酸度。然而，CO2与催化剂表面的强烈相互作用可以降低催化剂活性。总的来说，中等强度的基本性和酸性，典型地存在于VMgOx催化剂中，被发现是最适合激活异丁烷和二氧化碳在脱氢过程中的条件。这与热力学计算一致，预测当二氧化碳参与过程时，异丁烷转化为异丁烯的可能性会增加。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2009.09.011"},

The thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecules under typical reaction conditions leads to low conversion rates of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K (less than 2%), due to the low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol). However, further investigations have revealed that certain catalysts can activate carbon dioxide, enabling its use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. This has been demonstrated through the development of a styrene production process from ethylbenzene using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant by researchers from the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). The KRICTDECSO process was successfully implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operated by Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with a daily styrene production capacity of 100 tons. The mechanism of dehydrogenation is highly dependent on the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, such as reducibility and acidity. For lower hydrocarbons, catalysts often contain elements like chromium, vanadium, iron, molybdenum, and manganese. Recent experiments on VMgOx catalysts have shown that reoxidation of species reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K is difficult and cannot restore the initial high oxidation state of vanadium cations. Additionally, Michorczyk's findings on a silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst corroborate this observation. While carbon dioxide can act as an inert gas, decreasing the partial pressure of alkane feed and delivering heat for the endothermic reaction, it can also be activated and consumed in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. The activation of carbon dioxide requires the presence of a catalyst and typically starts at temperatures around 800-826 K. The ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate VMgOx catalysts is limited; however, even a small volume of air can reoxidize the VMgOx surface. Poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide reduces the contribution of the redox mechanism to the dehydrogenation reaction, emphasizing the importance of the acid-base properties of both the catalyst and the reagents in the reaction course over VMgOx. The results of experiments on isobutane dehydrogenation show that the introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modifies the physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface, increasing its acidity. However, strong interactions between CO2 and the catalyst surface can decrease catalyst activity. Overall, medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalysts, are found to be most suitable for activating both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process.

The thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecules under typical reaction conditions leads to low conversion rates of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K (less than 2%), due to the low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol). However, further investigations have revealed that certain catalysts can activate carbon dioxide, enabling its use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

However, strong interactions between CO2 and the catalyst surface can decrease catalyst activity. Overall, medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalysts, are found to be most suitable for activating both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process. This approach aligns with thermodynamic calculations predicting enhanced isobutane conversion to isobutene when carbon dioxide is involved in the process.", "Chinese": "在对丙烯日益增长的工业需求和传统生产方法限制的背景下，二氧化碳在丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术中的作用经历了从传统上被视为气体相氧化反应中的惰性气体转变为潜在活性成分在氧化性脱氢过程中扮演角色的转变。CO2分子在典型反应条件下的热力学稳定性导致2273 K下碳氧化合物向CO和O2的转化率较低（少于2%），由于反应焓（在298 K时为293 kJ/mol）的低值。然而，进一步的研究揭示了一些催化剂能够激活二氧化碳，使其在氧化性脱氢反应中发挥作用。韩国化学技术研究所（KRICT）的研究人员通过使用二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂开发了从乙苯生产苯乙烯的过程，证明了这一点。KRICTDECSO过程在韩国的一个试点工厂成功实施，由三星通用化学品有限公司（SGC）运营，每天的苯乙烯生产能力为100吨。脱氢机制高度依赖于催化剂的物理化学性质，如可还原性和酸碱性。对于较低的碳氢化合物，催化剂通常包含如铬、钒、铁、钼和锰这样的元素。在VMgOx催化剂上的实验显示，用纯CO2在873 K下还原的物种很难重新氧化，无法恢复钒离子的原始高氧化状态。此外，Michorczyk关于二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂的发现也证实了这一观察结果。虽然二氧化碳可以作为惰性气体，仅通过降低烷烃的分压并提供所需的热量来促进反应，但它也可以被激活并在脱氢过程中消耗，从而增强整体烷烃转化率。二氧化碳的激活需要催化剂的存在，并通常开始在约800-826 K的温度下。二氧化碳再生VMgOx催化剂的能力有限；然而，即使是少量空气也能重新氧化VMgOx表面。二氧化碳的还原能力较弱减少了还原氧化机制对脱氢反应的贡献，强调了催化剂和反应物的酸碱性质在VMgOx催化剂上反应过程中的重要性。实验结果显示，将弱酸性CO2引入反应流中可以修改催化剂表面的物理化学性质，增加其酸度。然而，CO2与催化剂表面的强烈相互作用可以降低催化剂活性。总的来说，中等强度的基本性和酸性，典型地存在于VMgOx催化剂中，被发现是最适合激活异丁烷和二氧化碳在脱氢过程中的条件。这与热力学计算一致，预测当二氧化碳参与过程时，异丁烷转化为异丁烯的可能性会增加。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2009.09.011"},
