To address the growing industrial demand for propylene and overcome the limitations of traditional production methods, researchers are focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques offer a more efficient way to produce propylene, which is crucial in various industries such as petrochemicals and plastics manufacturing. In PDH processes, scientists are developing innovative catalyst design strategies aimed at overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing the stability of the catalysts, and improving their recyclability.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering more efficient and sustainable methods for propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies aim to increase yield, reduce energy consumption, and prolong catalyst life, thereby contributing to more environmentally friendly and economically viable propylene production.

The active site isolation strategy has proven effective in enhancing the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation (PDH). A novel catalyst, CoOx@NC/S-1, was synthesized through a two-step process involving the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded onto silicalite-1 under nitrogen, followed by calcination in air. This catalyst exhibits outstanding PDH performance, with a 40% propane conversion rate and a propene selectivity exceeding 97%. Notably, the catalyst maintains its activity without significant deactivation after a 10-hour reaction at 600°C. The active sites on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst were confirmed through a series of characterization techniques, including hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction, diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst was explored by examining both the forward PDH process and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods, the role of carbon dioxide in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques has evolved from being traditionally considered an inert gas in gas-phase oxidation reactions to a potentially active component in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecules under typical reaction conditions leads to low conversion rates of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K (less than 2%), due to the low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol). However, further investigations have revealed that certain catalysts can activate carbon dioxide, enabling its use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. This has been demonstrated through the development of a styrene production process from ethylbenzene using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant by researchers from the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). The KRICTDECSO process was successfully implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operated by Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with a daily styrene production capacity of 100 tons. The mechanism of dehydrogenation is highly dependent on the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, such as reducibility and acidity. For lower hydrocarbons, catalysts often contain elements like chromium, vanadium, iron, molybdenum, and manganese. Recent experiments on VMgOx catalysts have shown that reoxidation of species reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K is difficult and cannot restore the initial high oxidation state of vanadium cations. Additionally, Michorczyk's findings on a silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst corroborate this observation. While carbon dioxide can act as an inert gas, decreasing the partial pressure of alkane feed and delivering heat for the endothermic reaction, it can also be activated and consumed in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. The activation of carbon dioxide requires the presence of a catalyst and typically starts at temperatures around 800-826 K. The ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate VMgOx catalysts is limited; however, even a small volume of air can reoxidize the VMgOx surface. Poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide reduces the contribution of the redox mechanism to the dehydrogenation reaction, emphasizing the importance of the acid-base properties of both the catalyst and the reagents in the reaction course over VMgOx. The results of experiments on isobutane dehydrogenation show that the introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modifies the physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface, increasing its acidity. However, strong interactions between CO2 and the catalyst surface can decrease catalyst activity. Overall, medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalysts, are found to be most suitable for activating both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process. This approach aligns with thermodynamic calculations predicting enhanced isobutane conversion to isobutene when carbon dioxide is involved in the process.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques tackle the issues of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering an efficient alternative pathway to convert propane into propylene. The development of low-cost, eco-friendly, and stable catalyst systems for PDH, particularly those involving ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites, is essential. These catalysts display exceptional selectivity and stability in PDH, making them promising for industrial propylene production. The high-silica HZSM-5 support contributes to the dispersion of Zn species and minimizes side reactions, enhancing catalytic performance and reaction stability. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are economical, non-toxic, and reusable, making them an attractive option for industrial propylene production.
