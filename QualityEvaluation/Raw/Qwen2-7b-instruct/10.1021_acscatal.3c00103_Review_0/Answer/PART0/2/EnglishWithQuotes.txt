The thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecules under typical reaction conditions leads to low conversion rates of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K (less than 2%), due to the low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol). However, further investigations have revealed that certain catalysts can activate carbon dioxide, enabling its use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. This has been demonstrated through the development of a styrene production process from ethylbenzene using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant by researchers from the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). The KRICTDECSO process was successfully implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operated by Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with a daily styrene production capacity of 100 tons.

While carbon dioxide can act as an inert gas, decreasing the partial pressure of alkane feed and delivering heat for the endothermic reaction, it can also be activated and consumed in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. The activation of carbon dioxide requires the presence of a catalyst and typically starts at temperatures around 800-826 K. The ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate VMgOx catalysts is limited; however, even a small volume of air can reoxidize the VMgOx surface. Poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide reduces the contribution of the redox mechanism to the dehydrogenation reaction, emphasizing the importance of the acid-base properties of both the catalyst and the reagents in the reaction course over VMgOx. The results of experiments on isobutane dehydrogenation show that the introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modifies the physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface, increasing its acidity. However, strong interactions between CO2 and the catalyst surface can decrease catalyst activity. Overall, medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalysts, are found to be most suitable for activating both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process.

The thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecules under typical reaction conditions leads to low conversion rates of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K (less than 2%), due to the low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol). However, further investigations have revealed that certain catalysts can activate carbon dioxide, enabling its use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. This has been demonstrated through the development of a styrene production process from ethylbenzene using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant by researchers from the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). The KRICTDECSO process was successfully implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operated by Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with a daily styrene production capacity of 100 tons.

While carbon dioxide can act as an inert gas, decreasing the partial pressure of alkane feed and delivering heat for the endothermic reaction, it can also be activated and consumed in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. The activation of carbon dioxide requires the presence of a catalyst and typically starts at temperatures around 800-826 K. The ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate VMgOx catalysts is limited; however, even a small volume of air can reoxidize the VMgOx surface. Poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide reduces the contribution of the redox mechanism to the dehydrogenation reaction, emphasizing the importance of the acid-base properties of both the catalyst and the reagents in the reaction course over VMgOx. The results of experiments on isobutane dehydrogenation show that the introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modifies the physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface, increasing its acidity. However, strong interactions between CO2 and the catalyst surface can decrease catalyst activity. Overall, medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalysts, are found to be most suitable for activating both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process.

The thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecules under typical reaction conditions leads to low conversion rates of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K (less than 2%), due to the low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol). However, further investigations have revealed that certain catalysts can activate carbon dioxide, enabling its use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The KRICTDECSO process was successfully implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operated by Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with a daily styrene production capacity of 100 tons.

While carbon dioxide can act as an inert gas, decreasing the partial pressure of alkane feed and delivering heat for the endothermic reaction, it can also be activated and consumed in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. The activation of carbon dioxide requires the presence of a catalyst and typically starts at temperatures around 800-826 K. The ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate VMgOx catalysts is limited; however, even a small volume of air can reoxidize the VMgOx surface. Poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide reduces the contribution of the redox mechanism to the dehydrogenation reaction, emphasizing the importance of the acid-base properties of both the catalyst and the reagents in the reaction course over VMgOx. The results of experiments on isobutane dehydrogenation show that the introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modifies the physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface, increasing its acidity. However, strong interactions between CO2 and the catalyst surface can decrease catalyst activity. Overall, medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalysts, are found to be most suitable for activating both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process.
