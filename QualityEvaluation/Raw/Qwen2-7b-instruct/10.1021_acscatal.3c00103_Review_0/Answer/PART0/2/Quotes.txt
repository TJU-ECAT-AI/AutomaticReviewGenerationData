[1] "For a long time carbon dioxide was traditionally considered as an inert gas in the gas phase oxidation reactions."
          [2] "This opinion resulted from relatively high thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecule under typical reaction conditions."
          [3] "Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol)."
          [4] "Further investigations showed that some catalysts were able to activate carbon dioxide, so these catalysts could be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "On that basis, the researchers from Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT) developed a process for production of styrene from ethylbenzene using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant."
          [6] "The KRICTDECSO process was implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operating at Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with the styrene production capacity of 100 tons per day."
          [7] "Nevertheless, from the available literature it can be found that mechanism of the dehydrogenation strongly depends on such physicochemical properties of the catalyst as reducibility and acidity."
          [8] "For lower hydrocarbons, most often used catalysts contain such elements as chromium, vanadium, iron, molybdenum, manganese, and other easily reducible oxides."
          [9] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."

          [11] "There can be also another possibility, where CO2 does not take part in the dehydrogenation reaction, but acts as an inert gas (i.e., it decreases partial pressure of the alkane feed and delivers heat required for the endothermic reaction)."
          [12] "The aim of study is analysis of the most probable pathways of the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction with carbon dioxide over vanadiummagnesium oxide catalyst."
          [13] "The experiments were done under atmospheric pressure and constant total flow velocity of the reagents (5400 cm3/h gcat) while the initial molar ratio of CO2 (or He) to iC4H10 was varied from 1 to 26."

          [15] "The highest temperature below which carbon dioxide was not activated and did not take part in the isobutane dehydrogenation process was around 800826 K."

          [17] "The isobutane dehydrogenation reaction at 873 K combined with periodical heating of the catalyst bed under carbon dioxide and oxygen flow at the same temperature was employed for examining the ability of CO2 to regenerate the catalyst."

          [19] "On the other hand, even small volume of air was able to reoxidize VMgOx surface."
          [20] "It can be concluded that poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide reduces significantly contribution of redox mechanism to the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [21] "The acidbase properties of both the catalyst and the reagents seem to be essential for the reaction course over VMgOx."
          [22] "The results obtained for isopropanol decomposition reaction carried out in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide over series of VMgOx catalysts proved that introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modified physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface by increasing its acidity."
          [23] "In [8], [15], [30] we found also the opposite effect, where strong interaction of CO2 with the catalyst surface decreased the catalyst activity."
          [24] "Thus, it can be concluded that medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalyst, is found to be most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process."
          [25] "The catalytic tests and the kinetic investigations (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, respectively) prove that carbon dioxide activation requires presence of the catalyst and starts at the temperature about 800826 K."
          [26] "This activation changes the overall reaction mechanism."
          [27] "At lower temperatures carbon dioxide behaves as an inert gas – it merely decreases the hydrocarbon partial pressure."
          [28] "On the other hand, above 826 K conversion of CO2 over VMgOx catalyst in both the dehydrogenation of isobutane and RWGS reaction becomes measurable."
          [29] "Moreover, H2/CO molar ratio depends on both the isobutene yield and the carbon dioxide partial pressure."
          [30] "Thus, it seems to be reasonable to assume that carbon dioxide removes hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhances isobutane conversion to isobutene as predicted by the thermodynamic calculations done for the two-step pathway of the dehydrogenation process."

          [6] "As a result, the catalytic performance and reaction stability of the ZnO catalysts increase as rationally elevating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support."
          [7] "Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites."

          "Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
          "This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."
          "The active sites of CoOx@NC/S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
          "In order to understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) were investigated using in situ FT-IR."

[1] "For a long time carbon dioxide was traditionally considered as an inert gas in the gas phase oxidation reactions."
          [2] "This opinion resulted from relatively high thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecule under typical reaction conditions."
          [3] "Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol)."
          [4] "Further investigations showed that some catalysts were able to activate carbon dioxide, so these catalysts could be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "On that basis, the researchers from Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT) developed a process for production of styrene from ethylbenzene using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant."
          [6] "The KRICTDECSO process was implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operating at Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with the styrene production capacity of 100 tons per day."
          [7] "Nevertheless, from the available literature it can be found that mechanism of the dehydrogenation strongly depends on such physicochemical properties of the catalyst as reducibility and acidity."
          [8] "For lower hydrocarbons, most often used catalysts contain such elements as chromium, vanadium, iron, molybdenum, manganese, and other easily reducible oxides."
          [9] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."
          [10] "Also, Michorczyk reported similar results for a silica supported chromium oxide catalyst."
          [11] "There can be also another possibility, where CO2 does not take part in the dehydrogenation reaction, but acts as an inert gas (i.e., it decreases partial pressure of the alkane feed and delivers heat required for the endothermic reaction)."
          [12] "The aim of study is analysis of the most probable pathways of the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction with carbon dioxide over vanadiummagnesium oxide catalyst."
          [13] "The experiments were done under atmospheric pressure and constant total flow velocity of the reagents (5400 cm3/h gcat) while the initial molar ratio of CO2 (or He) to iC4H10 was varied from 1 to 26."
          [14] "At the temperature higher by 100, where carbon dioxide was activated and consumed at 873 K over VMgOx catalyst (conversion of CO2 decreased from 12 to 4 with its increasing partial pressure)."
          [15] "The highest temperature below which carbon dioxide was not activated and did not take part in the isobutane dehydrogenation process was around 800826 K."
          [16] "The beneficial effect of CO2 can be related to its gasification properties."
          [17] "The isobutane dehydrogenation reaction at 873 K combined with periodical heating of the catalyst bed under carbon dioxide and oxygen flow at the same temperature was employed for examining the ability of CO2 to regenerate the catalyst."
          [18] "The ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate VMgOx catalyst was insufficient, because heating of the used-up catalyst in pure CO2 flow did not recover its initial activity."
          [19] "On the other hand, even small volume of air was able to reoxidize VMgOx surface."
          [20] "It can be concluded that poor oxidizing power of carbon dioxide reduces significantly contribution of redox mechanism to the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [21] "The acidbase properties of both the catalyst and the reagents seem to be essential for the reaction course over VMgOx."
          [22] "The results obtained for isopropanol decomposition reaction carried out in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide over series of VMgOx catalysts proved that introduction of weakly acidic CO2 into the reaction stream modified physicochemical properties of the catalyst surface by increasing its acidity."
          [23] "In [8], [15], [30] we found also the opposite effect, where strong interaction of CO2 with the catalyst surface decreased the catalyst activity."
          [24] "Thus, it can be concluded that medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalyst, is found to be most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process."
          [25] "The catalytic tests and the kinetic investigations (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, respectively) prove that carbon dioxide activation requires presence of the catalyst and starts at the temperature about 800826 K."
          [26] "This activation changes the overall reaction mechanism."
          [27] "At lower temperatures carbon dioxide behaves as an inert gas – it merely decreases the hydrocarbon partial pressure."
          [28] "On the other hand, above 826 K conversion of CO2 over VMgOx catalyst in both the dehydrogenation of isobutane and RWGS reaction becomes measurable."
          [29] "Moreover, H2/CO molar ratio depends on both the isobutene yield and the carbon dioxide partial pressure."
          [30] "Thus, it seems to be reasonable to assume that carbon dioxide removes hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhances isobutane conversion to isobutene as predicted by the thermodynamic calculations done for the two-step pathway of the dehydrogenation process."

[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products."
          [2] "However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."
          [3] "In short, isolated Zn2+ species and small bonded ZnO clusters were both reported to serve as LAS which were able to facilitate the heterolytic CH bond cleavage and simultaneously depressed the rupture of CC bond."
          [4] "It is widely known that the catalytic activity of transition metal catalyst is greatly determined by the properties of supports, while the researches on ZnO catalysts supported on various materials in PDH are not enough."
          [5] "The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."
          [6] "As a result, the catalytic performance and reaction stability of the ZnO catalysts increase as rationally elevating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support."
          [7] "Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites."
          [8] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."
