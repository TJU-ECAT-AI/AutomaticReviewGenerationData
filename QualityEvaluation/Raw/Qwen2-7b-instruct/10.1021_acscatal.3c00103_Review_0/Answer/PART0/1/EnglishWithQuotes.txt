By utilizing the abundance of propane, especially in regions with significant shale gas production, PDH processes become more commercially attractive.\n\nTraditional catalysts, such as those based on platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), are restricted by their high cost and toxicity. In contrast, supported vanadium catalysts are considered a viable alternative due to their high activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The surface hydroxyl groups (OH) on these catalysts play a critical role in enhancing stability and reducing coke formation, thus improving the efficiency and longevity of the PDH process.\n\nTo overcome deactivation issues and improve stability and recyclability, researchers focus on tuning the surface structure and composition of PDH catalysts. This involves studying the evolution of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface under hydrogen (H2) pretreatment conditions and monitoring their impact on catalytic performance. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to simulate the PDH process on various reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) structures, aligning theoretical predictions with experimental observations.\n\nThe development of PDH catalysts with surface hydroxyl groups contributes to the optimization of catalyst design for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.
