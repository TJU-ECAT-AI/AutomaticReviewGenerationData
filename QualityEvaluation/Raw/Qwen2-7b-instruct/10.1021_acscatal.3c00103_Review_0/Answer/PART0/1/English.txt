By utilizing the abundance of propane, especially in regions with significant shale gas production, PDH processes become more commercially attractive.

Traditional catalysts, such as those based on platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), are restricted by their high cost and toxicity. In contrast, supported vanadium catalysts are considered a viable alternative due to their high activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The surface hydroxyl groups (OH) on these catalysts play a critical role in enhancing stability and reducing coke formation, thus improving the efficiency and longevity of the PDH process.
