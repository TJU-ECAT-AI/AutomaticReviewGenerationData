            The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production is evident, with a focus on addressing catalyst deactivation challenges through innovative design strategies to enhance stability and recyclability. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of increasing industrial demand and changing global energy landscapes.

            In oxidative PDH, alloying can weaken propylene binding energy, leading to enhanced selectivity and efficiency. Meanwhile, in nonoxidative PDH, the incorporation of reactive Rh atoms alters dehydrogenation pathways, improving overall performance. Strategies to mitigate catalyst deactivation include the use of late transition metals, main-group metals, and rare-earth metal oxides. These innovations address limitations in traditional methods, such as the low selectivity of Pt-based catalysts and the fast deactivation caused by coke formation.

            The development of single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts represents a significant advancement, leveraging Lewis acid-base interactions to break through the volcano plot, offering improved performance and selectivity towards propylene production. Moreover, the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived catalysts provides a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative, enhancing stability and recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

            The integration of hydroxyl groups and controlled vanadium valence state in vanadium oxide supported catalysts is pivotal in overcoming deactivation, improving stability, and ensuring recyclability. These catalysts exhibit a relatively low dehydrogenation barrier, indicating a high initial activity, while also showing good resistance to coke formation. The use of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites further demonstrates the potential for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH, aligning with efforts to develop green catalyst systems.

            Multiscale simulation has provided valuable insights into the sintering rate and mechanism of supported Pt nanoparticles, influencing their long-term stability and efficiency. By employing innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of novel support materials and optimized particle sizes, researchers are overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability.

            In summary, the evolution of PDH techniques addresses the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods. The focus on innovative catalyst design strategies ensures the sustainability and efficiency of propylene production, paving the way for a more environmentally friendly and economically viable future in the energy sector.
