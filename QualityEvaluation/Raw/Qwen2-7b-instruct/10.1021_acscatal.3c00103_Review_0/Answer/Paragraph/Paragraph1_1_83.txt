The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production, with a focus on addressing catalyst deactivation challenges through innovative design strategies to enhance stability and recyclability in the context of increasing industrial demand and changing global energy landscapes, has been comprehensively reviewed.

        The primary challenges faced by traditional propylene production methods, such as high energy consumption and environmental impacts, have led to a growing interest in PDH technologies. PDH techniques enable the efficient conversion of propane into propylene, making them an attractive alternative for industries looking to meet the increasing demand for this critical chemical feedstock.

        A key issue in PDH is the deactivation of catalysts, particularly those based on noble metals like Pt, which suffer from low selectivity to propylene and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies have emerged to address these challenges, focusing on the development of more stable and recyclable catalysts. For instance, the use of late transition metals, main-group metals, and rare-earth metal oxides has shown promise in enhancing stability and recyclability.

        In oxidative PDH, alloying can weaken the propylene binding energy, leading to more efficient propylene production. In nonoxidative PDH, embedding reactive Rh atoms in the catalyst matrix alters the dehydrogenation pathways, improving the overall process efficiency.

        The rational design of single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts represents a significant advancement in the field of propane dehydrogenation. By leveraging Lewis acid-base interactions, these catalysts offer improved performance and selectivity towards propylene production, contributing significantly to global energy landscapes.

        The journal article titled 'MOF-Derived Iron Catalysts for Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation' discusses innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. This approach aims to provide an environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to traditional methods, addressing the limitations of high energy consumption and hazardous materials usage.

        The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have prompted a shift towards more efficient and environmentally benign PDH techniques. Innovations in catalyst design, such as the development of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts and cobalt-based catalysts, are crucial in tackling deactivation issues, improving stability, and enhancing recyclability. These advancements contribute to the sustainable production of propylene, aligning with the evolving energy landscape and industry needs.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook of this review suggests that future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies, such as the integration of advanced materials science, computational chemistry, and biocatalysis, to further enhance the efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability of PDH processes. There is an opportunity to explore the synergies between different catalytic systems, optimize reaction conditions, and develop multifunctional catalysts capable of performing multiple reactions simultaneously, reducing the overall energy consumption and environmental footprint of propylene production.

        In conclusion, the review highlights the pivotal role of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in addressing the increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. Through the development of innovative catalyst design strategies, PDH technologies can overcome catalyst deactivation challenges, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, making them a sustainable solution for propylene production in the context of evolving global energy landscapes.

        传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战，如高能耗和环境影响，促使人们关注PDH技术。PDH技术能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，使其成为满足这一关键化学原料日益增长需求的有吸引力的选择。

        在PDH过程中，催化剂的失活是一个主要问题，尤其是基于贵金属如Pt的催化剂，其选择性低、丙烯产率低，并且由于焦炭形成而快速失活。创新的催化剂设计策略旨在解决这些挑战，着重于开发更稳定和可回收的催化剂。例如，利用晚期过渡金属、主族金属和稀土金属氧化物已经显示出增强稳定性和可回收性的潜力。

        在氧化PDH中，合金化可以减弱丙烯的结合能，从而提高丙烯的生产效率。在非氧化PDH中，嵌入活性Rh原子到催化剂矩阵中改变了脱氢途径，提高了整体过程效率。

        标题为“基于MOF衍生铁催化剂的非氧化丙烷脱氢”的期刊文章讨论了通过克服失活问题、提高稳定性和增加可回收性来优化两种PDH过程中的催化剂设计策略，提供了传统方法中高能耗和有害材料使用限制的环保和可持续替代方案。

        对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术而言，不断增长的丙烯需求和传统生产方法的局限性引发了向更高效和环境友好的PDH技术的转变。创新的催化剂设计策略，如发展定义良好的支持钒氧化物催化剂和钴基催化剂，对于解决失活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性至关重要。这些进展有助于实现丙烯的可持续生产，符合不断演变的全球能源格局和行业需求。

        该综述强调了丙烷脱氢（PDH）在应对不断增长的丙烯需求和传统生产方法局限性方面的重要作用。通过开发创新的催化剂设计策略，PDH技术可以克服催化剂失活问题，提高稳定性和增强可回收性，使其成为丙烯生产的一个可持续解决方案，在全球能源格局变化的背景下。

        总结而言，该综述突出了丙烷脱氢（PDH）在满足不断增长的丙烯需求和传统生产方法局限性方面的重要性。通过发展创新的催化剂设计策略，PDH技术可以解决催化剂失活问题，提高稳定性和增强可回收性，使其成为一个可持续的丙烯生产解决方案，在全球能源格局变化的背景下。
