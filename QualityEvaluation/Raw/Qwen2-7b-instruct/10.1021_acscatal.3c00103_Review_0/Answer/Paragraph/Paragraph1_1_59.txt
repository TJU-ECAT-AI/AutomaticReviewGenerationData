            The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production, with a focus on addressing catalyst deactivation challenges through innovative design strategies to enhance stability and recyclability in the context of increasing industrial demand and changing global energy landscapes, has been a subject of extensive research. Traditional PDH processes, often relying on precious metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr), face significant limitations including high costs, toxicity, and deactivation issues due to the formation of coke. To overcome these challenges, researchers have turned to a variety of innovative catalyst design strategies.

            Innovative catalysts, such as those based on late transition metals, main-group metals, and rare-earth metal oxides, have been developed to address the deactivation challenges in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts and supported vanadium catalysts have shown promise in enhancing stability and recyclability. In the context of oxidative PDH, alloying can weaken the propylene binding energy, while in nonoxidative PDH, embedding reactive Rh atoms can alter dehydrogenation pathways, improving efficiency and reducing deactivation.

            Moreover, the rational design of single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts represents a significant advancement, leveraging Lewis acid-base interactions to break through traditional 'volcano plots' and offer improved performance and selectivity towards propylene production. This approach aims to overcome deactivation issues and enhance the stability and recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, making PDH a more sustainable and efficient solution for propylene production.

            In the realm of nonoxidative PDH, studies focusing on the surface structure and the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts have highlighted their importance in catalytic performance. These hydroxyl groups, produced under hydrogen pre-reduction, play a crucial role in enhancing the activity and stability of the catalysts. The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere, studied through in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), has provided insights into their impact on catalytic performance.

            The exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH, such as ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites, represents another promising direction. These catalysts not only offer a sustainable solution but also demonstrate high catalytic activity and stability, which increases with the rationally elevated SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the support. The ease of preparation and low cost of this catalyst system make it a promising alternative for PDH.

            Lastly, the use of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes has been shown to improve stability and recyclability. These catalysts address the challenges posed by deactivation issues, offering a promising avenue for propylene production through PDH.

            在工业需求增长和全球能源格局变化的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的一种有前景的替代方案，正吸引着越来越多的关注。传统PDH工艺通常依赖铂（Pt）和铬（Cr）等贵金属，面临着高成本、毒性以及由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活等问题。为解决这些挑战，研究人员正在开发一系列创新的催化剂设计策略，以增强稳定性并提高可回收性。

            创新的催化剂，包括基于晚期过渡金属、主族金属和稀土氧化物的催化剂，被开发用于解决氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中的失活问题。例如，在氧化性PDH中，合金化可以削弱丙烯的结合能，而在非氧化性PDH中，嵌入反应性的铑（Rh）原子可以改变脱氢途径，从而提高效率并减少失活。

            此外，单原子掺杂Ga2O3催化剂的合理设计代表了重要的进展，通过Lewis酸碱相互作用打破了传统的“火山图”，提供了改进的性能和丙烯选择性。这种策略旨在克服失活问题，增强催化剂在氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中的稳定性和可回收性，使PDH成为丙烯生产的一种更加可持续和高效的解决方案。

            针对非氧化性PDH，对VOx/Al2O3催化剂表面结构和表面附着羟基群的重要角色进行了深入研究，强调了它们在催化性能中的关键作用。在氢预还原下产生的羟基群对催化剂活性和稳定性具有重要影响。通过原位差示反射红外傅里叶变换光谱（DRIFTS）研究了表面羟基群在氢气氛下的演化过程，这提供了深入了解其对催化性能影响的洞察。

            对于低成本且绿色的催化剂系统，如在高硅HZSM-5沸石上支持的ZnO催化剂，提出了另一种有前景的方向。这些催化剂不仅提供了一种可持续的解决方案，而且表现出高度的催化活性和稳定性，其随支持材料中SiO2/Al2O3比例的理性增加而增加。该催化剂系统的易制备性和低成本使其成为PDH的有前途的选择。

            最后，对支持的五氧化二钒催化剂在氧化性脱氢过程中进行研究，显示了增强稳定性和可回收性的潜力。这些催化剂解决了由失活问题带来的挑战，为通过PDH生产丙烯提供了有希望的途径。

            整体理解和未来展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进展和发现，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来的研究努力可能集中在开发结合不同材料优势的催化剂、探索多种元素的协同效应、优化合成条件以实现更好的稳定性和选择性，并提高可回收性。此外，集成先进的表征技术，如原位光谱方法，可以提供关于催化剂在PDH过程中动态行为的更深层次的见解，指导设计更高效和可持续的催化剂。未来的工作也可能致力于调整催化剂的电子和结构特性，以实现最佳的反应性和稳定性，使PDH成为一种更具灵活性和环境友好型的丙烯生产方法。
