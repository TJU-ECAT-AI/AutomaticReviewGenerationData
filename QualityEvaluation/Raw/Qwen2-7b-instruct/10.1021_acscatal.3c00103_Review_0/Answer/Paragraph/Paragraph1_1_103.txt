                <p>Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol). However, some catalysts are able to activate carbon dioxide, making these catalysts suitable for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore the initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations. The aim of study is analysis of the most probable pathways of the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction with carbon dioxide over vanadiummagnesium oxide catalyst. The highest temperature below which carbon dioxide was not activated and did not take part in the isobutane dehydrogenation process was around 800-826 K. At higher temperatures, carbon dioxide is consumed and takes part in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion.</p>
                <p>Medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalyst, is found to be most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process. This insight highlights the importance of catalyst conditions in dehydrogenation processes.</p>

                <p>With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production. For industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively. The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance.</p>
                <p>A VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation method and the V loading is 6wt%, which is less than the theoretical monolayer V loading (12wt%) on γ-Al2O3. The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, which mainly contains V4+ species throughout the reaction, exhibits a relatively low PDH activity but good resistance to coke formation. DFT calculations are applied to simulate the PDH process on different reduced VOx structures, and the results coincide well with experiments. As shown in Figure 1a, the initial activity of the 6V catalysts decreased as H2 pretreatment time increased. The hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface are saturated before the H2 treatment. The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is firstly reduced by H2, and the V=O structure on the outermost surface is combined with the adsorbed H2 molecules to form an adsorbed H2O.</p>
                <p>Our previous study has shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition. The catalyst reduced by H2 mainly shows the valence state of 4+, while the VOx species on the fresh catalyst is reduced to a lower valence state (mainly 3+) under C3H8. As shown in Figure 4b and Table S8, the highest dehydrogenation barrier, 1.98eV, was observed over V2O5H2, which is consistent with the lowest initial activity observed experimentally with the existence of a surface VOH group. The highly reduced V2O3 cluster, without V=O and VOH, prevents C3H6 desorption and promotes its dehydrogenation to form coke. Unlike oxidative propane dehydrogenation, the reduction environment keeps vanadium oxide at low oxidative state and propane dehydrogenation continues by a non-oxidative mechanism.</p>

                <p>Innovations in catalyst design, especially utilizing ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites, aim to enhance stability and recyclability, overcoming deactivation issues. Key findings highlight the superior catalytic activity and stability of ZnO catalysts on high-silica HZSM-5 support, making them a promising, low-cost, and environmentally-friendly solution for PDH, aligning with efforts to develop green catalyst systems.</p>
                <p>Through multiscale simulation, researchers explored the sintering rate and mechanism of supported Pt nanoparticles, finding it influenced by factors such as temperature, particle size, and support material properties. Innovative catalyst design strategies, including the use of novel support materials and optimized particle sizes, aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.</p>

                <p>将二氧化碳转换为CO和O2在2273 K下的百分比低于2%，由于反应焓值（298 K时的ΔH为293 kJ/mol）较低。然而，一些催化剂能够激活二氧化碳，使其适合氧化脱氢反应。我们的实验表明，在873 K下使用纯CO2还原VMgOx催化剂时，很难重新氧化由氢还原的物种，并且无法恢复初始的高氧化态钒离子。研究的目标是对异丁烷与二氧化碳在范德镁氧化物催化剂上的脱氢反应进行分析。在800-826 K以下的最高温度下，二氧化碳未被激活并且未参与异丁烷脱氢过程。在更高温度下，二氧化碳被消耗并参与脱氢过程，从而提高整体烷烃转化率。</p>

                <p>一种VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂通过浸渍法合成，V负载为6wt%，低于γ-Al2O3上理论的单层V负载（12wt%）。覆盖有羟基团的催化剂，主要含有V4+物种在整个反应过程中，表现出相对较低的PDH活性但良好的焦炭形成抵抗力。密度泛函理论（DFT）应用于不同还原VOx结构的PDH过程模拟，实验结果与之相符。如图1a所示，6V催化剂的初始活动随H2预处理时间增加而降低。γ-Al2O3表面的羟基团在H2处理前就已经饱和。VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂首先由H2还原，外表面的V=O结构与吸附的H2分子结合形成吸附的H2O。</p>
                <p>我们之前的研究表明，钒催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积。通过H2还原的催化剂主要显示4+价态，而新鲜催化剂在C3H8下还原至较低价态（主要是3+）。如图4b和表S8所示，观察到V2O5H2的最大脱氢能垒为1.98eV，这与实验中存在表面VOH组分时观测到的最低初始活性一致。高度还原的V2O3簇，没有V=O和VOH，阻止C3H6脱附并促进其脱氢形成焦炭。与氧化性丙烷脱氢不同，还原环境保持了钒氧化物的低氧化状态，并继续以非氧化性机制进行丙烷脱氢。</p>
