        Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers a viable alternative for propylene production, tackling increasing industrial demand and limitations in traditional methods. Innovations in catalyst design, such as the use of late transition metals, main-group metals, and rare-earth metal oxides, enhance stability and recyclability. In oxidative PDH, alloying can weaken propylene binding energy, while in nonoxidative PDH, embedding reactive Rh atoms alters dehydrogenation pathways. These strategies address catalyst deactivation challenges, improving efficiency and flexibility in propylene production.
        
        The rational design of single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts represents a significant advancement in the field of propane dehydrogenation, aiming to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. By leveraging the Lewis acid-base interactions, these catalysts offer improved performance and selectivity towards propylene production, contributing significantly to global energy landscapes.
        
        Propane dehydrogenation techniques efficiently address the growing industrial demand for propylene by providing an alternative method to traditional production techniques, which often suffer from limited efficiency and high energy consumption. Recent studies focus on developing efficient, environmentally friendly catalysts, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which enhance stability and recyclability. MOF-derived iron catalysts show promise in nonoxidative PDH processes, offering improved activity, selectivity, and stability over conventional catalysts.
        
        The journal article titled 'MOF-Derived Iron Catalysts for Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation' discusses innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. This development targets overcoming deactivation issues, improving stability, and increasing recyclability, making PDH a sustainable solution for propylene production.
        
        Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the challenges posed by traditional methods and increasing industrial demand by offering a more efficient and sustainable route to propylene production. Innovations in catalyst design strategies tackle deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, making PDH a promising alternative in the evolving energy landscape.
        
        Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol). Further investigations showed that some catalysts were able to activate carbon dioxide, so these catalysts could be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations. The aim of study is analysis of the most probable pathways of the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction with carbon dioxide over vanadiummagnesium oxide catalyst.
        
        At higher temperatures, carbon dioxide is consumed and takes part in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion. On the other hand, the differences observed at the temperature below 873 K can be caused by changes of the active center character. Thus, the majority of researchers still consider the redox cycle as a prevailing mechanism for dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 over various transition metal oxide catalysts.
        
        Nevertheless, the results of our investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over various vanadium oxide supported catalysts have shown that the latter situation occurs only when the catalyst surface contains strong basic sites. Thus, medium-strength basicity and acidity, typical for VMgOx catalyst, is found to be most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process.
        
        The increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of innovative catalyst design strategies. Propane dehydrogenation techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. These techniques aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.
        
        With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production. For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively. The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance.
        
        A VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation method and the V loading is 6wt%, which is less than the theoretical monolayer V loading (12wt%) on γ-Al2O3. The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). It is shown that hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction.
        
        The catalyst reduced by H2 mainly shows the valence state of 4+, while the VOx species on the fresh catalyst is reduced to a lower valence state (mainly 3+) under C3H8. As shown in Figure4b and TableS8, the highest dehydrogenation barrier, 1.98eV, was observed over V2O5H2, which is consistent with the lowest initial activity observed experimentally with the existence of a surface VOH group. The highly reduced V2O3 cluster, without V=O and VOH, prevents C3H6 desorption and promotes its dehydrogenation to form coke. Unlike oxidative propane dehydrogenation, the reduction environment keeps vanadium oxide at low oxidative state and propane dehydrogenation continues by a non-oxidative mechanism.
        
        The facile and highly effective ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is environmentally friendly, low-cost, and easy to be prepared, representing a promising propane dehydrogenation catalyst. As a result, the catalytic performance and reaction stability of the ZnO catalysts increase as rationally elevating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support.
        
        Through multiscale simulation, researchers explored the sintering rate and mechanism of supported Pt nanoparticles, finding it influenced by factors such as temperature, particle size, and support material properties. Innovative catalyst design strategies, including the use of novel support materials and optimized particle sizes, aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Innovations in catalyst design, notably the development of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, tackle deactivation challenges, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. These advancements in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes aim to optimize propylene yield, reduce energy consumption, and decrease environmental impact, making PDH a promising solution in the evolving energy landscape.
        
        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to its potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact compared to conventional processes. One of the main challenges in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is the deactivation of catalysts, which limits their long-term stability and efficiency. To overcome deactivation issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, to improve stability and recyclability.
        
        Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility. These catalysts, especially those with isolated active sites, offer enhanced stability and recyclability, addressing deactivation issues in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. They aim to improve performance, reduce energy consumption, and decrease environmental impact, making PDH a sustainable solution for propylene production.
