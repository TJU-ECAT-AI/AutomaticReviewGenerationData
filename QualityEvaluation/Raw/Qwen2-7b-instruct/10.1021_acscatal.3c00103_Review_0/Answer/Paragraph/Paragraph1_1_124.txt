The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production, with a focus on addressing catalyst deactivation challenges through innovative design strategies to enhance stability and recyclability in the context of increasing industrial demand and changing global energy landscapes.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to its potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact compared to conventional processes. One of the main challenges in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is the deactivation of catalysts, which limits their long-term stability and efficiency. To overcome deactivation issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, to improve stability and recyclability. This approach aims to break through the 'volcano plot' by leveraging the Lewis acid-base interactions, optimizing the electronic structure and coordination environment for enhanced catalytic activity.

        Innovative catalyst design strategies, including the use of late transition metals, main-group metals, and rare-earth metal oxides, enhance stability and recyclability. In oxidative PDH, alloying can weaken propylene binding energy, while in nonoxidative PDH, embedding reactive Rh atoms alters dehydrogenation pathways. These strategies address catalyst deactivation challenges, improving efficiency and flexibility in propylene production.

        The journal article titled 'MOF-Derived Iron Catalysts for Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation' discusses innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Recent studies focus on developing efficient, environmentally friendly catalysts, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which offer potential solutions to the aforementioned issues. MOF-derived iron catalysts show promise in nonoxidative PDH processes due to their enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability compared to conventional catalysts.

        The catalyst reduced by H2 mainly shows the valence state of 4+, while the VOx species on the fresh catalyst is reduced to a lower valence state (mainly 3+) under C3H8. The hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere are studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). It is shown that hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst. The hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction.

        A VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation method and the V loading is 6wt%, which is less than the theoretical monolayer V loading (12wt%) on γ-Al2O3. The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, which mainly contains V4+ species throughout the reaction, exhibits a relatively low PDH activity but good resistance to coke formation. The intensity of the VOH band is normalized by relative intensity (defined in the experimental section in the Supporting Information) to quantitatively describe the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species. As shown in Figure1a, the initial activity of the 6V catalysts decreased as H2 pretreatment time increased. The hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface are saturated before the H2 treatment. The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is firstly reduced by H2, and the V=O structure on the outer most surface is combined with the adsorbed H2 molecules to form an adsorbed H2O.

        The study aimed to explore the sintering rate and mechanism of supported Pt nanoparticles through multiscale simulation. By employing multiscale simulation, researchers have been able to gain insights into the complex interactions between the nanoparticles and their support material. The results showed that the sintering rate is influenced by factors such as temperature, particle size, and support material properties. Innovative catalyst design strategies, including the use of novel support materials and optimized particle sizes, have been developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability.

        The catalyst system of ZnO loaded on high-silica HZSM-5 exhibits great catalytic activity and reaction stability, offering a thinking for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reaction. The facile and highly effective ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is environmentally friendly, low-cost, and easy to be prepared, representing a promising propane dehydrogenation catalyst.

        The study of propane dehydrogenation catalysts highlights the importance of catalyst conditions in dehydrogenation processes. Insights from quotes indicate that the majority of researchers still consider the redox cycle as a prevailing mechanism for dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 over various transition metal oxide catalysts. Nevertheless, the results of our investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over various vanadium oxide supported catalysts have shown that the latter situation occurs only when the catalyst surface contains strong basic sites. Medium-strength acid-base properties are found to be most appropriate for the activation of both isobutane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process.

        The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques addresses the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. Innovations in catalyst design strategies tackle deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, making PDH a sustainable solution for propylene production in the evolving energy landscape.

Additionally, the development of scalable manufacturing techniques for these catalysts would ensure their practical implementation in the industry. Future studies could also investigate the synergistic effects of combining multiple catalyst types or integrating PDH with other renewable energy sources to create a circular economy for propylene production.

        在氧化脱氢过程中，丙烷转化为丙烯已成为一种有前景的方法，因为它有可能降低与传统工艺相比的能量消耗和环境影响。然而，氧化脱氢过程中的一个主要挑战是催化剂的失活，这限制了其长期稳定性和效率。为克服失活问题，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，如使用定义良好的二氧化钒催化剂，以提高稳定性和可回收性。这种方法旨在通过利用Lewis酸-碱相互作用突破“火山图”，优化电子结构和配位环境，从而提高催化活性。

        创新的催化剂设计策略，包括使用晚期过渡金属、主族金属和稀土金属氧化物，可以增强稳定性和可回收性。在氧化PDH中，合金化可以减弱丙烯结合能，而在非氧化PDH中，嵌入活性Rh原子可以改变脱氢路径。这些策略解决了催化剂失活挑战，提高了丙烯生产的效率和灵活性。

        标题为“基于MOF的铁催化剂用于非氧化丙烷脱氢”的期刊文章讨论了克服失活问题、提高稳定性和增强回收性的创新催化剂设计策略，在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中实现效率和选择性。近期研究重点在于开发高效、环保的催化剂，特别是金属有机框架（MOF），它们提供了解决上述问题的潜在解决方案。MOF衍生的铁催化剂在非氧化PDH过程中显示出改进的活性、选择性和稳定性，相对于常规催化剂而言。

        在氢气预处理时间增加的情况下，6V催化剂的初始活性降低。氢处理前，γ-Al2O3表面的羟基组分被饱和。VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂首先由氢还原，外层表面的氧结构与吸附的氢分子结合形成吸附水。

        通过多尺度模拟探索支持Pt纳米颗粒的烧结速率和机制。研究人员能够通过多尺度模拟获得纳米颗粒与其支撑材料之间复杂相互作用的信息。结果表明，烧结速率受温度、颗粒尺寸和支持材料属性等因素的影响。创新的催化剂设计策略，包括新型支撑材料和优化颗粒尺寸的应用，旨在克服失活问题、提高稳定性和增强可回收性。

        ZnO负载在高硅HZSM-5上形成的催化剂系统表现出极大的催化活性和反应稳定性，为设计高效的过渡金属催化剂提供了思路。易于制备且成本低廉的ZnO催化剂支持在高硅HZSM-5上，代表了有前景的丙烷脱氢催化剂。

        丙烷脱氢催化剂的研究强调了在脱氢过程中催化剂条件的重要性。从引用中可以看出，大多数研究人员仍然认为在二氧化碳存在的各种过渡金属氧化物催化剂下，轻质烃类脱氢的主要机制是氧化还原循环。然而，我们对各种钒氧化物支持催化剂进行的异丁烷脱氢的研究表明，当催化剂表面含有强碱性位点时，才会出现这种情况。中等强度的酸-碱性质被发现最适合激活异丁烷和二氧化碳在脱氢过程中。

        丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术的发展解决了日益增长的工业需求和传统生产方法的局限性。创新的催化剂设计策略解决了失活问题，提高了稳定性和可回收性，使PDH成为丙烯生产在不断变化的能源景观中的可持续解决方案。
