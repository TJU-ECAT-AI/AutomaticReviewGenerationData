The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production, with a focus on addressing catalyst deactivation challenges through innovative design strategies to enhance stability and recyclability in the context of increasing industrial demand and changing global energy landscapes, has been comprehensively reviewed. 

            The advancements in catalyst design strategies for PDH, particularly in oxidative and non-oxidative processes, aim to overcome the deactivation issues faced by traditional catalysts, such as those based on Pt and CrOx. Innovations include the use of late transition metals, main-group metals, and rare-earth metal oxides to improve stability and recyclability. For instance, single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts offer improved performance and selectivity towards propylene production by altering the electronic structure and coordination environment through precise atom doping. The rational design of these catalysts leverages Lewis acid-base interactions to break through traditional limitations and enhance the catalytic activity.

            In the realm of non-oxidative PDH, MOF-derived iron catalysts demonstrate promise in non-oxidative PDH processes due to their enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability compared to conventional catalysts. The development of these catalysts targets overcoming deactivation issues, improving stability, and increasing recyclability, making PDH a sustainable solution for propylene production.

            The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the exploration of low-cost, green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH. ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites represent a promising option, offering a thinking for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reactions. The use of ZnO catalysts on high-silica HZSM-5 support shows great catalytic activity and reaction stability, aligning with efforts to develop environmentally-friendly and low-cost catalyst systems.

            Through multiscale simulation, researchers have gained insights into the sintering rate and mechanism of supported Pt nanoparticles, revealing that the sintering rate is influenced by factors such as temperature, particle size, and support material properties. Innovative catalyst design strategies, including the use of novel support materials and optimized particle sizes, aim to maintain high activity levels while minimizing the risk of agglomeration and deactivation, thus extending the lifetime of the catalyst.

            Critical literature reviews highlight the importance of catalyst conditions in dehydrogenation processes, particularly the role of surface hydroxyl groups on vanadium oxide catalysts. The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere and their impact on catalytic performance provide valuable insights for optimizing catalyst design. DFT calculations are applied to simulate the PDH process on different reduced VOx structures, aligning well with experimental findings.

            The review emphasizes the necessity and urgency of developing low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH, considering the widespread industrial applications of PtSn and CrOx catalysts. The study of sintering rate and mechanism of supported Pt nanoparticles, along with the development of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, addresses the challenges of deactivation, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

            In the context of the changing global energy landscapes, propane dehydrogenation techniques offer a sustainable solution for propylene production, addressing the growing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. The review underscores the importance of innovative catalyst design strategies in overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability, paving the way for future advancements in PDH technology.
