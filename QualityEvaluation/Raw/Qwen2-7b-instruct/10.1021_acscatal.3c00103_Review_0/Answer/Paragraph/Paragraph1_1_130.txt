The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production, with a focus on addressing catalyst deactivation challenges through innovative design strategies to enhance stability and recyclability in the context of increasing industrial demand and changing global energy landscapes, is comprehensively reviewed.

        Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of late transition metals, main-group metals, and rare-earth metal oxides, have been developed to improve the efficiency of PDH processes. In oxidative PDH, alloying can weaken the binding energy of propylene, while in nonoxidative PDH, embedding reactive Rh atoms alters dehydrogenation pathways, addressing catalyst deactivation challenges and improving efficiency and flexibility in propylene production.

        The rational design of single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts represents a significant advancement in the field of PDH, breaking through traditional volcano plots through the leveraging of Lewis acid-base interactions. These catalysts offer improved performance and selectivity towards propylene production, contributing significantly to the evolving energy landscape.

        MOF-derived iron catalysts for nonoxidative PDH processes show promise in enhancing stability, recyclability, and performance via optimized electronic structure and coordination environments, addressing the challenges posed by traditional PDH processes and contributing to sustainable propylene production.

        The increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of innovative catalyst design strategies that address deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. This review highlights the importance of catalyst conditions in dehydrogenation processes, focusing on the activation of carbon dioxide, the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups, and the optimization of catalysts for the activation of both propane and carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process.

        With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the PDH process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production. However, traditional catalysts like Pt and CrOx are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively. The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. Surface hydroxyl groups on these catalysts significantly contribute to stability and coke reduction, enhancing efficiency.

        Innovations in catalyst design, especially utilizing ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites, aim to enhance stability and recyclability, overcoming deactivation issues. This catalyst system of ZnO loaded on high-silica HZSM-5 exhibits great catalytic activity and reaction stability, offering a thinking for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reaction.

        Through multiscale simulation, researchers have been able to gain insights into the complex interactions between the nanoparticles and their support material, influencing the sintering rate. Innovative catalyst design strategies, including the use of novel support materials and optimized particle sizes, have been developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to its potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact compared to conventional processes. To overcome deactivation issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, to improve stability and recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

        The study aimed to explore the sintering rate and mechanism of supported Pt nanoparticles through multiscale simulation, finding that the sintering rate is influenced by factors such as temperature, particle size, and support material properties. Innovations in catalyst design, including novel support materials and optimized particle sizes, aim to maintain high activity levels while minimizing the risk of agglomeration and deactivation, thus extending the lifetime of the catalyst.

        Critical Literature Review of the Kinetics for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane over Well-Defined Supported Vanadium Oxide Catalysts highlights the importance of catalyst design strategies in addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. These advancements in PDH techniques aim to optimize propylene yield, reduce energy consumption, and decrease environmental impact, making PDH a promising solution in the evolving energy landscape.

        In summary, the review underscores the significance of PDH as a viable alternative for propylene production, focusing on innovative catalyst design strategies to address catalyst deactivation challenges, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. These advancements are crucial in addressing the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, contributing to the sustainable production of propylene in the context of changing global energy landscapes.
