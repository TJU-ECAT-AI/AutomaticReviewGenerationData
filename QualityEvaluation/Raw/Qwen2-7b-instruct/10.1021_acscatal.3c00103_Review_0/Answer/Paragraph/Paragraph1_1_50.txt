The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production, with a focus on addressing catalyst deactivation challenges through innovative design strategies to enhance stability and recyclability in the context of increasing industrial demand and changing global energy landscapes.

        The core of this review revolves around the pivotal role of PDH techniques in the production of propylene, a critical feedstock for the chemical industry. As fossil oil reserves dwindle and the utilization of natural gas and shale gas expands, PDH emerges as a feasible alternative, aiming to meet the escalating industrial demand for propylene. However, traditional production methods face limitations such as high energy consumption and environmental impact, necessitating the development of more efficient and sustainable approaches.

        Innovative catalyst design strategies play a central role in overcoming these challenges. For instance, the use of late transition metals, main-group metals, and rare-earth metal oxides has proven to enhance stability and recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. In oxidative PDH, the introduction of alloying elements can weaken the propylene binding energy, facilitating a more efficient conversion. Conversely, in nonoxidative PDH, embedding reactive Rh atoms in the catalyst matrix alters the dehydrogenation pathways, improving selectivity and efficiency.

        A significant breakthrough in this area involves the rational design of single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts, which leverage the synergistic effects of Lewis acid-base interactions to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene production. Moreover, the development of MOF-derived iron catalysts showcases the potential of metal-organic frameworks in achieving better performance, selectivity, and stability, particularly in nonoxidative PDH processes.

        Another notable advancement is the utilization of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites, which not only exhibit remarkable catalytic activity and stability but also offer a low-cost, environmentally friendly, and easily preparable solution for PDH. The systematic characterization of these catalysts, including the analysis of the distribution and forms of Zn species, reveals their potential in overcoming deactivation issues and enhancing the recyclability of the catalysts.

        The integration of hydroxyl groups on the surface of vanadium oxide catalysts has also been shown to significantly contribute to the stability and coke reduction during PDH processes, leading to higher efficiency and extended lifetime of the catalysts. The controlled valence state of vanadium ions and the presence of hydroxyl groups are pivotal in mitigating deactivation, ensuring a balance between activity and stability.

        Furthermore, the development of well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane demonstrates the potential of these catalysts in reducing energy consumption and environmental impact compared to conventional processes. These catalysts not only improve stability and recyclability but also offer a promising avenue for propylene production with minimized environmental footprint.

        The future outlook for PDH technologies is promising, with ongoing research focusing on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Potential future directions include the development of catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability, the optimization of reaction conditions, and the integration of advanced materials science to create multifunctional catalysts capable of addressing multiple challenges simultaneously.

        In conclusion, the advancements in PDH catalyst design strategies have significantly contributed to the enhancement of propylene production efficiency and sustainability. By addressing deactivation issues, improving stability, and increasing recyclability, PDH technologies offer a viable solution for meeting the growing industrial demand for propylene while reducing environmental impact. The continued innovation in this field promises to pave the way for a more sustainable and efficient future in the petrochemical industry.

        然而，传统生产方法面临高能耗和环境影响等局限性，这需要发展更高效、可持续的方法。创新催化剂设计策略在克服这些挑战方面起着关键作用。例如，使用晚期过渡金属、主族金属和稀土金属氧化物可以提高稳定性和可回收性，同时适用于氧化PDH过程和非氧化PDH过程。在氧化PDH过程中，合金元素的引入可以削弱丙烯的结合能，促进更高效的转换。相反，在非氧化PDH过程中，嵌入活性Rh原子改变了脱氢途径，提高了选择性和效率。

        在这一领域的一个显著突破是单原子掺杂Ga2O3催化剂的理性设计，通过Lewis酸碱相互作用增强催化活性和丙烯选择性。此外，MOF衍生的铁催化剂展示了金属有机框架在非氧化PDH过程中的潜力，提供了更好的性能、选择性和稳定性。

        阳氧化物催化剂表面的羟基组分已被证明对于提高稳定性、减少焦炭形成以及提高PDH过程的效率和催化剂寿命至关重要。通过控制钒离子的价态和羟基的存在，可以在抑制失活的同时保持活性和稳定性之间达到平衡。

        此外，用于氧化丙烷脱氢的具有明确支持的阳氧化物催化剂显示了与传统过程相比，降低能源消耗和环境影响的潜力。这些催化剂不仅提高了稳定性和可回收性，还为以最小化环境足迹的方式生产丙烯提供了有希望的途径。
