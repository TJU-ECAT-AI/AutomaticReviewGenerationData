<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document does not provide specific quotes addressing the exact question asked, focusing instead on a particular catalyst system (PtSn/Al2O3) for propane dehydrogenation. However, it suggests that innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to address challenges in PDH processes, such as overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability. These strategies might include modifying catalyst composition, structure, or operating conditions to optimize performance.
