In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly way to produce propylene from propane, particularly focusing on enhancing the catalytic performance at low temperatures. This is crucial since traditional processes, such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking, have limitations in terms of propylene yield and cost-effectiveness. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of non-precious metals like cobalt and tin (CoSn) in a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) matrix, are being developed to overcome issues like deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. These strategies aim to optimize the catalytic activity for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. Specifically, the CoSn/NC catalyst under microwave catalysis demonstrates outstanding activity with a high propane conversion and propylene selectivity up to 15% and 80%, respectively, even at 450°C. This is significantly higher than the performance of the same catalyst in conventional reaction mode, where the propane conversion and propylene selectivity were only 3.2% and 67.8%, respectively, at the same temperature. Moreover, the CoSn/NC catalyst maintains its activity over 180 minutes without visible change, and the apparent activation energy drops from 59.58 kJ/mol in conventional mode to 20.98 kJ/mol in microwave catalytic mode, suggesting a significant microwave catalytic effect. This novel approach represents a breakthrough in achieving highly effective direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene at low temperatures through microwave irradiation, offering a promising solution for the efficient utilization of abundant propane resources and the reduction of energy consumption in propylene production.

在工业对丙烯需求增加以及传统生产方法限制的背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供更高效、更环保的方式从丙烷生产丙烯来应对这些挑战，特别是在低温下提高催化性能。这至关重要，因为传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解过程在丙烯产量和成本效益方面存在局限性。正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略，如使用非贵金属如钴和锡（CoSn）在氮掺杂碳（NC）基质中的组合，旨在解决诸如失活、稳定性增强和可回收性改进等问题。这些策略针对氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程进行了优化。具体来说，CoSn/NC催化剂在微波催化作用下表现出卓越的活性，即使在450°C时也能实现高达15%的丙烷转化率和80%的丙烯选择性。相比之下，在常规反应模式下，相同催化剂在相同温度下的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性仅为3.2%和67.8%，分别。此外，CoSn/NC催化剂在经过180分钟测试后仍保持其活性，而无需明显的可见变化，并且在微波催化模式下的表观活化能从常规模式下的59.58 kJ/mol降低到20.98 kJ/mol，表明存在显著的微波催化效应。这一新颖的方法代表了通过微波辐射在低温下高效直接脱氢丙烷到丙烯的突破，为充分利用丰富的丙烷资源并减少丙烯生产中能耗提供了有前景的解决方案。
