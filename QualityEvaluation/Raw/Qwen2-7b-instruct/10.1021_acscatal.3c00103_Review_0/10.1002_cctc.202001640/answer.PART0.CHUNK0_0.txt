In addressing the growing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques aim to efficiently convert propane into propylene. Challenges in this field include overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing catalyst stability, and improving recyclability. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of non-precious metals like cobalt and tin (CoSn), are being developed to overcome these challenges. The CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, for instance, demonstrates high activity and selectivity for direct propane dehydrogenation at low temperatures, thereby providing a new avenue for the efficient utilization of abundant propane resources.
