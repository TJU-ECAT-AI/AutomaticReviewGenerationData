[1] "Highly Effective Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene by Microwave Catalysis at Low Temperature over CoSn/NC Microwave Catalyst Graphical Abstract"
[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention."
[3] "However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge."
[4] "This work provides a novel approach for highly effective direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 by microwave irradiation at low temperature."
[5] "In recent years, the shale gas that is an abundant source of propane has emerged, making it very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals including C2 to C4 olefins."
[6] "Moreover, there is a large extent of the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes people pay attention to the process of direct dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene with high added value."
[7] "However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term."
[8] "Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM)."
[9] "Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."
[10] "Therefore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts is currently of major research interest."
[11] "These catalysts which have potential to be commercialized in the future have promising catalytic properties."
[12] "It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient."
[13] "Comparatively, the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity were respectively only 3.2% and 67.8% for CoSn/NC catalyst at 450C in the conventional reaction mode under identical conditions."
[14] "Furthermore, the microwave catalyst does not show visible change after tested for 180min."
[15] "This work provides a novel approach for highly effective direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 by microwave irradiation at low temperature."
[16] "The experimental results are consistent with the previously reported PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst and PtSn/MgAlO catalysts in direct PDH under conventional reaction mode."
[17] "Previously, our work of direct H2S decomposition reaction proved that the H2S equilibrium conversion can be broken under microwave irradiation."
[18] "The corresponding equilibrium C3H8 conversion in the conventional reaction mode is respectively 6.11% at 300C, 8.16% at 350C, 15.60% at 400C and 25.77% at 450C."
[19] "Unfortunately, microwave catalysis did not break the equilibrium conversion of the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction in our catalytic system."
[20] "For the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, the equilibrium temperature in the microwave catalytic reaction mode can reach 450C for about 400s at a microwave power of 100W."
[21] "Compared with the microwave heating behavior of Co/NC, although the microwave absorption performance of CoSn/NC is slightly weaker, it still has good microwave absorption ability."
[22] "For the catalytic activity tests in the microwave catalytic reaction mode, the specific reaction temperature of the catalyst bed can be achieved by adjusting the microwave input power."
[23] "For the XRD pattern of fresh Co/NC catalyst, it only shows characteristic diffraction peaks of carbon materials at 2θ value of 27 and 44, which is assigned to (002) and (100) of the N-doped carbon lattice plane."
[24] "For the fresh CoSn/NC, diffraction peaks centered at 2θ= 30.7, 32.1, 43.9, 44.9, 55.3, 62.5, 63.8, 64.7, 72.4, 73.2, 79.5 and 89.4 indicative of tetragonal structured tin (a=b=5.831Å, c=3.182Å), which is consistent with reported values."
[25] "Moreover, the EDX spectrum (Figure5d) of the fresh CoSn/NC microwave catalyst proves the existence of Co species, despite no diffraction peaks of Co species in XRD pattern."
[26] "The sharp absorption peak at 1395cm1 is attributed to the functional groups of CN bond,34 while the absorption bands at 1413cm1 are related to the existence of NC=O bond."
[27] "Furthermore, the fresh and used CoSn/NC samples were studied by Raman spectroscopy (Figure7b)."
[28] "However, the intensity ratio between D band (1360cm1) and G band (1589cm1) of the used CoSn/NC sample increase to 2.65."
[29] "This result is consistent with XRD pattern."
[30] "These results may account for the accumulation of carbon during the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction, which reduces the graphitization degree of the catalyst."
[31] "Taking into account that the side reactions are mainly catalyzed by strong acid centers,42 it can also be said that the undesirable side reactions do not easily occur over the CoSn/NC catalyst."
[32] "Moreover, the content of these components in the fresh and used CoSn/NC microwave catalyst are calculated by XPS characterization results (Table3)."
[33] "In contrast to the fresh CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, the content of active phase Co2+ in the used CoSn/NC microwave catalyst is around 89.04%, which has slightly decreased."
[34] "Furthermore, the structure of the spent microwave catalyst does not differ significantly after the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction under microwave irradiation."
[35] "These phenomena are extremely interesting, but what causes these phenomena?"
[36] "Previously, our work of direct NO decomposition reaction and direct decomposition of H2S by microwave catalysis both confirmed that the dramatic accelerations under microwave irradiation was not simply ascribed to the hot-spots hypothesis."
[37] "Microwave (MW) heating has been applied to increase the selectivity to propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
[38] "However, the more limited performance is delivered by the same catalytic system when it is subjected to conventional heating in a fixed-bed reactor configuration."
[39] "The direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst in the MCRM can work effectively at such a low reaction temperature because of the low activation energy."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering alternative routes for the production of propylene from abundant propane sources, with a focus on enhancing catalytic performance at lower temperatures. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, improve stability, and enhance recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, particularly focusing on developing cost-effective, non-precious metal catalysts that can operate efficiently at low temperatures.

2. In the context of PDH, the development of catalysts with improved stability and recyclability is crucial. Traditional catalysts often suffer from deactivation due to coking and cracking over time, which limits their efficiency and economic viability. By designing catalysts that can withstand prolonged use without significant loss of activity, industries can reduce costs and enhance the sustainability of PDH processes. Additionally, the use of non-precious metals, which are more abundant and less expensive than precious metals like platinum, helps in reducing the overall cost of production while maintaining high catalytic performance.

3. Innovative catalyst design strategies involve the creation of catalyst supports with enhanced properties that facilitate better adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the PDH reaction. For instance, the incorporation of metal promoters like tin (Sn) in the catalyst formulation can enhance the selectivity and stability of the catalyst, allowing for more efficient conversion of propane to propylene at lower temperatures. The use of microwave catalysis, as demonstrated in this study, can further reduce the energy consumption required for PDH reactions, making the process more environmentally friendly and economically viable.

4. The study highlights the development of CoSn/NC microwave catalysts, which exhibit high activity and selectivity in the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene at low temperatures. This approach not only addresses the issue of high temperature requirements for PDH processes but also reduces the energy consumption associated with conventional catalytic reactions. The catalysts are designed to absorb microwaves effectively, leading to localized heating and acceleration of the reaction kinetics, which contributes to the improved catalytic performance.

5. The design strategies for these catalysts involve selecting materials with suitable properties for microwave absorption, ensuring good thermal stability, and optimizing the dispersion of active metal sites. The use of nanocarbons as catalyst supports benefits from their high surface area, tunable functional groups, and large porosity, which contribute to enhanced catalytic activity and stability. The addition of tin as a promoter enhances the catalytic properties by facilitating the transfer of carbon deposits from the metal sites to the carrier, thus improving the stability of the catalyst.

6. The study also emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of the active phase in the catalyst, which is critical for optimizing the catalytic performance. The active sites in CoSn/NC catalysts are likely to be Co2+ ions, which are responsible for the dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of tin (Sn) into the catalyst formulation helps in neutralizing the strong acid sites, reducing the occurrence of undesirable side reactions and enhancing the selectivity towards propylene production.

7. The development of a novel microwave catalytic reaction mode, which utilizes microwave irradiation to accelerate the PDH process, represents a significant advancement in PDH technology. This approach not only reduces the reaction temperature required for achieving high conversion and selectivity but also minimizes energy consumption, making the process more sustainable and efficient. The ability of microwave catalysis to selectively heat the solid phase while keeping the gas phase at a lower temperature helps in minimizing unwanted by-products, thereby improving the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

8. The research findings suggest that the combination of optimized catalyst design, such as incorporating metal promoters and utilizing nanocarbons as supports, along with the innovative microwave catalytic reaction mode, can lead to the development of highly effective and stable PDH catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures and with reduced energy consumption. This not only addresses the current challenges in PDH technology but also paves the way for more sustainable and economically viable methods of propylene production from propane.
