1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering alternative routes for the production of propylene from abundant propane sources, with a focus on enhancing catalytic performance at lower temperatures. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, improve stability, and enhance recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, particularly focusing on developing cost-effective, non-precious metal catalysts that can operate efficiently at low temperatures.

2. In the context of PDH, the development of catalysts with improved stability and recyclability is crucial. Traditional catalysts often suffer from deactivation due to coking and cracking over time, which limits their efficiency and economic viability. By designing catalysts that can withstand prolonged use without significant loss of activity, industries can reduce costs and enhance the sustainability of PDH processes. Additionally, the use of non-precious metals, which are more abundant and less expensive than precious metals like platinum, helps in reducing the overall cost of production while maintaining high catalytic performance.

3. Innovative catalyst design strategies involve the creation of catalyst supports with enhanced properties that facilitate better adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the PDH reaction. For instance, the incorporation of metal promoters like tin (Sn) in the catalyst formulation can enhance the selectivity and stability of the catalyst, allowing for more efficient conversion of propane to propylene at lower temperatures. The use of microwave catalysis, as demonstrated in this study, can further reduce the energy consumption required for PDH reactions, making the process more environmentally friendly and economically viable.

4. The study highlights the development of CoSn/NC microwave catalysts, which exhibit high activity and selectivity in the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene at low temperatures. This approach not only addresses the issue of high temperature requirements for PDH processes but also reduces the energy consumption associated with conventional catalytic reactions. The catalysts are designed to absorb microwaves effectively, leading to localized heating and acceleration of the reaction kinetics, which contributes to the improved catalytic performance.

5. The design strategies for these catalysts involve selecting materials with suitable properties for microwave absorption, ensuring good thermal stability, and optimizing the dispersion of active metal sites. The use of nanocarbons as catalyst supports benefits from their high surface area, tunable functional groups, and large porosity, which contribute to enhanced catalytic activity and stability. The addition of tin as a promoter enhances the catalytic properties by facilitating the transfer of carbon deposits from the metal sites to the carrier, thus improving the stability of the catalyst.

6. The study also emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of the active phase in the catalyst, which is critical for optimizing the catalytic performance. The active sites in CoSn/NC catalysts are likely to be Co2+ ions, which are responsible for the dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of tin (Sn) into the catalyst formulation helps in neutralizing the strong acid sites, reducing the occurrence of undesirable side reactions and enhancing the selectivity towards propylene production.

7. The development of a novel microwave catalytic reaction mode, which utilizes microwave irradiation to accelerate the PDH process, represents a significant advancement in PDH technology. This approach not only reduces the reaction temperature required for achieving high conversion and selectivity but also minimizes energy consumption, making the process more sustainable and efficient. The ability of microwave catalysis to selectively heat the solid phase while keeping the gas phase at a lower temperature helps in minimizing unwanted by-products, thereby improving the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

8. The research findings suggest that the combination of optimized catalyst design, such as incorporating metal promoters and utilizing nanocarbons as supports, along with the innovative microwave catalytic reaction mode, can lead to the development of highly effective and stable PDH catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures and with reduced energy consumption. This not only addresses the current challenges in PDH technology but also paves the way for more sustainable and economically viable methods of propylene production from propane.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and economically viable way to produce propylene. Traditional processes for producing propylene, such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking, often result in low yields and high costs, especially when considering the demand for downstream products like acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, and others. The direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene aims to bypass these limitations by providing a high-value utilization of abundant propane resources at lower temperatures, reducing energy consumption, and improving catalyst stability and recyclability.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies focus on developing non-precious metal catalysts that are more cost-effective, less prone to coking and cracking, and capable of maintaining high activity and selectivity under various conditions. The use of microwave catalysis represents a novel approach that significantly reduces the required reaction temperature, thereby decreasing energy consumption and improving the efficiency of the PDH process. This method exploits the unique properties of microwave irradiation to accelerate reactions and selectively heat the catalyst, leading to improved catalytic performance and stability.

Incorporating elements like cobalt (Co) and tin (Sn) into the catalyst design, as seen in the CoSn/NC catalyst, allows for the creation of materials that can effectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The addition of tin is particularly noteworthy as it can help in facilitating the transfer of carbon deposits from metal to the carrier, improving the catalyst's stability. Moreover, the use of carbon nitride as a support phase enables the catalyst to absorb microwaves efficiently, enhancing its catalytic activity under microwave irradiation.

The development of such catalysts, especially those optimized for microwave catalytic reaction modes, represents a significant advancement in PDH technology. These catalysts offer enhanced activity, stability, and lower operational costs compared to traditional catalysts, making them attractive solutions for the production of propylene. By employing these strategies, the industry can meet growing demand for propylene and its derivatives while minimizing environmental impact and optimizing resource utilization.

The results highlight that the CoSn/NC catalyst, when subjected to microwave catalysis, achieves a remarkable conversion of propane to propylene (15% conversion and 80% selectivity at 450°C), which is notably higher than that obtained under conventional reaction modes (3.2% conversion and 67.8% selectivity at 450°C). Additionally, the apparent activation energy of the CoSn/NC catalyst drops significantly (from 59.58 kJ/mol in conventional reaction mode to 20.98 kJ/mol in microwave catalytic reaction mode), indicating the presence of a microwave direct catalytic effect. This effect contributes to the enhanced efficiency of the dehydrogenation process, allowing for effective operation at lower temperatures, which is crucial for energy savings and environmental sustainability.
