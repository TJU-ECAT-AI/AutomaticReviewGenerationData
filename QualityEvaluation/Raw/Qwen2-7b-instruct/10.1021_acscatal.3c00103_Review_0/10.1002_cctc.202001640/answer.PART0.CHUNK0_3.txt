In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and economically viable way to produce propylene. Traditional processes for producing propylene, such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking, often result in low yields and high costs, especially when considering the demand for downstream products like acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, and others. The direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene aims to bypass these limitations by providing a high-value utilization of abundant propane resources at lower temperatures, reducing energy consumption, and improving catalyst stability and recyclability.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies focus on developing non-precious metal catalysts that are more cost-effective, less prone to coking and cracking, and capable of maintaining high activity and selectivity under various conditions. The use of microwave catalysis represents a novel approach that significantly reduces the required reaction temperature, thereby decreasing energy consumption and improving the efficiency of the PDH process. This method exploits the unique properties of microwave irradiation to accelerate reactions and selectively heat the catalyst, leading to improved catalytic performance and stability.

Incorporating elements like cobalt (Co) and tin (Sn) into the catalyst design, as seen in the CoSn/NC catalyst, allows for the creation of materials that can effectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The addition of tin is particularly noteworthy as it can help in facilitating the transfer of carbon deposits from metal to the carrier, improving the catalyst's stability. Moreover, the use of carbon nitride as a support phase enables the catalyst to absorb microwaves efficiently, enhancing its catalytic activity under microwave irradiation.

The development of such catalysts, especially those optimized for microwave catalytic reaction modes, represents a significant advancement in PDH technology. These catalysts offer enhanced activity, stability, and lower operational costs compared to traditional catalysts, making them attractive solutions for the production of propylene. By employing these strategies, the industry can meet growing demand for propylene and its derivatives while minimizing environmental impact and optimizing resource utilization.

The results highlight that the CoSn/NC catalyst, when subjected to microwave catalysis, achieves a remarkable conversion of propane to propylene (15% conversion and 80% selectivity at 450°C), which is notably higher than that obtained under conventional reaction modes (3.2% conversion and 67.8% selectivity at 450°C). Additionally, the apparent activation energy of the CoSn/NC catalyst drops significantly (from 59.58 kJ/mol in conventional reaction mode to 20.98 kJ/mol in microwave catalytic reaction mode), indicating the presence of a microwave direct catalytic effect. This effect contributes to the enhanced efficiency of the dehydrogenation process, allowing for effective operation at lower temperatures, which is crucial for energy savings and environmental sustainability.

在丙烷需求增长和传统生产方法限制的大背景下，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供更高效、环境友好且经济可行的方法来生产丙烯，从而解决了这些挑战。传统的丙烯生产过程，如蒸汽裂解和催化裂解，往往导致产量低和成本高，尤其是考虑到下游产品如丙烯腈、丙烯酸、丙二醇等的需求。直接丙烷脱氢到丙烯的目标在于通过利用丰富且低成本的丙烷资源，降低反应温度，减少能源消耗，并提高催化剂的稳定性和可循环使用性，以克服传统方法中的局限性。

为了克服催化剂失效问题并增强稳定性，创新的催化剂设计策略集中在开发成本更低、不易结焦和开裂、能够在各种条件下保持高活性和选择性的非贵金属催化剂。微波催化方法代表了一种新颖的方法，它显著降低了所需反应温度，从而减少了能源消耗并提高了PDH过程的效率。这种方法利用微波辐射的独特性质加速反应并选择性加热催化剂，从而提高催化性能和稳定性。

在催化剂设计中引入钴（Co）和锡（Sn）元素，尤其是在CoSn/NC催化剂中，允许创造能够有效催化丙烷脱氢到丙烯的材料。锡的加入特别值得注意，因为它可以帮助碳沉积从金属转移到载体上，从而改善催化剂的稳定性。此外，将碳氮化物用作支持相使催化剂能够有效地吸收微波，从而在微波照射下增强其催化活性。

开发这样的催化剂，特别是那些优化用于微波催化反应模式的催化剂，代表了PDH技术的重大进步。这些催化剂与传统催化剂相比提供了更高的活性、稳定性和较低的操作成本，使其成为生产丙烯及其衍生物的有吸引力的解决方案。通过采用这些策略，行业可以满足对丙烯日益增长的需求，同时最小化环境影响并优化资源利用。

结果表明，当CoSn/NC催化剂在微波催化下使用时，实现了令人瞩目的丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率（450°C时为15%，丙烯选择性为80%），这明显高于在常规反应模式下获得的结果（450°C时为3.2%，丙烯选择性为67.8%）。此外，CoSn/NC催化剂的显着活化能降低（从常规反应模式下的59.58 kJ/mol降至微波催化反应模式下的20.98 kJ/mol），表明存在微波直接催化效应。这种效应有助于提高脱氢过程的效率，允许在较低温度下有效运行，这对于节能和环境保护至关重要。
