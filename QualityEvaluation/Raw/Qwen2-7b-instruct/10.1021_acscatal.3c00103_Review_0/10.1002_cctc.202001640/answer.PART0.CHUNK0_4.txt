In response to the increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are being developed to address these challenges. Specifically, the literature highlights the innovative catalyst design strategies aimed at overcoming deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The document specifically mentions the use of microwave catalysis as a novel approach to achieve high-efficiency PDH at low temperatures. The CoSn/NC catalyst, in particular, is noted for its outstanding activity with a high C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity of up to 15% and 80%, respectively, even at 450°C. This represents a significant advancement in the field, offering a new pathway for the high-value utilization of abundant propane resources at low temperatures.
