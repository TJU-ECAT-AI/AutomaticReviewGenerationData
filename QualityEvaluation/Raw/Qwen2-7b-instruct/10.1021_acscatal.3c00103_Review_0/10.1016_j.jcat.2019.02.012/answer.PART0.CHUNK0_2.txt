1. The global annual propene market is projected to grow significantly from 103 million tons in 2012 to 165 million tons by 2030.
2. Propene is extensively utilized in the production of numerous everyday chemicals.
3. Propene is formed from propane and then undergoes sequential conversions.
4. The selectivity of propene from propane conversion on m-ZrO2 reduces from 90% to 83% as the conversion increases from 9% to 33%.
5. Regardless of the catalyst tested, the activation energy for propene formation remained consistently at about 150 kJ·mol1.
6. Under different oxygen partial pressures, the conductivity values for t-ZrO2 samples remained remarkably similar, indicating that ionic conductivity is predominant.
7. Both m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 exhibit an increase in the rate of propane conversion with a decrease in crystallite size.
8. The higher the size of t-ZrO2 crystallites, the greater the proportion of polyaromatic graphitic species is formed.
