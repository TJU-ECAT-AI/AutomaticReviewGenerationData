<p>Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life [1] ,[2] . Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene. The global annual propene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 compared to 103 million in 2012 [3] ,[4] . Nowadays, propene is mainly produced through steam (6065%) or fluid catalytic cracking (30%) of various oil fractions [5] ,[6] . However, these two processes cannot fulfill the demands for propene. Therefore, some on-purpose technologies, such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes [7] , methanol to olefins or propene [8] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3] have been developed to close the gap between propene demand and production.</p>
<p>PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively [3] . Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks [3] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] . In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species [3] , while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. Apart from Pt-based or CrOx-based catalysts, there are some alternatives reported in literature. They include materials on the basis of ZnO [12] ,[13] ,[14] , GaOx [15] ,[16] , VOx [17] ,[18] ,[19] , isolated FeII [20] and CoII [21] . None of them has, however, been commercialized. This is due to the lower catalytic performance (activity, selectivity and durability) compared with commercial catalysts and insufficient understanding of structureactivity-selectivity relationship required for tailored catalyst design.</p>

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative and more efficient way to produce propylene, especially when conventional methods are insufficient. PDH allows for higher propylene selectivity compared to other processes, making it a key technology for closing the gap between propylene demand and production. However, the development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome issues like deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, whether they are oxidative or non-oxidative. This involves creating catalysts with better performance and tailored properties to match the specific needs of the PDH process.

针对工业对丙烯需求的增长以及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种更高效的方法来生产丙烯，特别是在传统方法不足时。PDH能够提供更高的丙烯选择性，有助于缩小丙烯需求与生产之间的差距。然而，开发创新的催化剂设计策略对于克服PDH过程中的失活、提高稳定性并改善可回收性至关重要，无论是氧化PDH还是非氧化PDH。这涉及到创建性能更好且具有针对性特性的催化剂，以满足PDH过程的具体需求。
