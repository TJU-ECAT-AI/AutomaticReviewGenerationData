<p>Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life [1] ,[2] . Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene. The global annual propene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 compared to 103 million in 2012 [3] ,[4] . Nowadays, propene is mainly produced through steam (6065%) or fluid catalytic cracking (30%) of various oil fractions [5] ,[6] . However, these two processes cannot fulfill the demands for propene. Therefore, some on-purpose technologies, such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes [7] , methanol to olefins or propene [8] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3] have been developed to close the gap between propene demand and production.</p>
<p>PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively [3] . Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks [3] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] . In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species [3] , while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. Apart from Pt-based or CrOx-based catalysts, there are some alternatives reported in literature. They include materials on the basis of ZnO [12] ,[13] ,[14] , GaOx [15] ,[16] , VOx [17] ,[18] ,[19] , isolated FeII [20] and CoII [21] . None of them has, however, been commercialized. This is due to the lower catalytic performance (activity, selectivity and durability) compared with commercial catalysts and insufficient understanding of structureactivity-selectivity relationship required for tailored catalyst design.</p>
<p>Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes [22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] . Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh.</p>
<p>This work aims to validate a new strategy for regulating the activity and especially selectivity of ZrO2 in PDH through phase composition and crystallite size. A principle goal was to identify the kind of active sites for the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene and for coke formation and the factors affecting their generation over tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2. To address these challenges, we followed a complementary approach combining controlled material synthesis with steady-state catalytic tests and catalyst characterization by XRD, BET, NH3-TPD, CO-TPR, electrical conductivity measurements and operando UVvis spectroscopy.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by developing on-purpose technologies such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes, methanol to olefins or propene, and PDH. These technologies aim to bridge the gap between propene demand and production by offering high propene selectivity.

2. Innovative catalyst design strategies involve developing environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2 that show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts utilize coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) as active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, which can be generated through doping with metal oxides, high-temperature reductive treatment, or loading of metal nanoparticles.
