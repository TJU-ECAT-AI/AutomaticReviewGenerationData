<p>The global annual propene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 compared to 103 million in 2012.</p>
<p>Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life.</p>
<p>The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively.</p>
<p>However, there are some on-purpose technologies, such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes, methanol to olefins or propene, and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).</p>
<p>PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity.</p>
<p>Propene is mainly produced through steam or fluid catalytic cracking of various oil fractions.</p>
<p>The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively.</p>
<p>Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks.</p>
<p>Our very recent study investigated the effect of crystallite size of bare monoclinic ZrO2 on the activity and propene selectivity in PDH.</p>
<p>Regardless of the phase composition, two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, i.e. coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) having, nevertheless, different chemical environment in tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, were concluded to be responsible for homolytic breaking of CH bonds in propane.</p>
<p>Monoclinic ZrO2 showed, however, higher rate of propene formation and higher propene selectivity than ZrO2 stabilized in the tetragonal phase.</p>
<p>The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on the PDH performance were related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create Zrcus sites.</p>
<p>The knowledge derived can be used for further optimizing PDH performance of ZrO2-based catalysts and also extended to other non-reducible metal oxides.</p>

The document highlights that the growing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods necessitate the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH allows for the direct production of propylene from propane, addressing the issue of limited supply and providing a more efficient method compared to conventional processes. Innovative catalyst designs, such as those based on ZrO2, are being developed to enhance activity, stability, and recyclability in PDH processes. The document also mentions the use of CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in traditional processes, which have drawbacks such as high cost and environmental concerns. The research focuses on tuning the activity and selectivity of ZrO2 catalysts through adjusting the crystallite size and phase composition to improve PDH performance. The findings suggest that monoclinic ZrO2 catalysts exhibit higher activity and selectivity compared to tetragonal ZrO2 catalysts, which is attributed to their enhanced ability to release lattice oxygen and generate active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. The document concludes that the obtained knowledge can be applied to optimize ZrO2-based catalysts for PDH and potentially extend to other non-reducible metal oxides.

文档指出，随着丙烯需求的增长以及传统生产方法的局限性，需要开发丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术以应对这些挑战。PDH可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而解决供应有限的问题，并提供比传统工艺更有效的方法。正在开发创新的催化剂设计，例如基于ZrO2的催化剂，以提高PDH过程的活性、稳定性和可回收性。文档还提到了在传统过程中使用CrOx/Al2O3和Pt/Al2O3催化剂，这些催化剂存在成本高和环境问题等缺点。研究关注通过调整结晶粒度和相组成来调节ZrO2催化剂的活性和选择性，以改善PDH性能。研究发现，单斜晶系ZrO2催化剂的活性和选择性高于四方晶系ZrO2催化剂，这归因于它们增强释放晶格氧的能力并生成脱氢反应的活性位点。文档得出结论，获得的知识可用于优化ZrO2基催化剂的PDH性能，并可能扩展到其他不可还原的金属氧化物。

<p>Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life [1] ,[2] . Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene. The global annual propene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 compared to 103 million in 2012 [3] ,[4] . Nowadays, propene is mainly produced through steam (6065%) or fluid catalytic cracking (30%) of various oil fractions [5] ,[6] . However, these two processes cannot fulfill the demands for propene. Therefore, some on-purpose technologies, such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes [7] , methanol to olefins or propene [8] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3] have been developed to close the gap between propene demand and production.</p>
<p>PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively [3] . Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks [3] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] . In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species [3] , while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. Apart from Pt-based or CrOx-based catalysts, there are some alternatives reported in literature. They include materials on the basis of ZnO [12] ,[13] ,[14] , GaOx [15] ,[16] , VOx [17] ,[18] ,[19] , isolated FeII [20] and CoII [21] . None of them has, however, been commercialized. This is due to the lower catalytic performance (activity, selectivity and durability) compared with commercial catalysts and insufficient understanding of structureactivity-selectivity relationship required for tailored catalyst design.</p>

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative and more efficient way to produce propylene, especially when conventional methods are insufficient. PDH allows for higher propylene selectivity compared to other processes, making it a key technology for closing the gap between propylene demand and production. However, the development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome issues like deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, whether they are oxidative or non-oxidative. This involves creating catalysts with better performance and tailored properties to match the specific needs of the PDH process.
