The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process addresses the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations in traditional production methods by offering a high propene selectivity. The main industrial processes, Catofin and Oleflex, utilize CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, which have drawbacks such as high cost, health risks, and limitations in activity and selectivity. Researchers have developed ZrO2-based catalysts as an alternative, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient compared to commercial CrOx and Pt catalysts. These ZrO2 catalysts demonstrate relevant activity and olefin selectivity in the dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. By adjusting the phase composition and crystallite size of ZrO2, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst can be optimized.

PDH过程通过提供高丙烯选择性来应对工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的挑战。主要的工业过程，Catofin和Oleflex，使用CrOx/Al2O3和Pt/Al2O3催化剂，这些催化剂存在成本高、健康风险以及活性和选择性有限的问题。研究人员开发了基于ZrO2的催化剂作为替代方案，与商业CrOx和Pt催化剂相比，它们更环保且成本效益更高。这些ZrO2催化剂在脱氢C3和C4烷烃时表现出相关的活性和烯烃选择性。通过调整ZrO2的相组成和晶粒尺寸，可以优化催化剂的活性和选择性。
