Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering an efficient alternative. These techniques focus on converting propane into propylene through catalytic processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. For instance, research has been conducted on Ga2O3-based catalysts to develop contrasting performance based on coordination environment and acidity of surface sites, which can lead to more effective PDH processes.
