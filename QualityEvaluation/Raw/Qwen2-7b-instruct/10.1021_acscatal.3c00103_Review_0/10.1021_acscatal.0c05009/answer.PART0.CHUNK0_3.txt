To address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and overcome limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques are crucial. These techniques convert propane into propylene, a valuable chemical intermediate used in various industries. Innovations in catalyst design aim to tackle issues such as deactivation, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability. For oxidative PDH processes, catalysts are engineered to withstand harsh conditions and maintain high activity over time. In nonoxidative PDH, the focus is on developing materials that can efficiently promote the reaction while minimizing side products. Strategies include modifying coordination environments and acidity of surface sites to optimize performance.
