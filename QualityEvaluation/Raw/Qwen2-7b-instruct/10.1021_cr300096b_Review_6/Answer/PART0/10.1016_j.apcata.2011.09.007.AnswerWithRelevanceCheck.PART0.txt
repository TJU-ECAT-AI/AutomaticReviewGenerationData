          Experimental techniques such as TEM, pulse CO chemisorption, XAS, FTIR, and HREELS were employed to characterize and analyze the structure and activity of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. TEM provided images of the catalyst particles with a resolution of 1.9 Å, using HAADF mode to visualize the contrast. XAS measurements were performed on Pt LIII-edge to detect the formation of Pt-3d-Pt bonds, with Pt foil spectra used for calibration. FTIR spectroscopy was used to monitor the reaction progress and identify the presence of reactants and products. HREELS likely refers to high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, which could be used to quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms such as Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers could be compared with DFT predictions to validate the theoretical models.

          The hydrogenation activity of the alumina-supported catalysts is similar based on catalyst mass and normalized by the number of active sites.

          铝氧化物支持催化剂的氢化活性基于催化剂质量相似，并且在活性位点归一化后。PtNi/α-Al2O3催化剂具有略大的颗粒和较低的CO吸附量，与PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂相比。PtNi/α-Al2O3催化剂表现出比PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂更广泛的双金属键形成绝对程度。两种钛酸盐支持催化剂之间显示出低表面面积和高表面面积之间的显著差异。两种催化剂的Pt负载通过近边区域的Pt L边缘的边缘跳跃高度估算，与催化剂样品中的Pt浓度相关。PtNi/LSA-ZrO2催化剂具有小颗粒（1nm）和更大颗粒（8至15nm）的双模态颗粒尺寸分布，而PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂具有大约1nm的窄颗粒尺寸分布。PtNi/LSA-ZrO2催化剂的CO吸附量低于PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂，归因于前者的较大颗粒。基于催化剂质量和每活性位点（因素10和20），PtNi/LSA-ZrO2催化剂显示出比PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂更高的氢化活性。两种钛酸盐支持催化剂之间归一化的氢化活性的显著差异表明，某些可还原氧化物支持所识别的SMSI效应可能在PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂的低活性中发挥作用。PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂氢化活性较低的另一个可能解释与PtNi键长的差异有关，后者比其他三种双金属催化剂短约0.05 Å（表2）。PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂的低PtPt配位数可能表明纳米颗粒中没有Pt核心，因此，两种催化剂的双金属特性可能不同，导致活性位点或不同活性的活性位点。

          本研究的要点在于探究氧化物支持和支撑面积对铂/镍双金属催化剂在低表面和高表面锆氧上的活性的影响。之前的研究结果表明，γ-Al2O3支持的铂/镍双金属催化剂的表征结果显示，双金属催化剂纳米颗粒具有铂位于最顶层表面的结构，与表面科学研究中识别的铂终止模型表面非常相似。在吸附原子氢的存在下，PtNiPt(1 1 1)表面是热力学稳定的，而在吸附氧的存在下，Ni迁移到表面形成NiPtPt(1 1 1)结构。这些铂/镍表面配置的热力学稳定性值得关注，因为计算和实验研究表明，吸附剂的存在下镍单层可以迁移。转换从铂-和镍-终止配置的活化壁垒相对较低，为15千卡/摩尔，表明该转换可以在合成和测试支持催化剂时的相关温度下发生。
