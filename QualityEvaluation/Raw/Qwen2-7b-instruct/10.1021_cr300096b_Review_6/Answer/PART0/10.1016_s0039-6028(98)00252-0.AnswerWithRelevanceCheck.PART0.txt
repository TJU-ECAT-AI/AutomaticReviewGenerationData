          Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces, accounting for approximately 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. The amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene varies significantly across the surfaces, with the highest concentration on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. The (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy demonstrates a high selectivity for other reaction products, which depend on the Sn concentration. The (2×2) surface alloy exhibits distinct high temperature desorption peaks at 370, 460, and 510 K, while the E3 alloy shows a single intense peak at 370 K. The E3 surface alloy's TPD spectra for methylacetylene is characterized by a dominant peak at 370 K. Increasing the concentration of Sn in the Pt(111) surface alters the H2 desorption temperature during TPD. After exposing the surfaces to methylacetylene, the H2 TPD spectra yield a monolayer coverage. Desorption peaks at 130 K indicate the cracking of the second, physisorbed layer of methylacetylene. Propylene (C3H6, with 42 amu) is the primary product, appearing in a broad feature from 270 to 350 K. Butane (C4H10) is also observed during TPD, with a peak at 165 K associated with a cracking fraction of butane. Benzene (78 amu) desorbs in a broad, reaction rate-limited peak at 550 K. The production of propylene on the three surfaces is quantified by comparing the TPD spectrum from a saturation dose of propylene adsorbed on Pt(111).

          甲基乙炔的氢化形成丙烯是所有三个表面最有利的反应途径，占吸附单层的大约20%。可逆吸附的甲基乙炔量在各个表面之间有很大差异，其中在(E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的浓度最高。在(2×2)-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金中，对于其他反应产物具有很高的选择性，这取决于Sn浓度。(2×2)表面合金在370、460和510 K处显示出三个高温度脱附峰，而E3合金仅在370 K处显示出一个强烈的高温度脱附峰。E3表面合金的甲基乙炔TD谱主要由370 K处的一个峰组成。增加在Pt(111)表面上的Sn浓度会改变脱氢期间的H2脱附温度。在暴露于甲基乙炔之后，H2 TD谱显示出在Pt(111)和Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的单层覆盖。130 K处的脱附峰表示第二物理吸附层的甲基乙炔的裂解。C3H6（42 amu）是主要产物，在270至350 K的范围内以宽范围出现。在TD过程中也观察到了丁烷（C4H10），其中165 K处的峰与丁烷的裂解分数有关。78 amu的苯在550 K处以广域、反应率限制的峰值脱附。通过比较在Pt(111)上吸附饱和剂量的丙烯的TD谱确定了三个表面上产生的丙烯的数量。

          [1] "The adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and the p(2×2) and (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys were investigated with temperature programmed desorption, Auger electron spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction."
          [2] "Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces accounting for ca 20% of the adsorbed monolayer."
          [3] "The alloy surfaces also greatly increase the amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene, from none on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy."
          [4] "Despite previous experiments showing cyclotrimerization of acetylene to form benzene on the PtSn surface alloys, the analogous reaction of methylacetylene on the alloy surfaces was not observed, that is,cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene."
          [5] "It is proposed that this and the high yield of propylene is due to facile dehydrogenation of methylacetylene because of the relatively weak HCH2CCH bond compared to acetylene."
          [6] "The desorption of several C4 hydrocarbon products at low (<170 K) temperature indicates that some minor pathway involving CC bond breaking is possible on these surfaces."

          The adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and the p(2×2) and (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys were studied using temperature programmed desorption, Auger electron spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction. Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most preferred reaction pathway on all three surfaces, accounting for about 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. The alloy surfaces significantly enhance the reversible adsorption of methylacetylene, ranging from zero on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Despite prior experiments demonstrating the cyclotrimerization of acetylene to form benzene on PtSn surface alloys, this analogous reaction of methylacetylene on the alloy surfaces was not observed, i.e., cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene. It is hypothesized that the ease of dehydrogenation of methylacetylene, due to its relatively weaker HCH2CCH bond compared to acetylene, contributes to the high yield of propylene. At low temperatures, the desorption of several C4 hydrocarbon products suggests that a minor pathway involving the breaking of CC bonds may occur on these surfaces.

          在Pt(111)和p(2×2)及(E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上进行了甲基乙炔的吸附和反应研究，使用了温度程序脱附、Auger电子光谱和低能电子衍射技术。甲基乙炔的氢化形成丙烯是所有三个表面最有利的反应途径，占吸附单层的大约20%。合金表面显著增加了可逆吸附的甲基乙炔量，从Pt(111)上的零增加到(E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上吸附层的60%。尽管先前的实验表明在PtSn表面合金上乙酸的环三聚化形成了苯，但在合金表面的甲基乙炔上观察不到类似的反应，即甲基乙炔的环三聚化形成三甲基苯。推测甲基乙炔相对较弱的HCH2CCH键与乙酸相比，使得其易于脱氢，从而导致了丙烯的高产率。在低温下，几种C4烃产物的脱附表明这些表面上可能存在涉及CC键断裂的次要途径。
