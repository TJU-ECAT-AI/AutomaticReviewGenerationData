The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst shows greater hydrogenation activity than the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst based on both per catalyst mass (factor of 10) and per active site (factor of 20). The significant difference in normalized hydrogenation activity between the two zirconia-supported catalysts suggests that the presence of the SMSI effects, identified for some reducible oxide supports, may play a role in the low activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst. Another possible explanation for the low hydrogenation activity of PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 is related to the difference in the PtNi bond length, which is about 0.05 Å shorter than that of the other three bimetallic catalysts. The low PtPt coordination number of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst may indicate that there is no Pt core in nanoparticles, leading to different bimetallic characters and active sites or sites of different activity in the two catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2011.09.007"},

The extent of PtNi bond formation shows a trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, closely aligned with the observed hydrogenation activity. The Pt/Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits notably higher hydrogenation activity than its counterparts on γ-Al2O3 or TiO2 supports. The correlation between the hydrogenation activity and the PtNi coordination number derived from EXAFS analysis suggests that the formation degree of PtNi bimetallic bonds contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2010.11.023"},
