          [8] "In this case, the activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) is calculated. The activity for cyclohexane formation is determined in exactly the same way, but using cyclohexane peak area ratios."
          [9] "Furthermore, a volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."
          [10] "The Cu/Pt(111) surfaces did not follow the trends of the other 3d/Pt(111) surfaces in either the DFT modeling or TPD experiments, which can be partially explained by activation of H2 dissociation on the Cu surfaces."

<p>The as-prepared PtNi/HOPG samples were mildly reduced (20% H2 with Ar balance, 200 8C, 2 h) to decompose the precursor salts and remove any adsorbates from the catalysts.</p>
          <p>XPS measurement shows that both Pt and Ni have been completely reduced and no more Cl and N signals were detected.</p>
          <p>The Pt 4f peak area increases but the Ni 2p signal is significantly weakened when the oxidized catalyst has been reduced.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, structural information of the supported PtNi particles was given through TEM investigations.</p>
          <p>The (1 1 1) atomic planes of the PtNi alloy lattice with a d-spacing of 0.216 nm can be clearly distinguished.</p>
          <p>Moreover, XPS experiments show that Ni stays at oxidized state after reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200 8C for 2 h but Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample has been fully reduced under the same treatment conditions.</p>
          <p>Based on the above results and discussions, we suggest that the observed changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles should be attributed to certain surface processes at the bimetallic particles.</p>
