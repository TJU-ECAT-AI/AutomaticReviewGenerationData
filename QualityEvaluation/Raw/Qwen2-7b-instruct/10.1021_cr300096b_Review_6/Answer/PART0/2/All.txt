The zirconia-supported catalysts show significant differences between the low and high surface area supports. The Pt loadings in the two catalysts are estimated using the height of the edge-jump in the near edge region of the Pt L-edge, related to the concentration of Pt in the catalyst samples. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a bimodal particle size distribution with small particles of 1 nm and larger ones between 8 and 15 nm, while the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a narrow particle size distribution on the order of 1 nm. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a lower CO uptake than the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst, attributed to larger particles in the former. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst shows greater hydrogenation activity than the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst based on both per catalyst mass (factor of 10) and per active site (factor of 20). The significant difference in normalized hydrogenation activity between the two zirconia-supported catalysts suggests that the presence of the SMSI effects, identified for some reducible oxide supports, may play a role in the low activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst. Another possible explanation for the low hydrogenation activity of PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 is related to the difference in the PtNi bond length, which is about 0.05 Å shorter than that of the other three bimetallic catalysts.

Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most preferred reaction pathway on all three surfaces, accounting for about 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. The alloy surfaces significantly enhance the reversible adsorption of methylacetylene, ranging from zero on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Despite prior experiments demonstrating the cyclotrimerization of acetylene to form benzene on PtSn surface alloys, this analogous reaction of methylacetylene on the alloy surfaces was not observed, i.e., cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene. It is hypothesized that the ease of dehydrogenation of methylacetylene, due to its relatively weaker HCH2CCH bond compared to acetylene, contributes to the high yield of propylene. At low temperatures, the desorption of several C4 hydrocarbon products suggests that a minor pathway involving the breaking of CC bonds may occur on these surfaces.", "Chinese": "在Pt(111)和p(2×2)及(E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上进行了甲基乙炔的吸附和反应研究，使用了温度程序脱附、Auger电子光谱和低能电子衍射技术。甲基乙炔的氢化形成丙烯是所有三个表面最有利的反应途径，占吸附单层的大约20%。合金表面显著增加了可逆吸附的甲基乙炔量，从Pt(111)上的零增加到(E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上吸附层的60%。尽管先前的实验表明在PtSn表面合金上乙酸的环三聚化形成了苯，但在合金表面的甲基乙炔上观察不到类似的反应，即甲基乙炔的环三聚化形成三甲基苯。推测甲基乙炔相对较弱的HCH2CCH键与乙酸相比，使得其易于脱氢，从而导致了丙烯的高产率。在低温下，几种C4烃产物的脱附表明这些表面上可能存在涉及CC键断裂的次要途径。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0039-6028(98)00252-0"},
