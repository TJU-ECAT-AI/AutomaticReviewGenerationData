Bimetallic catalysts, including those supported on SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and TiO2, are widely applied in reactions like hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming due to their distinct properties from monometallic catalysts. The extent of PtNi bond formation shows a trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, closely aligned with the observed hydrogenation activity. The Pt/Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits notably higher hydrogenation activity than its counterparts on γ-Al2O3 or TiO2 supports. The correlation between the hydrogenation activity and the PtNi coordination number derived from EXAFS analysis suggests that the formation degree of PtNi bimetallic bonds contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity.

The experimental techniques utilized to investigate the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are HREELS and AES. These methods allow for the verification and quantification of the segregation process. The measured kinetics and activation barriers obtained from the experiments are then compared with predictions made through Density Functional Theory (DFT).

The hydrogenation activity of the alumina-supported catalysts is similar based on catalyst mass and normalized by the number of active sites. The PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst has slightly larger particles and lower CO uptake compared to the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a greater absolute extent of bimetallic bond formation than the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The zirconia-supported catalysts show significant differences between the low and high surface area supports. The Pt loadings in the two catalysts are estimated using the height of the edge-jump in the near edge region of the Pt L-edge, related to the concentration of Pt in the catalyst samples. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a bimodal particle size distribution with small particles of 1 nm and larger ones between 8 and 15 nm, while the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a narrow particle size distribution on the order of 1 nm. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a lower CO uptake than the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst, attributed to larger particles in the former. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst shows greater hydrogenation activity than the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst based on both per catalyst mass (factor of 10) and per active site (factor of 20). The significant difference in normalized hydrogenation activity between the two zirconia-supported catalysts suggests that the presence of the SMSI effects, identified for some reducible oxide supports, may play a role in the low activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst. Another possible explanation for the low hydrogenation activity of PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 is related to the difference in the PtNi bond length, which is about 0.05 Å shorter than that of the other three bimetallic catalysts. The low PtPt coordination number of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst may indicate that there is no Pt core in nanoparticles, leading to different bimetallic characters and active sites or sites of different activity in the two catalysts.

The experimental techniques used in the study to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems were high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These methods allowed for a quantitative analysis of the distribution of Ni and Co atoms both on the surface and within the subsurface area of the catalyst. The measured segregation kinetics matched well with the theoretical predictions derived from density functional theory (DFT).

The adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and the p(2×2) and (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys were studied using temperature programmed desorption, Auger electron spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction. Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most preferred reaction pathway on all three surfaces, accounting for about 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. The alloy surfaces significantly enhance the reversible adsorption of methylacetylene, ranging from zero on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Despite prior experiments demonstrating the cyclotrimerization of acetylene to form benzene on PtSn surface alloys, this analogous reaction of methylacetylene on the alloy surfaces was not observed, i.e., cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene. It is hypothesized that the ease of dehydrogenation of methylacetylene, due to its relatively weaker HCH2CCH bond compared to acetylene, contributes to the high yield of propylene. At low temperatures, the desorption of several C4 hydrocarbon products suggests that a minor pathway involving the breaking of CC bonds may occur on these surfaces.

AES technique was utilized to characterize the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES peak-to-peak ratio helped determine the quantity of 3d metal deposited, confirming the formation of a monolayer on Pt(111). AES measurements also quantified the deposition and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on Pt(111) surfaces. The surfaces were heated to high temperatures, and AES scans were conducted post-cooling to assess changes in the surface composition. The AES quantification of Fe and Cu deposition demonstrated a gradual diffusion into the subsurface region between 300 and 850 K, and a similar diffusion was observed for Cu at temperatures above 550 K. The AES technique, therefore, played a crucial role in verifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

The as-prepared PtNi/HOPG samples were mildly reduced (20% H2 with Ar balance, 200°C, 2 h) to decompose the precursor salts and eliminate any adsorbates from the catalysts. XPS measurement showed that both Pt and Ni were completely reduced, with no further Cl and N signals detected. When the oxidized catalyst was reduced, the Pt 4f peak area increased, but the Ni 2p signal was significantly weakened. TEM investigations provided structural information about the supported PtNi particles, revealing clear (1 1 1) atomic planes with a d-spacing of 0.216 nm in the PtNi alloy lattice. XPS experiments indicated that Ni remained in its oxidized state after reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200°C for 2 h, whereas Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample had been fully reduced under the same treatment conditions. Based on these results and discussions, the changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles were attributed to specific surface processes occurring at the bimetallic particles.

TEM investigations provided structural information about the supported PtNi particles, revealing clear (1 1 1) atomic planes with a d-spacing of 0.216 nm in the PtNi alloy lattice. XPS experiments indicated that Ni remained in its oxidized state after reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200°C for 2 h, whereas Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample had been fully reduced under the same treatment conditions. Based on these results and discussions, the changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles were attributed to specific surface processes occurring at the bimetallic particles.

Bimetallic catalysts, including those supported on SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and TiO2, are widely applied in reactions like hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming due to their distinct properties from monometallic catalysts. The extent of PtNi bond formation shows a trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, closely aligned with the observed hydrogenation activity. The Pt/Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits notably higher hydrogenation activity than its counterparts on γ-Al2O3 or TiO2 supports. The correlation between the hydrogenation activity and the PtNi coordination number derived from EXAFS analysis suggests that the formation degree of PtNi bimetallic bonds contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity.

The experimental techniques utilized to investigate the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are HREELS and AES. These methods allow for the verification and quantification of the segregation process. The measured kinetics and activation barriers obtained from the experiments are then compared with predictions made through Density Functional Theory (DFT).

The hydrogenation activity of the alumina-supported catalysts is similar based on catalyst mass and normalized by the number of active sites. The PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst has slightly larger particles and lower CO uptake compared to the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a greater absolute extent of bimetallic bond formation than the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The zirconia-supported catalysts show significant differences between the low and high surface area supports. The Pt loadings in the two catalysts are estimated using the height of the edge-jump in the near edge region of the Pt L-edge, related to the concentration of Pt in the catalyst samples. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a bimodal particle size distribution with small particles of 1 nm and larger ones between 8 and 15 nm, while the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a narrow particle size distribution on the order of 1 nm. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a lower CO uptake than the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst, attributed to larger particles in the former. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst shows greater hydrogenation activity than the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst based on both per catalyst mass (factor of 10) and per active site (factor of 20). The significant difference in normalized hydrogenation activity between the two zirconia-supported catalysts suggests that the presence of the SMSI effects, identified for some reducible oxide supports, may play a role in the low activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst. Another possible explanation for the low hydrogenation activity of PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 is related to the difference in the PtNi bond length, which is about 0.05 Å shorter than that of the other three bimetallic catalysts. The low PtPt coordination number of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst may indicate that there is no Pt core in nanoparticles, leading to different bimetallic characters and active sites or sites of different activity in the two catalysts.

The experimental techniques used in the study to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems were high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These methods allowed for a quantitative analysis of the distribution of Ni and Co atoms both on the surface and within the subsurface area of the catalyst. The measured segregation kinetics matched well with the theoretical predictions derived from density functional theory (DFT).

The adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and the p(2×2) and (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys were studied using temperature programmed desorption, Auger electron spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction. Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most preferred reaction pathway on all three surfaces, accounting for about 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. The alloy surfaces significantly enhance the reversible adsorption of methylacetylene, ranging from zero on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Despite prior experiments demonstrating the cyclotrimerization of acetylene to form benzene on PtSn surface alloys, this analogous reaction of methylacetylene on the alloy surfaces was not observed, i.e., cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene. It is hypothesized that the ease of dehydrogenation of methylacetylene, due to its relatively weaker HCH2CCH bond compared to acetylene, contributes to the high yield of propylene. At low temperatures, the desorption of several C4 hydrocarbon products suggests that a minor pathway involving the breaking of CC bonds may occur on these surfaces.

AES technique was utilized to characterize the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES peak-to-peak ratio helped determine the quantity of 3d metal deposited, confirming the formation of a monolayer on Pt(111). AES measurements also quantified the deposition and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on Pt(111) surfaces. The surfaces were heated to high temperatures, and AES scans were conducted post-cooling to assess changes in the surface composition. The AES quantification of Fe and Cu deposition demonstrated a gradual diffusion into the subsurface region between 300 and 850 K, and a similar diffusion was observed for Cu at temperatures above 550 K. The AES technique, therefore, played a crucial role in verifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

The as-prepared PtNi/HOPG samples were mildly reduced (20% H2 with Ar balance, 200°C, 2 h) to decompose the precursor salts and eliminate any adsorbates from the catalysts. XPS measurement showed that both Pt and Ni were completely reduced, with no further Cl and N signals detected. When the oxidized catalyst was reduced, the Pt 4f peak area increased, but the Ni 2p signal was significantly weakened. TEM investigations provided structural information about the supported PtNi particles, revealing clear (1 1 1) atomic planes with a d-spacing of 0.216 nm in the PtNi alloy lattice. XPS experiments indicated that Ni remained in its oxidized state after reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200°C for 2 h, whereas Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample had been fully reduced under the same treatment conditions. Based on these results and discussions, the changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles were attributed to specific surface processes occurring at the bimetallic particles.
