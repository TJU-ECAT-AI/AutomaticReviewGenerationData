Experimental techniques like HREELS and AES were used to study the interaction of sulfur with Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) surfaces, providing quantitative information on the surface composition and structure. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems were found to align well with DFT predictions, showing a good agreement between experimental data and theoretical calculations.

After normalizing with the CO uptake, the activity trend is: PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 < PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 < PtNi/γ-Al2O3 < PtNi/α-Al2O3. The PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst shows slightly larger particles and lower CO uptake compared to the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst exhibits a bimodal particle size distribution, featuring both small particles of 1 nm and larger ones between 8 and 15 nm. The Pt loadings in the two catalysts are estimated using the height of the edge-jump in the near edge region of the Pt L-edge, related to the concentration of Pt in the catalyst samples. Although the amorphous to tetragonal phase transformation of the HSA-ZrO2 support, accompanied with a decrease in support surface area, may trap some of the metal nanoparticles within the ZrO2 pores, this is unlikely the reason for the lower activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst.
