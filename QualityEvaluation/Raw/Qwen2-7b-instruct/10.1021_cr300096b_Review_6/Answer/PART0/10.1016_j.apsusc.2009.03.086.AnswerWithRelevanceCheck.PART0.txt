          <p>Reversible structural changes in PtNi nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results in the formation of Pt-skin structures. The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors have been found in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported HOPG.</p>

          Experimental techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were employed to observe and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. When the bimetallic catalysts were annealed in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres, Ni became oxidized and formed NiO, which encapsulated the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions, both Pt and Ni remained in their metallic states. Pt segregated onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffused to the subsurface region, leading to the formation of Pt-skin structures. These reversible mass transport processes, responding to the changes between O2 and H2 atmospheres, contributed to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at the PtNi nanoparticle systems.

          使用了X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和高分辨率透射电子显微镜（HRTEM）等实验技术来观察并量化在交替H2和O2气氛下Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中3d原子，特别是Ni和Co的表面扩散行为。当双金属催化剂在H2和O2交替气氛下进行热处理时，Ni被氧化形成NiO，该层包裹了双金属颗粒。在还原条件下，Pt和Ni保持在金属状态。Pt向颗粒表面扩散，而Ni则向亚表面区域扩散，形成了Pt-皮层结构。这些可逆的质量传输过程，响应于氧气和氢气气氛的变化，导致了PtNi纳米粒子体系表面结构和组成的振荡变化。

          <p>The as-prepared PtNi/HOPG samples were mildly reduced (20% H2 with Ar balance, 200 8C, 2 h) to decompose the precursor salts and remove any adsorbates from the catalysts.</p>
          <p>XPS measurement shows that both Pt and Ni have been completely reduced and no more Cl and N signals were detected.</p>
          <p>The Pt 4f peak area increases but the Ni 2p signal is significantly weakened when the oxidized catalyst has been reduced.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, structural information of the supported PtNi particles was given through TEM investigations.</p>
          <p>The (1 1 1) atomic planes of the PtNi alloy lattice with a d-spacing of 0.216 nm can be clearly distinguished.</p>
          <p>Moreover, XPS experiments show that Ni stays at oxidized state after reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200 8C for 2 h but Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample has been fully reduced under the same treatment conditions.</p>
          <p>Based on the above results and discussions, we suggest that the observed changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles should be attributed to certain surface processes at the bimetallic particles.</p>

          The as-prepared PtNi/HOPG samples were mildly reduced (20% H2 with Ar balance, 200°C, 2 h) to decompose the precursor salts and eliminate any adsorbates from the catalysts. XPS measurement showed that both Pt and Ni were completely reduced, with no further Cl and N signals detected. When the oxidized catalyst was reduced, the Pt 4f peak area increased, but the Ni 2p signal was significantly weakened. TEM investigations provided structural information about the supported PtNi particles, revealing clear (1 1 1) atomic planes with a d-spacing of 0.216 nm in the PtNi alloy lattice. XPS experiments indicated that Ni remained in its oxidized state after reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200°C for 2 h, whereas Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample had been fully reduced under the same treatment conditions. Based on these results and discussions, the changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles were attributed to specific surface processes occurring at the bimetallic particles.

          在200°C下进行2小时的轻微还原处理（20% H2与Ar平衡），以分解前体盐并去除催化剂上的吸附剂。XPS测量显示，Pt和Ni均被完全还原，未检测到Cl和N信号。在还原氧化催化剂后，Pt 4f峰面积增加，但Ni 2p信号显著减弱。通过TEM调查提供了关于支持的PtNi颗粒的结构信息，清晰地分辨出PtNi合金晶格的（1 1 1）原子平面，其d间距为0.216 nm。XPS实验表明，在200°C下使用H2对Ni/HOPG样本进行2小时还原处理后，Ni仍保持在氧化状态，而PtNi/HOPG样本中的Ni在相同的处理条件下已被完全还原。基于上述结果和讨论，PtNi颗粒在氧化和还原周期期间XPS Pt和Ni信号的变化应归因于在双金属颗粒表面发生的特定表面过程。
