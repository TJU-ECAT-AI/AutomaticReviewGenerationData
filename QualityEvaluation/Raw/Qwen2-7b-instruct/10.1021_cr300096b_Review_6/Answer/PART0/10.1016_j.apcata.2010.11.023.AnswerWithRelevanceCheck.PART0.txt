          "The supported catalysts were characterized using TEM and EXAFS in order to understand the origins responsible for the difference in hydrogenation activity."
          "Experimental techniques such as TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems."
          "The hydrogenation activity of the supported catalysts followed a trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. This observation was consistent with the coordination numbers of the PtNi bimetallic bonds in the three catalysts, indicating that the extent of PtNi bond formation influenced the catalytic performance."

          Experimental techniques such as TEM and EXAFS were employed to characterize and understand the differences in hydrogenation activity among supported catalysts, as well as to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (like Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The hydrogenation activity showed a trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, which correlates with the coordination numbers of the PtNi bonds in the catalysts, suggesting that the extent of PtNi bond formation affects the catalytic performance.

          使用TEM和EXAFS等实验技术对支持催化剂进行了表征，以了解氢化活性差异的原因，并验证和量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）的表面分层。氢化活性显示出SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2的趋势，这与三种催化剂中的PtNi键的配位数一致，表明PtNi键形成程度影响了催化性能。

          "The production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons has attracted a great deal of attention due to their merits such as renewable, potentially sustainable and environmentally benign."
          "Bimetallic catalysts have been utilized in many reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming due to their unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
          "The extent of PtNi bond formation followed the trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, which correlated very well with the hydrogenation activity."
          "The Pt/Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows much higher hydrogenation activity than either the γ-Al2O3 or TiO2 supported catalysts."
          "The activity trend can be correlated with the PtNi coordination number obtained from EXAFS analysis, suggesting that the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation is related to the enhanced hydrogenation activity."

          Bimetallic catalysts, including those supported on SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and TiO2, are widely applied in reactions like hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming due to their distinct properties from monometallic catalysts. The extent of PtNi bond formation shows a trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, closely aligned with the observed hydrogenation activity. The Pt/Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits notably higher hydrogenation activity than its counterparts on γ-Al2O3 or TiO2 supports. The correlation between the hydrogenation activity and the PtNi coordination number derived from EXAFS analysis suggests that the formation degree of PtNi bimetallic bonds contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity.

          包括SiO2、γ-Al2O3和TiO2支持的双金属催化剂广泛应用于氢化、脱氢和重整等反应中，它们的特性与单一金属催化剂明显不同。PtNi键形成程度显示出SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2的趋势，与观察到的氢化活性高度吻合。Pt/Ni/SiO2催化剂的氢化活性远高于γ-Al2O3或TiO2支持的催化剂。EXAFS分析得出的PtNi配合数与氢化活性之间的相关性表明，PtNi双金属键形成程度与增强的催化活性有关联。
