          [1] "The synergistic effect of surface and subsurface Ni species at PtNi bimetallic catalysts for CO oxidation was investigated."
          [2] "Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms."
          [3] "Measurements showed that the kinetics of oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are consistent with the activation barriers predicted by DFT (Density Functional Theory)."

          Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were utilized to confirm and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The observed segregation kinetics and activation barriers matched well with DFT predictions.

          [1] "The synergistic effect of surface and subsurface Ni species at PtNi bimetallic catalysts for CO oxidation was studied."
          [2] "The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers were compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions for these systems."

          The experimental techniques used in the study to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems were high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These methods allowed for a quantitative analysis of the distribution of Ni and Co atoms both on the surface and within the subsurface area of the catalyst. The measured segregation kinetics matched well with the theoretical predictions derived from density functional theory (DFT).
