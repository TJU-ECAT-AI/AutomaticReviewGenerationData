This research utilizes HREELS and AES methods to confirm and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of buried 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, within Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic structures. The observed segregation dynamics and energy barriers are contrasted with theoretical DFT calculations for these systems.

The study's significance lies in its examination of the impact of oxide support and support surface area on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on zirconia with low and high surface areas. Characterization results from a previous study on γ-Al2O3-supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts indicate that the bimetallic catalyst nanoparticles exhibit a structure with Pt residing on the top-most surface, closely resembling the Pt-terminated model surface identified in surface science studies. In the presence of adsorbed atomic hydrogen, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface is thermodynamically stable, whereas in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, Ni segregates to the surface to form the NiPtPt(1 1 1) structure. The thermodynamic stability of these Pt/Ni surface configurations is noteworthy because both computational and experimental studies have shown that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates. The activation barrier for the transition between the Pt- and Ni-terminated configurations is relatively low, 15 kcal/mol, suggesting that the transformation can occur at temperatures relevant to calcination, reduction, or reaction during synthesis and testing of supported catalysts.
