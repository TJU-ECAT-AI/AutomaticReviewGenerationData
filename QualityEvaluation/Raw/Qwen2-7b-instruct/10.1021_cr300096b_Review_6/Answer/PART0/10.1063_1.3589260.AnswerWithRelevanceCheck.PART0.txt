         Experimental techniques such as High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The kinetics of this segregation process and the activation barriers were experimentally measured and then compared with predictions made through Density Functional Theory (DFT).

         使用高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和俄歇电子能谱（AES）等实验技术，验证并量化了氧诱导的表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分布。实验测量了这种分离过程的速率和激活势垒，并将其与通过密度泛函理论（DFT）做出的预测进行了比较。
