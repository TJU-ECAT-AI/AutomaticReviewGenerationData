          [1] "The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow us to establish a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."
          [2] "In the current study, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene."
          [3] "Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 also show the thermal behavior of 1 ML of Fe and Cu on Pt(111). Each of these metals was deposited at 300 K. The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition."
          [4] "Fig. 4 shows that the HBE values were predicted to increase as the d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level, in agreement with trends for other surfaces noted in previous studies [13] ,[28] ,[42] ."
          [5] "Consistent with the DFT predictions, the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures had lower desorption temperatures compared with the corresponding parent metals. The surface 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structures promoted a stronger metalhydrogen bond, as indicated by higher desorption temperatures than seen for the corresponding parent metals."
          [6] "In this case, the activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) is calculated. The activity for cyclohexane formation is determined in exactly the same way, but using cyclohexane peak area ratios."
          [7] "Furthermore, a volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."

          Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES confirm the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS verifies the bonding orientation of cyclohexene and its intermediates, showing that cyclohexene is strongly bonded to Pt(111) and Ni(111), while weakly bonded to Pt-Ni-Pt(111). AES quantifies the oxygen-induced segregation kinetics and activation barriers, aligning with DFT predictions for these systems.

          实验技术，如HREELS和AES，确认了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，3d原子（尤其是Ni和Co）的表面层氧化诱导表面分离现象。HREELS验证了环己烯及其中间体的结合方向，表明环己烯与Pt(111)和Ni(111)强烈结合，而与Pt-Ni-Pt(111)的结合较弱。AES量化了由氧气引起的分离动力学和活化能垒，与这些系统的DFT预测相吻合。

          [1] "In the present work, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene."
          [2] "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases."
          [3] "Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.20.3 ML/min. Assuming a layer-by-layer growth mode, we would have expected to see clear breaks in the AES peak-to-peak heights of the Pt and 3d signals as a function of deposition time at the ML coverage."
          [4] "Fig. 1 displays the change in the Pt and Fe AES intensities, along with the ratio of the Fe to Pt intensities, as a function of time at an approximately constant deposition rate. A break in the Fe and Pt intensities at around 300 s is indicative of deposition of the first ML of Fe, at an Fe/Pt AES ratio of 1.6."
          [5] "The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition."
          [6] "The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case."
          [7] "The hydrogen adsorption on the different 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces appears to be different from that of the other 3d metals. H2 desorbed from thick Cu at similar temperatures as Pt(111), but the peak was quite small, likely due to the activation of hydrogen adsorption on surface Cu atoms."
          [8] "In this case, the activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) is calculated. The activity for cyclohexane formation is determined in exactly the same way, but using cyclohexane peak area ratios."
          [9] "Furthermore, a volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."
          [10] "The Cu/Pt(111) surfaces did not follow the trends of the other 3d/Pt(111) surfaces in either the DFT modeling or TPD experiments, which can be partially explained by activation of H2 dissociation on the Cu surfaces."

          AES technique was utilized to characterize the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES peak-to-peak ratio helped determine the quantity of 3d metal deposited, confirming the formation of a monolayer on Pt(111). AES measurements also quantified the deposition and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on Pt(111) surfaces. The surfaces were heated to high temperatures, and AES scans were conducted post-cooling to assess changes in the surface composition. The AES quantification of Fe and Cu deposition demonstrated a gradual diffusion into the subsurface region between 300 and 850 K, and a similar diffusion was observed for Cu at temperatures above 550 K. The AES technique, therefore, played a crucial role in verifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

          AES技术被用于表征Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的3d原子（Ni和Co）表面分层现象。AES峰-峰比帮助确定了3d金属的沉积数量，证实了在Pt(111)上形成了单层。AES测量还量化了Fe和Cu在Pt(111)表面的沉积以及它们的热行为。对表面进行加热并在冷却后进行AES扫描，以评估表面组成的改变。Fe和Cu沉积的AES量测显示，在300至850 K之间的逐步扩散进入亚表面区域，并且在高于550 K的温度下观察到Cu的类似扩散行为。因此，AES技术在验证Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的3d原子表面分层方面发挥了关键作用。
