          [1] "Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have been used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems."
          [2] "The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare favorably with DFT predictions for these systems."

          The experimental techniques HREELS and AES are utilized to confirm and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, within Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The observed segregation rates and activation barriers align well with the predictions made through Density Functional Theory (DFT).
