Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces, accounting for approximately 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. The amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene varies significantly across the surfaces, with the highest concentration on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. The (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy demonstrates a high selectivity for other reaction products, which depend on the Sn concentration.

Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces, accounting for approximately 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. The amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene varies significantly across the surfaces, with the highest concentration on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. The (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy demonstrates a high selectivity for other reaction products, which depend on the Sn concentration. The (2×2) surface alloy exhibits distinct high temperature desorption peaks at 370, 460, and 510 K, while the E3 alloy shows a single intense peak at 370 K. The E3 surface alloy's TPD spectra for methylacetylene is characterized by a dominant peak at 370 K. Increasing the concentration of Sn in the Pt(111) surface alters the H2 desorption temperature during TPD. After exposing the surfaces to methylacetylene, the H2 TPD spectra yield a monolayer coverage. Desorption peaks at 130 K indicate the cracking of the second, physisorbed layer of methylacetylene. Propylene (C3H6, with 42 amu) is the primary product, appearing in a broad feature from 270 to 350 K. Butane (C4H10) is also observed during TPD, with a peak at 165 K associated with a cracking fraction of butane. Benzene (78 amu) desorbs in a broad, reaction rate-limited peak at 550 K. The production of propylene on the three surfaces is quantified by comparing the TPD spectrum from a saturation dose of propylene adsorbed on Pt(111).

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES confirm the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS verifies the bonding orientation of cyclohexene and its intermediates, showing that cyclohexene is strongly bonded to Pt(111) and Ni(111), while weakly bonded to Pt-Ni-Pt(111). AES quantifies the oxygen-induced segregation kinetics and activation barriers, aligning with DFT predictions for these systems.

Experimental techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were employed to observe and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. When the bimetallic catalysts were annealed in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres, Ni became oxidized and formed NiO, which encapsulated the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions, both Pt and Ni remained in their metallic states. Pt segregated onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffused to the subsurface region, leading to the formation of Pt-skin structures. These reversible mass transport processes, responding to the changes between O2 and H2 atmospheres, contributed to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at the PtNi nanoparticle systems.
