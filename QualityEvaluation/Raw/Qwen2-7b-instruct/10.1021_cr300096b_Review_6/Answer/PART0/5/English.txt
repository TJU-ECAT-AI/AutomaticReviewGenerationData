The hydrogenation activity of supported Pt/Ni catalysts was also measured, showing that both benzene and 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation activity correlate well with the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation obtained from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. For comparison, the rate constants of the corresponding monometallic catalysts are also provided in Table 4. Overall, the similarity in the hydrogenation activity suggests that the surface area of alumina does not significantly influence the catalytic activity of the Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts.
