Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.11.023\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/la102069a\], \[10.1021/ja109483a\], and \[10.1016/j.apcata.2011.09.007\]. Experimental methods including high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were utilized to investigate oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, elucidating differences in hydrogenation activity across catalyst supports (SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2). This trend aligns with the coordination numbers of PtNi bonds, indicating the extent of PtNi bond formation significantly impacts catalytic performance. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compared well with density functional theory (DFT) predictions for these systems, validating the experimental findings.

            The synergistic effect of surface and subsurface Ni species at PtNi bimetallic catalysts for CO oxidation was investigated using HREELS and AES. The kinetics of oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are consistent with the activation barriers predicted by DFT, further substantiating the effectiveness of these experimental techniques in studying the behavior of bimetallic systems under oxygen exposure.

            Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed using a JEOL 2010F equipped with a Schottky field emission gun to obtain high-resolution images of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The micrographs were collected in high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode to leverage the Z2 contrast provided by the mode. Images were collected using a 20 nm camera length and a 0.5 nm diameter nanoprobe, showcasing the advanced resolution achievable with this technique.

            Experimental techniques like TEM, pulse CO chemisorption, XAS, FTIR, and HREELS were employed to analyze Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems focusing on Ni and Co surface segregation. High-resolution TEM images were obtained using HAADF mode on a JEOL 2010F microscope. Pulse CO chemisorption monitored reaction dynamics with AMI-200ip, and XAS on Pt LIII-edge detected Pt-3d-Pt bonds. FTIR spectroscopy tracked reactant and product concentrations, while HREELS potentially quantified segregation kinetics, which could be compared with DFT predictions to validate theoretical models.

            Engineering preformed cobalt-doped platinum nanocatalysts for ultraselective hydrogenation involved the use of HREELS and AES to examine surface properties and composition, confirming the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co atoms. The kinetics and activation barriers of this segregation were compared with DFT predictions, highlighting the synergy between experimental and theoretical approaches in understanding catalyst behavior.

            Quantitative analysis of oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems was achieved through HREELS and AES measurements. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers align with DFT predictions, offering insights into the ammonia decomposition activity on Fe-Pt, Co-Pt, and Cu-Pt bimetallic surfaces.

            Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces, accounting for approximately 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. The amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene varies from none on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. The (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy exhibits the highest selectivity for other reaction products, depending on the Sn concentration.

            The experimental studies employing HREELS and AES analyze oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems, revealing kinetics and activation barriers. These findings align with DFT predictions, offering insights into the behavior of these bimetallic systems under oxygen exposure and their role in various chemical reactions.

            Reversible structural changes in PtNi nanoparticles were observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300°C, Ni becomes oxidized, encapsulated by NiO, resulting in the formation of Pt-skin structures. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance, 300°C), both Pt and Ni remain metallic, with Pt segregating to surfaces and Ni diffusing to subsurface regions. This reversible mass transport process contributes to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems.

            A volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was established through the combined experimental results and DFT modeling. The subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures have lower desorption temperatures compared to the corresponding parent metals, indicating stronger metal-hydrogen bonds. The surface 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structures promote a stronger metal-hydrogen bond, as indicated by higher desorption temperatures than seen for the corresponding parent metals.

            Consistent with the DFT predictions, the experimental techniques provide a comprehensive understanding of the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters derived from these experiments are crucial for optimizing the design of efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and related chemical transformations.

            The integrative understanding of the oxygen-induced surface segregation and its impact on the catalytic performance of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems suggests a promising avenue for developing more efficient and selective catalysts. Future research could delve deeper into the mechanistic aspects of oxygen interaction with the bimetallic surfaces, exploring the role of different oxygen adsorption states and their influence on the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. Additionally, investigating the effect of catalyst support properties and composition on the segregation process could lead to the development of novel catalyst architectures with enhanced performance.

            Future endeavors might focus on exploiting the synergistic effect of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems for more specific applications, such as the selective hydrogenation of complex feedstocks or the catalytic conversion of renewable resources. The integration of advanced computational methods with experimental techniques could facilitate the rational design of catalysts tailored to specific industrial needs, potentially revolutionizing the field of catalysis and chemical engineering.
