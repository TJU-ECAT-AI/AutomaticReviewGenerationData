{"Quotes": "<p>Reversible structural changes in PtNi nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results in the formation of Pt-skin structures. The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors have been found in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported HOPG.</p>", "English": "Experimental techniques including XPS and HRTEM were utilized to investigate oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems under alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres.
