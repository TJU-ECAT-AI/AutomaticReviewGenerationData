The experimental techniques utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems typically involve advanced spectroscopic methods such as High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). These techniques offer insights into the composition and structure of the surfaces by analyzing the energy loss spectra or the kinetic energy of ejected electrons, respectively. The measurements yield information on the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which are crucial for understanding the stability and reactivity of the metallic interfaces. These experimental findings often compare favorably with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions, providing a comprehensive validation of theoretical models against real-world observations.

In the context of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) system, the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co atoms can lead to changes in the electronic and structural properties of the surface. The HREELS analysis can detect shifts in the energy loss peaks that correlate with the presence and distribution of the segregated atoms, while AES provides elemental mapping and quantification of the surface composition. The activation barriers and kinetics of the segregation process can be extracted from the decay rates of the signals or the intensity profiles in the spectra, offering direct measurements of the energy required for atoms to move from the bulk to the surface and the rates at which this occurs.

The comparison between the experimental results and DFT predictions involves assessing the accuracy of the theoretical models in describing phenomena such as the energetics of surface adsorption, the effects of oxygen on the surface potential, and the dynamics of atomic migration. This comparison helps refine the theoretical frameworks, ensuring they capture the complexities of real metallic surfaces, including the influence of substrate geometry, interatomic interactions, and environmental factors like oxygen exposure.

In summary, HREELS and AES serve as powerful tools for elucidating the surface chemistry of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems under oxygen exposure, providing detailed insights into the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co atoms. These techniques complement DFT calculations, offering empirical evidence that supports or challenges theoretical predictions, ultimately contributing to a more accurate understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry.

At higher CO partial pressures, the Pt-Sn-O interface becomes more active in the activation of CO. Catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratios around 0.81.2 exhibit the highest activity. Conversely, at lower CO partial pressures, catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratios around 0.40.5 show superior performance. This dependence on CO partial pressure highlights the importance of the Pt-Sn-O interface in the catalytic activity of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 system. The interface's reactivity is influenced by the specific arrangement and concentration of tin atoms, which can alter the oxygen adsorption and desorption kinetics, thus impacting the overall catalytic efficiency. The results underscore the role of tin in enhancing the low-temperature oxidation of CO by modulating the catalytic surface properties in response to varying gas compositions.
