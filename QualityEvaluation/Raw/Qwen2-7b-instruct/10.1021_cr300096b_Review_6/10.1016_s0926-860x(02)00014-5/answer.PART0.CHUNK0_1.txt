[1] "Results obtained both in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen and excess hydrogen are summarized in Table 3 ."
[2] "As emerges from these results in excess hydrogen both the rate of tin anchoring and the values of x are much higher than in its absence (compare W0 and x values in Table 3 for experiments 16 and experiments 712)."
[3] "These facts indicate that excess hydrogen strongly influences both the rate of tin anchoring and the amount of alkyl groups reacted."
[4] "Consequently, in excess hydrogen the extent of coordinative unsaturation increases."
[5] "Therefore, the formation of the surface complex in the second layer (SCSL) with the involvement of CUPSC can be written as follows:"
[6] "In the presence of hydrogen the loss of alkyl groups in SCSL can also take place leading to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated SCSL (CUSCSL, with x1,x2>x):"
[7] "The formed CUSCSL reacts further with additional amount of tin tetraalkyl to form multilayered surface complex (MLSC (I)):"
[8] "The increase of the concentration of tin tetraalkyls in the solution also leads to an increased rate of adsorption of tin tetraalkyl onto the support."
[9] "However, there is a certain concentration limit for the use of Sn(C2H5)4. Upon using our Pt/SiO2 catalyst the concentration limit expressed in [Sn]0/Pts ratio was around 10. Above this limit the wash out procedure was not complete."
[10] "For this reason we consider that in other approaches using tin tetraalkyls in high concentration, but without washing out of the unreacted tin precursor [19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] the partial introduction of tin into the support is unavoidable."

The introduction of tin onto platinum requires new approaches and answers to the following questions: (i) How to increase the amount of tin introduced onto platinum without its introduction onto the support? (ii) Is it possible to create a second or multiple layer of tin organic moieties at the top of the PSC? (iii) How to make PSC as a landing site for additional amount of SnR4? Excess hydrogen strongly influences both the rate of tin anchoring and the amount of alkyl groups reacted, leading to an increase in the extent of coordinative unsaturation. The surface complex in the second layer (SCSL) involves the coordination unsaturated primary surface complex (CUPSC). In the presence of hydrogen, the loss of alkyl groups in SCSL can also take place, forming coordinatively unsaturated SCSL (CUSCSL). The formation of multilayered surface complex (MLSC (I)) occurs through the reaction of CUSCSL with additional amount of tin tetraalkyl. There is a certain concentration limit for the use of tin tetraalkyls, beyond which the washout procedure is not complete, leading to the partial introduction of tin into the support.

增加铂上锡的量需要新的方法和答案：（一）如何在不引入支持的情况下增加锡的量？（二）是否可能在PSC顶部创建第二或多个层的锡有机基团？（三）如何使PSC成为额外SnR4的着陆点？在过量氢气中，锡锚定反应的速率和烷基基团的反应量都增加，导致协同饱和度的增加。第二层表面复合物（SCSL）涉及协调不饱和初级表面复合物（CUPSC）。在氢存在下，SCSL中的烷基基团的丢失也可以发生，形成协同不饱和SCSL（CUSCSL）。通过CUSCSL与额外的锡四烷基的反应，形成了多层表面复合物（MLSC（I））。对于锡四烷基的使用存在一定的浓度限制，在此限制以上，洗出过程不完整，导致支持中部分引入锡。
