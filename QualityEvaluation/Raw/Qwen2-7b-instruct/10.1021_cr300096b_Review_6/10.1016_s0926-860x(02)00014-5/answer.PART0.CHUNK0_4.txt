The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by detecting the changes in chemical bonding states and elemental distribution patterns on the surface. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems. The kinetics and barriers provide insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of the surface segregation processes, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of these materials in various applications.

The role of ionic species in modified platinum catalysts is emphasized, suggesting their importance in enhancing the selectivity of carbonyl hydrogenation reactions. The Snn+carbonyl interaction is proposed to be responsible for the increased selectivity in supported Sn-Pt catalysts, requiring the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites. These sites are crucial for the efficient activation of carbonyl groups and the CO molecule.

In SnO2-supported catalysts, a synergistic effect between the oxide and metal phases is suggested, while the formation of the SnPt alloy phase has been proposed for the activation of CO. An alternative reaction mechanism involving the PtSnO2 interface is put forward for the activation of CO, highlighting the importance of the interfacial structure in catalytic processes.

The controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum allow for the formation of supported alloy type Sn-Pt nanoclusters with exclusive tin-platinum interaction. By optimizing the conditions, the introduction of tin into the support can almost be completely avoided, reducing unwanted side reactions and improving the catalyst's performance. Similar approaches using one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto other noble or transition metals have been developed, showing high Snanch/Ms ratios but also introducing tin into the support.

The results discussed in this study confirm the effectiveness of Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and low-temperature CO oxidation, demonstrating the in situ formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites involved in the activation of carbonyl groups and the CO molecule.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，通过检测表面化学结合状态和元素分布模式的变化，验证并量化氧诱导表面相分离，特别是Ni和Co在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的相分离。测量的相分离动力学和激活壁垒与DFT预测进行比较，为这些系统的表面相分离过程提供了热力学和动力学见解，对于理解这些材料在各种应用中的行为至关重要。

在改性铂催化剂中，离子物种的作用受到强调，表明它们在增强羰基氢化反应选择性方面的关键作用。Snn+羰基相互作用被提议是支持的Sn-Pt催化剂增加选择性的原因，需要形成Snn+Pt簇集，即在金属位点或金属-支撑界面稳定化的离子Snn+物种。这些簇集对有效激活羰基组分和CO分子至关重要。

在SnO2支撑催化剂中，氧化物和金属相之间的协同作用被提出，而形成的SnPt合金相被提议用于CO的活化。提出了一种涉及PtSnO2界面的替代反应机制来活化CO，突出了界面结构在催化过程中的重要性。

控制表面反应（CSRs）之间锡四烷基化合物和吸附在铂上的氢之间的反应允许形成具有唯一锡-铂相互作用的支撑合金型Sn-Pt纳米团簇。通过优化条件，可以几乎完全避免将锡引入支撑，从而减少不必要的副反应并提高催化剂的性能。使用其他贵金属或过渡金属上的一步锚定锡四烷基化合物的类似方法已被开发，显示出高Snanch/Ms比率，但也引入了锡到支撑。

在本研究中讨论的结果证实了Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂在选择性氢化α,β-不饱和醛和低温CO氧化中的有效性，证明了原位形成Sn4+Pt簇集参与羰基组分和CO分子的活化。
