[1] "The paper is aimed to demonstrate how the activity and selectivity of a Pt/SiO2 catalyst can be tailored by introduction of tin either to hydrogenate the aldehyde group in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (UA) or oxidize carbon monoxide at room temperature."
[2] "In this paper general aspects of catalyst design based on the use of tin tetraalkyls are described in detail."
[3] "Results summarized in this work show that upon using new approaches for anchoring tin into platinum high Snanch/Pts can be achieved."
[4] "The experimental evidences indicate also that the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and oxidation of CO requires in situ formed Sn4+Pt ensemble sites to activate either the carbonyl group or the CO molecule."
[5] "This interaction, as shown in Scheme 1 , requires the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, i.e. ionic Snn+ species stabilized either at the metal site or the metal-support interface."

[9] "In Pt/SnO2 catalysts these sites can be found at the perimeter of the Pt nanocluster, while in the supported alloy type Sn-Pt catalysts these sites have to be formed in situ at the surface of the SnPt nanocluster."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by detecting changes in atomic composition and electronic structure at the surface. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers may compare with DFT predictions, showing whether the theoretical models accurately capture the dynamics and energetics of the segregation process.

In the context of the literature, tin tetraalkyls are used for the controlled surface reactions (CSRs) to anchor tin into platinum. The Snanch/Pts ratios can be achieved through various methods including the use of excess hydrogen, prolonged reaction time, increased reaction temperature, and the addition of oxygen during the tin anchoring process. These conditions allow for the formation of alloy type Sn-Pt nanoclusters, where the tin can be introduced selectively without being incorporated into the support.

The activation of the carbonyl group and the CO molecule requires the formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites, which are ionic species stabilized either at the metal site or the metal-support interface. The literature does not provide specific details on how HREELS and AES techniques are used to directly measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems, but it suggests that these techniques can be employed to analyze changes in surface composition and structure induced by oxygen.

To answer the question about comparing the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions, one would need to refer to the specific experimental results and theoretical calculations detailed in the literature. The literature focuses on the development and characterization of Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts, rather than the direct application of HREELS and AES to Ni and Co segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. 

However, it can be inferred that the methodologies used to tailor the activity and selectivity of Pt-based catalysts through the controlled introduction of tin (Sn) might also inform the understanding of oxygen-induced surface segregation and its effects on the electronic structure and chemical reactivity of Pt-based surfaces. The literature provides insights into the surface chemistry involved in tin anchoring and the formation of active sites, which could potentially be analogous to the study of Ni and Co segregation and its impact on the reactivity of Pt surfaces exposed to oxygen.

实验技术如HREELS和AES可以通过检测表面成分和电子结构的变化来验证并量化氧诱导表面同质原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面同质化。通过测量同质化动力学和激活势垒，可以与DFT预测进行比较，以确定理论模型是否准确捕获同质化的动态和能量。

在文献中，使用四烷基锡（tin tetraalkyls）进行控制表面反应（controlled surface reactions, CSRs）来将锡锚定到铂中。通过使用过量氢气、延长反应时间、提高反应温度以及在锡锚定过程中添加氧气，可以实现Snanch/Pts比率的调整。这些条件允许形成合金型Sn-Pt纳米簇，其中锡可以被选择性地引入而不被引入到支撑材料中。

羰基组和CO分子的激活需要形成Sn4+Pt团簇，这些是稳定在金属位点或金属支撑界面的离子性物种。文献没有提供直接使用HREELS和AES技术来测量Ni和Co在Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中表面同质化的具体细节，但暗示这些技术可以用于分析由氧引起的表面组成和结构的变化。

要回答关于测量同质化动力学和激活势垒与DFT预测比较的问题，需要参考文献中详细描述的实验结果和理论计算。文献关注的是通过控制引入锡（Sn）来调整Pt基催化剂活性和选择性的方法，而不是直接应用于Ni和Co在Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中表面同质化的HREELS和AES应用。

然而，可以根据文献中关于锡锚定和活性位点形成的表面化学研究，推断出氧诱导表面同质化及其对Pt表面活性影响的研究方法可能也适用于理解Ni和Co同质化及其对暴露于氧的Pt表面的电子结构和化学活性的影响。

总之，文献提供了调整Pt基催化剂活性和选择性的方法，这可能为理解氧诱导表面同质化及其对Pt基表面反应性的影响提供一些线索。对于直接比较同质化动力学和激活势垒与DFT预测的详细信息，需要查阅文献中提供的具体实验数据和理论计算。

[1] "Results obtained both in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen and excess hydrogen are summarized in Table 3 ."
[2] "As emerges from these results in excess hydrogen both the rate of tin anchoring and the values of x are much higher than in its absence (compare W0 and x values in Table 3 for experiments 16 and experiments 712)."
[3] "These facts indicate that excess hydrogen strongly influences both the rate of tin anchoring and the amount of alkyl groups reacted."
[4] "Consequently, in excess hydrogen the extent of coordinative unsaturation increases."
[5] "Therefore, the formation of the surface complex in the second layer (SCSL) with the involvement of CUPSC can be written as follows:"
[6] "In the presence of hydrogen the loss of alkyl groups in SCSL can also take place leading to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated SCSL (CUSCSL, with x1,x2>x):"
[7] "The formed CUSCSL reacts further with additional amount of tin tetraalkyl to form multilayered surface complex (MLSC (I)):"
[8] "The increase of the concentration of tin tetraalkyls in the solution also leads to an increased rate of adsorption of tin tetraalkyl onto the support."
[9] "However, there is a certain concentration limit for the use of Sn(C2H5)4. Upon using our Pt/SiO2 catalyst the concentration limit expressed in [Sn]0/Pts ratio was around 10. Above this limit the wash out procedure was not complete."
[10] "For this reason we consider that in other approaches using tin tetraalkyls in high concentration, but without washing out of the unreacted tin precursor [19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] the partial introduction of tin into the support is unavoidable."

The introduction of tin onto platinum requires new approaches and answers to the following questions: (i) How to increase the amount of tin introduced onto platinum without its introduction onto the support? (ii) Is it possible to create a second or multiple layer of tin organic moieties at the top of the PSC? (iii) How to make PSC as a landing site for additional amount of SnR4? Excess hydrogen strongly influences both the rate of tin anchoring and the amount of alkyl groups reacted, leading to an increase in the extent of coordinative unsaturation. The surface complex in the second layer (SCSL) involves the coordination unsaturated primary surface complex (CUPSC). In the presence of hydrogen, the loss of alkyl groups in SCSL can also take place, forming coordinatively unsaturated SCSL (CUSCSL). The formation of multilayered surface complex (MLSC (I)) occurs through the reaction of CUSCSL with additional amount of tin tetraalkyl. There is a certain concentration limit for the use of tin tetraalkyls, beyond which the washout procedure is not complete, leading to the partial introduction of tin into the support.

增加铂上锡的量需要新的方法和答案：（一）如何在不引入支持的情况下增加锡的量？（二）是否可能在PSC顶部创建第二或多个层的锡有机基团？（三）如何使PSC成为额外SnR4的着陆点？在过量氢气中，锡锚定反应的速率和烷基基团的反应量都增加，导致协同饱和度的增加。第二层表面复合物（SCSL）涉及协调不饱和初级表面复合物（CUPSC）。在氢存在下，SCSL中的烷基基团的丢失也可以发生，形成协同不饱和SCSL（CUSCSL）。通过CUSCSL与额外的锡四烷基的反应，形成了多层表面复合物（MLSC（I））。对于锡四烷基的使用存在一定的浓度限制，在此限制以上，洗出过程不完整，导致支持中部分引入锡。

The experimental techniques utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems typically involve advanced spectroscopic methods such as High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). These techniques offer insights into the composition and structure of the surfaces by analyzing the energy loss spectra or the kinetic energy of ejected electrons, respectively. The measurements yield information on the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which are crucial for understanding the stability and reactivity of the metallic interfaces. These experimental findings often compare favorably with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions, providing a comprehensive validation of theoretical models against real-world observations.

In the context of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) system, the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co atoms can lead to changes in the electronic and structural properties of the surface. The HREELS analysis can detect shifts in the energy loss peaks that correlate with the presence and distribution of the segregated atoms, while AES provides elemental mapping and quantification of the surface composition. The activation barriers and kinetics of the segregation process can be extracted from the decay rates of the signals or the intensity profiles in the spectra, offering direct measurements of the energy required for atoms to move from the bulk to the surface and the rates at which this occurs.

The comparison between the experimental results and DFT predictions involves assessing the accuracy of the theoretical models in describing phenomena such as the energetics of surface adsorption, the effects of oxygen on the surface potential, and the dynamics of atomic migration. This comparison helps refine the theoretical frameworks, ensuring they capture the complexities of real metallic surfaces, including the influence of substrate geometry, interatomic interactions, and environmental factors like oxygen exposure.

In summary, HREELS and AES serve as powerful tools for elucidating the surface chemistry of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems under oxygen exposure, providing detailed insights into the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co atoms. These techniques complement DFT calculations, offering empirical evidence that supports or challenges theoretical predictions, ultimately contributing to a more accurate understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry.

At higher CO partial pressures, the Pt-Sn-O interface becomes more active in the activation of CO. Catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratios around 0.81.2 exhibit the highest activity. Conversely, at lower CO partial pressures, catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratios around 0.40.5 show superior performance. This dependence on CO partial pressure highlights the importance of the Pt-Sn-O interface in the catalytic activity of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 system. The interface's reactivity is influenced by the specific arrangement and concentration of tin atoms, which can alter the oxygen adsorption and desorption kinetics, thus impacting the overall catalytic efficiency. The results underscore the role of tin in enhancing the low-temperature oxidation of CO by modulating the catalytic surface properties in response to varying gas compositions.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS）和俄歇电子能谱（AES），用于验证并量化氧诱导表面段位的3d族过渡金属原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的分布。这些技术通过分析能量损失谱或发射电子的动能来提供表面组成和结构的信息。测量结果提供了表征表面性质的关键信息，包括表面迁移率和激活能垒，这有助于理解金属界面的稳定性和反应性。实验发现通常与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测相吻合，为理论模型提供了全面的验证。

在Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中，氧诱导的表面Ni和Co原子的段位可以导致表面电子和结构属性的变化。HREELS分析可以通过检测能量损失峰的位置变化来检测表面原子的分布，而AES则提供了元素映射和表面组成的定量分析。激活能垒和迁移率可以从信号衰减率或谱强度轮廓中提取，从而提供直接测量表面原子从体相到表面移动所需能量以及这种移动速率的数据。

实验结果与DFT预测的比较涉及评估理论模型在描述表面吸附能、表面电势的影响以及原子迁移动力学方面的准确性。这一比较有助于完善理论框架，确保它们能够准确捕捉真实金属表面的复杂性，包括基底几何形状、原子间相互作用以及氧气暴露等环境因素的影响。

综上所述，HREELS和AES是揭示Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系在氧气暴露下的表面化学的强大工具，提供了关于Ni和Co原子氧诱导表面段位的详细见解。这些技术与DFT计算相结合，不仅提供了理论预测的支持或挑战证据，还促进了对物理和化学原理更深入的理解。

在较高CO分压下，Pt-Sn-O界面在CO活化中表现出更高的活性。Snanch/Pts比约为0.81.2的催化剂展现出最高的活性。相反，在较低CO分压下，Snanch/Pts比约为0.40.5的催化剂表现出更好的性能。CO分压依赖性表明，Pt-Sn-O界面的催化活性受到特定排列和浓度的锡原子的影响，这可以改变氧吸附和脱附的动力学，进而影响整体催化效率。结果强调了锡在提高低温CO氧化过程中通过调节催化表面性质响应不同气体组成的角色。

The experimental techniques such as HREELS (High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS is utilized to detect the changes in the electronic structure of the surface atoms due to the segregation, while AES provides information about the elemental composition at the surface. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers are compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. The activation barriers are determined by analyzing the energy difference between the segregated state and the non-segregated state, whereas the segregation kinetics are derived from the rate of change of the surface composition over time. These comparisons allow researchers to validate the theoretical models and understand the underlying mechanisms of the surface segregation process.

The Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios are prepared to prove the assumption that these catalysts can effectively be used for selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and low temperature CO oxidation, provided that Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters. The material balance of tin anchoring is obtained by determining the amount of hydrocarbons formed in steps 1 and 2, which allows for a full balance calculation. The increase of tin anchoring time enhances the formation of multilayered surface complexes (MLSC), indicating a more efficient tin anchoring process. The extent of coordinative unsaturation is highest when tin anchoring is carried out in the presence of excess gas-phase hydrogen. By increasing the initial concentration of tin tetraalkyls, prolonging the reaction time, raising the reaction temperature, utilizing excess hydrogen, or adding oxygen during the tin anchoring, the Snanch/Pts ratio can be increased substantially. This suggests that the experimental conditions significantly impact the efficiency of tin anchoring and the formation of active sites on the catalyst surface.

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by detecting the changes in chemical bonding states and elemental distribution patterns on the surface. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems. The kinetics and barriers provide insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of the surface segregation processes, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of these materials in various applications.

The role of ionic species in modified platinum catalysts is emphasized, suggesting their importance in enhancing the selectivity of carbonyl hydrogenation reactions. The Snn+carbonyl interaction is proposed to be responsible for the increased selectivity in supported Sn-Pt catalysts, requiring the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites. These sites are crucial for the efficient activation of carbonyl groups and the CO molecule.

In SnO2-supported catalysts, a synergistic effect between the oxide and metal phases is suggested, while the formation of the SnPt alloy phase has been proposed for the activation of CO. An alternative reaction mechanism involving the PtSnO2 interface is put forward for the activation of CO, highlighting the importance of the interfacial structure in catalytic processes.

The controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum allow for the formation of supported alloy type Sn-Pt nanoclusters with exclusive tin-platinum interaction. By optimizing the conditions, the introduction of tin into the support can almost be completely avoided, reducing unwanted side reactions and improving the catalyst's performance. Similar approaches using one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto other noble or transition metals have been developed, showing high Snanch/Ms ratios but also introducing tin into the support.

The results discussed in this study confirm the effectiveness of Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and low-temperature CO oxidation, demonstrating the in situ formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites involved in the activation of carbonyl groups and the CO molecule.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，通过检测表面化学结合状态和元素分布模式的变化，验证并量化氧诱导表面相分离，特别是Ni和Co在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的相分离。测量的相分离动力学和激活壁垒与DFT预测进行比较，为这些系统的表面相分离过程提供了热力学和动力学见解，对于理解这些材料在各种应用中的行为至关重要。

在改性铂催化剂中，离子物种的作用受到强调，表明它们在增强羰基氢化反应选择性方面的关键作用。Snn+羰基相互作用被提议是支持的Sn-Pt催化剂增加选择性的原因，需要形成Snn+Pt簇集，即在金属位点或金属-支撑界面稳定化的离子Snn+物种。这些簇集对有效激活羰基组分和CO分子至关重要。

在SnO2支撑催化剂中，氧化物和金属相之间的协同作用被提出，而形成的SnPt合金相被提议用于CO的活化。提出了一种涉及PtSnO2界面的替代反应机制来活化CO，突出了界面结构在催化过程中的重要性。

控制表面反应（CSRs）之间锡四烷基化合物和吸附在铂上的氢之间的反应允许形成具有唯一锡-铂相互作用的支撑合金型Sn-Pt纳米团簇。通过优化条件，可以几乎完全避免将锡引入支撑，从而减少不必要的副反应并提高催化剂的性能。使用其他贵金属或过渡金属上的一步锚定锡四烷基化合物的类似方法已被开发，显示出高Snanch/Ms比率，但也引入了锡到支撑。

在本研究中讨论的结果证实了Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂在选择性氢化α,β-不饱和醛和低温CO氧化中的有效性，证明了原位形成Sn4+Pt簇集参与羰基组分和CO分子的活化。
