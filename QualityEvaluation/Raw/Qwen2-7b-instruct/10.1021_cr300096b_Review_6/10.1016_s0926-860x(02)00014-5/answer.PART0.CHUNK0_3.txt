1. "It should also be emphasized that in the selective hydrogenation of UA, in addition to the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, the adsorption of both the substrate and the formed crotylalcohol with their olefinic double bond should also be suppressed."
2. "In SnO2 supported catalysts a synergism between the oxide and the metal phases has been suggested [9] ,[10] ."
3. "Upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."
4. "In order to prove this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared."
5. "The amount of hydrocarbons formed in steps 1 and 2, (nI and nII in mol/gcat, respectively) were determined by GC allowing to obtain full material balance of tin anchoring."
6. "The comparison of these two samples shows how the increase of tin anchoring time enhances the formation of MLSC."
7. "The highest extent of coordinative unsaturation has been obtained when tin anchoring has been carried out in the presence of excess gas-phase hydrogen."
8. "Results presented in Table 3 indicate that the Snanch/Pts ratio can be increased substantially under the following experimental conditions of tin anchoring: (i) high initial concentration of Sn(C2H5)4; (ii) prolonged reaction time; (iii) increased reaction temperature; (iv) use of excess hydrogen; (v) addition of oxygen during tin anchoring."

The experimental techniques such as HREELS (High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS is utilized to detect the changes in the electronic structure of the surface atoms due to the segregation, while AES provides information about the elemental composition at the surface. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers are compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. The activation barriers are determined by analyzing the energy difference between the segregated state and the non-segregated state, whereas the segregation kinetics are derived from the rate of change of the surface composition over time. These comparisons allow researchers to validate the theoretical models and understand the underlying mechanisms of the surface segregation process.

The Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios are prepared to prove the assumption that these catalysts can effectively be used for selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and low temperature CO oxidation, provided that Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters. The material balance of tin anchoring is obtained by determining the amount of hydrocarbons formed in steps 1 and 2, which allows for a full balance calculation. The increase of tin anchoring time enhances the formation of multilayered surface complexes (MLSC), indicating a more efficient tin anchoring process. The extent of coordinative unsaturation is highest when tin anchoring is carried out in the presence of excess gas-phase hydrogen. By increasing the initial concentration of tin tetraalkyls, prolonging the reaction time, raising the reaction temperature, utilizing excess hydrogen, or adding oxygen during the tin anchoring, the Snanch/Pts ratio can be increased substantially. This suggests that the experimental conditions significantly impact the efficiency of tin anchoring and the formation of active sites on the catalyst surface.

实验技术如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和AES（Auger电子能谱）用于验证并量化氧诱导表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的表面分布。HREELS用于检测由于分离引起的表面原子电子结构的变化，而AES提供了关于表面成分的信息。通过比较测量的分离动力学和激活壁垒与DFT（密度泛函理论）预测的结果，研究人员可以验证理论模型并理解表面分离过程的内在机制。激活壁垒通过分析分离状态和非分离状态之间的能量差异来确定，而分离动力学则从随时间变化的表面组成率中得出。这些比较允许研究人员验证理论模型并了解表面分离过程的基本原理。

不同Snanch/Pts比例的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂被制备以证明假设：这些催化剂能够有效地用于选择性氢化α,β-不饱和醛和低温CO氧化，前提是Sn4+Pt复合体可以在支持的SnPt纳米簇上原位形成。通过确定步骤1和2中形成的烃类物质的量来获得锡附着平衡，这允许进行全面的平衡计算。增加锡附着时间可以增强多层表面复合物（MLSC）的形成，表明更有效的锡附着过程。当在过量气体相氢气存在下进行锡附着时，可以获得最大的协同结合度。通过增加锡四烷基化合物的初始浓度、延长反应时间、提高反应温度、使用过量氢气或在锡附着过程中添加氧气，可以显著增加Snanch/Pts比率。这表明实验条件对锡附着效率和催化剂表面活性位点的形成有重大影响。
