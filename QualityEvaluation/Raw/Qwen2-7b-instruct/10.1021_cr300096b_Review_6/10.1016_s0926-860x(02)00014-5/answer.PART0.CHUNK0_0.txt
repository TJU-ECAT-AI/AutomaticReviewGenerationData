[1] "The paper is aimed to demonstrate how the activity and selectivity of a Pt/SiO2 catalyst can be tailored by introduction of tin either to hydrogenate the aldehyde group in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (UA) or oxidize carbon monoxide at room temperature."
[2] "In this paper general aspects of catalyst design based on the use of tin tetraalkyls are described in detail."
[3] "Results summarized in this work show that upon using new approaches for anchoring tin into platinum high Snanch/Pts can be achieved."
[4] "The experimental evidences indicate also that the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and oxidation of CO requires in situ formed Sn4+Pt ensemble sites to activate either the carbonyl group or the CO molecule."
[5] "This interaction, as shown in Scheme 1 , requires the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, i.e. ionic Snn+ species stabilized either at the metal site or the metal-support interface."
[6] "As emerges from Scheme 1 , Scheme 2 the activation of the CO molecule and the carbonyl group shows distinct similarities."
[7] "Upon using Sn(CH3)4, Sn(C2H5)4, and Sn(C4H9)4 the following Snanch/Pts ratios were obtained: 0.6, 0.4, and 0.3, respectively."
[8] "In summary, upon using CSRs supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters can be obtained and under optimized conditions the introduction of tin into the support can almost completely be avoided."
[9] "In Pt/SnO2 catalysts these sites can be found at the perimeter of the Pt nanocluster, while in the supported alloy type Sn-Pt catalysts these sites have to be formed in situ at the surface of the SnPt nanocluster."
[10] "It is due to (i) the limited number of surface platinum atoms (Pts) available for anchoring and (ii) steric hindrance created by the extent of the alkyl groups in PSC."
[11] "In order to prove this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared."
[12] "Details on the preparation of these catalysts and their test results will be summarized in this study."
[13] "The decomposition of PSCs is shown in Fig. 1 AC."
[14] "The comparison of the TPR pattern given in Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 clearly shows the build-up of the second layer for samples prepared in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen."
[15] "The increase of tin anchoring time can also be used to enhance the amount of tin anchored."
[16] "Results presented in Table 3 indicate that the Snanch/Pts ratio can be increased substantially under the following experimental conditions of tin anchoring: (i) high initial concentration of Sn(C2H5)4; (ii) prolonged reaction time; (iii) increased reaction temperature; (iv) use of excess hydrogen; (v) addition of oxygen during tin anchoring."
[17] "The increase of the concentration of tin tetraalkyls in the solution also leads to an increased rate of adsorption of tin tetraalkyl onto the support."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by detecting changes in atomic composition and electronic structure at the surface. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers may compare with DFT predictions, showing whether the theoretical models accurately capture the dynamics and energetics of the segregation process.

In the context of the literature, tin tetraalkyls are used for the controlled surface reactions (CSRs) to anchor tin into platinum. The Snanch/Pts ratios can be achieved through various methods including the use of excess hydrogen, prolonged reaction time, increased reaction temperature, and the addition of oxygen during the tin anchoring process. These conditions allow for the formation of alloy type Sn-Pt nanoclusters, where the tin can be introduced selectively without being incorporated into the support.

The activation of the carbonyl group and the CO molecule requires the formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites, which are ionic species stabilized either at the metal site or the metal-support interface. The literature does not provide specific details on how HREELS and AES techniques are used to directly measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems, but it suggests that these techniques can be employed to analyze changes in surface composition and structure induced by oxygen.

To answer the question about comparing the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions, one would need to refer to the specific experimental results and theoretical calculations detailed in the literature. The literature focuses on the development and characterization of Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts, rather than the direct application of HREELS and AES to Ni and Co segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. 

However, it can be inferred that the methodologies used to tailor the activity and selectivity of Pt-based catalysts through the controlled introduction of tin (Sn) might also inform the understanding of oxygen-induced surface segregation and its effects on the electronic structure and chemical reactivity of Pt-based surfaces. The literature provides insights into the surface chemistry involved in tin anchoring and the formation of active sites, which could potentially be analogous to the study of Ni and Co segregation and its impact on the reactivity of Pt surfaces exposed to oxygen.

实验技术如HREELS和AES可以通过检测表面成分和电子结构的变化来验证并量化氧诱导表面同质原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面同质化。通过测量同质化动力学和激活势垒，可以与DFT预测进行比较，以确定理论模型是否准确捕获同质化的动态和能量。

在文献中，使用四烷基锡（tin tetraalkyls）进行控制表面反应（controlled surface reactions, CSRs）来将锡锚定到铂中。通过使用过量氢气、延长反应时间、提高反应温度以及在锡锚定过程中添加氧气，可以实现Snanch/Pts比率的调整。这些条件允许形成合金型Sn-Pt纳米簇，其中锡可以被选择性地引入而不被引入到支撑材料中。

羰基组和CO分子的激活需要形成Sn4+Pt团簇，这些是稳定在金属位点或金属支撑界面的离子性物种。文献没有提供直接使用HREELS和AES技术来测量Ni和Co在Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中表面同质化的具体细节，但暗示这些技术可以用于分析由氧引起的表面组成和结构的变化。

要回答关于测量同质化动力学和激活势垒与DFT预测比较的问题，需要参考文献中详细描述的实验结果和理论计算。文献关注的是通过控制引入锡（Sn）来调整Pt基催化剂活性和选择性的方法，而不是直接应用于Ni和Co在Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中表面同质化的HREELS和AES应用。

然而，可以根据文献中关于锡锚定和活性位点形成的表面化学研究，推断出氧诱导表面同质化及其对Pt表面活性影响的研究方法可能也适用于理解Ni和Co同质化及其对暴露于氧的Pt表面的电子结构和化学活性的影响。

总之，文献提供了调整Pt基催化剂活性和选择性的方法，这可能为理解氧诱导表面同质化及其对Pt基表面反应性的影响提供一些线索。对于直接比较同质化动力学和激活势垒与DFT预测的详细信息，需要查阅文献中提供的具体实验数据和理论计算。
