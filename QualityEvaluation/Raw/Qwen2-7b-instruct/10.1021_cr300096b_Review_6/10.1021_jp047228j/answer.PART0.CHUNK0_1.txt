On Pt(111), part of the C5H8 desorbs intact at 280 K whereas the remaining amount is converted to C5H5. This species completely dehydrogenates to carbon upon heating above 450 K. On the surface alloys, the temperature of desorption is reduced to 244 K (Pt3Sn) and 198 K (Pt2Sn), respectively, and no dehydrogenation is detected.

On Pt(111), cyclopentene (C5H8) desorbs at 280 K, and while part of it remains intact, the rest converts to cyclopentadiene (C5H5). This compound fully dehydrates to carbon at temperatures above 450 K. On the Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn surface alloys, the desorption temperature of cyclopentene is lowered to 244 K and 198 K, respectively. Notably, no dehydrogenation is observed on these alloys.

在Pt(111)上，C5H8在280 K时开始脱附，部分保持完整，其余则转化为C5H5。该化合物在高于450 K的温度下完全脱水为碳。在Pt3Sn和Pt2Sn表面合金上，C5H8的脱附温度分别降低至244 K和198 K。值得注意的是，在这些合金上未观察到脱氢化现象。
