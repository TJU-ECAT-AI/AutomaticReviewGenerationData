The adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and the ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was studied using various experimental techniques like high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and temperature-programmed desorption. The di-σ bonding of cyclopentene was found on all surfaces both experimentally and in DFT calculations. However, the bond energy and thermal stability of cyclopentene differed significantly between Pt(111) and the surface alloys. On Pt(111), part of the cyclopentene desorbs intact at 280 K, while the rest converts to C5H5, which dehydrogenates above 450 K. On the surface alloys, the desorption temperature is lowered to 244 K (Pt3Sn) and 198 K (Pt2Sn), respectively, with no dehydrogenation detected.

对Pt(111)及其相应的Pt3Sn/Pt(111)和Pt2Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上环戊烯的吸附进行了研究，使用了多种实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱、紫外光电离光谱、低能电子衍射和程序升温脱附。在所有表面上都发现了环戊烯的di-σ键合，无论是实验结果还是在密度泛函理论（DFT）计算中。然而，环戊烯在Pt(111)和表面合金上的结合能和热稳定性存在显著差异。在Pt(111)上，部分环戊烯在280 K时完整脱附，其余部分转化为C5H5，该物种在加热至450 K以上时完全脱氢。而在表面合金上，脱附温度降低至244 K（Pt3Sn）和198 K（Pt2Sn），且未检测到脱氢作用。
