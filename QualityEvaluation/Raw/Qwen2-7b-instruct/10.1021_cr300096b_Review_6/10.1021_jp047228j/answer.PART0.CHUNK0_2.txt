<p>The adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and on the ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was investigated experimentally by TPD, UPS, and HREELS as well as theoretically by ab initio DFT calculations.</p>
<p>On Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys, cyclopentene is di-σ-bonded occupying bridge sites. A detailed analysis of the adsorption geometry based on the DFT calculation has been presented. It shows in the case of cyclopentene on Pt(111) the formation of a weak Pt3Hβ bond, which is responsible for the facile dehydrogenation on this surface. This bond is much weaker on both surface alloys, which partially explains the absence of dehydrogenation on Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111).</p>
<p>The decrease of the adsorption energy of cyclopentene on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111) can be attributed to the changed electronic structure of the surface alloys and is, therefore, due to a ligand effect. The results show a great resemblance to the behavior of ethene on the same surfaces.10,11 This suggests that, due to the similar bonding mechanisms, our results can also account for the chemisorption properties of ethene on the PtnSn(111) surface alloys. They are also related to the behavior of unsaturated aldehydes on the same surfaces.6</p>

The experimental techniques, including Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD), Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS), and High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS), along with theoretical Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, were utilized to investigate the adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and the ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. The adsorption is characterized by a di-σ bonding mechanism on all surfaces, with the formation of a weak Pt3Hβ bond on Pt(111) being responsible for the ease of dehydrogenation on this surface. This bond is notably weaker on the surface alloys, which partially explains the absence of dehydrogenation on Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111). The decrease in adsorption energy on the surface alloys, attributed to the altered electronic structure and resulting from a ligand effect, is comparable to the behavior of ethene and unsaturated aldehydes on the same surfaces, providing insights into their chemisorption properties.

实验技术，包括温度程序脱附（TPD）、紫外光电子能谱（UPS）和高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS），以及理论密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，用于研究环戊烯在Pt(111)和有序的Pt3Sn/Pt(111)和Pt2Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附。所有表面上的吸附都表现为二σ键结合机制，在Pt(111)表面上形成的弱Pt3Hβ键是导致该表面上容易脱氢化的原因。这种键在表面合金上明显较弱，部分解释了Pt3Sn/Pt(111)和Pt2Sn/Pt(111)表面上的脱氢化缺失。吸附能降低在表面合金上的降低，归因于电子结构的变化和由此产生的配体效应，与相同表面上的乙烷和不饱和醛的性质相似，提供了这些物质吸附性质的见解。
