The adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and the two ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was studied using multiple experimental techniques including high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and temperature-programmed desorption. Theoretical calculations were also performed using ab initio density functional theory (DFT). The bonding of cyclopentene on all surfaces was found to be di-σ, but the bond energy and thermal stability varied significantly. On Pt(111), cyclopentene desorbs at 280 K, with further dehydrogenation occurring at 450 K. In contrast, the desorption temperatures on the surface alloys were reduced to 244 K (Pt3Sn) and 198 K (Pt2Sn), with no dehydrogenation observed.

对Pt(111)及其相应的Pt3Sn/Pt(111)和Pt2Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上环戊烯的吸附进行了研究，使用了多种实验技术，包括高分辨率电子能量损失光谱、紫外光电离光谱、低能电子衍射和温度程序脱附。还进行了基于第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）的理论计算。所有表面上的环戊烯吸附都被发现是通过双σ键形成的，但键能和热稳定性存在显著差异。在Pt(111)上，环戊烯在280 K时完整脱附，进一步脱氢发生在450 K时。相比之下，表面合金上的脱附温度分别降低至244 K（Pt3Sn）和198 K（Pt2Sn），且未观察到脱氢化。

On Pt(111), cyclopentene (C5H8) desorbs at 280 K, and while part of it remains intact, the rest converts to cyclopentadiene (C5H5). This compound fully dehydrates to carbon at temperatures above 450 K. On the Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn surface alloys, the desorption temperature of cyclopentene is lowered to 244 K and 198 K, respectively. Notably, no dehydrogenation is observed on these alloys.

在Pt(111)上，C5H8在280 K时开始脱附，部分保持完整，其余则转化为C5H5。该化合物在高于450 K的温度下完全脱水为碳。在Pt3Sn和Pt2Sn表面合金上，C5H8的脱附温度分别降低至244 K和198 K。值得注意的是，在这些合金上未观察到脱氢化现象。

<p>The adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and on the ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was investigated experimentally by TPD, UPS, and HREELS as well as theoretically by ab initio DFT calculations.</p>
<p>On Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys, cyclopentene is di-σ-bonded occupying bridge sites. A detailed analysis of the adsorption geometry based on the DFT calculation has been presented. It shows in the case of cyclopentene on Pt(111) the formation of a weak Pt3Hβ bond, which is responsible for the facile dehydrogenation on this surface. This bond is much weaker on both surface alloys, which partially explains the absence of dehydrogenation on Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111).</p>
<p>The decrease of the adsorption energy of cyclopentene on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111) can be attributed to the changed electronic structure of the surface alloys and is, therefore, due to a ligand effect. The results show a great resemblance to the behavior of ethene on the same surfaces.10,11 This suggests that, due to the similar bonding mechanisms, our results can also account for the chemisorption properties of ethene on the PtnSn(111) surface alloys. They are also related to the behavior of unsaturated aldehydes on the same surfaces.6</p>

The experimental techniques, including Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD), Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS), and High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS), along with theoretical Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, were utilized to investigate the adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and the ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. The adsorption is characterized by a di-σ bonding mechanism on all surfaces, with the formation of a weak Pt3Hβ bond on Pt(111) being responsible for the ease of dehydrogenation on this surface. This bond is notably weaker on the surface alloys, which partially explains the absence of dehydrogenation on Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111). The decrease in adsorption energy on the surface alloys, attributed to the altered electronic structure and resulting from a ligand effect, is comparable to the behavior of ethene and unsaturated aldehydes on the same surfaces, providing insights into their chemisorption properties.

实验技术，包括温度程序脱附（TPD）、紫外光电子能谱（UPS）和高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS），以及理论密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，用于研究环戊烯在Pt(111)和有序的Pt3Sn/Pt(111)和Pt2Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附。所有表面上的吸附都表现为二σ键结合机制，在Pt(111)表面上形成的弱Pt3Hβ键是导致该表面上容易脱氢化的原因。这种键在表面合金上明显较弱，部分解释了Pt3Sn/Pt(111)和Pt2Sn/Pt(111)表面上的脱氢化缺失。吸附能降低在表面合金上的降低，归因于电子结构的变化和由此产生的配体效应，与相同表面上的乙烷和不饱和醛的性质相似，提供了这些物质吸附性质的见解。
