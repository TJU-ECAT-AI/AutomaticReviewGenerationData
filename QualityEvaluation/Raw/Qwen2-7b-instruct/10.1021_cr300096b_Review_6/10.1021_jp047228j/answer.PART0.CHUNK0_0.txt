The adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and the two ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was studied using multiple experimental techniques including high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and temperature-programmed desorption. Theoretical calculations were also performed using ab initio density functional theory (DFT). The bonding of cyclopentene on all surfaces was found to be di-σ, but the bond energy and thermal stability varied significantly. On Pt(111), cyclopentene desorbs at 280 K, with further dehydrogenation occurring at 450 K. In contrast, the desorption temperatures on the surface alloys were reduced to 244 K (Pt3Sn) and 198 K (Pt2Sn), with no dehydrogenation observed.

对Pt(111)及其相应的Pt3Sn/Pt(111)和Pt2Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上环戊烯的吸附进行了研究，使用了多种实验技术，包括高分辨率电子能量损失光谱、紫外光电离光谱、低能电子衍射和温度程序脱附。还进行了基于第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）的理论计算。所有表面上的环戊烯吸附都被发现是通过双σ键形成的，但键能和热稳定性存在显著差异。在Pt(111)上，环戊烯在280 K时完整脱附，进一步脱氢发生在450 K时。相比之下，表面合金上的脱附温度分别降低至244 K（Pt3Sn）和198 K（Pt2Sn），且未观察到脱氢化。
