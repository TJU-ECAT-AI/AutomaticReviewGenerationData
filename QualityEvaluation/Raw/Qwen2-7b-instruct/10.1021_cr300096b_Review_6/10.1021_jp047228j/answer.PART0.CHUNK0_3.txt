<p>The adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and on the ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was investigated experimentally by TPD, UPS, and HREELS as well as theoretically by ab initio DFT calculations.</p>
<p>On Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys, cyclopentene is di-σ-bonded occupying bridge sites.</p>
<p>A detailed analysis of the adsorption geometry based on the DFT calculation has been presented. It shows in the case of cyclopentene on Pt(111) the formation of a weak Pt3Hβ bond, which is responsible for the facile dehydrogenation on this surface. This bond is much weaker on both surface alloys, which partially explains the absence of dehydrogenation on Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111).</p>
<p>The decrease of the adsorption energy of cyclopentene on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111) can be attributed to the changed electronic structure of the surface alloys and is, therefore, due to a ligand effect.</p>

The adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and on the ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was studied using experimental techniques such as TPD, UPS, and HREELS, as well as theoretical methods including ab initio DFT calculations. The cyclopentene molecules were found to form a di-σ bond on all surfaces, occupying bridge sites. On Pt(111), a weak Pt3Hβ bond was identified, which facilitates the dehydrogenation process. However, this bond is significantly weaker on the surface alloys, explaining the absence of dehydrogenation. The decrease in adsorption energy on the surface alloys is attributed to a ligand effect due to the altered electronic structure of these alloys.

对铂(111)和有序的Pt3Sn/Pt(111)和Pt2Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上环戊烯的吸附进行了研究，使用了实验技术如TPD、UPS和HREELS，以及理论方法包括第一性原理DFT计算。环戊烯分子在所有表面上形成di-σ键，占据桥接位置。在铂(111)上，发现了弱的Pt3Hβ键，这促进了脱氢过程。然而，在合金表面，这种键明显较弱，解释了脱氢的缺失。吸附能的减少归因于表面合金中电子结构的变化，这是由于所谓的配体效应。
