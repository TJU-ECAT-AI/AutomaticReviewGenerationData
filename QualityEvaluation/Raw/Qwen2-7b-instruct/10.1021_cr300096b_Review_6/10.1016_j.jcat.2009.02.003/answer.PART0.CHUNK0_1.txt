[1] "In this study, tin and gallium promoted Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared by reductive deposition precipitation (RDP, i.e. deposition under hydrogen atmosphere) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI)."
[2] "EXAFS, TEM-EDX and XPS studies showed that reductive deposition precipitation resulted in a close contact of tin with platinum."
[3] "These bimetallic catalysts displayed an improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst and a bimetallic catalyst prepared by impregnation in which such a close interaction was absent."
[4] "The general applicability of reductive deposition precipitation as synthesis technique was demonstrated using tin and gallium as promoters."

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers are compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. This comparison helps understand the interaction and arrangement of atoms within the bimetallic system, providing insights into the mechanism of oxygen-induced surface segregation and its impact on the system's properties.
