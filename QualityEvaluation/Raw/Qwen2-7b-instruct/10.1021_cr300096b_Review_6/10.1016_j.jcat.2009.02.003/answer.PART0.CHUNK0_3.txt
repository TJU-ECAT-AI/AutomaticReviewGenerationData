Catalysts based on platinumtin and platinumgallium in close contact for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde Abstract Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation. Detailed EXAFS, TEM-EDX and XPS studies showed that reductive deposition precipitation resulted in a close contact of tin with platinum. These bimetallic catalysts displayed an improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst and a bimetallic catalyst prepared by impregnation in which such a close interaction was absent. The general applicability of reductive deposition precipitation as synthesis technique was demonstrated using tin and gallium as promoters.
Graphical abstract Platinumtin catalysts were prepared via (A) impregnation and (B) reductive deposition precipitation. Via (A), a PtSn interaction was absent while via (B) close interaction was observed, thereby enhancing catalytic selectivity.

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). These techniques measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which can be compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions for these systems.
