[C1] "In this study, tin and gallium promoted Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared by reductive deposition precipitation (RDP, i.e. deposition under hydrogen atmosphere) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI)."
[C2] "TEM-EDX, XPS and EXAFS showed that RDP synthesis resulted in a close contact between promoter and platinum."
[C3] "Catalysts which displayed a close and significant contact between platinum and promoter were more selective in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the samples in which such an interaction is not present."
[C4] "For activity such a clear conclusion could not be drawn since activity is mainly influenced by the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration."

1. The tin and gallium promoted Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared through reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI).
2. Experimental techniques like TEM-EDX, XPS, and EXAFS demonstrated that RDP synthesis led to a close interaction between the promoter and platinum.
3. Catalysts showing a close and significant interaction between platinum and promoter exhibited enhanced selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol compared to catalysts without such an interaction.
4. The impact of activity could not be clearly determined due to its dependence on various reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration.

1. 使用RDP和IWI方法制备了含锡和镓的Pt/CNF催化剂。
2. TEM-EDX、XPS和EXAFS实验表明，RDP合成导致了促进剂与铂之间的紧密接触。
3. 显示出紧密且显著的铂和促进剂之间相互作用的催化剂在氢化肉桂醛为肉桂醇的反应中表现出了增强的选择性，与没有这种相互作用的样本相比。
4. 活性的影响无法明确确定，因为它主要取决于各种反应条件，如压力和反应物浓度。
