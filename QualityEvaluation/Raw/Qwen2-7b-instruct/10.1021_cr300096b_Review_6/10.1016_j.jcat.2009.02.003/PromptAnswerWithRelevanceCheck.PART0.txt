The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers are compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. This comparison helps understand the interaction and arrangement of atoms within the bimetallic system, providing insights into the mechanism of oxygen-induced surface segregation and its impact on the system's properties.

Experimental techniques such as TEM-EDX, XPS, and EXAFS were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The results showed that reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) synthesis led to a close contact between the promoter and platinum. However, it was not possible to draw a clear conclusion regarding the effect of this contact on activity because activity is primarily determined by reaction conditions such as pressure and reactant concentration.

Catalysts based on platinumtin and platinumgallium in close contact for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde Abstract Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation. Detailed EXAFS, TEM-EDX and XPS studies showed that reductive deposition precipitation resulted in a close contact of tin with platinum. These bimetallic catalysts displayed an improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst and a bimetallic catalyst prepared by impregnation in which such a close interaction was absent. The general applicability of reductive deposition precipitation as synthesis technique was demonstrated using tin and gallium as promoters.
Graphical abstract Platinumtin catalysts were prepared via (A) impregnation and (B) reductive deposition precipitation. Via (A), a PtSn interaction was absent while via (B) close interaction was observed, thereby enhancing catalytic selectivity.
