1. Reductive deposition precipitation was shown to be applicable for synthesizing catalysts with tin and gallium as promoters.
2. XAFS and XPS analyses confirmed tin(II) presence in RDP-synthesized catalysts and tin(IV) in IWI-synthesized catalysts.
3. Catalysts with a close platinum-promoter interaction were more selective in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol compared to those without such an interaction.
