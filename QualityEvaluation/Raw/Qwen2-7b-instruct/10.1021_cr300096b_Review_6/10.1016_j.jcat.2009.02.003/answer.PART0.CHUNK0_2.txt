[1] "In this study, tin and gallium promoted Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared by reductive deposition precipitation (RDP, i.e. deposition under hydrogen atmosphere) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI)."
[2] "TEM-EDX, XPS and EXAFS showed that RDP synthesis resulted in a close contact between promoter and platinum."
[3] "For activity such a clear conclusion could not be drawn since activity is mainly influenced by the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration."

Experimental techniques such as TEM-EDX, XPS, and EXAFS were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The results showed that reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) synthesis led to a close contact between the promoter and platinum. However, it was not possible to draw a clear conclusion regarding the effect of this contact on activity because activity is primarily determined by reaction conditions such as pressure and reactant concentration.

实验技术如透射电子显微镜-能量色散X射线分析（TEM-EDX）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）被用来验证并量化氧诱导的次表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分离。结果显示，还原沉积沉淀（RDP）合成导致了促进剂与铂之间的紧密接触。然而，无法明确得出这种接触对活性的影响，因为活性主要由反应条件如压力和反应物浓度决定。
