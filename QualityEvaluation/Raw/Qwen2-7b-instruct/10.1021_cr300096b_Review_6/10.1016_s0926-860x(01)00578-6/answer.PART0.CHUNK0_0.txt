3.1. Catalyst preparation
The bimetallic catalysts prepared are shown in Table 1 . The progress of the reaction of the ferrocene solution with the monometallic catalysts, was followed by monitoring evolution of the reaction products using GC analysis of the gas phase. Cyclopentane was observed after a short induction period, rising rapidly to a maximum after about 1 h, and then decreasing until, after 24 h, only small quantities were observed, indicating that at 298 K the reaction had neared completion. A similar initial burst in the reaction activity has been reported previously for the deposition of tin on Pt/C [8] and ruthenium on Platinum Black [11] using SOMC and was attributed to a proportion of the active sites being more active than the rest and reacting quickly during the initial stages of the preparation [11] .
3.2. Characterisation
3.2.1. Chemisorption and TEM
The chemisorption results for the bimetallic catalysts are also shown in Table 1 . Inspection of the results indicates a decrease in the volume of hydrogen adsorbed by the bimetallic catalysts compared to the parent monometallic catalysts. Under our experimental conditions no hydrogen chemisorption was observed for iron supported on alumina, and assuming that each component retains its bulk properties, the hydrogen uptake by the bimetallic catalysts was attributed solely to the noble metal.
3.2.2. EDX analysis
The EDX analysis was performed by reducing the size of the electron beam to focus on areas occupied by individual metal particles on the surface of the support. The EDX analysis of the area occupied by a single particle of the Pd-Fe/Al2O3 is shown in Fig. 3 . Characteristic lines for both palladium and iron are clearly visible providing evidence for the presence of iron and palladium together in the area occupied by the particle.
3.2.3. EPR
The EPR spectra of a 4 wt.% Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst with a nominal iron coverage of half a monolayer equivalent are shown in Fig. 4 after reduction and on exposure to air. This catalyst was chosen specifically to raise the palladium loading of the monometallic to enable a higher loading of iron (nominally 0.25 wt.% corresponding to half a monolayer coverage) to be added to the catalyst. Two peaks were obtained in the EPR spectra of the 4 wt.% Pd-Fe/Al2O3 at g=4.24.3 and g=2.1. The relative intensity of these peaks, shown in Table 2 , was found to change significantly on exposure of the reduced catalyst to air.

1. The ferrocene solution reacted with the monometallic catalysts, producing cyclopentane after a short induction period. This process was monitored using GC analysis, indicating that at 298 K, the reaction had nearly completed after 24 hours. The initial reaction activity was attributed to some active sites being more active than others and reacting quickly during the preparation process.

2. The chemisorption results showed a decrease in hydrogen adsorption for the bimetallic catalysts compared to the monometallic catalysts. Iron supported on alumina did not exhibit hydrogen chemisorption under the experimental conditions. The hydrogen uptake by the bimetallic catalysts was attributed to the noble metal.

3. EDX analysis confirmed the presence of iron and palladium together in the area occupied by a single particle of the Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. There was no evidence of isolated iron or iron oxides on the support.

4. The EPR spectra of the 4 wt.% Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst revealed two peaks at g=4.24.3 and g=2.1. The intensity of these peaks changed significantly upon exposure of the reduced catalyst to air. The peak at g=4.3 was assigned to Fe(III), while the peak at g=2.1 was attributed to iron in association with palladium or a PdFe alloy.

1. 在298 K下，反应在24小时后几乎完成。初始反应活性归因于一些活性位点比其他位点更活跃，并在制备过程中迅速反应。

2. 化吸结果表明，二金属催化剂的氢吸附量较单金属催化剂减少。铁支持在氧化铝上未表现出氢化吸附。二金属催化剂的氢吸附归因于贵金属。

3. EDX分析证实了钯-铁/氧化铝单个颗粒区域中铁和钯共存。没有发现孤立的铁或铁氧化物在支持表面上。

4. EPR光谱的4 wt.% Pd-Fe/氧化铝催化剂显示了两个峰在g=4.24.3和g=2.1。这些峰的强度在暴露于空气中还原催化剂后显著变化。g=4.3处的峰被归因于Fe(III)，而g=2.1处的峰被归因为与钯结合的铁或PdFe合金。
