[1] "The Pd-Fe and Pt-Fe catalysts supported on alumina were prepared by a surface organometallic route using ferrocene."
[2] "EDX analysis of Pd-Fe/Al2O3 indicated that the palladium and iron exist together on the support and EPR studies for both the iron doped palladium and platinum catalysts showed a peak at g=2.1 which can be interpreted as metallic iron possibly in interaction with the noble metal, with another at g=4.3 attributed to ferric iron."

[7] "For the monometallic catalyst this is seen to level off after 40 min on stream giving n-butane as the dominant product."

1. The Pd-Fe and Pt-Fe catalysts were synthesized using ferrocene on alumina through a surface organometallic route. The EDX analysis revealed that the iron and palladium are located together on the support, and EPR studies showed peaks at g=2.1 and g=4.3, indicating metallic iron in interaction with the noble metal and ferric iron, respectively.

2. The catalysts were thought to contain mainly palladium or platinum closely associated with iron, forming complexes such as MFe0 or metals with an overlayer of FeOx.

3. Adding iron seemed to inhibit total hydrogenation, particularly of 1-butene.

4. For the iron-doped Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, the decrease in n-butane production was more pronounced, with no n-butane detected after 20 minutes.

5. The Pt/Al2O3 catalysts showed a rapid decrease in conversion and a shift in product composition.

6. The monometallic catalyst's conversion stabilized after 40 minutes, with n-butane as the primary product.

7. For the iron-doped catalyst, a significant drop in n-butane occurred after 20 minutes, accompanied by an increase in butene formation, especially 1-butene.

8. The increase in initial activity of the iron-doped Pt/Al2O3 catalyst suggests that despite a decrease in the number of accessible sites for hydrogen adsorption, the activity of these sites has increased.

1. 使用铁络合物和铝氧化物通过表面有机金属途径合成Pd-Fe和Pt-Fe催化剂。EDX分析表明铁和钯位于支持物上，EPR研究显示g=2.1和g=4.3处的峰值，表示与贵金属相互作用的金属铁以及三价铁。

2. 催化剂主要由钯或铂与铁紧密结合形成，可能形成MFe0或金属与FeOx层覆盖的复合物。

3. 添加铁似乎抑制了总氢化反应，特别是对1-丁烯的氢化。

4. 对于铁掺杂的Pd/Al2O3催化剂，n-丁烷的减少更为显著，在20分钟后检测不到n-丁烷。

5. Pt/Al2O3催化剂表现出快速的转化率下降和产物组成的变化。

6. 单一金属催化剂在40分钟后稳定，以n-丁烷为主要产物。

7. 对于铁掺杂的催化剂，n-丁烷在20分钟后显著减少，同时形成了大量的但烯，尤其是1-丁烯。

8. 铁掺杂的Pt/Al2O3催化剂初始活性的增加表明，尽管可用的氢吸附位点数量减少了，但这些位点的活性实际上有所提高。
