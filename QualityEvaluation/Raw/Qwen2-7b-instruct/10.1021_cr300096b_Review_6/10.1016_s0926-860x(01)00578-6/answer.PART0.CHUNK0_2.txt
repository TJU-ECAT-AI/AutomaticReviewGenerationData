The document describes the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic catalysts composed of palladium and iron, or platinum and iron, supported on alumina. The synthesis was carried out using surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) with ferrocene as the iron precursor. The catalysts were characterized using hydrogen chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The results indicate that iron is deposited selectively onto the surface of the noble metal catalysts. The EDX analysis reveals that palladium and iron coexist on the support, while the EPR spectra show the presence of metallic iron in association with the noble metal, possibly forming an alloy or interacting through an overlayer of FeOx. The addition of iron to the palladium and platinum catalysts enhances their activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene, particularly for the platinum-based catalysts, leading to a significant suppression of total hydrogenation and an increase in the selectivity for n-butenes, especially 1-butene. This enhancement is attributed to both geometric and electronic effects.

文档描述了使用表面有机金属化学（SOMC）方法，以铁基苯环化合物为铁前体，在氧化铝载体上合成钯和铁、或铂和铁双金属催化剂的过程。通过氢吸附、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、能量色散X射线光谱（EDX）和电子顺磁共振（EPR）光谱等手段对催化剂进行了表征。结果表明，铁能够选择性地沉积到贵金属催化剂的表面上。EDX分析显示，钯和铁在支撑物上共存，而EPR光谱揭示了与贵金属结合的金属态铁的存在，可能是合金的形式或通过FeOx层相互作用。向钯和铂催化剂中添加铁增强了它们的活性和1,3-丁二烯氢化反应的选择性，特别是对于铂基催化剂，导致总氢化作用显著抑制，并且1-丁烯的选择性显著提高，尤其是1-丁烯。这种增强归因于几何效应和电子效应的共同作用。
