3.1. Catalyst preparation
The bimetallic catalysts prepared are shown in Table 1 . The progress of the reaction of the ferrocene solution with the monometallic catalysts, was followed by monitoring evolution of the reaction products using GC analysis of the gas phase. Cyclopentane was observed after a short induction period, rising rapidly to a maximum after about 1 h, and then decreasing until, after 24 h, only small quantities were observed, indicating that at 298 K the reaction had neared completion. A similar initial burst in the reaction activity has been reported previously for the deposition of tin on Pt/C [8] and ruthenium on Platinum Black [11] using SOMC and was attributed to a proportion of the active sites being more active than the rest and reacting quickly during the initial stages of the preparation [11] .
3.2. Characterisation
3.2.1. Chemisorption and TEM
The chemisorption results for the bimetallic catalysts are also shown in Table 1 . Inspection of the results indicates a decrease in the volume of hydrogen adsorbed by the bimetallic catalysts compared to the parent monometallic catalysts. Under our experimental conditions no hydrogen chemisorption was observed for iron supported on alumina, and assuming that each component retains its bulk properties, the hydrogen uptake by the bimetallic catalysts was attributed solely to the noble metal.
3.2.2. EDX analysis
The EDX analysis was performed by reducing the size of the electron beam to focus on areas occupied by individual metal particles on the surface of the support. The EDX analysis of the area occupied by a single particle of the Pd-Fe/Al2O3 is shown in Fig. 3 . Characteristic lines for both palladium and iron are clearly visible providing evidence for the presence of iron and palladium together in the area occupied by the particle.
3.2.3. EPR
The EPR spectra of a 4 wt.% Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst with a nominal iron coverage of half a monolayer equivalent are shown in Fig. 4 after reduction and on exposure to air. This catalyst was chosen specifically to raise the palladium loading of the monometallic to enable a higher loading of iron (nominally 0.25 wt.% corresponding to half a monolayer coverage) to be added to the catalyst. Two peaks were obtained in the EPR spectra of the 4 wt.% Pd-Fe/Al2O3 at g=4.24.3 and g=2.1. The relative intensity of these peaks, shown in Table 2 , was found to change significantly on exposure of the reduced catalyst to air.

1. The ferrocene solution reacted with the monometallic catalysts, producing cyclopentane after a short induction period. This process was monitored using GC analysis, indicating that at 298 K, the reaction had nearly completed after 24 hours. The initial reaction activity was attributed to some active sites being more active than others and reacting quickly during the preparation process.

2. The chemisorption results showed a decrease in hydrogen adsorption for the bimetallic catalysts compared to the monometallic catalysts. Iron supported on alumina did not exhibit hydrogen chemisorption under the experimental conditions. The hydrogen uptake by the bimetallic catalysts was attributed to the noble metal.

3. EDX analysis confirmed the presence of iron and palladium together in the area occupied by a single particle of the Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. There was no evidence of isolated iron or iron oxides on the support.

4. The EPR spectra of the 4 wt.% Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst revealed two peaks at g=4.24.3 and g=2.1. The intensity of these peaks changed significantly upon exposure of the reduced catalyst to air. The peak at g=4.3 was assigned to Fe(III), while the peak at g=2.1 was attributed to iron in association with palladium or a PdFe alloy.

3.1. Catalyst preparation

A similar initial burst in the reaction activity has been reported previously for the deposition of tin on Pt/C [8] and ruthenium on Platinum Black [11] using SOMC and was attributed to a proportion of the active sites being more active than the rest and reacting quickly during the initial stages of the preparation [11] . On heating the reaction to 343353 K further evolution occurred until after about 8 h no further products were observed. In addition, the colour intensity of the orange ferrocene in heptane solution was seen to decrease over the course of the reaction, disappearing completely after heating at 353 K indicating that complete reaction of the ferrocene had occurred. A comparison of the nominal loading of the iron with that determined experimentally (given in Table 1 ) indicates that almost all of the iron introduced to the monometallic catalysts was successfully deposited.

3.2. Characterisation
3.2.1. Chemisorption and TEM
The chemisorption results for the bimetallic catalysts are also shown in Table 1 . Inspection of the results indicates a decrease in the volume of hydrogen adsorbed by the bimetallic catalysts compared to the parent monometallic catalysts. Under our experimental conditions no hydrogen chemisorption was observed for iron supported on alumina, and assuming that each component retains its bulk properties, the hydrogen uptake by the bimetallic catalysts was attributed solely to the noble metal. A control experiment performed using an identical preparative procedure but without the ferrocene resulted in no significant difference in the dispersion value of the palladium monometallic indicating that no significant sintering has occurred during the heat treatment involved in the preparation procedure. The TEM also indicated that the particle size of the palladium catalysts did not increase significantly on addition of the iron, with an average particle size of approximately 5 nm for both the monometallic and bimetallic palladium materials.

EDX analysis of areas of the support where no metal particles were observed by the microscope did indicate the presence of palladium providing evidence for particles below 2 nm. A representative TEM micrograph is shown in Fig. 1 for Pd-Fe/Al2O3, with histograms showing particle size for both Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 in Fig. 2 . The decrease in the amount of hydrogen chemisorbed observed is therefore not likely to be a consequence of a change in particle size. Assuming that the heat of adsorption and the stoichiometry of adsorption of hydrogen are not significantly influenced by the addition of the second metal, this suggests that the number of surface sites available for hydrogen chemisorption has decreased upon addition of the iron.

3.2.2. EDX analysis
The EDX analysis was performed by reducing the size of the electron beam to focus on areas occupied by individual metal particles on the surface of the support. The EDX analysis of the area occupied by a single particle of the Pd-Fe/Al2O3 is shown in Fig. 3 . Characteristic lines for both palladium and iron are clearly visible providing evidence for the presence of iron and palladium together in the area occupied by the particle. No isolated particles of the second metal were observed on the support when focussing the beam on areas of the support alone where palladium was absent. Thus, within the detection limits of the technique, the palladium and iron were found to exist together, with no evidence for the presence of isolated iron or iron oxides on the support.

3.2.3. EPR
The EPR spectra of a 4 wt.% Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst with a nominal iron coverage of half a monolayer equivalent are shown in Fig. 4 after reduction and on exposure to air. This catalyst was chosen specifically to raise the palladium loading of the monometallic to enable a higher loading of iron (nominally 0.25 wt.% corresponding to half a monolayer coverage) to be added to the catalyst. Two peaks were obtained in the EPR spectra of the 4 wt.% Pd-Fe/Al2O3 at g=4.24.3 and g=2.1. The relative intensity of these peaks, shown in Table 2 , was found to change significantly on exposure of the reduced catalyst to air. The peak at g=4.3 can be assigned to Fe(III) in a rhombic environment. The intensity of this peak did not obey Curies Law but showed a weak antiferromagnetic exchange. The signal at g=2.1 is similar to broad resonance signals quoted in the literature for Pd-Fe catalysts generally assigned to metallic iron in interaction with palladium or a PdFe alloy. The temperature variation of the intensity of the feature at g=2.1 was found to be consistent with this assignment, of ferromagnetic iron, most likely metallic iron, in the reduced sample.

1. The bimetallic catalysts were prepared by the surface organometallic route using ferrocene. The progress of the reaction was monitored using GC analysis. The reaction produced cyclopentane after 1 hour, indicating near completion. The color intensity of the ferrocene solution decreased over the course of the reaction, suggesting complete reaction. The EDX analysis showed the presence of iron and palladium together on the support.

2. The chemisorption results indicate a decrease in hydrogen adsorption on the bimetallic catalysts compared to the monometallic ones. No hydrogen chemisorption was observed for iron supported on alumina. The TEM showed that the particle size of the palladium catalysts did not increase significantly upon addition of iron. The EDX analysis confirmed that the palladium and iron were together on the support.

3. The EPR spectra showed two peaks at g=4.24.3 and g=2.1. The peak at g=4.3 corresponds to Fe(III) in a rhombic environment. The peak at g=2.1 is similar to broad resonance signals assigned to metallic iron in interaction with palladium or a PdFe alloy. The intensity of the g=2.1 peak changed significantly on exposure to air, suggesting metallic iron in the reduced sample.

The document describes the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic catalysts composed of palladium and iron, or platinum and iron, supported on alumina. The synthesis was carried out using surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) with ferrocene as the iron precursor. The catalysts were characterized using hydrogen chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The results indicate that iron is deposited selectively onto the surface of the noble metal catalysts. The EDX analysis reveals that palladium and iron coexist on the support, while the EPR spectra show the presence of metallic iron in association with the noble metal, possibly forming an alloy or interacting through an overlayer of FeOx. The addition of iron to the palladium and platinum catalysts enhances their activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene, particularly for the platinum-based catalysts, leading to a significant suppression of total hydrogenation and an increase in the selectivity for n-butenes, especially 1-butene. This enhancement is attributed to both geometric and electronic effects.
