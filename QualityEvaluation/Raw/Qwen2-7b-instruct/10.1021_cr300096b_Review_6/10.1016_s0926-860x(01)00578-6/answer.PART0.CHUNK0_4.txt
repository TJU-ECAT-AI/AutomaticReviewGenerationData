[1] "In addition, the colour intensity of the orange ferrocene in heptane solution was seen to decrease over the course of the reaction, disappearing completely after heating at 353 K indicating that complete reaction of the ferrocene had occurred."
[2] "Evolution of the cyclopentane species suggests that hydrogenolysis of the FeC5H5 bond occurs, followed by hydrogenation of the product."
[3] "That no significant reaction occurred between the ferrocene solution and alumina in the presence of hydrogen in the blank reaction suggests that ferrocene reacts selectively with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface."
[4] "A comparison of the nominal loading of the iron with that determined experimentally (given in Table 1 ) indicates that almost all of the iron introduced to the monometallic catalysts was successfully deposited."
[5] "The decrease in the amount of hydrogen chemisorbed observed is therefore not likely to be a consequence of a change in particle size."
[6] "It was not possible to obtain either electron micrographs or EDX analysis for the platinum-based catalysts due to the small particle size of these catalysts indicating that the monometallic and bimetallic platinum catalysts existed in a highly dispersed state."
[7] "The relative intensity of these peaks, shown in Table 2 , was found to change significantly on exposure of the reduced catalyst to air."
[8] "An increase in the peak at g=4.3 is seen over the same period, especially for the platinum sample indicating reoxidation of the iron."
[9] "Deactivation of the catalysts is generally attributed to butadiene oligomerisation which blocks the catalytically active sites."
[10] "That the Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts are so similar, particularly after some time on stream, suggests that the iron may deposit on some of the same sites as the carbon."

1. The color of the ferrocene solution decreased over the reaction, indicating complete reaction of the ferrocene.
2. Hydrogenolysis of the FeC5H5 bond occurs, followed by hydrogenation of the product, leading to the formation of cyclopentane.
3. Ferrocene reacted selectively with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface, not with the alumina.
4. Almost all of the iron introduced to the monometallic catalysts was successfully deposited according to the comparison of nominal and experimental loadings.
5. The decrease in hydrogen chemisorption was not due to a change in particle size.
6. The platinum-based catalysts were too dispersed to obtain electron micrographs or EDX analysis.
7. The intensity of the peaks in the EPR spectra changed significantly after exposure of the reduced catalyst to air.
8. The increase in the peak at g=4.3 for the platinum sample indicates reoxidation of the iron.
9. Butadiene oligomerization blocks the active sites of the catalysts, leading to deactivation.
10. The similarity between the Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts after some time suggests iron deposition on the same sites as carbon.
