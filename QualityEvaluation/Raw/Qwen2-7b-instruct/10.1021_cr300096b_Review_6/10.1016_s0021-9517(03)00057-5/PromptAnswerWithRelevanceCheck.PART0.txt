[1] "The influence of alloying platinum with 20 at% of Fe has been investigated. From previous experiments [31] it was concluded that acrolein adsorbs in a flat configuration on Pt (111) with both double bonds interacting with the surface, in agreement with theoretical results."
[2] "When alloying Pt with Fe, a strong segregation of Pt toward the clean surface is observed. The initial model therefore contains a pure platinum surface layer."
[3] "Compared to a pure Pt (111) crystal all adsorption energies are reduced, however, with no considerable change of relative stabilities of different adsorption modes."
[4] "Still the most stable geometries are flat configurations with both double bonds interacting with the surface."
[5] "Taking into account dipole corrections to rectify errors introduced by the periodic calculational setup and considering entropy terms at finite temperatures, a possible vertical adsorption of prenal seems to be replaced by a flat adsorption geometry already at temperatures well below catalytic conditions (room temperature)."
[6] "The huge adsorption-energy gain upon adsorption including FeO bonds can lead to a substantial change in the segregation profile as a simple quasi-chemical model has shown, rising the iron concentration in the surface."
[7] "Finally, we discussed vibrational spectra as a means to connect our results to experiments."

The influence of iron atoms in the surface on the electronic structure was discussed. A charge transfer from the electropositive iron atom to the adsorbate's oxygen atom is connected with an activation of the entire adsorbate molecule. The platinum-oxygen interaction in the case of a platinum-covered surface is only faintly observable.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of iron atoms in the surface facilitates a charge transfer from iron to the oxygen atom of the adsorbate, leading to an enhanced activation of the adsorbate molecule. In contrast, the platinum-oxygen interaction in a pure platinum surface is relatively weak.

[1] "A simple quasi-chemical model has been used to describe the segregation in the top layer of the Pt80Fe20 surface."
[2] "The model starts from a bulk-like distribution in every layer (20 at% Fe) and allows for the interchange of a surface Fe atom with a neighboring subsurface Pt atom."
[3] "The high temperature limit (complete disorder) is 95 at% Pt (one-quarter of the tetrahedra consisting of the surface atoms and the three underlying nearest neighbors has the Fe atom in the surface layer)."
[4] "In agreement with experiment, in the clean surface at room temperature the surface layer consists solely of platinum atoms."
[5] "When iron atoms are present in the surface layer, the unsaturated aldehydes bind significantly stronger to the surface than on a completely platinum-covered alloy surface."
[6] "We observe from Fig. 5 that already at an adsorption energy difference around 350 meV with/without iron atoms in the surface, the surface layer Pt concentration at 200 K changes drastically from almost 100 at% to slightly above 80 at%."

The quasi-chemical model used in the document describes the segregation of iron and platinum atoms in the top layer of the Pt80Fe20 surface. At room temperature, the surface layer is composed entirely of platinum atoms. However, when iron atoms are present in the surface layer, the unsaturated aldehydes bind significantly stronger to the surface compared to a pure platinum-covered surface. This leads to a drastic change in the surface layer's platinum concentration from nearly 100% at a 350 meV adsorption energy difference to slightly above 80% at 200K. This suggests that iron atoms diffuse to the surface upon adsorption of unsaturated aldehydes, affecting the segregation profile.

在文档中使用的准化学模型描述了Pt80Fe20表面顶层中铁和铂原子的分离。在室温下，表面层仅由铂原子组成。然而，当表面层存在铁原子时，不饱和醛类化合物与表面的结合强度显著增强，与纯铂覆盖的表面相比。这导致表面层中铂含量从接近100%的350毫电子伏特吸附能差异急剧变化到200K时略高于80%。这表明铁原子在吸附不饱和醛类化合物后扩散至表面，影响了分层分布图。

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS measures the energy loss spectrum of photoelectrons emitted from the surface, which can reveal the presence and extent of surface segregation. AES analyzes the elemental composition of the surface by measuring the energy of the secondary electrons emitted. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can be compared with DFT predictions for these systems to validate the theoretical models and understand the underlying mechanisms.

The specific details of how these techniques are applied and the comparison with DFT predictions would require a thorough analysis of the experimental data alongside the theoretical calculations. The results would typically show how well the experimental observations align with the computational simulations, providing insights into the accuracy of the theoretical models and guiding future improvements in computational methods for predicting surface segregation in bimetallic systems.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，可以验证并量化氧诱导的表面亚晶格3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分层。HREELS通过测量从表面发射的光电子的能量损失谱，揭示表面分层的存在及其程度。AES通过测量次级电子的能量来分析表面的元素组成，这些次级电子是由表面发射的。实验测量的分层动力学和激活势垒可以与DFT预测进行比较，以验证理论模型的有效性，并理解双金属系统中表面分层的内在机制。

具体来说，这些技术如何应用以及与DFT预测的比较需要对实验数据进行详尽的分析和与理论计算结果的对比。结果通常会展示实验观察与计算模拟之间的良好一致性，提供用于预测双金属系统中表面分层的理论模型的准确性的洞察，并指导未来在计算方法上的改进。

The conclusions section states: "Starting from the adsorption of the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes acrolein and prenal on pure Pt (111) surfaces published recently [13], the influence of alloying platinum with 20 at% of Fe has been investigated. From previous experiments [31] it was concluded that acrolein adsorbs in a flat configuration on Pt (111) with both double bonds interacting with the surface, in agreement with theoretical results. Assuming an η4 adsorption it is initially unclear which bond becomes hydrogenated. The experiments cited above suggest that the main reaction of acrolein is the decarbonylation to carbon monoxide and ethylene. The main theoretical result, however, is that hydrogenation toward an unsaturated alcohol is unlikely, as expressed by the comparatively low adsorption energy in configurations where only the CO bond interacts with the surface."

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems typically involve Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). These techniques provide information on the elemental composition and valence state of the surface atoms, allowing researchers to assess the degree of segregation. The kinetics of segregation and the activation barriers are often determined by monitoring the changes in surface composition over time or by studying the adsorption behavior of model compounds on the segregated surfaces.

Comparisons between DFT predictions and experimental observations typically involve analyzing the calculated segregation energies, adsorption energies, and vibrational spectra. If there are discrepancies, they could indicate limitations in the DFT methodology, the need for more sophisticated models, or the presence of additional kinetic or thermodynamic factors not captured by the theoretical calculations.

In the context of the document, the conclusions suggest that the presence of iron atoms in the surface leads to a substantial change in the adsorption energy of unsaturated aldehydes, weakening the CO double bond. This, along with the formation of strong FeO bonds, is speculated to facilitate the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes towards unsaturated alcohols. The document does not provide specific details on how experimental techniques like AES or XPS are used to measure the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface atoms or compare the results with DFT predictions.

为了验证和量化铂-3d-铂（111）双金属系统中亚表面3d原子（特别是镍和钴）的氧诱导表面再分配，通常使用原子发射光谱（AES）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）。这些技术提供了表面原子的元素组成和价态信息，允许研究人员评估再分配的程度。再分配的速率和活化势垒通常通过监测表面成分随时间的变化或研究再分配表面上模型化合物的吸附行为来确定。

比较第一性原理计算和实验观察通常涉及分析计算出的再分配能、吸附能和振动谱。如果存在差异，这可能表明第一性原理方法的局限性，需要更复杂的方法，或者存在未被理论计算捕捉到的其他动力学或热力学因素。

在文档的上下文中，结论表明铁原子的存在导致不饱和醛类的吸附能量发生显著变化，削弱了CO双键。这，加上形成强FeO键，推测有助于选择性地将不饱和醛类转化为不饱和醇。文档没有提供具体细节说明如何使用AES或XPS等实验技术测量表面亚表面原子的氧诱导再分配，或将结果与第一性原理预测进行比较。
