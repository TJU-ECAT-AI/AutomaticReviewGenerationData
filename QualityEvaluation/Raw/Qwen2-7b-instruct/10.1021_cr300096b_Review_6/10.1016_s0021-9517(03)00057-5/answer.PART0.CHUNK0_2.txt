[1] "A simple quasi-chemical model has been used to describe the segregation in the top layer of the Pt80Fe20 surface."
[2] "The model starts from a bulk-like distribution in every layer (20 at% Fe) and allows for the interchange of a surface Fe atom with a neighboring subsurface Pt atom."
[3] "The high temperature limit (complete disorder) is 95 at% Pt (one-quarter of the tetrahedra consisting of the surface atoms and the three underlying nearest neighbors has the Fe atom in the surface layer)."
[4] "In agreement with experiment, in the clean surface at room temperature the surface layer consists solely of platinum atoms."
[5] "When iron atoms are present in the surface layer, the unsaturated aldehydes bind significantly stronger to the surface than on a completely platinum-covered alloy surface."
[6] "We observe from Fig. 5 that already at an adsorption energy difference around 350 meV with/without iron atoms in the surface, the surface layer Pt concentration at 200 K changes drastically from almost 100 at% to slightly above 80 at%."

The quasi-chemical model used in the document describes the segregation of iron and platinum atoms in the top layer of the Pt80Fe20 surface. At room temperature, the surface layer is composed entirely of platinum atoms. However, when iron atoms are present in the surface layer, the unsaturated aldehydes bind significantly stronger to the surface compared to a pure platinum-covered surface. This leads to a drastic change in the surface layer's platinum concentration from nearly 100% at a 350 meV adsorption energy difference to slightly above 80% at 200K. This suggests that iron atoms diffuse to the surface upon adsorption of unsaturated aldehydes, affecting the segregation profile.

在文档中使用的准化学模型描述了Pt80Fe20表面顶层中铁和铂原子的分离。在室温下，表面层仅由铂原子组成。然而，当表面层存在铁原子时，不饱和醛类化合物与表面的结合强度显著增强，与纯铂覆盖的表面相比。这导致表面层中铂含量从接近100%的350毫电子伏特吸附能差异急剧变化到200K时略高于80%。这表明铁原子在吸附不饱和醛类化合物后扩散至表面，影响了分层分布图。
