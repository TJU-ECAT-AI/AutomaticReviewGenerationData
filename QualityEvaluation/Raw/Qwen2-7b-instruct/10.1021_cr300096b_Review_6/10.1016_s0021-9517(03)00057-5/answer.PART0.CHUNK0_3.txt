<p>The influence of alloying platinum with 20 at% of Fe has been investigated. From previous experiments [31] it was concluded that acrolein adsorbs in a flat configuration on Pt (111) with both double bonds interacting with the surface, in agreement with theoretical results.</p>
<p>When alloying Pt with Fe, a strong segregation of Pt toward the clean surface is observed. The initial model therefore contains a pure platinum surface layer.</p>
<p>Compared to a pure Pt (111) crystal all adsorption energies are reduced, however, with no considerable change of relative stabilities of different adsorption modes. The underlying electronic structure changes have been discussed elsewhere [12].</p>
<p>When iron atoms are present in the surface, adsorption geometries including OFe interactions become by far the most stable ones. The adsorption energies are strongly increased, becoming even larger than on pure Pt (111).</p>
<p>Taking into account dipole corrections to rectify errors introduced by the periodic calculational setup and considering entropy terms at finite temperatures, a possible vertical adsorption of prenal seems to be replaced by a flat adsorption geometry already at temperatures well below catalytic conditions (room temperature).</p>
<p>The huge adsorption-energy gain upon adsorption including FeO bonds can lead to a substantial change in the segregation profile as a simple quasi-chemical model has shown, rising the iron concentration in the surface.</p>

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS measures the energy loss spectrum of photoelectrons emitted from the surface, which can reveal the presence and extent of surface segregation. AES analyzes the elemental composition of the surface by measuring the energy of the secondary electrons emitted. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can be compared with DFT predictions for these systems to validate the theoretical models and understand the underlying mechanisms.

The specific details of how these techniques are applied and the comparison with DFT predictions would require a thorough analysis of the experimental data alongside the theoretical calculations. The results would typically show how well the experimental observations align with the computational simulations, providing insights into the accuracy of the theoretical models and guiding future improvements in computational methods for predicting surface segregation in bimetallic systems.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，可以验证并量化氧诱导的表面亚晶格3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分层。HREELS通过测量从表面发射的光电子的能量损失谱，揭示表面分层的存在及其程度。AES通过测量次级电子的能量来分析表面的元素组成，这些次级电子是由表面发射的。实验测量的分层动力学和激活势垒可以与DFT预测进行比较，以验证理论模型的有效性，并理解双金属系统中表面分层的内在机制。

具体来说，这些技术如何应用以及与DFT预测的比较需要对实验数据进行详尽的分析和与理论计算结果的对比。结果通常会展示实验观察与计算模拟之间的良好一致性，提供用于预测双金属系统中表面分层的理论模型的准确性的洞察，并指导未来在计算方法上的改进。
