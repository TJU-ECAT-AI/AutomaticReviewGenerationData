The influence of iron atoms in the surface on the electronic structure was discussed. A charge transfer from the electropositive iron atom to the adsorbate's oxygen atom is connected with an activation of the entire adsorbate molecule. The platinum-oxygen interaction in the case of a platinum-covered surface is only faintly observable.

The presence of iron atoms in the surface facilitates a charge transfer from iron to the oxygen atom of the adsorbate, leading to an enhanced activation of the adsorbate molecule. In contrast, the platinum-oxygen interaction in a pure platinum surface is relatively weak.
