The conclusions section states: "Starting from the adsorption of the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes acrolein and prenal on pure Pt (111) surfaces published recently [13], the influence of alloying platinum with 20 at% of Fe has been investigated. From previous experiments [31] it was concluded that acrolein adsorbs in a flat configuration on Pt (111) with both double bonds interacting with the surface, in agreement with theoretical results. Assuming an η4 adsorption it is initially unclear which bond becomes hydrogenated. The experiments cited above suggest that the main reaction of acrolein is the decarbonylation to carbon monoxide and ethylene. The main theoretical result, however, is that hydrogenation toward an unsaturated alcohol is unlikely, as expressed by the comparatively low adsorption energy in configurations where only the CO bond interacts with the surface."

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems typically involve Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). These techniques provide information on the elemental composition and valence state of the surface atoms, allowing researchers to assess the degree of segregation. The kinetics of segregation and the activation barriers are often determined by monitoring the changes in surface composition over time or by studying the adsorption behavior of model compounds on the segregated surfaces.

Comparisons between DFT predictions and experimental observations typically involve analyzing the calculated segregation energies, adsorption energies, and vibrational spectra. If there are discrepancies, they could indicate limitations in the DFT methodology, the need for more sophisticated models, or the presence of additional kinetic or thermodynamic factors not captured by the theoretical calculations.

In the context of the document, the conclusions suggest that the presence of iron atoms in the surface leads to a substantial change in the adsorption energy of unsaturated aldehydes, weakening the CO double bond. This, along with the formation of strong FeO bonds, is speculated to facilitate the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes towards unsaturated alcohols. The document does not provide specific details on how experimental techniques like AES or XPS are used to measure the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface atoms or compare the results with DFT predictions.

为了验证和量化铂-3d-铂（111）双金属系统中亚表面3d原子（特别是镍和钴）的氧诱导表面再分配，通常使用原子发射光谱（AES）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）。这些技术提供了表面原子的元素组成和价态信息，允许研究人员评估再分配的程度。再分配的速率和活化势垒通常通过监测表面成分随时间的变化或研究再分配表面上模型化合物的吸附行为来确定。

比较第一性原理计算和实验观察通常涉及分析计算出的再分配能、吸附能和振动谱。如果存在差异，这可能表明第一性原理方法的局限性，需要更复杂的方法，或者存在未被理论计算捕捉到的其他动力学或热力学因素。

在文档的上下文中，结论表明铁原子的存在导致不饱和醛类的吸附能量发生显著变化，削弱了CO双键。这，加上形成强FeO键，推测有助于选择性地将不饱和醛类转化为不饱和醇。文档没有提供具体细节说明如何使用AES或XPS等实验技术测量表面亚表面原子的氧诱导再分配，或将结果与第一性原理预测进行比较。
