[1] "The influence of alloying platinum with 20 at% of Fe has been investigated. From previous experiments [31] it was concluded that acrolein adsorbs in a flat configuration on Pt (111) with both double bonds interacting with the surface, in agreement with theoretical results."
[2] "When alloying Pt with Fe, a strong segregation of Pt toward the clean surface is observed. The initial model therefore contains a pure platinum surface layer."
[3] "Compared to a pure Pt (111) crystal all adsorption energies are reduced, however, with no considerable change of relative stabilities of different adsorption modes."
[4] "Still the most stable geometries are flat configurations with both double bonds interacting with the surface."
[5] "Taking into account dipole corrections to rectify errors introduced by the periodic calculational setup and considering entropy terms at finite temperatures, a possible vertical adsorption of prenal seems to be replaced by a flat adsorption geometry already at temperatures well below catalytic conditions (room temperature)."
[6] "The huge adsorption-energy gain upon adsorption including FeO bonds can lead to a substantial change in the segregation profile as a simple quasi-chemical model has shown, rising the iron concentration in the surface."
[7] "Finally, we discussed vibrational spectra as a means to connect our results to experiments."
