1. In the step-impregnation method, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and N2H4 were dissolved in separate aqueous solutions, and then added to the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst to achieve a 1:3 atomic ratio of Pt:Ni, resulting in a 1.67% weight loading of Pt. The catalyst was dried and calcined to ensure proper dispersion of the metals.

2. For the co-impregnation method, both Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 were dissolved in water and used to synthesize a 1.67 wt% Pt1.50 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

3. Elemental analysis revealed that the reverse micelle synthesis led to a lower uptake of Pt compared to incipient wetness impregnation.

4. EXAFS measurements confirmed the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds in the catalysts, indicating successful synthesis.

5. The catalytic activity for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation was enhanced by the presence of these bimetallic bonds, demonstrating improved performance over monometallic catalysts.

1. 在分步浸渍法中，将Ni(NO3)2·6H2O和N2H4溶解在不同的水溶液中，并将其添加到Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂中以达到Pt：Ni 1:3的原子比，最终得到1.67%的Pt负载量。干燥和煅烧催化剂以确保金属的良好分散。

2. 在共浸渍法中，将Ni(NO3)2·6H2O和Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2溶解在水中，用于合成1.67 wt% Pt1.50 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂。

3. 元素分析显示，反微乳液合成导致Pt的吸收量低于浸渍法。

4. EXAFS测量证实了PtNi双金属键在催化剂中的形成，表明成功合成了催化剂。

5. 1,3-丁二烯氢化反应的催化活性因这些双金属键的存在而增强，与单金属催化剂相比表现出更好的性能。
