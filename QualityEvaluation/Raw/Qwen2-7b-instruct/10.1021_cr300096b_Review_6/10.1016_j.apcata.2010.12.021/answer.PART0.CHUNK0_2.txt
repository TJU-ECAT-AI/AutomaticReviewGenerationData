<p>Overall, our results indicate that reverse micelle synthesis combined with incipient wetness impregnation produced small, uniform nanoparticles with bimetallic bonds that enhanced hydrogenation activity.</p>
<p>The catalyst synthesized using co-impregnation showed no enhanced activity, behaving similarly to monometallic Ni.</p>
<p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the particle size distribution.</p>
<p>AAS was used to perform elemental analysis of bimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were utilized to confirm the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bond in the step-impregnated catalyst.</p>
<p>CO pulse chemisorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies of 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation in a batch reactor were performed to determine the catalytic activity.</p>

The document does not provide information about how experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor does it compare the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions for these systems.

文档没有提供关于如何使用实验技术如HREELS和AES验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中由氧引起的表面掺杂的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的信息，也没有比较测量的掺杂动力学和激活壁垒与这些系统的DFT预测。
