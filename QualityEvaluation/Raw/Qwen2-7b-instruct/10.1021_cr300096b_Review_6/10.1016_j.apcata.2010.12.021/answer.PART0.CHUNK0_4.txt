[5] "The ability to control nanoparticle size during supported catalyst synthesis has the potential to improve the understanding of activity over supported catalysts, particularly given that supported catalysts often exhibit unique activity depending on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles."
[6] "The co-impregnated 1Pt3Ni(co-M)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was also investigated using EXAFS measurements. However, there was not enough X-ray absorption signal at the Pt LIII-edge to collect sufficient data for analysis."

Experimental techniques such as TEM, AAS, EXAFS, CO pulse chemisorption, and FTIR were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. TEM characterized the particle size distribution, while AAS performed elemental analysis. EXAFS confirmed the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bond in the step-impregnated catalyst. CO pulse chemisorption and FTIR studies determined the catalytic activity. These techniques helped understand the unique activity of supported catalysts depending on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles. However, EXAFS measurements on the co-impregnated catalyst had insufficient data due to weak X-ray absorption at the Pt LIII-edge.

使用诸如透射电子显微镜（TEM）、原子吸收光谱法（AAS）、扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）、脉冲CO化学吸附和傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）等实验技术验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导表面分层的3d原子（Ni和Co）。TEM表征了粒子尺寸分布，而AAS执行了元素分析。EXAFS证实了在浸渍步骤制备的催化剂中形成的PtNi双金属键。CO脉冲化学吸附和FTIR研究确定了催化活性。这些技术帮助理解了支持催化剂的独特活性，这取决于金属纳米颗粒的形状和大小。然而，在共浸渍催化剂上的EXAFS测量由于Pt LIII边缘的弱X射线吸收而缺乏足够的数据。
