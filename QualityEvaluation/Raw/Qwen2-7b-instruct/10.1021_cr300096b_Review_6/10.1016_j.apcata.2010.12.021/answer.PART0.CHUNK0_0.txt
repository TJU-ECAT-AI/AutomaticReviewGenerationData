The experimental techniques such as TEM, AAS, EXAFS, CO pulse chemisorption, and FTIR were used to verify and quantify the properties of the bimetallic catalysts synthesized through reverse micelle synthesis. The EXAFS measurements confirmed the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bond in the step-impregnated catalyst, explaining the enhanced hydrogenation activity. In contrast, the co-impregnation method did not lead to improved catalytic activity, as it behaved similarly to monometallic Ni catalysts.

实验技术，如透射电子显微镜（TEM）、原子吸收光谱分析（AAS）、扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）、脉冲CO化学吸附和傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR），被用来验证和量化通过反乳液合成的双金属催化剂的性质。EXAFS测量确认了步进浸渍催化剂中PtNi双金属键的形成，解释了氢化活性的增强。相比之下，共浸渍方法没有带来改善的催化活性，其行为类似于单金属Ni催化剂。
