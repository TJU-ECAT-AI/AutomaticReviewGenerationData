The experimental techniques such as TEM, AAS, EXAFS, CO pulse chemisorption, and FTIR were used to verify and quantify the properties of the bimetallic catalysts synthesized through reverse micelle synthesis. The EXAFS measurements confirmed the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bond in the step-impregnated catalyst, explaining the enhanced hydrogenation activity. In contrast, the co-impregnation method did not lead to improved catalytic activity, as it behaved similarly to monometallic Ni catalysts.

实验技术，如透射电子显微镜（TEM）、原子吸收光谱分析（AAS）、扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）、脉冲CO化学吸附和傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR），被用来验证和量化通过反乳液合成的双金属催化剂的性质。EXAFS测量确认了步进浸渍催化剂中PtNi双金属键的形成，解释了氢化活性的增强。相比之下，共浸渍方法没有带来改善的催化活性，其行为类似于单金属Ni催化剂。

<p>Step-impregnation to obtain 4 grams of 1.50 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst two aqueous solutions were created: one containing 0.30 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar) metal salt and 25.56 ml DI water, the other containing 0.48 ml N2H4 and 25.32 ml DI water.</p>
<p>The amount of Pt precursor impregnated on the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was measured to achieve a 1:3 atomic ratio of Pt:Ni, corresponding to a 1.67% weight loading of Pt. Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) salt was dissolved in enough DI water to saturate the pores in γ-Al2O3. This solution was added dropwise to Ni/γ-Al2O3. The catalyst was dried in air at 373 K for 10 h and calcined at 563 K for 2 h.</p>
<p>Co-impregnation using reverse micelle synthesis was performed by dissolving both Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 metal precursors in water. To yield 1.5 g of 1.67 wt% Pt1.50 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst two aqueous solutions were created: one containing 0.11 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.05 g Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and 12.80 ml DI water, the other containing 0.24 ml N2H4 and 12.68 ml DI water.</p>
<p>Elemental analysis was performed on bimetallic catalysts to determine extent of metal uptake during reverse micelle synthesis. A catalyst synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation was used to normalize data to determine extent of metal uptake (1Pt3Ni(IW)/γ-Al2O3).</p>
<p>EXAFS measurements were performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory, on the X18B beamline to determine the nearest-neighbor coordination numbers and interatomic distances to verify the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds.</p>

1. In the step-impregnation method, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and N2H4 were dissolved in separate aqueous solutions, and then added to the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst to achieve a 1:3 atomic ratio of Pt:Ni, resulting in a 1.67% weight loading of Pt. The catalyst was dried and calcined to ensure proper dispersion of the metals.

2. For the co-impregnation method, both Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 were dissolved in water and used to synthesize a 1.67 wt% Pt1.50 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

3. Elemental analysis revealed that the reverse micelle synthesis led to a lower uptake of Pt compared to incipient wetness impregnation.

CO pulse chemisorption and FTIR studies determined the catalytic activity. These techniques helped understand the unique activity of supported catalysts depending on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles.
