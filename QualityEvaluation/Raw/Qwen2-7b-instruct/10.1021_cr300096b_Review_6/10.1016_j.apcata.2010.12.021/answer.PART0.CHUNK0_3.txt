[1] "HAADF images collected using TEM showed that nanoparticle size was small (roughly 2 nm) and uniform before supporting and after high-temperature cleaning treatments in O2 and H2."
[2] "AAS confirms that the majority of Ni is adsorbed onto the support, but the amount of Pt deposition during reverse micelle synthesis is limited."
[3] "EXAFS measurements confirmed the PtNi bimetallic bond formation in the step-impregnated catalyst, which explained enhanced activity for low-temperature 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation."

1. High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images obtained through TEM revealed that the nanoparticles had a size around 2 nm and maintained uniformity both before and after undergoing high-temperature cleaning processes in O2 and H2 gases.

2. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) demonstrated that the majority of nickel was absorbed onto the support, whereas the quantity of platinum deposited during reverse micelle synthesis was restricted.

3. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses validated the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bond within the step-impregnated catalyst, which was responsible for the increased activity in the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene.

1. 使用高角环形暗场（HAADF）成像通过透射电子显微镜（TEM）显示，纳米颗粒的大小约为2nm，并在使用氧气和氢气进行高温清洁处理前后保持均匀性。

2. 原子吸收光谱法（AAS）表明，大多数镍被吸附到支持物上，而反向微乳液合成过程中沉积的铂量有限。

3. 扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）分析证实了步骤浸渍催化剂中形成的PtNi双金属键，这是低温1,3-丁二烯氢化活性增强的原因。
