<p>The presence of Pt in the second layer leads to electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer. Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy leads to formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability relative to clean Cu(100) signalled by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution. The formate decomposition on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer follows first order decomposition kinetics and the decomposition activation energy is reduced from 119 kJ mol-1 (Cu(100)) to 110 kJ mol-1 on the CuPt underlayer alloy.</p>
<p>Thicker Pt films with Pt coverages of 1 ML up to 2.5 ML containing significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment lead to an additional downward shift in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1. This activation energy corresponds to the formate stability on a mixed CuPt bimetallic site. Thus, the surface chemistry of Pt in Cu3Pt alloys differs significantly from that of pure Pt resulting in a much increased stability for the formate intermediate.</p>

The formate stability on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy was found to be reduced compared to clean Cu(100). Adsorption of formic acid on this alloy results in the formation of a less stable formate intermediate, evidenced by a 30 K decrease in the CO2/H2 evolution temperature. The formate decomposition on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer follows first-order kinetics, and its activation energy is lower than that of pure Cu(100), specifically 110 kJ mol-1 compared to 119 kJ mol-1. When thicker Pt films, with a coverage ranging from 1 ML to 2.5 ML, are used, they contain a significant amount of Pt in their outermost layer, leading to a further decrease in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K, corresponding to an activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1. This indicates that the surface chemistry of Pt in Cu3Pt alloys is notably different from that of pure Pt, resulting in a higher stability of the formate intermediate on the Cu3Pt surface.

在Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt亚表面合金上，甲醛稳定性相较于纯净的Cu(100)有所降低。甲醛吸附在此合金上导致形成较不稳定的甲醛中间体，这由同时CO2/H2演化温度下降30 K来表示。在Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt下层中甲醛分解遵循一级分解动力学，其分解活化能比纯Cu(100)低，具体为110 kJ mol-1，而纯Cu(100)的活化能为119 kJ mol-1。当使用更厚的Pt薄膜，覆盖范围从1 ML到2.5 ML时，它们在外层包含大量Pt，在局部c(2 × 2)环境中，甲醛分解温度进一步降至406 K，对应于104 kJ mol-1的活化能。这表明Cu3Pt合金中的Pt表面化学与纯Pt有显著不同，导致甲醛中间体在Cu3Pt表面上的稳定性大大提高。
