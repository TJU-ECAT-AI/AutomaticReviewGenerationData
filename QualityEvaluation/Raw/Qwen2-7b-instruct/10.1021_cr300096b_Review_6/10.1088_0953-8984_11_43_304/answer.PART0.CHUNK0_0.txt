[1] "Room temperature deposition of Pt on Cu(100) has been studied by LEED, AES and desorption spectroscopy indicating that sub-monolayer Pt growth at 300 K leads to formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters."
[2] "In contrast to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, a high degree of crystalline perfection requires thermal activation which leads to surface Pt atoms switching to second layer sub-surface sites to form a c(2 × 2) underlayer below a copper monolayer."
[3] "The presence of Pt in the second layer leads to electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer."
[4] "Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy leads to formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability relative to clean Cu(100) signalled by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution."
[5] "The formate decomposition on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer follows first order decomposition kinetics and the decomposition activation energy is reduced from 119 kJ mol-1 (Cu(100)) to 110 kJ mol-1 on the CuPt underlayer alloy."
[6] "Thicker Pt films with Pt coverages of 1 ML up to 2.5 ML containing significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment lead to an additional downward shift in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1."

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include LEED (Low-Energy Electron Diffraction), AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy), and desorption spectroscopy. These methods allow researchers to observe the formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters during the deposition of sub-monolayer Pt on Cu(100) at room temperature. In comparison to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt system requires thermal activation for achieving a high degree of crystalline perfection, leading to surface Pt atoms switching to second layer sub-surface sites to form a c(2 × 2) underlayer. The presence of Pt in the second layer results in electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer. The stability of the formate intermediate is reduced on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt surface, evidenced by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution. The formate decomposition on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer follows first-order decomposition kinetics with a reduced activation energy compared to the clean Cu(100) surface. With thicker Pt films containing significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment, the formate decomposition temperature shifts further down to 406 K, corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1.

使用LEED（低能电子衍射）、AES（俄歇电子能谱）和脱附光谱等实验技术验证并量化氧诱导表面同位素在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）的同位素分布。这些方法允许研究人员观察在室温下Cu(100)上沉积亚单层Pt时形成的排列不规则的c(2×2)表面合金，与Pt微簇共吸附。与Cu(100)-c(2×2)-Pd系统相比，Cu(100)-c(2×2)-Pt系统需要热激活才能达到高度结晶完美，导致表面Pt原子切换到第二层亚表面位置，在铜单层下方形成c(2×2)底层。在第二层存在的Pt导致外层铜单层的电子扰动。在Cu(100)-c(2×2)-Pt表面上，形式酸吸附形成稳定性较低的中间形式酸，相对于清洁的Cu(100)表面，这通过同时CO2/H2演化向下的30K移动得以信号化。在Cu(100)-c(2×2)-CuPt底层上的形式酸分解遵循一级分解动力学，分解活化能从Cu(100)的119 kJ mol-1降低到110 kJ mol-1。在局部c(2×2)环境中，具有显著量的Pt在最外层的较厚Pt薄膜中，形式酸分解温度进一步下降至406 K，对应于分解活化能为104 kJ mol-1。
