The presence of platinum (Pt) in the second layer of the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt system causes electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer. When formic acid is adsorbed onto the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy, it forms a less stable formate intermediate compared to the clean Cu(100) surface, evidenced by a 30 K decrease in the CO2/H2 evolution temperature. On the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer, formate decomposition follows first-order kinetics, and its activation energy is reduced from 119 kJ mol-1 on the Cu(100) surface to 110 kJ mol-1 on the CuPt underlayer alloy.

在Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt系统的第二层中，铂（Pt）对最外层铜单层产生了电子扰动。当甲醛吸附到Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt亚表面合金上时，它会形成与干净的Cu(100)表面相比更不稳定的碳酸盐中间体，这通过CO2/H2演化温度降低30 K得到证实。在Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt下层上，碳酸盐分解遵循一级动力学，并且其活化能从Cu(100)表面的119 kJ mol-1降低到CuPt下层合金上的110 kJ mol-1。
