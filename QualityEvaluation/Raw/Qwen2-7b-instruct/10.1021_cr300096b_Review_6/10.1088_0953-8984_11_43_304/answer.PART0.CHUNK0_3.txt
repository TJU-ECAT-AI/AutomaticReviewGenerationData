[1] "Room temperature deposition of Pt on Cu(100) has been studied by LEED, AES and desorption spectroscopy indicating that sub-monolayer Pt growth at 300 K leads to formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters."
[2] "In contrast to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, a high degree of crystalline perfection requires thermal activation which leads to surface Pt atoms switching to second layer sub-surface sites to form a c(2 × 2) underlayer below a copper monolayer."
[3] "Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy leads to formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability relative to clean Cu(100) signalled by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution."
[4] "Thicker Pt films with Pt coverages of 1 ML up to 2.5 ML containing significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment lead to an additional downward shift in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1."
[5] "Thus, the surface chemistry of Pt in Cu3Pt alloys differs significantly from that of pure Pt resulting in a much increased stability for the formate intermediate."

Answer: 
The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include LEED (Low-Energy Electron Diffraction), AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy), and desorption spectroscopy. These methods were applied to study the sub-monolayer Pt growth at 300 K on Cu(100), leading to the formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters. In contrast to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, a high degree of crystalline perfection necessitates thermal activation, causing surface Pt atoms to switch to second layer sub-surface sites and form a c(2 × 2) underlayer beneath a copper monolayer. Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy results in the formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability compared to clean Cu(100), evidenced by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution. Thicker Pt films with significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment lead to an additional downward shift in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K, corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1. The surface chemistry of Pt in Cu3Pt alloys exhibits significant differences from that of pure Pt, resulting in increased stability for the formate intermediate.

验证并量化氧诱导表面掺杂的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co），特别是在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的实验技术包括低能电子衍射（LEED）、AES（二次电子能谱）和脱附光谱。这些方法被应用于研究300 K时在Cu(100)上的亚单层Pt生长，导致形成一个无序的c(2 × 2)表面合金与Pt微簇共吸附。与Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd系统不同，高度结晶完美需要热激活，导致表面Pt原子切换到第二层亚表面位置，并在铜单层下方形成一个c(2 × 2)底层。形酸吸附在Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt亚表面合金上导致形成比干净的Cu(100)更不稳定的形式酸中间体，这一变化由同时CO2/H2演化向下的30 K位移所表明。更厚的Pt薄膜含有大量位于局部c(2 × 2)环境中的外层Pt，导致形式酸分解温度进一步下降至406 K，对应的分解活化能为104 kJ mol-1。Pt在Cu3Pt合金中的表面化学与纯Pt显著不同，从而导致形式酸中间体的稳定性大幅增加。
