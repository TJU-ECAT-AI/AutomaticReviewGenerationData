[1] "Room temperature deposition of Pt on Cu(100) has been studied by LEED, AES and desorption spectroscopy indicating that sub-monolayer Pt growth at 300 K leads to formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters."
[2] "In contrast to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, a high degree of crystalline perfection requires thermal activation which leads to surface Pt atoms switching to second layer sub-surface sites to form a c(2 × 2) underlayer below a copper monolayer."
[3] "The presence of Pt in the second layer leads to electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer."
[4] "Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy leads to formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability relative to clean Cu(100) signalled by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution."
[5] "The formate decomposition on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer follows first order decomposition kinetics and the decomposition activation energy is reduced from 119 kJ mol-1 (Cu(100)) to 110 kJ mol-1 on the CuPt underlayer alloy."
[6] "Thicker Pt films with Pt coverages of 1 ML up to 2.5 ML containing significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment lead to an additional downward shift in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1."

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include LEED (Low-Energy Electron Diffraction), AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy), and desorption spectroscopy. These methods allow researchers to observe the formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters during the deposition of sub-monolayer Pt on Cu(100) at room temperature. In comparison to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt system requires thermal activation for achieving a high degree of crystalline perfection, leading to surface Pt atoms switching to second layer sub-surface sites to form a c(2 × 2) underlayer. The presence of Pt in the second layer results in electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer. The stability of the formate intermediate is reduced on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt surface, evidenced by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution. The formate decomposition on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer follows first-order decomposition kinetics with a reduced activation energy compared to the clean Cu(100) surface. With thicker Pt films containing significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment, the formate decomposition temperature shifts further down to 406 K, corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1.

使用LEED（低能电子衍射）、AES（俄歇电子能谱）和脱附光谱等实验技术验证并量化氧诱导表面同位素在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）的同位素分布。这些方法允许研究人员观察在室温下Cu(100)上沉积亚单层Pt时形成的排列不规则的c(2×2)表面合金，与Pt微簇共吸附。与Cu(100)-c(2×2)-Pd系统相比，Cu(100)-c(2×2)-Pt系统需要热激活才能达到高度结晶完美，导致表面Pt原子切换到第二层亚表面位置，在铜单层下方形成c(2×2)底层。在第二层存在的Pt导致外层铜单层的电子扰动。在Cu(100)-c(2×2)-Pt表面上，形式酸吸附形成稳定性较低的中间形式酸，相对于清洁的Cu(100)表面，这通过同时CO2/H2演化向下的30K移动得以信号化。在Cu(100)-c(2×2)-CuPt底层上的形式酸分解遵循一级分解动力学，分解活化能从Cu(100)的119 kJ mol-1降低到110 kJ mol-1。在局部c(2×2)环境中，具有显著量的Pt在最外层的较厚Pt薄膜中，形式酸分解温度进一步下降至406 K，对应于分解活化能为104 kJ mol-1。

The formate stability on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy was found to be reduced compared to clean Cu(100). Adsorption of formic acid on this alloy results in the formation of a less stable formate intermediate, evidenced by a 30 K decrease in the CO2/H2 evolution temperature. The formate decomposition on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer follows first-order kinetics, and its activation energy is lower than that of pure Cu(100), specifically 110 kJ mol-1 compared to 119 kJ mol-1. When thicker Pt films, with a coverage ranging from 1 ML to 2.5 ML, are used, they contain a significant amount of Pt in their outermost layer, leading to a further decrease in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K, corresponding to an activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1. This indicates that the surface chemistry of Pt in Cu3Pt alloys is notably different from that of pure Pt, resulting in a higher stability of the formate intermediate on the Cu3Pt surface.

在Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt亚表面合金上，甲醛稳定性相较于纯净的Cu(100)有所降低。甲醛吸附在此合金上导致形成较不稳定的甲醛中间体，这由同时CO2/H2演化温度下降30 K来表示。在Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt下层中甲醛分解遵循一级分解动力学，其分解活化能比纯Cu(100)低，具体为110 kJ mol-1，而纯Cu(100)的活化能为119 kJ mol-1。当使用更厚的Pt薄膜，覆盖范围从1 ML到2.5 ML时，它们在外层包含大量Pt，在局部c(2 × 2)环境中，甲醛分解温度进一步降至406 K，对应于104 kJ mol-1的活化能。这表明Cu3Pt合金中的Pt表面化学与纯Pt有显著不同，导致甲醛中间体在Cu3Pt表面上的稳定性大大提高。

The presence of platinum (Pt) in the second layer of the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt system causes electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer. When formic acid is adsorbed onto the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy, it forms a less stable formate intermediate compared to the clean Cu(100) surface, evidenced by a 30 K decrease in the CO2/H2 evolution temperature. On the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer, formate decomposition follows first-order kinetics, and its activation energy is reduced from 119 kJ mol-1 on the Cu(100) surface to 110 kJ mol-1 on the CuPt underlayer alloy.

在Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt系统的第二层中，铂（Pt）对最外层铜单层产生了电子扰动。当甲醛吸附到Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt亚表面合金上时，它会形成与干净的Cu(100)表面相比更不稳定的碳酸盐中间体，这通过CO2/H2演化温度降低30 K得到证实。在Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt下层上，碳酸盐分解遵循一级动力学，并且其活化能从Cu(100)表面的119 kJ mol-1降低到CuPt下层合金上的110 kJ mol-1。

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include LEED (Low-Energy Electron Diffraction), AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy), and desorption spectroscopy. These methods were applied to study the sub-monolayer Pt growth at 300 K on Cu(100), leading to the formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters. In contrast to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, a high degree of crystalline perfection necessitates thermal activation, causing surface Pt atoms to switch to second layer sub-surface sites and form a c(2 × 2) underlayer beneath a copper monolayer. Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy results in the formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability compared to clean Cu(100), evidenced by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution. Thicker Pt films with significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment lead to an additional downward shift in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K, corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1. The surface chemistry of Pt in Cu3Pt alloys exhibits significant differences from that of pure Pt, resulting in increased stability for the formate intermediate.

The study reveals that the introduction of Pt into the Cu(100) surface through alloying affects its chemistry. Specifically, the presence of Pt in the second layer causes electronic perturbations to the outermost copper monolayer. This leads to a reduction in the stability of formate intermediates compared to the clean Cu(100) surface, evidenced by a 30 K decrease in the CO2/H2 evolution. On the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer, the formate decomposition follows first-order kinetics with a lower activation energy (110 kJ mol-1) compared to pure Cu(100) (119 kJ mol-1). With thicker Pt films containing significant amounts of Pt in the outermost layer, the formate decomposition temperature decreases further, reaching 406 K, and the activation energy reduces to 104 kJ mol-1. These findings indicate that the surface chemistry of Pt in Cu3Pt alloys exhibits significant differences from that of pure Pt, leading to enhanced formate stability.
