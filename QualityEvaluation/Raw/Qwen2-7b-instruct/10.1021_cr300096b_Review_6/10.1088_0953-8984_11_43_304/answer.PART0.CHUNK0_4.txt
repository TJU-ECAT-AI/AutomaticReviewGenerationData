The study reveals that the introduction of Pt into the Cu(100) surface through alloying affects its chemistry. Specifically, the presence of Pt in the second layer causes electronic perturbations to the outermost copper monolayer. This leads to a reduction in the stability of formate intermediates compared to the clean Cu(100) surface, evidenced by a 30 K decrease in the CO2/H2 evolution. On the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt underlayer, the formate decomposition follows first-order kinetics with a lower activation energy (110 kJ mol-1) compared to pure Cu(100) (119 kJ mol-1). With thicker Pt films containing significant amounts of Pt in the outermost layer, the formate decomposition temperature decreases further, reaching 406 K, and the activation energy reduces to 104 kJ mol-1. These findings indicate that the surface chemistry of Pt in Cu3Pt alloys exhibits significant differences from that of pure Pt, leading to enhanced formate stability.

研究发现，通过合金化将Pt引入Cu(100)表面会影响其化学性质。具体来说，第二层中的Pt导致外层铜单层的电子扰动。这导致与干净的Cu(100)表面相比，形成了稳定性较低的碳酸氢盐中间体，CO2/H2演化下降了30 K。在Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-CuPt下层，碳酸氢盐分解遵循一级分解动力学，激活能量降低至110 kJ mol-1，而纯Cu(100)为119 kJ mol-1。对于更厚的Pt薄膜，其中在外层包含大量Pt在局部c(2 × 2)环境中，碳酸氢盐分解温度进一步降低至406 K，激活能量降至104 kJ mol-1。这些发现表明，Cu3Pt合金中Pt的表面化学与纯Pt存在显著差异，导致碳酸氢盐稳定性的显著提高。
