<p>Both alloys investigated had similar catalytic activity and selectivity.</p>
<p>An attempt was made to create oxidic tin species on the Pt(111) surface, because these species have been suggested to improve selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol product.</p>
<p>However, the oxidic species formed by heating the alloys in 5 Torr O2 for 5 min at 600 K were not stable under reaction conditions and were reduced to form a surface with low catalytic activity, probably consisting of metallic Sn rafts over the Pt(111) surface.</p>

1. The (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) and (3 × 3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloys showed comparable catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. The researchers attempted to generate oxidic tin species on the Pt(111) surface to enhance the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol product.
3. The oxidic tin species formed at 600 K in 5 Torr O2 were unstable under reaction conditions and were reduced to form a surface with low catalytic activity, likely consisting of metallic Sn rafts over the Pt(111) surface.

1. 这两种合金，即(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111)和(3 × 3)R30Sn/Pt(111)，表现出相似的催化活性和选择性。
2. 研究人员尝试在Pt(111)表面生成氧化锡物种以增强对不饱和醇产物的选择性。
3. 在600 K温度下用5 Torr O2处理后形成的氧化锡物种在反应条件下不稳定，并被还原形成一个活性较低的表面，可能由覆盖在Pt(111)表面的金属Sn筏构成。
