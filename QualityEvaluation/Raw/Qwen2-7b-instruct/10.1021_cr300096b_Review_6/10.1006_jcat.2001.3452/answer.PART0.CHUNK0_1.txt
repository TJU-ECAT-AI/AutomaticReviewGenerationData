[1] "The PtSn alloy catalysts displayed about twice the activity of the Pt(111) model catalyst, with the activity of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) about 10% higher than that for the (
3 × 
3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy."
[2] "However, the selectivity observed on all of the model catalysts was similar,with butyraldehyde formed as the main product."
[3] "We conclude that the improvement in selectivity toward formation of the unsaturated alcohol that has often been reported for PtSn catalysts versus supported pure Pt catalysts cannot be solely due to PtSn alloy formation."
[4] "The catalytic activity of the preoxidized alloys can be restored to that for the as-prepared alloys by H2 reduction at a temperature exceeding 600 K."

The literature does not provide detailed information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES being used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The provided quotes focus on the comparison of activity and selectivity of different catalysts, the role of alloy formation, and the effect of preoxidation on catalytic activity. No specific details about the methods used to measure oxygen-induced surface segregation are included.
