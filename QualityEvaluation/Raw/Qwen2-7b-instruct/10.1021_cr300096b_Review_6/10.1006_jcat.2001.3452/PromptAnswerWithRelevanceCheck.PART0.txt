[1] "Gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over Pt(111) and two ordered surface alloys, a (2×2) Sn/Pt(111) and a (3×3)R30Sn/Pt(111) structure, was studied at a temperature range from 355 to 395 K, a H2 pressure range from 5 to 40 Torr, and a HC/H2 ratio range from 1 : 100 to 1 : 800. The PtSn alloy catalysts displayed about twice the activity of the Pt(111) model catalyst, with the activity of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) about 10% higher than that for the (3 × 3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy. However, the selec- tivity observed on all of the model catalysts was similar,with butyraldehyde formed as the main product."
[2] "We concluded that the improvement in selectivity toward formation of the unsaturated alcohol that has often been reported for PtSn catalysts versus supported pure Pt catalysts cannot be solely due to PtSn alloy formation."
[3] "PtSn alloys that were preoxidized at 600 K in O2 had a lower catalytic ac- tivity than either of the PtSn surface alloys or the Pt(111) surface. We propose that this results from dealloying Sn to form the SnOx adlayer during oxidation followed by re- duction of the oxidic Sn to an inactive metallic Sn adlayer during low-temperature catalytic reaction."
[4] "The catalytic activity of the preoxidized alloys can be restored to that for the as-prepared alloys by H2 reduction at a temperature exceeding 600 K."

The PtSn alloy catalysts demonstrated approximately twice the activity compared to the Pt(111) model catalyst. Specifically, the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy showed a 10% higher activity than the (3 × 3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy. Despite these differences in activity, all catalysts exhibited similar selectivity, with butyraldehyde being the primary product formed. The authors concluded that the enhanced selectivity typically observed with PtSn catalysts over pure Pt supports could not be solely attributed to alloy formation. Additionally, they noted that preoxidized PtSn alloys showed lower catalytic activity than the unoxidized counterparts, which they attributed to the dealloying of Sn to form SnOx during oxidation, followed by the reduction of this oxidic Sn to an inactive metallic form during catalytic reactions. However, the activity of the preoxidized alloys could be restored to that of the freshly prepared ones through hydrogen reduction at temperatures exceeding 600 K.

铂锡合金催化剂显示了与铂（111）模型催化剂相比大约两倍的活性。具体而言，（2×2）锡/铂（111）合金的活性比（3×3）R30锡/铂（111）合金高约10%。尽管存在这些活性差异，所有催化剂的择优性都相似，主要产物为丁醇。作者得出结论，铂锡催化剂相对于纯铂支持物的增强择优性不能仅归因于合金形成。此外，他们发现预氧化的铂锡合金表现出较低的催化活性，这是由于氧化过程中锡的分解导致锡氧化物层形成，随后在低温催化反应中还原氧化锡为不活跃的金属层。然而，通过在超过600 K的温度下用氢气还原预氧化的合金，可以将它们的活性恢复到新鲜制备的合金状态。

The literature does not provide detailed information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES being used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The provided quotes focus on the comparison of activity and selectivity of different catalysts, the role of alloy formation, and the effect of preoxidation on catalytic activity. No specific details about the methods used to measure oxygen-induced surface segregation are included.

The study investigated the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over Pt(111) and two ordered surface alloys, a (2×2) Sn/Pt(111) and a (3×3)R30Sn/Pt(111) structure, at varying temperatures, H2 pressures, and HC/H2 ratios. The PtSn alloy catalysts demonstrated approximately twice the activity of the Pt(111) model catalyst, with the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) showing about 10% higher activity than the (3 × 3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy. Despite this, the selectivity across all model catalysts was comparable, with butyraldehyde being the primary product. The study concludes that the enhanced selectivity typically reported for PtSn catalysts compared to supported pure Pt catalysts cannot be attributed solely to the formation of PtSn alloys. Preoxidized PtSn alloys exhibited lower catalytic activity than their non-oxidized counterparts or the Pt(111) surface. The proposed mechanism for this activity loss involves the dealloying of Sn to form a SnOx adlayer during oxidation, followed by the reduction of this oxidic Sn to an inactive metallic Sn adlayer during low-temperature catalytic reactions.

研究了在不同温度、H2压力和HC/H2比下，Pt(111)和两种有序表面合金（2×2）Sn/Pt(111)和（3×3）R30Sn/Pt(111)结构上对顺丁醛的气相氢化作用。PtSn合金催化剂的活性大约是Pt(111)模型催化剂的两倍，其中（2 × 2）Sn/Pt(111)的活性比（3 × 3）R30Sn/Pt(111)合金高约10%。尽管如此，所有模型催化剂的可选择性相似，主要产物为丁醇。研究表明，通常报道的PtSn催化剂与支持的纯Pt催化剂相比，增强的可选择性不能完全归因于PtSn合金的形成。预氧化的PtSn合金的催化活性低于其未氧化的同种或Pt(111)表面。提出的机制涉及在氧化过程中Sn的分解，形成SnOx吸附层，随后在低温催化反应期间还原这种氧化Sn为不活跃的金属Sn吸附层。

[1] "The results after preoxidation of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy differ significantly from those obtained previously for freshly prepared PtSn catalysts supported on carbon black (1) in which most of the Sn and a significant amount of the Pt were oxidized."
[2] "While we found complete reduction of SnOx on our model catalysts, only 11% of the total Sn loading was reduced on the supported catalyst even after thermal treatment in hydrogen (12 h in H2 flow at 760 Torr at 623 K)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The preoxidation of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy leads to a lower catalytic activity compared to freshly prepared PtSn catalysts supported on carbon black. In the preoxidized model catalysts, SnOx species are completely reduced, whereas only 11% of the total Sn loading on the supported catalyst is reduced after thermal treatment in hydrogen. This suggests that the extent of Sn reduction differs between the model catalysts and the supported catalysts.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
预氧化的(2×2)Sn/Pt(111)合金导致其催化活性低于直接在碳黑上制备的PtSn催化剂。在预氧化模型催化剂中，SnOx物种被完全还原，而支持催化剂在氢气流中在760托和623K温度下热处理12小时后只有11%的总Sn负载被还原。这表明模型催化剂和支持催化剂之间的Sn还原程度不同。
