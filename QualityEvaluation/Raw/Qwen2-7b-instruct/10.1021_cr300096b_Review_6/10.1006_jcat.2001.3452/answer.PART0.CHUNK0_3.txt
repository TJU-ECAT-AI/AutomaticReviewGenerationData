[1] "The results after preoxidation of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy differ significantly from those obtained previously for freshly prepared PtSn catalysts supported on carbon black (1) in which most of the Sn and a significant amount of the Pt were oxidized."
[2] "While we found complete reduction of SnOx on our model catalysts, only 11% of the total Sn loading was reduced on the supported catalyst even after thermal treatment in hydrogen (12 h in H2 flow at 760 Torr at 623 K)."

The preoxidation of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy leads to a lower catalytic activity compared to freshly prepared PtSn catalysts supported on carbon black. In the preoxidized model catalysts, SnOx species are completely reduced, whereas only 11% of the total Sn loading on the supported catalyst is reduced after thermal treatment in hydrogen. This suggests that the extent of Sn reduction differs between the model catalysts and the supported catalysts.

预氧化的(2×2)Sn/Pt(111)合金导致其催化活性低于直接在碳黑上制备的PtSn催化剂。在预氧化模型催化剂中，SnOx物种被完全还原，而支持催化剂在氢气流中在760托和623K温度下热处理12小时后只有11%的总Sn负载被还原。这表明模型催化剂和支持催化剂之间的Sn还原程度不同。
