[1] "Gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over Pt(111) and two ordered surface alloys, a (2×2) Sn/Pt(111) and a (3×3)R30Sn/Pt(111) structure, was studied at a temperature range from 355 to 395 K, a H2 pressure range from 5 to 40 Torr, and a HC/H2 ratio range from 1 : 100 to 1 : 800. The PtSn alloy catalysts displayed about twice the activity of the Pt(111) model catalyst, with the activity of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) about 10% higher than that for the (3 × 3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy. However, the selec- tivity observed on all of the model catalysts was similar,with butyraldehyde formed as the main product."
[2] "We concluded that the improvement in selectivity toward formation of the unsaturated alcohol that has often been reported for PtSn catalysts versus supported pure Pt catalysts cannot be solely due to PtSn alloy formation."
[3] "PtSn alloys that were preoxidized at 600 K in O2 had a lower catalytic ac- tivity than either of the PtSn surface alloys or the Pt(111) surface. We propose that this results from dealloying Sn to form the SnOx adlayer during oxidation followed by re- duction of the oxidic Sn to an inactive metallic Sn adlayer during low-temperature catalytic reaction."
[4] "The catalytic activity of the preoxidized alloys can be restored to that for the as-prepared alloys by H2 reduction at a temperature exceeding 600 K."

The PtSn alloy catalysts demonstrated approximately twice the activity compared to the Pt(111) model catalyst. Specifically, the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy showed a 10% higher activity than the (3 × 3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy. Despite these differences in activity, all catalysts exhibited similar selectivity, with butyraldehyde being the primary product formed. The authors concluded that the enhanced selectivity typically observed with PtSn catalysts over pure Pt supports could not be solely attributed to alloy formation. Additionally, they noted that preoxidized PtSn alloys showed lower catalytic activity than the unoxidized counterparts, which they attributed to the dealloying of Sn to form SnOx during oxidation, followed by the reduction of this oxidic Sn to an inactive metallic form during catalytic reactions. However, the activity of the preoxidized alloys could be restored to that of the freshly prepared ones through hydrogen reduction at temperatures exceeding 600 K.

铂锡合金催化剂显示了与铂（111）模型催化剂相比大约两倍的活性。具体而言，（2×2）锡/铂（111）合金的活性比（3×3）R30锡/铂（111）合金高约10%。尽管存在这些活性差异，所有催化剂的择优性都相似，主要产物为丁醇。作者得出结论，铂锡催化剂相对于纯铂支持物的增强择优性不能仅归因于合金形成。此外，他们发现预氧化的铂锡合金表现出较低的催化活性，这是由于氧化过程中锡的分解导致锡氧化物层形成，随后在低温催化反应中还原氧化锡为不活跃的金属层。然而，通过在超过600 K的温度下用氢气还原预氧化的合金，可以将它们的活性恢复到新鲜制备的合金状态。
