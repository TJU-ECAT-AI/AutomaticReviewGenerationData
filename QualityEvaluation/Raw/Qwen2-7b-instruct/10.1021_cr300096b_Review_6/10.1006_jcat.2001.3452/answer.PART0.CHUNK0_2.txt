[1] "Gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over Pt(111) and two ordered surface alloys, a (2×2) Sn/Pt(111) and a (3×3)R30Sn/Pt(111) structure, was studied at a temperature range from 355 to 395 K, a H2 pressure range from 5 to 40 Torr, and a HC/H2 ratio range from 1 : 100 to 1 : 800."
[2] "The PtSn alloy catalysts displayed about twice the activity of the Pt(111) model catalyst, with the activity of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) about 10% higher than that for the (3 × 3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy."
[3] "However, the selectivity observed on all of the model catalysts was similar, with butyraldehyde formed as the main product."
[4] "We conclude that the improvement in selectivity toward formation of the unsaturated alcohol that has often been reported for PtSn catalysts versus supported pure Pt catalysts cannot be solely due to PtSn alloy formation."
[5] "PtSn alloys that were preoxidized at 600 K in O2 had a lower catalytic activity than either of the PtSn surface alloys or the Pt(111) surface."
[6] "We propose that this results from dealloying Sn to form the SnOx adlayer during oxidation followed by reduction of the oxidic Sn to an inactive metallic Sn adlayer during low-temperature catalytic reaction."

The study investigated the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over Pt(111) and two ordered surface alloys, a (2×2) Sn/Pt(111) and a (3×3)R30Sn/Pt(111) structure, at varying temperatures, H2 pressures, and HC/H2 ratios. The PtSn alloy catalysts demonstrated approximately twice the activity of the Pt(111) model catalyst, with the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) showing about 10% higher activity than the (3 × 3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy. Despite this, the selectivity across all model catalysts was comparable, with butyraldehyde being the primary product. The study concludes that the enhanced selectivity typically reported for PtSn catalysts compared to supported pure Pt catalysts cannot be attributed solely to the formation of PtSn alloys. Preoxidized PtSn alloys exhibited lower catalytic activity than their non-oxidized counterparts or the Pt(111) surface. The proposed mechanism for this activity loss involves the dealloying of Sn to form a SnOx adlayer during oxidation, followed by the reduction of this oxidic Sn to an inactive metallic Sn adlayer during low-temperature catalytic reactions.

研究了在不同温度、H2压力和HC/H2比下，Pt(111)和两种有序表面合金（2×2）Sn/Pt(111)和（3×3）R30Sn/Pt(111)结构上对顺丁醛的气相氢化作用。PtSn合金催化剂的活性大约是Pt(111)模型催化剂的两倍，其中（2 × 2）Sn/Pt(111)的活性比（3 × 3）R30Sn/Pt(111)合金高约10%。尽管如此，所有模型催化剂的可选择性相似，主要产物为丁醇。研究表明，通常报道的PtSn催化剂与支持的纯Pt催化剂相比，增强的可选择性不能完全归因于PtSn合金的形成。预氧化的PtSn合金的催化活性低于其未氧化的同种或Pt(111)表面。提出的机制涉及在氧化过程中Sn的分解，形成SnOx吸附层，随后在低温催化反应期间还原这种氧化Sn为不活跃的金属Sn吸附层。
