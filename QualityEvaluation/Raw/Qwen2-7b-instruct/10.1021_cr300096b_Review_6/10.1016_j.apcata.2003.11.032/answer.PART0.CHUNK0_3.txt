[1] "Among the most significant results, a strong inhibition of the tetralin conversion to decalin has been observed when either phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed."
[2] "Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S."
[3] "Interestingly, the inhibition by sulfur compounds strongly depended on the space velocity."
[4] "At high space velocities and low DBT conversions, the inhibition by sulfur was reversible. At low space velocities and high DBT conversions, the poisoning was irreversible."
[5] "Under those conditions of low space velocity, EXAFS analysis showed further evidence of the beneficial role of F. No PtS bonds were formed on the F-containing catalyst, contrasting with the unpromoted catalysts, on which PtS bonds were clearly observed."
[6] "The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur."
[7] "It has been proposed that the electron withdrawing ability of acidic supports can modify the metal particles, making them electron-deficient and, consequently, disfavoring the formation of metalS bonds."

1. A strong inhibition of the tetralin conversion to decalin has been observed when phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed.
2. The F-promoted catalyst showed significantly higher activity than the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm sulfur.
3. The inhibition by sulfur compounds strongly depends on the space velocity.
4. At high space velocities and low DBT conversions, the inhibition by sulfur is reversible. At low space velocities and high DBT conversions, the poisoning is irreversible.
5. Under conditions of low space velocity, EXAFS analysis revealed that no PtS bonds were formed on the F-containing catalyst, unlike on the unpromoted catalysts where clear PtS bonds were observed.
6. The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur conditions.
7. The electron withdrawing ability of acidic supports modifies metal particles, making them electron-deficient, which disfavors the formation of metalS bonds.

1. 当菲诺烷或萘存在时，观察到四氢化物向十氢化物的转化受到强烈抑制。
2. 在硫含量为1000ppm时，添加F的催化剂比未添加F的Pt-Pd催化剂显示出显著更高的活性。
3. 硫化合物的抑制作用强烈依赖于空间速度。
4. 在高空间速度和低DBT转化率下，硫的抑制是可逆的。在低空间速度和高DBT转化率下，中毒是不可逆的。
5. 在低空间速度条件下，EXAFS分析显示F含有的催化剂中没有形成PtS键，而未处理的催化剂中清晰地观察到了PtS键。
6. 添加F对在硫环境下具有积极影响。
7. 酸性支持的电子吸电子能力改变了金属颗粒，使它们的电子不足，从而阻碍了金属S键的形成。
8. 没有相关引文回答这个问题。
