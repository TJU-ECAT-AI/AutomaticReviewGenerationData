<p>The hydrogenation of tetralin, naphthalene, and phenanthrene as individual feed components and in diesel model feeds has been studied over a series of mono- and bimetallic Pt and Pd supported on γ-alumina at 300 C and 500 psig in excess of H2.</p>
<p>That is, tetralin conversion could only be achieved after essentially all the 2- and 3-ring aromatics were converted.</p>
<p>The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S.</p>
<p>No PtS bonds were formed on the F-containing catalyst, contrasting with the unpromoted catalysts, on which PtS bonds were clearly observed.</p>
<p>It is important to note that under the high space velocities used in these measurements, the conversion of the sulfur-compound DBT was low, i.e. <20%. Therefore, the concentration of H2S throughout the bed was relatively low.</p>
<p>In all cases, becomes significant only after the elimination of 3040% of PHE, while conversion of TL can only start after the PHE conversion is almost complete.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that although the FT of the F-containing Pd-Pt catalyst show very little change after reaction under sulfur, the other two were greatly affected. The fitting of the data clearly demonstrates that on the spent monometallic Pt/Al2O3 and unfluorinated Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts PtS bonds are formed, while no significant contribution of PtS bonds is apparent for the F-containing Pd-Pt catalyst.</p>

1. Site competition plays a significant role in governing the hydrogenation rates on noble metal catalysts when a combined polynuclear aromatic feed is used. For example, the conversion of tetralin to decalin can only occur when most of the higher aromatics (phenanthrene or naphthalene) have been removed. The conversion of cis-to-trans-decalin is also affected by site competition with tetralin. The sequential hydrogenation of the hydrophenanthrenes also shows the effects of site competition, with preferential reaction of the higher aromatic compounds.

2. In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalysts. The inhibition by sulfur strongly depended on the conversion of the sulfur compound. At low conversions, the inhibition by sulfur was reversible, but at high conversions, the poisoning was irreversible.

3. EXAFS analysis revealed that the PtPd alloy was disrupted and PtS bonds were formed when exposing the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversions. By contrast, when F was present on the catalyst, the PdPt alloy was not disrupted, and PtS bonds were not formed.

1. 竞争位点是控制当使用联芳核芳香族喂料时，贵金属催化剂上的氢化速率的主要现象。例如，四氢萘到十氢萘的转换只能在大多数较高芳香族（苯并菲或萘）被去除后才能实现。十氢萘到顺式-反式-十氢萘的转换也受到与四氢萘的竞争的影响。十氢萘的顺序氢化也显示出竞争位点的影响，优先反应更高芳香族化合物。

2. 在硫化合物存在的条件下，添加F的Pt-Pd催化剂比未添加F的Pt-Pd催化剂表现出更高的活性。硫的抑制作用依赖于硫化合物的转化率。在低转化率下，硫的抑制作用可逆，但在高转化率下，中毒作用不可逆。

3. EXAFS分析表明，在暴露于1000 ppm DBT的高转化率下，未添加F的Pt-Pd催化剂的PtPd合金被破坏，并形成了PtS键。相比之下，当F存在于催化剂上时，PdPt合金未被破坏，并未形成PtS键。
