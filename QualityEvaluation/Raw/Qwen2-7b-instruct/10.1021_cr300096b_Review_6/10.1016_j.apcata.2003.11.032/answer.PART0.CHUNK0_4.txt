<p>It is important to note that under the high space velocities used in these measurements, the conversion of the sulfur-compound DBT was low, i.e. <i>&lt;20%</i>. Therefore, the concentration of H2S throughout the bed was relatively low. One may expect that at higher DBT conversions, the H2S generated may irreversibly poison the catalyst by forming surface sulfides.</p>

The document does not provide specific quotes related to the question about experimental techniques like HREELS and AES verifying and quantifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor comparing the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions. 

However, regarding the question about sulfur's effect on catalytic activity, it states that the conversion of the sulfur compound DBT was low (<20%) during the measurements, resulting in a relatively low concentration of H2S throughout the bed. At higher DBT conversions, the generation of H2S might irreversibly poison the catalyst by forming surface sulfides.

文档没有提供与问题相关的具体引文，关于HREELS和AES实验技术验证并量化氧诱导表面区域化（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的子表面3d原子，以及测量的区域化动力学和激活壁垒与DFT预测进行比较。

但是，关于硫对催化活性的影响，文档提到硫化合物DBT的转化率低（<20%），导致床内H2S浓度相对较低。在更高DBT转化率的情况下，生成的H2S可能会不可逆地毒害催化剂，形成表面硫化物。
