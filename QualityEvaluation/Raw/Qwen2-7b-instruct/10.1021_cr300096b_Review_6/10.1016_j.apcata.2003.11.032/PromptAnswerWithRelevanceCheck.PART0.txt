How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "Site competition is one of the most determinant phenomena that govern the hydrogenation rates on noble metal catalysts when a combined polynuclear aromatic feed is used. For example, the conversion of tetralin to decalin can only occur when most of the higher aromatics (phenanthrene or naphthalene) have been removed."
[2] "In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst. The inhibition by sulfur strongly depended on the conversion of the sulfur compound. At low conversions, the inhibition by sulfur was reversible, but at high conversions, the poisoning was irreversible."
[3] "EXAFS analysis showed that the PtPd alloy was disrupted and PtS bonds were formed when exposing the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversions. By contrast, when F was present on the catalyst, the PdPt alloy was not disrupted and PtS bonds were not formed."

Site competition plays a crucial role in controlling the hydrogenation rates of noble metal catalysts when dealing with a mixture of polynuclear aromatic compounds. For instance, the conversion of tetralin to decalin is possible only after the majority of higher aromatic compounds such as phenanthrene or naphthalene have been transformed. The presence of sulfur compounds affects the activity of Pt-Pd catalysts, with promoted catalysts showing higher activity compared to unpromoted ones. The impact of sulfur depends on the conversion level of the sulfur compound, being reversible at low conversions and irreversible at high conversions. EXAFS analysis reveals that the disruption of the PtPd alloy and formation of PtS bonds occur when the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst is exposed to 1000 ppm of dibenzothiophene (DBT) at high conversions. However, the presence of fluorine prevents the disruption of the alloy and formation of PtS bonds under similar conditions.

位点竞争在控制贵金属催化剂处理多核芳香族化合物混合物时的氢化速率中起着决定性作用。例如，仅在大部分更高芳香族化合物（如苯并菲或萘）被转换后，四氢化物才能转化为十氢化物。硫化合物的存在影响Pt-Pd催化剂的活性，具有促进效果的催化剂显示出比未促进的催化剂更高的活性。硫的抑制取决于硫化合物的转化水平，在低转化率下可逆，在高转化率下不可逆。EXAFS分析表明，在未促进的Pt-Pd催化剂暴露于1000 ppm二苯噻吩(DBT)并在高转化率下时，会发生PtPd合金的破坏和形成PtS键。然而，在类似条件下，氟的存在可以防止合金的破坏和PtS键的形成。

Among the most significant results, a strong inhibition of the tetralin conversion to decalin has been observed when either phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed. Reversible drops in tetralin conversion of almost two orders of magnitude were observed when the 2- and 3-ring aromatics were present in the reactor, even in minute concentrations. That is, tetralin conversion could only be achieved after essentially all the 2- and 3-ring aromatics were converted.

The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S. Interestingly, the inhibition by sulfur compounds strongly depended on the space velocity. At high space velocities and low DBT conversions, the inhibition by sulfur was reversible. At low space velocities and high DBT conversions, the poisoning was irreversible.

Under the high space velocities used in these measurements, the conversion of the sulfur-compound DBT was low, i.e. <20%. Therefore, the concentration of H2S throughout the bed was relatively low. One may expect that at higher DBT conversions, the H2S generated may irreversibly poison the catalyst by forming surface sulfides.

1. The presence of phenanthrene or naphthalene in the feed significantly inhibits the tetralin conversion to decalin, causing a strong drop in conversion rates, even at low concentrations. Tetralin conversion is only possible after the majority of 2- and 3-ring aromatics are converted.

2. Fluorine (F) promotes the catalytic activity under sulfur conditions. The F-promoted catalyst exhibits significantly higher activity than the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contains 1000 ppm sulfur. The inhibitory effect of sulfur compounds depends on the space velocity. At high space velocities and low sulfur compound conversion, the inhibition is reversible. However, at low space velocities and high sulfur compound conversion, the poisoning becomes irreversible.

3. At high space velocities, the conversion of the sulfur compound DBT is low, resulting in a low concentration of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the reactor. At higher DBT conversions, the generation of H2S may lead to irreversible poisoning of the catalyst by forming surface sulfides.

1. 当芳环为二环或三环时，四氢化萘的转化对达林的抑制作用非常显著，即使在微量浓度下也会观察到转化率大幅下降。只有在大部分二环和三环芳香族化合物被转化为之后，四氢化萘的转化才有可能实现。

2. 添加氟（F）可以提高催化剂在硫存在条件下的活性。当喂料中含有1000ppm硫时，含氟催化剂的活性明显高于未添加氟的铂钯催化剂。硫化合物的抑制作用依赖于空间速度。在高空间速度和低硫化合物转化率的情况下，抑制作用是可逆的。然而，在低空间速度和高硫化合物转化率的情况下，中毒会变得不可逆。

3. 在高空间速度下，硫化合物DBT的转化率较低，导致床层中氢硫酸（H2S）的浓度相对较低。在更高的DBT转化率下，生成的H2S可能导致催化剂表面形成硫化物，从而引起不可逆的中毒。

The fitting of the data clearly demonstrates that on the spent monometallic Pt/Al2O3 and unfluorinated Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts PtS bonds are formed, while no significant contribution of PtS bonds is apparent for the F-containing Pd-Pt catalyst.</p>

1. Site competition plays a significant role in governing the hydrogenation rates on noble metal catalysts when a combined polynuclear aromatic feed is used. For example, the conversion of tetralin to decalin can only occur when most of the higher aromatics (phenanthrene or naphthalene) have been removed. The conversion of cis-to-trans-decalin is also affected by site competition with tetralin. The sequential hydrogenation of the hydrophenanthrenes also shows the effects of site competition, with preferential reaction of the higher aromatic compounds.

2. In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalysts. The inhibition by sulfur strongly depended on the conversion of the sulfur compound. At low conversions, the inhibition by sulfur was reversible, but at high conversions, the poisoning was irreversible.

3. EXAFS analysis revealed that the PtPd alloy was disrupted and PtS bonds were formed when exposing the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversions. By contrast, when F was present on the catalyst, the PdPt alloy was not disrupted, and PtS bonds were not formed.

1. 竞争位点是控制当使用联芳核芳香族喂料时，贵金属催化剂上的氢化速率的主要现象。例如，四氢萘到十氢萘的转换只能在大多数较高芳香族（苯并菲或萘）被去除后才能实现。十氢萘到顺式-反式-十氢萘的转换也受到与四氢萘的竞争的影响。十氢萘的顺序氢化也显示出竞争位点的影响，优先反应更高芳香族化合物。

2. 在硫化合物存在的条件下，添加F的Pt-Pd催化剂比未添加F的Pt-Pd催化剂表现出更高的活性。硫的抑制作用依赖于硫化合物的转化率。在低转化率下，硫的抑制作用可逆，但在高转化率下，中毒作用不可逆。

3. EXAFS分析表明，在暴露于1000 ppm DBT的高转化率下，未添加F的Pt-Pd催化剂的PtPd合金被破坏，并形成了PtS键。相比之下，当F存在于催化剂上时，PdPt合金未被破坏，并未形成PtS键。

The document does not provide specific quotes related to the question about experimental techniques like HREELS and AES verifying and quantifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor comparing the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions. 

However, regarding the question about sulfur's effect on catalytic activity, it states that the conversion of the sulfur compound DBT was low (<20%) during the measurements, resulting in a relatively low concentration of H2S throughout the bed. At higher DBT conversions, the generation of H2S might irreversibly poison the catalyst by forming surface sulfides.

文档没有提供与问题相关的具体引文，关于HREELS和AES实验技术验证并量化氧诱导表面区域化（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的子表面3d原子，以及测量的区域化动力学和激活壁垒与DFT预测进行比较。

但是，关于硫对催化活性的影响，文档提到硫化合物DBT的转化率低（<20%），导致床内H2S浓度相对较低。在更高DBT转化率的情况下，生成的H2S可能会不可逆地毒害催化剂，形成表面硫化物。
