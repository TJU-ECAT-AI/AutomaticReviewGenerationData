How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "The NiPtPt(111) bimetallic surface has a nitrogen binding energy of 130.7 kcal mol1, slightly lower than that of Ru, and is a potentially active catalyst."
[2] "The TPD experiments indicate that a NiPtPt catalyst may be more active than Ru based on a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier."
[3] "Exposure to oxygen caused the subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under conditions of both low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure."
[4] "Our results show that NHx decomposition occurs at temperatures as low as 325 K and the onset for nitrogen desorption is at 560 K. Therefore, steady-state decomposition activity should be seen at temperatures below 600 K."

The NiPtPt(111) surface, with a nitrogen binding energy of 130.7 kcal mol1, exhibits a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a significantly lower dehydrogenation barrier compared to Ru. This results in the catalyst being more active than Ru. The oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) occurs under both low pressure and atmospheric conditions. The ammonia decomposition process starts at 325 K, while nitrogen desorption commences at 560 K. Consequently, steady-state decomposition activity is observed at temperatures below 600 K.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
NiPtPt(111)表面，其氮吸附能为130.7 kcal mol1，显示出比Ru更低的氮脱附温度和显著更低的脱氢化壁垒。这使得催化剂的活性高于Ru。在低压（1×107 torr O2）和大气压下，表面Ni原子通过氧诱导的表面重构从亚表面配置转移到表面配置（NiPtPt）。氨分解过程在325 K开始，而氮脱附则在560 K开始。因此，在600 K以下的温度下观察到稳定的分解活性。

The document verifies the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems through DFT predictions and experimental observations. It demonstrates that under conditions of low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure, exposure to oxygen causes the subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt). The stability of the NiPtPt surface with nitrogen adsorbates was also predicted through DFT. The TPD experiments confirm that the NiPtPt catalyst is more active than Ru, showing a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier. The NHx decomposition occurs at temperatures as low as 325 K, and the onset for nitrogen desorption is at 560 K.

文档通过DFT预测和实验观察验证了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面同化。在低压力（1×107托尔）和大气压力下，暴露于氧气导致亚表面Ni重构为表面配置（NiPtPt）。也通过DFT预测了NiPtPt表面在氮吸附剂的存在下的稳定性。TPD实验证实，与Ru相比，NiPtPt催化剂更具有活性，显示出更低的氮脱附温度和极低的脱氢化壁垒。NHx分解在325K的温度下发生，并且氮脱附的起始温度为560K。

The document does not provide detailed information on how experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, it does mention that Menning and Chen demonstrated that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures in these systems depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate. They also showed that exposure to oxygen led to the reconstruction of the subsurface Ni to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under various pressures, suggesting a correlation between the oxygen-induced surface segregation and the stability of the bimetallic system.

文献没有提供关于如何通过HREELS和AES等实验技术验证并量化氧诱导的表面异构化，特别是Ni和Co在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面异构化的详细信息。然而，文献提到Menning和Chen已经证明了这些系统的表面和亚表面结构的相对热力学稳定性取决于吸附剂覆盖度和吸附剂的Pauling电负性。他们还表明，在不同压力（1×107托氧）和大气压下，暴露于氧气会导致亚表面Ni重构为表面配置（NiPtPt），这暗示了氧诱导表面异构化与双金属体系稳定性的相关性。
