[1] "Previous studies within our group have shown a remarkable correlation between the activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films, and supported bimetallic catalysts for reactions such as cyclohexene hydrogenation20,33,34."
[2] "This methodology for predicting active monolayer bimetallic surfaces should also be applicable to more complex chemistries, although care must be taken to choose bimetallic systems that are thermodynamically stable under reaction conditions."

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by measuring the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. The measured values compare favorably with DFT predictions for these systems, demonstrating the reliability of the computational approach in predicting the behavior of the bimetallic catalysts.
