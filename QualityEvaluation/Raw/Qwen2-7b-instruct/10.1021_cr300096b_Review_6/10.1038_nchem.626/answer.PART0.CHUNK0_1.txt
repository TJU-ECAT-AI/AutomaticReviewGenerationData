The document verifies the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems through DFT predictions and experimental observations. It demonstrates that under conditions of low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure, exposure to oxygen causes the subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt). The stability of the NiPtPt surface with nitrogen adsorbates was also predicted through DFT. The TPD experiments confirm that the NiPtPt catalyst is more active than Ru, showing a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier. The NHx decomposition occurs at temperatures as low as 325 K, and the onset for nitrogen desorption is at 560 K.

文档通过DFT预测和实验观察验证了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面同化。在低压力（1×107托尔）和大气压力下，暴露于氧气导致亚表面Ni重构为表面配置（NiPtPt）。也通过DFT预测了NiPtPt表面在氮吸附剂的存在下的稳定性。TPD实验证实，与Ru相比，NiPtPt催化剂更具有活性，显示出更低的氮脱附温度和极低的脱氢化壁垒。NHx分解在325K的温度下发生，并且氮脱附的起始温度为560K。
