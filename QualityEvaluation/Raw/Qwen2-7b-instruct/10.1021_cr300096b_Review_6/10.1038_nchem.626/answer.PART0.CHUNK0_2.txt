[1] "Menning and Chen have shown that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate9."
[2] "Exposure to oxygen caused the subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under conditions of both low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure9,31,32."

The document does not provide detailed information on how experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, it does mention that Menning and Chen demonstrated that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures in these systems depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate. They also showed that exposure to oxygen led to the reconstruction of the subsurface Ni to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under various pressures, suggesting a correlation between the oxygen-induced surface segregation and the stability of the bimetallic system.

文献没有提供关于如何通过HREELS和AES等实验技术验证并量化氧诱导的表面异构化，特别是Ni和Co在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面异构化的详细信息。然而，文献提到Menning和Chen已经证明了这些系统的表面和亚表面结构的相对热力学稳定性取决于吸附剂覆盖度和吸附剂的Pauling电负性。他们还表明，在不同压力（1×107托氧）和大气压下，暴露于氧气会导致亚表面Ni重构为表面配置（NiPtPt），这暗示了氧诱导表面异构化与双金属体系稳定性的相关性。
