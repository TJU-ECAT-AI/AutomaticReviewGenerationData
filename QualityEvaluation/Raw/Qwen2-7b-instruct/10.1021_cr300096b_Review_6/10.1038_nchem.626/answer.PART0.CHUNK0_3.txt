[1] "Encouragingly for the ammonia synthesis reaction, a bimetallic catalyst (CoMo) has been found that is more active than Ru."
[2] "This stability was predicted for the NiPtPt surface with nitrogen adsorbates."
[3] "A two-level stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber, with a typical base pressure of 4 × 1010torr, was used for the TPD experiments."
[4] "Ammonia (3 L, equal to 1 × 108 torr for 300 s, where L indicates Langmuir) was dosed onto each of the four surfaces at 350 K."
[5] "The nitrogen coverages (θN) resulting from ammonia decomposition are indicated."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by measuring the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. These measurements compare with DFT predictions for these systems, providing insights into the stability and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions.
