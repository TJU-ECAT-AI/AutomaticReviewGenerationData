[1] "The NiPtPt(111) bimetallic surface has a nitrogen binding energy of 130.7 kcal mol1, slightly lower than that of Ru, and is a potentially active catalyst."
[2] "The TPD experiments indicate that a NiPtPt catalyst may be more active than Ru based on a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier."
[3] "Exposure to oxygen caused the subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under conditions of both low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure."
[4] "Our results show that NHx decomposition occurs at temperatures as low as 325 K and the onset for nitrogen desorption is at 560 K. Therefore, steady-state decomposition activity should be seen at temperatures below 600 K."

The NiPtPt(111) surface, with a nitrogen binding energy of 130.7 kcal mol1, exhibits a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a significantly lower dehydrogenation barrier compared to Ru. This results in the catalyst being more active than Ru. The oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) occurs under both low pressure and atmospheric conditions. The ammonia decomposition process starts at 325 K, while nitrogen desorption commences at 560 K. Consequently, steady-state decomposition activity is observed at temperatures below 600 K.

NiPtPt(111)表面，其氮吸附能为130.7 kcal mol1，显示出比Ru更低的氮脱附温度和显著更低的脱氢化壁垒。这使得催化剂的活性高于Ru。在低压（1×107 torr O2）和大气压下，表面Ni原子通过氧诱导的表面重构从亚表面配置转移到表面配置（NiPtPt）。氨分解过程在325 K开始，而氮脱附则在560 K开始。因此，在600 K以下的温度下观察到稳定的分解活性。
