"Cyclohexene as a chemical probe of the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni( ) bimetallic surfaces Abstract The reactions of H2 and cyclohexene on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). Hydrogen desorbs from Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces at temperatures approximately 4050 K lower than the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. The reaction pathways of cyclohexene are also significantly modified on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were used to investigate the reactions of H2 and cyclohexene on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. The desorption of hydrogen from the bimetallic surfaces occurs at temperatures approximately 4050 K lower than the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. The reaction pathways of cyclohexene on these surfaces are also significantly altered.

"Cyclohexene decomposes to C(a) and H2 and dehydrogenates to benzene on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway is introduced. Cyclohexane is produced at 237 K on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with coverages of 0.5 ML Pt and higher. HREELS also reveal that cyclohexene bonds more weakly to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface than to Ni(1 1 1)."

On a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface, cyclohexene decomposes into C(a) and H2, and dehydrogenates to form benzene. When Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway becomes available. Cyclohexane is produced at 237 K on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with a Pt coverage of 0.5 ML or more. HREELS findings indicate that cyclohexene binds more loosely to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface compared to Ni(1 1 1).

在干净的Ni(1 1 1)表面上，环己烯分解为C(a)和H2，并脱氢生成苯。当在Ni(1 1 1)表面上添加Pt时，引入了一个低温氢化途径。在覆盖有0.5 ML或更多Pt的Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面上，环己烷在237 K时产生。HREELS结果显示，环己烯与Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面的结合力比与Ni(1 1 1)表面的结合力更弱。

"The presence of pre-adsorption of H2 on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface enhances the hydrogenation activity. The combination of HREELS and TPD show that the low-temperature hydrogenation is a result of the weakly-bonded hydrogen and cyclohexene on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

Pre-adsorption of H2 on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface boosts the hydrogenation activity. The integration of HREELS and TPD demonstrates that the low-temperature hydrogenation originates from the weakly-bound hydrogen and cyclohexene on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces.

在1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面上预吸附H2可以增强氢化活性。结合HREELS和TPD的结果表明，低温氢化是由于Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面上的弱结合氢气和环己烯导致的。
