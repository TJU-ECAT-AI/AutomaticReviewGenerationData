"Cyclohexene as a chemical probe of the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni( ) bimetallic surfaces"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This study investigates the reactions of H2 and cyclohexene on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). It is found that hydrogen desorbs from Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces at temperatures approximately 4050 K lower than the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. The reaction pathways of cyclohexene are also significantly modified on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. On Ni(1 1 1), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition to produce benzene (c-C6H6), atomic C(a) and H2(g). However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a fraction of the cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation to produce cyclohexane (c-C6H12) at 237 K.

这项研究使用温度程序脱附（TPD）和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）来调查Pt/Ni( )双金属表面的H2和环己烯反应。发现，从Pt/Ni(1 1 1)双金属表面上脱附氢气的温度大约比清洁的Ni(1 1 1)表面低4050 K。环己烯在Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面上的反应途径也发生了显著改变。在Ni(1 1 1)上，环己烯发生脱氢和分解，产生苯（c-C6H6）、原子C(a)和H2(g)。然而，在向Ni(1 1 1)表面添加Pt后，部分环己烯会发生自我氢化，产生环己烷（c-C6H12）在237 K。
