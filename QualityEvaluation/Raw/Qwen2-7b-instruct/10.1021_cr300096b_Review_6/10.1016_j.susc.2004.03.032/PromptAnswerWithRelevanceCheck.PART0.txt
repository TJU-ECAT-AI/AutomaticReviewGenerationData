How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<quotes>
<p>The desorption of hydrogen from a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface occurs in two separate peaks, at 270 and 354 K (shown in Fig. 2). When Pt is deposited on the surface at coverages as low as 0.5 ML Pt, the temperature at which hydrogen desorbs decreases to 234 K with a small shoulder appearing at 350 K. The peak temperature does not change significantly with the addition of Pt to the surface, up to 2.0 ML.</p>
<p>Fig. 4 shows the desorption of cyclohexene (82 amu), benzene (78 amu) and cyclohexane (84 amu) from a 3 L exposure of cyclohexene to Ni(1 1 1) and Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with varying Pt coverages. The Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces exhibit different reactivities from that of clean Ni(1 1 1).</p>
<p>In order to quantify the TPD peak areas, we have performed TPD and AES measurements of benzene from an inert O/Ni(1 1 1) surface, shown in Fig. 6.</p>
<p>Fig. 8 displays HREEL spectra of the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface after 3 L exposure of cyclohexene. The presence of the ν(CC) mode at 1617 cm1 and the lack of the characteristic γ(CH) mode (750 cm1) indicate that the 1 ML Pt surface is even less active than the 0.4 ML Pt surface for the low-temperature conversion of cyclohexene to benzene.</p>
<p>Fig. 9 shows the reaction of 3 L C6H10 on the 3 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface. Except for minor variations in the vibrational features, the spectroscopic development in Fig. 9 is rather similar to that observed on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface (Fig. 8 (b)).</p>
<p>Fig. 6(b) also reveals that the reversible molecular desorption of c-C6H12 occurs at a lower temperature (209 K) than that from the self-hydrogenation of c-C6H10 (237 K), suggesting that the desorption of the cyclohexane product on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) is a reaction-limited desorption process.</p>

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measurements allow for the determination of the atomic composition and distribution across the interface, while HREELS provides insights into the bonding states and surface interactions. These techniques help in understanding the kinetic parameters and activation barriers associated with the segregation processes, which can be compared with theoretical predictions from Density Functional Theory (DFT).

The quantitative analysis includes measuring the segregation kinetics, such as the rate at which atoms segregate from the bulk to the surface, and the activation barriers, which are the energy differences required for the atoms to move from the bulk to the surface or vice versa. AES can provide direct information about the atomic composition and phase of the segregated species, whereas HREELS can offer details on the electronic structure and bonding environment around the segregated atoms.

In the context of Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems, the comparison of experimental data from AES and HREELS with DFT calculations helps validate the theoretical models, refine the understanding of the interfacial chemistry, and predict the behavior of the bimetallic system under different conditions. This comprehensive approach is crucial for optimizing the properties of Pt-based catalysts and enhancing their performance in various applications.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS）和原子发射光谱（AES），用于验证和量化氧诱导表面掺杂的过渡族3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的分布。AES测量允许确定界面的原子组成和分布情况，而HREELS则提供了有关表面相互作用的见解。这些技术有助于理解掺杂过程的动力学参数和激活势垒。

定量分析包括测量掺杂动力学，例如原子从晶格到表面或反之亦然的迁移速率，以及激活势垒，这是将原子从晶格移动到表面或相反所需的能量差。AES可以直接提供关于掺杂物种的原子组成和相的信息，而HREELS则提供了关于掺杂原子周围电子结构和键合环境的详细信息。

在Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统的背景下，实验数据与密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的比较验证了理论模型的有效性，细化了界面化学的理解，并预测了在不同条件下的系统行为。这种全面的方法对于优化Pt基催化剂的性质和增强其在各种应用中的性能至关重要。

Cyclohexene as a chemical probe of the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni( ) bimetallic surfaces Abstract The reactions of H2 and cyclohexene on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS).
Hydrogen desorbs from Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces at temperatures approximately 4050 K lower than the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. The reaction pathways of cyclohexene are also significantly modified on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. On Ni(1 1 1), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition to produce benzene (c-C6H6), atomic C(a) and H2(g). HREELS results also reveal that cyclohexene (c-C6H10) is strongly bonded to the Ni(1 1 1) surface. However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface at coverages from 0.5 to 3 ML, a fraction of the cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation to produce cyclohexane (c-C6H12) at 237 K. HREELS results indicate that cyclohexene is more weakly bonded to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, with the ν(CC) stretching frequency (1638 cm1) and skeletal distortions (649 cm1) still present at 200 K. When a submonolayer coverage (4050% saturation) of hydrogen is pre-adsorbed on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces, the cyclohexene hydrogenation activity is enhanced by 10-fold, with a lower onset temperature of desorption of the cyclohexane product at 180 K.

<p>The current Pt/Ni(1 1 1) study would provide further understanding regarding the role of subsurface Ni in the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) system.</p>
<p>Deckers et al. found that Pt grows on Ni(1 1 1) in a disordered layer-by-layer method at room temperature. Annealing this surface to higher temperatures causes a NiPt surface alloy to form, with possible Pt enrichment in the surface layer and Ni enrichment in the deeper layers.</p>

1. The document does not provide direct evidence on the experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. It does, however, discuss the presence of subsurface Ni atoms on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, which may play a role in the observed catalytic activities.

2. The document mentions that Pt grows on Ni(1 1 1) in a disordered layer-by-layer method at room temperature, with possible Pt enrichment in the surface layer and Ni enrichment in the deeper layers upon annealing.

3. The weak bonding of cyclohexene to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, as revealed by HREELS, suggests that this could contribute to the observed catalytic activities, including the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene.

4. Pre-adsorption of H2 on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface enhances the hydrogenation activity, indicating the importance of weakly bonded hydrogen in the catalytic processes.
