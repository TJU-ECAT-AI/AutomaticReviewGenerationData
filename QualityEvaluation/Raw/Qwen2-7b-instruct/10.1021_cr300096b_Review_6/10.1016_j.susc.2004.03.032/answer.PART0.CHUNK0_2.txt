<p>The current Pt/Ni(1 1 1) study would provide further understanding regarding the role of subsurface Ni in the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) system.</p>
<p>Deckers et al. found that Pt grows on Ni(1 1 1) in a disordered layer-by-layer method at room temperature. Annealing this surface to higher temperatures causes a NiPt surface alloy to form, with possible Pt enrichment in the surface layer and Ni enrichment in the deeper layers.</p>
<p>Cyclohexane is produced at 237 K on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with coverages of 0.5 ML Pt and higher. HREELS also reveal that cyclohexene bonds more weakly to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface than to Ni(1 1 1).</p>
<p>In addition, the pre-adsorption of H2 on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface enhances the hydrogenation activity.</p>

1. The document does not provide direct evidence on the experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. It does, however, discuss the presence of subsurface Ni atoms on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, which may play a role in the observed catalytic activities.

2. The document mentions that Pt grows on Ni(1 1 1) in a disordered layer-by-layer method at room temperature, with possible Pt enrichment in the surface layer and Ni enrichment in the deeper layers upon annealing.

3. The weak bonding of cyclohexene to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, as revealed by HREELS, suggests that this could contribute to the observed catalytic activities, including the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene.

4. Pre-adsorption of H2 on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface enhances the hydrogenation activity, indicating the importance of weakly bonded hydrogen in the catalytic processes.

1. 文档没有直接提供用于验证和量化氧诱导表面亚晶格中（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中分布的实验技术的证据。然而，它确实讨论了Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面上存在的亚晶格Ni原子，这些可能对观察到的催化活性有影响。

2. 文档提到，在室温下，Pt在Ni(1 1 1)上以无序的层叠方法生长，随着加热温度的升高，表面合金形成，可能出现表面层的Pt富集和深层的Ni富集。

3. HREELS揭示的环己烷在Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面的较弱结合表明，这可能有助于观察到的催化作用，包括环己烯的低温氢化。

4. 在1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面上预吸附的H2增强了氢化活性，这表明在催化过程中，弱结合氢的重要性。
