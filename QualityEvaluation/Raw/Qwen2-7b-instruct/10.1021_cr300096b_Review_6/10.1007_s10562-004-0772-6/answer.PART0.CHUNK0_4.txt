[1] "Adsorbed ethyl groups are stable until 376 are they react to evolve ethane, ethylene, and H2."
[2] "The activation energy for ethyl dehydrogenation is E dehyd* 97 kJ mol, which is twice that reported on Pt(111)."
[3] "In addition, we place a lower limit of E dehyd* 97 kJ mol on the barrier to ethyl hydrogenation on this alloy."

The reactivity of ethyl groups on a Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy was studied through the synthesis of these species by reacting H atoms with adsorbed ethylene on the ( \({\sqrt 3} \times {\sqrt 3}\) ) R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Adsorbed ethyl groups remained stable until 376 degrees Celsius, at which point they reacted to produce ethane, ethylene, and H2. The activation energy for ethyl dehydrogenation was found to be 97 kJ/mol, which is twice the value reported for Pt(111). Furthermore, an upper limit of 97 kJ/mol was set for the barrier to ethyl hydrogenation on this alloy.

在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上，通过将H原子与吸附的乙烯反应来合成这些物种，研究了乙基团的反应性。吸附的乙基团直到376摄氏度才稳定，之后它们反应生成乙烷、乙烯和H2。乙基脱氢化过程的活化能为97 kJ/mol，是Pt(111)上的两倍。此外，对这个合金上的乙基加氢过程设定了97 kJ/mol的上限。
