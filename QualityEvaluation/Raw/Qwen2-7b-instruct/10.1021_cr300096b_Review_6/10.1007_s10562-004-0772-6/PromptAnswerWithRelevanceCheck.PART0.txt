If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
There are no quotes in the literature that directly address the experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor do they compare the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The stability of adsorbed ethyl groups on a ( \({\sqrt 3} \times {\sqrt 3}\) ) R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy lasts until 376 degrees, after which they undergo reactions yielding ethane, ethylene, and H2. The activation energy for the dehydrogenation of ethyl groups on this alloy is 97 kJ/mol, which is double the value reported for Pt(111).

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reactivity of ethyl groups on a Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy was studied by synthesizing ethyl intermediates through the reaction of H atoms with adsorbed ethylene on the ( \({\sqrt 3} \times {\sqrt 3}\) ) R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. These adsorbed ethyl groups remain stable until they undergo dehydrogenation to produce ethane, ethylene, and H2. The activation energy for this dehydrogenation process is reported to be 97 kJ mol, which is twice the value observed on pure Pt(111) surfaces. Furthermore, a lower limit of 97 kJ mol for the barrier to ethyl hydrogenation on this alloy has been established.

Adsorbed ethyl groups remained stable until 376 degrees Celsius, at which point they reacted to produce ethane, ethylene, and H2. The activation energy for ethyl dehydrogenation was found to be 97 kJ/mol, which is twice the value reported for Pt(111).
