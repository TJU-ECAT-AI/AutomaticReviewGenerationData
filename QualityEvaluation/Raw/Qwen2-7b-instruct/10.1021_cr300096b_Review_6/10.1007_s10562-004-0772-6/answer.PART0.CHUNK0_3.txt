[1] "Adsorbed ethyl groups are stable until 376 are they react to evolve ethane, ethylene, and H2."
[2] "The activation energy for ethyl dehydrogenation is E dehyd* 97 kJ mol, which is twice that reported on Pt(111)."
[3] "In addition, we place a lower limit of E dehyd* 97 kJ mol on the barrier to ethyl hydrogenation on this alloy."

The reactivity of ethyl groups on a Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy was studied by synthesizing ethyl intermediates through the reaction of H atoms with adsorbed ethylene on the ( \({\sqrt 3} \times {\sqrt 3}\) ) R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. These adsorbed ethyl groups remain stable until they undergo dehydrogenation to produce ethane, ethylene, and H2. The activation energy for this dehydrogenation process is reported to be 97 kJ mol, which is twice the value observed on pure Pt(111) surfaces. Furthermore, a lower limit of 97 kJ mol for the barrier to ethyl hydrogenation on this alloy has been established.

在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上，通过H原子与吸附的乙烷反应合成乙基中间体，研究了乙基团的反应性。这些吸附的乙基团在转化为产生乙烷、乙烯和H2的过程中保持稳定。乙基脱氢化过程的活化能报告为97 kJ mol，这是在纯Pt(111)表面上观察到值的两倍。此外，已经确定了该合金上乙基氢化反应的下限为97 kJ mol。
