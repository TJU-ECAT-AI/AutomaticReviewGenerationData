[1] "Adsorbed ethyl groups are stable until 376 are they react to evolve ethane, ethylene, and H2."
[2] "The activation energy for ethyl dehydrogenation is E dehyd* 97 kJ mol, which is twice that reported on Pt(111)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The stability of adsorbed ethyl groups on a ( \({\sqrt 3} \times {\sqrt 3}\) ) R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy lasts until 376 degrees, after which they undergo reactions yielding ethane, ethylene, and H2. The activation energy for the dehydrogenation of ethyl groups on this alloy is 97 kJ/mol, which is double the value reported for Pt(111).

吸附在（ \({\sqrt 3} \times {\sqrt 3}\) ）R30-Sn/Pt(111) 表面合金上的乙基团在376度时稳定，之后它们会反应生成乙烷、乙烯和H2。该合金上乙基的脱氢化激活能为97 kJ/mol，是Pt(111)报道值的两倍。
