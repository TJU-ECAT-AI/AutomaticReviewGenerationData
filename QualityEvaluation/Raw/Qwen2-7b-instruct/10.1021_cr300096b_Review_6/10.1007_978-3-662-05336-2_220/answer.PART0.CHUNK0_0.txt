<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses a reaction involving 1,4-ketones and primary amines (or ammonia) that results in the formation of pyrroles. However, it does not provide information on experimental techniques like HREELS and AES used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. Nor does it detail the comparison of measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions for these systems.

文献讨论了1,4-酮与伯胺（或氨）反应生成吡咯的反应。然而，它没有提供用于验证和量化由氧引起的表面掺杂的亚表面3d原子，特别是Ni和Co，在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的实验技术，如HREELS和AES的信息。它也没有详细描述测量的掺杂动力学和激活势垒与DFT预测的比较这些系统。
