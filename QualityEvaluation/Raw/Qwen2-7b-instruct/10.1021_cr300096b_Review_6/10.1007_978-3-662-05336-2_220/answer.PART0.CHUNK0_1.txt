Since there are no relevant quotes provided in the literature regarding experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verifying and quantifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, as well as comparing the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions, an answer cannot be given based on the information available.

由于文献中没有提供关于HREELS和AES实验技术验证和量化氧诱导表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面聚集，以及测量的聚集动力学和活化能与第一性原理预测进行比较的相关信息，因此无法基于可用信息给出答案。
