Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "The presence of an additional terminal methyl group greatly increases the selectivity toward formation of unsaturated alcohols; only a slight increase in this selectivity is induced by alloying (Auger spectra)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The additional terminal methyl group significantly enhances the selectivity for the formation of unsaturated alcohols, whereas alloying only slightly improves this selectivity according to Auger spectra analysis.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
额外的末端甲基团大大提高了不饱和醇的形成选择性，而合金化仅略微提高了这一选择性，根据阿格尔光谱分析。

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have been used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The literature indicates that alloying does not significantly affect the selectivity towards the formation of unsaturated alcohols compared to the presence of an additional terminal methyl group.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
实验技术，如HREELS和AES，被用来验证并量化氧气诱导的表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分布。文献表明，合金化对形成不饱和醇的选择性影响不大，与额外的终端甲基团的存在相比。
