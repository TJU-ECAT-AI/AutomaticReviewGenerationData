The document discusses the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride to succinic anhydride using various catalysts, with a focus on the role of the support material. It mentions that the HYAl2O3 support exhibited the highest activity and selectivity for this reaction. The document also explores the use of PtNi catalysts for the hydrogenation of maleic acid to succinic acid at 40°C with 100% conversion. It notes that the hydrogenation activity correlates with the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation. The text does not provide specific details on experimental techniques like HREELS and AES to verify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.
