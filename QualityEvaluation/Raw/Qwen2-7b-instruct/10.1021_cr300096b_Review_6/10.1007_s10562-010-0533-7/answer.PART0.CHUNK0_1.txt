[1] "Results from flow reactor studies showed that supports strongly affected the catalytic properties of different bimetallic and monometallic catalysts."
[2] "The HYAl2O3 support exhibited the highest activity and selectivity."
[3] "Adding a small amount of Pt (0.5) to the Ni (5%)/Al2O3HY catalyst that is effective for increasing the selectivity and activity."
[4] "We also found that PtNi is an efficient catalyst for the one-pot conversion of maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion at 40 C."

1. Flow reactor studies revealed that the type of support had a significant impact on the catalytic performance of both bimetallic and monometallic catalysts.
2. The HYAl2O3 support demonstrated the greatest activity and selectivity among the tested materials.
3. Incorporating a minor amount of Pt (0.5%) into the Ni (5%)/Al2O3HY catalyst enhanced its selectivity and activity.
4. PtNi catalysts proved to be highly effective for converting maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion at 40°C.
