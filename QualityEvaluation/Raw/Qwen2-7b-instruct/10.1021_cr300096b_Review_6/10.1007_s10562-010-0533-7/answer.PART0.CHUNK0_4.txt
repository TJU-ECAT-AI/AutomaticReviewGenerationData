The catalysts used in this study, 5%Ni/Al2O3HY (Al2O3/HY mass ratio 0.4), were prepared by the kneading method using γ-Al2O3, HY zeolites, and Ni2O3 (Aldrich). The 0.5 wt%Pt5 wt%Ni/Al2O3HY bimetallic catalyst was prepared using H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aldrich, 99%) and Ni2O3. All the catalysts were dried overnight at 120 C in an oven, and then calcined in air at 550 C for 3h. The 5 wt%Ni/Al2O3HY (HX, ZSM-5, Beta, USY and Al2O3) and 0.5 wt%Pt5 wt%Ni/Al2O3HY (HX, ZSM-5, Beta, USY and Al2O3) catalysts were also prepared using the same method. More details can be found in a previous study [13].
