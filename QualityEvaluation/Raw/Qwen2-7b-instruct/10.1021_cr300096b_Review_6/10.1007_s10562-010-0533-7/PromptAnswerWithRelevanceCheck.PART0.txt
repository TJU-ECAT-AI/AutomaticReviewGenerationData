<p>Compared to the other processes, hydrogenation of maleic anhydride is the most direct, environmentally benign, and economic way to produce succinic anhydride.</p>
<p>The analysis of literatures on hydrogenation of MA shows that the most papers refer to catalytic studies at temperature over 200 C by batch process, while limited attention has been devoted to flow condition at temperature under 100 C conditions.</p>
<p>We also found that PtNi is an efficient catalyst for the one-pot conversion of maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion at 40 C.</p>
<p>Using NiPt/Al2O3HY catalyst and performing the reaction, it was possible to carry out the lowest reaction temperature ever carried at 100% conversion.</p>
<p>In our previous work, we have found that the catalyst activity increased as increased Ni content.</p>
<p>As can be seen the selectivity to SA parallels the increase of conversion, starting from an initial value of 42% and reaching 83%.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the 10 wt%Ni0.5 wt%Pt/Al2O3HY was prepared by the above mentioned method.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a process of deactivation in the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride in the presence of PtNi metal catalysts is caused by the formation of H2O that would cover the active surface and prevent the adsorption of maleic anhydride.</p>
<p>In our case (see Fig. 9) more than 120 h of fast ageing (increased reaction temperature and higher WHSV) was carried out to observe only a 4% loss of activity.</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride, the reaction is to hydrogenate the C=C bond of maleic acid, accordingly H2O is not formed.</p>
<p>Time on stream (TOS) studies showed the PtNi catalyst is not very active at the beginning of the test, but after an induction period of about 4 h the conversion raises steeply to 100%.</p>
<p>No deactivation or change in product distribution was observed over 10 h TOS.</p>

The literature provides evidence that the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride to succinic anhydride and subsequently to succinic acid occurs efficiently at lower temperatures using PtNi catalysts. Specifically, the PtNi catalyst supported on Al2O3 exhibits high activity and selectivity at 40°C for the conversion of maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion. The catalyst's performance improves as Ni content increases, and it is capable of carrying out the lowest reaction temperature for maleic anhydride hydrogenation at 100% conversion. This process is more direct, environmentally friendly, and economical compared to other methods. The literature also suggests that the formation of water during the reaction might cause deactivation of the catalyst, which is mitigated by maintaining the reaction at a lower temperature and avoiding high water vapor pressure. Furthermore, the PtNi catalyst shows high stability over long periods of operation, with minimal loss of activity.

文献表明，使用PtNi催化剂，maleic酸在40°C下高效转化为succinic酸。特别是，Al2O3上支持的PtNi催化剂在40°C时表现出高活性和选择性，用于将maleic酸转化为100%转化的succinic酸。Ni含量的增加会提高催化剂的性能，并且能够实现maleic酸氢化最低反应温度下的100%转化。这一过程比其他方法更直接、更环保、更经济。文献还指出，在反应过程中水的形成可能会导致催化剂失效，通过保持较低的反应温度和避免高水分蒸气压力可以缓解这种情况。此外，PtNi催化剂在长时间运行中显示出很高的稳定性，活动性损失很小。

The catalysts used in this study, 5%Ni/Al2O3HY (Al2O3/HY mass ratio 0.4), were prepared by the kneading method using γ-Al2O3, HY zeolites, and Ni2O3 (Aldrich). The 0.5 wt%Pt5 wt%Ni/Al2O3HY bimetallic catalyst was prepared using H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aldrich, 99%) and Ni2O3. All the catalysts were dried overnight at 120 C in an oven, and then calcined in air at 550 C for 3h. The 5 wt%Ni/Al2O3HY (HX, ZSM-5, Beta, USY and Al2O3) and 0.5 wt%Pt5 wt%Ni/Al2O3HY (HX, ZSM-5, Beta, USY and Al2O3) catalysts were also prepared using the same method.
