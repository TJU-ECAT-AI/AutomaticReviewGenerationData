<p>The EXAFS data suggest that progressively larger amounts of Fe oxide-like species are formed in the PtFe/SiO2 samples with increasing Fe loading ( Table 1 ). It was previously suggested that such Fe species are capable of providing active oxygen for the oxidation of CO [3] ,[7] . Therefore, one would expect that an increase in the concentration of Fe oxide-like species would increase the catalytic activity of the resulting PtFe catalysts.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of increasing amounts of Fe oxide-like species in PtFe/SiO2 samples with higher Fe loading was hypothesized to provide active oxygen for CO oxidation, potentially enhancing the catalyst's activity. However, the experimental data did not support this hypothesis.

<p>One would assume that the increased availability of Fe in the catalyst formulation would lead to a better statistical probability for mixing with Pt, increasing the percentage of bimetallic versus monometallic interactions.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
It would be assumed that the greater availability of Fe in the catalyst formula would enhance the statistical likelihood of mixing with Pt, thereby increasing the proportion of bimetallic to monometallic interactions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<p>For example, it has been calculated that the nearest Pt atoms receive approximately 0.16 e in the d band, while the second shell Pt atoms, which are not interacting directly with Fe, receive approximately 0.24 e.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
For instance, it has been computed that the closest Pt atoms absorb roughly 0.16 electrons in the d band, whereas the second layer of Pt atoms, which are not in direct contact with Fe, absorb approximately 0.24 electrons.

<p>The addition of Fe to the catalyst formulation in the range of 0.027 to 0.055 wt.% does not affect substantially the H2 chemisorption on Pt, as the H/Pt ratios observed with such samples were similar to the value observed with monometallic Pt/SiO2.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Adding Fe within the 0.027 to 0.055 wt.% range to the catalyst formulation had a minimal impact on Pt's hydrogen chemisorption, as the H/Pt ratios of these samples were comparable to those of pure Pt/SiO2.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在0.027至0.055 wt.%范围内添加Fe到催化剂配方中对Pt的氢化学吸附影响不大，因为这些样本的H/Pt比率与纯Pt/SiO2观察到的相似。
