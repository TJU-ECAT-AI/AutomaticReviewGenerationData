[1] "The results indicate that the hydrogenation of citral takes place rapidly during the first 15 min and a 53% conversion is reached at that point."
[2] "During this period, the reaction follows first-order kinetics with respect to citral, which is consistent with previous observations."
[3] "However, at longer reaction times and, therefore, at higher conversions, an apparent decrease in the rate of citral consumption is observed in the concentration profile of Fig. 10, which is indicative of catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The conversion of citral at a fixed point in time goes through a maximum as a function of the Fe content (Fig. 11), indicating that small amounts of Fe are promoting the activity of Pt for this reaction as well."

The hydrogenation of citral starts quickly, reaching a 53% conversion in the first 15 minutes, following first-order kinetics. However, as the reaction progresses and conversions increase, the rate of citral consumption slows, suggesting catalyst deactivation. The addition of small amounts of Fe enhances the activity of Pt for the hydrogenation of citral, as evidenced by the maximum conversion of citral at varying Fe contents.

在最初的15分钟内，柠檬醛的氢化开始迅速进行，达到53%的转化率。然而，随着反应时间的延长和转化率的增加，柠檬醛消耗的速度变慢，这表明催化剂的失活。少量铁的添加可以增强铂对柠檬醛氢化的活性，这从不同铁含量下柠檬醛转化的最大值中可以看出。
