The effect of Fe on SiO2-supported Pt catalysts: Structure, chemisorptive, and catalytic properties Abstract SiO2-supported PtFe catalysts with a wide range of Pt/Fe ratios were prepared from individual H2PtCl6 and Fe(NO3)3 precursors and characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies. Treatment with H2 at 350 C leads to the formation of metal particles with average sizes in the order of 2.6 nm, some of which are bimetallic in nature. The fraction of PtFe bimetallic contributions in each sample, the nature and extent of electronic interactions between Pt and Fe, and the strength of the CO adsorption on Pt strongly depend on the Fe content. PtFe/SiO2 samples thus prepared were found to be active catalysts for various reactions taking place in both oxidative and reducing environments, including the oxidation of CO in air, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and the selective hydrogenation of citral. The results indicate that the catalytic behavior of Pt is significantly affected by the presence of Fe. The enhancement of the catalytic activity observed for the oxidation of CO in air correlates with the fraction and degree of electronic PtFe interactions and the strength of CO adsorption on Pt. Similarly, Fe in small concentrations promotes the activity of Pt for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the selective hydrogenation of citral, which can be attributed to either an electronic effect and/or the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites. The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites leads to the reduction of Fe, which can thus become active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Furthermore, it is possible that PtFe adsorption sites favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, thus promoting the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols.
Graphical abstract A family of PtFe/SiO2 samples with different Pt/Fe ratios was prepared and characterized by hydrogen chemisorption, EXAFS, FTIR and catalytic activity measurements for the oxidation of CO, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and the selective hydrogenation of citral. The fraction of PtFe bimetallic contributions in these samples, the nature and extent of electronic interactions between Pt and Fe, and the strength of the CO adsorption on Pt depend strongly on the Fe content, and in turn, affect significantly the catalytic performance of Pt.

The document discusses the effect of iron (Fe) on silica-supported platinum (SiO2-supported Pt) catalysts, focusing on the structure, chemisorptive properties, and catalytic activity. These catalysts, with varying Pt/Fe ratios, were synthesized using H2PtCl6 and Fe(NO3)3 precursors and characterized using HRTEM, FTIR, and EXAFS spectroscopies. The treatment with hydrogen at 350°C resulted in the formation of metal particles around 2.6 nm in size, with some being bimetallic. The fraction of bimetallic contributions, the nature and degree of electronic interactions between Pt and Fe, and the strength of CO adsorption on Pt were influenced by the Fe content. The catalysts were found to be active for various reactions, such as CO oxidation in air, cyclohexane dehydrogenation, and citral selective hydrogenation. The presence of Fe significantly affects the catalytic behavior of Pt, enhancing its activity in CO oxidation through interactions and CO adsorption. Small amounts of Fe promote the activity of Pt for cyclohexane dehydrogenation and citral selective hydrogenation, possibly due to electronic effects and the presence of PtFe sites. The close proximity between Pt and Fe leads to Fe reduction, enhancing cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Additionally, PtFe adsorption sites might favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, facilitating selective CO bond hydrogenation and alcohol formation.

本文探讨了铁（Fe）对硅酸盐支持的铂（SiO2支持的Pt）催化剂的影响，重点关注结构、化学吸附性质和催化活性。这些催化剂通过使用H2PtCl6和Fe(NO3)3前体以不同Pt/Fe比率合成，并利用高分辨率透射电子显微镜（HRTEM）、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）进行表征。在350°C氢处理后，形成了约2.6 nm大小的金属颗粒，其中一些是双金属。双金属贡献的比例、Pt和Fe之间性质和程度的电子相互作用以及Pt上CO吸附强度受Fe含量影响。这些催化剂被发现具有各种反应的活性，如空气中CO氧化、环己烷脱氢和citral选择性氢化。Fe的存在显著影响了Pt的催化行为，在CO氧化中通过相互作用和CO吸附增强了其活性。少量Fe促进Pt的活性用于环己烷脱氢和citral选择性氢化，可能由于电子效应和PtFe位点的存在。Pt和Fe之间的近距离导致Fe还原，增强环己烷脱氢。此外，PtFe吸附位点可能有利于α,β-不饱和醛中的di-σCO吸附模式，从而促进CO键的选择性氢化和醇的形成。
