[1] "The effect of Fe on SiO2-supported Pt catalysts: Structure, chemisorptive, and catalytic properties Abstract SiO2-supported PtFe catalysts with a wide range of Pt/Fe ratios were prepared from individual H2PtCl6 and Fe(NO3)3 precursors and characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies."
[2] "The H2 treatment at 350 C leads to the formation of metal particles with sizes in the order of 2.6 nm, of which some are bimetallic in nature and likely exhibit raft-type geometry."
[3] "The adsorption of probe molecules (i.e., CO and NO) on samples with different compositions indicates the presence of electron-rich Pt sites formed due to the electronic interactions between Pt and Fe."
[4] "The extent of electron density transfer between Fe and Pt depends on the composition and decreases with increasing content of Fe."
[5] "The FTIR results further indicate that Fe in PtFe/SiO2 samples is present in both the Feδ+ and Fe0 forms, suggesting that Ptbeing in close proximity to Fefacilitates the reduction of Fe to the metallic state."
[6] "Chemisorption results also show that both the overall hydrogen chemisorption and the strength of CO adsorption on Pt are significantly affected by the amount of Fe present."
[7] "PtFe/SiO2 samples were found to be more active than monometallic Pt/SiO2 for the oxidation of CO in air."
[8] "Similarly, Fe in small concentrations promotes the activity of Pt for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the selective hydrogenation of citral."
[9] "These promoting effects can be attributed to an electronic effect and/or the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites."
[10] "The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites leads to the reduction of Fe, which can be active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation."
[11] "Furthermore, PtFe adsorption sites could favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, thus promoting the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols."
[12] "In both cases, however, the presence of large amounts of Fe leads to eventual deactivation of Pt, most probably due to the formation of an iron oxide phase."

1. Fe affects the structure, chemisorption, and catalytic properties of SiO2-supported Pt catalysts with different Pt/Fe ratios. 
2. The H2 treatment at 350 C leads to the formation of metal particles with sizes around 2.6 nm, some of which are bimetallic and likely raft-shaped.
3. The adsorption of CO and NO on the catalysts indicates the presence of electron-rich Pt sites formed due to the electronic interactions between Pt and Fe.
4. The transfer of electron density between Fe and Pt varies with the catalyst composition and decreases with increased Fe content.
5. Fe in the PtFe/SiO2 samples exists in both Feδ+ and Fe0 forms, suggesting that Pt proximity facilitates Fe reduction to the metallic state.
6. Both hydrogen chemisorption and CO adsorption strength on Pt are influenced by the amount of Fe present.
7. The PtFe/SiO2 catalysts show enhanced activity for CO oxidation compared to monometallic Pt/SiO2.
8. Small amounts of Fe promote the activity of Pt for cyclohexane dehydrogenation and selective citral hydrogenation.
9. The enhancing effects can be attributed to an electronic effect and/or the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites.
10. The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites enables Fe reduction, making it active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation.
11. PtFe adsorption sites favor the di-σCO adsorption mode for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, facilitating CO bond hydrogenation and alcohol formation.
12. However, the presence of large amounts of Fe eventually deactivates Pt, possibly due to iron oxide formation.

1. 铁影响SiO2支持的Pt催化剂的结构、化学吸附和催化性能，具有不同的Pt/铁比例。
2. 在350°C的H2处理下，形成了大小约为2.6 nm的金属颗粒，其中一些是双金属，并且可能呈筏状几何形状。
3. CO和NO的吸附表明，由于Pt和Fe之间的电子相互作用，存在电子富集的Pt位点。
4. Fe和Pt之间电子密度的转移随着催化剂组成的变化而变化，并且随Fe含量增加而减少。
5. Fe在PtFe/SiO2样品中以Feδ+和Fe0形式存在，表明Pt接近使Fe还原为金属状态。
6. 无论是氢化学吸附还是Pt上的CO吸附强度都受到Fe含量的影响。
7. 与单金属Pt/SiO2相比，PtFe/SiO2催化剂在空气中的CO氧化活性更高。
8. 少量Fe促进了Pt在环己烷脱氢和选择性citral氢化过程中的活性。
9. 这些增强效果可以归因于电子效应和/或双金属PtFe位点的存在。
10. 在这种位点附近的Pt和Fe的近距离接触使Fe还原为活性状态，促进环己烷脱氢。
11. PtFe吸附位点有利于α,β-不饱和醛类的di-σCO吸附模式，从而促进CO键的氢化和醇的形成。
12. 然而，大量Fe的存在最终导致Pt失活，可能是因为铁氧化物的形成。
