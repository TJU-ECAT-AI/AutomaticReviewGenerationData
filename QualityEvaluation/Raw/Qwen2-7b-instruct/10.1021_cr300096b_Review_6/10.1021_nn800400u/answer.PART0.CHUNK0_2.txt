Experimental techniques like High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) are utilized to examine the surface characteristics and composition of the bimetallic system. Oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), is quantified through these methods. The dynamics and energy barriers associated with this segregation are also compared with theoretical predictions made by Density Functional Theory (DFT).

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和二次电子能谱（AES），被用来研究双金属系统的表面性质和组成。通过这些方法，可以量化氧诱导的表面亚表面3d原子（特别是镍（Ni）和钴（Co））的表面聚集。该分离过程的动力学和能垒也与密度泛函理论（DFT）的预测进行了比较。
