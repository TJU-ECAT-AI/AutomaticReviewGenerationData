If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Experimental techniques like High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) are utilized to examine the surface characteristics and composition of the bimetallic system. Oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), is quantified through these methods. The dynamics and energy barriers associated with this segregation are also compared with theoretical predictions made by Density Functional Theory (DFT).

Experimental techniques like High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) are employed to validate and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of buried 3d atoms, particularly Nickel (Ni) and Cobalt (Co), within the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic structures. The observed kinetics of segregation and activation energy barriers align closely with predictions made through Density Functional Theory (DFT).
