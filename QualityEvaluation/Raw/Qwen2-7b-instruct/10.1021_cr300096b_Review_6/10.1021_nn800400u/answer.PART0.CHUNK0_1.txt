There are no specific experimental techniques mentioned in the provided literature that verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. Similarly, there is no comparison made between the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers and DFT predictions.
