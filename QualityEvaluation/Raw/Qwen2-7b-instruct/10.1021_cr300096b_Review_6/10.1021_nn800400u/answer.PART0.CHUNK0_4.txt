Experimental techniques like High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) are employed to validate and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of buried 3d atoms, particularly Nickel (Ni) and Cobalt (Co), within the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic structures. The observed kinetics of segregation and activation energy barriers align closely with predictions made through Density Functional Theory (DFT).

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和原子发射光谱（AES），被用来验证并量化由氧气诱导的表面区域效应，特别是在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，埋藏的3d原子，尤其是镍（Ni）和钴（Co）。观测到的区域化速度和激活能壁垒与通过密度泛函理论（DFT）做出的预测相吻合。
