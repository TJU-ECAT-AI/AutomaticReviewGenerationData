<p>The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose the systematic study of the effect of tin content on the activity, selectivity and stability of Pt/SiO2 catalysts modified with SnBu4 that are employed in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.</p>
<p>As is clear from the analysis of the figure, in spite of preventing the formation of the mentioned ether, the use of toluene and n-heptane makes the reaction become slower, reaching a conversion of 12% after 8 h of reaction.</p>
<p>These results indicate that the Pt/SiO2 catalyst suffers a certain deactivation. This observation is consistent with that reported for other systems used in the hydrogenation of furfural, which suggests that there may be a catalyst poisoning due to the adsorption of furfural and/or any of the reaction products on the active metal.</p>

1. The hydrogenation of furfural can be carried out in both liquid and vapor phases. In this study, the authors focus on the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural using bimetallic PtSn catalysts modified with tin content to enhance activity, selectivity, and stability.

2. The bimetallic PtSn catalysts showed varying levels of efficiency depending on the amount of tin (Sn) incorporated. The catalyst with the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3) was the most efficient in terms of activity and selectivity for furfuryl alcohol production.

3. The use of different solvents influenced the reaction rates and product selectivity. Toluene and n-heptane slowed down the reaction, reducing the conversion rate to 12% after 8 hours compared to the use of 2-propanol.

4. The Pt/SiO2 catalyst experienced deactivation over successive hydrogenation cycles, indicating potential poisoning by furfural or its reaction products吸附 onto the active metal surface. However, the PtSn0.3 catalyst maintained a high level of conversion even after three cycles, demonstrating better stability compared to other systems.

1. 甲醛氢化可以采用液相和气相两种方式。在本研究中，作者着重研究了通过添加不同含量的锡（Sn）到铂（Pt）/SiO2双金属催化剂中，以提高其活性、选择性和稳定性来进行液相甲醛氢化生成糠醇的过程。

2. 不同含量的Sn掺杂催化剂显示出了不同的效率。含Sn量最低的催化剂（PtSn0.3）在糠醇生产方面的活性和选择性最高。

3. 使用不同溶剂对反应速率和产物选择性产生了影响。与丙醇相比，使用甲苯和庚烷会使反应变慢，8小时后转化率降低至12%。

4. Pt/SiO2催化剂在多次氢化周期后出现了活性下降的现象，这可能是由于甲醛或其反应产物吸附到了活性金属表面导致的催化剂中毒。然而，PtSn0.3催化剂即使经过三次氢化循环仍能保持较高的转化率，显示出较好的稳定性。
