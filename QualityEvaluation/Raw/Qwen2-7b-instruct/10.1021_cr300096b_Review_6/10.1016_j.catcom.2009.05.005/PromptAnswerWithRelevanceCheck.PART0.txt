"Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural."
"When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but still they were very selective to furfuryl alcohol."
"The most efficient system was the catalyst with the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The bimetallic PtSn catalysts were created through controlled surface reactions, incorporating varying levels of tin. These catalysts were utilized in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. Upon multiple sequential hydrogenation reactions, the catalysts experienced a degree of deactivation, approximately 25% from the initial to the third cycle. Despite this, they maintained a high level of selectivity for furfuryl alcohol. Among the studied systems, the catalyst with the least amount of tin (PtSn0.3) exhibited the greatest efficiency.

The bimetallic PtSn catalysts, produced through controlled surface reactions, were utilized for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. They demonstrated selective activity towards furfuryl alcohol. Despite experiencing a slight deactivation across three consecutive cycles (25% drop in activity), the catalysts maintained their selectivity. The most effective system featured the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3).

<p>The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose the systematic study of the effect of tin content on the activity, selectivity and stability of Pt/SiO2 catalysts modified with SnBu4 that are employed in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.</p>
<p>As is clear from the analysis of the figure, in spite of preventing the formation of the mentioned ether, the use of toluene and n-heptane makes the reaction become slower, reaching a conversion of 12% after 8 h of reaction.</p>
<p>These results indicate that the Pt/SiO2 catalyst suffers a certain deactivation. This observation is consistent with that reported for other systems used in the hydrogenation of furfural, which suggests that there may be a catalyst poisoning due to the adsorption of furfural and/or any of the reaction products on the active metal.</p>

1. The hydrogenation of furfural can be carried out in both liquid and vapor phases. In this study, the authors focus on the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural using bimetallic PtSn catalysts modified with tin content to enhance activity, selectivity, and stability.

2. The bimetallic PtSn catalysts showed varying levels of efficiency depending on the amount of tin (Sn) incorporated. The catalyst with the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3) was the most efficient in terms of activity and selectivity for furfuryl alcohol production.

3. The use of different solvents influenced the reaction rates and product selectivity. Toluene and n-heptane slowed down the reaction, reducing the conversion rate to 12% after 8 hours compared to the use of 2-propanol.

4. The Pt/SiO2 catalyst experienced deactivation over successive hydrogenation cycles, indicating potential poisoning by furfural or its reaction products吸附 onto the active metal surface. However, the PtSn0.3 catalyst maintained a high level of conversion even after three cycles, demonstrating better stability compared to other systems.

1. 甲醛氢化可以采用液相和气相两种方式。在本研究中，作者着重研究了通过添加不同含量的锡（Sn）到铂（Pt）/SiO2双金属催化剂中，以提高其活性、选择性和稳定性来进行液相甲醛氢化生成糠醇的过程。

2. 不同含量的Sn掺杂催化剂显示出了不同的效率。含Sn量最低的催化剂（PtSn0.3）在糠醇生产方面的活性和选择性最高。

3. 使用不同溶剂对反应速率和产物选择性产生了影响。与丙醇相比，使用甲苯和庚烷会使反应变慢，8小时后转化率降低至12%。

4. Pt/SiO2催化剂在多次氢化周期后出现了活性下降的现象，这可能是由于甲醛或其反应产物吸附到了活性金属表面导致的催化剂中毒。然而，PtSn0.3催化剂即使经过三次氢化循环仍能保持较高的转化率，显示出较好的稳定性。

<p>The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase.</p>
<p>In this sense, systems based on Ni or Co modified with Cu, Fe, Ce or heteropolyacids have proved to be very successful, reaching 98% selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol, at almost total conversion.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, the main disadvantage is that the catalyst cannot be reused.</p>
<p>Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds.</p>
<p>Those studies revealed that in the bimetallic systems, there is a convergence of geometric (dilution of Pt sites) and electronic (increase of the electron density of Pt) effects, due to the presence of Sn, which modifies the characteristics of the base Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>As is clear from the analysis of the figure, in spite of preventing the formation of the mentioned ether, the use of toluene and n-heptane makes the reaction become slower, reaching a conversion of 12% after 8 h of reaction.</p>

1. Furfural hydrogenation is typically performed in liquid or vapor phases.
2. Nickel or cobalt catalysts modified with copper, iron, cerium, or heteropolyacids have been proven effective, achieving 98% selectivity in the production of the unsaturated alcohol, with near complete conversion.
3. A significant drawback of these catalysts is that they are not reusable.
4. Our research team has demonstrated that incorporating tin into platinum-based systems enhances their efficiency in the hydrogenation of various unsaturated carbonyl compounds.
5. The introduction of tin into bimetallic systems results in a synergistic effect on the geometric structure and electronic properties of the platinum sites, which are altered due to the presence of tin, thereby modifying the base platinum catalyst.
6. Utilizing toluene or n-heptane as solvents in the hydrogenation process leads to a decrease in reaction speed, with conversions reaching only 12% after 8 hours of reaction.

Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (9698%). A minor product was detected when alcoholic solvent were employed, coming from the reaction between furfuryl alcohol and the solvent. Nonalcoholic and non-polar solvents caused a drastic activity decrease.
When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but still they were very selective to furfuryl alcohol. The most efficient system was the catalyst with the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3).
