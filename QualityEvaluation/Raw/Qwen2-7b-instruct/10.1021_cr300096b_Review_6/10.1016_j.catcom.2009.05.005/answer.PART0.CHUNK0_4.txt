Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (9698%). A minor product was detected when alcoholic solvent were employed, coming from the reaction between furfuryl alcohol and the solvent. Nonalcoholic and non-polar solvents caused a drastic activity decrease.
When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but still they were very selective to furfuryl alcohol. The most efficient system was the catalyst with the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3).

The bimetallic PtSn catalysts were synthesized through controlled surface reactions, exhibiting high selectivity (96%-98%) for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Their activity decreased by 25% across three consecutive cycles, yet they maintained significant selectivity. The catalyst with the least amount of tin (PtSn0.3) was the most effective.

通过控制表面反应合成了双金属PtSn催化剂，在液相氢化糠醛为糠醇提供了高选择性（96%-98%）。在三个连续反应周期后，其活性降低了25%，但仍然保持了显著的选择性。含锡量最少（PtSn0.3）的催化剂最为有效。
