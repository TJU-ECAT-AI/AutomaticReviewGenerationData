"Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural."
"When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but still they were very selective to furfuryl alcohol."
"The most efficient system was the catalyst with the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3)."

The bimetallic PtSn catalysts were created through controlled surface reactions, incorporating varying levels of tin. These catalysts were utilized in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. Upon multiple sequential hydrogenation reactions, the catalysts experienced a degree of deactivation, approximately 25% from the initial to the third cycle. Despite this, they maintained a high level of selectivity for furfuryl alcohol. Among the studied systems, the catalyst with the least amount of tin (PtSn0.3) exhibited the greatest efficiency.

通过受控表面反应，制备了含不同锡含量的双金属PtSn催化剂，并用于液体相糠醛氢化。在连续氢化反应中，这些催化剂表现出一定的失活现象，在第一次和第三次循环之间约为25%。尽管如此，它们仍对糠醇保持高度的选择性。在所有研究的体系中，含锡量最少的催化剂（PtSn0.3）显示出最佳的性能。
