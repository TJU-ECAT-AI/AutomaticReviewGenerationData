<p>The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase.</p>
<p>In this sense, systems based on Ni or Co modified with Cu, Fe, Ce or heteropolyacids have proved to be very successful, reaching 98% selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol, at almost total conversion.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, the main disadvantage is that the catalyst cannot be reused.</p>
<p>Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds.</p>
<p>Those studies revealed that in the bimetallic systems, there is a convergence of geometric (dilution of Pt sites) and electronic (increase of the electron density of Pt) effects, due to the presence of Sn, which modifies the characteristics of the base Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>As is clear from the analysis of the figure, in spite of preventing the formation of the mentioned ether, the use of toluene and n-heptane makes the reaction become slower, reaching a conversion of 12% after 8 h of reaction.</p>

1. Furfural hydrogenation is typically performed in liquid or vapor phases.
2. Nickel or cobalt catalysts modified with copper, iron, cerium, or heteropolyacids have been proven effective, achieving 98% selectivity in the production of the unsaturated alcohol, with near complete conversion.
3. A significant drawback of these catalysts is that they are not reusable.
4. Our research team has demonstrated that incorporating tin into platinum-based systems enhances their efficiency in the hydrogenation of various unsaturated carbonyl compounds.
5. The introduction of tin into bimetallic systems results in a synergistic effect on the geometric structure and electronic properties of the platinum sites, which are altered due to the presence of tin, thereby modifying the base platinum catalyst.
6. Utilizing toluene or n-heptane as solvents in the hydrogenation process leads to a decrease in reaction speed, with conversions reaching only 12% after 8 hours of reaction.

1. 葡萄糖酸氢化通常在液相或气相中进行。
2. 镍或钴催化剂通过添加铜、铁、铈或杂多酸已经证明非常成功，能够达到98%的不饱和醇选择性，接近完全转化。
3. 这些催化剂的主要缺点是不可重复使用。
4. 我们的研究小组已经证明，在铂基系统中加入锡可以提高许多不同不饱和羰基化合物的氢化效率。
5. 锡的引入导致了铂位结构和电子性质的协同效应，由于锡的存在改变了基础铂催化剂的特性。
6. 使用甲苯或庚烷作为溶剂在氢化过程中导致反应速度降低，8小时后的转化率仅为12%。
