"Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural."
"When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but still they were very selective to furfuryl alcohol."
"The most efficient system was the catalyst with the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3)."

The bimetallic PtSn catalysts, produced through controlled surface reactions, were utilized for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. They demonstrated selective activity towards furfuryl alcohol. Despite experiencing a slight deactivation across three consecutive cycles (25% drop in activity), the catalysts maintained their selectivity. The most effective system featured the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3).
