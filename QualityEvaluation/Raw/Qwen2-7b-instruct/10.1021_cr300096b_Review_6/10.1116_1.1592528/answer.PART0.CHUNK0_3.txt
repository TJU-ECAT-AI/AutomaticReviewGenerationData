Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods measure the kinetics and activation barriers of the segregation process, which can then be compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems.

实验技术如HREELS和AES用于验证和量化氧诱导表面亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面聚积。这些方法测量了聚积过程的动力学和活化势垒，然后可以将这些结果与这些系统的密度泛函理论（DFT）预测进行比较。
