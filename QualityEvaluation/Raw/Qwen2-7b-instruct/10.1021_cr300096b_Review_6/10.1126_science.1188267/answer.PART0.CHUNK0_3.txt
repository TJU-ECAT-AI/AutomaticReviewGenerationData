<p>In many catalytic processes, the size of metal-containing catalysts falls typically in the range of 1 to 10 nm. The catalytically active sites in these catalysts are often coordinatively unsaturated metal cations that are able to undergo facile electron transfer and promote catalytic reactions, as has been studied in (15). In oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, the iron (II) ion constrained in a planar porphyrin ring could transport O2 via facile interconversion between Fe2+ and Fe3+ states (6). Homogeneous catalysis in aqueous solutions uses Fentons reagent, being a mixture of Fe2+ ions and H2O2, to produce hydrated ferryl ions [(H2O)5FeIVO]2+, which act as the active intermediates to oxidize various organic compounds, such as methane (7). However, for heterogeneous catalysis with nanopore environments the active species in Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite zeolites are also coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ grafted to the zeolite crystalline matrix. The dissociation of N2O at the Fe sites leads to formation of α-oxygen species, which are active in the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol at mild conditions (8). These characteristic coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites are confined by various ensembles such as proteins, ligands, and nanopore matrix, which are essential for their high reactivity and stability in the catalytic oxidation reactions mentioned above (9).</p>

The literature discusses the use of coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites in various catalytic processes, including metalloenzymes, homogeneous metal complexes, and heterogeneous catalysts. It mentions the reactivity and stability of these sites in different environments, such as oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, Fenton's reagent, and zeolite-based catalysts. However, it does not specifically address the experimental techniques of HREELS and AES used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor does it provide direct comparisons between the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers and DFT predictions for these systems.

文献讨论了在多种催化过程中使用协调不饱和二价铁（CUF）位点，包括金属酶、均相金属复合物和异相催化剂。它提到了这些位点在不同环境下的活性和稳定性，例如氧载体血红蛋白、芬顿试剂和沸石基催化剂。然而，它没有具体讨论用于验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中表面氧诱导的次表层3d原子迁移的实验技术，也没有提供直接比较测量的迁移动力学和激活势垒与第一性原理计算预测之间的对比。
