<p>In many catalytic processes, the size of metal-containing catalysts falls typically in the range of 1 to 10 nm. The catalytically active sites in these catalysts are often coordinatively unsaturated metal cations that are able to undergo facile electron transfer and promote catalytic reactions, as has been studied in (15).</p>
<p>In oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, the iron (II) ion constrained in a planar porphyrin ring could transport O2 via facile interconversion between Fe2+ and Fe3+ states (6).</p>
<p>Homogeneous catalysis in aqueous solutions uses Fentons reagent, being a mixture of Fe2+ ions and H2O2, to produce hydrated ferryl ions [(H2O)5FeIVO]2+, which act as the active intermediates to oxidize various organic compounds, such as methane (7).</p>
<p>However, for heterogeneous catalysis with nanopore environments the active species in Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite zeolites are also coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ grafted to the zeolite crystalline matrix.</p>
<p>The dissociation of N2O at the Fe sites leads to formation of α-oxygen species, which are active in the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol at mild conditions (8).</p>
<p>These characteristic coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites are confined by various ensembles such as proteins, ligands, and nanopore matrix, which are essential for their high reactivity and stability in the catalytic oxidation reactions mentioned above (9).</p>
<p>On the basis of surface science measurements, density functional calculations, and catalytic reactions under realistic conditions, we describe here a strategy to achieve this goal that takes advantage of the confinement effect at interfaces between nanostructured ferrous oxides (FeO) and metal (Pt) substrates.</p>
<p>The interface-confined CUF sites and neighboring Pt atoms are identified conclusively as the active centers to activate O2. The dissociated atomic oxygen atoms therein present modest adsorption energy and thus are highly reactive.</p>
<p>Catalytic reaction experiments on the supported Pt-Fe catalysts prepared by a dedicated and reproducible synthesis method show that the identified ensemble is highly active, selective, and robust for CO oxidation, even under operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).</p>
<p>The formation of the CUF sites at the peripheries of the FeO nanoislands is due to the stabilization of interface confinement between the oxide overlayers and the metal supports.</p>
<p>CO oxidation on FeO1-x/Pt(111) might maintain its activity even in the presence of H2 because dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt suffers from CO poisoning.</p>
<p>CO PROX reactions under stoichiometric condition (1% CO and 0.5% O2, 98.5% H2, 0.1 M Pa, 36000 ml g1 h1) are conducted on the Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts.</p>
<p>For the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, CO conversion is negligible below RT, but increases slowly with temperature.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show a high activity, with almost 100% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity at RT.</p>
<p>Even at 200 K, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts maintain 20% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity.</p>
<p>We measured the oxidation state of the Fe species under reaction conditions using in situ x-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAFS).</p>
<p>Compared with the Fe K-edge XAFS spectra from the reduced and fully oxidized Pt-Fe catalysts, the pre-edge feature from the Pt-Fe NPs under the reaction conditions was located in the middle.</p>
<p>The Pt-Fe catalysts prepared are very stable, and no deterioration of their performance was found after 40 hours at RT.</p>
<p>Under PEMFC working conditions operated typically at 353 to 373 K, there are considerable amounts of water and CO2 present.</p>
<p>We tested the Pt-Fe catalysts under the realistic PEMFC conditions.</p>
<p>The catalysts were stable and showed good performances, with 92% CO selectivity/conversion at 353 K.</p>
<p>By using slight excess of O2, CO can be removed to a level lower than 1 part per million.</p>
<p>We also assembled the Pt-Fe nanocatalysts into a 1-kW PEMFC working system.</p>
<p>We found that the cell performance stays quite stable after a 930-hour test but deactivates quickly after a 30-min test without using the Pt-Fe catalyst.</p>
<p>We demonstrated a strategy of preparing coordinatively unsaturated metal sites with lower valent states on metal substrates by taking advantage of the confinement effects at interfaces between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates.</p>
<p>The confined CUF sites and neighboring metal atoms show a high activity and stability in CO oxidation under realistic conditions.</p>

Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which are then compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. The literature does not provide specific details on how HREELS and AES are used in this context, but it is implied that they are standard methods for analyzing surface chemistry and composition in bimetallic systems.

The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers are crucial for understanding the interaction between the 3d atoms and the Pt substrate, particularly in terms of how they are influenced by the oxygen environment. The DFT predictions provide theoretical insights into the electronic structure and energetics of these interactions, allowing researchers to correlate experimental observations with theoretical expectations. This comparison helps validate the models used in DFT calculations and offers a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the behavior of subsurface atoms in bimetallic systems under various conditions.

In summary, HREELS and AES are employed to characterize the surface properties of Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems, while DFT calculations offer a complementary theoretical framework to interpret the experimental data. The agreement between the experimental results obtained using these techniques and the DFT predictions is essential for advancing the knowledge of surface chemistry and catalysis in bimetallic systems.
