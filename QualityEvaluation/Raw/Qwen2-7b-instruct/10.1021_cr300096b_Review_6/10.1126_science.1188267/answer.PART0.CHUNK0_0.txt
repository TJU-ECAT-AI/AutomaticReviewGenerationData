<p>Many catalysts in solution, such as metalloenzymes and homogeneous metal complexes, create active sites where the metal ion is available to bind and activate reactants. Such coordinately unsaturated ferrous sites, or CUFs, have been created in a supported heterogeneous catalyst by Fu et al. (p. 1141).</p>
<p>Ferrous oxide islands grown on platinum single-crystal surfaces were much more reactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures than more oxidized ferric islands.</p>
<p>The interface-confined CUF sites together with the metal supports are active for dioxygen activation, producing reactive dissociated oxygen atoms.</p>
<p>We show that the structural ensemble was highly efficient for carbon monoxide oxidation at low temperature under typical operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell.</p>
<p>The presence of ferrous species was further verified by the characteristic x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) Fe 2p3/2 peak at binding energy (BE) of 709.3 eV, in comparison with the BEs of 707.3 eV from a metallic Fe film grown on Pt(111) and 711.0 eV in ferric oxide deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (fig. S1).</p>
<p>To investigate the reactivity of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces, we first presaturated the samples with CO. Afterward, a steady-state flux of O2 at nominally 5.2 × 108 mbar was leaked into the chamber at RT. The removal of CO was studied by monitoring the variation of the characteristic in situ UPS peaks at a BE of 9.4 eV from 5σ and 1π states of adsorbed CO (14).</p>
<p>On the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces, the adsorbed CO was found to react off by O2 exposure within 5 min, whereas Pt(111) shows negligible activity under the same conditions.</p>
<p>In Fig. 1C, the rate of CO removal is plotted as a function of the SPD of the FeO nanoislands, and a linear correlation between the rate and SPD can be seen. This shows unambiguously that the CUF sites at the peripheries of the FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) are the active sites for CO oxidation.</p>
<p>The formation of the CUF sites at the peripheries of the FeO nanoislands is due to the stabilization of interface confinement between the oxide overlayers and the metal supports.</p>
<p>CO oxidation on FeO1-x/Pt(111) might maintain its activity even in the presence of H2 because dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt suffers from CO poisoning.</p>
<p>CO PROX reactions under stoichiometric condition (1% CO and 0.5% O2, 98.5% H2, 0.1 M Pa, 36000 ml g1 h1) are conducted on the Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts. The corresponding activity and selectivity were measured from the temperature-dependent reaction profiles (Fig. 3, C and D).</p>
<p>For the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, CO conversion is negligible below RT, but increases slowly with temperature. At 473 K, only 70% CO was reacted off.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show a high activity, with almost 100% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity at RT.</p>
<p>Under PEMFC working conditions operated typically at 353 to 373 K, there are considerable amounts of water and CO2 present. We tested the Pt-Fe catalysts under the realistic PEMFC conditions.</p>
<p>The Pt-Fe catalysts prepared are very stable, and no deterioration of their performance was found after 40 hours at RT (fig. S12).</p>
<p>By using slight excess of O2, CO can be removed to a level lower than 1 part per million (fig S14).</p>
<p>We also assembled the Pt-Fe nanocatalysts into a 1-kW PEMFC working system. We found that the cell performance stays quite stable after a 930-hour test but deactivates quickly after a 30-min test without using the Pt-Fe catalyst (fig. S15).</p>
