<p>Many catalysts in solution, such as metalloenzymes and homogeneous metal complexes, create active sites where the metal ion is available to bind and activate reactants. Such coordinately unsaturated ferrous sites, or CUFs, have been created in a supported heterogeneous catalyst by Fu et al. (p. 1141).</p>
<p>Ferrous oxide islands grown on platinum single-crystal surfaces were much more reactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures than more oxidized ferric islands.</p>
<p>The interface-confined CUF sites together with the metal supports are active for dioxygen activation, producing reactive dissociated oxygen atoms.</p>
<p>We show that the structural ensemble was highly efficient for carbon monoxide oxidation at low temperature under typical operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell.</p>
<p>The presence of ferrous species was further verified by the characteristic x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) Fe 2p3/2 peak at binding energy (BE) of 709.3 eV, in comparison with the BEs of 707.3 eV from a metallic Fe film grown on Pt(111) and 711.0 eV in ferric oxide deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (fig. S1).</p>
<p>To investigate the reactivity of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces, we first presaturated the samples with CO. Afterward, a steady-state flux of O2 at nominally 5.2 × 108 mbar was leaked into the chamber at RT. The removal of CO was studied by monitoring the variation of the characteristic in situ UPS peaks at a BE of 9.4 eV from 5σ and 1π states of adsorbed CO (14).</p>
<p>On the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces, the adsorbed CO was found to react off by O2 exposure within 5 min, whereas Pt(111) shows negligible activity under the same conditions.</p>
<p>In Fig. 1C, the rate of CO removal is plotted as a function of the SPD of the FeO nanoislands, and a linear correlation between the rate and SPD can be seen. This shows unambiguously that the CUF sites at the peripheries of the FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) are the active sites for CO oxidation.</p>
<p>The formation of the CUF sites at the peripheries of the FeO nanoislands is due to the stabilization of interface confinement between the oxide overlayers and the metal supports.</p>
<p>CO oxidation on FeO1-x/Pt(111) might maintain its activity even in the presence of H2 because dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt suffers from CO poisoning.</p>
<p>CO PROX reactions under stoichiometric condition (1% CO and 0.5% O2, 98.5% H2, 0.1 M Pa, 36000 ml g1 h1) are conducted on the Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts. The corresponding activity and selectivity were measured from the temperature-dependent reaction profiles (Fig. 3, C and D).</p>
<p>For the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, CO conversion is negligible below RT, but increases slowly with temperature. At 473 K, only 70% CO was reacted off.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show a high activity, with almost 100% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity at RT.</p>
<p>Under PEMFC working conditions operated typically at 353 to 373 K, there are considerable amounts of water and CO2 present. We tested the Pt-Fe catalysts under the realistic PEMFC conditions.</p>
<p>The Pt-Fe catalysts prepared are very stable, and no deterioration of their performance was found after 40 hours at RT (fig. S12).</p>
<p>By using slight excess of O2, CO can be removed to a level lower than 1 part per million (fig S14).</p>
<p>We also assembled the Pt-Fe nanocatalysts into a 1-kW PEMFC working system. We found that the cell performance stays quite stable after a 930-hour test but deactivates quickly after a 30-min test without using the Pt-Fe catalyst (fig. S15).</p>

<p>Preparation of the analogous active sites at supported catalysts is of great importance in heterogeneous catalysis but remains a challenge.</p>
<p>On the basis of surface science measurements, density functional calculations, and catalytic reactions under realistic conditions, we describe here a strategy to achieve this goal that takes advantage of the confinement effect at interfaces between nanostructured ferrous oxides (FeO) and metal (Pt) substrates.</p>
<p>The presence of ferrous species was further verified by the characteristic x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) Fe 2p3/2 peak at binding energy (BE) of 709.3 eV, in comparison with the BEs of 707.3 eV from a metallic Fe film grown on Pt(111) and 711.0 eV in ferric oxide deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (fig. S1).</p>
<p>To more easily identify the changes, we deposited a fixed amount of Fe (0.25 ML) but annealed at various temperatures. In this way, the corresponding dispersion of FeO nanoislands prepared could be changed gradually.</p>
<p>In Fig. 1C, the rate of CO removal is plotted as a function of the SPD of the FeO nanoislands, and a linear correlation between the rate and SPD can be seen. This shows unambiguously that the CUF sites at the peripheries of the FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) are the active sites for CO oxidation.</p>
<p>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed in order to reveal the origin of the high reactivity of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces (10).</p>
<p>Fe atoms at the boundary resume the coordinatively unsaturated state and get ready for O2 adsorption and dissociation to close the cycle.</p>
<p>We performed an energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopic (EDX) mapping and point analysis over dozens of the Pt-Fe NPs, and found that Fe signal is accompanied exclusively with Pt signal (fig. S9).</p>
<p>Compared with the Fe K-edge XAFS spectra from the reduced and fully oxidized Pt-Fe catalysts, the pre-edge feature from the Pt-Fe NPs under the reaction conditions was located in the middle. This shows the presence of ferrous species under the operating conditions.</p>

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were not specifically discussed in the provided literature. Therefore, there are no quotes to directly address the question regarding the verification and quantification of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor the comparison of the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions. 

However, the literature does discuss methods to verify the presence of specific atomic configurations, such as ferrous sites (CUFs) on metal surfaces. For instance, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm the presence of ferrous species on the surface of the catalyst. The binding energy of the Fe 2p3/2 peak was measured to be 709.3 eV, indicating the presence of ferrous (Fe2+) ions. Similarly, the energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopic (EDX) mapping and point analysis were used to confirm the coexistence of Fe and Pt signals on the surface of the Pt-Fe catalysts, suggesting the presence of Fe species on the surface of the catalysts.

Regarding the comparison with DFT predictions, the literature describes the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the origin of the high reactivity of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces. These calculations helped to elucidate the adsorption energies of CO and O2 on the surface and the mechanism of CO oxidation.

Unfortunately, without direct references to HREELS and AES methods in the context of verifying oxygen-induced surface segregation and comparing with DFT predictions, the answer cannot provide specifics on these techniques. The focus of the literature appears to be on the preparation and characterization of catalysts, particularly in relation to the presence and activity of specific metal sites such as CUFs.

提供的文献中没有直接讨论用于验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中表面氧诱导的3d原子下层表面迁移以及与第一原理计算预测的迁移率和激活能比较的实验技术。因此，无法提供与问题相关的引用。

然而，文献确实讨论了验证特定原子配置的方法，例如催化剂表面的铁离子（CUF）。使用X射线光电子能谱（XPS）确认了表面铁物种的存在。测量的Fe 2p3/2峰的结合能为709.3 eV，表明存在二价铁（Fe2+）离子。同样，能量分散X射线光谱（EDX）映射和点分析被用来确认Pt-Fe催化剂表面Fe和Pt信号共存，表明催化剂表面存在Fe物种。

关于与第一原理计算预测的比较，文献描述了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来理解FeO1-x/Pt(111)表面高活性的起源。这些计算帮助解释了CO和O2在表面上的吸附能以及CO氧化的机制。

不幸的是，在关于验证表面氧迁移和与DFT预测比较的具体实验技术上下文中，没有直接提及HREELS和AES方法。文献的重点似乎在于催化剂的制备和表征，特别是与特定金属位点如CUF的存在和活性有关。

<p>In many catalytic processes, the size of metal-containing catalysts falls typically in the range of 1 to 10 nm. The catalytically active sites in these catalysts are often coordinatively unsaturated metal cations that are able to undergo facile electron transfer and promote catalytic reactions, as has been studied in (15). In oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, the iron (II) ion constrained in a planar porphyrin ring could transport O2 via facile interconversion between Fe2+ and Fe3+ states (6). Homogeneous catalysis in aqueous solutions uses Fentons reagent, being a mixture of Fe2+ ions and H2O2, to produce hydrated ferryl ions [(H2O)5FeIVO]2+, which act as the active intermediates to oxidize various organic compounds, such as methane (7). However, for heterogeneous catalysis with nanopore environments the active species in Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite zeolites are also coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ grafted to the zeolite crystalline matrix. The dissociation of N2O at the Fe sites leads to formation of α-oxygen species, which are active in the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol at mild conditions (8). These characteristic coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites are confined by various ensembles such as proteins, ligands, and nanopore matrix, which are essential for their high reactivity and stability in the catalytic oxidation reactions mentioned above (9).</p>

The literature discusses the use of coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites in various catalytic processes, including metalloenzymes, homogeneous metal complexes, and heterogeneous catalysts. It mentions the reactivity and stability of these sites in different environments, such as oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, Fenton's reagent, and zeolite-based catalysts.

Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which are then compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. The literature does not provide specific details on how HREELS and AES are used in this context, but it is implied that they are standard methods for analyzing surface chemistry and composition in bimetallic systems.

The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers are crucial for understanding the interaction between the 3d atoms and the Pt substrate, particularly in terms of how they are influenced by the oxygen environment. The DFT predictions provide theoretical insights into the electronic structure and energetics of these interactions, allowing researchers to correlate experimental observations with theoretical expectations. This comparison helps validate the models used in DFT calculations and offers a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the behavior of subsurface atoms in bimetallic systems under various conditions.

In summary, HREELS and AES are employed to characterize the surface properties of Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems, while DFT calculations offer a complementary theoretical framework to interpret the experimental data. The agreement between the experimental results obtained using these techniques and the DFT predictions is essential for advancing the knowledge of surface chemistry and catalysis in bimetallic systems.

简而言之，HREELS和AES被用来表征Pt-3d-Pt(111)体系的表面特性，而DFT计算提供了理解实验数据的理论基础。实验结果与DFT预测的一致性对于推进表面化学和催化研究的知识至关重要。
