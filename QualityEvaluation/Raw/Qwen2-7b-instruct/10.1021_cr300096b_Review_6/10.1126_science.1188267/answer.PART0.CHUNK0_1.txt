<p>Many catalysts in solution, such as metalloenzymes and homogeneous metal complexes, create active sites where the metal ion is available to bind and activate reactants. Such coordinately unsaturated ferrous sites, or CUFs, have been created in a supported heterogeneous catalyst by Fu et al. (p. 1141).</p>
<p>Ferrous oxide islands grown on platinum single-crystal surfaces were much more reactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures than more oxidized ferric islands.</p>
<p>Preparation of the analogous active sites at supported catalysts is of great importance in heterogeneous catalysis but remains a challenge.</p>
<p>On the basis of surface science measurements, density functional calculations, and catalytic reactions under realistic conditions, we describe here a strategy to achieve this goal that takes advantage of the confinement effect at interfaces between nanostructured ferrous oxides (FeO) and metal (Pt) substrates.</p>
<p>The presence of ferrous species was further verified by the characteristic x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) Fe 2p3/2 peak at binding energy (BE) of 709.3 eV, in comparison with the BEs of 707.3 eV from a metallic Fe film grown on Pt(111) and 711.0 eV in ferric oxide deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (fig. S1).</p>
<p>To more easily identify the changes, we deposited a fixed amount of Fe (0.25 ML) but annealed at various temperatures. In this way, the corresponding dispersion of FeO nanoislands prepared could be changed gradually.</p>
<p>In Fig. 1C, the rate of CO removal is plotted as a function of the SPD of the FeO nanoislands, and a linear correlation between the rate and SPD can be seen. This shows unambiguously that the CUF sites at the peripheries of the FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) are the active sites for CO oxidation.</p>
<p>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed in order to reveal the origin of the high reactivity of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces (10).</p>
<p>Fe atoms at the boundary resume the coordinatively unsaturated state and get ready for O2 adsorption and dissociation to close the cycle.</p>
<p>We performed an energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopic (EDX) mapping and point analysis over dozens of the Pt-Fe NPs, and found that Fe signal is accompanied exclusively with Pt signal (fig. S9).</p>
<p>Compared with the Fe K-edge XAFS spectra from the reduced and fully oxidized Pt-Fe catalysts, the pre-edge feature from the Pt-Fe NPs under the reaction conditions was located in the middle. This shows the presence of ferrous species under the operating conditions.</p>
<p>The Pt-Fe catalysts prepared are very stable, and no deterioration of their performance was found after 40 hours at RT (fig. S12).</p>
<p>Under PEMFC working conditions operated typically at 353 to 373 K, there are considerable amounts of water and CO2 present. We tested the Pt-Fe catalysts under the realistic PEMFC conditions.</p>
<p>We demonstrated a strategy of preparing coordinatively unsaturated metal sites with lower valent states on metal substrates by taking advantage of the confinement effects at interfaces between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates.</p>

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were not specifically discussed in the provided literature. Therefore, there are no quotes to directly address the question regarding the verification and quantification of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor the comparison of the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions. 

However, the literature does discuss methods to verify the presence of specific atomic configurations, such as ferrous sites (CUFs) on metal surfaces. For instance, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm the presence of ferrous species on the surface of the catalyst. The binding energy of the Fe 2p3/2 peak was measured to be 709.3 eV, indicating the presence of ferrous (Fe2+) ions. Similarly, the energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopic (EDX) mapping and point analysis were used to confirm the coexistence of Fe and Pt signals on the surface of the Pt-Fe catalysts, suggesting the presence of Fe species on the surface of the catalysts.

Regarding the comparison with DFT predictions, the literature describes the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the origin of the high reactivity of the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surfaces. These calculations helped to elucidate the adsorption energies of CO and O2 on the surface and the mechanism of CO oxidation.

Unfortunately, without direct references to HREELS and AES methods in the context of verifying oxygen-induced surface segregation and comparing with DFT predictions, the answer cannot provide specifics on these techniques. The focus of the literature appears to be on the preparation and characterization of catalysts, particularly in relation to the presence and activity of specific metal sites such as CUFs.

提供的文献中没有直接讨论用于验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中表面氧诱导的3d原子下层表面迁移以及与第一原理计算预测的迁移率和激活能比较的实验技术。因此，无法提供与问题相关的引用。

然而，文献确实讨论了验证特定原子配置的方法，例如催化剂表面的铁离子（CUF）。使用X射线光电子能谱（XPS）确认了表面铁物种的存在。测量的Fe 2p3/2峰的结合能为709.3 eV，表明存在二价铁（Fe2+）离子。同样，能量分散X射线光谱（EDX）映射和点分析被用来确认Pt-Fe催化剂表面Fe和Pt信号共存，表明催化剂表面存在Fe物种。

关于与第一原理计算预测的比较，文献描述了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来理解FeO1-x/Pt(111)表面高活性的起源。这些计算帮助解释了CO和O2在表面上的吸附能以及CO氧化的机制。

不幸的是，在关于验证表面氧迁移和与DFT预测比较的具体实验技术上下文中，没有直接提及HREELS和AES方法。文献的重点似乎在于催化剂的制备和表征，特别是与特定金属位点如CUF的存在和活性有关。
