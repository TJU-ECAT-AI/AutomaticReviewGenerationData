[1] "Through both experimental and theoretical studies, it has been observed that the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure is stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen [22], however, if this surface is exposed to oxygen, the 3d-metal atoms segregate to the surface to create the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structure [19,26]."
[2] "Similar behavior has been reported in recent in situ studies on both poly-crystalline foils [27] and supported catalysts [28], where Ni atoms in Pt/Ni catalysts were observed to segregate from the subsurface to surface in the presence of oxygen, with the reverse process occurring in the presence of hydrogen."
[3] "It is important to note that the activation barrier for the transformation between subsurface and surface structures is only 15 kcal/mol for PtNiPt(1 1 1) and 7 kcal/mol for PtCoPt(1 1 1) [19], suggesting that the 3d-metal atoms may diffuse and segregate during calcination and reduction procedures as well as under reaction conditions."

The experimental techniques of HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods reveal that when exposed to oxygen, the 3d-metal atoms (Ni and Co) segregate to the surface, creating a 3dPtPt(111) structure. This process occurs with a relatively low activation barrier of 15 kcal/mol for PtNiPt(111) and 7 kcal/mol for PtCoPt(111). In situ studies on both poly-crystalline foils and supported catalysts show that Ni atoms in Pt/Ni catalysts segregate from the subsurface to the surface in the presence of oxygen, reversing the process when hydrogen is present. This indicates that 3d-metal atoms can diffuse and segregate during calcination and reduction procedures, as well as under reaction conditions, which is in line with DFT predictions for these systems.

HREELS和AES实验技术验证并量化了在氧化物诱导下，Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中亚表面3d原子（尤其是Ni和Co）的表面聚集。这些方法表明，在暴露于氧气的情况下，3d金属原子（Ni和Co）会聚集到表面，形成3dPtPt(111)结构。这一过程的活化能壁垒相对较低，分别为15 kcal/mol（对于PtNiPt(111)）和7 kcal/mol（对于PtCoPt(111)）。在聚晶箔材和支持催化剂的原位研究中，发现当存在氧气时，Pt/Ni催化剂中的Ni原子从亚表面向表面聚集，而在氢气存在的情况下则发生相反的过程。这表明3d金属原子在煅烧、还原过程中以及在反应条件下可以扩散并聚集，这与对这些系统的DFT预测相吻合。
