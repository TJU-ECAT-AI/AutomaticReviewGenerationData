[1] "It is important to note that the activation barrier for the transformation between subsur- face and surface structures is only 15 kcal/mol for PtNiPt(1 1 1) and 7 kcal/mol for PtCoPt(1 1 1) [19], suggesting that the 3d- metal atoms may diffuse and segregate during calcination and reduction procedures as well as under reaction conditions."
[2] "Similar behavior has been reported in recent in situ studies on both poly- crystalline foils [27] and supported catalysts [28], where Ni atoms in Pt/Ni catalysts were observed to segregate from the subsurface to surface in the presence of oxygen, with the reverse process occurring in the presence of hydrogen."

The activation barriers for the transformation between subsurface and surface structures in PtNiPt(1 1 1) and PtCoPt(1 1 1) systems are 15 kcal/mol and 7 kcal/mol, respectively. This indicates that the 3d-metal atoms, particularly Ni and Co, can diffuse and segregate during calcination, reduction, and under reaction conditions. In situ studies on both polycrystalline foils and supported catalysts have shown that Ni atoms in Pt/Ni catalysts segregate from the subsurface to the surface when exposed to oxygen, and revert to the subsurface upon hydrogen exposure.

对于PtNiPt(1 1 1)和PtCoPt(1 1 1)系统，表面和亚表面结构之间的转换激活能分别为15 kcal/mol和7 kcal/mol。这表明，特别是Ni和Co的3d金属原子可以在煅烧、还原以及反应条件下扩散并发生相分离。在对多晶箔和负载催化剂的原位研究中发现，当暴露于氧气时，Pt/Ni催化剂中的Ni原子会从亚表面迁移到表面，而在氢气存在下则会回到亚表面。
