[C1] "Fig. 7 shows the results of DFT calculations of the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on several Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding energies are plotted ver- sus the surface d-band center, which has been found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces [6]."
[C2] "Many research groups have been able to linearly correlate the bind- ing energies of small molecules to the d-band center of various monometallic and bimetallic surfaces [9,21]. In Fig. 7, the binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."
[C3] "It is also interest to note that, unlike other Pt/3d systems,the subsurface PtCuPt(1 1 1) and surface CuPtPt(1 1 1) struc- tures bind 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen with very similar binding energies."
[C4] "However, based on the binding energies Fig. 7 also predicts that PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should display greater hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1)."
[C5] "Despite its low activity, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst displays a preference toward partial hydrogenation to pro- duce butenes."

1. HREELS and AES techniques are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measurements reveal the kinetics and activation barriers of this segregation process, which are then compared with DFT predictions.

2. The binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are plotted against the surface d-band center, which is found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies correlate well with the d-band center, with the weakest binding energies observed on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures.

3. Interestingly, the subsurface PtCuPt(1 1 1) and surface CuPtPt(1 1 1) structures exhibit similar binding energies for 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen, unlike other Pt/3d systems.

4. Based on the binding energies, it is predicted that PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should display greater hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1).

5. Despite its low activity, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst still shows a preference for partial hydrogenation to produce butenes.

[C1] "The binding energies of the adsorbates are found to correlate with the hydrogenation activity, allowing for use of such correlation to potentially predict hydrogenation catalysts with enhanced activity based on the binding energies of the adsorbates of interest."

[C5] "Unlike other Pt/3d systems, the subsurface PtCuPt(1 1 1) and surface CuPtPt(1 1 1) structures bind 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen with very similar binding energies."
[C6] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity."
[C7] "The normalized rate constants obtained from batch reactor studies and the conversion obtained from flow reactor studies both show PtCo/-Al2O3 to be the most active bimetallic catalyst, with PtNi/-Al2O3 being the second most active, for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation."

1. The experimental techniques like HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques allow researchers to examine the changes in surface composition and structure that occur upon exposure to oxygen. The kinetics and activation barriers for these processes are compared with DFT predictions, which helps validate the theoretical models and provides insights into the mechanisms driving the segregation.

2. The DFT calculations show that the binding energies of adsorbates on different bimetallic surfaces correlate with their hydrogenation activity. This correlation allows for predicting the activity of hydrogenation catalysts based on the binding energies of the adsorbates of interest. The surfaces that bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly are expected to exhibit higher hydrogenation activity.

The activation barriers for the transformation between subsurface and surface structures in PtNiPt(1 1 1) and PtCoPt(1 1 1) systems are 15 kcal/mol and 7 kcal/mol, respectively. This indicates that the 3d-metal atoms, particularly Ni and Co, can diffuse and segregate during calcination, reduction, and under reaction conditions.

[1] "Through both experimental and theoretical studies, it has been observed that the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure is stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen [22], however, if this surface is exposed to oxygen, the 3d-metal atoms segregate to the surface to create the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structure [19,26]."

The experimental techniques of HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods reveal that when exposed to oxygen, the 3d-metal atoms (Ni and Co) segregate to the surface, creating a 3dPtPt(111) structure. This process occurs with a relatively low activation barrier of 15 kcal/mol for PtNiPt(111) and 7 kcal/mol for PtCoPt(111). In situ studies on both poly-crystalline foils and supported catalysts show that Ni atoms in Pt/Ni catalysts segregate from the subsurface to the surface in the presence of oxygen, reversing the process when hydrogen is present. This indicates that 3d-metal atoms can diffuse and segregate during calcination and reduction procedures, as well as under reaction conditions, which is in line with DFT predictions for these systems.

HREELS和AES实验技术验证并量化了在氧化物诱导下，Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中亚表面3d原子（尤其是Ni和Co）的表面聚集。这些方法表明，在暴露于氧气的情况下，3d金属原子（Ni和Co）会聚集到表面，形成3dPtPt(111)结构。这一过程的活化能壁垒相对较低，分别为15 kcal/mol（对于PtNiPt(111)）和7 kcal/mol（对于PtCoPt(111)）。在聚晶箔材和支持催化剂的原位研究中，发现当存在氧气时，Pt/Ni催化剂中的Ni原子从亚表面向表面聚集，而在氢气存在的情况下则发生相反的过程。这表明3d金属原子在煅烧、还原过程中以及在反应条件下可以扩散并聚集，这与对这些系统的DFT预测相吻合。

To verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, researchers typically employ advanced techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). These techniques provide detailed information about the chemical composition and bonding environment of the surface atoms, enabling scientists to track the segregation kinetics and activation barriers associated with the transition between subsurface and surface structures.

The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can then be compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. This comparison helps to validate the theoretical models and offers insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the structural and catalytic properties of these bimetallic systems. By integrating experimental observations with theoretical calculations, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems under various conditions and optimize their performance for specific applications.
