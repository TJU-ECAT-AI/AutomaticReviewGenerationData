[1] "Early findings have illustrated that the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts can be tuned by adjusting the relative amounts of the two metals [1]."
[2] "The 3d-metal atoms may diffuse and segregate during calcination and reduction procedures as well as under reaction conditions."
[3] "The binding energies of the adsorbates are found to correlate with the hydrogenation activity, allowing for use of such correlation to potentially predict hydrogenation catalysts with enhanced activity based on the binding energies of the adsorbates of interest."
[4] "Fig. 7 shows the results of DFT calculations of the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on several Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding energies are plotted versus the surface d-band center, which has been found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces [6]."

To verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, researchers typically employ advanced techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). These techniques provide detailed information about the chemical composition and bonding environment of the surface atoms, enabling scientists to track the segregation kinetics and activation barriers associated with the transition between subsurface and surface structures.

The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can then be compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. This comparison helps to validate the theoretical models and offers insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the structural and catalytic properties of these bimetallic systems. By integrating experimental observations with theoretical calculations, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems under various conditions and optimize their performance for specific applications.
