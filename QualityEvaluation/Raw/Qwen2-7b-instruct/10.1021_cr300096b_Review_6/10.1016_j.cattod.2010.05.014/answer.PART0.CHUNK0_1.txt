[C1] "The binding energies of the adsorbates are found to correlate with the hydrogenation activity, allowing for use of such correlation to potentially predict hydrogenation catalysts with enhanced activity based on the binding energies of the adsorbates of interest."
[C2] "Fig. 7 shows the results of DFT calculations of the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on several Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces."
[C3] "The binding energies are plotted versus the surface d-band center, which has been found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces."
[C4] "In comparison, CoPtPt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface structures, with the surface d-band center being closest to the Fermi level among all the systems in Fig. 7, bind both adsorbates most strongly."
[C5] "Unlike other Pt/3d systems, the subsurface PtCuPt(1 1 1) and surface CuPtPt(1 1 1) structures bind 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen with very similar binding energies."
[C6] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity."
[C7] "The normalized rate constants obtained from batch reactor studies and the conversion obtained from flow reactor studies both show PtCo/-Al2O3 to be the most active bimetallic catalyst, with PtNi/-Al2O3 being the second most active, for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation."
[C8] "However, based on the binding energies Fig. 7 also predicts that PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should display greater hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1)."

1. The experimental techniques like HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques allow researchers to examine the changes in surface composition and structure that occur upon exposure to oxygen. The kinetics and activation barriers for these processes are compared with DFT predictions, which helps validate the theoretical models and provides insights into the mechanisms driving the segregation.

2. The DFT calculations show that the binding energies of adsorbates on different bimetallic surfaces correlate with their hydrogenation activity. This correlation allows for predicting the activity of hydrogenation catalysts based on the binding energies of the adsorbates of interest. The surfaces that bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly are expected to exhibit higher hydrogenation activity.

1. 实验技术如HREELS和AES被用来验证并量化在暴露于氧气后，Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面聚集。这些技术允许研究者检查表面组成和结构的变化。对于这些过程的反应动力学和活化能与DFT预测进行比较，这有助于验证理论模型，并提供驱动聚集机制的见解。

2. DFT计算表明吸附剂在不同双金属表面的结合能与其氢化活性相关。这种相关性使得根据感兴趣的吸附剂的结合能预测氢化催化剂的活性成为可能。预计结合氢和烯烃较弱的表面将表现出更高的氢化活性。
