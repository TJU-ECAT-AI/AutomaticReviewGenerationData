[C1] "Fig. 7 shows the results of DFT calculations of the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on several Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding energies are plotted ver- sus the surface d-band center, which has been found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces [6]."
[C2] "Many research groups have been able to linearly correlate the bind- ing energies of small molecules to the d-band center of various monometallic and bimetallic surfaces [9,21]. In Fig. 7, the binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."
[C3] "It is also interest to note that, unlike other Pt/3d systems,the subsurface PtCuPt(1 1 1) and surface CuPtPt(1 1 1) struc- tures bind 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen with very similar binding energies."
[C4] "However, based on the binding energies Fig. 7 also predicts that PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should display greater hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1)."
[C5] "Despite its low activity, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst displays a preference toward partial hydrogenation to pro- duce butenes."

1. HREELS and AES techniques are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measurements reveal the kinetics and activation barriers of this segregation process, which are then compared with DFT predictions.

2. The binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are plotted against the surface d-band center, which is found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies correlate well with the d-band center, with the weakest binding energies observed on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures.

3. Interestingly, the subsurface PtCuPt(1 1 1) and surface CuPtPt(1 1 1) structures exhibit similar binding energies for 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen, unlike other Pt/3d systems.

4. Based on the binding energies, it is predicted that PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should display greater hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1).

5. Despite its low activity, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst still shows a preference for partial hydrogenation to produce butenes.

1.HREELS和AES技术用于验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中由氧气诱导的亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）的表面分层。测量揭示了分层过程的动力学和激活壁垒，然后与DFT预测进行了比较。

2.在Pt3dPt(1 1 1)和3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面上，1,3-丁二烯和原子氢的结合能被绘制在表面d带中心上，发现这是描述双金属表面电子性质的一个有用的描述符。结合能与d带中心相关性良好，亚表面PtCoPt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1)结构上的结合能最弱。

3.有趣的是，亚表面PtCuPt(1 1 1)和表面CuPtPt(1 1 1)结构对1,3-丁二烯和氢的结合能表现出相似性，不同于其他Pt/3d系统。

4.根据结合能，预测PtCuPt(1 1 1)和CuPtPt(1 1 1)的氢化活性高于Pt(1 1 1)。

5.尽管活性较低，但PtCu/-Al2O3催化剂仍显示出偏爱部分氢化以产生但烯。
