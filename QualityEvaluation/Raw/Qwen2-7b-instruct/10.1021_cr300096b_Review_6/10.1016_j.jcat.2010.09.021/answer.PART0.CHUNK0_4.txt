1. The hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) often produces by-products like hydrocinnamaldehyde (HALD) and hydrocinnamal alcohol (HALC), which is due to the thermodynamically favorable hydrogenation of CC double bonds in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Additionally, in many instances, larger quantities of acetals and other unidentified high molecular weight compounds might be produced.

2. Metal promoters such as Gallium (Ga), Cobalt (Co), and Ruthenium (Ru) have been reported to play a critical role in the hydrogenation of CALD when present alongside supported platinum nanoparticles. This is because of the synergistic interactions between the platinum active sites and the promoters.

3. In this research, a facile microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) method was utilized to synthesize platinum-based bimetallic catalysts that demonstrated high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of CALD, surpassing those catalysts made through the conventional impregnation method (IMP). The study also explored the effects of pretreating the multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) support surfaces, the use of different solvents, and the introduction of transition metal (metal oxide) promoters on the catalytic performance of the bimetallic catalysts.

4. The catalysts prepared in this study exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity when ethyl acetate (EA) was used as the solvent, contrasting with the commonly used solvents such as alcohols and alkanes.

5. Compared to the conventional impregnation method, the MAPR technique preserved the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT and ensured a close contact between the promoters and the platinum nanoparticles, such as metal-metal electronic interaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of the platinum active sites.

1. CALD的氢化往往会产生副产物，如HALD和HALC，这是由于α，β不饱和醛类中CC双键的热力学有利氢化。此外，在许多情况下，还可能产生大量乙酰化物和其他未知高分子量化合物。

2. 已有报道指出，镓（Ga）、钴（Co）和钌（Ru）等金属促进剂在支持型铂纳米粒子存在的条件下对CALD的氢化起着至关重要的作用，这是因为铂活性位点与促进剂之间的协同作用。

3. 在这项研究中，通过简便的微波辅助聚醇还原法（MAPR）方法制备了铂基双金属催化剂，这些催化剂在CALD氢化中的活性和选择性较高，超过了通过常规浸渍法合成的催化剂。研究还探讨了多壁碳纳米管（CNT）支撑表面的预处理、溶剂的使用以及过渡金属（金属氧化物）促进剂对双金属催化剂催化性能的影响。

4. 这些催化剂在乙酸乙酯（EA）作为溶剂时表现出极高的活性和选择性，这与通常使用的醇类和烷烃类溶剂形成了对比。

5. 相比于传统的浸渍法，MAPR技术保留了CNT的疏水表面特性，并确保了促进剂和铂纳米颗粒之间（如金属-金属电子相互作用）的紧密接触，从而显著提高了铂活性位点的催化性能。
