[1] "In this contribution, we apply this facile MAPR method to prepare Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with high activity and selectivity for CALD hydrogenation, superior to those catalysts synthesized by the conventional IMP method."
[2] "We also apply the electrochemistry measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and CO stripping to identify the nature of as-prepared bimetallic catalysts."
[3] "It is revealed that different from IMP method, MAPR retains the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT and affords close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, e.g., metalmetal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic performance of Pt active sites."
[4] "Interestingly, other than generally adopted solvents such as alcohols [1] ,[2] and alkanes [14] , the as-prepared catalysts in this study showed remarkably high activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent."

1. The facile MAPR method was utilized to prepare Pt-based bimetallic catalysts that exhibit higher activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) compared to catalysts synthesized through the conventional impregnation method (IMP).
2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and CO stripping techniques were employed to analyze the characteristics of the synthesized bimetallic catalysts.
3. The MAPR method retains the hydrophobic surface properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and facilitates close contact between promoters and platinum nanoparticles, enhancing the catalytic properties of the platinum active sites through metal-metal electronic interactions.
4. The as-prepared catalysts demonstrated exceptional activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate (EA) as a solvent, rather than commonly used solvents like alcohols and alkanes.

1. 简单的MAPR方法被用来制备铂基双金属催化剂，在CALD氢化方面比通过传统浸渍法（IMP）合成的催化剂具有更高的活性和选择性。
2. 使用循环伏安法（CV）和CO剥离技术来分析合成的双金属催化剂的特性。
3. MAPR方法保留了多壁碳纳米管（CNT）的疏水表面性质，并使促进剂与铂纳米粒子之间形成紧密接触，通过金属-金属电子相互作用显著提高了铂活性位点的催化性能。
4. 合成的催化剂在乙酸乙酯（EA）作为溶剂的情况下表现出极高的活性和选择性，而不是通常使用的醇类和烷烃类溶剂。
