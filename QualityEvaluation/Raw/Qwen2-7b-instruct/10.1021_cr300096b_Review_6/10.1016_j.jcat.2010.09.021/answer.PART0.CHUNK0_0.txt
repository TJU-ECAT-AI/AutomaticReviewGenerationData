<p>It is revealed that different from IMP method, MAPR retains the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT and affords close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, e.g., metalmetal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic performance of Pt active sites.</p>
<p>Interestingly, other than generally adopted solvents such as alcohols [1] ,[2] and alkanes [14] , the as-prepared catalysts in this study showed remarkably high activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent.</p>

1. The microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) method retains the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT, leading to close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, specifically through metal-metal electronic interactions, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance of Pt active sites.
2. The as-prepared catalysts demonstrated remarkable activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent, beyond the typical solvents like alcohols and alkanes used in previous studies.

1. 微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR）方法保留了CNT的疏水表面特性，导致促进剂与Pt纳米粒子之间的紧密接触，特别是通过金属-金属电子相互作用，显著提高了Pt活性位点的催化性能。
2. 所制备的催化剂在乙酸乙酯（EA）作为溶剂的情况下显示出惊人的活性和选择性，超越了以往研究中使用的典型溶剂如醇类和烷烃。
