The study found that ethyl acetate (EA) as a solvent improved the catalytic activity and selectivity of the prepared Pt-based bimetallic catalysts on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT). The MAPR method retained the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT, allowing for close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles. This resulted in significant improvements in the catalytic performance of the Pt active sites. Additionally, the study utilized a variety of characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), competitive hydrogenations of toluene and benzene, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and CO stripping, to probe the electron density of the Pt nanoparticles and identify the nature of the bimetallic catalysts.

本研究发现，乙酸乙酯（EA）作为溶剂可以提高制备的铂基双金属催化剂在多壁碳纳米管（CNT）上的催化活性和选择性。MAPR方法保留了CNT的疏水表面特性，使得促进剂与Pt纳米粒子之间的接触更加紧密。这显著提高了Pt活性位点的催化性能。此外，该研究利用多种表征技术，包括X射线衍射（XRD）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、对甲苯和苯的竞争氢化、循环伏安法（CV）和CO剥离，来探查Pt纳米颗粒的电子密度并识别双金属催化剂的性质。
