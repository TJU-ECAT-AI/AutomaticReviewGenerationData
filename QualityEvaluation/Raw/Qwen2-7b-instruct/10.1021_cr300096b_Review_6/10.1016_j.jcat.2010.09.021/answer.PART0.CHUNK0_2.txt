2.1. "The as-prepared catalysts in this study showed remarkably high activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent."
2.2. "Interestingly, other than generally adopted solvents such as alcohols [1] ,[2] and alkanes [14] , the as-prepared catalysts in this study showed remarkably high activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent."
2.3. "It is revealed that different from IMP method, MAPR retains the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT and affords close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, e.g., metalmetal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic performance of Pt active sites."

1. The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES did not directly verify or quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems mentioned in the provided literature. The document focuses on the synthesis and catalytic application of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, rather than discussing the specific techniques of HREELS and AES in the context of oxygen-induced surface segregation.

2. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for the subsurface 3d atoms in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are not presented or discussed in the provided literature. The document provides details on the synthesis of the catalysts, their characterization, and their catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, but does not delve into the specifics of oxygen-induced surface segregation or the kinetics and activation barriers associated with it.

3. The document does not provide information on how DFT predictions compare with the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for the subsurface 3d atoms in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The focus is on the development and evaluation of the catalysts for a specific chemical reaction, not on the theoretical comparisons related to surface segregation and activation barriers.

1. 文献中没有直接验证或量化氧诱导表面分离在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的具体技术，如HREELS和AES。本文主要关注在多壁碳纳米管（CNT）上合成铂基双金属催化剂，并用于选择性氢化肉桂醛，而不是讨论在特定化学背景下HREELS和AES与氧诱导表面分离的相关性。

2. 文献中未提供对位于Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的亚表面3d原子的分离动力学和激活势垒的测量。本文提供了催化剂的合成、表征及其在选择性氢化肉桂醛方面的性能信息，但并未深入探讨与表面分离和激活势垒相关的具体细节。

3. 文献中没有提供关于DFT预测与亚表面3d原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的分离动力学和激活势垒之间的比较信息。本文的重点是开发和评估用于特定化学反应的催化剂，而不是涉及表面分离和激活势垒的理论比较。
