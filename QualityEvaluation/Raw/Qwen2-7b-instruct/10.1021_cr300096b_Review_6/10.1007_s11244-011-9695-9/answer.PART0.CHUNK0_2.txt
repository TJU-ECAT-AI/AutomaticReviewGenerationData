<p>From the provided literature, there are no direct quotes that specifically address the experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor do they compare the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions.</p>
