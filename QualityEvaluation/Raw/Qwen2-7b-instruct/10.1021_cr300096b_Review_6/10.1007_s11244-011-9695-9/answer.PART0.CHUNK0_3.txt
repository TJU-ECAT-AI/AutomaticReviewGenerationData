The experimental techniques used to characterize the catalysts included transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) for imaging the catalyst particles, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) for structural characterization, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for surface chemistry analysis, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) for determining the oxidation states of the catalyst components under reaction conditions. The catalysts were tested in a steel tubular plug flow reactor under specific gas conditions, achieving CO2 conversions of 5% except in specified circumstances. Environmental TEM was utilized to examine the catalysts under a flowing gas mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. These methods collectively provided insights into the structure, composition, and reactivity of the catalysts during CO2 hydrogenation processes.
