<p>The ambient pressure XPS results are presented in Fig. 6a which shows Pt 4f XP spectra of a 4 nm Pt50Co50 sample for three different incident photon energies. Since the detected electrons have different kinetic energies the spectra correspond to different probing depths within the particleincident photon energies of 250, 350 and 630 eV corresponding to 0.48, 0.58 and 0.90 nm respectively (relative to a particle radius of 2 nm [20]). Hence, from comparison of the 250 eV spectrum (purple) and 350 eV spectrum (green), their similar intensity means that a sub-surface region between 0.48 and 0.58 nm from the surface is entirely Pt deficientthe difference in number of atoms probed being 1520%, which would clearly be discernable by XPS. By comparing the three spectra and calculating the fraction of atoms being probed in each case it is possible to estimate the % Pt present in each layer of the particle (58% in the first two atomic layers, 8% in the next subsurface layer and 62% in the inner layers below this). On this basis the most likely physical model is that shown in Fig. 6b where the Pt segregates to the surface from the subsurface region, the red shell and subsurface blue regions being very clearly distinct.</p>

<p>Environmental TEM (although using larger 11 nm Pt50Co50 nanoparticles) is also indicative of exactly the same phenomenon. The STEM dark field (i.e. Z-contrast) image in Fig. 7 shows bright surface and core regions, and a dark interlayer structure sandwiched between the core and surface. When considering the image, it must be remembered that it is a 2D projection of a 3D particle in which the central region contains many more atoms when electrons are transmitted through the sample. It clearly indicates enrichment of the higher Z-component Pt (Z = 78) on the surface regions, which would otherwise be expected to be darker rather than brighter as fewer atoms are sample near the edges of the particle. The lower Z-component Co (Z = 27) is, on the other hand, enriched in the layers just below the surface (the darker layer).</p>

The ambient pressure XPS results indicate that in the Pt50Co50 nanoparticles, Pt segregates to the surface from the subsurface region. Specifically, the Pt is present in the top two atomic layers (58% of the total atoms), the next subsurface layer contains 8% of the Pt, and the inner layers below this contain 62% of the Pt. This leads to a clear model where Pt is enriched at the surface, with Co being enriched in the layers just below the surface. Environmental TEM also supports this finding, showing a bright surface region with a dark interlayer structure, indicating the segregation of Pt to the surface and Co in the subsurface layers.

在Pt50Co50纳米颗粒中，XPS结果表明，Pt从次表面区域迁移到了表面。具体来说，Pt存在于顶部两层原子（总原子的58%），下一个次表面层包含总原子的8%，而内部层以下包含总原子的62%。这导致了一个清晰的模型，其中Pt集中在表面，Co集中在表面下方的层中。环境透射电子显微镜也支持这一发现，显示了一个明亮的表面区域和一个较暗的中间层结构，表明Pt向表面迁移以及Co在表面下方的层中的富集。
