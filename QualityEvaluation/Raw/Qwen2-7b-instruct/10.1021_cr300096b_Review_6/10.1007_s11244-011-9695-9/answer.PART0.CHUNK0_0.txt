[1] "The experimental techniques utilized include HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) to quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems."
[2] "These techniques have enabled the researchers to measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which have been compared against DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions."

The experimental methods of HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods allow for the measurement of the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which are then compared to predictions made through DFT calculations.
