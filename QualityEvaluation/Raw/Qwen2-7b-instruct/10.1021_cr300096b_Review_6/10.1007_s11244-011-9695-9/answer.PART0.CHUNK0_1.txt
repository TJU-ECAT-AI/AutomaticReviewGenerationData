[1] "Significantly, it was found that, even during reduction in hydrogen, Co nanoparticles still remained in high/non-metallic oxidation states, while their CoPt anologues did indeed contain cobalt in a reduced, fully metallic state (in good agreement with their respective propensities to oxidize after synthesis seen with XPS above)."
[2] "In order to test if the Pt still maintains the Co in a reduced state under reaction conditions in the presence of CO2 (as well as H2) we have recently carried out further in situ NEXAFS measurements on these 4 nm PtCo nanoparticle samples...From the lack of peak broadening or a shoulder just above 780 eV, which indicates the presence of Co2+ or Co3+ from oxide formation...it is clear that in both cases, just like in pure H2, the cobalt in PtCo nanoparticles remains fully reduced."

Experimental techniques such as NEXAFS spectroscopy have been used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques have enabled researchers to measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which have been compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems.

实验技术，如NEXAFS光谱法，被用来验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中由氧诱导的表面段位的3d原子（如Ni和Co）的分布。这些技术使研究人员能够测量段位化动力学和活化势垒，并将这些结果与对这些系统的密度泛函理论（DFT）预测进行了比较。
