Experimental verification of surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems due to oxygen exposure involves utilizing techniques such as high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). HREELS monitors the segregation of Ni and Co atoms within the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configurations when oxygen is introduced. AES measures the AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt to track the exchange between the subsurface and surface structures following oxygen exposure. It is noted that the AES Ni/Pt ratio rises after exposing the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure to varying levels of oxygen at different temperatures. Analysis of the collected data through an Arrhenius equation leads to the estimation of activation barriers for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni, which are approximately 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively. These values align with the predictions made by density functional theory (DFT).

表面在氧暴露下发生迁移的实验验证涉及到使用高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和电子能谱（AES）技术。当氧气被引入时，HREELS用于监测Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构中的Ni和Co原子的迁移。AES通过测量Co/Pt或Ni/Pt的AES强度比来追踪氧气暴露后亚表面与表面结构之间的交换。注意到在不同温度下暴露于不同量氧气后的亚表面PtNiPt(111)结构，AES Ni/Pt比值会增加。通过对收集的数据进行Arrhenius方程分析得到，Co和Ni的氧诱导迁移激活能约为7  1和15  2 kcal/mol。这些值与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测相符。
