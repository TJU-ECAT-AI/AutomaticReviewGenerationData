Experimental verification of surface segregation involves the use of techniques like high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). HREELS monitors the segregation of Ni and Co in the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration upon exposure to oxygen. AES measures the intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt to track the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures post-oxygen exposure. An increase in the normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio, as depicted in Figure 7a, confirms the oxygen-induced segregation of Ni atoms. The activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni, estimated using an Arrhenius equation, are 7 ± 1 and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol, respectively. These values align with the DFT predictions for these systems.

实验验证表面掺杂涉及技术如高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS）和俄歇电子光谱（AES）。HREELS用于监测在氧气暴露下，Pt3dPt(111)亚表面配置中Ni和Co的掺杂。AES通过测量Co/Pt或Ni/Pt的强度比来跟踪氧气暴露后亚表面和表面结构之间的交换。图7a中归一化的AES Ni/Pt比率的增加证实了Ni原子的氧气诱导掺杂。使用Arrhenius方程分析数据得到的Co和Ni的氧诱导掺杂的活化能分别为7±1和15±2 kcal/mol。这些值与这些系统的DFT预测相匹配。
