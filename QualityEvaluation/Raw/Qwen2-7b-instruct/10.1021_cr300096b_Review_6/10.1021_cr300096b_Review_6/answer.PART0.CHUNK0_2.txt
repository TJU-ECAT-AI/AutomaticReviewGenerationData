Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS monitors the segregation of Ni and Co when exposed to oxygen, while AES measures the intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt to track the interchange between subsurface and surface structures after oxygen exposure. The AES Ni/Pt ratio increases after exposing subsurface PtNiPt(111) to varying amounts of oxygen at different temperatures. Activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni are estimated using an Arrhenius equation, with values of 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively. These measured values align with the DFT predictions for these systems.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，用于验证和量化在氧存在下Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分离。当暴露于氧气时，HREELS监测Ni和Co的分离。而AES通过测量Co/Pt或Ni/Pt的强度比来跟踪在氧气暴露后的亚表面与表面结构之间的交换。在不同温度下暴露于不同量的氧气后，AES的Ni/Pt比率增加。使用Arrhenius方程分析数据，对于Co和Ni的氧诱导分离，其激活壁垒分别估计为7  1和15  2 kcal/mol。这些测量值与这些系统的DFT预测相一致。
