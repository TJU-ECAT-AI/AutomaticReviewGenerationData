Experimental verification of surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems due to oxygen exposure involves utilizing techniques such as high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). HREELS monitors the segregation of Ni and Co atoms within the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configurations when oxygen is introduced. AES measures the AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt to track the exchange between the subsurface and surface structures following oxygen exposure. It is noted that the AES Ni/Pt ratio rises after exposing the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure to varying levels of oxygen at different temperatures. Analysis of the collected data through an Arrhenius equation leads to the estimation of activation barriers for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni, which are approximately 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively. These values align with the predictions made by density functional theory (DFT).

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have been employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS monitors the segregation of Ni and Co through the detection of their characteristic vibrational modes upon exposure to oxygen. AES measurements quantify the segregation kinetics by monitoring the AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt, which reflect the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after oxygen exposure. The normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases with higher oxygen exposures, confirming the segregation of subsurface Ni atoms. Activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni, estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol respectively, are determined using an Arrhenius equation analysis, aligning with the DFT predictions.
