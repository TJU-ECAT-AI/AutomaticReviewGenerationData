3.2 Experimental Verification of Surface Segregation
"HREELS has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen."
"In addition, AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics. The AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt were used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen."
"Figure 7a shows that the normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases after exposing subsurface PtNiPt(111) to increasing amounts of oxygen at various temperatures."
"Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data, such as that shown in Figure 7b, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have been employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS monitors the segregation of Ni and Co through the detection of their characteristic vibrational modes upon exposure to oxygen. AES measurements quantify the segregation kinetics by monitoring the AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt, which reflect the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after oxygen exposure. The normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases with higher oxygen exposures, confirming the segregation of subsurface Ni atoms. Activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni, estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol respectively, are determined using an Arrhenius equation analysis, aligning with the DFT predictions.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，被用来验证和量化在氧气作用下Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中次表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。通过检测Ni和Co在氧气暴露下的特征振动模式，HREELS监测了它们的分层情况。AES测量通过监测Co/Pt或Ni/Pt的AES强度比来量化分层动力学，反映氧气暴露后表面结构与次表面结构之间的交换。随着氧气浓度的增加，归一化的AES Ni/Pt比值增加，证实了次表面Ni原子的分层。使用Arrhenius方程分析数据，估计Co和Ni的氧诱导分层激活能分别为7  1和15  2 kcal/mol，与DFT预测相吻合。
