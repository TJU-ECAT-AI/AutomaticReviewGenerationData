Experimental techniques such as high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) have been utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS monitors the segregation of Ni and Co in the subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen, while AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt were used to track the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after oxygen exposure. The normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases following exposure to varying amounts of oxygen, confirming the segregation of subsurface Ni atoms. The activation barriers for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni, estimated using an Arrhenius equation, were determined to be 7 ± 1 and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol, respectively. These values align with the DFT predictions for these systems.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和原子发射光谱（AES），被用来验证并量化氧诱导表面相分离，特别是在铂-3d-铂(111)双金属体系中，特别是镍和钴原子在暴露于氧气时的相分离。当暴露于氧气时，HREELS监测Ni和Co在亚表面配置中的相分离。而AES的Co/Pt或Ni/Pt强度比则用于跟踪暴露于氧气后亚表面与表面结构之间的交换。随着氧气量的增加，亚表面PtNiPt(111)的正常化AES Ni/Pt比值增加，证实了亚表面Ni原子的相分离。通过Arrhenius方程分析数据，估计Co和Ni的氧诱导相分离的活化能分别为7±1和15±2 kcal/mol。这些值与这些系统预测的DFT结果一致。
