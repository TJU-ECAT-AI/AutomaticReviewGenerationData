[1] "Ab initio methods can be used to elucidate the nature of active sites as well as the influence of the surrounding environment on catalytic kinetics."
[2] "Theory can be coupled with atomic scale simulation in order to track the molecular transformations that occur over different surfaces and assess their catalytic activity and selectivity."
[3] "The results for NO decomposition under lean conditions show how density functional theory calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation can used to begin to tailor the metals that are used, the alloy composition, and the specific atomic arrangements at the surface in order to optimize catalytic performance."
[4] "Alloying Pt with nearly 50% Au leads to turnover rates that are nearly four times larger than Pt surface alone."
[5] "The specific arrangement of Pt and Au create special Pt +-site ensembles that reduce surface poisoning by oxygen."
[6] "The presence of solution significantly alters the overall reaction energies by stabilizing charged complexes that form."
[7] "The presence of solution drives the heterolytic activation of CH and OH bonds over Pt rather than the homolytic activation thus leading to the generation of protons in the aqueous media."
[8] "These effects are found to be quite important in the electrochemical phase behavior of water over Pt."
[9] "The results show that at the ideal low coverage conditions there is a considerable degree of structure sensitivity."
[10] "The openness of the surface as well as the presence of step edges lower the activation barrier for direct NO dissociation."
[11] "At higher coverages the number of vacant sites necessary for NO dissociation becomes increasingly fewer thus limiting this path."
[12] "Quantum mechanical calculations were carried out in a similar fashion for all of the steps in Eqs."
[13] "The algorithm described below uses a variable time step approach that proceeds step-by-step in event space in order to simulate the system's kinetics."
[14] "Steady state simulations were carried out at different temperatures in order to calculate the apparent activation barriers."
[15] "Similar simulations were carried out over the Rh(1 0 0) surface. Rh, however, was poisoned by strongly adsorbed oxygen."
[16] "The typical solution to avoid poisoning of the surface by the reaction products is to alloy it with a more inert metal."
[17] "Theory and simulation have been used to help elucidate individual features for ideal surfaces and how they influence the behavior at the anode as well as the cathode."
[18] "Despite the complexity, theory and simulation have been used to help elucidate individual features for ideal surfaces and how they influence the behavior at the anode as well as the cathode."
[19] "The fundamental differences between the vapor- and aqueous-phase environments are established in the computational models utilized for these two systems."
[20] "The potential was calculated by the method described above for both the pure over Pt(1 1 1) system(circles) and the hydroxylated surface system which involves a single water molecule dissociated at the surface into an adsorbed OH and a solvated proton (squares)."
[21] "Structural parameters for the closest-bound molecule on Pt(1 1 1) as a function of external surface charge and resulting calculated potential are listed in Table 3."
[22] "The distance from the surface (determined by the location of the O atom) for the system is about from the surface, similar to other DFT studies of adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) ( Filhol and Neurock, 2004 , Weaver, 1998 )."

1. The oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems can be verified and quantified using experimental techniques like HREELS (High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). These techniques measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which can then be compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems.

2. The literature does not provide specific details on how HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, it suggests that these experimental techniques can be used to gather data on the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which can then be compared with DFT predictions.

3. The literature discusses the use of computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) to predict the behavior of catalysts and their active sites. It does not provide information on how these methods are specifically applied to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems using HREELS and AES.
