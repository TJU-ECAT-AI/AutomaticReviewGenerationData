Answer: 
1. Although significant progress has been achieved in both fundamental research and practical applications, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding of the direct NO decomposition mechanism under lean conditions. No major breakthroughs have been made in the design of catalytic materials for this purpose. Lean decomposition is thus a key focus for high-throughput efforts, aiming to explore various aspects like the metals used, alloy compositions, and atomic structures that affect catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. The integration of theoretical approaches and simulations is expected to support these efforts, although the pace is likely to be slower compared to experimental methods. Researchers have employed theoretical calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how factors such as the choice of metals, alloy formation, and surface structure influence the catalytic performance of materials for NO decomposition under lean conditions.

Answer: 
1. 尽管在基础研究和实际应用方面取得了显著进展，但对于稀薄条件下直接NO分解的机制仍然缺乏全面的理解。在催化材料设计方面的重大突破尚未出现。因此，对稀薄分解的高通量研究成为重点，旨在探索诸如所用金属、合金组成和表面结构等对催化活性和选择性的影响。

2. 理论方法与模拟的结合有望支持这些努力，尽管与实验方法相比，其进展速度可能会较慢。研究人员已使用理论计算和动力学蒙特卡洛模拟来研究在NO分解下如何影响材料的催化性能的因素，如所选金属、合金形成以及表面结构。
