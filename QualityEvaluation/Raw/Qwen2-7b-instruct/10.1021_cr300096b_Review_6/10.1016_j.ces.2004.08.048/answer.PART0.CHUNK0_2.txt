1. "Computational chemistry has reached the stage where it can be used to model the atomic structure along with the local molecular topography about a proposed active site and establish its influence on the catalytic reactivity."
2. "The results for NO decomposition under lean conditions show how density functional theory calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation can used to begin to tailor the metals that are used, the alloy composition, and the specific atomic arrangements at the surface in order to optimize catalytic performance."
3. "The presence of solution significantly alters the overall reaction energies by stabilizing charged complexes that form. The presence of solution drives the heterolytic activation of CH and OH bonds over Pt rather than the homolytic activation thus leading to the generation of protons in the aqueous media."
4. "Theory and simulation can begin to complement these efforts but will still likely proceed at a significantly slower rate. We have coupled theoretical results along with ab initio-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulation algorithms to computationally explore how changes in the metals used, the composition of alloys formed, and even the atomic structure of the alloy influence the resulting catalytic activity and selectivity for this system."
5. "The results show that at the ideal low coverage conditions there is a considerable degree of structure sensitivity. The DFT calculated results for NO activation compare quite favorably with experimental results carried out at ultrahigh vacuum conditions as is seen in Fig. 1 ."
6. "The openness of the surface as well as the presence of step edges lower the activation barrier for direct NO dissociation. The results suggest that the specific atomic arrangement at the active site has the greatest impact on the calculated barriers."
7. "Quantum mechanical calculations were carried out in a similar fashion for all of the steps in Eqs. (1) - (10) . The resulting activation barriers for the forward and reverse elementary reaction paths as well as the pre-exponential factors (or sticking coefficients) are tabulated in Table 2 ."
8. "We carried out simulations over the active 1 0 0 facets of Pt and PtAu alloys at conditions that mimic those for lean burn. The temperature was chosen to be 713.5 K with ."
9. "Despite these kinetic differences, the simulations correctly predict that the reaction is nearly first order in NO and negative half order in oxygen."
10. "The DFT results presented above for Pt were used along with bond-order conservation estimates to determine the energies (and kinetics) over different PtAu alloys."
11. "The well-dispersed alloy presented third from the top in the Fig. 5 shows a small increase in the turnover frequency along with an increase in the selectivity."
12. "Despite the complexity, theory and simulation have been used to help elucidate individual features for ideal surfaces and how they influence the behavior at the anode as well as the cathode."
13. "The fundamental differences between the vapor- and aqueous-phase environments are established in the computational models utilized for these two systems."
14. "The energy required to remove from the complex into the solution phase is estimated to be between +30 to +70 kJ/mol, depending on the nature of the surface-adsorbate electronic structure."
15. "As we move toward more positive potentials, the molecule is attracted closer to the surface thus decreasing the Pt bond distance ( Table 3 )."
16. "The potential was calculated by the method described above for both the pure over Pt(1 1 1) system (circles) and the hydroxylated surface system which involves a single water molecule dissociated at the surface into an adsorbed OH and a solvated proton (squares)."
