1. "Theory and simulation can begin to complement fundamental experimental efforts in elucidating the mechanisms that control metal catalyzed reactions and the nanoscale features of the catalyst that dictate its reactivity."
2. "The decomposition of NO is quite sensitive to the nature of the active site. The four fold site on the reconstructed Pt(1 0 0) surface is quite unique in terms of its activity."
3. "The fundamental energetics for methanol decomposition over Pt(1 1 1) in both the vapor and liquid phase is important toward understanding the chemistry that occurs at the anode."

1. Theory and simulation can help explain the factors that control metal-catalyzed reactions and the microscopic aspects of the catalyst that influence its reactivity.
2. The decomposition of NO is highly sensitive to the characteristics of the active site, with the fourfold site on the reconstructed Pt(1 0 0) surface being particularly active.
3. Understanding the energetics involved in methanol decomposition over Pt(1 1 1) in vapor and liquid phases is crucial for comprehending the anode's chemistry.
