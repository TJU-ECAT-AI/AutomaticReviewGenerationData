[1] "Despite the substantial progress that has been made from both fundamental and applied efforts, there is still an incomplete understanding of the mechanism for direct NO decomposition under lean conditions and no breakthrough discoveries in catalytic materials design."
[2] "Lean decomposition has therefore become an important target for high-throughput efforts (Busch et al., 2002; Ozturk, 2002 , Richter et al., 2002 )."
[3] "Theory and simulation can begin to complement these efforts but will still likely proceed at a significantly slower rate."
[4] "We have coupled theoretical results along with ab initio-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulation algorithms to computationally explore how changes in the metals used, the composition of alloys formed, and even the atomic structure of the alloy influence the resulting catalytic activity and selectivity for this system."
[5] "Alloying Pt with nearly 50% Au leads to turnover rates that are nearly four times larger than Pt surface alone."
[6] "The specific arrangement of Pt and Au create special Pt +-site ensembles that reduce surface poisoning by oxygen."
[7] "In the second example, we describe the elementary pathways for methanol decomposition to CO in both the vapor as well as the liquid phase."
[8] "The presence of solution significantly alters the overall reaction energies by stabilizing charged complexes that form."
[9] "The presence of solution drives the heterolytic activation of CH and OH bonds over Pt rather than the homolytic activation thus leading to the generation of protons in the aqueous media."
[10] "An external potential can be applied in order to model electrochemical systems."
[11] "These effects are found to be quite important in the electrochemical phase behavior of water over Pt."

Answer: 
1. Although significant progress has been achieved in both fundamental research and practical applications, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding of the direct NO decomposition mechanism under lean conditions. No major breakthroughs have been made in the design of catalytic materials for this purpose. Lean decomposition is thus a key focus for high-throughput efforts, aiming to explore various aspects like the metals used, alloy compositions, and atomic structures that affect catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. The integration of theoretical approaches and simulations is expected to support these efforts, although the pace is likely to be slower compared to experimental methods. Researchers have employed theoretical calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how factors such as the choice of metals, alloy formation, and surface structure influence the catalytic performance of materials for NO decomposition under lean conditions.

Answer: 
1. 尽管在基础研究和实际应用方面取得了显著进展，但对于稀薄条件下直接NO分解的机制仍然缺乏全面的理解。在催化材料设计方面的重大突破尚未出现。因此，对稀薄分解的高通量研究成为重点，旨在探索诸如所用金属、合金组成和表面结构等对催化活性和选择性的影响。

2. 理论方法与模拟的结合有望支持这些努力，尽管与实验方法相比，其进展速度可能会较慢。研究人员已使用理论计算和动力学蒙特卡洛模拟来研究在NO分解下如何影响材料的催化性能的因素，如所选金属、合金形成以及表面结构。
