<p>Alloying Sn with Pt(111) had only a minimal influence on the behavior of n-hexane. The adsorption energy of n-hexane decreased weakly and linearly with increasing Sn concentration in the surfaces of these alloys. This behavior arises from the weak dispersion or H-bonding interactions between the n-hexane and the metal surface.</p>
<p>Increasing the degree of unsaturation in the molecule alters this situation, and in contrast to n-hexane, alloying with Sn has a significant influence on the adsorption and reactivity of 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene. Increasing the surface Sn concentration most strongly decreased the adsorption energy of 1,5-hexadiene, but this influence was nonlinear in the amount of Sn for both 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene.</p>
<p>The most significant alteration caused by alloying Sn was on the dehydrogenation activity of the alloys for both 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene. The amount of dehydrogenation that occurred during heating in TPD measurements of 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene monolayers was reduced from 65 and 100% on Pt(111) to 18 and 30% on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) alloy, respectively. Dehydrogenation activity for both molecules was totally eliminated on the (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of CC double bonds in these linear C6 hydrocarbons served, in general, to decrease the monolayer saturation coverage of these molecules on Pt(111) and the two alloy surfaces. We proposed that this was due to the increased site requirements for strong chemisorption bonding that are introduced with each CC double bond in the molecule and the role that this plays in forming less tightly packed monolayers on a given surface.</p>

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems. Specifically, the adsorption energy of n-hexane decreased weakly and linearly with increasing Sn concentration in the surfaces of the alloys, arising from the weak dispersion or H-bonding interactions between the n-hexane and the metal surface. Alloying with Sn significantly influenced the adsorption and reactivity of 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene, most strongly decreasing the adsorption energy of 1,5-hexadiene. The amount of dehydrogenation for both molecules was reduced on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) alloy and eliminated on the (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy. The monolayer saturation coverage generally decreased with the number of CC double bonds, attributed to the increased site requirements for strong chemisorption bonding and the role in forming less tightly packed monolayers on the surface.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中由氧气诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。测量的分层动力学和活化势垒与这些系统的DFT预测相比较。具体来说，n-己烷的吸附能随着Sn浓度的增加而以较弱且线性的方式降低在合金表面，源于n-己烷与金属表面之间的较弱分散或氢键相互作用。通过Sn合金化显著影响了1-己烯和1,5-己二烯的吸附和反应性，最强烈地降低了1,5-己二烯的吸附能。对于两种分子，在(2×2)-Sn/Pt(111)合金上减少脱氢量，并在(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金上消除。一般而言，随着双键碳数的增加，单分子层饱和覆盖度降低，归因于强化学吸附结合位点需求的增加以及在给定表面上形成较不紧密排列的单分子层的角色。
