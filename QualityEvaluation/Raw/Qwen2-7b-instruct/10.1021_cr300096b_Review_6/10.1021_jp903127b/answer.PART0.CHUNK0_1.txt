<p>Our results for the adsorption and desorption of all three molecules on a thick Sn film confirms that all of these molecules have only a very weak interaction with metallic Sn atoms and Sn was inactive for activating any bonds in these molecules. Furthermore, n-hexane, 1-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene have similar Ed values on a thick Sn film.</p>
<p>In contrast to its effect on adsorption energies, the presence of alloyed Sn did not reduce the monolayer saturation coverage of n-hexane from that on Pt(111) and apparently even increased it slightly (10%) on the 3 alloy.</p>
<p>Our investigations then revealed how these strong effects were altered by the presence of alloyed Sn at the Pt(111) surface. In particular, two ordered alloys were utilized, Pt(111) and two ordered surface alloys, a (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface with θSn = 0.25 and a (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface with θSn = 0.33, so that the reactive sites present at the bimetallic surface could be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Alloying Sn with Pt(111) had only a minimal influence on the behavior of n-hexane. The adsorption energy of n-hexane decreased weakly and linearly with increasing Sn concentration in the surfaces of these alloys.</p>
<p>Increasing the degree of unsaturation in the molecule alters this situation, and in contrast to n-hexane, alloying with Sn has a significant influence on the adsorption and reactivity of 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of CC double bonds in these linear C6 hydrocarbons served, in general, to decrease the monolayer saturation coverage of these molecules on Pt(111) and the two alloy surfaces. We proposed that this was due to the increased site requirements for strong chemisorption bonding that are introduced with each CC double bond in the molecule and the role that this plays in forming less tightly packed monolayers on a given surface.</p>

1. The adsorption and desorption of n-hexane, 1-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene on a thick Sn film show that these molecules have only a weak interaction with Sn atoms, indicating that Sn is inactive in activating bonds in these molecules. The Ed values for these molecules are similar on the Sn film.

2. The monolayer saturation coverage of n-hexane increased slightly (10%) on the 3 alloy compared to Pt(111).

3. The presence of alloyed Sn modifies the adsorption and reactivity of 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene.

4. The adsorption energy of n-hexane decreases weakly with increasing Sn concentration on the alloys.

5. Increasing the degree of unsaturation in linear C6 hydrocarbons decreases their monolayer saturation coverage on Pt(111) and the alloy surfaces due to increased site requirements for strong chemisorption bonding.

1. 这些分子与Sn原子之间只有很弱的相互作用，这表明Sn在激活这些分子中的键方面是无效的。这些分子在Sn薄膜上的Ed值相似。

2. 相对于Pt(111)，3合金上的n-己烷的单层饱和覆盖度增加了10%。

3. Sn合金的存在改变了1-己烯和1,5-己二烯的吸附和反应性。

4. n-己烷的吸附能随着Sn浓度的增加而以较弱的方式降低。

5. 随着碳碳双键数目的增加，线性C6烃类分子在Pt(111)及其合金表面的单层饱和覆盖度降低，这是由于强烈的化学吸附键要求增加导致形成更松散的单层。
