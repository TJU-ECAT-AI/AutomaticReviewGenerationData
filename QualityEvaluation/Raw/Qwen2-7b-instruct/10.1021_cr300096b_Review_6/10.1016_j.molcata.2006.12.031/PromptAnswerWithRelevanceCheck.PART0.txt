Results from N2 adsorption, XRD and TEM indicated that impregnation method used here led to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon.
Conversely to massive CeO2, TPR profile of CeO2/C showed two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures (803 and 903 K), which are indicative of the easier reduction of the supported promoter.
Addition of platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface ceria, this indicating a close metal-promoter interaction.
Ceria reducibility was increased with tin addition.
The reduction treatment at 773 K produced a strong decrease in the CO adsorption capacity in all cases, although this loss was more relevant for the monometallic catalyst.
After reduction at low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity.
Reduction at high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in the case of monometallic sample while bimetallic catalysts, specially the one with Sn/Pt = 0.25, increased the citral conversion values.
Reduction treatment at 773 K also increased selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) of bimetallic samples, which presented in all cases higher values than their monometallic counterpart.
The onset of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after the reduction process is proposed to explain the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.

Answer: 
The experimental techniques of N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to characterize the PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria. These methods confirmed that the impregnation method led to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon. The thermogravimetric analysis (TPR) revealed two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures (803 and 903 K) for CeO2/C, indicating easier reduction of the supported promoter compared to massive CeO2. Platinum's addition facilitated the reduction of surface ceria, suggesting a close interaction between the metals. Tin addition increased ceria reducibility. After the reduction treatment at 773 K, the CO adsorption capacity decreased in all cases, with a more significant loss observed in monometallic catalysts. At 473 K, the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C catalyst was the most active, whereas the presence of tin reduced its catalytic activity. High-temperature reduction decreased the activity of the monometallic sample but increased the citral conversion values for bimetallic catalysts, particularly when the ratio of Sn/Pt was 0.25. This treatment also enhanced the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) in bimetallic samples, which had higher values than their monometallic counterparts. The formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites post-reduction was proposed to explain the increased activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts.

实验技术，包括氮气吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）和透射电子显微镜（TEM），用于表征铂锡催化剂，它们被支持在碳上，并且通过高度分散的氧化铈促进。这些方法证实了浸渍方法导致了碳上的高度分散的氧化铈。热重分析（TPR）显示了803和903 K的低温下氧化铈/C的两个宽重叠峰，这表明支持促进剂更容易还原。铂的添加促进了表面氧化铈的还原，暗示了金属-促进剂之间的紧密相互作用。锡的添加增加了氧化铈的可还原性。在773 K的还原处理后，所有情况下CO吸附能力均有所下降，其中对单金属催化剂的影响更为显著。在473 K时，单金属Pt/CeO2/C催化剂是最活跃的，而锡的存在降低了其催化活性。高温还原降低了单金属样品的活性，但提高了双金属催化剂的异丙醇转化率，特别是当Sn/Pt的比例为0.25时。这种处理还提高了双金属样品中不饱和醇（香叶醇和柠檬醇）的选择性，这些醇的值高于其单金属对应物。还原过程后形成的新PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点被提议解释了双金属催化剂的活性和选择性的增加。

The study involved preparing a novel type of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria through a co-impregnation method. These catalysts were evaluated for citral hydrogenation under different reduction temperatures (473 K and 773 K). Characterization methods such as nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, transmission electron microscopy, and CO chemisorption were employed. The results suggested that the impregnation technique resulted in a highly dispersed ceria on carbon. The addition of platinum facilitated the reduction of surface ceria, indicating a close interaction between the metal and the promoter. Tin addition enhanced ceria reducibility. Reduction at 773 K led to a significant decrease in CO adsorption capacity across all catalysts, with a more notable effect observed in monometallic catalysts. At a lower temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C catalyst demonstrated the highest activity, whereas tin presence decreased catalytic activity. Higher temperatures decreased activity in monometallic samples but increased citral conversion in bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25. Reduction at 773 K increased the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) in bimetallic samples, with values exceeding those of their monometallic counterparts. The formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites following the reduction process was proposed as an explanation for the increased activity and selectivity in bimetallic catalysts.

研究涉及通过共浸渍法制备了一种新型的PtSn双金属催化剂，该催化剂被支持在碳上，并用高度分散的氧化铈促进。这些催化剂用于柠檬醛氢化，并在不同的还原温度（473 K和773 K）下进行评估。采用氮吸附、X射线衍射、程序升温还原、透射电子显微镜和CO化学吸附等表征方法。结果表明，浸渍技术导致了高度分散的氧化铈在碳上的形成。铂的添加促进了表面氧化铈的还原，这表明金属与促进剂之间存在紧密的相互作用。锡的添加增强了氧化铈的可还原性。在773 K的条件下，所有催化剂的CO吸附能力显著下降，而在单金属催化剂中更为明显。在较低温度（473 K）下，单金属Pt/CeO2/C催化剂显示出最高的活性，而锡的存在降低了催化活性。较高的温度降低了单金属样品的活性，但增加了双金属催化剂的柠檬醛转化值，特别是Sn/Pt比例为0.25的样品。在773 K的条件下，双金属样品对不饱和醇（香叶醇和芳樟醇）的选择性增加，其值超过其单金属对应物。提出在还原过程之后形成的新的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点是解释双金属催化剂活性和选择性增加的原因。

Answer: 
The study indicates that the impregnation method utilized resulted in a highly dispersed ceria on carbon. This ceria material shows a distinct difference in its TPR profile compared to bulk CeO2, with two overlapping peaks at lower temperatures suggesting easier reduction. The addition of platinum to the ceria supports enhances the reduction of the surface ceria, implying a strong interaction between the metals. Tin addition increases the reducibility of ceria. After reduction treatments, the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C catalyst exhibits the highest activity at a lower temperature, whereas the presence of tin reduces its catalytic performance. High-temperature reduction decreases the activity of monometallic samples but increases the activity of bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25. These treatments also enhance the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols, with bimetallic samples showing superior selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts. The creation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites post-reduction is proposed as an explanation for the improved activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts.

研究显示，所采用的浸渍方法导致了碳上高度分散的氧化铈。与大量CeO2相比，CeO2/C的TPR图谱在较低温度下显示出两个重叠峰，这表明支持剂的更容易还原。铂的添加部分促进了表面氧化铈的还原，这表明金属促进剂之间存在紧密的相互作用。锡的添加增加了氧化铈的可还原性。在低温下进行的还原处理后，单金属Pt/CeO2/C催化剂在较低温度下表现出最高的活性，而锡的存在降低了其催化性能。高温下的还原减少了单金属样本的活性，但提高了双金属催化剂的活性，特别是Sn/Pt比例为0.25的催化剂。这些处理还提高了不饱和醇的选择性，双金属样品相对于其单金属同系物具有更高的选择性。提出在还原过程中形成的新的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点可以解释双金属催化剂活性和选择性的提高。
