"Results from N2 adsorption, XRD and TEM indicated that impregnation method used here led to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon."
"Ceria reducibility was increased with tin addition."
"The reduction treatment at 773 K produced a strong decrease in the CO adsorption capacity in all cases, although this loss was more relevant for the monometallic catalyst."
"After reduction at low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity."
"Reduction at high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in the case of monometallic sample while bimetallic catalysts, specially the one with Sn/Pt = 0.25, increased the citral conversion values."
"Reduction treatment at 773 K also increased selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) of bimetallic samples, which presented in all cases higher values than their monometallic counterpart."
"The onset of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after the reduction process is proposed to explain the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts."

The experimental techniques of N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the catalysts. These methods revealed that the impregnation process resulted in highly dispersed ceria on carbon. Tin addition enhanced ceria reducibility. After reduction at 773 K, the CO adsorption capacity decreased across all catalysts, being more pronounced in the monometallic catalysts. The monometallic Pt/CeO2/C catalyst was the most active at a lower reduction temperature (473 K), whereas tin reduced its catalytic activity. High temperature reduction decreased activity in monometallic samples but increased citral conversion in bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25. The reduction at 773 K improved the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols, geraniol, and nerol, with bimetallic samples showing higher values compared to monometallic counterparts. The formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites post-reduction was suggested as an explanation for the enhanced activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts.

实验技术如N2吸附、X射线衍射(XRD)和透射电子显微镜(TEM)被用于催化剂的表征。这些方法表明，浸渍过程导致了碳上高度分散的氧化铈。锡的添加提高了氧化铈的可还原性。在773 K的还原处理后，所有催化剂的CO吸附能力降低，尤其是在单金属催化剂中更为明显。在较低温度（473 K）下，单金属Pt/CeO2/C催化剂的活性最高，而锡则降低了其催化活性。高温还原降低了单金属样品的活性，但增加了双金属催化剂的异丙醇转化率，特别是Sn/Pt比例为0.25的样品。773 K的还原处理提高了对不饱和醇（香叶醇和芳樟醇）的选择性，双金属样品的选择性高于单金属对照样品。提出在还原过程中形成的新的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点是解释双金属催化剂活性和选择性提高的原因。
