Results from N2 adsorption, XRD and TEM indicated that impregnation method used here led to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon.
Conversely to massive CeO2, TPR profile of CeO2/C showed two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures (803 and 903 K), which are indicative of the easier reduction of the supported promoter.
Addition of platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface ceria, this indicating a close metal-promoter interaction.
Ceria reducibility was increased with tin addition.
The reduction treatment at 773 K produced a strong decrease in the CO adsorption capacity in all cases, although this loss was more relevant for the monometallic catalyst.
After reduction at low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity.
Reduction at high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in the case of monometallic sample while bimetallic catalysts, specially the one with Sn/Pt = 0.25, increased the citral conversion values.
Reduction treatment at 773 K also increased selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) of bimetallic samples, which presented in all cases higher values than their monometallic counterpart.
The onset of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after the reduction process is proposed to explain the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.

Answer: 
The experimental techniques of N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to characterize the PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria. These methods confirmed that the impregnation method led to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon. The thermogravimetric analysis (TPR) revealed two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures (803 and 903 K) for CeO2/C, indicating easier reduction of the supported promoter compared to massive CeO2. Platinum's addition facilitated the reduction of surface ceria, suggesting a close interaction between the metals. Tin addition increased ceria reducibility. After the reduction treatment at 773 K, the CO adsorption capacity decreased in all cases, with a more significant loss observed in monometallic catalysts. At 473 K, the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C catalyst was the most active, whereas the presence of tin reduced its catalytic activity. High-temperature reduction decreased the activity of the monometallic sample but increased the citral conversion values for bimetallic catalysts, particularly when the ratio of Sn/Pt was 0.25. This treatment also enhanced the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) in bimetallic samples, which had higher values than their monometallic counterparts. The formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites post-reduction was proposed to explain the increased activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts.

实验技术，包括氮气吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）和透射电子显微镜（TEM），用于表征铂锡催化剂，它们被支持在碳上，并且通过高度分散的氧化铈促进。这些方法证实了浸渍方法导致了碳上的高度分散的氧化铈。热重分析（TPR）显示了803和903 K的低温下氧化铈/C的两个宽重叠峰，这表明支持促进剂更容易还原。铂的添加促进了表面氧化铈的还原，暗示了金属-促进剂之间的紧密相互作用。锡的添加增加了氧化铈的可还原性。在773 K的还原处理后，所有情况下CO吸附能力均有所下降，其中对单金属催化剂的影响更为显著。在473 K时，单金属Pt/CeO2/C催化剂是最活跃的，而锡的存在降低了其催化活性。高温还原降低了单金属样品的活性，但提高了双金属催化剂的异丙醇转化率，特别是当Sn/Pt的比例为0.25时。这种处理还提高了双金属样品中不饱和醇（香叶醇和柠檬醇）的选择性，这些醇的值高于其单金属对应物。还原过程后形成的新PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点被提议解释了双金属催化剂的活性和选择性的增加。
