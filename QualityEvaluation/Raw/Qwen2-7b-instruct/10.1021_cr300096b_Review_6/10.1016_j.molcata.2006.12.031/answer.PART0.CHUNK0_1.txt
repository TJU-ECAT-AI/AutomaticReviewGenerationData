"Results from N2 adsorption, XRD and TEM indicated that impregnation method used here led to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon."
"Ceria reducibility was increased with tin addition."
"The reduction treatment at 773 K produced a strong decrease in the CO adsorption capacity in all cases, although this loss was more relevant for the monometallic catalyst."
"After reduction at low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity."
"Reduction at high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in the case of monometallic sample while bimetallic catalysts, specially the one with Sn/Pt = 0.25, increased the citral conversion values."
"Reduction treatment at 773 K also increased selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) of bimetallic samples, which presented in all cases higher values than their monometallic counterpart."
"The onset of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after the reduction process is proposed to explain the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts."

The study involved preparing a novel type of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria through a co-impregnation method. These catalysts were evaluated for citral hydrogenation under different reduction temperatures (473 K and 773 K). Characterization methods such as nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, transmission electron microscopy, and CO chemisorption were employed. The results suggested that the impregnation technique resulted in a highly dispersed ceria on carbon. The addition of platinum facilitated the reduction of surface ceria, indicating a close interaction between the metal and the promoter. Tin addition enhanced ceria reducibility. Reduction at 773 K led to a significant decrease in CO adsorption capacity across all catalysts, with a more notable effect observed in monometallic catalysts. At a lower temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C catalyst demonstrated the highest activity, whereas tin presence decreased catalytic activity. Higher temperatures decreased activity in monometallic samples but increased citral conversion in bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25. Reduction at 773 K increased the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) in bimetallic samples, with values exceeding those of their monometallic counterparts. The formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites following the reduction process was proposed as an explanation for the increased activity and selectivity in bimetallic catalysts.

研究涉及通过共浸渍法制备了一种新型的PtSn双金属催化剂，该催化剂被支持在碳上，并用高度分散的氧化铈促进。这些催化剂用于柠檬醛氢化，并在不同的还原温度（473 K和773 K）下进行评估。采用氮吸附、X射线衍射、程序升温还原、透射电子显微镜和CO化学吸附等表征方法。结果表明，浸渍技术导致了高度分散的氧化铈在碳上的形成。铂的添加促进了表面氧化铈的还原，这表明金属与促进剂之间存在紧密的相互作用。锡的添加增强了氧化铈的可还原性。在773 K的条件下，所有催化剂的CO吸附能力显著下降，而在单金属催化剂中更为明显。在较低温度（473 K）下，单金属Pt/CeO2/C催化剂显示出最高的活性，而锡的存在降低了催化活性。较高的温度降低了单金属样品的活性，但增加了双金属催化剂的柠檬醛转化值，特别是Sn/Pt比例为0.25的样品。在773 K的条件下，双金属样品对不饱和醇（香叶醇和芳樟醇）的选择性增加，其值超过其单金属对应物。提出在还原过程之后形成的新的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点是解释双金属催化剂活性和选择性增加的原因。
