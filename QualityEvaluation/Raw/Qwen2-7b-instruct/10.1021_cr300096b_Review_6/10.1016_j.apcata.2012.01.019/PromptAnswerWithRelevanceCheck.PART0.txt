The experimental techniques such as H2-TPR, pulse CO chemisorption, TEM, and EXAFS were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods showed that the presence of Pt facilitated the reduction of 3d metals, increased the CO chemisorption capacity of Co-Pt compared to monometallic catalysts, provided insights into the particle size distribution and bimetallic bond formation, and confirmed that Co-Pt exhibited higher hydrogenation activity and selectivity towards CO bond hydrogenation compared to Cu-Pt, aligning with previous surface science studies on acrolein hydrogenation.

The results presented above demonstrate that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, with Co-Pt showing much higher selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation and Cu-Pt being more highly selective toward CC bond hydrogenation.
As indicated from the EXAFS results in Table 2, a significant fraction of the Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are surrounded by Co or Cu atoms to form Co-Pt or Cu-Pt bimetallic bonds. In addition, the bimetallic catalysts can be reduced more easily than the monometallic Co or Cu catalysts, as demonstrated by the H2-TPR results in Fig. 1.
It is also well established that an increase of metal particle size favors the selectivity to CML; the effect is particularly pronounced with particle larger than 23 nm. This trend can be attributed to a steric effect whereby the planar CMD molecule cannot adsorb parallel to a flat metal surface because of the steric repulsion of the aromatic ring. By tilting away from the metal surface, the CMD molecule facilitates end-on adsorption and the CC bond is protected and hence the selectivity to CML is improved.
Previous work shows bimetallic surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity. This weak interaction between the surface and the adsorbates allows for novel, low-temperature hydrogenation to occur. Recently, Murillo et al. performed DFT and experimental studies to investigate the trend in CC and CO bond hydrogenation of acrolein, CH2CHCHO, on different bimetallic surface structures. Selective hydrogenation of the CO bond to produce 2-propenol (CH2CHCH2OH) occurs on PtCoPt(1 1 1) as a result of the comparable binding strengths of the diσCC and diσCO bonding configurations, with the latter favoring the CO hydrogenation pathway. Recent studies by FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO and XPS on supported bimetallic catalysts have shown that after reduction, the surface of Co-Pt and Cu-Pt catalysts are composed of primarily Pt atoms, suggesting that the bimetallic nanoparticles may more closely resemble the Pt-terminated configurations from surface science studies.
As described in detail previously, the presence of subsurface Co and Cu modifies the electronic properties of surface Pt, leading to the low temperature hydrogenation of the CO bond of unsaturated oxygenates. Furthermore, DFT calculations and experimental verification show that the Pt-terminated Pt-Co structure is preferred over Co-terminated CoPtPt in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen. Therefore, in the current work one can conclude that the enhanced hydrogenation activity observed over Co-Pt/SiO2 and Cu-Pt/SiO2 could be due to the presence of Pt-terminated bimetallic structures.
Additionally, both the hydrogenation activity and selectivity toward the CO bond in CMD are much higher in Co-Pt/SiO2 than over Cu-Pt/SiO2. This is consistent with surface science studies by Murillo et al. on acrolein hydrogenation, which shows that the activity and selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation on PtCoPt(1 1 1) is higher than that on PtCuPt(1 1 1).
As reported by Gallezot and Richard, the selectivity of Pt toward CO bond hydrogenation would be promoted with electropositive metal atoms. The electropositive metal acts as an electrondonor ligand that increases the electron density on Pt, thus decreasing the binding energies, particularly that of the CC bond, favoring the hydrogenation of the CO bond with respect to the CC bond. This effect has been studied in detail theoretically by Delbecq and Sautet on a model bimetallic surface Fe20Pt80(1 1 1), where the Fe atoms were located in the second layer. Calculations showed that the electropositive metal promoters acted as an electron-donating ligand, increasing the electron density on the surface platinum atoms. It is possible that such effect also plays a role in the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond of CMD over the Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts.

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by observing changes in the spectra that indicate the presence and movement of atoms on the surface. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems by aligning with the theoretical calculations that simulate the energetics and dynamics of the surface processes. The agreement between experimental observations and DFT predictions provides a comprehensive understanding of the surface chemistry involved in the bimetallic systems.

The measured kinetics and barriers give insights into the rates of surface reactions and the energy requirements for atomic rearrangements, which are critical for understanding the catalytic activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts. These findings help in designing catalysts with optimized properties for specific applications, as they guide the selection of appropriate metals and their arrangement on the surface to achieve desired reactivity patterns.

In summary, the experimental and computational approaches complement each other, allowing for a detailed exploration of the surface phenomena and the underlying mechanisms that govern the performance of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic catalysts. The synergy between these techniques enhances our understanding of the complex interactions occurring at the interface and enables the rational design of catalysts with tailored functionalities.

<p>In the current work we extended the hydrogenation of monocarbonyl compounds to that of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on silica supported Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts. In addition, Cu-Pt catalysts were also evaluated due to its selectivity in the partial hydrogenation of butadiene [24] and 1,4-cyclohexadiene [25].</p>
<p>The performance of the Co-Pt and Cu-Pt catalysts in terms of conversion and selectivity after 2 h reaction time are compared in Table 4. The Co-Pt/SiO2 and Cu-Pt/SiO2 catalysts show different hydrogenation activity and selectivity. In general, the catalytic activity follows the order of Co-Pt/SiO2 > Cu-Pt/SiO2 > Co/SiO2 > Pt/SiO2, while the selectivity to CML shows the trend of Co-Pt/SiO2 > Pt/SiO2 > Co/SiO2 > Cu-Pt/SiO2.</p>
<p>As indicated from the EXAFS results in Table 2, a significant fraction of the Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are surrounded by Co or Cu atoms to form Co-Pt or Cu-Pt bimetallic bonds.

By tilting away from the metal surface, the CMD molecule facilitates end-on adsorption and the CC bond is protected and hence the selectivity to CML is improved.</p>
<p>As supported by the CO chemisorption measurements, the increase in the number of active sites on the Co-Pt/SiO2 should partially contribute to the enhanced hydrogenation activity as compared to the monometallic catalysts. However, the surface active sites alone cannot explain the higher hydrogenation activity on the Cu-Pt/SiO2, which has a lower CO uptake value than Pt/SiO2. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the roles of Co and Cu on the activity/selectivity from the point of electronic modification, as discussed below.</p>

The document provides evidence through various experimental techniques and comparisons that Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity and selectivity towards CO bond hydrogenation compared to Cu-Pt catalysts. The enhanced activity of Co-Pt catalysts is attributed to the formation of Co-Pt bimetallic bonds and easier reduction of these catalysts. Additionally, the particle size of the metal influences the selectivity towards the CO bond, with smaller particles promoting higher selectivity. The Co-Pt catalysts also have a higher number of active sites contributing to increased activity. The differences in hydrogenation activity and selectivity between Co-Pt and Cu-Pt catalysts are explained by the electronic modification effects of Co and Cu, which play a crucial role in the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in cinnamaldehyde.

文献通过各种实验技术和比较提供了证据，证明Co-Pt双金属催化剂在氢化活性和选择性方面比Cu-Pt催化剂更高，特别体现在对CO键氢化的促进作用。Co-Pt催化剂活性增强的原因是形成了Co-Pt双金属键以及这些催化剂更容易被还原。此外，金属颗粒大小影响了对CO键的选择性，更小的颗粒促进了更高的选择性。Co-Pt催化剂也具有更多的活性位点，这导致了活动性的增加。Co和Cu在选择性氢化CO键中的电子修饰效应解释了Co-Pt和Cu-Pt催化剂之间氢化活性和选择性的差异。
