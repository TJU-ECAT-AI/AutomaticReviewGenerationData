<p>In the current work we extended the hydrogenation of monocarbonyl compounds to that of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on silica supported Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts. In addition, Cu-Pt catalysts were also evaluated due to its selectivity in the partial hydrogenation of butadiene [24] and 1,4-cyclohexadiene [25].</p>
<p>The performance of the Co-Pt and Cu-Pt catalysts in terms of conversion and selectivity after 2 h reaction time are compared in Table 4. The Co-Pt/SiO2 and Cu-Pt/SiO2 catalysts show different hydrogenation activity and selectivity. In general, the catalytic activity follows the order of Co-Pt/SiO2 > Cu-Pt/SiO2 > Co/SiO2 > Pt/SiO2, while the selectivity to CML shows the trend of Co-Pt/SiO2 > Pt/SiO2 > Co/SiO2 > Cu-Pt/SiO2.</p>
<p>As indicated from the EXAFS results in Table 2, a significant fraction of the Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are surrounded by Co or Cu atoms to form Co-Pt or Cu-Pt bimetallic bonds. In addition, the bimetallic catalysts can be reduced more easily than the monometallic Co or Cu catalysts, as demonstrated by the H2-TPR results in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>It is also well established that an increase of metal particle size favors the selectivity to CML; the effect is particularly pronounced with particle larger than 23 nm [9] ,[38] ,[39]. This trend can be attributed to a steric effect whereby the planar CMD molecule cannot adsorb parallel to a flat metal surface because of the steric repulsion of the aromatic ring. By tilting away from the metal surface, the CMD molecule facilitates end-on adsorption and the CC bond is protected and hence the selectivity to CML is improved.</p>
<p>As supported by the CO chemisorption measurements, the increase in the number of active sites on the Co-Pt/SiO2 should partially contribute to the enhanced hydrogenation activity as compared to the monometallic catalysts. However, the surface active sites alone cannot explain the higher hydrogenation activity on the Cu-Pt/SiO2, which has a lower CO uptake value than Pt/SiO2. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the roles of Co and Cu on the activity/selectivity from the point of electronic modification, as discussed below.</p>

The document provides evidence through various experimental techniques and comparisons that Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity and selectivity towards CO bond hydrogenation compared to Cu-Pt catalysts. The enhanced activity of Co-Pt catalysts is attributed to the formation of Co-Pt bimetallic bonds and easier reduction of these catalysts. Additionally, the particle size of the metal influences the selectivity towards the CO bond, with smaller particles promoting higher selectivity. The Co-Pt catalysts also have a higher number of active sites contributing to increased activity. The differences in hydrogenation activity and selectivity between Co-Pt and Cu-Pt catalysts are explained by the electronic modification effects of Co and Cu, which play a crucial role in the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in cinnamaldehyde.

文献通过各种实验技术和比较提供了证据，证明Co-Pt双金属催化剂在氢化活性和选择性方面比Cu-Pt催化剂更高，特别体现在对CO键氢化的促进作用。Co-Pt催化剂活性增强的原因是形成了Co-Pt双金属键以及这些催化剂更容易被还原。此外，金属颗粒大小影响了对CO键的选择性，更小的颗粒促进了更高的选择性。Co-Pt催化剂也具有更多的活性位点，这导致了活动性的增加。Co和Cu在选择性氢化CO键中的电子修饰效应解释了Co-Pt和Cu-Pt催化剂之间氢化活性和选择性的差异。
