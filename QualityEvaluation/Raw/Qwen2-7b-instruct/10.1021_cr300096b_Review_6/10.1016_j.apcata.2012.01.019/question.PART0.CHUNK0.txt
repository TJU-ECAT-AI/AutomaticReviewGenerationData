Controlling hydrogenation of CO and CC bonds in cinnamaldehyde using silica supported Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts Abstract Liquid phase hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde was evaluated over SiO2 supported Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic and Co, Cu, Pt monometallic catalysts in a batch reactor. H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was utilized to characterize the reduction behavior and pulse CO chemisorption measurement was performed to characterize the number of active sites of the catalysts. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was used to characterize metallic particle size distribution and extended X-ray absorption structure (EXAFS) measurements were performed to verify the bimetallic bond formation. The reactor evaluation results show that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, and Co-Pt shows much higher selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation than Cu-Pt. The trend of hydrogenation activity and selectivity is consistent with previous studies of the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes on model bimetallic surfaces.

1. Introduction
Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding allylic alcohols has received considerable attention because of its industrial applications [1] ,[2] ,[3] . The competing hydrogenation pathways of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes can occur through the CC bond to produce the saturated aldehydes and the carbonyl group to produce unsaturated alcohols. Hydrogenation of the CC bond is thermodynamically more favorable, and hence research efforts have been directed at improving the selectivity to the more desirable unsaturated alcohols [4] . Many attempts have been made to promote the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes by taking advantage of the synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] , such as Co-Pt [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] , Fe-Pt [9] , Ru-Pt [10] ,[11] , and Sn-Pt [12] . The catalytic activity and selectivity are influenced by several factors, including reaction conditions and operation mode (e.g. gas or liquid phase hydrogenation), electronic and geometric structures of the metal catalysts, type of catalyst supports, and catalyst preparation and activation procedures.
In order to better understand the hydrogenation pathways of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on bimetallic catalysts, fundamental studies on Pt single crystal and Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have been performed by adding a 3d-metal, such as Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, to Pt(1 1 1) [18] ,[19] . The 3d-Pt bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of their parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity [20] ,[21] ,[22] . For example, it has been demonstrated under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions that a Pt-terminated Pt-Co-Pt(1 1 1) surface, which represents a subsurface bimetallic structure with Pt on the top-most surface layer and Co residing in the subsurface region, promoted the selective hydrogenation of acrolein (CH2CHCHO) toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol [19] . The combined experimental and DFT results suggested that the presence of weakly adsorbed acrolein through a diσCO configuration appeared to be responsible for this desired hydrogenation pathway [19] .
More recently, these surface science results have been extended to γ-Al2O3 supported Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts, which exhibit significantly higher activity than monometallic Co and Pt catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO bonds in two probe molecules, acetone and acetaldehyde [23] . In the current work we extended the hydrogenation of monocarbonyl compounds to that of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on silica supported Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts. In addition, Cu-Pt catalysts were also evaluated due to its selectivity in the partial hydrogenation of butadiene [24] and 1,4-cyclohexadiene [25] . Several characterization methods, including H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), pulse CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were employed in order to understand the catalytic behavior and bimetallic effects. Because of the toxicity of acrolein, cinnamaldehyde (CMD) was used as the probe molecule in the current work to identify the selective hydrogenation pathways on the bimetallic catalysts. From the point of view of practical applications, the corresponding semi-hydrogenated product, cinnamyl alcohol (CML), is utilized as components in pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and perfumes [4] ,[26] .
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A slurry-based impregnation method was used to prepare the 5.0 wt%Co1.7 wt%Pt/SiO2 and 5.4 wt%Cu1.7 wt%Pt/SiO2 bimetallic catalysts, with a Co:Pt (or Cu:Pt) metal atomic ratio of 10:1. The corresponding monometallic Co, Cu and Pt catalysts were also prepared to serve as control samples.
The silica gel was first calcined at 1073 K for 3 h to obtain the thermally stable silica support, with a BET specific surface area of 370 m2 g1 and a total pore volume of 0.84 cm3 g1. The metal precursors were dissolved in an excess of deionized water (15 mL H2O per gram of catalyst) and then impregnated into the silica support. The solution was sonicated for 1 h, then dried at 373 K for 24 h, and finally calcined at 623 K for 2 h. The metal precursors used in this study were Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (A.R.).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
2.2.1. H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR)
TPR experiments were performed to determine the reduction behavior of the catalysts. The experiments were carried out in a U-shaped tubular quartz reactor heated by an electric furnace. For each measurement, 0.040 g of calcined catalyst (4080 mesh) was exposed to a reducing gas consisting of 5.0 vol% H2 in Ar (10 mL min1) with a temperature ramp from room temperature to 1073 K at 10 K min1. The amount of hydrogen consumption was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
2.2.2. CO chemisorption
Pulse CO chemisorption was performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 to determine the number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts. Approximately 0.05 g of the catalyst was reduced by 30 mL min1 10 vol.% H2 in He at 623 K (723 K for monometallic Co catalyst) for 1.5 h, and then held for 2 h in He. After cooling in He, gas pulses consisting of 5.0 vol.% CO in He were injected at 50 mL min1 at 308 K and the signal was monitored using a TCD.
2.2.3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
TEM analysis was performed on pre-reduced catalysts using a JEOL 2010F equipped with a Schottky field emission gun operated at 200 keV, with an ultra-high resolution pole piece providing a point resolution of 1.9 Å. Imaging analysis was performed in the scanning mode (STEM) using a 12 nm camera length and a 1.0 nm diameter nanoprobe. TEM samples were prepared by grinding and suspending reduced catalysts in ethanol, and then a few droplets of this solution were placed onto a carbon-coated copper grid. The grids were allowed to fully dry before loading the samples into the TEM.
2.2.4. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
EXAFS experiments were performed on the X18B beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. The sample preparation procedures have been previously reported [27] . The catalysts were reduced under a diluted hydrogen flow (5% H2 in He, 40 mL min1) while heating to 623 K at a rate of 10 K min1. The samples were held at 623 K for 1 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature at 10 K min1 under a diluted H2 flow. The Pt LIII-edge EXAFS spectra were then collected at room temperature using a double crystal Si(1 1 1) monochromator. EXAFS measurements were also collected from a Pt foil in order to calibrate the edge energies of the catalyst samples.
The EXAFS spectrum was analyzed using the IFFEFIT 1.2.11 data analysis package (Athena, Artemis, Atoms, and FEFF6) [28] ,[29] . Local structural information was obtained by using Artemis to fit each data set with theoretical standards generated by FEFF6 in R-space [30] . For each catalyst the Pt-Pt and the Pt-3d (3d = Co or Cu) contributions to the theoretical EXAFS were taken into account in fitting the data for the bimetallic catalysts, while only Pt-Pt contributions were included in fitting the monometallic Pt catalyst. The theoretical Pt-Pt photoelectron amplitudes and phases were calculated for the bulk Pt fcc structure. The Pt-3d contributions were calculated using the same Pt fcc structure with the exception that the Pt atoms in the first nearest-neighbor shell were replaced with Co or Cu atoms. The passive electron reduction factor was found to be 0.80 from fitting of the Pt-foil data, and this value was fixed through the fitting of all the catalysts. The seven parameters used in the fitting procedure were the correction to the edge energy, the coordination numbers of the Pt-Pt and Pt-3d bonds, corrections to their model interatomic distances, and the mean square deviations in interatomic distances (EXAFS DebyeWaller factors).
2.3. Catalytic evaluation
The catalytic hydrogenation reaction was performed in a stainless steel stirred autoclave with a volume of 100 mL. In a typical experiment, 0.100 g catalyst was reduced in a U-shaped quartz tube under a H2 (20 mL min1) and N2 (20 mL min1) mixture at 623 K (723 K for monometallic Co catalyst) for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature. To prevent air contact of the freshly reduced catalyst powder, about 3 mL isopropanol (solvent) was dropped into the tube to immerse the catalyst under the H2/N2 mixture. Then the isopropanol immersed catalyst was transferred carefully to the autoclave, including 26 mL isopropanol and 3 mL CMD. The total volume of reactant and solvent was 27 mL. After the autoclave was sealed, H2 was charged four times to replace air and the initial pressure of H2 was 0.5 MPa. The autoclave was heated to the reaction temperature of 353 K in 0.5 h and H2 was charged to a final pressure of 4.0 MPa. The hydrogenation reaction began by starting the stirring mechanism. After the desired reaction time, the stirring was cut off, and the autoclave was quickly cooled to room temperature and depressurized, and about 0.3 mL liquid samples were collected periodically. The liquid samples were analyzed on a gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).
3. Results
3.1. H2-TPR
The reduction behavior of the calcined catalysts by TPR is shown in Fig. 1 . The Co/SiO2 shows two main reduction peaks close to each other with temperature maxima at about 590 K and 630 K. The first peak is assigned to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, and the second one to the subsequent reduction of CoO to metallic Co [31] ,[32] . The detection of the tail or shoulder reduction peak around 700800 K suggests the presence of surface Co species with different degree of interaction with the support, possibly due to the reduction of cobalt silicate species formed during the TPR experiments by reaction of highly dispersed CoO with the silica support. As shown in Fig. 1 , the Co-Pt/SiO2 bimetallic catalysts can be reduced at a much lower temperature than Co/SiO2. The two main reduction peaks of Co-Pt/SiO2 decrease to about 400 K and 560 K, respectively, and the Co-Pt/SiO2 catalysts become completely reduced at temperatures below 623 K.

On the other hand, Cu/SiO2 and Cu-Pt/SiO2 exhibit narrow and intense reduction peaks at 610 K and 600 K, respectively. The peak temperatures and profile shapes are consistent with previous work of TPR of pure CuO [33] and Cu/SiO2 [34] . The TPR profiles indicate that all the catalysts, except monometallic Co, were completely reduced at 623 K. Previous work [35] , by the H2-TPR of the reference sample of mechanical mixture of 20 wt%CuO and 80 wt%SiO2, has shown that the calculated degree of reduction of 10.0 wt%Co1.2 wt%Pt/SiO2 was 94%, indicating a complete reduction of the bimetallic catalysts. In addition, the catalytic evaluation was performed for Co/SiO2 reduced at 623 K, 723 K, and 823 K, with the 723 K sample showing the highest activity. The Co catalyst should not be completely reduced at 623 K from the TPR of Co/SiO2, whereas the Co metal particles would agglomerate when reduced at 823 K, both of which should lead to a lower activity. Therefore, the Co/SiO2 catalyst was reduced at 723 K in the current work.
3.2. CO chemisorption measurements
The CO uptake values are listed in Table 1 . The CO uptake for the Co-Pt/SiO2 bimetallic catalyst is 29.4 μmol g1, higher than the sum of the two corresponding monometallic catalysts. However, the CO uptake value for the Cu-Pt/SiO2 is less than the sum of the two monometallic catalysts. The CO uptake values on Cu/SiO2 is less than 2 μmol g1, similar as the adsorption of CO on SiO2 support itself [36] , suggesting that the adsorption of CO on Cu/SiO2 is negligible at 308 K.

3.3. TEM
High angle annular dark field (HAADF) TEM images and particle size distributions are shown in Fig. 2 . Particle size distributions were calculated by measuring particle diameters in several different images for each catalyst using the software ImageJ and are summarized in Table 1 . The dominant particle size in each catalyst appears to be the smaller particles ranging in diameter from approximately 1 nm to 4 nm. The average diameter is 2.0 nm for Co-Pt/SiO2, and 2.6 nm for Cu-Pt/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2.

3.4. EXAFS
Fig. 3 (a) shows the Pt LIII-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the three catalysts before and after reduction, along with the spectra of the Pt foil for reference. Examining the Pt LIII-edge XANES reveals information regarding the oxidation state of the samples [37] . The XANES in Fig. 3 (a) shows that before reduction in H2 the catalysts exhibit large white-line peaks that disappear after reduction. All of the Pt LIII-edge spectra after reduction are similar to the Pt foil, indicating that the Pt has been fully reduced in the bimetallic catalysts.

Fig. 3 (b) presents the Fourier transformed (R-space) experimental data after reduction and the fits obtained using FEFF6 [30] . The results from the fitting procedure are summarized in Table 2 . In the bulk phase, Co and Pt have first nearest neighbor distances of 2.506 Å (Co-Co) and 2.774 Å (Pt-Pt). In the case of Pt-3d (3d = Co, Cu) bimetallic catalysts the first nearest neighbor distance should be an intermediate value between the two monometallic distances. As shown in Table 2 , the Pt-Co distance falls between the bulk Co-Co and Pt-Pt distances, confirming the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds. A similar trend is observed for Cu-Pt/SiO2. Also, good fits to the Pt LIII-edge data could only be obtained by including both Pt-Pt and Pt-3d contributions in the model, which strongly suggests that bimetallic bonds are present in the bimetallic nanoparticles.

As listed in Table 2 , the Co-Pt and Cu-Pt coordination numbers are 3.7 and 8.1, respectively, confirming the presence of bimetallic bonds. The comparison also suggests that the extent of bimetallic formation is less in Co-Pt/SiO2 than in Cu-Pt/SiO2.
3.5. Catalytic evaluation
The hydrogenation of CMD involves the parallel and consecutive reduction of two functional groups, CC and CO bonds. The products obtained were CML, hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCMD), and 3-phenylpropanol (PPL). In the current work no other side products were detected. Hence, the reaction pathways involved are believed to be those shown in Scheme 1 .

The conversion of CMD and generation of products as functions of reaction time are displayed in Fig. 4 . The conversion of CMD after 6 h on Co-Pt/SiO2 bimetallic catalysts is up to 65%, three times higher than that on the corresponding monometallic catalysts. As the reaction time increases, the selectivity to CML decreases slightly. In contrast, Co/SiO2 shows poor performance in terms of both activity and product selectivity, yielding nearly equal amounts of the semi-hydrogenated products, CML and HCMD.

To make a more quantitative comparison, the hydrogenation rate was quantified by fitting a first-order rate equation to the consumption of CMD, as listed in Table 3 . The hydrogenation rate over Co-Pt/SiO2 is 1.74 h1 g1, much higher than the sum of that over monometallic Co/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2. Because Co-Pt/SiO2 showed much higher hydrogenation activity than Cu-Pt/SiO2, we chose Co-Pt as the model bimetallic system to demonstrate the effect of bimetallic formation on the hydrogenation selectivity. Typically the selectivity is compared at a similar conversion [9] . Therefore, the time required for 20% conversion of CMD was estimated from Fig. 2 , and then used to obtain the product selectivity and the ratio of CO to CC hydrogenated, as listed in Table 3 . The ratio of CO to CC hydrogenation is around 1 over Co/SiO2, suggesting poor selectivity. In comparison, the ratio over Co-Pt/SiO2 is 3.74. Comparing with Pt/SiO2, the Co-Pt/SiO2 shows higher selectivity to CML and lower selectivity to HCMD, indicating that Co-Pt/SiO2 selectively hydrogenates the CO bond rather than the CC bond.

The performances of the Co-Pt and Cu-Pt catalysts in terms of conversion and selectivity after 2 h reaction time are compared in Table 4 . The Co-Pt/SiO2 and Cu-Pt/SiO2 catalysts show different hydrogenation activity and selectivity. In general, the catalytic activity follows the order of Co-Pt/SiO2 > Cu-Pt/SiO2 > Co/SiO2 > Pt/SiO2, while the selectivity to CML shows the trend of Co-Pt/SiO2 > Pt/SiO2 > Co/SiO2 > Cu-Pt/SiO2. The conversion of CMD over Cu-Pt/SiO2 is higher than that over Pt/SiO2, and the Cu-Pt/SiO2 prefers to hydrogenate the CC bond compared with Pt/SiO2. The Cu/SiO2 shows no hydrogenation activity for the CMD.

4. Discussion
The results presented above demonstrate that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, with Co-Pt showing much higher selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation and Cu-Pt being more highly selective toward CC bond hydrogenation.
As indicated from the EXAFS results in Table 2 , a significant fraction of the Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are surrounded by Co or Cu atoms to form Co-Pt or Cu-Pt bimetallic bonds. In addition, the bimetallic catalysts can be reduced more easily than the monometallic Co or Cu catalysts, as demonstrated by the H2-TPR results in Fig. 1 . The formation of the Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts should be responsible for the enhanced hydrogenation activity as compared to that of the corresponding monometallic catalysts.
It is also well established that an increase of metal particle size favors the selectivity to CML; the effect is particularly pronounced with particle larger than 23 nm [9] ,[38] ,[39] . This trend can be attributed to a steric effect whereby the planar CMD molecule cannot adsorb parallel to a flat metal surface because of the steric repulsion of the aromatic ring. By tilting away from the metal surface, the CMD molecule facilitates end-on adsorption and the CC bond is protected and hence the selectivity to CML is improved. However, the metal particle size alone cannot account for the different selectivity over Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts. As listed in Table 1 , Table 4 , the Co-Pt/SiO2 catalyst, with metal particle size smaller than Pt/SiO2, shows higher selectivity to CML. Furthermore, the Cu-Pt/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts, possessing a similar metal particle size of 2.6 nm, show a significantly different selectivity trend. Therefore, the slight difference of the metallic particle size cannot account for the different selectivity trend of the two bimetallic catalysts.
As supported by the CO chemisorption measurements, the increase in the number of active sites on the Co-Pt/SiO2 should partially contribute to the enhanced hydrogenation activity as compared to the monometallic catalysts. However, the surface active sites alone cannot explain the higher hydrogenation activity on the Cu-Pt/SiO2, which has a lower CO uptake value than Pt/SiO2. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the roles of Co and Cu on the activity/selectivity from the point of electronic modification, as discussed below.
Previous work shows bimetallic surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity [22] . This weak interaction between the surface and the adsorbates allows for novel, low-temperature hydrogenation to occur. Recently, Murillo et al. performed DFT and experimental studies to investigate the trend in CC and CO bond hydrogenation of acrolein, CH2CHCHO, on different bimetallic surface structures [19] . Selective hydrogenation of the CO bond to produce 2-propenol (CH2CHCH2OH) occurs on PtCoPt(1 1 1) as a result of the comparable binding strengths of the diσCC and diσCO bonding configurations, with the latter favoring the CO hydrogenation pathway [19] . Recent studies by FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO and XPS on supported bimetallic catalysts have shown that after reduction, the surface of Co-Pt and Cu-Pt catalysts are composed of primarily Pt atoms [27] ,[40] , suggesting that the bimetallic nanoparticles may more closely resemble the Pt-terminated configurations from surface science studies [19] . As described in detail previously [19] ,[22] , the presence of subsurface Co and Cu modifies the electronic properties of surface Pt, leading to the low temperature hydrogenation of the CO bond of unsaturated oxygenates. Furthermore, DFT calculations [41] and experimental verification [42] show that the Pt-terminated Pt-Co structure is preferred over Co-terminated CoPtPt in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen. Therefore, in the current work one can conclude that the enhanced hydrogenation activity observed over Co-Pt/SiO2 and Cu-Pt/SiO2 could be due to the presence of Pt-terminated bimetallic structures.
Additionally, both the hydrogenation activity and selectivity toward the CO bond in CMD are much higher in Co-Pt/SiO2 than over Cu-Pt/SiO2. This is consistent with surface science studies by Murillo et al.
[19] on acrolein hydrogenation, which shows that the activity and selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation on PtCoPt(1 1 1) is higher than that on PtCuPt(1 1 1).
As reported by Gallezot and Richard [4] , the selectivity of Pt toward CO bond hydrogenation would be promoted with electropositive metal atoms. The electropositive metal acts as an electrondonor ligand that increases the electron density on Pt, thus decreasing the binding energies, particularly that of the CC bond, favoring the hydrogenation of the CO bond with respect to the CC bond. This effect has been studied in detail theoretically by Delbecq and Sautet [43] on a model bimetallic surface Fe20Pt80(1 1 1), where the Fe atoms were located in the second layer. Calculations showed that the electropositive metal promoters acted as an electron-donating ligand, increasing the electron density on the surface platinum atoms. It is possible that such effect also plays a role in the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond of CMD over the Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts. More detailed DFT calculations would be needed to further understand the mechanisms for the selective hydrogenation of CMD.
5. Conclusions
The current work extends the hydrogenation of monocarbonyl compounds to that of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on silica supported Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts. Results from H2-TPR studies show that the presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of 3d metals (Co or Cu). Pulse CO chemisorption measurements show that Co-Pt possesses significantly higher CO chemisorption capacity compared to monometallic catalysts. TEM and EXAFS measurements provide additional information on the metallic particle size distribution and the formation of bimetallic bonds. The reactor studies show that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit significantly higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, and Co-Pt shows much higher selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation than Cu-Pt, consistent with previous surface science studies on the CC and CO bond hydrogenation of acrolein. The current work demonstrates a similar trend between model surfaces and supported catalysts, suggesting the possibility of using the relevant surface science results to design bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation.
