The experimental techniques such as H2-TPR, pulse CO chemisorption, TEM, and EXAFS were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods showed that the presence of Pt facilitated the reduction of 3d metals, increased the CO chemisorption capacity of Co-Pt compared to monometallic catalysts, provided insights into the particle size distribution and bimetallic bond formation, and confirmed that Co-Pt exhibited higher hydrogenation activity and selectivity towards CO bond hydrogenation compared to Cu-Pt, aligning with previous surface science studies on acrolein hydrogenation.

实验技术，如H2-TPR、脉冲CO化学吸附、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS），用于验证并量化氧诱导表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的分层。这些方法显示，Pt的存在促进了3d金属的还原，提高了Co-Pt相对于单金属催化剂的CO化学吸附能力，提供了颗粒大小分布和双金属键形成的信息，并证实了Co-Pt的氢化活性和CO键氢化选择性高于Cu-Pt，与先前关于丙烯醛氢化的表面科学研究一致。
