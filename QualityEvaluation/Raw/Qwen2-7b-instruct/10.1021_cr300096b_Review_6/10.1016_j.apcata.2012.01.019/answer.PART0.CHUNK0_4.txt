The presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of 3d metals (Co or Cu). Pulse CO chemisorption measurements show that Co-Pt possesses significantly higher CO chemisorption capacity compared to monometallic catalysts. TEM and EXAFS measurements provide additional information on the metallic particle size distribution and the formation of bimetallic bonds. The reactor studies show that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit significantly higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, and Co-Pt shows much higher selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation than Cu-Pt, consistent with previous surface science studies on the CC and CO bond hydrogenation of acrolein.

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by measuring the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. These measurements are compared with DFT predictions to assess the accuracy of the theoretical models.
