<p>The current work extends the hydrogenation of monocarbonyl compounds to that of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on silica supported Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts. Results from H2-TPR studies show that the presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of 3d metals (Co or Cu). Pulse CO chemisorption measurements show that Co-Pt possesses significantly higher CO chemisorption capacity compared to monometallic catalysts. TEM and EXAFS measurements provide additional information on the metallic particle size distribution and the formation of bimetallic bonds. The reactor studies show that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit significantly higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, and Co-Pt shows much higher selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation than Cu-Pt, consistent with previous surface science studies on the CC and CO bond hydrogenation of acrolein. The current work demonstrates a similar trend between model surfaces and supported catalysts, suggesting the possibility of using the relevant surface science results to design bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation.</p>

The experimental techniques such as H2-TPR, pulse CO chemisorption, TEM, and EXAFS were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The H2-TPR studies revealed that the presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of 3d metals (Co or Cu). The pulse CO chemisorption measurements indicated that Co-Pt has significantly higher CO chemisorption capacity compared to monometallic catalysts. The TEM and EXAFS measurements provided insights into the metallic particle size distribution and the formation of bimetallic bonds. The reactor studies demonstrated that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than their monometallic counterparts, with Co-Pt showing superior selectivity towards CO bond hydrogenation compared to Cu-Pt. These findings align with previous surface science studies on the selective hydrogenation of the CC and CO bonds in acrolein, suggesting that the observed trends can be applied to design bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation processes.

实验技术如H2-TPR、脉冲CO化学吸附、TEM和EXAFS被用来验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧诱导的表面层下3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的分层现象。H2-TPR研究显示，Pt的存在促进了3d金属（Co或Cu）的还原。脉冲CO化学吸附测量表明，Co-Pt的CO化学吸附能力显著高于单金属催化剂。TEM和EXAFS测量提供了有关金属颗粒尺寸分布和双金属键形成的信息。反应器研究表明，Co-Pt和Cu-Pt双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于其单金属对应物，其中Co-Pt在CO键氢化方面的选择性优于Cu-Pt。这些发现与之前关于在acrolein中选择性氢化的CC和CO键的研究结果一致，表明观察到的趋势可以应用于设计用于选择性氢化过程的双金属催化剂。
