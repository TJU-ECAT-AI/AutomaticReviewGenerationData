This study demonstrates that the Pt atoms on the surface of Pt/NaY zeolite react with tetramethyltin (SnMe4) to form a bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species under hydrogen atmosphere at 353 K. This results in a decrease in the BET surface area and pore volume of the zeolite. The electronic properties of the modified Pt atoms are altered due to the inductive effect of electrons between Pt and methyl groups. Consequently, the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol is enhanced compared to Pt/NaY zeolite despite no significant change in the conversion ratio of furfural.

本研究证明，在353 K氢气气氛下，Pt/NaY沸石表面的Pt原子与四甲基锡（SnMe4）反应形成双金属Me3SnPt表面物种。这导致了沸石比表面积和孔体积的显著下降。由于Pt和甲基之间的电子诱导效应，修改后的Pt原子的电子性质发生了改变。因此，与Pt/NaY沸石相比，furfuryl醇的选择性得到显著增强，尽管furfural的转化率没有显著变化。
