The electronic properties of surface Pt atoms are altered by the formation of a bimetallic SnPt complex, which enhances the selectivity of hydrogenation. This is due to the strong polarization of the catalyst surface caused by the difference in electronegativity between Pt and a transition metal, leading to a high selectivity. The bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species plays a crucial role in enhancing the selectivity of hydrogenation. The electronic properties of the modified Pt atoms on the surface of NaY zeolite are changed by the inductive effect of electrons between Pt and methyl groups, which weakens the deep hydrogenation ability of Pt to furfural and enhances the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol.

在形成通道孔中的沸石中，双金属SnPt复合物的形成可以改变表面Pt原子的电子性质，从而增强氢化选择性。这是由于Pt与过渡金属之间的电负性差异导致催化剂表面强烈极化，这是高选择性的原因。双金属Me3SnPt表面物种在增强氢化选择性方面起着关键作用。引入甲基电子的诱导效应改变了NaY沸石表面修改的Pt原子的电子性质，这减弱了Pt对糠醛的深氢化能力，并增强了糠醇的选择性。
