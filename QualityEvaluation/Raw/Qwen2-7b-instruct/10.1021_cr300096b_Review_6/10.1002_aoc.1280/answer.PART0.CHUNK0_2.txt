<p>The grafting reaction of SnMe4 on the surface of Pt/NaY zeolite was investigated in a 1.6 × 104 Pa hydrogen atmosphere. The chemical compositions, structure and properties of the resulting solid were characterized by in situ FTIR, ICP, XRD, XPS, temperature programmed decomposition and nitrogen adsorption.</p>
<p>The results show that Pt atoms of Pt/NaY zeolite react with tetramethyltin to form a bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species in the presence of hydrogen at 353 K. The reaction does not destroy the zeolite framework, while its surface properties are changed. The BET surface area and the pore volume of the zeolite decrease significantly.</p>
<p>The CO chemisorption results and the XPS results show that the electronic properties of the modified Pt atoms on the surface of NaY zeolite are altered remarkably by the inductive effect of electron between Pt and methyl groups.</p>
<p>The grafted product has excellent selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.</p>

The study successfully prepared a bimetallic SnPt complex on the surface of NaY zeolite through the grafting reaction of SnMe4 with Pt atoms in a hydrogen atmosphere at 353 K. The reaction did not damage the zeolite framework but altered its surface properties. The BET surface area and pore volume of the zeolite decreased significantly. The electronic properties of the modified Pt atoms on the surface of NaY zeolite were notably altered due to the inductive effect between Pt and methyl groups. The resulting bimetallic complex showed excellent selectivity in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.

研究成功通过在氢气氛中353 K的条件下，SnMe4与Pt原子的嫁接反应，在NaY沸石表面制备了SnPt双金属复合物。该反应没有破坏沸石骨架，但改变了其表面性质。沸石的BET表面积和孔体积显著减少。由于甲基与Pt之间的诱导效应，修改后的NaY沸石表面Pt原子的电子性质明显改变。制得的双金属复合物对糠醛的氢化表现出极好的选择性，将其转化为糠醇。
