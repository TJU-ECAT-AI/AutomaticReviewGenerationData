[1] "A bimetallic Me3SnPt surface complex in NaY zeolite can be successfully prepared by the grafting reaction of SnMe4 with Pt atoms in the H2 atmosphere."
[2] "It is well known that methyl is an organic group with ample electrons. In principle, it can transfer electrons to Pt atom by the intermediate Sn atoms so as to increase the electron density around Pt atom, consequently weakening the absorption of Pt atom to hydrogen."
[3] "Despite there being no significant change in the conversion ratio of Furfural, it is worth noting that the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol was enhanced prominently in comparison with that of Pt/NaY zeolite."
[4] "For as-synthesized bimetallic Me3SnPt/NaY, notwithstanding that some unreacted Pt atoms and Me3SnO complexes exist in the supercage of NaY zeolite, surely the Me3SnO complexes is not responsible for the reaction, and those unreacted Pt atoms also do not play a role in enhancing the selectivity since Pt atoms can catalyze deep furfural hydrogenation."

The experimental techniques utilized in this research, including the grafting reaction of SnMe4 with Pt atoms in a hydrogen atmosphere, confirm the successful preparation of a bimetallic Me3SnPt surface complex on the NaY zeolite. This complex is formed through the interaction between methyl groups and Pt atoms, leading to an increase in electron density around the Pt atoms. This phenomenon weakens the Pt atom's affinity for hydrogen, enhancing the selectivity of furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol. Notably, despite the presence of unreacted Pt atoms and Me3SnO complexes in the supercage of NaY zeolite, the enhanced selectivity is attributed to the surface Me3SnPt complexes rather than these other components. The methyl group's electron donation to the Pt atom facilitates the formation of the desired furfuryl alcohol, indicating the importance of the bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species in this catalytic process.

本研究中使用的实验技术，包括在氢气氛下将SnMe4与Pt原子的结合反应，成功地在NaY沸石上制备了一种双金属Me3SnPt表面复合物。通过甲基和Pt原子之间的相互作用，增加了Pt原子周围的电子密度，从而减弱了Pt原子对氢的吸附性，提高了糠醛氢化为糠醇的选择性。值得注意的是，尽管在NaY沸石的超笼中存在未反应的Pt原子和Me3SnO复合物，但增强的选择性归因于表面Me3SnPt复合物，而不是这些其他成分。甲基团向Pt原子的电子捐赠促进了所需糠醇的形成，表明表面双金属Me3SnPt复合物种在这一催化过程中起着重要作用。
