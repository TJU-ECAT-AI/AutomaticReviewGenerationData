[1] "Herein, we attempt to alter the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms to enhance the selectivity of hydrogenation via formation of a bimetallic SnPt complex in the channel pores of zeolites."
[2] "The difference between the electronegativity of Pt and that of the transitional metal resulted in a strong polarization of the catalyst surface, which was considered to be the reason for the high selectivity."
[3] "The bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species is responsible for the enhancement of the selectivity."
[4] "The CO chemisorption results and the XPS results show that the electronic properties of the modified Pt atoms on surface of NaY zeolite are altered remarkably by the inductive effect of electrons between Pt and methyl groups."

The electronic properties of surface Pt atoms are altered by the formation of a bimetallic SnPt complex, which enhances the selectivity of hydrogenation. This is due to the strong polarization of the catalyst surface caused by the difference in electronegativity between Pt and a transition metal, leading to a high selectivity. The bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species plays a crucial role in enhancing the selectivity of hydrogenation. The electronic properties of the modified Pt atoms on the surface of NaY zeolite are changed by the inductive effect of electrons between Pt and methyl groups, which weakens the deep hydrogenation ability of Pt to furfural and enhances the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol.

在形成通道孔中的沸石中，双金属SnPt复合物的形成可以改变表面Pt原子的电子性质，从而增强氢化选择性。这是由于Pt与过渡金属之间的电负性差异导致催化剂表面强烈极化，这是高选择性的原因。双金属Me3SnPt表面物种在增强氢化选择性方面起着关键作用。引入甲基电子的诱导效应改变了NaY沸石表面修改的Pt原子的电子性质，这减弱了Pt对糠醛的深氢化能力，并增强了糠醇的选择性。

[1] "A bimetallic Me3SnPt surface complex in NaY zeolite can be successfully prepared by the grafting reaction of SnMe4 with Pt atoms in the H2 atmosphere."
[2] "It is well known that methyl is an organic group with ample electrons. In principle, it can transfer electrons to Pt atom by the intermediate Sn atoms so as to increase the electron density around Pt atom, consequently weakening the absorption of Pt atom to hydrogen."
[3] "Despite there being no significant change in the conversion ratio of Furfural, it is worth noting that the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol was enhanced prominently in comparison with that of Pt/NaY zeolite."
[4] "For as-synthesized bimetallic Me3SnPt/NaY, notwithstanding that some unreacted Pt atoms and Me3SnO complexes exist in the supercage of NaY zeolite, surely the Me3SnO complexes is not responsible for the reaction, and those unreacted Pt atoms also do not play a role in enhancing the selectivity since Pt atoms can catalyze deep furfural hydrogenation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The experimental techniques utilized in this research, including the grafting reaction of SnMe4 with Pt atoms in a hydrogen atmosphere, confirm the successful preparation of a bimetallic Me3SnPt surface complex on the NaY zeolite. This complex is formed through the interaction between methyl groups and Pt atoms, leading to an increase in electron density around the Pt atoms. This phenomenon weakens the Pt atom's affinity for hydrogen, enhancing the selectivity of furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol. Notably, despite the presence of unreacted Pt atoms and Me3SnO complexes in the supercage of NaY zeolite, the enhanced selectivity is attributed to the surface Me3SnPt complexes rather than these other components. The methyl group's electron donation to the Pt atom facilitates the formation of the desired furfuryl alcohol, indicating the importance of the bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species in this catalytic process.

本研究中使用的实验技术，包括在氢气氛下将SnMe4与Pt原子的结合反应，成功地在NaY沸石上制备了一种双金属Me3SnPt表面复合物。通过甲基和Pt原子之间的相互作用，增加了Pt原子周围的电子密度，从而减弱了Pt原子对氢的吸附性，提高了糠醛氢化为糠醇的选择性。值得注意的是，尽管在NaY沸石的超笼中存在未反应的Pt原子和Me3SnO复合物，但增强的选择性归因于表面Me3SnPt复合物，而不是这些其他成分。甲基团向Pt原子的电子捐赠促进了所需糠醇的形成，表明表面双金属Me3SnPt复合物种在这一催化过程中起着重要作用。

This study demonstrates that the Pt atoms on the surface of Pt/NaY zeolite react with tetramethyltin (SnMe4) to form a bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species under hydrogen atmosphere at 353 K. This results in a decrease in the BET surface area and pore volume of the zeolite. The electronic properties of the modified Pt atoms are altered due to the inductive effect of electrons between Pt and methyl groups. Consequently, the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol is enhanced compared to Pt/NaY zeolite despite no significant change in the conversion ratio of furfural.

本研究证明，在353 K氢气气氛下，Pt/NaY沸石表面的Pt原子与四甲基锡（SnMe4）反应形成双金属Me3SnPt表面物种。这导致了沸石比表面积和孔体积的显著下降。由于Pt和甲基之间的电子诱导效应，修改后的Pt原子的电子性质发生了改变。因此，与Pt/NaY沸石相比，furfuryl醇的选择性得到显著增强，尽管furfural的转化率没有显著变化。
