[1] "A bimetallic Me3SnPt surface complex in NaY zeolite can be successfully prepared by the grafting reaction of SnMe4 with Pt atoms in the H2 atmosphere."
[2] "The CO chemisorption results and the XPS results show that the electronic properties of the modified Pt atoms on the surface of NaY zeolite are altered remarkably by the inductive effect of electrons between Pt and methyl groups."
[3] "Despite there being no significant change in the conversion ratio of Furfural, it is worth noting that the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol was enhanced prominently in comparison with that of Pt/NaY zeolite."

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers are compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions. The bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species is responsible for the enhancement of the selectivity in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, as evidenced by improved selectivity for furfuryl alcohol compared to Pt/NaY zeolite.

验证和量化氧诱导表面分层的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的实验技术包括高分辨率电子能量损失谱(HREELS)和原子发射光谱(AES)。测量的分层动力学和激活势垒与密度泛函理论(DFT)预测进行比较。改性后的双金属Me3SnPt表面物种负责增强糠醛氢化为糠醇的选择性，这从糠醇选择性的显著提高与Pt/NaY沸石相比得到证实。
