Experimental techniques such as high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) have been utilized to study the oxidation of methanol on oxygen-covered Pt-n/Ru(0001) layers. The kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations demonstrate that the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems is affected by activation barriers. The observed segregation kinetics and activation barriers align well with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和原子发射光谱（AES），被用来研究在氧覆盖的Pt-n/Ru(0001)层上的甲醇氧化。动力学蒙特卡罗（KMC）模拟表明，特定于Ni和Co的3d亚表面原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面富集受活化势垒的影响。观测到的聚集动力学和活化势垒与这些系统的密度泛函理论（DFT）预测一致。
