Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The HREELS spectra demonstrate a shift in the binding energy of methanol-related peaks, indicating the formation of methoxy species. AES results confirm the presence of segregated Ni and Co atoms on the surface. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for Ni and Co match well with DFT predictions.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和Auger电子能谱（AES），用于验证和量化氧诱导表面掺杂的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的存在。HREELS谱图显示甲醇相关峰的结合能发生显著偏移，这表明形成了甲氧基物种。AES结果证实了Ni和Co原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面掺杂现象。测量到的Ni和Co的掺杂动力学和激活势垒与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测相符。
