<p>Our main objectives are twofold. First, we compare two other 3d metals, namely Fe and Co, with Ni/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) to deter- mine whether there is a general trend in controlling the bind- ing energies of cyclohexene and acrolein on the surface 3dPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and subsurface Pt3dPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) structures. Second,we use these bimetallic surfaces as model systems to deter- mine how the hydrogenation activity is related to the value of the surface d-band center on the various bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>These questions are answered though combined experimental and theoretical studies.</p>
<p>Because both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) than on NiPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), one might expect that the subsurface structure should be more ef- fective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. This is confirmed experimentally in Figure 2, which shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed hy- drogen on these two surfaces.</p>
<p>The general trend of the DFT calculations (see Figure 1) also shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and PtFePtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) are weaker than that on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111).</p>
<p>Although the weaker binding energy of cyclohexene might favor hydrogenation, the adsorption of cyclo- hexene needs to be strong enough for this process to occur. One would therefore expect to observe a volcano-type rela- tionship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, that is, when the ad- sorption of cyclohexene is too weak for the hydrogenation to occur.</p>
<p>This is verified experimentally by comparing the top four TPD spectra in Figure 2. The hydrogenation yield is the highest on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), but starts to decrease on the PtCoPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and PtFePtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surfaces.</p>
<p>The volcano-type relationship is more clearly illustrated in Figure 3, where the hydrogenation yield is compared (as a function of the d-band center) for various Pt- based bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>The hydrogenation activity is maximized on the PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) subsurface structure, which indi- cates that the value of the d-band center on this surface corre- sponds to a cyclohexene binding energy that is optimal for hy- drogenation.</p>
<p>A similar volcano-type relationship is also observed for the hydrogenation of the C=O bond of acrolein (see Figure 4).</p>

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. These experiments show the hydrogenation activity trends, which correlate with the value of the surface d-band center. The hydrogenation yield, which is based on the peak areas of cy- clohexane, indicates the effectiveness of hydrogenation on different bimetallic surfaces. The volcano-type relationship observed in the TPD spectra demonstrates that the hydrogenation activity is maximized on the PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) subsurface structure, suggesting an optimal cyclohexene binding energy for hydrogenation.

验证和量化氧诱导表面亚表面3d原子，特别是Ni和Co，在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分布的实验技术是温度程序脱附（TPD）实验。这些实验展示了氢化活性的趋势，与表面d能级中心值相关。基于环己烷峰面积的氢化产率表明不同双金属表面的氢化效果。在TPD光谱中观察到的火山型关系表明，氢化活性在PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111)亚表面结构上达到最大，这表明存在最佳的环己烷结合能以实现氢化。
