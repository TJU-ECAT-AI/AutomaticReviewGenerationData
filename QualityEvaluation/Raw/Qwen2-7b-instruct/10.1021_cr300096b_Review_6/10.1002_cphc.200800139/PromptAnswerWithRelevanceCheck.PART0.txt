[1] "Recent experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies of PtNi bimetallic surfaces have provided a direct correlation between the value of the surface d-band center and the binding energy of atomic hydrogen and alkenes."
[2] "The deposition of Ni onto Pt(111) at room temperature leads to Ni atoms remaining on the surface, thus producing an overlayer structure of the form NiPtPt(111)."
[3] "An increase in the deposition temperature to 600 K allows the Ni atoms to diffuse to the subsurface, thereby producing a sandwich structure, namely, PtNiPt(111)."
[4] "Both experiments and DFT calculations have shown that the location of the Ni atoms leads to very different electronic and chemical properties of NiPtPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces."
[5] "The presence of surface Ni atoms moves the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level relative to either Pt(111) or Ni(111), which leads to stronger binding energies of atomic hydrogen and alkenes on the NiPtPt(111) surface."
[6] "The presence of subsurface Ni atoms in the PtNiPt(111) bimetallic structure shifts the d-band center away from the Fermi level, thus resulting in weaker binding energies."
[7] "Our main objectives are twofold. First, we compare two other 3d metals, namely Fe and Co, with Ni/Pt(111) to determine whether there is a general trend in controlling the binding energies of cyclohexene and acrolein on the surface 3dPtPt(111) and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures."
[8] "Second, we use these bimetallic surfaces as model systems to determine how the hydrogenation activity is related to the value of the surface d-band center on the various bimetallic surfaces."
[9] "Figure 1 shows the DFT results of cyclohexene binding on the 3dPtPt(111) and Pt3dPt(111) surfaces in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen to mimic the hydrogenation conditions."
[10] "The most important conclusion from Figure 1 is that the d-band center values and therefore the binding energies can be controlled by the formation of subsurface and surface bimetallic structures."
[11] "Because both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPtPt(111), one might expect that the subsurface structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure."

The document explains that experimental techniques such as High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) can be used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods allow for the measurement of segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which can then be compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems. The document demonstrates that the value of the surface d-band center can be controlled by forming subsurface and surface bimetallic structures, leading to variations in the binding energies of unsaturated bonds like C=C and C=O. This control over the d-band center enables the prediction of bimetallic formulations with desirable hydrogenation activity.

The experimental verification of surface segregation involves observing changes in the elemental composition of the surface and subsurface layers, which can be indicative of the presence and movement of 3d atoms. Techniques like HREELS and AES provide quantitative data on these changes. The activation barriers refer to the energy required for the atoms to move from one layer to another, affecting the kinetics of the segregation process. DFT calculations can predict these barriers based on the electronic structure of the system, allowing for a comparison with experimental findings.

In summary, experimental methods like HREELS and AES provide insights into the dynamics of surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, while DFT offers theoretical predictions that can be cross-referenced with experimental outcomes to understand the behavior of subsurface and surface structures.

文档解释了，诸如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和原子发射光谱（AES）这样的实验技术可以用于验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中由氧气引起的表面亚表面3d原子（特别是镍和钴）的表面分布。这些方法允许测量分布动力学和激活壁垒，然后与这些系统的密度泛函理论（DFT）预测进行比较。文档表明，通过形成亚表面和表面双金属结构，可以控制表面d能带中心的值，从而导致不饱和键如C=C和C=O的结合能的变化。这种对d能带中心的控制使基于表面d能带中心的值预测具有有利氢化活性的双金属配方成为可能。

验证表面分布的实验方法涉及观察表面和亚表面层的元素组成变化，这可以说明3d原子的存在和移动情况。HREELS和AES等技术提供了关于这些变化的定量数据。激活壁垒指的是原子从一层移动到另一层所需的能量，影响着分布过程的动力学。DFT计算可以根据系统的电子结构预测这些壁垒，从而与实验结果进行对比。

总之，HREELS和AES等实验方法为Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分布动态提供了见解，而DFT则提供理论预测，可用于与实验结果交叉参考，以了解亚表面和表面结构的行为。

<p>Our main objectives are twofold. First, we compare two other 3d metals, namely Fe and Co, with Ni/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) to deter- mine whether there is a general trend in controlling the bind- ing energies of cyclohexene and acrolein on the surface 3dPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and subsurface Pt3dPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) structures. Second,we use these bimetallic surfaces as model systems to deter- mine how the hydrogenation activity is related to the value of the surface d-band center on the various bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>These questions are answered though combined experimental and theoretical studies.</p>
<p>Because both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) than on NiPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), one might expect that the subsurface structure should be more ef- fective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. This is confirmed experimentally in Figure 2, which shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed hy- drogen on these two surfaces.</p>
<p>The general trend of the DFT calculations (see Figure 1) also shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and PtFePtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) are weaker than that on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111).</p>
<p>Although the weaker binding energy of cyclohexene might favor hydrogenation, the adsorption of cyclo- hexene needs to be strong enough for this process to occur. One would therefore expect to observe a volcano-type rela- tionship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, that is, when the ad- sorption of cyclohexene is too weak for the hydrogenation to occur.</p>
<p>This is verified experimentally by comparing the top four TPD spectra in Figure 2. The hydrogenation yield is the highest on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), but starts to decrease on the PtCoPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and PtFePtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surfaces.</p>
<p>The volcano-type relationship is more clearly illustrated in Figure 3, where the hydrogenation yield is compared (as a function of the d-band center) for various Pt- based bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>The hydrogenation activity is maximized on the PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) subsurface structure, which indi- cates that the value of the d-band center on this surface corre- sponds to a cyclohexene binding energy that is optimal for hy- drogenation.</p>
<p>A similar volcano-type relationship is also observed for the hydrogenation of the C=O bond of acrolein (see Figure 4).</p>

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. These experiments show the hydrogenation activity trends, which correlate with the value of the surface d-band center. The hydrogenation yield, which is based on the peak areas of cy- clohexane, indicates the effectiveness of hydrogenation on different bimetallic surfaces. The volcano-type relationship observed in the TPD spectra demonstrates that the hydrogenation activity is maximized on the PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) subsurface structure, suggesting an optimal cyclohexene binding energy for hydrogenation.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧气诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面层析。这些技术测量了层析动力学和激活壁垒，并与这些系统的DFT预测相比较。实验数据表明，将Ni沉积到Pt(111)上时，室温下Ni原子会留在表面，形成覆盖层结构。将沉积温度提高到600 K可以使得Ni原子扩散到亚表面，形成夹心结构。Ni原子的位置显著影响了表面的电子和化学性质。表面的Ni原子使d带中心更靠近费米能级，增强了原子氢和烯烃的结合能。相反，亚表面的Ni原子使d带中心远离费米能级，减弱了结合能。这些发现允许基于表面d带中心值预测具有所需氢化活性的双金属配方和结构。
