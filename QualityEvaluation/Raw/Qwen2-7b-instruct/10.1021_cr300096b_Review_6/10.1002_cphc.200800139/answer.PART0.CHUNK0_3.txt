[1] "Recent experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies of PtNi bimetallic surfaces have provided a direct correlation between the value of the surface d-band center and the binding energy of atomic hydrogen and alkenes."
[2] "The deposition of Ni onto Pt(111) at room temperature leads to Ni atoms remaining on the surface, thus producing an overlayer structure of the form NiPtPt(111)."
[3] "An increase in the deposition temperature to 600 K allows the Ni atoms to diffuse to the subsurface, thereby producing a sandwich structure, namely, PtNiPt(111)."
[4] "Both experiments and DFT calculations have shown that the location of the Ni atoms leads to very different electronic and chemical properties of NiPtPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces."
[5] "The presence of surface Ni atoms moves the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level relative to either Pt(111) or Ni(111), which leads to stronger binding energies of atomic hydrogen and alkenes on the NiPtPt(111) surface."
[6] "In comparison, the presence of subsurface Ni atoms in the PtNiPt(111) bimetallic structure shifts the d-band center away from the Fermi level, thus resulting in weaker binding energies."
[7] "Our main objectives are twofold. First, we compare two other 3d metals, namely Fe and Co, with Ni/Pt(111) to determine whether there is a general trend in controlling the binding energies of cyclohexene and acrolein on the surface 3dPtPt(111) and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures. Second, we use these bimetallic surfaces as model systems to determine how the hydrogenation activity is related to the value of the surface d-band center on the various bimetallic surfaces."
[8] "Figure 1 shows the DFT results of cyclohexene binding on the 3dPtPt(111) and Pt3dPt(111) surfaces in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen to mimic the hydrogenation conditions."
[9] "For a given bimetallic system, the binding energy of cyclohexene always follows the trend of Pt3dPt(111)<Pt(111)<3dPtPt(111)."
[10] "The most important conclusion from Figure 1 is that the d-band center values and therefore the binding energies can be controlled by the formation of subsurface and surface bimetallic structures."
[11] "The hydrogenation yield, which is based on the peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPtPt(111), Pt(111), or Ni(111)."
[12] "The general trend of the DFT calculations (see Figure 1) also shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) are weaker than that on PtNiPt(111)."
[13] "The volcano-type relationship is more clearly illustrated in Figure 3, where the hydrogenation yield is compared (as a function of the d-band center) for various Pt-based bimetallic surfaces."
[14] "On the other hand, the shift in the d-band center would also reduce the di-s CO binding energy and would likely make it too weak for hydrogenation to occur when the d-band center is too far away from the Fermi level."
[15] "Because the hydrogenation activity requires optimal binding energies between the unsaturated bonds and the surfaces, volcano-type relationships are observed for the hydrogenation of both the C=C bond in cyclohexene and the C=O bond in acrolein."
[16] "The results demonstrate the possibility to predict bimetallic formulations and structures with desirable hydrogenation activity based on the value of the surface d-band center."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which compare with DFT predictions for these systems. The experimental data shows that the deposition of Ni onto Pt(111) at room temperature leads to Ni atoms remaining on the surface, forming an overlayer structure. Increasing the deposition temperature to 600 K allows Ni atoms to diffuse to the subsurface, creating a sandwich structure. The location of the Ni atoms significantly affects the electronic and chemical properties of the surfaces. Surface Ni atoms move the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, enhancing the binding energy of atomic hydrogen and alkenes. Conversely, subsurface Ni atoms shift the d-band center away from the Fermi level, weakening the binding energies. These findings allow for the prediction of bimetallic formulations and structures with desired hydrogenation activity based on the surface d-band center value.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧气诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面层析。这些技术测量了层析动力学和激活壁垒，并与这些系统的DFT预测相比较。实验数据表明，将Ni沉积到Pt(111)上时，室温下Ni原子会留在表面，形成覆盖层结构。将沉积温度提高到600 K可以使得Ni原子扩散到亚表面，形成夹心结构。Ni原子的位置显著影响了表面的电子和化学性质。表面的Ni原子使d带中心更靠近费米能级，增强了原子氢和烯烃的结合能。相反，亚表面的Ni原子使d带中心远离费米能级，减弱了结合能。这些发现允许基于表面d带中心值预测具有所需氢化活性的双金属配方和结构。
