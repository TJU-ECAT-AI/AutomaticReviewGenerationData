[1] "Crucial to this consideration is the fact that that the thermodynamically preferred bimetallic configuration is related to the binding strength of adsorbates present on the surface."
[2] "For adsorbates such as atomic oxygen, which binds more strongly than hydrogen on many surfaces, the surface configuration can become thermodynamically preferred, as confirmed experimentally in Fig. 8."
[3] "The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms."
[4] "The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39]."
[5] "The thermodynamic preference for the surface structure in the presence of atomic oxygen increases as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level."
[6] "Along with the thermodynamic potential, the activation barrier for the segregation of 3d metal to the surface has been shown follow a similar trend with the surface d-band center."

1. The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by measuring the AES ratios and observing the changes in surface compositions upon oxygen exposure. AES ratios increase, indicating the segregation of subsurface atoms to the surface. 

2. The activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms to the surface in the presence of oxygen are 15 kcal/mol for Ni and 7 kcal/mol for Co, according to experimental data. These values confirm the DFT predictions that the surface configuration becomes thermodynamically preferred with the presence of strongly bonded adsorbates like atomic oxygen.

3. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare well with DFT predictions. The AES ratio measurements and the observed changes in surface compositions upon oxygen exposure align with the DFT calculations predicting the thermodynamic preference for the surface configuration.

4. The activation barriers for the segregation of 3d metal to the surface follow a similar trend with the surface d-band center, as indicated by the experimental data and DFT calculations. This means that the thermodynamic preference for the surface structure increases as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level.

1. HREELS和AES等实验技术通过测量AES比率并观察在氧气暴露下表面组成的变化，验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧气诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面聚积。AES比率的增加表明亚表面原子开始向表面聚积。

2. 根据实验数据，Ni的亚表面到表面的聚积激活能为15 kcal/mol，而Co的为7 kcal/mol。这些值与DFT预测一致，即在强吸附剂如原子氧存在的情况下，表面配置成为热力学上更优选的配置。

3. 实验数据和DFT计算预测的热力学偏好相吻合。AES比率测量和表面组成随氧气暴露而变化的观察结果与预测的表面配置成为热力学上更优选的配置相符。

4. 表面d带中心随时间变化的趋势与表面聚积激活能相似。这意味着随着d带中心接近费米能级，表面结构的热力学偏好增加。
