1. The AES technique shows that the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems occurs through the interaction of atomic oxygen adsorbates with the surface Ni atoms. The AES ratio increases with oxygen exposure, indicating that the Ni atoms start to move from the subsurface to the surface.

2. The AES measurements confirm that in the presence of strongly adsorbed species like atomic oxygen, the surface configuration becomes thermodynamically preferred for Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

3. The AES data further demonstrates that the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms in Pt-Ni-Pt(111) bimetallic systems is influenced by the strong interaction between atomic oxygen and the surface Ni atoms.

4. The figure illustrates the AES ratio of Ni to Pt on a Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure, confirming the AES measurements' findings regarding the surface segregation of Ni atoms.

1. AES技术显示，Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，亚表面Ni原子通过与表面Ni原子的相互作用，被吸附氧分子诱导到表面进行表面化。随着氧气暴露量的增加，AES比率增加，表明Ni原子开始从亚表面向表面移动。

2. AES测量证实，在许多表面吸附氧分子较强的条件下，Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面配置变得更加热力学上优选。

3. AES数据进一步表明，在存在如吸附氧分子这类强烈吸附物种的情况下，Pt-Ni-Pt(111)双金属系统的Ni原子表面化受到与表面Ni原子相互作用的强相互作用的影响。

4. 图表展示了Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面上Ni对Pt的AES比率随氧气暴露量的变化情况，验证了AES测量结果关于Ni原子表面化的发现。
