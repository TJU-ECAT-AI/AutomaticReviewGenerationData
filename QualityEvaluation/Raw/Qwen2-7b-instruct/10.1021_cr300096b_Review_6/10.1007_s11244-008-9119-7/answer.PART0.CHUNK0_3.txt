[1] "Using density functional theory, the subsurface configuration is predicted to be preferred for 3d/Pt(111) systems with weak binding adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen [67]."
[2] "For adsorbates such as atomic oxygen, which binds more strongly than hydrogen on many surfaces, the surface configuration can become thermodynamically preferred, as confirmed experimentally in Fig. 8."
[3] "This figure displays the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for an initially Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure. The AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms."
[4] "This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen."
[5] "Furthermore, the thermodynamic preference for the surface structure in the presence of atomic oxygen increases as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level."
[6] "The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39]."
[7] "Based on the shift in the d-band center, the activation barriers for diffusion are expected to further decrease for other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."

The experimental techniques of Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measures the ratio of Ni/Pt, which indicates the presence of Ni atoms moving from the subsurface to the surface upon oxygen exposure. HREELS studies show that ethylene glycol reacts on Pt(111) and Ni-Pt-Pt(111) through initial OH bond scission. On Pt(111), the adsorbate reacts through CC bond cleavage at 250 K, while on Ni-Pt-Pt(111), the CC bond is stable to over 300 K. The binding energies of methanol, methoxy, ethanol, and ethoxy display a linear trend with the surface d-band center, increasing as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen is 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co. The thermodynamic preference for the surface structure in the presence of atomic oxygen increases as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. Based on the shift in the d-band center, the activation barriers for diffusion are expected to further decrease for other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

实验技术，如Auger电子能谱(AES)和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱(HREELS)，用于验证并量化氧诱导的在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中3d亚层Ni和Co原子的表面聚积。AES通过测量Ni/Pt比值来检测从亚层到表面的Ni原子移动情况。HREELS研究表明，乙二醇在Pt(111)和Ni-Pt-Pt(111)表面上通过初始OH键断裂反应。在Pt(111)上，吸附物通过在250 K时的CC键断裂反应，而在Ni-Pt-Pt(111)上，CC键在超过300 K时保持稳定。甲醇、甲氧基、乙醇和乙氧基的结合能随着表面d带中心向费米能级移动而线性增加。在氧气存在下，Ni的亚层向表面的聚积激活壁垒为15 kcal/mol，而Co为7 kcal/mol。氧气的存在下，表面结构的热力学偏好随着d带中心向费米能级移动而增加。基于d带中心的偏移，预计其他3d/Pt(111)双金属系统的扩散激活壁垒会进一步降低。
