[1] "For adsorbates such as atomic oxygen, which binds more strongly than hydrogen on many surfaces, the surface configuration can become thermodynamically preferred, as confirmed experimentally in Fig. 8."
[2] "This figure displays the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for an initially Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure."
[3] "The AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms."
[4] "This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen."
[5] "Along with the thermodynamic potential, the activation barrier for the segregation of 3d metal to the surface has been shown follow a similar trend with the surface d-band center."
[6] "Using the experimental data in Fig. 8 for Ni/Pt(111) and a similar set of data for Co/Pt(111), the activation barrier was estimated experimentally based on the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface."

1. The HREELS and AES techniques verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by observing changes in the AES ratio as oxygen exposure increases. The AES ratio increases, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms start to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of atomic oxygen with the surface Ni atoms. This matches the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration becomes thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen.

2. The activation barrier for the segregation of 3d metal to the surface follows a similar trend with the surface d-band center, as shown by the experimental data and the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. This indicates that the stability of the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface configuration depends on the d-band center, which affects the segregation kinetics and activation barriers.

1. 原子氧等吸附剂在许多表面上比氢结合得更牢固，因此表面配置可以成为热力学上更优选的配置，如图8中通过实验验证的。图8显示了初始Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面的Ni/Pt AES比率随氧气暴露的变化。随着氧气暴露量增加，AES比率增加，表明亚表面Ni原子开始向表面迁移，由于原子氧吸附剂与表面Ni原子之间的强烈相互作用。这证实了DFT预测，即在吸附氧存在下，表面Ni-Pt-Pt(111)配置成为热力学上更优选的配置。

2. 分离3d金属到表面的活化势与表面d能级中心的趋势相似，这由实验数据和亚表面3d原子分离到表面所需时间确定。这表明3d-Pt-Pt(111)表面配置的稳定性取决于d能级中心，进而影响分离动力学和活化势。
