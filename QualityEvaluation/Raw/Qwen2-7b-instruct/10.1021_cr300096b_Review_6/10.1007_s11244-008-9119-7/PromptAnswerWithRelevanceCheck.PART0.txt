[1] "The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms."
[2] "For adsorbates such as atomic oxygen, which binds more strongly than hydrogen on many surfaces, the surface configuration can become thermodynamically preferred, as confirmed experimentally in Fig. 8."
[3] "The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms."
[4] "This figure displays the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for an initially Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure."

1. The AES technique shows that the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems occurs through the interaction of atomic oxygen adsorbates with the surface Ni atoms. The AES ratio increases with oxygen exposure, indicating that the Ni atoms start to move from the subsurface to the surface.

2. The AES measurements confirm that in the presence of strongly adsorbed species like atomic oxygen, the surface configuration becomes thermodynamically preferred for Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

3. The AES data further demonstrates that the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms in Pt-Ni-Pt(111) bimetallic systems is influenced by the strong interaction between atomic oxygen and the surface Ni atoms.

4. The figure illustrates the AES ratio of Ni to Pt on a Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure, confirming the AES measurements' findings regarding the surface segregation of Ni atoms.

1. The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by measuring the AES ratios and observing the changes in surface compositions upon oxygen exposure. AES ratios increase, indicating the segregation of subsurface atoms to the surface. 

2. The activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms to the surface in the presence of oxygen are 15 kcal/mol for Ni and 7 kcal/mol for Co, according to experimental data. These values confirm the DFT predictions that the surface configuration becomes thermodynamically preferred with the presence of strongly bonded adsorbates like atomic oxygen.

3. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare well with DFT predictions. The AES ratio measurements and the observed changes in surface compositions upon oxygen exposure align with the DFT calculations predicting the thermodynamic preference for the surface configuration.

4. The activation barriers for the segregation of 3d metal to the surface follow a similar trend with the surface d-band center, as indicated by the experimental data and DFT calculations. This means that the thermodynamic preference for the surface structure increases as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level.

1. HREELS和AES等实验技术通过测量AES比率并观察在氧气暴露下表面组成的变化，验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧气诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面聚积。AES比率的增加表明亚表面原子开始向表面聚积。

2. 根据实验数据，Ni的亚表面到表面的聚积激活能为15 kcal/mol，而Co的为7 kcal/mol。这些值与DFT预测一致，即在强吸附剂如原子氧存在的情况下，表面配置成为热力学上更优选的配置。

3. 实验数据和DFT计算预测的热力学偏好相吻合。AES比率测量和表面组成随氧气暴露而变化的观察结果与预测的表面配置成为热力学上更优选的配置相符。

4. 表面d带中心随时间变化的趋势与表面聚积激活能相似。这意味着随着d带中心接近费米能级，表面结构的热力学偏好增加。

The experimental techniques of Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measures the ratio of Ni/Pt, which indicates the presence of Ni atoms moving from the subsurface to the surface upon oxygen exposure. HREELS studies show that ethylene glycol reacts on Pt(111) and Ni-Pt-Pt(111) through initial OH bond scission. On Pt(111), the adsorbate reacts through CC bond cleavage at 250 K, while on Ni-Pt-Pt(111), the CC bond is stable to over 300 K. The binding energies of methanol, methoxy, ethanol, and ethoxy display a linear trend with the surface d-band center, increasing as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen is 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co. The thermodynamic preference for the surface structure in the presence of atomic oxygen increases as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. Based on the shift in the d-band center, the activation barriers for diffusion are expected to further decrease for other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

实验技术，如Auger电子能谱(AES)和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱(HREELS)，用于验证并量化氧诱导的在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中3d亚层Ni和Co原子的表面聚积。AES通过测量Ni/Pt比值来检测从亚层到表面的Ni原子移动情况。HREELS研究表明，乙二醇在Pt(111)和Ni-Pt-Pt(111)表面上通过初始OH键断裂反应。在Pt(111)上，吸附物通过在250 K时的CC键断裂反应，而在Ni-Pt-Pt(111)上，CC键在超过300 K时保持稳定。甲醇、甲氧基、乙醇和乙氧基的结合能随着表面d带中心向费米能级移动而线性增加。在氧气存在下，Ni的亚层向表面的聚积激活壁垒为15 kcal/mol，而Co为7 kcal/mol。氧气的存在下，表面结构的热力学偏好随着d带中心向费米能级移动而增加。基于d带中心的偏移，预计其他3d/Pt(111)双金属系统的扩散激活壁垒会进一步降低。

1. The HREELS and AES techniques verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by observing changes in the AES ratio as oxygen exposure increases. The AES ratio increases, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms start to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of atomic oxygen with the surface Ni atoms. This matches the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration becomes thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen.

2. The activation barrier for the segregation of 3d metal to the surface follows a similar trend with the surface d-band center, as shown by the experimental data and the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. This indicates that the stability of the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface configuration depends on the d-band center, which affects the segregation kinetics and activation barriers.

1. 原子氧等吸附剂在许多表面上比氢结合得更牢固，因此表面配置可以成为热力学上更优选的配置，如图8中通过实验验证的。图8显示了初始Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面的Ni/Pt AES比率随氧气暴露的变化。随着氧气暴露量增加，AES比率增加，表明亚表面Ni原子开始向表面迁移，由于原子氧吸附剂与表面Ni原子之间的强烈相互作用。这证实了DFT预测，即在吸附氧存在下，表面Ni-Pt-Pt(111)配置成为热力学上更优选的配置。

2. 分离3d金属到表面的活化势与表面d能级中心的趋势相似，这由实验数据和亚表面3d原子分离到表面所需时间确定。这表明3d-Pt-Pt(111)表面配置的稳定性取决于d能级中心，进而影响分离动力学和活化势。
