The experimental techniques of AES and HREELS verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measures the AES ratio, which indicates the segregation kinetics, while HREELS shows the strong interaction of atomic oxygen with surface Ni atoms, confirming the DFT prediction that the surface configuration becomes thermodynamically preferred. The activation barrier for this segregation is experimentally determined to be 15 kcal/mol for Ni in the presence of oxygen. As the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level, the thermodynamic preference for the surface structure increases, aligning with the trend predicted by DFT calculations.

AES和HREELS技术验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面聚积。AES测量AES比，以表明聚积动力学，而HREELS显示了原子氧与表面Ni原子之间的强相互作用，证实了DFT预测的表面配置在氧存在下变得热力学上更优选。实验确定了Ni在氧气中的扩散势垒为15 kcal/mol。随着d带中心向费米能级移动，表面结构的热力学偏好增加，这与DFT计算预测的趋势一致。
