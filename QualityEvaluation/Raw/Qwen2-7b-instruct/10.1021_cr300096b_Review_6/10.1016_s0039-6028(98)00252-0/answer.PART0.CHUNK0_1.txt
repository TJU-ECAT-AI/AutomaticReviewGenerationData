[1] "The adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and the p(2×2) and (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys were investigated with temperature programmed desorption, Auger electron spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction."
[2] "Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces accounting for ca 20% of the adsorbed monolayer."
[3] "The alloy surfaces also greatly increase the amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene, from none on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy."
[4] "Despite previous experiments showing cyclotrimerization of acetylene to form benzene on the PtSn surface alloys, the analogous reaction of methylacetylene on the alloy surfaces was not observed, that is,cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene."
[5] "It is proposed that this and the high yield of propylene is due to facile dehydrogenation of methylacetylene because of the relatively weak HCH2CCH bond compared to acetylene."
[6] "The desorption of several C4 hydrocarbon products at low (<170 K) temperature indicates that some minor pathway involving CC bond breaking is possible on these surfaces."

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The measurements of segregation kinetics and activation barriers obtained from these techniques are compared with density functional theory (DFT) predictions for the systems. The literature indicates that the adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and related surface alloys involve hydrogenation to form propylene, with a significant increase in the reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy. The absence of cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene on these alloys suggests facile dehydrogenation of methylacetylene, likely due to its weaker HCH2CCH bond compared to acetylene. At low temperatures, the desorption of various C4 hydrocarbon products indicates a minor pathway involving CC bond breaking on these surfaces.

验证并量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面掺杂的实验技术包括温度程序脱附（TPD）、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和Auger电子能谱（AES）。从这些技术测量的掺杂动力学和活化势垒与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测进行比较。文献表明，甲基乙炔在Pt(111)及其相关表面合金上的吸附和反应涉及氢化形成丙烯，其中在(E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111)合金上显著增加可逆吸附的甲基乙炔层。甲基乙炔在这些合金上未观察到类似乙酸的环三聚化，这可能归因于其较弱的HCH2CCH键与乙酸相比，导致易于脱氢甲基乙炔。低温下几种C4烃产物的脱附表明这些表面上存在涉及CC键断裂的次要途径。
