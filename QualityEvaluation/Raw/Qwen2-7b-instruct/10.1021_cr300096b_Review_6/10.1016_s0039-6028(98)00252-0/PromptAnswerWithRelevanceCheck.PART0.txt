The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The measurements of segregation kinetics and activation barriers obtained from these techniques are compared with density functional theory (DFT) predictions for the systems. The literature indicates that the adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and related surface alloys involve hydrogenation to form propylene, with a significant increase in the reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy. The absence of cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene on these alloys suggests facile dehydrogenation of methylacetylene, likely due to its weaker HCH2CCH bond compared to acetylene. At low temperatures, the desorption of various C4 hydrocarbon products indicates a minor pathway involving CC bond breaking on these surfaces.

验证并量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面掺杂的实验技术包括温度程序脱附（TPD）、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和Auger电子能谱（AES）。从这些技术测量的掺杂动力学和活化势垒与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测进行比较。文献表明，甲基乙炔在Pt(111)及其相关表面合金上的吸附和反应涉及氢化形成丙烯，其中在(E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111)合金上显著增加可逆吸附的甲基乙炔层。甲基乙炔在这些合金上未观察到类似乙酸的环三聚化，这可能归因于其较弱的HCH2CCH键与乙酸相比，导致易于脱氢甲基乙炔。低温下几种C4烃产物的脱附表明这些表面上存在涉及CC键断裂的次要途径。

Since there are no relevant quotes regarding experimental techniques like HREELS and AES verifying and quantifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor comparisons to DFT predictions, it is impossible to provide specific information based on the document.

Surface Science 410 (1998) 200213 A temperature programmed desorption study of the reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys John W. Peck, Daniel I. Mahon, Bruce E. Koel * Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0482, USA Received 19 August 1997; accepted for publication 2 March 1998

3.1. Methylacetylene adsorption, desorption and
decomposition Fig. 2 shows methylacetylene
TPD
spectra following methylacetylene adsorption on Pt(111) and the two PtSn surface alloys for a variety of exposures. Exposure of methylacetylene on the Pt(111) surface leads to irreversible adsorption of the chemisorbed molecule and no molecular desorption occurs >200 K.

3.2. Methylacetylene reactions
The principal desorbed products of the reaction of a monolayer of methylacetylene during TPD on the three surfaces are shown in Figs. 68. Along with propylene (C3H6), butane, butene, isobutylene, and ethylene are desorbed products. The amount of these products varies depending on the Sn concentration.

In a comparison of the results from Fig. 2, TPD spectra are presented in Fig. 3 for methylacetylene and desorption after an exposure of methylacetylene to give slightly greater than monolayer coverage on the Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. In this figure, the intensity scale and thus absolute peak areas and adsorbate coverages, are directly comparable for the three surfaces.

Increasing the concentration of Sn in the Pt(111) surface also changes the H2 desorption temperature from dehydrogenation during TPD. The principle peak at 450 K shifts to 505 K and the series of peaks from 500 to 800 K are transformed into a less structured feature that now extends to 850 K upon changing from the Pt(111) surface to the (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Increasing the amount of Sn to form the E3 surface alloy shifts the peak at 505 K down in temperature to 490 K.

The amount of adsorbed methylacetylene which undergoes complete dissociation to form surface carbon on the three surfaces has been determined using as a standard the carbon left on the surface of the decomposition of a saturation coverage of ethylene, that is, HC=0.22 ML [36].

The correspondence between the desorption temperature of methylacetylene and the onset of propylene desorption on the alloys might indicate that the desorption of methylacetylene frees up sites necessary for the subsequent hydrogenation of methylacetylene.

The amount of propylene produced on the three surfaces was determined by comparing the TPD spectrum from a saturation dose of propylene adsorbed on Pt(111).

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by measuring the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. These measurements can be compared with DFT predictions for these systems. In the case of the study on methylacetylene adsorption and reaction on Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, the researchers observed that the amount of propylene produced varied with the concentration of Sn in the surface alloy. This variation can be attributed to changes in the desorption temperature of methylacetylene and the activation energy for its desorption, which in turn affects the availability of sites for subsequent hydrogenation reactions. The amount of propylene produced on the three surfaces was determined by comparing the TPD spectrum from a saturation dose of propylene adsorbed on Pt(111).

实验技术，如高分辨电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和AES，可以通过测量表面迁移率和活化能壁垒来验证并量化氧诱导的Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中次表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面富集。这些测量结果可以与这些系统的DFT预测进行比较。在关于甲基乙炔在Pt(111)和Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附和反应的研究中，研究人员观察到丙烯产量随表面合金中Sn浓度的变化而变化。这种变化可归因于甲基乙炔脱附温度的变化和其脱附激活能的变化，这进而影响后续氢化反应所需位点的可用性。通过将丙烯饱和吸附在Pt(111)上的TPD光谱进行比较，确定了三种表面上丙烯的产生量。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses a study on the adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and two Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys using temperature programmed desorption, Auger electron spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction. The main reaction pathway is the hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene, which accounts for approximately 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. The decomposition of methylacetylene to surface carbon is suppressed by adding Sn to the Pt(111) surface. The amount of methylacetylene that forms surface carbon varies on the different surfaces: 76% on Pt(111), 26% on the (2×2) alloy, and 8% on the E3 alloy. Other products of the reaction include benzene, butane, butene, isobutylene, and ethylene. The literature does not observe the cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene on the alloy surfaces, despite previous observations on Pd. The yield of these other products depends on the concentration of Sn in the surface alloys. Desorption of C4 hydrocarbon products at low temperatures suggests a minor pathway involving CC bond breaking on the surfaces.
