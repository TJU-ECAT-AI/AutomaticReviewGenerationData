The literature discusses a study on the adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and two Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys using temperature programmed desorption, Auger electron spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction. The main reaction pathway is the hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene, which accounts for approximately 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. The decomposition of methylacetylene to surface carbon is suppressed by adding Sn to the Pt(111) surface. The amount of methylacetylene that forms surface carbon varies on the different surfaces: 76% on Pt(111), 26% on the (2×2) alloy, and 8% on the E3 alloy. Other products of the reaction include benzene, butane, butene, isobutylene, and ethylene. The literature does not observe the cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene on the alloy surfaces, despite previous observations on Pd. The yield of these other products depends on the concentration of Sn in the surface alloys. Desorption of C4 hydrocarbon products at low temperatures suggests a minor pathway involving CC bond breaking on the surfaces.

文献讨论了在Pt(111)和两个Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上甲基乙炔的吸附和反应的研究，使用温度程序脱附、Auger电子光谱和低能电子衍射。主要的反应途径是甲基乙炔的氢化生成丙烯，这占吸附单层的约20%。通过向Pt(111)表面添加Sn抑制了甲基乙炔的分解以形成表面碳。不同表面上形成的表面碳量有所不同：76%在Pt(111)上，26%在(2×2)合金上，8%在E3合金上。反应产物还包括苯、丁烷、丁烯、异丁烯和乙烯。文献中没有观察到甲基乙炔在合金表面的环三聚化形成三甲基苯，尽管在Pd上曾经观察到这一现象。这些其他产品的产率取决于表面合金中Sn的浓度。低温下脱附的C4烃产物表明表面可能存在涉及CC键断裂的次要途径。
