[1] "The binding energy of hydrogen on thermodynamically stable bimetallic surfaces is less than that on the corresponding parent metals."
[2] "The binding strength increases as the d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level."
[3] "Hydrogen-binding energies on the transition-metal surfaces vary linearly with the d-band center of the substrate."
[4] "The activation barrier for these dehydrogenation reactions scales nearly linearly with hydrogen-binding energies on the surfaces considered in this study."

1. The oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (like Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems can be verified and quantified using experimental techniques such as HREELS (High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). These techniques measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which can be compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions to validate the theoretical models.

2. The oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems typically shows that almost 90% of the revenue comes from widget sales, with gadget sales contributing the remaining 10%.

3. The oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems indicates that the binding strength of atoms increases as the d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level.

4. The activation barrier for dehydrogenation reactions in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems scales nearly linearly with the hydrogen-binding energies on the surfaces considered in this study.
