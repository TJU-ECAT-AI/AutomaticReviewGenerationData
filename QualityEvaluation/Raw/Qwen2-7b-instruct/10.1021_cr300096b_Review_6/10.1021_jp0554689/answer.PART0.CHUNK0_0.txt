The document discusses the use of density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the reaction pathways of C2 hydrocarbons on transition-metal surfaces, focusing on the correlation between electronic properties and reactivity. The binding energies of hydrogen, ethylene, acetylene, ethyl, and vinyl were studied on monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. DFT was also used to calculate the activation barriers for dehydrogenation reactions. The document does not provide information on how experimental techniques like HREELS and AES verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor does it compare the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions.

文档讨论了密度泛函理论（DFT）在过渡金属表面研究C2烃反应途径的应用，重点关注电子性质与活性之间的关联。对氢、乙烷、乙炔、乙基和乙烯基的吸附能进行了研究，涵盖了单金属和双金属表面。还使用DFT计算了脱氢反应的活化能。文档没有提供关于如何通过HREELS和AES实验技术验证并量化氧诱导的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面层析，以及测量的层析动力学和活化能与DFT预测比较的信息。
