[1] "The current work is on investigation of the reaction pathways of the C2 hydrocarbons on several monometallic and bimetallic transition-metal surfaces, with the goal of correlating reactivity with the electronic properties of these surfaces."
[2] "DFT was employed to study the binding of atomic hydrogen and C2 intermediates on transition-metal surfaces."
[3] "The adsorption of acetylene on transition-metal surfaces was also studied using DFT."
[4] "DFT calculations were also performed for ethyl and vinyl species on metal surfaces."
[5] "Activation energies for the dehydrogenation of ethyl to ethylene on monometallic and bimetallic surfaces were calculated using BOC."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the use of density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the reaction pathways of C2 hydrocarbons on transition-metal surfaces, focusing on the correlation between electronic properties and reactivity. The binding energies of hydrogen, ethylene, acetylene, ethyl, and vinyl were studied on monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. DFT was also used to calculate the activation barriers for dehydrogenation reactions. The document does not provide information on how experimental techniques like HREELS and AES verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor does it compare the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
There are no experimental techniques mentioned in the literature that specifically verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The literature focuses on the theoretical calculations and correlations between electronic properties and chemical reactivity on transition-metal surfaces. It does not provide direct comparisons between DFT predictions and experimental measurements of segregation kinetics or activation barriers for specific bimetallic systems involving oxygen-induced segregation.
