There are no experimental techniques mentioned in the literature that specifically verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The literature focuses on the theoretical calculations and correlations between electronic properties and chemical reactivity on transition-metal surfaces. It does not provide direct comparisons between DFT predictions and experimental measurements of segregation kinetics or activation barriers for specific bimetallic systems involving oxygen-induced segregation.

文献中没有提到用于验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）的特定实验技术。该文献侧重于过渡金属表面的理论计算及其电子性质与化学反应性的相关性。它没有提供直接将第一原理预测与特定双金属体系中的氧诱导分离动力学或激活能比较的信息。
