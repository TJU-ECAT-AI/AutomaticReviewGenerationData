[1] "The combination of DFT and BOC was used to study the relationship of reaction kinetics (activation barriers) to surface d-band center."
[2] "As far as the monometallic systems are concerned, the binding strength increases as one moves upward in the periodic table. Within a particular row, that is, 3d, 4d, or 5d, ethylene binding energies vary linearly with the d-band center of the substrate."
[3] "Acetylene and vinyl binding energies can also be correlated with the d-band center of the substrate."
[4] "Activation barriers for these dehydrogenation reactions scale nearly linearly with hydrogen-binding energies on the surfaces considered in this study."

1. The DFT and BOC methods were employed to analyze the relationship between reaction kinetics (activation barriers) and the d-band center of the surface. 
2. In monometallic systems, the binding strength escalates as one ascends in the periodic table. Within each row, ethylene binding energies correlate linearly with the d-band center of the substrate.  
3. Similar trends were observed for acetylene and vinyl binding energies with respect to the d-band center of the substrate.  
4. Activation barriers for dehydrogenation reactions showed a nearly linear relationship with hydrogen-binding energies on the surfaces analyzed in this study.
