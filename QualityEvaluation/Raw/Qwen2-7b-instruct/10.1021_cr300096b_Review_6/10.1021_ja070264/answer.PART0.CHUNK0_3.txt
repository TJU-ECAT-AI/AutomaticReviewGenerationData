Experimental techniques including HREELS and AES have been utilized to confirm and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The observed kinetics and activation barriers align closely with predictions made through Density Functional Theory (DFT).
