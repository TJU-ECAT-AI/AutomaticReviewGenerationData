The interaction of sulfur with different surfaces was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES), and thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS). At 550 K, sulfur exposure sulfidizes the platinum on Cu/Pt(111) surfaces. Platinum competes effectively for sulfur atoms bonded to copper but not to zinc. Copper sulfides formed during this process aid in the sulfidation of platinum by creating sites for sulfur dissociation and promoting sulfur diffusion into the system.

对不同表面硫的相互作用进行了研究，使用了X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、X射线激发阿格电子能谱(XAES)和热解吸质谱(TDS)。在550 K下，硫暴露导致Cu/Pt(111)表面的铂化。铂可以有效地与铜结合的硫原子竞争，但不能与锌结合的硫原子竞争。在此过程中形成的铜硫化物通过提供硫分解的表面位点并促进硫向系统的扩散，帮助铂化铂。
