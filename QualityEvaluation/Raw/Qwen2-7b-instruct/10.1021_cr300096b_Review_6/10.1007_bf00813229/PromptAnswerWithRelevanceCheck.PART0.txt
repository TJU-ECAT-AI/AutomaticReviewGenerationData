The study utilized X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES), and thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS) to investigate the interaction of sulfur with various surfaces, including Pt(111), Zn/Pt(111), and Cu/Pt(111). The research showed that sulfur exposure to Pt(111) resulted in a chemisorbed layer without forming bulk sulfides. With Zn/Pt(111), sulfur led to the breakdown of the alloy and formation of a zinc-sulfide film. On the Cu/Pt(111) surface, sulfur promoted the sulfidation of platinum, highlighting the ability of platinum to compete for sulfur atoms bound to copper but not to zinc. Copper sulfides produced by the reaction of S2 gas with Cu/Pt(111) surfaces facilitated the sulfidation of platinum by providing sites for sulfur dissociation and enhancing sulfur diffusion into the bulk system.

The interaction of sulfur with different surfaces was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES), and thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS). At 550 K, sulfur exposure sulfidizes the platinum on Cu/Pt(111) surfaces. Platinum competes effectively for sulfur atoms bonded to copper but not to zinc. Copper sulfides formed during this process aid in the sulfidation of platinum by creating sites for sulfur dissociation and promoting sulfur diffusion into the system.

The interaction of sulfur with various surfaces was studied using several techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES), and thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS). When sulfur interacts with a Cu/Pt(111) surface at 550 K, it leads to the sulfidation of platinum. Platinum competes effectively for sulfur atoms attached to copper but not to zinc. Copper sulfides formed during this process assist in the sulfidation of platinum by providing sites for sulfur molecule dissociation and promoting sulfur diffusion into the material's bulk.

The study investigated the interaction of sulfur with Pt(111), Zn/Pt(111), and Cu/Pt(111) surfaces using various spectroscopic techniques. At 300-600 K, sulfur exposure to Pt(111) resulted in a chemisorbed layer without bulk sulfides. Room temperature exposure of S2 to a Zn/Pt(111) alloy led to alloy breakdown and zinc-sulfide film formation on Pt(111). At 550 K, S2 exposure sulfidized the remaining zinc while leaving platinum unaffected. On the Cu/Pt(111) surface, sulfur promoted platinum sulfidation by forming copper sulfides that facilitated sulfur dissociation and diffusion into the bulk system. Platinum could compete for sulfur atoms bonded to copper but not to zinc.

研究使用多种光谱技术考察了硫与Pt(111)、Zn/Pt(111)和Cu/Pt(111)表面的相互作用。在300-600 K下，向Pt(111)暴露硫生成了化学吸附层，没有形成大量硫化物。室温下S2向Zn/Pt(111)合金的暴露导致合金分解并形成了锌硫化物薄膜覆盖在Pt(111)上。在550 K时，S2暴露使剩余的锌硫化而不会影响铂。在Cu/Pt(111)表面上，硫促进了铂的硫化，通过形成铜硫化物来促进硫的分解和扩散到系统的内部。铂可以与铜结合的硫原子竞争，但不能与锌结合的硫原子竞争。
