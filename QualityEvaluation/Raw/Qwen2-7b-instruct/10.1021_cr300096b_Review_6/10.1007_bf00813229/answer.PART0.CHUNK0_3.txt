[1] "The interaction of sulfur with Pt(111), Zn/Pt(111) and Cu/Pt(111) has been examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES), and thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS)."
[2] "For the Cu/Pt(111) surface alloy, exposure to S22 at 550 K leads to sulfidation of the platinum."
[3] "Platinum can effectively compete for sulfur atoms bonded to copper but not for those bonded to zinc."
[4] "The reaction of S2 gas with Cu/Pt(111) surfaces produces copper sulfides that promote the sulfidation of Pt by providing surface sites for the dissociation of S2, and by favoring the diffusion of S into the bulk of the system."

The interaction of sulfur with various surfaces was studied using several techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES), and thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS). When sulfur interacts with a Cu/Pt(111) surface at 550 K, it leads to the sulfidation of platinum. Platinum competes effectively for sulfur atoms attached to copper but not to zinc. Copper sulfides formed during this process assist in the sulfidation of platinum by providing sites for sulfur molecule dissociation and promoting sulfur diffusion into the material's bulk.

对硫与Pt(111)、Zn/Pt(111)和Cu/Pt(111)表面的相互作用进行了研究，使用的技术包括X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、X射线激发阿格电子能谱（XAES）和热脱附质谱（TDS）。当在550 K下将硫暴露于Cu/Pt(111)表面时，会导致铂的硫化。铂可以有效地与铜上连接的硫原子竞争，但不能与锌上的硫原子竞争。在此过程中形成的铜硫化物有助于铂的硫化，通过提供硫分子分解的表面位点并促进硫向体系内部扩散来实现这一过程。
