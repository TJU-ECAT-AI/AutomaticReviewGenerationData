The titania sol was created through templating a TiO2 precursor with Pluronic F127 surfactant. A TiO2 film with the best long-order structure was achieved at a surfactant/Ti molar ratio of 0.009, a pH of 1.5, and an aging time of 24 hours. This film featured a hexagonal pore structure with a mean pore size of 3.5 nm and a porosity of 25%. The PtSn catalysts were prepared on the TiO2 films through adsorption or impregnation of the PtSn mixed-metal clusters from solutions in ethanol or other solvents. The catalysts were then heated in vacuum at 463 K for activation. The prepared PtSn/TiO2 catalysts showed superior performance in the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols compared to crude catalysts made through impregnation-reduction methods. The catalysts were tested with two types of experiments: one involved 50 PtSn/TiO2/Ti plates spaced 2 mm apart, while the other used catalyst pellets with a particle size of 100–200 μm. The main products of the hydrogenation reaction were nerol, geraniol, citrononellal, citronellol, and 3,7-dimethyl-1-octanol.

The unique characteristics of mesostructured titania, namely high surface area, high concentration of hydroxyl groups combined with narrow pore size distribution prevent metal sintering after catalyst deposition. This approach allows a control both of the metal ratio and the loading of the support with the bimetallic nanoparticles. These nanoparticles demonstrate a superior performance in the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols (UA) as compared to the crude catalysts fabricated via impregnation-reduction methods.

Answer: The mesoporous titania films, thanks to their high surface area, hydroxyl group concentration, and narrow pore size distribution, prevent metal sintering after catalyst deposition. This enables precise control over the metal ratio and loading of bimetallic nanoparticles onto the support. The bimetallic nanoparticles show superior performance in selectively hydrogenating unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols (UA) compared to crude catalysts made through impregnation-reduction methods.

The experimental techniques such as FTIR and XRD were used to confirm the complete removal of surfactant and the reduction in film thickness after calcination. The conditions for optimizing the PtSn cluster loading onto TiO<sub>2</sub> included varying the solvent type, precursor concentration, precursor to support ratio, adsorption duration, and activation treatment. The mixed-metal cluster precursor led to a more uniform particle size distribution in the PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts compared to inorganic metal salt precursors.
