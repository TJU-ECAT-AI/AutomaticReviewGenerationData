The unique characteristics of mesostructured titania, namely high surface area, high concentration of hydroxyl groups combined with narrow pore size distribution prevent metal sintering after catalyst deposition. This approach allows a control both of the metal ratio and the loading of the support with the bimetallic nanoparticles. These nanoparticles demonstrate a superior performance in the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols (UA) as compared to the crude catalysts fabricated via impregnation-reduction methods.

Answer: The mesoporous titania films, thanks to their high surface area, hydroxyl group concentration, and narrow pore size distribution, prevent metal sintering after catalyst deposition. This enables precise control over the metal ratio and loading of bimetallic nanoparticles onto the support. The bimetallic nanoparticles show superior performance in selectively hydrogenating unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols (UA) compared to crude catalysts made through impregnation-reduction methods.
