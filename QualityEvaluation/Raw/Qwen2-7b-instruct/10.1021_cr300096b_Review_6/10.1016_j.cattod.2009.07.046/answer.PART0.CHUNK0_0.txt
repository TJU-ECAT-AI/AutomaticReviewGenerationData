The titania sol was created through templating a TiO2 precursor with Pluronic F127 surfactant. A TiO2 film with the best long-order structure was achieved at a surfactant/Ti molar ratio of 0.009, a pH of 1.5, and an aging time of 24 hours. This film featured a hexagonal pore structure with a mean pore size of 3.5 nm and a porosity of 25%. The PtSn catalysts were prepared on the TiO2 films through adsorption or impregnation of the PtSn mixed-metal clusters from solutions in ethanol or other solvents. The catalysts were then heated in vacuum at 463 K for activation. The prepared PtSn/TiO2 catalysts showed superior performance in the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols compared to crude catalysts made through impregnation-reduction methods. The catalysts were tested with two types of experiments: one involved 50 PtSn/TiO2/Ti plates spaced 2 mm apart, while the other used catalyst pellets with a particle size of 100–200 μm. The main products of the hydrogenation reaction were nerol, geraniol, citrononellal, citronellol, and 3,7-dimethyl-1-octanol.

通过模板化TiO2前体与Pluronic F127表面活性剂，制得了提纯溶胶。在0.009的表面活性剂/钛摩尔比、pH为1.5和24小时老化时间下，获得了具有最佳长周期结构的TiO2薄膜。该薄膜具有六角孔结构，平均孔径为3.5 nm，孔隙率为25%。通过在乙醇或其他溶剂中吸附或浸渍PtSn混合金属簇来制备TiO2薄膜上的PtSn催化剂。然后在463 K的真空下加热催化剂进行激活。所制备的PtSn/TiO2催化剂在选择性氢化不饱和醛类到相应的不饱和醇方面表现出了优越性能，与通过浸渍还原方法制备的粗催化剂相比。催化剂通过两种类型实验测试：一种涉及50个PtSn/TiO2/Ti平板，间距2毫米，另一种使用直径为100–200 μm的催化剂颗粒。氢化反应的主要产物为nerol、geraniol、citrononellal、citronellol和3,7-二甲基-1-octanol。
