1. The surfactant was fully removed under mild conditions, indicated by the absence of specific FTIR absorption bands at 1110, 2850, and 2930 cm<sup>-1</sup>. 

2. Ethanol adsorption-desorption isotherms displayed a type IV isotherm with a H1 hysteresis loop at a partial pressure of 0.3 to 0.5, suggesting the presence of confined mesopores.

3. Increasing the F127/Ti molar ratio led to a decrease in unit cell size from 9.3 to 7.0 nm, accompanied by a significant rise in open porosity from 14 to 25%.

4. Various parameters were systematically altered to optimize the PtSn cluster loading onto TiO<sub>2</sub>, including solvent type, precursor concentration, metal precursor to support ratio, adsorption duration, and thermal treatment type.

5. The thermal treatment method did not notably affect the crystalline structure of the Pt<sub>3</sub>Sn nanoparticles.

6. The mixed-metal cluster precursor resulted in a more consistent distribution of metal particles compared to inorganic metal salt precursors, despite similar average particle sizes.

7. PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts prepared using the mixed-metal cluster precursor and oxidation-reduction thermal treatment exhibited a TOF between 0.1 and 0.5 min<sup>-1</sup> and a UA selectivity of 65 to 90%.

1. 在温和条件下，表面活性剂完全去除，通过FTIR吸收谱中在1110、2850和2930 cm<sup>-1</sup>处的特定吸收带的缺失得到证实。

2. 乙醇吸附脱附等温线显示了类型IV等温线和H1滞后环，在乙醇分压为0.3到0.5时，这表明存在限制孔隙结构。

3. 随着F127/Ti摩尔比从6×10<sup>-3</sup>增加到9×10<sup>-3</sup>，单元格尺寸从9.3 nm减小到7.0 nm，开放孔隙率从14%显著增加到25%。

4. 系统地改变了溶剂类型（乙酮、乙醇或四氢呋喃）、前体溶液浓度（2.0 mgPt/ml；1.2 mgSn/ml）、金属前体与支撑材料比例（20ml/g；100ml/g）、吸附时间（2小时；24小时）以及热处理方式（氧气中673 K加热4小时并随后在30体积％H<sub>2</sub>/Ar流中还原至673 K 2小时，或在真空下463 K加热2小时），以优化PtSn簇加载至TiO<sub>2</sub>。

5. 热处理方法对Pt<sub>3</sub>Sn纳米颗粒的晶体结构影响不大。

6. 混合金属簇前体提供了一种更均匀的金属颗粒分布，相比无机金属盐前体，尽管平均颗粒大小相似。

7. 使用混合金属簇前体和氧化还原热处理制备的PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub>催化剂表现出0.1到0.5 min<sup>-1</sup>的TOF和65到90%的UA选择性。
