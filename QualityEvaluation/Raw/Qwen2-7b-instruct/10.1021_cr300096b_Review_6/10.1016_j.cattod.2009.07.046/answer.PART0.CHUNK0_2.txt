<p>The surfactant was completely removed even at mild conditions as confirmed by the absence of the absorption bands at 1110, 2850 and 2930 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the FTIR spectra of the mesoporous titania films.</p>

<p>To optimize the conditions of PtSn cluster loading onto TiO<sub>2</sub>, several synthesis parameters have been systematically varied, among them (i) solvent type (acetone, ethanol, or THF), (ii) concentration of the precursor solution (2.0, 10 mgPt/ml; 1.2, 6.0 mgSn/ml), (iii) the metal precursor to support ratio (20, 100 ml/g), (iv) duration of adsorption (2, 24 h), and (v) type of the activation treatment (calcined in O<sub>2</sub> at 673 K for 4 h and subsequently reduced in a 30 vol.% H<sub>2</sub>/Ar flow at 673 K for 2 h, or in vacuum at 463 K for 2 h).</p>

The experimental techniques such as FTIR and XRD were used to confirm the complete removal of surfactant and the reduction in film thickness after calcination. The conditions for optimizing the PtSn cluster loading onto TiO<sub>2</sub> included varying the solvent type, precursor concentration, precursor to support ratio, adsorption duration, and activation treatment. The mixed-metal cluster precursor led to a more uniform particle size distribution in the PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts compared to inorganic metal salt precursors. The PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts showed a TOF ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 min<sup>-1</sup> and a selectivity to unsaturated alcohols of 65% to 90%.

实验技术，如FTIR和XRD，被用来确认表面活性剂的完全去除以及在煅烧后薄膜厚度的减少。优化PtSn簇加载到TiO<sub>2</sub>的条件包括改变溶剂类型、前体浓度、前体与支持物的比例、吸附时间以及激活处理。混合金属簇前体导致PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub>催化剂的颗粒尺寸分布更加均匀，与无机金属盐前体相比。PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub>催化剂的反应速率范围从0.1到0.5 min<sup>-1</sup>，对不饱和醇的选择性为65%至90%。
