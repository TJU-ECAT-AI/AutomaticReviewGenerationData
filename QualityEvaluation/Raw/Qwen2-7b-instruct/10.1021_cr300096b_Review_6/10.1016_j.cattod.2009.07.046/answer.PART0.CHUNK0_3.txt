1. The surfactant was confirmed to be completely removed through the absence of specific absorption bands in the FTIR spectra of the mesoporous titania films, indicating mild removal conditions.

2. The average pore size of the mesoporous titania films ranged from 3.5 to 6.8 nm, with a total pore volume between 0.04 and 0.16 cm³/g.

3. The exceptionally high turnover frequency (TOF) value for the PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts is attributed to the unique composition of bimetallic particles and the electronic states of the metals.

4. The hydrogenation of citral over the PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts exhibited a reaction rate of between 0.2 and 3.3 min<sup>-1</sup>, with a high selectivity to unsaturated alcohols reaching up to 90% at a citral conversion above 95%.

1. 通过FTIR光谱中特定吸收带的缺失，证实了表面活性剂在温和条件下被完全去除。

2. 纳米多孔二氧化钛薄膜的平均孔径范围为3.5至6.8纳米，总孔体积介于0.04至0.16立方厘米/克之间。

3. PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub>催化剂的高周转频率（TOF）值归因于双金属颗粒的独特组成和金属的电子状态。

4. 在PtSn/TiO<sub>2</sub>催化剂上氢化异戊醛的反应速率在0.2至3.3分钟<sup>-1</sup>之间，具有高达90%的不饱和醇选择性，当异戊醛转化率超过95%时。
