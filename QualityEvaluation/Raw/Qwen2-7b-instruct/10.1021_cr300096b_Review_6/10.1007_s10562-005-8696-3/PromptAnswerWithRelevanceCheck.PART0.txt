The experimental techniques of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. TPD experiments demonstrated that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a temperature range where it does not occur on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds within the catalyst structure, indicating a bimetallic interaction. FTIR measurements under batch reactor conditions revealed that the bimetallic catalyst exhibited higher activity in the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts at room temperature.

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are not explicitly mentioned in the provided literature. However, the study correlates the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts through various methods. TPD experiments demonstrate that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, indicating the presence of a synergistic effect between Co and Pt. EXAFS experiments confirm the formation of CoPt bonds in the catalyst structure, suggesting a metallic interaction between the two metals. The bimetallic catalyst shows higher activity towards the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene compared to single-metal catalysts under certain conditions, providing evidence for the enhanced reactivity of bimetallic systems.

在提供的文献中，没有明确提到用于验证和量化氧诱导表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分层的实验技术。然而，通过各种方法研究了Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与支持的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的相关性。TPD实验表明，在219 K时，cyclohexene可以在1 ML Co/Pt(111)表面上进行自我氢化，这表明Co和Pt之间存在协同效应。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在CoPt键的存在，暗示了两种金属之间的金属相互作用。双金属催化剂在某些条件下对cyclohexene的自我氢化表现出更高的活性，为增强的双金属体系反应性提供了证据。

Answer: The low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene was used to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. TPD experiments revealed that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a process that does not occur on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on high surface area γ-Al2O3 to confirm the bimetallic effect on cyclohexene hydrogenation. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds within the catalyst structure. The bimetallic catalyst demonstrated higher activity in the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

使用低温度下环己烯的氢化反应，作为探针反应，来关联Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与支持在γ-Al2O3上的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的活性。TPD实验显示，在219K的低温下，环己烯在1ML的Co/Pt(111)表面上发生自氢化，这一过程在纯Pt(111)或在Pt(111)上厚的Co膜上均不发生。在高表面积γ-Al2O3上合成具有1:1原子比的Co:Pt的催化剂，以验证双金属效应对环己烯自氢化的影响力。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在的CoPt键。通过在批式反应器配置中使用FTIR，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯的自氢化表现出比Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂更高的活性。

The study utilized several experimental techniques to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for the low-temperature self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. TPD experiments demonstrated that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a phenomenon not observed on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111).

FTIR measurements in a batch reactor configuration revealed that the bimetallic catalyst exhibited higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This comparison served as an excellent example of linking the self-hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene on bimetallic model surfaces to supported catalysts.

研究使用了几种实验技术来将Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与支持在γ-Al2O3上的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的活性进行相关联，用于低温度的环己烯自氢化反应。TPD实验表明，环己烯在219 K的温度下于1 ML Co/Pt(111)表面上发生自氢化，而纯Pt(111)或Pt(111)上厚的Co薄膜上没有观察到这种现象。在γ-Al2O3上合成具有1:1原子比的Co:Pt的催化剂以验证双金属效应。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在CoPt键。在批处理反应器配置下进行的FTIR测量显示，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯的自氢化活性高于Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂。这种比较为将环己烯在双金属模型表面的自氢化活性与支持催化剂的相关性提供了很好的例子。
