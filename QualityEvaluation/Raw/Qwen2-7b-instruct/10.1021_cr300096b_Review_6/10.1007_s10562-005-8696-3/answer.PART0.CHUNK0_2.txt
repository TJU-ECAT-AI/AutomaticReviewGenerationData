The low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments show that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, which does not occur on either pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111).
Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to verify the bimetallic effect on the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds in the catalyst. Using FTIR in a batch reactor configuration, the bimetallic catalyst showed a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

Answer: The low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene was used to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. TPD experiments revealed that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a process that does not occur on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on high surface area γ-Al2O3 to confirm the bimetallic effect on cyclohexene hydrogenation. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds within the catalyst structure. The bimetallic catalyst demonstrated higher activity in the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

使用低温度下环己烯的氢化反应，作为探针反应，来关联Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与支持在γ-Al2O3上的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的活性。TPD实验显示，在219K的低温下，环己烯在1ML的Co/Pt(111)表面上发生自氢化，这一过程在纯Pt(111)或在Pt(111)上厚的Co膜上均不发生。在高表面积γ-Al2O3上合成具有1:1原子比的Co:Pt的催化剂，以验证双金属效应对环己烯自氢化的影响力。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在的CoPt键。通过在批式反应器配置中使用FTIR，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯的自氢化表现出比Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂更高的活性。
