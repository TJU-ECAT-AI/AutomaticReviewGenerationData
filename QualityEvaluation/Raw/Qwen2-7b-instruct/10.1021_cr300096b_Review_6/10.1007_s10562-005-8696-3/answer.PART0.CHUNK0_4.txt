The experimental techniques of TPD and FTIR were used to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts through the low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction. TPD experiments revealed that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, which does not occur on either pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to confirm the bimetallic effect. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds in the catalyst, and FTIR measurements in a batch reactor configuration demonstrated that the bimetallic catalyst had a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

使用TPD和FTIR等实验技术，通过低温度下环己烯的自我氢化（分解）作为探针反应，将Co/Pt(111)双金属表面的活性与支持的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的相关性进行了关联。TPD实验表明，环己烯在219 K的温度下可以在1 ML的Co/Pt(111)表面上进行自我氢化，而在纯Pt(111)或厚的Co层上均不发生此反应。在高比表面积γ-Al2O3上合成了Co:Pt原子比为1:1的催化剂以验证双金属效应。EXAFS实验证实了催化剂中存在CoPt键，并且在批次反应器配置下的FTIR测量显示，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯自我氢化的活性高于Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂。
