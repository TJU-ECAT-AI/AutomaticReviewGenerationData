[1] "The low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts."
[2] "Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments show that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, which does not occur on either pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111)."
[3] "Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to verify the bimetallic effect on the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene."
[4] "EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds in the catalyst."
[5] "Using FTIR in a batch reactor configuration, the bimetallic catalyst showed a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts."

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are not explicitly mentioned in the provided literature. However, the study correlates the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts through various methods. TPD experiments demonstrate that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, indicating the presence of a synergistic effect between Co and Pt. EXAFS experiments confirm the formation of CoPt bonds in the catalyst structure, suggesting a metallic interaction between the two metals. The bimetallic catalyst shows higher activity towards the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene compared to single-metal catalysts under certain conditions, providing evidence for the enhanced reactivity of bimetallic systems.

在提供的文献中，没有明确提到用于验证和量化氧诱导表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分层的实验技术。然而，通过各种方法研究了Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与支持的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的相关性。TPD实验表明，在219 K时，cyclohexene可以在1 ML Co/Pt(111)表面上进行自我氢化，这表明Co和Pt之间存在协同效应。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在CoPt键的存在，暗示了两种金属之间的金属相互作用。双金属催化剂在某些条件下对cyclohexene的自我氢化表现出更高的活性，为增强的双金属体系反应性提供了证据。
