The low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments show that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, which does not occur on either pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111).
Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to verify the bimetallic effect on the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene.
EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds in the catalyst.
Using FTIR in a batch reactor configuration, the bimetallic catalyst showed a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.
The comparison of Co/Pt(111) and Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 provided an excellent example of correlating the self-hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene on bimetallic model surfaces and supported catalysts.

The study utilized several experimental techniques to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for the low-temperature self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. TPD experiments demonstrated that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a phenomenon not observed on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on γ-Al2O3 to confirm the bimetallic effect. EXAFS experiments confirmed the formation of CoPt bonds within the catalyst. FTIR measurements in a batch reactor configuration revealed that the bimetallic catalyst exhibited higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This comparison served as an excellent example of linking the self-hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene on bimetallic model surfaces to supported catalysts.

研究使用了几种实验技术来将Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与支持在γ-Al2O3上的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的活性进行相关联，用于低温度的环己烯自氢化反应。TPD实验表明，环己烯在219 K的温度下于1 ML Co/Pt(111)表面上发生自氢化，而纯Pt(111)或Pt(111)上厚的Co薄膜上没有观察到这种现象。在γ-Al2O3上合成具有1:1原子比的Co:Pt的催化剂以验证双金属效应。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在CoPt键。在批处理反应器配置下进行的FTIR测量显示，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯的自氢化活性高于Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂。这种比较为将环己烯在双金属模型表面的自氢化活性与支持催化剂的相关性提供了很好的例子。
