[1] "The low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts."
[2] "Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments show that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, which does not occur on either pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111)."
[3] "Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to verify the bimetallic effect on the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene."

[5] "Using FTIR in a batch reactor configuration, the bimetallic catalyst showed a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts."

The experimental techniques of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. TPD experiments demonstrated that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a temperature range where it does not occur on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds within the catalyst structure, indicating a bimetallic interaction. FTIR measurements under batch reactor conditions revealed that the bimetallic catalyst exhibited higher activity in the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts at room temperature.

实验技术，包括温度程序脱附（TPD）、X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）和傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR），用于将Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与支持的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂在环己烯自我氢化反应中的活性进行相关联。TPD实验表明，环己烯在219 K时在Co/Pt(111)表面上进行自我氢化，而此温度下纯Pt(111)或厚Co膜上Pt(111)表面不发生此反应。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在的CoPt键的存在，表明存在双金属作用。FTIR测量在批处理反应器配置下显示，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯自我氢化的活性高于Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂。
