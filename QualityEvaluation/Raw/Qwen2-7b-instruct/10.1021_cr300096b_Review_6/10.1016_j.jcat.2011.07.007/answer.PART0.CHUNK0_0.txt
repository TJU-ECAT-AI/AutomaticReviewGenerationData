<p>The presence of Re and Pt together is critical in providing an active catalyst.</p>
<p>Clearly, the presence of Re and Pt is crucial for the high activity observed.</p>
<p>Density functional theory calculations clearly demonstrated that the role of the Re was to activate the CO bond, whereas the Pt aided the reduction of the ReO and enabled the formation of water and the amine.</p>
<p>Monometallic systems were shown not to provide the appropriate bifunctional capability.</p>
