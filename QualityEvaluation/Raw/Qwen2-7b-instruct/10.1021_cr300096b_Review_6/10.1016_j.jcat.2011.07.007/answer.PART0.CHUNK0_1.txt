[1] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate the reaction mechanism on four transition metal surfaces (Re, Ru, Rh and Pt) with monatomic steps."
[2] "On the stepped Re surface, the overall activation barrier was found to be 2.74 eV, i.e. substantially higher than that found for the CO bond breaking over the same surface (0.91 eV), implying that the hydrogenation of oxygen is the rate-determining step."
[3] "In contrast, bimetallic catalysts can provide the necessary bifunctional sites to enable both the cleavage and the oxygen reduction, as shown for the PtRe catalytic system reported in this paper."

The DFT calculations revealed that the activation barrier for carbonyl activation increases while the overall barriers for subsequent hydrogenations decrease in the order of metal reactivities: Re, Ru, Rh, and Pt. The hydrogenation of oxygen becomes the rate-determining step on the Re surface. Bimetallic catalysts, such as PtRe, offer the required dual functionality for both CO bond cleavage and oxygen reduction, making them efficient for the hydrogenation of N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one.

密度泛函理论计算显示，碳氧键激活能随着金属活性的增加而增加，而后续氢化步骤的总势垒则依次降低：Re、Ru、Rh、Pt。在Re表面，氢化氧成为决定性步骤。双金属催化剂，如PtRe，提供了必要的双重功能，既能够裂解CO键，又可以进行氧还原，这使得它们对于N-甲基吡咯烷-2-酮的氢化反应效率很高。
