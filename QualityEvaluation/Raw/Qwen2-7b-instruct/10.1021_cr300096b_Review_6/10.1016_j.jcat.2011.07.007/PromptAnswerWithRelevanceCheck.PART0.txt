How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<p>The presence of Re and Pt together is critical in providing an active catalyst.</p>
<p>Clearly, the presence of Re and Pt is crucial for the high activity observed.</p>
<p>Density functional theory calculations clearly demonstrated that the role of the Re was to activate the CO bond, whereas the Pt aided the reduction of the ReO and enabled the formation of water and the amine.</p>
<p>Monometallic systems were shown not to provide the appropriate bifunctional capability.</p>

[1] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate the reaction mechanism on four transition metal surfaces (Re, Ru, Rh and Pt) with monatomic steps."
[2] "On the stepped Re surface, the overall activation barrier was found to be 2.74 eV, i.e. substantially higher than that found for the CO bond breaking over the same surface (0.91 eV), implying that the hydrogenation of oxygen is the rate-determining step."
[3] "In contrast, bimetallic catalysts can provide the necessary bifunctional sites to enable both the cleavage and the oxygen reduction, as shown for the PtRe catalytic system reported in this paper."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The DFT calculations revealed that the activation barrier for carbonyl activation increases while the overall barriers for subsequent hydrogenations decrease in the order of metal reactivities: Re, Ru, Rh, and Pt. The hydrogenation of oxygen becomes the rate-determining step on the Re surface. Bimetallic catalysts, such as PtRe, offer the required dual functionality for both CO bond cleavage and oxygen reduction, making them efficient for the hydrogenation of N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
密度泛函理论计算显示，碳氧键激活能随着金属活性的增加而增加，而后续氢化步骤的总势垒则依次降低：Re、Ru、Rh、Pt。在Re表面，氢化氧成为决定性步骤。双金属催化剂，如PtRe，提供了必要的双重功能，既能够裂解CO键，又可以进行氧还原，这使得它们对于N-甲基吡咯烷-2-酮的氢化反应效率很高。

<p>The effect of solvent on the reaction time profile for the hydrogenation of N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one. There is a large solvent effect with the following rate order: hexane > tetrahydrofuran > diethyl ether > methanol > methyl tert-butyl ether.</p>
<p>Although the reactions proceeded to completion under mild conditions over the fresh catalyst, with conversions of 92% being obtained in 24 h, the conversion decreased to 67% on the second run and to only 6% on the fifth run, when simply washed with solvent between each runs.</p>
<p>To obtain a general understanding of the trends of hydrogenation of N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one (MPDO), Scheme 1 , DFT calculations were used to investigate the reaction mechanism on four transition metal surfaces (Re, Ru, Rh and Pt) with monatomic steps.</p>
<p>It is clear from these results why it is very difficult for pure metals to efficiently catalyse the hydrogenation of MPDO due to the balance between having sufficient oxophilicity to activate the CO bond, whilst also enabling facile oxygen hydrogenation. In contrast, bimetallic catalysts can provide the necessary bifunctional sites to enable both the cleavage and the oxygen reduction, as shown for the PtRe catalytic system reported in this paper.</p>

<p>Significantly lower activity was observed for both CeZrO4 and Al2O3 supports.</p>
<p>Neither the surface areas or pore volumes of the catalysts examined ( Table 1 ) can be correlated with their activity showing that these are not fundamental factors in achieving high conversions and selectivities.</p>

<p>Little activity for the bare supports was observed with the exception of the CeZrO4 support, where 10% conversion was found after 20 h and, in this case, 49% selectivity to the amine was observed with the balance found to be 1-butanol.</p>
<p>Clearly, the presence of Re and Pt together is critical in providing an active catalyst.</p>

<p>The TPR analysis of the 4 wt%Pt4 wt%Re/TiO2 catalyst shows three peaks at 3 C, 40 C, and 400600 C.</p>
<p>The TPR is in good agreement with recently reported EXAFS results on these systems [30] , which shows that under both gas phase and liquid phase reduction of the catalysts, the predominant state of the both Pt and Re are zero valent, irrespective of the support used.</p>
<p>From the values available, the rate of reaction is found to increase with the solubility of hydrogen in the solvent.</p>
<p>The strong adsorption of the amide on the surface in a non-polar solvent was demonstrated by contacting a pre-reduced catalyst with a hexane solution of amide in a nitrogen atmosphere for 3 h before reaction.</p>
<p>Although drying and recalcination went someway to restore the initial activity with conversions increasing again to 53% and 30% after each treatment, respectively, the initial high activity was not completely regained.</p>
