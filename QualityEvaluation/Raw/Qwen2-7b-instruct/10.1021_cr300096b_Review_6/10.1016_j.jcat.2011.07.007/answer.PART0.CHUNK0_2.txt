1. Lower activity was noted for CeZrO4 and Al2O3 supports compared to TiO2.
2. All supported platinum-rhenium catalysts showed 100% selectivity towards N-methylpyrrolidine.
3. The combination of Re and Pt was essential for creating an active catalyst.
4. Increasing Re loading from 0.25 wt% to 1 wt% led to a notable increase in catalyst activity, with no further improvement upon reaching 4 wt%.
5. The reaction rate order was hexane > tetrahydrofuran > diethyl ether > methanol > methyl tert-butyl ether.
6. Catalyst activity declined significantly after multiple uses, even with solvent washing.
7. DFT calculations provided insights into the hydrogenation mechanism on various transition metal surfaces.
8. Pure metals struggled to effectively catalyze MPDO hydrogenation due to the balance between oxophilicity and oxygen hydrogenation. Bimetallic catalysts, like PtRe, offered the necessary bifunctional sites for efficient catalysis.

1. 对于CeZrO4和Al2O3载体，观察到较低的活性。
2. 所有负载铂和铑的催化剂均表现出100%的N-甲基吡咯啶选择性。
3. 铂和铑的结合对于形成活性催化剂至关重要。
4. 将Re负载从0.25 wt%增加到1 wt%，催化剂活性显著提高，但在达到4 wt%时未见进一步改善。
5. 反应速率顺序为：己烷 > 四氢呋喃 > 乙二醇醚 > 甲醇 > 甲基叔丁基醚。
6. 在多次使用后，即使进行了溶剂清洗，催化剂活性也明显下降。
7. DFT计算提供了关于在各种过渡金属表面氢化机理的见解。
8. 纯金属难以有效地催化MPDO氢化，因为它们在亲氧性和氧气氢化之间存在平衡。双金属催化剂，如PtRe，提供了高效催化所需的必要的双功能位点。
