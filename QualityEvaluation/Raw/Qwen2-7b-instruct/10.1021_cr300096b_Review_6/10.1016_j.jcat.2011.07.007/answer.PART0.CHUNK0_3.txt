1. Lower activity was observed for CeZrO4 and Al2O3 supports compared to TiO2.
2. Surface area and pore volume did not correlate with catalyst activity.
3. All Pt-Re supported catalysts showed 100% selectivity to N-methylpyrrolidine.
4. Bare supports showed limited activity except for CeZrO4, which had 10% conversion.
5. The combination of Re and Pt was essential for catalyst activity.
6. Increasing Re loading from 0.25 wt% to 1 wt% enhanced catalyst activity.
7. The TPR analysis indicated the presence of Pt and Re in a zero-valent state.
8. Reaction rate increased with hydrogen solubility in the solvent.
9. Amide showed strong adsorption on the surface in a non-polar solvent.
10. Drying and recalcination improved but did not fully restore initial activity.

1. CeZrO4和Al2O3支持的催化剂显示出较低的活性，相比之下TiO2较好。
2. 表面积和孔体积与催化剂活性不成正比。
3. 所有的Pt-Re支持催化剂对N-甲基吡咯烷酮显示出100%的选择性。
4. 除了CeZrO4之外，裸露的支持物显示有限的活性，其中在20小时后有10%的转化率，并且在这种情况下，胺的选择性为49%，剩余的是1-丁醇。
5. 铂和铼的结合是提供活性催化剂的关键。
6. 将铼负载从0.25 wt%增加到1 wt%显著提高了催化剂的活性。
7. TPR分析表明铂和铼以零价状态存在，无论支持材料如何。
8. 反应速率随着溶剂中氢气的溶解度增加而增加。
9. 在非极性溶剂中，胺在表面表现出强烈的吸附。
10. 干燥和重新煅烧改善了活性，但没有完全恢复初始的高活性。
