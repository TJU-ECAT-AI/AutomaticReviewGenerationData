DFT study of adsorption and dissociation of thiophene molecules on Ni(1 1 0)
C. Morin a,*, A. Eichler b, R. Hirschl b, P. Sautet a, J. Hafner b

The different adsorption possibilities of thiophene (C4H4S) on the Ni(1 1 0) surface have been studied using first principle local-density-functional calculations, with the Vienna ab initio simulation package, which is based on a plane wave basis set and projector augmented wave potentials. For each configuration, a geometric optimisation has been performed. A detailed analysis of the structural and electronic properties of the molecule and the surface in the most stable conformations is presented, showing the combined roles of the molecular distortion and the interactions between the molecule and the surface. Three structures with comparatively large adsorption energies are identified, all with the molecule plane parallel to the surface.
Starting from these stabilised structures, various scenarios for the desulfurisation process have been envisaged.
While, for the most stable structure, the formation of an adsorbed thiol is an activated process, with an energetic barrier of 0.70 eV, the two structures which are just a bit less stable can dissociate to a C4H4 species and a sulfur atom with barriers as low as 0.07 eV. A description of the different transition states and a kinetic analysis of the desulfurisation reaction is also presented. 

Influence of the magnetism on the adsorption energies Nickel surfaces are evidently magnetic, and it may be important to take this into account in the calculation of adsorption energies. Table 4 shows the results obtained for the adsorption energies for the four most stable structures. We allowed in these calculations a spin polarisation for all atoms, and a new relaxation of the geometries. The analysis of the final geometries shows that the magnetisation does not change the adsorption structures at all.
Secondly, as presented in Fig. 3, in the ferromagnetic state, the total nickel-DOS for the surface with the adsorbates is strongly reduced at the Fermi level, while on the clean surface the paramagnetic d-band DOS has a maximum at the Fermi level such that the Stoner-criterion for the formation of a ferromagnetic ground state is satisfied. For the nickel atoms interacting with the adsorbate, the paramagnetic DOS is reduced by a factor of at least two. While a non-bonded nickel atom has a magnetic moment in a range of 0.638 – 0.684 lB, compared to m = 0.712 lB for the clean surface, a bonded nickel atom has a moment of about the half, in a range of 0.277 – 0.361 lB (for a detailed discussion of the magnetisation of nickel surfaces, see [42]). Hence molecular or atomic adsorbates induce a local demagnetisation of an initially magnetic substrate, as already reported for CO adsorption on nickel [43] and on α- and γ-Fe [44,45].

Study of desulfurisation pathways As seen above, three different stable structures are found for the adsorption of thiophene on Ni(1 1 0). Experimentally, it is known that this molecule dissociates on Ni(1 0 0) [5]. In this case, using DFT calculations [25], Mittendorfer and Hafner showed that the energetic barrier for a direct desulfurisation is 0.71 eV, starting from the most stable adsorption structure which has already one broken carbonsulfur bond. This reaction is also found to be exothermic, with a heat of reaction of 0.61 eV. Due to the relatively high barrier, dissociation will occur only at elevated temperatures. On the Ni(1 1 0) surface, the observation of reactivity of bithiophene at low temperatures [19] suggests a much lower barrier for the dissociation of bithiophene and thiophene.

The DFT study reveals that the most stable adsorption structure of thiophene on Ni(1 1 0) surface leads to a thiol formation via an activated reaction with an energetic barrier of 0.70 eV. The two other stable configurations can lead to a total dissociation into a C4H4 fragment and a sulfur atom, with low barriers (0.07 eV). The analysis of the adsorption energies, structural distortions, and electronic properties provides insights into the complex behavior of thiophene on Ni surfaces, highlighting the increased reactivity of Ni(1 1 0) compared to more densely packed Ni surfaces. The study also demonstrates that the open, corrugated structure of the Ni(1 1 0) substrate enables a variety of locally stable adsorption configurations, leading to different reaction pathways and transition states for the desulfurization of thiophene.

The influence of spin polarization on the adsorption energies shows that the presence of molecular or atomic adsorbates induces a local demagnetization of the initially magnetic substrate, reducing the magnetic moment of bonded nickel atoms by about half compared to non-bonded atoms. The analysis of the adsorption energies indicates a common shift of about 0.4 eV across different structures due to the local demagnetization effect and the exchange splitting of the Ni d-band, which reduces the hybridization of substrate and adsorbate orbitals.

Regarding the desulfurization pathways, the study identifies three stable adsorption structures for thiophene on Ni(1 1 0). Starting from these configurations, the reaction paths and transition states for desulfurization have been investigated. The most stable adsorption structure leads to thiol formation via an activated process with an energetic barrier of 0.70 eV. The other two configurations allow for total dissociation into a C4H4 fragment and a sulfur atom with low barriers (0.07 eV). The study thus provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex desulfurization behavior of thiophene on Ni(1 1 0) surfaces, accounting for the interplay between molecular structure, adsorption energetics, and local surface magnetism.

研究发现，噻吩分子在Ni(1 1 0)表面的最大吸附结构导致通过一个活化过程形成硫醇，具有能垒为0.70 eV。另外两个较稳定的配置可以导致分子完全分解成一个C4H4碎片和一个硫原子，能垒分别为0.07 eV。吸附能量、结构畸变和电子性质的分析揭示了噻吩分子在Ni表面的复杂行为，并突出了Ni(1 1 0)表面相对于更紧密排列的Ni表面的增强反应性。研究还表明，开放、波纹状的Ni(1 1 0)基底允许多种局部稳定吸附配置，导致不同路径和过渡状态的噻吩脱硫化。

磁性影响下的吸附能研究表明，分子或原子吸附剂诱导初始磁性基底局部去磁化，使与吸附剂结合的镍原子的磁矩降低一半左右，而非结合原子。吸附能分析表明，由于局部去磁化效应和Ni d带交换分裂导致的Ni d带杂化减少，所有结构的能量普遍降低约0.4 eV。

关于脱硫化路径的研究，识别了噻吩在Ni(1 1 0)表面的三个稳定吸附结构。从这些配置出发，进行了脱硫化路径和过渡态的调查。最稳定的吸附结构导致通过活化过程形成硫醇，能垒为0.70 eV。其他两个配置允许完全分解成一个C4H4碎片和一个硫原子，能垒分别为0.07 eV。因此，该研究提供了对Ni(1 1 0)表面噻吩脱硫化行为的全面理解，考虑了分子结构、吸附热力学和表面磁性之间的相互作用。
