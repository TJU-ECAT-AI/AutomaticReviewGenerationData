[1] "Starting from the three most stable adsorption configurations, the reaction paths and transition states for desulfurisation of the molecule have been investigated. The most stable adsorption structure of thiophene leads to a thiol via an ac- tivated reaction with an energetic barrier of 0.70 eV. The two other ones can lead to a total disso- ciation into a C4H4 fragment and a sulfur atom,with low barriers (0.07 meV)."
[2] "The role of spin polarisation has been clarified: even if the adsorption energies are lowered, neither the geometries of the adsorption structures do change, nor does their relative stability."

The most stable adsorption structure of thiophene leads to a thiol through an activated reaction with an energetic barrier of 0.70 eV. The two other stable adsorption configurations can lead to total dissociation into a C4H4 fragment and a sulfur atom with low barriers of 0.07 meV.
Even though the application of spin polarization affects the adsorption energies, the geometries of the adsorption structures do not change, nor do their relative stabilities.

最稳定的吸附结构的噻吩通过一个具有0.70 eV能量壁垒的激活反应转化为硫醇。另外两个稳定的吸附配置可以导致完全分解为一个C4H4片段和一个硫原子，具有低壁垒的0.07 meV。尽管自旋极化的作用降低了吸附能，但吸附结构的几何形状并没有改变，它们的相对稳定性也没有变化。
