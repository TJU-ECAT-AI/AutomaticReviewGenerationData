<p>The calculations have been performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [30,31]. This code solves the KohnSham equations of DFT using a plane wave basis set. The projector augmented wave method [32,33] has been used to describe the electron-ion interaction. It is a frozen core method which uses the exact valence-wave functions instead of pseudo-wave functions. Exchange and correlation effects are treated in the generalised gradient approximation (GGA), in the formulation of Perdew-Wang-91 [34]. For the plane wave set, a cutoffenergy of 400 eV has been used.</p>
<p>In order to construct the Ni slab, the optimised bulk NiNi distance has been used (2.50 A). This value compares very well with the experimental result (2.49 A).</p>
<p>The transition states (TS) of the reaction were determined using the nudged-elastic-band method [37], which is based on an explicit mapping of the reaction path. A chain of structures is constructed between the initial reactants and the final reaction products. These images are simultaneously opti- mised with additional elastic forces in order to obtain the reaction path.</p>
<p>The kinetic constants have been calculated with the conventional transition-state theory [38,39],the partition functions for reactants and transition states being calculated using the harmonic ap- proximation.</p>
<p>Two different slab thicknesses have been tested,with four and six layers of nickel. In both cases,the slabs are separated by a vacuum of 14 A. The
adsorption energies (see Table 1) in the case of the six-layer slab are lowered by DEads  0:080:18 eV,compared to the case of four layers, but the dif- ferences between the adsorption energies of the different structures are almost the same (the most important variation in the differences is less than 25 meV for the most stable structures). Moreover,the geometries of the structures are almost the same in both cases (the most important variation is of 0.01 A).</p>
<p>The influence of the magnetism on the adsorption energies Nickel surfaces are evidently magnetic, and it may be important to take this into account in the -20 -10 0 upright 4a1 5a1 3b2 6a1 4b2 7a1 8a1 9a1 2b1 1a2 6b1 1b2 5b2 9a1 9a1 upright flat.4 gas phase flat.4 clean Ni slab E(eV) (f) (e) (d) (c) (b) (a)</p>
<p>Fig. 3 shows the DOS projected on the carbon and sulfur atoms of the molecule and on the nickel atom nearest to the sulfur atom, for flat.4 and upright adsorption structures. The projection on the molecule shows that there is a strong interac- tion between the molecule and the substrate, in- volving a shift toward higher binding energies. The 2b1 and 1a2 orbitals of the gas phase molecule,correspondingto the p-system, are strongly smeared in the adsorbed structures, confirming that the mole- cule is linked to the substrate through its p-system.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results provide a reasonable scenario for the complex behaviour of thiophene on Ni surfaces, demonstrating the increased reac- tivity of Ni(1 1 0) compared to the more close packed Ni surfaces.</p>

1. The calculations utilized the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) which employs the plane wave basis set and solves the Kohn-Sham equations of DFT. The projector augmented wave method was applied to describe electron-ion interactions, using exact valence-wave functions. Exchange and correlation effects were handled through the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew-Wang-91 formulation. A cutoff energy of 400 eV was set for the plane wave set. The optimised bulk NiNi distance was 2.50 Å, closely matching the experimental value of 2.49 Å. Transition states were determined using the nudged-elastic-band method, creating a reaction path between reactants and products. Kinetic constants were calculated using the conventional transition-state theory, with partition functions for reactants and transition states computed using the harmonic approximation. Two slab thickness tests were conducted, with four and six layers of nickel, and the adsorption energies were slightly reduced with a six-layer slab, though the differences between structures remained minimal. The influence of magnetism on adsorption energies was considered, noting that magnetic surfaces could impact calculations. The density of states (DOS) projection revealed a strong interaction between the molecule and substrate, confirming a p-system connection. The results provided a comprehensive understanding of thiophene behavior on Ni surfaces, highlighting increased reactivity on Ni(1 1 0) compared to closely packed surfaces.

1. 计算使用了维也纳原子初始化模拟包（VASP），它采用平面波基组并求解DFT的Kohn-Sham方程。应用了投影加权波方法来描述电子-离子相互作用，使用了精确的价态波函数。交换和相关效应通过Perdew-Wang-91格式的广义梯度近似（GGA）处理。平面波集的截止能量设为400 eV。优化的NiNi距离为2.50 Å，与实验值2.49 Å非常接近。过渡状态通过拉伸弹性带法确定，创建了一条从反应物到产物的反应路径。通过常规过渡态理论计算了动力学常数，反应物和过渡态的密度函数（DOS）投影使用了谐振近似。进行了两种不同厚度的测试，四层和六层镍，六层镍结构的吸附能略有降低，但不同结构之间的差异很小。考虑了磁性对吸附能的影响，磁性表面可能会影响计算结果。DOS投影揭示了分子与基板之间强烈的相互作用，确认了通过p系统连接。结果提供了对噻吩在Ni表面上复杂行为的全面理解，强调了Ni(1 1 0)表面与紧密排列表面相比的增强反应性。
