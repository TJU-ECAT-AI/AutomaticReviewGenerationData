The main effect of Sn modification is the reduction of the decomposition of molecular 1-butene, which practically does not occur on the (p3 · p3)R30 Sn/Pt(111) surface [21].

The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface increases the production of hexane by a factor of 5.5, while causing little change in the other reaction pathways.

The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. 

The comparison of 1-butene with the two C6 alkenes indicates that the chain length (or molecular weight) has a significant effect on the self-hydrogenation activity.

1. The application of tin (Sn) modification notably decreases the decomposition of molecular 1-butene, essentially preventing its occurrence on the (p3 · p3)R30 Sn/Pt(111) surface.

2. The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen significantly enhances the production of hexane, increasing it by a factor of 5.5, with minimal impact on other reaction pathways.

3. Comparing 1-hexene with cyclohexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface reveals comparable self-hydrogenation activity for both compounds.

4. The study demonstrates that the chain length or molecular weight significantly affects the self-hydrogenation activity, with 1-butene showing a notable absence of this process.

1. 添加锡（Sn）修饰显著减少了分子1-丁烯的分解，基本上阻止了在(p3·p3)R30 Sn/Pt(111)表面上的这种分解。

2. 表面预吸附的氢显著增加了己烷的生成，使其增加了5.5倍，对其他反应路径的影响微乎其微。

3. 将1-己烯与环己烯在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面进行比较揭示了两种化合物相似的自我加氢活性。

4. 研究表明链长或分子量显著影响自我加氢活性，1-丁烯显示出这种过程的明显缺失。
