<p>The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface increases the production of hexane by a factor of 5.5, while causing little change in the other reaction pathways.</p>
<p>The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The main difference is the much higher dehydrogenation activity in cyclohexene to produce benzene.</p>
<p>The comparison of 1-butene with the two C6 alkenes indicates that the chain length (or molecular weight) has a significant effect on the self-hydrogenation activity. The self-hydrogenation is nearly absent for 1-butene on ML Ni/Pt(111), most likely due to the relatively low desorption temperature of molecularly adsorbed 1-butene.</p>

1. The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen significantly increases the production of hexane by a factor of 5.5, with minimal impact on other reaction pathways.
2. Both 1-hexene and cyclohexene exhibit similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, with cyclohexene showing notably higher dehydrogenation activity to form benzene.
3. The self-hydrogenation pathway is almost nonexistent for 1-butene on ML Ni/Pt(111), primarily because of the low desorption temperature of molecularly adsorbed 1-butene.

1. 预吸附的氢原子在表面上的存在可以将己烷的生成量增加5.5倍，对其他反应路径的影响较小。
2. 己烯和环己烯在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面表现出相似的自我加氢活性，而环己烯的脱氢活性更高，能形成苯。
3. 对于丁烯而言，在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上几乎没有自我加氢途径，主要原因是分子吸附的丁烯的脱附温度较低。
