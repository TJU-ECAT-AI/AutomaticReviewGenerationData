[1] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface increases the production of hexane by a factor of 5.5, while causing little change in the other reaction pathways."
[2] "The desorption of hexane, from the self-hydrogenation of 1-hexene on ML Ni/Pt(111), occurs at 247 K (Fig. 2), which is identical to the desorption of molecularly adsorbed hexane from the same surface (Fig. 4)."
[3] "The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."
[4] "Despite the absence of the self-hydrogenation pathway, the hydrogenation of 1-butene occurs readily on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen."

1. The presence of hydrogen on the surface boosts hexane production by 5.5 times without significantly affecting other pathways.
2. The desorption of hexane from the self-hydrogenation process of 1-hexene on ML Ni/Pt(111) happens at 247 K, matching the desorption of molecular hexane.
3. Both 1-hexene and cyclohexene exhibit comparable self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface.
4. Although lacking a self-hydrogenation pathway, 1-butene's hydrogenation takes place easily on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface with pre-adsorbed hydrogen.

1. 氢吸附在表面可以将己烷产量提升5.5倍，对其他路径影响较小。
2. 从1-己烯自氢化过程在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上释放己烷发生在247 K，与分子态己烷的释放温度相同。
3. 1-己烯和环己烯在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面表现出相似的自氢化活性。
4. 尽管缺乏自我氢化途径，但在预吸附氢的存在下，1-丁烯可以在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上容易地进行氢化。
