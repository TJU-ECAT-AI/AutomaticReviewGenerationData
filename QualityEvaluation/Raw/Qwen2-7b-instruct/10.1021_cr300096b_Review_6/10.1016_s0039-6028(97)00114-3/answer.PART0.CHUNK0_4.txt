[1] "The adsorption and decomposition of a series of alkenes  ethylene, propylene and isobutylene  on Pt(111) and the (2×2) and Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was investigated with temperature programmed desorption (TPD), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and sticking coefficient measurements."
[2] "Considering propylene and isobutylene as methyl-substituted ethylene reveals a small trend toward decreasing adsorption energy and on all of these surfaces as the amount of methyl substitution increases."
[3] "This implicates that the Pt-only three-fold hollow sites are very important for strong alkene chemisorption, since removal of these sites on the alloy causes a sharper decrease in the adsorption energy than expected based upon the changes observed for the (2×2) alloy."
[4] "The sticking coefficient curves appeared very similar to those that we have reported previously for cyclohexene on these surfaces [16] , except that we observed a stronger precursor influence (constant sticking coefficient) for C2H4 adsorption on Pt(111) at 100 K compared to cyclohexene adsorption on Pt(111) at 180 K."
[5] "We have shown very clearly in our previous studies of the adsorption of isobutane on these surface alloys that multiple TPD peaks result from multiple phases at the surface [13] ."
[6] "The amount of H2 desorption in Fig. 3 a from ethylene decomposition on the (2×2) alloy is 5.4% of the H2 desorption yield from ethylene decomposition on Pt(111)."
[7] "The ethylene saturation coverage of 0.25 ML on Pt(111) at 100 K has now been determined unambiguously by nuclear reaction analysis [25] ."
[8] "For the (2×2) structure, three-fold Pt sites are present but no adjacent three-fold Pt sites are present."
[9] "The desorption temperature of the chemisorbed state shifts down as the Sn surface concentration goes up."
[10] "This is quite amazing behavior given that the surface contains either 25 or 33% Sn atoms and Sn is considered to be inert for chemisorption of alkenes."
