The small (C2C5) linear alkenes are all di-σ-bonded to Pt(111) at 100230 K 1 ,3 ,4 . Alkylidyne species are the stable products of dehydrogenation of these hydrocarbons on Pt(111) at room temperature as explored by various techniques, for example, LEED IV analysis [20] , static secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SSIMS) [21] , near edge X-ray adsorption fine structure (NEXAFS) [22] , and infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) [23] . Determining the coverage of ethylene chemisorbed on Pt(111) at 100 K and of ethylidyne in the (2×2) structure was the subject of some controversy. Estimates usually fell into two ranges [Ref. [24] and Refs therein], either 0.25 or 0.5 monolayers (ML). This issue has now been resolved by an absolute determination using nuclear isotope reactions [25] . Adsorption of C2H4 on Pt(111) at 100 K leads to a disordered C2H4 overlayer with 0.25 ML coverage. Heating the adlayer to 300 K results in desorption of 56% of the ethylene and leaves ethylidyne on the surface [24] . Adsorbing C2H4 at 300 K forms a saturation coverage of 0.25 ML ethylidyne in an ordered (2×2) structure. A direct observation of ethylene to ethylidyne conversion on Pt(111) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) [26] also gave results consistent with the coverage assignments of ethylene and ethylidyne.

Experimental techniques such as LEED IV analysis, SSIMS, NEXAFS, and IRAS verify the di-σ-bonding of small alkenes to Pt(111) at room temperature. They also confirm the formation of alkylidyne species through dehydrogenation of these hydrocarbons. The coverage of ethylene chemisorbed on Pt(111) at 100 K was controversial, but nuclear isotope reactions resolved this issue. Heating the adlayer of ethylene leads to its desorption and the formation of ethylidyne on the surface. A direct observation of ethylene to ethylidyne conversion using STM supports the coverage assignments of ethylene and ethylidyne.

实验技术，如LEED IV分析、SSIMS、NEXAFS和IRAS验证了小烯烃在室温下与Pt(111)的di-σ键合。它们还确认了通过脱氢这些烃类形成的烷基炔基物种。在100 K时，Pt(111)上乙烯化学吸附的覆盖率存在争议，但通过同位素反应解决了这个问题。加热乙烯吸附层导致其脱附并在表面形成乙基炔。使用STM直接观察乙烯转化为乙基炔也支持了乙烯和乙基炔的覆盖度分配。

Considering propylene and isobutylene as methyl-substituted ethylene reveals a small trend toward decreasing adsorption energy and on all of these surfaces as the amount of methyl substitution increases. The propylene adsorption energy decreases from 17.4 to 14.8 and then to 11.7 kcal mol1 as the substrate is changed from Pt(111) to the (2×2) and the alloys, as estimated by TPD peak temperatures. The isobutylene adsorption energy decreases from 17.1 to 14.7 and then to 10.8 kcal mol1 for the same series.

As methyl substitution increases in propylene and isobutylene, the adsorption energy shows a slight trend of decreasing on all surfaces. The propylene adsorption energy drops from 17.4 kcal/mol to 14.8 kcal/mol and then to 11.7 kcal/mol when the substrate moves from Pt(111) to the (2×2) surface and then to the alloy, as estimated by the TPD peak temperatures. Similarly, the isobutylene adsorption energy decreases from 17.1 kcal/mol to 14.7 kcal/mol and then to 10.8 kcal/mol in the same series.

随着甲基取代度的增加，在所有表面上丙烯和异丁烯的吸附能显示出轻微下降的趋势。当从Pt(111)到（2×2）表面再到合金时，丙烯的吸附能从17.4 kcal/mol降低到14.8 kcal/mol，然后降低到11.7 kcal/mol，根据TPD峰温度进行估算。同样地，异丁烯的吸附能从17.1 kcal/mol降低到14.7 kcal/mol，然后降低到10.8 kcal/mol。

Ethylene saturation coverage of 0.25 ML on Pt(111) at 100 K has now been determined unambiguously by nuclear reaction analysis [25] . It is of interest to determine the ethylene saturation coverage on the two alloy surfaces. This can be done by using our TPD data. The C2H4 TPD peak area from Pt(111) following C2H4 saturation coverage (0.25 ML) at 100 K is 0.135 ML (54% of 0.25 ML; 2% desorbs as ethane) [24] . By normalizing to this value, the C2H4 TPD peak areas from the (2×2) and surfaces correspond to the desorption of 0.26 and 0.27 ML C2H4. Since the amount of H2 desorption was also calibrated, that is, the H2 area from Pt(111) is due to 44% decomposition of the C2H4 monolayer at 100 K [24] , the ethylene saturation coverage on the (2×2) and surface was calculated as the sum of the reversibly and irreversibly adsorbed contributions to be 0.26 and 0.27 ML, respectively, at 100 K.

Normalizing to this value, the C2H4 TPD peak areas from the (2×2) and surfaces indicate the desorption of 0.26 and 0.27 ML C2H4. Given that the H2 desorption was also calibrated, meaning the H2 area from Pt(111) corresponds to 44% decomposition of the C2H4 monolayer at 100 K [24], the ethylene saturation coverage on the (2×2) and surface was calculated as the combined reversible and irreversible adsorption contributions, to be 0.26 and 0.27 ML, respectively, at 100 K.

在100 K时，通过核反应分析已经明确确定了Pt(111)上乙烯的饱和覆盖率是0.25 ML [25]。为了确定两种合金表面的乙烯饱和覆盖率，可以利用TPD数据。在100 K时，Pt(111)上0.25 ML饱和覆盖率后的C2H4 TPD峰值面积为0.135 ML（0.25 ML的54%，2%以乙烷形式脱附）[24]。通过归一化至这个值，从（2×2）和表面的C2H4 TPD峰值面积对应着脱附的0.26和0.27 ML C2H4。鉴于H2脱附也被校正，即Pt(111)上的H2面积对应于100 K时C2H4单层的44%分解[24]，因此在100 K时，（2×2）和表面的乙烯饱和覆盖率被计算为可逆和不可逆吸附贡献之和，分别为0.26和0.27 ML。
