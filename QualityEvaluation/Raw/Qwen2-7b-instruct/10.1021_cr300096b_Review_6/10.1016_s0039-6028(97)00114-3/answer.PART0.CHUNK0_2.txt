The experiments utilized an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber with specific pumping equipment and gases were sourced from Matheson and Aldrich. The sticking coefficient for propylene adsorption on Pt(111) at 100 K was comparable to that of cyclohexene adsorption on Pt(111) at 180 K. The sticking coefficient (SO) on the surfaces was independent of the Sn concentration. The fraction of the chemisorbed monolayer that dehydrogenates to liberate H2 was calculated in two methods. The reduced reactivity of the surfaces was explained in earlier papers and will not be repeated. The effect of Sn concentration was not linearly dependent on the surface Sn concentration.

实验使用了一个超高真空(UHV)室，配备了特定的抽气设备和气体来自Matheson和Aldrich。在100 K时，丙烯在Pt(111)上的粘附系数与180 K时环己烯在Pt(111)上的粘附系数相似。表面的粘附系数（SO）不受Sn浓度的影响。计算出化学吸附的单分子层中分解并释放H2的比例有两种方法。表面的减小反应性已经在早期的论文中解释过，并不会重复。Sn浓度对表面Sn浓度的影响不是线性的。
