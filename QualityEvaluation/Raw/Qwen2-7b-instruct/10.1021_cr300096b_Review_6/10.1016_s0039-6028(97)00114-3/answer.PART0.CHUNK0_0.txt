The small influence of Sn on the coverage of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene in the chemisorbed monolayer is due to only a small adsorption ensemble requirement for chemisorption of these molecules on Pt. It is clear that at most two to three Pt atoms are sufficient to form the di-σ-bonded adsorbates. This result lowers our previous estimate of four Pt atoms as the ethylene adsorption ensemble requirement, resulting from Bi adatom site-blocking experiments [34].

Answer: The adsorption ensemble requirement for chemisorption of ethylene, propylene, and isobutylene on Pt is at most two to three Pt atoms, as determined by Sn/Pt(111) alloy experiments. This finding reduces the previous estimate of four Pt atoms as the ethylene adsorption ensemble requirement.

吸附组分要求对于乙烯、丙烯和丁二烯在铂上的化学吸附为最多两个到三个铂原子，这是由Sn/Pt(111)合金实验得出的结果。这将之前对乙烷吸附组分要求的估计从四个铂原子降低到了两个到三个铂原子。
