<p>The addition of alloyed Sn in Pt surfaces weakens the bonding of hydrocarbons, such as alkenes and dienes, and this has been known for some time. The hydrogen coad- sorption experiments reported here greatly extend our un- derstanding of the influence of alloyed Sn on the chem- istry and catalysis that occurs on Pt surfaces by revealing how this weakened bonding alters the influence of coad- sorbed hydrogen on adsorption, desorption, and hydrogena- tion rates.</p>
<p>Blocking of strong adsorption sites by preadsorbed H adatoms on Pt(111) has been reported previously [28]. We also observed this H adatom site-blocking effect for 1,3-butadiene adsorption on H-precovered Pt(111) and have proposed why this could be a general phenomenon for other hydrocarbons [18].</p>
<p>Another significant difference in the chemistry of coad- sorbed hydrogen on Pt(111) compared with that on the two Sn/Pt(111) alloy surfaces is the reactivity for hydrogenat- ing 1,3-butadiene. On Pt(111), chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene is completely irreversibly adsorbed and completely de- composes to liberate H2 and form surface carbon [19].</p>
<p>Reaction rate-limited butene desorption peaks in TPD can be used to estimate the hydrogenation reaction barrier Ea for strongly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene on the two surface alloys (i.e., Ed = Ea). The single butene desorption peak at 354 K on the (2×2) alloy with θH = 0.16-ML H corresponds to a hydrogenation reaction barrier of Ea = 91 kJ/mol. On the
3 alloy with θH = 0.13-ML H, the two butene des- orption peaks at 282 and 348 K correspond to Ea = 72 and 90 kJ/mol, respectively.</p>
<p>Both Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys have 100% selectivity for the conversion of 1,3-butadiene to butene versus butane; bu- tane was never detected as a desorbed product in these ex- periments. This observation is promising for applications of SnPt bimetallic catalysts in the selective removal of dienes from alkene feeds.</p>
<p>Reactions on the two Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys at low θH can be summarized by the following scheme:(2 × 2) alloy C4H6(ad) C4H6(g)
283 K,
(1) 2H(ad) H2(g)
347 K,
(2) H(ad) + C4H6(ad) C4H7(ad)
354 K,
(3) H(ad) + C4H7(ad) C4H8(g)
354 K;
(4)</p>
<p>3 alloy 2H(ad) H2(g)
272 K,
(5) H(ad) + C4H6(ad) C4H7(ad)
282 K,
(6) H(ad) + C4H7(ad) C4H8(g)
282 K,
(7) C4H6(ad) C4H6(g)
285 K,
(8) 2C4H7(ad) C4H6(g) + C4H8(g)
348361 K.

<p>Although θC4H6 is larger on the
3 alloy than on the (2 × 2) alloy at the same value of θH, the 1,3-butadiene con- version to butene is smaller on the
3 alloy because the H2 desorption activation energy on the
3 alloy is a lit- tle smaller than that for 1,3-butadiene. This causes more of the coadsorbed H to recombine and desorb as H2. On the (2 × 2) alloy, recombinative H2 and 1,3-butadiene desorp- tion have similar activation energies, and this results in more extensive hydrogenation reactions. These arguments lead to the conclusion that hydrogenation reactions are maximized when 1,3-butadiene and recombinative H2 desorption have the same activation energies.</p>

1. The addition of alloyed Sn to Pt surfaces reduces the strength of hydrocarbon bonding, particularly for alkenes and dienes. This study extends our understanding of how this weakened bonding affects the chemistry and catalysis on Pt surfaces, specifically by showing how it modifies the influence of coadsorbed hydrogen on adsorption, desorption, and hydrogenation rates.

2. Preadsorbed hydrogen blocks strong adsorption sites on Pt(111) surfaces, a phenomenon previously reported. This study also demonstrates this effect on 1,3-butadiene adsorption on hydrogen-precovered Pt(111) surfaces, suggesting it is a general phenomenon for other hydrocarbons.

3. The reactivity for hydrogenating 1,3-butadiene differs between Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) alloy surfaces. On Pt(111), chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene is completely irreversibly adsorbed and decomposes to liberate H2 and form surface carbon.

4. The hydrogenation reaction barrier Ea for strongly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene on the two surface alloys can be estimated from the butene desorption peaks in TPD. The Ea on the (2×2) alloy is 91 kJ/mol, while on the 
3 alloy, it is 72 and 90 kJ/mol for the two peaks at 282 and 348 K, respectively.

5. The Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys exhibit 100% selectivity in converting 1,3-butadiene to butene versus butane, indicating no detection of butane as a desorbed product. This observation is promising for the application of SnPt bimetallic catalysts in removing dienes from alkene feeds.

6. The reactions on the two Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys at low θH can be summarized by specific schemes, detailing the steps involved in hydrogenation, desorption, and recombination processes.

1. 合金化的Sn添加到Pt表面上减弱了烃类分子，特别是烯烃和二烯的结合力，这已经为人们所知。这项研究扩展了我们对合金化的Sn如何影响Pt表面的化学反应和催化作用的理解，特别揭示了这种减弱的结合力如何改变共吸附氢对吸附、脱附和氢化速率的影响。

2. 预吸附的氢气阻塞了Pt(111)表面的强吸附位点，这一现象在之前已被报道。这项研究还显示了氢预覆盖Pt(111)表面时1,3-丁二烯吸附的阻塞效应，并提出了它可能是一般现象对于其他碳氢化合物的解释。

3. 在Pt(111)表面和Sn/Pt(111)合金表面之间，共吸附氢的氢化活性存在差异。在Pt(111)上，共吸附的1,3-丁二烯完全不可逆地吸附并完全分解，释放出H2并在表面形成碳。

4. 可以通过TD谱中丁二烯脱附峰估计两种表面合金中强烈化学吸附的1,3-丁二烯的氢化反应障碍（即Ed = Ea）。在（2×2）合金上，具有0.16ML H预覆盖的单个丁二烯脱附峰对应于氢化反应障碍91 kJ/mol。在具有0.13ML H预覆盖的 
3合金上，两个丁二烯脱附峰分别对应于72 kJ/mol和90 kJ/mol。

5. Sn/Pt(111)表面合金表现出将1,3-丁二烯完全转化为但烯而不是丁烷的100%选择性，表明没有检测到作为脱附产物的丁烷。这一观察结果对用SnPt双金属催化剂从烯烃流中选择性去除二烯的应用有前景。

6. 在低θH下，两种Sn/Pt(111)表面合金的反应可以总结为特定方案，详细描述了氢化、脱附和重组过程的步骤。
