These studies investigate the influence of alloyed Sn on the reaction barrier for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation and the impact of surface Sn concentration on hydrogenation activity using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and other techniques. Experiments were conducted on (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111) and (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys by depositing a monolayer of Sn onto the Pt(111) surface and annealing it at different temperatures. TPD experiments were performed with a heating rate of 3.6 K/s and at a surface temperature of 100 K. The purity of gases was checked during dosing. Conversion of 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed to increase almost linearly with increasing θH on both alloys, reaching 1.0 at θH = 0.47 ML on the (2×2) alloy. Hydrogenation on the (3×3)R30 alloy also competes with other surface processes during heating in TPD.

这些研究使用温度程序脱附（TPD）和其他技术，探讨了合金化Sn对1,3-丁二烯氢化反应壁垒的影响以及表面Sn浓度对氢化活性的影响。在(2×2)-Sn/Pt(111)和(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上进行了实验，通过在Pt(111)表面上沉积一层Sn并将其退火至不同温度来制备这些合金。以3.6 K/s的加热速率和100 K的表面温度执行了TPD实验。在给定气体纯度期间检查了气体纯度。观察到1,3-丁二烯转化为丁烯的转化率几乎线性增加，当θH为0.47 ML时达到1.0，这是在(2×2)合金上观察到的情况。在(3×3)R30合金上，加热过程中TPD也观察到了氢化过程与其他表面过程的竞争。
