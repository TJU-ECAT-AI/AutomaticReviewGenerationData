1. The two alloys studied were (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) and (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111), with 25 and 33% Sn alloyed in the surface layer, respectively. They were formed by vapor deposition of Sn onto a Pt(111) single crystal.

2. Experiments were conducted in a three-level ultra-high vacuum chamber.

3. The (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) and (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys were prepared by depositing one monolayer of Sn onto the Pt(111) crystal surface and annealing for 20 seconds at 1000 and 830 K, respectively.

4. For all thermodesorption (TPD) experiments, the heating rate was set at 3.6 K/s, and all exposures were carried out with the surface temperature at 100 K.

5. The desorption of molecular 1,3-butadiene from the clean and H-precovered (2 × 2) alloy surfaces is illustrated in Figure 1.

6. The bottom curve in the figure represents the hydrogen yield from 1,3-butadiene dehydrogenation and decomposition on the clean (2 × 2) alloy.

7. On the clean (2 × 2) alloy, no butene desorption occurred.

8. At a hydrogen precoverage of 0.23 ML, butene is produced and desorbs near 134 K with an activation energy of 34 kJ/mol, due to facile hydrogenation of weakly adsorbed, π-bonded species.

9. The influence of preadsorbed H on the desorption of molecular 1,3-butadiene from the (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy is depicted in Figure 4.

10. On the (2 × 2) alloy, the activation energies for recombinative H2 and 1,3-butadiene desorption are similar, leading to more extensive hydrogenation reactions.

1. 研究的两种合金为(2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111)和(3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)，其中表面层中分别含有25％和33％的Sn，通过蒸镀方法将Sn沉积在Pt(111)单晶表面上形成。

2. 实验在三层超高真空室中进行。

3. (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111)和(3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金是通过在Pt(111)晶片表面沉积一层Sn并随后在1000K和830K下退火20秒制备的。

4. 对于所有温度程序脱附（TPD）实验，加热速率设定为3.6 K/s，所有暴露均在表面温度为100 K时进行。

5. 图1展示了清洁(底曲线)和H预覆盖(2 × 2)合金表面的分子1,3-丁二烯脱附情况。

6. 图中的底曲线表示在清洁(2 × 2)合金上从1,3-丁二烯脱氢和分解产生的氢气量。

7. 在清洁(2 × 2)合金上，未发生丁二烯脱附。

8. 当氢预覆盖达到0.23 ML时，丁二烯在约134 K处产生并脱附，激活能为34 kJ/mol，由于弱吸附π键物种的容易氢化。

9. 图4展示了预覆盖氢对(3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金表面分子1,3-丁二烯脱附的影响。

10. 在(2 × 2)合金上，重组H2和1,3-丁二烯脱附的激活能相似，导致更广泛的氢化反应。
