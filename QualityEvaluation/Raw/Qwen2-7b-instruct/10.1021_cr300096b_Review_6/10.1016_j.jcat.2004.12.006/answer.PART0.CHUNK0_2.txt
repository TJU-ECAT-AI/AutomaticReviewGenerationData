[1] "Experiments were performed in a three-level UHV chamber as described earlier [20]."
[2] "The Pt(111) crystal (Atomer-ic; 10-mm diameter, 1.5 mm thick) was prepared by 1-keV Ar+ ion sputtering and oxygen exposures (5×107 Torr O2,at 900 K for 2 min) to give a clean spectrum with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and a sharp (1×1) pattern with low-energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[3] "We prepared the (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) and (

3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys by evaporating one monolayer of Sn onto the Pt(111) crystal surface and subsequently anneal- ing the sample for 20 s to 1000 and 830 K, respectively."
[4] "In the (2 × 2) alloy, pure Pt three-fold sites are present, but no adjacent pure Pt three-fold sites exist. All pure Pt three-fold sites are eliminated on the (

3)R30alloy, and only two-fold pure Pt sites are present."
[5] "We observed this H adatom site-blocking effect for 1,3-butadiene adsorption on H-precovered Pt(111) and have proposed why this could be a general phenomenon for other hydrocarbons [18]."
[6] "This chemistry is unaffected by coadsorbed hydrogen, and, specifically, no butene desorption occurs [18]."
[7] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hy- drogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selec- tively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."
[8] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the
3 alloy."
[9] "We also observed a small amount of facile, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene to butene, which desorbed in reaction rate-limited peaks below 200 K corresponding to a hydrogenation activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol."

1. Experiments were conducted in a three-level ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber as previously described [20].

2. The Pt(111) crystal, with dimensions of 10 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness, was prepared through 1 keV argon ion sputtering followed by oxygen exposure at 900 K for 2 minutes, resulting in a clean spectrum confirmed by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and a distinct (1×1) pattern from low-energy electron diffraction (LEED).

3. The (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) and (
3 ×
3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys were created by depositing a single monolayer of Sn onto the Pt(111) crystal surface and then annealing the samples at temperatures of 1000 and 830 K for 20 seconds, respectively.

4. In the (2 × 2) alloy, pure Pt three-fold sites are present, whereas no adjacent pure Pt three-fold sites exist. On the (
3×
3)R30alloy, all pure Pt three-fold sites are eliminated, leaving only two-fold pure Pt sites.

5. We noticed the site-blocking effect of H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption on H-precovered Pt(111) surfaces, proposing this could be a general phenomenon for other hydrocarbons [18].

6. The chemistry on Pt(111) surfaces is unaffected by coadsorbed hydrogen, specifically leading to no butene desorption [18].

7. Alloying Sn with Pt(111) introduces a new hydrogenation pathway compared to Pt(111) chemistry, enabling the selective production of butene during the heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD).

8. The highest conversion of 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, attributed to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy compared to the 
3 alloy.

9. A small amount of facile, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed, which occurred in reaction rate-limited peaks below 200 K, corresponding to a hydrogenation activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol.

1. 实验在三个水平的超高真空（UHV）室中进行，这是之前描述过的[20]。

2. 直径为10毫米、厚度为1.5毫米的Pt(111)晶片通过1 keV氩离子溅射和900 K下2分钟的氧气暴露制备而成，得到由Auger电子光谱（AES）确认的清洁光谱以及低能电子衍射（LEED）显示的清晰（1×1）模式。

3. 通过在Pt(111)晶片表面沉积一层单分子层的Sn并随后在1000 K和830 K分别加热20秒，制得了（2 × 2）Sn/Pt(111)和(
3 ×
3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金。

4. 在（2 × 2）合金中，纯Pt三折点位点存在，但没有相邻的纯Pt三折点位点。在(
3×
3)R30合金上，所有纯Pt三折点位点都被消除，只留下两折纯Pt位点。

5. 我们注意到H原子吸附在H预覆盖的Pt(111)表面上对1,3-丁二烯吸附的阻塞效应，并提出了这可能是其他碳氢化合物的一般现象[18]。

6. Pt(111)表面的化学性质不受共吸附的氢的影响，具体来说，没有发生丁二烯脱氢[18]。

7. 通过将Sn与Pt(111)合金化，与单纯的Pt(111)相比，引入了一个新的氢化途径，允许在温度程序脱附（TPD）过程中加热共吸附的氢和1,3-丁二烯，实现1,3-丁二烯的选择性转化为丁烯。

8. 在（2 × 2）合金中观察到最高的1,3-丁二烯转化为丁烯的转化率，这归因于（2 × 2）合金上H2和1,3-丁二烯的脱附激活能几乎匹配，而这种匹配在
3合金上并不明显。

9. 观察到少量易于在较低温度下氢化的弱结合、π键连接的1,3-丁二烯转化为丁烯，该过程发生在低于200 K的反应速率受限峰中，对应的氢化激活壁垒为46 kJ/mol。
