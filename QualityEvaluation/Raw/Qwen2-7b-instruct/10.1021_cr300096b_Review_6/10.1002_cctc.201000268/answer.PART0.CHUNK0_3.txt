The research aims to enhance the CoPt bimetallic catalyst's ability to hydrogenate carbon-carbon (CC) bonds at low temperatures. The catalysts were tested using both batch and flow reactor methods. The results indicate that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst has significantly greater CO hydrogenation activity compared to its monometallic counterparts. Additionally, acetaldehyde hydrogenates more slowly than acetone over the same catalyst. These findings align with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggesting that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface structure could be more effective for hydrogenation due to its weaker binding energy towards acetone and acetaldehyde. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the concentrations of reactants and products during hydrogenation in a batch reactor setup. Flow reactor studies were conducted at 308K, and DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna abinitio simulations package (VASP) to predict the hydrogenation activity of the CoPt catalysts.

研究旨在提高γ-Al2O3支持的CoPt双金属催化剂在低温下氢化碳-碳（CC）键的能力。通过批式和流体反应器方法进行了测试。结果表明，CoPt双金属催化剂的CO氢化活性显著高于其单金属催化剂。此外，在相同的催化剂上，乙醛酸的氢化速率比丙酮慢。这些发现与密度泛函理论（DFT）计算相吻合，暗示了Pt-Co-Pt(111)亚表面结构可能更适合作为氢化催化剂，因为它对丙酮和乙醛酸的吸附能较低。利用傅里叶变换红外光谱法（FTIR）监测了批式反应器中反应物和产物的浓度变化。在308K下进行了流体反应器研究，并使用了维也纳abinitio模拟包（VASP）进行DFT计算，以预测CoPt催化剂的氢化活性。
