[1] "In this study, we report on the hydrogenation activity of acetone and acetaldehyde over CoPt bimetallic catalysts. The results show that the CoPt catalyst exhibits significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[2] "The experimental results correlate well with binding energies from DFT calculations, which predict that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface bimetallic structure should be a better hydrogenation catalyst, as it binds acetone and acetaldehyde more weakly than on Pt(111) or Co(0001)."

The CoPt bimetallic catalyst shows higher CO hydrogenation activity compared to monometallic catalysts. This activity correlates with lower binding energies of acetone and acetaldehyde on the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface structure, indicating its superior hydrogenation capability.

CoPt双金属催化剂在CO氢化活性方面高于单金属催化剂。这种活性与乙酮和乙醛在Pt-Co-Pt(111)亚表面结构上的较弱吸附能相关，表明其具有优越的氢化能力。
