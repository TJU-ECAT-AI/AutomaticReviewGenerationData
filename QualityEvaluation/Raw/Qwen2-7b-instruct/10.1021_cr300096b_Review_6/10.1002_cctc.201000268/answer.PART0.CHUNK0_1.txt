The superior CO hydrogenation activity over the CoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as compared to the Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration identified in the theoretical calculation. That the Pt-terminated Pt-Co-Pt subsurface structure is preferred over Co-terminated Co-Pt-Pt in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen is consistent with previous DFT calculations19 and experimental verification.20 The weaker binding energy of the carbonyl compounds on Pt-Co-Pt should lead to higher hydrogenation activity, consistent with the flow and batch reactor studies, with γ-Al2O3 supported CoPt bimetallic catalysts showing higher hydrogenation rate than the monometallic Co and Pt catalysts.

Answer: The CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibits higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, as per the experimental results from batch and flow reactor studies. This is attributed to the weaker binding energies of acetone and acetaldehyde on the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface structure, as determined by DFT calculations. The theoretical prediction aligns with the experimental findings, suggesting that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration. This configuration leads to higher hydrogenation activity compared to Co-terminated Co-Pt-Pt structures.

CoPt双金属催化剂在CO氢化反应中的活性高于相应的单金属催化剂，这根据批式和流动反应器实验结果得到证实。这归因于在Pt-Co-Pt(111)亚表面结构上乙酮和乙醛的较弱结合能，这是通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算得出的。理论预测与实验发现相吻合，表明支持的双金属纳米颗粒结构应该是Pt终止的，类似于Pt-Co-Pt亚表面配置。这种配置导致与Co-终止的Co-Pt-Pt结构相比具有更高的氢化活性。
