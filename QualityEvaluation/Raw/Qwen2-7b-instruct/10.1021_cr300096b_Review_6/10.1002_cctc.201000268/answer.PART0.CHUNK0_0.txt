The CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibits significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the low temperature (between 308 and 343K) hydrogenation of carbonyl groups. The experimental results correlate well with binding energies from DFT calculations, which predict that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface bimetallic structure should be a better hydrogenation catalyst, as it binds acetone and acetaldehyde more weakly than on Pt(111) or Co(0001). The binding energy trend taken from DFT calculations predicted that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) bimetallic surface should show higher hydrogenation activity than either Pt(111) or Co(0001). The experimental results from batch and flow reactor studies confirm these predictions, showing that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst has higher activity in the hydrogenation of acetone and acetaldehyde compared to their monometallic counterparts. The DFT calculations reveal that the binding energies of acetone and acetaldehyde correlate well with their hydrogenation activities on the bimetallic and monometallic surfaces.

钴铂双金属催化剂在低温（介于308至343K之间）下氢化羰基团时表现出显著高于单一金属催化剂的CO氢化活性。实验结果与从DFT计算得出的结合能相吻合，预测了在Pt-Co-Pt(111)亚表面双金属结构中，作为氢化催化剂应该更好，因为它比Pt(111)或Co(0001)表面更弱地结合丙酮和乙醛。从DFT计算得出的结合能趋势预测，Pt-Co-Pt(111)双金属表面应具有更高的氢化活性，而不是Pt(111)或Co(0001)。批次和流动反应器研究的实验结果确认了这些预测，表明钴铂双金属催化剂在氢化丙酮和乙醛时相对于其单金属对应物具有更高的活性。DFT计算揭示了丙酮和乙醛在双金属和单金属表面上的氢化活性与其结合能成正相关。
