The CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibits significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the low temperature (between 308 and 343K) hydrogenation of carbonyl groups. The experimental results correlate well with binding energies from DFT calculations, which predict that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface bimetallic structure should be a better hydrogenation catalyst, as it binds acetone and acetaldehyde more weakly than on Pt(111) or Co(0001). The binding energy trend taken from DFT calculations predicted that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) bimetallic surface should show higher hydrogenation activity than either Pt(111) or Co(0001). The experimental results from batch and flow reactor studies confirm these predictions, showing that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst has higher activity in the hydrogenation of acetone and acetaldehyde compared to their monometallic counterparts. The DFT calculations reveal that the binding energies of acetone and acetaldehyde correlate well with their hydrogenation activities on the bimetallic and monometallic surfaces.

钴铂双金属催化剂在低温（介于308至343K之间）下氢化羰基团时表现出显著高于单一金属催化剂的CO氢化活性。实验结果与从DFT计算得出的结合能相吻合，预测了在Pt-Co-Pt(111)亚表面双金属结构中，作为氢化催化剂应该更好，因为它比Pt(111)或Co(0001)表面更弱地结合丙酮和乙醛。从DFT计算得出的结合能趋势预测，Pt-Co-Pt(111)双金属表面应具有更高的氢化活性，而不是Pt(111)或Co(0001)。批次和流动反应器研究的实验结果确认了这些预测，表明钴铂双金属催化剂在氢化丙酮和乙醛时相对于其单金属对应物具有更高的活性。DFT计算揭示了丙酮和乙醛在双金属和单金属表面上的氢化活性与其结合能成正相关。

The superior CO hydrogenation activity over the CoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as compared to the Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration identified in the theoretical calculation. That the Pt-terminated Pt-Co-Pt subsurface structure is preferred over Co-terminated Co-Pt-Pt in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen is consistent with previous DFT calculations19 and experimental verification.20 The weaker binding energy of the carbonyl compounds on Pt-Co-Pt should lead to higher hydrogenation activity, consistent with the flow and batch reactor studies, with γ-Al2O3 supported CoPt bimetallic catalysts showing higher hydrogenation rate than the monometallic Co and Pt catalysts.

Answer: The CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibits higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, as per the experimental results from batch and flow reactor studies. This is attributed to the weaker binding energies of acetone and acetaldehyde on the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface structure, as determined by DFT calculations. The theoretical prediction aligns with the experimental findings, suggesting that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration. This configuration leads to higher hydrogenation activity compared to Co-terminated Co-Pt-Pt structures.

CoPt双金属催化剂在CO氢化反应中的活性高于相应的单金属催化剂，这根据批式和流动反应器实验结果得到证实。这归因于在Pt-Co-Pt(111)亚表面结构上乙酮和乙醛的较弱结合能，这是通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算得出的。理论预测与实验发现相吻合，表明支持的双金属纳米颗粒结构应该是Pt终止的，类似于Pt-Co-Pt亚表面配置。这种配置导致与Co-终止的Co-Pt-Pt结构相比具有更高的氢化活性。

The CoPt bimetallic catalyst showed higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts in both batch and flow reactor studies. The rate of CO hydrogenation was quantified by fitting a first-order rate equation to the consumption of acetone. The batch reactor results for acetaldehyde hydrogenation showed that ethanol was the only hydrogenation product, with the CoPt bimetallic catalyst demonstrating higher activity than the monometallic catalysts. Flow reactor studies also confirmed the higher activity of the CoPt catalyst for acetone hydrogenation. DFT calculations revealed that the binding energies of acetone and acetaldehyde on the bimetallic surface correlated with their hydrogenation activity. The CoPt bimetallic catalyst was found to be effective for the hydrogenation of both acetone and acetaldehyde, with the hydrogenation rate being faster than that of the monometallic catalysts.

The research aims to enhance the CoPt bimetallic catalyst's ability to hydrogenate carbon-carbon (CC) bonds at low temperatures. The catalysts were tested using both batch and flow reactor methods. The results indicate that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst has significantly greater CO hydrogenation activity compared to its monometallic counterparts. Additionally, acetaldehyde hydrogenates more slowly than acetone over the same catalyst. These findings align with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggesting that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface structure could be more effective for hydrogenation due to its weaker binding energy towards acetone and acetaldehyde. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the concentrations of reactants and products during hydrogenation in a batch reactor setup. Flow reactor studies were conducted at 308K, and DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna abinitio simulations package (VASP) to predict the hydrogenation activity of the CoPt catalysts.
