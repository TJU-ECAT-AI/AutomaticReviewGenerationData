<p>The consumption of acetone and production of 2-propanol during the acetone hydrogenation at 308K (reaction conditions: H2/acetone=2:1).</p>
<p>The rate constant was also normalized to the CO uptake of each catalyst obtained from the CO chemisorption measurements, as listed in Table1.</p>
<p>As summarized in Table1, for the hydrogenation of both acetaldehyde and acetone the rate constants show the similar trend of CoPt>Pt>Co.</p>
<p>For comparison, the batch reactor results of acetaldehyde hydrogenation are shown in Figure2.</p>
<p>Similar to the batch reactor results, the only reaction product detected by online gas chromatography for the hydrogenation of acetone and acetaldehyde is 2-propanol and ethanol, respectively.</p>
<p>The binding energy correlated well to the d-band center (Figure4), with binding energies being the weakest on the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface structure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, acetone and acetaldehyde have been used as probe molecules to investigate the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group.</p>

The CoPt bimetallic catalyst showed higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts in both batch and flow reactor studies. The rate of CO hydrogenation was quantified by fitting a first-order rate equation to the consumption of acetone. The batch reactor results for acetaldehyde hydrogenation showed that ethanol was the only hydrogenation product, with the CoPt bimetallic catalyst demonstrating higher activity than the monometallic catalysts. Flow reactor studies also confirmed the higher activity of the CoPt catalyst for acetone hydrogenation. DFT calculations revealed that the binding energies of acetone and acetaldehyde on the bimetallic surface correlated with their hydrogenation activity. The CoPt bimetallic catalyst was found to be effective for the hydrogenation of both acetone and acetaldehyde, with the hydrogenation rate being faster than that of the monometallic catalysts.

在批式和流体反应器研究中，CoPt双金属催化剂表现出比相应的单金属催化剂更高的CO氢化活性。通过拟合一阶速率方程来量化CO氢化速率，以确定乙酮的消耗情况。对于乙醛氢化，批式反应器结果显示乙醇是唯一的氢化产物，CoPt双金属催化剂的活性高于单金属催化剂。流体反应器研究也证实了CoPt催化剂对乙酮氢化的高活性。第一性原理计算显示，乙酮和乙醛在双金属表面的结合能与其氢化活性相关。CoPt双金属催化剂被发现适用于乙酮和乙醛的氢化，其氢化速率比单金属催化剂快。
