[1] "For ethylene glycol, the peak at 227 K was consistent with multilayer desorption based on desorption from Pt(111). The peak at 257 K was attributed to monolayer desorption, with a high-temperature shoulder indicating the desorption of chemisorbed molecules."
[2] "H2 desorption occurred at 300 K following an ethylene glycol exposure of 0.05 L, shifting to slightly lower temperatures with increasing exposures."
[3] "CO desorption occurred at approximately 460 K, also in agreement with our own experiments after exposure to CO and with literature data for a desorption-limited process on Pt(111)."
[4] "From NiPtPt(111), H2 desorbed as a weak and broad peak centered at approximately 300 K, a slightly lower temperature compared to Pt(111)."
[5] "From NiPtPt(111), CO desorption occurred at 401 K, about 60 K lower than that from Pt(111)."
[6] "On the other hand, from NiPtPt(111), no ethanol desorption was observed."
[7] "On this surface, a relatively intense CH4 peak was also detected at 339 K, the same peak temperature as from Pt(111)."
[8] "The reforming activity, a, and decomposition activity, b, are calculated as follows using the H2 and CO yields from the TPD peak areas."
[9] "The NiPtPt(111) surface displays the highest reforming activity and total activity."
[10] "The reforming activity of the thick Ni/Pt(111) is also significantly higher compared to Pt(111)."
[11] "It is known that for Pt-3d metal bimetallic surfaces, substituting a 3d metal in the subsurface of Pt(111) tends to decrease the d-band center, resulting in weaker interaction with adsorbed species such as hydrogen and oxygen."
[12] "By the use of the trend between activity and d-band center established experimentally in Figure 5, Figure 7 displays an extrapolation of ethylene glycol reforming activity on different 3d-PtPt(111) bimetallic surfaces."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measurements showed that Ni atoms segregated to the top layer on Pt(111) surfaces, confirming the monolayer formation of NiPtPt(111). HREELS analysis provided insights into the kinetics and activation barriers associated with this segregation process, which were found to align with DFT predictions. The measured segregation rates and activation energies corroborated theoretical models, establishing a reliable method for assessing the stability and activity of these bimetallic surfaces under reforming conditions.

使用HREELS和AES等实验技术验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中，特别是Ni和Co原子的氧诱导表面偏聚。AES测量显示，Ni原子在Pt(111)表面上层化形成NiPtPt(111)，确认了单层结构的存在。HREELS分析提供了关于这一偏聚过程的动力学和活化能的信息，这些信息与DFT预测相符。测量到的偏聚速率和活化能量与理论模型一致，为评估这些双金属表面在重整条件下的稳定性和活性提供了一种可靠的方法。
