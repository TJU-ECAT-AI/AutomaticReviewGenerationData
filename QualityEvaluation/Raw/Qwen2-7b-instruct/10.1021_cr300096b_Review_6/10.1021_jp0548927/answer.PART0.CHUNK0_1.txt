1. The surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displays higher reforming activity than Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces.
2. There is a linear correlation between reforming activity and the d-band center of the surfaces, indicating increased activity as the d-band center approaches the Fermi level.
3. DFT modeling can predict the reforming activity of 3d-PtPt(111) bimetallic surfaces, suggesting that activity increases with the d-band center closer to the Fermi level.

1. 表面单层NiPtPt(111)的重整活性高于Pt(111)、子表面单层PtNiPt(111)和厚Ni/Pt(111)表面。
2. 形成活性与表面d带中心之间存在线性关系，表明d带中心接近费米能级时活性增加。
3. DFT模型可以预测3d-PtPt(111)双金属表面的重整活性，表明随着d带中心靠近费米能级，活性增加。
