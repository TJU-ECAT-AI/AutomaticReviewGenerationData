<p>The ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the experiments was a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 1 × 10-10 Torr), which was equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and TPD.</p>
<p>The Pt(111) surface was cleaned by repeated cycles of Ne+ sputtering at 600 K and annealing at 1100 K. Following the last sputter cycle, 1 L of O2 at 890 K was used to remove carbon left on the surface, followed by annealing at 1100 K for 5 min. This cleaning procedure was repeated until negligible C or O was detected by AES.</p>
<p>Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by physical vapor deposition (PVD) of Ni, as described earlier.22 The crystal was held at either 600 or 300 K during Ni deposition, depending on which surface was being prepared.</p>
<p>For ethylene glycol experiments, dosing was performed with the crystal several inches away facing the dosing tube. Ethanol experiments were performed with the crystal facing away from the dosing tube.</p>
<p>For ethylene glycol reactions, the desorption temperature of H2 was shifted to slightly lower temperatures with increasing exposures. CO desorption occurred at approximately 460 K.</p>
<p>On Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the desorption temperature of ethylene glycol decreased slightly, and the amount of chemisorbed molecules desorbed intact decreased significantly on NiPtPt(111) and on the thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces.</p>
<p>The desorption temperature of CO on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was about 60 K lower than that from Pt(111).</p>
<p>From NiPtPt(111), H2 desorbed at 367 K, and CO desorption occurred from three states, with the most intense peak at 459 K.</p>
<p>On thick Ni/Pt(111), H2 and CO desorbed at 363 and 425 K, respectively.</p>
<p>The reforming activity of ethylene glycol on Pt(111) is 0.034 ML, while the total activity is 0.034 ML.</p>
<p>The reforming activity of ethanol on Pt(111) is 0.027 ML, while the total activity is 0.027 ML.</p>
<p>The reforming activity of ethylene glycol is higher than that of ethanol.</p>
<p>A linear correlation between reforming activities of ethylene glycol and ethanol and the d-band center of these surfaces has been established.</p>
<p>DFT modeling results indicate that the presence of surface monolayer 3d metals on Pt(111) shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level, therefore increasing the interactions with adsorbates.</p>
<p>For Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces, substituting a 3d metal in the subsurface of Pt(111) tends to decrease the d-band center, resulting in weaker interaction with adsorbed species such as hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>More direct measurements, such as careful EXAFS (extended X-ray adsorption fine structure) studies under in situ reaction conditions, would reveal whether the diffusion of subsurface 3d metals occurs during reforming.</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displays the highest reforming activity, compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces.</li>
<li>A linear correlation between reforming activities of both ethylene glycol and ethanol and the d-band center of these surfaces has been established.</li>
<li>DFT modeling has been performed to predict the reforming activity of 3d-PtPt(111) bimetallic surfaces with other 3d metals as the surface monolayer. The modeling results predict that the activity should increase as the d-band center of the bimetallic surface moves closer to the Fermi level.</li>

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods measure the kinetics and activation barriers of the segregation processes, which are compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems.

[1] "For ethylene glycol, the peak at 227 K was consistent with multilayer desorption based on desorption from Pt(111). The peak at 257 K was attributed to monolayer desorption, with a high-temperature shoulder indicating the desorption of chemisorbed molecules."
[2] "H2 desorption occurred at 300 K following an ethylene glycol exposure of 0.05 L, shifting to slightly lower temperatures with increasing exposures."
[3] "CO desorption occurred at approximately 460 K, also in agreement with our own experiments after exposure to CO and with literature data for a desorption-limited process on Pt(111)."
[4] "From NiPtPt(111), H2 desorbed as a weak and broad peak centered at approximately 300 K, a slightly lower temperature compared to Pt(111)."
[5] "From NiPtPt(111), CO desorption occurred at 401 K, about 60 K lower than that from Pt(111)."
[6] "On the other hand, from NiPtPt(111), no ethanol desorption was observed."
[7] "On this surface, a relatively intense CH4 peak was also detected at 339 K, the same peak temperature as from Pt(111)."
[8] "The reforming activity, a, and decomposition activity, b, are calculated as follows using the H2 and CO yields from the TPD peak areas."
[9] "The NiPtPt(111) surface displays the highest reforming activity and total activity."
[10] "The reforming activity of the thick Ni/Pt(111) is also significantly higher compared to Pt(111)."
[11] "It is known that for Pt-3d metal bimetallic surfaces, substituting a 3d metal in the subsurface of Pt(111) tends to decrease the d-band center, resulting in weaker interaction with adsorbed species such as hydrogen and oxygen."
[12] "By the use of the trend between activity and d-band center established experimentally in Figure 5, Figure 7 displays an extrapolation of ethylene glycol reforming activity on different 3d-PtPt(111) bimetallic surfaces."
