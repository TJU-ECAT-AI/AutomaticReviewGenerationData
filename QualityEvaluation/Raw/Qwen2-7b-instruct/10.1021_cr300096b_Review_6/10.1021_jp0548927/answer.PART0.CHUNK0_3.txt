[1] "The surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displays the highest reforming activity, compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. Reactions involving CO bond scission are minimal on these surfaces."
[2] "A linear correlation between reforming activities of both ethylene glycol and ethanol and the d-band center of these surfaces has been established."
[3] "DFT modeling has been performed to predict the reforming activity of 3d-PtPt(111) bimetallic surfaces with other 3d metals as the surface monolayer. The modeling results predict that the activity should increase as the d-band center of the bimetallic surface moves closer to the Fermi level, which can be achieved by choosing 3d metals from the left side of the periodic table."

1. The NiPtPt(111) surface, with Ni in the top layer, exhibits the highest reforming activity among Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. CO bond scission reactions are scarce on these surfaces.
2. A linear relationship between the reforming activities of ethylene glycol and ethanol and the d-band center of the surfaces has been identified.
3. DFT modeling forecasts that the reforming activity of 3d-PtPt(111) bimetallic surfaces can be enhanced by selecting 3d metals from the left side of the periodic table, leading to a d-band center closer to the Fermi level, which boosts interactions with adsorbates.

1. NiPtPt(111)表面，其中Ni位于顶层，显示了与Pt(111)、亚表面单层PtNiPt(111)和厚Ni/Pt(111)表面相比，最高的重整活性。CO键断裂反应在这些表面上很少见。
2. 乙烯二醇和乙醇的重整活性与表面的d能带中心之间存在线性关系已经建立。
3. DFT模型预测，在选择周期表左侧的3d金属作为表面单层的情况下，可以增强3d-PtPt(111)双金属表面的重整活性，导致d能带中心更接近费米能级，从而增加吸附物的相互作用。
