<p>The ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the experiments was a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 1 × 10-10 Torr), which was equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and TPD.</p>
<p>The Pt(111) surface was cleaned by repeated cycles of Ne+ sputtering at 600 K and annealing at 1100 K. Following the last sputter cycle, 1 L of O2 at 890 K was used to remove carbon left on the surface, followed by annealing at 1100 K for 5 min. This cleaning procedure was repeated until negligible C or O was detected by AES.</p>
<p>Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by physical vapor deposition (PVD) of Ni, as described earlier.22 The crystal was held at either 600 or 300 K during Ni deposition, depending on which surface was being prepared.</p>
<p>For ethylene glycol experiments, dosing was performed with the crystal several inches away facing the dosing tube. Ethanol experiments were performed with the crystal facing away from the dosing tube.</p>
<p>For ethylene glycol reactions, the desorption temperature of H2 was shifted to slightly lower temperatures with increasing exposures. CO desorption occurred at approximately 460 K.</p>
<p>On Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the desorption temperature of ethylene glycol decreased slightly, and the amount of chemisorbed molecules desorbed intact decreased significantly on NiPtPt(111) and on the thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces.</p>
<p>The desorption temperature of CO on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was about 60 K lower than that from Pt(111).</p>
<p>From NiPtPt(111), H2 desorbed at 367 K, and CO desorption occurred from three states, with the most intense peak at 459 K.</p>
<p>On thick Ni/Pt(111), H2 and CO desorbed at 363 and 425 K, respectively.</p>
<p>The reforming activity of ethylene glycol on Pt(111) is 0.034 ML, while the total activity is 0.034 ML.</p>
<p>The reforming activity of ethanol on Pt(111) is 0.027 ML, while the total activity is 0.027 ML.</p>
<p>The reforming activity of ethylene glycol is higher than that of ethanol.</p>
<p>A linear correlation between reforming activities of ethylene glycol and ethanol and the d-band center of these surfaces has been established.</p>
<p>DFT modeling results indicate that the presence of surface monolayer 3d metals on Pt(111) shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level, therefore increasing the interactions with adsorbates.</p>
<p>For Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces, substituting a 3d metal in the subsurface of Pt(111) tends to decrease the d-band center, resulting in weaker interaction with adsorbed species such as hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>More direct measurements, such as careful EXAFS (extended X-ray adsorption fine structure) studies under in situ reaction conditions, would reveal whether the diffusion of subsurface 3d metals occurs during reforming.</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displays the highest reforming activity, compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces.</li>
<li>A linear correlation between reforming activities of both ethylene glycol and ethanol and the d-band center of these surfaces has been established.</li>
<li>DFT modeling has been performed to predict the reforming activity of 3d-PtPt(111) bimetallic surfaces with other 3d metals as the surface monolayer. The modeling results predict that the activity should increase as the d-band center of the bimetallic surface moves closer to the Fermi level.</li>
