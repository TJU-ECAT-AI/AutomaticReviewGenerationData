<p>Deposition of a monolayer of Ni on Pt(111) at 300 K, designated NiPtPt(111), displayed increased reforming activity compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111).</p>
<p>The reforming activity of ethylene glycol is higher than that of ethanol, in agreement with studies on Rh(111).</p>
<p>A linear correlation between reforming activities of both ethylene glycol and ethanol and the d-band center of these surfaces has been established.</p>
<p>Extrapolation of the correlation between activity and the surface d-band center of bimetallic systems may provide useful predictions for the selection and rational design of bimetallic catalysts for the reforming of oxygenates.</p>
<p>For Pt-3d metal bimetallic surfaces, substituting a 3d metal in the subsurface of Pt(111) tends to decrease the d-band center, resulting in weaker interaction with adsorbed species such as hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>The surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displays the highest reforming activity compared to either Pt(111), thick Ni/Pt(111), or subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) surfaces.</p>
<p>DFT modeling results indicate that the presence of surface monolayer 3d metals on Pt(111) shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level, therefore increasing the interactions with adsorbates.</p>
<p>More direct measurements, such as careful EXAFS (extended X-ray adsorption fine structure) studies under in situ reaction conditions, would reveal whether the diffusion of subsurface 3d metals occurs during reforming.</p>

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods measure the kinetics and activation barriers of the segregation processes, which are compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems. The measurements provide insights into the stability and reactivity of the segregated 3d atoms on the Pt surface under various conditions.

使用HREELS和AES等实验技术验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧气诱导的次表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分离。这些方法测量了分离过程的动力学和激活能障，并将其与Pt表面下3d原子在不同条件下的DFT预测进行比较。这些测量提供了关于在各种条件下分离的3d原子稳定性和活性的见解。
