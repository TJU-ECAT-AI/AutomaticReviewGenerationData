The study successfully compared the reforming reaction of ethanol on Ni/Pt and Ni/WC surfaces, revealing strong similarities in the reaction pathways. DFT calculations showed comparable binding energies for ethanol, ethoxy, and hydrogen on both surfaces, indicating similar initial decomposition pathways. TPD and HREELS experiments confirmed the occurrence of OH bond scission leading to ethoxy formation, which subsequently decomposes to produce CO and H2. The quantification of the gas-phase yields from the TPD results provided similar reaction pathways, with reforming being the dominant pathway on these surfaces. The study concluded that monolayer Ni/WC represents a promising Pt-free catalyst with enhanced reforming activity for oxygenates, suggesting potential synthesis and reactor evaluation of supported Ni/WC catalysts to verify its effectiveness.

研究成功地比较了Ni/Pt和Ni/WC表面上乙醇的重整反应，揭示了相似的反应途径。第一性原理计算显示了乙醇、乙氧基和氢在两种表面上的结合能相似，表明了类似的初始分解途径。透射电离谱(TPD)和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱(HREELS)实验证实了OH键断裂导致乙氧基形成，随后分解产生CO和H2。从TPD结果中对气相产物量化的分析提供了相似的反应途径，重整是这两种表面上的主要途径。研究得出结论，单层Ni/WC是一个有前景的不含铂的催化剂，具有增强的氧气化物重整活性，并且建议进行Ni/WC催化剂的合成和反应器评估以验证其有效性。
