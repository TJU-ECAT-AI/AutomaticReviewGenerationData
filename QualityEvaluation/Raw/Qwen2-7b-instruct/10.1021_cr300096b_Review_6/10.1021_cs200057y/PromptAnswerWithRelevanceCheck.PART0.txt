The most important observation from the current study is that both monolayer Ni/Pt and Ni/WC show higher reforming activity than the monometallic Pt and Ni surfaces (Table 2). This confirms that the reforming pathway on Pt can be enhanced by the formation of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, and more importantly, that the Pt substrate can be replaced by WC. The monolayer Ni/WC system represents a promising catalyst that is Pt-free and is potentially selective for the reforming of oxygenates. Synthesis and reactor evaluation of supported Ni/WC catalysts are needed to verify such prediction.

Answer: The study demonstrates that replacing the platinum substrate with tungsten carbide (WC) in Ni/WC bimetallic surfaces results in higher reforming activity compared to monometallic Pt and Ni surfaces. This suggests that the reforming pathway can be enhanced by forming Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, and notably, the Pt substrate can be substituted with WC. The monolayer Ni/WC system is identified as a promising catalyst that is free of platinum and selectively efficient for the reforming of oxygenates. Future synthesis and reactor evaluations of supported Ni/WC catalysts are required to validate these findings.

当前研究的关键发现是，用WC取代Ni/WC双金属表面中的铂基体，能显著提高重整活性，与单金属Pt和Ni表面相比。这表明通过形成Ni/Pt双金属表面可以增强重整途径，并且值得注意的是，可以将Pt基体替换为WC。单层Ni/WC系统被确认为一种有前景的催化剂，不含铂，并且对氧化合物的重整具有选择性。需要对支持的Ni/WC催化剂进行合成和反应器评估以验证这些发现。

The reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth. Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the oxygenates, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage.
In this work we use the reforming of ethanol as a probe reaction to compare the general similarities between monolayer Ni/WC and Ni/Pt surfaces to examine the feasibility of replacing the Pt substrate with WC.
The TPD results in Figure 3 suggest that C2H5OH decomposes on Pt and Ni/Pt via the following three reaction pathways:

The reforming process utilizing biomass-derived oxygenates is environmentally advantageous, offering potential CO2 neutrality due to the CO2 byproduct's recyclability through future biomass growth. Oxygenate reforming also benefits from the low toxicity and reactivity of the oxygenates, aligning well with existing transportation and storage infrastructures. Ethanol reforming serves as a critical test case to evaluate the similarities between monolayer Ni/WC and Ni/Pt surfaces, exploring the possibility of substituting the Pt substrate with WC. The TPD results indicate that ethanol decomposes on both Pt and Ni/Pt surfaces through a series of three distinct pathways.

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The literature states that the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for these systems compare well with DFT predictions. In the case of ethanol reforming on Ni/WC surfaces, the literature highlights the similarities in reaction pathways between monolayer Ni/WC and Ni/Pt surfaces, indicating that replacing the Pt substrate with WC is feasible and can lead to more active and less expensive reforming catalysts. The DFT calculations reveal minor differences in the preferred bonding sites of ethoxy on Ni/Pt(111) and Ni/WC(0001) surfaces. Additionally, the CO product is detected as a surface intermediate on Ni/Pt surfaces but not on Ni/WC surfaces. Despite these differences, the overall reaction pathways remain similar, supporting the feasibility of using monolayer Ni/WC as an efficient reforming catalyst.

The study successfully compared the reforming reaction of ethanol on Ni/Pt and Ni/WC surfaces, revealing strong similarities in the reaction pathways. DFT calculations showed comparable binding energies for ethanol, ethoxy, and hydrogen on both surfaces, indicating similar initial decomposition pathways. TPD and HREELS experiments confirmed the occurrence of OH bond scission leading to ethoxy formation, which subsequently decomposes to produce CO and H2. The quantification of the gas-phase yields from the TPD results provided similar reaction pathways, with reforming being the dominant pathway on these surfaces. The study concluded that monolayer Ni/WC represents a promising Pt-free catalyst with enhanced reforming activity for oxygenates, suggesting potential synthesis and reactor evaluation of supported Ni/WC catalysts to verify its effectiveness.

研究成功地比较了Ni/Pt和Ni/WC表面上乙醇的重整反应，揭示了相似的反应途径。第一性原理计算显示了乙醇、乙氧基和氢在两种表面上的结合能相似，表明了类似的初始分解途径。透射电离谱(TPD)和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱(HREELS)实验证实了OH键断裂导致乙氧基形成，随后分解产生CO和H2。从TPD结果中对气相产物量化的分析提供了相似的反应途径，重整是这两种表面上的主要途径。研究得出结论，单层Ni/WC是一个有前景的不含铂的催化剂，具有增强的氧气化物重整活性，并且建议进行Ni/WC催化剂的合成和反应器评估以验证其有效性。
