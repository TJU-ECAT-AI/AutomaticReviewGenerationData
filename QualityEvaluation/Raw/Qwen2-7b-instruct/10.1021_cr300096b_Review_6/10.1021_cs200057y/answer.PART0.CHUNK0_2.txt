The reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth. Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the oxygenates, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage.
In this work we use the reforming of ethanol as a probe reaction to compare the general similarities between monolayer Ni/WC and Ni/Pt surfaces to examine the feasibility of replacing the Pt substrate with WC.
The TPD results in Figure 3 suggest that C2H5OH decomposes on Pt and Ni/Pt via the following three reaction pathways:

The reforming process utilizing biomass-derived oxygenates is environmentally advantageous, offering potential CO2 neutrality due to the CO2 byproduct's recyclability through future biomass growth. Oxygenate reforming also benefits from the low toxicity and reactivity of the oxygenates, aligning well with existing transportation and storage infrastructures. Ethanol reforming serves as a critical test case to evaluate the similarities between monolayer Ni/WC and Ni/Pt surfaces, exploring the possibility of substituting the Pt substrate with WC. The TPD results indicate that ethanol decomposes on both Pt and Ni/Pt surfaces through a series of three distinct pathways.
