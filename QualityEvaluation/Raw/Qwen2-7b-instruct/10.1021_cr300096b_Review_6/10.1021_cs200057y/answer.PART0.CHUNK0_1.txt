The most important observation from the current study is that both monolayer Ni/Pt and Ni/WC show higher reforming activity than the monometallic Pt and Ni surfaces (Table 2). This confirms that the reforming pathway on Pt can be enhanced by the formation of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, and more importantly, that the Pt substrate can be replaced by WC. The monolayer Ni/WC system represents a promising catalyst that is Pt-free and is potentially selective for the reforming of oxygenates. Synthesis and reactor evaluation of supported Ni/WC catalysts are needed to verify such prediction.

Answer: The study demonstrates that replacing the platinum substrate with tungsten carbide (WC) in Ni/WC bimetallic surfaces results in higher reforming activity compared to monometallic Pt and Ni surfaces. This suggests that the reforming pathway can be enhanced by forming Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, and notably, the Pt substrate can be substituted with WC. The monolayer Ni/WC system is identified as a promising catalyst that is free of platinum and selectively efficient for the reforming of oxygenates. Future synthesis and reactor evaluations of supported Ni/WC catalysts are required to validate these findings.

当前研究的关键发现是，用WC取代Ni/WC双金属表面中的铂基体，能显著提高重整活性，与单金属Pt和Ni表面相比。这表明通过形成Ni/Pt双金属表面可以增强重整途径，并且值得注意的是，可以将Pt基体替换为WC。单层Ni/WC系统被确认为一种有前景的催化剂，不含铂，并且对氧化合物的重整具有选择性。需要对支持的Ni/WC催化剂进行合成和反应器评估以验证这些发现。
