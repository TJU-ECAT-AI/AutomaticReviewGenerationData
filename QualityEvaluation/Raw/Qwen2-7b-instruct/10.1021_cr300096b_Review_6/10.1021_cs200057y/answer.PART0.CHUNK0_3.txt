[1] "In this work we use the reforming of ethanol as a probe reaction to compare the general similarities between monolayer Ni/WC and Ni/Pt surfaces to examine the feasibility of replacing the Pt substrate with WC."
[2] "The DFT calculations reveal minor differences in the preferred bonding sites of ethoxy, with the fcc sites on Ni/Pt(111) and hcp sites on Ni/WC(0001)."
[3] "Another difference is that the CO product is detected as a surface intermediate on Ni/Pt (Figure 4) but not on Ni/WC (Figure 6)."
[4] "The most important observation from the current study is that both monolayer Ni/Pt and Ni/WC show higher reforming activity than the monometallic Pt and Ni surfaces (Table 2)."
[5] "General similarities are observed in the reaction pathways of ethanol on monolayer Ni/Pt and Ni/WC, demonstrating the feasibility to replace Pt with WC and to use monolayer Ni/WC as active and less expensive reforming catalysts."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The literature states that the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for these systems compare well with DFT predictions. In the case of ethanol reforming on Ni/WC surfaces, the literature highlights the similarities in reaction pathways between monolayer Ni/WC and Ni/Pt surfaces, indicating that replacing the Pt substrate with WC is feasible and can lead to more active and less expensive reforming catalysts. The DFT calculations reveal minor differences in the preferred bonding sites of ethoxy on Ni/Pt(111) and Ni/WC(0001) surfaces. Additionally, the CO product is detected as a surface intermediate on Ni/Pt surfaces but not on Ni/WC surfaces. Despite these differences, the overall reaction pathways remain similar, supporting the feasibility of using monolayer Ni/WC as an efficient reforming catalyst.

实验技术如HREELS和AES用于验证并量化由氧气引起的Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。文献表明，这些系统中测量的分层动力学和激活势垒与DFT预测相匹配。对于在Ni/WC表面上进行的乙醇重整，文献强调了Ni/WC和Ni/Pt表面上反应途径的一致性，表明用WC替换Pt是可行的，并且可以导致更活跃和成本更低的重整催化剂。DFT计算揭示了乙氧基在Ni/Pt(111)和Ni/WC(0001)表面上的轻微差异性结合位点。此外，在Ni/Pt表面上检测到CO产物作为表面中间体，但在Ni/WC表面上未检测到。尽管存在这些差异，整体反应途径仍然相似，支持使用单层Ni/WC作为高效重整催化剂的可能性。
