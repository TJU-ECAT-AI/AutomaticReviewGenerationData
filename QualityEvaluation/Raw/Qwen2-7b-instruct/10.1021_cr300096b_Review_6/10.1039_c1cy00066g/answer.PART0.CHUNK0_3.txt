2.1 DFT calculations of propanal binding energies
In previous studies the enhanced CC bond hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene has been correlated with the presence of weakly bonded cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.7 To determine whether such a correlation can be extended to CO bond hydrogenation, DFT calculations were performed in the current study and the results are summarized in Table 1. The value of the surface d-band center has been found to be a useful descriptor to correlate the binding strength of many adsorbates on the bimetallic surfaces.4 In general, the binding energies of propanal increase as the surface d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure. The binding energy of propanal on these surfaces follows the trend of PtNiPt(111) < Pt(111) < Ni(111) < NiPtPt(111), identical to that of alkenes on these surfaces.

The DFT calculations revealed that the binding energies of propanal on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces decrease as the surface d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level. Among the surfaces tested, propanal bound weakest on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure, following the order: PtNiPt(111) < Pt(111) < Ni(111) < NiPtPt(111). This trend is consistent with the behavior of alkenes on these surfaces.

2.2 TPD results
The DFT results in Table 1 predict that propanal should be more weakly bonded on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure than the corresponding monometallic surfaces, suggesting that PtNiPt(111) should be more active toward propanalhydrogenation. The prediction is confirmed experimentally in Fig. 1 by comparing the TPD results of propanal hydrogenation activity on polycrystalline Pt, NiPtPt, PtNiPt, and a thick Ni-modified Pt surface.

The DFT outcomes in Table 1 forecast that propanal binds more loosely on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure compared to the respective monometallic surfaces, implying that PtNiPt(111) should exhibit greater activity for propanal hydrogenation. This forecast is substantiated experimentally in Figure 1 through a comparison of the TPD results for propanal hydrogenation on polycrystalline Pt, NiPtPt, PtNiPt, and a thick Ni-modified Pt surface.

表1中的DFT结果预测，丙酮在PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构上比对应的单金属表面更松散地结合，这意味着PtNiPt(111)对丙酮氢化具有更高的活性。这一预测在图1中通过比较在多晶Pt、NiPtPt、PtNiPt以及厚Ni修饰Pt表面进行的丙酮氢化实验结果得到了证实。

2.3 Preparation and characterization of supported catalysts
The γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts were prepared by a slurry-based impregnation method. The Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) precursors were dissolved in an excess of deionized water (15 mL H2O per gram of the catalyst) and then impregnated into the γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, Product Number of 39812). The solution was sonicated for 1 h, then dried at 373 K for 24 h, and finally calcined at 563 K for 2 h to produce the 5.0 wt% Ni1.7 wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1.5 wt% Ni1.7 wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts, with a Ni:Pt metal atomic ratio of 10:1 and 3:1, respectively. The corresponding monometallic Ni and Pt catalysts were also prepared to serve as control samples.

2.4 Catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts
2.4.1 Batch reactor studies using FTIR
Powder catalyst samples of 25 mg were pressed onto a square tungsten mesh, which had a K-type thermocouple affixed via spot-welding to monitor the catalyst temperature. To remove water and other impurities the cell was evacuated to a pressure below 1 × 106 Torr at room temperature. The catalyst was then reduced at 723 K in 30 Torr H2 for 10 min followed by evacuation and a high temperature flash (723 K) to remove any surface species generated during the reduction. The reduction cycle was repeated three times before performing hydrogenation experiments. The gas-phase reactants and products were monitored by recording FTIR spectra every 30 s during the reaction. In order to obtain comparable reaction rates between samples with different metal loadings, the propanal hydrogenation over 5.0 wt% Ni1.7 wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3 was performed at 308 K with a hydrogen to propanal ratio of 2:1, while that over 1.5 wt% Ni1.7 wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3 was performed at 343 K with the hydrogen to propanal ratio of 4:1.
