[1] "The ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the TPD study was a two-level stainless steel system with a base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr, as described elsewhere."
[2] "The surface cleanliness was verified with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."
[3] "The ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber was equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for TPD experiments and for in situ verification of reagent purity."
[4] "The TPD of propanal hydrogenation was performed on a polycrystalline Pt foil."
[5] "To prepare the Ni-modified Pt foil, Ni was deposited onto the clean Pt foil at 300 K until the AES peak-to-peak ratio of Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) was approximately 1.7."
[6] "This surface is designated as NiPtPt. The surface monolayer Ni could then be driven into the subsurface region by flashing the NiPtPt surface to 723 K and holding for 30 s."
[7] "Additionally, a thick Ni surface was made by depositing 5 ML of Ni onto Pt foil at 300 K."
[8] "After the bimetallic surfaces were synthesized, hydrogen and propanal were dosed to the surfaces with an exposure of 1 L (1 L = 1 × 106 Torr s) and 5 L, respectively."
[9] "The TPD experiments were performed with a linear heating rate of 3 K s1."
[10] "Pulse CO chemisorption was performed using an Altamira Instruments AMI-200ip to measure the number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts."
[11] "Approximately 0.1 g of the catalyst was reduced by H2 at 723 K for 2 h and then cooled in He."
[12] "The gas-phase reactants and products were monitored by recording FTIR spectra every 30 s during the reaction."
[13] "The vapor phase hydrogenation of propanal was also carried out by flow reactor studies in a quartz glass reactor under atmospheric pressure at 308 K."
[14] "Prior to reaction, 0.10 g of the catalyst was reduced in a H2 (20 mL min1) and N2 (20 mL min1) mixture at 723 K for 1 h."
[15] "The products were analyzed by using an online GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID)."
[16] "The apparent activation barriers (Ea) for propanalhydrogenation were estimated by performing flow reactor studies over these catalysts at different temperatures between 308 and 418 K, with the conversion between 1% and 15%."
[17] "The amount of adsorbed CO per gram of the catalyst provides a quantitative description of the number of active sites, which is used to normalize the reaction rate constants derived from the batch reactor measurements."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems through the measurement of segregation kinetics and activation barriers. These techniques allow for the assessment of the dynamics and energetics involved in the movement of atoms across the surface, providing insights into the mechanism of surface segregation. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems, offering a means to validate theoretical models and understand the behavior of bimetallic surfaces under various conditions.
