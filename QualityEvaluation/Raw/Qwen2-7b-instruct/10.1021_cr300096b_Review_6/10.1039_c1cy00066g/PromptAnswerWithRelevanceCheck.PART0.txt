Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES measures the peak-to-peak ratio of Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) to determine the presence and quantity of Ni on the Pt surface. The ratio corresponds to about one monolayer (ML) of Ni residing on top of the Pt, estimated through standard substrate/overlayer calculations, assuming Ni grows on Pt in a layer-by-layer manner. When the NiPtPt surface is heated to 723 K and held for 30 seconds, the AES ratio decreases to 1.0, indicating most of the Ni is present in the subsurface region, creating the PtNiPt subsurface structure.

The activation barriers and kinetics of this surface segregation process can be compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions to validate the theoretical models and understand the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena.

Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. In the context of this literature, AES is mentioned as a method used to verify the surface cleanliness of the Pt foil. The AES peak-to-peak ratio of Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) is used to estimate the thickness of the Ni layer on the Pt foil. This ratio corresponds to about one monolayer (ML) of Ni residing on top of the Pt. Once the Ni layer is formed, it can be driven into the subsurface region through heating and holding at specific temperatures, changing the AES ratio to indicate the presence of most of the Ni in the subsurface region.

The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are not directly provided in this literature. However, the process of forming and driving Ni into the subsurface region suggests that activation barriers associated with this process might be involved. The AES method is a common technique used to study surface segregation and its kinetics, which can be compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions for the same systems to validate the experimental findings.

2.1 DFT calculations of propanal binding energies
In previous studies the enhanced CC bond hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene has been correlated with the presence of weakly bonded cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.7 To determine whether such a correlation can be extended to CO bond hydrogenation, DFT calculations were performed in the current study and the results are summarized in Table 1. The value of the surface d-band center has been found to be a useful descriptor to correlate the binding strength of many adsorbates on the bimetallic surfaces.4 In general, the binding energies of propanal increase as the surface d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure. The binding energy of propanal on these surfaces follows the trend of PtNiPt(111) < Pt(111) < Ni(111) < NiPtPt(111), identical to that of alkenes on these surfaces.

The DFT calculations revealed that the binding energies of propanal on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces decrease as the surface d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level. Among the surfaces tested, propanal bound weakest on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure, following the order: PtNiPt(111) < Pt(111) < Ni(111) < NiPtPt(111). This trend is consistent with the behavior of alkenes on these surfaces.

2.2 TPD results
The DFT results in Table 1 predict that propanal should be more weakly bonded on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure than the corresponding monometallic surfaces, suggesting that PtNiPt(111) should be more active toward propanalhydrogenation. The prediction is confirmed experimentally in Fig. 1 by comparing the TPD results of propanal hydrogenation activity on polycrystalline Pt, NiPtPt, PtNiPt, and a thick Ni-modified Pt surface.

The DFT outcomes in Table 1 forecast that propanal binds more loosely on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure compared to the respective monometallic surfaces, implying that PtNiPt(111) should exhibit greater activity for propanal hydrogenation. This forecast is substantiated experimentally in Figure 1 through a comparison of the TPD results for propanal hydrogenation on polycrystalline Pt, NiPtPt, PtNiPt, and a thick Ni-modified Pt surface.

2.4 Catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts
2.4.1 Batch reactor studies using FTIR
Powder catalyst samples of 25 mg were pressed onto a square tungsten mesh, which had a K-type thermocouple affixed via spot-welding to monitor the catalyst temperature. To remove water and other impurities the cell was evacuated to a pressure below 1 × 106 Torr at room temperature. The catalyst was then reduced at 723 K in 30 Torr H2 for 10 min followed by evacuation and a high temperature flash (723 K) to remove any surface species generated during the reduction. The reduction cycle was repeated three times before performing hydrogenation experiments. The gas-phase reactants and products were monitored by recording FTIR spectra every 30 s during the reaction. In order to obtain comparable reaction rates between samples with different metal loadings, the propanal hydrogenation over 5.0 wt% Ni1.7 wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3 was performed at 308 K with a hydrogen to propanal ratio of 2:1, while that over 1.5 wt% Ni1.7 wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3 was performed at 343 K with the hydrogen to propanal ratio of 4:1.

[4] "The TPD of propanal hydrogenation was performed on a polycrystalline Pt foil."
[5] "To prepare the Ni-modified Pt foil, Ni was deposited onto the clean Pt foil at 300 K until the AES peak-to-peak ratio of Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) was approximately 1.7."
[6] "This surface is designated as NiPtPt. The surface monolayer Ni could then be driven into the subsurface region by flashing the NiPtPt surface to 723 K and holding for 30 s."
[7] "Additionally, a thick Ni surface was made by depositing 5 ML of Ni onto Pt foil at 300 K."
[8] "After the bimetallic surfaces were synthesized, hydrogen and propanal were dosed to the surfaces with an exposure of 1 L (1 L = 1 × 106 Torr s) and 5 L, respectively."
[9] "The TPD experiments were performed with a linear heating rate of 3 K s1."
[10] "Pulse CO chemisorption was performed using an Altamira Instruments AMI-200ip to measure the number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts."
[11] "Approximately 0.1 g of the catalyst was reduced by H2 at 723 K for 2 h and then cooled in He."
[12] "The gas-phase reactants and products were monitored by recording FTIR spectra every 30 s during the reaction."
[13] "The vapor phase hydrogenation of propanal was also carried out by flow reactor studies in a quartz glass reactor under atmospheric pressure at 308 K."
[14] "Prior to reaction, 0.10 g of the catalyst was reduced in a H2 (20 mL min1) and N2 (20 mL min1) mixture at 723 K for 1 h."
[15] "The products were analyzed by using an online GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID)."
[16] "The apparent activation barriers (Ea) for propanalhydrogenation were estimated by performing flow reactor studies over these catalysts at different temperatures between 308 and 418 K, with the conversion between 1% and 15%."
[17] "The amount of adsorbed CO per gram of the catalyst provides a quantitative description of the number of active sites, which is used to normalize the reaction rate constants derived from the batch reactor measurements."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems through the measurement of segregation kinetics and activation barriers. These techniques allow for the assessment of the dynamics and energetics involved in the movement of atoms across the surface, providing insights into the mechanism of surface segregation. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems, offering a means to validate theoretical models and understand the behavior of bimetallic surfaces under various conditions.
