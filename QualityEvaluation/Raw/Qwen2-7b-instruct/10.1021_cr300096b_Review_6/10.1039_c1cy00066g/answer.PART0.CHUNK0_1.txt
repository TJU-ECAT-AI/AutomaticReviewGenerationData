[1] "For gas phase hydrogenation of propanal, batch reactor studies using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are employed to quantify the rate constants for hydrogenation, while flow reactor studies using gas chromatography (GC) are performed to obtain the steady-state conversion and activation barriers."
[2] "The ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the TPD study was a two-level stainless steel system with a base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr, as described elsewhere.7,26 The chamber was equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for TPD experiments and for in situ verification of reagent purity."
[3] "The Pt foil was first subjected to Ne+ sputtering at approximately 600 K. The surfaces were then exposed to oxygen at elevated temperatures (890 K) to remove any excess carbon followed by annealing at 1100 K. The surface cleanliness was verified with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."
[4] "After the bimetallic surfaces were synthesized, hydrogen and propanal were dosed to the surfaces with an exposure of 1 L (1 L = 1 × 106 Torr s) and 5 L, respectively."
[5] "The γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts were prepared by a slurry-based impregnation method. The Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) precursors were dissolved in an excess of deionized water (15 mL H2O per gram of the catalyst) and then impregnated into the γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, Product Number of 39812)."
[6] "The apparent activation barriers (Ea) for propanalhydrogenation were estimated by performing flow reactor studies over these catalysts at different temperatures between 308 and 418 K, with the conversion between 1% and 15%."

1. 批量反应器研究使用傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）来量化丙酮氢化过程中的速率常数，而流动反应器研究则使用气相色谱法（GC）确定稳态转化率和活化能垒。
2. 进行TPD研究的超高真空（UHV）室是一个两层不锈钢系统，基压为1×1010托。它配备有四极质谱仪（QMS）用于TPD实验和原位验证试剂纯度。
3. 准备用于TPD研究的Pt箔时，首先用Ne+离子在约600 K下对其进行溅射处理。然后，表面在890 K下暴露于氧气以去除过量碳，随后在1100 K下进行退火处理。表面清洁度通过原子发射光谱（AES）确认。
4. 在合成双金属表面的过程中，向表面添加了体积为1升和5升的氢气和丙酮。
5. 使用浸渍方法制备了γ-Al2O3支持催化剂。将Ni(NO3)2·6H2O和Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2前体溶解在过量去离子水中，然后浸渍到γ-Al2O3中。
6. 通过在308至418 K之间的不同温度下进行流动反应器研究来估算丙酮氢化的显热活化能垒（Ea），转化率范围从1%到15%。
