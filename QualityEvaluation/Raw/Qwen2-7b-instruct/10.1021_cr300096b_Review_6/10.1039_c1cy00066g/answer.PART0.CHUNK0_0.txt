[1] "The ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the TPD study was a two-level stainless steel system with a base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr, as described elsewhere."
[2] "The TPD of propanal hydrogenation was performed on a polycrystalline Pt foil. The Pt foil was spot welded to two tantalum posts used as electrical and thermal contacts for resistive heating and liquid nitrogen cooling."
[3] "To prepare the Ni-modified Pt foil, Ni was deposited onto the clean Pt foil at 300 K until the AES peak-to-peak ratio of Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) was approximately 1.7. This ratio corresponds to about one monolayer (ML) of Ni residing on top of the Pt as estimated by standard substrate/overlayer calculations,27 under the assumption that Ni grows on Pt in a layer-by-layer manner."
[4] "This surface is designated as NiPtPt. The surface monolayer Ni could then be driven into the subsurface region by flashing the NiPtPt surface to 723 K and holding for 30 s.27 This resulted in the Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES ratio decreasing to 1.0, representative of a Pt surface with most of the Ni present in the subsurface region. This structure is designated as the PtNiPt subsurface structure."
[5] "The ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the TPD study was a two-level stainless steel system with a base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr, as described elsewhere."
[6] "The chamber was equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for TPD experiments and for in situ verification of reagent purity."
[7] "To prepare a clean Pt surface, the Pt foil was first subjected to Ne+ sputtering at approximately 600 K."
[8] "The surfaces were then exposed to oxygen at elevated temperatures (890 K) to remove any excess carbon followed by annealing at 1100 K."
[9] "The surface cleanliness was verified with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."
[10] "After the bimetallic surfaces were synthesized, hydrogen and propanal were dosed to the surfaces with an exposure of 1 L (1 L = 1 × 106 Torr s) and 5 L, respectively."
[11] "The TPD experiments were performed with a linear heating rate of 3 K s1."
[12] "The γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts were prepared by a slurry-based impregnation method."
[13] "The Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) precursors were dissolved in an excess of deionized water (15 mL H2O per gram of the catalyst) and then impregnated into the γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, Product Number of 39812)."
[14] "Pulse CO chemisorption was performed using an Altamira Instruments AMI-200ip to measure the number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts."
[15] "Approximately 0.1 g of the catalyst was reduced by H2 at 723 K for 2 h and then cooled in He."
[16] "After cooling, pulses of CO in a He carrier (CO/He molar ratio = 1:1) were injected at 20 mL min1 at room temperature and the signal was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
[17] "FTIR was used to monitor the concentrations of individual reactants and products during hydrogenation reactions within a batch reactor system."
[18] "Powder catalyst samples of 25 mg were pressed onto a square tungsten mesh, which had a K-type thermocouple affixed via spot-welding to monitor the catalyst temperature."
[19] "To remove water and other impurities the cell was evacuated to a pressure below 106 Torr at room temperature."
[20] "The catalyst was then reduced at 723 K in 30 Torr H2 for 10 min followed by evacuation and a high temperature flash (723 K) to remove any surface species generated during the reduction."
[21] "The gas-phase reactants and products were monitored by recording FTIR spectra every 30 s during the reaction."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES measures the peak-to-peak ratio of Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) to determine the presence and quantity of Ni on the Pt surface. The ratio corresponds to about one monolayer (ML) of Ni residing on top of the Pt, estimated through standard substrate/overlayer calculations, assuming Ni grows on Pt in a layer-by-layer manner. When the NiPtPt surface is heated to 723 K and held for 30 seconds, the AES ratio decreases to 1.0, indicating most of the Ni is present in the subsurface region, creating the PtNiPt subsurface structure.

The activation barriers and kinetics of this surface segregation process can be compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions to validate the theoretical models and understand the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena.

使用HREELS和AES等实验技术验证并量化氧诱导在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的次表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）的表面分离。AES通过测量Ni（849 eV）/Pt（241 eV）的峰峰值比来确定Pt表面是否存在和量化的Ni。该比率对应于大约一层Ni位于Pt上的情况，根据标准基底/覆盖层计算进行估算，假设Ni在层间生长在Pt上。当NiPtPt表面加热至723 K并保持30秒时，AES比率降低到1.0，表明大多数Ni位于次表面区域，形成PtNiPt次表面结构。

可以将此表面分离过程的激活势垒和动力学与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测进行比较，以验证理论模型并理解观察到现象背后的机制。
