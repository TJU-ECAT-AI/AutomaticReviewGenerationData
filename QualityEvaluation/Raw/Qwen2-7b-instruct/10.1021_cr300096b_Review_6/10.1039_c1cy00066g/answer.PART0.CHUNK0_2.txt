[1] "The ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the TPD study was a two-level stainless steel system with a base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr, as described elsewhere.7,26 The chamber was equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for TPD experiments and for in situ verification of reagent purity."
[2] "The TPD of propanal hydrogenation was performed on a polycrystalline Pt foil. The Pt foil was spot welded to two tantalum posts used as electrical and thermal contacts for resistive heating and liquid nitrogen cooling. The Pt foil temperature was measured and controlled from 100 K to 1100 K via a K-type thermocouple."

[4] "To prepare the Ni-modified Pt foil, Ni was deposited onto the clean Pt foil at 300 K until the AES peak-to-peak ratio of Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) was approximately 1.7. This ratio corresponds to about one monolayer (ML) of Ni residing on top of the Pt as estimated by standard substrate/overlayer calculations,27 under the assumption that Ni grows on Pt in a layer-by-layer manner. This surface is designated as NiPtPt. The surface monolayer Ni could then be driven into the subsurface region by flashing the NiPtPt surface to 723 K and holding for 30 s.27 This resulted in the Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES ratio decreasing to 1.0, representative of a Pt surface with most of the Ni present in the subsurface region. This structure is designated as the PtNiPt subsurface structure."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. In the context of this literature, AES is mentioned as a method used to verify the surface cleanliness of the Pt foil. The AES peak-to-peak ratio of Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) is used to estimate the thickness of the Ni layer on the Pt foil. This ratio corresponds to about one monolayer (ML) of Ni residing on top of the Pt. Once the Ni layer is formed, it can be driven into the subsurface region through heating and holding at specific temperatures, changing the AES ratio to indicate the presence of most of the Ni in the subsurface region.

The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are not directly provided in this literature. However, the process of forming and driving Ni into the subsurface region suggests that activation barriers associated with this process might be involved. The AES method is a common technique used to study surface segregation and its kinetics, which can be compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions for the same systems to validate the experimental findings.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和AES（阿格尔电子能谱），验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导表面扩散的3d亚表面原子（特别是Ni和Co）。在本文献的背景下，AES被提及用于验证Pt箔的表面清洁度。Ni（849 eV）/Pt（241 eV）的AES峰峰比用于估算Pt箔上Ni层的厚度。该比例对应于约一层Ni驻留在Pt上方。一旦形成Ni层，通过加热并在特定温度下保持一段时间，可以将其驱动到亚表面区域，表明Ni大部分位于亚表面区域。AES方法是研究表面扩散及其动力学的常见技术，这可以与DFT（密度泛函理论）预测进行比较以验证实验结果。

此文献中未直接提供氧诱导表面扩散的3d亚表面原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的扩散动力学和激活壁垒测量。然而，形成和驱动Ni到亚表面区域的过程暗示可能涉及与这一过程相关的激活壁垒。AES方法是研究表面扩散及其动力学的常见技术，这些可以与相同的系统进行DFT预测进行比较以验证实验发现。
