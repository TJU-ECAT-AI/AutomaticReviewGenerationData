The ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+ radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively.
For the o-C6H4+cation the first excited state is 12A2 (assuming that 22B1 does not lie between 12B1 and 12A2) and it lies very close to the ground state. For the m-C6H4+cation the first excited state is 12A1 (assuming that 22A2 does not lie between 12A2 and 12A1) and it lies close to the ground state.
The ground-state geometries of the o-C6H4+ and p-C6H4+cations are quite different from the S0 geometries of the o-C6H4 and p-C6H4 molecules, respectively. The C2C6 distance value (the distance value between the two dehydrocarbons) and the C2C1C6 bond angle value in the ground-state geometry of the m-C6H4+cation are much smaller than the respective values in the S0 geometry of the m-C6H4 molecule, and the small C2C6 distance value of 1.419 Å indicates that there is a real chemical bond between the two dehydrocarbons in the ground state of the m-C6H4+cation.
The CASSCF wavefunction for the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation has a somewhat multiconfigurational character. In the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons. In the ground state of the m-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons either. In the ground state of the p-C6H4+cation very large spin populations are located on the dehydrocarbons.
Isotropic proton hfcc calculations were performed for the ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+cations and for the first excited states of the o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+cations at the UB3LYP(//CASPT2) level. The calculation results imply that the ground and first excited states of o-C6H4+ will have similar ESR spectrum patterns. The calculation results indicate that the ground and first excited states of m-C6H4+ will have completely different ESR spectrum patterns, and the ESR spectra can be used to support the ground-state assignment based on the energetic results.

The ground states of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively. The first excited states of o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+ are 12A2 and 12A1, respectively, and they are close to their respective ground states. The ground-state geometries of o-C6H4+ and p-C6H4+ are different from their parent molecules, indicating the presence of a chemical bond in m-C6H4+. The largest spin populations in the ground states of o- and m-benzyne radical cations are not on the dehydrocarbons, whereas in p-benzyne radical cation, the spin populations are very large on the dehydrocarbons. The isotropic proton hfcc calculations show that the ESR spectra for the ground and first excited states of o-C6H4+ will have similar patterns, while those of m-C6H4+ will have completely different patterns, aiding in the assignment of the ground state.

o-, m-, 和 p-benzyne 离子的基态分别被确定为 12B1、12A2 和 12B1u。o-C6H4+ 和 m-C6H4+ 的第一激发态分别为 12A2 和 12A1，它们接近各自的基态。o- 和 m-benzyne 离子的基态几何形状与它们的母分子不同，表明 m-C6H4+ 中存在化学键。o- 和 m-benzyne 离子的基态中最大的自旋分布不在脱氢碳原子上，而 p-benzyne 离子的基态中在脱氢碳原子上的自旋分布非常大。异核化氢耦合常数（hfcc）计算显示，o-C6H4+ 的基态和第一激发态的 ESR 图谱将有相似模式，而 m-C6H4+ 的基态和第一激发态的 ESR 图谱将有完全不同的模式，这有助于确定基态。
