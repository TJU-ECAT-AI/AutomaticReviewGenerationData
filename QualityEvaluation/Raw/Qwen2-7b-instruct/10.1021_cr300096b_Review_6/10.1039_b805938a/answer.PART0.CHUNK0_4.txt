The ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+ radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively.
For the o-C6H4+cation the first excited state is 12A2 (assuming that 22B1 does not lie between 12B1 and 12A2) and it lies very close to the ground state.
For the m-C6H4+cation the first excited state is 12A1 (assuming that 22A2 does not lie between 12A2 and 12A1) and it lies close to the ground state.
The ground-state geometries of the o-C6H4+ and p-C6H4+cations are quite different from the S0 geometries of the o-C6H4 and p-C6H4 molecules, respectively.
The C2C6 distance value (the distance value between the two dehydrocarbons) and the C2C1C6 bond angle value in the ground-state geometry of the m-C6H4+cation are much smaller than the respective values in the S0 geometry of the m-C6H4 molecule.
The CASSCF wavefunction for the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation has a somewhat multiconfigurational character.
In the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons.
In the ground state of the m-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons either.
In the ground state of the p-C6H4+cation very large spin populations are located on the dehydrocarbons.
Isotropic proton hfcc calculations were performed for the ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+cations and for the first excited states of the o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+cations at the UB3LYP(//CASPT2) level.
The calculation results imply that the ground and first excited states of o-C6H4+ will have similar ESR spectrum patterns.
The calculation results indicate that the ground and first excited states of m-C6H4+ will have completely different ESR spectrum patterns, and the ESR spectra can be used to support the ground-state assignment based on the energetic results.

The ground states of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations are determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively. The first excited states for o- and m-benzyne are close to their ground states. The ground-state geometries of o- and p-benzyne differ significantly from their parent molecules' ground states, while the m-benzyne's ground-state geometry has a shorter C2C6 bond compared to its parent molecule. The CASSCF wavefunctions for the ground states of o- and m-benzyne show some multiconfigurational character, and the largest spin populations are not on the dehydrocarbons. In contrast, the p-benzyne's ground-state wavefunction shows very large spin populations on the dehydrocarbons. The isotropic proton hfcc calculations predict similar ESR patterns for the ground and first excited states of o-benzyne, whereas they predict different patterns for m-benzyne, which can aid in identifying the ground state through ESR spectroscopy.

o-, m-, 和 p-苯基烯烃自由基离子的基态分别被确定为12B1、12A2和12B1u。o-和m-苯基烯烃的第一激发态接近其基态。o-和p-苯基烯烃的基态几何结构与它们的母分子的基态有很大不同，而m-苯基烯烃的基态几何结构的C2C6键长比其母分子短。o-和m-苯基烯烃的CASSCF波函数显示一定程度的多配置性，最大的自旋分布不在碳氢化合物上。相比之下，p-苯基烯烃的基态波函数在碳氢化合物上显示出非常大的自旋分布。等离子体hfcc计算预测o-苯基烯烃的基态和第一激发态具有相似的ESR模式，而预测m-苯基烯烃的基态和第一激发态具有完全不同的模式，这可以借助ESR光谱支持确定基态。
