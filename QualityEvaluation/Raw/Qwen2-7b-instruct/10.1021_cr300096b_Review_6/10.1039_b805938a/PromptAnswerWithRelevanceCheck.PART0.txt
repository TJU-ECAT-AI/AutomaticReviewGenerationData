The ground-state geometries of the o-C6H4+ and p-C6H4+cations are quite different from the S0 geometries of the o-C6H4 and p-C6H4 molecules, respectively. The C2C6 distance value (the distance value between the two dehydrocarbons) and the C2C1C6 bond angle value in the ground-state geometry of the m-C6H4+cation are much smaller than the respective values in the S0 geometry of the m-C6H4 molecule, and the small C2C6 distance value of 1.419 Å indicates that there is a real chemical bond between the two dehydrocarbons in the ground state of the m-C6H4+cation.
The CASSCF wavefunction for the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation has a somewhat multiconfigurational character. In the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons.

The first excited states for o- and m-benzyne are close to their ground states. The ground-state geometries of o- and p-benzyne differ significantly from their parent molecules' ground states, while the m-benzyne's ground-state geometry has a shorter C2C6 bond compared to its parent molecule. The CASSCF wavefunctions for the ground states of o- and m-benzyne show some multiconfigurational character, and the largest spin populations are not on the dehydrocarbons. In contrast, the p-benzyne's ground-state wavefunction shows very large spin populations on the dehydrocarbons. The isotropic proton hfcc calculations predict similar ESR patterns for the ground and first excited states of o-benzyne, whereas they predict different patterns for m-benzyne, which can aid in identifying the ground state through ESR spectroscopy.
