The ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+ radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively.
For the o-C6H4+cation the first excited state is 12A2 (assuming that 22B1 does not lie between 12B1 and 12A2) and it lies very close to the ground state.
For the m-C6H4+cation the first excited state is 12A1 (assuming that 22A2 does not lie between 12A2 and 12A1) and it lies close to the ground state.
The ground-state geometries of the o-C6H4+ and p-C6H4+cations are quite different from the S0 geometries of the o-C6H4 and p-C6H4 molecules, respectively.
The CASSCF wavefunction for the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation has a somewhat multiconfigurational character.
In the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons.
In the ground state of the m-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons either.
In the ground state of the p-C6H4+cation very large spin populations are located on the dehydrocarbons.
Isotropic proton hfcc calculations were performed for the ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+cations and for the first excited states of the o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+cations at the UB3LYP(//CASPT2) level.
The calculation results imply that the ground and first excited states of o-C6H4+ will have similar ESR spectrum patterns.
The calculation results indicate that the ground and first excited states of m-C6H4+ will have completely different ESR spectrum patterns, and the ESR spectra can be used to support the ground-state assignment based on the energetic results.

1. The ground states of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively. For the o-benzyne radical cation, the first excited state lies very close to the ground state, while for the m-benzyne radical cation, the first excited state also lies close to the ground state.

2. The ground-state geometries of the o-benzyne and p-benzyne radical cations differ significantly from the geometries of their parent molecules.

3. The ground-state wavefunction of the o-benzyne radical cation shows a somewhat multiconfigurational character. In contrast, the ground-state wavefunctions of the m- and p-benzyne radical cations feature unique configurations.

4. The largest spin populations in the ground states of the o- and m-benzyne radical cations are not localized on the dehydrocarbons. However, in the ground state of the p-benzyne radical cation, very large spin populations are located on the dehydrocarbons.

5. The isotropic proton hyperfine coupling constant (hfcc) calculations for the ground and first excited states of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations suggest that the ground and first excited states of o-benzyne will have similar ESR spectrum patterns, whereas the ground and first excited states of m-benzyne will have completely different patterns. This difference in ESR spectrum patterns can support the assignment of the ground state based on energetic results.

1. o-, m-和p-苯炔自由基离子的基态分别被确定为12B1、12A2和12B1u。对于o-苯炔自由基离子，第一激发态接近于基态，而对于m-苯炔自由基离子，第一激发态也接近于基态。

2. o-和p-苯炔自由基离子的基态几何结构与它们的母分子有很大差异。

3. o-苯炔自由基离子的基态波函数显示了一定的多配置特性。相比之下，m-和p-苯炔自由基离子的基态波函数具有独特的配置。

4. 在o-和m-苯炔自由基离子的基态中，最大的自旋分布不在双键碳原子上。然而，在p-苯炔自由基离子的基态中，非常大的自旋分布位于双键碳原子上。

5. 对于o-、m-和p-苯炔自由基离子的基态和第一激发态进行的异核质子偶极耦合常数（hfcc）计算表明，o-苯炔的基态和第一激发态将具有相似的电子顺磁共振（ESR）光谱模式，而m-苯炔的基态和第一激发态将具有完全不同的模式。这种ESR光谱模式的差异可以支持基于能级结果的基态分配。
