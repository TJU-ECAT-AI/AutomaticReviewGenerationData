1. The ground states of o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations were found to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u respectively. 
2. The first excited state of the o-C6H4+cation is assumed to be 12A2, closely related to its ground state.
3. Similarly, the first excited state of the m-C6H4+cation is assumed to be 12A1, also closely related to its ground state.

1. o-, m-和p-苯炔自由基阳离子的基态分别被确定为12B1、12A2和12B1u。
2. 假设不存在位于12B1和12A2之间的22B1，o-C6H4+cation的第一激发态被假设为12A2，与它的基态紧密相关。
3. 同样地，假设不存在位于12A2和12A1之间的22A2，m-C6H4+cation的第一激发态被假设为12A1，也与它的基态紧密相关。
