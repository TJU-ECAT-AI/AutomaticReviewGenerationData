The Pt foil was cleaned by sputtering with Ne+ at 600 K. The sur- face was then exposed to oxygen at 900 K to remove excess carbon,followed by annealing at 1050 K for 300 s. This procedure was re- peated until surface cleanliness was verified with AES.

The surface cleaning process involved cleaning the Pt foil by sputtering with Ne+ at 600 K, exposing it to oxygen at 900 K to remove excess carbon, and then annealing it at 1050 K for 300 seconds. This process was repeated until the surface cleanliness was confirmed using AES.

清洁过程包括使用Ne+在600 K下溅射Pt箔，然后在900 K下暴露于氧气以去除多余的碳，并在1050 K下退火300秒。这一过程重复进行直到表面清洁度通过AES得到验证。

The hydrogenation of cyclohexene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system. The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) sub- surface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface [9,14].

Previously, the hydrogenation of cyclohexene was used as a test reaction to understand the unique characteristics of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system. This reaction pathway is exclusive to the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure because of the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface ([9,14]).

以前，使用环己烯的氢化反应作为测试反应来确定Ni/Pt(1 1 1)双金属体系的独特性质。此反应途径仅存在于PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构中，因为该表面上的原子氢和环己烯的结合较弱([9,14])。

By heating the NiPtPt foil surface to 725 K, the Ni (849 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio decreased from 1.7 to 1.0 due to the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of the Pt substrate [19].

When the NiPtPt foil surface was heated to 725 K, the AES peak-to-peak ratio of Ni (849 eV) to Pt (241 eV) dropped from 1.7 to 1.0 due to the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface layer of the Pt substrate ([19]).

当将NiPtPt箔表面加热至725 K时，Ni（849 eV）与Pt（241 eV）的AES峰峰比从1.7降至1.0，这是由于Ni扩散进入Pt基体的亚表面区域所致([19])。

On a clean Pt foil, the primary reaction pathway is decomposition, as evidenced by a post-TPD C (275 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio of 0.76, which is indicative of a surface almost entirely covered with
carbon. There are also minor pathways leading to the formation of very small amounts of benzene and cyclohexane, as shown in Fig. 2 and quantified in Table 2.
