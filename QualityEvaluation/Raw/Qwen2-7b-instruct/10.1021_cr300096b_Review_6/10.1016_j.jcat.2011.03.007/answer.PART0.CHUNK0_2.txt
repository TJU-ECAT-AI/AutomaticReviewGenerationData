The current work utilizes the adsorption of hydrogen and the hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe reactions to bridge the materials gap between single crystal and polycrystalline Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces.
Previous studies on Ni-modified Pt(1 1 1) have identified the formation of a PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure that binds atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene more weakly, leading to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway not present on either of the parent metal surfaces.
In the current work, the PtNiPt subsurface structure is prepared by depositing Ni on a polycrystalline Pt foil substrate. The adsorption of hydrogen and hydrogenation of cyclohexene are investigated using surface science experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
The polycrystalline PtNiPt subsurface structure shows general similarities to PtNiPt(1 1 1) in the low-temperature hydrogenation pathway,demonstrating the validity of using single crystals to predict activity trends for more complex surfaces.

The experimental techniques, such as surface science experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, verify the presence of a weakly bound PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure on the polycrystalline Pt foil substrate. This structure binds atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene more weakly, leading to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that is not present on the parent metal surfaces. This validates the use of single crystals to predict the activity trends for more complex surfaces.

实验技术，如表面科学实验和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，验证了在多晶Pt箔基板上存在一个弱结合的PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构。这种结构原子氢和环己烯的吸附更弱，导致了一个低温氢化途径，这在母金属表面不存在。这证实了单晶用于预测更复杂表面活性趋势的有效性。
