How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

The current study utilized the adsorption of hydrogen and the hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe reactions to bridge the materials gap between single crystal and polycrystalline Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces.

It is well established that bimetallic catalysts often show enhanced catalytic properties when compared to those of the corresponding monometallic materials [15].

The Pt foil was cleaned by sputtering with Ne+ at 600 K. The surface was then exposed to oxygen at 900 K to remove excess carbon, followed by annealing at 1050 K for 300 s.

The Pt foil was characterized using glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) [16]. The two dominant peaks were (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) planes, with the latter being detected as (2 0 0) due to the XRD selection rule.

The hydrogen desorption peak at 302 K is attributed to desorption from the (1 1 1) facets of the Pt foil. The hydrogen desorption peak at 354 K is attributed both to Pt(1 0 0) facets, which are predicted by DFT to bind to atomic hydrogen more strongly than Pt(1 1 1) (Table 1), and to step edges and defect sites, which should also have stronger binding energy than Pt(1 1 1) due to the fact that they are under-coordinated.

Upon modification of the Pt foil by depositing one ML surface Ni at 300 K (NiPtPt foil), the desorption of hydrogen occurs as one very broad peak.

The most noticeable difference in the TPD spectrum is the disappearance of the 354 K peak, suggesting the disappearance of any NiPtPt(1 1 1) facets and all of the higher energy lattices, step edges, and defect sites responsible for the high temperature peak on unmodified Pt foil.

The amount of gas-phase cyclohexane is quantified by comparing the TPD peak area from the polycrystalline surface to that from single crystal PtNiPt(1 1 1), which was estimated to be 0.749 lmol/m2 based on the amount of cyclohexane molecules desorbing from the single crystal surface [14] and by assuming that the number of surface metal sites is 1.5 × 1015 atoms/cm2 on Pt(1 1 1).

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by observing changes in the spectra patterns before and after oxygen treatment. Oxygen can cause these atoms to segregate to the surface, altering the electronic properties and adsorption characteristics of the surface. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can then be compared with DFT predictions for these systems. For instance, the Pt foil might be cleaned using Ne+ sputtering at 600 K, followed by oxygen treatment at 900 K to remove carbon and annealing at 1050 K for 300 seconds. The foil's surface configuration can be characterized using GIXRD, revealing the presence of (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) planes. The TPD results can show broadening or disappearance of specific peaks, indicating changes in the surface composition and structure. AES measurements can further quantify the changes in surface elements before and after treatment, providing insights into the segregation process. The comparison between experimental data and DFT predictions helps validate the accuracy of theoretical models and enhances our understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the behavior of bimetallic systems.

实验技术如HREELS和AES可以通过观察氧处理前后光谱模式的变化来验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中表面亚层3d原子（例如Ni和Co）的氧诱导表面聚集体。氧可以导致这些原子聚集到表面，改变表面的电子性质和吸附特性。可以测量聚集体的速率和活化势垒并与这些系统的DFT预测进行比较。例如，可以使用Ne+溅射在600 K下清洁箔片，然后在900 K下进行氧气处理以去除碳，并在1050 K下进行300秒的退火。通过GIXRD可以揭示(1 1 1)和(1 0 0)平面的存在。TPD结果可以显示特定峰的变宽或消失，指示表面组成和结构的变化。AES测量还可以在处理前后量化表面元素的量，提供关于聚集体过程的见解。将实验数据与DFT预测进行比较有助于验证理论模型的准确性，并增强我们对控制双金属系统行为的内在机制的理解。

The current work utilizes the adsorption of hydrogen and the hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe reactions to bridge the materials gap between single crystal and polycrystalline Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces.
Previous studies on Ni-modified Pt(1 1 1) have identified the formation of a PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure that binds atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene more weakly, leading to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway not present on either of the parent metal surfaces.
In the current work, the PtNiPt subsurface structure is prepared by depositing Ni on a polycrystalline Pt foil substrate. The adsorption of hydrogen and hydrogenation of cyclohexene are investigated using surface science experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
The polycrystalline PtNiPt subsurface structure shows general similarities to PtNiPt(1 1 1) in the low-temperature hydrogenation pathway,demonstrating the validity of using single crystals to predict activity trends for more complex surfaces.
