<p>The most significant finding of this investigation is that the reaction pathway that is so prominent on Pt(111) between coadsorbed H adatoms and ethylene resulting in the evolution of gas-phase ethane upon heating is totally blocked on the 3 alloy.</p>
<p>In cases such as this where no appreciable barrier to adsorption is expected to exist, the desorption activation energy is equal to the adsorption energy and one sees that hydrogen weakens slightly (10%) the bonding interaction of coadsorbed ethylene to the alloy surface.</p>
<p>Our results show that only 0.35 ML of preadsorbed H, which occupies one-half the available Pt sites, will totally block the adsorption of ethylene. This indicates that two Pt atoms are required for ethylene adsorption.</p>
<p>Hydrogen coadsorption weakens the interaction between ethylene and the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy surface. One effect is to cause a decrease in the adsorption energy of coadsorbed di-σ-bonded ethylene, but this perturbation is rather small. The most significant, and unexpected, effect of hydrogen coadsorption is to cause a nearly 1:1 site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption.</p>

The research article discusses the influence of surface-bound hydrogen adatoms on the adsorption, desorption, and reaction of ethylene on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. The key findings are that hydrogen coadsorption weakens the interaction between ethylene and the alloy surface, leading to a decrease in the adsorption energy of ethylene. More significantly, hydrogen causes a substantial site-blocking effect on ethylene chemisorption, requiring only 0.35 ML of hydrogen to eliminate ethylene adsorption sites. This indicates that two Pt atoms are needed for ethylene adsorption. The reaction pathway involving ethylene and hydrogen on the Pt(111) surface is completely inhibited on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy, suggesting that hydrogenation of ethylene does not occur under the conditions tested.

本文研究了表面吸附氢原子对乙烯在(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上吸附、脱附和反应的影响。主要发现是，氢共吸附减弱了乙烯与合金表面的相互作用，导致了共吸附乙烯吸附能的下降。更重要的是，氢引起了乙烯化学吸附位点的显著阻塞效应，仅需0.35 ML的氢就能消除乙烯吸附位点。这表明两个铂原子对于乙烯吸附是必需的。在(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金上，Pt(111)表面上存在的以氢为特征的乙烷氢化路径完全被抑制，这意味着在测试条件下，乙烯的氢化并未发生。
