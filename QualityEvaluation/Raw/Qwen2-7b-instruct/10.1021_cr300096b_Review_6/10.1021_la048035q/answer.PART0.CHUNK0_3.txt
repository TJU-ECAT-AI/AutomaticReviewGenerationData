The study found that hydrogen adatoms on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy significantly impact the adsorption, desorption, and reaction of ethylene. Specifically, preadsorbed hydrogen reduces the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene and requires less hydrogen to block ethylene chemisorption on this alloy compared to pure Pt(111). This is the first report of extensive hydrogen site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption on Pt(111). Moreover, hydrogen adatoms lower the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface. The reaction pathway involving hydrogen addition and leading to ethane formation, which is prominent on Pt(111), is completely inhibited on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy. This indicates a stark difference in the reaction chemistry of ethylene on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy versus pure Pt(111).

研究发现，(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的氢原子对乙烯的吸附、脱附和反应有显著影响。具体来说，预吸附的氢降低了化学吸附在该合金上的乙烷饱和覆盖率，并且在该合金上所需的氢量少于纯Pt(111)。这是首次报告氢在Pt(111)上的广泛化学吸附位点阻塞。此外，预吸附的氢降低了乙烷在合金表面的脱附活化能。在Pt(111)上，涉及氢添加并导致乙烷形成的反应路径完全被抑制在Sn/Pt(111)合金上。这表明乙烷在Sn/Pt(111)合金与纯Pt(111)上的反应化学存在显著差异。
