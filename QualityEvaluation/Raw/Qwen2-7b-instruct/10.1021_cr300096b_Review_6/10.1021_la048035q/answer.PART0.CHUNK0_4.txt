<p>The most significant finding of this investigation is that the reaction pathway that is so prominent on Pt(111) between coadsorbed H adatoms and ethylene resulting in the evolution of gas-phase ethane upon heating is totally blocked on the 3 alloy.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 3 for small precoverages of H adatoms, subsequent ethylene exposures produced ethylene desorption in TPD in a peak at 170 K, which is 10 K lower than that from a clean 3 alloy. With increasing θH, ethylene desorption shifted to lower temperatures, and eventually ethylene desorbed in a peak at 162 K for θH  0.19 ML.</p>
<p>For θH = 0.30 ML, the ethylene saturation coverage is reduced to only 18% of that on the clean 3 alloy. Extrapolation of the line given in Figure 4 indicates that the chemisorption of di-σ-bonded ethylene will be completely blocked when 0.35 ML of H adatoms is preadsorbed on the 3 alloy surface.</p>
<p>On the 3 alloy, preadsorbed θH = 0.30 ML blocked 82% of ethylene adsorption sites while twice as much hydrogen, θH = 0.60 ML, only blocked 70% of the ethylene adsorption sites on Pt(111).</p>
<p>This means that ethylene cannot chemisorb on Sn sites or on many of the remaining Pt sites on the 3 alloy. On the 3 alloy, Sn only occupies 33% of the surface area and 67% is still available as Pt sites.</p>
<p>Our results show that only 0.35 ML of preadsorbed H, which occupies one-half the available Pt sites, will totally block the adsorption of ethylene. This indicates that two Pt atoms are required for ethylene adsorption.</p>
<p>Another major finding of this work is the large difference in hydrogenation activity in these experiments between the Pt(111) surface and the 3 alloy. Coadsorption of H adatoms and ethylene on Pt(111) forms mostly ethane upon heating. This reaction pathway is totally blocked on the 3 alloy.</p>
<p>Our findings imply that π-bonded ethylene is not particularly reactive and ethylene simply desorbs at a temperature that is lower than that required for hydrogenation.</p>
<p>These observations represent important information for advancing the surface science of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis and aid in explaining the decreased activity for alkene hydrogenation observed in supported bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts.</p>

The research investigates the effect of surface-bound hydrogen adatoms on the adsorption, desorption, and reaction of ethylene on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. The key findings include:

1. The presence of hydrogen decreases the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene on the alloy surface.
2. A lower amount of hydrogen is required to block ethylene chemisorption on the alloy compared to Pt(111).
3. Hydrogen reduces the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface.
4. Ethylene hydrogenation is inhibited on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy, unlike on Pt(111), indicating a different reaction chemistry.
5. The study provides insights into the surface science of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis, supporting the understanding of decreased activity in bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts.

The results contribute to the development of models and explanations for the decreased activity in alkene hydrogenation processes observed in supported bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts.

研究探讨了表面吸附氢原子对乙烯在（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上吸附、脱附和反应的影响。主要发现包括：

1. 氢的存在降低了合金表面化学吸附乙烯的饱和覆盖率。
2. 在合金上的氢所需量比在Pt(111)表面上要少，以完全阻止乙烯的化学吸附。
3. 氢降低了乙烯在合金表面的脱附活化能。
4. 在Sn/Pt(111)合金上，乙烯氢化被抑制，与在Pt(111)上不同，表明了不同的反应化学性质。
5. 研究为氢化和脱氢催化表面科学提供了信息，并有助于理解支持型双金属Pt/Sn催化剂中活性降低的现象。

这些结果对模型开发和理解烷烃氢化过程活性降低的解释提供了支持，尤其是在支持型双金属Pt/Sn催化剂中。
