<p>The most significant finding of this investigation is that the reaction pathway that is so prominent on Pt(111) between coadsorbed H adatoms and ethylene resulting in the evolution of gas-phase ethane upon heating is totally blocked on the 3 alloy.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 3 for small precoverages of H adatoms, subsequent ethylene exposures produced ethylene desorption in TPD in a peak at 170 K, which is 10 K lower than that from a clean 3 alloy. With increasing θH, ethylene desorption shifted to lower temperatures, and eventually ethylene desorbed in a peak at 162 K for θH  0.19 ML.</p>
<p>The saturation coverage of ethylene on the clean 3 alloy was set to 1.0 on the left axis, and this corresponds to an actual coverage of 0.27 ML.21 The actual ethylene coverages are provided on the right-hand axis. Ethylene coverage was decreased linearly with increasing amounts of preadsorbed H adatoms. For θH = 0.30 ML, the ethylene saturation coverage is reduced to only 18% of that on the clean 3 alloy.</p>
<p>These data suggest that H adatoms effectively block ethylene access to Pt sites on both Pt(111) and the 3 alloy. Such site blocking effects of preadsorbed H have also been observed for benzene 28 and 1,3-butadiene 29 chemisorption on Pt(111).</p>
<p>On the 3 alloy, preadsorbed θH = 0.30 ML blocked 82% of ethylene adsorption sites while twice as much hydrogen, θH = 0.60 ML, only blocked 70% of the ethylene adsorption sites on Pt(111).</p>
<p>The other major finding of this work is the large difference in hydrogenation activity in these experiments between the Pt(111) surface and the 3 alloy. Coadsorption of H adatoms and ethylene on Pt(111) forms mostly ethane upon heating.3,13 This reaction pathway is totally blocked on the 3 alloy.</p>

The research highlights that hydrogen coadsorption significantly affects ethylene adsorption and reaction on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Specifically, it leads to:

1. Decreased saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene. With increasing hydrogen precoverage, the amount of ethylene that can chemisorb onto the alloy surface decreases linearly, reaching only 18% of its saturation coverage at 0.30 ML of hydrogen preadsorption.

2. Site-blocking effect. Hydrogen adatoms effectively prevent ethylene from accessing and chemisorbing onto the surface sites, both on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy and on Pt(111). This site-blocking effect is more pronounced on the alloy surface, requiring less hydrogen to block ethylene adsorption sites.

3. Different hydrogenation activity. The pathway for hydrogenation involving ethylene and hydrogen coadsorption on Pt(111) results in the formation of ethane. This process is completely inhibited on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, indicating a dramatic difference in hydrogenation activity between the two surfaces.

In conclusion, hydrogen coadsorption has significant impacts on ethylene chemistry on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, including decreased ethylene saturation coverage and a site-blocking effect that prevents ethylene from chemisorbing onto the surface, leading to a distinct difference in hydrogenation activity compared to Pt(111).

研究强调了氢共吸附在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金（3×3）R30结构上对乙烯吸附和反应的影响。具体表现为：

1. 降低化学吸附饱和度。随着氢预覆盖量的增加，吸附到合金表面的乙烯量线性减少，达到0.30 ML氢预吸附时仅占其饱和覆盖度的18%。

2. 站点阻塞效应。氢原子有效地阻止了乙烯访问并化学吸附到合金表面和Pt(111)表面的站点，合金表面上的这种站点阻塞效应更为显著，需要较少的氢来阻塞乙烯吸附站点。

3. 不同的氢化活性。在Pt(111)表面上，乙烯和氢共吸附导致形成乙烷的过程。而在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上，这一过程完全被抑制，表明合金表面与Pt(111)表面在氢化活性方面存在明显差异。

综上所述，氢共吸附在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上对乙烯化学产生了重大影响，包括降低乙烯化学吸附饱和度和产生站点阻塞效应，阻止乙烯吸附到表面，导致与Pt(111)表面相比，显著不同的氢化活性。
