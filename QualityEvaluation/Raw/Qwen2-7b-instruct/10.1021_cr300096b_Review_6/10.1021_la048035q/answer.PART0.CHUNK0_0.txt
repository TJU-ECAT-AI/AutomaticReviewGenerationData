The research focuses on the impact of hydrogen adatoms on ethylene adsorption, desorption, and reaction on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Preadsorbed hydrogen reduces the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene and requires less hydrogen to block ethylene chemisorption compared to Pt(111). It decreases the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface. The reaction chemistry of ethylene on this alloy differs significantly from that on Pt(111), with the hydrogenation pathway involving ethylene and hydrogen being completely inhibited. Coadsorbed hydrogen slightly weakens the adsorption energy of ethylene but leads to a linear decrease in the chemisorbed monolayer saturation coverage due to site-blocking effects, eliminating ethylene chemisorption at a specific hydrogen coverage. These findings contribute to our understanding of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis, particularly in relation to the reduced activity of alkene hydrogenation in bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts.

研究集中在氢原子对乙烯在（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附、脱附和反应的影响。预吸附的氢减少了化学吸附的乙烯饱和覆盖率，并且比Pt(111)需要更少的氢来完全阻止乙烯的化学吸附。它降低了合金表面上乙烯的脱附活化能。乙烯在该合金上的反应化学与在Pt(111)上显著不同，涉及乙烯和氢的氢化路径在合金上被完全抑制。预吸附的氢轻微削弱了乙烯的吸附能量，但由于位点阻塞效应导致了饱和单层覆盖度的线性下降，从而在特定的氢覆盖度下完全消除乙烯的化学吸附。这些发现对于促进氢化和脱氢催化科学的理解至关重要，特别是对于双金属Pt/Sn催化剂中烯烃氢化活性降低的情况。
