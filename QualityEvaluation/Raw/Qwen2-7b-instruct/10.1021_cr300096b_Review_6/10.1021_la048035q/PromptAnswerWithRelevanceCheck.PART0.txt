The research focuses on the impact of hydrogen adatoms on ethylene adsorption, desorption, and reaction on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Preadsorbed hydrogen reduces the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene and requires less hydrogen to block ethylene chemisorption compared to Pt(111). It decreases the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface. The reaction chemistry of ethylene on this alloy differs significantly from that on Pt(111), with the hydrogenation pathway involving ethylene and hydrogen being completely inhibited. Coadsorbed hydrogen slightly weakens the adsorption energy of ethylene but leads to a linear decrease in the chemisorbed monolayer saturation coverage due to site-blocking effects, eliminating ethylene chemisorption at a specific hydrogen coverage. These findings contribute to our understanding of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis, particularly in relation to the reduced activity of alkene hydrogenation in bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts.

研究集中在氢原子对乙烯在（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附、脱附和反应的影响。预吸附的氢减少了化学吸附的乙烯饱和覆盖率，并且比Pt(111)需要更少的氢来完全阻止乙烯的化学吸附。它降低了合金表面上乙烯的脱附活化能。乙烯在该合金上的反应化学与在Pt(111)上显著不同，涉及乙烯和氢的氢化路径在合金上被完全抑制。预吸附的氢轻微削弱了乙烯的吸附能量，但由于位点阻塞效应导致了饱和单层覆盖度的线性下降，从而在特定的氢覆盖度下完全消除乙烯的化学吸附。这些发现对于促进氢化和脱氢催化科学的理解至关重要，特别是对于双金属Pt/Sn催化剂中烯烃氢化活性降低的情况。

<p>The most significant finding of this investigation is that the reaction pathway that is so prominent on Pt(111) between coadsorbed H adatoms and ethylene resulting in the evolution of gas-phase ethane upon heating is totally blocked on the 3 alloy.</p>
<p>In cases such as this where no appreciable barrier to adsorption is expected to exist, the desorption activation energy is equal to the adsorption energy and one sees that hydrogen weakens slightly (10%) the bonding interaction of coadsorbed ethylene to the alloy surface.</p>
<p>Our results show that only 0.35 ML of preadsorbed H, which occupies one-half the available Pt sites, will totally block the adsorption of ethylene. This indicates that two Pt atoms are required for ethylene adsorption.</p>
<p>Hydrogen coadsorption weakens the interaction between ethylene and the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy surface. One effect is to cause a decrease in the adsorption energy of coadsorbed di-σ-bonded ethylene, but this perturbation is rather small. The most significant, and unexpected, effect of hydrogen coadsorption is to cause a nearly 1:1 site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption.</p>

The research article discusses the influence of surface-bound hydrogen adatoms on the adsorption, desorption, and reaction of ethylene on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. The key findings are that hydrogen coadsorption weakens the interaction between ethylene and the alloy surface, leading to a decrease in the adsorption energy of ethylene. More significantly, hydrogen causes a substantial site-blocking effect on ethylene chemisorption, requiring only 0.35 ML of hydrogen to eliminate ethylene adsorption sites. This indicates that two Pt atoms are needed for ethylene adsorption. The reaction pathway involving ethylene and hydrogen on the Pt(111) surface is completely inhibited on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy, suggesting that hydrogenation of ethylene does not occur under the conditions tested.

本文研究了表面吸附氢原子对乙烯在(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上吸附、脱附和反应的影响。主要发现是，氢共吸附减弱了乙烯与合金表面的相互作用，导致了共吸附乙烯吸附能的下降。更重要的是，氢引起了乙烯化学吸附位点的显著阻塞效应，仅需0.35 ML的氢就能消除乙烯吸附位点。这表明两个铂原子对于乙烯吸附是必需的。在(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金上，Pt(111)表面上存在的以氢为特征的乙烷氢化路径完全被抑制，这意味着在测试条件下，乙烯的氢化并未发生。

<p>The most significant finding of this investigation is that the reaction pathway that is so prominent on Pt(111) between coadsorbed H adatoms and ethylene resulting in the evolution of gas-phase ethane upon heating is totally blocked on the 3 alloy.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 3 for small precoverages of H adatoms, subsequent ethylene exposures produced ethylene desorption in TPD in a peak at 170 K, which is 10 K lower than that from a clean 3 alloy. With increasing θH, ethylene desorption shifted to lower temperatures, and eventually ethylene desorbed in a peak at 162 K for θH  0.19 ML.</p>
<p>The saturation coverage of ethylene on the clean 3 alloy was set to 1.0 on the left axis, and this corresponds to an actual coverage of 0.27 ML.21 The actual ethylene coverages are provided on the right-hand axis. Ethylene coverage was decreased linearly with increasing amounts of preadsorbed H adatoms. For θH = 0.30 ML, the ethylene saturation coverage is reduced to only 18% of that on the clean 3 alloy.</p>
<p>These data suggest that H adatoms effectively block ethylene access to Pt sites on both Pt(111) and the 3 alloy. Such site blocking effects of preadsorbed H have also been observed for benzene 28 and 1,3-butadiene 29 chemisorption on Pt(111).</p>
<p>On the 3 alloy, preadsorbed θH = 0.30 ML blocked 82% of ethylene adsorption sites while twice as much hydrogen, θH = 0.60 ML, only blocked 70% of the ethylene adsorption sites on Pt(111).</p>
<p>The other major finding of this work is the large difference in hydrogenation activity in these experiments between the Pt(111) surface and the 3 alloy. Coadsorption of H adatoms and ethylene on Pt(111) forms mostly ethane upon heating.3,13 This reaction pathway is totally blocked on the 3 alloy.</p>

The research highlights that hydrogen coadsorption significantly affects ethylene adsorption and reaction on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Specifically, it leads to:

1. Decreased saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene. With increasing hydrogen precoverage, the amount of ethylene that can chemisorb onto the alloy surface decreases linearly, reaching only 18% of its saturation coverage at 0.30 ML of hydrogen preadsorption.

2. Site-blocking effect. Hydrogen adatoms effectively prevent ethylene from accessing and chemisorbing onto the surface sites, both on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy and on Pt(111). This site-blocking effect is more pronounced on the alloy surface, requiring less hydrogen to block ethylene adsorption sites.

3. Different hydrogenation activity. The pathway for hydrogenation involving ethylene and hydrogen coadsorption on Pt(111) results in the formation of ethane. This process is completely inhibited on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, indicating a dramatic difference in hydrogenation activity between the two surfaces.

In conclusion, hydrogen coadsorption has significant impacts on ethylene chemistry on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, including decreased ethylene saturation coverage and a site-blocking effect that prevents ethylene from chemisorbing onto the surface, leading to a distinct difference in hydrogenation activity compared to Pt(111).

研究强调了氢共吸附在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金（3×3）R30结构上对乙烯吸附和反应的影响。具体表现为：

1. 降低化学吸附饱和度。随着氢预覆盖量的增加，吸附到合金表面的乙烯量线性减少，达到0.30 ML氢预吸附时仅占其饱和覆盖度的18%。

2. 站点阻塞效应。氢原子有效地阻止了乙烯访问并化学吸附到合金表面和Pt(111)表面的站点，合金表面上的这种站点阻塞效应更为显著，需要较少的氢来阻塞乙烯吸附站点。

3. 不同的氢化活性。在Pt(111)表面上，乙烯和氢共吸附导致形成乙烷的过程。而在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上，这一过程完全被抑制，表明合金表面与Pt(111)表面在氢化活性方面存在明显差异。

综上所述，氢共吸附在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上对乙烯化学产生了重大影响，包括降低乙烯化学吸附饱和度和产生站点阻塞效应，阻止乙烯吸附到表面，导致与Pt(111)表面相比，显著不同的氢化活性。

The study found that hydrogen adatoms on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy significantly impact the adsorption, desorption, and reaction of ethylene. Specifically, preadsorbed hydrogen reduces the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene and requires less hydrogen to block ethylene chemisorption on this alloy compared to pure Pt(111). This is the first report of extensive hydrogen site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption on Pt(111). Moreover, hydrogen adatoms lower the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface. The reaction pathway involving hydrogen addition and leading to ethane formation, which is prominent on Pt(111), is completely inhibited on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy. This indicates a stark difference in the reaction chemistry of ethylene on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy versus pure Pt(111).
