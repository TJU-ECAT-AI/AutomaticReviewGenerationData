The o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations: a theoretical study On the basis of the CASPT2 (multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory) geometry optimization calculations, the ground states of the o-C6H4+ (C2v), m-C6H4+ (C2v), and p-C6H4+ (D2h) radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively. For o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+, the first excited states (12A2 and 12A1, respectively) lie very close to the respective ground states. The small distance value of 1.419 Å between the two dehydrocarbons in the ground-state geometry of m-C6H4+ indicates that there is a real chemical bond between the two dehydrocarbons (the distance in the 12A1 geometry of m-C6H4+ is very long as in the m-C6H4 molecule). The (U)B3LYP isotropic proton hfcc (hyperfine coupling constant) calculation results imply that the ground and first excited states of o-C6H4+ will have similar ESR spectrum patterns while the ground and first excited states of m-C6H4+ will have completely different ESR spectrum patterns.
1. Introduction
The o-, m-, and p-benzyne compounds are known to be involved as intermediates in numerous important reactions and are of a great interest for organic chemists and biochemists.19 Numerous high-level ab initio and DFT theoretical studies have been devoted to the o-, m-, and p-benzynes.915 Most of those previous theoretical studies focused on the S0 and T1 states of the o-, m-, and p-benzynes and on the ground states of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne anions. Accurate calculation results for the S0T1 splittings, the S0 relative energies, and the adiabatic electronic affinity values were reported in those papers.
In recent years, the benzyne radical cations were prepared by experimental workers.16,17 In 2002 Liu et al.16 reported formation of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations from photolysis of Mg+(o-, m-, p-C6H4F2). In 2004 Liu et al.17 reported generation of the o-benzyne radical cation by laser vaporization of magnesium with o-C6H4F2 in argon carrier gas. Experimental studies on the properties of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations are few. There are no theoretical studies on these cations reported in the literature, except some testing B3LYP calculations mentioned in ref. 16.
In the present theoretical work we have studied the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations by using the CASSCF (complete active space self-consistent field)18 and CASPT2 (multiconfiguration second-order perturbation theory)19,20 methods. The ground states of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations have been determined mainly on the basis of the CASPT2 geometry optimization calculation results for low-lying electronic states of the three cations. In the present article we will first report the determined ground states of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations and then report the calculated geometries and properties (including the hyperfine interaction parameters) for the ground states. For the o- and m-benzyne radical cations we will also report the calculated results for the first excited states, which lie very close to the respective ground states.
2. Calculation details
The methodological considerations for the present theoretical study will be presented in section 3.1. In the present section we will only describe the technical details in our theoretical calculations.
The CASSCF and CASPT2 calculations were carried out using the MOLCAS 6.2 quantum-chemistry software.21 A contracted atomic natural orbital (ANO-L) basis set,2224C[4s3p2d1f]/H[3s2p1d], was used. Geometries and atom labelings used for the o-benzyne (C2v), m-benzyne (C2v), and p-benzyne (D2h) radical cations are shown in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1 Structures of o-benzyne (a), m-benzyne (b), and p-benzyne (c).
Based on the CASSCF and CASPT2 geometry optimization calculations for low-lying electronic states of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations, we obtained the CASSCF and CASPT2 adiabatic excitation energies (T0, adiabatic relative energies) of the calculated states. In the CAS calculations for each of the three cations, we used two active spaces: CAS(7,8) and CAS(11,12). For CAS(7,8), 7 electrons were active and the active space included the six π orbitals and the two radical orbitals. For CAS(11,12), 11 electrons were active and the active space included the eight orbitals in CAS(7,8) and four extra orbitals. The active spaces used in the CAS(7,8) and CAS(11,12) calculations are the same as those in our previous CAS(8,8) and CAS(12,12) calculations, respectively, for the o-, m-, and p-benzyne molecules.13 The CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations were performed for all calculated states. For checking the imaginary frequencies produced by the CASSCF frequency calculations for some of the states (CASSCF frequency calculations may erroneously produce too many imaginary frequencies in some cases13,25,26), we performed CASPT2 testing calculations (see section 3.2). At the present stage it is not possible for us to perform the CASPT2 frequency calculations.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Methodological considerations in the present study
3.1.1 Geometric symmetries of the benzyne radical cations Geometries of the electronic states of a molecular cation might have lower symmetries than the ground-state geometry of the parent molecule due to the JahnTeller effect.27,28 Fortunately, the JahnTeller phenomena will not occur for the o-, m-, and p-benzyne cations since the parent molecules belong to the C2v or D2h point group and ionization will not lead to degenerate electronic states of the molecular cations. There are some other possible interactions (such as pseudo-JahnTeller phenomena) which lead to lower geometric symmetries of molecular cations. For example, the n-pentane radical cation (transtrans) in the ground state has a Cs equilibrium geometry while the parent molecule has a C2v equilibrium geometry (see our previous theoretical (B3LYP) paper29). We could locate this Cs equilibrium geometry of the cation because we had detected an imaginary frequency at the obtained C2v structure (a saddle point) in the same potential energy surface (PES).29
In the present study we performed CAS (CASPT2) calculations only for the C2v states of the o- and m-benzyne radical cations and the D2h states of the p-benzyne radical cation. When the CASSCF frequency calculations produced imaginary frequencies for a low-lying C2v or D2h state, we then checked existence of a lower-symmetry minimum around the C2v or D2h structure by performing CASPT2 testing calculations (see section 3.2). As we mentioned above, the CASSCF frequency calculations may erroneously produce imaginary frequencies and we are not able to perform the CASPT2 frequency calculations at the present stage.
3.1.2 Calculated states for the benzyne radical cations In the present study we want to determine the ground states of the three benzyne radical cations in the adiabatic sense (the adiabatic ground states). We simply performed CAS geometry optimization calculations for the lowest doublet state in each of the (four or eight) irreducible representations. Namely, for o-benzyne radical cation we performed CAS (CASPT2) geometry optimization calculations for the 11A1, 11A2, 11B1, and 11B2 states and the lowest-lying state among the four is determined to be the ground state (the same for m-benzyne radical cation) and for p-benzyne radical cation we performed CAS (CASPT2) geometry optimization calculations for the 12Ag, 12B1g, 12B2g, 12B3g, 12Au, 12B1u, 12B2u, and 12B3u states and the lowest-lying state among the eight is determined to be the ground state. 3.1.3 Choice of quantum-chemistry methods The CAS (CASSCF and CASPT2) methods are multiconfiguration-based methods. The CASSCF method incorporates static electron correlation and the CASPT2 method further incorporates dynamic electron correlation. The CAS methods were previously used in our theoretical study13 on the o-, m-, and p-benzyne molecules since these parent molecules have a biradical character and their wavefunctions have a multi-configurational character. The CAS methods are also considered to be effective for theoretical studies of excited electronic states of molecules and molecular ions.26,30 The choice of the CAS methods in the present work stemmed from the following considerations: (i) the ground states of the benzyne radical cations may also have a multi-configurational character in the wavefunctions and (ii) several electronic states, including the excited states, of the benzyne radical cations should be calculated. Single-determinant-based ab initio methods, like HF and MP2, are not a good choice for the present theoretical work. It was already pointed out by Liu et al.16 that the B3LYP method might have serious problems with these radical cation systems, both in energy and geometry (we think that those authors were treating the ground states). Therefore the DFT methods were not considered.
3.2 12B1the ground state of o-benzyne radical cation
In Table 1 are given the CASSCF(7,8), CASPT2(7,8), and CASPT2(11,12) geometry optimization calculation results for the 12A1, 12A2, 12B1, and 12B2 states of the o-benzyne radical cation (C2v), including the adiabatic relative energies (T0) and the C1C6 bond length values (see Fig. 1). The CASPT2(7,8) calculations predict that the four states are in the following T0 order: 12B1, 12A2, 12A1, and 12B2, and indicate that the 12B1 state is the ground state of the o-benzyne radical cation and the 12A2 state is the first excited state lying very close to 12B1. The CASPT2(11,12) calculations for the 12B1 and 12A2 states confirm that 12B1 is the ground state and predict the identical T0 value (0.003 eV) for 12A2.
Table 1 CASSCF(7,8), CASPT2(7,8), and CASPT2(11,12) geometry optimization calculation results for the 12A1, 12A2, 12B1, and 12B2 states of the o-benzyne radical cation (C2v), including the calculated values of the adiabatic relative energies (T0, in eV) and the C1C6 bond lengtha (in Å). The number of imaginary frequencies (Nimag) produced in the CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations is also reported in the table CASSCF(7,8) CASPT2(7,8) CASPT2(11,12)b T0 R (C1C6) Nimag T0 R (C1C6) T0 R (C1C6) 12B1 0.000 1.283 1(b2) 0.000 1.285 0.000 1.285 12A2 0.132 1.247 0 0.003 1.251 0.003 1.251

a The bond length between the two dehydrocarbons. b The CASPT2(11,12) geometry optimization calculations were performed only for the 12B1 and 12A2 states.
As shown in Table 1, the CASSCF(7,8) calculations predict that the 12B1 state lies slightly above 12A2 (the CASSCF T0 values are not reliable) and the CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations for 12B1 produced an imaginary frequency (i1875 cm1) of the b2 symmetry. We performed the CASPT2(7,8) geometry optimization calculations with a Cs (the symmetry plane being the carbon-framework plane) starting geometry, obtained by slightly distorting the C2v geometry of the 12B1 state according to the b2 vibration mode, in the 12A state, and the calculations led to the CASPT2(7,8) C2v optimized geometry of the 12B1 state. These facts indicate that the CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations for 12B1 erroneously produced the imaginary frequency. The CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations for 12A1 produced two imaginary frequencies (in the a2 and b2 symmetries). Since 12A1 is predicted to be higher in energy than 12B1 by 8.2 kcal mol1 (0.356 eV) at the CASPT2(7,8) level (20.0 kcal mol1 (0.871 eV) at the CASSCF(7,8) level), it is unlikely that the low-symmetry minima around the C2v structure (12A1) in the same PES would have lower energies than 12B1 (in the case that the imaginary frequencies were correctly predicted).
For the close-lying 12B1 and 12A2 states, we successfully performed CASSCF(7,8)/6-31G(d,p) conical intersection calculations using the Gaussian 03 programs. At this conical intersection geometry the two states have almost the same energies. The CASPT2(7,8)/ANO-L energies at this conical intersection geometry are only slightly (less than 0.16 eV) higher than the CASPT2(7,8)/ANO-L (//CASPT2(7,8)/ANO-L) energies of the 12B1 and 12A2 states. This is similar to the situation for the 2B1 and 2A2 states of the cyclopentane-1,3-diyl radical cation described by Blancafort et al.31 In Table 2 is given the CASPT2(11,12) optimized geometry of the ground state (12B1) of the o-benzyne radical cation, together with the CASPT2(11,12) geometry of the 12A2 state and the CASPT2(12,12) geometry of the S0 state of the o-benzyne molecule.13 It is noted that the C1C6 bond (the bond between the two dehydrocarbons) and C3C4 bond in the 12B1 geometry are longer than the respective bonds in the parent molecule. The 12A2 geometry is quite different from the 12B1 geometry and it is also quite different from the geometry of the parent molecule. The properties of the ground state of the o-benzyne radical cation will be described in section 3.5.

3.3 12A2the ground state of m-benzyne radical cation
In Table 3 are given the CASSCF(7,8), CASPT2(7,8), and CASPT2(11,12) geometry optimization calculation results for the 12A1, 12A2, 12B1, and 12B2 states of the m-benzyne radical cation (C2v), including the adiabatic relative energies (T0) and the C2C6 bond distance values (see Fig. 1). The CASPT2(7,8) calculations predict that the four states are in the following T0 order: 12A2, 12A1, 12B1, and 12B2, and indicate that the 12A2 state is the ground state of the m-benzyne radical cation and the 12A1 state is the first excited state (T0 = 0.036 eV) lying close to 12A2. The CASPT2(11,12) calculations for the 12A2 and 12A1 states confirm that 12A2 is the ground state and predict a similar T0 value (0.035 eV) for 12A1.
Table 3 CASSCF(7,8), CASPT2(7,8), and CASPT2(11,12) geometry optimization calculation results for the 12A1, 12A2, 12B1, and 12B2 states of the m-benzyne radical cation (C2v), including the calculated values of the adiabatic relative energies (T0, in eV) and the C2C6 distancea (in Å). The number of imaginary frequencies (Nimag) produced in the CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations is also reported in the table CASSCF(7,8) CASPT2(7,8) CASPT2(11,12)b T0 R(C2C6) Nimag T0 R(C2C6) T0 R(C2C6) 12A2 0.000 1.431 0 0.000 1.418 0.000 1.419 12A1 0.530 1.956 0 0.036 1.918 0.035 1.924

a The distance between the two dehydrocarbons. b The CASPT2(11,12) geometry optimization calculations were performed only for the 12A2 and 12A1 states.
As shown in Table 3, the CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations produced no imaginary frequencies for the 12A2, 12A1, and 12B2 states, but produced the two imaginary frequencies for the 12B1 state (in the b1 and b2 symmetries). Since 12B1 is predicted to be higher in energy than 12A2 by 26.6 kcal mol1 (1.159 eV) at the CASPT2(7,8) level (20.8 kcal mol1 (0.906 eV) at the CASSCF(7,8) level), it is unlikely that the low-symmetry minima around the C2v structure (12B1) in the same PES would have lower energies than 12A2 (in the case that the imaginary frequencies were correctly predicted).
In Table 4 is given the CASPT2(11,12) optimized geometry of the ground state (12A2) of the m-benzyne radical cation, together with the CASPT2(11,12) geometry of the 12A1 state and the CASPT2(12,12) geometry of the S0 state of the m-benzyne molecule.13 It is noted that the C2C6 bond (the bond between the two dehydrocarbons) in the 12A2 geometry is much shorter than that in the parent molecule and the C2C3 bond in the 12A2 geometry is much longer than that in the parent molecule. The small C2C6 bond distance value of 1.419 Å (see the CASPT2(7,8) and CASSCF(7,8) values in Table 3) in the 12A2 geometry indicates that there is a real chemical bond between the two dehydrocarbons (see Fig. 1) in the ground state of the m-benzyne radical cation. The bond angle values in the 12A2 geometry are also significantly different from the respective values in the geometry of the parent molecule. The bond length values in the 12A1 geometry are quite similar to the respective values in the geometry of the parent molecule, and the C2C6 bond distance value of 1.924 Å indicates that there is no chemical bond between the two dehydrocarbons (see Fig. 1) in the 12A1 state of the m-benzyne radical cation, as in the parent molecule. The properties of the ground state of the m-benzyne radical cation will be described in section 3.5.

3.4 12B1uthe ground state of p-benzyne radical cation
In Table 5 are given the CASSCF(7,8) and CASPT2(7,8) geometry optimization calculation results for the 12Ag, 12Au, 12B1g, 12B1u, 12B2g, 12B2u, 12B3g, and 12B3u states of the p-benzyne radical cation (D2h), including the adiabatic relative energies (T0) and the C1C4 bond distance values (see Fig. 1). The CASPT2(7,8) calculations predict that the eight states are in the following T0 order: 12B1u, 12Ag, 12B1g, 12B2g, 12Au, 12B3u, 12B3g, and 12B2u, and indicate that the 12B1u state is the ground state of the p-benzyne radical cation. The CASPT2(7,8) T0 values for the seven excited states are all larger than 0.87 eV.

The numbers of imaginary frequencies (Nimag) produced in the CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations are also reported in the table

The CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations for 12B1u produced an imaginary frequency (i2123 cm1) of the b2g symmetry. We performed the CASPT2(7,8) geometry optimization calculations with a C2h starting geometry, obtained by slightly distorting the D2h geometry of the 12B1u state according to the b2g vibration mode, in the 12Bu (12B1u = 12Bu) state, and the calculations led to the CASPT2(7,8) D2h optimized geometry of the 12B1u state. These facts indicate that the CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations for 12B1u erroneously produced the imaginary frequency. The CASSCF(7,8) frequency calculations for 12Ag and 12B1g produced imaginary frequencies. Since 12Ag and 12B1g are predicted to be higher in energy than 12B1u by more than 20 kcal mol1 (0.87 eV) at the CASPT2(7,8) level, it is unlikely that the low-symmetry minima around the D2h structures (12Ag and 12B1g) in the CASPT2(7,8) PESs would have lower energies than 12B1u (in the case that the imaginary frequencies were correctly predicted).
In Table 6 is given the CASPT2(7,8) optimized geometry of the ground state (12B1u) of the p-benzyne radical cation, together with the CASPT2(8,8) geometry of the S0 state of the p-benzyne molecule.13 The C1C4 bond distance (the bond distance between the two dehydrocarbons) in the 12B1u geometry is significantly shorter than that in the parent molecule and the C2C1C6 bond angle in the 12B1u geometry is significantly larger than that in the parent molecule. The properties of the ground state of the p-benzyne radical cation will be described in section 3.5.

3.5 Properties of o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations in the ground states
We calculated the CASSCF(7,8) wavefuctions for the ground states (12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively) of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne radical cations (o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+) at the CASPT2(7,8) optimized geometries. We checked important configurations (with coefficients larger than 0.20) in these wavefunctions. In the ground-state wavefunction of the o-C6H4+cation we found the two important configurations with coefficients of 0.90 and 0.27, which implies that the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation has a somewhat multiconfigurational character. In the ground-state wavefunctions of the m-C6H4+ and p-C6H4+cations we found unique important configurations with coefficients of 0.94 and 0.92, respectively. The important configurations in the CASSCF(7,8) wavefunctions for the ground and excited states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+cations are given in the ESI.
Based on the CASSCF(11,12) ground-state wavefunctions of o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+ calculated at the CASPT2(11,12) geometries and the CASSCF(7,8) ground-state wavefunction of p-C6H4+ calculated at the CASPT2(7,8) geometry, we obtained LoProp charge populations32 and Mulliken spin populations on the C and H atoms in the ground states of the three benzyne radical cations (charge and spin populations are given in the ESI). In the ground states of the three cations all the H atoms have large charge population values and small spin population values. It is noted that the largest spin populations are not on the dehydrocarbons in the ground states of the o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+cations. In the ground state of p-C6H4+, we found very large spin populations on the dehydrocarbons.
In Table 7 are given the isotropic proton hyperfine coupling constant (hfcc) values (a(H)) in the ground states of the three benzyne radical cations, obtained in the (U)B3LYP calculations with the 6-31G(d,p) and 6-311G(d,p) basis sets at the CASPT2(11,12) geometries of the o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+cations and at the CASPT2(7,8) geometry of the p-C6H4+cation. The B3LYP method was considered a good method for reliable prediction of proton hyperfine coupling constants in radical cations.33,34 The a(H) values in the first excited states of o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+ were also calculated and are reported in Table 7. It is noted that the UB3LYP S2 values (see Table 7) for the five calculated states are all only slightly larger than the eigenvalue of 0.75 (though o-C6H4+(12B1), o-C6H4+(12A2), and m-C6H4+(12A2) are π-radicals) and that the calculations with the two basis sets predict very similar a(H) values.

a The UB3LYP calculations were performed at the CASPT2(11,12) optimized geometries for the ground and first excited states of the o- and m-C6H4+cations and at the CASPT2(7,8) optimized geometry for the ground state of the p-C6H4+cation.
In the 12B1 (X2B1) state of o-C6H4+, the a(H2) and a(H3) values are around ()10 G and the a(H1) and a(H4) values are small. In the 12A2 state of o-C6H4+, the a(H1) and a(H4) values are around ()10 G and the a(H2) and a(H3) values are small. Since there are two protons having significant isotropic hfcc values of around 10 G in either 12B1 or 12A2, the ESR spectra for the 12B1 and 12A2 states of o-C6H4+ would have similar patterns (hence the ESR spectra may not be helpful in assignment of the ground state). In the 12A2 (X2A2) state of m-C6H4+, the a(H2) and a(H4) values are around ()12 G and the a(H1) and a(H3) values are small. In the 12A1 state of m-C6H4+, the a(H1) value is around 50 G, the a(H3) value is around 22 G, and the a(H2) and a(H4) values are around 10 G. These data imply that the ESR spectra for the 12A2 and 12A1 states of m-C6H4+ would have completely different patterns (therefore the ESR spectra may be helpful in the assignment of the ground state (12A2)). In the 12B1u (X2B1u) state of p-C6H4+, the a(H) values are around ()3.6 G.
For probing aromaticity in the benzynecations, we calculated NICS (nucleus-independent chemical shift35) values in the ground and first excited states of the o- and m-benzyne cations and in the ground state of the p-benzyne cation at the UB3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and UB3LYP/6-311G(d,p) levels (all the NICS results are given in Table S9 of the ESI). The NICS values indicate that the ground states of the o-, m-, and p-benzyne cations are antiaromatic, nonaromatic, and aromatic, respectively.
4. Conclusions
On the basis of the CASPT2 geometry optimization calculations, the ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+ radical cations were determined to be 12B1, 12A2, and 12B1u, respectively. For the o-C6H4+cation the first excited state is 12A2 (assuming that 22B1 does not lie between 12B1 and 12A2) and it lies very close to the ground state. For the m-C6H4+cation the first excited state is 12A1 (assuming that 22A2 does not lie between 12A2 and 12A1) and it lies close to the ground state.
The ground-state geometries of the o-C6H4+ and p-C6H4+cations are quite different from the S0 geometries of the o-C6H4 and p-C6H4 molecules, respectively. The C2C6 distance value (the distance value between the two dehydrocarbons) and the C2C1C6 bond angle value in the ground-state geometry of the m-C6H4+cation are much smaller than the respective values in the S0 geometry of the m-C6H4 molecule, and the small C2C6 distance value of 1.419 Å indicates that there is a real chemical bond between the two dehydrocarbons in the ground state of the m-C6H4+cation. The C2C3 bond length value and the C1C2C3 bond angle value in the ground-state geometry of the m-C6H4+cation are much larger than the respective values in the S0 geometry of the m-C6H4 molecule. The geometries of the 12A1, 12B1, and 12B2 states of the m-C6H4+cation (see Table 3) have large distance values between the two dehydrocarbons, as in the S0 geometry of the m-C6H4 molecule.
The CASSCF wavefunction for the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation has a somewhat multiconfigurational character. In the ground state of the o-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons. In the ground state of the m-C6H4+cation the largest spin populations are not located on the dehydrocarbons either. In the ground state of the p-C6H4+cation very large spin populations are located on the dehydrocarbons.
Isotropic proton hfcc calculations were performed for the ground states of the o-C6H4+, m-C6H4+, and p-C6H4+cations and for the first excited states of the o-C6H4+ and m-C6H4+cations at the UB3LYP(//CASPT2) level. The calculation results imply that the ground and first excited states of o-C6H4+ will have similar ESR spectrum patterns. The calculation results indicate that the ground and first excited states of m-C6H4+ will have completely different ESR spectrum patterns, and the ESR spectra can be used to support the ground-state assignment based on the energetic results.
