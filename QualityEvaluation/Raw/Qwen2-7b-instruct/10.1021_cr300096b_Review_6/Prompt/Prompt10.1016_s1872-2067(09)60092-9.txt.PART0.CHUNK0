Low-Temperature Hydrogenation and Dehydrogenation of 1,3-Cyclohexadiene on Pt/Ni Bimetallic Catalysts QI Suitao1,2, YU Weiting2, William W. LONERGAN2, YANG Bolun1, CHEN Jingguang G2,* 1State Key Laboratory of Multiphase Flow in Power Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, School of Energy and Power Engineering, Xian Jiaotong University, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, China 2Department of Chemical Engineering, Center for Catalytic Science and Technology (CCST), University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, USA Abstract: Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts and their corresponding monometallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and characterized by CO chemisorption. Their low-temperature activity for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) was tested at 308 K in a batch reactor using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst showed higher activity than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Ni/γ-Al2O3. We correlated the experimental results with density func- tional theory calculations of the binding energy for 1,3-CHD on the corresponding model surfaces. The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity.
Key words: bimetallic; platinum; nickel; alumina; supported catalyst; 1,3-cyclohexadiene; hydrogenation; dehydrogenation; density functional theory Hydrogen is regarded as an ideal energy carrier because of its pollution-free and conversion efficiency characteristics and these are some of the reasons that it is used in fuel cells. The storage, transportation, and distribution of hydrogen are re- ceiving an increasing amount of attention [1,2]. The hydro- genation and dehydrogenation of cyclic hydrocarbons offer the possibility of using these molecules as organic hydrogen storage materials. However, this application requires active catalysts for low-temperature hydrogenation and dehydroge- nation reactions.
The Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst shows promise and has been identified as an active catalyst for the low-temperature hy- drogenation of cycloalkenes including cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclo- hexeadiene, and benzene [35]. Many investigations have combined fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations with the goal of correlating the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces [511]. It has been demonstrated that for the Pt-Ni bimetallic system, the forma- tion of a subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure with an atomic layer of Ni underneath the surface Pt atoms is responsible for the higher hydrogenation activity of the C=C bond than the corresponding monometallic surfaces [8]. A novel low-temperature hydro- genation pathway on Pt-Ni-Pt has been correlated to the weaker binding energies of atomic hydrogen and alkenes,which resulted from the modification of the electronic proper- ties because of the formation of subsurface bimetallic struc- tures [8,10].
In addition to the novel hydrogenation chemistry, surface science studies on the Pt-Ni bimetallic system have also iden- tified a surface bimetallic structure, Ni-Pt-Pt, with a layer of Ni residing on top of the Pt substrate [8]. Both experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the Ni-Pt-Pt sur- face binds adsorbates more strongly than either Pt or Ni sur- faces alone. The strong binding on the Ni-Pt-Pt surface struc- ture leads to the facile production of H2 from the dehydroge- nation of oxygenates [12] and ammonia [13].
In this work, we used 1,3-cyclohexadiene (CHD), an inter- mediate in C6 cyclic hydrocarbon conversion, as a probe QI Suitao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 955960
molecule to investigate the effect of bimetallic formation on hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities. Based on the surface science results described above [8,12,13], the Pt-Ni-Pt subsurface structure should promote low-temperature hydro- genation while the surface Ni-Pt-Pt structure could potentially enhance the dehydrogenation pathway. For supported bi- metallic catalysts, it is most likely that both the subsurface and surface bimetallic structures are present. Herein, we compare the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities of 1,3-CHD over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic with the corresponding monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts using a batch reactor equipped with a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spec- trometer. We also attempt to correlate hydrogenation and de- hydrogenation activities with the binding energy of 1,3-CHD,which was calculated using density functional theory (DFT) modeling. Because of the availability of a large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces [8], the correlation of binding energy with 1,3-CHD hydro- genation and dehydrogenation activities will provide potential opportunities to predict and select promising bimetallic cata- lysts based on DFT calculations.
The preparation of the supported catalysts and CO chemi- sorption measurements are similar to that previously described in detail [3]. The γ-Al2O3 supported Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation using the incipient wetness method. The Ni and Pt loadings were 1.5% and 1.67%, re- spectively. The Ni and Pt solutions were prepared by adding the necessary volume of deionized water to the metal precursor salts. After co-impregnation of the precursor, the catalysts were dried at 383 K for 5 h followed by calcination in air at 573 K for 3 h. The amount of CO chemisorbed onto the catalysts was calculated using a stoichiometry of 1 CO molecule per surface metal atom, which provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the various monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The catalytic activities of 1,3-CHD hy- drogenation and dehydrogenation for these three catalysts were evaluated using a batch reactor with FT-IR. The concentrations of the four main gas-phase species, 1,3-CHD, cyclohexene,cyclohexane, and benzene, were determined using the intensi- ties of the vibrational features at 1 700, 1 139, 1 458, and 1 810 cm1, respectively. Procedures for catalyst reduction and data analysis are similar to our previous work for the hydrogenation of other cycloalkenes [3].
Figure 1 compares the consumption of 1,3-CHD and the formation of cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene as a function of reaction time at 308 K. Two hydrogenation prod- ucts, cyclohexene and cyclohexane, were detected over the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. With an increase in reaction time, cyclo- hexene is further hydrogenated and converted into cyclohex- ane. The Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst promotes both the partial hydro- genation of 1,3-CHD to cyclohexene and dehydrogenation to benzene although the consumption rate of 1,3-CHD is rela- tively slow. The result over Ni/γ-Al2O3 is consistent with the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-CHD over a Ni(100) surface as reported by Tjandra et al. [14].

1,3-CHD over Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 are different from those of the monometallic catalysts. Both cyclohexane and benzene are produced at a much faster initial rate. To quantify the differ- ence between the reaction rates on the three catalysts, first order kinetics is assumed for the consumption of 1,3-CHD. The values of the rate constant k with and without normalization to the number of surface sites based on CO chemisorption are listed in Table 1. The values show that the rate of 1,3-CHD consumption decreases in the order Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/γ-Al2O3
> Ni/γ-Al2O3. The Pt-Ni catalyst also shows much higher production rates for cyclohexane and benzene based on the initial increase in the concentrations of the two products in Fig.
1.
Figure 2 shows FT-IR spectra of different catalysts after the 1,3-CHD hydrogenation reaction and the intensities were normalized based on the number of metal sites. The vibrational features of the CH (3 032 cm1), CH2 (2 926 and 2 853 cm1), C=C (1 647 cm1), and CH3 (1 377 and 1 450 cm1) functional groups indicate that adsorption of the hydrocarbon intermedi- ates and fragments occurred on the surface of the catalysts.
Figure 2 shows that the intensities of the vibrational features are much weaker on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3, indicating that the surface of the bimetallic catalyst remains relatively clean during the reaction and should therefore lead to higher activity.
To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111). Two types of bimetallic surfaces were investigated, the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface structure with a monolayer of Ni residing on top of Pt(111) and the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) configuration with one monolayer of Ni between the first and second layers of Pt. Previous studies have con- firmed that closed-packed monometallic and bimetallic sur- faces are valid model systems to compare trends in binding energies [5,8]. The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) with spin po- larization. A 3×3 slab with four metal layers was used to model the adsorption of 1,3-CHD (1 adsorbate per unit cell). The top two layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy con- figuration while the bottom two layers were fixed at a bulk Pt-Pt bond length as previously described in detail [4,8]. A 3×3×1 Monkhorst-Pack K-point grid mesh was used to de- termine the electronic energies. The optimized configuration for 1,3-CHD adsorption is shown in Fig. 3.
As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]. Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8].
Another interesting observation in Table 2 is that the binding energies of 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are higher on the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111) sug- Table 1  CO chemisorption results and reaction rate constant (k) of 1,3- CHD hydrogenation over different catalysts Catalyst CO uptake (μmol/g) k/ (1/(min·g)) Normalized k (1/(μmol·min)) Ni/γ-Al2O3

gesting that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure should be more thermodynamically favored than the parent metals for the dehydrogenation reaction. Even though the preferred con- figuration is the Pt-Ni-Pt subsurface structure in the presence of hydrogen [15,16], it is most likely that parts of the catalyst surface should resemble the Ni-terminated Ni-Pt-Pt configu- ration because of the structural complexity of supported bi- metallic catalysts. The presence of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure is responsible for the higher dehydrogenation rate on the Pt-Ni/ γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst compared to the monometallic catalysts.
It should be pointed out that reactions of 1,3-CHD are complicated because of the simultaneous hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways, making it more difficult to corre- late binding energies and catalytic activities. Although more detailed experimental and theoretical studies are needed to understand these reactions, it is clear that the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher reaction rates than the Pt and Ni monometallic catalysts. This supports the argument from pre- vious studies that bimetallic catalysts often demonstrate cata- lytic advantages over monometallic catalysts.
In conclusion, combined experimental and DFT results in- dicate that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-CHD, leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst.
By comparison, the surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure shows the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen,which promotes the dehydrogenation pathway. Results from this study identify the critical requirements to synthesize sup- ported bimetallic catalysts with uniform and stable Pt-Ni-Pt or Ni-Pt-Pt structures and to control the low temperature hydro- genation or dehydrogenation of cycloalkenes.
