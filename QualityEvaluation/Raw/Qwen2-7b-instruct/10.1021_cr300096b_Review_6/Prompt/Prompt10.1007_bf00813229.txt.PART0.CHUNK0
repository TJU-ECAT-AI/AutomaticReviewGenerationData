I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Rodriguez 154 Accesses 21 Citations Explore all metrics Abstract The interaction of sulfur with Pt(111), Zn/Pt(111) and Cu/Pt(111) has been examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES), and thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS). At temperatures between 300 and 600 K, the exposure of Pt(111) to S2 gas produces a chemisorbed layer of sulfurwithout the formation of bulk sulfides. Exposure of S2 to a Zn/Pt(111) alloy, at room temperature, results in a breakdown of the alloy and formation of a zinc-sulfide film on Pt(111). Further S2 exposure at 550 K sulfidizes the remaining metallic zincwithout affecting platinum. For the Cu/Pt(111) surface alloy, on the other hand, exposure to S22 at 550 K leads to sulfidation of the platinum. Platinum can effectively compete for sulfur atoms bonded to copper but not for those bonded to zinc. The reaction of S2 gas with Cu/Pt(111) surfaces produces copper sulfides that promote the sulfidation of Pt by providing surface sites for the dissociation of S2, and by favoring the diffusion of S into the bulk of the system.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
