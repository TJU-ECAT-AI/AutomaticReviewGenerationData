Nickel and nickelplatinum as active and selective catalyst for the maleic anhydride hydrogenation to succinic anhydride Abstract Pt, Ni, Co, Cu and bimetallic PtNi, PtCo, PtCu catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 have been studied for the hydrogenation maleic anhydride (MA) to succinic anhydride (SA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2 temperature programmed reduction TPR studies were performed to characterize the catalysts. The flow reactor studies demonstrated that PtNi bimetallic catalyst is highly active and selective for the hydrogenation of MA. Hydrogenation of maleic anhydride produced mainly succinic anhydride and γ-butyrolactone, and the selectivity toward γ-butyrolactone increased with pressure. Using Al2O3 as support, it was possible to obtain the highest reaction rate ever obtained with 90% selectivity to SA at 100% conversion. The process appears to be controlled by H2 dissociation on nickel and the catalytic activity can be further improved, without loss of selectivity, by adding a very small amount of Pt(0.3) to increase the rate of H2 dissociation.
TPR experiments show high-temperature reduction peaks in monometallic Ni catalysts. When Pt is present, the formation of PtNi compound provokes the shift of the reduction peaks and the appearance of new reduction signals.
Highlights The supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity.  A small amount of Pt further improves the activity and selectivity of Ni/Al2O3.  The formation of PtNi compound provokes the shift of the reduction peaks.
1. Introduction
The reaction network for maleic anhydride (MA) hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 1 [1] . In this process, both hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions are involved. Some of the reaction products, succinic anhydride (SA), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), tetrahydrofurane (THF), and 1,4 butanediol (BDO), are important starting materials in chemical industry in order to obtain polymers, pharmaceutical compounds and additives. In particular, SA is required as intermediate for the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries [2] .

In general, SA is currently being manufactured by the liquid and gas phase hydrogenation of MA using several types of hydrogenation metal catalysts, such as Cu [3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] , Pt [13] , Pd [14] ,[15] , Rh [16] , both in liquid phase and gas phase. Among them, Cu-based catalysts have been extensively studied and are already used in commercial processes. Although supported nickel catalysts have been widely used in hydrogenation reaction, relatively few studies have been reported concerning MA hydrogenation over Pt-based catalysts [13] .
It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] , including the enhancement of hydrogenation activities. In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in research into bimetallic catalysts that can improve the reaction selectivity and stability toward selective products [23] ,[24] . Whereas an electronic (i.e., ligand) effect would be expected to influence both the selectivity and activity of bimetallic catalysts. However, except selectivity to a specific product no details on product distribution or catalysis aspects have been investigated for this industrially important reaction. Particularly, the doping effect of the second metal on the catalyst activity and product distribution in hydrogenation of MA needs to be further investigated. Hence, it was the aim of this work to investigate the activity, selectivity and product distribution in liquid phase hydrogenation of MA using Ni metal and bimetallic PtNi catalysts. Over the most active catalyst, systematic studies of the reaction system including the influence of reaction temperature and reaction pressure were carried out. Moreover, metal loading and reaction pressure have been investigated. Furthermore, XRD and H2-TPR were used to characterize the bimetallic catalysts and to determine the possible origin of the enhanced hydrogenation activities of the bimetallic catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalysts used in this study, 5 wt% Ni/Al2O3, were prepared by the kneading method using γ-Al2O3 (BET: 228 m2/g, total pore volume: 0.44 cm3/g) and Ni2O3 (Aldrich). The 0.5 wt% Pt5 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst was prepared using H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aldrich, 99%) and Ni2O3. All the catalysts were dried overnight at 120 C in an oven, and then calcined in air at 550 C for 3 h. The catalysts with 5 wt% Co, Cu and 0.5 wt% Pt were also prepared using the same method to make comparisons with the catalysts 5 wt% Ni loading.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
In situ X-ray diffraction patterns during reduction of catalysts were obtained with a Bruker D8 Advance X-Ray diffractometer equipped with an atmosphere and temperature control stage and using CuKα radiation operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. The powder diffraction patterns were recorded in the 2θ range from 10 to 80.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of H2 was carried out on Auto Chem 2910 (Micromeritics) instrument to study the reducibility. In a typical experiment, 0.050 g of calcined catalyst was exposed to a reducing gas consisting of 5.0 vol% H2 in Ar with a temperature ramp from ambient temperature to 800 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min.
2.3. Catalytic test
The reaction was performed in a fixed-bed reactor operated in the down flow mode. The reaction temperature was measured with a thermocouple in contact with the catalyst bed. The organic feed consisted of a solution of maleic anhydride in γ-butyrolactone (22 wt%) and was fed into the reactor by a micro-syringe pump. For each experiment, 1 g of unreduced catalyst (2040 mesh) was loaded into the flow reactor. The catalyst was reduced in situ at atmospheric pressure with H2 (flow rate 32 cm3/min) for 3 h. The products were analyzed using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (flame ionization detector, HP-5 column, 30 m × 5 mm × 0.25 μm) and confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS).
Maleic anhydride (MA) conversion and selectivity to the product i was calculated according to:(1) (2) where MAin, MAout and Producti,out represent the concentration of reactant or products entering (in) or leaving (out) the reactor.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD of optimizing catalysts
Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of all samples examined at the big angle showed the characteristic peaks for NiO species at 2θ = 37.24, 43.34 and 64.48 corresponding to the planes (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) of cubic NiO species, respectively [25] . The XRD characteristic peaks associated with Pt0 or PtO phase were not observed in the Ni (5%)Pt (0.5)/Al2O3 sample. This was probably due to the very low amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) present and/or a very good dispersion of Pt phase on all the alumina supports.

3.2. TPR analysis
XRD and TPR are complimentary techniques that when used in conjunction help identify the oxidation states of a reducible metal oxide and estimate the interaction of the metal oxide with the support. The TPR profiles of the samples are presented in Fig. 3 . The presence of Pt in the sample can be precluded by the absence of a reduction peak at 190 and 260 C. As shown in Fig. 3 , supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts could be reduced at a much lower temperature than the Ni monometallic catalyst and the reduction temperature range became narrower. For example, the reduction temperature of the first step decreased from approximately 400 C for 5% Ni/Al2O3 to 350 C for the 5% Ni0.5% Pt/Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst. The presence of Pt in the PtNi catalysts appears to promote the reduction of nickel oxides through hydrogen spillover. Pt can be reduced at lower temperatures than Ni; therefore hydrogen that dissociates on the surface of Pt could migrate to the surface of Ni2O3 and support, resulting in Ni being reduced at much lower temperatures in the bimetallic catalysts [24] .

3.3. Comparison of different catalysts
Table 1 shows the maleic anhydride hydrogenation over the three series of bimetallic catalysts and the corresponding monometallic catalysts in the flow reactor study. SA and GBL were the only observed reaction products, and the product distributions are presented in Table 1 . For Ni and Co series of catalysts, it was observed that the activity and selectivity over the bimetallic catalysts were greater than that of either monometallic Ni or Co. And the Cu and CuPt show the intermediate activity and selectivity. The results showed that supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity among all as-prepared catalysts in MA hydrogenation, which mostly attributed to the PtNi bimetallic formation.

To do this, we have prepared a series of new catalysts based on the 5% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst doped with increasing amounts of Pt from 0.1 to 0.5, as will be described below ( Fig. 4 ).

Results in Fig. 4 show that while activity of these NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts for the hydrogenation of MA, measured as conversion, increases when increasing Pt content, the SA selectivity to reduce the MA decreases for Pt contents over 0.3 (see Fig. 4 for a detailed distribution of reaction products). Moreover, this result has been compared in Fig. 4 with a catalytic system containing 0.3 of Pt but no nickel and 5% Ni/Al2O3 MA conversion observed in the latter case indicates that even if such small amount of Pt is the key to increase the catalyst activity, the presence of nickel remains necessary to promote the hydrogenation of the MA. Then, the final 5% Ni0.3% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst gives the best conversion (100%) and selectivity (90.6%) to SA results since it is active and limits reactions to GBL. The 100% conversion of MA did not change, but the selectivity of SA decreased with increasing Pt loading. This is because that overhydrogenated reaction occurred. In addition, we have checked that, contrary to the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, the 5% Ni0.3% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst can efficiently work in the lower temperature ( Fig. 5 ), which is important from an economic of the process.

3.4. Effect of reaction pressure on the MA conversion and SA selectivity
The effect of H2 pressure on the maleic anhydride hydrogenation ( Fig. 6 ) shows that 100% MA conversion with more than 90% selectivity to SA could be obtained at 150 C. Product conversion and selectivity, however, vary significantly with changes in pressure ( Fig. 6 ). It is seen that SA selectivity decreased with increase in H2 pressure from 1.0 to 1.6 MPa. As mentioned, this is because that overhydrogenated reaction easily occurred in the high pressure. Similar results were reported in the MA hydrogenation with Pd/Al2O3 and RuCl2(TPP)3 catalyst [26] ,[27] . The gas phase reaction under 0.4 MPa and 0.8 MPa at 150 C yielded much lower MA conversion than that obtained under 1 MPa at the same temperature. As a result, the selectivity in this system can be affected but by varying the hydrogen pressure, as well.

3.5. Time on stream study
In Fig. 7 are reported the results of the catalytic hydrogenation of MA carried out with a 5% Ni0.3% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst under optimized conditions. It is noteworthy that these excellent catalytic performances are representative of a very stable catalytic situation, since no traces of deactivation and product distribution change are observed even over the 120 h run time. Stable performance of a similar catalyst of the addition of 0.01 of Pt to Au/TiO2 catalyst has been reported previously over 24 h on the stream [2] . In this PtAu bimetallic catalytic system, Budroni and Corma [2] found that the small amount of Pt doped into Au showed better activity and selectivity than monometallic Au, due to formation of mixed AuPt ensembles that work as a bi-functional catalytic system.

In addition, the 5% Ni0.3% Pt/Al2O3 was also tested to make comparison with 5% Ni loading but no Pt at equal conditions ( Fig. 8 ).

Fig. 8 shows the changes in conversion and selectivity with time on stream at 220 C for hydrogenation of MA over Ni and PtNi catalysts, respectively, at identical reaction conditions. For the Ni catalyst ( Fig. 8 a), Ni catalyst is not very active at the beginning of the test, but after an induction period of about 3 h the conversion raises steeply to 100% ( Fig. 8 a). As can be seen the selectivity to SA parallels the increase of conversion, starting from an initial value of 57% and reaching 89%. The conversion of maleic anhydride was stable up to around 9 h of reaction, after which considerable loss of catalytic activity occurred. In addition, changes in selectivity also were observed for the Ni catalyst; the selectivity toward SA decreased from 89% (the 7th hour) to 67% (the 16th hour), whereas that selectivity toward GBL increased from 11% to 33% in this period. In agreement with the results shown here, previous studies have reported that the rapid deactivation was initially attributed to carbonaceous compounds deposited on the metal surface [1] .In contrast, the PtNi catalyst showed high activity and stability; no deactivation or change in product distribution was observed over 16 h on stream ( Fig. 8 b). The product distribution more closely resembled that of the Ni catalyst, with SA and GBL as the reaction products. The unusual activity and stability for MA conversion on the PtNi catalyst likely is related to the direct participation of neighboring Pt sites in a bifunctional mode of catalytic transformation. Clearly, the selectivity of the PtNi is closely linked to the surface Ni sites, whereas the much higher activity and stability of the PtNi composition ( Fig. 8 ) can be attributed to the hydrogenation ability of the Pt sites. Another important difference between Ni and PtNi catalysts is that with the promoted catalyst no induction period is observed, which could be another direct proof of the beneficial electronic effects. The presence of an induction period is quite common for Ni hydrogenation catalysts. Generally it has been related to a partial (or total) oxidation of nickel, which is necessary to activate the carbonyl hydrogenation [28] .
3.6. Comparing the activity of PtNi with other metal catalysts
The results obtained with PtNi have been compared with those reported in the literature using Rh and Pd catalysts.
Table 2 indicates that, per atom of metal, Pt is, at least, one order of magnitude more active than any Rh catalysts reported. Taking as reference the work of Liu et al.
[16] (who tested various catalyst precursors), we observe that the most active catalyst precursor giving high selectivity to SA is RhCl(PPh)3 at 110 C and 2 MPa. It shows a specific activity of 220 molSA h1 mol1Me, which is largely 877 molSA h1 mol1Me surpassed with PtNi/Al2O3 at 100 C and 1 MPa.

There is an interesting report on the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride in supercritical CO2 medium in place of toxic and hazardous organic solvents. Comparing the specific rates of Pd/Al2O3 [26] , RuCl2(TPP)3 [27] , and PtNi/Al2O3 reported in Table 2 , PtNi/Al2O3 is still more active than Pd/Al2O3 and RuCl2(TPP)3. PtNi/Al2O3 catalyst shows higher activity compared with Pd/Al2O3 and similar activity compared with the activated RuCl2(TPP)3 ( Table 2 ). In other words platinum, by itself, is a very active and selective catalyst to produce SA, avoiding consecutive hydrogenations to take place.
4. Conclusion
Supported PtCo, PtNi, PtCu bimetallic and Pt, Co, Ni, Cu monometallic catalysts on γ-Al2O3 have been prepared by simple kneading method and evaluated using flow reactor for maleic anhydride hydrogenation. Different catalytic activity and product selectivity patterns were observed for these catalysts. The results showed that supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity among all as-prepared catalysts in maleic anhydride hydrogenation, which mostly attributed to the PtNi bimetallic formation. A small amount of Pt further improves the activity and selectivity of Ni/Al2O3. Overall, the bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts and exhibited distinct hydrogenation activities for maleic anhydride.
