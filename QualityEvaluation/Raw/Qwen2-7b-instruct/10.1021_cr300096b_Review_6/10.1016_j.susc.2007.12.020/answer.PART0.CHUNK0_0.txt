[1] "Comparing to monometallic surfaces, bimetallic surfaces have shown promise due to their better selectivity toward the hydrogenation of the C@O bond of some a,b-unsaturated aldehydes."
[2] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on Ni(111) reduces the number of sites for acrolein adsorption, leading to reduced yields of CO and Cads as shown in Table 1."
[3] "As summarized in Table 1, the saturated aldehyde (propanal) is the main self-hydrogenation product on the 1 ML PtNiPt(111) surface, with an activity of 0.09 propanal per surface Pt atom."
[4] "The presence of Ni atoms on the second layer of a Pt(111) surface shifts the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center) away from the Fermi level as compared to either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."

1. Bimetallic surfaces demonstrate improved selectivity for hydrogenating the C@O bond in certain a,b-unsaturated aldehydes compared to monometallic surfaces.
2. Pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the Ni(111) surface decreases the availability of adsorption sites for acrolein, causing a reduction in the yields of CO and Cads.
3. The PtNiPt(111) surface with a monolayer coverage produces propanal as the main self-hydrogenation product, with an activity of 0.09 propanal per surface Pt atom.
4. The second layer of Ni atoms on a Pt(111) surface alters the energy of the Pt d-band, moving it away from the Fermi level in comparison to Pt(111) or Ni(111) surfaces.

1. 双金属表面在某些a,b不饱和醛的氢化中显示出对C@O键的更好选择性，与单金属表面相比。
2. Ni(111)表面预先吸附的氢降低了acrolein的吸附位点数量，导致CO和Cads的产率降低。
3. 在PtNiPt(111)表面上，覆盖一层的产物主要是丙酮，每单位Pt原子的活性为0.09个丙酮。
4. Pt(111)表面第二层的Ni原子改变了Pt能带的能量，将其从费米能级移动到Pt(111)或Ni(111)表面。
