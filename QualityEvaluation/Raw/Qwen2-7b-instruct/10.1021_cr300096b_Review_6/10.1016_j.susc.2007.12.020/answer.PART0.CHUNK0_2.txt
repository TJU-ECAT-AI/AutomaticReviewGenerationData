[1] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on Ni(111) reduces the number of sites for acrolein adsorption, leading to reduced yields of CO and Cads as shown in Table 1."
[2] "The yield to 2-propenol increases by a factor of 12.5 (from 0.002 to 0.025 molecule per Pt atom), while the yield to propanal increases only by 0.3 (from 0.09 to 0.12 molecule per Pt atom)."
[3] "The vibrational features are similar to those of acrolein on clean PtNiPt(111) (Fig. 6), with one difference being that there is a clear splitting of the m(C@C) and m(C@O) modes at 1610 and 1684 cm1, respectively."

1. Pre-adsorbed hydrogen on Ni(111) decreases the number of sites for acrolein adsorption, resulting in lower yields of CO and Cads.
2. The yield of 2-propenol increases by 12.5 times, while the yield of propanal increases by only 0.3 times on the PtNiPt(111) surface.
3. The HREELS spectra show a distinct separation of the m(C@C) and m(C@O) modes at 1610 and 1684 cm1, respectively, on the PtNiPt(111) surface.

1. 在Ni(111)表面预吸附氢气会减少丙烯醛的吸附位点数量，导致CO和Cads的产率降低。
2. 在PtNiPt(111)表面上，2-丙烯醇的产率增加了12.5倍，而丙酮的产率仅增加了0.3倍。
3. HREELS谱图显示出C@C和C@O模式在1610和1684 cm1处有明显的分离。
