[1] "Comparing to monometallic surfaces, bimetallic surfaces have shown promise due to their better selectivity toward the hydrogenation of the C@O bond of some a,b-unsaturated aldehydes."
[2] "The formation of both ketene and propene was also reported by Zaera and de Jesus on the Pt(111) surface [27,30]."
[3] "The self-hydrogenation yield to propanal is 0.014 molecule per surface metal atom, significantly lower than that on the PtNiPt(111) surface."
[4] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on Ni(111) reduces the number of sites for acrolein adsorption, leading to reduced yields of CO and Cads as shown in Table 1."
[5] "The vibrational feature in Fig. 8 appears at 1569 cm1, which is too low in frequency to be the m(C@O) mode and suggests the bonding between the C@O moiety and the H/PtNi Pt(111) surface."

1. Bimetallic surfaces demonstrate improved selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the C@O bond in certain a,b-unsaturated aldehydes compared to monometallic surfaces.

2. The formation of ketene and propene was observed during the hydrogenation of acrolein on the Pt(111) surface, as reported by Zaera and de Jesus.

3. The self-hydrogenation yield of propanal on the 1 ML PtNiPt(111) surface is notably higher than on pure Pt(111).

4. Pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the Ni(111) surface decreases the availability of adsorption sites for acrolein, resulting in decreased yields of CO and Cads as documented in Table 1.

5. The observed vibrational feature at 1569 cm1 in Figure 8 indicates bonding between the C@O moiety and the surface, rather than being the m(C@O) mode.

1. 双金属表面在某些a,b不饱和醛的氢化中显示出对C@O键更好的选择性，与单一金属表面相比具有潜力。

2. Zaera和de Jesus报告了在Pt(111)表面上氢化乙醛时形成酮烯和丙烯。

3. 在1 ML PtNiPt(111)表面上，丙醛的自氢化产率明显高于纯Pt(111)。

4. 预吸附的氢气在Ni(111)表面上减少了乙醛的吸附位点的数量，导致CO和Cads的产率降低，如表1所示。

5. 图8中观察到的振动特征在1569 cm1处出现，表明C@O基团与表面之间的结合，而不是m(C@O)模式。
