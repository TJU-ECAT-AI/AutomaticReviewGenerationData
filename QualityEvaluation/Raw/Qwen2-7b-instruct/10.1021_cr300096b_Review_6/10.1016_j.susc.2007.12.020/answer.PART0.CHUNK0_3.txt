The literature does not contain specific quotes addressing the experimental verification of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems using HREELS and AES techniques. The document focuses on the hydrogenation and adsorption of acrolein on different surfaces including Pt(111), Ni(111) film, and PtNiPt(111) bimetallic surfaces. It does not provide details on the methods used to verify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni atoms in PtNiPt(111) bimetallic systems.

No relevant quotes are available in the document to answer the question about how experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems.
