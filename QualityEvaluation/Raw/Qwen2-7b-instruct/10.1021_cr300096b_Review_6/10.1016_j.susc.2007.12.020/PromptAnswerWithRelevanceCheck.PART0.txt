How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "Comparing to monometallic surfaces, bimetallic surfaces have shown promise due to their better selectivity toward the hydrogenation of the C@O bond of some a,b-unsaturated aldehydes."
[2] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on Ni(111) reduces the number of sites for acrolein adsorption, leading to reduced yields of CO and Cads as shown in Table 1."
[3] "As summarized in Table 1, the saturated aldehyde (propanal) is the main self-hydrogenation product on the 1 ML PtNiPt(111) surface, with an activity of 0.09 propanal per surface Pt atom."
[4] "The presence of Ni atoms on the second layer of a Pt(111) surface shifts the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center) away from the Fermi level as compared to either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."

The literature does not contain specific quotes addressing the experimental verification of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems using HREELS and AES techniques. The document focuses on the hydrogenation and adsorption of acrolein on different surfaces including Pt(111), Ni(111) film, and PtNiPt(111) bimetallic surfaces. It does not provide details on the methods used to verify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni atoms in PtNiPt(111) bimetallic systems.

[1] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on Ni(111) reduces the number of sites for acrolein adsorption, leading to reduced yields of CO and Cads as shown in Table 1."
[2] "The hydrogenation selectivity, defined as the ratio between the yield of a hydrogenation compound and the total yield of hydrogenation compounds, is 98%, which is in agreement with the thermodynamic preference for the hydrogenation of the C@C bond in a,b-unsaturated aldehydes [49]."
[3] "The difference between the binding energies of the three geometries is much smaller, making it possible for the surface to effectively interact with the C@O moiety, which should facilitate the production of 2-propenol."
