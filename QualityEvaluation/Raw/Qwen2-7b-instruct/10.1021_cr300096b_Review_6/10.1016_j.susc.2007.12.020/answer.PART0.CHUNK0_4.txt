[1] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on Ni(111) reduces the number of sites for acrolein adsorption, leading to reduced yields of CO and Cads as shown in Table 1."
[2] "The hydrogenation selectivity, defined as the ratio between the yield of a hydrogenation compound and the total yield of hydrogenation compounds, is 98%, which is in agreement with the thermodynamic preference for the hydrogenation of the C@C bond in a,b-unsaturated aldehydes [49]."
[3] "The difference between the binding energies of the three geometries is much smaller, making it possible for the surface to effectively interact with the C@O moiety, which should facilitate the production of 2-propenol."

1. Pre-adsorbed hydrogen on Ni(111) reduces the number of acrolein adsorption sites, decreasing the yields of CO and Cads.
2. The hydrogenation selectivity of the PtNiPt(111) surface is 98%, aligning with the thermodynamic preference for hydrogenating the C@C bond in a,b-unsaturated aldehydes.
3. The reduced difference in binding energies between the three geometries on the H/PtNiPt(111) surface allows for effective interaction with the C@O moiety, promoting the production of 2-propenol.

1. 预吸附的氢气在Ni(111)上减少了丙烯醛的吸附位点数量，导致CO和Cads的产量减少。
2. PtNiPt(111)表面的氢化选择性为98%，与a,b-不饱和醛中C@C键的热力学偏好一致。
3. H/PtNiPt(111)表面上三种几何形状之间的结合能差异较小，使得表面能够有效地与C@O基团相互作用，促进2-丙烯醇的生成。
