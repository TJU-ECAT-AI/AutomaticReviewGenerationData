[1] "Although bimetallic nanoparticles synthesized in supercritical CO2 led to more agglomerated materials than those in THF, no important differences were observed in catalysis."
[2] "Confined PtRu nanoparticles showed higher catalytic activity and selectivity than unsupported nanoparticles."

The experimental techniques, such as the observation of more agglomerated materials when bimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized in supercritical CO2 compared to THF, verified the impact of the solvent on the structure of the nanoparticles. The higher catalytic activity and selectivity of confined PtRu nanoparticles over unsupported ones quantified the benefits of encapsulation within carbon nanotubes on the performance of these catalysts.
