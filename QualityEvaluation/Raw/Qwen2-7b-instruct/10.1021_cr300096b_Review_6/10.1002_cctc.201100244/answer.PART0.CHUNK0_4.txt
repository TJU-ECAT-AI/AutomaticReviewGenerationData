The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include HREELS (High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). These methods measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of the atoms, which are then compared with predictions made by Density Functional Theory (DFT).

The results indicate that confined PtRu nanoparticles exhibit higher catalytic activity and selectivity compared to their unsupported counterparts. The selectivity towards cinnamyl alcohol (COL) is enhanced due to the confinement effect within multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), leading to a higher local concentration of reactants and catalysts. The use of phosphine ligands stabilizes the nanoparticles, causing them to appear more agglomerated compared to those stabilized by pyridine ligands. Moreover, the performance of the catalysts is influenced by the size of the particles; larger particles, such as those found in the confined system, contribute to improved selectivity towards COL.

In summary, the experimental verification of surface segregation through HREELS and AES, combined with the comparative analysis of catalytic performance, supports the understanding of the behavior of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems under confinement. The enhanced activity and selectivity of the confined catalysts can be attributed to the higher local concentrations of reactants and catalysts within the MWCNT cavities, along with the specific effects of ligand type and particle size on the system's overall reactivity.

验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面层析的3d原子（如Ni和Co）采用的技术包括高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和AES（俄歇电子能谱）。这些方法测量了原子的层析动力学和激活壁垒，并与基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的预测进行比较。

结果显示，限制在多壁碳纳米管（MWCNT）内的铂Ru纳米粒子的催化活性和选择性高于其无支持状态。通过MWCNT腔体的限制效果增强了对cinnamyl醇（COL）的选择性，这主要归因于反应物和催化剂的局部浓度增加。磷配体稳定化的纳米粒子比以吡啶配体稳定的纳米粒子表现出更多的团聚现象。此外，催化剂性能受颗粒大小的影响；较大的颗粒，如在限制系统中发现的，有助于提高对COL的选择性。

总之，通过HREELS和AES的实验验证，结合催化性能的比较分析，支持了限制在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的理解。受限催化剂的增强活性和选择性可以归因于MWCNT腔体内反应物和催化剂的更高局部浓度，以及特定的配体类型和颗粒大小对系统整体反应性的影响。
