<p>The results obtained with PtRuLx and PtRuLx@MWCNT are reported in Tables2 and 3, respectively.</p>
<p>The confinement of PtRuNPs inside MWCNTs produces a drastic increase in the activity; the TOFs obtained for the confined catalysts were found in the range between 8 and 13h<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>Regarding selectivity, it has already been shown that the use of bimetallic PtRu catalysts foster high selectivity towards COL.</p>
<p>As a result of this energy barrier, the CC bond cannot approach the surface as closely as the CO bond and so the latter is hydrogenated preferentially.</p>
<p>Whatever the system investigated, the presence of PtRuNPs in the inner cavity was observed (FigureS4 in the Supporting Information), pointing out the stability of these systems.</p>

The experimental results demonstrated that the confined PtRu nanoparticles exhibited significantly enhanced activity compared to their unsupported counterparts. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) for the confined catalysts ranged from 8 to 13 h<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, the use of bimetallic platinum-ruthenium catalysts was found to promote high selectivity towards cinnamyl alcohol (COL) in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. The selectivity increased with the particle size of the confined catalysts, likely due to a steric effect that prevented the cinnamaldehyde molecule from adsorbing parallel to the metal surface. Furthermore, the stability of the confined PtRu nanoparticles was confirmed by observing their presence in the inner cavity of the carbon nanotubes after catalytic runs.

实验结果表明，受限的铂-钌纳米粒子的活性显著高于其非受限的对应物。受限催化剂的周转频率（TOF）范围在8到13 h<sup>-1</sup>之间。此外，使用双金属铂-钌催化剂能够促进高选择性向肉桂醇（COL）。选择性随着受限催化剂颗粒尺寸的增加而提高，这可能是因为一个立体效应，阻止肉桂醛分子与金属表面平行吸附。此外，通过观察催化运行后碳纳米管内腔中存在PtRu纳米粒子，证实了这些系统的稳定性。
