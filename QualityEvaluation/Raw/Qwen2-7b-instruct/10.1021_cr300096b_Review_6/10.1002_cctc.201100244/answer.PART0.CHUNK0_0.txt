1. Bimetallic nanoparticles synthesized in supercritical CO2 resulted in more agglomerated materials compared to those in THF, but there were no significant differences in catalytic performance.

2. Confined platinum-ruthenium nanoparticles demonstrated higher catalytic activity and selectivity than their unsupported counterparts.

3. The use of a confined cavity for catalysis affects properties at both the mesoscopic and microscopic scales.

4. The planar structure of cinnamaldehyde (CAL) prevents adsorption parallel to a flat metal surface due to steric repulsion from the aromatic ring.

5. The carbon-carbon (CC) bond cannot approach the surface as closely as the carbon-oxygen (CO) bond, leading to preferential hydrogenation of the latter.

6. The stability of confined platinum-ruthenium nanoparticles was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses post-catalytic runs.

1. 在超临界CO2中合成的双金属纳米颗粒导致了比THF中的更聚集的材料，但在催化性能上没有显著差异。

2. 包含在碳纳米管内腔中的铂-钌纳米粒子显示出了高于非支撑纳米粒子的更高催化活性和选择性。

3. 使用受限的腔体进行催化作用影响了介观和微观尺度上的性质。

4. 由于芳香环的立体排斥，平面结构的苯甲醛（CAL）不能平行吸附到平坦的金属表面。

5. 碳-碳（CC）键不能接近表面像碳-氧（CO）键那样靠近，因此后者被优先氢化。

6. 通过催化运行后的透射电子显微镜（TEM）分析验证了受限铂-钌纳米颗粒的稳定性。
