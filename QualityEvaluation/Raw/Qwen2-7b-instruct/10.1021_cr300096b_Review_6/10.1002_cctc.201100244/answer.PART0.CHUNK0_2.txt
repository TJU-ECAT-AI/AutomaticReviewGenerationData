[1] "The synthesis of platinum-ruthenium nanoparticles in supercritical CO2 led to more agglomerated materials than those in THF."
[2] "Both types of bimetallic nanoparticles were further confined into functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes."
[3] "Confined PtRu nanoparticles showed higher catalytic activity and selectivity than unsupported nanoparticles."

Answer: The platinum-ruthenium nanoparticles synthesized in supercritical CO2 showed increased agglomeration compared to those made in THF. When these nanoparticles were confined within functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes, they demonstrated superior catalytic activity and selectivity compared to the unsupported nanoparticles.
