[1] "Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous carbon materials."
[2] "We demonstrate compatibility between the evidence of classical sorption experiments and NMR cryoporometry on pore size distribution."
[3] "These distributions have to be referred to heterogeneities in the pore space."
[4] "Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 lm."

Answer: The spatial extension of the regions with structural differences in porous carbon materials, as evidenced by differences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules, can be estimated to be at least 20 micrometers.
