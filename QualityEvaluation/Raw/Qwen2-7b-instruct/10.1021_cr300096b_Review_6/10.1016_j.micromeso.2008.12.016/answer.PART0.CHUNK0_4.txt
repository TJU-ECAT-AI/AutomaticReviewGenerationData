[1] "Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous carbon materials."
[2] "We demonstrate compatibility between the evidence of classical sorption experiments and NMR cryoporometry on pore size distribution."
[3] "These distributions have to be referred to heterogeneities in the pore space."
[4] "Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 μm."

The NMR techniques, including cryoporometry, relaxometry, and diffusometry, were utilized to analyze the porosity of carbon materials. The pore size distributions derived from these methods correlate with variations in the pore space, indicating the presence of structural disparities across the materials. These disparities manifest as differences in the diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation rates of the confined molecules. The spatial extent of these regions showing structural differences is estimated to be at least 20 micrometers, suggesting significant heterogeneity within the carbon materials.

将核磁共振（NMR）技术，包括凝固点降低法、弛豫度测量和扩散性测量，应用于碳材料的孔隙度表征。这些方法得到的孔径分布与孔隙空间的差异相关联，表明材料中存在结构上的不均一性。这些不均一性体现在被限制分子的扩散率和核磁共振弛豫率的差异上。这些显示结构差异的区域的空间范围估计至少为20微米，暗示碳材料内部存在显著的异质性。
