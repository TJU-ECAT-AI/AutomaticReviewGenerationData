1. NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry, and diffusometry were utilized to characterize porous carbon materials.
2. The spatial extent of regions with structural differences, as shown by variations in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of probe molecules, is estimated to be at least 20 μm.
3. The pore size distribution for RGC30 is broader than that for MAC-LMA12, with an additional broad peak centered at around 15 nm in the latter.
4. Mean relaxation rates were determined from the initial slopes of slow components of relaxation curves.
5. The smaller fraction of molecules is attributed to those confined in micropores, while the larger fraction is associated with the liquid in the mesopore space.
6. The contribution of the first term in Eq. (15) increases with vapor phase pressure, influencing the magnitude of p1.

1.NMR透热度、弛豫度和扩散度被用于表征多孔碳材料。
2.结构差异区域的空间范围，通过探针分子的扩散率和核磁共振弛豫率的变化表现出来，估计至少为20μm。
3.RGC30的孔径分布比MAC-LMA12更宽，在后者中有一个中心位于约15nm的额外宽峰。
4.从弛豫曲线的初始斜率确定了慢成分的平均弛豫率。
5.较小的一部分分子归因于那些被困在微孔中的分子，而较大的一部分与介孔空间中的液体相关联。
6.第一项在方程（15）中的贡献随着蒸气相压力的增加而增加，影响p1的大小。
