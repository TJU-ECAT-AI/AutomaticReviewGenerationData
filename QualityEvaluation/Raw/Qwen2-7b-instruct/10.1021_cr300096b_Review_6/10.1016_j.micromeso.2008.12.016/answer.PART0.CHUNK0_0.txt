[1] "Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous carbon materials."
[2] "There is a distribution in both the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients."
[3] "Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 lm."
[4] "The proportion of micropores and mesopores on carbon materials strongly depends on the synthesis procedure used."
[5] "The proportion of microporosity is required to achieve a high surface area, i.e. a high adsorption capacity, while the presence of some mesoporosity is quite often desirable."
[6] "The relaxation times of ethanol and nitrobenzene were shorter than in toluene, correlating with the much stronger polarity of these liquids in comparison with toluene."
[7] "The diffusion behavior of several liquids (acetone, ethanol, tol- uene, n-decane and nitrobenzene) confined in MAC-LMA12 was compared."

1. NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry, and diffusometry were employed to analyze the porous carbon materials.

2. Distributions of both nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients were observed.

3. The spatial extent of regions with structural variations, inferred from differences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation, might be estimated to be around 20 micrometers.

4. The proportion of micropores and mesopores in carbon materials largely depends on the synthesis method used.

5. Microporosity is crucial for achieving a high surface area and adsorption capacity, while mesoporosity is often advantageous.

6. Ethanol and nitrobenzene had shorter relaxation times than toluene, indicating higher polarity.

7. The diffusion behaviors of various liquids in MAC-LMA12 were contrasted.

1. 对多孔碳材料应用了核磁共振微孔度量、核磁共振弛豫和扩散方法进行表征。

2. 观察到了核磁共振弛豫率和扩散系数的分布。

3. 结构差异区域（通过探针分子在微孔空间中的扩散和核磁共振弛豫差异证据）的空间范围可能估计为大约20微米。

4. 碳材料中微孔与介孔的比例主要取决于合成方法。

5. 微孔性对于实现高比表面积和吸附能力至关重要，而某些介孔的存在往往是有利的。

6. 乙醇和硝基苯的弛豫时间比甲苯短，这与它们更高的极性有关。

7. 对于各种液体在MAC-LMA12中的扩散行为进行了对比。
