The experimental techniques used in this study to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include DFT calculations, specifically focusing on the oxygen dissociative binding energy. The predicted stability of the subsurface 3d metal in both Pt(111) and Pt(100) surfaces in the presence of oxygen is also calculated. The comparison of the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions provides insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation processes in these systems.
