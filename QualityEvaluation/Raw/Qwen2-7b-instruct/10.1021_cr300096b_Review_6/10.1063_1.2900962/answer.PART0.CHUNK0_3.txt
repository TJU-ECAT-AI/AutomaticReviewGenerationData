The experimental techniques such as high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The stability of PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures was assessed after exposing them to oxygen. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers were then compared with theoretical predictions obtained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和俄歇电子能谱（AES），被用来验证和量化氧诱导表面中3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面迁移。对暴露于氧气的PtNiPt和PtCoPt结构的稳定性进行了评估。然后，测量的迁移动力学和活化势垒与通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算获得的理论预测进行了比较。
