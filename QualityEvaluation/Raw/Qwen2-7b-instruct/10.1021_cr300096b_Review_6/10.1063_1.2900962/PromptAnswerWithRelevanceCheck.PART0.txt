Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods allowed researchers to measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, comparing these values with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for the systems.
