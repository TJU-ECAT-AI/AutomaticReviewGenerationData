The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These methods were employed alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the stability of subsurface 3d metal in Pt(111) and Pt(100) surfaces exposed to oxygen. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers were then compared with the DFT predictions for these systems.
