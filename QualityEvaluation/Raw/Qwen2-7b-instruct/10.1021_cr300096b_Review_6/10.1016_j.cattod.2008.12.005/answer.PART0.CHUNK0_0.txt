1. The surface d-band center was calculated using DFT. The details of the calculations were previously reported.
2. FePtPt(1 1 1) had increased H2 and CO peak areas compared to Pt(1 1 1), though not as much as NiPtPt(1 1 1).
3. TiPtPt(1 1 1) had higher reforming yield compared to PtTiPt(1 1 1) while keeping similar selectivity to Pt(1 1 1).
4. PtFePt(1 1 1) and PtTiPt(1 1 1) showed higher reforming yields than Pt(1 1 1).
5. Surface segregation of the 3d metal may occur on these surfaces, either incomplete diffusion to the subsurface or re-segregation upon reactant adsorption.

1.DFT用于计算表面d带中心。详细的计算方法在之前有报道。
2.FePtPt(1 1 1)的H2和CO峰面积相对于Pt(1 1 1)有所增加，但增幅不如NiPtPt(1 1 1)。
3.TiPtPt(1 1 1)的重整产率高于PtTiPt(1 1 1)，同时保持与Pt(1 1 1)相似的选择性。
4.PtFePt(1 1 1)和PtTiPt(1 1 1)的重整产率高于Pt(1 1 1)。
5.这些表面上3d金属可能产生层状结构，可能是由于扩散不完全或吸附反应剂后重新排列到表面。
