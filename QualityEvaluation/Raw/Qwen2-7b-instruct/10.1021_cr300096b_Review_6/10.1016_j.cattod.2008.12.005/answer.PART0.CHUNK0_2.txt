1. The experimental techniques of AES and HREELS were utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES was employed to measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of Ni and Co, comparing these values with DFT predictions for the systems. 

2. The preparation procedures for PtTiPt(111) were adjusted from those for Ni-, Co-, and Fe-based Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The key difference was that higher deposition temperatures (900 K instead of 600 K) were required to drive Ti atoms into the subsurface, unlike Ni, Co, and Fe which could be driven into the subsurface at 600 K.

3. The reforming activity of the 3d-Pt bimetallic surfaces (Ni, Fe, Ti) was positively correlated with the surface d-band center being closer to the Fermi level. This trend was consistent with earlier predictions and observations on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

4. The reactivity trends on Fe/Pt(111) and Ti/Pt(111) surfaces followed the earlier studies on Ni/Pt(111), indicating that 3d-PtPt(111) surfaces exhibited the highest activity for reforming oxygenates.

5. The preparation of subsurface monolayers for Ni, Co, and Fe involved a deposition temperature of 600 K, whereas for Ti, a higher temperature of 900 K was necessary to drive the atoms into the subsurface.

6. The reforming selectivity of oxygenates, particularly ethanol, decreased as the d-band center approached the Fermi level, suggesting that optimal catalysts for reforming oxygenates should contain Ni, Co, or Fe on Pt(111).

7. The study confirmed that the surface monolayer structures (FePtPt(111) and TiPtPt(111)) displayed higher reforming activities for both ethylene glycol and ethanol than the corresponding subsurface structures (PtFePt(111) and PtTiPt(111)) and clean Pt(111).

8. The AES measurements provided insights into the surface composition and structure of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, which was crucial for understanding the reactivity trends and optimizing the preparation methods.

9. The DFT calculations were used to predict the binding energies of adsorbates and the electronic properties of the surfaces, which influenced the reforming activity and selectivity.

10. The reforming yield increased as the surface d-band center shifted closer to the Fermi level, indicating that surfaces with a higher reactivity towards oxygenates were those with a d-band center closer to the Fermi level.

1. AES和HREELS实验技术被用来验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（Ni和Co）的表面分层。AES用于测量Ni和Co的分层动力学和激活能壁垒，并将其与DFT预测进行比较。
