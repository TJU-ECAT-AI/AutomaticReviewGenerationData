1. The experimental techniques of AES and HREELS were utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES was employed to measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of Ni and Co, comparing these values with DFT predictions for the systems. 

2. The preparation procedures for PtTiPt(111) were adjusted from those for Ni-, Co-, and Fe-based Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The key difference was that higher deposition temperatures (900 K instead of 600 K) were required to drive Ti atoms into the subsurface, unlike Ni, Co, and Fe which could be driven into the subsurface at 600 K.

3. The reforming activity of the 3d-Pt bimetallic surfaces (Ni, Fe, Ti) was positively correlated with the surface d-band center being closer to the Fermi level. This trend was consistent with earlier predictions and observations on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

4. The reactivity trends on Fe/Pt(111) and Ti/Pt(111) surfaces followed the earlier studies on Ni/Pt(111), indicating that 3d-PtPt(111) surfaces exhibited the highest activity for reforming oxygenates.

5. The preparation of subsurface monolayers for Ni, Co, and Fe involved a deposition temperature of 600 K, whereas for Ti, a higher temperature of 900 K was necessary to drive the atoms into the subsurface.

6. The reforming selectivity of oxygenates, particularly ethanol, decreased as the d-band center approached the Fermi level, suggesting that optimal catalysts for reforming oxygenates should contain Ni, Co, or Fe on Pt(111).

7. The study confirmed that the surface monolayer structures (FePtPt(111) and TiPtPt(111)) displayed higher reforming activities for both ethylene glycol and ethanol than the corresponding subsurface structures (PtFePt(111) and PtTiPt(111)) and clean Pt(111).

8. The AES measurements provided insights into the surface composition and structure of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, which was crucial for understanding the reactivity trends and optimizing the preparation methods.

9. The DFT calculations were used to predict the binding energies of adsorbates and the electronic properties of the surfaces, which influenced the reforming activity and selectivity.

10. The reforming yield increased as the surface d-band center shifted closer to the Fermi level, indicating that surfaces with a higher reactivity towards oxygenates were those with a d-band center closer to the Fermi level.

1. AES和HREELS实验技术被用来验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（Ni和Co）的表面分层。AES用于测量Ni和Co的分层动力学和激活能壁垒，并将其与DFT预测进行比较。

2. 对于PtTiPt(111)的制备程序，调整了与Ni、Co和Fe基Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的不同。关键区别在于，为了将Ti原子驱动到亚表面，需要更高的沉积温度（900K，而非600K），而Ni、Co和Fe可以在600K下被驱动到亚表面。

3. 表面d带中心接近费米能级时，3d-Pt双金属表面（Ni、Fe、Ti）的活性与之正相关。这一趋势与先前在Ni/Pt(111)双金属表面上的预测和观察一致。

4. Fe/Pt(111)和Ti/Pt(111)表面的反应性趋势遵循了先前在Ni/Pt(111)上的研究，表明3d-PtPt(111)表面具有最高的氧气还原活性。

5. 制备Ni、Co和Fe的亚表面层涉及600K的沉积温度，而对于Ti，则需要更高的温度（900K）来将原子驱动到亚表面。

6. 特别是对于乙二醇和乙醇的重整，表面单层结构（FePtPt(111)和TiPtPt(111)）显示出了比对应的亚表面结构（PtFePt(111)和PtTiPt(111)）和清洁的Pt(111)更高的重整活性。

7. AES测量为理解Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系的表面组成和结构提供了见解，这对于了解反应性趋势并优化制备方法至关重要。

8. DFT计算用于预测吸附物的结合能和表面的电子性质，这些性质影响了氧气还原活性和选择性。

9. 随着表面d带中心向费米能级靠近，重整产率增加，这表明活性更高的表面是那些d带中心更接近费米能级的表面。

10. 研究确认了表面单层结构（FePtPt(111)和TiPtPt(111））在对乙二醇和乙醇的重整表现出高于相应的亚表面结构（PtFePt(111)和PtTiPt(111)）和清洁的Pt(111)的活性。

The PtTiPt(1 1 1) surface does not follow any of the trends, and displays very low reforming selectivity for both ethylene glycol and ethanol. Further work is needed to understand the properties of this surface, especially surface characterization to confirm that the Ti is driven to the subsurface, forming the ideal PtTiPt(1 1 1) surface structure.

The PtTiPt(1 1 1) surface shows very low reforming selectivity for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, not following the established trends. Further investigation is required to elucidate the surface characteristics, particularly to ascertain whether the titanium atoms are indeed positioned in the subsurface, creating the optimal PtTiPt(1 1 1) structure.

The reforming yield displays an increasing trend as the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level, confirming earlier predictions.
The preparation procedure for PtTiPt(1 1 1) must be altered from that for the corresponding Pt-3d-Pt(1 1 1) surfaces involving Ni, Co, and Fe, as higher deposition temperatures (900 K compared to 600 K) are required to drive the Ti atoms into the subsurface.
The reforming selectivity of oxygenates, especially ethanol, begins to decrease as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. This suggests that optimal 3d-Pt catalysts for reforming of oxygenates include Ni, Co, or Fe as the 3d metal, as earlier 3d transition metals can lead to decreased selectivity.
The reactivity trends on Fe/Pt(1 1 1) and Ti/Pt(1 1 1) follow earlier work reported on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, with 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) surfaces displaying the highest activity.
