The surface monolayer FePtPt(1 1 1) and TiPtPt(1 1 1) structures display higher reforming activities for both ethylene glycol and ethanol than the corresponding subsurface monolayer PtFePt(1 1 1) and PtTiPt(1 1 1) structures and clean Pt(1 1 1).
The reforming yield displays an increasing trend as the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level, confirming earlier predictions.
The preparation procedure for PtTiPt(1 1 1) must be altered from that for the corresponding Pt-3d-Pt(1 1 1) surfaces involving Ni, Co, and Fe, as higher deposition temperatures (900 K compared to 600 K) are required to drive the Ti atoms into the subsurface.
The reforming selectivity of oxygenates, especially ethanol, begins to decrease as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. This suggests that optimal 3d-Pt catalysts for reforming of oxygenates include Ni, Co, or Fe as the 3d metal, as earlier 3d transition metals can lead to decreased selectivity.
The reactivity trends on Fe/Pt(1 1 1) and Ti/Pt(1 1 1) follow earlier work reported on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, with 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) surfaces displaying the highest activity.

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES characterizations show that deposition temperatures for driving Ti atoms into the subsurface of PtTiPt(111) are significantly higher (900 K) compared to Ni, Co, and Fe (600 K). The reforming selectivity of oxygenates, especially ethanol, decreases as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. This suggests that optimal 3d-Pt catalysts for reforming of oxygenates include Ni, Co, or Fe as the 3d metal, as earlier 3d transition metals can lead to decreased selectivity.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，用于验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。AES表征显示，将Ti原子驱动到PtTiPt(111)的亚表面所需的沉积温度显著高于Ni、Co和Fe（900K与600K）。氧代物的重整选择性，尤其是乙醇的选择性，随着费米能级附近的表面d带中心的移动而降低。这表明最优的3d-Pt催化剂用于氧代物的重整包括Ni、Co或Fe作为3d金属，因为较早的3d过渡金属可能导致选择性的降低。
