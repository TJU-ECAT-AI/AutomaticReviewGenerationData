One possible explanation is that surface segregation of the 3d metal occurred on these surfaces. This could be because diffusion of the more reactive 3d metal to the subsurface was incomplete on the prepared surfaces, or re-segregation to the surface occurred upon adsorption of the reactants.

A plausible explanation is that surface segregation of the 3d metal took place on these surfaces. This might result from incomplete diffusion of the more reactive 3d metal to the subsurface on the prepared surfaces, or re-segregation back to the surface upon adsorption of the reactants.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
一个可能的解释是在这些表面上发生了3d金属的表面分离。这可能是由于在准备的表面上3d金属的活性更高的部分未能完全扩散到亚表面，或者在吸附反应物后发生重新再聚积到表面。
