The PtTiPt(1 1 1) surface does not follow any of the trends, and displays very low reforming selectivity for both ethylene glycol and ethanol. Further work is needed to understand the properties of this surface, especially surface characterization to confirm that the Ti is driven to the subsurface, forming the ideal PtTiPt(1 1 1) surface structure.

The PtTiPt(1 1 1) surface shows very low reforming selectivity for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, not following the established trends. Further investigation is required to elucidate the surface characteristics, particularly to ascertain whether the titanium atoms are indeed positioned in the subsurface, creating the optimal PtTiPt(1 1 1) structure.
