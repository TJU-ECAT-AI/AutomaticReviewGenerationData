Answer: There are no specific quotes provided in the literature that detail experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES for verifying and quantifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. Nor does the literature provide comparisons between the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers and DFT predictions for these systems.
