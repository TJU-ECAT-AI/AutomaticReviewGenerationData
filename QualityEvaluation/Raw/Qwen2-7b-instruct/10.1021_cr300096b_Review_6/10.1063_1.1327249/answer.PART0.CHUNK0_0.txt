Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The kinetics and activation barriers for the observed segregation were compared against DFT predictions.
