The experimental techniques utilized to investigate the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are HREELS and AES. These methods allow for the verification and quantification of the segregation process. The measured kinetics and activation barriers obtained from the experiments are then compared with predictions made through Density Functional Theory (DFT).

为了研究氧诱导表面同位素在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中亚表面3d原子，特别是Ni和Co的表面同位素，我们使用了高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和俄歇电子能谱（AES）等实验技术。这些方法能够验证和量化同位素分离过程。从实验中获得的分离动力学和激活势垒与密度泛函理论（DFT）的预测进行了比较。
