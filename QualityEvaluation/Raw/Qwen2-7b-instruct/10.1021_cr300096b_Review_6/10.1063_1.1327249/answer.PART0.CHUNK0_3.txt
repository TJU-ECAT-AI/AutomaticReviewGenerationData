1. Experimental techniques like HREELS and AES were used to study the interaction of sulfur with Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) surfaces. These techniques provide quantitative information on the surface composition and structure, which helps in understanding the reactivity of sulfur towards these surfaces.
2. The reactivity of sulfur towards Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) surfaces depends on the surface coverage and the metal-metal bonding. HREELS and AES measurements were performed to analyze the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The results showed a good agreement with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions.

1. 实验技术如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和AES（Auger电子能谱）被用来研究硫与Pt(111)和Sn/Pt(111)表面的相互作用。这些技术提供了关于表面组成和结构的定量信息，有助于理解硫对这些表面的反应性。
2. 硫与Pt(111)和Sn/Pt(111)表面的反应性取决于表面覆盖度和金属间的结合。进行了HREELS和AES测量来分析Ni和Co在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的分层动力学和活化势垒。结果与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测有很好的一致性。
