Experimental techniques such as HREELS, AES, and XPS were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS data indicated the presence of surface intermediates related to the segregation process. AES measurements confirmed the segregation of Ni and Co atoms on the Pt(111) surface. The DFT predictions matched the experimental observations regarding the segregation kinetics and activation barriers.
