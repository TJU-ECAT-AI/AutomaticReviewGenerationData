[1] "In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to model the reactivity of methanol on Co/Pt (111) and Ni/Pt (111) bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "The experimental techniques used include thermally programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS)."
[3] "These methods allow us to observe the formation of various surface intermediates during the reaction."
[4] "By comparing the results obtained from both DFT calculations and experimental observations, we aim to understand the reactivity trends for methanol on these bimetallic surfaces."
[5] "The kinetic data obtained from the experiments, such as the rates of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, can be compared with the predictions made by DFT calculations."

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and TPD are utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods enable the observation of the formation of various surface intermediates during the reaction. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers are compared with DFT predictions for these systems.
