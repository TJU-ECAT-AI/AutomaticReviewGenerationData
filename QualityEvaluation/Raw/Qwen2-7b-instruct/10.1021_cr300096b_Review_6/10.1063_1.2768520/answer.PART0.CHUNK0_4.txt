The experimental techniques, specifically thermally programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (primarily Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The comparison of kinetic parameters and activation barriers obtained from both experimental and theoretical approaches allowed for the verification of the observed segregation.

The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers were consistent with the predictions made by density functional theory (DFT) calculations for these systems.

在本研究中，我们使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来调查甲醇在Co/Pt（111）和Ni/Pt（111）双金属表面的反应趋势。实验方法包括热程序脱附（TPD）和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）。我们从TPD实验中量化了反应产率，并通过HREELS数据识别了表面中间体。并且比较了在Pt-Co-Pt（111）和Co-Pt-Pt（111）表面上得到的结果。

通过分析实验和理论方法获得的动态参数和活化能垒，验证了氧诱导的表面亚表面3d原子（主要为Ni和Co）的分布。测量的分布动力学和活化能垒与这些系统的DFT计算预测一致。
