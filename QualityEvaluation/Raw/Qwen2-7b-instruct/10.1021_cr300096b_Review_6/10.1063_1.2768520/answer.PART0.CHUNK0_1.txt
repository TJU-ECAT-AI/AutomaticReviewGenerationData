[I. INTRODUCTION] The study focuses on the reactivity trends for methanol on Co/Pt (111) and Ni/Pt (111) bimetallic surfaces.
[II. MODELING AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS] DFT calculations and experimental techniques including Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) are employed.
[V. DISCUSSION] The quantification of reaction yields from TPD, identification of surface intermediates from HREELS, and comparison of PtCoPt(111) and CoPtPt(111) surfaces are discussed.

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which are compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems.
