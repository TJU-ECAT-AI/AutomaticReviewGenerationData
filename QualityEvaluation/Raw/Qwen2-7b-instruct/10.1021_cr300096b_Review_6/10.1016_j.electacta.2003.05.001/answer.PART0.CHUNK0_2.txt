[1] "Nonlocal gradient corrected DFT slab calculations were carried out to determine the overall reaction energies along with the barriers for the activation of water and the oxidation of CO over well-defined Pt(111) and PtRu(111) surfaces."
[2] "The addition of Ru to Pt along with the presence of solution helps to enhance the elementary steps that comprise the bifunctional mechanism."
[3] "Water will desorb before it will react on Pt(111)."
[4] "Alloying Pt with Ru lowers the barriers for the homolytic as well as the heterolytic activation of water in solution."
[5] "The resulting surface Ru-OH group that forms induces the adsorption and subsequent activation of water at a neighboring Pt site."
[6] "The barrier for the subsequent oxidation of adsorbed CO by surface OH groups over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is 86 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of 21 kJ/mol."
[7] "The barrier is reduced to 71 kJ/mol when carried out over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy in the vapor phase."
[8] "These results indicate that at potentials which are less than or equal to the potential of zero total charge, water activation over Pt(111) may be difficult. CO oxidation, however, is more likely limiting over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy at these potentials."

The document presents a first principles analysis using nonlocal gradient corrected density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations to investigate the activation of water and the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) over platinum (Pt) and platinum-ruthenium (PtRu) (111) surfaces. The presence of ruthenium (Ru) enhances the activation of water and the bifunctional mechanism for CO oxidation, particularly when the activation occurs in solution. The document also discusses the differences in activation barriers for water over pure Pt(111) surfaces compared to PtRu(111) surfaces. The oxidation of CO by surface hydroxyl groups over Pt(111) surfaces has an activation barrier of 86 kJ/mol, while this barrier is reduced to 71 kJ/mol over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy. The document further suggests that at potentials less than or equal to the potential of zero total charge, water activation over Pt(111) may be challenging, whereas CO oxidation over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy might be more limiting under these conditions.

文档使用了非局部梯度校正密度泛函理论（DFT）片层计算，对在定义明确的Pt(111)和PtRu(111)表面进行水激活和CO氧化进行了初步原理分析。Ru的存在增强了水的激活和CO氧化的双功能机制，特别是当激活发生在溶液中时。文档还讨论了水在纯Pt(111)表面与PtRu(111)表面之间的激活壁垒差异。在Pt(111)表面，水的氧化激活壁垒为86 kJ/mol，而在Pt66.7%Ru33.3%合金上，这个壁垒降低至71 kJ/mol。文档进一步指出，在小于或等于零总电荷的电位下，Pt(111)表面上的水激活可能具有挑战性，而Pt66.7%Ru33.3%合金上的CO氧化可能在这些条件下更具限制性。
