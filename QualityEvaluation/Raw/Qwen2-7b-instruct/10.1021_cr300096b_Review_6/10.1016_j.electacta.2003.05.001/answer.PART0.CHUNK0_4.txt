Nonlocal gradient corrected DFT slab calculations were carried out to determine the overall reaction energies along with the barriers for the activation of water and the oxidation of CO over well-defined Pt(111) and PtRu(111) surfaces. 

The addition of Ru to Pt along with the presence of solution helps to enhance the elementary steps that comprise the bifunctional mechanism. 

The activation of water over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is energetically unfavorable with an activation barrier of +142 kJ/mol and overall heat of reaction of +53 kJ/mol. 

Water will desorb before it will react on Pt(111). 

The presence of solution reduces the barrier to about 75 kJ/mol. 

The addition of Ru lowers the barrier for water activation in the vapor phase. 

Alloying Pt with Ru lowers the barriers for the homolytic as well as the heterolytic activation of water in solution. 

The presence of solution, however, markedly favors the heterolytic activation which leads to the formation of an adsorbed OH* surface intermediate, a proton which migrates into solution and an electron. 

The energetics for this path over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3%(111) surface were calculated to be quite favorable with an activation barrier of +27 kJ/mol and an overall energy of reaction of +26 kJ/mol. 

Ab initio molecular dynamics results indicate that water can be activated over PtRu at 300 K. 

The resulting surface Ru-OH group that forms induces the adsorption and subsequent activation of water at a neighboring Pt site. 

The barrier for the subsequent oxidation of adsorbed CO by surface OH groups over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is 86 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of 21 kJ/mol. 

The barrier is reduced to 71 kJ/mol when carried out over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy in the vapor phase. 

The barrier for the homolytic disproportionation of CO and OH in solution (over Pt66.7%Ru33.3%) is 90 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of +24 kJ/mol. 

The heterolytic path which involves the oxidation of CO by OH to form CO2+H+(aq)+e is more favorable than the homolytic path. 

The activation barrier for the heterolytic path over Pt66.7%Ru33.3% is +60 kJ/mol with an overall reaction of 6 kJ/mol (exothermic).

These results indicate that at potentials which are less than or equal to the potential of zero total charge, water activation over Pt(111) may be difficult. 

CO oxidation, however, is more likely limiting over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy at these potentials.

The document provides insights into the activation of water and oxidation of CO over Pt and PtRu surfaces through nonlocal gradient corrected DFT slab calculations. It reveals that the addition of Ru to Pt surfaces, along with the presence of solution, enhances the bifunctional mechanism for CO oxidation. Specifically, the presence of Ru lowers the barriers for water activation, both in vapor phase and in solution, favoring the heterolytic activation pathway, which results in the formation of an adsorbed OH* intermediate. The overall reaction energy for this pathway over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3%(111) surface is +26 kJ/mol, indicating a favorable energetics. Furthermore, the document indicates that the oxidation of CO by surface OH groups has a lower barrier over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy compared to pure Pt(111), suggesting that CO oxidation is more likely to be the rate-limiting step under certain potentials.

该文献通过非局部梯度校正DFT层计算，提供了水活化和CO氧化在Pt和PtRu表面的见解。它揭示了向Pt表面添加Ru以及溶液的存在，可以增强CO氧化的双功能机制。具体来说，Ru的添加降低了水活化过程中的壁垒，无论是气相还是溶液中，更倾向于异裂激活途径，导致形成吸附的OH*中间体。在Pt66.7%Ru33.3%(111)表面进行此路径的总能量反应为+26 kJ/mol，表明了有利的能量效应。此外，文献指出，在Pt66.7%Ru33.3%合金上，表面OH对CO的氧化具有较低的壁垒与纯Pt(111)表面相比，表明在某些电位下，CO氧化可能是限制步骤。
