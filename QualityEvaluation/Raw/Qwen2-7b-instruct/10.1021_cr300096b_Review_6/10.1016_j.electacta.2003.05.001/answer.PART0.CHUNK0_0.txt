Nonlocal gradient corrected DFT slab calculations were carried out to determine the overall reaction energies along with the barriers for the activation of water and the oxidation of CO over well-defined Pt(111) and PtRu(111) surfaces.
The addition of Ru to Pt along with the presence of solution helps to enhance the elementary steps that comprise the bifunctional mechanism.
Water will desorb before it will react on Pt(111).
The presence of solution reduces the barrier to about 75 kJ/mol.
The activation of water over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is energetically unfavorable with an activation barrier of +142 kJ/mol and overall heat of reaction of +53 kJ/mol.
Alloying Pt with Ru lowers the barriers for the homolytic as well as the heterolytic activation of water in solution.
The energetics for this path over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3%(111) surface were calculated to be quite favorable with an activation barrier of +27 kJ/mol and an overall energy of reaction of +26 kJ/mol.
The barrier for the subsequent oxidation of adsorbed CO by surface OH groups over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is 86 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of 21 kJ/mol.
The barrier is reduced to 71 kJ/mol when carried out over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy in the vapor phase.
The barrier for the homolytic disproportionation of CO and OH in solution (over Pt66.7%Ru33.3%) is 90 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of +24 kJ/mol.
The heterolytic path which involves the oxidation of CO by OH to form CO2+H+(aq)+e is more favorable than the homolytic path.
The activation barrier for the heterolytic path over Pt66.7%Ru33.3% is +60 kJ/mol with an overall reaction of 6 kJ/mol (exothermic).
These results indicate that at potentials which are less than or equal to the potential of zero total charge, water activation over Pt(111) may be difficult.
CO oxidation, however is more likely limiting over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy at these potentials.
These results only hold for the ideal conditions studied herein including ideal single crystal surfaces, an ideal liquid water solution phase and the absence of an applied potential.

The study utilized nonlocal gradient corrected density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations to analyze the reaction energies and barriers involved in carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation over platinum (Pt) and a platinum-ruthenium (PtRu) alloy (66.7% Pt and 33.3% Ru) surfaces. The presence of ruthenium (Ru) on the platinum surface, along with the solvent (solution), facilitates the activation of water and enhances the bifunctional mechanism for CO oxidation. The research found that water activation over pure Pt(111) is energetically unfavorable, requiring a high activation barrier of +142 kJ/mol and an overall reaction energy of +53 kJ/mol. In contrast, the presence of solution significantly reduces the barrier for water activation to approximately 75 kJ/mol. Furthermore, alloying Pt with Ru decreases the activation barriers for both homolytic and heterolytic water activation in solution, particularly when the activation occurs over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy. This suggests that the PtRu alloy is more conducive to the efficient activation of water compared to pure Pt. The study also explored the subsequent steps of CO oxidation, finding that the barrier for CO oxidation by surface hydroxyl (OH) groups over pure Pt(111) is higher (86 kJ/mol) compared to the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy (71 kJ/mol). Additionally, the heterolytic pathway for CO oxidation, where CO is oxidized by OH to produce CO2, H+, and e-, was found to be more favorable than the homolytic pathway. The activation barrier for the heterolytic pathway over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy is +60 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of 6 kJ/mol, indicating an exothermic process. The findings suggest that under certain conditions, particularly those involving ideal single crystal surfaces, an ideal liquid water solution phase, and the absence of an applied potential, CO oxidation over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy might be more favorable than water activation over pure Pt(111).

研究使用了非局部梯度校正密度泛函理论（DFT）片层计算，以分析碳氧化合物（CO）在纯铂（Pt）和铂-钌（PtRu）合金（66.7% Pt和33.3% Ru）表面的反应能量和壁垒。钌（Ru）在铂表面上的存在，结合溶剂（溶液），有助于水的活化并增强CO氧化的双功能机制。研究发现，水在纯Pt(111)上的活化是能量上不利的，需要高达+142 kJ/mol的活化壁垒和+53 kJ/mol的整体反应能量。相比之下，溶液的存在显著降低了水活化的壁垒到大约75 kJ/mol。此外，将Pt与Ru合金化减少了溶液中水活化的活化壁垒，特别是当活化发生在Pt66.7%Ru33.3%合金上时。这表明PtRu合金相对于纯Pt更有利于高效地激活水。研究还探讨了CO氧化的后续步骤，发现纯Pt(111)上由表面羟基（OH）团簇氧化CO的壁垒较高（86 kJ/mol），而Pt66.7%Ru33.3%合金上的壁垒较低（71 kJ/mol）。此外，CO氧化的异裂途径，其中CO通过OH被氧化产生CO2、H+和e-，比同裂途径更为有利。在Pt66.7%Ru33.3%合金上，异裂途径的激活壁垒为+60 kJ/mol，整体反应能量为6 kJ/mol，表明这是一个放热过程。研究结果表明，在某些条件下，特别是那些包括理想的单晶表面、理想液体水溶液相以及不存在外加电势的理想条件时，Pt66.7%Ru33.3%合金上的CO氧化可能比纯Pt(111)上的水活化更为有利。
