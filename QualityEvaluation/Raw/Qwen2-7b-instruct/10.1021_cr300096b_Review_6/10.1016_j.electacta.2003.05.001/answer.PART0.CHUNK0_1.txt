Nonlocal gradient corrected DFT slab calculations were carried out to determine the overall reaction energies along with the barriers for the activation of water and the oxidation of CO over well-defined Pt(111) and PtRu(111) surfaces.
The addition of Ru to Pt along with the presence of solution helps to enhance the elementary steps that comprise the bifunctional mechanism.
The activation of water over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is energetically unfavorable with an activation barrier of +142 kJ/mol and overall heat of reaction of +53 kJ/mol.
Water will desorb before it will react on Pt(111).
The presence of solution reduces the barrier to about 75 kJ/mol.
The addition of Ru lowers the barrier for water activation in the vapor phase.
Alloying Pt with Ru lowers the barriers for the homolytic as well as the heterolytic activation of water in solution.
The presence of solution, however markedly favors the heterolytic activation which leads to the formation of an adsorbed OH* surface intermediate, a proton which migrates into solution and an electron.
The energetics for this path over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3%(111) surface were calculated to be quite favorable with an activation barrier of +27 kJ/mol and an overall energy of reaction of +26 kJ/mol.
Ab initio molecular dynamics results indicate that water can be activated over PtRu at 300 K.
The resulting surface Ru-OH group that forms induces the adsorption and subsequent activation of water at a neighboring Pt site.
The barrier for the subsequent oxidation of adsorbed CO by surface OH groups over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is 86 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of 21 kJ/mol.
The barrier is reduced to 71 kJ/mol when carried out over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy in the vapor phase.
The barrier for the homolytic disproportionation of CO and OH in solution (over Pt66.7%Ru33.3%) is 90 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of +24 kJ/mol.
The heterolytic path which involves the oxidation of CO by OH to form CO2+H+(aq)+e is more favorable than the homolytic path.
The activation barrier for the heterolytic path over Pt66.7%Ru33.3% is +60 kJ/mol with an overall reaction of 6 kJ/mol (exothermic).
These results indicate that at potentials which are less than or equal to the potential of zero total charge, water activation over Pt(111) may be difficult.
CO oxidation, however is more likely limiting over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy at these potentials.
These results only hold for the ideal conditions studied herein including ideal single crystal surfaces, an ideal liquid water solution phase and the absence of an applied potential.

The document provides insights into the computational modeling of CO oxidation over Pt and PtRu surfaces, specifically focusing on the impact of Ru addition and solvent effects on the activation of water and the oxidation of CO. It demonstrates that the presence of Ru lowers the barriers for water activation both in the vapor phase and in solution, favoring the heterolytic pathway. This pathway facilitates the formation of an adsorbed OH* intermediate, which then migrates into solution, leading to a more favorable energetics for CO oxidation over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy compared to pure Pt. The results suggest that under certain potentials, CO oxidation over the alloyed surface is more likely to occur than water activation over the pure Pt surface, indicating that CO oxidation might be the rate-limiting step under these conditions.

本文提供了对Pt和PtRu表面CO氧化的计算建模的见解，特别是关注了Ru添加和溶剂效应对水激活和CO氧化的影响。结果显示，Ru的存在降低了水在气相和溶液中的活化能垒，特别倾向于促进异裂途径。这一途径使得表面形成吸附的OH*中间体，然后迁移到溶液中，导致合金表面（Pt66.7%Ru33.3%）上CO氧化的更优热力学特性与纯Pt相比。结果表明，在某些电位下，合金表面的CO氧化比纯Pt表面上的水激活更可能发生，暗示在这些条件下，CO氧化可能是限制步骤。
