Nonlocal gradient corrected DFT slab calculations were carried out to determine the overall reaction energies along with the barriers for the activation of water and the oxidation of CO over well-defined Pt(111) and PtRu(111) surfaces.
The addition of Ru to Pt along with the presence of solution helps to enhance the elementary steps that comprise the bifunctional mechanism.
The activation of water over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is energetically unfavorable with an activation barrier of +142 kJ/mol and overall heat of reaction of +53 kJ/mol. Water will desorb before it will react on Pt(111).
The presence of solution reduces the barrier to about 75 kJ/mol.
The addition of Ru lowers the barrier for water activation in the vapor phase.
Alloying Pt with Ru lowers the barriers for the homolytic as well as the heterolytic activation of water in solution.
The presence of solution, however, markedly favors the heterolytic activation which leads to the formation of an adsorbed OH* surface intermediate, a proton which migrates into solution and an electron.
The energetics for this path over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3%(111) surface were calculated to be quite favorable with an activation barrier of +27 kJ/mol and an overall energy of reaction of +26 kJ/mol.
Ab initio molecular dynamics results indicate that water can be activated over PtRu at 300 K.
The resulting surface Ru-OH group that forms induces the adsorption and subsequent activation of water at a neighboring Pt site.
The barrier for the subsequent oxidation of adsorbed CO by surface OH groups over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is 86 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of 21 kJ/mol.
The barrier is reduced to 71 kJ/mol when carried out over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy in the vapor phase.
The barrier for the homolytic disproportionation of CO and OH in solution (over Pt66.7%Ru33.3%) is 90 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of +24 kJ/mol.
The heterolytic path which involves the oxidation of CO by OH to form CO2+H+(aq)+e is more favorable than the homolytic path.
The activation barrier for the heterolytic path over Pt66.7%Ru33.3% is +60 kJ/mol with an overall reaction of 6 kJ/mol (exothermic).
These results indicate that at potentials which are less than or equal to the potential of zero total charge, water activation over Pt(111) may be difficult.
CO oxidation, however, is more likely limiting over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy at these potentials.
These results only hold for the ideal conditions studied herein including ideal single crystal surfaces, an ideal liquid water solution phase, and the absence of an applied potential.

The DFT calculations revealed that the activation of water on Pt(111) in the vapor phase is energetically unfavorable, requiring an activation barrier of +142 kJ/mol and an overall heat of reaction of +53 kJ/mol. However, in the presence of solution, the barrier for water activation decreases to about 75 kJ/mol. The addition of Ru to the Pt surface significantly lowers the activation barriers for both homolytic and heterolytic water activation, especially favoring the heterolytic pathway. This results in the formation of an adsorbed OH* surface intermediate, a proton migrating into solution, and an electron. Over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy, the overall reaction for CO oxidation is more favorable than water activation over Pt(111), indicating that CO oxidation might be more critical under certain conditions. The heterolytic path for CO oxidation has a lower activation barrier (+60 kJ/mol) and is exothermic, making it more energetically favorable compared to the homolytic path.

在DFT计算中，发现水在Pt(111)表面的气相活化是能量上不利的，需要激活能垒为+142 kJ/mol和总反应热为+53 kJ/mol。然而，在溶液存在的情况下，水活化的壁垒降低到约75 kJ/mol。向Pt表面添加Ru显著降低了水活化过程的激活壁垒，特别是有利于异裂化路径。这导致形成吸附的OH*表面中间体、一个迁移到溶液中的质子和一个电子。在Pt66.7%Ru33.3%合金上，CO氧化的整体反应比Pt(111)上的水活化更有利，表明在某些条件下CO氧化可能是更为关键的过程。异裂化路径的CO氧化激活壁垒为+60 kJ/mol，并且是放热的，使其在能量上比同裂化路径更加有利。
