<p>Thrombin, one of the key pathway proteins in the coagulation cascade, is a serine protease that initiates the physiological formation of fibrin clots and platelet activation but has also been implicated in tumour growth, apoptosis, metastasis, pathological tissue remodelling and severe inflammation [16].</p>
<p>It is generated by the enzymatic cleavage of two sites on prothrombin by activated factor X (FXa).</p>
<p>Free thrombin can covert inactive forms of coagulation factors XI, VIII, and V to their active forms and fibrinogen to fibrin.</p>
<p>In addition, thrombin can promote platelet activation and aggregation by activation of PARs on their surface membrane.</p>
<p>Importantly, after binding to the cell membrane protein thrombomodulin, thrombin can activate protein C.</p>
<p>Activating protein C (APC) is an enzyme that inactivates factors Va and VIIIa and signals through PAR-1 after association with endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR).</p>
<p>Finally, thrombin can cleave members of the complement system, C3 and C5, though the precise biological relevance of these functions is not known.</p>
<p>Thrombin has also been shown to be involved in other experimental models of disease including glomerulonephritis [22] and lung fibrosis [23].</p>
<p>Thrombin has been shown to upregulate the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and other proteins by different cell types.</p>
<p>From human adipocytes, thrombin stimulates secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and vascular endothelial cell growth factor [25].</p>
<p>From urothelial cells, thrombin induces increased release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which can mediate bladder inflammation [26].</p>
<p>There is particular interest in the role that thrombin and other coagulation proteases may play in chronic cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>On endothelial cells, thrombin can initiate the production of a number of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, TGFβ, MCP-1, PDGF, ICAM-1, and P-selectin, mainly through the NF-κB pathway.</p>
<p>These responses by EC to thrombin can be altered by infection. For instance, following human cytomegalovirus infection, thrombin-induced expression of IL-1α and macrophage colony stimulating factor by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was significantly increased, through mechanisms that are incompletely defined, but included increased expression of PAR-3 at the cell surface [30].</p>
<p>With monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages, thrombin enhances adhesiveness and increases production of IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-10, with downregulation of IL-12 secretion. Oncostatin (OSM) is also produced through a signalling pathway involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and AP-1 [32].</p>
<p>At low concentrations, thrombin has anti-inflammatory effects. Incubation of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with thrombin at concentrations of 5075 pM reduced or inhibited LPS-induced permeability changes, neutrophil adhesion, and transendothelial migration and expression of cell adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1), and E-selectin.</p>
<p>All these evidence suggest that targeting coagulation proteases might have therapeutic benefit in inflammatory diseases.</p>
<p>However, only a single phase III trial, using aPC, showed benefit in human sepsis [36] compared to several others with negative results [37, 38].</p>
<p>One explanation for disappointing results with anticoagulants might be because the doses at which they are can be safely used are insufficient to inhibit PAR-mediated signalling [39].</p>
<p>Additionally, anticoagulants may inhibit thrombin-dependent anti-inflammatory signals.</p>
<p>However, newer anticoagulant therapies are now available, including aptamers, direct thrombin inhibitors, and PAR-1 antagonists, and trials of these agents, to limit inflammation, are eagerly awaited.</p>
<p>PAR-1 is coupled to the S1P receptor S1P1. S1P1 signalling is coupled to Gi (the effector is adenylate cyclase, AC) pathway and AKT and RAC 1 activation, which lead to reduce vascular leakage.</p>
<p>Thrombin binds to its cell surface receptor PAR-1, which promotes RhoGEF association with the S1P receptor S1P3. S1P3 signalling is coupled to Gi, Gq/11 (the effector, phospholipase C, PLC) and G12/13 (the effector, RhoA exchange factor) pathways and activates RhoA.</p>
<p>Activated RhoA binds and activates the serine/threonine kinase ROCK, which is involved in the endothelial cell barrier disruption and increases leakage.</p>
<p>Endothelial cells synthesize and display the protein thrombomodulin, which binds thrombin and converts its substrate specificity to cleavage and activation of protein C.</p>
<p>Activating protein C (APC) binds its endothelial cell protein C receptor, which activates PAR-1.</p>
<p>PAR-1 is coupled to the S1P receptor S1P1. S1P1 signalling is coupled to Gi (the effector is adenylate cyclase, AC) pathway and AKT and RAC 1 activation, which lead to reduce vascular leakage.</p>
<p>Thrombin signalling through PAR-1 was necessary to generate local chemokines for leukocyte recruitment.</p>
<p>PAR-1 activation is protective in some situations, such as treatment with PAR-1-activating peptides inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and promoting the release of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in mouse microglial cells in response to LPS stimulation.</p>
<p>However, in other situations, PAR-1 activation is known to be damaging, such as deficiency of PAR-1 reducing brain infarct volume after arterial occlusion.</p>
<p>PAR-1 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease, with PAR-4 overexpression in ulcerative colitis colonic biopsies.</p>
<p>Finally, PAR-4 has been implicated in the in vitro activation of HUVECs by mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), a protease of the complement lectin pathway.</p>
<p>There is synergy between PAR-2 and toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 (the receptor that transduces signals after binding of gram-negative LPS)-mediated NF-κB signalling, for instance to induce cytokine secretion, on a variety of cell types including macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells.</p>
<p>As a further illustration of this concept, activation of PAR-2 by either trypsin or a specific agonist peptide was found to profoundly inhibit the phosphorylation and activity of c-jun N-terminal protein kinase induced by TNF-α in human skin epithelial cells.</p>
<p>The relevance of this is that PAR-2 activation itself leads to phosphorylation and activation of JNK, and this has been described as the basis of pro-inflammatory signalling through PAR-2 in numerous cell types. Hence, PAR-2 acts as either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory, depending on the context and character of additional signals received by cells.</p>

1. Thrombin, a key protein in the coagulation pathway, can activate cellular signaling directly via proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal domain of a family of G protein-coupled receptors or indirectly through the generation of molecules such as activated protein C.
