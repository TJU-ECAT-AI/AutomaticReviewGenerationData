The roles of thrombin and protease-activated receptors in inflammation constitute two host defence systems with complementary physiological roles in limiting tissue damage, restoring homeostasis and eliminating invading pathogens, functions reliant on effective regulation of both processes at a variety of levels. Dysfunctional activation or regulation of either pathway may lead to pathology and contribute to human diseases as diverse as myocardial infarction and septic shock. The serine protease thrombin, a key protein in the coagulation pathway, can activate cellular signalling directly via proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal domain of a family of G protein-coupled receptors or indirectly through the generation of molecules such as activated protein C. These events transmit signals to many cell types and can elicit the production of various pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, thereby influencing cell activation, differentiation, survival and migration.

Role of thrombin in inflammation The model most widely used to study the role of thrombin and other coagulation proteases in inflammation is that of LPS-induced endotoxaemia, where it is clear from small and large animal studies that inhibiting coagulation inhibits inflammation and prevents significant mortality.

There is particular interest in the role that thrombin and other coagulation proteases may play in chronic cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. On endothelial cells, thrombin can initiate the production of a number of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, TGFβ, MCP-1, PDGF, ICAM-1 and P-selectin, mainly through the NF-κB pathway.

Non-thrombin-dependent activation of PAR-1 Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) can cleave the N-terminal domain of PAR-1 at a site distinct from the thrombin cleavage site. This process induces p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and Rho-GTP activation. This thrombin-independent PAR-1 activation is important in platelets, which express several MMPs including MMP-1, -2, -3 and -14, all involved in haemostatic function and platelet survival.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can cleave the N-terminal domain of PAR-1 at a site different from the thrombin cleavage site, leading to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and Rho-GTP activation. This thrombin-independent activation of PAR-1 is crucial for platelets, which express multiple MMPs such as MMP-1, -2, -3, and -14, all involved in hemostasis and platelet survival.

Finally, PAR-4 has been implicated in the in vitro activation of HUVECs by mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), a protease of the complement lectin pathway; this elicits a Ca2+ response and induces NF-κB nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HUVECs. The effect was dependent on the proteolytic activity of MASP-1, the enzyme was able to cleave a synthetic PAR-4 peptide representing the N-terminal sequence of PAR-4, and a PAR-4 agonist peptide induced a Ca2+ response comparable to MASP-1, all of which suggest that this mechanism may be involved in arterial inflammation.

PAR-4 has been associated with the in vitro activation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), a protease of the complement lectin pathway. This leads to a calcium (Ca2+) response and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, as well as the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in HUVECs. The effect was dependent on the proteolytic activity of MASP-1, as it could cleave a synthetic PAR-4 peptide representing the N-terminal sequence of PAR-4, and a PAR-4 agonist peptide induced a Ca2+ response similar to MASP-1, all indicating that this mechanism might be involved in arterial inflammation.

最终，PAR-4已被证明与补体结合途径中的溶血素相关丝氨酸蛋白酶-1（MASP-1）介导的人类脐静脉内皮细胞（HUVECs）的体内激活有关，这是一种补体结合途径中的蛋白酶。这导致钙离子（Ca2+）响应以及核转位NF-κB和p38丝裂原活化蛋白激酶（MAPK）的磷酸化在HUVECs中。该效果依赖于MASP-1的蛋白水解活性，因为它能够切割代表PAR-4 N端序列的合成PAR-4肽，并且一个PAR-4激动剂肽诱导的Ca2+响应类似于MASP-1，所有这些都表明这个机制可能涉及动脉炎症。

In the context of murine sepsis or LPS endotoxaemia, aPC acts to reduce mortality, as illustrated by the fact that mice with a thrombomodulin mutation (TMPro) that prevents effective aPC generation is highly susceptible to LPS-induced death. This susceptibility is reduced whenMeshPro is expressed on a PAR-1/ background, suggesting it is PAR-1 mediated.
