<p>Thrombin, one of the key pathway proteins in the coagulation cascade, is a serine protease that initiates the physiological formation of fibrin clots and platelet activation but has also been implicated in tumour growth, apoptosis, metastasis, pathological tissue remodelling and severe inflammation [16]. It is generated by the enzymatic cleavage of two sites on prothrombin by activated factor X (FXa).</p>
<p>Thrombin has also been shown to be involved in other experimental models of disease including glomerulonephritis [22] and lung fibrosis [23]. In the lung, thrombin mediates expression of mucin, which is sign of airway inflammation and consists of plasma-derived proteins, mucin glycoproteins and cellular debris, and stimulates expression of tissue factor from nasal epithelial cells through PAR-1 activation.</p>
<p>There is particular interest in the role that thrombin and other coagulation proteases may play in chronic cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. On endothelial cells, thrombin can initiate the production of a number of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, TGFβ, MCP-1, PDGF, ICAM-1 and P-selectin, mainly through the NF-κB pathway.</p>
<p>At low concentrations, thrombin has anti-inflammatory effects. Incubation of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with thrombin at concentrations of 5075 pM reduced or inhibited LPS-induced permeability changes, neutrophil adhesion and transendothelial migration and expression of cell adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) and E-selectin.</p>
<p>All these evidence suggest that targeting coagulation proteases might have therapeutic benefit in inflammatory diseases. However, only a single phase III trial, using aPC, showed benefit in human sepsis [36] compared to several others with negative results [37, 38].</p>
<p>Interactions with S1P receptors in endotoxaemia/sepsis Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a lysophospholipid that can transmit signals through S1P receptors (S1P1-5), a family of five G protein-coupled receptors (commonly called S1P1-5) involved in cell differentiation and survival and known to have specific functions in immune cells [40].</p>
<p>In the LPS challenge model, early studies suggested significant redundancy between PAR members by showing that deficiency of any single PAR did not confer a survival advantage or protect against inflammation, whereas simultaneous inhibition of multiple PARs did [21]. However, a recent study using PAR-1-deficient mice demonstrated the importance of PAR-1 in this model [44].</p>
<p>Investigating the cellular mechanisms involved, reconstitution of PAR-1/ mice with wild-type bone marrow (BM) restored the late LPS-induced inflammation in PAR-1/ mice, as did adoptive transfer of wild-type BM-derived dendritic cells (DC) in these and in SphK1/ and S1P3/ mice.</p>
<p>Importance of PAR-1 activation for leukocyte recruitment Besides the amplification role that thrombin/PAR-1 signalling plays in systemic inflammation, our group has been trying to understand whether PAR-1 signalling is required for specific pro-inflammatory functions.</p>
<p>C57BL/6 mice fed with a diet deficient in methionine and choline (MCD diet) demonstrated steatohepatitis characterized by macrovesicular hepatic steatosis, pro-inflammatory gene expression and lobular inflammation, which was reduced in PAR-1/ mice, suggesting that PAR-1 may contribute to the MCD diet-induced hepatic injury and inflammation [59].</p>
<p>Helicobacter pylori infection, which is associated with gastritis, was reduced in PAR-1/ mice and increased in PAR-2/ mice, and also led to the upregulation of PAR-1 expression and downregulation of PAR-2 expression in wild-type primary gastric epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Finally, PAR-4 has been implicated in the in vitro activation of HUVECs by mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), a protease of the complement lectin pathway; this elicits a Ca2+ response and induces NF-κB nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HUVECs.</p>
<p>PAR-2 has been implicated as a pro-inflammatory receptor involved in several diseases including chronic inflammatory arthritis, dermatitis and colitis. On a cellular level, the pro-inflammatory signalling pathways activated by PAR-2 include phospholipase C, PKC, c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, resulting in activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1.</p>

1. Thrombin, a serine protease, plays a role in various diseases including atherosclerosis, by initiating the formation of fibrin clots and stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory mediators like IL-6, IL-8, TGFβ, MCP-1, PDGF, ICAM-1, and P-selectin, mainly through the NF-κB pathway.

2. At low concentrations, thrombin exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, reducing LPS-induced permeability changes, neutrophil adhesion, and expression of cell adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells.

3. Targeting coagulation proteases could potentially offer therapeutic benefits in inflammatory diseases, as evidenced by a single successful phase III trial using activated protein C (aPC) in human sepsis, compared to several unsuccessful trials.

4. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors (S1P1-5) are involved in cell differentiation and survival, and have specific functions in immune cells. They are crucial in modulating inflammation in response to S1P.

5. The role of protease-activated receptors (PARs) in inflammation varies. In a study using PAR-1-deficient mice, it was found that PAR-1 plays a significant role in protecting against lethality and interrupting inflammation in models of sepsis.

6. The importance of PAR-1 activation extends beyond systemic inflammation. It is essential for specific pro-inflammatory functions, as demonstrated in a mouse heart-to-rat transplant model where infiltration of macrophages and NK cells was significantly impaired in the absence of local chemokines.

7. Helicobacter pylori infection, associated with gastritis, was reduced in PAR-1-deficient mice, indicating that PAR-1 may contribute to the infection-induced hepatic injury and inflammation.

8. PAR-4 activation is linked to reduced cerebral infarction volume, blood-brain barrier permeability, and cerebral oedema, suggesting its potential role in neurological disorders.

9. PAR-2 is implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, dermatitis, and colitis. It activates various signaling pathways, including phospholipase C, PKC, JNK, and p38, leading to the activation of transcription factors like NF-κB, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1.

10. The expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 is regulated in response to bacterial infections, with PAR-1 upregulated and PAR-2 downregulated in primary gastric epithelial cells infected with Helicobacter pylori.

11. PAR-4 activation is involved in the in vitro activation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), eliciting a Ca2+ response and inducing NF-κB nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK.

12. PAR-2 acts as a pro-inflammatory receptor in various diseases, activating signaling pathways that lead to the activation of transcription factors and promoting inflammation.
