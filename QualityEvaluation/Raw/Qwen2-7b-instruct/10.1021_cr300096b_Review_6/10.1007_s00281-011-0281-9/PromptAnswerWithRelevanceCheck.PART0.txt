<p>Thrombin, one of the key pathway proteins in the coagulation cascade, is a serine protease that initiates the physiological formation of fibrin clots and platelet activation but has also been implicated in tumour growth, apoptosis, metastasis, pathological tissue remodelling and severe inflammation [16]. It is generated by the enzymatic cleavage of two sites on prothrombin by activated factor X (FXa).</p>
<p>Thrombin has also been shown to be involved in other experimental models of disease including glomerulonephritis [22] and lung fibrosis [23]. In the lung, thrombin mediates expression of mucin, which is sign of airway inflammation and consists of plasma-derived proteins, mucin glycoproteins and cellular debris, and stimulates expression of tissue factor from nasal epithelial cells through PAR-1 activation.</p>
<p>There is particular interest in the role that thrombin and other coagulation proteases may play in chronic cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. On endothelial cells, thrombin can initiate the production of a number of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, TGFβ, MCP-1, PDGF, ICAM-1 and P-selectin, mainly through the NF-κB pathway.</p>
<p>At low concentrations, thrombin has anti-inflammatory effects. Incubation of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with thrombin at concentrations of 5075 pM reduced or inhibited LPS-induced permeability changes, neutrophil adhesion and transendothelial migration and expression of cell adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) and E-selectin.</p>
<p>All these evidence suggest that targeting coagulation proteases might have therapeutic benefit in inflammatory diseases. However, only a single phase III trial, using aPC, showed benefit in human sepsis [36] compared to several others with negative results [37, 38].</p>
<p>Interactions with S1P receptors in endotoxaemia/sepsis Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a lysophospholipid that can transmit signals through S1P receptors (S1P1-5), a family of five G protein-coupled receptors (commonly called S1P1-5) involved in cell differentiation and survival and known to have specific functions in immune cells [40].</p>
<p>In the LPS challenge model, early studies suggested significant redundancy between PAR members by showing that deficiency of any single PAR did not confer a survival advantage or protect against inflammation, whereas simultaneous inhibition of multiple PARs did [21]. However, a recent study using PAR-1-deficient mice demonstrated the importance of PAR-1 in this model [44].</p>
<p>Investigating the cellular mechanisms involved, reconstitution of PAR-1/ mice with wild-type bone marrow (BM) restored the late LPS-induced inflammation in PAR-1/ mice, as did adoptive transfer of wild-type BM-derived dendritic cells (DC) in these and in SphK1/ and S1P3/ mice.</p>
<p>Importance of PAR-1 activation for leukocyte recruitment Besides the amplification role that thrombin/PAR-1 signalling plays in systemic inflammation, our group has been trying to understand whether PAR-1 signalling is required for specific pro-inflammatory functions.</p>
<p>C57BL/6 mice fed with a diet deficient in methionine and choline (MCD diet) demonstrated steatohepatitis characterized by macrovesicular hepatic steatosis, pro-inflammatory gene expression and lobular inflammation, which was reduced in PAR-1/ mice, suggesting that PAR-1 may contribute to the MCD diet-induced hepatic injury and inflammation [59].</p>
<p>Helicobacter pylori infection, which is associated with gastritis, was reduced in PAR-1/ mice and increased in PAR-2/ mice, and also led to the upregulation of PAR-1 expression and downregulation of PAR-2 expression in wild-type primary gastric epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Finally, PAR-4 has been implicated in the in vitro activation of HUVECs by mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), a protease of the complement lectin pathway; this elicits a Ca2+ response and induces NF-κB nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HUVECs.</p>
<p>PAR-2 has been implicated as a pro-inflammatory receptor involved in several diseases including chronic inflammatory arthritis, dermatitis and colitis. On a cellular level, the pro-inflammatory signalling pathways activated by PAR-2 include phospholipase C, PKC, c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, resulting in activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1.</p>

It is essential for specific pro-inflammatory functions, as demonstrated in a mouse heart-to-rat transplant model where infiltration of macrophages and NK cells was significantly impaired in the absence of local chemokines.

7. Helicobacter pylori infection, associated with gastritis, was reduced in PAR-1-deficient mice, indicating that PAR-1 may contribute to the infection-induced hepatic injury and inflammation.

8. PAR-4 activation is linked to reduced cerebral infarction volume, blood-brain barrier permeability, and cerebral oedema, suggesting its potential role in neurological disorders.

9. PAR-2 is implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, dermatitis, and colitis. It activates various signaling pathways, including phospholipase C, PKC, JNK, and p38, leading to the activation of transcription factors like NF-κB, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1.

10. The expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 is regulated in response to bacterial infections, with PAR-1 upregulated and PAR-2 downregulated in primary gastric epithelial cells infected with Helicobacter pylori.

11. PAR-4 activation is involved in the in vitro activation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), eliciting a Ca2+ response and inducing NF-κB nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK.

2. 在其他疾病模型中，如肾小球肾炎 [22] 和肺纤维化 [23]，凝血酶也显示出作用。在肺部，凝血酶调节气道炎症的标志物，即由血浆衍生的蛋白质、粘蛋白糖蛋白和细胞碎片组成的分泌物，并通过激活PAR-1刺激鼻上皮细胞表达组织因子。

3. 在慢性心血管疾病，如动脉粥样硬化中，凝血酶在内皮细胞上可以启动包括IL-6、IL-8、TGFβ、MCP-1、PDGF、ICAM-1和P选择素在内的多种促炎介质的生产，主要通过NF-κB途径。

4. 在低浓度下，凝血酶表现出抗炎作用。将人类肺动脉内皮细胞与浓度为5075 pM的凝血酶孵育可减少或抑制脂多糖诱导的渗透性变化、中性粒细胞黏附和跨内皮迁移以及血管细胞黏附分子（VCAM-1）、细胞间黏附分子（ICAM-1）和选择素E的表达。

8. 除了系统性炎症的作用外，PAR-1信号传导对于特定的促炎功能至关重要，在心肌移植到大鼠模型中，心肌移植后，缺乏局部（供体心脏）化学趋化因子的情况下，心脏的存活时间更长，表明吞噬细胞和NK细胞的浸润显著受损。

9. 在接受缺乏PAR-1的心脏或给予选择性PAR-1拮抗剂的大鼠喂食甲硫氨酸和胆碱缺乏饮食（MCD饮食）的小鼠中，肝脏损伤和炎症减轻，这表明PAR-1可能参与MCD饮食诱导的肝损伤和炎症。

10. 随着幽门螺杆菌感染（与胃炎相关）在缺乏PAR-1的小鼠中减少，并且在PAR-2/小鼠中增加，幽门螺杆菌感染还导致野生型主要胃上皮细胞中PAR-1表达上调和PAR-2表达下调。

<p>Importantly, after binding to the cell membrane protein thrombomodulin, thrombin can activate protein C.</p>
<p>Activating protein C (APC) is an enzyme that inactivates factors Va and VIIIa and signals through PAR-1 after association with endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR).</p>
<p>Finally, thrombin can cleave members of the complement system, C3 and C5, though the precise biological relevance of these functions is not known.</p>
<p>Thrombin has also been shown to be involved in other experimental models of disease including glomerulonephritis [22] and lung fibrosis [23].</p>
<p>Thrombin has been shown to upregulate the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and other proteins by different cell types.</p>
<p>From human adipocytes, thrombin stimulates secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and vascular endothelial cell growth factor [25].</p>
<p>From urothelial cells, thrombin induces increased release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which can mediate bladder inflammation [26].</p>

<p>With monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages, thrombin enhances adhesiveness and increases production of IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-10, with downregulation of IL-12 secretion.

The role of thrombin and protease-activated receptors in inflammation constitutes two host defense systems with complementary physiological roles in limiting tissue damage, restoring homeostasis, and eliminating invading pathogens, functions reliant on effective regulation of both processes at a variety of levels. Dysfunctional activation or regulation of either pathway may lead to pathology and contribute to human diseases as diverse as myocardial infarction and septic shock. The serine protease thrombin, a key protein in the coagulation pathway, can activate cellular signaling directly via proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal domain of a family of G protein-coupled receptors or indirectly through the generation of molecules such as activated protein C. These events transmit signals to many cell types and can elicit the production of various pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, thereby influencing cell activation, differentiation, survival, and migration.

<p>In the LPS challenge model, early studies suggested significant redundancy between PAR members by showing that deficiency of any single PAR did not confer a survival advantage or protect against inflammation, whereas simultaneous inhibition of multiple PARs did [21].</p>
<p>However, a recent study using PAR-1-deficient mice demonstrated the importance of PAR-1 in this model [44].</p>
<p>In addition, although multiplex cytokine profiles remained unaltered in early LPS-induced inflammatory responses in PAR-1/ mice, they were significantly attenuated 18 h after LPS challenge.</p>
<p>The role of S1P signalling in LPS-induced inflammation was demonstrated in mice lacking sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1, the enzyme that phosphorylates sphingosine), which developed attenuated cytokine profiles similar to those seen in PAR-1/ mice.</p>
<p>Investigating the cellular mechanisms involved, reconstitution of PAR-1/ mice with wild-type bone marrow (BM) restored the late LPS-induced inflammation in PAR-1/ mice, as did adoptive transfer of wild-type BM-derived dendritic cells (DC) in these and in SphK1/ and S1P3/ mice.</p>
<p>Thrombin also binds to thrombomodulin following which it is capable of cleaving protein C to generate aPC, a moiety which has pleiotropic effects on coagulation, inflammation, endothelial cells and immune cells [4547].</p>
<p>In the context of murine sepsis or LPS endotoxaemia, aPC acts to reduce mortality, as illustrated by the fact that mice with a thrombomodulin mutation (TMPro) that prevents effective aPC generation is highly susceptible to LPS-induced death.</p>
<p>In complex with endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR), aPC can signal through PAR-1.</p>
<p>EPCR/aPC-PAR-1 signalling in vitro is coupled to S1P1 [42].</p>
<p>In vivo, a selective agonist for S1P1 receptor protected wild-type, PAR-1/, andMeshPro mice from lethal LPS challenge and reversed the vascular leakage induced by low-dose LPS in wild-type mice administered an inhibitory anti-aPC antibody or that seen in EPCRlow and PAR-1/ mice.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that vascular S1P1/S1P3 balance by PAR-1 signalling decides the fate of inflammatory diseases [4850] (see Fig. 2).</p>
<p>Fig. 2 PAR-1-S1P receptor-mediated signalling in the vascular endothelium.</p>
<p>Endothelial cells synthesize and display the protein thrombomodulin, which binds thrombin and converts its substrate specificity to cleavage and activation of protein C.</p>
<p>Activating protein C binds its endothelial cell protein C receptor, which activates PAR-1.</p>
<p>PAR-1 is coupled to the S1P receptor S1P1.</p>
<p>S1P1 signalling is coupled to Gi (the effector is adenylate cyclase, AC) pathway and AKT and RAC 1 activation, which lead to reduce vascular leakage.</p>
<p>Thrombin binds to its cell surface receptor PAR-1, which promotes RhoGEF association with the S1P receptor S1P3.</p>
<p>S1P3 signalling is coupled to Gi, Gq/11 (the effector, phospholipase C, PLC) and G12/13 (the effector, RhoA exchange factor) pathways and activates RhoA.</p>
<p>Activated RhoA binds and activates the serine/threonine kinase ROCK, which is involved in the endothelial cell barrier disruption and increases leakage.</p>
<p>Importance of PAR-1 activation for leukocyte recruitment</p>
<p>Working in a mouse heart-to-rat transplant model, we showed that hearts from MCP-1-deficient mice survived longer than WT and showed reduced infiltration of NK cells and macrophages under conditions where intravascular thrombosis was inhibited by pre-transplant fibrinogen depletion.</p>
<p>Hearts from transgenic mice expressing a tethered hirudin-based fusion protein on endothelial cells showed prolonged survival without NK cell and macrophage infiltration and levels of mouse (donor heart) MCP-1, -3 and -5 circulating in the rat recipients of these hearts were reduced by >90% compared to rats receiving WT hearts, indicating that intravascular thrombin was required to generate donor chemokines.</p>
<p>PAR-1 in the nervous system</p>
<p>PAR-1 is expressed throughout the central nervous system on distinct neuronal populations and widely by glial cells in both animals and humans and has been implicated in the neuronal injury and inflammation in the peripheral nervous system [5254].</p>
<p>The functional effects of PAR-1 in the nervous system are complex.</p>
<p>For example, treatment with PAR-1-activating peptides such as TRAP6 and TFLLR inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and promoted the release of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in mouse microglial cells in response to LPS stimulation.</p>
<p>However, in other situations, PAR-1 activation is known to be damaging.</p>
<p>For instance, deficiency of PAR-1 is known to reduce brain infarct volume after arterial occlusion [56].</p>
<p>PAR-1 in the gastrointestinal system</p>
<p>In mouse caecum, both PAR-1- and PAR-2-activating peptides induced chloride anion (Cl) secretion.</p>
<p>C57BL/6 mice fed with a diet deficient in methionine and choline (MCD diet) demonstrated steatohepatitis characterized by macrovesicular hepatic steatosis, pro-inflammatory gene expression and lobular inflammation, which was reduced in PAR-1/ mice, suggesting that PAR-1 may contribute to the MCD diet-induced hepatic injury and inflammation [59].</p>
<p>Helicobacter pylori infection, which is associated with gastritis, was reduced in PAR-1/ mice and increased in PAR-2/ mice, and also led to the upregulation of PAR-1 expression and downregulation of PAR-2 expression in wild-type primary gastric epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Stimulation of primary gastric epithelial cells from PAR-1/ mice by H. pylori resulted in the increased levels of NF-κB and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, suggesting that PAR-1 protects mice from H. pylori-induced gastritis possibly through inhibition of MIP-2 production [60].</p>
<p>Non-thrombin-dependent activation of PAR-1</p>
<p>Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) can cleave the N-terminal domain of PAR-1 at a site distinct from the thrombin cleavage site.</p>
<p>This process induces p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and Rho-GTP activation.</p>
<p>This thrombin-independent PAR-1 activation is important in platelets, which express several MMPs including MMP-1, -2, -3 and -14, all involved in haemostatic function and platelet survival [6163].</p>
<p>Exposure of platelets to collagen results in the generation of active MMP-1 from the surface-bound pro-MMP-1 zymogen, which elicits platelet shape change, calcium mobilization and aggregation through PAR-1.</p>
<p>Blockade of MMP-1PAR-1 significantly inhibits early thrombogenesis under arterial flow conditions, clot formation and retraction as well as providing protection against collagen-dependent platelet activation and thrombosis in animals [64].</p>
<p>MMP cleavage of PAR has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of degenerative brain diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's via α-synuclein, a major protein component of Lewy bodies (the abnormal aggregates found in neurones in these diseases).</p>
<p>α-Synuclein has been shown to induce production of NO, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β in primary rat microglia through NF-κB, AP-1 and MAPK signalling.</p>
<p>The effect is inhibited by antagonising PAR-1.</p>
<p>MMPs -1, -3, -8 and -9 were also induced, and specific inhibitors of these suppressed the pro-inflammatory effects of α-synuclein.</p>
<p>These data suggest that PAR-1 activation by MMPs secreted from α-synuclein-stimulated microglia led to the microglial inflammation in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner [65].</p>
<p>PAR-4</p>
<p>A study examining the role of PAR-4 in a mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model showed that cerebral infarction volume, bloodbrain barrier permeability and cerebral oedema were significantly reduced in PAR-4/ mice compared with wild-type mice.</p>
<p>PAR-4/ mice also showed improved neurologic and motor functions, associated with inhibition of rolling and adhesion of platelets and leukocytes following MCAO, suggesting that the pathological effects of PAR-4 may be related to platelet activation and arterial inflammation [66].</p>
<p>PAR-4 is also expressed in the knee joint and in sensory neurons from the joint.</p>
<p>PAR-4-activating peptide increased joint afferent firing during non-noxious and noxious rotation of the knee, which was inhibited by a PAR-4 antagonist.</p>
<p>A bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, but not the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 antagonist, also blocked this increase in firing rate, suggesting that PAR-4-mediated sensitization is dependent on B2 receptor activation [67].</p>
<p>PAR-4 has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
<p>PAR-4 was found to be overexpressed in ulcerative colitis (UC) colonic biopsies.</p>
<p> Faecal supernatants from UC bowels applied to mouse colons induced colonic paracellular permeability and systemic inflammation, and these effects can be blocked by a PAR-4 antagonist.</p>
<p>They were also blocked by a cathepsin G inhibitor, implicating this as a potential activator of PAR-4 in this model [68].</p>
<p>Finally, PAR-4 has been implicated in the in vitro activation of HUVECs by mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), a protease of the complement lectin pathway; this elicits a Ca2+ response and induces NF-κB nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HUVECs.</p>
<p>The effect was dependent on the proteolytic activity of MASP-1, the enzyme was able to cleave a synthetic PAR-4 peptide representing the N-terminal sequence of PAR-4, and a PAR-4 agonist peptide induced a Ca2+ response comparable to MASP-1, all of which suggest that this mechanism may be involved in arterial inflammation [69].</p>
<p>PAR-2</p>
<p>PAR-2 has been implicated as a pro-inflammatory receptor involved in several diseases including chronic inflammatory arthritis, dermatitis and colitis.</p>
<p>On a cellular level, the pro-inflammatory signalling pathways activated by PAR-2 include phospholipase C, PKC, c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, resulting in activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1.</p>
<p>Very recently, cut homeobox, a transcription factor present in all metazoans, has been shown to be involved in PAR-2 signalling, specifically in the induction of expression of IL-1α, MMP-10, and cyclo-oxygenase-2 by epithelial cells and fibroblasts [70].</p>
<p>There is synergy between PAR-2 and toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 (the receptor that transduces signals after binding of gram-negative LPS)-mediated NF-κB signalling, for instance to induce cytokine secretion, on a variety of cell types including macrophages, neutrophils and epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly therefore, PAR-2 has also been implicated in the pathology of LPS-induced endotoxaemia, particularly in the renal manifestations, which characteristically in rodents included glomerular thrombosis and acute renal failure.</p>
<p>In this model, a PAR-2-blocking peptide inhibits TNF-α production and reduces fibrin deposition and glomerular thrombosis in rat kidneys, suggesting an important role for PAR-2 in LPS-induced renal inflammation and thrombosis [71].</p>
<p>However, markers of renal function such as creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were not altered, suggesting that other PAR-2-independent mechanisms were operational.</p>
<p>In macrophages, the basis of the synergy between PAR-2 and TLR-4 is a physical association between the two receptors on the cell membrane, as revealed by immunoprecipitation studies [72].</p>
<p>The potential relevance of this was illustrated by the reduced responses of macrophages from TLR-4-deficient mice to a PAR-2 agonist peptide and the failure of a PAR-2 agonist peptide to induce footpad swelling in TLR-4-deficient mice compared to WT mice [73], suggesting that TLR-4 activation was necessary for the pro-inflammatory effects of PAR-2 activation in this model.</p>
<p>Macrophages from PAR-2-deficient mice make an altered response to LPS, with reduced IL-10 secretion but enhanced CXCL1 secretion, skewing the responses to a pro-inflammatory pattern [73].</p>
<p>In WT cells, PAR-2 activation enhanced IL-10, IL-4 and IL-13 secretion and suppressed expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12, therefore dampening the pro-inflammatory consequences of TLR-4 signalling.</p>
<p>In addition, PAR-2 promoted the expression of markers of alternatively activated macrophages (arginase-1 and mannose receptor).</p>
<p>Thus, PAR-2 serves as a way to regulate the character of the cellular response to innate activation.</p>
<p>As a further illustration of this concept, activation of PAR-2 by either trypsin or a specific agonist peptide was found to profoundly inhibit the phosphorylation and activity of c-jun N-terminal protein kinase induced by TNF-α in human skin epithelial cells.</p>
<p>This inhibition was PAR-2 specific and was reversed by PAR-2 antagonist and Gq/11 inhibitor.</p>
<p>The basis was found to be a disruption of TNF receptor 1 binding to receptor interacting protein and TNF receptor-activated death domain, via a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism [74].</p>
<p>The relevance of this is that PAR-2 activation itself leads to phosphorylation and activation of JNK, and this has been described as the basis of pro-inflammatory signalling through PAR-2 in numerous cell types.</p>
<p>Hence, PAR-2 acts as either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory, depending on the context and character of additional signals received by cells.</p>
<p>In this case, since TNF-α activation upregulates cell surface expression of PAR-2, this is an example of a negative feedback system to promote cell homeostasis.</p>
<p>Another example of the protective effect of PAR-2 activation was demonstrated by the recent finding of two novel PAR-2 activators, αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin.</p>
<p>These are small proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>Both have been shown to interact specifically with PAR-2, but not PAR-1,-3 or -4.</p>
<p>In vitro, activation of PAR-2 and increased expression of these proteins protected astrocytes from C2-ceramide- and staurosporine-induced cell death, suggesting that both PAR-2 and α-crystallin may be involved in cytoprotection of astrocytes [75].</p>
<p>The authors of this study suggested that PAR-2 activation by these proteins might be an important mechanism for protecting the brain against damage in chronic degenerative conditions.</p>

The roles of thrombin and protease-activated receptors in inflammation constitute two host defence systems with complementary physiological roles in limiting tissue damage, restoring homeostasis and eliminating invading pathogens, functions reliant on effective regulation of both processes at a variety of levels. Dysfunctional activation or regulation of either pathway may lead to pathology and contribute to human diseases as diverse as myocardial infarction and septic shock. The serine protease thrombin, a key protein in the coagulation pathway, can activate cellular signalling directly via proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal domain of a family of G protein-coupled receptors or indirectly through the generation of molecules such as activated protein C. These events transmit signals to many cell types and can elicit the production of various pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, thereby influencing cell activation, differentiation, survival and migration.
