[1] "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases."
[2] "Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.20.3 ML/min."
[3] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements."
[4] "The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Fe on Pt(111)."
[5] "Each of these metals was deposited at 300 K."
[6] "The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition."
[7] "In summary, 3d-Pt-Pt(111), or the surface configuration, is representative of 1 ML of the 3d metal on Pt(111) and was prepared by depositing 1 ML at 300 K."
[8] "Based on literature results and as confirmed by AES measurements, the Cu/Pt(111) surfaces prepared at 600 K in the current study should have a Cu50Pt50 stoichiometry and be confined to the first two atomic layers."
[9] "These results support the conclusions of Hwu et al. that cyclohexene is strongly bonded to Pt(111) and Ni(111) and more weakly bonded to Pt-Ni-Pt(111)."
[10] "The activities in Table 2 are quantified by TPD peak area ratios in conjunction with the following net reactions occurring on these surfaces:"
[11] "Unfortunately, activity toward the decomposition pathway cannot be quantified using hydrogen peak areas because the hydrogen evolved from the surface originates both from the dehydrogenation reactions and from the pre-adsorbed hydrogen."
[12] "It is important to note that contributions from the cracking patterns of cyclohexene are subtracted during quantification of these activities."
[13] "The data points in Fig. 10 also include the binding energy and hydrogenation activity from a monolayer of Pt on a W(110) substrate, as reported previously."
[14] "Furthermore, a volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."
[15] "This can be explained by the relatively weaker binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the subsurface structures."
[16] "The Cu/Pt(111) surfaces did not follow the trends of the other 3d/Pt(111) surfaces in either the DFT modeling or TPD experiments, which can be partially explained by activation of H2 dissociation on the Cu surfaces."

The AES technique was utilized to characterize the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES peak-to-peak ratio helped determine the quantity of 3d metal deposited, confirming the formation of a monolayer on Pt(111). AES measurements also quantified the deposition and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on Pt(111) surfaces. The surfaces were heated to high temperatures, and AES scans were conducted post-cooling to assess changes in the surface composition. The AES quantification of Fe and Cu deposition demonstrated a gradual diffusion into the subsurface region between 300 and 850 K, and a similar diffusion was observed for Cu at temperatures above 550 K. The AES technique, therefore, played a crucial role in verifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. 

The AES measurements were in accordance with literature results and confirmed the Cu/Pt(111) surfaces prepared at 600 K had a Cu50Pt50 stoichiometry and were confined to the first two atomic layers. The AES quantification of Fe and Cu deposition was consistent with DFT predictions, indicating the AES technique could reliably predict the surface composition of these bimetallic systems. AES scans also helped in understanding the kinetics of surface segregation and activation barriers associated with the deposition of 3d metals on Pt(111) surfaces. 

The AES technique, in conjunction with DFT predictions, enabled a detailed understanding of the surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, contributing to the overall conclusion of the study. The AES measurements provided quantitative insights into the surface composition and dynamics of these systems, facilitating comparisons with theoretical predictions and enhancing the understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the formation of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic structures.

AES技术被用于表征Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的3d原子（Ni和Co）表面分层。AES峰-峰比帮助确定了3d金属沉积的数量，证实了在Pt(111)上形成单层。AES测量还量化了Fe和Cu在Pt(111)表面的沉积，并确认形成了单层。AES扫描后对表面进行加热，以评估高温下的表面组成变化。Fe和Cu沉积的AES量测显示，在300至850 K之间逐渐扩散到亚表面区域，而Cu在550 K以上的温度下表现出类似的扩散行为。因此，AES技术在验证Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的3d原子表面分层方面发挥了关键作用。

AES测量与文献结果一致，并证实了在600 K下制备的Cu/Pt(111)表面具有Cu50Pt50组成，并被限制在前两层原子中。Fe和Cu沉积的AES量测与理论预测一致，表明AES技术可以可靠地预测这些双金属系统的表面组成。AES扫描也有助于理解3d金属在Pt(111)表面上沉积的动力学和激活壁垒。

AES技术和DFT预测相结合，为了解Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的表面分层提供了详细理解。AES测量提供了这些系统表面组成和动态的定量见解，促进了与理论预测的比较，并增强了对形成Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属结构的基本机制的理解。
