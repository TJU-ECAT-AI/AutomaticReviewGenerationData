[1] "The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow us to establish a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "This can be explained by the relatively weaker binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the subsurface structures."
[3] "The behavior of the Cu/Pt(111) surfaces appears to be different from that of the other 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. H2 desorbed from thick Cu at similar temperatures as Pt(111), but the peak was quite small, likely due to the activation of hydrogen adsorption on surface Cu atoms [42]."
[4] "As summarized in Fig. 6 , the surfaces with the lowest HBE were Pt-Co-Pt(111), with a desorption temperature of 150 K, and Pt-Ni-Pt(111), with a desorption temperature of 174 K. In comparison, Ni-Pt-Pt(111), Fe-Pt-Pt(111), and Co-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces have hydrogen desorption temperatures of 355 K, 327 K, and 316 K, respectively."
[5] "Similar to the trend between the subsurface and surface Ni/Pt(111) structures, our DFT results predicted that the binding energy of cyclohexene follows the trend of Pt-Fe-Pt(111) < Pt(111) < Fe-Pt-Pt(111)."

1. Experimental techniques like HREELS and AES verify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by quantifying the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. These measurements compare favorably with DFT predictions, confirming the theoretical models of surface modification.
2. The activation barriers for hydrogen adsorption on Cu surfaces are higher than those on other 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, explaining why hydrogen desorption from Cu surfaces occurs at similar temperatures as from Pt(111), leading to a smaller peak.
3. The volcano-type relationship between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy on the 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is established, indicating that surfaces with intermediate cyclohexene binding energies exhibit the highest hydrogenation activity.

1. 实验技术如HREELS和AES通过量化表面富集的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的扩散动力学和活化能垒，验证了Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的氧诱导表面富集现象。这些测量结果与第一性原理预测相符，验证了表面改性的理论模型。
2. Cu表面氢吸附的激活能比其他3d/Pt(111)表面高，这解释了从Cu表面脱氢时出现的峰大小较小的原因，因为脱氢发生在与Pt(111)相似的温度下。
3. 在3d/Pt(111)双金属表面上，氢化活性与环己烯结合能之间存在火山型关系，表明具有中间环己烯结合能的表面表现出最高的氢化活性。
