[1] "In the present work, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene."
[2] "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases."
[3] "Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.20.3 ML/min. Assuming a layer-by-layer growth mode, we would have expected to see clear breaks in the AES peak-to-peak heights of the Pt and 3d signals as a function of deposition time at the ML coverage."
[4] "Fig. 1 displays the change in the Pt and Fe AES intensities, along with the ratio of the Fe to Pt intensities, as a function of time at an approximately constant deposition rate. A break in the Fe and Pt intensities at around 300 s is indicative of deposition of the first ML of Fe, at an Fe/Pt AES ratio of 1.6."
[5] "The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition."
[6] "The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case."
[7] "The hydrogen adsorption on the different 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces appears to be different from that of the other 3d metals. H2 desorbed from thick Cu at similar temperatures as Pt(111), but the peak was quite small, likely due to the activation of hydrogen adsorption on surface Cu atoms."
[8] "In this case, the activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) is calculated. The activity for cyclohexane formation is determined in exactly the same way, but using cyclohexane peak area ratios."
[9] "Furthermore, a volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."
[10] "The Cu/Pt(111) surfaces did not follow the trends of the other 3d/Pt(111) surfaces in either the DFT modeling or TPD experiments, which can be partially explained by activation of H2 dissociation on the Cu surfaces."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measurements, which display changes in the Pt and Fe AES intensities along with the ratio of Fe to Pt intensities, were conducted as a function of time at an approximately constant deposition rate. The AES data revealed that the deposition of the first ML of Fe, at an Fe/Pt AES ratio of 1.6, was evident at around 300 seconds. AES scans were also performed after heating the surfaces to determine changes in the surface composition. The AES technique enabled the characterization of the surface composition and the verification of the deposition process. 

The DFT predictions for the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems were compared with the measured data obtained from AES. The AES data, along with the DFT predictions, provided insights into the surface segregation kinetics and activation barriers of the subsurface 3d atoms. The AES results showed the expected breaks in the AES peak-to-peak heights of the Pt and 3d signals as a function of deposition time at the ML coverage, indicating the formation of the first monolayer of the 3d metal.

The AES data was used to quantify the activity of the different 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces in terms of the formation of benzene and cyclohexane. The activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) surfaces was calculated based on the TPD peak area ratios. Similarly, the activity for cyclohexane formation was determined using cyclohexane peak area ratios. The AES data, along with the DFT predictions, demonstrated a volcano-type relationship between the hydrogenation activity and the binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surfaces exhibiting the highest activity. The Cu/Pt(111) surfaces did not follow the trends observed in the DFT modeling or TPD experiments, suggesting activation of hydrogen dissociation on the Cu surfaces.

实验技术如HREELS和AES被用来验证并量化氧诱导的表面相分离在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）。AES测量显示了在大约恒定沉积速率下随时间变化的Pt和Fe AES强度，以及Fe与Pt强度的比例。AES数据表明，在大约300秒时，Fe的沉积，其Fe/Pt AES比为1.6，是明显的。对加热后的表面进行了AES扫描，以确定表面组成的变化。AES技术使我们能够表征表面组成，并进行沉积过程的验证。

通过将AES预测的相分离动力学和激活壁垒与Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的实验数据进行比较，得出了关于3d原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中相分离动力学和激活壁垒的见解。AES数据与DFT预测相结合，提供了相分离动力学和激活壁垒的信息。

AES数据用于量化不同3d/Pt(111)双金属表面的活性，包括苯的形成和环己烷的形成。根据TPD峰面积比计算了苯在Pt-3d-Pt(111)表面的活性。同样地，根据环己烷峰面积比确定了环己烷的形成。AES数据与DFT预测相结合，揭示了氢化活性与环己烯结合能之间的火山型关系，其中Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面的活性最高。Cu/Pt(111)表面没有遵循在DFT模拟或TPD实验中观察到的趋势，这可能部分解释了氢解离在Cu表面的激活。
