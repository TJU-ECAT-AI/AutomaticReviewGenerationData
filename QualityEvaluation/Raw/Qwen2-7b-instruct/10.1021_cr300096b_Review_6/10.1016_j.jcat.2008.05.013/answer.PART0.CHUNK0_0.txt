[1] "In the current study, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene."
[2] "The surfaces were then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."
[3] "Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 also show the thermal behavior of 1 ML of Fe and Cu on Pt(111). Each of these metals was deposited at 300 K. The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition."
[4] "Fig. 4 shows that the HBE values were predicted to increase as the d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level, in agreement with trends for other surfaces noted in previous studies [13] ,[28] ,[42] ."
[5] "Consistent with the DFT predictions, the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures had lower desorption temperatures compared with the corresponding parent metals. The surface 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structures promoted a stronger metalhydrogen bond, as indicated by higher desorption temperatures than seen for the corresponding parent metals."
[6] "In this case, the activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) is calculated. The activity for cyclohexane formation is determined in exactly the same way, but using cyclohexane peak area ratios."
[7] "Furthermore, a volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."

1. The current study utilized DFT modeling and surface science experiments to investigate the impact of bimetallic formation on the adsorption of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene.

2. The researchers modified the Pt(111) surface by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. They achieved this by wrapping a wire of the desired 3d metal around a tungsten wire, forming a filament enclosed in a stainless steel shield to guide the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface upon heating.

3. Figures 1 and 2 depict the thermal behavior of iron and copper on the Pt(111) surface. These metals were deposited at 300 K, then heated at 3 K/s to higher temperatures. AES scans were conducted after cooling the surfaces to below 500 K to assess changes in their composition.

4. Figure 4 reveals that as the d-band center approaches the Fermi level, the HBE values increase, aligning with previous studies' trends [13], [28], [42].

5. The DFT predictions were corroborated by experimental observations. Subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures exhibited lower desorption temperatures compared to their parent metals, while surface 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structures facilitated a stronger metal-hydrogen bond, evident through higher desorption temperatures.

6. The activity towards benzene formation on Pt-3d-Pt(111) surfaces was quantified using the TPD peak area ratios. Similarly, the activity for cyclohexane formation was determined using cyclohexane peak area ratios.

7. A volcano-shaped relationship was identified between hydrogenation activity and the binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) showing the highest activity.

1. 当前研究通过密度泛函理论（DFT）建模和表面科学实验，探讨了双金属形成对原子氢和环己烯吸附以及低温环己烯氢化的影响。

2. 研究者通过物理气相沉积法在Pt(111)表面上修改3d金属。他们将所需3d金属的细丝缠绕在直径为0.5毫米的钨丝上，形成一束包裹在不锈钢外壳中的细丝，用于在加热至直流电源供电时将3d金属蒸气引导至Pt(111)表面。

3. 图1和图2展示了铁和铜在Pt(111)表面的热行为。这些金属在300 K下沉积，然后以3 K/s的速度加热到更高的温度。在将表面冷却至低于500 K后，进行AES扫描以评估其成分的变化。

4. 图4显示，随着d带中心接近费米能级，HBE值增加，与先前研究的趋势[13]、[28]、[42]相符。

5. DFT预测得到了实验结果的支持。亚表面Pt-3d-Pt(111)结构的脱附温度较低，而与它们对应的母金属相比，表面3d-Pt-Pt(111)结构促进了更强的金属-氢键，这从更高的脱附温度中可以观察到。

6. 通过TD谱图峰值面积比量化了Pt-3d-Pt(111)表面苯的形成活动。同样地，通过环己烷峰值面积比确定了环己烷形成的活性。
