[1] "In the current study, a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and surface science experiments was used to study the effects of bimetallic formation on the binding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene."
[2] "The surfaces were then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."
[3] "Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 also show the thermal behavior of 1 ML of Fe and Cu on Pt(111). Each of these metals was deposited at 300 K. The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition."
[4] "Fig. 4 shows that the HBE values were predicted to increase as the d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level, in agreement with trends for other surfaces noted in previous studies [13] ,[28] ,[42] ."
[5] "Consistent with the DFT predictions, the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures had lower desorption temperatures compared with the corresponding parent metals. The surface 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structures promoted a stronger metalhydrogen bond, as indicated by higher desorption temperatures than seen for the corresponding parent metals."
[6] "In this case, the activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) is calculated. The activity for cyclohexane formation is determined in exactly the same way, but using cyclohexane peak area ratios."
[7] "Furthermore, a volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."

1. The current study utilized DFT modeling and surface science experiments to investigate the impact of bimetallic formation on the adsorption of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, as well as the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene.

2. The researchers modified the Pt(111) surface by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. They achieved this by wrapping a wire of the desired 3d metal around a tungsten wire, forming a filament enclosed in a stainless steel shield to guide the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface upon heating.

3. Figures 1 and 2 depict the thermal behavior of iron and copper on the Pt(111) surface. These metals were deposited at 300 K, then heated at 3 K/s to higher temperatures. AES scans were conducted after cooling the surfaces to below 500 K to assess changes in their composition.

4. Figure 4 reveals that as the d-band center approaches the Fermi level, the HBE values increase, aligning with previous studies' trends [13], [28], [42].

5. The DFT predictions were corroborated by experimental observations. Subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures exhibited lower desorption temperatures compared to their parent metals, while surface 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structures facilitated a stronger metal-hydrogen bond, evident through higher desorption temperatures.

6. The activity towards benzene formation on Pt-3d-Pt(111) surfaces was quantified using the TPD peak area ratios. Similarly, the activity for cyclohexane formation was determined using cyclohexane peak area ratios.

7. A volcano-shaped relationship was identified between hydrogenation activity and the binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) showing the highest activity.

[1] "The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow us to establish a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "This can be explained by the relatively weaker binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the subsurface structures."
[3] "The behavior of the Cu/Pt(111) surfaces appears to be different from that of the other 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. H2 desorbed from thick Cu at similar temperatures as Pt(111), but the peak was quite small, likely due to the activation of hydrogen adsorption on surface Cu atoms [42]."
[4] "As summarized in Fig. 6 , the surfaces with the lowest HBE were Pt-Co-Pt(111), with a desorption temperature of 150 K, and Pt-Ni-Pt(111), with a desorption temperature of 174 K. In comparison, Ni-Pt-Pt(111), Fe-Pt-Pt(111), and Co-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces have hydrogen desorption temperatures of 355 K, 327 K, and 316 K, respectively."
[5] "Similar to the trend between the subsurface and surface Ni/Pt(111) structures, our DFT results predicted that the binding energy of cyclohexene follows the trend of Pt-Fe-Pt(111) < Pt(111) < Fe-Pt-Pt(111)."

Experimental techniques like HREELS and AES verify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by quantifying the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. These measurements compare favorably with DFT predictions, confirming the theoretical models of surface modification.
2. The activation barriers for hydrogen adsorption on Cu surfaces are higher than those on other 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, explaining why hydrogen desorption from Cu surfaces occurs at similar temperatures as from Pt(111), leading to a smaller peak.

The AES technique was utilized to characterize the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES peak-to-peak ratio helped determine the quantity of 3d metal deposited, confirming the formation of a monolayer on Pt(111). AES measurements also quantified the deposition and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on Pt(111) surfaces. The surfaces were heated to high temperatures, and AES scans were conducted post-cooling to assess changes in the surface composition. The AES quantification of Fe and Cu deposition demonstrated a gradual diffusion into the subsurface region between 300 and 850 K, and a similar diffusion was observed for Cu at temperatures above 550 K. The AES technique, therefore, played a crucial role in verifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. 

The AES measurements were in accordance with literature results and confirmed the Cu/Pt(111) surfaces prepared at 600 K had a Cu50Pt50 stoichiometry and were confined to the first two atomic layers. The AES quantification of Fe and Cu deposition was consistent with DFT predictions, indicating the AES technique could reliably predict the surface composition of these bimetallic systems. AES scans also helped in understanding the kinetics of surface segregation and activation barriers associated with the deposition of 3d metals on Pt(111) surfaces. 

The AES technique, in conjunction with DFT predictions, enabled a detailed understanding of the surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, contributing to the overall conclusion of the study. The AES measurements provided quantitative insights into the surface composition and dynamics of these systems, facilitating comparisons with theoretical predictions and enhancing the understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the formation of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic structures.

AES measurements, which display changes in the Pt and Fe AES intensities along with the ratio of Fe to Pt intensities, were conducted as a function of time at an approximately constant deposition rate.

The AES technique enabled the characterization of the surface composition and the verification of the deposition process. 

The DFT predictions for the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems were compared with the measured data obtained from AES. The AES data, along with the DFT predictions, provided insights into the surface segregation kinetics and activation barriers of the subsurface 3d atoms. The AES results showed the expected breaks in the AES peak-to-peak heights of the Pt and 3d signals as a function of deposition time at the ML coverage, indicating the formation of the first monolayer of the 3d metal.

The AES data was used to quantify the activity of the different 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces in terms of the formation of benzene and cyclohexane. The activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) surfaces was calculated based on the TPD peak area ratios. Similarly, the activity for cyclohexane formation was determined using cyclohexane peak area ratios. The AES data, along with the DFT predictions, demonstrated a volcano-type relationship between the hydrogenation activity and the binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surfaces exhibiting the highest activity.
