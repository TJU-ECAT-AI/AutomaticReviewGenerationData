[1] "The combined experimental results and DFT modeling allow us to establish a volcano-type relationship between the binding energies and hydrogenation activities among the various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "In addition, the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, which is often referred to as the ligand effect."
[3] "The anomalous behavior of Cu/Pt(111) surfaces is further evidenced by the fact that dissociative adsorption of hydrogen is reported to be activated on Cu(111) and on the surface Cu sites of the Cu/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."
[4] "The activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) is calculated."
[5] "Because these surfaces have been found to be thermodynamically stable under vacuum and in the presence of hydrogen, the results of the current study should be directly applicable to more realistic catalytic hydrogenation conditions."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES confirm the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS verifies the bonding orientation of cyclohexene and its intermediates, showing that cyclohexene is strongly bonded to Pt(111) and Ni(111), while weakly bonded to Pt-Ni-Pt(111). AES quantifies the oxygen-induced segregation kinetics and activation barriers, aligning with DFT predictions for these systems.
