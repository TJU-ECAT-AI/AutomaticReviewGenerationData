1. "In recent years, the development of cleaner burning fuels has been of very high priority. The trend towards improvement of air quality by reducing levels of tropospheric ozone, NOx and particulate matter has resulted in the proposal of stringent specifications on the aromatic and sulphur contents of gasoline and diesel fuel."
2. "World Wide Fuel Charter and European automobile manufactures association (ACEA) [2] have proposed slightly different requirements from those expected by Auto Oil [3] and Comitee European de Normalisation (CEN) [4] , but the direction is the same."
3. "However, because noble metal catalysts are easily poisoned by small amounts of sulphur, the hydrodesulfurisation catalyst in the first stage reactor reduces the level of sulphur upto a few ppm."
4. "For example MAKFining dearomatisation technology (HDAr technology) is a two-step aromatics saturation process. Feedstock with sulphur levels upto 250 ppm can be treated with KF-200 catalyst in the HDAr section."
5. "It was found that nickel oxide is better dispersed on the binary support than on SiO2."
6. "Toluene conversion, as a function of reaction temperature up to 200 C over silica and silica-titania-supported nickel, platinum and bimetallic Ni-Pt catalysts is shown in Fig. 5."
7. "Catalysts supported on TiO2-SiO2 show considerably higher catalytic activity in the toluene hydrogenation than those supported on SiO2."
8. "Bimetallic Ni-Pt catalysts containing ca. 0.5 wt.% Pt are more active than related monometallic platinum catalysts, containing comparable amount of platinum."

1. The development of cleaner burning fuels has become a top priority due to efforts to improve air quality by reducing tropospheric ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter levels. This has led to strict regulations on gasoline and diesel fuel aromatic and sulfur content.

2. Different organizations like World Wide Fuel Charter, European automobile manufacturers association (ACEA), Auto Oil, and Comitee European de Normalisation (CEN) have proposed varying specifications for sulfur content, but they share a common goal.

3. Noble metal catalysts are prone to poisoning by small amounts of sulfur, necessitating the use of hydrodesulfurization catalysts in the first stage of the process.

4. MAKFining's HDAr technology involves a two-step process for aromatics saturation, capable of treating feedstock with sulfur levels up to 250 ppm.

5. Nickel oxide is better dispersed on binary supports compared to silica.

6. Figure 5 illustrates the conversion of toluene as a function of temperature when processed through silica, silica-titania-supported nickel, platinum, and bimetallic Ni-Pt catalysts.

7. Catalysts supported on TiO2-SiO2 exhibit significantly higher catalytic activity in toluene hydrogenation compared to those supported on silica.

8. Bimetallic Ni-Pt catalysts with approximately 0.5 wt.% Pt demonstrate greater activity than equivalent monometallic platinum catalysts with similar platinum content.

1. 清洁燃烧燃料的发展已成为非常高的优先事项，由于改善空气质量的努力减少了对流层臭氧、氮氧化物（NOx）和颗粒物水平。这导致汽油和柴油燃料的芳烃和硫含量有了严格规定。

2. 不同组织如世界燃料委员会、欧洲汽车制造商协会（ACEA）、Auto Oil和欧洲标准化委员会（CEN）提出了不同的硫含量规定，但它们有共同的目标。

3. 稀土金属催化剂容易被少量硫毒化，因此需要在第一阶段反应器中使用脱硫催化剂将硫含量降至几ppm。

4. MAKFining的HDAr技术涉及一个两步过程来饱和芳烃，能够处理硫含量高达250 ppm的原料。

5. 镍氧化物在二元支撑上的分散性比在硅胶上要好。

6. 图5展示了当通过硅胶、硅酸盐钛酸盐支持的镍、铂和双金属Ni-Pt催化剂时，随着温度升高，对甲苯的转化率。

7. 与硅胶相比，TiO2-SiO2支持的催化剂在甲苯氢化反应中的催化活性显著更高。

8. 含约0.5 wt.% Pt的双金属Ni-Pt催化剂比等量铂含量的单金属铂催化剂表现出更高的活性。
