   "In recent years, the development of cleaner burning fuels has been of very high priority."
   "The trend towards improvement of air quality by reducing levels of tropospheric ozone, NOx and particulate matter has resulted in the proposal of stringent specifications on the aromatic and sulphur contents of gasoline and diesel fuel."
   "Applying only hydrorefining catalysts (CoMo, NiMo, NiW on Al2O3), the product quality is very dependent on the operating conditions and feedstock."
   "However, because aromatic hydrogenation is an exothermic reaction, there are thermodynamic equilibrium limitations at high temperature operation."
   "Therefore sophisticated processes, technologies and catalysts will be needed to meet these specifications."

   "A support containing 25 wt.% of TiO2 was prepared by deposition of TiO2 on surface of silica."
   "SiO2 (Aldrich, SBET = 370 m2/g, grain size of 0.05 mm) was added to titanium(IV)isopropoxide dissolved in isopropyl alcohol."
   "The sol was gelated at room temperature."
   "Next, the samples were placed in a dryer and heated up at stepwise increased temperature: 30 C, 0.5 h; 50 C, 0.5 h; 70 C, 0.5 h; 90 C, 0.5 h; 110 C, 12 h."
   "Metals were deposited on the supports before the forming process."
   "Bimetallic Ni-Pt catalysts were performed by two-step impregnation, the Pt precursor being impregnated as a second one."
   "After impregnation catalysts were peptised with 3% nitric acid and then extruded; extrudates of diameter 1.2 mm were obtained."
   "The extrudated catalysts were dried at room temperature for 24 h then the temperature was increased slowly (40 C) to 110 C at which the extrudates were heated for 12 h and next calcined for 4 h at a temperature of 450 C."

3. "Results and Discussion"
   "In Table 1 nominal and real (determined by ICP) composition of the catalysts and their BET surface area are given."
   "TOF-SIMS images of the calcined catalysts 2a and 3a (Fig. 2) confirm a good dispersion of platinum."
   "TPR profiles of the catalysts, calcined at 450 C, are presented in Fig. 3."
   "Toluene conversion, as a function of reaction temperature up to 200 C over silica and silica-titania-supported nickel, platinum and bimetallic Ni-Pt catalysts is shown in Fig. 5."

4. "Conclusions"
   "Platinum promotes the reduction of NiO in the catalysts supported both on SiO2 and TiO2-SiO2."
   "Catalysts supported on TiO2-SiO2 show considerably higher catalytic activity in the toluene hydrogenation than those supported on SiO2."
   "Bimetallic Ni-Pt catalysts containing ca. 0.5 wt.% Pt are more active than related monometallic platinum catalysts, containing comparable amount of platinum."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are not mentioned in the provided literature. The document focuses on the development and characterization of catalysts for toluene hydrogenation, particularly on the effects of platinum (Pt) on nickel (Ni) catalysts supported on silica (SiO2) and binary supports like TiO2-SiO2. These materials are explored for their improved activity in the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds compared to traditional alumina or silica supports. The literature discusses the dispersion of metals, their reducibility, and the impact of the support material on catalytic activity, particularly in the context of sulfur poisoning and two-stage hydrogenation processes. However, it does not delve into the specifics of HREELS or AES measurements for verifying oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-Ni bimetallic systems.

The document highlights the importance of catalysts in refining processes, especially in addressing environmental concerns by reducing pollutants in gasoline and diesel fuels. It emphasizes the challenges in achieving high-quality products through hydrorefining, the role of noble metal catalysts in sulfur removal, and the development of more efficient catalysts for multi-stage processes. The literature also mentions the influence of support materials on catalyst activity, including the higher tolerance of noble metals against sulfur poisoning, the use of solid acids and n-type semiconductors to enhance hydrogenation activity, and the optimization of metal and support combinations for improved catalytic performance. The specific techniques of HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) are not utilized or discussed in the context of the provided scientific literature.
