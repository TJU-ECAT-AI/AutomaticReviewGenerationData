1. "In recent years, the development of cleaner burning fuels has been of very high priority. The trend towards improvement of air quality by reducing levels of tropospheric ozone, NOx and particulate matter has resulted in the proposal of stringent specifications on the aromatic and sulphur contents of gasoline and diesel fuel."
2. "World Wide Fuel Charter and European automobile manufactures association (ACEA) [2] have proposed slightly different requirements from those expected by Auto Oil [3] and Comitee European de Normalisation (CEN) [4] , but the direction is the same."
3. "Applying only hydrorefining catalysts (CoMo, NiMo, NiW on Al2O3), the product quality is very dependent on the operating conditions and feedstock."
4. "However, because noble metal catalysts are easily poisoned by small amounts of sulphur, the hydrodesulfurisation catalyst in the first stage reactor reduces the level of sulphur upto a few ppm."
5. "Therefore, in recent years, extensive studies have been performed to develop metal catalysts for two-stage process by various petroleum and catalyst manufacturing companies [6] ,[7] ,[8] ."
6. "For example MAKFining dearomatisation technology (HDAr technology) is a two-step aromatics saturation process. Feedstock with sulphur levels upto 250 ppm can be treated with KF-200 catalyst in the HDAr section [8] ."
7. "The modification or replacement of alumina or silica supports can change the interaction with the active phase and consequently the activity and resistance to sulphur poisoning of catalysts."
8. "In earliest works the higher tolerance towards sulphur poisoning of noble metals was related to electron deficiency of metal deposited close to strong acidic sites [9] ."
9. "Actually, the higher hydrogenation activity of solid acids containing catalysts was attributed to the presence of hydrogen spillover in the metalsupport interfacial region."
10. "The results obtained for benzene and toluene hydrogenation showed that hydrogenation activity was highly improved in the presence of F and Cl [12] ."
11. "In addition to solid acid it has been verified that n-type semiconductors show excellent capability of accepting spillover hydrogen [15] ,[16] ."
12. "The influence of the metal and of the support on the stability of bifunctional catalysts for toluene hydrogenation was discussed in [18] ,[19] ."
13. "TiO2 and TiO2-containing mixed oxides are regarded as very promising supports of many industrial catalysts [20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."
14. "Recently we published a series of papers, devoted to characterisation and catalytic performance of Ni/SiO2-TiO2 catalysts in hydrogenation of toluene and diesel oil fraction [25] ,[26] ,[27] ."
15. "It was observed that Ni/SiO2-TiO2 catalysts show higher dearomatisation activity in aromatics hydrogenation than nickel catalysts supported on silica, alumina, titania and alumina-titania."
16. "Among different preparation methods, the deposition of TiO2 on SiO2 by hydrolysis of titanium(IV)isopropoxide leads to the support improving the catalytic activity of nickel catalysts."
17. "TiO2 form (anatase, rutile) influences the reducibility and activity of nickel catalysts supported on SiO2-TiO2."
18. "The results confirm that the optimal content of TiO2 in the supports is 25 wt.% and of Ni 5 wt.% in the catalysts."
19. "The aim of this work was to characterise the nature of the oxide precursors of some Ni, Pt and Ni-Pt catalysts supported on SiO2 and TiO2-SiO2, to investigate their susceptibility to reduction and activity in the reaction of toluene hydrogenation to methylcyclohexane."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are not mentioned in the provided literature. The document focuses on the development and characterization of catalysts for toluene hydrogenation, particularly on the effects of platinum (Pt) on nickel (Ni) catalysts supported on silica (SiO2) and binary supports like TiO2-SiO2. These materials are explored for their improved activity in the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds compared to traditional alumina or silica supports. The literature discusses the dispersion of metals, their reducibility, and the impact of the support material on catalytic activity, particularly in the context of sulfur poisoning and two-stage hydrogenation processes. However, it does not delve into the specifics of HREELS or AES measurements for verifying oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-Ni bimetallic systems.

The document highlights the importance of catalysts in refining processes, especially in addressing environmental concerns by reducing pollutants in gasoline and diesel fuels. It emphasizes the challenges in achieving high-quality products through hydrorefining, the role of noble metal catalysts in sulfur removal, and the development of more efficient catalysts for multi-stage processes. The literature also mentions the influence of support materials on catalyst activity, including the higher tolerance of noble metals against sulfur poisoning, the use of solid acids and n-type semiconductors to enhance hydrogenation activity, and the optimization of metal and support combinations for improved catalytic performance. The specific techniques of HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) are not utilized or discussed in the context of the provided scientific literature.
