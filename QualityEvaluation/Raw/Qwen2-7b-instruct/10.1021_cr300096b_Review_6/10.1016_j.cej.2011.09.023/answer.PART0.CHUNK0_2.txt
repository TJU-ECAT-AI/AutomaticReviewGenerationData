<p>In our experiment, we have also checked that the full conversion of maleic anhydride could be achieved over 5% Ni/Al2O3 at the reaction temperature of 220 C. In addition, the 5% Ni0.3% Pt/Al2O3 was also tested to make comparison with 5% Ni loading but no Pt at equal conditions (Fig. 8).</p>
<p>Fig. 8 shows the changes in conversion and selectivity with time on stream at 220 C for hydrogenation of MA over Ni and PtNi catalysts, respectively, at identical reaction conditions.</p>
<p>For the Ni catalyst (Fig. 8 a), Ni catalyst is not very active at the beginning of the test, but after an induction period of about 3 h the conversion raises steeply to 100% (Fig. 8 a). As can be seen the selectivity to SA parallels the increase of conversion, starting from an initial value of 57% and reaching 89%.</p>
<p>In contrast, the PtNi catalyst showed high activity and stability; no deactivation or change in product distribution was observed over 16 h on stream (Fig. 8 b). The product distribution more closely resembled that of the Ni catalyst, with SA and GBL as the reaction products.</p>

1. The 5% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst achieved full conversion of maleic anhydride at 220°C. When compared to the 5% Ni0.3% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the PtNi catalyst showed high activity and stability, maintaining 100% conversion over 16 hours without deactivation or change in product distribution.

2. The Ni catalyst had an induction period before reaching 100% conversion, with an initial selectivity towards succinic anhydride (SA) of 57%, increasing to 89% over time. In contrast, the PtNi catalyst maintained a similar product distribution, with SA and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) as the reaction products, showing high stability and activity.

1. 在220°C下，5% Ni/Al2O3催化剂实现了马尔酸酐的全转化。与5% Ni0.3% Pt/Al2O3催化剂相比，PtNi催化剂显示出高活性和稳定性，在16小时内未出现失活或产品分布变化。

2. Ni催化剂在达到100%转化前有一个诱导期，初始选择性向琥珀酸酐（SA）为57%，随着时间的推移增加到89%。相比之下，PtNi催化剂保持相似的产品分布，SA和γ-丁内酯（GBL）作为反应产物，显示出了高稳定性和活性。
