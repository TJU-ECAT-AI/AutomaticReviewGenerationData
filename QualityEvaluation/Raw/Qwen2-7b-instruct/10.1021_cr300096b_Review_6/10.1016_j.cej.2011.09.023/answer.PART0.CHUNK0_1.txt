<p>The process appears to be controlled by H2 dissociation on nickel and the catalytic activity can be further improved, without loss of selectivity, by adding a very small amount of Pt(0.3) to increase the rate of H2 dissociation.</p>
<p>TPR experiments show high-temperature reduction peaks in monometallic Ni catalysts. When Pt is present, the formation of PtNi compound provokes the shift of the reduction peaks and the appearance of new reduction signals.</p>
<p>3.3 Comparison of different catalysts</p>
<p>Table 1 shows the maleic anhydride hydrogenation over the three series of bimetallic catalysts and the corresponding monometallic catalysts in the flow reactor study. SA and GBL were the only observed reaction products, and the product distributions are presented in Table 1 . For Ni and Co series of catalysts, it was observed that the activity and selectivity over the bimetallic catalysts were greater than that of either monometallic Ni or Co. And the Cu and CuPt show the intermediate activity and selectivity. The results showed that supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity among all as-prepared catalysts in MA hydrogenation, which mostly attributed to the PtNi bimetallic formation.</p>
<p>Fig. 4 shows that while activity of these NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts for the hydrogenation of MA, measured as conversion, increases when increasing Pt content, the SA selectivity to reduce the MA decreases for Pt contents over 0.3 (see Fig. 4 for a detailed distribution of reaction products).</p>
<p>The effect of H2 pressure on the maleic anhydride hydrogenation (Fig. 6) shows that 100% MA conversion with more than 90% selectivity to SA could be obtained at 150 C. Product conversion and selectivity, however, vary significantly with changes in pressure (Fig. 6). It is seen that SA selectivity decreased with increase in H2 pressure from 1.0 to 1.6 MPa.</p>
<p>In Fig. 7 are reported the results of the catalytic hydrogenation of MA carried out with a 5% Ni0.3% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst under optimized conditions. It is noteworthy that these excellent catalytic performances are representative of a very stable catalytic situation, since no traces of deactivation and product distribution change are observed even over the 120 h run time.</p>
<p>Fig. 8 shows the changes in conversion and selectivity with time on stream at 220 C for hydrogenation of MA over Ni and PtNi catalysts, respectively, at identical reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Table 2 indicates that, per atom of metal, Pt is, at least, one order of magnitude more active than any Rh catalysts reported. Taking as reference the work of Liu et al. ([16]), we observe that the most active catalyst precursor giving high selectivity to SA is RhCl(PPh)3 at 110 C and 2 MPa. It shows a specific activity of 220 molSA h−1 mol−1 Me, which is largely surpassed with PtNi/Al2O3 at 100 C and 1 MPa.</p>

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document. However, the document does discuss methods such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) which are commonly used for such analyses. The document mentions that when Pt is present in the catalyst, it leads to the formation of a PtNi compound, causing shifts in the reduction peaks observed in TPR (Temperature Programmed Reduction) experiments. This suggests that techniques like TPR and AES might be employed to analyze the surface segregation and interactions within the bimetallic system. 

To quantify the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations might be performed alongside experimental data. These calculations can predict the energetics of surface segregation and help in understanding the mechanisms involved. The comparison of DFT predictions with experimental observations allows for a deeper understanding of the bimetallic system's behavior and the role of surface segregation in influencing its catalytic activity and selectivity.

As for the question regarding the comparison of the activity of PtNi with other metal catalysts, the document provides data in Table 2, comparing the specific rate of reaction for the selective hydrogenation of MA to SA over PtNi Al2O3 with other catalysts. It indicates that, per atom of metal, Pt is at least one order of magnitude more active than any Rh catalysts reported. The document further compares the specific rate of PtNi Al2O3 with RhCl(PPh)3, PdAl2O3, and RuCl2(TPP)3 catalysts, showing that PtNi/Al2O3 is more active than Pd/Al2O3 and RuCl2(TPP)3, and nearly matches the activity of RhCl(PPh)3 under certain conditions. This comparison highlights the superior activity of Pt-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of MA to SA.

In summary, the document discusses the use of techniques like HREELS and AES for analyzing surface segregation in bimetallic systems, suggests the role of DFT calculations in predicting segregation kinetics and activation barriers, and provides data for comparing the activity of PtNi catalysts with other metal catalysts in the hydrogenation of MA to SA.

验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面偏析（特别是Ni和Co）的实验技术未在提供的文档中明确提及。然而，文档确实讨论了诸如HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子谱）等通常用于此类分析的技术。文档提到，当Pt存在于催化剂中时，会导致形成PtNi化合物，引起TPR（温度程序化还原）实验中还原峰的变化。这表明TPR和AES等技术可能被用来分析双金属体系的表面偏析和相互作用。

为了量化偏析动力学和激活壁垒，可能会进行DFT（密度泛函理论）计算，同时结合实验数据。这些计算可以预测表面偏析的能量，并帮助理解机制。将DFT预测与实验观察结果的比较允许对双金属体系的行为有更深入的理解，以及表面偏析在影响其催化活性和选择性方面的作用。

关于问题中要求比较PtNi与其它金属催化剂的活性，文档提供了表2中的数据，比较了PtNi Al2O3在选择氢化MA到SA反应中的特定反应速率与其他催化剂。它指出，每原子金属而言，Pt的活性至少比任何Rh催化剂报告的活性高出一个数量级。文档进一步比较了PtNi Al2O3与RhCl(PPh)3、PdAl2O3和RuCl2(TPP)3催化剂的特定速率，显示PtNi/Al2O3的活性高于Pd/Al2O3和RuCl2(TPP)3，接近于RhCl(PPh)3在某些条件下的活性。这一比较强调了基于Pt的催化剂在MA到SA氢化反应中的优越活性。

综上所述，文档讨论了使用HREELS和AES技术来分析双金属体系中的表面偏析，暗示DFT计算在预测偏析动力学和激活壁垒中的作用，并提供了比较PtNi催化剂与其它金属催化剂在MA到SA氢化反应活性的数据。
