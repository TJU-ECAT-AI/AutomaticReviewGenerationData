[1] "The process appears to be controlled by H2 dissociation on nickel and the catalytic activity can be further improved, without loss of selectivity, by adding a very small amount of Pt(0.3) to increase the rate of H2 dissociation."
[2] "When Pt is present, the formation of PtNi compound provokes the shift of the reduction peaks and the appearance of new reduction signals."
[3] "The results showed that supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity among all as-prepared catalysts in MA hydrogenation, which mostly attributed to the PtNi bimetallic formation."
[4] "A small amount of Pt further improves the activity and selectivity of Ni/Al2O3."

1. The hydrogenation of maleic anhydride is controlled by hydrogen dissociation on nickel surfaces. Adding a small amount of platinum (0.3%) can enhance the rate of hydrogen dissociation, thus improving the catalytic activity without compromising the selectivity for succinic anhydride production.

2. The presence of platinum in the PtNi bimetallic catalyst leads to a shift in the reduction peaks and the emergence of new reduction signals. This suggests a change in the catalytic behavior of the material upon the formation of the PtNi compound.

3. Among the catalysts tested, the supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed the highest activity in the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride, primarily due to the formation of the PtNi compound. This highlights the effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts in enhancing the catalytic performance.

4. Incorporating a minor quantity of platinum (0.3%) into the nickel/alumina catalyst not only boosts its activity but also maintains the selectivity towards succinic anhydride production.

1. 男酸酐的氢化过程由镍表面的氢解控制。通过在催化剂中添加少量铂（0.3%），可以提高氢解速率，从而增强催化活性，同时不牺牲选择性以生产琥珀酸酐。

2. 当铂存在时，PtNi化合物的形成会导致还原峰位的偏移和新信号的出现。这表明材料的催化行为在PtNi复合物形成后发生变化。

3. 在所有制备的催化剂中，支持型PtNi双金属催化剂在男酸酐氢化反应中的活性最高，主要归因于PtNi复合物的形成。这突出了双金属催化剂在增强催化性能方面的有效性。

4. 在镍/氧化铝催化剂中加入微量铂（0.3%）不仅能够提升其活性，而且能够保持向琥珀酸酐选择性生产的选型。
