[1] "The flow reactor studies demonstrated that PtNi bimetallic catalyst is highly active and selective for the hydrogenation of MA."
[2] "Using Al2O3 as support, it was possible to obtain the highest reaction rate ever obtained with 90% selectivity to SA at 100% conversion."
[3] "The process appears to be controlled by H2 dissociation on nickel and the catalytic activity can be further improved, without loss of selectivity, by adding a very small amount of Pt(0.3) to increase the rate of H2 dissociation."
[4] "TPR experiments show high-temperature reduction peaks in monometallic Ni catalysts. When Pt is present, the formation of PtNi compound provokes the shift of the reduction peaks and the appearance of new reduction signals."

Answer: The PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed the highest activity in the hydrogenation of MA to SA. By adding a small amount of Pt (0.3%), the rate of H2 dissociation was increased, improving the catalytic activity without losing selectivity. The process is controlled by H2 dissociation on nickel, and the addition of Pt shifts the reduction peaks in TPR experiments, indicating its impact on the catalytic activity.

铂镍双金属催化剂在MA氢化为SA中表现出最高活性。通过添加少量的铂（0.3%），提高了氢解速率，从而增强了催化活性而未损失选择性。该过程受镍上的氢解控制，TPR实验中铂的存在导致还原峰位偏移，并出现新的信号，这表明其对催化活性的影响。
