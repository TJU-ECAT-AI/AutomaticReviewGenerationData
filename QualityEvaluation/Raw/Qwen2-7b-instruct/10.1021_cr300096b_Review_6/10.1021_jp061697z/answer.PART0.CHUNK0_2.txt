[1] "The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."
[2] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111)."
[3] "The spectra were obtained by first exposing 200 L of O2 to PtNiPt(111) at 300 K, then cooled to 110 K before the HREEL spectrum was recorded."
[4] "The 3dPtPt surface configuration is lower in energy than that of the corresponding subsurface configuration, indicating that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are thermodynamically unstable with adsorbed oxygen."
[5] "The apparent activation energy for the segregation is 7  1 kcal/mol for Co and 15  2 kcal/mol for Ni."

1. HREELS measurements were conducted to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, serving as an indicator for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface. 
2. Oxygen was adsorbed on clean Pt(111), a Ni film on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111) to perform HREELS measurements. 
3. After adsorbing 200 L of O2 on PtNiPt(111) at 300 K, the sample was cooled to 110 K before HREEL spectra were recorded.
4. The 3dPtPt surface configuration has lower energy than the corresponding subsurface configuration, showing that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are thermodynamically unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen.
5. The apparent activation energy for the segregation of Ni is 15  2 kcal/mol, while for Co, it is 7  1 kcal/mol.

1. HREELS测量被用来识别每个表面的特征ν(metalO)频率，作为Ni从PtNiPt(111)向表面迁移的指示。
2. 在对清洁的Pt(111)，Ni薄膜上的Pt(111)，以及PtNiPt(111)进行了氧气吸附后，执行了HREELS测量。
3. 在将200 L的O2在300 K下暴露于PtNiPt(111)后，样品冷却至110 K，然后记录HREEL光谱。
4. 3dPtPt表面配置的能量低于相应的亚表面配置，表明在吸附氧存在的条件下，Pt3dPt亚表面结构是热力学不稳定的。
5. Ni的迁移激活能为15  2 kcal/mol，而Co的激活能为7  1 kcal/mol。
