[1] "The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."
[2] "The HREELS results in Figures 5 indicate that the segregation of subsurface Ni occurs at 450 K or higher, although more quantitative analysis is needed to determine the diffusion kinetics of Ni from the PtNiPt(111) subsurface as described later."
[3] "Through the use of similar analysis procedures described for PtNiPt, the Ea value is estimated to be between 7  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms at the temperature regime of 300350 K."
[4] "AES results also suggest that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms are coexistent in the Co/Pt surfaces, which should maintain some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than Pt for ORR in the oxygen-containing cathode environment."

The HREELS technique identifies the ν(metalO) frequencies on surfaces to detect the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111), while AES quantifies the increase in surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time to estimate the activation barrier for Ni segregation. The Ea for Ni segregation is estimated to be 15 ± 2 kcal/mol. The Co/Pt system allows for the coexistence of outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms, potentially maintaining some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than pure Pt for oxygen reduction reactions in the presence of oxygen.

HREELS技术通过识别表面的ν(metalO)频率来检测Ni从PtNiPt(111)的分离，而AES量化了氧暴露时间与表面Ni/Pt比值之间的关系，以估计Ni分离的活化能。Ni分离的活化能估计为15±2 kcal/mol。在Co/Pt系统中，Co原子的外向分离和内向扩散可以共存，这可能保持一些PtCoPt亚表面结构，这些结构在氧存在下对氧还原反应比纯Pt更为活跃。
