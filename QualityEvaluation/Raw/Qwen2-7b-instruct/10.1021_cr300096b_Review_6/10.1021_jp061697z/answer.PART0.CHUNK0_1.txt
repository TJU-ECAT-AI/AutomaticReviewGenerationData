[1] "The DFT results indicate that, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, the Pt3dPt subsurface structure is no longer thermodynamically stable."
[2] "The stable surface structure is the one with 3d metals on the topmost surface, 3dPtPt, leading to a thermodynamic driving force for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms."
[3] "The apparent activation energy for the segregation is 7  1 kcal/mol for Co and 15  2 kcal/mol for Ni."
[4] "AES results also suggest that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms are coexistent in the Co/Pt surfaces, which should maintain some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than Pt for ORR in the oxygen-containing cathode environment."

Experimental techniques such as High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) are employed to quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS identifies the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies, which are indicative of the segregation of Ni atoms from the subsurface to the surface at temperatures as low as 450 K. AES measurements confirm the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, revealing that the apparent activation energy for the segregation of Ni atoms is 15 ± 2 kcal/mol and for Co atoms is 7 ± 1 kcal/mol. These experimental findings align with DFT predictions, showing that the outward segregation of Co and Ni atoms coexists with their inward diffusion in Co/Pt surfaces. This dual process maintains some PtCoPt subsurface structures, which are more active than pure Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the oxygen-containing cathode environment.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS）和原子发射光谱（AES），用于量化在吸附氧存在的条件下，3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面分离。HREELS通过识别特征ν(metalO)频率来确定Ni原子从亚表面向表面的分离，这表明在450 K或更低温度下开始Ni的分离。AES测量验证了分离动力学和激活壁垒，结果显示Ni原子的明显激活能为15±2 kcal/mol，Co原子为7±1 kcal/mol。这些实验结果与DFT预测相吻合，显示Co和Ni原子在Co/Pt表面的向外分离与其内在扩散并存。这种双重过程维持了一些PtCoPt亚表面结构的存在，这些结构在氧气含量的阴极环境中对氧还原反应（ORR）比纯Pt更为活跃。
