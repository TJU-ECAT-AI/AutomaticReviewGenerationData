[1] "The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."
[2] "The HREELS results in Figures 5 indicate that the segregation of subsurface Ni occurs at 450 K or higher, although more quantitative analysis is needed to determine the diffusion kinetics of Ni from the PtNiPt(111) subsurface as described later."
[3] "Through the use of similar analysis procedures described for PtNiPt, the Ea value is estimated to be between 7  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms at the temperature regime of 300350 K."
[4] "AES results also suggest that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms are coexistent in the Co/Pt surfaces, which should maintain some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than Pt for ORR in the oxygen-containing cathode environment."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The HREELS technique identifies the ν(metalO) frequencies on surfaces to detect the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111), while AES quantifies the increase in surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time to estimate the activation barrier for Ni segregation. The Ea for Ni segregation is estimated to be 15 ± 2 kcal/mol. The Co/Pt system allows for the coexistence of outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms, potentially maintaining some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than pure Pt for oxygen reduction reactions in the presence of oxygen.

HREELS技术通过识别表面的ν(metalO)频率来检测Ni从PtNiPt(111)的分离，而AES量化了氧暴露时间与表面Ni/Pt比值之间的关系，以估计Ni分离的活化能。Ni分离的活化能估计为15±2 kcal/mol。在Co/Pt系统中，Co原子的外向分离和内向扩散可以共存，这可能保持一些PtCoPt亚表面结构，这些结构在氧存在下对氧还原反应比纯Pt更为活跃。

[3] "The apparent activation energy for the segregation is 7  1 kcal/mol for Co and 15  2 kcal/mol for Ni."

Experimental techniques such as High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) are employed to quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS identifies the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies, which are indicative of the segregation of Ni atoms from the subsurface to the surface at temperatures as low as 450 K. AES measurements confirm the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, revealing that the apparent activation energy for the segregation of Ni atoms is 15 ± 2 kcal/mol and for Co atoms is 7 ± 1 kcal/mol. These experimental findings align with DFT predictions, showing that the outward segregation of Co and Ni atoms coexists with their inward diffusion in Co/Pt surfaces. This dual process maintains some PtCoPt subsurface structures, which are more active than pure Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the oxygen-containing cathode environment.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS）和原子发射光谱（AES），用于量化在吸附氧存在的条件下，3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面分离。HREELS通过识别特征ν(metalO)频率来确定Ni原子从亚表面向表面的分离，这表明在450 K或更低温度下开始Ni的分离。AES测量验证了分离动力学和激活壁垒，结果显示Ni原子的明显激活能为15±2 kcal/mol，Co原子为7±1 kcal/mol。这些实验结果与DFT预测相吻合，显示Co和Ni原子在Co/Pt表面的向外分离与其内在扩散并存。这种双重过程维持了一些PtCoPt亚表面结构的存在，这些结构在氧气含量的阴极环境中对氧还原反应（ORR）比纯Pt更为活跃。

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time, allowing the estimation of the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen. AES results showed that substantial Co diffusion, in the absence of oxygen, already occurs by 400 K, and the Ea value for Co segregation is lower at 400475 K (3 kcal/mol) than that at 300350 K (7  1 kcal/mol), suggesting that the experimentally determined Ea is most likely the difference between the activation barriers of Co outward segregation and inward diffusion. In comparison, the inward diffusion of Ni is relatively insignificant at temperatures below 500 K, which is most likely responsible for the higher apparent activation barrier for Ni segregation (15  2 kcal/mol). The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems, with AES results suggesting that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms are coexistent in the Co/Pt surfaces, which should maintain some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than Pt for ORR in the oxygen-containing cathode environment.

使用HREELS和AES等实验技术验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中3d原子（Ni和Co）的氧诱导表面迁移。AES测量用于确定氧气暴露时间与表面Ni/Pt比率之间的关系，从而估算在氧气存在的条件下将PtNiPt(111)转化为NiPtPt(111)的活化能垒（Ea）。AES结果显示，在没有氧气的情况下，Co的扩散在400 K时就已经发生，且在400475 K时（3 kcal/mol），Co的迁移活化能低于在300350 K时（7  1 kcal/mol），这表明实验测定的Ea可能是Co向外迁移和向内扩散的活化能差。相比之下，Ni的向内扩散在低于500 K的温度下相对不显著，这是导致Ni迁移活化壁垒更高的主要原因（15  2 kcal/mol）。所测量的迁移动力学和活化能与这些系统的DFT预测相比较，AES结果表明，在Co/Pt表面上同时存在向外迁移和向内扩散的Co原子，这应该保持部分PtCoPt亚表面结构，这些结构在氧含电池环境中对ORR活性高于纯Pt。
