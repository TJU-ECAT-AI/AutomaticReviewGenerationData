[1] "The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."
[2] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111)."
[3] "The bottom spectrum in Figure 5a shows the adsorption of oxygen on Pt(111), which closely resembles previously reported HREELS measurements."
[4] "The 450 K spectrum is generally the same as the 300 and 400 K spectra, except the onset of a shoulder peak at 352 cm-1."
[5] "The ν(metalO) modes after 2000 L are similar to the 400 L exposure, with a slight increase in peak intensity."
[6] "The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni is estimated to be 15 ± 2 kcal/mol."
[7] "The Ea value for Co segregation is lower at 400-475 K (3 kcal/mol) than that at 300-350 K (7 ± 1 kcal/mol)."

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS measurements were carried out to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies, which serve as indicators for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface. AES measurements provided the activation barriers for the segregation of Ni and Co, estimating them to be 15 ± 2 kcal/mol and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol, respectively. These experimental findings align with the DFT predictions, demonstrating that the Pt3dPt subsurface structure is thermodynamically unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, leading to a preference for the 3dPtPt surface structure.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，被用来验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面分层的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）。HREELS测量用于识别特征ν(metalO)频率，作为Ni从PtNiPt(111)表面分层的指示器。AES测量提供了Ni和Co分层的活化能垒，估计分别为15±2 kcal/mol和7±1 kcal/mol。这些实验结果与DFT预测一致，表明在吸附氧存在的条件下，Pt3dPt亚表面结构不再是热力学稳定的，导致倾向于3dPtPt表面结构，从而引发亚表面3d原子向表面的分层现象。
