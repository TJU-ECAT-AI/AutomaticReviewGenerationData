Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time, allowing the estimation of the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen. AES results showed that substantial Co diffusion, in the absence of oxygen, already occurs by 400 K, and the Ea value for Co segregation is lower at 400475 K (3 kcal/mol) than that at 300350 K (7  1 kcal/mol), suggesting that the experimentally determined Ea is most likely the difference between the activation barriers of Co outward segregation and inward diffusion. In comparison, the inward diffusion of Ni is relatively insignificant at temperatures below 500 K, which is most likely responsible for the higher apparent activation barrier for Ni segregation (15  2 kcal/mol). The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems, with AES results suggesting that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms are coexistent in the Co/Pt surfaces, which should maintain some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than Pt for ORR in the oxygen-containing cathode environment.

使用HREELS和AES等实验技术验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中3d原子（Ni和Co）的氧诱导表面迁移。AES测量用于确定氧气暴露时间与表面Ni/Pt比率之间的关系，从而估算在氧气存在的条件下将PtNiPt(111)转化为NiPtPt(111)的活化能垒（Ea）。AES结果显示，在没有氧气的情况下，Co的扩散在400 K时就已经发生，且在400475 K时（3 kcal/mol），Co的迁移活化能低于在300350 K时（7  1 kcal/mol），这表明实验测定的Ea可能是Co向外迁移和向内扩散的活化能差。相比之下，Ni的向内扩散在低于500 K的温度下相对不显著，这是导致Ni迁移活化壁垒更高的主要原因（15  2 kcal/mol）。所测量的迁移动力学和活化能与这些系统的DFT预测相比较，AES结果表明，在Co/Pt表面上同时存在向外迁移和向内扩散的Co原子，这应该保持部分PtCoPt亚表面结构，这些结构在氧含电池环境中对ORR活性高于纯Pt。
