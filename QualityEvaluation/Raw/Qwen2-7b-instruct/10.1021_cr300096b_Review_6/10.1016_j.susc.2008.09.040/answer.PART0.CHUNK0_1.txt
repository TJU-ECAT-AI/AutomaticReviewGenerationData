1. DFT calculations predict increased binding energies for ethanol, ethoxy, and ethylene glycol species on the surface monolayer NiPtPt(1 1 1) compared to subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(1 1 1) and clean Pt(1 1 1). This trend aligns with previous findings for other adsorbates, with binding energy increasing as the surface d-band center approaches the Fermi level.
2. Ethanol adsorbs molecularly at 120 K with the OH bond intact on Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1), whereas dissociative adsorption is noted on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces.
3. Ethylene glycol adsorbs molecularly with the OH bond intact on all four surfaces at 200 K.
4. The combined insights from DFT, TPD, and HREELS studies confirm that the initial OH bond scission is a crucial kinetic step in the reforming of oxygenates on Pt-based surfaces, explaining the enhanced activity of NiPtPt(1 1 1) over Pt(1 1 1). This suggests that surfaces with increased rates of initial OH bond cleavage may be promising catalysts for oxygenate reforming.

1. DFT计算预测，乙醇、乙氧基和乙二醇衍生物在表面单层NiPtPt(1 1 1)上的结合能高于亚层单层PtNiPt(1 1 1)和清洁Pt(1 1 1)。这一趋势与其它吸附剂的先前发现一致，结合能随表面d带中心接近费米能级而增加。
2. 120 K时，乙醇以分子形式在Pt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1)上吸附，OH键保持完整，而在NiPtPt(1 1 1)和Ni(1 1 1)薄膜上观察到离散吸附。
3. 在所有四个表面上，200 K时乙二醇以分子形式吸附，OH键保持完整。
4. 结合DFT、TPD和HREELS研究的结果，初始OH键断裂被确认为Pt基表面氧气化物重整的关键步骤，解释了NiPtPt(1 1 1)相对于Pt(1 1 1)的增强活性。这表明，初始OH键断裂速率较高的表面可能是氧气化物重整的潜在催化剂。
