<p>The reaction of ethanol has been studied previously on a variety of transition metal surfaces, including Pt(1 1 1) [3] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] , Ni(1 1 1) [11] ,[12] , Pd(1 1 1) [13] ,[14] ,[15] , Pd(1 1 0) [15] , and Rh(1 1 1) [16] . Ethanol reacts on Pt(1 1 1) to produce mainly H2 and CO, while on Ni(1 1 1) [11] the evolution of acetaldehyde is also observed. The reaction is believed to proceed through initial OH bond scission, forming an ethoxy species. This species can further dehydrogenate on Pt and Ni surfaces to an acetaldehyde intermediate, which decomposes to produce CO and H2.</p>
<p>Ethylene glycol has been investigated previously on Pt(1 1 1) [3] , Rh(1 1 1) [17] , Ni(1 0 0) [18] , Cu(1 1 0) [19] , Ag(1 1 0) [20] ,[21] and Mo(1 1 0) [22] . Ethylene glycol adsorbs reversibly on clean Ag(1 1 0) [20] , while on most other surfaces the decomposition has been observed to proceed by initial OH bond cleavage, forming an ethylenedioxy intermediate (OCH2CH2O).</p>
<p>In this work, we first present the results of DFT calculations of the bonding of ethanol, ethoxy and species derived from ethylene glycol on NiPtPt(1 1 1), PtNiPt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. DFT calculations predict increased binding energies on NiPtPt(1 1 1) as compared to PtNiPt(1 1 1) and clean Pt(1 1 1), with the observed trend consistent with previous results for other molecules [23] . This is followed by HREELS studies of the adsorption and decomposition of ethanol and ethylene glycol on these surfaces.</p>
<p>Experimental techniques such as AES and HREELS are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measurements can detect the segregation of Ni and Co atoms, while HREELS can provide information on the adsorption and decomposition of oxygenates on the surfaces.</p>

Ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces: A DFT and HREELS study Abstract The reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol have been studied on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). A linear correlation has been observed between the binding energies of ethanol, ethoxy, and ethylene glycol species and the surface d-band center, with increasing binding energy as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. HREELS measurements have identified the bond scission sequence of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.

<p>As reported in the introduction section, "We have performed a series of surface science and DFT studies to investigate the reforming pathways of oxygenates on bimetallic surfaces [3] ,[4] ,[5] . For example, in a previous paper, we reported the reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces using temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface, with a monolayer Ni atoms residing on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, exhibited increased activity for reforming of ethanol and ethylene glycol as compared to either Ni(1 1 1) or Pt(1 1 1) surfaces."</p>
<p>The DFT calculations discussed in section 3.1 of the document predict increased binding energies of ethanol, ethoxy, and species derived from ethylene glycol on the surface monolayer NiPtPt(1 1 1) as compared to subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(1 1 1) and clean Pt(1 1 1). This trend is consistent with previous results for other molecules.</p>
<p>In section 3.2, the document states, "HREELS was used to further understand the different reaction pathways and to probe the surface intermediates involved in the chemistry of oxygenates on the four different surfaces." The HREELS results are consistent with TPD studies that show the reforming activities of ethanol and ethylene glycol follow the trend NiPtPt(1 1 1) > Ni(1 1 1) film > Pt(1 1 1) > PtNiPt(1 1 1).</p>

2. HREELS measurements confirm the different reaction pathways and identify surface intermediates involved in the chemistry of oxygenates on various surfaces. 

3. Combining the results from DFT, TPD, and HREELS studies, the initial OH bond scission is identified as kinetically important for reforming of oxygenates on Pt-based surfaces. This explains the increased activity of NiPtPt(1 1 1) over Pt(1 1 1).

4. The increased OH scission activity on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film correlates with the increased binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces, suggesting they are good potential catalysts for oxygenate reforming.

(2) Ethylene glycol adsorbs molecularly with the OH bond intact on all four surfaces at 200 K. Ethylene glycol undergoes primarily reversible desorption from the Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces. In contrast, on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces the initial decomposition proceeds through OH bond cleavage, forming a (OCH2CH2O) intermediate. This is followed by further dehydrogenation and CC bond scission to eventually form adsorbed CO.
(4) Combining the results from the DFT, TPD, and HREELS studies, the initial OH bond scission is identified as kinetically important for reforming of oxygenates on Pt-based surfaces. This explains the increased activity of NiPtPt(1 1 1) over Pt(1 1 1). Furthermore, this suggests that surfaces with increased rates of initial OH bond cleavage should be good potential catalysts for oxygenate reforming.

1. Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by observing changes in adsorption energies and surface structures. AES measures the elemental composition of the surface, while HREELS provides insights into the bonding state and dynamics of the adsorbates. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can be compared with DFT predictions to validate the theoretical models.

2. The literature demonstrates that the initial OH bond scission of ethylene glycol is kinetically important for the reforming of oxygenates on Pt-based surfaces. This process leads to increased activity on NiPtPt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 1 1). Moreover, surfaces with enhanced rates of initial OH bond cleavage are likely to be effective catalysts for oxygenate reforming, as they facilitate the desired chemical transformations more efficiently.

2. 文献表明，乙二醇的初始OH键断裂对于Pt基表面的氧化物重整是动力学上重要的过程。这一过程导致了NiPtPt(1 1 1)的活性增加，相比于Pt(1 1 1)。此外，具有增强的初始OH键断裂速率的表面可能是氧气重整的有效催化剂，因为它们更有效地促进了所需的化学转变。
