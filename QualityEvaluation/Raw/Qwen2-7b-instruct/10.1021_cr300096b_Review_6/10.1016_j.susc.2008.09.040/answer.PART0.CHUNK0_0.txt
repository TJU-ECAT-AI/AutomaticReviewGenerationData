<p>The reaction of ethanol has been studied previously on a variety of transition metal surfaces, including Pt(1 1 1) [3] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] , Ni(1 1 1) [11] ,[12] , Pd(1 1 1) [13] ,[14] ,[15] , Pd(1 1 0) [15] , and Rh(1 1 1) [16] . Ethanol reacts on Pt(1 1 1) to produce mainly H2 and CO, while on Ni(1 1 1) [11] the evolution of acetaldehyde is also observed. The reaction is believed to proceed through initial OH bond scission, forming an ethoxy species. This species can further dehydrogenate on Pt and Ni surfaces to an acetaldehyde intermediate, which decomposes to produce CO and H2.</p>
<p>Ethylene glycol has been investigated previously on Pt(1 1 1) [3] , Rh(1 1 1) [17] , Ni(1 0 0) [18] , Cu(1 1 0) [19] , Ag(1 1 0) [20] ,[21] and Mo(1 1 0) [22] . Ethylene glycol adsorbs reversibly on clean Ag(1 1 0) [20] , while on most other surfaces the decomposition has been observed to proceed by initial OH bond cleavage, forming an ethylenedioxy intermediate (OCH2CH2O).</p>
<p>In this work, we first present the results of DFT calculations of the bonding of ethanol, ethoxy and species derived from ethylene glycol on NiPtPt(1 1 1), PtNiPt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. DFT calculations predict increased binding energies on NiPtPt(1 1 1) as compared to PtNiPt(1 1 1) and clean Pt(1 1 1), with the observed trend consistent with previous results for other molecules [23] . This is followed by HREELS studies of the adsorption and decomposition of ethanol and ethylene glycol on these surfaces.</p>
<p>Experimental techniques such as AES and HREELS are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measurements can detect the segregation of Ni and Co atoms, while HREELS can provide information on the adsorption and decomposition of oxygenates on the surfaces.</p>

Experimental techniques such as AES and HREELS are utilized to confirm and measure the surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES analysis enables the detection of segregated Ni and Co atoms, whereas HREELS offers insights into the adsorption and decomposition processes of oxygenates on the surfaces. The measurements and analyses conducted through these techniques support the understanding of the oxygen-induced surface segregation and its implications on the catalytic activity of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic system.
