Ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces: A DFT and HREELS study Abstract The reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol have been studied on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). A linear correlation has been observed between the binding energies of ethanol, ethoxy, and ethylene glycol species and the surface d-band center, with increasing binding energy as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. HREELS measurements have identified the bond scission sequence of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.

Answer: 
The experimental techniques of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) were employed to study the reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies of ethanol, ethoxy, and species derived from ethylene glycol were calculated on various surfaces, and a linear correlation was observed between these binding energies and the surface d-band center, with increasing binding energy as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. HREELS measurements identified the bond scission sequence of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.
