<p>As reported in the introduction section, "We have performed a series of surface science and DFT studies to investigate the reforming pathways of oxygenates on bimetallic surfaces [3] ,[4] ,[5] . For example, in a previous paper, we reported the reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces using temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface, with a monolayer Ni atoms residing on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, exhibited increased activity for reforming of ethanol and ethylene glycol as compared to either Ni(1 1 1) or Pt(1 1 1) surfaces."</p>
<p>The DFT calculations discussed in section 3.1 of the document predict increased binding energies of ethanol, ethoxy, and species derived from ethylene glycol on the surface monolayer NiPtPt(1 1 1) as compared to subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(1 1 1) and clean Pt(1 1 1). This trend is consistent with previous results for other molecules.</p>
<p>In section 3.2, the document states, "HREELS was used to further understand the different reaction pathways and to probe the surface intermediates involved in the chemistry of oxygenates on the four different surfaces." The HREELS results are consistent with TPD studies that show the reforming activities of ethanol and ethylene glycol follow the trend NiPtPt(1 1 1) > Ni(1 1 1) film > Pt(1 1 1) > PtNiPt(1 1 1).</p>

1. The DFT calculations predict increased binding energies on the surface monolayer NiPtPt(1 1 1) as compared to subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(1 1 1) and clean Pt(1 1 1), which is consistent with previous results for other molecules. 

2. HREELS measurements confirm the different reaction pathways and identify surface intermediates involved in the chemistry of oxygenates on various surfaces. 

3. Combining the results from DFT, TPD, and HREELS studies, the initial OH bond scission is identified as kinetically important for reforming of oxygenates on Pt-based surfaces. This explains the increased activity of NiPtPt(1 1 1) over Pt(1 1 1).

4. The increased OH scission activity on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film correlates with the increased binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces, suggesting they are good potential catalysts for oxygenate reforming.

1. 计算预测在表面单层NiPtPt(1 1 1)上的结合能高于次表层单层PtNiPt(1 1 1)和清洁Pt(1 1 1)，与其它分子的结果一致。

2. HREELS测量证实了氧气化物在不同表面上的不同反应路径，并识别出了表面中间体。

3. 结合DFT、TPD和HREELS研究的结果，初始OH键断裂被确认为氧化剂改性Pt基表面的关键步骤。这解释了NiPtPt(1 1 1)比Pt(1 1 1)更活跃的原因。

4. NiPtPt(1 1 1)和Ni(1 1 1)薄膜上较高的初始OH键断裂活性与这些表面上吸附剂的较高结合能相关联，表明它们是氧化剂改性的潜在良好催化剂。
