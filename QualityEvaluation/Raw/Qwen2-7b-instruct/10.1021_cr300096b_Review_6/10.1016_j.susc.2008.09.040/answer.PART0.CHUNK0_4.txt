(2) Ethylene glycol adsorbs molecularly with the OH bond intact on all four surfaces at 200 K. Ethylene glycol undergoes primarily reversible desorption from the Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces. In contrast, on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces the initial decomposition proceeds through OH bond cleavage, forming a (OCH2CH2O) intermediate. This is followed by further dehydrogenation and CC bond scission to eventually form adsorbed CO.
(4) Combining the results from the DFT, TPD, and HREELS studies, the initial OH bond scission is identified as kinetically important for reforming of oxygenates on Pt-based surfaces. This explains the increased activity of NiPtPt(1 1 1) over Pt(1 1 1). Furthermore, this suggests that surfaces with increased rates of initial OH bond cleavage should be good potential catalysts for oxygenate reforming.

1. Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by observing changes in adsorption energies and surface structures. AES measures the elemental composition of the surface, while HREELS provides insights into the bonding state and dynamics of the adsorbates. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can be compared with DFT predictions to validate the theoretical models.

2. The literature demonstrates that the initial OH bond scission of ethylene glycol is kinetically important for the reforming of oxygenates on Pt-based surfaces. This process leads to increased activity on NiPtPt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 1 1). Moreover, surfaces with enhanced rates of initial OH bond cleavage are likely to be effective catalysts for oxygenate reforming, as they facilitate the desired chemical transformations more efficiently.

1. 实验技术，如HREELS和AES，可以通过观察吸附能和表面结构的变化来验证并量化由氧诱导的在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）的表面分离。AES测量表面的元素组成，而HREELS提供了吸附剂的键合状态和动力学的见解。通过与DFT预测进行比较，可以验证理论模型的有效性。

2. 文献表明，乙二醇的初始OH键断裂对于Pt基表面的氧化物重整是动力学上重要的过程。这一过程导致了NiPtPt(1 1 1)的活性增加，相比于Pt(1 1 1)。此外，具有增强的初始OH键断裂速率的表面可能是氧气重整的有效催化剂，因为它们更有效地促进了所需的化学转变。
