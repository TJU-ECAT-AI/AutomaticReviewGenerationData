[1] "The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields."
[2] "The presence of weakly adsorbed acrolein through a di-r-C O configuration appeared to be responsible for this desired hydrogenation pathway."
[3] "The binding energies of acrolein through the different geometries are similar for the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) surfaces."
[4] "The three surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures show higher binding energies, through either the di-r-CC or the g4(C,C,C,O) configuration."

1. The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures shows a trend where Pt NiPt(1 1 1) has the highest activity, followed by PtCoPt(1 1 1), and then PtCuPt(1 1 1), based on the TPD yields.
2. The presence of a di-r-C O configuration of acrolein on the surface is crucial for the hydrogenation pathway towards the C@O bond.
3. The binding energies of acrolein are similar on the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) surfaces.
4. The 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces exhibit higher binding energies, particularly through the di-r-CC or g4(C,C,C,O) configurations.
5. The subsurfaces PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) show similar vibrational features, which correlates with their comparable hydrogenation activities.

1. Pt NiPt(1 1 1)结构上的Pt3dPt(1 1 1)亚表面氢化活性最高，其次是PtCoPt(1 1 1)，然后是PtCuPt(1 1 1)，基于TPD产率。
2. acrolein的C@O键上存在的di-r-C O配置对于向C@O键的氢化途径至关重要。
3. Pt3dPt(1 1 1)表面的acrolein结合能相似。
4. 3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面表现出更高的结合能，特别是通过di-r-CC或g4(C,C,C,O)配置。
5. PtCoPt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1)的亚表面具有相似的振动特征，这与它们的可比较氢化活性相关。
