[1] "The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(111) > PtCoPt(111) > PtCuPt(111) based on the TPD yields."
[2] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the PtNiPt(111) surface leads to an enhancement in the production of both propanal and 2-propenol."
[3] "In comparison, from the CoPtPt(111) surface the H2 and CO products desorb at higher temperatures, with CO desorbing at 409 and 619 K."
[4] "The TPD results are consistent with HREELS measurements of different vibrational features after the adsorption and reaction of acrolein on the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) and surface 3dPt(111) structures."
[5] "DFT calculations suggest that the different hydrogenation activities between the subsurface and surface structures appear to be related to the differences in the binding energy of acrolein on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces."

1. The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures follows the trend: Pt NiPt(111) > PtCoPt(111) > PtCuPt(111) based on the TPD yields.
2. Pre-adsorbed hydrogen enhances the production of both propanal and 2-propenol on the PtNiPt(111) surface.
3. The desorption of H2 and CO products occurs at higher temperatures on the CoPtPt(111) surface compared to other surfaces.
4. The TPD results align with HREELS measurements of vibrational features after acrolein adsorption and reaction on subsurface and surface 3dPt(111) structures.
5. DFT calculations propose that the hydrogenation activities' difference between subsurface and surface structures might be due to varying binding energies of acrolein on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces.

1. 基于TPD产量，表面Pt3dPt(111)结构的氢化活性趋势为：Pt NiPt(111) > PtCoPt(111) > PtCuPt(111)。
2. 预吸附的氢气在PtNiPt(111)表面上增强了丙醛和2-丙醇的生成。
3. CoPtPt(111)表面的H2和CO产品的脱附温度高于其他表面，CO在409和619 K时脱附。
4. TPD结果与不同吸附和反应后在表面和3dPt(111)结构上的acrolein的振动特征的HREELS测量一致。
5. DFT计算表明，表面活性的不同可能与acrolein在相应双金属表面上的结合能差异有关。
