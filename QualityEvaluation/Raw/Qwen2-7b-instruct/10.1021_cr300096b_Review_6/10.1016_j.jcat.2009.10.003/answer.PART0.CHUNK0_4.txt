[1] "Acrolein, the smallest a,b-unsaturated aldehyde, is used as a probe molecule to study the effect on the hydrogenation activity toward the C@C and C@O bonds due to the presence of a 3d transition metal either on the surface or in the subsurface region of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate."
[2] "The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields."
[3] "The presence of weakly adsorbed acrolein through a di-r-C O configuration appeared to be responsible for this desired hydrogenation pathway."
[4] "In comparison, the vibrational spectra on CuPtPt(1 1 1) are rather complicated, with many well-resolved features ranging from 311 to 3017 cm1, suggesting the presence of weakly adsorbed species."
[5] "Similar vibrational features are observed for the subsurfaces PtCoPt(1 1 1) and the PtNiPt(1 1 1)."
[6] "Recent DFT modeling results indicate that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by measuring the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. These measurements are compared with DFT predictions for these systems. The trend in hydrogenation activity shows that Pt NiPt(111) has the highest activity, followed by PtCoPt(111), and then PtCuPt(111). Weakly adsorbed acrolein through a di-r-C O configuration is responsible for the desired hydrogenation pathway. Vibrational features on CuPtPt(111) are complicated, suggesting the presence of weakly adsorbed species. Similar vibrational features are observed for the subsurfaces PtCoPt(111) and the PtNiPt(111). Recent DFT modeling results indicate that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen.

实验技术如HREELS和AES通过测量表面迁移率和激活能垒验证并量化氧诱导的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面迁移。这些测量与这些系统的DFT预测进行比较。氢化活性的趋势显示，Pt NiPt(111)具有最高的活性，其次是PtCoPt(111)，然后是PtCuPt(111)。弱吸附的丙烯醛通过di-r-C O配置是导致理想氢化途径的原因。CuPtPt(111)上的振动特征较为复杂，表明存在弱吸附物种。对于PtCoPt(111)和PtNiPt(111)的表面结构，观察到相似的振动特征。最近的DFT模型结果表明，带有吸附氢的Pt3dPt亚表面结构在热力学上更为有利。
