Trend in the C@C and C@O bond hydrogenation of acrolein on PtM (M = Ni, Co, Cu) bimetallic surfaces Luis E. Murillo a,1, Carl A. Menning b, Jingguang G.

Acrolein, the smallest a,b-unsaturated aldehyde, is used as a probe molecule to study the effect on the hydrogenation activity toward the C@C and C@O bonds due to the presence of a 3d transition metal either on the surface or in the subsurface region of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate.

The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields.

The main hydrogenated products on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surface structures are also calculated and reported in Table 2. Due to the absence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen, the production of propanal and 2-propenol on these surfaces is from the self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reaction of acrolein.

In comparison, the yield of the desirable product, 2-propenol, is lower on 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces than on their subsurface counterparts. This difference becomes more obvious in the presence of pre-dosed hydrogen, which does not lead to any enhancement in the hydrogenation activity on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surface structures (spectra not shown).

In the current study, DFT calculations of binding energies of acrolein were performed to help understand the difference between the hydrogenation activities observed on the different 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surface and the subsurface structures.

The binding energies of acrolein through the different geometries are similar for the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) surfaces. Moreover, these calculated binding energies are very low, suggesting weak interactions of acrolein with the subsurface structures.

The three surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures show higher binding energies, through either the di-r-CC or the g4(C,C,C,O) configuration. The strong binding energies on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are most likely the origin of the lower hydrogenation activities.

Furthermore, DFT results show that the di-r-CO configuration always converges to either di-r-CC or g4(C,C,C,O) during the calculation; the absence of the di-r-CO configuration is consistent with the relatively low C@O bond hydrogenation activity on these surfaces.

1. The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures shows a trend of Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields.

2. The production of propanal and 2-propenol on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces is from the self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reaction of acrolein due to the absence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen.

3. The yield of the desirable product, 2-propenol, is lower on 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces than on their subsurface counterparts, even in the presence of pre-dosed hydrogen.

4. The hydrogenation activities on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surface and the subsurface structures differ due to the weak interactions of acrolein with the subsurface structures and the strong binding energies on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces.

1. 在Pt3dPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构上，氢化活性呈现出Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1)的趋势，基于TPD产量。

2. 由于缺乏预吸附的氢，3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面的丙酮生产来自于丙酮自身的氢化（分解）反应。

3. 即使在预镀氢的情况下，3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面的产物中2-丙烯醇的产率仍然低于其亚表面对应物。

4. 3d/Pt(1 1 1)表面和亚表面结构之间的氢化活性差异归因于丙酮与亚表面结构之间的弱相互作用以及3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面的强结合能。
