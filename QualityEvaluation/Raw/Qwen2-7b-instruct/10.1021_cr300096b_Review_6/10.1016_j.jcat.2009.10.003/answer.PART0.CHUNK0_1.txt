<p>The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields.</p>
<p>The absolute yield toward 2-propenol is also the highest on PtNiPt(1 1 1), which is further enhanced by the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen.</p>
<p>In contrast, the selective hydrogenation does not occur on the surface monolayer 3dPt(1 1 1) structures.</p>
<p>The TPD results are consistent with HREELS measurements of different vibrational features after the adsorption and reaction of acrolein on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPt(1 1 1) structures.</p>
<p>In addition, DFT calculations suggest that the different hydrogenation activities between the subsurface and surface structures appear to be related to the differences in the binding energy of acrolein on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces.</p>

1. The hydrogenation activity of PtNiPt(1 1 1) is higher than that of PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields.
2. The absolute yield of 2-propenol is highest on PtNiPt(1 1 1) and can be further enhanced by pre-adsorbed hydrogen.
3. Selective hydrogenation does not occur on the surface monolayer 3dPt(1 1 1) structures.
4. The TPD results align with HREELS measurements of vibrational features after acrolein adsorption and reaction on the subsurface and surface structures.
5. DFT calculations indicate that the differences in hydrogenation activities between the subsurface and surface structures are related to the distinct binding energies of acrolein on the bimetallic surfaces.
