Trend in the C@C and C@O bond hydrogenation of acrolein on PtM (M = Ni, Co, Cu) bimetallic surfaces Luis E. Murillo a,1, Carl A. Menning b, Jingguang G. Chen b,* a Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States b Department of Chemical Engineering, Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States

Acrolein, the smallest a,b-unsaturated aldehyde, is used as a probe molecule to study the effect on the hydrogenation activity toward the C@C and C@O bonds due to the presence of a 3d transition metal either on the surface or in the subsurface region of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate.

The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields.

The main hydrogenated products on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surface structures are also calculated and reported in Table 2. Due to the absence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen, the production of propanal and 2-propenol on these surfaces is from the self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reaction of acrolein.

In comparison, the yield of the desirable product, 2-propenol, is lower on 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces than on their subsurface counterparts. This difference becomes more obvious in the presence of pre-dosed hydrogen, which does not lead to any enhancement in the hydrogenation activity on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surface structures (spectra not shown).

In the current study, DFT calculations of binding energies of acrolein were performed to help understand the difference between the hydrogenation activities observed on the different 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surface and the subsurface structures.

The binding energies of acrolein through the different geometries are similar for the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) surfaces. Moreover, these calculated binding energies are very low, suggesting weak interactions of acrolein with the subsurface structures.

The three surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures show higher binding energies, through either the di-r-CC or the g4(C,C,C,O) configuration. The strong binding energies on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are most likely the origin of the lower hydrogenation activities.

Furthermore, DFT results show that the di-r-CO configuration always converges to either di-r-CC or g4(C,C,C,O) during the calculation; the absence of the di-r-CO configuration is consistent with the relatively low C@O bond hydrogenation activity on these surfaces.

实验技术如HREELS和AES通过测量表面迁移率和激活能垒验证并量化氧诱导的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面迁移。这些测量与这些系统的DFT预测进行比较。氢化活性的趋势显示，Pt NiPt(111)具有最高的活性，其次是PtCoPt(111)，然后是PtCuPt(111)。弱吸附的丙烯醛通过di-r-C O配置是导致理想氢化途径的原因。CuPtPt(111)上的振动特征较为复杂，表明存在弱吸附物种。对于PtCoPt(111)和PtNiPt(111)的表面结构，观察到相似的振动特征。最近的DFT模型结果表明，带有吸附氢的Pt3dPt亚表面结构在热力学上更为有利。
