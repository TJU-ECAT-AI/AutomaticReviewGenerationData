The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) has been of great use in studying the structure of supported catalysts, and of multicomponent catalysts in particular. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), which is one area of XAFS, contains information on local atomic arrangement about each individual type of absorber atom as described in theoretical formula based on the single contribution to XAFS (5). On the other hand, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), which represents electronic transitions from inner electronic levels to outer unoccupied levels caused by X-ray absorption, reveals information on the electronic structure of condensed matter, including differences in chemical environment, the oxidation state in complex, and so on (6, 7).

XAFS, particularly EXAFS and XANES, are powerful tools for characterizing the structure and electronic properties of catalysts. EXAFS provides information on the local atomic arrangement around each type of absorber atom, while XANES reveals details about the electronic structure of the material, such as chemical environments, oxidation states, and differences in chemical surroundings.
