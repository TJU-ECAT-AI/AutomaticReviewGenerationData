1. The shape of Mo/γ -Al2O3 is not spherical but like a raft, considering the small coordination numbers.
2. The unique structural features of MoPt/Y-zeolite could be due to the unconventional preparation method using chemical vapor deposition.
3. Adding Mo decreases the white line areas of Pt, bringing them closer to Pt foil values.
4. Even taking into account the possibility of Mo being well dispersed, the coordination numbers for Mo/γ -Al2O3 are surprisingly small.
5. The structure of (Mo,Pt)/γ -Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts remains unaffected by the sequence of metal impregnation onto the support.

1. Mo/γ -Al2O3的形状更像是筏子，而不是球形，考虑到其小的配位数。
2. MoPt/Y-沸石的独特结构特性可能源于使用化学气相沉积在预形成的Pt簇上的不寻常制备方法。
3. 添加Mo降低了Pt的白线区域，使其接近Pt箔的值。
4. 即使考虑到Mo可能在支持上均匀分散的情况，Mo/γ -Al2O3的配位数仍然非常小。
5. (Mo,Pt)/γ -Al2O3双金属催化剂的结构不受两种金属在支撑物上的添加顺序的影响。
