<p>The coordination number of PtPt in Pt/γ-Al2O3, which is smaller than that in Pt foil, indicates that platinum is well dispersed over the γ-Al2O3 support. Also, a larger Debye Waller factor suggests that the supported platinum particles have more disordered structure compared to bulk Pt. The difference in PtPt distance is small, but consistently shorter for supported samples.</p>
<p>Unlike the RSF of Pt/γ-Al2O3, the RSF of Mo/γ-Al2O3 shows unusual peaks in the distances of 12 A, indicating the existence of light backscatterer atoms. These peaks are not originated from the presence of molybdenum oxides in the samples, because RSF and XANES of MoO2 and MoO3 are markedly different from that of Mo/γ-Al2O3. The other possibility is the interaction between Mo and the support γ-Al2O3.</p>
<p>From the relative magnitudes of coordination numbers of four absorberscatterer pairs, the PtMo/γ-Al2O3 can be described as alloy clusters where platinum atoms are surrounded by molybdenum. Thus, the MoMo coordination number becomes smaller than PtPt because Mo is located at the outer surface region, while Pt resides near the core of the cluster. Furthermore, the MoMo distance is elongated to accommodate itself to the underlying Pt lattice.</p>
<p>An interesting observation was made when the MoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts reduced at 973 K was exposed to air before XAFS measurement. As shown in Fig. 6, the RSF for the Pt LIII-edge does not change compared with that for unexposed samples. In contrast, new peaks appears below 2 A in the RSF from the Mo K-edge, which could be assigned to the formation of molybdenum oxides. This is an indication that the molybdenum surrounds platinum core in the bimetallic cluster.</p>

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measurements of segregation kinetics and activation barriers from these techniques can be compared with DFT predictions for these systems. The coordination number of Pt in the Pt/γ-Al2O3 sample is smaller than that in the Pt foil, indicating that the Pt is well dispersed on the γ-Al2O3 support. The larger Debye Waller factor in the Pt/γ-Al2O3 sample suggests a more disordered structure of the supported Pt particles compared to bulk Pt. The unusual peaks in the RSF of Mo/γ-Al2O3 at distances of 12 A indicate the existence of light backscatterer atoms, suggesting an interaction between Mo and the support γ-Al2O3. The PtMo/γ-Al2O3 sample can be described as alloy clusters, where Pt is surrounded by Mo, leading to a smaller MoMo coordination number compared to PtPt. The MoMo distance is elongated to accommodate the underlying Pt lattice. When the MoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts reduced at 973 K are exposed to air before XAFS measurement, new peaks appear in the RSF of the Mo K-edge, indicating the formation of molybdenum oxides, which surround the Pt core in the bimetallic cluster.
