The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) technique has proven invaluable in elucidating the structure of supported catalysts, particularly those consisting of multiple components. Its ability to provide information on the local atomic arrangement around each type of absorbing atom, without the limitations of other probes, has led to its widespread application in the study of supported catalysts since the 1970s. This technique was employed in the study of PtMo bimetallic catalysts, utilizing equipment capable of generating a high-energy electron beam (2.5 GeV) with a maximum current of 360 mA. The analysis of the experimental data was conducted using the R-space method with the UWXAFS 3.0 package and FEFF 6 code. The fitting results for PtMo/γ -Al2O3 catalysts supported the presence of PtMo interactions, confirming the observations made.

X射线吸收精细结构（XAFS）技术在研究支持催化剂，尤其是多组分催化剂方面表现出了极大的价值。由于它能够提供关于每种吸收原子周围局部原子排列的信息，而不会受到其他探针的局限，因此自20世纪70年代以来，该技术已被广泛应用于支持催化剂的研究中。这项技术被用于研究PtMo双金属催化剂的研究中，利用能产生高能电子束（2.5 GeV）并具有最大电流360 mA的设备。实验数据的分析使用了UWXAFS 3.0包和FEFF 6代码的R空间方法进行。对PtMo/γ-Al2O3催化剂的拟合结果证实了PtMo相互作用的存在，支持了观察结果。

<p>The coordination number of PtPt in Pt/γ-Al2O3, which is smaller than that in Pt foil, indicates that platinum is well dispersed over the γ-Al2O3 support. Also, a larger Debye Waller factor suggests that the supported platinum particles have more disordered structure compared to bulk Pt. The difference in PtPt distance is small, but consistently shorter for supported samples.</p>
<p>Unlike the RSF of Pt/γ-Al2O3, the RSF of Mo/γ-Al2O3 shows unusual peaks in the distances of 12 A, indicating the existence of light backscatterer atoms. These peaks are not originated from the presence of molybdenum oxides in the samples, because RSF and XANES of MoO2 and MoO3 are markedly different from that of Mo/γ-Al2O3. The other possibility is the interaction between Mo and the support γ-Al2O3.</p>
<p>From the relative magnitudes of coordination numbers of four absorberscatterer pairs, the PtMo/γ-Al2O3 can be described as alloy clusters where platinum atoms are surrounded by molybdenum. Thus, the MoMo coordination number becomes smaller than PtPt because Mo is located at the outer surface region, while Pt resides near the core of the cluster. Furthermore, the MoMo distance is elongated to accommodate itself to the underlying Pt lattice.</p>
<p>An interesting observation was made when the MoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts reduced at 973 K was exposed to air before XAFS measurement. As shown in Fig. 6, the RSF for the Pt LIII-edge does not change compared with that for unexposed samples. In contrast, new peaks appears below 2 A in the RSF from the Mo K-edge, which could be assigned to the formation of molybdenum oxides. This is an indication that the molybdenum surrounds platinum core in the bimetallic cluster.</p>

EXPERIMENTAL
Sample Preparation
The materials for the catalyst preparation were (NH4)6Mo7O24 · 4H2O (Aldrich) and H2PtCl6 · 6H2O (Strem Chemicals, 38.85% Pt) as the metal precursors. The support for the metals was γ -Al2O3 (Alfa, 99%).

XAFS Measurements and Data Analysis
XAFS measurements for the samples in the sealed spectroscopic cell were performed on BL10B of Photon Factory (electron energy in the storage ring, 2.5 GeV; maximum current, 360 mA) in National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK) in Japan. At room temperature, the spectra were taken for K-edges of Mo with the detector gases of Ar(100%) for the incident beam and N2(85%) + Ar(15%) for the transmitted beam, and LIII-edges of Pt with detector gases of Ar(100%) and N2(75%) + Ar(15%), respectively.

CO Chemisorption
About 0.25 g of catalyst was loaded into a cell for chemisorption, reduced in flowing H2, and then purged with He at temperature slightly higher than the reduction temperature to remove all hydrogen adsorbed during the reduction.

CO Hydrogenation
Before the reaction, the catalysts were treated under the same pretreatment conditions as those for XAFS measurements. CO hydrogenation was carried out in a flow reactor at 573 K and atmospheric pressure with H2/CO feed ratio of 3.0.

RESULTS
CO Chemisorption and CO Hydrogenation
The result of CO Chemisorption for (Mo,Pt)/γ -Al2O3 is given in Table 1. The CO uptakes of Pt/γ -Al2O3 are generally large. However, CO uptakes of Mo/γ -Al2O3 are very small on three reduction temperatures, indicating the difficulty involved in the reduction of Mo/γ -Al2O3. For the bimetallic catalysts, CO uptakes stand between those of Pt/γ -Al2O3 and Mo/γ -Al2O3 and decrease slightly as the reduction temperature increases.

EXAFS and XANES of Monometallic Catalysts
The weighted EXAFS function k3χ(k) and RSF for Pt/γ -Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 2. The peak position and the shape in RSF are nearly same as those of Pt foil. The coordina- tion numbers of monometallic catalysts are all similar and substantially smaller than that of bulk platinum metal as shown in Table 2. The PtPt interatomic distance is con- sistently smaller than that of bulk Pt.

EXAFS and XANES of Bimetallic Catalysts
The results of curve fitting of PtMo/γ -Al2O3 summarized in Table 3 confirm this observation. The result is not consistent with that reported by Samant et al. who observed a single peak in RSF and same distance for PtPt, PtMo, and MoMo for PtMo/Y-zeolite catalysts prepared by the deposition of Mo(CO)6 vapor on Pt/Y-zeolite. They concluded that Mo was deposited epitaxially on Pt so that the MoMo and PtMo distances were identical to the PtPt distance. It is not clear if the difference stems from the different prepa- ration methods or from the improved resolution of data in the present study.

All bimetallic catalysts showed higher CO conversions and, in most cases, higher TOF values than monometal- lic catalysts for CO hydrogenation.

Experimental techniques such as XAFS, EXAFS, and XANES were utilized to study the structure of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The methods provided insights into the surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms like Ni and Co, quantifying their segregation kinetics and activation barriers. These experimental findings were compared against Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for the systems in question. The data showed that XAFS and EXAFS measurements allowed for the detection of surface segregation patterns, while XANES helped in determining the electronic states and oxidation levels of the segregated atoms. The comparison with DFT predictions enabled a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing the surface chemistry and reactivity of the bimetallic systems.

The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) has been of great use in studying the structure of supported catalysts, and of multicomponent catalysts in particular. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), which is one area of XAFS, contains information on local atomic arrangement about each individual type of absorber atom as described in theoretical formula based on the single contribution to XAFS (5). On the other hand, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), which represents electronic transitions from inner electronic levels to outer unoccupied levels caused by X-ray absorption, reveals information on the electronic structure of condensed matter, including differences in chemical environment, the oxidation state in complex, and so on (6, 7).
