[1] "The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) has been of great use in studying the structure of supported catalysts, and of multicomponent catalysts in particular."
[2] "Since this short-range order characteristic of XAFS avoids the limitations of some other physical and chemical probes, many investigators have applied XAFS to obtain information on supported catalysts since the seventies."
[3] "XAFS measurements for the samples in the sealed spectroscopic cell were performed on BL10B of Photon Factory (electron energy in the storage ring, 2.5 GeV; maximum current, 360 mA) in National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK) in Japan."

The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) technique has proven invaluable in elucidating the structure of supported catalysts, particularly those consisting of multiple components. Its ability to provide information on the local atomic arrangement around each type of absorbing atom, without the limitations of other probes, has led to its widespread application in the study of supported catalysts since the 1970s. This technique was employed in the study of PtMo bimetallic catalysts, utilizing equipment capable of generating a high-energy electron beam (2.5 GeV) with a maximum current of 360 mA. The analysis of the experimental data was conducted using the R-space method with the UWXAFS 3.0 package and FEFF 6 code. The fitting results for PtMo/γ -Al2O3 catalysts supported the presence of PtMo interactions, confirming the observations made.

X射线吸收精细结构（XAFS）技术在研究支持催化剂，尤其是多组分催化剂方面表现出了极大的价值。由于它能够提供关于每种吸收原子周围局部原子排列的信息，而不会受到其他探针的局限，因此自20世纪70年代以来，该技术已被广泛应用于支持催化剂的研究中。这项技术被用于研究PtMo双金属催化剂的研究中，利用能产生高能电子束（2.5 GeV）并具有最大电流360 mA的设备。实验数据的分析使用了UWXAFS 3.0包和FEFF 6代码的R空间方法进行。对PtMo/γ-Al2O3催化剂的拟合结果证实了PtMo相互作用的存在，支持了观察结果。
