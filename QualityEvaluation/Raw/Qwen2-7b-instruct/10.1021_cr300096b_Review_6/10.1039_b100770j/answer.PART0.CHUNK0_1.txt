<p>The main surface modification in catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) induced by the increase in the reduction temperature is the removal of residual chlorides. Fig. 9 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the P 2s and Cl 2p region, obtained after reduction at 673 K (a) and 773 K (b). These spectra reveal residual phosphorus, originating from the phosphine ligands in the platinum complex precursor. The XPS signal remains unchanged after reduction at 773 K. However, Fig. 9(a) shows that a relatively high amount of chlorides (Cl/Mg atomic ratio = 0.01) remains on this catalyst after reduction at 673 K. Note that no chlorides were detected by XPS in the bimetallic catalysts prepared from the bimetallic complex precursor, as reported elsewhere.26 Reduction at 773 K removes nearly completely the residual chlorides (Cl/Mg atomic ratio = 0.001) [Fig. 9(b)].</p>

<p>Answer: The increase in the reduction temperature from 673 K to 773 K leads to the removal of residual chlorides on catalyst 2PtSn(2.5). This is evident from the XPS spectra, where the Cl/Mg atomic ratio reduces from 0.01 after reduction at 673 K to 0.001 after reduction at 773 K. This removal of chlorides enhances the catalytic activity of the catalyst.</p>

答案：提高还原温度从673 K到773 K导致催化剂2PtSn(2.5)上残留氯化物的去除。这从XPS光谱中可以看出，其中Cl/Mg原子比在673 K下的还原后为0.01，而在773 K下的还原后降低至0.001。这种氯化物的去除显著提高了催化剂的催化活性。
