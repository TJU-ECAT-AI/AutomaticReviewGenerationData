<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The catalyst with larger bimetallic particles, having a higher surface concentration of oxidized tin species, showed the highest selectivity for producing the unsaturated alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol).
2. The catalyst prepared using separate metal precursors had a greater amount of residual chlorides, impacting its catalytic activity but only marginally affecting the selectivity for hydrogenating the carbonyl bond.
3. Figure 6 displays the evolution of selectivity to crotyl alcohol, measured as a percentage of molar fraction, as a function of the conversion degree during the reaction at 333 K, for all the MgO-supported catalysts.
4. Among the catalysts, only PtSn(2.5) demonstrated superior selectivity for hydrogenating the carbonyl bond.
5. Increasing the reduction temperature of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) from 673 K to 773 K led to the removal of a considerable amount of surface chlorides, resulting in an enhancement of catalytic activity and a slight improvement in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol.

1. 含有较大双金属颗粒的催化剂，表面氧化锡物种浓度较高，显示出最高的不饱和醇（但-2-烯-1-醇）选择性。
2. 使用单独金属前体制备的催化剂含有更多残余氯化物，显著影响其催化活性，但仅轻微改变氢化羰基键的选择性。
3. 图6展示了所有MgO支持催化剂在333 K下反应时转化度与选择性到丙烯醇（但-2-烯-1-醇）变化的关系，以摩尔分数百分比表示。
4. 只有PtSn(2.5)表现出对羰基键氢化的更高选择性。
5. 将催化剂2PtSn(2.5)的还原温度从673 K增加至773 K，导致表面氯化物的大量去除，催化活性显著提升，而选择性增加幅度较小。
