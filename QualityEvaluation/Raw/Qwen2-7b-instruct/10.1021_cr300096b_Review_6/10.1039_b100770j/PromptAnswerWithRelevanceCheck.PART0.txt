[1] "The selective vapour phase hydrogenation of the carbonyl (CO) bond in crotonaldehyde is strongly favoured in large PtSn particles. This has been attributed to the presence of a higher amount of surface oxidised tin species in these large particles, as evidenced by XPS."
[2] "The reduction of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) at a higher temperature (773 K) removes a significant amount of surface chlorides, which is paralleled by an increase in the catalytic activity, but only a slight increase in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The presence of a higher amount of surface oxidized tin species in large PtSn particles is attributed to the strong favoring of the selective vapor phase hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond in crotonaldehyde. This is supported by XPS evidence.
2. Increasing the reduction temperature of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) from 673 K to 773 K leads to the removal of a substantial amount of surface chlorides, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. The selectivity for crotyl alcohol experiences only a minor increase.

1. 在大PtSn颗粒中，表面氧化锡物种的数量较多，这是在选择性气相氢化反应中碳氧键在丙酮醛中的强烈优势的原因。这通过XPS证据得到了证实。
2. 将催化剂2PtSn(2.5)的还原温度从673K增加到773K导致表面氯化物的大量去除，从而提高了催化活性。对于丙烯醇的选择性仅略有增加。

<p>The main surface modification in catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) induced by the increase in the reduction temperature is the removal of residual chlorides. Fig. 9 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the P 2s and Cl 2p region, obtained after reduction at 673 K (a) and 773 K (b). These spectra reveal residual phosphorus, originating from the phosphine ligands in the platinum complex precursor. The XPS signal remains unchanged after reduction at 773 K. However, Fig. 9(a) shows that a relatively high amount of chlorides (Cl/Mg atomic ratio = 0.01) remains on this catalyst after reduction at 673 K. Note that no chlorides were detected by XPS in the bimetallic catalysts prepared from the bimetallic complex precursor, as reported elsewhere.26 Reduction at 773 K removes nearly completely the residual chlorides (Cl/Mg atomic ratio = 0.001) [Fig. 9(b)].</p>
</quotes>

<p>Answer: The increase in the reduction temperature from 673 K to 773 K leads to the removal of residual chlorides on catalyst 2PtSn(2.5). This is evident from the XPS spectra, where the Cl/Mg atomic ratio reduces from 0.01 after reduction at 673 K to 0.001 after reduction at 773 K. This removal of chlorides enhances the catalytic activity of the catalyst.</p>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答案：提高还原温度从673 K到773 K导致催化剂2PtSn(2.5)上残留氯化物的去除。这从XPS光谱中可以看出，其中Cl/Mg原子比在673 K下的还原后为0.01，而在773 K下的还原后降低至0.001。这种氯化物的去除显著提高了催化剂的催化活性。

3.1. Catalyst characterisation
The catalysts PtSn(2.5), PtSn(1.5), PtSn(0.25) and Pt(2.5) have been structurally and morphologically characterised elsewhere26 (Table 1). Briefly, sample PtSn(2.5) contains well-defined hexagonal PtSn alloy particles, as revealed by XRD, EDX, electron diffraction (ED) and high resolution electron microscopy (HREM), with a mean particle size of 12.7 nm; the same bimetallic phase is inferred in sample PtSn(1.5) from ED and HREM, with particles of about 3.8 nm; sample PtSn(0.25) contains metallic particles with an average size of 1.4 nm. In all cases CO singleton vibration frequency experiments confirmed the bimetallic nature of metallic particles with isolated Pt. Finally, sample Pt(2.5) contains Pt entities with a mean particle size of 1.5 nm, as determined by TEM.

3.2. Characterisation of catalysts after reaction
As discussed in the next section, all catalysts underwent deactivation under the reaction conditions used. The structural changes of sample PtSn(1.5) were monitored by TEM techniques. Before preparation for TEM, the sample resulting from the reaction test was treated under hydrogen at the reaction temperature, until no evolved products were detected by gas chromatography, to avoid contamination by adsorbed products. 

3.3. Catalytic behaviour
Five magnesia-supported catalysts were studied: monometallic Pt(2.5), prepared from cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2]; bimetallic PtSn(2.5), PtSn(1.5) and PtSn(0.25), prepared from the bimetallic complex cis-[PtCl(SnCl3)(PPh3)2]; and bimetallic 2PtSn(2.5), prepared from cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2] and SnCl2. The same precursors had been used to prepare alumina- and silica- supported catalysts.31 Thus, a first comparison between the catalytic behaviour of monometallic platinum catalysts with various supports seemed appropriate. Fig. 4 plots the activity (μmol of crotonaldehyde transformed per second per gram of Pt) as a function of time on-stream at 333 K for Pt/Al2O3, Pt/SiO2 and Pt/MgO [Pt(2.5) in this paper].

3.4. Effect of reduction temperature
As discussed above, the behaviour of the magnesia-supported platinum catalyst is similar to that of alumina- and silica- supported catalysts. However, selectivity for unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol, trans- and cis-3,7-dimethyl-6-octen-1-ol) as high as 70% in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal), with a Pt/MgO catalyst prepared from Pt(acac)2 and reduced at 773 K, has been reported.27 With a PtSn/MgO catalyst containing 1 wt% Pt and Sn/Pt = 0.5, and using a trickle-bed reactor at 373 K, an induction period of about 10 h was observed before complete conversion, with 97% selectivity for the unsaturated alcohols. No traces of deactivation were observed after 100 h on-stream.

A comparison of the XPS spectra obtained with catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) after reduction at 673 and 773 K reveals no change in the platinum or tin surface properties. Thus, the low increase in the reduction temperature modifies neither the Pt/Sn surface ratio nor the relative amount of surface oxidised tin. Furthermore, the binding energy of the Pt electrons remains unchanged: 71.0 eV, which indicates that the metalsupport interaction, if any, is too weak to be detected by a decrease in the binding energy of the Pt 4f7/2 level.
