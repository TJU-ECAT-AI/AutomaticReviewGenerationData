[1] "The selective vapour phase hydrogenation of the carbonyl (CO) bond in crotonaldehyde is strongly favoured in large PtSn particles. This has been attributed to the presence of a higher amount of surface oxidised tin species in these large particles, as evidenced by XPS."
[2] "The reduction of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) at a higher temperature (773 K) removes a significant amount of surface chlorides, which is paralleled by an increase in the catalytic activity, but only a slight increase in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol."

1. The presence of a higher amount of surface oxidized tin species in large PtSn particles is attributed to the strong favoring of the selective vapor phase hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond in crotonaldehyde. This is supported by XPS evidence.
2. Increasing the reduction temperature of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) from 673 K to 773 K leads to the removal of a substantial amount of surface chlorides, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. The selectivity for crotyl alcohol experiences only a minor increase.

1. 在大PtSn颗粒中，表面氧化锡物种的数量较多，这是在选择性气相氢化反应中碳氧键在丙酮醛中的强烈优势的原因。这通过XPS证据得到了证实。
2. 将催化剂2PtSn(2.5)的还原温度从673K增加到773K导致表面氯化物的大量去除，从而提高了催化活性。对于丙烯醇的选择性仅略有增加。
