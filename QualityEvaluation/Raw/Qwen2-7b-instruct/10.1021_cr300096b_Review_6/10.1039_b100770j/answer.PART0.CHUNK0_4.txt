[1] "The selective vapour phase hydrogenation of the carbonyl (CO) bond in crotonaldehyde is strongly favoured in large PtSn particles. This has been attributed to the presence of a higher amount of surface oxidised tin species in these large particles, as evidenced by XPS."
[2] "The reduction of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) at a higher temperature (773 K) removes a significant amount of surface chlorides, which is paralleled by an increase in the catalytic activity, but only a slight increase in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol."

1. The presence of larger PtSn particles in the catalyst favors the selective vapor phase hydrogenation of the carbonyl (CO) bond in crotonaldehyde, attributed to the higher surface concentration of oxidized tin species.
2. Raising the reduction temperature of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) to 773 K leads to the removal of surface chlorides, enhancing catalytic activity while modestly increasing the selectivity for crotyl alcohol.

1. 大PtSn颗粒在催化剂中有利于选择性蒸汽相氢化丙酮醛中的羰基(CO)键，归因于表面氧化锡物种的更高浓度。
2. 将催化剂2PtSn(2.5)的还原温度提高到773K导致表面氯化物的去除，提高了催化活性，同时轻微增加了对丙烯醇的选择性。
