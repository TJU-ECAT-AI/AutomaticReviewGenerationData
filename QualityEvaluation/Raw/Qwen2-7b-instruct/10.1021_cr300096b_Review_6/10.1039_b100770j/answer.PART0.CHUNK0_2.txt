3.1. Catalyst characterisation
The catalysts PtSn(2.5), PtSn(1.5), PtSn(0.25) and Pt(2.5) have been structurally and morphologically characterised elsewhere26 (Table 1). Briefly, sample PtSn(2.5) contains well-defined hexagonal PtSn alloy particles, as revealed by XRD, EDX, electron diffraction (ED) and high resolution electron microscopy (HREM), with a mean particle size of 12.7 nm; the same bimetallic phase is inferred in sample PtSn(1.5) from ED and HREM, with particles of about 3.8 nm; sample PtSn(0.25) contains metallic particles with an average size of 1.4 nm. In all cases CO singleton vibration frequency experiments confirmed the bimetallic nature of metallic particles with isolated Pt. Finally, sample Pt(2.5) contains Pt entities with a mean particle size of 1.5 nm, as determined by TEM.

3.2. Characterisation of catalysts after reaction
As discussed in the next section, all catalysts underwent deactivation under the reaction conditions used. The structural changes of sample PtSn(1.5) were monitored by TEM techniques. Before preparation for TEM, the sample resulting from the reaction test was treated under hydrogen at the reaction temperature, until no evolved products were detected by gas chromatography, to avoid contamination by adsorbed products. 

3.3. Catalytic behaviour
Five magnesia-supported catalysts were studied: monometallic Pt(2.5), prepared from cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2]; bimetallic PtSn(2.5), PtSn(1.5) and PtSn(0.25), prepared from the bimetallic complex cis-[PtCl(SnCl3)(PPh3)2]; and bimetallic 2PtSn(2.5), prepared from cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2] and SnCl2. The same precursors had been used to prepare alumina- and silica- supported catalysts.31 Thus, a first comparison between the catalytic behaviour of monometallic platinum catalysts with various supports seemed appropriate. Fig. 4 plots the activity (μmol of crotonaldehyde transformed per second per gram of Pt) as a function of time on-stream at 333 K for Pt/Al2O3, Pt/SiO2 and Pt/MgO [Pt(2.5) in this paper].

3.4. Effect of reduction temperature
As discussed above, the behaviour of the magnesia-supported platinum catalyst is similar to that of alumina- and silica- supported catalysts. However, selectivity for unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol, trans- and cis-3,7-dimethyl-6-octen-1-ol) as high as 70% in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal), with a Pt/MgO catalyst prepared from Pt(acac)2 and reduced at 773 K, has been reported.27 With a PtSn/MgO catalyst containing 1 wt% Pt and Sn/Pt = 0.5, and using a trickle-bed reactor at 373 K, an induction period of about 10 h was observed before complete conversion, with 97% selectivity for the unsaturated alcohols. No traces of deactivation were observed after 100 h on-stream.

A comparison of the XPS spectra obtained with catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) after reduction at 673 and 773 K reveals no change in the platinum or tin surface properties. Thus, the low increase in the reduction temperature modifies neither the Pt/Sn surface ratio nor the relative amount of surface oxidised tin. Furthermore, the binding energy of the Pt electrons remains unchanged: 71.0 eV, which indicates that the metalsupport interaction, if any, is too weak to be detected by a decrease in the binding energy of the Pt 4f7/2 level.

1. The catalysts PtSn(2.5), PtSn(1.5), PtSn(0.25), and Pt(2.5) were characterized structurally and morphologically by XRD, EDX, electron diffraction, and high resolution electron microscopy. PtSn(2.5) contained well-defined hexagonal PtSn alloy particles with a mean particle size of 12.7 nm. PtSn(1.5) particles were about 3.8 nm in size, while PtSn(0.25) contained metallic particles averaging 1.4 nm in size. The Pt(2.5) catalyst had Pt entities with a mean particle size of 1.5 nm, as determined by TEM.

2. After reaction, the structural changes of PtSn(1.5) were monitored using TEM techniques. The sample was treated under hydrogen at the reaction temperature to remove adsorbed products before TEM analysis.

3. The catalytic behavior of five magnesia-supported catalysts was studied. Monometallic Pt(2.5) and bimetallic PtSn(2.5), PtSn(1.5), and PtSn(0.25) were compared with alumina- and silica-supported catalysts. The activity of the catalysts was plotted against time on-stream at 333 K.

4. The reduction temperature affected the catalysts' behavior. Catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) showed improved activity when reduced at 773 K, but there was only a slight increase in selectivity for crotyl alcohol.
