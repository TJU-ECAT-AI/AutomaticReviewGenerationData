<p>Several studies have been made for developing suitable catalytic systems able to selectively hydrogenate α-,β-unsaturated aldehydes into unsaturated alcohols (UA).</p>

<p>For both Rh and Pt series, the unsaturated alcohols (UA) selectivity goes through an optimum as a function of the germanium content whatever the reduction temperature.</p>
<p>At low Ge contents, the higher selectivities were obtained after reduction at 500 C when the bimetallic and SMSI effects are combined. In this case, both oxidized Ge and TiO(2x) species participate to the activation of the CO bond.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for higher Ge loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a reduction at 500 C led to lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reduction at 300 C. The bimetallic effect is then predominant at high Ge loadings.</p>
<p>As a consequence, for the bimetallic catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C), the optimum for the UA selectivity was obtained at lower germanium contents compared to their counterparts reduced at 300 C.</p>

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are not mentioned in the literature, hence no specific quotes regarding their application in the context of verifying and quantifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems can be found. Therefore, no relevant quotes exist for this question.

The catalytic properties of bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral. The germanium content affected the selectivity of unsaturated alcohols (UA) produced. The selectivity reached an optimum with the germanium content, depending on the reduction temperature. The bimetallic effect was predominant at higher germanium loadings. The stability of the bimetallic particles on the TiO2 support was noted, contrasting with supports like alumina or silica.

The stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on TiO2 support was noteworthy, differing from those on alumina or silica supports.

在文献中没有提及实验技术如HREELS和AES，因此无法找到与验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中表面氧诱导亚表面3d原子的表面分离相关的具体引用。因此，不存在与此问题相关的引用。

在文献中测试了以氧化钛为载体的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂的催化性质，用于选择性氢化丙酮酸生成不饱和醇。德国含量影响了产生的不饱和醇的选择性。选择性随着德国含量的增加而达到最优，取决于还原温度。双金属效果在较高的德国负载下占主导地位。TiO2载体上制备的双金属粒子的稳定性值得注意，这与氧化铝或硅胶支持不同。
