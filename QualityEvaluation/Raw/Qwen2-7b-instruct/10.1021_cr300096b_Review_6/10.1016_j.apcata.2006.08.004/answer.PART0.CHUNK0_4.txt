The addition of germanium- to titania-supported 1 wt% Rh or 1 wt% Pt catalysts strongly modified their catalytic properties. For both Rh and Pt based samples, the selectivity in geraniol and nerol (UA) goes through a maximum as function of the Ge content whatever the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C). At low Ge contents, the higher selectivities were obtained after reduction at 500 C when the bimetallic and SMSI effects are combined. In this case, both oxidized Ge and TiO(2x) species participate to the activation of the CO bond. On the other hand, for higher Ge loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a reduction at 500 C led to lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reduction at 300 C. The bimetallic effect is then predominant at high Ge loadings. As a consequence, for the bimetallic catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C), the optimum for the UA selectivity was obtained at lower germanium contents compared to their counterparts reduced at 300 C.
Moreover, the stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on TiO2 support is noteworthy contrary to that obtained with an alumina or a silica support.

1. The addition of germanium to titania-supported 1 wt% Rh or 1 wt% Pt catalysts significantly altered their catalytic properties. The selectivity for geraniol and nerol (unsaturated alcohols) peaks with the germanium content, regardless of the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C). At low germanium contents, higher selectivities are achieved after a 500 C reduction, combining the bimetallic and SMSI effects. Both oxidized germanium and TiO(2x) species contribute to the activation of the CO bond. Conversely, for higher germanium loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a 500 C reduction yields lower UA selectivities compared to a 300 C reduction. The bimetallic effect becomes dominant at high germanium loadings. Consequently, for bimetallic catalysts reduced at 500 C, the optimal UA selectivity is achieved with lower germanium contents compared to those reduced at 300 C. Additionally, the stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared via catalytic reduction on TiO2 support is noteworthy, contrasting with alumina or silica supports.

1. 向钛酸盐支持的1 wt% Rh或1 wt% Pt催化剂中添加锗显著改变了它们的催化性能。无论还原温度（300或500 C），二元合金和SMSI效应结合时，geraniol和nerol（不饱和醇）的选择性在锗含量下达到峰值。在较低锗含量下，通过500 C还原可以获得更高的选择性。在这种情况下，氧化锗和TiO(2x)物种共同激活CO键。相反，对于较高的锗负载量（Rh为1.3 wt%，Pt为0.5 wt%），500 C还原导致的UA选择性低于300 C还原的结果。在高锗负载下，二元合金效果占主导地位。因此，对于在500 C还原的二元合金催化剂，获得最佳UA选择性的锗含量低于在300 C还原的催化剂。此外，通过催化还原在TiO2支持上制备的Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge粒子的稳定性值得注意，与氧化铝或硅胶相比。
