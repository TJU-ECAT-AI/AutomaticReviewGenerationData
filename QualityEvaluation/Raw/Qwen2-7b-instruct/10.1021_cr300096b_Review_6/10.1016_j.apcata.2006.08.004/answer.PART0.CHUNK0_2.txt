Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2 for citral hydrogenation: II. Catalytic properties
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses the development and testing of bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide for the selective hydrogenation of citral. The catalysts were prepared using a surface redox reaction method. The study found that the addition of germanium to these catalysts significantly altered their catalytic properties. The selectivity for unsaturated alcohols increased as a function of germanium content, regardless of the reduction temperature. At lower germanium loadings, a combination of the bimetallic and SMSI effects led to a high selectivity for unsaturated alcohols. However, at higher germanium loadings, the bimetallic effect dominated, resulting in a high selectivity for unsaturated alcohols as well. The stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on the TiO2 support was also noted, contrasting with that observed on alumina or silica supports.

文献讨论了在TiO2上支持的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂用于丁香醇氢化的选择性。催化剂通过表面氧化还原反应方法制备。研究发现，向这些催化剂中添加锗显著改变了它们的催化性能。不饱和醇的选择性随着锗含量的增加而增加，无论还原温度如何。在较低锗负载下，结合了双金属和SMSI效应，导致高选择性不饱和醇。然而，在较高锗负载下，双金属效应占主导地位，同样导致高选择性不饱和醇。还注意到双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge粒子在TiO2上的催化还原稳定性，这与在氧化铝或硅胶上观察到的稳定性形成对比。
