1. The study investigated the performance of bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2 for the selective hydrogenation of citral. The catalysts were prepared through a surface redox reaction and subjected to reduction at either 300°C or 500°C. The germanium content significantly influenced the catalysts' ability to selectively produce unsaturated alcohols (UA).

2. Regardless of the reduction temperature, the UA selectivity showed an optimum as a function of the germanium loading. For lower germanium concentrations, the combination of the bimetallic effect and the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) led to high UA selectivity. At higher germanium loadings, the bimetallic effect dominated and also resulted in high UA selectivity.

3. The TiO2 support played a crucial role in stabilizing the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles produced via catalytic reduction, ensuring their functionality even when exposed to air at room temperature.

1. 研究评估了TiO2支持的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂在丙酮酸氢化中的选择性氢化。催化剂通过表面氧化还原反应制备，并在300°C或500°C下进行还原。锗含量对催化剂产生不饱和醇（UA）的能力有显著影响。

2. 不论还原温度，UA的选择性随锗负载量的变化达到最优值。对于较低的锗浓度，结合双金属效应和强金属-支撑相互作用（SMSI），可获得高UA选择性。在较高锗负载时，双金属效应占主导地位，同样导致高UA选择性。

3. TiO2支撑在稳定由催化还原产生的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge颗粒方面发挥了关键作用，确保了即使在室温下的空气暴露也能保持其功能。

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are not mentioned in the literature, hence no specific quotes regarding their application in the context of verifying and quantifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems can be found. Therefore, no relevant quotes exist for this question.

The catalytic properties of bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral. The germanium content affected the selectivity of unsaturated alcohols (UA) produced. The selectivity reached an optimum with the germanium content, depending on the reduction temperature. The bimetallic effect was predominant at higher germanium loadings. The stability of the bimetallic particles on the TiO2 support was noted, contrasting with supports like alumina or silica.

在文献中没有提及实验技术如HREELS和AES，因此无法找到与验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中表面氧诱导亚表面3d原子的表面分离相关的具体引用。因此，不存在与此问题相关的引用。

在文献中测试了以氧化钛为载体的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂的催化性质，用于选择性氢化丙酮酸生成不饱和醇。德国含量影响了产生的不饱和醇的选择性。选择性随着德国含量的增加而达到最优，取决于还原温度。双金属效果在较高的德国负载下占主导地位。TiO2载体上制备的双金属粒子的稳定性值得注意，这与氧化铝或硅胶支持不同。

<p>Several studies have been made for developing suitable catalytic systems able to selectively hydrogenate α-,β-unsaturated aldehydes into unsaturated alcohols (UA). The selectivity to UA is highly dependant on the nature of the precious metal used as a catalyst. Monometallic catalysts of both Rh and Pt supported on alumina or silica generally revealed a poor selectivity to UA. However, addition of different modifiers (Sn, Ge, ) on these monometallic systems allowed one to improve the selective hydrogenation of CO bond [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] . In previous works, we have prepared bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts by surface redox reaction for the selective hydrogenation of citral towards unsaturated alcohols [5] ,[6] . The catalyst supports used were alumina and silica. The addition of germanium to rhodium catalysts effectively improved the reaction selectivity towards UA. This effect was more obvious on alumina-supported catalysts on which the UA selectivity reached a maximum near 75% in isopropanol as solvent. However, the air exposure at ambient temperature of these bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts resulted in an irreversible modification of the metallic phase which induced a drop in their catalytic properties for citral hydrogenation [6] ,[7] .</p>
<p>The purpose of the present work was to extend our previous studies to another support, the titania oxide. In fact, this reducible support that presents the strong metalsupport interaction effect (SMSI effect) has been successfully used with monometallic catalysts (Pt based generally) to increase the selectivity to the CO group hydrogenation of various unsaturated aldehydes [8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] . Moreover, several authors have observed a promoting effect of the modification of Pt, Ir or Ru monometallic catalysts supported on TiO2 by Fe, Ge or Sn for the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (citral, cinnamaldehyde and crotonaldehyde specially) [17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] . On these bimetallic catalysts prepared by coimpregnation or successive impregnation, it was proposed that the presence of ionic species, such as promoters (Feδ+, Geδ+, ) or species generated upon reduction at high temperature of the reducible TiO2 support (i.e., TiO(2x) moieties) led to catalysts highly selective for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond. A cumulative effect of the titania support with the promoter was proposed in some cases.</p>
<p>In this paper, bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction were tested in selective hydrogenation of citral with the aim of combining the bimetallic effect and the reducible support effect.</p>

The document discusses the development of bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide for the selective hydrogenation of citral. The catalysts were prepared via a surface redox reaction, and their properties were evaluated. The text mentions that the addition of germanium to the rhodium catalysts improved the reaction selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols. However, exposure to air at room temperature caused irreversible modifications in the metallic phase, leading to a decline in the catalytic properties for citral hydrogenation. The titania oxide support was chosen because of its strong metal-support interaction effect (SMSI effect), which has been successful in increasing the selectivity for CO group hydrogenation of various unsaturated aldehydes. The text also references previous studies where the modification of Pt, Ir, or Ru monometallic catalysts supported on TiO2 by Fe, Ge, or Sn led to highly selective catalysts for hydrogenating the carbonyl bond. The goal of the current work was to combine the bimetallic effect and the reducible support effect in the citral hydrogenation process.

本文讨论了在钛酸盐氧化物上制备双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂，用于选择性氢化异戊醛。催化剂通过表面还原反应制备，并对其性质进行了评估。文中提到，向铑催化剂中添加锗可以提高对不饱和醇的选择性。然而，在室温下暴露于空气会导致金属相不可逆的修改，导致催化性能下降。由于其强烈的金属-载体相互作用效应（SMSI效应），钛酸盐氧化物支持被选为载体，这种效应在提高各种不饱和醛的CO组氢化选择性方面已被成功应用。文中还引用了先前的研究，其中通过Fe、Ge或Sn等离子体（Feδ+、Geδ+等）或在高温下还原可还原TiO2支持产生的物种对Pt、Ir或Ru单金属催化剂进行修饰，可得到高度选择性的催化剂，用于氢化羰基键。在某些情况下，提出了支持物与促进剂的累积效应。本文的目标是在异戊醛氢化过程中结合双金属效应和可还原支持效应。

The addition of germanium- to titania-supported 1 wt% Rh or 1 wt% Pt catalysts strongly modified their catalytic properties. For both Rh and Pt based samples, the selectivity in geraniol and nerol (UA) goes through a maximum as function of the Ge content whatever the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C). At low Ge contents, the higher selectivities were obtained after reduction at 500 C when the bimetallic and SMSI effects are combined. In this case, both oxidized Ge and TiO(2x) species participate to the activation of the CO bond. On the other hand, for higher Ge loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a reduction at 500 C led to lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reduction at 300 C. The bimetallic effect is then predominant at high Ge loadings. As a consequence, for the bimetallic catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C), the optimum for the UA selectivity was obtained at lower germanium contents compared to their counterparts reduced at 300 C.
Moreover, the stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on TiO2 support is noteworthy contrary to that obtained with an alumina or a silica support.

1. The addition of germanium to titania-supported 1 wt% Rh or 1 wt% Pt catalysts significantly altered their catalytic properties. The selectivity for geraniol and nerol (unsaturated alcohols) peaks with the germanium content, regardless of the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C). At low germanium contents, higher selectivities are achieved after a 500 C reduction, combining the bimetallic and SMSI effects. Both oxidized germanium and TiO(2x) species contribute to the activation of the CO bond. Conversely, for higher germanium loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a 500 C reduction yields lower UA selectivities compared to a 300 C reduction. The bimetallic effect becomes dominant at high germanium loadings. Consequently, for bimetallic catalysts reduced at 500 C, the optimal UA selectivity is achieved with lower germanium contents compared to those reduced at 300 C. Additionally, the stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared via catalytic reduction on TiO2 support is noteworthy, contrasting with alumina or silica supports.

1. 向钛酸盐支持的1 wt% Rh或1 wt% Pt催化剂中添加锗显著改变了它们的催化性能。无论还原温度（300或500 C），二元合金和SMSI效应结合时，geraniol和nerol（不饱和醇）的选择性在锗含量下达到峰值。在较低锗含量下，通过500 C还原可以获得更高的选择性。在这种情况下，氧化锗和TiO(2x)物种共同激活CO键。相反，对于较高的锗负载量（Rh为1.3 wt%，Pt为0.5 wt%），500 C还原导致的UA选择性低于300 C还原的结果。在高锗负载下，二元合金效果占主导地位。因此，对于在500 C还原的二元合金催化剂，获得最佳UA选择性的锗含量低于在300 C还原的催化剂。此外，通过催化还原在TiO2支持上制备的Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge粒子的稳定性值得注意，与氧化铝或硅胶相比。
