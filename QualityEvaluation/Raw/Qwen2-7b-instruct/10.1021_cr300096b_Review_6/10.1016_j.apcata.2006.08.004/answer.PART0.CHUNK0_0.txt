1. The study investigated the performance of bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2 for the selective hydrogenation of citral. The catalysts were prepared through a surface redox reaction and subjected to reduction at either 300°C or 500°C. The germanium content significantly influenced the catalysts' ability to selectively produce unsaturated alcohols (UA).

2. Regardless of the reduction temperature, the UA selectivity showed an optimum as a function of the germanium loading. For lower germanium concentrations, the combination of the bimetallic effect and the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) led to high UA selectivity. At higher germanium loadings, the bimetallic effect dominated and also resulted in high UA selectivity.

3. The TiO2 support played a crucial role in stabilizing the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles produced via catalytic reduction, ensuring their functionality even when exposed to air at room temperature.

1. 研究评估了TiO2支持的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂在丙酮酸氢化中的选择性氢化。催化剂通过表面氧化还原反应制备，并在300°C或500°C下进行还原。锗含量对催化剂产生不饱和醇（UA）的能力有显著影响。

2. 不论还原温度，UA的选择性随锗负载量的变化达到最优值。对于较低的锗浓度，结合双金属效应和强金属-支撑相互作用（SMSI），可获得高UA选择性。在较高锗负载时，双金属效应占主导地位，同样导致高UA选择性。

3. TiO2支撑在稳定由催化还原产生的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge颗粒方面发挥了关键作用，确保了即使在室温下的空气暴露也能保持其功能。
