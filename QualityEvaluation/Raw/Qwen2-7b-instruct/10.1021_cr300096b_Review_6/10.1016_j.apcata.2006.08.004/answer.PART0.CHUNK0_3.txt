<p>Several studies have been made for developing suitable catalytic systems able to selectively hydrogenate α-,β-unsaturated aldehydes into unsaturated alcohols (UA). The selectivity to UA is highly dependant on the nature of the precious metal used as a catalyst. Monometallic catalysts of both Rh and Pt supported on alumina or silica generally revealed a poor selectivity to UA. However, addition of different modifiers (Sn, Ge, ) on these monometallic systems allowed one to improve the selective hydrogenation of CO bond [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] . In previous works, we have prepared bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts by surface redox reaction for the selective hydrogenation of citral towards unsaturated alcohols [5] ,[6] . The catalyst supports used were alumina and silica. The addition of germanium to rhodium catalysts effectively improved the reaction selectivity towards UA. This effect was more obvious on alumina-supported catalysts on which the UA selectivity reached a maximum near 75% in isopropanol as solvent. However, the air exposure at ambient temperature of these bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts resulted in an irreversible modification of the metallic phase which induced a drop in their catalytic properties for citral hydrogenation [6] ,[7] .</p>
<p>The purpose of the present work was to extend our previous studies to another support, the titania oxide. In fact, this reducible support that presents the strong metalsupport interaction effect (SMSI effect) has been successfully used with monometallic catalysts (Pt based generally) to increase the selectivity to the CO group hydrogenation of various unsaturated aldehydes [8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] . Moreover, several authors have observed a promoting effect of the modification of Pt, Ir or Ru monometallic catalysts supported on TiO2 by Fe, Ge or Sn for the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (citral, cinnamaldehyde and crotonaldehyde specially) [17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] . On these bimetallic catalysts prepared by coimpregnation or successive impregnation, it was proposed that the presence of ionic species, such as promoters (Feδ+, Geδ+, ) or species generated upon reduction at high temperature of the reducible TiO2 support (i.e., TiO(2x) moieties) led to catalysts highly selective for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond. A cumulative effect of the titania support with the promoter was proposed in some cases.</p>
<p>In this paper, bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction were tested in selective hydrogenation of citral with the aim of combining the bimetallic effect and the reducible support effect.</p>

The document discusses the development of bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide for the selective hydrogenation of citral. The catalysts were prepared via a surface redox reaction, and their properties were evaluated. The text mentions that the addition of germanium to the rhodium catalysts improved the reaction selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols. However, exposure to air at room temperature caused irreversible modifications in the metallic phase, leading to a decline in the catalytic properties for citral hydrogenation. The titania oxide support was chosen because of its strong metal-support interaction effect (SMSI effect), which has been successful in increasing the selectivity for CO group hydrogenation of various unsaturated aldehydes. The text also references previous studies where the modification of Pt, Ir, or Ru monometallic catalysts supported on TiO2 by Fe, Ge, or Sn led to highly selective catalysts for hydrogenating the carbonyl bond. The goal of the current work was to combine the bimetallic effect and the reducible support effect in the citral hydrogenation process.

本文讨论了在钛酸盐氧化物上制备双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂，用于选择性氢化异戊醛。催化剂通过表面还原反应制备，并对其性质进行了评估。文中提到，向铑催化剂中添加锗可以提高对不饱和醇的选择性。然而，在室温下暴露于空气会导致金属相不可逆的修改，导致催化性能下降。由于其强烈的金属-载体相互作用效应（SMSI效应），钛酸盐氧化物支持被选为载体，这种效应在提高各种不饱和醛的CO组氢化选择性方面已被成功应用。文中还引用了先前的研究，其中通过Fe、Ge或Sn等离子体（Feδ+、Geδ+等）或在高温下还原可还原TiO2支持产生的物种对Pt、Ir或Ru单金属催化剂进行修饰，可得到高度选择性的催化剂，用于氢化羰基键。在某些情况下，提出了支持物与促进剂的累积效应。本文的目标是在异戊醛氢化过程中结合双金属效应和可还原支持效应。
