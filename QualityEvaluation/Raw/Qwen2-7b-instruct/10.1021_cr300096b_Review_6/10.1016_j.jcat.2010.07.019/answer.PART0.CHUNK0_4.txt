<p>Most of the studies are devoted to the partial hydrogenation of the simplest diene, 1,3-butadiene, into butene.</p>
<p>The following conclusions arose from these various works: Pd is almost totally selective in butene, whereas Pt leads to a mixture of butene and butane, the latter being partly formed as primary product of the reaction.</p>
<p>The role of tin is dual: a role of site blocking that forces unselective pathways to adopt distorted, high-energy transition states and a role of ligand that weakens the molecular adsorption and allows decoordination of double bonds prior to the hydrogenation, which decreases the energy barriers for the selective pathway to butene.</p>
<p>Compared to the reference catalyst Pt(1 1 1), there is a change both in geometries and in relative energies: for instance, the best adsorption mode of butadiene is cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p, while it is trans 1,2,3,4-tetra-r on Pt(1 1 1).</p>
<p>On the alloy, all the adsorption energies are reduced compared to pure platinum, and the adsorption structures implying many PtAC bonds are more destabilized.</p>
<p>The different pathways leading to partial hydrogenation products (1-butene, 2-butene) or other intermediate surface species (1,3- and 1,4-metallacycles) have been explored.</p>
<p>The role of tin is dual: a role of site blocking that forces unselective pathways to adopt distorted, high-energy transition states and a role of ligand that weakens the molecular adsorption and allows decoordination of double bonds prior to the hydrogenation, which decreases the energy barriers for the selective pathway to butene.</p>
<p>Tin plays a dual role. First, a role of site blocking: since hydrogen tends to avoid the tin atoms, some transition states are distored, which increases the corresponding energy barriers. Secondly and mainly, its ligand effect on the Pt surface atoms decreases the strength of the PtAC bonds, which allows the decoordination of the double bond in the intermediates leading to 1- and 2-butenes, reducing the activation barrier.</p>

1. Most studies focus on the partial hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene to butene.
2. Pd shows almost total selectivity for butene, while Pt produces a mixture of butene and butane, with butane being the primary product.
3. Tin in the catalyst affects the hydrogenation pathways by blocking active sites and weakening the adsorption of molecules.
4. The adsorption mode of butadiene changes when interacting with the Pt/Sn alloy surface.
5. Adsorption energies are reduced on the Pt/Sn alloy compared to pure platinum.
6. Various hydrogenation pathways for butadiene have been explored.
7. Tin has a dual role in the Pt/Sn alloy, blocking unselective pathways and weakening adsorption to allow easier decoordination of double bonds.
8. The dual role of tin in the Pt/Sn alloy enhances the selectivity towards butene by blocking unselective pathways and facilitating the hydrogenation process.

1. 大多数研究集中在1,3-丁二烯的部分氢化到丁烯。
2. Pd几乎完全选择性地生成丁烯，而Pt则产生混合物的丁烯和丁烷，其中丁烷作为主要产物形成。
3. 锡在催化剂中的作用是双重的：通过位点阻塞迫使非选择性路径采用失稳的高能过渡态，以及通过配体效应减弱分子吸附，允许双键在氢化之前解离，从而降低选择性路径到丁烯的能量壁垒。
4. 与Pt(1 1 1)表面相比，但烯在Pt/Sn合金表面的吸附模式发生了变化。
5. 合金表面的吸附能相对于纯铂有所降低。
6. 探索了各种但烯的氢化步骤。
7. 锡在Pt/Sn合金中具有双重作用，通过位点阻塞阻止非选择性路径，并通过配体效应减弱吸附以允许双键在氢化之前解离，从而降低生成1-和2-丁烯的活化壁垒。
8. 锡在Pt/Sn合金中的双重作用通过阻止非选择性路径并促进氢化过程来增强对丁烯的选择性。
