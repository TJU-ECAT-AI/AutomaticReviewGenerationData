<p>Highly selective hydrogenation of butadiene on Pt/Sn alloy elucidated by first-principles calculations</p>
<p>Reaction pathways have been explored with periodic DFT calculations in order to understand the origin of the high selectivity for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30 surface alloy.</p>
<p>Compared to the reference catalyst Pt(1 1 1), there is a change both in geometries and in relative energies: for instance, the best adsorption mode of butadiene is cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p, while it is trans 1,2,3,4-tetra-r on Pt(1 1 1).</p>
<p>The adsorption energies on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) are much smaller than on Pt(1 1 1). A decrease of 76 kJ mol1 is observed for butadiene, of 52 kJ mol1 for 1-butene and of 51 kJ mol1 for 2-butene.</p>
<p>In the case of the alloy, the first hydrogenation at a central carbon is inhibited and only hydrogenation at a terminal carbon can occur, whereas on Pt(1 1 1), they are competitive.</p>
<p>Tin plays a dual role: a role of site blocking that forces unselective pathways to adopt distorted, high-energy transition states and a role of ligand that weakens the molecular adsorption and allows decoordination of double bonds prior to the hydrogenation, which decreases the energy barriers for the selective pathway to butene.</p>

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by measuring the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. The measured values are compared with DFT predictions to validate the theoretical models. The differences between the experimental results and DFT predictions can indicate limitations of the current theoretical approaches or additional physical phenomena not captured by the calculations.

实验技术如HREELS和AES通过测量表面迁移率和激活能壁垒来验证并量化氧诱导的表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的分布。测量的结果与DFT预测进行比较，以验证理论模型的有效性。实验结果与计算预测之间的差异可能表明当前理论方法的局限性或未捕捉到的物理现象。
