<p>The adsorption energies on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) are much smaller. A decrease of 76 kJ mol1 is observed for butadiene (74 vs. 150 kJ mol1 for the cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p form), of 52 kJ mol1 for 1-butene and of 51 kJ mol1 for 2-butene. The calculated adsorption energies of butadiene and 1-butene on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) (74 and 49 kJ mol1) are in very good agreement with the values deduced from TPD experiments (75 and 54 kJ mol1, respectively) [32,33]. Such a decrease in the adsorption energy of alkenes on the Pt/Sn alloys compared to pure Pt has been observed experimentally [33] and has been explained by DFT calculations [31,35]. The occupied d-band center is lower below the Fermi level for Pt2Sn (2.57 eV) than for Pt (2.39 eV) [35]. This results in a smaller interaction with the p system of the adsorbed molecules. Moreover, an electron transfer occurs from Sn to Pt, and the surface Pt atoms are more negatively charged on the alloy, which induces larger Pauli repulsions.</p>

The adsorption energies on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) alloy are significantly lower compared to pure platinum. For butadiene, the adsorption energy drops from 150 kJ/mol for the cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p form to 74 kJ/mol. Similarly, the energies for 1-butene and 2-butene decrease to 49 kJ/mol and 25 kJ/mol, respectively. These values align well with the results from thermodesorption experiments. The reduction in adsorption energy is attributed to the lower d-band center of the Pt2Sn alloy, which results in a lesser interaction with the π electrons of the alkenes. Additionally, an electron transfer from tin to platinum leads to a more negative charge on the surface Pt atoms, enhancing Pauli repulsion and contributing to the observed decrease in adsorption energy.

在Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)合金上吸附的能量显著低于纯铂。对于丁二烯，吸附能量从150 kJ/mol（cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p形式）降至74 kJ/mol。同样，1-丁烯和2-丁烯的能量分别降低到49 kJ/mol和25 kJ/mol。这些结果与热解吸实验的结果相吻合。吸附能量的减少归因于Pt2Sn合金较低的d带中心，这导致与烯烃的π电子的较弱相互作用。此外，从锡到铂的电子转移导致表面Pt原子的负电荷增加，增强了Pauli排斥，从而促进了观察到的吸附能量降低。

<p>On the alloy, the systematic marked weakening of the adsorption significantly shifts the stability domains to lower temperature regions. The major consequence is a weak adsorption for butadiene in the 360 K region and a spontaneous desorption of the butenes from the surface alloy, without possible further hydrogenation, as soon as these products are formed during the reaction.</p>

On the alloy, the pronounced decrease in adsorption strength leads to a significant shift in stability regions to lower temperature zones. The primary outcome is a weak adsorption of butadiene at 360 K, followed by the spontaneous desorption of the butenes from the surface alloy without further hydrogenation once these products are formed during the reaction.

<p>Tin plays a dual role. First, a role of site blocking: since hydrogen tends to avoid the tin atoms, some transition states are distorted,which increases the corresponding energy barriers.
Secondly and mainly, its ligand effect on the Pt surface atoms decreases the strength of the PtAC bonds, which allows the decoordination of the double bond in the intermediates leading to 1- and 2- butenes, reducing the activation barrier.</p>

Tin serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it acts as a site blocker: hydrogen's tendency to avoid tin atoms causes distortion in certain transition states, thereby increasing their energy barriers. Secondly, and more importantly, the ligand effect of tin on the Pt surface atoms weakens the PtAC bonds. This facilitates the partial decoordination of the double bond in intermediates leading to 1- and 2-butenes, thus lowering the activation barrier.

锡具有双重作用。首先，它充当一个站点阻止器：由于氢倾向于避开锡原子，某些过渡状态发生扭曲，导致其能垒增加。其次，更重要的是，锡对铂表面原子的配体效应削弱了PtAC键。这使得1-和2-丁烯中间体中的双键部分解离成为可能，从而降低了活化能垒。
