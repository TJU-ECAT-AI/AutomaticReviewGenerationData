<p>The following conclusions arose from these various works: Pd is almost totally selective in butene, whereas Pt leads to a mixture of butene and butane, the latter being partly formed as primary product of the reaction.</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, we have explored the path- ways for butadiene hydrogenation on the Pt/Sn surface alloys,more precisely on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30 on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</p>
<p>Hence, in order to resolve this point, we have explored the possible hydrogenation pathways on the alloy.</p>
<p>Hence, the behavior of the trans isomer of butadiene is the same as that of the cis isomer. Further steps have not been considered so far.</p>
<p>Tin plays a dual role. First, a role of site blocking: since hydro- gen tends to avoid the tin atoms, some transition states are dis- torted,which increases the corresponding energy barriers.</p>

1. Palladium (Pd) shows almost total selectivity in the formation of butene, while platinum (Pt) results in a mixture of butene and butane, with butane partly formed as the primary product of the reaction.

2. The selectivity and pathways for butadiene hydrogenation on Pt/Sn alloy surfaces, specifically the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30 surface, have been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

3. This investigation was undertaken to address the issue of selectivity enhancement on these alloy surfaces.

4. The behavior of the cis isomer of butadiene mirrors that of the trans isomer. No further steps beyond these have been analyzed.

5. Tin's role is twofold: it impedes the formation of certain transition states by blocking sites, and it weakens the PtAC bonds through an electronic effect, facilitating the decoordination of double bonds for pathways leading to butene formation.

1. 钯(Pd)几乎完全选择性地生成丁烯，而铂(Pt)导致丁烯和丁烷的混合物，后者部分作为反应的主要产物形成。

2. 对于在Pt/Sn合金表面（特别是Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30表面）上丁二烯氢化的选择性和途径进行了研究，使用了密度泛函理论(DFT)计算。

3. 这项研究旨在解决这些合金表面选择性增强的问题。

4. 丁二烯异构体的行为与丁二烯异构体相同。尚未考虑进一步步骤。

5. 锡的作用是双重的：首先，由于氢倾向于避开锡原子，某些过渡态被扭曲，相应地增加了能量壁垒；其次，通过电子效应减弱PtAC键，促进双键的解离，为生成丁烯的途径提供了便利。
