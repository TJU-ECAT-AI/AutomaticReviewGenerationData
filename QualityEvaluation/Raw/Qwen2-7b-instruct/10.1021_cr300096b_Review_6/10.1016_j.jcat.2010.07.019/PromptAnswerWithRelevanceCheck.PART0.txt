How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

The most commonly admitted interpretation of this different behavior rests on the different competitive adsorption energies of butadiene and butenes on the two metals. To verify this assumption, the adsorption structures of 1,3-butadiene and of butenes (1- and 2-butene) have been investigated by theoretical calculations [12 14]. In the two latter papers, the difference between the adsorption energies of butadiene and butenes has been found very similar on Pt and Pd and hence it cannot account for the observed selectivity.

Moreover, the formation of butane as a primary product cannot be explained by considering only reaction thermodynamics.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The adsorption energies of butadiene and butenes on platinum and palladium have been theoretically calculated to check if their differences can explain the selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. The calculated differences were found to be similar on both metals, suggesting they do not fully account for the observed preference for butene formation over butane.

Formation of butane as the main product is not solely due to thermodynamics.

但烯和异丁烷在铂和钯上的吸附能的理论计算显示，它们之间的差异与观察到的选择性不能完全解释。计算出的差异在两种金属上非常相似，这意味着它们不能充分说明为什么异丁烷的形成偏好于正丁烷。但烷的形成不仅仅是热力学作用的结果。

Reaction pathways have been explored with periodic DFT calculations in order to understand the origin of the high selectivity for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30 surface alloy. The adsorption structures of butadiene, 1- and 2-butenes and all the intermediate species have been studied. Compared to the reference catalyst Pt(1 1 1), there is a change both in geometries and in relative energies: for instance, the best adsorption mode of butadiene is cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p, while it is trans 1,2,3,4-tetra-r on Pt(1 1 1). On the alloy, all the adsorption energies are reduced compared to pure platinum, and the adsorption structures implying many PtAC bonds are more destabilized.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed to investigate the hydrogenation pathways of 1,3-butadiene on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30 surface alloy, aiming to elucidate the source of its high selectivity. The adsorption configurations of butadiene, 1- and 2-butenes, and all intermediate species have been analyzed. Compared to the reference catalyst Pt(1 1 1), both the geometries and relative energies undergo changes: for example, the optimal adsorption mode of butadiene is cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p, whereas it is trans 1,2,3,4-tetra-r on Pt(1 1 1). On the alloy, all the adsorption energies are lower than those on pure platinum, and adsorption patterns involving numerous PtAC bonds are less stable.

为了理解1,3-丁二烯在Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30表面合金上的高选择性氢化反应的起源，进行了周期性的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。分析了丁二烯、1-和2-丁烯以及所有中间物种的吸附构象。与参考催化剂Pt(1 1 1)相比，几何结构和相对能量都发生了变化：例如，但烯的最佳吸附模式为cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p，而它在Pt(1 1 1)上为trans 1,2,3,4-tetra-r。在合金上，所有吸附能都低于纯铂，并且涉及大量PtAC键的吸附模式更不稳定。

The adsorption energies on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) are much smaller than on Pt(1 1 1). A decrease of 76 kJ mol−1 is observed for butadiene (74 vs. 150 kJ mol−1 for the cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p form), of 52 kJ mol−1 for 1-butene and of 51 kJ mol−1 for 2-butene. The calculated adsorption energies of butadiene and 1-butene on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) (74 and 49 kJ mol−1) are in very good agreement with the values deduced from TPD experiments (75 and 54 kJ mol−1, respectively).

The adsorption energies on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) are notably lower than those on Pt(1 1 1). For butadiene, a decrease of 76 kJ/mol is observed (74 kJ/mol for the cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p form compared to 150 kJ/mol on Pt(1 1 1)), 52 kJ/mol for 1-butene, and 51 kJ/mol for 2-butene. The calculated adsorption energies of butadiene and 1-butene on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) (74 kJ/mol and 49 kJ/mol) closely match the values inferred from thermal programmed desorption (TPD) experiments (75 kJ/mol and 54 kJ/mol, respectively).

The role of tin is dual: a role of site blocking that forces unselective pathways to adopt distorted, high-energy transition states and a role of ligand that weakens the molecular adsorption and allows decoordination of double bonds prior to the hydrogenation, which decreases the energy barriers for the selective pathway to butene.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The function of tin is twofold: a blocking effect that compels non-selective pathways to adopt distorted, high-energy transition states, and a ligand effect that weakens molecular adsorption, enabling the decoordination of double bonds before hydrogenation, thereby reducing the energy barriers for the selective pathway to butene.

Such a decrease in the adsorption energy of alkenes on the Pt/Sn alloys compared to pure Pt has been observed experimentally [33] and has been explained by DFT calculations [31,35]. The occupied d-band center is lower below the Fermi level for Pt2Sn (2.57 eV) than for Pt (2.39 eV) [35]. This results in a smaller interaction with the p system of the adsorbed molecules. Moreover, an electron transfer occurs from Sn to Pt, and the surface Pt atoms are more negatively charged on the alloy, which induces larger Pauli repulsions.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The adsorption energies on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) alloy are significantly lower compared to pure platinum. For butadiene, the adsorption energy drops from 150 kJ/mol for the cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p form to 74 kJ/mol. Similarly, the energies for 1-butene and 2-butene decrease to 49 kJ/mol and 25 kJ/mol, respectively. These values align well with the results from thermodesorption experiments. The reduction in adsorption energy is attributed to the lower d-band center of the Pt2Sn alloy, which results in a lesser interaction with the π electrons of the alkenes. Additionally, an electron transfer from tin to platinum leads to a more negative charge on the surface Pt atoms, enhancing Pauli repulsion and contributing to the observed decrease in adsorption energy.

在Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)合金上吸附的能量显著低于纯铂。对于丁二烯，吸附能量从150 kJ/mol（cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p形式）降至74 kJ/mol。同样，1-丁烯和2-丁烯的能量分别降低到49 kJ/mol和25 kJ/mol。这些结果与热解吸实验的结果相吻合。吸附能量的减少归因于Pt2Sn合金较低的d带中心，这导致与烯烃的π电子的较弱相互作用。此外，从锡到铂的电子转移导致表面Pt原子的负电荷增加，增强了Pauli排斥，从而促进了观察到的吸附能量降低。

<p>On the alloy, the systematic marked weakening of the adsorption significantly shifts the stability domains to lower temperature regions. The major consequence is a weak adsorption for butadiene in the 360 K region and a spontaneous desorption of the butenes from the surface alloy, without possible further hydrogenation, as soon as these products are formed during the reaction.</p>

On the alloy, the pronounced decrease in adsorption strength leads to a significant shift in stability regions to lower temperature zones.

<p>Tin plays a dual role. First, a role of site blocking: since hydrogen tends to avoid the tin atoms, some transition states are distorted,which increases the corresponding energy barriers.
Secondly and mainly, its ligand effect on the Pt surface atoms decreases the strength of the PtAC bonds, which allows the decoordination of the double bond in the intermediates leading to 1- and 2- butenes, reducing the activation barrier.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Tin serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it acts as a site blocker: hydrogen's tendency to avoid tin atoms causes distortion in certain transition states, thereby increasing their energy barriers. Secondly, and more importantly, the ligand effect of tin on the Pt surface atoms weakens the PtAC bonds. This facilitates the partial decoordination of the double bond in intermediates leading to 1- and 2-butenes, thus lowering the activation barrier.

锡具有双重作用。首先，它充当一个站点阻止器：由于氢倾向于避开锡原子，某些过渡状态发生扭曲，导致其能垒增加。其次，更重要的是，锡对铂表面原子的配体效应削弱了PtAC键。这使得1-和2-丁烯中间体中的双键部分解离成为可能，从而降低了活化能垒。
