The most commonly admitted interpretation of this different behavior rests on the different competitive adsorption energies of butadiene and butenes on the two metals. To verify this assumption, the adsorption structures of 1,3-butadiene and of butenes (1- and 2-butene) have been investigated by theoretical calculations [12 14]. In the two latter papers, the difference between the adsorption energies of butadiene and butenes has been found very similar on Pt and Pd and hence it cannot account for the observed selectivity.

Moreover, the formation of butane as a primary product cannot be explained by considering only reaction thermodynamics.

The adsorption energies of butadiene and butenes on platinum and palladium have been theoretically calculated to check if their differences can explain the selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. The calculated differences were found to be similar on both metals, suggesting they do not fully account for the observed preference for butene formation over butane.

Formation of butane as the main product is not solely due to thermodynamics.

但烯和异丁烷在铂和钯上的吸附能的理论计算显示，它们之间的差异与观察到的选择性不能完全解释。计算出的差异在两种金属上非常相似，这意味着它们不能充分说明为什么异丁烷的形成偏好于正丁烷。但烷的形成不仅仅是热力学作用的结果。

Reaction pathways have been explored with periodic DFT calculations in order to understand the origin of the high selectivity for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30 surface alloy. The adsorption structures of butadiene, 1- and 2-butenes and all the intermediate species have been studied. Compared to the reference catalyst Pt(1 1 1), there is a change both in geometries and in relative energies: for instance, the best adsorption mode of butadiene is cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p, while it is trans 1,2,3,4-tetra-r on Pt(1 1 1). On the alloy, all the adsorption energies are reduced compared to pure platinum, and the adsorption structures implying many PtAC bonds are more destabilized.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed to investigate the hydrogenation pathways of 1,3-butadiene on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30 surface alloy, aiming to elucidate the source of its high selectivity. The adsorption configurations of butadiene, 1- and 2-butenes, and all intermediate species have been analyzed. Compared to the reference catalyst Pt(1 1 1), both the geometries and relative energies undergo changes: for example, the optimal adsorption mode of butadiene is cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p, whereas it is trans 1,2,3,4-tetra-r on Pt(1 1 1). On the alloy, all the adsorption energies are lower than those on pure platinum, and adsorption patterns involving numerous PtAC bonds are less stable.

为了理解1,3-丁二烯在Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30表面合金上的高选择性氢化反应的起源，进行了周期性的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。分析了丁二烯、1-和2-丁烯以及所有中间物种的吸附构象。与参考催化剂Pt(1 1 1)相比，几何结构和相对能量都发生了变化：例如，但烯的最佳吸附模式为cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p，而它在Pt(1 1 1)上为trans 1,2,3,4-tetra-r。在合金上，所有吸附能都低于纯铂，并且涉及大量PtAC键的吸附模式更不稳定。

The adsorption energies on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) are much smaller than on Pt(1 1 1). A decrease of 76 kJ mol−1 is observed for butadiene (74 vs. 150 kJ mol−1 for the cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p form), of 52 kJ mol−1 for 1-butene and of 51 kJ mol−1 for 2-butene. The calculated adsorption energies of butadiene and 1-butene on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) (74 and 49 kJ mol−1) are in very good agreement with the values deduced from TPD experiments (75 and 54 kJ mol−1, respectively).

The adsorption energies on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) are notably lower than those on Pt(1 1 1). For butadiene, a decrease of 76 kJ/mol is observed (74 kJ/mol for the cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p form compared to 150 kJ/mol on Pt(1 1 1)), 52 kJ/mol for 1-butene, and 51 kJ/mol for 2-butene. The calculated adsorption energies of butadiene and 1-butene on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) (74 kJ/mol and 49 kJ/mol) closely match the values inferred from thermal programmed desorption (TPD) experiments (75 kJ/mol and 54 kJ/mol, respectively).

The role of tin is dual: a role of site blocking that forces unselective pathways to adopt distorted, high-energy transition states and a role of ligand that weakens the molecular adsorption and allows decoordination of double bonds prior to the hydrogenation, which decreases the energy barriers for the selective pathway to butene.

The function of tin is twofold: a blocking effect that compels non-selective pathways to adopt distorted, high-energy transition states, and a ligand effect that weakens molecular adsorption, enabling the decoordination of double bonds before hydrogenation, thereby reducing the energy barriers for the selective pathway to butene.

锡的作用是双重的：一种阻塞效应，迫使非选择性途径采用扭曲的、高能过渡态；一种配体效应，削弱分子吸附，允许双键在氢化前解离，从而降低选择性路径到达丁烯的能量壁垒。
