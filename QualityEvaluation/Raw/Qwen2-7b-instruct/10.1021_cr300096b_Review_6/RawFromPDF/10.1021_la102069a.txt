Abstract
Adsorption and decomposition of cyclohexanone (C6H10O) on Pt(111) and on two ordered Pt−Sn surface alloys, (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) and (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111), formed by vapor deposition of Sn on the Pt(111) single crystal surface were studied with TPD, HREELS, AES, LEED, and DFT calculations with vibrational analyses. Saturation coverage of C6H10O was found to be 0.25 ML, independent of the Sn surface concentration. The Pt(111) surface was reactive toward cyclohexanone, with the adsorption in the monolayer being about 70% irreversible. C6H10O decomposed to yield CO, H2O, H2, and CH4. Some C−O bond breaking occurred, yielding H2O and leaving some carbon on the surface after TPD. HREELS data showed that cyclohexanone decomposition in the monolayer began by 200 K. Intermediates from cyclohexanone decomposition were also relatively unstable on Pt(111), since coadsorbed CO and H were formed below 250 K. Surface Sn allowed for some cyclohexanone to adsorb reversibly. C6H10O dissociated on the (2 × 2) surface to form CO and H2O at low coverages, and methane and H2 in smaller amounts than on Pt(111). Adsorption of cyclohexanone on (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) at 90 K was mostly reversible. DFT calculations suggest that C6H10O adsorbs on Pt(111) in two configurations: by bonding weakly through oxygen to an atop Pt site and more strongly through simultaneously oxygen and carbon of the carbonyl to a bridged Pt−Pt site. In contrast, on alloy surfaces, C6H10O bonds preferentially to Sn. The presence of Sn, furthermore, is predicted to make the formation of the strongly bound C6H10O species bonding through O and C, which is a likely decomposition precursor, thermodynamically unfavorable. Alloying with Sn, thus, is shown to moderate adsorptive and reactive activity of Pt(111).

1 Introduction
Adsorption of oxygen-containing cyclic hydrocarbons on transition-metal single-crystal surfaces has not been extensively investigated, even though these compounds are of considerable interest to practical heterogeneous catalytic reactions. (1) For example, phenol (C6H5OH) can be hydrogenated to form cyclohexanone (C6H10O) over Pd catalysts and cyclohexanone can undergo hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) over Pt catalysts, as shown in Scheme 1. The adsorption and reactions of phenol have been the subject of many studies. (2-7) Cyclohexanone (C6H10O) is of direct interest for the above reactions as a stable intermediate in HDO reaction sequences (8) and as a prototypical cyclic ketone for catalytic hydrogenation studies.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Hydrogenation of Phenol to Form Cyclohexanone (Left) and Hydrodeoxygenation of Cyclohexanone to Form Cyclohexane (Right)
We have previously investigated the selectivity of three model catalysts, Pt(111) and two Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, that is, (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) and (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111), toward the formation of the corresponding alcohol from catalytic gas-phase hydrogenation of cyclohexanone. (9) The hydrogenation activity at low temperature (325 K) was substantially higher for both Pt−Sn alloy catalysts than that of the Pt(111) surface, with the activity proportional to the amount of Sn in the surface layer. The selectivity over the two Pt−Sn alloys was the same as that for Pt(111), but large changes occurred in the products formed as a function of temperature on all three surfaces. Cyclohexanol was the only product detected below 400 K, but cyclohexene and cyclohexane were the only products at 425 and 500 K. The C12 coupling product cyclohexylcyclohexene was formed exclusively at 600 K over all catalysts. Additional basic information on the adsorption and desorption behavior of cyclohexanone on these surfaces would be useful to more fully understand these results and aid in the development of new catalysts.
There was one previous investigation of cyclohexanone adsorption on Pt(111) (10) with a reported red shift of the C═O stretching band for the chemisorbed species at 160 K. This band and the CH2 rocking band completely disappeared upon heating to 250 K. It was concluded that the entire adlayer was dehydrogenated during heating in TPD, and that CO was the only gaseous oxygen-containing product formed; that is, the C═O bond in cyclohexanone was never broken during thermal decomposition. We note that the crystal used in that work had a substantial concentration of defect sites, as evidenced by the CO TPD spectra.
In this paper, we report on a reinvestigation of adsorption and decomposition of cyclohexanone on a Pt(111) single crystal surface, and in addition investigate two Sn alloy surfaces. Pt−Sn bimetallic catalysts are well-known for their performance in hydrocarbon hydrogenation and dehydrogenation (11-15) and, more recently, for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. (16, 17) In surface science studies, alloying Sn into the Pt(111) surface greatly reduces the reactivity of the surface and decreases the adsorption energies of a wide variety of hydrocarbons and organic molecules. (18-20) Ketones are often reactants, products, or intermediates in many of these transformations. For example, increasing the amount of Sn added to a Pt catalyst favors the formation of unsaturated ketones in the hydrogenation of carvone (C10H14O) over Pt/Al2O3 and Pt−Sn/Al2O3. (21) Since alloys are formed in many catalyst systems, the surface science of their structure and reactivity is an important area of investigation. Understanding the adsorption and decomposition of cyclohexanone on well-defined Pt−Sn alloys at the molecular level establishes the fundamentals that are critical for rational development of Pt−Sn catalysts, optimization of their operating conditions, and development of accurate reaction kinetic models with physically meaningful parameters for reactor design and process control.
2 Experimental and Computational Methods
Experiments were performed in a stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber (22) with capabilities for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), gas dosing, metal vapor deposition, and Ar+ ion sputtering. The system base pressure for these studies was 5 × 10−11 Torr.
HREEL spectra were collected with the sample at 90 K, with a typical resolution of 55 cm−1 and incident beam energy of 4.5 eV. All TPD measurements were made using the QMS ionizer in line-of-sight with the sample surface and a linear heating rate of 3 K/s. The crystal was positioned 1 mm away from the entrance aperture of the QMS shield to reduce contributions to the spectra from the crystal back and edges. (23) Two highly transparent, fine, grounded screens were in place to eliminate possible damage to the adsorbed layer from low energy electrons emitted by the QMS ionizer region. (24)
The Pt(111) crystal was cooled using liquid nitrogen to 90 K and resistively heated to 1200 K. The temperature was recorded by a chromel-alumel thermocouple spot-welded to the side of the crystal. The Pt(111) surface was cleaned by a combination of Ar+ ion sputtering, annealing in vacuum, and oxygen treatments. Ion bombardment of the crystal was carried out using 1 keV Ar+ (5 × 10−5 Torr Ar) for 5 min with the sample at 550 K, and then the crystal was annealed to 1200 K for 40 s in UHV to reorder the surface. Oxygen treatments at 5 × 10−8 Torr O2 for 5 min with the crystal at 850 K, followed by flashing in vacuum to 1000 K, were used to remove submonolayer coverages of surface carbon.
The (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy was prepared by evaporating 0.7 ML Sn onto the Pt(111) surface and subsequently annealing to 1000 K for 10 s. The (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) surface was prepared by evaporating 1.0 ML Sn on the Pt(111) surface and annealing to 850 K for 10 s. The two-dimensional order of both surfaces was observed by LEED and coverages of Sn on surfaces were θSn = 0.25 ML for (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) and θSn = 0.33 ML for (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111), corresponding to the face (111) of Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn, respectively. Pure-Pt threefold sites existed on the (2 × 2) alloy, while they were not present in the √3 alloy.
Cyclohexanone (99.5% purity, Aldrich Corp.) was purified by two successive fractional vacuum distillations at 248 K under a nitrogen flow. The sample was then further purified to remove gaseous impurities using freeze−pump−thaw cycles. The purity was checked using in situ mass spectrometry.
Gas exposures for the TPD studies were given with the sample at 90 K. Gas exposures in this paper are given in units of Langmuirs (1 L = 10−6 Torr·s) after the measured values were multiplied by a numerical factor to account for the multicapillary array doser enhancement. No correction was made for ion gauge sensitivity.
Coverages θi reported in this paper are referenced to the surface atom density of Pt(111) such that θPt = 1.0 ML is defined as 1.505 × 1015 cm−2.
Gradient-corrected periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the DMol3 code in Materials Studio 4.0 software by Accelrys Inc. Infinite slabs were constructed using a 4 × 4 × 4 Pt(111) unit cell with a total of 64 Pt atoms, similarly to the Au(111) unit cell reported previously. (25) The (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface was constructed by substituting 4 out of 16 surface Pt atoms by Sn in the appropriate positions. The optimized Pt lattice constant of 4.0278 Å was used to generate the surface from the bulk crystal with a vacuum spacing between the slabs of 30 Å. All surface layers were optimized with cyclohexanone during geometry optimizations, simulating surface relaxation on adsorption. Adsorption energies were calculated at 0 K without zero-energy corrections using as a reference the sum of energies for the appropriate clean surface and cyclohexanone calculated separately. Frequency calculations were performed with a partial Hessian for the adsorbed cyclohexanone. Estimated vibrational modes were uniformly reduced by 7 cm−1 based on the agreement with the 1716 cm−1 experimental band for the C═O vibration. The calculations used the double numerical with polarization (DNP) basis set and the generalized gradient-corrected revised Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (GGA RPBE) functional. Tightly bound core electrons were represented with semicore pseudopotentials. Reciprocal-space integration over the Brillouin zone was approximated through k-point sampling with a separation of 0.05 1/Å using the Monkhorst−Pack grid: (2 × 2 × 1). Convergence with respect to the number of k-points was tested by decreasing the k-point separation distance to 0.04 1/Å (3 × 3 × 1 k-points) for representative structures.
3 Results
3.1 Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) on Pt(111)
Signals at 98, 94, 44−42, 32−27, 18−16, 12, and 2 amu were monitored during TPD for identification of gas-phase products from cyclohexanone decomposition. No desorption of methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (CH2O), CO2, or phenol (C6H6O) was identified. Figure 1 shows TPD spectra for the gases desorbed from the reaction of 1.0 L C6H10O on Pt(111). This dose produces slightly more than monolayer coverage (as seen later). The cyclohexanone parent ion signal at 98 amu is shown in the bottom trace. Cracking fractions from the two low temperature desorption peaks of C6H10O at 257 and 172 K were seen at 42 and 28 amu. CO desorption produced peaks at 435 and 490 K at 28 amu. H2O desorbed in peaks at 208 and 288 K. Methane desorption was assigned to the peak at 304 K. H2 desorbed over an extended temperature range from 300 to above 600 K, with a pronounced peak at 485 K.

Figure 2 shows coverage-dependent TPD spectra for cyclohexanone and its decomposition products on Pt(111). Cyclohexanone (C6H10O) TPD spectra (98 amu) are shown in Figure 2A. No cyclohexanone desorption was observed below exposures of 0.20 L, but cyclohexanone desorbed in peaks at 257 and 172 K at larger exposures. The lower temperature peak did not saturate with increased cyclohexanone exposures and is attributed to desorption of physisorbed cyclohexanone that eventually forms a condensed multilayer. We estimate that the desorption activation energy for the peak at 257 K is 15.8 kcal/mol based on Redhead analysis. (26) This value is a reasonable estimate of the adsorption energy of cyclohexanone at this coverage.

H2 TPD spectra, as shown in Figure 2B, showed two distinct desorption features at 365 and 466 K at the lowest exposures and these shift slightly at higher exposures. Comparison of these spectra with H2 TPD spectra obtained after H2 exposure on Pt(111) (27, 28) indicates that H2 desorption at 352 K from C6H10O may be desorption-rate limited, but any H2 evolution above this temperature is clearly reaction-rate limited.
Figure 2C shows that H2O desorption was observed in a single peak at 194 K at low C6H10O coverages, and this peak shifted to 208 K at higher coverages. This low-temperature H2O desorption was very similar to that in H2O TPD spectra after H2O adsorption on Pt(111), (29) indicating that this peak was desorption-rate limited or due to a small amount of H2O coadsorbed during the experiments. H2O desorption peaks at higher temperatures were clearly from decomposition of C6H10O and were reaction-rate limited.
CO TPD spectra, shown in Figure 2D, showed only a high temperature peak at 476 K at low coverages, which shifted to 490 K at higher exposures. The shoulder at 540 K is due to a reaction-rate-limited process, and the peak that appeared at 434 K is attributed to coadsorbed CO. A CO TPD spectrum for a 3.0 L CO exposure is shown for comparison at the bottom of Figure 2D.
In these TPD spectra, CO, H2O, and H2 evolution occurred after the lowest initial exposures and continued to increase after larger doses, while CH4 evolution (not shown) remained constant after the lowest initial exposures. A competitive process between the desorption of CO and H2O may have been responsible. At low coverages, when the reactivity of the surface was highest, decomposition formed CO and H2O, while at higher coverages coadsorbates inhibited complete decomposition of intermediates. Methane desorption suggests that methyl is a major intermediate.
AES spectra (not shown here) were taken after each TPD spectrum to follow carbon buildup on the Pt(111) surface resulting from complete decomposition of cyclohexanone. No oxygen was detected by AES after TPD. Thus, CO and other oxygen-containing decomposition products were fully desorbed during TPD.
We can also use these TPD spectra to determine the cyclohexanone coverage. The CO and C6H10O desorption peak areas were converted to coverages by first calibrating the CO desorption area to a known coverage θCO = 0.68 ML from CO exposure on Pt(111) (27) and then using a 1:1 correspondence for the amount of C6H10O decomposition to CO yield. The C6H10O area was calibrated to C6H10O coverage by forcing an uptake curve (not shown) to have a constant slope, that is, constant sticking coefficient, for the region at low coverage where the CO yield reflects the C6H10O coverage since there is no C6H10O desorption. Uptake curves revealed that no C6H10O desorbed until the evolution of all of the decomposition products had stopped. The cyclohexanone monolayer coverage was determined to be 0.25 ML, consistent with independent XPS measurements, and of this a significant percentage (>70%) underwent decomposition during TPD. This value was obtained from uptake kinetics or independently by the CO yield. The previously reported monolayer coverage of cyclohexanone on Pt(111) was ∼0.10 ML. (10)
3.2 High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) on Pt(111)
Figure 3 shows HREEL spectra of cyclohexanone adsorbed on Pt(111) at 90 K. The two curves above the clean Pt(111) spectrum were obtained following very small doses of cyclohexanone, 0.05 and 0.25 L, in order to focus on the most strongly bound species. The spectrum obtained following a 0.50 L cyclohexanone exposure gave a cyclohexanone coverage of about 50% of the chemisorbed monolayer. An infrared (IR) absorption spectrum for condensed-phase cyclohexanone (30) is positioned at the top of Figure 3 for comparison. Table 1 compares the vibrational frequencies from our HREEL spectra, this condensed phase IR spectrum, (30) and results from our DFT vibrational analyses described below. At these low cyclohexanone coverages on Pt(111) at 90 K and due to the long scan times required to obtain the HREEL spectra (90 min), it was not surprising to see small peaks due to coadsorbed CO at 2100 and 480 cm−1 and H2O at 3460, 1640, and 680 cm−1. These will not be further discussed, and the focus will be on the peaks due to molecular cyclohexanone.

In the top curve for 5.0 L cyclohexanone on Pt(111) at 90 K, which produces a multilayer film, we identify peaks at 2960, 1710, 1455, 1320, 1258, 750, and 490 cm−1. Broad features due to several superimposed bands are noted near 750, 1000, and 1350 cm−1. In comparison to the liquid phase, the ν(CH, asym) stretching band at 2960 cm−1 was unshifted, and the ν(C═O) stretching band at 1710 cm−1 was only shifted slightly, as would be expected. Cyclohexanone spectra at submonolayer coverages, for example, 0.5 and 0.25 L exposures, is characterized by peaks as listed in Table 1 for the monolayer on Pt(111), that are either shifted slightly or not shifted from the top spectrum. Thus, adsorption in the monolayer was molecular, with little rehybridization or distortion from the condensed-phase molecular structure. The relatively small intensity of the ν(C═O) loss peak indicated that the C═O bond in the molecule was oriented in a plane closer to parallel with the surface rather than perpendicular to it. We note that the strong “C−H softening” that occurs for chemisorbed cyclohexane on Pt(111) (24) due to interactions of the three axial hydrogens with the surface did not occur for cyclohexanone, and this most likely meant that the molecular ring plane was not oriented parallel with the surface like it was for cyclohexane. These observations imply that the molecular plane is tilted with respect to the plane of the crystal surface. All of these observations are consistent with the spectra and geometry assignments previously reported. (10) For comparison, cyclohexylamine (C6H13N), a similarly structured molecule, was reported to adsorb with a tilted geometry on Ni(111). (31) Cyclohexylamine bonds to the metal surface via the electron pair on the amino group, and the “puckered” nonaromatic ring is believed to cause the C−N bond to be tilted. Cyclohexanone is likely to bond similarly on Pt(111).
A series of HREEL spectra, which were taken after sequentially heating the sample, following an exposure of 10 L cyclohexanone dosed on Pt(111) at 90 K, are shown in Figure 4. Heating to 150 K caused no desorption of cyclohexanone or any reaction products in TPD. The elastic peak intensity became much larger, presumably due to ordering in the adlayer, and this led to a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the HREEL spectrum with similar features to the multilayer coverage spectrum in Figure 3. Warming the surface to 200 K, which desorbed all physisorbed cyclohexanone or water, caused the emergence of a broad feature near 700 cm−1 and a small peak at 230 cm−1. The only significant peak shift was for ν(C═O) from 1710 to 1680 cm−1.

Figure 4. HREELS spectra following the changes induced by warming a surface produced by a 10 L cyclohexanone exposure on Pt(111) at 90 K.
Heating to 250 K desorbed all reversibly adsorbed cyclohexanone, and the HREEL spectrum showed a number of new peaks attributed to a decomposition intermediate that was formed, as well as coadsorbed CO that could be formed from C−C bond breaking. Warming to 370 K evolved a significant amount of hydrogen and some methane. Peaks were then seen at 380, 490, 660, 880, 1509, 1640, 1843, 2051, and 2970 cm−1, with the peaks at 880 and 1640 cm−1 being the most prominent. The decreased intensity of the ν(CH, asym) stretching band at 2970 cm−1 was indicative of the dehydrogenation that had occurred. The ν(C═O) peaks at 1820 and 2051 cm−1 signaled the appearance of adsorbed CO. Heating to 430 K produced the low-temperature CO peak shown in Figure 1, but it left a decomposition intermediate on the surface that decomposed at 485 K to liberate additional CO and H2. This species was characterized by broad losses between 493 and 650 cm−1, a peak at 880 with a shoulder at 920, a ν(C═O) peak at 1640 cm−1, and a ν(CH, asym) stretching band at 2970 cm−1.
3.3 TPD Studies on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) Surface Alloy
After adsorbing cyclohexanone on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy at 90 K, C6H10O TPD spectra were obtained and are shown in Figure 5A. Exposures larger than 0.01 L produced C6H10O desorption at 239 K from a chemisorbed state of cyclohexanone. After higher doses (≥0.25 L), a peak at 177 K from desorption of physisorbed cyclohexanone was observed, as for Pt(111). The lower desorption temperature from the monolayer compared to Pt(111) indicates weaker binding of C6H10O on the alloy surface. We estimate that the desorption activation energy is 14.7 kcal/mol based on Redhead analysis. (26)

In monitoring the same signals as for Pt(111), no desorption of methanol, formaldehyde, or CO2 was identified. Figure 5B shows TPD spectra monitoring several significant masses following dosing of 0.6 L cyclohexanone on the (2 × 2) alloy at 90 K. The amount of desorption of decomposition products is much lower compared to that on Pt(111). In addition to cyclohexanone cracking fractions contributing to peaks at 177 and 239 K, the results indicate desorption of small amounts of H2, CH4, H2O, and CO due to decomposition of cyclohexanone on the (2 × 2) surface alloy. H2 desorbs in a broad range of 350−550 K, with the peak at 385 K due to a desorption-rate-limited process and higher temperature features due to reaction-rate-limited processes. CH4 desorbs in a reaction-rate-limited peak at 260 K, and H2O desorbs in a desorption-rate-limited peak at 165 K. CO desorbs in a peak at 388 K that is likely desorption-rate limited. Similar TPD spectra were also obtained by monitoring all of these signals over a range of C6H10O exposures on the (2 × 2) alloy (not shown for brevity). The only significant change in these spectra is that the CO peak initially arises at 350 K and then shifts to higher temperatures with increasing coverages to produce a peak at 388 K.
We determined that the cyclohexanone monolayer coverage is 0.25 ML on this alloy, as on Pt(111), and of this less than 5% underwent decomposition during TPD. While the cyclohexanone monolayer coverage on the alloy is the same as that on Pt(111), the reactivity of the alloy is much lower and much more cyclohexanone is reversibly adsorbed.
3.4 TPD Studies on the (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) Surface Alloy
TPD spectra obtained for cyclohexanone desorption from the (√3 × √3)R30° alloy are shown in Figure 6A. Cyclohexanone desorption was observed even after the lowest exposures, in a single peak at 227 K initially and then shifting to 224 K after larger exposures. Prior to saturation of the intensity of this peak, another lower temperature peak appeared at 177 K at higher exposures. The TPD peak at 224 K is associated with desorption from a chemisorbed state of cyclohexanone, and the peak at 177 K is associated with desorption of physisorbed cyclohexanone as before. The physisorbed cyclohexanone TPD peak occurs at the same temperature on all three surfaces, but the small shift to lower temperature of the chemisorbed peak indicates a slight weakening of the bonding on the (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) alloy, calculated to be 13.7 kcal/mol based on Redhead analysis. (26)

Figure 6B shows TPD spectra monitoring several masses of interest following dosing of 0.3 L cyclohexanone on the (√3 × √3)R30° alloy. Only features caused by cracking fractions of desorbed cyclohexanone were observed, with the exception of a small CO desorption peak at 360 K. This occurs at the same temperature that CO desorbs from the alloy after CO exposures, and we attribute this to a small amount of coadsorbed CO that occurs during the experiments. Thus, cyclohexanone adsorption is completely reversible under these conditions, and only C6H10O desorption occurs at all coverages on this alloy surface.
Using the same methodology, the cyclohexanone monolayer coverage was determined to be 0.25 ML, showing that alloying had no effect on the monolayer coverage. No decomposition occurred during TPD on this alloy; 100% of the chemisorbed monolayer was reversibly adsorbed.
3.5 HREELS Studies on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) Surface Alloy
HREEL spectra obtained after several cyclohexanone exposures on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy at 90 K are shown in Figure 7. The two smallest doses produced cyclohexanone coverages of 10 and 50% of the chemisorbed monolayer, while a 0.40 L exposure produced close to one monolayer coverage. A 13 L cyclohexanone exposure produced a condensed cyclohexanone film.
Figure 7
Figure 7. HREELS spectra after cyclohexanone adsorption on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy at 90 K.
The spectrum for the condensed film closely resembles that obtained by IR in the liquid phase. Also, spectra from monolayer and submonolayer coverages are altered very little from the thick film, other than the red-shift in the ν(C═O) peak to 1670 cm−1. This frequency is midway between the 1640 cm−1 band on Pt(111) and the 1716 cm−1 band in the liquid phase. Thus, cyclohexanone is adsorbed molecularly in the monolayer, with little change in the free molecular structure. The relatively small intensity of the ν(C═O) loss peak in addition to the absence of strong “C−H softening”, as we discussed earlier, leads us to conclude that cyclohexanone adsorbs on the (2 × 2) alloy in a geometry with the ring plane tilted with respect to the surface. The bonding and adsorption geometry of cyclohexanone on this alloy is similar to that on Pt(111) at 90 K, except that the interaction with the surface is weaker.
HREELS was also used to follow the changes caused by sequentially heating a condensed film of cyclohexanone dosed onto the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy at 90 K, as shown in Figure 8. Heating to 140 K, which caused no desorption in TPD, did not alter the vibrational frequencies, but induced a significant increase in the elastic peak intensity and relative intensity of the ν(C═O) peak at 1720 cm−1. This peak increased to nearly twice the relative intensity that it had at 90 K, and this is associated with an ordering phase transition in which the adsorbate geometry has the C═O bond oriented more perpendicular to the surface plane. Revealing the spectrum for the cyclohexanone monolayer, heating the surface to 180 K desorbed all physisorbed species. This caused primarily a decrease in the relative intensities of the peak at 500 cm−1 and the ν(C═O) peak at 1720 cm−1. Heating had little effect on the peak frequencies; however, the ν(C═O) peak shifted to 1670 cm−1 and the peaks at 1350 and 1460 cm−1 shifted to 1320 and 1430 cm−1, respectively. Heating to 230 K desorbed all chemisorbed cyclohexanone molecules and nearly eliminated all peaks in the HREEL spectra. Small peaks at 1460, 1640, and 2930 cm−1 are due to any remaining cyclohexanone and the hydrocarbon decomposition products left on the surface. AES revealed a relatively clean surface.

3.6 HREELS Studies on the (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) Surface Alloy
Figure 9 provides HREELS spectra for several coverages of C6H10O on the (√3 × √3)R30° alloy at 90 K. The bottom curve represents the clean surface. The other curves were obtained after 0.1, 0.5 and 5 L cyclohexanone exposures that produced cyclohexanone coverages of about 0.2, 1.5, and 10-layer thick films, respectively. The condensed film appears as before. The spectrum obtained below monolayer coverage is nearly identical to that on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. The addition of cyclohexanone in excess of the monolayer caused the ν(C═O) peak to shift back to 1720 cm−1.
Figure 9

HREEL spectra in Figure 10 were obtained after sequentially heating a film of cyclohexanone on the (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) alloy surface alloy from an initial temperature of 90 K. Heating to 140 K caused no desorption and no peak shifts but produced a noticeable sharpening of the loss peaks and an increase in the relative intensity of the ν(C═O) peak at 1720 cm−1. This peak appeared at twice the relative intensity that it had in the spectrum at 90 K, and this is associated with an ordering phase transition similar to what occurred on the (2 × 2) alloy. Heating the surface to 180 K desorbed all physisorbed cyclohexanone. The spectrum for the remaining monolayer is the same as that produced by submonolayer doses of cyclohexanone at 90 K, with the ν(C═O) peak at 1670 cm−1.

3.7 DFT Calculations for Pt(111) and (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111)
The results of the DFT calculations are summarized in Figure 11 and Table 2. The complete 4 × 4 × 4 unit cell of the Pt(111) surface model with the optimized adsorbed cyclohexanone is shown in Figure 11a. The same structure with a surface abridged for clarity is also shown in Figure 11b with two views generated by rotating the model in the X−Y plane by 90°. The adsorbed cyclohexanone is predicted to be bonded to an atop site of Pt(111) through the carbonyl oxygen with a Pt−O bond distance of 2.444 Å and Pt−O−C angle of 132°. The adsorbate pulls the bonding Pt atom out the surface plane by 0.006 Å. The calculated adsorption energy for this structure is −12 kcal/mol (exothermal). The calculations also suggest that the adsorbed cyclohexanone can rearrange on Pt(111) and form the chemisorbed structure shown in Figure 11c where the molecule is bridge bonded to two Pt atoms through both the carbonyl oxygen (Pt−O distance of 2.155 Å) and carbon (Pt−C, 2.331 Å). This structure is predicted to have an endothermic adsorption energy of 5 kcal/mol, suggesting that it has a substantial activation energy for desorption since it is stable on the surface. Such a chemisorbed structure is likely to be a precursor for decomposition of cyclohexanone on Pt. The optimized adsorbed cyclohexanone structures on Pt(111) in Figure 11b and c were used as initial guesses for the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface. When the bonding Pt atom of Pt(111) in Figure 11b was substituted by Sn in the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface, the structure optimized to the configuration shown in Figure 11d with the Sn−O bond distance of 2.782 Å and Sn−O−C angle of 135°. Despite the slight geometry changes, the adsorption energy is predicted to be similar to the calculated value on Pt(111). In contrast with bonding to Sn, cyclohexanone bonding to Pt in the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) model was not stable, with cyclohexanone moving away (desorbing) upon geometry optimization. In addition to the adsorbed cyclohexanone geometry in Figure 11a, several other initial guesses for the adsorbate on Pt of the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) were evaluated. None of the evaluated geometries were stable, moving away from the surface upon geometry optimization. This suggests that cyclohexanone bonds preferentially to Sn on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface. These results are consistent with DFT calculations for 2-butenal on the Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, which also suggest that the adsorption mode is through the carbonyl oxygen preferentially bound to a surface Sn atom.

The chemisorbed cyclohexanone on a Pt−Pt bridging site in Figure 11c was similarly used as an initial guess for adsorbates on (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) with all possible combinations: Sn−Pt, Pt−Sn, and Pt−Pt. The bonding on a Sn−Pt site is different from the one on Pt−Sn because one surface atom is bonded to oxygen and another one to carbon. No stable adsorbed geometry was identified on a Pt−Pt bridge site, in line with the earlier described results for a Pt atop site in the presence of neighboring Sn. All other initial guesses converged to configurations where cyclohexanone is bonded to Sn through oxygen with a greater distance of about 2.893 Å and shifted closer to neighboring Pt, as shown in Figure 11e. In addition, the tilt of the ring is closer to being parallel to the surface in contrast to it being almost normal when cyclohexanone is bonded to a single Pt on Pt(111) (Figure 11b) or a single Sn atom on (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) (Figure 11d). The calculated heat of adsorption for the cyclohexanone bonding mostly to Sn and partially to Pt (Figure 11e) is −9 kcal/mol (exothermal), which is by about 3 kcal/mol higher (less thermodynamically stable) than that for the adsorbates bonded to a single atom. Since high coverage adsorption on Sn/Pt at a low temperature can be expected to result in a mixture of cyclohexanone bonded to Sn only (−12 kcal/mol) and to Sn−Pt (−9 kcal/mol), the overall adsorption energy is predicted to be lower (less exothermal) on (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) than that calculated for Pt (−12 kcal/mol).
Several structures where cyclohexanone bonds to Sn−Pt with geometries and energetics similar to those for the structure in Figure 11e were identified. These structures, however, are metastable, representing local minima; on perturbation, they all converge to the geometry with the bonding to Sn only shown in Figure 11d.
We emphasize that no stable analogue for the chemisorbed species bonded through both oxygen and carbon (Figure 11c) on Pt(111) was identified on Sn/Pt(111) due to hydrocarbon destabilization on Pt in the presence of neighboring Sn. Since this structure chemisorbed through −C−O− is a likely precursor for surface decomposition, we can attribute the experimentally observed lack of low-temperature decomposition on Sn/Pt(111) to the elimination of an energetically favorable reaction pathway through this chemisorbed precursor in the presence of surface Sn. An alternative decomposition initiation through breaking of one of the C−H bonds in cyclohexanone can be expected to have a higher activation energy.
Calculated vibrational frequencies for C6H10O in the gas phase, weakly and strongly bound species on Pt(111), and species on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface are shown in Table 1. Also referenced in Table 1 are literature DFT and experimental vibrational data for cyclohexanone in the gas and liquid phases.
The difference in calculated frequencies for the C═O stretch between C6H10O in the gas phase (1716 cm−1) and adsorbed on Pt(111) (1657 cm−1) is in line with the experimentally observed red shift. The C═O stretching frequency shifts closer to that of the gas phase when C6H10O is adsorbed on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface (1685 cm−1), which is again consistent with the experimental results. The C−O stretching frequency is predicted to be at a significantly lower value of 1224 cm−1 for the strongly bound C6H10O species on Pt(111) due to the simultaneous surface bonding of the carbon and oxygen of the carbonyl group, which in effect converts the C═O double bond into a −C−O− single bond. The strongly bound species in Figure 11c is predicted to have a C−Pt vibrational frequency at 506 cm−1. Although there are experimental bands at 1250 and 500 cm−1 that are consistent with these calculated frequencies of 1224 and 506 cm−1 for the strongly bound species on a Pt−Pt bridged site, it is difficult to make a definitive assignment due to a possible presence of decomposition products.
4 Discussion
Cyclohexanone (C6H10O) chemisorbs molecularly on Pt(111) at 90 K with a monolayer coverage of 0.25 ML. HREELS shows only a small red shift in the ν(C═O) peak to 1640 cm−1 from 1716 cm−1 in the liquid phase, which indicates only slight rehybridization of the carbonyl group due to dative bonding via the oxygen atom to the surface. Furthermore, the energy loss peak relative intensities and the absence of “C−H softening” indicate that the molecular ring plane is neither perpendicular nor parallel with the surface plane, but rather tilted with respect to the surface normal. DFT calculations find a similar tilted adsorption geometry for cyclohexanone adsorbed via the carbonyl group with the oxygen atom located at a Pt atop site. The adsorption energy for this species at high coverage is estimated to be 15.8 kcal/mol from TPD, which is close to the value calculated from DFT of 12 kcal/mol.
The Pt(111) surface is quite reactive, and chemisorbed cyclohexanone is largely irreversibly adsorbed such that 70% of the monolayer decomposes during heating in TPD. Decomposition begins between 200 and 250 K, with an initial activation barrier of 12−15 kcal/mol, and primarily evolves CO, H2, H2O, and CH4 during TPD. The HREEL spectra obtained by stepwise heating are consistent with the TPD results, but unfortunately they do not reveal any additional details about the reaction intermediates or the decomposition mechanism. DFT calculations identified a strongly bound, rehybridized species on Pt(111), as shown in Figure 11c, which could serve as an intermediate in cyclohexanone decomposition. It is reasonable to assume that this species could decompose via C−O bond cleavage in addition to C−C bond breaking.
Our results differ in only two aspects from the previous investigation of cyclohexanone adsorption on Pt(111). (10) We find that only 70% of the adlayer decomposes during heating in TPD, rather than 100%, and we find that H2O is a desorbed product, rather than CO being the only gaseous oxygen-containing product formed. Thus, our results demonstrate that the C═O bond in cyclohexanone can be broken during thermal decomposition.
The (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy chemisorbed cyclohexanone less strongly than Pt(111), lowering the adsorption energy to 14.7 kcal/mol. DFT calculations find preferential adsorption on Sn and destabilization of adsorption on Pt in the presence of neighboring Sn, as shown in Figure 11. The calculated adsorption energy for cyclohexanone bonding to Sn on (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) is the same as that calculated for cyclohexanone bonding to Pt on Pt(111), as shown in Table 2. However, when the carbonyl group bonds to both Sn and Pt, the adsorption energy is lower. Consistent with HREELS, DFT identifies a tilted molecular bonding geometry and calculates a small blue shift for the ν(C═O) peak to 1685 cm−1 from 1657 cm−1 on Pt(111), which can be compared to 1670 cm−1 from 1640 cm−1 on Pt(111) determined experimentally, indicative of weaker bonding on the alloy.
The (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface was less reactive than Pt(111). Cyclohexanone was primarily reversibly adsorbed, but about 5% of the monolayer decomposed to form H2 and possibly CO, but there was no clear evidence for a H2O product. DFT calculations suggest that the lower decomposition activity of this alloy can be attributed to destabilization of hydrocarbons on Pt in the presence of Sn and a possible change in the decomposition mechanism. In contrast to Pt(111) where cyclohexanone is predicted to rehybridize the C═O carbonyl group and form a strongly bound species on a Pt−Pt bridged site through the −C−O− group (Figure 11c), no such chemisorbed analogue was identified on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) alloy. The strongly bound species on Pt(111) in Figure 11c can serve as a precursor in cyclohexanone decomposition. In the absence of such a chemisorbed state on the Sn/Pt(111) alloys, decomposition must proceed through a different initiation mechanism, most likely through breaking of one of the C−H bonds in cyclohexanone with a higher activation energy.
Incorporation of additional Sn to form the (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) alloy further decreases the adsorption energy of C6H10O from that on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) alloy, from 14.7 to 13.7 kcal/mol, respectively, and completely eliminates thermal decomposition during TPD. HREELS indicates a similar adsorption geometry on both alloys and the same ν(C═O) stretching frequency. DFT calculations were unable to find a stable adsorption geometry for cyclohexanone on this alloy surface, consistent with the weak binding observed. Figure S1 of the Supporting Information illustrates the influence of increasing Sn concentration in the surface on the desorption activation energy of cyclohexanone, which is also the adsorption energy in this case. In previous work that investigated the adsorption and reaction of cyclohexane, cyclohexene, and benzene on two Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, (24) we attributed the nonlinear decrease in such a plot, along with dramatically decreased reactivity, to the elimination of pure-Pt threefold hollow sites on the (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) alloy.
As a final comment, the decreased activation energy for catalytic cyclohexanone hydrogenation on these surface alloys compared to Pt(111) (9) should be considered in light of the weaker interaction and smaller adsorption energies of cyclohexanone on the alloys and the increased reaction energy barriers for decomposition on the alloys compared to Pt(111).
5 Conclusion
Adsorption and reactivity of cyclohexanone on Pt(111) and on two ordered, Pt−Sn surface alloys, that is, the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) and (√3 × √3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) surfaces, formed by vapor deposition of Sn on the Pt(111) single crystal surface were characterized with TPD, HREELS, AES, LEED, and DFT calculations with vibrational analyses. On Pt(111) at 90 K, cyclohexanone chemisorbs molecularly with a coverage of 0.25 ML. Bonding to the surface is via the carbonyl oxygen atom with the molecular ring tilted with respect to the surface plane and little rehybridization from the gas phase. DFT calculations predict adorption at an atop site. Cyclohexanone undergoes facile dissociation on Pt(111), and only 30% of the monolayer adsorbs reversibly. Desorption occurs at 257 K with an activation energy of about 16 kcal/mol. Decomposition during TPD, which begins below 200 K, produced only gas-phase CO, H2, H2O, and traces of CH4 at the lowest coverages. Reaction-rate-limited desorption of these products shows that an adsorbed hydrocarbon intermediate is formed, but this species was not identified in HREEL spectra.
Chemisorption of C6H10O on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) alloy at 90 K is molecular in a similar geometry and the same coverage as on Pt(111). Cyclohexanane is 95% reversibly adsorbed, with desorption occurring at 239 K with an activation energy of about 15 kcal/mol. C6H10O decomposition liberates only CO and H2 during TPD. The (√3 × √3)R30° alloy adsorbs C6H10O only weakly, with desorption occurring at 224 K with an activation energy of about 14 kcal/mol, and the monolayer is completely reversibly adsorbed under UHV conditions, that is, no thermal decomposition occurred during TPD.
Alloying Sn with Pt strongly deactivates the surface, reducing slightly the adsorption energy of cyclohexanone and greatly reducing the amount of decomposition on the surface from 70% on Pt(111) to below 5% on the alloys. DFT calculations, in agreement with HREEL spectra, find that cyclohexanone adsorbs at low temperatures in a molecular form bonding through the oxygen of the C═O carbonyl with a tilted geometry. DFT calculations identify an atop adsorption site on Pt(111) and that cyclohexanone bonds preferentially to Sn on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) alloy with a similar geometry and stability as on Pt(111). Bonding to Pt with neighboring Sn is significantly destabilized. Moreover, DFT calculations show that whereas cyclohexanone can form a strongly bound chemisorbed species on a Pt−Pt bridged site through rehybridization of the carbonyl group to form a −C−O− single bond, no such chemisorbed analogue was identified as a stable species on the Sn/Pt(111) alloys. Since this species is a likely precursor for decomposition, this computational result indicates that the decomposition pathway on Sn/Pt(111) is different with a higher activation energy and, thus, provides insight into the experimentally observed reduction in decomposition with increasing Sn content.
