Abstract
Supported Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation reaction potential for advanced and greener syntheses of many special and fine chemicals in organic chemistry, but their potential for applications has been hampered by their generally observed low activity arising from the intrinsic nobleness of gold to H2 activation. This work deals with a synergy between Au NPs and their carrying Pt entities in Pt-on-Au nanostructures (coded as Ptm∧Au, m denoting the atomic Pt/Au ratio) for hydrocinnamaldehyde production in the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. Ptm∧Au immobilized on a noninteracting SiO2 support (Ptm∧Au/SiO2) showed activity 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that of monometallic Pt/SiO2 and Au/SiO2 catalysts. The high activity of Ptm∧Au nanostructures also remained distinct on interacting support materials such as Al2O3 and carbon and when varying the reaction temperature, H2 pressure, or both. Kinetic assessments suggest that the hydrogenation reaction could occur according to a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, in which cinnamaldehyde adsorbed on the Au surface was attacked by hydrogen atoms activated by Pt entities in the nanostructured Ptm∧Au catalysts. Pt dispersion or the size of the Pt entities and Pt–Au boundary, as well, strongly affected this synergic catalysis.

Introduction
Information gained during the last couple of decades indicates that supported Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) are emerging as selective catalysts for many organic reactions, including oxidation (1-3) and hydrogenation (4-8) as well as some coupling (9, 10) reactions, which are of potential for advanced and greener organic syntheses. Chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to their semihydrogenated products, that is, saturated aldehydes from hydrogenation at the C═C bond conjugated with the carbonyl group or unsaturated alcohols from hydrogenation at the C═O bond, is a critical route in the syntheses of many important chemicals, such as fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and others. (11) Supported Au NPs were found highly selective for the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, including cinnamaldehyde (CAL), (12-15) acrolein, (16, 17) crotonaldehyde, (18, 19) and others. (20, 21) Some elegant investigations have identified that the key factors affecting the hydrogenation catalysis would include the size and morphology of Au NPs, (13, 14, 16-19) the nature of the supporting materials, (12-14, 18) and the reaction conditions, as well. (14, 21) However, the hydrogenation activity of Au was usually much lower than that of platinum-group metals, (13, 18, 19) which severely impairs practical application of Au catalysts.
The low activity of Au for hydrogenation reactions was generally attributed to an “intrinsic” nobleness of Au for H2 activation. The dissociative adsorption of H2 on Au is an activated process, which would be restricted only at the edge and corner sites (22, 23) or perimeter interfaces of Au NPs in close contact with an oxide support. (24) This H2 activation step was believed to be the rate-limiting step in several hydrogenation reactions, such as gas phase hydrogenation of butadiene (25) and liquid phase hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. (8) The chemisorption of H2 on Au NPs was found very sensitive to the presence of a more active metal (e.g., Pt). (23, 26) In this light, Corma et al. showed that the activity of Au/TiO2 for chemoselective hydrogenation of nitrostyrene was enhanced remarkably after it was impregnated with a small amount of Pt. (8)
We showed earlier that Au NPs immobilized on SiO2 (Au/SiO2) were highly selective for the formation of hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL) in the hydrogenation of CAL. (14) We also communicated (15) very recently that the activity of Au NPs (3.0 nm) in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, including CAL, furfural, and chalcones, can be dramatically improved (up to 70-fold) when a very small amount of fully dispersed Pt entities was properly loaded at the surface of Au NPs to form Pt-on-Au nanostructures (coded as Ptm∧Au, m denoting the atomic Pt/Au ratio (27-30)). It was proposed that the Pt entities in these catalytic nanostructures were serving as the activity promoter of Au NPs, since the selectivity propensity of Au NPs for the hydrogenation reactions was not changed by the presence of Pt.
This work presents a systematic investigation on the characteristics of immobilized Ptm∧Au nanostructures in hydrogenation catalysis using CAL hydrogenation as a probe reaction. Ptm∧Au NPs of varying compositions (0 ≤ m ≤ 0.2) are immobilized onto three different supporting materials (that is, noninteracting SiO2 and interacting Al2O3 and carbon) to understand any possible support effect. The influences of reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure on the hydrogenation catalysis of these immobilized Ptm∧Au catalysts are also disclosed. Kinetic analysis of the hydrogenation reaction is conducted to gain information on the catalytic mechanism and synergy between Pt and Au in the catalytic Ptm∧Au nanostructures.
Experimental Methods
Preparation of Au and Ptm∧Au NPs
Au NPs were prepared as PVA-stabilized colloidal particles (3.0 ± 0.6 nm) by reduction of AuCl4– ions in aqueous solution containing HAuCl4 (99%, Acros) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, CP, Beijing Chemical Reagent Company, typical repeating units 1750) with NaBH4 (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), as described elsewhere. (2, 14, 15, 28-30) In a typical procedure, 200 mL of 0.25 mM HAuCl4 solution was mixed with 1 mL of PVA solution (10 mg mL–1). The solution was stirred for 1 h, and then 5 mL of fresh 0.1 M NaBH4 solution was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. The resulting wine-colored solution was kept under stirring for 2 h to ensure complete AuCl4– reduction to form Au NPs. The produced Au NPs showed a narrow size distribution at 3.0 ± 0.6 nm, and were used later to prepare Ptm∧Au nanostructures.
Ptm∧Au NPs (0.005 ≤ m ≤ 0.2) were synthesized by reductive deposition of Pt onto the preformed PVA-stabilized Au NPs, as previously described. (15, 28-30) In the preparation of Pt0.05∧Au NPs, for example, 50 mL of 0.05 mM K2PtCl6 (AR, Beijing Chemical Reagent Company) solution (2.5 μmol Pt) was mixed with the as-prepared colloidal Au solution (ca. 50 μmol Au). The mixed solution was stirred for 2 h and then purged with N2 for 30 min, followed by bubbling with H2 for another 2 h. A gradual Pt deposition on the Au NPs was evidenced by the solution color change from wine red to dark brown. When the H2 bubbling was stopped, the colloidal solution was sealed airtight and was then allowed to remain undisturbed for 48 h to ensure complete Pt deposition. Element analysis (ICP-AES) showed that Pt deposition during these syntheses was 100% quantitative.
Immobilization of Au and Ptm∧Au NPs and Postsynthesis Treatment
Three support materials—SiO2 (90 m2 g–1, Degussa Aerosil 90), Al2O3 (160 m2 g–1) prepared from hydrolysis of Al(NO3)3 with aqueous ammonia solution, (31) and carbon black (250 m2 g–1, Vulcan XC-72)—were employed to immobilize Au and Ptm∧Au NPs. It should be noted that the Au NPs were also subjected before the immobilization process to a H2 bubbling treatment but without the addition of K2PtCl6.
Immobilization of Au or Ptm∧Au NPs with SiO2 and Al2O3 supports was conducted using procedures reported previously. (2, 14, 15) In brief, desirable amounts of the support materials were added into colloidal solutions containing Au or Ptm∧Au NPs, followed by careful adjustment of the solution acidity (pH = 0.5 in the case of SiO2, pH = 6.0 in the case of Al2O3) with aqueous solution of HNO3 under vigorous stirring. HNO3 solution of different concentrations (0.2, 1.0, and 3.2 M) was alternatively used to avoid any rapid drop in the pH. The solids were then separated by filtration, followed by extensive washing with deionized water and drying at 110 °C; the actual Au loadings in these samples were ∼1.0 wt % by ICP-AES analysis.
The immobilization of Au or Ptm∧Au NPs with carbon (XC-72) was conducted following the procedure detailed previously. (27-30) Briefly, a desirable amount of Vulcan XC-72 carbon black was added to a colloidal solution containing Au or Ptm∧Au NPs. After adjustment of the solution acidity (pH = 1.5) with an aqueous solution of HNO3, the mixed solution was refluxed for 2 h under vigorous stirring. The solids were then separated by filtration, followed by extensively washing with deionized water and drying at 110 °C to produce Au/XC-72 or Ptm∧Au/XC-72 catalyst; the actual Au loadings on the carbon support were ∼5.0 wt % by ICP-AES analysis.
Preparation of Bimetallic Pt–Au/SiO2 Catalyst
A bimetallic Pt–Au/SiO2 sample was also prepared for comparison purposes by impregnating Pt on our standard Au/SiO2 sample according to the procedure of Corma et al. (8) Briefly, 1.0 g of Au/SiO2 sample prepared as above was added to 50 mL of 0.05 mM K2PtCl6 solution. After stirring at room temperature for 24 h, the suspension liquids were evaporated at 60 °C using a rotary evaporator. The solids obtained as such were dried at 110 °C. This reference sample was denoted as Pt0.05-Au/SiO2, as the atomic Pt/Au ratio was 0.05 according to the ICP-AES analysis.
Two reference SiO2-supported Pt catalysts with Pt loading of 1 wt % (1Pt/SiO2–Sigma; BET surface area: 275 m2/g) and 5 wt % Pt (5Pt/SiO2–Strem; BET surface area: 400 m2/g) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Lot no: 07204HU) and Strem (Lot no: 18091300), respectively. The Pt dispersions in these two samples were lower than 0.30. Another Pt/SiO2 sample with fully dispersed Pt was prepared according the method of Miller et al. (32)
Characterizations
The actual loadings of Au and Pt in each of the as-prepared samples were determined by ICP-AES analysis (Leeman2000 Prodigy spectrometer). The morphology and size distribution of Au and Ptm∧Au NPs before and after immobilization were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Tecnai G2 F20 U-Twin system operating at 200 kV. At least 300 particles were randomly measured to determine the mean diameter of Au and Ptm∧Au NPs according to the equation d = Σ nidi/Σ ni, where ni and di are the number and diameter of the NPs, respectively.
The dispersions of Pt (DPt) in Ptm∧Au NPs were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement of immobilized Ptm∧Au NPs on XC-72. The cyclic voltammetry was conducted in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1. Given the well-established hydrogen-adsorption stoichiometry at a Pt surface (H/Pt = 1:1), the number of the exposed Pt atoms (Ns) was counted as the number of adsorbed hydrogen atoms (NH) by integrating the charge consumed for hydrogen desorption (QH) on the CV curve, that is Ns = NH = QH/Qe, where Qe is the elementary charge or charge of an electron (1.602 × 10–19 C). Thus, the ratio of Ns to the total number of Pt atoms (Nt) in the catalyst gives the dispersion of Pt: DPt = Ns/Nt. Further details for these measurements were given in refs 27−30.
The dispersion of Pt (DPt) in the reference Pt/SiO2 catalysts was determined by H2-TPD measurement, which was conducted on homemade equipment as described previously. (33) The sample was first reduced at 300 °C in 5 vol % H2–Ar flow for 1 h and then held at 150 °C for 1 h before cooling to room temperature in the same gas flow. The gas flow was then switched to a flow of ultrahigh purity Ar (99.999%), which was further online purified by flowing through two traps containing 5A zeolite and MnOx-based deoxidant, respectively. The temperature ramp was 10 °C/min. The number of exposed Pt atoms in the sample was counted as the number of H atoms in the desorbed H2 molecules measured from the H2-TPD experiment.
Catalytic Test and Product Analysis
Hydrogenation reactions were performed on a high-pressure batch reactor equipped with a Parr 4843 controller and a 25 mL Hastelloy autoclave. Unless otherwise specified, the autoclave was loaded with 5 mL of toluene (AR, Beijing Chemical Reagent Company), 0.5 mL of CAL (AR, Sigma-Aldrich), and 50 mg of catalyst (molar CAL/Au = 1600). After purging with H2 (∼0.8 MPa) six times, the autoclave was pressurized to a desired H2 pressure (e.g., 1.0 MPa) at room temperature. Zero reaction time was taken as soon as the autoclave was heated to the reaction temperature (e.g., 150 °C), and the mechanical stirring (900 rpm) was not switched on until that very moment. Preliminary experiments performed using varying stirring speeds (in the range of 500–1200 rpm) showed that the selected stirring speed (900 rpm) enabled the reaction to proceed in the absence of diffusion limitation under the present reaction conditions. The absence of mass transfer effect on the reaction rate in our system was also double-checked by changing the catalyst mass (10–75 mg) for the reaction and applying the Madon–Boudart test (34) using Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalyst of varied metal loadings, as shown in Figure 1.

An ice–water bath was used to cool the autoclave at the end of each reaction. The reacted liquid was separated from catalyst powders by filtration and then analyzed by a HP-7890A gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a Shimadzu HiCap CBP20 capillary column and a flame ionization detector. Product identification was double-checked, when necessary, with a HP-6890 GC equipped with a HP-5973 mass selective detector.

Characterization of Ptm∧Au Nanostructures
Shown in Figure 2 are representative TEM images of colloidal and immobilized Au and Ptm∧Au NPs. The colloidal Au NPs were nearly monodispersed and spherically shaped with sizes in the range 3.0 ± 0.6 nm (Figure 2a). The Ptm∧Au NPs showed similar sizes and size distributions (Figure 2a, b). (-28, 30) Some representative TEM images for the silica immobilized Au (Au/SiO2) and Ptm∧Au NPs (Ptm∧Au/SiO2) samples are shown as Figure 2c–f. Compared with their unimmobilized counterparts in colloidal solutions, the immobilized Au and Pt0.05∧Au NPs showed slightly larger sizes, but their size distributions still remained quite narrow. The TEM images of metal particles for Ptm∧Au/Al2O3 and Ptm∧Au/XC-72 samples of m = 0 and 0.05 (data not shown) were found very similar to those of Ptm∧Au/SiO2 with the same composition, suggesting that the features of these Ptm∧Au NPs were not changed during the immobilization process. (15, 28-30) The sizes of Ptm∧Au NPs in Ptm∧Au/SiO2 became a little larger with the increase in m (Figure 2d–f) due to increased covering of Pt at the Au surfaces.

Quantitative measurement of Pt dispersion in Ptm∧Au NPs was done via an electrochemical approach; namely, CV in acidic solution of the Ptm∧Au/XC-72 samples. (27-30) Figure 3 shows some typical CV curves for several Ptm∧Au/XC-72 samples (0 ≤ m ≤ 0.2) recorded at room temperature in N2-purged 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The signals in the potential region of −0.2 to 0.14 V (relative to a saturated calomel electrode) are distinctive of hydrogen adsorption/desorption chemistry associated only with the Pt entities in the samples (Au NPs were inert for this chemistry; see the insert in Figure 3 and also refs 28−30). The charge associated with the hydrogen desorption peaks (i.e., positive peaks on the CV curves) was used to obtain Pt dispersion data (DPt), (-27-30) which are listed in the second column of Table 1. The Pt entities were found fully dispersed (DPt ≈ 0.99) in the Ptm∧Au samples at m ≤ 0.05. In other words, every Pt atom in these samples was exposed and could be available for surface catalysis. (15, 27, 28) The Pt dispersion decreased to 0.90 and 0.62, respectively, when m was increased to 0.1 and 0.2. The hydrogen desorption peak shifted toward lower potential for Ptm∧Au/XC-72 with the decrease in m, which could give a hint of the dispersive structure of Pt entities in Pt0.01∧Au and Pt0.005∧Au NPs. (28) These results in combination with previous comprehensive characterizations (UV–vis, SERS, XPS, and XRD) (27-30) would suggest that Pt entities exist as highly dispersed (DPt ≥ 0.60) cluster islands or two-dimensional rafts at the surfaces of Au NPs in the Ptm∧Au samples (m ≤ 0.2).

Chemoselective Hydrogenation of CAL
Shown in Scheme 1 are the reactions that could be involved in the hydrogenation of CAL. Hydrogenation at the C═C bond produces hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), an important intermediate for the syntheses of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of AIDS, (35) whereas hydrogenation at the C═O bond produces cinnamyl alcohol (COL), a pharmaceutical intermediate for syntheses of cinnarizine, naftifine, toremifene, etc. Further hydrogenation of these two semihydrogenated products would lead to hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL). To avoid a potential transfer hydrogenation of CAL with hydrogen-releasing solvent (for example, benzyl alcohol (15)), toluene was employed as the solvent because it was inert during the hydrogenation reaction. (14, 15)

Effect of Pt Entities in Ptm∧Au/SiO2
Figure 4 presents the effect of Pt in Ptm∧Au/SiO2 on the catalytic hydrogenation of CAL. Au/SiO2 catalyst with no Pt (m = 0) showed a strong propensity toward the formation of HCAL (73% selectivity) but produced a low CAL conversion (∼4%) in a reaction period of 4 h under the standard reaction condition (150 °C, PH2 = 1.0 MPa). The deposition of a very small amount of Pt (m = 0.005, Pt loading = ∼0.005 wt %) on the Au NPs elevated the CAL conversion to 20%, a 5-fold increment in the same duration of reaction (4 h). Increasing m to 0.01 and 0.05 resulted in increments of the CAL conversion to 38% and 65%, respectively. However, the conversion of CAL was not enhanced on further increasing the Pt amount to m = 0.1 (66%) and even decreased to 47% at m = 0.2. It should be noted that the hydrogenation selectivity to HCAL over these Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts basically remained unchanged (75–80%, Figure 4).
Figure 4

For a rigorous comparison of the catalytic activity of Au in these Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts, the CAL conversion level was restrained in the range of 11–20% by adjusting the duration of the catalytic reaction (Table 1). The CAL conversion data were then used to calculate the reaction rates by CAL consumption according to the mass of gold (MSAAu, mass specific activity of Au, in mol h–1 gAu–1) and the number of exposed metal atoms (TOF, turnover frequency, s–1). The MSAAu numbers are listed in the second to last column of Table 1. The MSAAu for Au/SiO2 (m = 0) was as low as 0.07 mol h–1 gAu–1 and was enhanced to 6-, 11-, 68-, 73- and 68-fold higher for Ptm∧Au/SiO2 of m = 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. It is of interest to note that the catalysts of m = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 showed very close MSAAu numbers (4.8–5.1 mol h–1 gAu–1). In contrast to the dramatic activity change, the product selectivity was found not affected by the deposition of Pt entities. The product distribution of CAL hydrogenation over Au/SiO2 and Ptm∧Au/SiO2 (columns 5–7 in Table 1) was very close: the selectivity to HCAL was in the range of 71–79%, and that to COL, 15–23%. It should be noted that this kind of product distribution was not changed when the conversion of CAL was increased up to 87% over the Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 (see Table 1).
An obviously different product distribution was observed over the two Pt/SiO2 catalysts, 1Pt/SiO2–Sigma (DPt = 0.16) and 5Pt/SiO2–Strem (DPt = 0.25) (Table 1), which could be related to the effect of Pt dispersion. (36) The product selectivity over the former catalyst (HCAL selectivity of 53%, COL selectivity of 40%) was quite different but that over the latter catalyst (HCAL selectivity of 84%, and COL selectivity of 13%) resembled those over the Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts. To ascertain the effect of Pt dispersion in Pt/SiO2 on the reaction selectivity, we prepared according to the report of Miller et al. (32) another Pt/SiO2 catalyst (i.e., 1Pt/SiO2–NH3) that contained fully dispersed Pt (DPt ≈ 99). The product distribution over this 1Pt/SiO2–NH3 catalyst also demonstrates a high selectivity for HCAL (79%) over fully dispersed metallic Pt catalyst. Thus, the selectivity characteristics of Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts are more similar to those of Au/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 featuring highly dispersed Pt, rather than those of Pt/SiO2 with poorly dispersed Pt. (36) These results indicate that the deposition of a small amount of highly dispersed Pt on the Au surface dramatically enhanced the Au activity for CAL hydrogenation without altering the selectivity propensity of Au NPs.
The numbers in the last column of Table 1 show the turnover frequency of CAL based on exposed Pt (TOFPt), assuming that the exposed Pt atoms were the catalytic sites responsible for the observed activity. Compared with the data for the reference Pt/SiO2 catalysts (0.03–0.24 s–1), the TOFPt for every Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalyst was 1–2 orders of magnitude higher (2.1–5.2 s–1). In addition, it is worth noting that among the Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts, the fully dispersed Pt (DPt ≈ 0.99 at m ≤ 0.05) showed very similar TOFPt numbers (4.4–5.2 s–1) that were significantly higher than those for the samples with less dispersed Pt (Ptm∧Au/SiO2 at m ≥ 0.1). The surprisingly low TOFPt of the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, though increased with a decrease in the Pt dispersion (0.03 s–1 at DPt = 0.99 and 0.24 s–1 at DPt = 0.16), would suggest a synergic effect between the Pt entities and the Au NPs in the Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts, which will be addressed in the discussion later.
A recent study on chemoselective hydrogenation of nitrostyrene by Corma et al. found that the catalytic activity of 1.5%Au/TiO2 catalyst (World Gold Council) was remarkably improved after it was loaded by impregnation with very small amounts of Pt. (8) The activity based on exposed Au atoms (or mass of Au if the sizes of Au NPs were not changed) was improved by 8 times at a loading of 0.01% Pt (Pt/Au = 0.007, denoted as 1.5%Au@0.01%Pt/TiO2 in ref 8), without scarifying the chemoselectivity for vinylaniline (>90%) of the original 1.5%Au/TiO2 catalyst.
In the present work, a bimetallic Pt0.05–Au/SiO2 catalyst (Pt/Au = 0.05) was prepared according to the method of Corma et al.; (8) that is, by impregnation of Pt onto our standard Au/SiO2 catalyst. We would anticipate that most Pt in this Pt0.05–Au/SiO2 sample would land directly on the surface of the SiO2 support, since the immobilized Au NPs in the standard Au/SiO2 could occupy only a small part of the SiO2 surface (less than 1%). The catalytic CAL hydrogenation data over this Pt0.05–Au/SiO2 catalyst are compared in Table 1 with those of Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts. Although the chemoselectivity property of Pt0.05–Au/SiO2 (75% of HCAL and 20% of COL) varied little from those of Ptm∧Au/SiO2 (Table 1), the MSAAu for Pt0.05–Au/SiO2 was improved only up to 15-fold of the standard Au/SiO2 catalyst. This 15-fold activity enhancement is far inferior to the 68-fold improvement obtained over Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2, suggesting that the Pt-on-Au nanostructure is more efficient than the bimetallic Pt0.05–Au/SiO2 catalyst in promoting the hydrogenation catalysis.
In the study of Corma et al., (8) the bimetallic Pt–Au/TiO2 catalysts preserved the chemoselectivity of the Au catalyst only at very low Pt loadings (Pt/Au ≤ 0.007). Significant decline in the chemoselectivity was observed when the Pt loading in Pt–Au/TiO2 was increased to higher than 0.05 wt % (Pt/Au > 0.033). For instance, the selectivity for vinylaniline was lowered from 90+% over 1.5% Au/TiO2 and 0.01% Pt–1.5% Au/TiO2 to less than 40% over 0.2% Pt–1.5% Au/TiO2 (Pt/Au = 0.13, denoted as 1.5%Au@0.2%Pt/TiO2 in ref 8), such a low chemoselectivity actually signified the characteristics of Pt/TiO2 catalyst. (8) In contrast, the present Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts can maintain the chemoselectivity of Au NPs for CAL hydrogenation even when the Pt loading was as high as 0.2 wt % (m = 0.2)
Effect of Support Material
The nature of the support material would remarkably affect the performance of the Au catalyst. (12-14, 18) The interacting supports such as Al2O3 and carbon (XC-72) were used as alternatives to the noninteracting SiO2 support to immobilize Au and Pt0.05∧Au NPs. The Au/Al2O3 and Au/XC-72 catalysts were found significantly more active than Au/SiO2 for CAL hydrogenation, as the MSAAu numbers for the former two catalysts were 3–4 times higher than that of Au/SiO2 (Table 1). The enhanced activity of Au NPs in these Au/Al2O3 and Au/XC-72 catalysts could be ascribed to a promoted H2 activation at the interfaces between the interacting support and Au NPs (24) or by the function of surface hydroxyl groups on Al2O3 and carbon materials. (25, 37) The Pt0.05∧Au/Al2O3 and Pt0.05∧Au/XC-72 catalysts also showed dramatically higher activity than their counterparts without Pt: the MSAAu for Pt0.05∧Au/Al2O3 was 16-fold higher than that for Au/Al2O3, whereas a 14-fold enhancement in MSAAu was registered for Pt0.05∧Au/XC-72 than that for Au/XC-72 (Table 1), indicating that the promotion effect of Pt on the catalytic activity of Au NPs also prevails on the interacting supports.
On the other hand, the interacting supports strongly affected the product selectivity of the Au NPs. (12-14, 18) In the present study, changing the support from the noninteracting SiO2 to the interacting Al2O3 and carbon increased the selectivity for COL production from ∼20 to ∼30% at the expense of losing the selectivity for HCAL production. However, the selectivity for the fully hydrogenated product HCOL was little affected by the nature of the support materials. Lewis acid sites at the surface of Al2O3 would favor the adsorption of CAL with the carbonyl group, which could be responsible for the increased selectivity for COL. (38) The supporting carbon material could act as an electron-donating macroligand, which would lead to electron-rich Au NPs and enable the higher selectivity for COL. (39) Interestingly, the product distribution obtained with the Pt0.05∧Au/Al2O3 and Pt0.05∧Au/XC-72 catalysts deviated significantly from those with the Au/Al2O3 and Au/XC-72 and instead resembled those with the Au/SiO2 and Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts (Table 1). These results clearly indicate that the catalysis of Ptm∧Au NPs is insensitive to the nature of the support materials, although the catalysis of its counterpart Au NPs was sensitive to metal–support interaction.
Effects of Reaction Temperature and H2 Pressure
It is known that the chemoselectivity in hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes depends significantly on the reaction temperature and H2 pressure. (14, 21) Au and Pt0.05∧Au NPs immobilized on the noninteracting support SiO2 were then used to show the effects of reaction temperature and H2 pressure (PH2) on the hydrogenation of CAL. To reduce the deviation in measuring the catalytic rates, CAL conversion levels in these experiments were also limited to <20% by adjusting the duration of the reaction (Au/SiO2) and the amount of catalyst when necessary (Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2). Table 2 shows the catalytic results. The data in the last column give the global reaction rates by CAL consumption normalized to the catalyst mass (mmol h–1 gcat–1). Increasing the reaction temperature from 150 to 195 °C for Au/SiO2 and from 135 to 180 °C for Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 resulted in continuous shortening of the reaction period for achieving a certain CAL conversion (∼15% for Au/SiO2 and ∼5% for Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2). The reaction rate increased 5-fold for both Au/SiO2 and Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalysts when the reaction temperature was elevated by 45 °C. The nearly parallel Arrhenius plots derived from the reaction rates over Au/SiO2 and Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalysts are shown in Figure 5. The corresponding apparent activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (A) were 59 kJ mol–1 and 4.1 mmol h–1 gcat–1 for Au/SiO2 and 55 kJ mol–1 and 40.0 mmol h–1 gcat–1 for Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalyst (Table 4). These Ea numbers are lower than the activation energy (Ea = ∼65 kJ mol–1) of CAL hydrogenation over Pd/C catalyst in toluene solvent. (40)

On the other hand, the two catalysts responded quite differently to the reaction temperature with regard to product distribution. When the reaction temperature was elevated from 150 to 195 °C, the HCAL selectivity over Au/SiO2 catalyst decreased from 73% to 55%, but the COL selectivity increased from 23% to 40%. In contrast, the product selectivity over Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 was kept essentially unchanged with the reaction temperature. The higher selectivity to COL over Au/SiO2 catalyst at higher reaction temperature could be explained by a significantly higher barrier in C═O bond activation, since the dissociation energy of the C═O bond is 33 kcal mol–1 larger than that for the C═C bond. (14, 41) Thus, the selectivity for C═O bond hydrogenation was enhanced with an increase in the reaction temperature over Au/SiO2 catalyst. This reaction temperature effect on the product selectivity was not evident over Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2; that is, the presence of Pt entities on Au NPs made the chemoselectivity insensitive to the reaction temperature.
H2 dissociation is a very demanding surface reaction on Au that would occur only on edge and corner sites, but it becomes a facile reaction involving no activation barriers on a Pt surface. (26) We investigated the effect of hydrogen pressure on CAL hydrogenation over Au/SiO2 and Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalyst to gain information on the effect of Pt entities on the catalysis of Au in Ptm∧Au/SiO2 samples. Table 3 lists the catalytic results as well as the global reaction rates by CAL consumption. Increasing PH2 from 1.0 to 5.0 MPa for Au/SiO2 and from 0.5 to 4.0 MPa for Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 resulted in continuous shortening of the reaction period for achieving a CAL conversion around 10%. When PH2 was increased from 1.0 to 4.0 MPa, the reaction rate over Au/SiO2 catalyst increased 11-fold. The same increase in H2 pressure for the reaction over the Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalyst effected only a 5-fold increase in the reaction rate. Figure 6 presents the relationships between the reaction rate and PH2 for both catalysts. The line slopes in this figure would give the partial reaction order with respect to H2, which was 1.29 over Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalyst and 1.65 over Au/SiO2 catalyst (Table 4).
Figure 6
Figure 6. Effect of H2 pressure on the overall rate of cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation over Au/SiO2 and Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalysts.
For Au/SiO2, the selectivity for HCAL decreased from 73% at PH2 = 1.0 MPa to ∼50% at PH2 ≥ 3.0 MPa, but at the same time, the selectivity for COL increased from 23% to around 40%. The hydrogen pressure effect on the selectivity of HCAL could be ascribed to a competitive adsorption of hydrogen with CAL on the Au sites. (21) For Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2, however, the product distribution was little affected when the PH2 was raised from 0.5 to 4.0 MPa (Table 3).
Kinetic modeling
Kinetic assessments of the CAL hydrogenation reaction on Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 were performed using catalytic data obtained at 150 °C under different PH2 with the CAL conversion being limited to lower than 10% (Table 3). According to Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics, the following elementary steps, including reactant activation by adsorption of CAL (I) and H2 (II), surface reaction between the adsorbed reactants (III) and desorption of product (IV), could be proposed as the key steps for the overall hydrogenation reaction:
HCAL was used as the representative product because it was the dominant compound in the products. Any product adsorption on the catalyst surface would be of no kinetic consequence, since the experiment kinetic rates were obtained with very high reactant/product ratios (the CAL conversion was <10%; Table 3) and the desorption of product (IV) would not be considered as a candidate for the rate-determining step.
Shown in Table 5 are the rate expressions when step I, II, and III were assumed, respectively, to be the rate-determining step. Note that only the rate-determining step could be taken as the irreversible step in deriving the rate expression. The two reactants (CAL and H2) could adsorb with two possibilities: they could adsorb competitively on the same kind of surface sites or independently on two different kinds of surface sites. The two rate expressions for the surface reaction kinetics in Table 5 correspond to these two possibilities. Mathematical reformulation of the equations led to the linearized forms with respect to PH2. Linear regression using the experiment reaction rates under different PH2 over the Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalyst (Table 3) produced the fitness results (R2), which are given in the last column of Table 5. Apparently, the last kinetic model showed the highest fitness to the experiment data (R2 = 0.995). Therefore, the rate-determining step of CAL hydrogenation over Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts would be the surface reaction between independently adsorbed CAL molecules and H atoms on active sites of different nature. These kinetic assessments identify that the active sites responsible for H2 activation are different from those for CAL adsorption on Ptm∧Au/SiO2.

Discussion
This study corroborates our earlier observations (15) that a small amount of fully dispersed Pt deposits on Au NPs can lead to dramatic activity enhancement of the Au NPs for chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds without changing the selectivity propensity of Au NPs. All of the catalytic reaction data presented in this work, including those acquired with varying reaction temperature and H2 pressure, point to a synergic catalysis of Pt and Au in these Pt-on-Au (Ptm∧Au) nanostructures for the hydrogenation of CAL. It is further shown that the catalytic feature of Ptm∧Au was essentially not affected by the nature of their immobilizers or supporting materials.
To gain insight into the role of Pt in Ptm∧Au NPs for the hydrogenation catalysis, the reaction rates obtained on Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts were re-evaluated by normalizing the CAL consumption rate in Table 1 (CAL conversion, 11–20%) to the total number of exposed metal (Pt + Au) atoms on Ptm∧Au NPs without discriminating Pt and Au atoms (TOFexpt as shown in eq 1). The total number of exposed metal atoms on Ptm∧Au NPs was estimated according to the size of Ptm∧Au NPs in the Ptm∧Au/SiO2 samples, assuming that the NPs were cuboctahedrally structured. (42) For comparison, “theoretical” TOF numbers (TOFcal) were also calculated by assuming an additive surface catalysis of exposed Au and Pt atoms (eq 2), in which the exposed Au and Pt atoms served independently as the catalytically active sites for the hydrogenation reaction. The TOFAu and TOFPt in eq 2 were taken, respectively, as the experimental TOF numbers for the Au/SiO2 and 1Pt/SiO2–Sigma catalysts; the latter showed the highest TOFPt among the three Pt/SiO2 catalysts (0.24 s–1, Table 1). In addition, the XPt refers in eq 2 to Pt coverage on Au NPs, which was obtained with the assumption that every exposed Pt atom would bury one surface Au atom, (27, 28) according to (eq 3).
Figure 7 shows the dependence of the experimental and theoretical TOF of Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts on the Pt loading (m). It is seen that TOFexpt for Ptm∧Au/SiO2 increased steeply from 0.014 s–1 (m = 0) to around 1.0 s–1 when m increased up to m = 0.05 and then leveled off at m ≥ 0.1. It is of interest to note that the TOFexpt number for every Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalyst at m > 0.005 was one magnitude higher than its corresponding TOFcal. These results clearly demonstrate a synergy between Au NPs and their carrying Pt entities in Ptm∧Au nanostructures for the catalytic hydrogenation of CAL.

We showed in our preliminary communication that when benzyl alcohol was used instead of H2 as the H-source for CAL hydrogenation (i.e., transfer hydrogenation reaction) over the same Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts, no synergic effect between Pt and Au could be observed. (15) Thus, the remarkable higher catalytic activity of Ptm∧Au/SiO2 for CAL hydrogenation using molecular H2 would rely heavily on Pt promotion of H2 activation. The present comparison of the H2 pressure effect on the catalysis of Au/SiO2 and Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 for CAL hydrogenation is in strong support of this catalytic chemistry. The partial reaction order with respect to H2 decreased substantially from 1.65 for Au/SiO2 to 1.29 for Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 (Table 4), which indicates that H2 activation became less critical or much easier over the Ptm∧Au catalysts. Kinetic modeling of the hydrogenation reaction on Ptm∧Au/SiO2 (Table 5) further indicates that H2 and CAL would not compete for the same kind of adsorption sites: they adsorb respectively on two kinds of active sites with different properties in the Ptm∧Au nanostructures.
The activation energies and pre-exponential factors obtained from the Arrhenius plots for CAL hydrogenation over Au/SiO2 and Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalysts (Table 4) indicate that the Pt enhancement of the Au activity was not due to a lowered energy barrier for the overall reaction, but the significantly increased pre-exponential factor (4.1 mmol h–1 gcat–1 for Au/SiO2 versus 40.0 mmol h–1 gcat–1 for Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2; Table 4). Because H2 activation on Pt involves no activation barrier, (26) it appears reasonable that Pt entities on the Au NPs functioned as the new and more efficient catalytic sites for the H2 activation and the uncovered Au sites were responsible for the adsorption/activation of the substrate CAL. The activated H atoms would then react with their nearby CAL molecules adsorbed on the Au surface, adopting the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism (Table 5).
It is interesting to note that the synergy between Pt and Au in the hydrogenation catalysis over the Ptm∧Au nanostructures depended sensitively on the Pt dispersion (DPt) at the surface of Au NPs. The rate enhancement in either MSAAu (Table 1) or TOFexpt (Figure 7) was proportional to Pt loading (m) for the Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts containing only fully dispersed Pt entities on the Au NPs (m ≤ 0.05) but became almost insensitive to m for those catalysts containing less dispersed Pt entities (m ≥ 0.1). Thus, the fully dispersed Pt entities showed the highest efficiency in enabling the synergic hydrogenation catalysis. This is not surprising, since for Au NPs carrying a fixed amount of Pt, the Pt–Au boundary would be maximized when the Pt was deposited as fully dispersed entities. However, the Pt0.1∧Au/SiO2 catalyst of DPt = 0.90 would have much more Pt–Au boundary than a Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 of DPt = 0.99, but these two catalysts showed almost the same activity (Table 1). These comparisons suggest, therefore, that a proper proximity between Pt and Au sites would be required in the Ptm∧Au nanostructures to maximize the synergic catalysis. The lower TOFexpt (Figure 7) for the samples of m = 0.005 and 0.01 would be due to a significant percentage of Au sites not being in the as-required proximity of Pt in these two samples. The lower efficiency of Pt in the samples of m = 0.1 and 0.2, on the other hand, could be due to some overpopulation of Pt entities at the surface of Au NPs, which also reduced the average number of Au sites in the as-required proximity of Pt.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Synergy between Pt entities and their underlying Au NPs in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde.
The requirement for a proper proximity in maximizing the synergic catalysis could also explain why the bimetallic Pt0.05–Au/SiO2 catalyst showed a much lower activity than the Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2 catalyst (Table 1). In comparison with Pt0.05∧Au/SiO2, the bimetallic Pt0.05–Au/SiO2 catalyst could contain less dispersed Pt deposits, and a significant percentage of Pt could even be immobilized on the surface of SiO2 and have no contact with Au NPs, since the preparation by impregnation of Au/SiO2 with Pt cannot ensure a landing of Pt at the Au surface.
The Au NPs immobilized on the interacting Al2O3 and Vulcan XC-72 carbon showed significantly higher activity and lower selectivity for HCAL than the standard Au/SiO2 catalyst for the hydrogenation reaction of CAL. In contrast, the Pt0.05∧Au immobilized on the three support materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and Vulcan XC-72 carbon) showed similar activity and product selectivity in the reaction. These facts would demonstrate that the synergy between Au NPs and their carrying Pt well overweighed the effect of Au–support interaction on the hydrogenation catalysis (Table 1). Thus, the Pt entities in the immobilized Pt0.05∧Au catalysts dominated the activation of H2 during the hydrogenation reaction, which is consistent with the conclusion from the kinetic assessments.
The product selectivity over Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts appeared also insensitive to the reaction temperature and H2 pressure (Tables 2 and 3), which is again in strong contrast with the results obtained over the standard Au/SiO2 catalyst. It has been known that the adsorption mode of α,β-unsaturated compounds is critical to their hydrogenation selectivity. (21, 43, 44) The insensitivity of product selectivity to the reaction temperature and H2 pressure would hint that the presence of fully dispersed Pt entities on the surface of Au NPs could favor a specific adsorption mode for CAL activation. Further work is needed to uncover the details of CAL adsorption on Au and Ptm∧Au NPs.
Conclusions
Our data show that Pt in the nanostructured Ptm∧Au catalysts served as an efficient activity promoter to Au NPs in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds, by creating a new channel for H2 activation. A synergy between Pt and Au was operating in the hydrogenation of CAL, in which Pt and Au sites functioned, respectively, for the activation of H2 and CAL. The synergy depended critically on the dispersion of Pt entities and the Pt–Au proximity, but it was hardly affected by the temperature and H2 pressure of the reaction. The overall reaction rate was determined by a Langmuir–Hinshelwood surface reaction step between independently adsorbed CAL and H atoms over the Ptm∧Au/SiO2 catalysts. The well-maintained selectivity propensity for the hydrogenation reactions of Au catalyst in these novel Ptm∧Au nanostructures would have important implications for developing highly active nanogold catalysts, according to the metal-on-Au nanostructure models, for many selectivity-demanding hydrogenation reactions.
