3.2 Experimental Verification of Surface Segregation
DFT results predict that the surface 3d–Pt–Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen. Parallel experimental measurements have been performed to verify the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen, as well as to quantify the activation barrier for the adsorbate-induced segregation. To verify the oxygen-induced segregation, high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt–3d–Pt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen. (64) The onset of the characteristic ν(Ni–O) and ν(Co–O) vibrational modes confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt–3d–Pt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures. In addition, AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics. The AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt were used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen. Figure 7a shows that the normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases after exposing subsurface Pt–Ni–Pt(111) to increasing amounts of oxygen at various temperatures. The increase in the Ni/Pt AES ratio with higher oxygen exposures confirmed the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni atoms. Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data, such as that shown in Figure 7b, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is estimated to be 7 ± 1 and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol, respectively. This follows the trend predicted by DFT (Figure 6), where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier.
Experiments such as those shown in Figure 7 are extremely time-consuming to perform. Through the use of combined theory and experiments, an estimation for the activation barriers of other Pt–3d–Pt systems can be achieved using a Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationship. (33) The constants in the BEP relationship have been derived from the activation barriers for the Pt–Ni–Pt(111), Pt–Ni–Pt(100), and Pt–Co–Pt(111) surfaces. The results from this prediction are shown in Figure 8, where the left axis is the segregation energy and the right axis is scaled to show the corresponding BEP activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation. All of the Pt–3d–Pt(100) structures are predicted to have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt–3d–Pt(111) configuration. Among Pt–3d bimetallic surfaces, the Pt–Ni–Pt system is predicted to be the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, having the highest activation barriers for the (111) and (100) crystal facets. At the other extreme, the Pt–Ti–Pt surface is predicted to be the most susceptible to oxygen-induced segregation, having the lowest (100) activation barrier and an unactivated process on the (111) crystal facet.
In addition to segregation experiments performed under UHV conditions, the segregation of subsurface Co and Ni was also verified under ambient pressure using XANES (226) under in situ conditions. Using a polycrystalline Pt foil as the substrate, the Co and Ni atoms were found to undergo inward diffusion upon exposure to H2 and surface segregation after exposure to O2. These experimental observations further confirm the DFT prediction (Figure 6) that the Pt-terminated subsurface structure is stable with adsorbed hydrogen while the 3d-terminated surface structure is preferred with adsorbed oxygen.
Furthermore, such reversible behavior is extended to bimetallic nanoparticles. Mu et al. (209) have observed the reversible structural changes at the surfaces of supported Pt–Ni nanoparticles treated in alternating O2 and H2 atmospheres. Figure 9 shows the XPS Ni/Pt intensity ratio, which oscillates with the oxidation–reduction cycles. The XPS results indicate that the Pt–Ni nanoparticles surface is NiO-rich in oxidizing gases and Pt-terminated in reducing gases, consistent with the DFT predictions in Figure 6. Overall, the strong correlation between DFT prediction and experimental measurements, on both model surfaces and nanoparticles, provides conclusive evidence that the bimetallic structures change under different reaction environments. Such structural changes in turn modify the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts for different types of reactions, such as hydrogenation and oxidation reactions, as discussed in the next section.

In this section we divide the catalytic reactions into several categories: hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, reforming, and oxidation reactions. Table 3 summarizes selected UHV studies of the adsorption and reaction of different molecules on model bimetallic surfaces. Tables summarizing reactor studies over supported bimetallic catalysts based on the types of reactions are provided in the corresponding subsections. The main focus of the review is to identify general trends on how bimetallic catalysts enhance the activity and selectivity for each type of reaction. Special attention is paid to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts whenever possible.

4.1 Hydrogenation Reactions
Catalytic hydrogenations are among the most commonly practiced catalytic processes, ranging from common steps in organic synthesis to batch processes in pharmaceutical production, to stabilization of edible oils, and to petroleum upgrading processes. Because hydrogenation reactions are typically exothermic, it is advantageous to carry out these reactions at low temperatures. In the current section we will first use the hydrogenation of cyclohexene to demonstrate the feasibility of increasing the low-temperature hydrogenation activity by reducing the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, which can be achieved by designing bimetallic surfaces with specific surface structures. We will then discuss hydrogenation reactions of C═C, C═O, and N═O bonds to further illustrate the advantages of bimetallic catalysts in terms of both hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Hydrogenation studies under UHV conditions are summarized in Table 3; selected reactor studies of hydrogenation reactions over supported bimetallic catalysts are listed in Table 4
