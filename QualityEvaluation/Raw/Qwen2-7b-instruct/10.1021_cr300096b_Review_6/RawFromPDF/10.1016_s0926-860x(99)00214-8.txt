Structure and selectivity of metal catalysts: revisiting bimetallic zeolite systems
Abstract
The structures of Pt–Co/NaY and Ru–Co/NaY have been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Extended X-ray absorption fine spectra (EXAFS) and temperature programmed spectroscopy. Formation of the bimetallic particles inside the zeolite framework, the effect of pre-treatments using O2/H2, He/H2 and He/H2/O2/H2 on the structure of the small bimetallic particles have also been studied. The structure of the samples was related to the activity and selectivity in CO hydrogenation. Under mild oxygen treatment the Pt–Co bimetallic particles are separated leaving the platinum particles in the supercage and transferring the Co2+ ions into the sodalite cage or into the hexagonal prisms. Direct oxygen treatment on Ru/NaY results in the migration of the ruthenium particles to the external surface of the NaY, while the presence of cobalt in Ru–Co/NaY stabilizes the ruthenium inside the supercage. Conversely, EXAFS and XPS measurements indicate the reduction of Co2+ ions facilitated by ruthenium and platinum, but the catalyst structure can be described by a ‘cherry-type’ model containing cobalt as its kernel. As a result the major difference between mono- and bimetallic samples is mainly controlled by the location of the metal particles and the extent of reducibility of Co2+ ions. The olefin/paraffin ratio changes depending on the location of the metal particles, and the chain growth depends on the residence time of the species inside the zeolite. The major parameters governing the general behavior of zeolite-supported bimetallic particles, are discussed.
1. Introduction
Successful generation of bimetallic particles faces two major obstacles: (i) At extremely high metal loadings alloy particles are formed, but their characteristics are very much like those of unsupported bimetallic samples. Due to the large particle size, any interactions that might be developed between the metal and the support are minimized. (ii) At extremely low metal loadings the formation of alloy particles becomes uncertain as migration of the metal constituents is hampered, and sometimes one of the metal components cannot be reduced to the metallic state because of strong metal–support interactions stabilizing metal ions on the surface. Zeolites with definite framework structures could be possible candidates for preparing small metal- or bimetallic particles.
The major advantages of using zeolites are:
1.
geometrical constrains to forming particles in the nanoscale range,
2.
small particle size is associated with acid–base properties,
3.
electronic interaction of metal particles with the highly charged ions inside the framework,
4.
catalytic activity is superior to that of conventional catalysts.
The major disadvantages are:
1.
decomposition of bimetallic particles,
2.
migration of the metal particles to the external surface.
During the last decade in their pioneering works Sachtler and his school have carried out comprehensive investigations on the metal systems encapsulated in zeolite channels or supercages and have created both mono- and bimetallic particles. Several systems were investigated that form bimetallic clusters, such as Pt–Re/NaY

and Fe–Rh/NaY
[15]
. The major task in this research was to produce small, nanoscale metal particles which had been difficult to prepare using the incipient wetness technique. In the latter case the metal–support interaction plays a major role; when strong, easily the reducible metal ions are stabilized by this interaction
[15]
. At higher metal loadings a fraction of the impregnating ions forms a monolayer coverage on the support while the remaining fraction easily forms metal oxide precursors of large size.
However, the channels and supercages in the zeolite framework provide an ideal structure to prevent the formation of large metal particles at the external surface of zeolites provided that they can be stabilized inside the pores. This geometrical constraint governs the formation of metal- or bimetallic nanoparticles.
There are two additional effects that influence the catalytic activity of the metal nanoparticles located in a zeolite framework. The first is the presence of acid sites resulting from the reduction of the metal ions exchanged into the framework. That is, the cations located in the cation-exchange positions are replaced by the protons formed during reduction. The second feature is ascribed to the pore structure affecting the selectivity of a catalytic reaction. As an example, the selective hydrogenation of acetylene can be mentioned
[26]
. In the selective hydrogenation of acetylene over Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-ZSM-5 catalysts it was found that the latter produced a large amount of ethane and was not selective catalyst in ethylene production. This result could be explained by the multiple adsorption/desorption steps of the ethylene formed during transport in the zeolite channels to the gas phase. All these steps result in additional hydrogen uptake of ethylene which increase the ethane selectivity. On the other hand, on Pd/Al2O3 ethylene readsorption is less, and the ethane selectivity is lower. This phenomenon is important, for example, in the C1 chemistry, in CO hydrogenation or methane non-oxidative conversion to higher hydrocarbons. In both cases the chain length can be considerably altered by the pore structure of the zeolite framework accommodating metal particles.
Although some of these features have been addressed by Sachtler at al. in his various papers, in the present paper we wish to highlight some additional roles using the zeolite framework. These complementary effects could be (i) the geometrical constraint of the support (i.e. ion-exchanged zeolites versus impregnated zeolite/oxide) on the formation of bimetallic particles, and (ii) stability of the bimetallic particles during catalytic reaction and/or during other treatments (e.g. oxidation). Since the field is very broad this paper concerns itself with an in-depth study on systems containing cobalt, platinum, and ruthenium and their combinations.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Pt–Co/NaY samples
The Pt/NaY, Co/NaY and bimetallic Pt–Co/NaY zeolites were prepared by ion-exchange using NaY zeolite (Strem Chemicals, Lot No. 031112104). The zeolite was first stirred with doubly deionized water (200 ml g−1 zeolite) at 343 K for 1 h. A dilute aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 or Co(NO3)2 (2 × 10−2 mol cm−3) was added drop-wise to the zeolite slurry while stirring at 343 K. After 24 h ion-exchange at the same temperature, the catalyst was filtered and thoroughly washed with deionized water. In the preparation of the Pt–Co/NaY bimetallic catalyst, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 was introduced first, then – after filtering – the Pt/NaY was further exchanged with Co(NO3)2 solution. All catalysts were dried in air: first at room temperature, then at 383 K for 2 h
[27]
.
Pt and Co contents in the catalysts were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The samples were first calcined in flowing oxygen at a 40 cm3 min−1 flow rate, while the temperature was increased from room temperature to the 573 K at 0.5 K min−1 ramp rate. After purging with Ar for 1 h at the calcination temperature, the samples were cooled in argon to room temperature and, using a 10 K min−1 ramp rate, they were reduced in a stream of hydrogen at 30 cm3 min−1.
2.1.2. Ru–Co/NaY samples
The Ru/NaY, Co/NaY and Ru–Co/NaY samples were prepared by ion-exchange of NaY zeolite (Strem Chemicals, Lot No. 031112104). Pre-treatment of the zeolite sample was carried out as mentioned in
Section 2.1.1
. A diluted aqueous solution of Ru(NH3)6Cl3 or Co(NO3)2 (2 × 10−3 mol cm−3) was added drop-wise to the zeolite slurry whilst stirring at 70°C. The pH of the slurry was set to a final value of 6.5. After 24 h ion-exchange at the same temperature, the samples were filtered and thoroughly washed with deionized water. Two types of Ru–Co/NaY bimetallic samples were prepared which differed in the sequence of exchange of the two precursors
[58]
,
[60]
.
According to preliminary experiments and literature data
[58]
,
[63]
,
[64]
,
[65]
calcination of the exchanged samples in oxygen resulted in the formation of RuO2 and its migration to the external surface of the zeolite. The decomposition of the ruthenium complex was, therefore, carried out in He (40 cm3 min−1). Reduction of the samples was carried out in a stream of H2 (40 cm3 min−1) during which the temperature was increased to 450°C; the sample was kept at this temperature for 1 h after which it was cooled down to room temperature.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
2.2.1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron spectra were measured in a KRATOS ES-300 ESCA and KRATOS XSAM 800 machines for Pt–Co/NaY and Ru–Co/NaY samples, respectively. An Al Kα X-ray source (1486.67 eV) was applied for excitation. The hemispherical analyzer worked in the fixed retarding ratio (FRR) mode. During spectra recording the pressure in the analyzing chamber did not exceed 10−6 Pa. The error in determining binding energies is about ±0.1 eV. The powdered samples were meshed into a copper grid which was then mounted on the tip of the sample transfer rod. Because the C 1s line is highly sensitive to different treatments, the Si 2p peak at 102.95 eV binding energy (BE) was taken as an internal reference. The surface atomic ratios (nA/nB) was estimated using the well known equation. The subshells (Na 2s, Al 2s, Si 2p, Pt 4f) utilized were chosen to be close to each other thereby excluding the effects due to the difference in the inelastic mean free paths and the analyzer transmission. Because of the overlapping of the Pt 4f and Al 2p peaks, the Pt 4f intensity was derived from the overall intensities by subtracting that of the Al 2p peak. This latter was calculated from the Al 2s/Al 2p ratio measured on pure alumina using the gold decoration technique. Pt 4f7/2 itself was never used for Pt valence state identification: instead, Pt 4d5/2 was applied. For metallic ruthenium the Ru 3d3/2 peak overlaps with the C 1s band, therefore, either Ru 3p or Ru 3d5/2 was used for calculation. For qualitative analysis the peaks were fitted by peak-synthesis of pseudo-Voigtian type components after an inelastic (Shirley-type) background had been subtracted. Due to the complicated nature of the Co2+ 2p transition here a simplified fitting process was employed

2.2.2. EXAFS measurements
In situ EXAFS and anomalous wide angle X-ray scattering were used to characterize the Pt–Co/NaY and Ru–Co/NaY samples. Experiments were performed at LURE DCI storage ring running at 1.85 GeV. The data were taken (using a double Si(1 1 1) monochromator) at both the Pt LIII-edge and the Co K-edge.
2.3. Catalytic reaction
CO hydrogenation was performed in a stainless steel tubular reactor charged with 0.15 g catalyst between two plugs of quartz wool. The catalyst was post-reduced in a stream of hydrogen at 723 K for 24 h at 4 bar H2 (30 cm3 min−1). The reduced catalyst was cooled in H2 to the reaction temperature. After gradually replacing the H2 with a CO + H2 mixture, the pressure was adjusted to 10 bar. The temperature was controlled with a precision of 2 K. The CO/H2 = 0.5 mixture was purified by passing it through activated carbon, pre-reduced manganese acetate impregnated on a molecular sieve and, finally, through silica gel. The flow rate was 15 cm3 min−1. Effluent gases were sampled by a six-port valve through a heated line and analysis of the product was carried out by a CHROMPACK CP 9001 gas chromatograph using a 50 m long PLOT fused silica column (0.53 mm ID) with a stationary phase of Al2O3/KCl with a temperature programmed mode. Separation of the oxygenates was by an Chromsorb 101 column. CO2 was not measured. The rate was evaluated in μmol s−1 gcat−1 and the product selectivities were based on carbon efficiency and calculated by the equation of Si = iCi/ΣiCi × 100 from i = 1–9.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Platinum–cobalt on NaY zeolite
The primary question is whether platinum and cobalt are located inside the zeolite supercage. TPR and TPD were used for studying the reducibility of the platinum and cobalt ions encapsulated in Pt/NaY, Co/NaY and Pt–Co/NaY zeolites
[27]
,
[28]
. The temperature required to reduce Co2+ in NaY is significantly lowered by the presence of Pt and the extent of reduction depends on the relative locations of Pt and Co ions in the zeolite cages. Their exact location is controlled by the calcination conditions and metal loading. For bimetallic catalysts with a low metal content (0.5 wt.% Pt and 0.9 wt.% Co), the TPR results indicate that reduction of Co2+ ions in the vicinity of Pt shifts toward lower temperatures, whereas that of isolated Co2+ is not affected. However, with a higher Pt loading (4.5 wt.% Pt and 2.6 wt.% Co) most of the Co2+ ions can be reduced in the presence of platinum at temperatures below 720 K. The temperature for reduction of the platinum in the bimetallic samples is somewhat higher than in Pt/NaY and increases with Co atomic fraction, indicating that a mixed oxide (PtCoxOy) is formed during calcination. After hydrogen reduction, the surface composition of the bimetallic particles may be different for the catalysts with similar Pt content but different Co fractions. Accordingly, H/Pt ratios of 1.0 and 0.72 for the catalysts with low and high Co content, respectively, have been shown by hydrogen chemisorption and O2–H2 titration. The relative amounts of adsorbed O2(ads)/H2(ads) increase with increasing Co mole fraction in Pt–Co/NaY catalysts.
Although the ratio of the amounts of chemisorbed CO and H2, CO(ads)/H2(ads), increases with Co fraction, the CO(ads)/O2(ads), remains relatively constant on all Pt–Co samples. The high amounts of hydrogen chemisorbed are indicative of small metal particles located inside the zeolite supercages.
Preliminary studies on the structure using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed a difference between alumina and zeolite-supported Pt–Co metal particles. As shown in
Table 1
, the major advantage of using zeolites as support is that during the calcination procedure both the platinum and cobalt components maintain their valence states shown in the precursor complex

the major results measured by XPS, are summarized.

As XPS is a surface technique, the sampling depth in a solid could be higher in zeolites. The inelastic mean free paths (IMFP) calculated for Co 2p and Pt 4d electrons in bulk SiO2 are 2.2 and 3.3 nm, respectively
[31]
. The sampling (information) depth equals three times the IMFP and the void volume in faujasite is ca. 47%
[32]
. The effective depth of information can be estimated as 14 and 21 nm, respectively, i.e. about 5–10 unit cells of zeolite below the surface (the unit cell constant is 2.5 nm
[33]
).
First it was established that during ion-exchange of the Na+ ions with transition metal ions, a small degree of dealumination occurs and the amorphous aluminum-containing ensembles in NaY zeolite migrate toward the external surface. This results in surface enrichment of the Al ions (not indicated in
Table 2
), some of them are dissolved in the surrounding aqueous solution, and some of them are deposited onto the zeolite surface.
Our binding energy (BE) data for the Na 1s line is in good agreement with those reported in the literature
[34]
. Replacement of Na+ ions by other cations of different electronegativities results in the BE shifts of all constituents
[34]
,
[35]
. However, these shifts are found to be the same and thus, no shift is detected if Si 2p is employed
[36]
,
[37]
,
[38]
,
[39]
as the internal BE reference. In view of this shift of the Na 1s line towards higher BE obtained for the sample prepared by Co2+ ion-exchange, may be due only to the specific electronic properties of the sites where Co2+ ions are anchored inside the zeolite framework. Since it is known that Co2+ ions can be exchanged into the smaller cages of a faujasite matrix
[40]
, the BE shift observed may be characteristic of the NaY zeolite exchanged by higher electronegativity cation in small cages, i.e. it is due to a screening effect.
The (nNa/nAl)surface ratio (where nNa and nAl stand for the mole fractions of Na and Al at the surface) shows that Na+ ions are replaced by metal ions
[30]
. The uncertainties are due to the difference in the homogeneity of the ion-exchange, the effect of alumina is not connected with sodium (deposits) and the differences in the loading of the exchanged transition metal ions. The data reveal that after ion-exchange the distribution of the Pt is not completely homogeneous within the XPS sampling volume, i.e. the samples of low Pt content are ion-exchanged primarily in the outermost surface layers or at more open sites of the zeolite, while at higher concentration ion-exchange takes place in deeper layers or at more hidden sites.
The increase in the (exchange)s/(exchange)b observed after reduction in H2, is most likely attributable to Na+ depletion in the surface region by exchange with the protons formed during reduction of the transition metal ions which would migrate towards the outermost surface. The driving force for this process is not known.
The Pt 4d5/2 binding energies measured in the as prepared states and shown in
Table 2
are uniformly distributed between those of PtO and PtO2
[25]
in agreement with the literature
[36]
,
[39]
. One might assume autoreduction of Pt2+ to form Pt0 that is subsequently oxidized during calcination to form PtOx. First, from the N 1s (BE is 401.7 eV) line with respect to Si 2p, it is clear that after ion-exchange platinum is in the form of [Pt(NH3)4]2+ ions. Earlier TPR studies
[27]
,
[28]
indicated that autoreduction did not occur to any noticeable extent. However, if calcination is conducted at a low temperature ramp rate, Pt2+ ions remain anchored in the supercage, otherwise platinum easily migrates to the external surface of the NaY zeolite and forms large particles which are not indicated by XRD
[28]
.
However, subsequent oxidation of the bimetallic samples results in a shift in the Co 2p peak towards higher BE values. This observation is valid for both (IE) and (IM) samples, indicating that the positive binding energy shift appearing after oxidation can unambiguously be attributed to the simultaneous presence of Co2+ ions. Doubtless the explanation for this is the existence of platinum ions surrounded by cobalt ions, or by the formation of a mixed oxide PtCoOx phase. The latter has already been suggested by TPR measurement
[27]
.
After treatment in H2 for 1 h, the Pt 4d5/2 BE decreases both for the monometallic IE and IM samples to the same extent, and a slightly smaller shift in BE is characteristic of the bimetallic IE sample. Even the lowest BE value is slightly higher than that of a clean Pt foil which suggests the presence of small Pt0 particles
[36]
,
[38]
,
[39]
,
[41]
also on the IM sample. However, the relatively higher BE of the ion-exchanged bimetallic samples may be ascribed to the Co2+ ions remaining as nearest next neighbors to the Pt0 particles within the zeolite framework.
The impregnated zeolite samples are characterized by a Pt/Si ratio which is higher at the surface than in the bulk ((nPt/nSi)s = 0.05; (nPt/nSi)b = 0.03). In relation to the measured Na/Al ratios, it is plausible that at higher Pt loading some of the platinum is located at more hidden cation-exchange positions
[42]
,
[39]
, e.g. in sodalite cages, or in deeper layers (beyond the XPS sampling depth). After oxidation generally a further decrease could be observed indicating migration of Pt2+ ions partly out of supercages
[42]
,
[39]
. Therefore, reduction in H2 for a prolonged time results in the formation of Pt0 particles in the supercages
[42]
,
[39]
,
[43]
and causes only a slight decrease in surface Pt content.
The binding energies of Co 2p3/2 transition reveal a difference between the ion-exchanged and impregnated samples. The former is characterized by a value exceeding 782.0 eV BE which can be attributed to Co2+ ions within the zeolite matrix. Nevertheless, these high BE values (even higher than that of CoSiO4) point to the peculiar electronic properties of zeolites. However, for the impregnated sample a much lower BE of Co2+ ions is observed, especially after reduction – when it corresponds to the presence of bulk CoO
[43]
.
The BE data characterizing the reduced cobalt component indicate that in the impregnated as well as in the ion-exchanged bimetallic samples a pure Co0 phase is present
[19]
. However, a nearly 1 eV higher BE is measured for the ion-exchanged bimetallic sample. Since a similar positive BE shift was established for the Co 2p3/2 line in CoPt3 intermetallics
[44]
, it is reasonable to assume that the BE shift observed is an indication of the formation of Pt–Co bimetallic particles in the reduced bimetallic samples.
In the as prepared IE samples the Co 2p/Si 2p intensity ratio shows that the Pt2+ ions exchanged before Co2+ hamper migration and/or exchange of Co2+ ions to deeper layers. It suggests the formation of ‘cluster-shaped’ or ‘cherry’-type particles
[39]
,
[40]
. Subsequent oxidation of the bimetallic samples results in a strong decrease of surface Co2+ content indicating migration of these ions into the sodalite cages or hexagonal prisms of the deeper zeolite layers
[27]
,
[28]
,
[40]
. The general decrease in surface Co2+ content can unambiguously be attributed to the formation of metallic particles containing cobalt in a zero oxidation state either within or on the zeolite support.
The estimated extent of reduction of the Co2+ phase clearly provides evidence for the assistance of Pt0 in the reduction of Co2+ ions. It assumes the proximity of Co2+ ions to Pt0 particles in the supercages; this proximity is indispensable for such an effect
[40]
. With increased reduction time the extent of Co2+ ion reduction also increases but it reaches the same value for both monometallic and bimetallic materials, which indicates the impossibility of complete reduction of Co2+ in zeolites and simultaneously confirms the absence of long-range H-spillover
[40]
.
Comparison of IE and IM samples reveals that transition metal ions are really exchanged into the zeolite. The BE shift of the Co 2p3/2 line provides evidence for the formation of bimetallic particles within the zeolite support. Pt2+ ions having been exchanged before Co2+ ions retard the migration of the latter into deeper zeolite layers. Pt0 particles are unambiguously proven to assist the reduction of Co2+ ions in NaY zeolite cavities.
The formation of Pt–Co bimetallic particles is further supported by CO chemisorption measured by FTIR
[45]
. The spectra of the CO molecules adsorbed on Pt/NaY and Pt–Co/NaY bimetallic catalysts prepared by IE and IM were measured at different temperatures. The absorption frequencies of the linearly bound CO molecules shift to lower wave numbers in the sequence of Pt/NaY(IE) > Pt–Co/NaY(IE) > Pt/NaY(IM). This red shift is attributed to the interaction between Pt and Co and to the influence of the particle size and location of metals, e.g. inside the cages or on the external surface of the zeolite. Upon heating the samples in CO gas the absorption bands for the linearly bound CO on Pt/NaY(IE), Pt–Co/NaY(IE) and Pt/NaY(IM) shift to lower wave numbers due to re-dispersion of the adsorbed CO layer, which diminishes the dipole–dipole interaction between the adsorbed CO molecules. Upon adsorption and heating the Pt–Co/NaY (IM) in CO a new band for linear CO appears because of the formation of the Co subcarbonyl species.
EXAFS and anomalous wide angle X-ray scattering were performed on the Pt–Co/NaY samples
[46]
. In the as prepared state the simulation procedure showed that Pt atoms are surrounded by 4.4 light atoms at 0.201 nm which means that the Pt environment remained basically unchanged during impregnation. As shown in
Fig. 1
after the reduction step the first coordination sphere is made up of 6.5 Pt atoms at 0.272 nm, thus the average diameter of the metallic particle seems to be around 1.5 nm.

Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and desorption (TPD) have been utilized to study the stability of the Pt–Co bimetallic particles entrapped in NaY zeolite cages upon O2 oxidation and reaction with surface protons generated during the reduction of transition metal cations
[47]
. Oxidation of Pt/NaY catalyst with O2 at 573 K causes a shift of the TPR peak to a lower temperature due to the formation of partially oxidized Pt particles. A similar treatment for Pt–Co/NaY bimetallic catalysts results in complete isolation of Pt and Co in Pt–Co particles, leaving Pt and Co in supercages and sodalite cages, respectively.
Under an inert atmosphere cobalt can be leached out from Pt–Co bimetallic particles at higher temperature by reacting with surface protons. The results provide further evidence that Co2+ ions are driven into small cages after oxidation whereas Pt particles remain in the supercages. Although oxidation of metallic cobalt particles at temperatures lower than 723 K could not be excluded, the hydrogen evolution peak in the temperature range of 470–770 K may be considered as desorption of the H2 activated on Co0 in the Pt–Co bimetallic particles. The results are consistent with the previous suggestion that interaction of Pt and Co precursors in the calcined Pt–Co/NaY catalyst is essential for Pt catalyzed Co reduction and bimetallic particle formation.To summarize the structural architecture of platinum–cobalt bimetallic particles entrapped into NaY zeolite, we have established that:
1.
bimetallic particles are formed in the supercages – a finding is supported by XRD, XPS, EXAFS and FTIR measurements. Not only do noble metals facilitate reduction of the Co2+ ions, but they also create bimetallic particles in the supercages;
2.
in contrast to alumina-supported bimetallic particles, formation of the surface CoO phase can be minimalized in zeolites;
3.
cobalt–platinum bimetallic particles can be decomposed by mild treatment in oxygen. In this process Pt remains in the supercages and Co2+ ions migrate into the sodalite cages.
The best way to check the predicted behavior in the bimetallic system is to measure the catalytic activity and selectivity in CO hydrogenation. This is characteristic of the surface properties
[48]
and of the structure and reactivity of the Pt–Co/NaY bimetallic catalysts prepared by the ion-exchange and impregnation methods. Formation of smaller than 2.5 nm size Pt–Co bimetallic particles is preferred for IE samples as a result of the size of the NaY zeolite supercages, while larger particles (about 20 nm) are present on the external surface of the zeolite or in the IM samples. The differences between the rates and selectivities measured for IE and IM catalysts in CO hydrogenation are shown in
Table 3
. The major difference lies in oxygenate formation and olefin production. When the particle size is small as in the case of IE samples, methanol formation is high, whereas when the particles are large and located outside the zeolite they behave essentially as a platinum promoted cobalt catalyst. In other words, the difference is mainly due to the different particle sizes and their location, but it is also due to the surface morphology of the catalysts determined by the metal–zeolite internal wall interaction. Oxidative treatment on the reduced bimetallic catalysts leads to the decomposition of Pt–Co particles which is modeled by comparing the Pt/NaY IE and IM samples. Whereas in the former case the particle size effect is still valid, in the latter sample the selectivity points to the presence of non-promoted platinum particles of large size, which was really proven by structural investigation. The changes in the surface structure and morphology induced by different treatments exert an additional effect on the activity and selectivity in the CO hydrogenation

Consequently, methanol formation is completely suppressed on IM zeolites because of the presence of large (20 nm) Pt-modified Co particles at the external surface.
The above results are in full agreement with those measured in the Pd–Fe/NaX system
[50]
,
[51]
. The optimum oxygenate formation is a function of iron concentration. Oxygenate formation is due to the presence of bimetallic particles in which there is a rehybridization of the palladium d-orbitals resulting in the presence of partially electron deficient palladium particles fully proved by Mössbauer spectroscopy (the isomer shift of iron becomes 0.17 mm s−1
[52]
). The maximum amount of oxygenate, containing higher alcohols is produced at about 0.1 at.% iron using a pressure of 40 bar.
3.2. Ruthenium–cobalt on NaY zeolite
Cobalt and ruthenium are considered the best catalysts for CO hydrogenation
[53]
,
[54]
,
[55]
,
[56]
,
[57]
. Their catalytic activity and selectivity largely depend on their morphology e.g. particle size, combination of the two metals, support, pretreatment conditions. Earlier works on TiO2 and SiO2 supported cobalt catalysts promoted by small amounts of ruthenium showed a large increase in the formation of C5+ selectivity and in the turnover frequency (TOF)
[54]
,
[56]
. This is in contrast to what was observed on Pt–Co/NaY samples on which the prevailing process was methanol formation, and thus the performance depends on the particle size and the composition of the bimetallic samples. Here we consider CO hydrogenation over zeolite supported Ru–Co systems and attempt to understand the effect of size and location of the metal particles in the NaY zeolite.
Small cobalt oxide particles cannot easily be reduced
[58]
,
[59]
: the smaller the size of the precursor cobalt oxide particles, the lesser is the extent to which they can be reduced
[60]
,
[61]
,
[62]
. As stated in
Section 3.1
, it was established that cobalt particles can be kept well below a certain size if cobalt is inserted into zeolite supercage of NaY, but its reduction is limited to large extent
[27]
,
[28]
.
XPS studies showed that the reducibility of cobalt ions in the Ru–Co/NaY samples depends entirely on the sequence of ion-exchange. When the samples are ion-exchanged in the sequence Co2+–Ru3+, cobalt ion cannot be reduced, because the ruthenium ions are separated from the cobalt ions via migration to the external surface. If ion-exchange takes place in the reverse order, the cobalt ions can be reversibly reduced/oxidized because of the location of the Co2+ ions at the outer sphere of zeolite
[60]
,
[67]
. In
Table 4
these data are presented. The experimental data unambiguously indicate the formation of cobalt and ruthenium metal particles, but it is questionable whether the metal particles are located in the supercage side by side or whether they are in the form of bimetallic particles. This is not the case for Pt–Co/NaY samples for which we have already found evidence that, if the two metals viz. cobalt and platinum particles are topographically separated, i.e. platinum remains in the supercage and cobalt ions migrate into the hexagonal prism or sodalite cage, the hydrogen activated on platinum particles, cannot be spilled over to reduce cobalt ions

On the other hand, the statement above on the reversible oxidation/reduction is valid in the Ru–Co/NaY sample only if (i) ruthenium is exchanged first, (ii) the as received sample is treated in helium before reduction to decompose the ammonia ligands in [Ru(NH3)6](NO3)3 species. However, any other treatments in O2/H2, and He/H2/O2/H2 change the structure of the Ru–Co/NaY samples. For instance, for the Ru/NaY sample the treatment in O2/H2 results in the formation of ruthenium particles of around 200 nm diameter, whereas after He/H2 treatment nanoparticles of 2–3 nm are formed. This is in agreement with other observations indicating small ruthenium particle formation on treatment in an inert atmosphere
[63]
,
[64]
,
[65]
. We found direct evidence for the existence of small particles in both the Pt–Co/NaY and Ru–Co/NaY systems. Sachtler suggested the existence of a metal–proton adduct formed in palladium/NaY samples
[66]
. This led us to measure the Brønsted and Lewis acidity by FTIR and make a correlation between Brønsted acidity and n-butene isomerization
[67]
. Indeed, when the as prepared sample was decomposed in helium followed by reduction, small particles were formed in the supercage and the protons in the metal–proton adduct showed Brønsted acid sites, consequently the isomerization of n-butene was catalyzed. When the sample was subsequently oxidized/reduced, ‘raft-like’ ruthenium particles were created at the external surface of NaY zeolite, thus Brønsted acidity was no longer present and no isomerization occurred.
A possible mechanism has been suggested for the migration of ruthenium during pretreatment
[60]
,
[68]
. In the case of direct oxidation of the [Ru(NH3)6]3+ ions, RuO2 is easily formed and it migrates through the pores of the zeolite to the external surface where it quickly crystallizes. In the case of He/H2/O2 treatment the migration is kinetically controlled by the surface reaction between the already reduced metallic ruthenium particles and oxygen. On the other hand, on the Ru–Co/NaY samples the metal particles are stabilized by the Co2+ ions inside the supercage therefore freedom for migration is rather limited.
It is still an open question whether the nanoscale bimetallic particles located in the supercage of NaY zeolite are real alloys as in the Pt–Co system, where we could identify alloy formation by the XPS binding energy shift of Co0 by 0.5 eV towards higher energies, or as the data shown in
Table 4
indicated a mixture of two monometallic clusters.

. In
Fig. 4
the modulus of the Fourier transform associated with the cobalt metallic foil (solid line) and the Ru–Co/NaY bimetallic catalyst after reduction (dotted line) are compared. The fitting procedure shows that the number of cobalt atoms at the first coordination sphere is N(Co–Co) = 3.5, R(Co–Co) = 0.2509 nm and the Debye–Waller factor is 0.02. This figure clearly shows the presence of Co–Co metal bonds. The drastic diminution in the coordination number is due to the fact that in zeolite the cobalt atoms are in the form of metal nanocluster. For ruthenium the total coordination number is less than that for cobalt after reduction indicating that ruthenium decorates the cobalt surface. Note that a higher coordination sphere is visible on the modulus of the Fourier transform and also that no re-oxidation process of the cobalt atoms is observed after replacing hydrogen by air. It means that the size of the cluster is more important, as our estimation of the coordination number being done through classical analysis

In order to estimate the influence of the cluster size and the presence of Ru–Co bonds inside the zeolite, ab initio simulation was performed on part of the absorption spectrum at the Co K-edge and the Ru K-edge measured by XANES and EXAFS. The key point of the study is the fact that through in situ XAS measurements performed at the Co K-edge and the Ru K-edge metallic cobalt as well as metallic ruthenium particles were generated. This is in line with the XPS and catalytic measurements. A detailed EXAFS and XANES analysis is in progress in order to improve the separation of the two metals inside the material.
CO hydrogenation was studied on Ru/NaY and Ru–Co/NaY catalysts
[73]
. The fraction of olefins (Cn=/(Cn−+Cn=)) is characteristic of the capability of the catalyst to hydrogenate the olefins that form. Generally speaking, the longer the residence time of the olefin chains inside the zeolite channels, the more paraffins are formed. On the samples in which the ruthenium particles of around 200 nm are located at the external surface of the NaY zeolite (direct O2/H2 treatment), the C3 fraction contains a significantly higher amount of olefin than that measured on the other samples. The possible explanation is the easy desorption of the propylene formed over the large ruthenium particles located at the external surface before hydrogenation. On the other hand, when the particles are located inside the supercage there is a high probability of olefins being hydrogenated before leaving the zeolite channel. The corresponding figures are the (Cn=/(Cn−+Cn=)) ratio for Ru/NaY and Ru–Co/NaY samples with the same treatment (O2/H2) is 0.73 and 0.49, respectively. This is because on Ru/NaY the large ruthenium particles are outside the zeolite whereas in Ru–Co/NaY they are stabilized inside the zeolite. The C2+ selectivities for Ru/NaY (O2/H2) and (He/H2) are 52 % and 61%, respectively, following the same line of reasoning.
The stability of the samples during CO hydrogenation was studied at 509 K during hundreds h-on-stream reaction time
[73]
. As shown in
Fig. 5
the activity of the Ru/NaY sample steadily decreases from a high value, whereas the rate of CO hydrogenation on a Ru–Co/NaY sample (after a short initial period) shows a steady activity. This means that Ru–Co bimetallic particles are stabilized inside the zeolite supercage and the surface structure, characterized by a cobalt kernel and ruthenium at the outermost layer, does not change significantly. The bimetallic particles are stabilized by the trace amount of cobalt ions always present. The advantage of metal/zeolite samples is two-fold: primarily the activity in CO hydrogenation is stable in contrast to the SiO2 supported Ru–Co catalysts prepared from carbonyl clusters
[74]
,
[75]
; second, the formation of the higher than C7 hydrocarbon fraction is diminished because hydrogenolysis affects the chain length.

4. Conclusions
Properly chosen zeolite and the methods of preparation in transition metal–zeolite systems appear to be superior to the transition metals supported on inorganic oxides in terms of:
•
formation of stable, small and monodisperse metal- or bimetallic particles,
•
the factors controlling the stability of the Pt–Co and Ru–Co bimetallic particles depend on the pre-treatment and on the conditions once the bimetallic particles have been formed,
•
combination with pore size selective behavior of the zeolite support.
