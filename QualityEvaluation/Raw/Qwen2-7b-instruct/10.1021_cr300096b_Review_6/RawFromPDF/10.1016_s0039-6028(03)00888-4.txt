Abstract
The diﬀerent adsorption possibilities of thiophene (C4H4S) on the Ni(1 1 0) surface have been studied using ﬁrst
principle local-density-functional calculations, with the Vienna ab initio simulation package, which is based on a plane
wave basis set and projector augmented wave potentials. For each conﬁguration, a geometric optimisation has been
performed. A detailed analysis of the structural and electronic properties of the molecule and the surface in the most
stable conformations is presented, showing the combined roles of the molecular distortion and the interactions between
the molecule and the surface. Three structures with comparatively large adsorption energies are identiﬁed, all with the
molecule plane parallel to the surface.
Starting from these stabilised structures, various scenarios for the desulfurisation process have been envisaged.
While, for the most stable structure, the formation of an adsorbed thiol is an activated process, with an energetic barrier
of 0.70 eV, the two structures which are just a bit less stable can dissociate to a C4H4 species and a sulfur atom with
barriers as low as 0.07 eV. A description of the diﬀerent transition states and a kinetic analysis of the desulfurisation
reaction is also presented.

1. Introduction
The interaction of thiophene with metallic sur-
faces is of considerable practical as well as funda-
mental interest. In industrial hydrodesulfurisation
(HDS) processes [1,2], thiophene is found to be
particularly diﬃcult to desulfurise. Although most
industrially used HDS catalysts are based on sul-
ﬁded Mo supported on alumina (often promoted
with Co or Ni), the adsorption and reaction of
thiophene on transition-metal surfaces have been
used as models for understanding the catalytic
mechanism and for testing the reactivity of aromatic
compounds. A further very interesting prospect
is that thiophene, like other heterocyclic mole-
cules, is a building block for conducting polymers
[3]. Uniform polymer ﬁlms can be produced

electrochemically on noble transition-metal sur-
faces (gold or platinum) with unique electrical
properties and stability.
The surface chemistry of thiophene has been
investigated on several transition metal surfaces.
The earliest studies for the Pt(1 1 1) surface [4]
suggested that thiophene decomposes below room
temperature to form a metallocycle intermediate.
Formation of a metallocycle with C4H3 stoichio-
metry was also proposed for the adsorption of
thiophene on a Ni(1 0 0) surface [5]. The C4H3
metallocycle was found to be stable up to about
500 K where it decomposes via a C4H2 interme-
diate. A similar metallocycle was also proposed for
thiophene on the Ru(0 0 0 1) surface [6]. On the
Rh(1 1 1) surface, elimination of sulfur begins at
150 K, followed by a complex reaction sequence
involving
hydrogenation
and
dehydrogenation
of hydrocarbon residues [7]. Thermal desorption
spectra (TDS) and angular-resolved ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy (ARUPS) are consis-
tent with a C4 hydrocarbon fragment, part of
which is desorbed as butadiene. Studies of thio-
phene adsorption on the Pt(1 1 1), Pt(1 0 0), and
Pt(2 1 1) surfaces [8] demonstrated that the elimi-
nation of sulfur begins at 350 K. The reaction ki-
netics were found to be quite independent on the
surface orientation and it was concluded that the
reaction intermediate was not a true metallocycle.
On the Ni(1 1 1) [9], W(2 1 1) [10], and Mo(1 1 0)
[11] surfaces, dehydrogenation of thiophene at
the a-positions, resulting in the formation of a
carbon-bonded surface species was reported. On
the basis of the observation of C5 species among
the desorption products, surface-polymerisation
was suggested to occur on the Ni(1 1 1) surface. In
contrast, very recent studies of low-temperature
HDS of thiophene on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic sur-
faces showed a pronounced selectivity to produce
C4 hydrocarbon molecules [12]: a Pt(1 1 1) surface
covered by a monolayer of Ni and a Ni(1 1 1)
surface produced butene, while the bimetallic Ni/
Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 1) surfaces produced butadiene.
Thiophene dehydrogenation in an a; b; b; a se-
quence was reported for the Mo(1 0 0) surface [13].
Selective dehydrogenation in an a; a; b; b sequence
was reported for thiophene on Fe(1 0 0) [14], fol-
lowed by surface polymerisation through an a–a
coupling. The atomistic model for dehydrogenation
and surface-polymerisation is based on an adsorp-
tion geometry in which the aromatic cycle is ori-
ented perpendicular to the surface, coupled through
the sulfur atom. On the other hand near-edge ex-
tended X-ray adsorption ﬁne-structure (NEXAFS)
investigations of thiophene adsorbed on Ni(1 0 0)
and Cu(1 0 0) surfaces [15,16] led to the conclusion
that thiophene adsorbs with the molecular plane
parallel to the surface and that the S atom binds to a
bridge site on both surfaces. TDS and ARUPS in-
vestigations of thiophene on Al(1 1 1) also suggest a
planar adsorption geometry, albeit with a much
weaker adsorbate–substrate interaction as on the
transition-metal surfaces [17]. Moreover, XPS and
high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy
(HREELS) studies of the adsorption of thiophene
on Ni(1 1 1) showed a cleavage of the C–S bond at
150 K [18], while NEXAFS and HREELS experi-
ments about the thiophene adsorption on Ni(1 0 0)
also showed a scission of the C–S bond at temper-
atures below 90 K [5]. In the case of the adsorption
of thiophene on Ni(1 1 0), to our knowledge, no
experimental results have been published. How-
ever, from the study of thiophene on Ni(1 1 1) [18]
and Ni(1 0 0) [5] and of bithiophene on Ni(1 1 0)
[19], it can be anticipated that the molecule would
decompose at high rate, even at low temperature.
Hence no clear picture of the adsorption of thio-
phene on metal surfaces has emerged from the ex-
perimental investigations. This contrasts with our
knowledge of the adsorption of other aromatic
molecules on metallic surfaces. For benzene on all
three low-index surfaces of Ni for example TPD,
ARUPS, NEXAFS, low-energy-electron diﬀraction,
and HREELS all agree on a planar or nearly planar
adsorption geometry and a dominant adsorbate–
substrate interaction through the p-orbitals of the
aromatic ring [20,21]. For benzene on Ni, a com-
prehensive density-functional theory (DFT) study
[22] has further consolidated the picture developed
on the basis of the experimental investigations.
Benzene molecule on Pd(11 1) and Pt(1 1 1) also are
predicted to adsorb in a planar geometry [23].
Theoretical studies of thiophene adsorption on
metallic surfaces are still very scarce, since due to
the size of the molecule, such studies are compu-
tationally rather demanding. Mittendorfer and
C. Morin et al. / Surface Science 540 (2003) 474–490
475
Hafner [24] have studied the adsorption of thio-
phene on Ni(1 0 0) surfaces. Two stable adsorption
geometries have been identiﬁed: the highest ad-
sorption energy (Eads ¼ 2:57 eV) is found for a
conﬁguration where one of the C–S bonds has
already been broken and where all four C atoms
form strong bonds with Ni atoms in the surface. In
this conﬁguration all C–H bonds are strongly til-
ted with respect to the surface plane, indicating a
substantial activation for dehydrogenation. In the
second conﬁguration which is less stable only by
0.3 eV, the thiophene molecule remains intact, al-
though both C–S bonds are stretched to 1.81 
A
(compared to 1.72 
A in the gas phase). Both ad-
sorption geometries are in reasonable agreement
with the NEXAFS data [15,16], and the small
energy diﬀerence agrees with the experimental
observation of both molecular and dissociative
adsorption [4,5]. The DFT studies have been ex-
tended to the investigation of desulfurisation
processes [25]. Direct desulfurisation is found to be
an activated exothermic process, with a reaction
barrier of 0.71 eV and an energy gain of 0.62 eV
for the coadsorbed S atom and C4H4 fragment,
compared to the adsorbed linear SC4H4 species.
Hydrogenolysis of the adsorbed molecule is found
to lower the barrier for the C–S bond cleavage to
0.14 eV, but the initial steps of the formation of 2-
monohydro- and 2,5-dihydrothiophene have acti-
vation energies of 0.98 and 0.58 eV, respectively,
even higher than for direct desulfurisation.
The present work is devoted to the investigation
of the adsorption and desulfurisation of thiophene
on Ni(1 1 0). Ni plays an important role as a
dearomatization catalyst and as a promotor of
sulﬁde-based MoS2 and WS2 catalyst. Our interest
in the relatively open (1 1 0) surface is motivated by
two facts: (i) the lower symmetry of the surface
allows for the formation of a larger variety of
adsorbate geometries, (ii) there have been extended
studies of the adsorption of bi- and polythiophenes
on clean and sulﬁded Ni(1 1 0) surfaces [26–29].
2. Method
The calculations have been performed using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)
[30,31]. This code solves the Kohn–Sham equa-
tions of DFT using a plane wave basis set. The
projector augmented wave method [32,33] has
been used to describe the electron–ion interaction.
It is a frozen core method which uses the exact
valence-wave functions instead of pseudo-wave
functions. Exchange and correlation eﬀects are
treated in the generalised gradient approximation
(GGA), in the formulation of Perdew-Wang-91
[34]. For the plane wave set, a cutoﬀenergy of 400
eV has been used.
Brillouin-zone
integrations
have
been
per-
formed using a 3 · 3 · 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid [35]
and a Methfessel–Paxton smearing [36] of 0.1 eV.
The calculations were performed for a non-mag-
netic nickel substrate as the magnetisation did not
show a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the calculated
barriers for hydrogenation reactions [25]. This re-
sult has been conﬁrmed explicitly for thiophene on
Ni(1 1 0) (see Section 5).
The supercell was chosen corresponding to a
p(2 · 3), c(2 · 6) or (
ﬃﬃﬃ
5
p
 3)R26.6 superstructure of
the adsorbed thiophene molecules, corresponding
to a coverage of 1/6th of a monolayer, depending
on the molecule orientation, in order to avoid
interaction between nearest molecules (in those
cases, the distance between two thiophene mole-
cule is at least of 7 
A, while the largest dimension
of the molecule is 4.6 
A). The surface has been
modelled by a periodically repeated slab consisting
of four layers of nickel with the two uppermost
layers allowed to relax. Tests have been done with
a slab of six layers of nickel, with the two upper-
most layers allowed to relax. The results are given
in the following section.
In order to construct the Ni slab, the optimised
bulk Ni–Ni distance has been used (2.50 
A). This
value compares very well with the experimental
result (2.49 
A).
The transition states (TS) of the reaction were
determined using the nudged-elastic-band method
[37], which is based on an explicit mapping of the
reaction path. A chain of structures is constructed
between the initial reactants and the ﬁnal reaction
products. These images are simultaneously opti-
mised with additional elastic forces in order to
obtain the reaction path. The transition states were
veriﬁed by the calculation of the vibrational

frequencies within a harmonic approach, using ﬁ-
nite diﬀerences of the Hellman–Feyman forces to
construct the dynamical matrix.
The kinetic constants have been calculated with
the conventional transition-state theory [38,39],
the partition functions for reactants and transition
states being calculated using the harmonic ap-
proximation. For the reaction

3. Adsorption structures and adsorption energies
The ﬁrst interest of the study has been the de-
termination of the most favourable adsorption site
for the thiophene molecule on the Ni(1 1 0) sur-
face, in order to determine which structure(s) must
be taken into account in modelling studies of
desulfurisation. This has been achieved by a
comparison of the adsorption energies of diﬀerent
adsorption positions. Fig. 1 shows the most stable
structures found, including the supercell vectors,
and illustrates the notation used. The notation
gives the geometric position of the molecule (up-
right, tilted or ﬂat lying), and an arbitrary number
to classify them. In order to ﬁnd stable structures,
more than 15 ﬂat and upright conﬁguration pos-
sibilities have been proposed with various initial
bonding modes to the surface and have been
subject to a geometric optimisation, with a full
relaxation according to the forces acting on them,
using a conjugate gradient method. Fig. 1 sum-
marises the most interesting optimised ones; the
other ones were either unstable or poorly stable, or
relaxed towards one of these structures.
The gas phase thiophene molecule has been
optimised in a large cell of 12 · 12 · 12 
A3 with the
same geometric optimisation method, and the
geometric results (see Table 2) are close to those
previously calculated and to experimental values
(see [41] and references therein).
Two diﬀerent slab thicknesses have been tested,
with four and six layers of nickel. In both cases,
the slabs are separated by a vacuum of 14 
A. The
adsorption energies (see Table 1) in the case of the
six-layer slab are lowered by DEads  0:08–0:18 eV,
compared to the case of four layers, but the dif-
ferences between the adsorption energies of the
diﬀerent structures are almost the same (the most
important variation in the diﬀerences is less than
25 meV for the most stable structures). Moreover,
the geometries of the structures are almost the
same in both cases (the most important variation is
of 0.01 
A). A slab of four layers of nickel is enough
for comparing the adsorption energies of the dif-
ferent structures, and their geometries. It will also
be suﬃcient to study dissociation processes such as
the desulfurisation of the molecule. Hence, we
choose in all further calculations a slab of four
layers of nickel.
The clean Ni(1 1 0) surface shows close-packed
rows of nickel atoms oriented along the [0 0 1] di-
rection, separated by 3.53 
A, and the molecule can
C. Morin et al. / Surface Science 540 (2003) 474–490
477
adsorb in diﬀerent positions relative to these rows.
A ﬁrst adsorption geometry is the upright one (Fig.
1a), with the plane of the molecule parallel to the
[0 0 1] direction of the surface, binding to it
through the sulfur atom placed in a bridge position
between two Ni atoms of diﬀerent rows. In this
conﬁguration, the sulfur atom is in a pseudo-
fourfold coordination. In a second possible con-
ﬁguration, the molecule is tilted, by an angle of
40 with respect to the surface plane (Fig. 1b).
The sulfur atom and one of the neighbouring
carbon atoms lie in the groove between two nickel
rows. As previously, the sulfur atom is close to two
nickel atoms and one of the carbon atoms also
binds to two nickel atoms. For all the other stable
structures, the molecule lies parallel to the surface,
on a row of nickel for the ﬂat.1 structure (Fig. 1c)
or between two rows for the other ones (Fig. 1d–
g).
Table 1 lists the adsorption energies computed
for the diﬀerent structures. It shows also the dis-
tortion energies of the molecule in each case, which
is the diﬀerence between the total energy of the
isolated molecule in the distorted adsorption ge-
ometry, and that of the molecule in the equilib-
rium gas-phase geometry.
The ﬂat adsorption structures are found to be
more stable than the upright and tilted ones. The
most stable one is the ﬂat.4 structure (Eads ¼ 2:42
eV) followed by the ﬂat.2 (2.08 eV), ﬂat.3 (1.95 eV)
and ﬂat.5 (1.51 eV) structures. The upright, tilted
and the ﬂat.1 structures have much lower ad-
sorption energies.
The distortion energy, as already shown in the
case of benzene adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) [23], is an
important criterion to determine the stable ad-
sorption geometry and a direct measure for the
loss of aromaticity. In our case, in the ﬂat.2
structure the molecule is the most distorted, fol-
lowed by the ﬂat.3, ﬂat.4, ﬂat.5 and tilted ones,
whereas the upright and ﬂat.1 structures remain
undistorted.
Table 2 summarises the geometric characteris-
tics (bond lengths, angle between carbon–hydro-
gen bonds and the plane of the carbon atoms) of
each adsorption structure and of the gas phase
molecule. As we could expect, the two structures
with lowest distortion energies, (upright and ﬂat.1)
have almost the same molecular inter-atomic dis-
tances as in the gas phase. We can also notice that
these molecules remain almost ﬂat after adsorp-

tion. In the other cases, we ﬁnd that the higher the
distortion energy, the longer the carbon–carbon
and the sulfur–carbon distances. For the most
distorted structures, ﬂat.2 and ﬂat.3, the bonds are
elongated by up to 10% compared to the gas
phase, and the angles between the CH bonds and
the CCC or CCS planes have an average value of
more than 35.
Moreover the diﬀerent structures can be dis-
tinguished by the number of short C–Ni and S–Ni
bonds, and their length. The most stable structures
are all characterised by a large number of short

C–Ni bonds. Hence, ﬂat.4, the most stable one,
admits four short C–Ni bonds with an average
length of 2.01 
A, and one short S–Ni bond of 2.13

A. On the other hand, the geometry ﬂat.2 admits
the same number of C–Ni bonds and ﬂat.3 shows
even two C–Ni bonds of 1.98 
A and two bonds of
1.99 
A, but these last two structures have relatively
long S–Ni bonds of 2.28 
A. In consequence the
ﬂat.4 structure, with a lower distortion energy and
a stronger interaction between S and the substrate
atoms, becomes the most stable one, whereas the
others two with higher distortion energies and
similar short bonds between molecule and surface,
are about 400 meV less stable.
In contrast the upright and ﬂat.1 structures have
no short C–Ni bond, and even if both have one
relatively short S–Ni bond of 2.15 and 2.18 
A,
respectively, the bonding interaction between these
atoms is not suﬃcient to produce a substantial
adsorption energy. These two structures, despite
their low-distortion energy, have only a weak
bonding interaction between the atoms of the
molecule and those of the surface. Hence these
structures are poorly stable compared to the pre-
vious ones.
Between these two extreme situations, the tilted
and ﬂat.5 structures both show two short C–Ni
bonds of 2.02/2.04 and 2.06 
A, respectively, and
relatively short S–Ni bonds of 2.19 and 2.13 
A,
respectively. In this case, we would expect that as
the tilted structure undergoes less distortion and
has similar interaction between molecule and sur-
face than the ﬂat.5 geometry, it may become more
stable than this latter structure. In fact, however,
its adsorption energy is only about half of that of
the ﬂat.5 conﬁguration. This surprising point will
be discussed in the following section.
Hence, three diﬀerent structures (ﬂat.2, ﬂat.3
and ﬂat.4) must be kept as possible geometries
for the molecular adsorption of thiophene on
Ni(1 1 0). We can compare these adsorption con-
ﬁgurations to those found by a DFT calculation
for the adsorption of thiophene on Ni(1 0 0) [24].
In this last case, two diﬀerent adsorption struc-
tures are found: one for an intact molecule and one
in which one sulfur–carbon bond is broken, lead-
ing to the formation of an adsorbed thiol. The
adsorption energies are Eads ¼ 2:23 and 2.57 eV,
respectively. In the ﬁrst case, named hollow B, the
adsorbed molecule is centred above one of the
fourfold hollows and shows a sulfur atom in top
position, with a S–Ni bond of 2.14 
A, two C–Ni
bonds of 1.98 
A and two other of 2.09 
A. In the
case of the broken aromatic ring, the conﬁguration
named bridge B shows a sulfur atom in a bridge
position, with two S–Ni bonds of 2.13 and 2.17 
A,
and ﬁve short C–Ni bonds between 1.87 and 2.09

A. These geometric characteristics are close to
those found in our study, which underlines the
similarity between the two nickel surfaces.
Even if no experimental adsorption structure is
available, the study of adsorption of bithiophene
molecules on clean and sulfured Ni(1 1 0) surfaces
shows an adsorption with the aromatic ring par-
allel to the surface, a large interaction between the
molecule and the metal surface, and an important
role played by the sulfur atom for the adsorption
[26–29]. This is in good agreement with our results
for the adsorption of thiophene and the role of the
sulfur atom.

An analysis of the diﬀerential charge densities
has been performed for the three most stable
structures found. The diﬀerential charge density is
deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the charge dis-
tributions of the adsorbate–substrate complex and
those of a clean surface and an isolated molecule,
both distorted to ﬁt the geometry in the adsorption
complex. Hence, the diﬀerential charge densities
just reﬂect the interactions between the surface and
the molecule, and not the electronic changes in-
duced by the distortion of either the molecule or
the slab.
Fig. 2 shows the isosurfaces of the diﬀerential
charge density for the ﬂat.2, ﬂat.3 and ﬂat.4
structures. In each case, one ﬁnds that the charge
density increases due to the formation of new
bonds between the carbon and sulfur atoms of the
molecule and the nickel atoms of the surface. On
the other hand, we can see that there is a decrease
of the charge in the d3z2r2-like states of the nickel

atoms forming bonds with either carbon or sulfur
atoms, as it has been already noticed in the case of
benzene adsorbed on any of the low-index nickel
surfaces [22], or thiophene on Ni(1 0 0) [24]. At the
same time, we notice a strong decrease of charge in
the horizontal non-bonding lone-pair orbital of
the sulfur atoms, which is not signiﬁcantly in-
volved in the interaction with the surfaces.
Moreover, in addition to the formation of
bond-charges between the adsorbate and the sub-
strate atoms, charge is transferred into the t2g-like
states of the nickel atoms, and to the region above
the sulfur atoms, outside the ring.
These considerations contribute to an under-
standing of the bonding of the molecule. The
charge redistribution characterises the electron
donation from the non-bonding sulfur lone-pair to
the adsorbate–substrate bond charges and to the
t2g-like states of the nickel atoms, and the back-
donation from the substrate to the molecule, from
the d3z2r2-like states of the nickel atoms to the p-
system of the molecule, formed by the pz-like
orbitals of the carbon and sulfur atoms.
The donation can be estimated by considering
the mixing of the lone-pair orbital of the sulfur
atom (Slp) and those of the nickel atoms. This has
been done for each structure, and the results are
given in Table 3 in terms of the energy of the Slp
orbital (the 9a1 molecular orbital for a gas-phase
thiophene) and of the ratio between the density
of states (DOS) projected on nickel and sulfur
atom at these energies (see also Fig. 3). This ratio

rations, shown with respect to the deformed geometries.

characterises the strength of the orbital mixing
between the Slp and the surface atom orbitals. The
ﬁrst thing to notice is that the shift of the Slp to
larger binding energies is most important for the
upright adsorption structure, because in this ge-
ometry, the Slp is oriented perpendicular to the
surface, favouring a strong interaction with the
nickel d-band. This is also reﬂected in a ratio of
the nickel and sulfur DOS atom as high as DOS(Ni)/
DOS(S)  0.52. For the other adsorption struc-
tures, the energy of the Slp is almost the same, but
there are large diﬀerences in the DOS ratio. While
the three most stable structures (ﬂat.2, ﬂat.3 and
ﬂat.4) show an important ratio DOS(Ni)/DOS(S)
varying between 0.31 and 0.40, related to short
bonds between sulfur and nickel atoms, for the
least stable ﬂat.1 geometry we ﬁnd a low ratio of
DOS(Ni)/DOS(S)  0.10 related to a rather long
nickel–sulfur bond. The tilted and ﬂat.5 structures,
with a comparable number of short adsorbate–
substrate bonds, but diﬀerent adsorption energies,
are distinguishable through the DOS ratio. The
ﬁrst (tilted) one has a low ratio of DOS(Ni)/
DOS(S)  0.12 while the second (ﬂat.5) one yields
a relatively large ratio of DOS(Ni)/DOS(S)  0.33.
This indicates that in spite of similar sulfur–nickel
distances, the ﬂat.5 geometry allows for a stronger
Slp–Niðd3z2r2Þ overlap leading to a substantially
higher adsorption energy. A similar analysis of the
donation from the p-orbital of the molecule to the
d-band of the nickel is complicated by the fact that
the p-orbital falls inside the d-band of nickel, and
is smeared over a wide range of binding energies.
Only in the upright adsorption geometry a clear
signal of the 2b1 and 1a2 molecular orbitals sur-
vives after adsorption.
Summarising we can conclude that in addition
to the number of short bonds between molecule
and surface, the orbital interaction, through do-
nation and back-donation, plays an important role
in determining the stable adsorption geometry.
4.2. Density of states
Fig. 3 shows the DOS projected on the carbon
and sulfur atoms of the molecule and on the nickel
atom nearest to the sulfur atom, for ﬂat.4 and
upright adsorption structures. The projection on
the molecule shows that there is a strong interac-
tion between the molecule and the substrate, in-
volving a shift toward higher binding energies. The
2b1 and 1a2 orbitals of the gas phase molecule,
correspondingto the p-system, are strongly smeared
in the adsorbed structures, conﬁrming that the mole-
cule is linked to the substrate through its p-system.
The 9a1 orbital, corresponding to the sulfur lone-
pair, is also broadened, reﬂecting the interaction
between this orbital and the d-band of nickel.
5. Inﬂuence of the magnetism on the adsorption
energies
Nickel surfaces are evidently magnetic, and it
may be important to take this into account in the

calculation of adsorption energies. Table 4 shows
the results obtained for the adsorption energies for
the four most stable structures. We allowed in these
calculations a spin polarisation for all atoms, and
a new relaxation of the geometries. The analysis
of the ﬁnal geometries shows that the magnetisa-
tion does not change the adsorption structures
at all.
Secondly, as presented in Fig. 3, in the ferro-
magnetic state, the total nickel-DOS for the sur-
face with the adsorbates is strongly reduced at the
Fermi level, while on the clean surface the para-
magnetic d-band DOS has a maximum at the
Fermi level such that the Stoner-criterion for the
formation of a ferromagnetic ground state is sat-
isﬁed. For the nickel atoms interacting with the
adsorbate, the paramagnetic DOS is reduced by a
factor of at least two. While a non-bonded nickel
atom has a magnetic moment in a range of 0.638–
0.684lB, compared to m ¼ 0:712lB for the clean
surface, a bonded nickel atom has a moment of
about the half, in a range of 0.277–0.361lB (for a
detailed discussion of the magnetisation of nickel
surfaces, see [42]). Hence molecular or atomic
adsorbates induce a local demagnetisation of an
initially magnetic substrate, as already reported
for CO adsorption on nickel [43] and on a- and c-
Fe [44,45].
Thirdly, the analysis of adsorption energies
shows a common shift for each structure of about
0.4 eV. Such a shift is expected as (i) the local de-
magnetisation of the surface requires energy and
(ii) the exchange splitting of the Ni d-band re-
duces the hybridization of substrate and adsorbate
orbitals.
In summary we ﬁnd that spin polarisation ef-
fects lead to a global reduction of all the adsorp-
tion energies, but do not inﬂuence the adsorption
geometries.
6. Study of desulfurisation pathways
As seen above, three diﬀerent stable structures
are found for the adsorption of thiophene on
Ni(1 1 0). Experimentally, it is known that this
molecule dissociates on Ni(1 0 0) [5]. In this case,
using DFT calculations [25], Mittendorfer and
Hafner showed that the energetic barrier for a
direct desulfurisation is 0.71 eV, starting from the
most stable adsorption structure which has already
one broken carbon–sulfur bond. This reaction is
also found to be exothermic, with a heat of reac-
tion of 0.61 eV. Due to the relatively high barrier,
dissociation will occur only at elevated tempera-
tures. On the Ni(1 1 0) surface, the observation of
reactivity of bithiophene at low temperatures [19]
suggests a much lower barrier for the dissociation
of bithiophene and thiophene.
Diﬀerent reaction pathways have been studied
in order to clarify the desulfurisation mechanism.
The starting points have been chosen as the three
most stable adsorption structures (ﬂat.2, ﬂat.3
and ﬂat.4). For each case, two options have been
explored. Either, ﬁrst a single carbon–sulfur bond
is broken and dissociation takes place in two
steps through a mono-dissociated intermediate or
both carbon–sulfur bonds are broken simulta-
neously.

6.1. Dissociation with ﬂat.2 structure as starting
point
Fig. 4 shows the reaction scenario starting from
the ﬂat.2 structure. Table 5 relates the geometric
data for this reaction. The ﬁrst intermediate,
ﬂat.2MD, shows a mono-dissociated molecule,
with the sulfur atom almost in a hollow site, and
has an adsorption energy of 2.07, 0.63 eV more
stable than the starting point. This intermediate is
the result of the exothermic displacement of the sul-
fur atom from the long bridge site (two sulfur–
nickel bonds of 2.28 
A) to a site approximately
above a nickel atom in the trough (three sulfur–
nickel bonds of 2.29, 2.35 and 2.33 
A), combined
with the endothermic breaking of the sulfur–car-
bon bond. At the same time, the carbon–nickel
bonds become shorter and hence stronger. This
step is almost barrierless, with an early transition
state, TS.2.1, close to the starting point. The loss
of energy due to the breaking of the carbon bond
(already 11% longer than for ﬂat.2), is compen-
sated by shorter sulfur–nickel bonds (2.24 com-
pared to 2.28 
A) and carbon–nickel bonds.
The second part of the reaction implies the
scission of the second carbon–sulfur bond. The
product of the reaction, ﬂat.2.BD, shows the sulfur
atom above a Ni atom in the trough, with ﬁve
short sulfur–nickel bonds (of an average length of
2.23 
A), and a C4H4 fragment linked to the surface
through the terminal carbon atoms in bridge po-
sitions, bonded each to two nickel atoms in a sp3-
like conﬁguration, while the two other carbon
atoms are pushed away from the surface, in a sp2-
like conﬁguration. This structure is very stable,
with an adsorption energy of 3.74, 1.66 eV higher
than the starting ﬂat.2 structure. This high ad-
sorption energy is largely due to the stabilisation
of the sulfur atom, but also to a stronger bonding
of the terminal C atoms of the C4H4 fragment. The
transition state of this second step, TS.2.2 presents
on one side (on the right hand side in the ﬁgure)
the geometric characteristics of the ﬁnal product,
with carbon–nickel bonds of 1.91 and 2.15 

compared to 1.90 and 2.38 
A respectively, and a
carbon–carbon bond of 1.41 
A as in the ﬁnal
structure, and on the other side (left hand side of
ﬁgure) similar characteristics as those of the ﬁrst
TS.2.1 transition state, with a sulfur–carbon bond
of 2.08 
A (compared to 2.09 
A). This second step is
slightly less favourable, with a small energetic
barrier of 70 meV, which is still low, but will be the
limiting step in the kinetic process.
The pathway for the simultaneous scission of
both carbon–sulfur bonds is presented in Fig. 4,
and the associated geometric characteristics are
summarised in Table 5. In this case, the product of
the reaction is still the ﬂat.2.BD geometry, as de-
scribed beforehand. The reaction is exothermic
with DE ¼ 1:66 eV, and the barrier is 80 meV. The
transition state of this direct reaction, TS.2.3, is
not a properly named transition state, but a second-
order point, as it admits two imaginary frequen-
cies. One of these modes refers to the movement
of the atoms leading to the simultaneous scission
of the two carbon–sulfur bonds. The second one
corresponds to the movement of the atoms such as
to join the pathway for a sequential bond-break-
ing. Nevertheless, we can consider this state as a
transition state under the constraint of mirror
symmetry.
6.2. Dissociation with ﬂat.3 structure as starting
point
Fig. 5 shows the pathway for the two-step
dissociation of the molecule starting from the ad-
sorption geometry ﬂat.3. The geometric charac-
teristic can be read in Table 5. This reaction
scheme is similar to the previous one, but rotated
by 90. In contrast to the ﬂat.2.MD, in the mono-
dissociated intermediate, ﬂat.3.MD, sulfur occupies
a bridge position, with only two short sulfur–
nickel bonds (2.11 and 2.14 
A). The remaining
carbon–sulfur bond is also shorter (1.77 compared
to 1.84 
A for ﬂat.2.MD) but the terminal carbon–
carbon bond is longer (1.46 compared to 1.41 
A).
Moreover, this structure shows the same number
of short carbon–nickel bonds, but with a lower
average length (2.00 against 1.95 
A). All this geo-
metric considerations explain the fact that this
structure is a bit less stable than the ﬂat.2.MD
intermediate, with an adsorption energy of 2.39 eV
compared to 2.72 eV. As for the non-dissociated
structures, the adsorption energy depends on the
molecular distortion and on the number and
length of short molecule–substrate bonds. The ﬁrst
step of this reaction remains however exothermic
with DE ¼ 440 meV, and the reaction barrier is

170 meV. This barrier is still low, but is higher
than that obtained for the scheme starting from
ﬂat.2. This can be explained by the distortion en-
ergy of the molecule in each case. The two starting
points ﬂat.2 and ﬂat.3 have similar distortion en-
ergies of 2.09 and 1.98 eV respectively, while the
distortion energy of the transition state for the ﬁrst
scheme is 2.65 eV, 390 meV lower than that for the
second one (3.06 eV).
The second step leads to the ﬂat.3.BD struc-
ture, which can be easily compared to the ﬂat.2.BD
one. It contains a sulfur in a hollow site, coordi-
nated by ﬁve nickel atoms at an average distance
of 2.25 
A (2.23 
A for the ﬂat.2.BD structure), and
a C4H4 fragment linked by its two terminal car-
bons to the surface. Each of these carbon atoms is
located in a bridge position between two nickel
atoms of diﬀerent rows. The average nickel–
carbon distance is 2.00 
A, a bit higher than for
the ﬂat.2.BD structure. Despite these small diﬀer-
ences, the two structures have almost identical
adsorption energies of 3.77 and 3.74 eV respec-
tively.
The energetic barrier for the breaking of the
second carbon–sulfur bond is 450 meV, higher
than that found for the second dissociation step
starting from ﬂat.2 structure. This can be ex-
plained by the strained sulfur–carbon bond (2.28

A) persisting in the transition state structure,
TS.3.2. This is in turn a consequence of long dis-
tance between the nickel atoms from two diﬀerent
rows, to which the carbon and sulfur atoms in-
volved in the carbon–sulfur bond are linked. The
second step limits the reaction rate.
The simultaneous dissociation of both carbon–
sulfur bonds starting from ﬂat.3 structure is
represented in Fig. 5b. Again, the transition
state is in fact a second-order point with two
imaginary frequencies. The reaction barrier is
high, 550 meV. This can be explained as for
TS.3.2 by the relatively long carbon–sulfur bonds
(2.25 
A).

6.3. Dissociation with ﬂat.4 structure as starting
point
Starting from the ﬂat.4 structure, two diﬀerent
ways may be followed by the molecule to dissoci-
ate, as the carbon–sulfur bonds are not equivalent.
It is impossible to break the carbon–sulfur bond
which is perpendicular to the rows of nickel atoms.
This is a consequence of the fact that when this
bond is broken, the sulfur atom is linked only to
one carbon atom and one nickel atom. In this case,
the relaxation of the structure leads deﬁnitely back
to the non-dissociated molecule, because the pas-
sage of the sulfur atom to the other side of the
nickel row and the bonding to the other nickel
atoms are not possible, since during this reaction
pathway the sulfur atom is not stabilised at all.
The only possibility is then the breaking of the
other sulfur–carbon bond, parallel to the nickel
rows. The ﬁrst dissociation scheme along that way
is shown in Fig. 6, and the geometric characteris-
tics are given in Table 5. The barrier of this reac-
tion is high (700 meV), because the transition state
TS.4.1 admits just one short sulfur–nickel bond (of
2.11 
A), and one carbon–nickel bond (of 1.78 
A).
The product of this scheme, ﬂat.4.MD, is diﬀerent
from the previous mono-dissociated intermediates,
because the sulfur atom is already in a hollow
site, making three short bonds with nickel atoms.
Hence, it is in a second time impossible to break
the second carbon–sulfur bond, apart from mov-
ing the entire C4H4 fragment away from the sulfur
atom. This possibility costs too high an energy to
be possible. Finally, the product of this dissocia-
tion is just an unsaturated thiol, linked through the
sulfur atom and the carbon atoms to the surface.
Nevertheless, in case of hydrotreatment, it may be
possible to dissociate this molecule.
Finally, this study has shown that the most
stable structure ﬂat.4, does not lead to a dissoci-
ation of the thiophene molecule, but only to an
adsorbed thiol. In contrast, the two other stable
structures, ﬂat.2 and ﬂat.3, can lead to complete
desulfurisation of the molecule in a sulfur atom
and a C4H4 fragment. Moreover, the high barrier
for this scission suggests that the molecule in ﬂat.4
adsorption structure, the most stable one, may
follow another reaction scheme, as for example a
dehydrogenation.
7. Kinetic characteristics of desulfuration
The calculated kinetic rate-constants for the
diﬀerent reaction schemes previously presented are
shown in Fig. 7 as a function of the inverse on the
temperature. They have been calculated within the
conventional transition-state theory, as described
in Section 2. For the simultaneous breaking of
both C–S bond (steps ﬂat.2 > ﬂat.2.BD and ﬂat.3 >
ﬂat.3.BD), the transition-state theory cannot be em-
ployed, as the ﬂat.2.3 and ﬂat.3.3 states are not true
transition state but second-order stationary points.
The diﬀerences between the various schemes are
principally due to the diﬀerent barriers. A low
barrier, as for the ﬁrst step ﬂat.2 > ﬂat.2.MD of the
dissociation in two steps, involves a high rate-
constant (4 · 1012 s1 at 300 K), while a high bar-
rier, as for the ﬂat3.MD > ﬂat.3.BD step, implies a
low-rate constant (5 · 105 s1 at 300 K). That is the
Fig. 6. Energetic proﬁle for the reaction pathway for the mono-desulfurisation of thiophene on Ni(1 1 0). Starting from the ﬂat.4
adsorption conﬁguration, scheme with scission of one carbon–sulfur bond. dC–S: short C–S bond length.

reason why we did not compute kinetic constant
for the inverse reactions, which have much higher
energetic barriers than outward reactions, except
for the ﬂat.4 < > ﬂat.4.MD reaction.
The variation as a function of temperature is
mostly due to the variation of the exponential eEa=kT
term, which increases with temperature, while in
the most cases, the Arrhenius prefactors slightly
decreases with temperature. Globally, the kinetic
constants increase with temperature, as it can be
seen in the table. Moreover, a ﬁt of those curves can
lead to results that would be comparable to a future
experimental study. For the ﬂat.2 > ﬂat.2.MD step,
ones ﬁnd a Eact ¼ 0:01 eV. For the other steps,
Eact(ﬂat.2.MD > ﬂat.2.BD) ¼ 0.06 eV, Eact(ﬂat.3 >
ﬂat.3.MD) ¼ 0.17 eV, Eact(ﬂat.3.MD > ﬂat.3.BD) ¼
0.43
eV,
Eact(ﬂat.4 > ﬂat.4.MD) ¼ 0.66
eV
and
Eact(ﬂat.4.MD > ﬂat.4) ¼ 0.79 eV. Those values are
really close to the computed activation energies
presented in Figs. 4–6, which shows the small
contribution of the prefactor variation.
Finally, for the dissociation from ﬂat.2 and
ﬂat.3 adsorption conﬁgurations, molecules will
dissociate in two steps and the scission of the sec-
ond carbon–sulfur bond is slower than the scission
of the ﬁrst one. The dissociation from the most
stable ﬂat.4 adsorption structure will be very slow,
and may not happen at low temperature. The ex-
perimental results indicate, however, that the mol-
ecule does not remain in its native conﬁguration,
even at low temperature. Hence, as the desulfuri-
sation cannot happen from the most stable struc-
ture ﬂat.4, we can propose that a ﬁrst step is the
moving of the molecule from this ﬂat.4 conﬁgu-
ration to the less stable ﬂat.2 or ﬂat.3 ones, which
are excellent precursors for molecular dissociation.
This step is just a rotation of the molecule on the
surface and would not need a high activation en-
ergy. In another way, thiophene molecule may
decompose through other reactions, such as de-
hydrogenation. Ab initio studies of these reactions
are in progress and may be reported soon.
8. Conclusions
The adsorption of thiophene molecules on a
nickel (1 1 0) surface, and their desulfurisation
have been investigated in this density-functional
study. The (1 1 0) surface allows numerous ad-
sorption conﬁgurations, out of which three have
large adsorption energies Eads ¼ 1:95, 2.08 and
2.42 eV. All present the aromatic ring parallel to
the surface. The geometric distortion of the ad-
sorbed molecule plays an important role in deter-
mining the adsorption energy. This geometric
distortion implies a more or less important loss of
the aromaticity of the molecule. Another impor-
tant geometric characteristic is the number of
short carbon–nickel and sulfur–nickel bonds be-
tween the molecule and the slab. Moreover, a
diﬀerential charge-density analysis shows an elec-
tron redistribution within the system. There is a
donation from the sulfur lone-pair to the nickel
atoms and back-donation from nickel d-band to
the p system of the molecule. This latter eﬀect has
been shown also from a projected density of states
analysis. A combined analysis of all the parame-
ters permits to understand the diﬀerences in the
adsorption energies depending on the structure.
The role of spin polarisation has been clariﬁed:

even if the adsorption energies are lowered, neither
the geometries of the adsorption structures do
change, nor does their relative stability.
Starting from the three most stable adsorption
conﬁgurations, the reaction paths and transition
states for desulfurisation of the molecule have
been investigated. The most stable adsorption
structure of thiophene leads to a thiol via an ac-
tivated reaction with an energetic barrier of 0.70
eV. The two other ones can lead to a total disso-
ciation into a C4H4 fragment and a sulfur atom,
with low barriers (0.07 meV).
Altogether, our results provide a reasonable
scenario for the complex behaviour of thiophene
on Ni surfaces, demonstrating the increased reac-
tivity of Ni(1 1 0) compared to the more close
packed Ni surfaces.
Although, when starting from the most stable
adsorption conﬁguration (ﬂat.4), even the ﬁrst C–S
bond breaking is an activated process, dissociation
into coadsorbed S and C4H4 fragment is possible
through other reaction channels. The ﬂat.3 and
ﬂat.2 conﬁgurations are locally stable against
transformation into the ﬂat.4 conﬁguration, but
only marginally stable against transformation into
a linear thiol (activation energies of 0.02 and 0.17
eV for ﬂat.2 and ﬂat.3, respectively) followed by
dissociation into S and C4H4. These decomposi-
tion reactions are highly exothermic. Hence disso-
ciation will take place before a transformation to
the most stable ﬂat.4 conﬁguration can occur. Only
if the molecule arriving on the surface is immedi-
ately adsorbed in the ﬂat.4 mode, metastable mo-
lecular thiol can be formed on the Ni(1 1 0) surface.
On Ni(1 0 0) on the other hand, complete dissoci-
ation into SandC4H4 is always anactivated process,
even if it occurs through a stable thiol precursor.
The more complex scenario found on Ni(1 1 0) is
clearly a consequence of the open, corrugated
structure of the substrate which enables a variety
of locally stable adsorption conﬁgurations.
