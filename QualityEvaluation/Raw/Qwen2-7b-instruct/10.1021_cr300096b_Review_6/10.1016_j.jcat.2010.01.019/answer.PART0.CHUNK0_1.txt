<p>In the study of model Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, it was found that Pt atoms would segregate to the surface under reduction conditions.</p>
<p>The spectra for bimetallic catalysts in Fig. 1 a demonstrate that CO binds through surface Pt atoms, while the spectra in Fig. 1 b show that regardless of impregnation sequence, catalysts of the same weight loading show similar CO vibrational frequencies, indicating that the catalyst surfaces have similar structures (namely Pt resides on the surface).</p>
<p>Recent XPS studies on both polycrystalline Ni/Pt films and on supported Pt/Ni nanoparticles have also shown that Pt resides on the surface after reduction in H2.</p>
<p>Studies on model bimetallic systems have also demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces, either the PtNiPt(1 1 1) prepared by deposition and subsequent diffusion of one monolayer Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or the PtNi(1 1 1) surface prepared by depositing ML Pt on Ni(1 1 1), lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation because they bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than either parent metal.</p>

The presence of Pt on the surface of the catalysts is confirmed by the CO adsorption data and XPS studies. The results suggest that during reduction at high temperatures, Pt atoms segregate to the surface, which is consistent with previous DFT modeling and surface science studies where the Pt-terminated surface is thermodynamically stable under reducing environments. This surface termination facilitates the novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity observed on the model Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts.

通过CO吸附数据和XPS研究，证实了Pt位于催化剂表面。结果表明，在高温还原条件下，Pt原子会向表面聚积。这与之前基于DFT建模和表面科学研究的观察一致，即在还原环境中，终止于Pt的表面具有热力学稳定性。这种表面终止方式使得模型Ni/Pt(1 1 1)表面和支持型Pt/Ni催化剂表现出新型低温氢化活性。
