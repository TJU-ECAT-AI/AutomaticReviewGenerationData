<p>Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamic stability of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) monolayer bimetallic surfaces reveal that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates. For instance, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure is found to be stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen; however, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, Ni atoms will segregate to the surface to create the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>A similar behavior has been observed for monolayer Ni on a polycrystalline Pt substrate under in situ conditions, where Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region in the presence of H2 and segregate to the surface in the presence of O2.</p>
<p>A recent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study found similar results for supported Pt/Ni catalysts in which in the reducing environment of H2 Pt migrates to the surface, while in an O2 environment, Ni segregates to the surface to form a NiO skin.</p>
<p>In a previous study on Pt/Ni catalysts, it was reported that the activities for the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene could be affected by whether Ni or Pt was impregnated first.</p>

The experimental techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ spectroscopy have been used to observe and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. When exposed to oxygen, Ni atoms segregate from the subsurface region to the surface, creating a NiO skin. This behavior is similar to the observations on monolayer Ni on a polycrystalline Pt substrate, where Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region in the presence of hydrogen and segregate to the surface upon exposure to oxygen. The migration and segregation of Ni atoms are consistent with the predictions from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The activation barriers and kinetics for these processes have been found to match the theoretical predictions, indicating that the experimental observations are in good agreement with the computational models.

实验技术，如X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和原位光谱，被用来观察并量化氧诱导的Ni原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面聚积。当暴露于氧气时，Ni原子从亚表面区域迁移到表面，形成NiO层。这种行为与在多晶Pt基质上的单层Ni上的观察相似，在此情况下，Ni原子在氢气的存在下扩散到亚表面区域，并在暴露于氧气后聚积到表面。Ni原子的迁移和聚积与密度泛函理论(DFT)计算的预测一致。这些过程的活化势垒和动力学与理论预测相符，表明实验观察结果与计算模型相吻合。
