<p>In the introduction, the authors state that "Bimetallic catalysts often exhibit activities and selectivities that differ from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts" and that "combined experimental studies and theoretical calculations have been performed in an effort to correlate the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces to chemical reactivities."</p>
<p>The authors further explain that recent research has focused on the structure of bimetallic surfaces influencing electronic and catalytic properties.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the work is to correlate the effects of Pt:Ni atomic ratio and impregnation sequence with the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation and with the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of benzene and 1,3-butadiene.</p>
<p>The authors mention that the effect of metal atomic ratio was studied by synthesizing bimetallic catalysts with Pt:Ni ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:10.</p>
<p>They also state that the effect of impregnation sequence was investigated by synthesizing catalysts using either a Ni-first or a Pt-first sequential impregnation or a simultaneous co-impregnation.</p>
<p>Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the extent of bimetallic formation and particle size, respectively.</p>
<p>The authors explain that the aim is to study the effects of these two series of catalysts on the hydrogenation of conjugated systems, specifically choosing benzene and 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation as probe reactions due to their fundamental and practical significance.</p>

Experimental techniques such as EXAFS and TEM were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers were compared with DFT predictions. This work aimed to correlate the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation with the hydrogenation activity of benzene and 1,3-butadiene. The study synthesized bimetallic catalysts with varying Pt:Ni ratios and impregnation sequences, finding that the hydrogenation activity increased with increased Ni loading and co-impregnation. The results showed a correlation between the extent of bimetallic bond formation and hydrogenation activity, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of Pt atoms on the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic performance.

实验技术，如EXAFS和TEM，被用来验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面亚晶格中3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的分层情况。测量的分层动力学和激活势垒与DFT预测进行了比较。这项工作旨在将PtNi双金属键形成程度与苯和1,3-丁二烯的氢化活性相关联。通过合成具有不同Pt:Ni比率和浸渍顺序的双金属催化剂，研究发现随着镍加载量的增加和共浸渍，氢化活性增加。结果表明，双金属键形成程度与氢化活性之间存在相关性，支持了Pt原子位于双金属纳米粒子表面对于增强催化性能至关重要这一假设。
