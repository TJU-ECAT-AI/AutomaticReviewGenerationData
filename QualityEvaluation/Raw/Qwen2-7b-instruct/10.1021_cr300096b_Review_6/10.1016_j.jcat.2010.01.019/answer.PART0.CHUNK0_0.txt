<p>In the study of model Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, it was found that Pt atoms would segregate to the surface under reduction conditions.</p>
<p>The spectra for bimetallic catalysts in Fig. 1a demonstrate that CO binds through surface Pt atoms, while the spectra in Fig. 1b show that regardless of impregnation sequence, catalysts of the same weight loading show similar CO vibrational frequencies, indicating that the catalyst surfaces have similar structures (namely Pt resides on the surface).</p>
<p>Studies on model bimetallic systems have also demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces, either the PtNiPt(111) prepared by deposition and subsequent diffusion of one monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) or the PtNi(111) surface prepared by depositing ML Pt on Ni(111), lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation because they bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than either parent metal.</p>
<p>Surface science and DFT studies have observed that the strain effect from the lattice mismatch can modify the electronic structure of metals, which contributes to the novel activity observed on monolayer bimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>The results presented in this paper clearly show that bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds.</p>
<p>In studying the effect of metal atomic ratio, it was found that hydrogenation activity increased with increasing Ni loading. Similarly, it was found that the catalyst synthesized by co-impregnation exhibited the highest activity in comparison with either sequentially impregnated catalyst.</p>
<p>Hydrogenation activity was also seen to correlate to PtNi coordination numbers calculated from EXAFS measurements.</p>
<p>FTIR CO adsorption results suggest that Pt resides on the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles and that the Pt atoms can segregate during reduction at high temperatures, which is consistent with previous DFT modeling and surface science studies in which the Pt-terminated surface is thermodynamically stable under reducing environment.</p>

The experimental techniques of High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can be compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems. 

The HREELS technique analyzes the energy loss of electrons in the interaction with the sample, providing information on the chemical state and bonding configuration of the atoms. AES, on the other hand, detects the secondary electrons emitted from the sample due to the interaction of primary electrons, allowing for the determination of the elemental composition and the chemical environment of the atoms. 

In the context of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, these techniques can reveal the dynamics of atom migration and segregation, especially in response to environmental changes such as the introduction of oxygen. The activation barriers derived from these experiments can be contrasted with theoretical calculations from DFT to assess the accuracy of the latter and to gain insights into the mechanisms governing the surface chemistry of these materials.

In summary, HREELS and AES offer complementary perspectives on the surface properties of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, enabling a detailed understanding of the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms and its impact on the material's performance. This information can then be used to refine theoretical models and to design materials with improved functionality for specific applications.

高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS）和辅助电子能谱（AES）可以验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由于氧气诱导的表面原子层析。这些系统中，可以比较所测量的层析动力学和激活势垒与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测的结果。

HREELS技术通过分析电子与样品之间的能量损失来分析化学状态和键合配置信息。AES则检测由初级电子与样品相互作用后产生的次级电子，从而确定元素组成及其原子环境。

对于Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系而言，这些技术能够揭示原子迁移和层析的动力学，特别是在引入氧气等环境变化时。从实验中获得的激活势垒可以与DFT理论计算进行对比，以评估后者准确性，并深入了解这些材料的表面化学机制。

简而言之，HREELS和AES为理解Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面性质提供了互补视角，有助于详细理解由于氧气诱导的表面原子层析及其对材料性能的影响。这些信息可用于优化理论模型设计，并开发具有特定应用功能的材料。
