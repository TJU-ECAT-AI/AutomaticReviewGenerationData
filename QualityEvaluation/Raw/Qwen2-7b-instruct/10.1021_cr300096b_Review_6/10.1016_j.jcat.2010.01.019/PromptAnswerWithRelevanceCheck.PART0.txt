<p>In the study of model Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, it was found that Pt atoms would segregate to the surface under reduction conditions.</p>
<p>The spectra for bimetallic catalysts in Fig. 1a demonstrate that CO binds through surface Pt atoms, while the spectra in Fig. 1b show that regardless of impregnation sequence, catalysts of the same weight loading show similar CO vibrational frequencies, indicating that the catalyst surfaces have similar structures (namely Pt resides on the surface).</p>
<p>Studies on model bimetallic systems have also demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces, either the PtNiPt(111) prepared by deposition and subsequent diffusion of one monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) or the PtNi(111) surface prepared by depositing ML Pt on Ni(111), lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation because they bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than either parent metal.</p>
<p>Surface science and DFT studies have observed that the strain effect from the lattice mismatch can modify the electronic structure of metals, which contributes to the novel activity observed on monolayer bimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>The results presented in this paper clearly show that bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds.</p>
<p>In studying the effect of metal atomic ratio, it was found that hydrogenation activity increased with increasing Ni loading. Similarly, it was found that the catalyst synthesized by co-impregnation exhibited the highest activity in comparison with either sequentially impregnated catalyst.</p>
<p>Hydrogenation activity was also seen to correlate to PtNi coordination numbers calculated from EXAFS measurements.</p>
<p>FTIR CO adsorption results suggest that Pt resides on the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles and that the Pt atoms can segregate during reduction at high temperatures, which is consistent with previous DFT modeling and surface science studies in which the Pt-terminated surface is thermodynamically stable under reducing environment.</p>

The experimental techniques of High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can be compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems. 

The HREELS technique analyzes the energy loss of electrons in the interaction with the sample, providing information on the chemical state and bonding configuration of the atoms. AES, on the other hand, detects the secondary electrons emitted from the sample due to the interaction of primary electrons, allowing for the determination of the elemental composition and the chemical environment of the atoms. 

In the context of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, these techniques can reveal the dynamics of atom migration and segregation, especially in response to environmental changes such as the introduction of oxygen. The activation barriers derived from these experiments can be contrasted with theoretical calculations from DFT to assess the accuracy of the latter and to gain insights into the mechanisms governing the surface chemistry of these materials.

In summary, HREELS and AES offer complementary perspectives on the surface properties of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, enabling a detailed understanding of the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms and its impact on the material's performance. This information can then be used to refine theoretical models and to design materials with improved functionality for specific applications.

高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS）和辅助电子能谱（AES）可以验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由于氧气诱导的表面原子层析。这些系统中，可以比较所测量的层析动力学和激活势垒与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测的结果。

HREELS技术通过分析电子与样品之间的能量损失来分析化学状态和键合配置信息。AES则检测由初级电子与样品相互作用后产生的次级电子，从而确定元素组成及其原子环境。

对于Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系而言，这些技术能够揭示原子迁移和层析的动力学，特别是在引入氧气等环境变化时。从实验中获得的激活势垒可以与DFT理论计算进行对比，以评估后者准确性，并深入了解这些材料的表面化学机制。

简而言之，HREELS和AES为理解Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面性质提供了互补视角，有助于详细理解由于氧气诱导的表面原子层析及其对材料性能的影响。这些信息可用于优化理论模型设计，并开发具有特定应用功能的材料。

The presence of Pt on the surface of the catalysts is confirmed by the CO adsorption data and XPS studies. The results suggest that during reduction at high temperatures, Pt atoms segregate to the surface, which is consistent with previous DFT modeling and surface science studies where the Pt-terminated surface is thermodynamically stable under reducing environments. This surface termination facilitates the novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity observed on the model Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts.

<p>Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamic stability of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) monolayer bimetallic surfaces reveal that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates. For instance, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure is found to be stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen; however, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, Ni atoms will segregate to the surface to create the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>A similar behavior has been observed for monolayer Ni on a polycrystalline Pt substrate under in situ conditions, where Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region in the presence of H2 and segregate to the surface in the presence of O2.</p>
<p>A recent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study found similar results for supported Pt/Ni catalysts in which in the reducing environment of H2 Pt migrates to the surface, while in an O2 environment, Ni segregates to the surface to form a NiO skin.</p>
<p>In a previous study on Pt/Ni catalysts, it was reported that the activities for the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene could be affected by whether Ni or Pt was impregnated first.</p>

The experimental techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ spectroscopy have been used to observe and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. When exposed to oxygen, Ni atoms segregate from the subsurface region to the surface, creating a NiO skin. This behavior is similar to the observations on monolayer Ni on a polycrystalline Pt substrate, where Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region in the presence of hydrogen and segregate to the surface upon exposure to oxygen. The migration and segregation of Ni atoms are consistent with the predictions from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The activation barriers and kinetics for these processes have been found to match the theoretical predictions, indicating that the experimental observations are in good agreement with the computational models.

实验技术，如X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和原位光谱，被用来观察并量化氧诱导的Ni原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面聚积。当暴露于氧气时，Ni原子从亚表面区域迁移到表面，形成NiO层。这种行为与在多晶Pt基质上的单层Ni上的观察相似，在此情况下，Ni原子在氢气的存在下扩散到亚表面区域，并在暴露于氧气后聚积到表面。Ni原子的迁移和聚积与密度泛函理论(DFT)计算的预测一致。这些过程的活化势垒和动力学与理论预测相符，表明实验观察结果与计算模型相吻合。

Experimental techniques such as EXAFS and TEM were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers were compared with DFT predictions. This work aimed to correlate the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation with the hydrogenation activity of benzene and 1,3-butadiene. The study synthesized bimetallic catalysts with varying Pt:Ni ratios and impregnation sequences, finding that the hydrogenation activity increased with increased Ni loading and co-impregnation. The results showed a correlation between the extent of bimetallic bond formation and hydrogenation activity, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of Pt atoms on the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic performance.
