<p>Early work on bimetallic catalysts also showed that the catalytic properties can be tuned by adjusting the relative amounts of the two metals.</p>
<p>Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamic stability of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) monolayer bimetallic surfaces reveal that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates.</p>
<p>A recent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study found similar results for supported Pt/Ni catalysts in which in the reducing environment of H2 Pt migrates to the surface, while in an O2 environment, Ni segregates to the surface to form a NiO skin.</p>
<p>In a previous study on Pt/Ni catalysts, it was reported that the activities for the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene could be affected by whether Ni or Pt was impregnated first.</p>
<p>The results from the fitting procedure are summarized in Table 4 .</p>
<p>Based on the evidence from the XANES and EXAFS of the reduced samples discussed above, PtO peaks disappear and PtM (M = Pt or Ni) peaks appear at slightly larger values of R.</p>
<p>Also, good fits to the Pt LIII-edge data could only be obtained by including both PtPt and PtNi contributions in the model, which strongly suggests that bimetallic bonds are present in the bimetallic nanoparticles.</p>
<p>In studying the effect of metal atomic ratio, it was found that hydrogenation activity increased with increasing Ni loading.</p>
<p>Similarly, it was found that the catalyst synthesized by co-impregnation exhibited the highest activity in comparison with either sequentially impregnated catalyst.</p>
<p>Hydrogenation activity was also seen to correlate to PtNi coordination numbers calculated from EXAFS measurements.</p>
<p>FTIR CO adsorption results suggest that Pt resides on the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles and that the Pt atoms can segregate during reduction at high temperatures, which is consistent with previous DFT modeling and surface science studies in which the Pt-terminated surface is thermodynamically stable under reducing environment.</p>

1. The catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts can be adjusted by changing the proportion of the two metals involved.
2. The migration of the Ni monolayer on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface depends on the presence of adsorbates.
3. In a reducing environment of hydrogen (H2), Pt migrates to the surface in supported Pt/Ni catalysts, while in an oxygen (O2) environment, Ni forms a NiO layer on the surface.
4. The activities of certain reactions involving Pt/Ni catalysts can be influenced by the order in which Ni and Pt are added during synthesis.
5. The extent of PtNi bonding in bimetallic nanoparticles can be quantified using EXAFS analysis.
6. After reduction, PtO peaks vanish and Pt-Ni peaks appear at slightly larger distances, indicating a change in the oxidation state of Pt.
7. The presence of PtNi bonds in bimetallic nanoparticles is confirmed by fitting the EXAFS data.
8. Increasing the amount of Ni in the catalysts generally enhances the hydrogenation activity.
9. Catalysts synthesized through simultaneous co-impregnation show higher activity compared to those made via sequential impregnation.
10. Hydrogenation activity correlates with the coordination number of PtNi bonds as determined by EXAFS.
11. FTIR CO adsorption data indicates that Pt is localized on the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles, and its position changes during reduction at high temperatures, aligning with previous theoretical and surface science findings on the Pt-terminated surface stability.

1. 双金属催化剂的催化性质可以通过调整两种金属的比例来调整。
2. Ni/Pt(1 1 1)表面中Ni单层的迁移取决于吸附剂的存在。
3. 在还原环境中，当环境为氢气（H2）时，Pt在支持的Pt/Ni催化剂中向表面迁移；而在氧气（O2）环境下，Ni在表面上形成NiO层。
4. Pt/Ni催化剂中某些反应的活性可以由Ni和Pt添加顺序决定。
5. EXAFS分析可以量化双金属纳米颗粒中的PtNi结合程度。
6. 在还原后，PtO峰消失，而Pt-Ni峰出现在稍大的距离上，表明Pt的氧化状态发生了变化。
7. 通过拟合EXAFS数据，确认了双金属纳米颗粒中存在的PtNi键。
8. 增加Ni在催化剂中的含量通常会提高氢化活性。
9. 同时共浸渍合成的催化剂显示出比依次浸渍合成的催化剂更高的活性。
10. 氢化活性与EXAFS测定的PtNi键的配位数成正比。
11. FTIR CO吸附数据显示，Pt定位在双金属纳米颗粒的表面，并且在高温下其位置发生变化，这与之前理论和表面科学研究中关于Pt终止表面稳定性的发现相一致。
