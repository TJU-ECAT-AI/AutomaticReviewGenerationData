The document does not contain any information related to HREELS and AES techniques being used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. Nor does it provide comparisons of measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions for these systems.
