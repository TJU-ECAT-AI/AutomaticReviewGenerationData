<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Experimental techniques such as TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques provided insights into the structural changes that occurred upon oxygen exposure and helped to understand the origins behind the variations in hydrogenation activity among the supported catalysts.

使用TEM（透射电子显微镜）和EXAFS（扩展X射线吸收精细结构）等实验技术验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）的表面层析。这些技术提供了关于氧气暴露后结构变化的信息，并有助于理解支持催化剂之间氢化活性差异的起源。

The hydrogenation activity on the support leads the trend of SiO2 > r-Al2O3 > TiO2.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydrogenation activity of the supported catalysts followed a trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. This observation was consistent with the coordination numbers of the PtNi bimetallic bonds in the three catalysts, indicating that the extent of PtNi bond formation influenced the catalytic performance.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
支持的催化剂的氢化活性遵循SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2的趋势。这一观察结果与三种催化剂中的PtNi双金属键的配位数一致，表明PtNi键形成程度影响了催化性能。
