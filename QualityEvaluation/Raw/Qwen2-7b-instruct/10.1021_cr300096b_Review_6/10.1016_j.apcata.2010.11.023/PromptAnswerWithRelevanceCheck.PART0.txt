The supported catalysts were characterized using TEM and EXAFS in order to understand the origins responsible for the difference in hydrogenation activity.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Experimental techniques such as TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques provided insights into the structural changes that occurred upon oxygen exposure and helped to understand the origins behind the variations in hydrogenation activity among the supported catalysts.

The hydrogenation activity on the support leads the trend of SiO2 > r-Al2O3 > TiO2.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydrogenation activity of the supported catalysts followed a trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. This observation was consistent with the coordination numbers of the PtNi bimetallic bonds in the three catalysts, indicating that the extent of PtNi bond formation influenced the catalytic performance.

<p>The production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons has attracted a great deal of attention due to their merits such as renewable, potentially sustainable and environmentally benign.</p>
<p>Bimetallic catalysts have been utilized in many reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming due to their unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts.</p>
<p>The extent of PtNi bond formation followed the trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, which correlated very well with the hydrogenation activity.</p>
<p>The comparison in Fig. 5 reveals that the Pt/Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows much higher hydrogenation activity than either the γ-Al2O3 or TiO2 supported catalysts.</p>
<p>The activity trend can be correlated with the PtNi coordination number obtained from EXAFS analysis, suggesting that the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation is related to the enhanced hydrogenation activity.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The experimental techniques of HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by analyzing the changes in the electronic structure and the interaction with the substrate. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can be compared with DFT predictions to understand the mechanism and energetics of the segregation process. This comparison helps to validate the accuracy of DFT calculations and provides insights into the effect of surface chemistry on the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study found that the hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on different oxide supports followed a specific trend. Specifically, the catalysts supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest activity, followed by those on γ-Al2O3, and then TiO2. This trend was closely linked to the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation, which itself was influenced by the nature of the oxide support. The EXAFS analysis provided insights into the coordination numbers of PtNi bonds, correlating them with the hydrogenation activity and revealing that the strength of the interaction between TiO2 and the metal particles led to lower activity and fewer active sites on the TiO2-supported catalysts.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
研究发现，不同氧化物支持的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂的氢化活性遵循特定的趋势。具体来说，SiO2上的催化剂表现出最高的活性，随后是γ-Al2O3，然后是TiO2。这一趋势与PtNi双金属键形成程度密切相关，而这种程度又受到氧化物支持物性质的影响。EXAFS分析提供了PtNi键协调数的信息，揭示了这些值与氢化活性之间的关联，并表明TiO2与金属颗粒之间的强烈相互作用导致TiO2支持的催化剂活性较低和活性位点较少。
