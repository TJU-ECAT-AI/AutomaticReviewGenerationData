<p>The production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons has attracted a great deal of attention due to their merits such as renewable, potentially sustainable and environmentally benign.</p>
<p>Bimetallic catalysts have been utilized in many reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming due to their unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts.</p>
<p>The extent of PtNi bond formation followed the trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, which correlated very well with the hydrogenation activity.</p>
<p>The comparison in Fig. 5 reveals that the Pt/Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows much higher hydrogenation activity than either the γ-Al2O3 or TiO2 supported catalysts.</p>
<p>The activity trend can be correlated with the PtNi coordination number obtained from EXAFS analysis, suggesting that the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation is related to the enhanced hydrogenation activity.</p>

The experimental techniques of HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by analyzing the changes in the electronic structure and the interaction with the substrate. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can be compared with DFT predictions to understand the mechanism and energetics of the segregation process. This comparison helps to validate the accuracy of DFT calculations and provides insights into the effect of surface chemistry on the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts.
