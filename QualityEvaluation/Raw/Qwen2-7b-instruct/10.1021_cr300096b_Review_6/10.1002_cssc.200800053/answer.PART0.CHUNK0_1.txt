Alternative energy sources are of significant interest due to their potential to increase energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass, being widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, can contribute to energy supply without adding to CO2 emissions. Oxygenates derived from biomass can be further processed through aqueous phase reforming to generate hydrogen for fuel cells. Tuning the reforming process can also yield hydrogen and carbon monoxide mixtures suitable for coupling with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to produce liquid alkanes compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure. The current study confirms that glycerol reforming follows similar trends to smaller oxygenates, validating the use of these smaller molecules as models in catalysis and surface science studies. The CO desorption temperatures for glycerol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol were comparable, and glycerol reforming showed increasing activity as the surface dband center approached the Fermi level. Reforming was the dominant reaction pathway across all surfaces, with selectivities ranging from 50% to 90%.

替代能源来源因其能够增加能源供应并减少温室气体排放而受到极大关注。生物质作为广泛可用、无碳和可再生的资源，可以不增加二氧化碳排放的情况下为能源供应做出重要贡献。生物基氧源可以通过水相重整进一步反应生成用于燃料电池的氢气。调整重整过程也可以产生氢气和一氧化碳混合物，适合与现有的石油运输和存储基础设施结合使用。当前的研究表明，甘油的重整遵循与较小氧源相似的趋势，验证了在催化和表面科学研究中使用这些较小分子作为模型的有效性。甘油、乙二醇和乙醇的CO脱附温度相近，甘油的重整活性随着表面dband中心接近费米能级而增加。在整个表面上，重整是主要的反应途径，选择性范围从50%到90%。
