[1] "Glycerol was found to react selectively on these surfaces in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments to form H2 and CO; no other gas-phase products were detected."
[2] "The first equation is the desired reforming reaction to produce H2 and CO. The second reaction represents total decomposition that produces H2 as well as C(ad) and O(ad)."
[3] "Reforming was the primary reaction pathway on all surfaces, with selectivities of 50-90%."

1. Glycerol undergoes selective reactions on the surfaces, producing hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) as the only gas-phase products. The desired reforming reaction aims to produce H2 and CO, while the secondary reaction involves the complete decomposition of glycerol, yielding H2 along with carbon atoms and oxygen atoms in adsorbed states.
2. The reforming process on all surfaces primarily follows the production of H2 and CO, with a selectivity range of 50-90%.

1. 甘油在这些表面上进行选择性反应，产生氢气(H2)和一氧化碳(CO)作为唯一的气相产物。期望的重整反应旨在生成H2和CO，而次级反应涉及甘油的完全分解，产生H2以及吸附状态下的碳原子和氧原子。
2. 在所有表面上，重整过程主要遵循H2和CO的生产，选择性范围为50-90%。
