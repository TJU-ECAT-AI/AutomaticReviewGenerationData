<p>Glycerol was found to react selectively on these surfaces in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments to form H2 and CO; no other gas-phase products were detected.</p>
<p>The absence of CO2 as a product indicated that the water gas shift reaction did not take place in these TPD experiments under ultrahigh vacuum.</p>
<p>Figure1 displays TPD spectra of H2, CO, and unconverted glycerol following exposure of 0.2L glycerol on Pt(111), Pt-Ni-Pt(111), and Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces.</p>
<p>From Pt-Ni-Pt(111), H2 desorbed from overlapping broad and weak peaks centered at 389K and 477K. Both these peaks were reaction-limited as the desorption temperature of H2 on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) is lower than that on Pt(111).</p>
<p>Overall, Pt-Ni-Pt(111) displayed decreased H2 and CO peak areas as compared to Pt(111).</p>
<p>In contrast, increased H2 and CO peak areas were observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to Pt(111).</p>
<p>The TPD results obtained for glycerol were similar to previous experiments using ethylene glycol and ethanol.</p>
<p>Comparing the TPD results, it is found that the CO desorption temperatures were similar for all three oxygenates and similar to those obtained after dosing CO on the surface.</p>
<p>The H2 and CO peak areas both increased in the order ethanol &lt; ethylene glycol &lt; glycerol.</p>
<p>The reactions of glycerol on these surfaces can be summarized by Equations(1) and (2).</p>
<p>Reforming was the primary reaction pathway on all surfaces, with selectivities of 50-90%.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have reported the first surface science studies of glycerol. Glycerol reacts on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) surfaces to form H2 and CO as the gas-phase products.</p>
<p>An increased reforming yield was observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to those on Pt(111) and Pt-Ni-Pt(111).</p>
<p>The reactivity trend of glycerol on these surfaces is similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol, with an increasing reforming yield as the dband center shifts closer to the Fermi level.</p>

The experimental techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The TPD experiments showed that glycerol reacted selectively on these surfaces to form H2 and CO, with no other gas-phase products detected. This indicates that the water gas shift reaction did not occur under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The H2 and CO desorption peaks from Pt-Ni-Pt(111) were reaction-limited, and the CO desorption temperatures were similar for all three oxygenates. The reforming yield increased on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) compared to Pt(111) and Pt-Ni-Pt(111), aligning with the trend of an increasing reforming yield as the dband center shifts closer to the Fermi level.

实验技术如温度程序脱附（TPD）被用于验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。TPD实验显示，甘油在这些表面上选择性地反应形成H2和CO，没有检测到其他气相产物。这表明，在超真空条件下水气转换反应没有发生。从Pt-Ni-Pt(111)的H2和CO脱附峰为反应限制，所有三种氧化物的CO脱附温度相似。在Ni-Pt-Pt(111)上的重整产率高于Pt(111)和Pt-Ni-Pt(111)，与dband中心向费米能级靠近时产率增加的趋势一致。
