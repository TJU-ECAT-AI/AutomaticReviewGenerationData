"Enhancing H2 and CO Production from Glycerol Using Bimetallic Surfaces"
"Through aqueous phase reforming,1 the oxygenates can be further reacted to yield H2 for use in fuel cells. Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce H2/CO mixtures that can be coupled with FischerTropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with the existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure.25"
"Glycerol was found to react selectively on these surfaces in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments to form H2 and CO; no other gas-phase products were detected."
"Comparing the TPD results, it is found that the CO desorption temperatures were similar for all three oxygenates and similar to those obtained after dosing CO on the surface. The desorption temperatures for the three oxygenates appeared to gradually increase with increasing molecular weight."
"To correlate the reforming activity with the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, the reforming yield of glycerol determined from TPD was plotted against the surface dband center (Figure3)."

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These methods measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of the atoms, which are then compared with theoretical predictions from density functional theory (DFT). The TPD experiments demonstrate that glycerol reacts selectively on the surfaces to produce H2 and CO, without any other gas-phase products detected. The CO desorption temperatures for glycerol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol are similar and comparable to those obtained after dosing CO on the surface. The desorption temperatures generally increase with the molecular weight of the oxygenates. The reforming activity of glycerol is correlated with the electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces, as evidenced by plotting the reforming yield against the surface dband center.

验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧气诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）表面分离的实验技术包括高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和Auger电子能谱（AES）。这些方法测量原子的分离动力学和激活势垒，然后与密度泛函理论（DFT）的预测进行比较。TPD实验表明，甘油在这些表面上选择性地反应以形成H2和CO，而没有检测到其他气相产物。甘油、乙二醇和乙醇的CO脱吸温度相似，且与向表面注入CO后获得的结果相当。随着氧基化合物分子量的增加，脱吸温度通常会增加。通过将甘油的重整活性与表面dband中心绘制成图，可以将甘油的重整活性与双金属表面的电子性质相关联。
