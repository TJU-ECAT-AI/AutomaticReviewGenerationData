<p>Glycerol was found to react selectively on these surfaces in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments to form H2 and CO; no other gas-phase products were detected.</p>
<p>The absence of CO2 as a product indicated that the water gas shift reaction did not take place in these TPD experiments under ultrahigh vacuum.</p>
<p>Figure1 displays TPD spectra of H2, CO, and unconverted glycerol following exposure of 0.2L glycerol on Pt(111), Pt-Ni-Pt(111), and Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces.</p>
<p>From Pt-Ni-Pt(111), H2 desorbed from overlapping broad and weak peaks centered at 389K and 477K. Both these peaks were reaction-limited as the desorption temperature of H2 on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) is lower than that on Pt(111).</p>
<p>Overall, Pt-Ni-Pt(111) displayed decreased H2 and CO peak areas as compared to Pt(111).</p>
<p>In contrast, increased H2 and CO peak areas were observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to Pt(111).</p>
<p>The TPD results obtained for glycerol were similar to previous experiments using ethylene glycol and ethanol.</p>
<p>Comparing the TPD results, it is found that the CO desorption temperatures were similar for all three oxygenates and similar to those obtained after dosing CO on the surface.</p>
<p>The H2 and CO peak areas both increased in the order ethanol &lt; ethylene glycol &lt; glycerol.</p>
<p>The reactions of glycerol on these surfaces can be summarized by Equations(1) and (2).</p>
<p>Reforming was the primary reaction pathway on all surfaces, with selectivities of 50-90%.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have reported the first surface science studies of glycerol. Glycerol reacts on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) surfaces to form H2 and CO as the gas-phase products.</p>
<p>An increased reforming yield was observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to those on Pt(111) and Pt-Ni-Pt(111).</p>
<p>The reactivity trend of glycerol on these surfaces is similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol, with an increasing reforming yield as the dband center shifts closer to the Fermi level.</p>

实验技术如温度程序脱附（TPD）被用于验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。TPD实验显示，甘油在这些表面上选择性地反应形成H2和CO，没有检测到其他气相产物。这表明，在超真空条件下水气转换反应没有发生。从Pt-Ni-Pt(111)的H2和CO脱附峰为反应限制，所有三种氧化物的CO脱附温度相似。在Ni-Pt-Pt(111)上的重整产率高于Pt(111)和Pt-Ni-Pt(111)，与dband中心向费米能级靠近时产率增加的趋势一致。

Alternative energy sources are of significant interest due to their potential to increase energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass, being widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, can contribute to energy supply without adding to CO2 emissions. Oxygenates derived from biomass can be further processed through aqueous phase reforming to generate hydrogen for fuel cells. Tuning the reforming process can also yield hydrogen and carbon monoxide mixtures suitable for coupling with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to produce liquid alkanes compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure. The current study confirms that glycerol reforming follows similar trends to smaller oxygenates, validating the use of these smaller molecules as models in catalysis and surface science studies. The CO desorption temperatures for glycerol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol were comparable, and glycerol reforming showed increasing activity as the surface dband center approached the Fermi level. Reforming was the dominant reaction pathway across all surfaces, with selectivities ranging from 50% to 90%.

"Enhancing H2 and CO Production from Glycerol Using Bimetallic Surfaces"
"Through aqueous phase reforming,1 the oxygenates can be further reacted to yield H2 for use in fuel cells. Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce H2/CO mixtures that can be coupled with FischerTropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with the existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure.25"
"Glycerol was found to react selectively on these surfaces in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments to form H2 and CO; no other gas-phase products were detected."
"Comparing the TPD results, it is found that the CO desorption temperatures were similar for all three oxygenates and similar to those obtained after dosing CO on the surface. The desorption temperatures for the three oxygenates appeared to gradually increase with increasing molecular weight."
"To correlate the reforming activity with the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, the reforming yield of glycerol determined from TPD was plotted against the surface dband center (Figure3)."

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These methods measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of the atoms, which are then compared with theoretical predictions from density functional theory (DFT). The TPD experiments demonstrate that glycerol reacts selectively on the surfaces to produce H2 and CO, without any other gas-phase products detected. The CO desorption temperatures for glycerol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol are similar and comparable to those obtained after dosing CO on the surface. The desorption temperatures generally increase with the molecular weight of the oxygenates. The reforming activity of glycerol is correlated with the electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces, as evidenced by plotting the reforming yield against the surface dband center.

验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧气诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）表面分离的实验技术包括高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和Auger电子能谱（AES）。这些方法测量原子的分离动力学和激活势垒，然后与密度泛函理论（DFT）的预测进行比较。TPD实验表明，甘油在这些表面上选择性地反应以形成H2和CO，而没有检测到其他气相产物。甘油、乙二醇和乙醇的CO脱吸温度相似，且与向表面注入CO后获得的结果相当。随着氧基化合物分子量的增加，脱吸温度通常会增加。通过将甘油的重整活性与表面dband中心绘制成图，可以将甘油的重整活性与双金属表面的电子性质相关联。

1. Glycerol undergoes selective reactions on the surfaces, producing hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) as the only gas-phase products. The desired reforming reaction aims to produce H2 and CO, while the secondary reaction involves the complete decomposition of glycerol, yielding H2 along with carbon atoms and oxygen atoms in adsorbed states.
2. The reforming process on all surfaces primarily follows the production of H2 and CO, with a selectivity range of 50-90%.
