<p>Recently, Chen and co-workers have investigated a variety of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces for acrolein hydrogenation. They recently reported the observation of propenol formation from acrolein hydrogenation in ultrahigh vacuum during temperature programmed desorption (TPD) over a Pt/Ni/Pt(111) surface. For this surface, Ni preferentially populates first subsurface layer, while Pt forms the surface layer. The subsurface Ni layer weakens the binding energy of acrolein and other adsorbates on the surface, and disfavors adsorption of acrolein in a strongly coordinated η4 configuration. (46, 47)</p>
<p>Chen and co-workers have recently extended these studies to other Pt-3d bimetallics, including Pt/Co/Pt(111). These surfaces also showed enhanced propenol production compared to Pt(111), though propenol production was higher on Pt/Ni/Pt(111) for reasons which are not currently clear. (48)</p>
<p>In an alternative approach to controlling selectivity, Hutchings and co-workers have observed that the selectivity for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol (2-buten-1-ol) can be promoted by the addition of small amounts of thiophene to a supported Cu catalyst prior to use. (49)</p>
<p>As thiophene was added in increasing amounts to the surface, the conversion of crotonaldehyde continuously dropped, but the selectivity to crotyl alcohol over butanol increased significantly before declining at large thiophene exposures. This effect was observed for a variety of sulfur-containing compounds. (50)</p>
<p>Spectroscopic techniques were used to show that sulfur modifies the electronic structure of the surface to favor tilting of the CC and CO bonds with respect to the surface plane, weakening adsorption and favoring hydrogenation. (52)</p>
<p>However, this effect of sulfur does not necessarily appear to be extendable to Pt-group catalysts. In related studies, Marshall et al. have recently shown that the modification of Pd/Al2O3 with self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiols dramatically increases the selectivity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation to butyraldehyde, suppressing the series hydrogenation to butanol. (53)</p>
<p>The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes has also been investigated over nanoparticle Au catalysts modified by indium. Mohr et al. (54) have shown that the selectivity for formation of propenol improves upon the addition of indium to the catalyst.</p>
<p>This has been attributed to the preference of In for being located on Au faces rather than edges; indium has been proposed to block the adsorption of acrolein on the less-selective faces, enabling the more-selective edges to participate in the reaction. However, recent theoretical calculations have challenged this interpretation. He et al. (55) used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore acrolein binding and hydrogenation on Au surfaces modified with In. Although their results confirmed that indium prefers to bind in the higher-coordination terrace sites, they found that CC hydrogenation occurs preferentially at edge sites.</p>
<p>Grass et al. recently observed that the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols is improved on supported Pt catalysts with larger crystallites and therefore relatively fewer edge sites, suggesting a similar structure sensitivity. (13) Moreover, the structure sensitivity associated with these reactions suggests that catalyst particles with well-defined shapes, such as those increasingly employed for other catalytic reactions, (56) (57) may be a promising approach for improving selectivity in hydrogenation of unsaturated oxygenates.</p>
<p>Brandt et al. focused on characterizing the relationship between acrolein adsorption geometry and hydrogenation selectivity on Ag(111). (58) At low coverages, acrolein was found to adsorb in a flat-lying geometry, but the CC bond was determined to tilt at high coverages, leading to higher selectivity for production of the unsaturated alcohol during temperature programmed reaction.</p>

The experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers in these experiments compare with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions for these systems. For instance, Chen and co-workers have investigated a variety of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces for acrolein hydrogenation. They observed that the subsurface Ni layer weakens the binding energy of acrolein and other adsorbates on the surface, disfavoring adsorption in a strongly coordinated η4 configuration. This effect was extended to other Pt-3d bimetallics, including Pt/Co/Pt(111), which showed enhanced propenol production compared to Pt(111).

Additionally, the selectivity for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol can be promoted by the addition of small amounts of thiophene to a supported Cu catalyst. As thiophene was added, the conversion of crotonaldehyde continuously decreased, but the selectivity to crotyl alcohol over butanol increased significantly. This effect was observed for a variety of sulfur-containing compounds. The electronic structure of the surface was modified by sulfur to favor tilting of the CC and CO bonds, weakening adsorption and favoring hydrogenation. However, this effect does not necessarily extend to Pt-group catalysts.

Indium (In) has been shown to improve the selectivity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation to butyraldehyde on Pd/Al2O3 catalysts when self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiols are used. Indium tends to bind in higher-coordination terrace sites on Au surfaces modified with In, promoting CC hydrogenation at edge sites instead of faces. This preference for edge sites over faces enhances the selectivity for unsaturated alcohols. Larger crystallites of supported Pt catalysts with fewer edge sites also improve the selectivity in hydrogenation of unsaturated oxygenates, indicating a similar structure sensitivity. 

Acrolein adsorption geometry and hydrogenation selectivity on Ag(111) were characterized by Brandt et al. At low coverages, acrolein adsorbed in a flat-lying geometry. However, the CC bond tilted at high coverages, leading to higher selectivity for the production of the unsaturated alcohol during temperature-programmed reaction.

实验技术，如HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子能谱），可以验证并量化氧诱导表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的表面层分。这些实验中测量的分层动力学和激活壁垒与DFT（密度泛函理论）预测相比较。例如，陈等人调查了各种基于Pt的双金属表面用于丙烯醛氢化。他们观察到亚表面Ni层减弱了丙烯醛和其他吸附剂在表面上的结合能，不利于形成强烈协调的η4配置。这一效果被扩展到了其他Pt-3d双金属系统，包括Pt/Co/Pt(111)，这导致了更高的丙酮醇生产。

此外，可以通过向支持的Cu催化剂中添加少量硫化物来提高丙烯醛氢化为2-丁醇的选择性。随着硫化物的添加，丙烯醛的转化率连续下降，但2-丁醇相对于丁醇的选择性显著增加。这种效应被观察到在多种含硫化合物中。通过硫化物修改表面，可以改变CC和CO键的角度，减弱吸附并促进氢化作用。然而，这种效应不一定适用于Pt族催化剂。

在Pd/Al2O3催化剂上使用自组装烷基硫醇形成的双层时，In倾向于结合在Au表面的较高协调台阶位置，促进边缘位点上的CC氢化，而不是面位点。这增强了对于不饱和醇的选择性。较大的Pt支持催化剂晶粒具有较少边缘位点，也有利于不饱和氧化合物的氢化，显示了类似的空间结构敏感性。

Brandt等人对Ag(111)上丙烯醛吸附几何和氢化选择性的表征发现，在低覆盖度下，丙烯醛以平躺的几何形状吸附。但是，在高覆盖度下，CC键会倾斜，导致在温度程序反应期间生产不饱和醇时选择性更高。
