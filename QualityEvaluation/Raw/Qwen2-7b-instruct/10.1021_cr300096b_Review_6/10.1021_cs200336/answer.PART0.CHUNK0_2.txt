[1] "The widespread interest in developing catalysts for production of renewable fuels and chemicals will continue to drive research activity toward the identification of chemoselective catalysts for highly functional oxygenates."
[2] "Studies on model catalyst surfaces have shown close general agreement with results from catalysis for reactions such as α,β-unsaturated aldehyde hydrogenation, furfural hydrogenation, and functional alcohol oxidation, as highlighted above."
[3] "Recently, such model studies have been used to successfully guide rational catalyst design for monofunctional reagents, and extension to multifunctional reagents appears possible."

Research is focused on identifying catalysts that can selectively convert highly functional oxygenates into renewable fuels and chemicals. Model surface studies have shown strong correlations with catalytic outcomes for reactions like α,β-unsaturated aldehyde hydrogenation, furfural hydrogenation, and functional alcohol oxidation. These studies can guide the rational design of catalysts for both monofunctional and multifunctional reagents.
