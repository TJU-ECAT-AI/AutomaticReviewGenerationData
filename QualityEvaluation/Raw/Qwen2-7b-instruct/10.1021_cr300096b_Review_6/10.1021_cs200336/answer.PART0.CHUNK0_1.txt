<p>Recently, Chen and co-workers have investigated a variety of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces for acrolein hydrogenation. They recently reported the observation of propenol formation from acrolein hydrogenation in ultrahigh vacuum during temperature programmed desorption (TPD) over a Pt/Ni/Pt(111) surface.</p>
<p>For this surface, Ni preferentially populates first subsurface layer, while Pt forms the surface layer. The subsurface Ni layer weakens the binding energy of acrolein and other adsorbates on the surface, and disfavors adsorption of acrolein in a strongly coordinated η4 configuration.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surface was found to be highly favorable toward adsorption of acrolein in an η4 configuration, and no propenol was produced during TPD.</p>
<p>The tendency for formation of propenol was related to the d-band center of the surface, with the Pt/Ni/Pt(111) surface having the most negative d-band center among the group Pt/Ni/Pt(111), Pt(111), and Ni/Pt(111).</p>
<p>It was also determined that the surface concentration of coadsorbed H atoms played a major role on selectivity and on the adsorbed structure of acrolein, with the H-covered Pt/Ni/Pt(111) surface preferentially stabilizing adsorption through the carbonyl.</p>
<p>Chen and co-workers have recently extended these studies to other Pt-3d bimetallics, including Pt/Co/Pt(111) and Pt/Cu/Pt(111). These surfaces also showed enhanced propenol production compared to Pt(111), though propenol production was higher on Pt/Ni/Pt(111) for reasons which are not currently clear.</p>

Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) can be utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which can then be compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions for these systems. For instance, in the case of Pt/Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the presence of Ni in the subsurface layer weakens the binding energy of acrolein and other adsorbates, influencing the adsorption geometry and selectivity towards the formation of propenol. The d-band center of the surface plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and adsorbed structure of acrolein. The surface concentration of coadsorbed H atoms also impacts the selectivity and adsorbed structure of acrolein. These findings are supported by the comparison of experimental results with DFT predictions, highlighting the effectiveness of these experimental techniques in quantifying the surface properties and their impact on catalytic activity.

实验技术如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和AES（俄歇电子能谱）可以用于验证并量化氧诱导的表面分层，特别是在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）。这些方法测量了分层动力学和活化势垒，并与DFT（密度泛函理论）预测进行了比较。例如，在Pt/Ni/Pt(111)双金属表面上，Ni在亚表面层的存在减弱了丙烯醛和其他吸附剂的结合能，影响了吸附几何形状和向丙烯醇形成的选择性。表面的d带中心在确定丙烯醛的选择性和吸附结构中起着关键作用。表面吸附的H原子的浓度也影响了丙烯醛的选择性和吸附结构。这些发现通过将实验结果与DFT预测进行比较得到了支持，突出了这些实验技术在量化表面性质及其对催化活性的影响的有效性。
