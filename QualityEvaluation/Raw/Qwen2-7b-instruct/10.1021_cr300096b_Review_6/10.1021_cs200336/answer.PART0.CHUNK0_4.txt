<p>Recent work by Loffreda et al. has challenged the assumption that the lower selectivities to unsaturated alcohols over Pt surfaces are a direct result of preferential binding and faster reaction for the olefin function. They found that the elementary CO hydrogenation step is actually more rapid, even when the molecules are bound through the CC function. (37) The CO hydrogenation reaction proceeds through a metastable precursor state for OH bond formation where the O is not directly bound to the surface, with the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde adsorbed in a state similar to that shown in Figure 1(a). This reaction involves a surface-bound H atom and an O atom that is not directly adsorbed on the surface but is in proximity because of the adsorption of the CC function. It was thus described as being intermediate behavior between Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal type adsorption and reaction. In contrast, olefin hydrogenation, which occurs through the adsorbed CC function, is purely a Langmuir-Hinshelwood process. The higher activation energy for desorption of the unsaturated alcohol product from the surface was determined as the reason for lower selectivity observed for this pathway.</p>

洛弗雷达等人最近的工作挑战了以下假设，即铂表面的较低选择性主要归因于烯烃功能的优先吸附和更快反应。他们发现，即使分子通过CC键吸附，CO氢化步骤实际上更为快速。该CO氢化反应通过OH键形成的一个中间体状态进行，其中O原子未直接吸附在表面上，而是由于CC功能的吸附而处于接近表面的状态。这描述了介于兰缪尔-亨希尔伍德和埃利-里德尔类型吸附与反应之间的中间行为。相比之下，通过吸附的CC功能发生的烯烃氢化是纯粹的兰缪尔-亨希尔伍德过程。从表面脱附不饱和醇产物的更高活化能是观察到较低选择性的原因。

<p>Chen and co-workers have investigated a variety of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces for acrolein hydrogenation. They recently reported the observation of propenol formation from acrolein hydrogenation in ultrahigh vacuum during temperature programmed desorption (TPD) over a Pt/Ni/Pt(111) surface. (45) For this surface, Ni preferentially populates first subsurface layer, while Pt forms the surface layer. The subsurface Ni layer weakens the binding energy of acrolein and other adsorbates on the surface, and disfavors adsorption of acrolein in a strongly coordinated η4 configuration. (46, 47) Adsorption of the aldehyde function was observed to become energetically competitive with (but still weaker than) the CC function for the Pt/Ni/Pt(111) surface, as shown in Figure 2.</p>

陈及其同事研究了各种基于铂的双金属表面用于丙烯醛氢化。他们最近报道，在Pt/Ni/Pt(111)表面的温度程序脱附（TPD）过程中观察到了从丙烯醛氢化产生的丙烯醇。在这个表面上，Ni优先填充第一亚表面层，而Pt形成表面层。亚表面Ni层削弱了丙烯醛和其他吸附物在表面的结合能，并不利于丙烯醛以高度协调的η4构型吸附。对于Pt/Ni/Pt(111)表面，观察到醛基功能的吸附变得与CC功能在能量上竞争（但仍弱于CC功能），如图2所示。
