The experimental techniques of HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) have been utilized to confirm and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The observed kinetics of segregation and activation barriers align closely with the predictions made through DFT (Density Functional Theory).

HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子能谱）等实验技术被用来验证并量化氧诱导的表面异构化，特别是在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，特别涉及Ni和Co等3d原子。在这些系统中观察到的异构化动力学和激活壁垒与通过DFT（密度泛函理论）做出的预测相吻合。
