<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Experimental techniques like HREELS and AES were used to examine how oxygen influences the surface segregation of buried 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, within Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The obtained segregation rates and energy barriers were contrasted with theoretical calculations derived from DFT.
