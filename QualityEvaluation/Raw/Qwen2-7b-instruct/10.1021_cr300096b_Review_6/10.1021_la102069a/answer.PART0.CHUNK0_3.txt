Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were utilized to validate and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically nickel and cobalt, within Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques allowed researchers to assess the dynamics of segregation and the energy barriers involved, which were subsequently contrasted with theoretical predictions derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT).

使用HREELS和AES这样的实验技术，研究人员验证并量化了氧诱导的表面不均匀沉积，特别是在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的3d原子（特别是镍和钴）的分布。这些技术使得研究者能够评估分离的动力学和激活势垒，并将其与基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的预测进行比较。
