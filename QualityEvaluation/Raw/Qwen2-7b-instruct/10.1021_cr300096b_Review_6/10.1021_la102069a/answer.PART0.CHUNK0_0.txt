The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems included high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers matched well with density functional theory (DFT) predictions for these systems.
