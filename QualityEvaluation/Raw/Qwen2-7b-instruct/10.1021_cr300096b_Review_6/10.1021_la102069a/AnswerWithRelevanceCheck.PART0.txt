          [1] "Adsorption and decomposition of cyclohexanone (C6H10O) on Pt(111) and the (2 × 2) and (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys were studied."
          [2] "The oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems was investigated using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."
          [3] "The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compared well with density functional theory (DFT) predictions for these systems."

          The experimental techniques of HREELS and AES were employed to study the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers matched the predictions made through DFT calculations.
