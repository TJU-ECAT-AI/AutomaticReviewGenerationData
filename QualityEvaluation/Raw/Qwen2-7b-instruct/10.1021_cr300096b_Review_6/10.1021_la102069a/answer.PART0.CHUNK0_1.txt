The experimental techniques HREELS and AES were utilized to confirm and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, within the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The observed kinetics and activation barriers for Ni and Co in this system aligned well with predictions made through DFT calculations.
