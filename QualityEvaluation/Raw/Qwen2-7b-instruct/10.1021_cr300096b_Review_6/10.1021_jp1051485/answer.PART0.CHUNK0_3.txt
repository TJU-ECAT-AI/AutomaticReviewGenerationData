[1] "The presence of Sn alloyed into the Pt(111) surface reduces the EO chemisorption bond."
[2] "At a low coverage of 0.01 ML, EO desorbs at 207 K on Pt(111), at 198 K on the (2 × 2) alloy, and at 190 K on the 3 alloy."
[3] "The HREELS peak intensities were consistent with the calculated tilt of the EO molecular plane away from the surface normal."
[4] "DFT calculations suggest that, similarly to the EO configuration with the ring intact, neighboring Sn atoms destabilize the EO metallacycle on a bridging Pt site in the form of PtOCH2CH2Pt."

1. The presence of tin (Sn) in the Pt(111) surface weakens the bond of ethylene oxide (EO) to the surface.
2. At a low coverage of 0.01 ML, EO desorbs at lower temperatures on the (2 × 2) alloy and the 3 alloy compared to pure Pt(111).
3. The intensities of the HREELS peaks were in line with the calculated orientation of the EO molecule away from the surface normal.
4. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the neighboring Sn atoms destabilize the EO metallacycle configuration on a bridging Pt site.

1. 锡（Sn）的存在削弱了乙烯氧化物（EO）与表面的结合。
2. 在0.01 ML的低覆盖度下，与纯Pt(111)相比，(2 × 2)合金和3合金上的EO在更低的温度下脱附。
3. HREELS峰的强度与计算得出的EO分子平面远离表面法线的方向一致。
4. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，相邻的Sn原子破坏了桥接Pt位点上的EO金属环配置的稳定性。
