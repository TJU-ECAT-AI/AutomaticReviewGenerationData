[1] "The presence of Sn alloyed into the Pt(111) surface reduces the EO chemisorption bond."
[2] "At a low coverage of 0.01 ML, EO desorbs at 207 K on Pt(111), at 198 K on the (2 × 2) alloy, and at 190 K on the 3 alloy."
[3] "The desorption activation energies, Edes, for EO at these low coverages are estimated to be 12.8, 12.1, and 11.6 kcal/mol on these surfaces, respectively."
[4] "The values of Edes for EO adsorbed at monolayer coverage are, notably, nearly independent of Sn concentration."
[5] "The energy separation ΔEb between levels 5a1 and 2b1 for EO in the monolayer is larger on the Pt(111) surface, ΔEb = 6.0 eV, compared to ΔEb = 5.7 on the two alloys, indicating that EO adsorbs more strongly on Pt(111) than on the alloys."

1. Alloying tin (Sn) into the platinum (Pt) surface weakens the bonding of ethylene oxide (EO) to the surface.
2. At a coverage of 0.01 ML, EO desorbs at temperatures of 207 K on pure Pt(111), 198 K on the (2 × 2) alloy, and 190 K on the 3 alloy.
3. The activation energies for desorption at these low coverages are 12.8 kcal/mol, 12.1 kcal/mol, and 11.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the three surfaces.
4. Notably, the desorption energies for EO adsorbed at monolayer coverage are almost unaffected by the concentration of Sn.
5. The energy separation between levels 5a1 and 2b1 for EO in the monolayer is greater on the Pt(111) surface (6.0 eV) compared to the two alloys (5.7 eV), indicating stronger adsorption of EO on Pt(111) than on the alloys.

1. 合金锡（Sn）进入铂（Pt）表面会减弱乙二醇（EO）的表面结合。
2. 在0.01 ML的覆盖下，EO在纯Pt(111)表面上以207 K脱附，在（2 × 2）合金上以198 K脱附，在3合金上以190 K脱附。
3. 这三种表面在低覆盖率下的脱附活化能分别为12.8 kcal/mol、12.1 kcal/mol和11.6 kcal/mol。
4. 显著地，单层吸附的EO脱附能几乎不受Sn浓度的影响。
5. 乙二醇分子在单层中与Pt(111)表面的能量分离为6.0 eV，比两种合金的值大（5.7 eV），表明EO在Pt(111)上的吸附强度大于合金表面。
