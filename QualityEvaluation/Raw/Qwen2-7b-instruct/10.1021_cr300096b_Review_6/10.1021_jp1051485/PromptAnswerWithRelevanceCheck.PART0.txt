[1] "The presence of Sn alloyed into the Pt(111) surface reduces the EO chemisorption bond."
[2] "At a low coverage of 0.01 ML, EO desorbs at 207 K on Pt(111), at 198 K on the (2 × 2) alloy, and at 190 K on the 3 alloy."
[3] "The desorption activation energies, Edes, for EO at these low coverages are estimated to be 12.8, 12.1, and 11.6 kcal/mol on these surfaces, respectively."
[4] "The values of Edes for EO adsorbed at monolayer coverage are, notably, nearly independent of Sn concentration."
[5] "The energy separation ΔEb between levels 5a1 and 2b1 for EO in the monolayer is larger on the Pt(111) surface, ΔEb = 6.0 eV, compared to ΔEb = 5.7 on the two alloys, indicating that EO adsorbs more strongly on Pt(111) than on the alloys."

1. Alloying tin (Sn) into the platinum (Pt) surface weakens the bonding of ethylene oxide (EO) to the surface.
2. At a coverage of 0.01 ML, EO desorbs at temperatures of 207 K on pure Pt(111), 198 K on the (2 × 2) alloy, and 190 K on the 3 alloy.
3. The activation energies for desorption at these low coverages are 12.8 kcal/mol, 12.1 kcal/mol, and 11.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the three surfaces.
4. Notably, the desorption energies for EO adsorbed at monolayer coverage are almost unaffected by the concentration of Sn.
5. The energy separation between levels 5a1 and 2b1 for EO in the monolayer is greater on the Pt(111) surface (6.0 eV) compared to the two alloys (5.7 eV), indicating stronger adsorption of EO on Pt(111) than on the alloys.

2. 在0.01 ML的覆盖下，EO在纯Pt(111)表面上以207 K脱附，在（2 × 2）合金上以198 K脱附，在3合金上以190 K脱附。
3. 这三种表面在低覆盖率下的脱附活化能分别为12.8 kcal/mol、12.1 kcal/mol和11.6 kcal/mol。
4. 显著地，单层吸附的EO脱附能几乎不受Sn浓度的影响。
5. 乙二醇分子在单层中与Pt(111)表面的能量分离为6.0 eV，比两种合金的值大（5.7 eV），表明EO在Pt(111)上的吸附强度大于合金表面。

<p>Our reinvestigation of this chemistry, however, has shown that EO has only a minor decomposition channel (<0.015 ML) on Pt(111) and evolves at 158207 K with a desorption energy of 9.3 to 12.8 kcal/mol.</p>
<p>The presence of Sn alloyed into the Pt(111) surface to form either of these two ordered alloys weakens the EO chemisorption bond. At a low coverage of 0.01 ML, EO desorbs at 207 K on Pt(111), at 198 K on the (2 × 2) alloy, and at 190 K on the 3 alloy. Desorption activation energies, Edes, for EO at these low coverages are estimated to be 12.8, 12.1, and 11.6 kcal/mol on these surfaces, respectively.</p>
<p>UPS spectra also indicates that alloying Sn into the Pt(111) surface reduces the bonding of EO to the surface. The energy separation ΔEb between levels 5a1 and 2b1 for EO in the monolayer is larger on the Pt(111) surface, ΔEb = 6.0 eV, compared to ΔEb = 5.7 on the two alloys, indicating that EO adsorbs more strongly on Pt(111) than on the alloys.</p>
<p>Our calculations find a higher value of 17 kcal/mol for Pt(111) and an even higher value of 21 kcal/mol for the Sn/Pt(111) alloys. The presence of Sn is predicted to destabilize the EO metallacycle on a bridging Pt site of the alloys in the form of PtOCH2CH2Pt, but makes possible a more stable metallacycle species with oxygen bonding to Sn as SnOCH2CH2Pt (Table 3, Figure 7f and 7g).</p>

Ethylene oxide (EO) adsorption on PtSn alloys shows distinct differences compared to pure Pt(111). The presence of Sn weakens the EO chemisorption bond, leading to lower desorption energies and temperatures. The desorption energies estimated for EO on the (2 × 2) and 3 alloys are 12.8 and 11.6 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to 12.8 kcal/mol on Pt(111). UPS spectra confirm that the bonding strength of EO to the surface is reduced upon alloying Sn, as indicated by larger energy separations between molecular orbitals on the alloys compared to pure Pt(111). DFT calculations predict that the presence of Sn destabilizes the EO metallacycle on Pt sites but stabilizes it when the oxygen bonds to Sn, offering a potential explanation for the observed differences in EO behavior on PtSn alloys versus pure Pt(111).

乙烯氧化物（EO）在PtSn合金上的吸附与纯Pt(111)表面表现出明显的差异。Sn的存在减弱了EO的化学吸附作用，导致较低的脱附能和温度。在（2×2）和3合金上估算的EO脱附能分别为12.8 kcal/mol和11.6 kcal/mol，而纯Pt(111)上的值为12.8 kcal/mol。UPS光谱证实了合金化Sn对表面吸附强度的影响，表现在分子轨道能量分离在合金上比纯Pt(111)时更大。DFT计算预测，Sn的存在使Pt位点上的EO金属环不稳定，但当氧键合到Sn时，稳定了金属环，可能解释了PtSn合金与纯Pt(111)表面在EO行为上的观察到的差异。
