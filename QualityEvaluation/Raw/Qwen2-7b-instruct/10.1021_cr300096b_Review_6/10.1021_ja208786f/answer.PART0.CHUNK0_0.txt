Experimental techniques such as high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers matched well with density functional theory (DFT) predictions.

使用高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和Auger电子能谱（AES）等实验技术，验证并量化了氧诱导表面分层的3d原子，特别是Ni和Co，在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的分布。测量到的分层动力学和活化势垒与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测相吻合。
