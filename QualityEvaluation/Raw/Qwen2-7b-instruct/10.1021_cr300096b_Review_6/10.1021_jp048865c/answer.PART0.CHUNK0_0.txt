[1] "The application of kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, in tandem with first-principle DFT calculations to generate the input kinetic data, provides a unique tool to screen in silico catalytic surfaces and relate systematic changes in the surface structure, composition, and atomic assemblies to changes in the catalytic activity, via changes in the rates of the underlying reaction elementary steps."
[2] "The most active surface alloy was one in which the Pt was arranged into + ensembles surrounded by Au atoms. The overall composition of this surface is Pt56.2%Au43.8%."
[3] "At Au contents equal to or greater than 50%, the turnover frequency of N2 formation drops due to decreases in the NO binding energy and NO surface coverage."
[4] "The central Pt atom in the + ensemble contains only nearest-neighbor Pt atoms and can thus uniquely take advantage of the fact that the repulsive interactions between two oxygen atoms are significantly higher than those between two NO molecules, thus allowing for the formation of NO dimers while blocking oxygen poisoning."

1. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation combined with first-principle DFT calculations serves as a powerful tool for assessing catalytic surfaces in silico, linking alterations in surface structure, composition, and atomic arrangements to changes in catalytic activity through adjustments in reaction step rates.

2. The most effective alloy surface consisted of a Pt56.2% and Au43.8% composition, arranged into + ensembles with Au atoms surrounding the Pt atoms.

3. As Au content surpasses 50%, the N2 formation turnover frequency declines due to reductions in NO binding energy and NO surface coverage.

4. The central Pt atom in the + ensemble configuration only interacts with nearest-neighbor Pt atoms, enabling the formation of NO dimers while mitigating oxygen poisoning, by taking advantage of the significantly higher repulsion between two oxygen atoms compared to two NO molecules.

1. 动力学蒙特卡罗模拟结合第一原理密度泛函理论计算，提供了一种独特的方法来在虚拟环境中筛选催化剂表面，并通过基本反应步骤速率的变化，将表面结构、组成和原子排列系统性变化与催化活性变化联系起来。

2. 最有效的合金表面由56.2%的Pt和43.8%的Au组成，这些Pt原子排列成+簇，周围环绕着Au原子。

3. 当Au含量超过50%，由于NO结合能降低和NO表面覆盖率下降，导致N2形成周转频率下降。

4. 在+簇配置中，中央Pt原子仅与相邻的Pt原子相互作用，从而能够形成NO二聚体并避免氧气中毒，利用两个氧原子之间的排斥力远大于两个NO分子之间的排斥力的独特优势。
