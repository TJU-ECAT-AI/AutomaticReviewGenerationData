[1] "Simulations of the steady-state decomposition of NO in excess molecular oxygen on PtAu(100) alloy surfaces show that increasing Au from 0 to about 44 atomic percent leads to an increase in the turnover frequency for N2 formation."
[2] "Dioxygen no longer inhibits the rate of N2 formation on the most active alloy surface. This is due to a decrease in the oxygen binding energy and thus a decrease in oxygen coverage under reaction conditions."
[3] "This results in an increase in the number of vacant sites available for NO adsorption."
[4] "The maximum in turnover frequency occurs at 44% Au for the specific atomic assembly of Pt and Au into a special Pt +-site."
[5] "This specific arrangement of atoms removes the 4-fold hollow Pt sites that are preferred for both the dissociative adsorption of NO and O2, but maintains neighboring Pt bridge sites for NO adsorption and NO coupling."
[6] "The central Pt atom in the + ensemble contains only nearest-neighbor Pt atoms and can thus uniquely take advantage of the fact that the repulsive interactions between two oxygen atoms are significantly higher than those between two NO molecules, thus allowing for the formation of NO dimers while blocking oxygen poisoning."
[7] "At Au contents equal to or greater than 50%, the turnover frequency of N2 formation drops due to decreases in the NO binding energy and NO surface coverage."
[8] "This also coincides with the disappearance of Pt bridge sites that are energetically preferred sites for NO as well as atomic oxygen."

The simulation results indicate that increasing the amount of Au from 0 to about 44% leads to an increase in the rate of NO decomposition on the PtAu(100) surface, with the highest rate observed at 44% Au. This increase is due to a decrease in the oxygen binding energy and coverage, which in turn increases the number of available sites for NO adsorption. The specific atomic arrangement of Pt and Au at 44% Au creates a unique Pt+-site that removes 4-fold hollow Pt sites, which are preferred for both NO and O2 adsorption. This arrangement maintains Pt bridge sites for NO adsorption and NO coupling, while the central Pt atom avoids oxygen poisoning by the higher repulsion between oxygen molecules compared to NO molecules. However, at higher Au contents (50% or more), the rate of NO decomposition decreases due to reduced NO binding energy and surface coverage, coinciding with the disappearance of energetically preferred Pt bridge sites for NO adsorption and NO coupling.

模拟结果显示，Au含量从0增加到大约44%，PtAu(100)表面的NO分解速率增加，最高速率出现在44% Au。这种增加是由于氧结合能和覆盖度的降低，从而增加了NO吸附位点的数量。在44% Au时，Pt和Au的特定原子排列形成一个独特的Pt+-位点，消除了优选用于NO和O2吸附的4-面空Pt位点。这种排列保留了用于NO吸附和NO耦合的Pt桥位点，而中央Pt原子通过氧气分子之间的高排斥力避免了氧气中毒，与两个NO分子相比，氧气分子之间具有更高的排斥力。然而，在Au含量更高（50%或以上）的情况下，NO分解速率会因NO结合能和表面覆盖度的减少而降低，这与消失的用于NO吸附和NO耦合的能效优选Pt桥位点相吻合。
