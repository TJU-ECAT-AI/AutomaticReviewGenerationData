[1] "The application of kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, in tandem with first-principle DFT calculations to generate the input kinetic data, provides a unique tool to screen in silico catalytic surfaces and relate systematic changes in the surface structure, composition, and atomic assemblies to changes in the catalytic activity, via changes in the rates of the underlying reaction elementary steps."
[2] "The most active surface alloy was one in which the Pt was arranged into + ensembles surrounded by Au atoms. The overall composition of this surface is Pt56.2%Au43.8%."
[3] "At Au contents equal to or greater than 50%, the turnover frequency of N2 formation drops due to decreases in the NO binding energy and NO surface coverage."
[4] "The central Pt atom in the + ensemble contains only nearest-neighbor Pt atoms and can thus uniquely take advantage of the fact that the repulsive interactions between two oxygen atoms are significantly higher than those between two NO molecules, thus allowing for the formation of NO dimers while blocking oxygen poisoning."

1. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation combined with first-principle DFT calculations serves as a powerful tool for assessing catalytic surfaces in silico, linking alterations in surface structure, composition, and atomic arrangements to changes in catalytic activity through adjustments in reaction step rates.

2. The most effective alloy surface consisted of a Pt56.2% and Au43.8% composition, arranged into + ensembles with Au atoms surrounding the Pt atoms.

<p>Simulations of the steady-state decomposition of NO in excess molecular oxygen on PtAu(100) alloy surfaces show that increasing Au from 0 to about 44 atomic percent leads to an increase in the turnover frequency for N2 formation. Dioxygen no longer inhibits the rate of N2 formation on the most active alloy surface. This is due to a decrease in the oxygen binding energy and thus a decrease in oxygen coverage under reaction conditions. This results in an increase in the number of vacant sites available for NO adsorption. The maximum in turnover frequency occurs at 44% Au for the specific atomic assembly of Pt and Au into a special Pt +-site. This specific arrangement of atoms removes the 4-fold hollow Pt sites that are preferred for both the dissociative adsorption of NO and O2, but maintains neighboring Pt bridge sites for NO adsorption and NO coupling.

The study demonstrates that increasing the atomic percentage of Au from 0 to approximately 44% leads to an increase in the turnover frequency for N2 formation during the decomposition of NO in excess molecular oxygen on PtAu(100) alloy surfaces. This increase in N2 formation is attributed to a decrease in the oxygen binding energy and, consequently, a reduction in oxygen coverage under reaction conditions. This results in more vacant sites available for NO adsorption. The maximum turnover frequency is observed at 44% Au, which allows for a specific atomic assembly of Pt and Au into a Pt+-site. This unique arrangement eliminates the 4-fold hollow Pt sites that are favored for the dissociative adsorption of NO and O2, while maintaining Pt bridge sites for NO adsorption and NO coupling. The central Pt atom in the + ensemble exclusively interacts with nearest-neighbor Pt atoms, taking advantage of the higher repulsive interactions between two oxygen atoms compared to two NO molecules, thereby facilitating NO dimer formation and preventing oxygen poisoning. When the Au content exceeds 50%, the turnover frequency for N2 formation decreases due to reductions in the NO binding energy and NO surface coverage, which correlates with the disappearance of energetically preferred Pt bridge sites for both NO and atomic oxygen.

研究结果表明，将Au的原子百分比从0增加到大约44%，在PtAu(100)合金表面的NO过量分子氧分解过程中，N2形成的速度频率会增加。这种N2形成的增加归因于氧结合能的降低和氧覆盖度的减少。这导致更多的空位可用以吸附NO。在44%的Au含量下，观察到了最大速度频率，这是由于Pt和Au以Pt+-结构形成特定的原子组装。这种独特的排列消除了被NO和O2亲合力青睐的4-面空Pt位点，同时保留了用于NO吸附和NO耦合的Pt桥位点。在+复合体中心的Pt原子仅与相邻的Pt原子相互作用，利用两个氧原子之间的更高排斥力与两个NO分子相比，从而促进NO二聚体的形成并阻止氧气中毒。当Au含量超过50%时，由于NO结合能和NO表面覆盖率的减少，N2形成的速度频率下降，这与Pt桥位点的消失相吻合，这些位点对NO和原子氧都是能量上优选的。

<p>The maximum found in NO2 production is the result of the requirement that the reaction needs both adsorbed NO and O. At lower temperatures, the surface is predominantly covered by atomic oxygen. Little NO is able to adsorb on the surface. This subsequently limits the NO2 formation rate. Increasing the temperature leads to a desorption of oxygen and thus allows NO to adsorb and react to form NO2. At temperatures greater than 715 K, the surface coverages for both NO and O drop more rapidly, thus decreasing the amount of NO2 that is formed. In addition, higher temperatures and an increased number of vacant sites significantly drive the reverse reaction where adsorbed NO2 species are converted back into adsorbed NO and atomic oxygen.</p>

The maximum in NO2 production occurs when there is an optimal balance between adsorbed NO and O on the surface. At lower temperatures, the surface is mostly covered by atomic oxygen, which limits NO adsorption and thus NO2 formation. Increasing the temperature promotes the desorption of oxygen, enabling NO to adsorb and react to form NO2. At higher temperatures, the rapid decrease in surface coverages for both NO and O reduces NO2 production. Additionally, higher temperatures and increased vacant sites accelerate the reverse reaction, converting adsorbed NO2 back into NO and atomic oxygen.

NO2生成的最大值发生在吸附的NO和O在表面之间达到最佳平衡时。在较低温度下，表面主要被原子氧覆盖，这限制了NO的吸附和NO2的形成。提高温度促进了氧的脱附，使NO能够吸附并反应形成NO2。在较高温度下，NO和O的表面覆盖率的快速减少减少了NO2的产生。此外，较高的温度和增加的空位加速了反向反应，将吸附的NO2转化为NO和原子氧。

1. The peak in NO2 production occurs when both adsorbed NO and O are required. At lower temperatures, the surface is mostly covered by atomic oxygen, limiting NO adsorption and NO2 formation. As the temperature rises, oxygen desorbs, enabling NO adsorption and reaction to form NO2. At temperatures above 715 K, the surface coverages for NO and O decrease rapidly, reducing NO2 formation. Higher temperatures and more vacant sites favor the reverse reaction, converting NO2 back into NO and atomic oxygen.

2. The simulation results offer insights into how surface parameters affect overall activity by establishing relative trends when comparing different surfaces and reaction conditions.

3. The turnover frequency (TOF) for PtAu(100) surfaces increases with Au content, peaking at 44% Au, where the TOF is 4.3 times greater than that on pure Pt(100).

4. The average binding energies for oxygen and NO on PtAu(100) surfaces are plotted against Au content under steady-state conditions.

5. The surface coverages of NO, O, and NO2 are plotted against Au content, normalized to the Pt(100) surface.

6. Snapshots of the surface adlayers for the most active Pt56.2%Au43.8%(100) and Pt(100) surfaces are compared.

7. The reaction orders for NO and O2 are determined by varying their partial pressures and rerunning simulations at 713 K.

8. The rate for NO coupling is significantly higher on the Pt56.2%Au43.8%(100) alloy surface compared to Pt(100) for NO dissociation and NOcoupling.

1. 在较低温度下，表面主要由原子氧覆盖。少量NO能够吸附在表面上，这限制了NO2的形成速率。随着温度升高，氧气脱附，使得NO可以吸附并反应形成NO2。当温度高于715 K时，NO和O的表面覆盖度迅速下降，减少了NO2的形成。更高的温度和更多的空位显著推动了NO2转化为吸附的NO和原子氧的逆反应。

2. 模拟结果提供了有关表面参数如何影响整体活性的见解，通过在不同表面和反应条件下建立相对趋势来比较不同的表面和反应条件。

3. PtAu(100)表面的平均氧和NO结合能根据Au含量在稳态反应条件下绘制。

4. NO、O和NO2的表面覆盖度被绘制为Au含量的函数，相对于Pt(100)表面进行归一化。

5. 对于最活跃的Pt56.2%Au43.8%(100)和Pt(100)表面的表面吸附层的快照进行了比较。

6. 通过改变其分压并重新运行模拟，在713 K下确定了NO和O2的反应顺序。

7. 对于NO脱附和NOcoupling，NO耦合的速率在Pt56.2%Au43.8%(100)合金表面与纯Pt(100)表面相比高出了两个数量级。

The simulation results indicate that increasing the amount of Au from 0 to about 44% leads to an increase in the rate of NO decomposition on the PtAu(100) surface, with the highest rate observed at 44% Au. This increase is due to a decrease in the oxygen binding energy and coverage, which in turn increases the number of available sites for NO adsorption. The specific atomic arrangement of Pt and Au at 44% Au creates a unique Pt+-site that removes 4-fold hollow Pt sites, which are preferred for both NO and O2 adsorption. This arrangement maintains Pt bridge sites for NO adsorption and NO coupling, while the central Pt atom avoids oxygen poisoning by the higher repulsion between oxygen molecules compared to NO molecules. However, at higher Au contents (50% or more), the rate of NO decomposition decreases due to reduced NO binding energy and surface coverage, coinciding with the disappearance of energetically preferred Pt bridge sites for NO adsorption and NO coupling.

模拟结果显示，Au含量从0增加到大约44%，PtAu(100)表面的NO分解速率增加，最高速率出现在44% Au。这种增加是由于氧结合能和覆盖度的降低，从而增加了NO吸附位点的数量。在44% Au时，Pt和Au的特定原子排列形成一个独特的Pt+-位点，消除了优选用于NO和O2吸附的4-面空Pt位点。这种排列保留了用于NO吸附和NO耦合的Pt桥位点，而中央Pt原子通过氧气分子之间的高排斥力避免了氧气中毒，与两个NO分子相比，氧气分子之间具有更高的排斥力。然而，在Au含量更高（50%或以上）的情况下，NO分解速率会因NO结合能和表面覆盖度的减少而降低，这与消失的用于NO吸附和NO耦合的能效优选Pt桥位点相吻合。
