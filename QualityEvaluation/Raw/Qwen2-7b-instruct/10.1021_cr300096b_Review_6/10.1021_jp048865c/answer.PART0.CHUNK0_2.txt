<p>The maximum found in NO2 production is the result of the requirement that the reaction needs both adsorbed NO and O. At lower temperatures, the surface is predominantly covered by atomic oxygen. Little NO is able to adsorb on the surface. This subsequently limits the NO2 formation rate. Increasing the temperature leads to a desorption of oxygen and thus allows NO to adsorb and react to form NO2. At temperatures greater than 715 K, the surface coverages for both NO and O drop more rapidly, thus decreasing the amount of NO2 that is formed. In addition, higher temperatures and an increased number of vacant sites significantly drive the reverse reaction where adsorbed NO2 species are converted back into adsorbed NO and atomic oxygen.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The maximum in NO2 production occurs when there is an optimal balance between adsorbed NO and O on the surface. At lower temperatures, the surface is mostly covered by atomic oxygen, which limits NO adsorption and thus NO2 formation. Increasing the temperature promotes the desorption of oxygen, enabling NO to adsorb and react to form NO2. At higher temperatures, the rapid decrease in surface coverages for both NO and O reduces NO2 production. Additionally, higher temperatures and increased vacant sites accelerate the reverse reaction, converting adsorbed NO2 back into NO and atomic oxygen.

NO2生成的最大值发生在吸附的NO和O在表面之间达到最佳平衡时。在较低温度下，表面主要被原子氧覆盖，这限制了NO的吸附和NO2的形成。提高温度促进了氧的脱附，使NO能够吸附并反应形成NO2。在较高温度下，NO和O的表面覆盖率的快速减少减少了NO2的产生。此外，较高的温度和增加的空位加速了反向反应，将吸附的NO2转化为NO和原子氧。
