<p>The maximum found in NO2 production is the result of the requirement that the reaction needs both adsorbed NO and O. At lower temperatures, the surface is predominantly covered by atomic oxygen. Little NO is able to adsorb on the surface. This subsequently limits the NO2 formation rate. Increasing the temperature leads to a desorption of oxygen and thus allows NO to adsorb and react to form NO2. At temperatures greater than 715 K, the surface coverages for both NO and O drop more rapidly, thus decreasing the amount of NO2 that is formed. In addition, higher temperatures and an increased number of vacant sites significantly drive the reverse reaction where adsorbed NO2 species are converted back into adsorbed NO and atomic oxygen.</p>
<p>Despite the quantitative differences, the simulation results are still very valuable since they can establish relative trends when comparing different surfaces and reaction conditions as they provide insight into the effects of these parameters on the overall activity.</p>
<p>It is clear that the TOF for PtAu(100) increases with increasing Au content in the alloy and peaks at about 44% Au with a TOF value that is 4.3 times greater than the TOF on pure Pt(100).</p>

1. The peak in NO2 production occurs when both adsorbed NO and O are required. At lower temperatures, the surface is mostly covered by atomic oxygen, limiting NO adsorption and NO2 formation. As the temperature rises, oxygen desorbs, enabling NO adsorption and reaction to form NO2. At temperatures above 715 K, the surface coverages for NO and O decrease rapidly, reducing NO2 formation. Higher temperatures and more vacant sites favor the reverse reaction, converting NO2 back into NO and atomic oxygen.

2. The simulation results offer insights into how surface parameters affect overall activity by establishing relative trends when comparing different surfaces and reaction conditions.

3. The turnover frequency (TOF) for PtAu(100) surfaces increases with Au content, peaking at 44% Au, where the TOF is 4.3 times greater than that on pure Pt(100).

4. The average binding energies for oxygen and NO on PtAu(100) surfaces are plotted against Au content under steady-state conditions.

5. The surface coverages of NO, O, and NO2 are plotted against Au content, normalized to the Pt(100) surface.

6. Snapshots of the surface adlayers for the most active Pt56.2%Au43.8%(100) and Pt(100) surfaces are compared.

7. The reaction orders for NO and O2 are determined by varying their partial pressures and rerunning simulations at 713 K.

8. The rate for NO coupling is significantly higher on the Pt56.2%Au43.8%(100) alloy surface compared to Pt(100) for NO dissociation and NOcoupling.

1. 在较低温度下，表面主要由原子氧覆盖。少量NO能够吸附在表面上，这限制了NO2的形成速率。随着温度升高，氧气脱附，使得NO可以吸附并反应形成NO2。当温度高于715 K时，NO和O的表面覆盖度迅速下降，减少了NO2的形成。更高的温度和更多的空位显著推动了NO2转化为吸附的NO和原子氧的逆反应。

2. 模拟结果提供了有关表面参数如何影响整体活性的见解，通过在不同表面和反应条件下建立相对趋势来比较不同的表面和反应条件。

3. PtAu(100)表面的平均氧和NO结合能根据Au含量在稳态反应条件下绘制。

4. NO、O和NO2的表面覆盖度被绘制为Au含量的函数，相对于Pt(100)表面进行归一化。

5. 对于最活跃的Pt56.2%Au43.8%(100)和Pt(100)表面的表面吸附层的快照进行了比较。

6. 通过改变其分压并重新运行模拟，在713 K下确定了NO和O2的反应顺序。

7. 对于NO脱附和NOcoupling，NO耦合的速率在Pt56.2%Au43.8%(100)合金表面与纯Pt(100)表面相比高出了两个数量级。
