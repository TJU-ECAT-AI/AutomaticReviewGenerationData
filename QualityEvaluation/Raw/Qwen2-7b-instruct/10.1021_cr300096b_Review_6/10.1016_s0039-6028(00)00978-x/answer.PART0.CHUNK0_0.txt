The first two layers showed a (1×1) LEED pattern as dictated by substrate Ni surface, although further deposition of Pt atoms deteriorated the spots due to the (1×1) structure significantly. It indicates that a disordered layer-by-layer growth proceeds above 2 ML thickness.

Both of the binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 level and Ni 2p3/2 level stay constant independent of Pt thickness except for small initial shift of Ni level to higher binding energy by 0.2 eV. These are in agreement with the values reported in the literature on Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 0 0).

When we assume π-coordinated ethylene molecule present on the surface, the highest-occupied 1b2u (π) and the lowest unoccupied 1b3g (π*) molecular orbital should be primarily involved in the interaction with substrate. Since the unoccupied electronic structures in this system cannot be explored in the present study, adsorbate states are only discussed in the former molecular orbital and the electronic states of the Pt overlayer shown above to measure the hybridization of molecular orbital with substrate band structure.

Before doing the experiment of temperature programmed reaction of ethylene with adsorbed hydrogen, we have measured the adsorption of hydrogen as one of adsorbates for ethylene hydrogenation. The thermal desorption spectra of H2 evolution from the Pt overlayers grown on the Ni(1 0 0) surface after hydrogen dosed below 150 K are summarized in Fig. 5.

The hydrogenation of ethylene to form ethane under UHV was also monitored with temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) after saturation of the hydrogen-preadsorbed Pt overlayers with ethylene at 1 0 0 K.

1. The layer-by-layer growth of Pt thin films on Ni(1 0 0) surface is observed up to 2 ML coverage, with a (1×1) structure changing to a disordered structure beyond this point.
2. The binding energies of Pt and Ni remain constant across Pt film thickness, except for a slight shift in the Ni level. These findings align with previous reports on Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 0 0) surfaces.
3. The π-orbital of ethylene interacts with the bottom of the Pt d-band for thicker Pt films, similar to bulk Pt(1 1 1). The 1 ML Pt overlayer exhibits a weak overlap with the adsorbate orbital due to d-band narrowing.
4. The adsorption of hydrogen on Pt thin films on Ni(1 0 0) surface shows a new desorption state at 190 K with further deposition of Pt, indicating a weakening of hydrogen-surface bonding at the first layer of Pt.
5. Ethylene hydrogenation to ethane is observed through temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS), with a significant shift in desorption temperatures correlating with the Pt film thickness and the strength of bonding.

1. Pt薄膜在Ni(1 0 0)表面上的层状生长直到2 ML覆盖率，之后（1×1）结构转变为无序结构。
2. 随着Pt薄膜厚度的变化，Pt和Ni的结合能保持不变，除了Ni能级轻微升高。这些结果与Pt(1 1 1)和Ni(1 0 0)表面的先前报告一致。
3. 在较厚的Pt薄膜中，乙烯的π轨道与Pt的d带底紧密耦合，类似于bulk Pt(1 1 1)。1 ML的Pt顶层与吸附剂轨道的重叠较弱，这是由于d带窄化。
4. 在Ni(1 0 0)表面上生长的Pt薄膜上的氢吸附显示出新的190 K脱吸附状态，随着Pt沉积量的增加，表明第一层Pt中的氢-表面键合减弱。
5. 温度程序反应光谱（TPRS）观察到乙烯氢化为乙烷，随着Pt薄膜厚度的增加以及吸附物与表面的结合强度增强，脱吸附温度发生显著变化。
