<p>It has been found that PtNi alloy single crystal surfaces show surface enrichment of one component, depending on the surface orientation; i.e., Pt enrichment at the first layer and Ni enrichment in the second layer for (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces, reverse order for (1 1 0) surface.</p>
<p>This drastic change is interpreted to be associated with the presence of Ni in the sublayer which imposed a contraction of the bond lengths between the surface Pt atoms with alloying, due to the difference between the lattice parameters of Pt (3.924 Å) and Pt0.5Ni0.5 (3.755 Å).</p>
<p>The outer layer with a quasi complete Pt layer exhibits very weakened chemisorptive properties compared to Pt(1 1 1), leading to more selective hydrogenation of butadiene toward butene.</p>
<p>For the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloy surface, the outer layer with a quasi complete Pt layer exhibits very weakened chemisorptive properties compared to Pt(1 1 1), leading to more selective hydrogenation of butadiene toward butene.</p>
<p>The 1 ML Pt overlayer, as a model (1 0 0) surface of PtNi alloy single crystal, shows a considerable d-band narrowing probably due to the formation of an interface state with the Ni substrate.</p>
<p>This greatly weakens the bonding energy of hydrogen atoms as well as ethylene molecule, thus causing the maximum evolution of ethane around 200 K.</p>
<p>In contrast, the development of a wide d-band extending to 6 eV binding energy characteristic of bulk Pt electronic states upon increasing the Pt coverage from 1 to 6 ML, leads to a similar surface chemistry of ethylene as on Pt(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>Through the examination of this model system it is evident that a high reactivity for the hydrogenation reactions is originated from the modification of the electronic structure in the topmost Pt layer of alloy.</p>

The experimental techniques utilized in the study, including XPS and LEED, helped to confirm and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The results showed that the kinetics and activation barriers for the segregation processes matched well with DFT predictions. The high reactivity for hydrogenation reactions was attributed to the modification of the electronic structure in the topmost Pt layer of the alloy, particularly due to the narrowing of the d-band in the 1 ML Pt overlayer and the development of a wide d-band extending to 6 eV binding energy upon increasing the Pt coverage from 1 to 6 ML. This led to a similar surface chemistry of ethylene as observed on the Pt(1 1 1) surface.

在研究中，使用了包括XPS和LEED在内的实验技术来验证并量化氧气诱导的表面分离现象，特别是在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的Ni和Co等子表面3d原子。结果显示，这些分离过程的速率常数和活化能与DFT预测相吻合。氢化反应的高活性归因于合金顶部最外层Pt层的电子结构的修改，特别是由于1 ML Pt覆盖层中d带的显著窄化以及Pt覆盖从1 ML增加到6 ML时形成的宽d带扩展至6 eV结合能，这导致了与Pt(1 1 1)表面类似的乙烯表面化学性质。
