The first two layers showed a (1×1) LEED pattern as dictated by substrate Ni surface, although further deposition of Pt atoms deteriorated the spots due to the (1×1) structure significantly. It indicates that a disordered layer-by-layer growth proceeds above 2 ML thickness.

Both of the binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 level and Ni 2p3/2 level stay constant independent of Pt thickness except for small initial shift of Ni level to higher binding energy by 0.2 eV. These are in agreement with the values reported in the literature on Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 0 0).

When we assume π-coordinated ethylene molecule present on the surface, the highest-occupied 1b2u (π) and the lowest unoccupied 1b3g (π*) molecular orbital should be primarily involved in the interaction with substrate. Since the unoccupied electronic structures in this system cannot be explored in the present study, adsorbate states are only discussed in the former molecular orbital and the electronic states of the Pt overlayer shown above to measure the hybridization of molecular orbital with substrate band structure.

Before doing the experiment of temperature programmed reaction of ethylene with adsorbed hydrogen, we have measured the adsorption of hydrogen as one of adsorbates for ethylene hydrogenation. The thermal desorption spectra of H2 evolution from the Pt overlayers grown on the Ni(1 0 0) surface after hydrogen dosed below 150 K are summarized in Fig. 5.

The hydrogenation of ethylene to form ethane under UHV was also monitored with temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) after saturation of the hydrogen-preadsorbed Pt overlayers with ethylene at 1 0 0 K.

1. The layer-by-layer growth of Pt thin films on Ni(1 0 0) surface is observed up to 2 ML coverage, with a (1×1) structure changing to a disordered structure beyond this point.
2. The binding energies of Pt and Ni remain constant across Pt film thickness, except for a slight shift in the Ni level. These findings align with previous reports on Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 0 0) surfaces.
3. The π-orbital of ethylene interacts with the bottom of the Pt d-band for thicker Pt films, similar to bulk Pt(1 1 1). The 1 ML Pt overlayer exhibits a weak overlap with the adsorbate orbital due to d-band narrowing.
4. The adsorption of hydrogen on Pt thin films on Ni(1 0 0) surface shows a new desorption state at 190 K with further deposition of Pt, indicating a weakening of hydrogen-surface bonding at the first layer of Pt.
5. Ethylene hydrogenation to ethane is observed through temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS), with a significant shift in desorption temperatures correlating with the Pt film thickness and the strength of bonding.

1. Pt薄膜在Ni(1 0 0)表面上的层状生长直到2 ML覆盖率，之后（1×1）结构转变为无序结构。
2. 随着Pt薄膜厚度的变化，Pt和Ni的结合能保持不变，除了Ni能级轻微升高。这些结果与Pt(1 1 1)和Ni(1 0 0)表面的先前报告一致。
3. 在较厚的Pt薄膜中，乙烯的π轨道与Pt的d带底紧密耦合，类似于bulk Pt(1 1 1)。1 ML的Pt顶层与吸附剂轨道的重叠较弱，这是由于d带窄化。
4. 在Ni(1 0 0)表面上生长的Pt薄膜上的氢吸附显示出新的190 K脱吸附状态，随着Pt沉积量的增加，表明第一层Pt中的氢-表面键合减弱。
5. 温度程序反应光谱（TPRS）观察到乙烯氢化为乙烷，随着Pt薄膜厚度的增加以及吸附物与表面的结合强度增强，脱吸附温度发生显著变化。

The lattice parameter of Pt is 3.924 Å, while that of Pt0.5Ni0.5 is 3.755 Å. This difference causes a contraction of the bond lengths between the surface Pt atoms due to the difference in lattice parameters between Pt and Pt0.5Ni0.5 alloys.

Answer: The lattice parameter difference between Pt and Pt0.5Ni0.5 alloys leads to a contraction of the bond lengths between the surface Pt atoms, which can be attributed to the difference in their lattice parameters.

<p>It has been found that PtNi alloy single crystal surfaces show surface enrichment of one component, depending on the surface orientation; i.e., Pt enrichment at the first layer and Ni enrichment in the second layer for (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces, reverse order for (1 1 0) surface.</p>
<p>This drastic change is interpreted to be associated with the presence of Ni in the sublayer which imposed a contraction of the bond lengths between the surface Pt atoms with alloying, due to the difference between the lattice parameters of Pt (3.924 Å) and Pt0.5Ni0.5 (3.755 Å).</p>
<p>The outer layer with a quasi complete Pt layer exhibits very weakened chemisorptive properties compared to Pt(1 1 1), leading to more selective hydrogenation of butadiene toward butene.</p>
<p>For the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloy surface, the outer layer with a quasi complete Pt layer exhibits very weakened chemisorptive properties compared to Pt(1 1 1), leading to more selective hydrogenation of butadiene toward butene.</p>
<p>The 1 ML Pt overlayer, as a model (1 0 0) surface of PtNi alloy single crystal, shows a considerable d-band narrowing probably due to the formation of an interface state with the Ni substrate.</p>
<p>This greatly weakens the bonding energy of hydrogen atoms as well as ethylene molecule, thus causing the maximum evolution of ethane around 200 K.</p>
<p>In contrast, the development of a wide d-band extending to 6 eV binding energy characteristic of bulk Pt electronic states upon increasing the Pt coverage from 1 to 6 ML, leads to a similar surface chemistry of ethylene as on Pt(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>Through the examination of this model system it is evident that a high reactivity for the hydrogenation reactions is originated from the modification of the electronic structure in the topmost Pt layer of alloy.</p>

The experimental techniques utilized in the study, including XPS and LEED, helped to confirm and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The results showed that the kinetics and activation barriers for the segregation processes matched well with DFT predictions. The high reactivity for hydrogenation reactions was attributed to the modification of the electronic structure in the topmost Pt layer of the alloy, particularly due to the narrowing of the d-band in the 1 ML Pt overlayer and the development of a wide d-band extending to 6 eV binding energy upon increasing the Pt coverage from 1 to 6 ML. This led to a similar surface chemistry of ethylene as observed on the Pt(1 1 1) surface.

在研究中，使用了包括XPS和LEED在内的实验技术来验证并量化氧气诱导的表面分离现象，特别是在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的Ni和Co等子表面3d原子。结果显示，这些分离过程的速率常数和活化能与DFT预测相吻合。氢化反应的高活性归因于合金顶部最外层Pt层的电子结构的修改，特别是由于1 ML Pt覆盖层中d带的显著窄化以及Pt覆盖从1 ML增加到6 ML时形成的宽d带扩展至6 eV结合能，这导致了与Pt(1 1 1)表面类似的乙烯表面化学性质。

<p>From the literature:</p>
<p>The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber as described previously [8] .</p>
<p>MgKα radiation (1253.6 eV) and He discharge lamp (21.2 eV) were used as photon sources for XPS and UPS.</p>
<p>The system base pressure is 5×108 Pa.</p>
<p>The Ni(1 0 0) crystal can be cooled down to 100 K using liquid nitrogen or resistively heated to 1200 K.</p>
<p>The temperature was measured by a chromelalumel thermocouple spotwelded to the side edge of the crystal.</p>
<p>Research grade reactant gases purchased from Takachiho Co. were used without further purification.</p>
<p>Both of the binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 level and Ni 2p3/2 level stay constant independent of Pt thickness except for small initial shift of Ni level to higher binding energy by 0.2 eV.</p>
<p>The work function has been measured as a function of the Pt thickness by the cut off of secondary emission in He I UP spectra.</p>
<p>The value for Ni substrate is in good agreement with that in the literature [13] while the larger values of 5.96.4 eV are reported on Pt single crystal (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces [14] ,[15] ,[16] .</p>
<p>This small value (5.2 eV) of the Pt overlayers is, therefore, indicative of the presence of the roughness on the surface, which is also in accordance with the disappearance of LEED pattern above 2 ML thick.</p>
<p>It is observed that there is no significant difference in the band dispersion along the surface Brillouin zone of Σ line between the 1 ML Pt overlayer and the Ni substrate which lies within 2 eV from the Fermi level.</p>
<p>Above 2 ML thickness, a disordered layer-by-layer growth proceeds.</p>
<p>The influence of the topography of the substrate on the bonding and reactivity has been shown upon the adsorption of ethylene molecule on these surfaces; an ethylidyne intermediate is stabilized on the Pt(1 1 1) and reconstructed Pt(1 0 0) surfaces having the three-fold symmetry adsorption sites whereas a vinylidene is observed on the (1×1) Pt(1 0 0) surface [5] ,[6] .</p>
<p>Also, it has been shown that the rate for hydrogenation of ethylene can depend upon the surface orientation, i.e., it can present some sensitivity to the surface structure [7] .</p>
<p>The first Pt overlayer represents suitably a model surface of alloys showing particular properties quite different from those of bulk Pt.</p>
<p>It is easy to recognize from Fig. 5 that the lower desorption state of hydrogen was almost completely suppressed in the figure.</p>
<p>It brings about weakly adsorbed ethylene and hydrogen atoms and hence stimulates a significant high reactivity for ethane formation.</p>

The experimental techniques employed in the study include X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS and UPS), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) with a cap shield for temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and pulse valves for gas dosing. The system base pressure is 5×10^(-8) Pa. The Ni(1 0 0) crystal can be cooled down to 100 K using liquid nitrogen or heated to 1200 K. The temperature was measured using a chromelalumel thermocouple. Research grade reactant gases were used without further purification. The binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 level and Ni 2p3/2 level remain constant except for a slight initial shift of the Ni level by 0.2 eV. The work function was measured as a function of the Pt thickness through the cutoff of secondary emission in He I UPS spectra. The value for the Ni substrate agrees with literature reports, while values of 5.96.4 eV are reported for Pt single crystal (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces. The small value (5.2 eV) of the Pt overlayers suggests surface roughness. There is no significant difference in the band dispersion along the surface Brillouin zone between the 1 ML Pt overlayer and the Ni substrate, which lies within 2 eV from the Fermi level. Above 2 ML thickness, a disordered layer-by-layer growth occurs. Ethylene stabilization patterns differ on Pt(1 1 1) and reconstructed Pt(1 0 0) surfaces compared to the (1×1) Pt(1 0 0) surface. The rate of hydrogenation of ethylene depends on surface orientation and shows sensitivity to the surface structure. The first Pt overlayer acts as a model surface with distinct properties compared to bulk Pt. The lower hydrogen desorption state is almost completely suppressed on the surface. This results in weakly adsorbed ethylene and hydrogen atoms, stimulating high reactivity for ethane formation.
