The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber as described previously [8] . The system is equipped with facilities for X-ray and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS and UPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED), a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) with a cap shield for temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and two pulse valves for gas dosing.
When we assume π-coordinated ethylene molecule present on the surface, the highest-occupied 1b2u (π) and the lowest unoccupied 1b3g (π*) molecular orbital should be primarily involved in the interaction with substrate.

The experimental techniques utilized in the research include X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) equipped with a cap shield for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and two pulse valves for gas dosing. These methods were employed to investigate the adsorption of ethylene and hydrogen on Pt thin films grown on Ni(1 0 0) substrate. The π-coordinated ethylene molecule's highest-occupied π orbital and the lowest unoccupied π* orbital play a crucial role in interacting with the substrate.

研究中使用的实验技术包括X射线和紫外光电子能谱（XPS和UPS）、低能电子衍射（LEED）、配备有帽罩屏蔽的四极质谱仪（QMS）用于温度程序脱附（TPD），以及两个脉冲阀用于气体注入。这些方法被用来研究在Ni(1 0 0)基底上生长的Pt薄膜上的乙烯和氢吸附。π-配位的乙烯分子的最高占据π轨道和最低未占据π*轨道在与基板相互作用时起着关键作用。
