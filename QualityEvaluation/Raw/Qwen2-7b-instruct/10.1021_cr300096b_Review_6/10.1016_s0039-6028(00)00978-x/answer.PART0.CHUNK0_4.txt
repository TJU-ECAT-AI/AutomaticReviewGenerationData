<p>From the literature:</p>
<p>The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber as described previously [8] .</p>
<p>MgKα radiation (1253.6 eV) and He discharge lamp (21.2 eV) were used as photon sources for XPS and UPS.</p>
<p>The system base pressure is 5×108 Pa.</p>
<p>The Ni(1 0 0) crystal can be cooled down to 100 K using liquid nitrogen or resistively heated to 1200 K.</p>
<p>The temperature was measured by a chromelalumel thermocouple spotwelded to the side edge of the crystal.</p>
<p>Research grade reactant gases purchased from Takachiho Co. were used without further purification.</p>
<p>Both of the binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 level and Ni 2p3/2 level stay constant independent of Pt thickness except for small initial shift of Ni level to higher binding energy by 0.2 eV.</p>
<p>The work function has been measured as a function of the Pt thickness by the cut off of secondary emission in He I UP spectra.</p>
<p>The value for Ni substrate is in good agreement with that in the literature [13] while the larger values of 5.96.4 eV are reported on Pt single crystal (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces [14] ,[15] ,[16] .</p>
<p>This small value (5.2 eV) of the Pt overlayers is, therefore, indicative of the presence of the roughness on the surface, which is also in accordance with the disappearance of LEED pattern above 2 ML thick.</p>
<p>It is observed that there is no significant difference in the band dispersion along the surface Brillouin zone of Σ line between the 1 ML Pt overlayer and the Ni substrate which lies within 2 eV from the Fermi level.</p>
<p>Above 2 ML thickness, a disordered layer-by-layer growth proceeds.</p>
<p>The influence of the topography of the substrate on the bonding and reactivity has been shown upon the adsorption of ethylene molecule on these surfaces; an ethylidyne intermediate is stabilized on the Pt(1 1 1) and reconstructed Pt(1 0 0) surfaces having the three-fold symmetry adsorption sites whereas a vinylidene is observed on the (1×1) Pt(1 0 0) surface [5] ,[6] .</p>
<p>Also, it has been shown that the rate for hydrogenation of ethylene can depend upon the surface orientation, i.e., it can present some sensitivity to the surface structure [7] .</p>
<p>The first Pt overlayer represents suitably a model surface of alloys showing particular properties quite different from those of bulk Pt.</p>
<p>It is easy to recognize from Fig. 5 that the lower desorption state of hydrogen was almost completely suppressed in the figure.</p>
<p>It brings about weakly adsorbed ethylene and hydrogen atoms and hence stimulates a significant high reactivity for ethane formation.</p>

The experimental techniques employed in the study include X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS and UPS), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) with a cap shield for temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and pulse valves for gas dosing. The system base pressure is 5×10^(-8) Pa. The Ni(1 0 0) crystal can be cooled down to 100 K using liquid nitrogen or heated to 1200 K. The temperature was measured using a chromelalumel thermocouple. Research grade reactant gases were used without further purification. The binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 level and Ni 2p3/2 level remain constant except for a slight initial shift of the Ni level by 0.2 eV. The work function was measured as a function of the Pt thickness through the cutoff of secondary emission in He I UPS spectra. The value for the Ni substrate agrees with literature reports, while values of 5.96.4 eV are reported for Pt single crystal (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces. The small value (5.2 eV) of the Pt overlayers suggests surface roughness. There is no significant difference in the band dispersion along the surface Brillouin zone between the 1 ML Pt overlayer and the Ni substrate, which lies within 2 eV from the Fermi level. Above 2 ML thickness, a disordered layer-by-layer growth occurs. Ethylene stabilization patterns differ on Pt(1 1 1) and reconstructed Pt(1 0 0) surfaces compared to the (1×1) Pt(1 0 0) surface. The rate of hydrogenation of ethylene depends on surface orientation and shows sensitivity to the surface structure. The first Pt overlayer acts as a model surface with distinct properties compared to bulk Pt. The lower hydrogen desorption state is almost completely suppressed on the surface. This results in weakly adsorbed ethylene and hydrogen atoms, stimulating high reactivity for ethane formation.
