[1] "The synergistic effect of surface and subsurface Ni species at PtNi bimetallic catalysts for CO oxidation was investigated."
[2] "Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms."
[3] "Measurements showed that the kinetics of oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems are consistent with the activation barriers predicted by DFT (Density Functional Theory)."

Experimental techniques like HREELS and AES were utilized to confirm and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The observed segregation kinetics and activation barriers matched well with DFT predictions.
