The experimental techniques used in the study to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems were high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These methods allowed for a quantitative analysis of the distribution of Ni and Co atoms both on the surface and within the subsurface area of the catalyst. The measured segregation kinetics matched well with the theoretical predictions derived from density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, the activation barriers for carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation catalyzed by these bimetallic catalysts were compared with the DFT calculations.

研究中用于验证和量化氧诱导表面相分离的次表层3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的实验技术是高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和Auger电子光谱（AES）。这些方法允许对Ni和Co原子在催化剂表面和次表层区域的分布进行定量分析。测量到的相分离动力学与从密度泛函理论（DFT）获得的理论预测很好地吻合。此外，对于由这些双金属催化剂催化的CO氧化的激活势垒也与DFT计算进行了比较。
