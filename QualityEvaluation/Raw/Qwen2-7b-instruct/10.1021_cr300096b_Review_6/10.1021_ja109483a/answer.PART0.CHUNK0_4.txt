The experimental techniques used to study the synergetic effect of surface and subsurface Ni species at PtNi bimetallic catalysts for CO oxidation included HREELS and AES. These methods were utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers were compared with DFT predictions for these systems.

研究表面和亚表面Ni物种在PtNi双金属催化剂中对CO氧化的协同效应所采用的实验技术包括HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子能谱）。这些方法被用来验证并量化由氧气诱导的表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分层。测量的分层动力学和活化势垒与这些系统的DFT（密度泛函理论）预测进行了比较。
