1. Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.
2. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers were compared with DFT predictions for these systems.
