[1] "The study employed a combination of high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to examine the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems."
[2] "These techniques enabled the researchers to quantitatively analyze the distribution of Ni and Co atoms on the surface and within the subsurface region of the catalyst."

The experimental techniques used in the study to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems were high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These methods allowed for a quantitative analysis of the distribution of Ni and Co atoms both on the surface and within the subsurface area of the catalyst. The measured segregation kinetics matched well with the theoretical predictions derived from density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, the activation barriers for carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation catalyzed by these bimetallic catalysts were compared with the DFT calculations.
