All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.03.086 In the present work, supported Pt-3d transition metals (PtM, M = Co, Ni, and Cu) bimetallic nanoparticles were treated at alternating oxidation and reduction atmospheres. The surface structure and composition were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). It has been shown that the surface structures of PtNi, as well as PtCo and PtCu bimetallic catalysts show reversible changes with the redox potential of the environmental gas. The results illustrate that the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts can be tuned via treatments in various gases.
2. Experimental
For XPS experiments, PtM bimetallic nanoparticles were deposited on highly orientated pyrolyitc graphite (HOPG) surfaces.
A two-step process was used to prepare the HOPG(0 0 0 1) surfaces, which consists of Ar+ bombardment in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) (Ar partial pressure of 4  10-6 mbar, Ar+ energy of 2 keV,ion flux of 3 mA) followed by annealing in air (500 8C, 2 min). This process produces high-density surface nanopits with monolayer depth, which act as anchoring sites for nucleation of metal nanoparticles [20]. 20 mL ethanol solution of hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl66H2O) with the concentration of 2 mmol/L was dropped onto the modified HOPG surface and then heated in vacuum at 200 8C for 2 h (denoted as Pt/HOPG). Subsequently,20 mL ethanol solution of 3d transitional metal nitrate salt with the concentration of 8 mmol/L was dropped onto the Pt/HOPG surface and dried in air. The resulted samples were denoted as PtM/HOPG.
XPS measurements were performed in a Leybold surface analysis system, which consists of a main UHV analysis chamber and a reaction cell. The Pt/HOPG and PtM/HOPG samples mounted onto a tantalum sample holder were put in the reaction cell, where the sample temperature can be ramped up to 700 8C at various gaseous atmospheres. Cycled oxidation and reduction of the Pt/HOPG and PtM/HOPG samples were performed in the reaction cell with flowing O2 and H2 gases (0.1 MPa). After each reaction, the sample was sent to the main UHV chamber for XPS analysis without exposing to air. XPS data were acquired using Mg Ka radiation (1253.6 eV) with a power of 200 W and pass energy of 50 eV. All Fig. 1.

Experimental techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. In the study, PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts were treated in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres at 300°C. Upon oxidation in O2, Ni became oxidized and formed NiO, which encapsulated the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance), both Pt and Ni stayed as metallic states. The Pt atoms segregated onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffused to the subsurface region, resulting in the formation of Pt-skin structures. The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contributed to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors were observed in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported on HOPG surfaces.

These findings support the activation barriers and kinetics of oxygen-induced surface segregation, which compare with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems. The results provide insights into the principal processes governing surface structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems under real reaction conditions.

使用实验技术，如X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和高分辨透射电子显微镜（HRTEM），验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面聚集。研究中，对含Ni、Co和Cu的Pt-3d双金属催化剂进行了交替的H2和O2气氛处理，在300°C下进行。在氧化气氛下，Ni被氧化形成NiO，该层包覆了双金属颗粒。在还原条件下（20% H2与Ar平衡），Pt和Ni均保持为金属状态。Pt原子聚集到颗粒表面，而Ni则扩散到亚表面区域，形成了Pt-壳结构。响应于O2和H2变化的可逆质量传输过程导致了PtNi纳米粒子体系表面结构和组成的振荡。在PtCu和PtCo纳米颗粒催化剂上支持HOPG表面也观察到了类似的可逆动态行为。

这些结果支持了氧气诱导表面聚集的激活壁垒和动力学，与这些系统的密度泛函理论（DFT）预测相比较。结果提供了在真实反应条件下Pt基双金属催化剂系统表面结构变化主要过程的见解。
