[1] "The as-prepared PtNi/HOPG samples were mildly reduced (20% H2 with Ar balance, 200 8C, 2 h) to decompose the precursor salts and remove any adsorbates from the catalysts."
[2] "XPS measurement shows that both Pt and Ni have been completely reduced and no more Cl and N signals were detected."
[3] "The Pt 4f peak area increases but the Ni 2p signal is significantly weakened when the oxidized catalyst has been reduced."
[4] "Furthermore, structural information of the supported PtNi particles was given through TEM investigations."
[5] "The (1 1 1) atomic planes of the PtNi alloy lattice with a d-spacing of 0.216 nm can be clearly distinguished."
[6] "Moreover, XPS experiments show that Ni stays at oxidized state after reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200 8C for 2 h but Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample has been fully reduced under the same treatment conditions."
[7] "Based on the above results and discussions, we suggest that the observed changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles should be attributed to certain surface processes at the bimetallic particles."

1. The PtNi/HOPG samples were initially reduced at 200°C for 2 hours to decompose precursor salts and eliminate adsorbates.
2. Both Pt and Ni were completely reduced during this process, as evidenced by the absence of Cl and N signals in XPS measurements.
3. The increase in Pt 4f peak area and significant weakening of Ni 2p signal occurred after reducing the oxidized catalyst.
4. TEM images provided structural details of the supported PtNi particles.
5. The (1 1 1) atomic planes of the PtNi alloy lattice, characterized by a d-spacing of 0.216 nm, were clearly visible in the images.
6. After reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200°C for 2 hours, Ni remained in the oxidized state, contrasting with the full reduction of Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample under the same conditions.
7. The changes in XPS signals from PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles were attributed to surface processes at the bimetallic particles.

1. 在200°C下进行2小时的轻微还原处理，以分解前体盐并去除催化剂上的吸附剂。
2. 使用XPS测量显示，Pt和Ni均被完全还原，未检测到Cl和N信号。
3. 在还原氧化催化剂后，Pt 4f峰面积增加，Ni 2p信号显著减弱。
4. 通过TEM图像提供了支持PtNi颗粒的结构信息。
5. 清晰地分辨出PtNi合金晶格的（1 1 1）原子平面，其d间距为0.216 nm。
6. 在200°C下使用H2进行2小时还原处理后，Ni保持在氧化状态，这与在相同条件下PtNi/HOPG样本中的Ni完全还原形成对比。
7. PtNi粒子在氧化和还原周期中的XPS信号变化被归因于双金属粒子表面过程。
