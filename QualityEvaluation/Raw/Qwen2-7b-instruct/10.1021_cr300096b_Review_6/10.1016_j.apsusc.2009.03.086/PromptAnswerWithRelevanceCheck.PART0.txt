<p>Reversible structural changes in PtNi nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results in the formation of Pt-skin structures.

These methods show that upon oxidation, Ni becomes oxidized and forms a NiO layer that encapsulates the bimetallic particles. During reduction, both Pt and Ni remain in their metallic states. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffuses to the subsurface region, leading to the formation of Pt-skin structures.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.03.086 In the present work, supported Pt-3d transition metals (PtM, M = Co, Ni, and Cu) bimetallic nanoparticles were treated at alternating oxidation and reduction atmospheres. The surface structure and composition were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). It has been shown that the surface structures of PtNi, as well as PtCo and PtCu bimetallic catalysts show reversible changes with the redox potential of the environmental gas. The results illustrate that the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts can be tuned via treatments in various gases.
2. Experimental
For XPS experiments, PtM bimetallic nanoparticles were deposited on highly orientated pyrolyitc graphite (HOPG) surfaces.
A two-step process was used to prepare the HOPG(0 0 0 1) surfaces, which consists of Ar+ bombardment in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) (Ar partial pressure of 4  10-6 mbar, Ar+ energy of 2 keV,ion flux of 3 mA) followed by annealing in air (500 8C, 2 min). This process produces high-density surface nanopits with monolayer depth, which act as anchoring sites for nucleation of metal nanoparticles [20]. 20 mL ethanol solution of hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl66H2O) with the concentration of 2 mmol/L was dropped onto the modified HOPG surface and then heated in vacuum at 200 8C for 2 h (denoted as Pt/HOPG). Subsequently,20 mL ethanol solution of 3d transitional metal nitrate salt with the concentration of 8 mmol/L was dropped onto the Pt/HOPG surface and dried in air. The resulted samples were denoted as PtM/HOPG.
XPS measurements were performed in a Leybold surface analysis system, which consists of a main UHV analysis chamber and a reaction cell. The Pt/HOPG and PtM/HOPG samples mounted onto a tantalum sample holder were put in the reaction cell, where the sample temperature can be ramped up to 700 8C at various gaseous atmospheres. Cycled oxidation and reduction of the Pt/HOPG and PtM/HOPG samples were performed in the reaction cell with flowing O2 and H2 gases (0.1 MPa). After each reaction, the sample was sent to the main UHV chamber for XPS analysis without exposing to air. XPS data were acquired using Mg Ka radiation (1253.6 eV) with a power of 200 W and pass energy of 50 eV. All Fig. 1. (a) XPS Pt 4f spectra from the PtNi/HOPG sample treated in cycled oxidation and reduction reactions, from the first cycle (O2(1) and H2(1)) to the fifth cycle (O2(5) and H2(5)); (b) XPS Ni 2p spectra from the PtNi/HOPG sample treated in the same cycled oxidation and reduction reactions as (a); (c) the dependence of the ratio of XPS Ni2p intensity to XPS Pt 4f intensity with the oxidation and reduction cycles.

Experimental techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. In the study, PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts were treated in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres at 300°C. Upon oxidation in O2, Ni became oxidized and formed NiO, which encapsulated the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance), both Pt and Ni stayed as metallic states. The Pt atoms segregated onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffused to the subsurface region, resulting in the formation of Pt-skin structures. The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contributed to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors were observed in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported on HOPG surfaces.

These findings support the activation barriers and kinetics of oxygen-induced surface segregation, which compare with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions for these systems. The results provide insights into the principal processes governing surface structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems under real reaction conditions.

这些结果支持了氧气诱导表面聚集的激活壁垒和动力学，与这些系统的密度泛函理论（DFT）预测相比较。结果提供了在真实反应条件下Pt基双金属催化剂系统表面结构变化主要过程的见解。

<p>The surface states of supported PtNi nanoparticles treated at alternating O2 and H2 atmosphere were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Reversible structural changes at the surfaces of the supported PtNi nanoparticles in response to reaction gases were observed, showing NiO-rich surface in oxidizing gases and Pt-rich surface in reducing gases. The dynamic behaviors can be attributed to two opposite gas-driven mass transport processes at bimetallic particle surfaces, including surface segregation of Pt at the bimetallic particles in H2 and encapsulation of the particles by NiO in O2.</p>
<p>The similar surface structural changes can be observed in other bimetallic catalyst systems, as exemplified in supported PtCu and PtCo nanoparticles.</p>
<p>In the present work, supported Pt-3d transition metals (PtM, M = Co, Ni, and Cu) bimetallic nanoparticles were treated at alternating oxidation and reduction atmospheres. The surface structure and composition were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).</p>

<p>After the first oxidation (O2(1) as noted in Fig. 1a and b), the main peak of XPS Pt 4f still locates at 71.2 eV, being characteristic of the metallic Pt. However, the Pt 4f spectrum becomes asymmetric with a small shoulder peak at higher binding energy (BE). Deconvolution of the spectrum results in a new small component at 72.4 eV, which is due to appearance of Pt2+. The main peak of Ni 2p3/2 is at 853.9 eV and a strong shake-up feature at 860.9 eV appears, which suggest the formation of NiO at the oxidation atmosphere.</p>
<p>Subsequent reduction in H2 (H2(1) in Fig. 1a and b) shifts the Ni 2p3/2 peak down to 852.6 eV for the metallic Ni state. The Pt 4f peak position remains unchanged but the line shape becomes narrow. On the other hand, the intensity of the Pt 4f and Ni 2p signals varies largely with the annealing treatments.</p>
<p>Considering that the cohesive energy of PtNi (5.52 eV) is similar to that of PtPt (5.77 eV), sintering of PtNi particles should behave like that of Pt particles. The above conclusion derived from supported Pt particles applies to the supported PtNi particles as well. Therefore, the oscillations in Pt and Ni XPS signals observed in the PtNi/HOPG catalysts should not be from the reversible shape changes in the PtNi nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, structural information of the supported PtNi particles was given through TEM investigations. The PtNi particles supported on CB present size ranging from 5 to 20 nm. HRTEM imaging of individual particles indicates the formation of PtNi alloy phase.</p>
<p>For comparison, a HRTEM image recorded from a Pt/CB sample shows the Pt lattice with a d-spacing of 0.228 nm. The TEM results confirmed the formation of bimetallic structure in the supported PtNi particles. Moreover, XPS experiments show that Ni stays at oxidized state after reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200 °C for 2 h but Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample has been fully reduced under the same treatment conditions.</p>
<p>Based on the above results and discussions, we suggest that the observed changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles should be attributed to certain surface processes at the bimetallic particles.</p>
<p>Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface. The surface segregation of Pt has been found in Pt-based bimetallic systems, such as PtCu, PtNi, PtFe, and PtCo.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 3d transition metals may become oxidized in the oxidative environments. Due to the low surface energy of most oxides (<1 J/m2), the formed 3d transition metal oxides tend to encapsulate Pt surfaces.</p>
<p>Based on the discussion, we suggest the following dynamic process at the PtNi nanoparticle surfaces upon the cycled oxidation and reduction treatments (Scheme 1). The treatment in H2 at 300 °C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain energy. Exposure of the PtNi nanoparticles to O2 at 300 °C, however, drives the outward diffusion of Ni to the surfaces and oxidizes Ni to NiO. Strong metal-oxide interaction and reduction in surface energy induces encapsulation of Pt with NiO overlayers.</p>

1. The study uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to observe reversible structural changes in PtNi nanoparticles treated with alternating O2 and H2 atmospheres. In oxidizing gases, the surface is rich in NiO, while in reducing gases, it is rich in Pt. These changes are attributed to gas-driven mass transport processes, including surface segregation of Pt in H2 and encapsulation of the particles by NiO in O2. Similar behavior is observed in other bimetallic catalyst systems like PtCu and PtCo nanoparticles.

2. The surface structure and composition of supported Pt-3d transition metal bimetallic nanoparticles (including PtM, where M is Co, Ni, or Cu) are studied using XPS and HRTEM. The nanoparticles are deposited on HOPG surfaces and treated with alternating oxidation and reduction atmospheres. The surface structure shows reversible changes with the redox potential of the environmental gas.

3. The results indicate that the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts can be tuned via treatments in different gases. The dynamic behavior of these catalysts is crucial for understanding and controlling their performance in various industrial reactions.

4. XPS measurements are carried out in a Leybold surface analysis system equipped with a reaction cell. The samples are exposed to various gaseous atmospheres at different temperatures, and their surface states are analyzed using XPS. The Pt 4f and Ni 2p peaks in the XPS spectra exhibit variations that correlate with the redox potential of the gases.

5. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is employed to confirm the formation of PtNi alloy phase in the supported catalysts. The TEM images reveal the size distribution of the particles and the presence of an alloy structure.

6. The results suggest that the observed changes in XPS signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles can be attributed to surface processes at the bimetallic particles. The surface segregation of Pt in H2 and the encapsulation of NiO in O2 play key roles in these dynamic changes.

7. The surface state of the bimetallic catalysts is sensitive to the redox potential of the reaction gases. The reversible behavior of the surface structure and composition indicates that the catalysts can be effectively controlled and optimized for specific applications.
