[1] "Reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres."
[2] "Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles."
[3] "Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results in the formation of Pt-skin structures."
[4] "The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems."

The experimental techniques of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were employed to observe and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. When the bimetallic catalysts were annealed in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres, Ni became oxidized and formed NiO, which encapsulated the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions, both Pt and Ni remained in their metallic states. Pt segregated onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffused to the subsurface region, leading to the formation of Pt-skin structures. These reversible mass transport processes, responding to the changes between O2 and H2 atmospheres, contributed to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at the PtNi nanoparticle systems.

使用了X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和高分辨率透射电子显微镜（HRTEM）等实验技术来观察并量化在交替H2和O2气氛下Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中3d原子，特别是Ni和Co的表面扩散行为。当双金属催化剂在H2和O2交替气氛下进行热处理时，Ni被氧化并形成NiO，该层包裹了双金属颗粒。在还原条件下，Pt和Ni保持在金属状态。Pt向颗粒表面扩散，而Ni则向亚表面区域扩散，形成了Pt-皮层结构。这些可逆的质量传输过程，响应于氧气和氢气气氛的变化，导致了PtNi纳米粒子体系表面结构和组成的振荡变化。
