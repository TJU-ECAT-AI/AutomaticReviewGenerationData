<p>The surface states of supported PtNi nanoparticles treated at alternating O2 and H2 atmosphere were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Reversible structural changes at the surfaces of the supported PtNi nanoparticles in response to reaction gases were observed, showing NiO-rich surface in oxidizing gases and Pt-rich surface in reducing gases. The dynamic behaviors can be attributed to two opposite gas-driven mass transport processes at bimetallic particle surfaces, including surface segregation of Pt at the bimetallic particles in H2 and encapsulation of the particles by NiO in O2.</p>
<p>The similar surface structural changes can be observed in other bimetallic catalyst systems, as exemplified in supported PtCu and PtCo nanoparticles.</p>
<p>In the present work, supported Pt-3d transition metals (PtM, M = Co, Ni, and Cu) bimetallic nanoparticles were treated at alternating oxidation and reduction atmospheres. The surface structure and composition were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).</p>
<p>For XPS experiments, PtM bimetallic nanoparticles were deposited on highly orientated pyrolyitc graphite (HOPG) surfaces.</p>
<p>XPS measurements were performed in a Leybold surface analysis system, which consists of a main UHV analysis chamber and a reaction cell. The Pt/HOPG and PtM/HOPG samples mounted onto a tantalum sample holder were put in the reaction cell, where the sample temperature can be ramped up to 700 °C at various gaseous atmospheres.</p>
<p>After the first oxidation (O2(1) as noted in Fig. 1a and b), the main peak of XPS Pt 4f still locates at 71.2 eV, being characteristic of the metallic Pt. However, the Pt 4f spectrum becomes asymmetric with a small shoulder peak at higher binding energy (BE). Deconvolution of the spectrum results in a new small component at 72.4 eV, which is due to appearance of Pt2+. The main peak of Ni 2p3/2 is at 853.9 eV and a strong shake-up feature at 860.9 eV appears, which suggest the formation of NiO at the oxidation atmosphere.</p>
<p>Subsequent reduction in H2 (H2(1) in Fig. 1a and b) shifts the Ni 2p3/2 peak down to 852.6 eV for the metallic Ni state. The Pt 4f peak position remains unchanged but the line shape becomes narrow. On the other hand, the intensity of the Pt 4f and Ni 2p signals varies largely with the annealing treatments.</p>
<p>Considering that the cohesive energy of PtNi (5.52 eV) is similar to that of PtPt (5.77 eV), sintering of PtNi particles should behave like that of Pt particles. The above conclusion derived from supported Pt particles applies to the supported PtNi particles as well. Therefore, the oscillations in Pt and Ni XPS signals observed in the PtNi/HOPG catalysts should not be from the reversible shape changes in the PtNi nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, structural information of the supported PtNi particles was given through TEM investigations. The PtNi particles supported on CB present size ranging from 5 to 20 nm. HRTEM imaging of individual particles indicates the formation of PtNi alloy phase.</p>
<p>For comparison, a HRTEM image recorded from a Pt/CB sample shows the Pt lattice with a d-spacing of 0.228 nm. The TEM results confirmed the formation of bimetallic structure in the supported PtNi particles. Moreover, XPS experiments show that Ni stays at oxidized state after reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200 °C for 2 h but Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample has been fully reduced under the same treatment conditions.</p>
<p>Based on the above results and discussions, we suggest that the observed changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles should be attributed to certain surface processes at the bimetallic particles.</p>
<p>Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface. The surface segregation of Pt has been found in Pt-based bimetallic systems, such as PtCu, PtNi, PtFe, and PtCo.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 3d transition metals may become oxidized in the oxidative environments. Due to the low surface energy of most oxides (<1 J/m2), the formed 3d transition metal oxides tend to encapsulate Pt surfaces.</p>
<p>Based on the discussion, we suggest the following dynamic process at the PtNi nanoparticle surfaces upon the cycled oxidation and reduction treatments (Scheme 1). The treatment in H2 at 300 °C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain energy. Exposure of the PtNi nanoparticles to O2 at 300 °C, however, drives the outward diffusion of Ni to the surfaces and oxidizes Ni to NiO. Strong metal-oxide interaction and reduction in surface energy induces encapsulation of Pt with NiO overlayers.</p>

1. The study uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to observe reversible structural changes in PtNi nanoparticles treated with alternating O2 and H2 atmospheres. In oxidizing gases, the surface is rich in NiO, while in reducing gases, it is rich in Pt. These changes are attributed to gas-driven mass transport processes, including surface segregation of Pt in H2 and encapsulation of the particles by NiO in O2. Similar behavior is observed in other bimetallic catalyst systems like PtCu and PtCo nanoparticles.
