<p>Reversible structural changes in PtNi nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results in the formation of Pt-skin structures. The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems. The similar reversible dynamic behaviors have been found in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported HOPG.</p>

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). These methods show that upon oxidation, Ni becomes oxidized and forms a NiO layer that encapsulates the bimetallic particles. During reduction, both Pt and Ni remain in their metallic states. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffuses to the subsurface region, leading to the formation of Pt-skin structures. The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between oxygen and hydrogen atmospheres contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at the PtNi nanoparticle systems. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors are observed in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG).

验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面亚层3d原子的实验技术包括X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和高分辨透射电子显微镜(HRTEM)。这些方法显示，在氧化过程中，Ni被氧化并形成一层NiO，将双金属颗粒包覆起来。在还原条件下，Pt和Ni保持在金属状态。Pt聚集到粒子表面，而Ni扩散到亚表面区域，导致形成Pt皮层结构。响应氧气和氢气气氛变化的可逆质量传输过程导致了PtNi纳米粒子系统表面结构和组成的振荡。在高度定向石墨(HOPG)支持的PtCu和PtCo纳米颗粒催化剂中也观察到了类似的可逆动态行为。
