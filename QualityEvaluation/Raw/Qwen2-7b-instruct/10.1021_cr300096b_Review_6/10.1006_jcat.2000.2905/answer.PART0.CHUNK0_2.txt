[1] "Silica-supported bimetallic PtCu and PtAu catalysts were pre- pared using bimetallic molecular cluster precursors as the metal source."
[2] "The resulting catalysts were characterized with CO chemisorption, diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed CO, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)."
[3] "When the molecular cluster precursors were used as cata- lyst precursors, small and uniform bimetallic particles with high Pt dispersions were prepared."
[4] "The DRIFTS spectrum of CO bound to the cluster-derived PtCu catalyst was exceptionally broad and indicated a large red shift in ν(CO) relative to Pt."
[5] "Despite the similarities of these fission patterns, the PtAu catalyst had greatly enhanced resistance to de- activation processes while the PtCu had no superior deactivation performance over the traditional Pt catalyst."

The experimental techniques of CO chemisorption, DRIFTS, TEM, and EDS were utilized to characterize the silica-supported bimetallic PtCu and PtAu catalysts prepared from bimetallic molecular cluster precursors. The DRIFTS spectrum of CO adsorbed to the cluster-derived PtCu catalyst exhibited a broad and significantly shifted peak compared to Pt. The PtAu catalyst demonstrated enhanced resistance to deactivation processes compared to the PtCu catalyst and traditional Pt catalysts.

使用了CO化学吸附、DRIFTS、透射电子显微镜和能量色散光谱等实验技术来表征用二金属分子簇前体制备的二氧化硅支持的二金属铂铜和铂金催化剂。吸附在簇衍生铂铜催化剂上的CO的DRIFTS光谱显示了宽广且与铂相比显著偏移的峰。铂金合金催化剂对失活过程具有增强的抵抗力，而铂铜催化剂和传统铂催化剂的失活性能没有明显优势。
