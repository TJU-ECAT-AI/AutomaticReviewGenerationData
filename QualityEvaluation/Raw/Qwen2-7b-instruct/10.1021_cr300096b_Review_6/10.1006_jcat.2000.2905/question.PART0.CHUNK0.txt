Chandler,1 Alexander B. Schabel, and Louis H. Pignolet Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455 Received August 6, 1999; revised April 25, 2000; accepted April 25, 2000 Silica-supported bimetallic PtCu and PtAu catalysts were pre- pared using bimetallic molecular cluster precursors as the metal source. The molecular precursors were adsorbed onto the sup- port from an organic solvent, dried under vacuum, calcined under flowing oxygen, and reduced with hydrogen. The resulting cata- lysts were characterized with CO chemisorption, diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed CO, trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive spec- troscopy (EDS). The new catalysts were also compared to tradi- tionally prepared Pt and PtCu catalysts (wetness impregnation or coimpregnation) that had been subjected to identical activation con- ditions. When the molecular cluster precursors were used as cata- lyst precursors, small and uniform bimetallic particles with high Pt dispersions were prepared. The DRIFTS spectrum of CO bound to the cluster-derived PtCu catalyst was exceptionally broad and indicated a large red shift in ν(CO) relative to Pt. Catalytic per- formance was evaluated with the hexane conversion reaction. Both cluster-derived catalysts showed enhanced selectivity for light hy- drocarbon production (cracking) and decreased activity for nonde- structive alkane reforming and dehydrocyclization reactions. The cluster-derived catalysts had nearly identical distributions of light hydrocarbon; these distributions indicated a propensity for inter- nal CC bond cleavage. Despite the similarities of these fission pat- terns, the PtAu catalyst had greatly enhanced resistance to de- activation processes while the PtCu had no superior deactivation performance over the traditional Pt catalyst. c 2000 Academic Press Key Words: PtAu catalysts; PtCu catalysts; n-hexane conver- sion;supportedclusters;bimetallicclusters;heterogenizedcatalysts.
INTRODUCTION
SupportedalloyscomprisedofanactivegroupVIIImetal and an inactive group Ib metal have been examined as catalysts for a wide variety of industrially important reac- tions. For example, PdAu alloys are widely used in the pro- duction of vinyl acetate (1), and the coimpregnation of Au with Pt has been shown to enhance emissions control cata- 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed.

PdCu alloys have also shown promise as selective hydrogenation catalysts, particularly for the se- lective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene in 1-butene, which is used in the production of polybutadiene and styrene butadiene synthetic rubbers (3). In addition, a carbon- supported PtCu catalyst is currently employed in a pro- cess for the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons to produce usable feedstocks from highly chlorinated waste streams (4). In more academic applications, supported Pt Au catalysts played a pivotal role in the investigation of structure sensitivity in hydrocarbon reforming reactions (59). In addition to the utilization of amorphous supports, PtCu catalysts have also been prepared and characterized within the cages of Y zeolites (1012).
Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, im- pregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13). A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic sepa- ration of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support (13). A more homogeneous al- loy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering (13). Although some techniques allow for a degree of con- trol over metal particle sizes and distribution (14), particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions. Even when overall surface com- positions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce nu- merous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst (13).
A different approach to the preparation of highly dis- persed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (partic- ularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands. Past studies in this field have largely involved the use of mono- and bimetallic carbonyl clusters as precursors; several re- views on the subject are available (1522). In most studies,molecular cluster compounds were supported on various 0021-9517/00 $35.00 Copyright c 2000 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. 186 SUPPORTED PtAu AND PtCu CATALYSTS FROM MOLECULAR PRECURSORS 187 oxide supports (e.g., silica, alumina, magnesia, or zeolites) and subsequently decarbonylated by heating under vacuum or inert atmosphere. Further studies have shown that in some cases the structure of the metal core remains sub- stantially intact after ligand removal (2325). These well- defined metal cluster catalysts have been examined with a variety of probe reactions, the results of which have impor- tant implications toward the nature of catalytic active sites (2325).
Unfortunately, there are few bimetallic PtM clusters that are ligated exclusively by CO and carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are unavailable. There are many molecu- lar PtM clusters stabilized by phosphine ligands (26, 27);however, previous studies using phosphine-stabilized Pt Au clusters as catalyst precursors indicated that that the presence of phosphine residues controls the properties of the resulting catalysts (2832). Results showed that resid- ual phosphorus efficiently poisons alkane reforming and CC bond fission reactions. At the same time, the hydro- genation and dehydrogenation activity of these catalysts is relatively unaffected by the presence of phosphorus and these catalysts are being studied as selective dehydrogena- tion catalysts (32, 33).
Clusters stabilized by other organometallic ligand sys- tems also hold promise as precursors to highly dispersed supported bimetallic catalysts. A recent study in our labo- ratory reported the preparation of PtAu catalysts derived from a bimetallic cluster ligated exclusively by acetylide lig- ands (34). Using the Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 cluster as the cata- lyst precursor yielded catalysts with well-dispersed bimetal- lic particles. There was no evidence for large-scale metal segregation, despite the bulk immiscibility of the two met- als at this ratio. Hexane conversion catalysis and charac- terization results indicated the particles prepared via this route may have unique compositions or morphologies that are unattainable via traditional impregnation routes. In the current study, we extend this research to include the anal- ogous PtCu cluster, Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8. In order to make the most meaningful comparisons possible between the cat- alysts, additional data for the Pt and cluster-derived PtAu catalysts are also reported here.
METHODS
Catalyst preparation.
The organometallic clusters Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 and Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8 were prepared from [N(C4H9)4]2[Pt(CCtBu)4] and Au(SC4H8)Cl or CuCl via literature procedures (35). Hexachloroplatinic acid, H2PtCl6 · 6H2O, was prepared from Pt metal (99.99%) according to the literature procedure (36). Cupric nitrate tetrahydrate (Cu(NO3)2 · 4H2O) was purchased from Aldrich. Davisil SiO2 (3560 mesh, BET surface area 360 m2/g, average pore diameter = 150 A) was washed with high-purity millipore distilled and deionized water to remove the fine particles and dried in vacuo at 120C for 24 h prior to use. Conventional Pt, Cu, and PtCu catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and coimpregnation of the inorganic salt precursors onto the dried silica support. Solution concentrations were adjusted to give the following catalysts with % loadings: 0.15-Pt (0.15% Pt), 0.10-Cu (0.10% Cu), and 0.15-Pt + 2Cu (0.15% Pt + 0.10% Cu). The bimetallic clusters Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8 and Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 spontaneously adsorbed onto silica from hexanes solution. The remaining solvent was decanted and the supported clusters were dried at 60C in vacuo to yield the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 (0.15% Pt, 0.10% Cu) and
0.15-Pt2Au4 (0.15% Pt, 0.30% Au) catalysts. The abbre-
viations indicate the atomic ratio of metals and are used only to refer to catalysts that have undergone the standard activation protocol (see below). The details of the general procedure have been previously reported for the support of phosphine-stabilized Pt and PtAu compounds (28, 33) and were similarly employed in this study.
Catalyst activation.
Catalyst activation, chemisorption measurements, and catalytic investigations were carried out with the use of an RXM-100 catalyst characteriza- tion system purchased from Advanced Scientific Designs, Inc. Gases were all UHP grade (99.999%) and were used without further purification. In a typical experiment, 20 500 mgofthesupportedcatalystprecursorwasloadedintoa U-shaped quartz microreactor (inside diameter = 11 mm),attached to the RXM-100 system, and heated in the pres- enceofflowinggasasdescribedbelow.WithO2flowingat10 mL/min, the temperature was ramped 10C/min to 300C,held for 2 h, and ramped 10C/min back to 30C. The sample was purged with He flowing at 100 mL/min for several min- utes and the gas was switched to H2 flowing at 20 mL/min.
The temperature was then ramped 10C/min to 200C and held there for 1 h. This is the standard activation protocol for all experiments unless specifically stated otherwise.
Chemisorption experiments.
All adsorption isotherms were measured at 21 (2)C over an equilibrium pressure range of 1080 Torr. The chemisorption protocol was as fol- lows. Following the standard activation protocol, samples were cooled 10C/min under flowing H2 to 135C and evac- uated for 1 h. The samples were then cooled to room tem- perature under high vacuum and the furnace was replaced with a water bath. The base pressure was usually below 2 × 107 Torr and was never higher than 5 × 107 Torr. A CO uptake isotherm was measured, the sample was evac- uated for 35 min, and a second CO uptake isotherm was measured. All chemisorption calculations were done us- ing Advanced Scientific Designs, Inc. software. Total CO chemisorption was determined by subtracting a physical adsorption isotherm of CO on a silica blank that had undergone identical standard activation and chemisorp- tion protocols. The irreversibly bound CO isotherm was 188

determined by subtracting the second measured CO up- take isotherm from the first. The reversibly bound CO is the difference between the total CO chemisorption and the irreversible CO chemisorption. All CO uptake values are reported from the best-fit isotherm (from ASDI software) at 80 Torr.
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS).
DRIFTS studies were conducted with a Magna 750 FTIR system (Nicolet) using a DRIFTS cell (SpectraTech) equipped with an accessory that allows in situ treatments with different gases at temperatures up to 900C. A liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector was used for data collection and OMNIC software was used for data processing. The interferograms consisted of 512 scans and thespectrawerecollectedwitha2cm1resolutionintheab- sorbance format using a KBr spectrum as the background.
The silica-supported precursors were activated with the standard activation protocol and cooled 10C/min to am- bient temperature on the RXM-100 system. The samples were finely ground with an agate mortar and pestle (im- portant) and placed into the DRIFTS cell where they were re-reduced under a flow of H2 at 200C and ambient pres- sure. After reduction, the samples were cooled under flow- ing nitrogen and a spectrum was recorded at 22C. The samples were then treated with carbon monoxide at room temperature and ambient pressure by flowing CO through the cell for 1.5 min. The cell was then flushed with nitrogen for 3 min and the spectrum of bound CO was collected. In order to best observe the peaks corresponding to bound CO, the spectrum collected before the CO treatment was subtracted from the spectrum after the CO treatment.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dis- persive spectroscopy (EDS).
Samples were prepared for TEM by crushing them with an agate mortar and pestle and dispersing about 20 mg of the powder in 2 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane by ultrasonification for 30 min. Five drops of the suspension were then dripped onto a holey car- bon grid. Samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Philips CM30 TEM equipped with an LaB6 or W filament running at 300 kV. Images were recorded on photographic film and scanned with a Microtech ScanMaker III before further analysis. Energy dispersive spectra (EDS) were recorded using an attached EDAX PV9900 energy dispersive spectrometer. Spectra were typically recorded for 200 s live time with the sam- ple tilted 30toward the detector.
Hexane conversion.
A
saturated hexane (Aldrich Chemical Co., 99+%) in hydrogen gas stream was pro- duced with a two-stage hexane bubbler apparatus through gas dispersion frits. The second stage was submerged in an ice bath to maintain a hydrogen : hexane ratio of 16 : 1 (partial pressure of hexane = 49 Torr). The gas mixture was fed directly to the RXM-100 reaction manifold where it subsequently flowed over the catalyst bed. All catalysis was conducted at 400C with weight hourly space velocity (WHSV = (g of hexane in feed) (g of Pt)1 (h)1) of hexane typically between 220 h1. Reaction products were analyzed on stream via gas chromatography using a Hewlet-Packard 5890A gas chromatograph operated with an FID detector. Product separation was achieved with a 30 ft SP-1700 coated 80/100 Chromosorb P AW packed col- umn (Supelco) operated at 85C and column head pressure of 100 psi. Products were identified by calibrating peak retention times with known hydrocarbons. The products were classified into five categories: cracking (formation of C1C5 hydrocarbons), isomerization (MPs = 2- and 3- methylpentane), hexenes, methylcyclopentane (MCP), and 1,6 cyclization (cyclohexane and benzene). Yields of prod- ucts were measured in mass percent, and were corrected for minor impurities in the hexane feed. Control experiments with 80100 mesh samples showed no measurable differ- ences in catalyst activity, thus indicating that the reaction was not limited by internal mass transfer. Blank runs with plain SiO2 showed no activity under reaction conditions.
RESULTS
A series of silica-supported platinum and PtM (M = Au or Cu) catalysts was prepared to study the effects of added metal and precursor type on catalyst activity, selectivity,and structure. All catalysts used in this study (Pt, Pt and Cu from inorganic salts, Pt and Cu from the Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8 cluster, and Pt and Au from the Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 clus- ter) contained 0.15 wt% Pt on silica. In order to make rea- sonable comparisons between the various bimetallic cat- alysts, the Pt : M atomic ratio was 0.5 for all bimetallic catalysts and activation protocols were identical for all cat- alysts. Activation conditions were chosen on the basis of temperature-programmed oxidation experiments with the supported clusters; these experiments indicated that oxida- tion of the acetylide ligands occurs primarily between 170 and 250C (34).
Transmission Electron Microscopy Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) re- sultsforthe0.15-Ptand0.15-Pt2Au4catalystshavebeenpre- viously reported and discussed in detail (34). Results from the microscopy studies of the 0.15-Pt catalyst were gener- ally consistent with CO chemisorption data as particle size measurements from TEM were similar to calculations from CO uptake measurements. The 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalysts were examined with TEM for this study, however, metal particles were not imaged, even at 300K× magnification. The pres- ence of metal on the carrier was confirmed by energy dis- persive spectroscopy (EDS), but even in the regions where Pt was detected there were no observable metal particles.

a Data from Ref. (34).In the previous TEM studies (which included the 0.15-Pt and 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalysts) particles as small as 11.5 nm were observed (34). Consequently, the metal particles on the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst must be very smallbeyond the resolution of the instrument to obtain sufficient contrast with the support to image them.
CO Chemisorption and DRIFTS of Adsorbed CO Metal availability at room temperature was measured with CO chemisorption and DRIFT spectra of adsorbed CO were recorded (Table 1, Fig. 1). The designation of ir- reversibly bound CO (see Methods section) is an arbitrary one (37) as all chemisorption is ultimately reversible (38).
Irreversibly bound CO has been designated as that which remains bound to the catalyst after 35 min of evacuation (P (14) × 107 Torr). Evacuation conditions were cho-

For the 0.15-Pt catalyst,most of the CO uptake (80%) remains after the evacu- ation step, whereas for the 0.1-Cu catalyst the majority of CO uptake (80%) is only reversibly bound.
In order to more easily compare results between the bimetallic catalysts, the values in the lower portion of Table 1 have been normalized and expressed as moles of CO per PtCu2. Consequently, the value reported for the
0.1-Cu catalyst is actually twice the true Cu dispersion. The
catalyst prepared from the Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8 cluster, 0.15- Pt2Cu4, has significantly different CO adsorption character- istics than the wetness impregnated catalysts. The total CO uptake is nearly 2 moles of CO per mole of PtCu2, which is more than double the total uptake of any of the tradi- tionally impregnated catalysts. The amount of irreversibly bound CO is also roughly double that of the 0.15-Pt or 0.15- Pt + 2Cu catalysts. The chemisorption data for this cluster derived catalyst are very similar to the data for the 0.15- Pt2Au4 catalyst (34).
It is possible that the catalyst pretreatment in the chem- isorption protocol (evacuation at 135C) may leave some hydrogen on the catalyst. The relatively low evacuation temperature was chosen because, with the cluster-derived catalysts, higher temperature evacuations caused inordi- nate losses in chemisorption. For example, evacuation of cluster-derived catalyst samples at 250C for 2 h causes the irreversible CO uptake to be less than 10% (per total Pt). Re-reduction with H2, followed by a lower tempera- ture evacuation, yields the high chemisorption values. This phenomenon is completely reproducible, it is only observed with the cluster-derived catalysts, and it was never observed with the catalysts prepared from salts. In light of the TEM data, which indicate that metal particles on these cata- lysts are very small (vide supra), it is possible that high- temperature evacuation may cause some reversible mor- phological changes to the bimetallic particles in which the platinum becomes buried in the coinage metal. In or- der to limit the effects of this phenomenon on dispersion measurements, the evacuation treatment in the chemisorp- tion protocol was chosen to be mild. The precision of the chemisorption measurements may be affected by resid- ual hydrogen; however, the good agreement between CO chemisorption and TEM particle size measurements with the 0.15-Pt catalyst (34) indicates that the protocol used here does indeed provide a reasonable estimate of platinum dispersion.
DRIFTS spectra of CO bound to the freshly activated catalysts (shown in Fig. 1) also showed significant differ- ences when the organometallic cluster was used as the metal source. CO bound to the 0.15-Pt catalyst had an adsorption band centered at roughly 2073 cm1 and CO bound to the 0.1-Cu catalyst had a very weak band at roughly 2125 cm1, in good agreement with the literature 190
CHANDLER, SCHABEL, AND PIGNOLET
(3943). The coimpregnated 0.15-Pt + 2Cu catalyst had a weak band at 2124 cm1 assigned to CO bound to Cu. It also had a PtCO adsorption at 2075 cm1 that was simi- lar in size and shape to the corresponding band observed for the 0.15-Pt catalyst. DRIFTS spectra of the cluster-derived
0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst showed a large adsorption band at
2124 cm1 resulting from CO bound to Cu. The peak as- signed to the PtCO adsorption is extremely broad and is red shifted relative to the peak from the 0.15-Pt cata- lyst. This broad peak plateaus over energies ranging from roughly 2070 to 2020 cm1.
Hexane Conversion Catalysis The hexane conversion reaction was chosen to evalu- ate the performance of the catalysts because a wide ar- ray of products can be formed (vide infra) and because platinumcopper and platinumgold alloys have been pre- viously examined for this and a variety of other hydro- carbon reactions. All experiments were carried out in a quartz micro flow reactor thermostated at 400C with a 1 : 16 hexane : H2 mixture at ambient pressure. Control ex- periments with blank silica showed no conversion of hexane under the reaction conditions. Experiments with the 0.1-Cu catalyst showed slight activity under the reaction condi- tions; however, the activity observed for 0.1-Cu was roughly 34 orders of magnitude lower than that for any of the Pt-containing catalysts. All catalyst activity measurements (Table 2) were made between 30 and 70 min on stream with

All isomerization products were methylpen- tanes (MPs); no measurable production of dimethylbutanes was ever observed. Plots of selectivity vs conversion for the catalysts in this study are shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5. For all catalysts, hexenes are the dominant product at very low conversion (<2%) and hexene selectivity rapidly drops as conversion increases.

Simulta- neously, selectivity toward cracking, isomerization, and 1,6 cyclization products increases with conversion of hexane.The 0.15-Pt catalyst is relatively unselective for any one product class under the reaction conditions. At conversions above 15%, each of the product classes (except hexenes) ranges from about 20 to 30% of the total products. The coimpregnation of Cu with Pt in the 0.15-Pt + 2Cu cata- lyst slightly increases the selectivity for cracking products while decreasing selectivity for 1,6 cyclization. The cluster- derived catalysts, on the other hand, have significantly dif- ferent selectivities than the wetness-impregnated catalysts.The 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst has greatly increased selectivity for cracking products and low selectivity for MCP, 1,6 cycliza- tion, and isomerization production.

different activities and dispersions, the rates of the cracking,1,6 cyclization, 1,5 cyclization (total MCP + MPs), and iso- merization were evaluated (34). The plots of production of a given product class vs inverse space velocity (not shown) were linear for conversions below 15%. The slopes of these lines give the specific activity of a catalyst for a class of re- action, i.e., the rate of production of a given product class in millimoles per mole of Pt per second. Specific activity data are compiled in Table 2, which includes corrections for CO chemisorption.
It is apparent from Table 2 and Figs. 2 through 5 that the use of the bimetallic clusters significantly affects the ac- tivity and selectivity for CC bond scission reactions. The distribution of CC bond fission reaction products is simi- larly affected. Figure 6 shows the molar light hydrocarbon distributions for the 0.15-Pt, 0.15-Pt2Cu4, and 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalysts at 10% conversion. The distribution of light hy- drocarbons did not change significantly at other conver- sions. The molar light hydrocarbon distribution of the 0.15- Pt catalyst indicated methane to be the dominant product,comprising slightly more than a third of the total cracking products. For the cluster-derived catalysts, propane is the predominant cracking product and the methane fraction is less than half of the 0.15-Pt catalysts methane fraction.
None of the catalysts produce significant amounts of isobu- tane or isopentane, which indicates that further reactions of the skeletal rearangement products are negligible (44).
Isobutane and isopentane are the expected hydrogenolysis products of 2- and 3-methylpentane (4446) and their pro- duction can be used as a measure of the extent of secondary reactions (44).
In order to evaluate possible differences in isomeriza- tion pathways (6, 7, 47), the ratio of 2-methylpentane to 3-methylpentane was plotted versus the conversion to 1,5 192

Com- parative evaluations of surface hydrogen were also made by plotting the ratio of MCP to 1,5 cyclization products in Fig. 8. The higher ratio observed for the cluster-derived catalysts suggests that they may be hydrogen deficient un- der the reaction conditions.
The catalysts were also tested for their resistance to deac- tivation using an initial conversion of ca. 15%. Plots for the

The addition of Cu (either via coimpregnation or via the bimetallic cluster) does not appear to have any significant effect on the deac- tivation properties of Pt in these catalysts. The use of the Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 cluster, however, yields a catalyst with greatly enhanced resistance to deactivation (34).
DISCUSSION
This study reports the preparation and characteriza- tion of a supported bimetallic PtCu catalyst from an organometallic cluster precursor. For comparison, addi- tional catalysis data for the 0.15-Pt and 0.15-Pt2Au4 cata- lysts (34) have been included. The activation conditions for all catalysts were chosen on the basis of temperature- programmed oxidation and reduction experiments with the organometallic clusters (60). These conditions are unlikely to be ideal for the wetness-impregnated catalysts. Genuine 2 The conversion to 1,5 cyclization products (methylcyclopentane and methylpentanes) was used as the abscissa (rather than total % conversion) to ensure that only the activity for this class of reaction was being exam- ined. When the same ratio is plotted against total % conversion, the high cracking activity of the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst skews the plot for this catalyst and gives a misleading representation of the data.

Data on the wetness- coimpregnated system have been included for comparison;however, the discussion will focus on the emphasis of this research, namely, the examination of the cluster-derived catalysts.
CO Chemisorption and Transmission Electron Microscopy Carbon monoxide chemisorption data for the 0.15-Pt and
0.15-Pt2Au4 catalysts can be found in Ref. (34). Briefly, for
the 0.15-Pt catalyst, the CO chemisorption and transmis- sion electron microscopy (TEM) data were in good general agreement for the determination of Pt particle size. Charac- terization data for the 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst indicated highly dispersed bimetallic particles with high Pt dispersion. Parti- cle size distributions for this catalyst were narrow with 90% of the observed particles being smaller than 3.5 nm.

SUPPORTED PtAu AND PtCu CATALYSTS FROM MOLECULAR PRECURSORS 193 particles are present on the support. In order to more easily compare chemisorption data, the data in Table 1 have been normalized to moles CO per mole of PtCu2 (the atomic ra- tio for the bimetallic catalysts). The large total CO uptakes found for the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst indicate excellent metal dispersions after the standard activation protocol. Using the irreversible CO uptake as an estimate of Pt availability,the chemisorption data suggest that nearly all of the Pt de- posited from the clusters is available for binding of CO. In addition, the large reversible uptake of CO by this catalyst indicates Cu is also highly dispersed when the cluster is used as the catalyst precursor. These results are consistent with results for the analogous PtAu cluster-derived catalysts,in which high total CO uptakes were measured (>1 CO per Pt) and a similar value for irreversibly bound CO was found (34).
Attempts were made to directly evaluate metal particle size for the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalysts with TEM. At 300K× magnification, metal particles were too small to image,even on the thinnest sections of the support. Energy dis- persive spectroscopy confirmed the presence of both met- als in regions where particles could not be imaged. Mi- croscopy experiments were performed on fresh samples as well as samples that had been used for other experi- ments (CO chemisorption, DRIFTS, catalysis). In the pre- vious study using analogous 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalysts (34), par- ticles as small as 1.5 nm were consistently imaged, which suggests that the vast majority of the metal particles on the
0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst are smaller than this value.
DRIFTS of Adsorbed CO Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS) spectra for the Pt containing catalysts areshowninFig.1.TheDRIFTSspectraofCOboundtothe catalyst surfaces are in good agreement with other reports ofPt/silicacatalysts(3941).Thevalueofν(CO)observed for the 0.15-Pt catalyst (2073 cm1) is consistent with CO linearly adsorbed on Pt (50). Bridging carbonyls were not detected for any of the catalysts in this study, the absence of which has been previously reported for Pt/silica cata- lysts (39, 40). The absorbed CO stretching frequency for the 0.15-Pt + 2Cu catalyst (2075 cm1) is not significantly different and is also consistent with CO linearly adsorbed on Pt.
There are significant differences between the DRIFTS spectra recorded for the cluster-derived catalyst and the traditionally prepared catalysts. The large adsorption band at 2124 cm1 is consistent with the large total and reversible CO uptakes measured in chemisorption experiments; the majority of the reversible chemisorption is due to CO weakly adsorbed on Cu (42, 43, 51). Although this CO stretch is relatively high in energy for CO bound to Cu0 (51), it is entirely consistent with IR spectra of CO bound to reduced copper in supported PtCu alloys (42, 43). The broad band ranging from roughly 2070 to 2020 cm1 is con- sistent with previous reports of CO bound to Pt in sup- ported PtCu alloys (42, 43). Interpretation of this broad peak is difficult in light of the chemisorption and TEM re- sults, which indicate the presence of very small bimetallic particles. One possibility is that two overlapping peaks are present, one due to CO linearly bound to Pt and a lower en- ergy stretch arising from a bridging or semibridging mode between Pt and Cu. Previous studies with supported PtCu alloys have reported similar broadening and shifts in the PtCO peak with adsorption on Cu sites (42, 43). Further spectroscopic characterization of these catalysts, including carbon monoxide coverage studies (52), supports this pos- sibility.
It is not appropriate to comment on possible electronic or geometric effects of Cu on Pt based on the DRIFTS data. However, previous studies with a wide range of sup- ported PtCu alloys did not observe measurable electronic effects (43). Carbon monoxide coverage studies with the
0.15-Pt2Cu4 and 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalysts (52) also indicate that
traditional alloy electronic effects are not important for the cluster-derived catalysts. For the cluster-derived catalysts,particle size effects are also expected to be important and could have significant influences on the DRIFTS spectrum of this catalyst (37). Regardless of the individual causes of the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalysts spectroscopic characteristics, it is clear that the catalyst obtained using the bimetallic cluster as the metal source is distinctly different from the catalyst prepared via traditional coimpregnation.
Hexane Conversion Catalysis Light hydrocarbon production.
Selectivity vs conver- sion profiles for the catalysts are found in Figs. 2, 3, 4, and
5. The initial production of olefins followed by a rapid de-
crease in hexene selectivity is consistent with a rapid equi- librium in which olefin production is under thermodynamic control (53). The measured olefin concentrations are con- sistent with this conclusion and with calculations based on the reaction conditions (400C, H2 : hexane = 16) (33). It is apparent that the cluster-derived catalysts favor produc- tion of light hydrocarbons over skeletal rearrangements.
The turnover frequency (TOF) data in Table 2 indicate that the increased selectivity for light hydrocarbon production is due to both the enhancement of CC bond fission reactions and to slower rates of MCP, methylpentane, and benzene production (relative to the traditional Pt catalyst).
Light hydrocarbon production over the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 cata- lyst is more than double that of any other catalysts in this study. The increase in activity for CC bond fission upon the alloying of Cu with Pt has been well documented (5458).
One study in particular attempted to establish the role of Cu in hydrogenolysis reactions for several Cu-containing alloys (59). The authors suggested that Cu atoms do indeed play a role in increasing rates of hydrogenolysis (in contrast 194
CHANDLER, SCHABEL, AND PIGNOLET
to Au and Ag which decrease hydrogenolysis rates), possi- bly by participating in the binding of hydrocarbon interme- diates via a mixed ensemble. The broad PtCO peak in the DRIFTS spectrum of CO adsorbed on the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst could possibly be evidence for such a binding mo- tif (60). Previous investigations have also suggested that the individuality of the [active] transition metal atoms is possibly preserved in the alloys (59). Results with the
0.15-Pt2Cu4 and 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalysts are consistent with
this observation, as there are no significant differences in the light hydrocarbon distributions of these two catalysts (vide infra).
For the 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst, the total production of light hydrocarbons is not significantly faster than over 0.15-Pt;however, hydrogenolysis reactions are indeed slower. The term hydrogenolysis is often used in several slightly dif- ferent ways. We specifically refer to hydrogenolysis reac- tions as terminal CC bond fission reactions and use the term nonhydrogenolytic cracking to describe internal CC bond cleavage. This is an important distinction as the two processes may involve different mechanisms with very dif- ferent binding motifs and surface intermediates. Because nonhydrogenolytic cracking involves internal bond cleav- age, the hydrocarbon must be bound in a fashion that is more parallel to the catalyst surface. Conversely, we inter- pret hydrogenolysis reactions to involve an end-on bind- ing motif for the hydrocarbon. Notably, both processes can produce methane, but only nonhydrogenolytic cracking can produce two fragments that are both C2 or greater. Using these definitions to interpret the light hydrocarbon distri- butions in Fig. 6, the cluster-derived catalysts clearly have lower hydrogenolysis activities than the traditionally pre- pared catalysts, even though the overall cracking activity (total light hydrocarbon production) may be greater.
This is an important distinction. First, hydrogenolysis re- actions are known to be very structure sensitive (6, 8, 13,53). The distribution data from 0.15-Pt (large methane frac- tion) suggest that hydrogenolytic cracking is the dominant CCbondfissionmechanism.Further,theasymmetryofthe distribution indicates that individual substrate molecules undergo successive hydrogenolytic cracking steps on the metal particles (34), i.e., a single hexane molecule may be converted to more than one methane and a C4 or smaller fragment without desorbing from the metal particle. The symmetry of the cluster-derived catalysts light hydrocar- bon distributions indicates that that hydrogenolytic crack- ing mechanisms have little or no influence on the overall crackingactivity.Becausethecharacterizationdataindicate that both catalysts have small and bimetallic particles, these results are entirely consistent with the well-known sym- pathetic structure sensitivity of hydrogenolysis reactions (8, 13).
This distinction is also important in light of the very low selectivity for benzene formation and the literature regard- ing highly dispersed platinum on alkaline supports. The discovery of high aromatization activity during using very highly dispersed platinum on nonacidic L-zeolite (61) or on amorphous magnesia (62, 63) has sparked a renaissance in research on alkane conversion over supported Pt cat- alysts. Further studies with several catalysts comprised of platinum on an alkaline support reveal that the correla- tions initially reported for Pt/KL-zeolite hold for the other supports; namely, that increased benzene selectivity corre- lates with (i) increased support basicity, (ii) decreased CO stretching frequencies of carbon monoxide adsorbed to the metal surface, and (iii) increased propensity for terminal hydrogenolysis (44). Comparisons between our results and these studies are tenuous because of the large differences in alkalinity between silica and magnesia or KL-zeolite. At the same time, results with the cluster-derived catalysts are generally consistent with the catalysis results with Pt on al- kaline supports: the cluster-derived catalysts favor internal over terminal CC bond fission and aromatization activity is suppressed.
Mechanisms of alkane reforming.
We believe that the catalysis results with the cluster-derived catalysts are most appropriately understood in terms of the traditional mech- anisms of alkane reforming over silica- and alumina- supported Pt catalysts. Before examining the possible re- action mechanisms at work, the thermodynamics of the reaction system should be considered. The five structural isomers of hexane are essentially thermoneutral and are significantly more stable at ambient temperatures than are cycloalkanes or benzene (47). Methylcyclopentane (MCP) formation is favorable at temperatures above 323C and benzene formation is even more so. Cyclohexane is ther- modynamically unstable above 223C due to the stability of benzene (47) and only a small concentration of olefins (at equilibrium) can coexist with paraffins in excess hydro- gen at temperatures below about 500C (6). Despite the loss of dihydrogen, cyclization reactions are entropically unfavorable. From n-hexane, C5 cyclization costs roughly 16 entropy units (eu); cyclohexane and benzene formation correspond to a loss of about 25 and 3845 eu, respectively (47). These entropy losses are comparable to calculated en- tropies of adsorption (64), which suggests that one of the major roles of the catalyst is to adsorb the substrate in a geometry favorable for cyclization (47).
The mechanisms of metal-catalyzed hydrocarbon reac- tions have been inferred from a wide variety of reaction studies, which have proven to be particularly useful in pro- viding insight to the substrate binding motifs over various metals (6, 7, 13, 37, 47, 53, 6466). These proposed mecha- nisms were largely developed over supported metal and al- loy catalysts using nonacidic and nonalkaline supports, i.e.,silicas and aluminas rather than alkaline zeolites or mag- nesia. Particularly for isomerization reactions, individual SUPPORTED PtAu AND PtCu CATALYSTS FROM MOLECULAR PRECURSORS 195 mechanisms can differ from one hydrocarbon to another and are greatly affected by particle size, ensemble sizes,crystallographic orientation of the exposed metal surface,and acidity/alkalinity of the support. Surface hydrogen ef- fects also play an important role in determining the relative rates of competing reactions (hence the amounts of the var- ious products) without directly altering the mechanisms at work (47, 53).
Because benzene is a deep thermodynamic sink for the C6 system, it has been inferred that direct ring enlarge- ment reactions to form cyclohexane from MCP are not catalyzed by metals (47, 53). It is then assumed that there are two general types of surface intermediates available.
One yields methylcyclopentane and isomers while the other yields benzene; interconversion between the two types of intermediates must be strongly inhibited (47). The surface intermediate(s) for benzene production over metals has been proposed to be a deeply dehydrogenated (polyun- saturated) open-chain molecule such as a bound diene or triene (67). This suggests that, over metals, aromatization reactions are more closely related to dehydrogenation re- actions than they are to cyclizations.
The reaction network displayed in Fig. 10 indicates that n-hexane, methylpentances, and methylcyclopentane are all related through a single interconversion step. Two gen- eral mechanisms have been proposed for the isomeriza- tion of hydrocarbons by metal catalysts. The bond shift mechanism is the more general mechanism in that it has been shown to be viable on a wide variety of metals (7, 8,13, 47). The proposed surface intermediates are essentially built around a cyclopropane-like structure. An important mechanistic consideration that arises from the bond shift mechanism is that all of the possible C6H14 isomers can be produced from hexane. Most notably, through two succes- sive cyclization steps, 1,1- and 1,2-dimethyl butane can be produced.
For Pt, Pd, Ir, and Rh, an additional isomerization path- way is available. With hexane and larger hydrocarbons, iso- merization can occur by cyclization of the alkane to a substi-

C5 cyclizations (the cyclic mecha- nism) require additional hydrogen and are accelerated by increased hydrogen pressures (47), despite the net produc- tion of hydrogen by the reaction. Further, C5 cyclic isomer- ization can occur over large ensembles or at sites where the substrate binds to a single metal atom (47, 68). For some of the proposed intermediates, a dual site mechanism has been proposed in which the intermediate lies parallel to the metal surface (68).
Alkane reforming over cluster-derived catalysts.
Al- though the relative contributions of the two mechanisms cannot be definitively evaluated without proper labeling studies (65, 69), the results with the catalysts in this study are generally consistent with the cyclic mechanism. The maximum in MCP selectivity (with conversion) is strong evidence that MCP is the primary skeletal rearrangement product and that the methylpentanes are formed subse- quent to the production of MCP. The dominance of the cyclic mechanism is also supported by the lack of produc- tionofdimethylbutanes.Ifthebondshiftmechanismsignifi- cantly contributed to the production of isomerization prod- ucts, considerable amounts of dimethylbutanes should be observed at higher conversions. Because the reaction con- ditions include hydrogen pressures 16 times greater than that of hexane, the dominance of the cyclic mechanism is not surprising as reactions via this mechanism are acceler- ated by higher hydrogen pressures (47). Further, the MCP surface intermediate is known to be present in reactions over PtAu and PtCu alloys (8). The small Pt ensembles throughout these alloys have been suggested to better ac- comodate the five-member cyclic intermediate (8).
Measurement of the rate of MCP production in the same manner as was used for the other product classes was not possible because plots of MCP fraction vs inverse space velocity were not linear. This is consistent with the selectiv- ity vs conversion profiles and the dominance of the cyclic mechanism. Therefore, the sum of MCP + MPs was used to estimate the rate of 1,5 cyclization and is included as one of the specific activities in Table 2. Total conversion to 1,5 cyclization products was also used in examining the 2-methylpentane to 3-methylpentane ratio as described be- low. In doing this, several assumptions were made based this mechanism: (i) the bond shift mechanism does not ap- preciably account for the production of 2-MP and 3-MP (6); (ii) ring enlargement, i.e., conversion of MCP to cyclo- hexane or benzene, is not a viable reaction pathway (70);and (iii) further reaction of MCP or methylpentanes (i.e.,cracking) does not appreciably occur. The last assumption is supported by the lack of significant isopentane or isobutane production (4446).
The ratio of 2-MP to 3-MP selectivity (Fig. 7) indi- cates that the isomerization pathway differs slightly on the 196

FIG. 11.
Relationships between C6H14 isomers and the C5 cyclic in- termediate. various catalysts. Figure 11 shows how cleaving the different CC bonds of an adsorbed C5 cyclic intermediate (MCP) can lead to the production of the available hexane isomers.
Cleavage between the tertiary carbon and an α carbon yields hexane (no observed reaction), cleavage between an α and a β carbon yields 2-MP, and cleavage between the two β carbons yields 3-MP . For 0.15-Pt, the 2-MP/3-MP ratio is always close to the statistical value of 2, as is expected for nonselective isomerization by Pt particles (13).
Essentially, once the five-member ring is formed on the Pt particle, it has a roughly equal chance of being cleaved at any of the bonds. The cluster-derived catalysts, particularly
0.15-Pt2Cu4, show greater proportions of 2-MP at low con-
versions; i.e., the α-β carbon bonds are preferentially bro- ken. The 1,5 cyclization necessarily occurs between atoms that become the tertiary and α carbons of the C5 cyclic intermediate. Over the cluster-derived catalysts, cleavage of the ββ carbon bond (the bond farthest from where the cyclization occurs) is much slower than cleavage of the closer αβ carbon bond. At higher conversions (longer residence times), readsorption of the methylpentanes even- tually equilibrates the isomers, resulting in 2-MP/3-MP ratios near 2. Considering indications that the surface in- termediate may be a flatly adsorbed ring (47), we conclude that the cluster-derived catalysts do not have as many nearby Pt atoms available to rapidly cleave the ββ carbon bond. This interpretation is consistent with the preparation of very small and bimetallic particles and is supported by the TEM data for both catalysts. For the 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst, particles are significantly larger (34) than for the analogous PtCu catalyst and greater numbers of multiple platinum atom ensembles are expected. Consequently, the 2-MP/3MP ratio approaches 2 much more quickly over the PtAu catalyst than it does over the PtCu catalyst.
Because 1,5 cyclization to MCP has been suggested to be hydrogen controlled (53), the slower rate of 1,5 cyclization reactionsoverthecluster-derivedcatalystssuggeststhepos- sibility that there are significant differences in available sur- face hydrogen. The amount of available surface hydrogen under the reaction conditions is affected by several factors such as binding affinities and surface coverage of various reaction intermediates, coke formation, and spillover onto the support. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to readily and directly quantify available hydrogen during the reaction.
Although not an absolute measure, relative amounts of sur- facehydrogencanbequalitativelycomparedbyplottingthe ratio of methylcyclopentane to 1,5 cyclization products as a function of conversion (53) (to 1,5 cyclization products,vide supra). The low conversion portion of the plots in Fig. 8 suggests that the cluster-derived catalysts may have less sur- face hydrogen under the reaction conditions than the 0.15- Pt catalyst. This conclusion is also supported by hydrogen chemisorption experiments, which indicate lower hydro- gen uptake capacities at ambient temperatures (71). The reduced levels of surface hydrogen may be an important factor in slowing 1,5 cyclization reactions over the cluster- derived catalysts.
Another consideration for differences between the cluster-derived catalysts and the traditionally prepared cat- alysts is that different forms of carbon are deposited on the smaller bimetallic particles. The types and quantities of sur- face carbon are well known to be important in determining activities and selectivities of catalysts (53). Because particle size distributions did not change significantly after hexane conversion catalysis (34), the primary mode of deactivation is presumed to be coking of the catalyst. Consequently, the possibility that carbon fouling of different sites on the var- ious catalysts cannot be excluded.
Resistance to deactivation.
Plots of overnight catalysis runs for 0.15-Pt and the cluster-derived catalysts appear in Fig. 9. In our previous manuscript (34), we hypothesized that the increased resistance to deactivation processes by cluster-derived PtAu catalysts might be a result of the decreased hydrogenolysis activity (34). The data for the
0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst suggest otherwise. The light hydrocar-
bon distributions from the two cluster-derived catalysts are nearly indistinguishable; however, it is clear from the deac- tivation plots that the addition of copper to platinum via the bimetallic precursor does not impart significant resistance to deactivation. The resistance to deactivation appears to be an intrinsic property of Au or of the PtAu particles. One possibility is that Au imparts different particle morpholo- gies or ensemble geometries that are resistant to catalyst poisoning, although comments on any similarities or dif- ferences in particle morphologies between the two cluster- derived catalysts are little more than speculation. The sug- gested participation of Cu in CC bond fission reactions (59) might also work against any resistance to deactivation that the cluster-derived particle morphology imparts.
SUMMARY
Ligand-stabilized organometallic cluster precursors have been used to prepare highly dispersed bimetallic catalysts SUPPORTED PtAu AND PtCu CATALYSTS FROM MOLECULAR PRECURSORS 197 thatareactiveinalkaneconversionreactions.Boththe0.15- Pt2Au4 and 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalysts have enhanced selectivity for the production of lighter hydrocarbons; the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalysts in particular have significantly increased rates of CC bond fission. The DRIFTS spectrum of carbon monox- ideadsorbedtothiscatalystcontainsaverybroadandasym- metric peak associated with CO bound to Pt. One possible interpretation of this peak is that it results from overlapping linear PtCO stretches and lower energy CO stretches from bridging or semibridging modes between Pt and Cu.
Differences in activity for skeletal rearrangements can be explained in terms of the cyclic mechanism of isomerization and support the characterization data that very small and bimetallic particles are prepared using the cluster precur- sors. Both of the cluster-derived catalysts have very similar light hydrocarbon distribution patterns and favor internal rather than terminal bond scission. At the same time, the
0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst has significantly enhanced resistance
to deactivation processes relative to the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 cata- lyst and a traditionally prepared Pt catalyst. Results with the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst indicate that this is not merely due to a lesser degree of successive terminal hydrogenolysis re- actions by the 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst; rather, it may be an intrinsic property of Au that is expressed by the bimetallic particles prepared using the cluster precursor method.
