[1] "The new catalysts were also compared to traditionally prepared Pt and PtCu catalysts (wetness impregnation or coimpregnation) that had been subjected to identical activation conditions."
[2] "When the molecular cluster precursors were used as catalyst precursors, small and uniform bimetallic particles with high Pt dispersions were prepared."
[3] "The DRIFTS spectrum of CO bound to the cluster-derived PtCu catalyst was exceptionally broad and indicated a large red shift in ν(CO) relative to Pt."
[4] "Despite the similarities of these fission patterns, the PtAu catalyst had greatly enhanced resistance to deactivation processes while the PtCu had no superior deactivation performance over the traditional Pt catalyst."
[5] "The DRIFTS spectrum of CO adsorbed on the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst contains a very broad and asymmetric peak associated with CO bound to Pt."

1. The newly synthesized catalysts were benchmarked against conventionally prepared Pt and PtCu catalysts that underwent the same activation process.
2. Utilizing molecular cluster precursors resulted in the creation of minute, consistent bimetallic particles with superior platinum dispersion.
3. The DRIFTS spectrum of CO adsorbed onto the cluster-derived PtCu catalyst exhibited an unusually broad pattern, suggesting a notable red shift in the CO vibration frequency compared to Pt.
4. The PtAu catalyst demonstrated markedly improved resistance to deactivation processes, unlike the PtCu catalyst which did not surpass the performance of the traditional Pt catalyst in this aspect.
5. The DRIFTS spectrum of CO adsorbed on the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst featured a broad, asymmetric peak attributed to CO bound to Pt.

1. 新合成的催化剂被与传统制备的Pt和PtCu催化剂（浸渍或共浸渍）进行了比较，这些催化剂接受了相同的活化条件。
2. 利用分子簇前体，成功制备了尺寸小、均匀分布的双金属颗粒，并且铂的分散度较高。
3. 群簇衍生的PtCu催化剂上的CO吸附光谱显示了异常宽广的模式，暗示了CO振动频率与Pt相比有显著的红移。
4. PtAu催化剂在抗失活性能方面表现出明显的优势，而PtCu催化剂在这一方面并未超越传统Pt催化剂的表现。
5. 0.15-Pt2Cu4催化剂上的CO吸附光谱包含了一个宽广、不对称的峰值，归因于Pt上吸附的CO。
