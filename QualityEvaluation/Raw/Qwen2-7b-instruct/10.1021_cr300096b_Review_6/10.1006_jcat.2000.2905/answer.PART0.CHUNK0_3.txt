[1] "The DRIFTS spectrum of CO adsorbed on the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst showed a large adsorption band at 2124 cm1 resulting from CO bound to Cu."
[2] "The broad band ranging from roughly 2070 to 2020 cm1 is consistent with previous reports of CO bound to Pt in supported PtCu alloys."
[3] "The DRIFTS spectrum of carbon monoxide adsorbed to the catalyst surfaces are in good agreement with other reports of Pt/silica catalysts."
[4] "The large total CO uptakes found for the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst indicate excellent metal dispersions after the standard activation protocol."
[5] "The addition of Cu (either via coimpregnation or via the bimetallic cluster) does not appear to have any significant effect on the deactivation properties of Pt in these catalysts."

1. The DRIFTS spectrum for CO adsorbed on the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst showed a large absorption band at 2124 cm1, attributed to CO bound to Cu.
2. The broad absorption band from 2070 to 2020 cm1 aligns with findings on CO bound to Pt in supported PtCu catalysts.
3. The DRIFTS spectra of CO adsorbed to the catalyst surfaces matched well with previous reports on Pt/silica catalysts.
4. The substantial total CO uptake by the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst suggests high dispersion of metals post-standard activation process.
5. Incorporating Cu, either through coimpregnation or as part of the bimetallic cluster, does not notably affect the deactivation characteristics of Pt in these catalysts.

1. 在0.15-Pt2Cu4催化剂上吸附的CO的DRIFTS光谱显示了一个大的吸收峰，位于2124 cm1，归因于Cu上的CO。
2. 从2070到2020 cm1的宽吸收带与支持型PtCu合金中Pt上吸附的CO的发现相吻合。
3. CO吸附到催化剂表面的DRIFTS光谱与之前的Pt/silica催化剂报告一致。
4. 0.15-Pt2Cu4催化剂的大量总CO摄取表明在标准激活过程后金属的高分散性。
5. 通过共浸渍或作为双金属簇的一部分添加Cu，并不会显著影响这些催化剂中Pt的脱活特性。
