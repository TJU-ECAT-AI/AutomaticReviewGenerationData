[1] "Carbon monoxide chemisorption data for the 0.15-Pt and 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalysts can be found in Ref. (34). Briefly, for the 0.15-Pt catalyst, the CO chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data were in good general agreement for the determination of Pt particle size."
[2] "The large total CO uptakes found for the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst indicate excellent metal dispersions after the standard activation protocol."
[3] "DRIFTS spectra of CO bound to the catalyst surfaces are in good agreement with other reports of Pt/silica catalysts (39–41)."
[4] "The measured olefin concentrations are consistent with this conclusion and with calculations based on the reaction conditions (400C, H2 : hexane = 16)."
[5] "The light hydrocarbon production over the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst is more than double that of any other catalysts in this study."
[6] "The addition of Cu (either via coimpregnation or via the bimetallic cluster) does not appear to have any significant effect on the deactivation properties of Pt in these catalysts."
[7] "The resistance to deactivation appears to be an intrinsic property of Au or of the PtAu particles."
