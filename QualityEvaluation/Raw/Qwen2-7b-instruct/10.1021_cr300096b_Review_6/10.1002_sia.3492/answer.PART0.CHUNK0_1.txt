1. The valence bandspectrum was measured at hν = 115 eV for clean Ni(111) and Pt/Ni(111) samples, along with the adsorbed methanol at 120 K.
2. The C1s spectra for both samples were measured with a primary energy of 410 eV.
3. All 115 eV spectra for both samples showed a similar shape after temperatures higher than 200 K, with differences only in intensity compared to the spectra before adsorption.
4. A significant change was noted after flashing to 200 K. Both samples exhibited a dominant C1s peak at 286.4 eV, attributed to methoxy, aligning with thermal desorption data provided in references [4,17].
5. The study suggests the formation of an ordered alloyed structure Pt/Ni(111) with a mixture of Pt and Ni atoms on the surface.
6. The absence of formaldehyde intermediate was noted, as it typically has a higher binding energy than adsorbed methanol.

1. 对干净的Ni(111)和Pt/Ni(111)样品，以及在120 K时吸附的甲醇，测量了hν = 115 eV的价带谱。
2. 对两个样品进行了主能为410 eV的C1s谱测量。
3. 温度高于200 K后，所有115 eV光谱对于两个样品具有相似的形状，仅在吸附前的光谱中存在差异。
4. 在闪蒸至200 K后，两个样品都显示出一个主要的C1s峰位于286.4 eV，被归因于甲氧基，与在参考文献[4,17]中提供的热脱附数据一致。
5. 研究表明形成了一种有序的合金结构Pt/Ni(111)，表面含有混合的Pt和Ni原子。
6. 没有观察到通常具有比吸附甲醇更高的结合能的甲醛中间体。
