a,aM. Cabala,a J. Libra,a T. Sk ala,b N. Tsuda and V. Matolna Platinum shows excellent catalytic activity in electrochemical oxidation of methanol. It is widely used in direct methanol fuel cells, but it is readily poisoned by CO-like intermediates generated in methanol activation process. To increase Pt CO tolerance,oxophilic metals such as Ru or Ni are incorporated into Pt.
In our model study we present results of the adsorption and decomposition of methanol on a Pt-Ni ordered surface alloy prepared by Pt evaporation on Ni(111) surface, examined by conventional and synchrotron radiation XPS. Methanol adsorbed at low temperature formed adsorbate multilayers, which were consecutively desorbed upon heating to 600 K. Reaction intermediates arising during desorption were measured. Reaction pathways are discussed and compared with those obtained on a clean Ni(111) single crystal. Copyright c 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
Keywords: catalysis; photoemission; Pt; Ni Introduction The reaction of methanol on platinum has attracted great interest due to continuing research on materials for fuel cell electrodes.
Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) offer an efficient way to convert methanol to electricity. The performance of DMFC is limited by,among other factors, CO poisoning of the anode. Using platinum alloys could offer a good electrode material resistive to CO contamination. The most often used is Ru, but fabrication of fuel cells by Pt-Ru alloy makes production expensive. Cheaper and more effective additives to Pt were studied, the most promising candidates seemed to be first row transitions metals, mainly Ni and Co were proposed.[1] Decomposition of methanol on pure Ni (111) was studied both theoretically and experimentally. Based on DFT calculation publishedbyWang,[2] wherewideoverviewofexperimentalresults is listed, it is suggested that methanol is more likely to desorb than decompose on Ni(111). Moreover, under higher temperature OH bond activation is the preferable mechanism during the dehydrogenation of methanol, which is followed by sequential hydrogen abstraction to form formaldehyde, formyl intermediate species, and the final products CO and H.
On defect-free Pt(111) surface methanol does not decompose in vacuum.[3,4] Based on EELS measurement, Gibson and Dubois[5] suggested that methanol decomposition on Pt(111) occurred only on defects. Also on polycrystalline Pt foil was by TDS and HREELS detected CH3OH decomposition.[6] Greeley and Mavrikakis[7,8] suggested that on Pt(111) the methanol decomposition reaction leading to adsorbed CO may proceed through OH bond scission in methanol followed by a sequential dehydrogenation of methoxy to CO or CH bond scission to hydroxymethyl followed by OH scission to give formaldehyde and/or followed by a second CH scission and a quasisimultaneous OH/CH scission to CO.
Model bimetallic catalysts based on Pt and Ni were also studied with majority of the work being devoted to the Ni/Pt(111) system.
An extensive review focused on bimetallic system based on Pt could be found in Ref. [9]. Skoplyak et al.[4] presented a study of reactivity trends for methanol on Co/Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111), where increasedmethanolandmethoxybindingenergieswerepredicted by DFT calculations for a monolayer Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface. These trends were confirmed by TPD and HREELS. The formation of methoxy was identified at 200 K, formaldehyde at 300 K, which further reacted to form CO and H2 at higher temperature.
Ni/Pt(111) and Pt/Ni(111) surfaces were compared in Ref. [10],where decomposition of ethylene was studied and was concluded thatfor1monolayer(ML)ofdepositbothsurfacesexhibitedsimilar chemical properties.
Experimental The measurements were carried out at the Materials Science Beamline, synchrotron radiation facility Elettra in Trieste. The radiation comes from a bending magnet with tuning range from 21 to 91 00 eV. The experimental chamber with the base pressure of 1 × 1010 mbar was equipped with a 150 mm mean radius electron energy analyzer, dual Mg/Al X-ray source, rear view low energy electron diffraction (LEED) optics, Pt evaporator source and ion gun. The core level spectra with use of synchrotron radiation were recorded at normal emission of the photoelectrons with respect to the surface. We used the following photon energies:115 eV for the valence band, 180 eV for Pt 4f and Ni 3p core levels,and 410 eV for C 1s level. For the Ni 2p and O 1s core levels an Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) X-ray source was used, and the emission angle was 20with respect to the sample normal.

Ni(111) single-crystal was purchased from MaTecK GmbH in a form of a disc of 10 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness. It was cut and polished with an accuracy better than 0.1with respect to the (111) surface plane. The sample was cleaned in ultrahigh vacuum by repeated Ar+ sputtering (ion energy 1 keV, current density 15 A.cm2 at 970 K) and annealing at 670 K. The surface crystal quality was confirmed by LEED and cleanliness by photoelectron spectra. Platinum was deposited on the nickel surface at room temperature by evaporation from an e-beam evaporator. The deposition rate was 0.02 monolayer per minute and the total thickness was 0.5 ML. The samples were exposed to methanol (CH3OH) through a nondirectional leak valve at 120 K. Exposure in Langmuir (1 L = 1.3 × 106 mbar.s) was determined from the time of exposure and methanol pressure (set to 1 × 107 mbar) in the chamber.
Results and Discussion The Ni(111) single crystal was used as a reference sample in order to obtain photoemission data from the methanol decomposition on bulk nickel, not influenced by an interaction with platinum.
Methanol was adsorbed on Ni(111) at 120 K and then flashed stepwise up to 500 K. Photoemission spectra were acquired at each temperature step. The same procedure was carried out on the Pt/Ni(111) surface prepared by evaporation of 0.5 ML of platinum onto clean nickel and flashed to 600 K (to stabilize the surface and to support PtNi alloying).
The evolution of Pt 4f photoemission spectra measured with primary energy of 180 eV in dependence on sample treatment is displayed in Fig. 1. We can clearly distinguish two components of Pt 4f7/2 at binding energy (BE) 70.8 and 71.2 eV, which we assigned to surface and bulk contributions. These values are about 0.3 eV higher than those reported for clean Pt(111) surface in[11]. This shift could indicate particle size effect or alloying of Pt and Ni.
We suggest, as more probable, the creation of an alloy. This is supported by results obtained by Barnard et al.[12], who observed strong diffusion of Pt into Ni and alloying. Another reason could be a slight shift to higher BE (0.1 eV) of both components measured after flash of as-deposited sample with no change of their half width. Also the change in the intensity ratio of Pt/Ni indicates the diffusion of Pt to Ni substrate. LEED measurements showed 1 × 1 pattern, with high diffuse background intensity after deposition;after flash to 600 K it became better, but not so sharp as for clean Ni(111). Further evolution of the spectra will be discussed below together with results of the C 1s and O 1s core levels. In the valence band region we observed little intensity attenuation of the main peak and 0.2 eV narrowing of its half width, which confirms an interaction Pt with Ni. A comparison of valence bands for clean Ni and Pt/Ni samples is shown in Fig. 2, middle spectra.
Thevalencebandspectrameasuredathν = 115 eVofadsorbed methanol are in Fig. 2. The middle spectra correspond to the clean nickel and Pt/Ni(111) surface. The bottom spectrum obtained at 120 K reveals peaks at BE of 12.8, 10.2, 6.2 eV and a shoulder at
7.7 eV. These peaks correspond to the 5a, 1a + 6a, 7a and
2a molecular levels of gas methanol, however, they are shifted to lower BE, which is typical for chemisorbed methanol.[13] The peak located at 17.6 eV has no correspondence in He I spectrum of methanol and is likely to be related to a level with mainly 2s character.[14] The spectrum for Pt/Ni(111) sample is shifted about
0.2 to lower BE which is probably given by a Pt influence. BE

clean Pt(111) were reported at 12.5, 10.7, 5.8 and 7.2 eV.[13] After flash to 140 K, the spectra did not change. Upon heating to 200 K all peaks characteristic for adsorbed methanol disappeared and only traces of peak at 17.6 eV remained. No new peaks were observed. On valence band spectra of clean Ni crystal taken with primary energy 62 eV (upper spectrum) it is possible to distinguish very low contributions at 9 and 11.5 eV, which corresponds to CO molecular orbitals.[15] A new broad peak around 5 eV was observed, which could be assigned to methoxy. For further low contribution at 14.5 eV, we did not find any reference. The rest of the peak at 17.6 eV is more remarkable than in spectra taken with a primary energy of 115 eV.

For temperatures higher than 200 K, all 115 eV spectra for both samples had almost identical shape with those measured before adsorption differing only in the intensity.
TheC1sspectraforbothsamplesmeasuredwithprimaryenergy 410 eV are presented in Fig. 3. After 60 L methanol adsorption at 120 K, a single broad peak is observed on both samples. For the Ni(111) sample BE 287.44 eV well corresponds to the value of methanol multilayer reported in Ref. [16], where dehydrogenation of methanol on Ni(100) studied by photoemission was published.
On Pt/Ni(111) sample the peak is shifted by 0.1 eV to lower
BE. Corresponding O 1s peaks measured with primary energy
1486.6 eV had positions at 533.8 eV for both samples. After
flash to 140 K (not presented), only a small reduction of intensity was observed. In Fig. 1, showing the evolution of Pt 4f doublet, the spectra measured after adsorption and flash to 140 K are not shown as the information depth with primary energy of 180 eV was lower than the thickness of the adsorbed layer.
A remarkable change is observed after flash to 200 K. On both samples the dominant C 1s peak is located at 286.4 eV which we assigned to methoxy, in agreement with thermo desorption data presented in Ref. [4,17]. Corresponding O 1s peak has a position at
532.8 eV.Oncleannickel,peakat285.2 eVwasresolved,itsposition
matchestoadsorptionofCOinbridgepositions[18] andalsotheO1s peak at 531.1 eV is in agreement with published values in Ref. [18].
A small peak at 284.5 eV was in context with further evolution on both samples ascribed to CHO. This assignment is based mainly on results obtained by Stottlemeyer et al.[6] who identified aldehyde components by HREELS on Ni/polycrystalline Pt. The featureat283.5 eVcorrespondswelltonickelcarbideformation[16].
On Pt/Ni(111) sample is also observable contribution of carbide feature, which is more intense due to the formation of platinum carbide. Creation of PtC with similar BE was observed on Pt(110) by Shaikhutdinov[19]. On Pt 4f spectra measured at 200 K, we can see lowering especially of the surface component and a small contribution at 71.9 eV given most probably by CO adsorption induced binding energy shift of the substrate surface signal. The low intensity of surface component is probably associated with methoxy adsorption, which is only weakly bonded. After flash to 300 K, three C 1s components on nickel sample are observed, they correspond to CO with lower intensity, CHO with higher intensity and the same carbide in comparison with results obtained after flash to 200 K. On Pt/Ni(111) sample we can clearly resolve four peaks. Two at the lower energy side of spectra we ascribed again to carbide at 283.5 eV and to CHO component at 284.5.
The peak at 286.5 eV we assigned to CO on-top bounded to Pt, its corresponding O1s signal has binding energy 532.7 eV; both these values are in agreement with data published in Ref. [11] where CO adsorption on Pt(111) was studied. Further confirmation could be seen on Pt 4f spectra in Fig. 1, where CO adsorption-induced binding-energy shift is clearly observable with BE 72 eV, which well corresponds to the value of 71.91 eV reported in Ref. [11].
The most intense peak in the spectrum at BE 285.5 eV could have origin in CO adsorbed in bridge position between Ni and Pt atoms, and so, being at the BE lower than 286 eV, which was measured for CO adsorbed in bridge position for Pt(111) surface by Bj orneholm.[11] After flash to 400 K, the spectra had very low intensity, therefore,we did not use the fitting procedure. Nevertheless, on both samples, the carbide feature could be resolved, and on Ni(111) also traces of CO(Ni) component. The Pt 4f spectra in Fig. 1 have almost the same shape and intensity as the clean surface before methanol adsorption.
On the basis of LEED and photoemission measurements we propose that we prepared ordered alloyed structure Pt/Ni(111) with mixture of both Pt and Ni atoms on the surface. As the surface component of Pt 4f spectra is strongly influenced by species originating during decomposition of methanol it is obvious that Pt did not diffuse completely into Ni(111) substrate.
Considering results of Barnard[12] it is improbable that Pt formed three-dimensionalislands,nevertheless,somesurfaceroughening given by larger radius of Pt should be taken into account.
However, it would be suitable to perform further experiments to better know the surface composition and morphology of the system.
Both on clean Ni(111) and Pt/Ni(111) methanol adsorbed at low temperature decomposes upon heating by forming methoxy intermediate at 200 K. At the same temperature, CO and small contribution tentatively assigned to CHO (formyl) is observed on Ni. On the sample modified by Pt we do not see any contributions of CO, but more intense peak corresponding to CHO. With temperature increased to 300 K the amount of CO on clean Ni diminishes and CHO grows. On the sample with Pt creation of CO is dominant, while CHO decreases. From 200 K, the carbide formation is observed which persists up to 400 K. Traces of CO could be resolved at 400 K for clean Ni on contrary to Pt/Ni surface. Let us note that for unambiguous assignment of peaks (especially of CHO) more accurate experiment connected with termodesorption measurements would be desirable.
If we compare our results with similar systems studied by Skoplyak[4] our layer of Pt/Ni(111) is the most similar to the surface denoted as NiPtPt(111) with the topmost layer enriched by Ni.
The only difference is that we did not observed the creation of formaldehyde intermediate which had usually higher BE[20] than adsorbed methanol.

Conclusion Methanol adsorbed at low temperature on Ni(111) and Pt/Ni(111) model catalyst decomposes upon heating by forming a methoxy intermediate. By comparing results we could conclude that by deposition of Pt the decomposition process is only slightly influenced. Nevertheless, the desorption of CO from Pt occurs at lower temperature than on clean Pt(111) or model bimetallic catalyst prepared by evaporation of Ni onto Pt(111).
