<p>Decomposition of methanol on pure Ni (111) was studied both theoretically and experimentally. Based on DFT calculation publishedbyWang,[2] wherewideoverviewofexperimentalresults is listed, it is suggested that methanol is more likely to desorb than decompose on Ni(111). Moreover, under higher temperature OH bond activation is the preferable mechanism during the dehydrogenation of methanol, which is followed by sequential hydrogen abstraction to form formaldehyde, formyl intermediate species, and the final products CO and H.</p>
<p>On defect-free Pt(111) surface methanol does not decompose in vacuum.[3,4] Based on EELS measurement, Gibson and Dubois[5] suggested that methanol decomposition on Pt(111) occurred only on defects. Also on polycrystalline Pt foil was by TDS and HREELS detected CH3OH decomposition.[6]</p>
<p>Greeley and Mavrikakis[7,8] suggested that on Pt(111) the methanol decomposition reaction leading to adsorbed CO may proceed through OH bond scission in methanol followed by a sequential dehydrogenation of methoxy to CO or CH bond scission to hydroxymethyl followed by OH scission to give formaldehyde and/or followed by a second CH scission and a quasisimultaneous OH/CH scission to CO.</p>
<p>An extensive review focused on bimetallic system based on Pt could be found in Ref. [9]. Skoplyak et al.[4] presented a study of reactivity trends for methanol on Co/Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111), where increased methanol and methoxy binding energies were predicted by DFT calculations for a monolayer Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface. These trends were confirmed by TPD and HREELS. The formation of methoxy was identified at 200 K, formaldehyde at 300 K, which further reacted to form CO and H2 at higher temperature.</p>
<p>Ni(111) single-crystal was used as a reference sample in order to obtain photoemission data from the methanol decomposition on bulk nickel, not influenced by an interaction with platinum.</p>
<p>The evolution of Pt 4f photoemission spectra measured with primary energy of 180 eV in dependence on sample treatment is displayed in Fig. 1. We can clearly distinguish two components of Pt 4f7/2 at binding energy (BE) 70.8 and 71.2 eV, which we assigned to surface and bulk contributions. These values are about 0.3 eV higher than those reported for clean Pt(111) surface in[11]. This shift could indicate particle size effect or alloying of Pt and Ni.</p>
<p>We suggest, as more probable, the creation of an alloy. This is supported by results obtained by Barnard et al.[12], who observed strong diffusion of Pt into Ni and alloying. Another reason could be a slight shift to higher BE (0.1 eV) of both components measured after flash of as-deposited sample with no change of their half width. Also the change in the intensity ratio of Pt/Ni indicates the diffusion of Pt to Ni substrate.</p>
<p>The valence bands spectra measured at ν = 115 eV of adsorbed methanol are in Fig. 2. The middle spectra correspond to the clean nickel and Pt/Ni(111) surface. The bottom spectrum obtained at 120 K reveals peaks at BE of 12.8, 10.2, 6.2 eV and a shoulder at 7.7 eV. These peaks correspond to the 5a, 1a + 6a, 7a and 2a molecular levels of gas methanol, however, they are shifted to lower BE, which is typical for chemisorbed methanol.</p>
<p>After flash to 200 K all peaks characteristic for adsorbed methanol disappeared and only traces of peak at 17.6 eV remained. No new peaks were observed.</p>
<p>The C1s spectra for both samples measured with primary energy 410 eV are presented in Fig. 3. After 60 L methanol adsorption at 120 K, a single broad peak is observed on both samples.</p>
<p>A remarkable change is observed after flash to 200 K. On both samples the dominant C1s peak is located at 286.4 eV which we assigned to methoxy, in agreement with thermo desorption data presented in Ref. [4,17].</p>
<p>On Pt/Ni(111) sample is also observable contribution of carbide feature, which is more intense due to the formation of platinum carbide.</p>
<p>From 200 K, the carbide formation is observed which persists up to 400 K. Traces of CO could be resolved at 400 K for clean Ni on contrary to Pt/Ni surface.</p>
<p>By comparing results we could conclude that by deposition of Pt the decomposition process is only slightly influenced.</p>

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The studies show that on a clean Pt(111) surface, methanol does not decompose under vacuum conditions. However, on a Pt/Ni(111) surface, methanol decomposition occurs through the formation of methoxy intermediate at 200 K. The decomposition pathway includes OH bond scission in methanol, followed by sequential dehydrogenation of methoxy to CO or CH bond scission to hydroxymethyl, followed by OH scission to give formaldehyde. At higher temperatures, the carbide feature forms persistently up to 400 K, and traces of CO are resolved for clean Ni but not for Pt/Ni surface. The presence of Pt in the Pt/Ni(111) system influences the methanol decomposition process slightly, but it does not completely prevent the desorption of CO from Pt at lower temperatures than on clean Pt(111) or model bimetallic catalysts prepared by evaporation of Ni onto Pt(111).

实验技术如HREELS和AES用于验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面层3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的分层。研究表明，在纯的Pt(111)表面上，甲醇在真空条件下不会分解。然而，在Pt/Ni(111)表面上，甲醇分解通过在200 K形成甲氧基中间体发生。分解途径包括甲醇中的OH键断裂，随后是甲氧基到CO的顺序脱氢或CH键断裂到羟甲基，然后是OH断裂生成甲醛。在较高温度下，碳化物特征持续形成至400 K，并在清洁Ni上可检测到CO的痕迹，但在Pt/Ni表面上无法检测到。Pt在Pt/Ni(111)系统中的存在略微影响甲醇分解过程，但并不能完全阻止从Pt在较低温度下脱出CO，与仅通过蒸发Ni到Pt(111)表面上制备的模型双金属催化剂相比。
