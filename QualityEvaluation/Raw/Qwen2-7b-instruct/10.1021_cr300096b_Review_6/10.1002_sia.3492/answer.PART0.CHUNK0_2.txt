1. The document mentions that cheaper alternatives to platinum, such as nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), are being studied as additives for platinum-based fuel cells. These are considered promising because they are less expensive than ruthenium (Ru).

2. The text states that methanol adsorbs at low temperatures on nickel (Ni) surfaces and forms a methoxy intermediate upon heating. When the methanol is adsorbed on a Pt/Ni(111) model catalyst, the decomposition process is slightly affected by the presence of platinum.

3. The document notes that the Pt/Ni(111) surface preparation method leads to a structure similar to the NiPtPt(111) surface, but with a topmost layer enriched in nickel.

4. The conclusion drawn from the research is that the addition of platinum to the Ni(111) surface has a minimal impact on the methanol decomposition pathway, although it changes the desorption kinetics of carbon monoxide (CO) compared to pure platinum surfaces.

1. 文档提到，作为铂基燃料电池的更便宜替代品，镍（Ni）和钴（Co）等第一行过渡金属正在被研究作为铂的添加剂。这些被认为是有前景的，因为它们比钌（Ru）更便宜。

2. 文本指出，在低温下甲醇吸附在Ni表面上并形成甲氧基中间体。当甲醇吸附在Pt/Ni(111)模型催化剂上时，铂的存在对分解过程的影响很小。

3. 文档指出，Pt/Ni(111)表面制备方法导致与NiPtPt(111)表面类似，但顶部层富含镍。

4. 研究得出的结论是，向Ni(111)表面添加铂对甲醇分解路径的影响很小，尽管它改变了碳氧化物（CO）的脱附动力学。
