The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES do not directly verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, they do measure the presence of carbide and aldehyde components, which can indirectly provide insights into the segregation of Ni and Co atoms. The kinetics and activation barriers are not explicitly compared with DFT predictions in the document.

The results show that the deposition of Pt influences the methanol decomposition process only slightly. At 200 K, the formation of methoxy intermediate is observed on both Ni(111) and Pt/Ni(111) surfaces. Above 300 K, the amount of CO decreases on clean Ni, while CHO increases. On the Pt/Ni surface, CO creation becomes dominant, and CHO decreases. Carbide formation is observed persistently up to 400 K. Traces of CO can be resolved at 400 K on clean Ni, contrasting with the Pt/Ni surface.

实验技术如HREELS和AES并未直接验证和量化氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分离。但是，它们确实测量了碳化物和醛类成分的存在，这可以间接提供有关Ni和Co原子分离的见解。文中没有明确比较与DFT预测的动态和激活壁垒。

结果表明，铂沉积仅轻微影响甲醇分解过程。在200 K时，在Ni(111)和Pt/Ni(111)表面上都观察到了甲氧基中间体的形成。高于300 K，清洁Ni上的CO量减少，而CHO增加。在Pt/Ni表面上，CO生成成为主导，CHO减少。从200 K开始，观察到碳化物的形成并持续到400 K。在400 K时，可以在清洁Ni上分辨出少量的CO，这与Pt/Ni表面形成对比。
