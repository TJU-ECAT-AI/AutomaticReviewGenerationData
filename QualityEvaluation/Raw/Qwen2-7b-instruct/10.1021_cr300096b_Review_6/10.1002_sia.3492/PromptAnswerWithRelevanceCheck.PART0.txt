<p>Decomposition of methanol on pure Ni (111) was studied both theoretically and experimentally. Based on DFT calculation publishedbyWang,[2] wherewideoverviewofexperimentalresults is listed, it is suggested that methanol is more likely to desorb than decompose on Ni(111). Moreover, under higher temperature OH bond activation is the preferable mechanism during the dehydrogenation of methanol, which is followed by sequential hydrogen abstraction to form formaldehyde, formyl intermediate species, and the final products CO and H.</p>
<p>On defect-free Pt(111) surface methanol does not decompose in vacuum.[3,4] Based on EELS measurement, Gibson and Dubois[5] suggested that methanol decomposition on Pt(111) occurred only on defects. Also on polycrystalline Pt foil was by TDS and HREELS detected CH3OH decomposition.[6]</p>
<p>Greeley and Mavrikakis[7,8] suggested that on Pt(111) the methanol decomposition reaction leading to adsorbed CO may proceed through OH bond scission in methanol followed by a sequential dehydrogenation of methoxy to CO or CH bond scission to hydroxymethyl followed by OH scission to give formaldehyde and/or followed by a second CH scission and a quasisimultaneous OH/CH scission to CO.</p>
<p>An extensive review focused on bimetallic system based on Pt could be found in Ref. [9]. Skoplyak et al.[4] presented a study of reactivity trends for methanol on Co/Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111), where increased methanol and methoxy binding energies were predicted by DFT calculations for a monolayer Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface. These trends were confirmed by TPD and HREELS. The formation of methoxy was identified at 200 K, formaldehyde at 300 K, which further reacted to form CO and H2 at higher temperature.</p>
<p>Ni(111) single-crystal was used as a reference sample in order to obtain photoemission data from the methanol decomposition on bulk nickel, not influenced by an interaction with platinum.</p>
<p>The evolution of Pt 4f photoemission spectra measured with primary energy of 180 eV in dependence on sample treatment is displayed in Fig. 1. We can clearly distinguish two components of Pt 4f7/2 at binding energy (BE) 70.8 and 71.2 eV, which we assigned to surface and bulk contributions. These values are about 0.3 eV higher than those reported for clean Pt(111) surface in[11]. This shift could indicate particle size effect or alloying of Pt and Ni.</p>
<p>We suggest, as more probable, the creation of an alloy. This is supported by results obtained by Barnard et al.[12], who observed strong diffusion of Pt into Ni and alloying. Another reason could be a slight shift to higher BE (0.1 eV) of both components measured after flash of as-deposited sample with no change of their half width. Also the change in the intensity ratio of Pt/Ni indicates the diffusion of Pt to Ni substrate.</p>
<p>The valence bands spectra measured at ν = 115 eV of adsorbed methanol are in Fig. 2. The middle spectra correspond to the clean nickel and Pt/Ni(111) surface. The bottom spectrum obtained at 120 K reveals peaks at BE of 12.8, 10.2, 6.2 eV and a shoulder at 7.7 eV. These peaks correspond to the 5a, 1a + 6a, 7a and 2a molecular levels of gas methanol, however, they are shifted to lower BE, which is typical for chemisorbed methanol.</p>
<p>After flash to 200 K all peaks characteristic for adsorbed methanol disappeared and only traces of peak at 17.6 eV remained. No new peaks were observed.</p>
<p>The C1s spectra for both samples measured with primary energy 410 eV are presented in Fig. 3. After 60 L methanol adsorption at 120 K, a single broad peak is observed on both samples.</p>
<p>A remarkable change is observed after flash to 200 K. On both samples the dominant C1s peak is located at 286.4 eV which we assigned to methoxy, in agreement with thermo desorption data presented in Ref. [4,17].</p>
<p>On Pt/Ni(111) sample is also observable contribution of carbide feature, which is more intense due to the formation of platinum carbide.</p>
<p>From 200 K, the carbide formation is observed which persists up to 400 K. Traces of CO could be resolved at 400 K for clean Ni on contrary to Pt/Ni surface.</p>
<p>By comparing results we could conclude that by deposition of Pt the decomposition process is only slightly influenced.</p>

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The studies show that on a clean Pt(111) surface, methanol does not decompose under vacuum conditions. However, on a Pt/Ni(111) surface, methanol decomposition occurs through the formation of methoxy intermediate at 200 K. The decomposition pathway includes OH bond scission in methanol, followed by sequential dehydrogenation of methoxy to CO or CH bond scission to hydroxymethyl, followed by OH scission to give formaldehyde. At higher temperatures, the carbide feature forms persistently up to 400 K, and traces of CO are resolved for clean Ni but not for Pt/Ni surface. The presence of Pt in the Pt/Ni(111) system influences the methanol decomposition process slightly, but it does not completely prevent the desorption of CO from Pt at lower temperatures than on clean Pt(111) or model bimetallic catalysts prepared by evaporation of Ni onto Pt(111).

实验技术如HREELS和AES用于验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面层3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的分层。研究表明，在纯的Pt(111)表面上，甲醇在真空条件下不会分解。然而，在Pt/Ni(111)表面上，甲醇分解通过在200 K形成甲氧基中间体发生。分解途径包括甲醇中的OH键断裂，随后是甲氧基到CO的顺序脱氢或CH键断裂到羟甲基，然后是OH断裂生成甲醛。在较高温度下，碳化物特征持续形成至400 K，并在清洁Ni上可检测到CO的痕迹，但在Pt/Ni表面上无法检测到。Pt在Pt/Ni(111)系统中的存在略微影响甲醇分解过程，但并不能完全阻止从Pt在较低温度下脱出CO，与仅通过蒸发Ni到Pt(111)表面上制备的模型双金属催化剂相比。

1. The document mentions that cheaper alternatives to platinum, such as nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), are being studied as additives for platinum-based fuel cells. These are considered promising because they are less expensive than ruthenium (Ru).

2. The text states that methanol adsorbs at low temperatures on nickel (Ni) surfaces and forms a methoxy intermediate upon heating. When the methanol is adsorbed on a Pt/Ni(111) model catalyst, the decomposition process is slightly affected by the presence of platinum.

3. The document notes that the Pt/Ni(111) surface preparation method leads to a structure similar to the NiPtPt(111) surface, but with a topmost layer enriched in nickel.

4. The conclusion drawn from the research is that the addition of platinum to the Ni(111) surface has a minimal impact on the methanol decomposition pathway, although it changes the desorption kinetics of carbon monoxide (CO) compared to pure platinum surfaces.

1. 文档提到，作为铂基燃料电池的更便宜替代品，镍（Ni）和钴（Co）等第一行过渡金属正在被研究作为铂的添加剂。这些被认为是有前景的，因为它们比钌（Ru）更便宜。

2. 文本指出，在低温下甲醇吸附在Ni表面上并形成甲氧基中间体。当甲醇吸附在Pt/Ni(111)模型催化剂上时，铂的存在对分解过程的影响很小。

3. 文档指出，Pt/Ni(111)表面制备方法导致与NiPtPt(111)表面类似，但顶部层富含镍。

4. 研究得出的结论是，向Ni(111)表面添加铂对甲醇分解路径的影响很小，尽管它改变了碳氧化物（CO）的脱附动力学。

The experimental techniques utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include HREELS and AES. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers in this study were compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions. The analysis revealed that the Pt/Ni(111) model catalyst exhibited a similar methanol decomposition pathway to that observed on the NiPtPt(111) surface, as described by Skoplyak. Notably, the formation of formaldehyde intermediate was not observed on the Pt/Ni(111) surface, differing from the typical behavior on other systems.

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES do not directly verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, they do measure the presence of carbide and aldehyde components, which can indirectly provide insights into the segregation of Ni and Co atoms. The kinetics and activation barriers are not explicitly compared with DFT predictions in the document.

The results show that the deposition of Pt influences the methanol decomposition process only slightly. At 200 K, the formation of methoxy intermediate is observed on both Ni(111) and Pt/Ni(111) surfaces. Above 300 K, the amount of CO decreases on clean Ni, while CHO increases. On the Pt/Ni surface, CO creation becomes dominant, and CHO decreases. Carbide formation is observed persistently up to 400 K. Traces of CO can be resolved at 400 K on clean Ni, contrasting with the Pt/Ni surface.

实验技术如HREELS和AES并未直接验证和量化氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分离。但是，它们确实测量了碳化物和醛类成分的存在，这可以间接提供有关Ni和Co原子分离的见解。文中没有明确比较与DFT预测的动态和激活壁垒。

结果表明，铂沉积仅轻微影响甲醇分解过程。在200 K时，在Ni(111)和Pt/Ni(111)表面上都观察到了甲氧基中间体的形成。高于300 K，清洁Ni上的CO量减少，而CHO增加。在Pt/Ni表面上，CO生成成为主导，CHO减少。从200 K开始，观察到碳化物的形成并持续到400 K。在400 K时，可以在清洁Ni上分辨出少量的CO，这与Pt/Ni表面形成对比。
