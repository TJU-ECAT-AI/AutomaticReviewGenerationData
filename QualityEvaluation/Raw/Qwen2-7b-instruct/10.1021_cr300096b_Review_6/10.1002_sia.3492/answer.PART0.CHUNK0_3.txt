[2] "Cheaper and more effective additives to Pt were studied, the most promising candidates seemed to be first row transitions metals, mainly Ni and Co were proposed."

[5] "Skoplyak et al.[4] presented a study of reactivity trends for methanol on Co/Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111), where increased methanol and methoxy binding energies were predicted by DFT calculations for a monolayer Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface."
[6] "For temperatures higher than 200 K, all 115 eV spectra for both samples had almost identical shape with those measured before adsorption differing only in the intensity."

The experimental techniques utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include HREELS and AES. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers in this study were compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions. The analysis revealed that the Pt/Ni(111) model catalyst exhibited a similar methanol decomposition pathway to that observed on the NiPtPt(111) surface, as described by Skoplyak. Notably, the formation of formaldehyde intermediate was not observed on the Pt/Ni(111) surface, differing from the typical behavior on other systems.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和原子发射光谱（AES），被用来验证和量化氧诱导的表面同位素在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面同位素分布。本研究中测量的同位素分布动力学和活化势垒与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测进行了比较。分析结果显示，Pt/Ni(111)模型催化剂的甲醇分解途径与NiPtPt(111)表面上的观察结果相似，正如Skoplyak所描述的那样。值得注意的是，在Pt/Ni(111)表面上没有观察到形成甲醛中间体的现象，这与其他系统的典型行为不同。
