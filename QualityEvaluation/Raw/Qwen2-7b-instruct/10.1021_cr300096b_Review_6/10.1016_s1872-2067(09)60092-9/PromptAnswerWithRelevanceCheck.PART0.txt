The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) with spin polarization. A 3×3 slab with four metal layers was used to model the adsorption of 1,3-CHD (1 adsorbate per unit cell). The top two layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration while the bottom two layers were fixed at a bulk Pt-Pt bond length as previously described in detail [4,8]. A 3×3×1 Monkhorst-Pack K-point grid mesh was used to determine the electronic energies. The optimized configuration for 1,3-CHD adsorption is shown in Fig. 3.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) with spin polarization. The adsorption of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) on a 3×3 slab with four metal layers was modeled. The top two layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration, while the bottom two layers were kept at a bulk Pt-Pt bond length. A 3×3×1 Monkhorst-Pack K-point grid mesh was utilized to determine the electronic energies. The optimized configuration for 1,3-CHD adsorption is illustrated in Figure 3.

<p>Two hydrogenation products, cyclohexene and cyclohexane, were detected over the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. With an increase in reaction time, cyclohexene is further hydrogenated and converted into cyclohexane. The Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst promotes both the partial hydrogenation of 1,3-CHD to cyclohexene and dehydrogenation to benzene although the consumption rate of 1,3-CHD is relatively slow.</p>
<p>The result over Ni/γ-Al2O3 is consistent with the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-CHD over a Ni(100) surface as reported by Tjandra et al. [14].</p>
<p>By comparison, the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-CHD over Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 are different from those of the monometallic catalysts. Both cyclohexane and benzene are produced at a much faster initial rate.</p>
<p>Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111). Two types of bimetallic surfaces were investigated, the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface structure with a monolayer of Ni residing on top of Pt(111) and the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) configuration with one monolayer of Ni between the first and second layers of Pt.</p>
<p>As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111).</p>
<p>Another interesting observation in Table 2 is that the binding energies of 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are higher on the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111) suggesting that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure should be more thermodynamically favored than the parent metals for the dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that reactions of 1,3-CHD are complicated because of the simultaneous hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways, making it more difficult to correlate binding energies and catalytic activities.</p>

The experimental techniques utilized in the study included comparing the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) over Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts with those over monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. It was observed that the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst showed higher activity, producing both cyclohexane and benzene at a faster initial rate compared to the monometallic catalysts. The DFT calculations indicated that the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen were lower on the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) structure than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111), correlating with the enhanced hydrogenation activity of the bimetallic catalyst.

研究中采用的技术包括比较了1,3-环己二烯（1,3-CHD）在Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂上的氢化和脱氢活性与单金属Pt和Ni催化剂的活性。结果发现，Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂表现出更高的活性，以更快的初始速率产生环己烷和苯。DFT计算表明，1,3-CHD和原子氢的结合能较低Pt-Ni-Pt(111)结构上比Pt(111)或Ni(111)，这与双金属催化剂的增强氢化活性相吻合。

<p>Combined experimental and DFT results indicate that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-CHD, leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst.</p>
<p>By comparison, the surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure shows the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen, promoting the dehydrogenation pathway.</p>

This study highlights that the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher reaction rates than the Pt and Ni monometallic catalysts due to the unique subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt and surface Ni-Pt-Pt structures. These structures contribute to the differences in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities, with the former showing lower binding energies for 1,3-cyclohexadiene and thus higher hydrogenation rates, while the latter exhibits higher binding energies, facilitating the dehydrogenation pathway.

这项研究强调，与单金属催化剂相比，Pt-Ni双金属催化剂的反应速率更高，这归因于独特的子表面Pt-Ni-Pt和表面Ni-Pt-Pt结构。这些结构导致了氢化和脱氢活性的不同，前者表现出更低的1,3-环己二烯结合能和更高的氢化速率，而后者则促进了脱氢途径的进行。

<p>Figure 1 compares the consumption of 1,3-CHD and the formation of cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene as a function of reaction time at 308 K. Two hydrogenation prod- ucts, cyclohexene and cyclohexane, were detected over the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. With an increase in reaction time, cyclo- hexene is further hydrogenated and converted into cyclohex- ane. The Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst promotes both the partial hydro- genation of 1,3-CHD to cyclohexene and dehydrogenation to benzene although the consumption rate of 1,3-CHD is rela- tively slow. The result over Ni/γ-Al2O3 is consistent with the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-CHD over a Ni(100) surface as reported by Tjandra et al. [14].

<p>Figure 2 shows FT-IR spectra of different catalysts after the 1,3-CHD hydrogenation reaction and the intensities were normalized based on the number of metal sites. The vibrational features of the CH (3 032 cm1), CH2 (2 926 and 2 853 cm1), C=C (1 647 cm1), and CH3 (1 377 and 1 450 cm1) functional groups indicate that adsorption of the hydrocarbon intermedi- ates and fragments occurred on the surface of the catalysts.</p>
<p>As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]. Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8].</p>

The experimental findings suggest that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD), resulting in the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst. Conversely, the surface Ni-Pt-Pt structure exhibits the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen, which facilitates the dehydrogenation pathway.
