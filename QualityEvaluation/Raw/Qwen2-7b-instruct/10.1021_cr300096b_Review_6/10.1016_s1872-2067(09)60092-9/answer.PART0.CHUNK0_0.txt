The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) with spin polarization. A 3×3 slab with four metal layers was used to model the adsorption of 1,3-CHD (1 adsorbate per unit cell). The top two layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration while the bottom two layers were fixed at a bulk Pt-Pt bond length as previously described in detail [4,8]. A 3×3×1 Monkhorst-Pack K-point grid mesh was used to determine the electronic energies. The optimized configuration for 1,3-CHD adsorption is shown in Fig. 3.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) with spin polarization. The adsorption of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) on a 3×3 slab with four metal layers was modeled. The top two layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration, while the bottom two layers were kept at a bulk Pt-Pt bond length. A 3×3×1 Monkhorst-Pack K-point grid mesh was utilized to determine the electronic energies. The optimized configuration for 1,3-CHD adsorption is illustrated in Figure 3.

使用维也纳ab-初始化模拟包(VASP)和自旋极化，进行了密度泛函理论(DFT)计算。对包含一个吸附分子的单元格的3×3层进行建模。顶部两层被允许放松到最低能态配置，而底部两层保持在单晶Pt-Pt键长。使用了3×3×1蒙克霍斯特-帕克K点网格网格来确定电子能量。1,3-环己二烯吸附的优化配置如图3所示。

A 3×3 slab containing four metal layers was employed to simulate the adsorption of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) (1 adsorbate per unit cell). The top two layers were permitted to relax to the state of minimum energy, whereas the bottom two layers remained at a bulk Pt-Pt bond length, as previously detailed [4,8]. A 3×3×1 Monkhorst-Pack K-point grid mesh was utilized to ascertain the electronic energies. The optimized arrangement for 1,3-CHD adsorption is depicted in Figure 3.
