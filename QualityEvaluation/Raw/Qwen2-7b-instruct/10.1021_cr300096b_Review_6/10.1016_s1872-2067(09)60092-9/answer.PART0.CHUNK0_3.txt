<p>Figure 1 compares the consumption of 1,3-CHD and the formation of cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene as a function of reaction time at 308 K. Two hydrogenation prod- ucts, cyclohexene and cyclohexane, were detected over the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. With an increase in reaction time, cyclo- hexene is further hydrogenated and converted into cyclohex- ane. The Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst promotes both the partial hydro- genation of 1,3-CHD to cyclohexene and dehydrogenation to benzene although the consumption rate of 1,3-CHD is rela- tively slow. The result over Ni/γ-Al2O3 is consistent with the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-CHD over a Ni(100) surface as reported by Tjandra et al. [14].

<p>Figure 2 shows FT-IR spectra of different catalysts after the 1,3-CHD hydrogenation reaction and the intensities were normalized based on the number of metal sites. The vibrational features of the CH (3 032 cm1), CH2 (2 926 and 2 853 cm1), C=C (1 647 cm1), and CH3 (1 377 and 1 450 cm1) functional groups indicate that adsorption of the hydrocarbon intermedi- ates and fragments occurred on the surface of the catalysts.</p>
<p>As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]. Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8].</p>

The provided literature does not contain any information related to the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. There are no quotes or details available in the document to answer this question. The document focuses on the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene on Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts, comparing their activity with monometallic catalysts and correlating the findings with density functional theory calculations.
