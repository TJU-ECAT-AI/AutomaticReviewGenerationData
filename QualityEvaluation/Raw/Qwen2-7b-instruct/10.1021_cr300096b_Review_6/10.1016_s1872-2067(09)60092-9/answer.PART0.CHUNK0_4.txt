[1] "The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-CHD, leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst."
[2] "The surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure shows the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen, which promotes the dehydrogenation pathway."

The experimental findings suggest that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD), resulting in the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst. Conversely, the surface Ni-Pt-Pt structure exhibits the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen, which facilitates the dehydrogenation pathway.

实验结果表明，亚表面Pt-Ni-Pt结构对1,3-环己二烯（1,3-CHD）具有最低的吸附能，导致Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂上的最高氢化速率。相反，表面Ni-Pt-Pt结构对1,3-CHD和原子氢具有最高的吸附能，促进脱氢途径。
