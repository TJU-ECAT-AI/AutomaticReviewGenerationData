<p>Combined experimental and DFT results indicate that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-CHD, leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst.</p>
<p>By comparison, the surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure shows the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen, promoting the dehydrogenation pathway.</p>

This study highlights that the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher reaction rates than the Pt and Ni monometallic catalysts due to the unique subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt and surface Ni-Pt-Pt structures. These structures contribute to the differences in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities, with the former showing lower binding energies for 1,3-cyclohexadiene and thus higher hydrogenation rates, while the latter exhibits higher binding energies, facilitating the dehydrogenation pathway.

这项研究强调，与单金属催化剂相比，Pt-Ni双金属催化剂的反应速率更高，这归因于独特的子表面Pt-Ni-Pt和表面Ni-Pt-Pt结构。这些结构导致了氢化和脱氢活性的不同，前者表现出更低的1,3-环己二烯结合能和更高的氢化速率，而后者则促进了脱氢途径的进行。
