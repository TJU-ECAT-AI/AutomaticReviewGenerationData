<p>Two hydrogenation products, cyclohexene and cyclohexane, were detected over the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. With an increase in reaction time, cyclohexene is further hydrogenated and converted into cyclohexane. The Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst promotes both the partial hydrogenation of 1,3-CHD to cyclohexene and dehydrogenation to benzene although the consumption rate of 1,3-CHD is relatively slow.</p>
<p>The result over Ni/γ-Al2O3 is consistent with the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-CHD over a Ni(100) surface as reported by Tjandra et al. [14].</p>
<p>By comparison, the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-CHD over Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 are different from those of the monometallic catalysts. Both cyclohexane and benzene are produced at a much faster initial rate.</p>
<p>Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111). Two types of bimetallic surfaces were investigated, the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface structure with a monolayer of Ni residing on top of Pt(111) and the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) configuration with one monolayer of Ni between the first and second layers of Pt.</p>
<p>As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111).</p>
<p>Another interesting observation in Table 2 is that the binding energies of 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are higher on the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111) suggesting that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure should be more thermodynamically favored than the parent metals for the dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that reactions of 1,3-CHD are complicated because of the simultaneous hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways, making it more difficult to correlate binding energies and catalytic activities.</p>

The experimental techniques utilized in the study included comparing the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) over Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts with those over monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. It was observed that the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst showed higher activity, producing both cyclohexane and benzene at a faster initial rate compared to the monometallic catalysts. The DFT calculations indicated that the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen were lower on the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) structure than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111), correlating with the enhanced hydrogenation activity of the bimetallic catalyst.

研究中采用的技术包括比较了1,3-环己二烯（1,3-CHD）在Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂上的氢化和脱氢活性与单金属Pt和Ni催化剂的活性。结果发现，Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂表现出更高的活性，以更快的初始速率产生环己烷和苯。DFT计算表明，1,3-CHD和原子氢的结合能较低Pt-Ni-Pt(111)结构上比Pt(111)或Ni(111)，这与双金属催化剂的增强氢化活性相吻合。
