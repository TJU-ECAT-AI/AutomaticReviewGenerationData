<p>The main objective of the present work is to investigate the support effect on PtCo bimetallic and the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the low-temperature hydrogenation of benzene to expand our previous experimental and theoretical investigations on the PtCo bimetallic catalysts. Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and activated carbon (AC) supported PtCo bimetallic and Co and Pt monometallic catalysts were studied for the hydrogenation of benzene.</p>
<p>The observation of enhanced hydrogenation activity over PtCo is consistent with the fact that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts.</p>
<p>The bridging of the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts has always been a challenge, with one reason being that supported catalysts often exhibit different catalytic performance depending on the nature of the support materials.</p>
<p>For the pure cobalt oxide (Co3O4), there were two major peaks around 700 K ascribed to the successive reduction of bulk Co3O4 to CoO to Co in the H2-TPR profile.</p>
<p>Results from the flow reactor studies showed that the activated carbon supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibited much higher conversion than the others, and that all the bimetallic catalysts exhibited higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts on the same support.</p>

1. The main goal of the current research is to explore the impact of different supports on PtCo bimetallic and monometallic catalysts for low-temperature benzene hydrogenation, building upon previous experimental and theoretical studies on PtCo bimetallic catalysts. The catalysts supported on Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, and activated carbon (AC) were evaluated for benzene hydrogenation.

2. The enhanced hydrogenation activity observed over PtCo is in line with the notion that bimetallic catalysts typically exhibit distinct properties compared to their monometallic counterparts.

3. The challenge in connecting model surfaces with supported catalysts lies partly in the varied catalytic performance of supported catalysts, which depends on the nature of the support materials.

4. For pure cobalt oxide (Co3O4), the H2-TPR profile showed two significant peaks at around 700 K, indicative of the sequential reduction stages of Co3O4 to CoO to Co.

5. The flow reactor studies revealed that the PtCo bimetallic catalysts supported on activated carbon had notably higher conversion rates compared to other supports, and all bimetallic catalysts showed superior performance to their monometallic equivalents on the same support.

6. The apparent activation barriers for the benzene hydrogenation process were estimated across different supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts, as depicted in Figure 8 and detailed in Table 4.

1. 当前研究的主要目标是通过扩展之前对PtCo双金属催化剂的实验和理论调查，探索不同支持材料对PtCo双金属和单金属催化剂在低温下氢化苯的影响。在Al2O3、SiO2、TiO2和支持活性炭（AC）上制备的催化剂用于评估苯的氢化。

2. 观察到的PtCo双金属催化剂的增强氢化活性与双金属催化剂通常表现出与相应单金属催化剂明显不同的性质这一事实相一致。

3. 在将模型表面与支持催化剂之间的材料差距进行连接时，部分原因在于支持催化剂的催化性能会因支撑材料的性质而变化。

4. 对于纯钴氧化物（Co3O4），H2-TPR图谱显示了约700 K处的两个显著峰，对应于Co3O4向CoO再到Co的连续还原阶段。

5. 流动反应器研究表明，支持在活性炭上的PtCo双金属催化剂的转化率远高于其他支持材料，所有双金属催化剂在其相同支持材料上的性能均优于相应的单金属催化剂。

6. 通过图8和表4详细列出的不同支持的PtCo双金属催化剂，估计了苯氢化过程的显性活化能壁垒。
