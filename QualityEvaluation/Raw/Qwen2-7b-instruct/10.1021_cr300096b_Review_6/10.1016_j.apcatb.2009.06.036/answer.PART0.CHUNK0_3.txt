<p>The observation of enhanced hydrogenation activity over PtCo is consistent with the fact that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [41] ,[42] ,[43] ,[44] ,[45] .</p>
<p>For example, the CO uptake value for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/AC bimetallic catalyst is 395 μmol/g catalyst, which is much higher than the sum of uptake from the two monometallic catalysts, 96.7 and 9.9 μmol/g catalyst for 10%Co/AC and 1.2%Pt/AC, respectively.</p>
<p>The extent of bimetallic formation appears to be different on the different supports. As shown in the EXAFS results in Table 3 , on Al2O3 and SiO2 most of the Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are surrounded by Co atoms to form the PtCo bimetallic bonds, but there are less PtCo bonds for the PtCo/TiO2 catalyst.</p>
<p>However, the detection of the PtCo CN value of 4.9 in the EXAFS measurements qualitatively confirms the formation of the PtCo bond on AC.</p>

1. Bimetallic catalysts often exhibit distinct properties compared to their monometallic counterparts, as evidenced by the enhanced hydrogenation activity over PtCo.

2. The 1.2%Pt10%Co/AC bimetallic catalyst has a significantly higher CO uptake capacity (395 μmol/g) compared to the sum of the monometallic catalysts' capacities (96.7 + 9.9 μmol/g).

3. The extent of bimetallic formation varies across different supports. Most Pt atoms in bimetallic catalysts on Al2O3 and SiO2 form PtCo bonds, whereas there are fewer PtCo bonds in the PtCo/TiO2 catalyst.

4. The EXAFS analysis qualitatively confirms the formation of the PtCo bond on activated carbon (AC), as indicated by the PtCo coordination number of 4.9.

1. 双金属催化剂通常显示出与单一金属催化剂截然不同的特性，这在铂钴系统的氢化活性增强中得到了证实。

2. 1.2%Pt10%Co/AC双金属催化剂的CO吸附能力（395 μmol/g）远高于两种单金属催化剂的总和（96.7 + 9.9 μmol/g）。

3. 不同的支撑材料上，双金属形成的程度有所不同。在氧化铝和二氧化硅上，大部分铂原子形成了Pt-Co双金属键，而TiO2上的PtCo键形成较少。

4. EXAFS分析定性地证实了AC上的PtCo键形成，这是通过PtCo配位数为4.9来表示的。
