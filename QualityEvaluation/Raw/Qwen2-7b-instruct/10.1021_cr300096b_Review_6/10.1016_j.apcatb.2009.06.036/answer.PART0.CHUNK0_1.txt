The experimental technique of Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR) was used to study the reducibility of the calcined PtCo bimetallic and Co monometallic catalysts, and the results are illustrated in Figure 4. The extent of bimetallic formation varies across different supports. The EXAFS analysis quantitatively confirms the presence of the PtCo bond on activated carbon (AC) by detecting a PtCo coordination number (CN) value of 4.9.
