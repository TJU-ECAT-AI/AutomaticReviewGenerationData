1. In each experiment, the flow reactor contained either 50 mg of bimetallic catalyst or 100 mg of monometallic catalyst, both with 6080 mesh size.
2. The reducibility of the catalysts was assessed through TPR, as illustrated in Figure 4.
3. The activated carbon-supported PtCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrated notably higher conversion rates compared to other catalysts, and all bimetallic catalysts showed superior conversion rates than their respective monometallic counterparts on the same support.
4. CO chemisorption studies were conducted utilizing the Micromeritics ASAP2010C apparatus.
5. The EXAFS results indicated that on Al2O3 and SiO2, the majority of Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts were bonded with Co atoms to form PtCo bimetallic bonds, whereas the PtCo bonds were less prevalent in the PtCo/TiO2 catalyst.

1. 每个实验中，流反应器内包含50毫克的双金属催化剂或100毫克的单金属催化剂，均具有6080网孔大小。
2. 催化剂的可还原性通过TPR进行评估，并在图4中展示。
3. 活性碳支持的PtCo双金属催化剂表现出显著更高的转化率，所有双金属催化剂在相同支撑下的转化率均优于其对应的单金属催化剂。
4. 利用Micromeritics ASAP2010C设备进行了CO化学吸附研究。
5. EXAFS结果表明，在Al2O3和SiO2上，双金属催化剂中的大多数Pt原子与Co原子形成PtCo双金属键，而在PtCo/TiO2催化剂中PtCo键较少。
