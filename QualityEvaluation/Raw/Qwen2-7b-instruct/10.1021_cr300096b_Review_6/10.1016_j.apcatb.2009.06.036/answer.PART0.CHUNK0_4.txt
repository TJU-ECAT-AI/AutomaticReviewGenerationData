<p>Overall, catalyst supports strongly affect the catalytic activities of both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The results show that activated carbon supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit the best performance among all as-prepared bimetallic and monometallic catalysts, which is mostly attributed to the PtCo bimetallic formation and the very high CO chemisorption capacity. Furthermore, for all the supports, PtCo bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, supporting the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds would result in higher hydrogenation activity than that of either Pt or Co.</p>

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems typically involve High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). HREELS is employed to determine the kinetic profiles and activation barriers associated with the segregation of these atoms. By analyzing the spectral changes over time, researchers can deduce the rates at which atoms segregate from the bulk to the surface. AES, on the other hand, offers insights into the chemical state and surface composition by measuring the secondary electrons emitted when an atom is excited by an incident electron beam. Comparisons between the experimental data obtained from HREELS and AES and the theoretical predictions from Density Functional Theory (DFT) are crucial for validating the accuracy of computational models and understanding the underlying mechanisms of surface segregation.

验证和量化由氧诱导的表面分离（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的实验技术通常涉及高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和原子发射光谱（AES）。通过分析随时间变化的光谱，研究人员可以推断出原子从基体到表面的分离速率。当原子受到入射电子束激发时，AES提供了有关化学状态和表面组成的见解，通过测量二次电子的发射。通过将从HREELS和AES获得的实验数据与基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的预测进行比较，研究人员可以验证计算模型的准确性并理解表面分离的机制。
