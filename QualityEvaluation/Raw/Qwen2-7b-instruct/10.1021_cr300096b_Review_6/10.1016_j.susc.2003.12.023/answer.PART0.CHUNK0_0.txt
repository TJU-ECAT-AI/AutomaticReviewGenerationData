<p>The islands show strong anisotropic shapes with an elongation along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. Island edges are very straight over several 100 nm and run along the rows of the reconstruction. Furthermore, it appears that the islands preferentially terminate along the troughs of the reconstruction.</p>
<p>Since the hex-reconstructed layer contains 2025% more Pt atoms than the (1 0 0) layer, a stoichiometry of approximately Ag80Pt20 is expected for the 2D adislands. This is in good agreement with STM images if one assumes that Pt is imaged darker.</p>
<p>We can construct the scenario that is displayed schematically in Fig. 2 from the STM data. At room temperature, nucleation of adislands on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface proceeds by lifting of the hex-reconstruction. This provides additional Pt that is incorporated into the growing islands to form a disordered alloy with a composition close to Pt20Ag80.</p>
<p>For CO adsorption on Pt(1 0 0)-hex, it was determined that 45 CO molecules were necessary to nucleate the lifting of the reconstruction which involves 810 Pt substrate atoms.</p>
<p>Annealing of submonolayer-Ag deposits on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface to 600 K for 10 s results in a change of the surface morphology compared to that obtained following deposition. STM images characterizing such annealed surfaces are displayed in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces.</p>
<p>Two processes for Ag diffusion are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature: (i) Site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layer, respectively, and (ii) vacancy mediated bulk diffusion processes of Ag in the subsurface region.</p>

1. The islands display strong anisotropic shapes elongated along the hex-reconstruction rows, with very straight edges running along the rows and terminating along the troughs. The islands' stoichiometry is expected to be Ag80Pt20 due to the hex-reconstruction's higher Pt atom density.
2. The islands' anisotropic shape and termination along the troughs suggest a driving force responsible for lifting the reconstruction beneath the islands, leading to an island growth mechanism.
3. The lifting of the reconstruction requires 45 CO molecules, involving 810 Pt substrate atoms.
4. Annealing at 600 K transforms the surface morphology, forming a nanophasic AgPt alloy that starts at the adisland perimeters and spreads across the surface.
5. The Ag diffusion processes at elevated temperatures involve site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layers and vacancy-mediated bulk diffusion.

1. 岛屿显示出强烈的各向异性形状，沿六边形重构行方向延伸，边缘非常笔直，沿着行运行，并终止在凹槽处。岛屿的组成预计为Ag80Pt20，因为六边形重构层比（1 0 0）层多含20%-25%的Pt原子。
2. 岛屿的各向异性形状和沿凹槽终止表明，负责在岛屿下方提升重构的动力，导致岛屿生长机制。
3. 在600 K时的退火使表面形态发生变化，形成一个纳米相态的AgPt合金，从岛屿边缘开始形成并向表面扩散。
4. 升高温度下的Ag扩散过程涉及第一和第二层之间的Ag和Pt位置交换以及空位介导的Ag在次表面区域的扩散。
