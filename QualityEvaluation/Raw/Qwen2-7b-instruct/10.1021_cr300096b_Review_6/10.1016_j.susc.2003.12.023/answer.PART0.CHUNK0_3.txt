<p>Experiments were performed in an UHV chamber that was equipped with a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for AES, rear-view low energy electron diffraction (LEED) optics, a quadrupole mass spectrometer for residual gas analysis and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), homebuilt single-piezo-tube STM, ion-gun for sample cleaning, resistively heated Ag-evaporation source, and precision-leak valves for gas dosing [22] . For AES, the CMA and its coaxial electron gun were positioned normal to the sample surface.</p>
<p>The cleanliness of the sample was monitored by AES and the procedure was repeated until no contamination at the surface could be detected. The Ag-evaporation rate was calibrated by AES uptake plots on samples that were annealed to 800 K following each deposition cycle in which AES signals were recorded as a function of the Ag-deposition time.</p>
<p>STM images after the deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ag on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface reveal extended 2D islands, as shown in Fig. 1 . These islands are separated by the hex-reconstructed Pt substrate. The islands show strong anisotropic shapes with an elongation along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. Island edges are very straight over several 100 nm and run along the rows of the reconstruction.</p>
<p>At room temperature, nucleation of adislands on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface proceeds by lifting of the hex-reconstruction. This provides additional Pt that is incorporated into the growing islands to form a disordered alloy with a composition close to Pt20Ag80.</p>
<p>In this case, the Ag signal decreased by 10% from its initial value at 300 K after heating to 850 K for a constant heating rate of 1 K/s. If the sample was immediately cooled after reaching 850 K with a constant cooling rate, the Ag intensity kept decreasing for a small temperature range but then started to increase again.</p>
<p>For low initial Ag coverages, no significant change in the AES signal was observed, indicating that there is no substantial Ag diffusion into the subsurface region even at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>One can argue that Ag and Pt can sufficiently disorder in the surface layer to increase configurational entropy at low Ag coverages and therefore no significant change in the AES signal was observed on such samples.</p>
<p>For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, on the other hand, intermixing of Ag and Pt between the surface layer and the Pt substrate has to occur to increase configurational disorder in the surface layer. Consequently, Ag diffuses into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal and the Ag AES-signal decreases with increasing temperature.</p>

1. AES, LEED optics, and a quadrupole mass spectrometer were used for monitoring the cleanliness of the sample. The Ag-evaporation rate was calibrated using AES uptake plots on samples annealed to 800 K.

2. STM images showed extended 2D islands with anisotropic shapes on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface after deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ag. The islands had elongated edges aligned with the rows of the hex-reconstruction.

3. Room temperature deposition of Ag on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface resulted in the lifting of the hex-reconstruction, providing additional Pt for incorporation into the growing islands forming a disordered alloy with a composition close to Pt20Ag80.

4. AES studies revealed that at high temperatures, the Ag signal decreased after heating, suggesting some mixing of Ag with the second and bulk layers of the crystal. The signal decreased continuously at higher temperatures and showed a slight hysteresis during heating and cooling cycles.

5. For low initial Ag coverages, no significant change in the AES signal was observed, indicating limited Ag diffusion into the subsurface region even at elevated temperatures.

6. At low Ag coverages, Ag and Pt can sufficiently disorder in the surface layer to increase configurational entropy, resulting in no significant change in the AES signal. For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, intermixing of Ag and Pt occurs between the surface layer and the Pt substrate, causing Ag diffusion into the subsurface region and decreasing the AES signal with increasing temperature.

1. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、后视低能电子衍射（LEED）光学和四极质谱仪用于监测样品的清洁度。通过在800 K下退火并记录Ag沉积时间与AES信号的关系，对Ag蒸发速率进行了校准。

2. STM图像显示，在Pt(1 0 0)-hex表面上沉积亚单层量的Ag后，形成了具有各向异性形状的扩展二维岛屿。岛屿边缘呈直线状，并沿六边形重构的行排列。

3. 在室温下，Ag在Pt(1 0 0)-hex表面上的沉积通过提升六边形重构进行，提供了额外的Pt，用于形成包含接近Pt20Ag80组成的比例无序合金的岛屿。

4. 高温下AES研究发现，加热后Ag信号减少了10%，表明Ag可能与第二层和晶体内层混合。在较高温度下加热时，信号持续减少，并在加热和冷却循环过程中显示出轻微的滞后现象。

5. 对于较低初始Ag覆盖度，没有观察到显著的AES信号变化，表明即使在高温下，Ag也几乎没有扩散进入内层区域。

6. 对于较低的Ag覆盖度，Ag和Pt可以在表面层充分混乱以增加配置熵，因此在这些样本上没有观察到显著的AES信号变化。对于伪形貌化的Ag单层，Ag和Pt之间的混合发生在表面层和Pt基体之间，导致Ag扩散进入内层区域，并随着温度升高而降低AES信号。
