[1] "Initial Ag growth on Pt(1 0 0)-hex at 300 K is strongly influenced by the surface reconstruction of the Pt crystal. Adisland-growth proceeds in elongated structures along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. We explain this growth mode by an anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction."
[2] "Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces."
[3] "AES indicates limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures."

The literature describes how experimental techniques such as AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES technique measures the changes in atomic concentrations at the surface as a function of temperature, revealing the extent of segregation. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions by providing insights into the energetics and dynamics of the segregation process. The anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction on the Pt(1 0 0) surface influences the growth mode of adislands, leading to elongated structures. Annealing above 600 K facilitates the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy, where Ag from the adislands exchanges places with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces. AES studies further indicate limited dissolution of Ag into the bulk Pt phase under prolonged heating at elevated temperatures. These findings suggest that the surface segregation and alloy formation processes are governed by the balance of energies and diffusion barriers within the bimetallic system.

文献描述了如何使用AES技术验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中由氧气诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。AES技术通过测量随温度变化的表面原子浓度，揭示分层的程度。所测得的分层动力学和活化势垒与DFT预测进行比较，提供关于分层过程能量和动力学的见解。在Pt(1 0 0)表面上，六边形重建的各向异性稳定性影响了adisland生长模式，导致沿六边形重构行的长条状结构。超过600 K的退火促进了AgPt纳米相合金的形成，在这个过程中，adisland中的Ag与相邻较低台阶上的Pt进行交换。AES研究进一步表明，在较高温度下长时间加热时，Ag仅有限溶解到基体Pt相中。这些发现表明，表面分层和合金形成过程受系统内部的能量和扩散壁垒的调控。
