<p>The islands show strong anisotropic shapes with an elongation along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. Island edges are very straight over several 100 nm and run along the rows of the reconstruction. Furthermore, it appears that the islands preferentially terminate along the troughs of the reconstruction.</p>
<p>Since the hex-reconstructed layer contains 2025% more Pt atoms than the (1 0 0) layer, a stoichiometry of approximately Ag80Pt20 is expected for the 2D adislands. This is in good agreement with STM images if one assumes that Pt is imaged darker.</p>
<p>We can construct the scenario that is displayed schematically in Fig. 2 from the STM data. At room temperature, nucleation of adislands on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface proceeds by lifting of the hex-reconstruction. This provides additional Pt that is incorporated into the growing islands to form a disordered alloy with a composition close to Pt20Ag80.</p>
<p>For CO adsorption on Pt(1 0 0)-hex, it was determined that 45 CO molecules were necessary to nucleate the lifting of the reconstruction which involves 810 Pt substrate atoms.</p>
<p>Annealing of submonolayer-Ag deposits on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface to 600 K for 10 s results in a change of the surface morphology compared to that obtained following deposition. STM images characterizing such annealed surfaces are displayed in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces.</p>
<p>Two processes for Ag diffusion are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature: (i) Site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layer, respectively, and (ii) vacancy mediated bulk diffusion processes of Ag in the subsurface region.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The islands display strong anisotropic shapes elongated along the hex-reconstruction rows, with very straight edges running along the rows and terminating along the troughs. The islands' stoichiometry is expected to be Ag80Pt20 due to the hex-reconstruction's higher Pt atom density.
2. The islands' anisotropic shape and termination along the troughs suggest a driving force responsible for lifting the reconstruction beneath the islands, leading to an island growth mechanism.
3. The lifting of the reconstruction requires 45 CO molecules, involving 810 Pt substrate atoms.
4. Annealing at 600 K transforms the surface morphology, forming a nanophasic AgPt alloy that starts at the adisland perimeters and spreads across the surface.
5. The Ag diffusion processes at elevated temperatures involve site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layers and vacancy-mediated bulk diffusion.

1. 岛屿显示出强烈的各向异性形状，沿六边形重构行方向延伸，边缘非常笔直，沿着行运行，并终止在凹槽处。岛屿的组成预计为Ag80Pt20，因为六边形重构层比（1 0 0）层多含20%-25%的Pt原子。
2. 岛屿的各向异性形状和沿凹槽终止表明，负责在岛屿下方提升重构的动力，导致岛屿生长机制。
3. 在600 K时的退火使表面形态发生变化，形成一个纳米相态的AgPt合金，从岛屿边缘开始形成并向表面扩散。
4. 升高温度下的Ag扩散过程涉及第一和第二层之间的Ag和Pt位置交换以及空位介导的Ag在次表面区域的扩散。

1. The islands exhibit anisotropic shapes, elongating along the rows of the hex-reconstruction, with straight edges running along these rows and terminating along the troughs. The stoichiometry of the 2D islands is approximately Ag80Pt20 due to the hex-reconstruction having 20-25% more Pt atoms than the (1 0 0) layer.

2. Annealing to 600 K leads to the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy around the perimeters of the islands, spreading across the surface by exchanging Ag from the islands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces.

3. At 800 K, the AES signal decreases, suggesting diffusion of Ag into the bulk or clustering on the surface. This process is reversible upon cooling.

4. For low Ag coverages, there is no significant change in the AES signal, indicating limited Ag diffusion into the subsurface region at elevated temperatures.

5. For a pseudomorphic Ag monolayer, Ag diffuses into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal, leading to a decrease in the AES signal with increasing temperature.

6. The AES signal changes almost reversibly with heating and cooling at 1 ML Ag coverage, suggesting site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layers, which is a fast, entropy-driven process.

7. There is limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures, as indicated by the AES measurements.

8. The AES signal decreases continuously at 800 K, explained by the continuous loss of Ag into the bulk, while at 850 K, a small loss of Ag by diffusion into the bulk also contributes to the observed hysteresis in the heating and cooling cycle.

1. 岛屿呈现出沿六边形重构晶面行的方向的各向异性形状，边缘非常笔直，沿着这些行延伸，并且倾向于终止在凹槽处。由于六边形重构层中的铂原子比（1 0 0）层多20-25%，预计2D岛屿的化学组成接近Ag80Pt20。

2. 将600 K加热10秒后，六边形重构表面的形态与沉积后相比发生了变化。

3. 在900 K下加热时，岛屿（或孔洞）没有合并，原因是合金被限制在表层。

4. 对于低初始银覆盖度，即使在高温下也没有观察到显著的银扩散进入亚表面区域。

5. 对于1 ML银覆盖度，AES信号随加热和冷却而变化，几乎可逆地变化，这表明第一和第二层中银和铂之间的位交换是一个快速、熵驱动的过程。

6. 随着温度升高，银的AES信号逐渐减少，这可能是因为银在基体内部扩散或在表面上聚集成簇。

7. 即使在较高温度下，也有少量银溶解到铂晶体内，这从AES测量结果中可以观察到。

8. 在800 K下，AES信号持续减少，解释为银不断向基体内部扩散；而在850 K下，一部分银通过扩散进入基体内部导致加热和冷却循环过程中出现了微小的滞后现象。

<p>Experiments were performed in an UHV chamber that was equipped with a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for AES, rear-view low energy electron diffraction (LEED) optics, a quadrupole mass spectrometer for residual gas analysis and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), homebuilt single-piezo-tube STM, ion-gun for sample cleaning, resistively heated Ag-evaporation source, and precision-leak valves for gas dosing [22] . For AES, the CMA and its coaxial electron gun were positioned normal to the sample surface.</p>
<p>The cleanliness of the sample was monitored by AES and the procedure was repeated until no contamination at the surface could be detected. The Ag-evaporation rate was calibrated by AES uptake plots on samples that were annealed to 800 K following each deposition cycle in which AES signals were recorded as a function of the Ag-deposition time.</p>
<p>STM images after the deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ag on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface reveal extended 2D islands, as shown in Fig. 1 . These islands are separated by the hex-reconstructed Pt substrate. The islands show strong anisotropic shapes with an elongation along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. Island edges are very straight over several 100 nm and run along the rows of the reconstruction.</p>
<p>At room temperature, nucleation of adislands on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface proceeds by lifting of the hex-reconstruction. This provides additional Pt that is incorporated into the growing islands to form a disordered alloy with a composition close to Pt20Ag80.</p>
<p>In this case, the Ag signal decreased by 10% from its initial value at 300 K after heating to 850 K for a constant heating rate of 1 K/s. If the sample was immediately cooled after reaching 850 K with a constant cooling rate, the Ag intensity kept decreasing for a small temperature range but then started to increase again.</p>
<p>For low initial Ag coverages, no significant change in the AES signal was observed, indicating that there is no substantial Ag diffusion into the subsurface region even at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>One can argue that Ag and Pt can sufficiently disorder in the surface layer to increase configurational entropy at low Ag coverages and therefore no significant change in the AES signal was observed on such samples.</p>
<p>For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, on the other hand, intermixing of Ag and Pt between the surface layer and the Pt substrate has to occur to increase configurational disorder in the surface layer. Consequently, Ag diffuses into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal and the Ag AES-signal decreases with increasing temperature.</p>

1. AES, LEED optics, and a quadrupole mass spectrometer were used for monitoring the cleanliness of the sample. The Ag-evaporation rate was calibrated using AES uptake plots on samples annealed to 800 K.

2. STM images showed extended 2D islands with anisotropic shapes on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface after deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ag. The islands had elongated edges aligned with the rows of the hex-reconstruction.

3. Room temperature deposition of Ag on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface resulted in the lifting of the hex-reconstruction, providing additional Pt for incorporation into the growing islands forming a disordered alloy with a composition close to Pt20Ag80.

4. AES studies revealed that at high temperatures, the Ag signal decreased after heating, suggesting some mixing of Ag with the second and bulk layers of the crystal. The signal decreased continuously at higher temperatures and showed a slight hysteresis during heating and cooling cycles.

5. For low initial Ag coverages, no significant change in the AES signal was observed, indicating limited Ag diffusion into the subsurface region even at elevated temperatures.

6. At low Ag coverages, Ag and Pt can sufficiently disorder in the surface layer to increase configurational entropy, resulting in no significant change in the AES signal. For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, intermixing of Ag and Pt occurs between the surface layer and the Pt substrate, causing Ag diffusion into the subsurface region and decreasing the AES signal with increasing temperature.

1. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、后视低能电子衍射（LEED）光学和四极质谱仪用于监测样品的清洁度。通过在800 K下退火并记录Ag沉积时间与AES信号的关系，对Ag蒸发速率进行了校准。

2. STM图像显示，在Pt(1 0 0)-hex表面上沉积亚单层量的Ag后，形成了具有各向异性形状的扩展二维岛屿。岛屿边缘呈直线状，并沿六边形重构的行排列。

3. 在室温下，Ag在Pt(1 0 0)-hex表面上的沉积通过提升六边形重构进行，提供了额外的Pt，用于形成包含接近Pt20Ag80组成的比例无序合金的岛屿。

4. 高温下AES研究发现，加热后Ag信号减少了10%，表明Ag可能与第二层和晶体内层混合。在较高温度下加热时，信号持续减少，并在加热和冷却循环过程中显示出轻微的滞后现象。

5. 对于较低初始Ag覆盖度，没有观察到显著的AES信号变化，表明即使在高温下，Ag也几乎没有扩散进入内层区域。

6. 对于较低的Ag覆盖度，Ag和Pt可以在表面层充分混乱以增加配置熵，因此在这些样本上没有观察到显著的AES信号变化。对于伪形貌化的Ag单层，Ag和Pt之间的混合发生在表面层和Pt基体之间，导致Ag扩散进入内层区域，并随着温度升高而降低AES信号。

[1] "Initial Ag growth on Pt(1 0 0)-hex at 300 K is strongly influenced by the surface reconstruction of the Pt crystal. Adisland-growth proceeds in elongated structures along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. We explain this growth mode by an anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction."

The literature describes how experimental techniques such as AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES technique measures the changes in atomic concentrations at the surface as a function of temperature, revealing the extent of segregation. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions by providing insights into the energetics and dynamics of the segregation process. The anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction on the Pt(1 0 0) surface influences the growth mode of adislands, leading to elongated structures. Annealing above 600 K facilitates the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy, where Ag from the adislands exchanges places with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces. AES studies further indicate limited dissolution of Ag into the bulk Pt phase under prolonged heating at elevated temperatures. These findings suggest that the surface segregation and alloy formation processes are governed by the balance of energies and diffusion barriers within the bimetallic system.

文献描述了如何使用AES技术验证和量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中由氧气诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。AES技术通过测量随温度变化的表面原子浓度，揭示分层的程度。所测得的分层动力学和活化势垒与DFT预测进行比较，提供关于分层过程能量和动力学的见解。在Pt(1 0 0)表面上，六边形重建的各向异性稳定性影响了adisland生长模式，导致沿六边形重构行的长条状结构。超过600 K的退火促进了AgPt纳米相合金的形成，在这个过程中，adisland中的Ag与相邻较低台阶上的Pt进行交换。AES研究进一步表明，在较高温度下长时间加热时，Ag仅有限溶解到基体Pt相中。这些发现表明，表面分层和合金形成过程受系统内部的能量和扩散壁垒的调控。
