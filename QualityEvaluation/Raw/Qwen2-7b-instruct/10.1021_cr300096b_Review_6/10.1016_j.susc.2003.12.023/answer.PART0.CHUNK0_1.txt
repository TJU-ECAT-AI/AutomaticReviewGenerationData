1. The islands exhibit anisotropic shapes, elongating along the rows of the hex-reconstruction, with straight edges running along these rows and terminating along the troughs. The stoichiometry of the 2D islands is approximately Ag80Pt20 due to the hex-reconstruction having 20-25% more Pt atoms than the (1 0 0) layer.

2. Annealing to 600 K leads to the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy around the perimeters of the islands, spreading across the surface by exchanging Ag from the islands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces.

3. At 800 K, the AES signal decreases, suggesting diffusion of Ag into the bulk or clustering on the surface. This process is reversible upon cooling.

4. For low Ag coverages, there is no significant change in the AES signal, indicating limited Ag diffusion into the subsurface region at elevated temperatures.

5. For a pseudomorphic Ag monolayer, Ag diffuses into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal, leading to a decrease in the AES signal with increasing temperature.

6. The AES signal changes almost reversibly with heating and cooling at 1 ML Ag coverage, suggesting site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layers, which is a fast, entropy-driven process.

7. There is limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures, as indicated by the AES measurements.

8. The AES signal decreases continuously at 800 K, explained by the continuous loss of Ag into the bulk, while at 850 K, a small loss of Ag by diffusion into the bulk also contributes to the observed hysteresis in the heating and cooling cycle.

1. 岛屿呈现出沿六边形重构晶面行的方向的各向异性形状，边缘非常笔直，沿着这些行延伸，并且倾向于终止在凹槽处。由于六边形重构层中的铂原子比（1 0 0）层多20-25%，预计2D岛屿的化学组成接近Ag80Pt20。

2. 将600 K加热10秒后，六边形重构表面的形态与沉积后相比发生了变化。

3. 在900 K下加热时，岛屿（或孔洞）没有合并，原因是合金被限制在表层。

4. 对于低初始银覆盖度，即使在高温下也没有观察到显著的银扩散进入亚表面区域。

5. 对于1 ML银覆盖度，AES信号随加热和冷却而变化，几乎可逆地变化，这表明第一和第二层中银和铂之间的位交换是一个快速、熵驱动的过程。

6. 随着温度升高，银的AES信号逐渐减少，这可能是因为银在基体内部扩散或在表面上聚集成簇。

7. 即使在较高温度下，也有少量银溶解到铂晶体内，这从AES测量结果中可以观察到。

8. 在800 K下，AES信号持续减少，解释为银不断向基体内部扩散；而在850 K下，一部分银通过扩散进入基体内部导致加热和冷却循环过程中出现了微小的滞后现象。
