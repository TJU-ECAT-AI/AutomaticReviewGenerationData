1. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were utilized to study the growth of silver films on the Pt(1 0 0) surface and the evolution of the structure with temperature increases.
2. At 300 K, elongated 2D islands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 were observed.
3. As the amount of Ag increases, Pt is replaced by Ag in the surface layer, leading to the formation of a complete pseudomorphic Ag layer.
4. AES studies revealed that there is reversible mixing of Ag with Pt at higher temperatures.

1. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和阿格电子能谱（AES）被用来研究银薄膜在Pt(1 0 0)表面上的生长以及随温度升高结构的变化。
2. 在300 K时，观察到由Ag80Pt20组成的延伸二维岛屿。
3. 随着Ag含量的增加，表面层中的Pt被Ag取代，形成完全的伪同质性Ag层。
4. AES研究表明，在较高温度下存在Ag与Pt的可逆混合。
