[1] "Overall, both DFT and experimental studies indicate that the activities toward the dissociation of H2 and ethylene follow the trend of ML Pt/W(110) < Pt(111) < W(110). The activity trend is consistent with the position of the average surface d-band center values for the three surfaces, in agreement with the general correlation that surfaces with d-band center further away from the Fermi level, such as in the case for Pt/W(110), should bond to adsorbates more weakly."
[2] "For the adsorption of ethylene, HREELS results revealed that ethylene bonded strongly on both Pt(111) and W(110) through the di-σ bonding configuration, leading to the dissociation to produce atomic carbon and H2. In contrast, ethylene interacted weakly on the ML Pt/W(110) surface through the π-bonded configuration, resulting in a lower activity toward the dissociation of ethylene as compared to either of the parent metal surfaces."
[3] "One possible explanation is that the metalO binding energy between oxygen-containing molecules and the bimetallic surface does not always follow the trend predicted from the d-band center. Another possibility is that the Pt/W(110) surface undergoes rearrangement upon the adsorption of oxygen-containing molecules."
[4] "This hypothesis is also supported by the observation of Madey et al. [17] that Pt clusters are formed upon exposure to oxygen at elevated temperatures. In the current study the Pt/W Auger ratio decreases by about  10% after TPD experiments up to 800 K."
[5] "Although the Pt/W Auger ratio can be affected due to the screening by adsorbed oxygen atoms from the decomposition of methanol or water, the observation of a decrease in the Pt/W ratio suggests that a fraction of the Pt overlayer undergoes clustering upon heating to 800 K."

To answer the question, the literature discusses several points regarding the behavior of Pt-W bimetallic surfaces in the decomposition of methanol and water, as well as the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and ethylene. The activities toward the dissociation of H2 and ethylene are shown to follow the trend of ML Pt/W(110) < Pt(111) < W(110), which is consistent with the positions of their average surface d-band center values. The literature also suggests that the metalO binding energy between oxygen-containing molecules and the bimetallic surface might not always follow the trend predicted by the d-band center. Furthermore, the presence of Pt on the W(110) surface leads to a synergistic effect in the dissociation of methanol, facilitating the production of methoxy via the cleavage of the OH bond, and promoting the subsequent decomposition of methoxy through the cleavage of the CH bonds. The Pt/W(110) surfaces retain activity in the dissociation of water, producing surface hydroxyl at 100 K, with the extent of dissociation decreasing as the Pt coverage increases. Lastly, the literature mentions that the Pt/W Auger ratio decreases by about 10% after TPD experiments up to 800 K, indicating that a fraction of the Pt overlayer undergoes clustering upon heating.

为回答这个问题，文献讨论了Pt-W双金属表面在甲醇和水分解以及氢和乙烷的离解吸附行为。H2和乙烷的分解活性遵循趋势为ML Pt/W(110) < Pt(111) < W(110)，这与它们表面平均d带中心值的位置一致。文献还表明，氧含分子与双金属表面之间的金属O结合能可能不会始终遵循由d带中心预测的趋势。此外，W(110)表面上的Pt的存在导致甲醇的协同效应分解，通过断裂OH键产生甲氧基，并通过断裂CH键促进甲氧基的后续分解。Pt/W(110)表面保持水分解活性，产生表面羟基在100 K，随着Pt覆盖度的增加，分解程度降低。最后，文献提到在800 K之前的TPD实验中，Pt/W Auger比率下降约10%，表明Pt覆盖层的一部分在加热后发生聚集。
