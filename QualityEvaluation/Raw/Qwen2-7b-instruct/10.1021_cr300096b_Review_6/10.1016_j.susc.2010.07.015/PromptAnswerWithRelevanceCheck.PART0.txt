How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<p>One possible explanation is that the metalO binding energy between oxygen-containing molecules and the bimetallic surface does not always follow the trend predicted from the d-band center. Another possibility is that the Pt/W(110) surface undergoes rearrangement upon the adsorption of oxygen-containing molecules.</p>

The presence of Pt modifies the activity and product selectivity towards the decomposition of methanol on W(110) surface. The Pt/W(110) surface retains the activity of W(110) towards the OH scission to produce methoxy. The presence of Pt is responsible for the facile cleavage of the CH bond of methoxy, which reduces the reaction pathway for the undesirable gas-phase CH4. The Pt/W(110) surface remains active towards the dissociation of water to produce surface hydroxyl at 100 K, with the extent of dissociation decreasing as the Pt coverage increases.

在W(110)表面上，Pt的存在改变了甲醇分解的活性和产物选择性。Pt/W(110)表面保留了W(110)表面对于OH断裂产生甲氧基的活性。Pt的存在负责容易地裂解甲氧基中的CH键，这减少了生成不希望的气体CH4的反应途径。在100 K时，Pt/W(110)表面仍然能够进行水分解以产生表面羟基，随着Pt覆盖度的增加，水分解的程度会降低。

[1] "Overall, both DFT and experimental studies indicate that the activities toward the dissociation of H2 and ethylene follow the trend of ML Pt/W(110) < Pt(111) < W(110). The activity trend is consistent with the position of the average surface d-band center values for the three surfaces, in agreement with the general correlation that surfaces with d-band center further away from the Fermi level, such as in the case for Pt/W(110), should bond to adsorbates more weakly."
[2] "For the adsorption of ethylene, HREELS results revealed that ethylene bonded strongly on both Pt(111) and W(110) through the di-σ bonding configuration, leading to the dissociation to produce atomic carbon and H2. In contrast, ethylene interacted weakly on the ML Pt/W(110) surface through the π-bonded configuration, resulting in a lower activity toward the dissociation of ethylene as compared to either of the parent metal surfaces."
[3] "One possible explanation is that the metalO binding energy between oxygen-containing molecules and the bimetallic surface does not always follow the trend predicted from the d-band center. Another possibility is that the Pt/W(110) surface undergoes rearrangement upon the adsorption of oxygen-containing molecules."
[4] "This hypothesis is also supported by the observation of Madey et al. [17] that Pt clusters are formed upon exposure to oxygen at elevated temperatures. In the current study the Pt/W Auger ratio decreases by about  10% after TPD experiments up to 800 K."
[5] "Although the Pt/W Auger ratio can be affected due to the screening by adsorbed oxygen atoms from the decomposition of methanol or water, the observation of a decrease in the Pt/W ratio suggests that a fraction of the Pt overlayer undergoes clustering upon heating to 800 K."

To answer the question, the literature discusses several points regarding the behavior of Pt-W bimetallic surfaces in the decomposition of methanol and water, as well as the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and ethylene. The activities toward the dissociation of H2 and ethylene are shown to follow the trend of ML Pt/W(110) < Pt(111) < W(110), which is consistent with the positions of their average surface d-band center values. The literature also suggests that the metalO binding energy between oxygen-containing molecules and the bimetallic surface might not always follow the trend predicted by the d-band center. Furthermore, the presence of Pt on the W(110) surface leads to a synergistic effect in the dissociation of methanol, facilitating the production of methoxy via the cleavage of the OH bond, and promoting the subsequent decomposition of methoxy through the cleavage of the CH bonds. The Pt/W(110) surfaces retain activity in the dissociation of water, producing surface hydroxyl at 100 K, with the extent of dissociation decreasing as the Pt coverage increases. Lastly, the literature mentions that the Pt/W Auger ratio decreases by about 10% after TPD experiments up to 800 K, indicating that a fraction of the Pt overlayer undergoes clustering upon heating.

为回答这个问题，文献讨论了Pt-W双金属表面在甲醇和水分解以及氢和乙烷的离解吸附行为。H2和乙烷的分解活性遵循趋势为ML Pt/W(110) < Pt(111) < W(110)，这与它们表面平均d带中心值的位置一致。文献还表明，氧含分子与双金属表面之间的金属O结合能可能不会始终遵循由d带中心预测的趋势。此外，W(110)表面上的Pt的存在导致甲醇的协同效应分解，通过断裂OH键产生甲氧基，并通过断裂CH键促进甲氧基的后续分解。Pt/W(110)表面保持水分解活性，产生表面羟基在100 K，随着Pt覆盖度的增加，分解程度降低。最后，文献提到在800 K之前的TPD实验中，Pt/W Auger比率下降约10%，表明Pt覆盖层的一部分在加热后发生聚集。

To verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are employed. HREELS can monitor the changes in vibrational frequencies of adsorbed molecules upon exposure to oxygen, which may indicate the presence of oxygen-induced surface segregation. AES, on the other hand, can detect changes in the elemental composition of the surface, providing insights into the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. The measured data are compared with DFT predictions to validate the theoretical models and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

The segregation kinetics and activation barriers for oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems can vary. The DFT predictions provide a theoretical framework to estimate these parameters, but discrepancies between theory and experiment may arise due to various factors such as the complexity of real surface interactions, the presence of additional chemical species, or limitations in the computational models. These discrepancies highlight the importance of combining experimental and computational approaches to fully understand the behavior of bimetallic systems under different conditions.

为了验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导的次表面3d原子表面分离，使用了HREELS和AES等实验技术。HREELS可以通过监测吸附分子在暴露于氧气后的振动频率变化来追踪表面分离现象。AES则可以检测表面元素组成的变化，提供关于分离动力学和激活能垒的线索。通过将测量数据与DFT预测进行比较，可以验证理论模型的有效性并深入了解基本机制。

Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的氧诱导表面分离的动力学和激活能垒可能会有所不同。DFT预测提供了理论框架来估算这些参数，但理论与实验之间的差异可能由于多种因素引起，如真实表面相互作用的复杂性、额外化学物种的存在或计算模型的局限性。这些差异强调了结合实验和计算方法以全面理解不同条件下的双金属体系行为的重要性。

The studies by Madey et al. showed that when Pt is grown layer-by-layer on W(110) at room temperature, it transforms into Pt particles upon exposure to oxygen at higher temperatures. The Pt/W(110) bimetallic surfaces retain their activity for the dissociation of water at 100 K, producing surface hydroxyl. However, the extent of this dissociation decreases with an increase in the Pt coverage.

Madey等人进行的研究表明，在室温下在W(110)上生长的层状Pt在高温度下暴露于氧气时会转化为Pt颗粒。Pt/W(110)双金属表面在100 K下仍能保持水的分解活性，产生表面羟基。然而，随着Pt覆盖度的增加，这种分解的量会减少。
