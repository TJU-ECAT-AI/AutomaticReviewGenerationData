<p>One possible explanation is that the metalO binding energy between oxygen-containing molecules and the bimetallic surface does not always follow the trend predicted from the d-band center. Another possibility is that the Pt/W(110) surface undergoes rearrangement upon the adsorption of oxygen-containing molecules.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of Pt modifies the activity and product selectivity towards the decomposition of methanol on W(110) surface. The Pt/W(110) surface retains the activity of W(110) towards the OH scission to produce methoxy. The presence of Pt is responsible for the facile cleavage of the CH bond of methoxy, which reduces the reaction pathway for the undesirable gas-phase CH4. The Pt/W(110) surface remains active towards the dissociation of water to produce surface hydroxyl at 100 K, with the extent of dissociation decreasing as the Pt coverage increases.

在W(110)表面上，Pt的存在改变了甲醇分解的活性和产物选择性。Pt/W(110)表面保留了W(110)表面对于OH断裂产生甲氧基的活性。Pt的存在负责容易地裂解甲氧基中的CH键，这减少了生成不希望的气体CH4的反应途径。在100 K时，Pt/W(110)表面仍然能够进行水分解以产生表面羟基，随着Pt覆盖度的增加，水分解的程度会降低。
