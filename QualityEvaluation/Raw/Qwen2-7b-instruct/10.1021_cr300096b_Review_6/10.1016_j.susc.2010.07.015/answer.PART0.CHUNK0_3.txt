[1] "Furthermore, previous studies by Madey et al. [13], [17] revealed that uniform layer-by-layer growth of Pt on W(110) transformed into Pt particles after exposure to oxygen at elevated temperatures."
[2] "The Pt/W(110) surfaces remain active toward the dissociation of water to produce surface hydroxyl at 100 K, with the extent of dissociation decreasing as the Pt coverage increases."

The studies by Madey et al. showed that when Pt is grown layer-by-layer on W(110) at room temperature, it transforms into Pt particles upon exposure to oxygen at higher temperatures. The Pt/W(110) bimetallic surfaces retain their activity for the dissociation of water at 100 K, producing surface hydroxyl. However, the extent of this dissociation decreases with an increase in the Pt coverage.

Madey等人进行的研究表明，在室温下在W(110)上生长的层状Pt在高温度下暴露于氧气时会转化为Pt颗粒。Pt/W(110)双金属表面在100 K下仍能保持水的分解活性，产生表面羟基。然而，随着Pt覆盖度的增加，这种分解的量会减少。
