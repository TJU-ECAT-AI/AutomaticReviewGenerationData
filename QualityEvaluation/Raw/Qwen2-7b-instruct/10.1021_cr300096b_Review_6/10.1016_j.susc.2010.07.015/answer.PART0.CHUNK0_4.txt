[1] "DFT calculations show that the binding energies of methanol, methoxy, water, and hydroxyl species on Pt/W(110) should be either stronger than or similar to those on Pt(111) ( Table 1 )."
[2] "Experimentally, the activities toward both molecules follow the trend of Pt(111) < ML Pt/W(110) < W(110)."
[3] "The Pt/W(110) surface retains the activity of W(110) toward the OH scission to produce methoxy; the presence of surface Pt is likely responsible for the facile cleavage of the CH bond of methoxy."
