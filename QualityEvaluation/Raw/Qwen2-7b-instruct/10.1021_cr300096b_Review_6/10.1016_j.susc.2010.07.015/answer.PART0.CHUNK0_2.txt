[1] "Overall, both DFT and experimental studies indicate that the activities toward the dissociation of H2 and ethylene follow the trend of ML Pt/W(110) < Pt(111) < W(110)."
[2] "One possible explanation is that the metalO binding energy between oxygen-containing molecules and the bimetallic surface does not always follow the trend predicted from the d-band center."
[3] "Another possibility is that the Pt/W(110) surface undergoes rearrangement upon the adsorption of oxygen-containing molecules."
[4] "For the adsorption of ethylene, HREELS results revealed that ethylene bonded strongly on both Pt(111) and W(110) through the di-σ bonding configuration, leading to the dissociation to produce atomic carbon and H2."
[5] "In comparison, results in the current study indicate that the activities toward the dissociation of methanol and water do not follow the same trend."

To verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are employed. HREELS can monitor the changes in vibrational frequencies of adsorbed molecules upon exposure to oxygen, which may indicate the presence of oxygen-induced surface segregation. AES, on the other hand, can detect changes in the elemental composition of the surface, providing insights into the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. The measured data are compared with DFT predictions to validate the theoretical models and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

The segregation kinetics and activation barriers for oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems can vary. The DFT predictions provide a theoretical framework to estimate these parameters, but discrepancies between theory and experiment may arise due to various factors such as the complexity of real surface interactions, the presence of additional chemical species, or limitations in the computational models. These discrepancies highlight the importance of combining experimental and computational approaches to fully understand the behavior of bimetallic systems under different conditions.

为了验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导的次表面3d原子表面分离，使用了HREELS和AES等实验技术。HREELS可以通过监测吸附分子在暴露于氧气后的振动频率变化来追踪表面分离现象。AES则可以检测表面元素组成的变化，提供关于分离动力学和激活能垒的线索。通过将测量数据与DFT预测进行比较，可以验证理论模型的有效性并深入了解基本机制。

Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的氧诱导表面分离的动力学和激活能垒可能会有所不同。DFT预测提供了理论框架来估算这些参数，但理论与实验之间的差异可能由于多种因素引起，如真实表面相互作用的复杂性、额外化学物种的存在或计算模型的局限性。这些差异强调了结合实验和计算方法以全面理解不同条件下的双金属体系行为的重要性。
