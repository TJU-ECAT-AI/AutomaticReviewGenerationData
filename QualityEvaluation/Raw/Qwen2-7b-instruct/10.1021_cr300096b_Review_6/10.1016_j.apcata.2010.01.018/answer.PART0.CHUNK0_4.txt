Experimental techniques like AES are used to monitor and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES peak-to-peak heights of Au and Pt, along with their ratio, are measured during Au deposition on a Pt foil. This helps correlate the Au coverage on the Pt surface with the AES peak ratio of Au to Pt features. AES measurements are also taken as a function of deposition time and after thermal annealing to assess the stability of the Au/Pt surface.

实验技术如AES用于监测和量化氧诱导的表面掺杂，特别是Ni和Co在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面扩散。通过测量Au和Pt的峰峰值高度及其比率，在Au沉积到Pt箔上时，可以监测Au覆盖度与Au到Pt特征的AES峰值比之间的关系。AES测量也被进行，作为沉积时间的函数以及在热退火后，以评估Au/Pt表面的稳定性。
