The AES measurements demonstrate the deposition of Au on the Pt foil at 300 K, with the growth following a layer-by-layer mechanism. The AES scans taken after cooling the surface below 500 K confirm the deposition process. The AES peak-to-peak heights of Au and Pt are monitored, showing a nearly linear correlation with the average thickness of Au deposited. The Au coverage can be determined using a specific equation based on the accelerating voltage. The AES measurements also show the thermal stability of the Au/Pt ratio over a certain temperature range. The DFT calculations predict that the binding energies of adsorbates on Pt decrease with increased Au coverage. The CO desorption temperatures on Au/Pt surfaces are significantly lower than on Pt surfaces, indicating a weaker binding strength of CO. Annealing the Au/Pt surface at various temperatures in different environments reveals its stability. The extent of carbon deposition on the Pt and Au/Pt surfaces is evaluated using AES measurements. The results in Table 1 show that the activity of Pt towards cyclohexene is reduced by the formation of the Au/Pt bimetallic surface, consistent with a weaker binding energy of cyclohexene based on the DFT calculations of H and O binding energies.

在300 K下，AES测量显示Au在Pt箔上的沉积过程，并遵循层状生长机制。冷却表面至低于500 K后进行的AES扫描确认了沉积过程。根据加速电压，可以确定Au覆盖度。通过特定的方程，可以基于加速电压来确定Au覆盖度。AES测量还展示了Au/Pt比例在一定温度范围内的热稳定性。DFT计算预测，随着Au覆盖度的增加，吸附剂在Pt上的结合能降低。Au/Pt表面上的CO脱附温度明显低于Pt表面，表明CO与Au/Pt表面的结合强度较弱。在不同温度和环境条件下对Au/Pt表面进行退火，揭示了其稳定性。通过AES测量评估了Pt和Au/Pt表面的碳沉积程度。表1的结果显示，Pt对环己烯的活性因形成Au/Pt双金属表面而降低，这与基于H和O结合能的DFT计算预测的环己烯结合能较弱一致。
