[1] "Based on the results and discussion presented above, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of Au/Pt alloy formation on the surface reactivities of Pt:"
[2] "(1) DFT calculations predict that the binding energies of atomic H and O on Pt are significantly reduced upon the formation of the Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces."
[3] "(2) TPD results reveal that CO binds more weakly to Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces than to the Pt surface, suggesting that the formation of Au/Pt bimetallic surface can reduce the extent of CO poisoning."
[4] "(3) The formation of Au/Pt bimetallic alloy helps reduce the coking problem by inhibiting the accumulation of atomic carbon from the reaction with cyclohexene."

Based on the research findings, Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces exhibit improved resistance to deactivation compared to pure Pt surfaces. Specifically, the formation of Au/Pt surfaces leads to:

1. Decreased binding energies of adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen, which is predicted by DFT calculations.
2. Weaker binding of carbon monoxide (CO) on Au/Pt surfaces, as confirmed by CO desorption temperatures from TPD experiments.
3. Reduced carbon deposition from cyclohexene decomposition, as evidenced by the absence of carbon peaks in AES measurements.

These results suggest that modifying Pt surfaces with Au could enhance the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts.

根据研究结果，Au/Pt双金属表面在抵抗失活方面比纯Pt表面表现出更好的性能。具体来说，Au/Pt表面的形成导致：

1. 吸附剂如原子氢和氧的结合能显著降低，这由DFT计算预测。
2. CO在Au/Pt表面的结合力较弱，通过CO脱吸温度的TPD实验得到证实。
3. 从环己烯分解过程中减少了碳沉积，这在AES测量中未检测到碳峰。

这些结果表明，用Au对Pt表面进行改性可以增强Pt基催化剂的催化性能和稳定性。
