[1] "The DFT results indicated that the binding energies of adsorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen, were much weaker on Au/Pt surfaces in comparison to Pt."
[2] "The CO desorption TPD revealed that the Au/Pt surface bonded CO more weakly than Pt, indicating that modifying Pt with Au could potentially help reduce CO poisoning."
[3] "In addition, the decomposition and dehydrogenation of cyclohexene were used as probe reactions to compare the extent of carbon deposition on the Pt and AuPt surfaces."
[4] "The presence of Au on Pt promoted the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene."

1. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling showed that the binding energies of adsorbates, including hydrogen and oxygen, were weaker on Au/Pt surfaces compared to pure Pt surfaces.

2. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments demonstrated that the Au/Pt surface bonded carbon monoxide more weakly than a pure Pt surface, suggesting a potential reduction in CO poisoning.

3. Cyclohexene decomposition and dehydrogenation were utilized as indicators to compare the extent of carbon deposition on Pt and Au/Pt surfaces.

4. The presence of Au on the Pt surface facilitated the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene into benzene.

5. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) measurements indicated that the Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces prevented carbon deposition on the surface, implying the Au/Pt alloy might resist coking.

1. 动力学理论（DFT）模型表明，吸附剂如氢原子和氧原子在Au/Pt表面的结合能比纯Pt表面弱得多。

2. 温度程序脱附（TPD）实验显示，Au/Pt表面与碳氧化合物的结合更弱，这可能有助于减少一氧化碳中毒。

3. 通过环己烯分解和脱氢作为指标，比较了Pt和Au/Pt表面的碳沉积程度。

4. Au在Pt表面上促进了环己烯的选择性脱氢生成苯。

5. 原子发射光谱（AES）测量显示，Au/Pt双金属表面阻止了表面的碳沉积，暗示Au/Pt合金可能抵抗结焦。
