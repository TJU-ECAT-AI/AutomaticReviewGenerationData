The AES measurements demonstrate the deposition of Au on the Pt foil at 300 K, with the growth following a layer-by-layer mechanism. The AES scans taken after cooling the surface below 500 K confirm the deposition process. The AES peak-to-peak heights of Au and Pt are monitored, showing a nearly linear correlation with the average thickness of Au deposited. The Au coverage can be determined using a specific equation based on the accelerating voltage. The AES measurements also show the thermal stability of the Au/Pt ratio over a certain temperature range. The DFT calculations predict that the binding energies of adsorbates on Pt decrease with increased Au coverage. The CO desorption temperatures on Au/Pt surfaces are significantly lower than on Pt surfaces, indicating a weaker binding strength of CO. Annealing the Au/Pt surface at various temperatures in different environments reveals its stability. The extent of carbon deposition on the Pt and Au/Pt surfaces is evaluated using AES measurements. The results in Table 1 show that the activity of Pt towards cyclohexene is reduced by the formation of the Au/Pt bimetallic surface, consistent with a weaker binding energy of cyclohexene based on the DFT calculations of H and O binding energies.

在300 K下，AES测量显示Au在Pt箔上的沉积过程，并遵循层状生长机制。冷却表面至低于500 K后进行的AES扫描确认了沉积过程。根据加速电压，可以确定Au覆盖度。通过特定的方程，可以基于加速电压来确定Au覆盖度。AES测量还展示了Au/Pt比例在一定温度范围内的热稳定性。DFT计算预测，随着Au覆盖度的增加，吸附剂在Pt上的结合能降低。Au/Pt表面上的CO脱附温度明显低于Pt表面，表明CO与Au/Pt表面的结合强度较弱。在不同温度和环境条件下对Au/Pt表面进行退火，揭示了其稳定性。通过AES测量评估了Pt和Au/Pt表面的碳沉积程度。表1的结果显示，Pt对环己烯的活性因形成Au/Pt双金属表面而降低，这与基于H和O结合能的DFT计算预测的环己烯结合能较弱一致。

[1] "The DFT results indicated that the binding energies of adsorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen, were much weaker on Au/Pt surfaces in comparison to Pt."
[2] "The CO desorption TPD revealed that the Au/Pt surface bonded CO more weakly than Pt, indicating that modifying Pt with Au could potentially help reduce CO poisoning."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The formation of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces leads to a reduction in the binding energy of adsorbates like hydrogen and oxygen, compared to pure Pt surfaces. This results in weaker bonding of CO to the Au/Pt surface, which could potentially mitigate CO poisoning. The Au/Pt surfaces also promote the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene, leading to benzene formation. Furthermore, the Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces inhibit the deposition of carbon, which reduces the risk of coking during catalytic reactions.

[1] "Based on the results and discussion presented above, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of Au/Pt alloy formation on the surface reactivities of Pt:"
[2] "(1) DFT calculations predict that the binding energies of atomic H and O on Pt are significantly reduced upon the formation of the Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces."
[3] "(2) TPD results reveal that CO binds more weakly to Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces than to the Pt surface, suggesting that the formation of Au/Pt bimetallic surface can reduce the extent of CO poisoning."
[4] "(3) The formation of Au/Pt bimetallic alloy helps reduce the coking problem by inhibiting the accumulation of atomic carbon from the reaction with cyclohexene."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Based on the research findings, Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces exhibit improved resistance to deactivation compared to pure Pt surfaces. Specifically, the formation of Au/Pt surfaces leads to:

1. Decreased binding energies of adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen, which is predicted by DFT calculations.
2. Weaker binding of carbon monoxide (CO) on Au/Pt surfaces, as confirmed by CO desorption temperatures from TPD experiments.
3. Reduced carbon deposition from cyclohexene decomposition, as evidenced by the absence of carbon peaks in AES measurements.

These results suggest that modifying Pt surfaces with Au could enhance the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts.

Experimental techniques like AES are used to monitor and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES peak-to-peak heights of Au and Pt, along with their ratio, are measured during Au deposition on a Pt foil. This helps correlate the Au coverage on the Pt surface with the AES peak ratio of Au to Pt features. AES measurements are also taken as a function of deposition time and after thermal annealing to assess the stability of the Au/Pt surface.
