The formation of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces leads to a reduction in the binding energy of adsorbates like hydrogen and oxygen, compared to pure Pt surfaces. This results in weaker bonding of CO to the Au/Pt surface, which could potentially mitigate CO poisoning. The Au/Pt surfaces also promote the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene, leading to benzene formation. Furthermore, the Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces inhibit the deposition of carbon, which reduces the risk of coking during catalytic reactions.

Au/Pt双金属表面的形成导致吸附剂如氢和氧的结合能显著降低，与纯Pt表面相比。这导致Au/Pt表面的CO结合较弱，可能有助于减轻CO中毒。Au/Pt表面还能促进环己烯的选择性脱氢化，生成苯。此外，Au/Pt双金属表面抑制碳沉积，大大降低了Pt在催化反应中结焦的风险。
