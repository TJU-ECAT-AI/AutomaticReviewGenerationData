Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) have been utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (primarily Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These studies typically involve measuring the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of these atoms in real-time. The results obtained from these experiments are compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions to validate the accuracy of the computational models. The comparison often reveals discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, necessitating further refinement of the DFT calculations.

使用HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子能谱）等实验技术，验证并量化氧诱导表面分层的亚表面3d原子（主要为Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的分布。这些研究通常涉及实时测量这些原子的分层速率和活化势垒。实验结果与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测进行比较，以验证计算模型的准确性。比较通常发现理论预测与实验观察之间存在差异，这需要进一步改进DFT计算。
