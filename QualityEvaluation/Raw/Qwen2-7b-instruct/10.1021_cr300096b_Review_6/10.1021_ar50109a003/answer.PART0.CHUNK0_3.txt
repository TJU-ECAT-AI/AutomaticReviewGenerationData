<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Experimental techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) have been utilized to characterize the state of Pt in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods allow for the quantification of surface enrichment of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, upon oxygen exposure. The measured kinetics and activation barriers of the oxygen-induced surface segregation can be compared with theoretical predictions obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The agreement between experimental data and DFT simulations provides insights into the mechanism of surface enrichment and the stability of the bimetallic catalysts under reactive environments.

利用X射线衍射(XRD)、能谱X射线能量分散分析(EDS)、透射电子显微镜(TEM)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、X射线吸收近边结构(XANES)和高分辨率透射电子显微镜(HRTEM)等技术，研究了Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中Pt的状态。这些方法允许对氧暴露后表面富集的次表层3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）进行量化。通过比较实验数据与基于密度泛函理论(DFT)的模拟计算得到的表面富集动力学和激活能垒，可以验证表面富集机制并评估催化剂在活性环境下的稳定性。实验结果与DFT模拟的一致性提供了关于表面富集机制和催化剂稳定性的深入理解。
