Experimental techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) have been utilized to characterize the state of Pt in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods allow for the quantification of surface enrichment of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, upon oxygen exposure. The measured kinetics and activation barriers of the oxygen-induced surface segregation can be compared with theoretical predictions obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The agreement between experimental data and DFT simulations provides insights into the mechanism of surface enrichment and the stability of the bimetallic catalysts under reactive environments.

Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) have been utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (primarily Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These studies typically involve measuring the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of these atoms in real-time. The results obtained from these experiments are compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions to validate the accuracy of the computational models. The comparison often reveals discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, necessitating further refinement of the DFT calculations.
