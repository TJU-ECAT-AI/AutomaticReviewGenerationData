1. HREELS was used to study the interaction of CO with the PtAu/Pt(111) surface alloy. The activation barrier for the reaction was determined to be 1.2 eV through DFT calculations.
2. AES measurements were conducted to validate the existence of segregated Ni atoms in the Pt-Ni bimetallic system.
3. The kinetic data collected from HREELS experiments aligned closely with the theoretical predictions made using DFT.
