<p>The results from the 0.5 L of D2 and 3 L of C6H10 coadsorption experiments showed significantly more cyclohexane production from the monolayer Ni/Pt surface. By comparing TPD peak areas, it is determined that the desorption of C6H12 increased from 0.009 to 0.026 cyclohexene molecules per Pt atom. Relatively large quantities of deuterated cyclohexane products are also detected. By comparing the TPD areas of deuterated cyclohexane to that of C6H12, the yields of C6H11D1 and C6H10D2 are estimated to be 0.007 and 0.013 cyclohexene molecules per Pt atom, respectively. The total yield of cyclohexane products (C6H12, C6H11D1, and C6H10D2) is 0.046 cyclohexene per Pt atom, which represents a 5-fold increase in the hydrogenation activity.</p>

The unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface leads to enhanced hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene. By exposing the monolayer Ni surface to D2 prior to the adsorption of cyclohexene, the total yield of the normal and deuterated cyclohexanes increases by approximately 5-fold. This increase is attributed to the weaker interaction between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film, which facilitates the hydrogenation reaction.

单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的独特化学性质导致了环己烯氢化活性的增强。通过在吸附环己烯之前向单层Ni表面暴露D2，正常和脱氘环己烷的总产率增加了大约5倍。这一增加归因于吸附剂与单层Ni薄膜之间的较弱相互作用，这促进了氢化反应。
