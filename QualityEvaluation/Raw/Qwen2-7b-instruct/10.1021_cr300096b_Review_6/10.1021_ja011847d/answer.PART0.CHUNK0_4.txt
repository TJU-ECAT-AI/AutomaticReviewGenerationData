<p>The unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface can be explained by the weaker interaction between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film.</p>
<p>Our results clearly showed that the reactivity of the bimetallic Ni/Pt surfaces, at near monolayer Ni coverages, is substantially different from that of either Ni(111) or Pt(111).</p>
<p>The main desorption peak of D2 from the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface was at 220 K, which was about 74 K lower than that on Pt(111) and about 154 K lower than that on the thick Ni(111) film.</p>
<p>Using cyclohexene as a probe molecule, we compared the relative binding energies of atomic deuterium by following its recombinative desorption from Pt(111), thick Ni/Pt(111), and a Ni/Pt(111) surface with a monolayer Ni coverage.</p>
<p>From TPD measurements, we have detected the evolution of cyclohexane on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface.</p>
<p>The amount of hydrogenated products increased with the presence of preadsorbed deuterium.</p>
<p>Using HREELS, we have observed the different surface intermediates on Pt(111), monolayer Ni/Pt(111), and the thick Ni(111) film.</p>
<p>Last, the polarization-dependence NEXAFS measurements allowed us to confirm the presence of different surface intermediates on the three types of surfaces, as well as to estimate the bonding orientation of the adsorbates on these surfaces.</p>
<p>These TPD spectra show that at low Ni coverages, the bimetallic surface behaves like Pt; as the Ni/Pt Auger ratio becomes greater than 2, however, the surface begins to behave more like the thick Ni(111) film.</p>
<p>At 250 K, however, significant spectral changes are observed: (1) The two modes at 649 and 724 cm-1 are replaced by a pair of features at 757 and 825 cm-1, (2) the ν(CC) mode at 1630 cm-1 disappears, and (3) the ν(CH) modes shift to >3000 cm-1.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the spectrum in Figure 6c does not show any spectral features characteristic of cyclohexane even though the TPD results show a relatively intense m/e+ = 84 signal at 245 K for this surface.</p>
<p>On the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface, the coefficient y can also be obtained by comparing the TPD peak areas from the monolayer surface to that from the clean Pt(111) surface.</p>
