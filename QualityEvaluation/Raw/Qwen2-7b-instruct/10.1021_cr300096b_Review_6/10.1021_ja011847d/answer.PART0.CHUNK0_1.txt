[1] "Our results clearly showed that the reactivity of the bimetallic Ni/Pt surfaces, at near monolayer Ni coverages, is substantially different from that of either Ni(111) or Pt(111)."
[2] "Using cyclohexene as a probe molecule would also allow us to determine whether the interaction between weakly bonded hydrogen and cyclohexene would lead to a new reaction pathway, the hydrogenation reaction to produce cyclohexane."
[3] "The spectrum in Figure 6c does not show any spectral features characteristic of cyclohexane even though the TPD results show a relatively intense m/e+ = 84 signal at 245 K for this surface."
[4] "The unique chemistry is also reflected by the desorption of benzene and hydrogen, as well as by the detection of a new gas-phase cyclohexane product, at temperatures between approximately 245261 K."
[5] "Overall, our results suggest that the unique chemistry is related to the weaker bonding between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni surface."

1. The reactivity of the bimetallic Ni/Pt surfaces, particularly at near monolayer Ni coverages, exhibits significant differences compared to Ni(111) or Pt(111) surfaces.
2. The interaction between weakly bonded hydrogen and cyclohexene could result in a novel reaction pathway, specifically hydrogenation to form cyclohexane.
3. Despite the presence of a relatively intense m/e+ = 84 signal at 245 K in the TPD results for the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface, the spectrum in Figure 6c does not display any characteristics of cyclohexane.
4. The unique chemical behavior is manifested through the desorption of benzene, hydrogen, and the emergence of a new gas-phase cyclohexane product at temperatures ranging from 245 to 261 K.
5. The findings imply that the distinctive chemistry is attributable to the weaker interactions between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni surface.

1. 在接近单层Ni覆盖的情况下，Ni/Pt双金属表面的反应性与Ni(111)或Pt(111)表面存在显著差异。
2. 弱氢键与环己烯之间的相互作用可能导致新的反应路径，即氢化生成环己烷。
3. 尽管在单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的TPD结果中存在相对强烈的m/e+ = 84信号（在245 K），但图6c的光谱中未显示出任何环己烷特征。
4. 这种独特的化学性质体现在苯、氢以及在大约245至261 K温度范围内检测到的新气相环己烷产物上。
5. 结果表明，这种特殊化学性质归因于吸附剂与单层Ni表面之间较弱的相互作用。
