<p>The unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface can be explained by the weaker interaction between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film.</p>
<p>Our results clearly showed that the reactivity of the bimetallic Ni/Pt surfaces, at near monolayer Ni coverages, is substantially different from that of either Ni(111) or Pt(111).</p>
<p>The main desorption peak of D2 from the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface was at 220 K, which was about 74 K lower than that on Pt(111) and about 154 K lower than that on the thick Ni(111) film.</p>
<p>The reaction pathways of cyclohexene were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption, high-resolution electron energy loss (HREELS), and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy.</p>
<p>HREELS and NEXAFS studies show that cyclohexene is weakly π-bonded on monolayer Ni/Pt(111) but di-σ-bonded to Pt(111) and Ni(111).</p>
<p>A new hydrogenation pathway is detected on the monolayer Ni surface at temperatures as low as 245 K.</p>
<p>By exposing the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface to D2 prior to the adsorption of cyclohexene, the total yield of the normal and deuterated cyclohexanes increases by approximately 5-fold.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reaction pathway for the complete decomposition of cyclohexene to atomic carbon and hydrogen, which has a selectivity of 69% on the thick Ni(111) film, is nearly negligible (<2%) on the monolayer Ni surface.</p>

The unique chemical properties of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface are characterized by weaker interactions between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film. This is evidenced by differences in the reactivity, adsorption configurations, and reaction pathways of cyclohexene on this surface compared to Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) films. The weaker bonding leads to unique outcomes such as the detection of a new hydrogenation pathway at lower temperatures, increased cyclohexane yield upon pre-exposure to deuterium, and a reduced selectivity for complete decomposition of cyclohexene to atomic carbon and hydrogen. These findings highlight the importance of overlayer thickness in influencing metal surface chemistry.

一单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的独特化学性质由吸附剂与单层Ni薄膜之间的较弱相互作用所定义。这体现在环己烯在该表面的反应性、吸附配置和反应途径与Pt(111)和厚Ni(111)薄膜的不同之处。较弱的结合导致了新的氢化途径在较低温度下被检测到，预暴露于重氢后环己烷的产率增加，并且完全分解环己烯至原子碳和氢的选取性从厚Ni(111)薄膜的69％降低到单层Ni表面的不到2％。这些发现强调了覆盖层厚度在影响金属表面化学性质方面的重要性。
