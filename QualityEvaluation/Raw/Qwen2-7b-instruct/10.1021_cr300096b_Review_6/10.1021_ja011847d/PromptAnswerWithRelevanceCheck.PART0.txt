<p>The results from the 0.5 L of D2 and 3 L of C6H10 coadsorption experiments showed significantly more cyclohexane production from the monolayer Ni/Pt surface. By comparing TPD peak areas, it is determined that the desorption of C6H12 increased from 0.009 to 0.026 cyclohexene molecules per Pt atom. Relatively large quantities of deuterated cyclohexane products are also detected. By comparing the TPD areas of deuterated cyclohexane to that of C6H12, the yields of C6H11D1 and C6H10D2 are estimated to be 0.007 and 0.013 cyclohexene molecules per Pt atom, respectively. The total yield of cyclohexane products (C6H12, C6H11D1, and C6H10D2) is 0.046 cyclohexene per Pt atom, which represents a 5-fold increase in the hydrogenation activity.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface leads to enhanced hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene. By exposing the monolayer Ni surface to D2 prior to the adsorption of cyclohexene, the total yield of the normal and deuterated cyclohexanes increases by approximately 5-fold. This increase is attributed to the weaker interaction between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film, which facilitates the hydrogenation reaction.

单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的独特化学性质导致了环己烯氢化活性的增强。通过在吸附环己烯之前向单层Ni表面暴露D2，正常和脱氘环己烷的总产率增加了大约5倍。这一增加归因于吸附剂与单层Ni薄膜之间的较弱相互作用，这促进了氢化反应。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The unique chemical properties of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface are characterized by weaker interactions between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film. This is evidenced by differences in the reactivity, adsorption configurations, and reaction pathways of cyclohexene on this surface compared to Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) films. The weaker bonding leads to unique outcomes such as the detection of a new hydrogenation pathway at lower temperatures, increased cyclohexane yield upon pre-exposure to deuterium, and a reduced selectivity for complete decomposition of cyclohexene to atomic carbon and hydrogen. These findings highlight the importance of overlayer thickness in influencing metal surface chemistry.

一单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的独特化学性质由吸附剂与单层Ni薄膜之间的较弱相互作用所定义。这体现在环己烯在该表面的反应性、吸附配置和反应途径与Pt(111)和厚Ni(111)薄膜的不同之处。较弱的结合导致了新的氢化途径在较低温度下被检测到，预暴露于重氢后环己烷的产率增加，并且完全分解环己烯至原子碳和氢的选取性从厚Ni(111)薄膜的69％降低到单层Ni表面的不到2％。这些发现强调了覆盖层厚度在影响金属表面化学性质方面的重要性。
