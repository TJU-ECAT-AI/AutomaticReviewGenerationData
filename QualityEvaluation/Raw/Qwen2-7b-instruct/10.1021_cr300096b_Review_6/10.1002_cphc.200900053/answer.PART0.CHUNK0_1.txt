[1] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
[2] "For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[3] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[4] "Using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."
[5] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those composed of a 3d transition metal overlaying a Pt surface, exhibit superior catalytic performance due to their complex surface structures. These structures can be dynamically altered through oxidation and reduction treatments, allowing for control over the surface adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability of the catalysts.

双金属催化剂，特别是那些在铂表面覆盖着3d过渡金属的催化剂，由于其复杂的表面结构而表现出优越的催化性能。这些结构可以通过氧化和还原处理动态改变，从而控制催化剂的表面吸附强度和CO氧化能力。
