[1] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[2] "For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reducing and oxidative conditions."
[3] "The bimetallic catalysts may show similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, which offers eventually the opportunity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity."
[4] "Using well-defined FePt(111) systems, we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."
[5] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

The document demonstrates that the structure of bimetallic catalysts, specifically FePt systems, can be reversibly modulated through cycling oxidation and reduction treatments. This results in switching between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface, offering tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability.

文档显示，通过循环氧化和还原处理，二金属催化剂，特别是FePt系统，可以实现结构的可逆调节。这导致在Pt表皮下有Fe以及富含铁氧化物的Pt表面之间的切换，提供调整表面CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力的可能性。
