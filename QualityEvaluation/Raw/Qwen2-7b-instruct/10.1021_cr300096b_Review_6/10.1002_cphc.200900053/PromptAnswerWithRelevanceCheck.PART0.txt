How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."

[3] "Here, using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."

1. The structure of a catalyst surface can change dynamically during reactions, exhibiting reversible surface processes like wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion in monometallic catalyst systems when the gas environment shifts between reducing and oxidizing conditions.
2. By employing cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, the surface structure of bimetallic FePt catalysts can be reversibly switched between a Pt-skin surface with iron underneath and a surface rich in iron oxide.
3. This reversible structural modulation enables tuning of the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation capability on the bimetallic catalysts.

[1] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
[2] "For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[3] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[4] "Using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those composed of a 3d transition metal overlaying a Pt surface, exhibit superior catalytic performance due to their complex surface structures. These structures can be dynamically altered through oxidation and reduction treatments, allowing for control over the surface adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability of the catalysts.

The reversible structural modulation of FePt bimetallic surfaces allows for the switching between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide rich Pt surface. This change is regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, offering tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts.

[5] "Considering that the attenuation of Fe 2p3/2 photoelectrons through one layer Pt(111) is around 30%, Fe should diffuse into the near surface regions (mainly in first subsurface layer, around 0.5 ML) rather than the deep bulk."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Using molecular beam epitaxy, a clean Pt(111) surface was covered with 1.0 monolayer (ML) of Fe. Upon annealing this surface in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at 850 K for 6 minutes, the surface Fe overlayers disappeared, indicating diffusion of Fe into the near surface regions, primarily the first subsurface layer around 0.5 ML, rather than deep into the bulk. The binding energy of Fe 2p3/2 shifted from 707.2 eV to 707.8 eV, and there was a 61% decrease in the Fe 2p3/2 peak intensity post-annealing.
