[1] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[2] "For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reduc-tive and oxidative conditions."
[3] "Here, using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."
[4] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunabiity in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reversible structural modulation of FePt bimetallic surfaces allows for the switching between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide rich Pt surface. This change is regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, offering tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts.

FePt双金属表面的可逆结构调制允许在Pt表皮表面与底层Fe之间以及富含铁氧化物的Pt表面之间的切换。这种变化由循环氧化和还原处理调节，提供了调整表面CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力的可能性。
