[1] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[2] "For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reduc-tive and oxidative conditions."
[3] "Here, using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."
[4] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunabiity in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

1. The structure of a catalyst surface can change dynamically during reactions, exhibiting reversible surface processes like wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion in monometallic catalyst systems when the gas environment shifts between reducing and oxidizing conditions.
2. By employing cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, the surface structure of bimetallic FePt catalysts can be reversibly switched between a Pt-skin surface with iron underneath and a surface rich in iron oxide.
3. This reversible structural modulation enables tuning of the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation capability on the bimetallic catalysts.

1. 催化剂表面的结构在反应过程中可以动态变化，表现出可逆的表面过程，如湿沉积和干燥分散，在单金属催化剂体系中，当气体环境在还原性和氧化性条件之间变化时观察到这些现象。
2. 通过循环氧化和还原处理，可以实现FePt双金属催化剂表面结构的可逆切换，从具有铁底层的Pt皮肤表面到富含铁氧化物的Pt表面。
3. 这种可逆结构调制能够调节表面CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力，从而优化双金属催化剂的性能。
