[1] "For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reduc-tive and oxidative conditions."
[2] "The bimetallic catalysts may show similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, which offers eventually the opportunity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity."
[3] "Fe overlayers with coverage of about 1.0 monolayer (ML) were grown on a clean Pt(111) by molecular beam epitaxy with the substrate temperature at 487 K, producing a Fe/Pt(111) surface."
[4] "Upon annealing a 1.0 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at 850 K for 6 min, the surface Fe overlayers disappear completely."
[5] "Considering that the attenuation of Fe 2p3/2 photoelectrons through one layer Pt(111) is around 30%, Fe should diffuse into the near surface regions (mainly in first subsurface layer, around 0.5 ML) rather than the deep bulk."
[6] "The binding energy (BE) of Fe 2p3/2 shifts from 707.2 eV for the surface Fe overlayers to 707.8 eV."
[7] "A decrease of 61% in the Fe 2p3/2 peak intensity occurs upon the UHV annealing."

Using molecular beam epitaxy, a clean Pt(111) surface was covered with 1.0 monolayer (ML) of Fe. Upon annealing this surface in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at 850 K for 6 minutes, the surface Fe overlayers disappeared, indicating diffusion of Fe into the near surface regions, primarily the first subsurface layer around 0.5 ML, rather than deep into the bulk. The binding energy of Fe 2p3/2 shifted from 707.2 eV to 707.8 eV, and there was a 61% decrease in the Fe 2p3/2 peak intensity post-annealing.

使用分子束外延，一层1.0个单层（ML）的Fe覆盖在清洁的Pt(111)表面上。在超高真空（UHV）环境下对这个表面进行850 K温度下的6分钟热处理后，表面的Fe覆盖层完全消失，这表明Fe扩散到了近表面区域，主要是在第一亚表面层大约0.5 ML处，而不是深入到内部。Fe 2p3/2的结合能从707.2 eV变化为707.8 eV，并且Fe 2p3/2峰强度下降了61%。
