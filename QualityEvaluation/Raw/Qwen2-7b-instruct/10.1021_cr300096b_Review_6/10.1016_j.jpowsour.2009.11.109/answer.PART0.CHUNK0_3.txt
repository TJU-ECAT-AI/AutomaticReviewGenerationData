[1] "In order to correlate the rate of Ni segregation to a typical PEMFC operating temperature of 353 K, Table 1 summarizes the time it would take for the Ni K white line intensity to reach a value of = 0.112, which corresponds to the segregation of approximately half of the subsurface Ni layer to the surface."
[2] "Using an Arrhenius equation, an apparent activation barrier of 32 kcal/mol is found."
[3] "The white line peak absorbance intensity is shown to decrease with increasing exposure to hydrogen. In addition, the reappearance of the peak at 8374 eV indicates that surface Ni atoms are diffusing into the subsurface."
[4] "Using the same analysis procedure, an apparent activation barrier of 13 kcal/mol is determined."

1. Table 1 in the document provides the estimated time required for approximately half of the subsurface Ni layer to segregate to the surface at various temperatures, including 353 K, which is relevant to PEMFC operation conditions. 
2. An activation barrier of 32 kcal/mol was found for Ni segregation under oxygen exposure at atmospheric pressure.
3. The intensity of the Ni K white line absorbance decreases with increased exposure to hydrogen, indicating the diffusion of surface Ni atoms into the subsurface.
4. An activation barrier of approximately 13 kcal/mol was determined for hydrogen-induced diffusion of surface Ni atoms.

1. 表1提供了在不同温度下（包括353K）约半数子表面Ni层分离到表面所需的时间估计，这与PEMFC的操作条件相关。
2. 在大气压力下的氧气暴露下，Ni分离的活化壁垒被发现为32 kcal/mol。
3. 随着氢暴露量的增加，Ni K白线吸收强度降低，表明表面Ni原子向子表面扩散。
4. 对于表面Ni原子的氢诱导扩散，确定了大约13 kcal/mol的活化壁垒。
