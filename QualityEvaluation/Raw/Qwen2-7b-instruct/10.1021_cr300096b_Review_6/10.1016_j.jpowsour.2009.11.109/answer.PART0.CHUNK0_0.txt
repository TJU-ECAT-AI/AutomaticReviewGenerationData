1. The subsurface Pt3dPt structure was found to be thermodynamically favored in vacuum conditions and drew subsurface 3d metals to the surface when oxygen was used, forming a surface 3dPtPt configuration. This understanding was leveraged to bridge the pressure gap and demonstrate similar segregation kinetics at more practical atmospheric pressures.
2. Spectroscopic changes were observed between the as-prepared PtNiPt and NiPtPt samples, confirming that the transition between surface and subsurface structures could occur through oxidation and reduction cycles.
3. By monitoring the intensity of the white line peak at 8351 eV as a function of oxygen exposure time and temperature, the activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation of Ni was quantified to be 32 kcal/mol.
4. Similar to Ni, the spectroscopic changes in Figure 5 indicated the diffusion and segregation of Ni into the subsurface upon hydrogen exposure, with an activation barrier for hydrogen-induced diffusion of approximately 13 kcal/mol.
5. The activation barrier for the hydrogen-induced diffusion of Ni was determined to be roughly 13 kcal/mol.

1. 研究发现，在真空条件下，表面Pt3dPt结构更稳定，并且在氧气的作用下，表面层会吸引3d金属原子形成表面3dPtPt结构。通过这些基本理解，研究聚焦于缩小压力差距，证明在更适用的大气压条件下，具有相似的分离动力学。
2. 通过对原始PtNiPt和NiPtPt样品的光谱变化进行观察，确认了氧化还原循环可以导致表面和亚表面结构之间的转换。
3. 通过监测在不同氧暴露时间和温度下位于8351 eV处的白线峰强度，研究量化了氧诱导Ni原子向表面迁移的活化能壁垒为32 kcal/mol。
4. 类似地，通过氢暴露，观察到图5中的光谱变化显示了Ni原子向亚表面的扩散和分离，氢诱导的Ni原子向表面扩散的活化能壁垒约为13 kcal/mol。
5. 氢诱导的Ni原子向表面的扩散活化能壁垒被确定为大约13 kcal/mol。
