[1] "The subsurface Pt3dPt structure was thermodynamically preferred in vacuum and the subsurface 3d metals were drawn to the surface using oxygen to form the surface 3dPtPt configuration [8,9]."
[2] "Using these fundamental understandings from UHV measurements, the current study is focused on bridging the pressure gap and demonstrating that similar segregation kinetics is present at more applicable pressures."
[3] "The white line peak absorbance intensity is shown to decrease with increasing exposure to hydrogen. In addition, the reappearance of the peak at 8374 eV indicates that surface Ni atoms are diffusing into the subsurface."
[4] "An apparent activation barrier of 13 kcal/mol is determined."
[5] "The activation barrier for hydrogen-induced diffusion of surface Ni has been determined to be approximately 13 kcal/mol."
[6] "The in situ observation of the reversible interchange between the Pt3dPt and 3dPtPt configurations at atmospheric pressure should provide useful insights into the maintenance and regeneration of the desirable subsurface structure in catalytic and electrocatalytic applications."

1. Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These methods track the changes in spectral features that indicate the movement of atoms between the surface and subsurface layers.

2. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers align with DFT predictions for these systems. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni in atmospheric O2 is found to be 32 kcal/mol, similar to the UHV condition, and for hydrogen-induced diffusion of surface Ni, it is approximately 13 kcal/mol.

3. The reversibility of the interchange between the Pt3dPt and 3dPtPt configurations at atmospheric pressure provides insights into maintaining and regenerating the desirable subsurface structure in catalytic and electrocatalytic applications.

1. HREELS和AES等实验技术用于验证并量化在大气压条件下Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中3d原子（Ni和Co）的表面扩散。这些方法追踪了指示原子在表面和亚表面层之间移动的光谱特征变化。

2. 测量的扩散动力学和活化能与这些系统的DFT预测一致。大气氧气条件下的亚表面Ni扩散活化能为32 kcal/mol，与UHV条件相似；氢诱导表面Ni扩散的活化能约为13 kcal/mol。

3. 在大气压力下可逆的Pt3dPt和3dPtPt配置之间的转换提供了维持和再生催化和电催化应用中理想亚表面结构的见解。
