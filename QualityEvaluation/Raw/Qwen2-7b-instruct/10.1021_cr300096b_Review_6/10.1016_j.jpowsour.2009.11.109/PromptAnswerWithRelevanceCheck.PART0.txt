1. The subsurface Pt3dPt structure was found to be thermodynamically favored in vacuum conditions and drew subsurface 3d metals to the surface when oxygen was used, forming a surface 3dPtPt configuration. This understanding was leveraged to bridge the pressure gap and demonstrate similar segregation kinetics at more practical atmospheric pressures.
2. Spectroscopic changes were observed between the as-prepared PtNiPt and NiPtPt samples, confirming that the transition between surface and subsurface structures could occur through oxidation and reduction cycles.
3. By monitoring the intensity of the white line peak at 8351 eV as a function of oxygen exposure time and temperature, the activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation of Ni was quantified to be 32 kcal/mol.
4. Similar to Ni, the spectroscopic changes in Figure 5 indicated the diffusion and segregation of Ni into the subsurface upon hydrogen exposure, with an activation barrier for hydrogen-induced diffusion of approximately 13 kcal/mol.
5. The activation barrier for the hydrogen-induced diffusion of Ni was determined to be roughly 13 kcal/mol.

The experimental techniques, including in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and monitoring changes in white line peaks, were employed to confirm the thermodynamically preferred configurations of Pt3dPt and NiPtPt structures in O2 and H2 atmospheres. The DFT calculations predicted the preference for the subsurface Pt3dPt structure in a reducing environment of H2 and the surface 3dPtPt structure in O2. The reversibility of this process was observed, and the activation barriers for Ni segregation in O2 and hydrogen-induced diffusion of Ni were determined to be 32 kcal/mol and approximately 13 kcal/mol, respectively.

[1] "The subsurface Pt3dPt structure, where 3d represents Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V, and Ti, has been identified as promising catalysts for a wide range of applications, from the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode of PEM fuel cells [1] to hydrogenation reactions in heterogeneous catalysis [2,3]."
[2] "These bimetallic surfaces have been shown to span a wide range of chemical and physical properties beyond a simple combination of the parent metal properties [4,5]."
[3] "The unique properties of the subsurface Pt3dPt bimetallic structures are due to the strain effect from lattice mismatch between alloy metals and the electronic effect related to the difference in electronic configuration [6]."
[4] "However, one of the challenges in the application of these bimetallic structures is the tendency of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate on top of the surface Pt layer, therefore losing the desirable electrocatalytic and catalytic properties."
[5] "This process has been found to be reversible, providing useful insights into the maintenance and regeneration of the desirable subsurface structure."
[6] "The subsurface Pt3dPt structure was thermodynamically preferred in vacuum and the subsurface 3d metals were drawn to the surface using oxygen to form the surface 3dPtPt configuration [8,9]."

The experimental techniques that verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems involve in situ monitoring of changes in the surface composition, particularly focusing on the Pt3dPt structure, using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The technique allows for the quantification of the activation barriers for the diffusion and segregation processes by tracking the changes in the white line peak absorbance intensity as a function of exposure time and temperature to either hydrogen or oxygen. The measured kinetics and activation barriers compare favorably with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, providing valuable insights into the maintenance and regeneration of the desirable subsurface structure.

The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni atoms in atmospheric oxygen is found to be 32 kcal/mol, similar to that determined under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. The activation barrier for hydrogen-induced diffusion of surface Ni atoms is approximately 13 kcal/mol. These findings suggest that the in situ observation of the reversible interchange between the Pt3dPt and 3dPtPt configurations at atmospheric pressure can offer useful insights into the maintenance and regeneration of the desirable subsurface structure in catalytic and electrocatalytic applications.

验证并量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的氧诱导表面分离的实验技术主要采用原位监测表面组成的变化，尤其是通过X射线吸收光谱法（XAS）来追踪Pt3dPt结构的变化。该方法通过跟踪暴露于氢或氧气时白线峰吸收强度随时间变化的函数来量化扩散和分离过程的激活壁垒。测量到的反应动力学和激活壁垒与密度泛函理论（DFT）计算相匹配，为催化和电催化应用中保持和再生理想亚表面结构提供了有价值的信息。

在大气氧环境中，亚表面Ni原子的分离激活壁垒被发现为32 kcal/mol，与在超高真空（UHV）条件下确定的值相似。氢诱导表面Ni原子扩散的激活壁垒约为13 kcal/mol。这些发现表明，在大气压力下观察Pt3dPt和3dPtPt配置之间的可逆互换可以为保持和再生理想亚表面结构提供有用的信息。
