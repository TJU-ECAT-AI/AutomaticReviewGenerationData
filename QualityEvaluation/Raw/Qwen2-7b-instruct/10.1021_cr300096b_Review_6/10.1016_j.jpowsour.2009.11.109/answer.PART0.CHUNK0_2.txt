<p>The thermodynamically preferred configurations in O2 and H2 are predicted from DFT calculations and confirmed experimentally at atmospheric pressures.

The experimental techniques, including in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and monitoring changes in white line peaks, were employed to confirm the thermodynamically preferred configurations of Pt3dPt and NiPtPt structures in O2 and H2 atmospheres. The DFT calculations predicted the preference for the subsurface Pt3dPt structure in a reducing environment of H2 and the surface 3dPtPt structure in O2. The reversibility of this process was observed, and the activation barriers for Ni segregation in O2 and hydrogen-induced diffusion of Ni were determined to be 32 kcal/mol and approximately 13 kcal/mol, respectively.

实验技术，包括原位X射线吸收光谱(XAS)和监测白线峰的变化，被用来确认在O2和H2大气压下的Pt3dPt和NiPtPt结构的热力学最优配置。第一性原理计算预测了在还原环境中的H2中，子表面Pt3dPt结构的偏好以及在O2中的表面3dPtPt结构的偏好。这一过程的可逆性被观察到，并确定了Ni在O2中的分离活化能为32 kcal/mol，以及氢诱导表面Ni扩散的活化能约为13 kcal/mol。
