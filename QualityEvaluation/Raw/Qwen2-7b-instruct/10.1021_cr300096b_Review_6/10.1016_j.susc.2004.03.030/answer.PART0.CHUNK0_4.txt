3.1. TPD
Fig. 1 shows NO2 desorption traces obtained by monitoring the 46-amu signal. A single desorption peak appears below 150 K which increased in temperature with increasing coverage. This peak corresponds to desorption of NO2 from multilayer, physisorbed species and occurs at the same temperature as that for Pt(1 1 1) [5] . However, unlike the case on Pt(1 1 1), no NO2 desorbs from the chemisorbed monolayer. The NO2 monolayer reacts completely and irreversibly on a 3 alloy surface.

Fig. 2 traces the evolution of one of the reaction products, NO, after increasing NO2 exposures. The lowest exposure investigated yields three desorption peaks at 240, 280, and 360 K. After increasing NO2 exposures, these NO desorption peaks saturate in size and shift to higher temperature. Desorption of NO under most of these conditions is reaction rate-limited, because NO desorption following NO adsorption on a 3 alloy occurs in a single peak which shifts with coverage from 240 to 190 K [36] .

Fig. 3 shows corresponding O2 TPD spectra obtained during the same experiments. After a small initial NO2 dose, O2 desorption occurred at 1070 K in a peak that shifts to 1077 K at saturation. Following saturation of the high temperature peak, a second feature appeared at lower temperature with a broad peak at 910 K after large exposures. Based on previous studies of O2 desorption following O3 decomposition on PtSn alloys [37] , we can assign these two peaks to decomposition of Sn-oxide species. Our explanation of these two peaks is that the 1077-K peak is due to O2 desorption from reduction of SnOSn species and the peak at 910 K is due to O2 desorption from reduction of SnOPt species.

Fig. 4 utilizes the TPD areas from Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 to construct an uptake plot characterizing the adsorption kinetics and decomposition reactions during TPD. The NO2 coverage scale was determined by calibration using the chemisorbed NO2, NO, and O2 TPD peak areas after NO2 adsorption on clean Pt(1 1 1), assuming that 20% of the 0.5-ML NO2 coverage desorbs as NO2 and the rest decomposes cleanly to NO and O2 during TPD as reported by Bartram et al. [5] . The NO and O2 TPD areas in our experiments can be placed on this NO2 coverage scale by assuming the sticking coefficient is constant, independent of coverage on the 3 alloy at 120 K, and noting that no other gas phase products were detected.

Fig. 4 shows that the chemisorbed monolayer coverage is equivalent to 0.4-ML NO2 and O2 desorption at 1100 K represents an atomic oxygen coverage, θO, of 0.2 ML. Thus, oxygen associated with Sn sites on this surface, with ΘSn=0.33 ML, gives an O:Sn ratio of 2:3 corresponding to Sn1.5O species.

Fig. 5 demonstrates that the oxygen coverage can be increased by NO2 exposures on the alloy at higher temperatures. The surface oxygen coverage obtained following exposures at 120 K is limited by coadsorbed NO. The bottom curve in Fig. 5 reproduces the top curve from Fig. 3 . The top curve in Fig. 5 is after a higher NO2 exposure on the alloy at 600 K, which is above the desorption temperature of NO but below that required for O2 desorption. This curve corresponds to θO=1.1 ML. This is a higher coverage than θO=0.25 ML obtained by O2 exposure on Pt(1 1 1) at 150300 K [38] and θO=0.75 ML obtained by NO2 exposure on Pt(1 1 1) at 400 K [39] . This is also a higher coverage than reported by Saliba et al. [37] of θO=0.87 ML after O3 exposures on the 3 alloy at 300 K. In that work, oxygen desorption below 850 K was associated with reduction of oxidic Pt species rather than SnOx species. According to our results from Fig. 5 , oxygen associated with Sn sites gives an O:Sn ratio of 0.5:0.33. This situation probably corresponds to forming SnO1.5 species.

3.2. AES
The origin of the two O2 desorption states seen in the TPD curves shown in Fig. 3 can be probed by chemical shifts in AES that are induced by reaction with adsorbates and indicate the oxidation state of the substrate components. The kinetic energies (KE) of emitted Auger electrons are affected by core level binding energy shifts and so they are useful for qualitatively assessing whether or not oxidation has occurred. Experiments utilizing this approach have been reviewed by Baker and Brundle [40] .

3.3. LEED
The 3 alloy was probed by LEED following a 0.1 L (2 ML) dose of NO2 on the sample at 120 K. This caused no change in the alloy LEED pattern other than to decrease the spot intensity, and no significant changes were observed after annealing to 200 K which desorbs some NO2. After annealing to 280 K, which desorbs some NO, the spots from the (3×3)R30 pattern disappeared and only the (1 × 1) spots of Pt(1 1 1) remained with a diffuse background. On some areas of the crystal, a faint (2 × 2) structure was observed, similar to that seen by Parker et al. [39] for θO=0.25 ML generated after NO2 exposures on Pt(1 1 1). After a subsequent anneal to 700 K, (2 × 2) spots could no longer be seen and only a blurry (1 × 1) pattern remained. Annealing to 900 K desorbed all oxygen except that in the highest temperature O2 TPD peak at 1020 K. This resulted in the appearance of a (4 × 4) LEED pattern, which is consistent with the observations of Batzill et al. [43] . In this condition, only oxygen remains at the surface and Sn is oxidized as shown in Fig. 6 .

This document describes the investigation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) adsorption and reaction on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy using various techniques such as temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). The results show that at 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed as an N,N-bonded dimer (N2O4) on the surface. However, no NO2 or N2O4 desorbs from the monolayer state. The dimer completely dissociates between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300-400 K. The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was about θO=0.4 ML, which can be increased to θO=1.1 ML by NO2 dosing on the alloy surface at 600 K to remove inhibition by coadsorbed NO. Under these conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx. Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation.

本文描述了对（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上氮氧化物（NO2）吸附和反应的研究，使用了包括温度程序脱附（TPD）、Auger电子能谱（AES）、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和低能电子衍射（LEED）在内的多种技术。结果显示，在120 K时，NO2在表面上以N,N共价键结合的二聚体（N2O4）形式吸附。然而，没有观察到NO2或N2O4从单层状态的分子性脱附。该二聚体在220至300 K之间完全分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。吸附的NO2进一步在300-400 K之间分解为共吸附的NO和O。加热N2O4单层获得的最大氧覆盖率为θO=0.4 ML，通过在600 K时向合金表面施加NO2剂量来去除抑制作用由共吸附的NO。在这种情况下，吸附的氧以三种清晰的脱附状态释放为O2，最低的是从Pt位点脱附，其他两个是分解还原锡氧化物相（SnOx）。通过分析Sn AES峰的变化，可以跟踪Sn的氧化过程。
