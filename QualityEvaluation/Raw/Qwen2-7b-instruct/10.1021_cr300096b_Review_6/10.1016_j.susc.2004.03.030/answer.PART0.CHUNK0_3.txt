1. The NO2 desorption traces were obtained by monitoring the 46-amu signal after exposing NO2 on the 3 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K.
2. The evolution of NO as a reaction product was traced in Fig. 2 after increasing NO2 exposures.
3. O2 TPD spectra were obtained during the same experiments as those for NO2.
4. The chemisorbed monolayer coverage was equivalent to 0.4-ML NO2, and O2 desorption at 1100 K represented an atomic oxygen coverage of 0.2 ML.
5. The oxygen coverage was increased by NO2 exposures on the alloy at higher temperatures.
6. The shift in the Sn(MNN) AES peaks after NO2 exposure at 120 K and subsequent heating to desorb O2 was shown in Fig. 6.
7. HREELS spectra were obtained after depositing a NO2 multilayer film on the 3 alloy at 120 K and heating the sample to increasing temperatures.

1. 在120 K时，通过监测46amu信号获得了NO2脱附轨迹。
2. NO在增加NO2暴露后作为反应产物的演化在图2中被追踪。
3. O2 TPD谱是在与NO2相同实验条件下获得的。
4. 化学吸附单层覆盖相当于0.4-ML NO2，1100 K下的O2脱附代表了0.2 ML的原子氧覆盖。
5. 氧覆盖通过在较高温度下对合金进行NO2暴露而增加。
6. 在120 K时NO2暴露和随后加热以脱除O2后，图6显示了Sn(MNN) AES峰的偏移。
7. 在120 K时将NO2多层薄膜沉积到3合金上并加热样品至升高温度后，获得了HREELS谱。
