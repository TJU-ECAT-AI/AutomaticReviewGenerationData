There are no experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES mentioned in the literature that verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document focuses on the adsorption and reaction of NO2 on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, not on the segregation of 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

3.1. TPD
TPD spectra were obtained after exposures of NO2 on the 3 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K.
Fig. 1 shows NO2 desorption traces obtained by monitoring the 46-amu signal. A single desorption peak appears below 150 K which increased in temperature with increasing coverage. This peak corresponds to desorption of NO2 from multilayer, physisorbed species and occurs at the same temperature as that for Pt(1 1 1) [5] . However, unlike the case on Pt(1 1 1), no NO2 desorbs from the chemisorbed monolayer. The NO2 monolayer reacts completely and irreversibly on a 3 alloy surface. This can be compared to the decomposition of about 80% of the monolayer on Pt(1 1 1) [5] .

Fig. 2 traces the evolution of one of the reaction products, NO, after increasing NO2 exposures. The lowest exposure investigated yields three desorption peaks at 240, 280, and 360 K. After increasing NO2 exposures, these NO desorption peaks saturate in size and shift to higher temperature. Desorption of NO under most of these conditions is reaction rate-limited, because NO desorption following NO adsorption on a 3 alloy occurs in a single peak which shifts with coverage from 240 to 190 K [36] .

Fig. 3 shows corresponding O2 TPD spectra obtained during the same experiments. After a small initial NO2 dose, O2 desorption occurred at 1070 K in a peak that shifts to 1077 K at saturation. Following saturation of the high temperature peak, a second feature appeared at lower temperature with a broad peak at 910 K after large exposures. Based on previous studies of O2 desorption following O3 decomposition on PtSn alloys [37] , we can assign these two peaks to decomposition of Sn-oxide species. Our explanation of these two peaks is that the 1077-K peak is due to O2 desorption from reduction of SnOSn species and the peak at 910 K is due to O2 desorption from reduction of SnOPt species.

Fig. 4 utilizes the TPD areas from Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 to construct an uptake plot characterizing the adsorption kinetics and decomposition reactions during TPD. The NO2 coverage scale was determined by calibration using the chemisorbed NO2, NO, and O2 TPD peak areas after NO2 adsorption on clean Pt(1 1 1), assuming that 20% of the 0.5-ML NO2 coverage desorbs as NO2 and the rest decomposes cleanly to NO and O2 during TPD as reported by Bartram et al.

Fig. 5 demonstrates that the oxygen coverage can be increased by NO2 exposures on the alloy at higher temperatures. The surface oxygen coverage obtained following exposures at 120 K is limited by coadsorbed NO. The bottom curve in Fig. 5 reproduces the top curve from Fig. 3 . The top curve in Fig. 5 is after a higher NO2 exposure on the alloy at 600 K, which is above the desorption temperature of NO but below that required for O2 desorption. This curve corresponds to θO=1.1 ML. This is a higher coverage than θO=0.25 ML obtained by O2 exposure on Pt(1 1 1) at 150300 K [38] and θO=0.75 ML obtained by NO2 exposure on Pt(1 1 1) at 400 K [39] . This is also a higher coverage than reported by Saliba et al. of θO=0.87 ML after O3 exposures on the 3 alloy at 300 K. In that work, oxygen desorption below 850 K was associated with reduction of oxidic Pt species rather than SnOx species. According to our results from Fig. 5 , oxygen associated with Sn sites gives an O:Sn ratio of 0.5:0.33. This situation probably corresponds to forming SnO1.5 species.

Fig. 6 shows the shift in the Sn(MNN) AES peaks after exposures of 0.1-L NO2 on the 3 alloy at 120 K and then subsequently heating the surface to gradually desorb O2. On the 3 alloy, the lower KE Sn(MNN) peak is located at 426.6 eV, identical to the value for Sn metal [41] . After NO2 exposure and annealing to 700 K, the peak shifts 1.5 to 425.1 eV KE. This indicates oxidation of Sn. However, this shift is much lower than that observed for bulk tin oxides surfaces, where SnO (3 to 423 eV) and SnO2 (7 to 419 eV) are characterized by large shifts when compared to metallic tin [41] . No such shift occurs at 120 or 200 K (not shown), demonstrating that Sn is not yet oxidized at those temperatures. The Sn(MNN) peak shifted to 425.4 eV KE following a 900 K anneal which caused some desorption of O2. This shift can be explained by reduction of some oxidized Sn back to a metallic state in the alloy. The Sn peak returned to its original location at 426.6 eV KE after annealing to 1200 K, which removes all oxygen from the surface. Thus, Sn was completely reduced and the alloy reformed under these conditions. The 1200 K anneal also caused the intensity of the Sn peak to decrease and the LEED pattern to change to a superposition of (2 × 2) and 3 spots. Either desorption of Sn or diffusion of Sn into the bulk could account for this Sn reduction, which has been seen before [42] . This made it necessary to regenerate the 3 alloy after each NO2 experiment by additional Sn dosing and annealing. No shift in the Pt(NOO) AES peak at 237 eV was ever observed during NO2 adsorption at 120 K or after annealing. This is consistent with our assignment of the 804 K O2 TPD peak in Fig. 5 to desorption of O(a) associated with Pt sites and the assignment of O2 desorption above 850 K to decomposition of oxidized Sn species.

The 3 alloy was probed by LEED following a 0.1 L (2 ML) dose of NO2 on the sample at 120 K. This caused no change in the alloy LEED pattern other than to decrease the spot intensity, and no significant changes were observed after annealing to 200 K which desorbs some NO2. After annealing to 280 K, which desorbs some NO, the spots from the (3×3)R30 pattern disappeared and only the (1 × 1) spots of Pt(1 1 1) remained with a diffuse background. On some areas of the crystal, a faint (2 × 2) structure was observed, similar to that seen by Parker et al. for θO=0.25 ML generated after NO2 exposures on Pt(1 1 1). After a subsequent anneal to 700 K, (2 × 2) spots could no longer be seen and only a blurry (1 × 1) pattern remained. Annealing to 900 K desorbed all oxygen except that in the highest temperature O2 TPD peak at 1020 K. This resulted in the appearance of a (4 × 4) LEED pattern, which is consistent with the observations of Batzill et al.

Fig. 7 shows HREELS spectra following deposition of a multilayer film of NO2 (6 layers, θNO2=2.4 ML) on the 3 alloy at 120 K and then subsequently heating the sample to increasing temperatures. The sample was heated to the indicated temperature for 30 s in each case and then re-cooled to 120 K and the spectra taken. Assignments of the energy loss peaks to specific vibrations are given in Table 1.

The experimental techniques of HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The HREELS technique is employed to determine the vibrational modes of adsorbed NO2 and O2 species, providing insights into their chemical bonding and dissociation processes. The AES technique measures the kinetic energy of emitted Auger electrons, which are affected by the binding energy shifts of core levels. This allows for the assessment of oxidation states and the tracking of surface reactions.

The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers are compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions. The activation barriers represent the energy required for atoms to move from one position to another, while the kinetics describe the rates of these movements. By comparing experimental observations with theoretical calculations, researchers can validate the accuracy of DFT models in predicting surface segregation dynamics. This comparison helps refine theoretical approaches and enhances our understanding of surface chemistry and catalytic mechanisms.

The AES shifts observed during NO2 exposure and subsequent heating allow for the quantification of oxidation states and the tracking of oxygen-induced surface segregation. The HREELS spectra provide information on the vibrational modes of adsorbed species, enabling the identification of chemical bonds and the characterization of dissociation processes. These techniques, combined with DFT calculations, offer a comprehensive approach to studying surface reactions and segregation phenomena in bimetallic systems.

Following saturation of the high temperature peak, a second feature appeared at lower temperature with a broad peak at 910 K after large exposures. Based on previous studies of O2 desorption following O3 decomposition on PtSn alloys [37] , we can assign these two peaks to decomposition of Sn-oxide species.

Fig. 4 utilizes the TPD areas from Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 to construct an uptake plot characterizing the adsorption kinetics and decomposition reactions during TPD. The NO2 coverage scale was determined by calibration using the chemisorbed NO2, NO, and O2 TPD peak areas after NO2 adsorption on clean Pt(1 1 1), assuming that 20% of the 0.5-ML NO2 coverage desorbs as NO2 and the rest decomposes cleanly to NO and O2 during TPD as reported by Bartram et al. [5] . The NO and O2 TPD areas in our experiments can be placed on this NO2 coverage scale by assuming the sticking coefficient is constant, independent of coverage on the 3 alloy at 120 K, and noting that no other gas phase products were detected.

Fig. 4 shows that the chemisorbed monolayer coverage is equivalent to 0.4-ML NO2 and O2 desorption at 1100 K represents an atomic oxygen coverage, θO, of 0.2 ML. Thus, oxygen associated with Sn sites on this surface, with ΘSn=0.33 ML, gives an O:Sn ratio of 2:3 corresponding to Sn1.5O species.

Fig. 5 demonstrates that the oxygen coverage can be increased by NO2 exposures on the alloy at higher temperatures. The surface oxygen coverage obtained following exposures at 120 K is limited by coadsorbed NO. The bottom curve in Fig. 5 reproduces the top curve from Fig. 3 . The top curve in Fig. 5 is after a higher NO2 exposure on the alloy at 600 K, which is above the desorption temperature of NO but below that required for O2 desorption. This curve corresponds to θO=1.1 ML. This is a higher coverage than θO=0.25 ML obtained by O2 exposure on Pt(1 1 1) at 150300 K [38] and θO=0.75 ML obtained by NO2 exposure on Pt(1 1 1) at 400 K [39] . This is also a higher coverage than reported by Saliba et al. [37] of θO=0.87 ML after O3 exposures on the 3 alloy at 300 K. In that work, oxygen desorption below 850 K was associated with reduction of oxidic Pt species rather than SnOx species. According to our results from Fig. 5 , oxygen associated with Sn sites gives an O:Sn ratio of 0.5:0.33. This situation probably corresponds to forming SnO1.5 species.

3.2. AES
The origin of the two O2 desorption states seen in the TPD curves shown in Fig. 3 can be probed by chemical shifts in AES that are induced by reaction with adsorbates and indicate the oxidation state of the substrate components. The kinetic energies (KE) of emitted Auger electrons are affected by core level binding energy shifts and so they are useful for qualitatively assessing whether or not oxidation has occurred. Experiments utilizing this approach have been reviewed by Baker and Brundle [40] .

3.3. LEED
The 3 alloy was probed by LEED following a 0.1 L (2 ML) dose of NO2 on the sample at 120 K. This caused no change in the alloy LEED pattern other than to decrease the spot intensity, and no significant changes were observed after annealing to 200 K which desorbs some NO2. After annealing to 280 K, which desorbs some NO, the spots from the (3×3)R30 pattern disappeared and only the (1 × 1) spots of Pt(1 1 1) remained with a diffuse background. On some areas of the crystal, a faint (2 × 2) structure was observed, similar to that seen by Parker et al. [39] for θO=0.25 ML generated after NO2 exposures on Pt(1 1 1). After a subsequent anneal to 700 K, (2 × 2) spots could no longer be seen and only a blurry (1 × 1) pattern remained. Annealing to 900 K desorbed all oxygen except that in the highest temperature O2 TPD peak at 1020 K. This resulted in the appearance of a (4 × 4) LEED pattern, which is consistent with the observations of Batzill et al. [43] . In this condition, only oxygen remains at the surface and Sn is oxidized as shown in Fig. 6 .

This document describes the investigation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) adsorption and reaction on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy using various techniques such as temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). The results show that at 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed as an N,N-bonded dimer (N2O4) on the surface. However, no NO2 or N2O4 desorbs from the monolayer state. The dimer completely dissociates between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300-400 K. The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was about θO=0.4 ML, which can be increased to θO=1.1 ML by NO2 dosing on the alloy surface at 600 K to remove inhibition by coadsorbed NO. Under these conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx. Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation.
