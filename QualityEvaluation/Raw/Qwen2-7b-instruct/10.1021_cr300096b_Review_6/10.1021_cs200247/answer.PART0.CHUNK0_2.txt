This study reveals that the synergy between Pt and Au in Pt-on-Au nanostructures significantly enhances the activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds. The high activity was maintained across various support materials, temperatures, and pressures. The reaction follows a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where cinnamaldehyde adsorbs on the Au surface and reacts with hydrogen atoms activated by Pt entities. The dispersion and size of Pt entities, as well as the PtAu boundary, play crucial roles in this synergy. The dispersion of Pt was assessed using cyclic voltammetry, while the product distribution was found insensitive to changes in temperature and pressure, indicating a specific adsorption mode favored by the Pt entities on Au surfaces.

这项研究揭示了Pt和Au在Pt-on-Au纳米结构中的协同作用显著提高了α,β不饱和化合物氢化反应的活性和选择性。高活性在各种支撑材料、温度和压力下保持稳定。反应遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制，其中cinnamaldehyde吸附在Au表面上并与Pt实体激活的氢原子反应。Pt实体和Au表面的分散度以及PtAu界面在这一协同作用中起着关键作用。通过循环伏安法评估了Pt的分散度，而产物分布对温度和压力的变化不敏感，表明存在特定的吸附模式，由Au表面上的Pt实体所促进。
