[1] "A synergy between Pt and Au in Pt-on-Au nanostructures was observed for the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. The activity of PtmAu nanostructures was 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of monometallic Pt and Au catalysts."
[2] "The high activity of PtmAu nanostructures remained distinct on interacting support materials such as Al2O3 and carbon and when varying the reaction temperature, H2 pressure, or both."
[3] "Kinetic assessments suggest that the hydrogenation reaction could occur according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which cinnamaldehyde adsorbed on the Au surface was attacked by hydrogen atoms activated by Pt entities in the nanostructured PtmAu catalysts."

1. A synergy between platinum (Pt) and gold (Au) in Pt-on-Au nanostructures was observed to enhance the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. The activity of these nanostructures was significantly higher compared to monometallic Pt and Au catalysts, up to 12 orders of magnitude higher.

2. The enhanced activity of PtmAu nanostructures was consistent across various interacting support materials, including alumina (Al2O3) and carbon, and was maintained under changes in reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure, or combinations thereof.

3. Kinetic studies indicated that the hydrogenation process followed a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. This involved the adsorption of cinnamaldehyde on the Au surface, followed by attack by hydrogen atoms that were activated by Pt entities within the nanostructured PtmAu catalyst.

4. The dispersion of Pt, the size of Pt entities, and the PtAu interface influenced the synergistic catalysis. 

5. The presence of fully dispersed Pt entities on the surface of Au nanoparticles favored a specific adsorption mode for cinnamaldehyde (CAL) activation, contributing to the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

1. 在Pt-on-Au纳米结构中，铂（Pt）和金（Au）之间的协同作用被观察到可以增强cinnamaldehyde的化学选择性氢化。与单一金属Pt和Au催化剂相比，这些纳米结构的活性高了12个数量级。

2. PtmAu纳米结构的增强活性在使用铝酸盐（Al2O3）和碳等交互支持材料时保持一致，并且在改变反应温度、氢气压力或两者的组合时仍然稳定。

3. 动力学研究表明，氢化过程遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制。这涉及到cinnamaldehyde在Au表面的吸附，随后是激活的氢原子对由PtmAu催化剂中的Pt实体作用的攻击。

4. Pt的分散度、Pt实体的大小以及PtAu界面影响了协同催化。

5. 在Au纳米粒子表面存在完全分散的Pt实体有助于特定的吸附模式，从而促进cinnamaldehyde（CAL）的活化，这为氢化过程的选择性和效率做出了贡献。
