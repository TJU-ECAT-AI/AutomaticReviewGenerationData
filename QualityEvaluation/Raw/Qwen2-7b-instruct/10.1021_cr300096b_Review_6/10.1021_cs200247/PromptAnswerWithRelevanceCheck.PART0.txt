<p>The dispersion of Pt (DPt) in the reference Pt/SiO2 catalysts was determined by H2-TPD measurement, which was conducted on homemade equipment as described previously. (33)</p>
<p>The sample was first reduced at 300 C in 5 vol % H2Ar flow for 1 h and then held at 150 C for 1 h before cooling to room temperature in the same gas flow. The gas flow was then switched to a flow of ultrahigh purity Ar (99.999%), which was further online purified by flowing through two traps containing 5A zeolite and MnOx-based deoxidant, respectively. The temperature ramp was 10 C/min.</p>

This study reveals that the synergy between Pt and Au in Pt-on-Au nanostructures significantly enhances the activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds. The high activity was maintained across various support materials, temperatures, and pressures. The reaction follows a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where cinnamaldehyde adsorbs on the Au surface and reacts with hydrogen atoms activated by Pt entities. The dispersion and size of Pt entities, as well as the PtAu boundary, play crucial roles in this synergy. The dispersion of Pt was assessed using cyclic voltammetry, while the product distribution was found insensitive to changes in temperature and pressure, indicating a specific adsorption mode favored by the Pt entities on Au surfaces.

1. A synergy between platinum (Pt) and gold (Au) in Pt-on-Au nanostructures was observed to enhance the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. The activity of these nanostructures was significantly higher compared to monometallic Pt and Au catalysts, up to 12 orders of magnitude higher.

2. The enhanced activity of PtmAu nanostructures was consistent across various interacting support materials, including alumina (Al2O3) and carbon, and was maintained under changes in reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure, or combinations thereof.

3. Kinetic studies indicated that the hydrogenation process followed a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. This involved the adsorption of cinnamaldehyde on the Au surface, followed by attack by hydrogen atoms that were activated by Pt entities within the nanostructured PtmAu catalyst.

4. The dispersion of Pt, the size of Pt entities, and the PtAu interface influenced the synergistic catalysis. 

5. The presence of fully dispersed Pt entities on the surface of Au nanoparticles favored a specific adsorption mode for cinnamaldehyde (CAL) activation, contributing to the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

3. 动力学研究表明，氢化过程遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制。这涉及到cinnamaldehyde在Au表面的吸附，随后是激活的氢原子对由PtmAu催化剂中的Pt实体作用的攻击。

4. Pt的分散度、Pt实体的大小以及PtAu界面影响了协同催化。

5. 在Au纳米粒子表面存在完全分散的Pt实体有助于特定的吸附模式，从而促进cinnamaldehyde（CAL）的活化，这为氢化过程的选择性和效率做出了贡献。
