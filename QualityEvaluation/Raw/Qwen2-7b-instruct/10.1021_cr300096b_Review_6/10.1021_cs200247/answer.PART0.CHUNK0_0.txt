1. The dispersion of Pt in the reference Pt/SiO2 catalysts was quantified using H2-TPD measurement. The process involved reducing the sample at 300°C with 5 vol% H2Ar flow for 1 hour, holding it at 150°C for 1 hour, cooling it to room temperature in the same gas flow, and then switching the gas flow to ultrahigh purity Ar (99.999%) further purified through two traps containing 5A zeolite and MnOx-based deoxidant. The dispersion was determined by counting the number of H atoms in the desorbed H2 molecules measured from the H2-TPD experiment.

1. 参考Pt/SiO2催化剂中Pt的分散度通过H2-TPD测量确定。该过程包括将样品在300°C下用5vol% H2Ar流还原1小时，然后在相同气体流中保持在150°C 1小时，冷却至室温，然后将气体流切换为纯度为99.999%的Ar，并进一步在线净化通过包含5A沸石和MnOx基脱氧剂的两个陷阱。通过从H2-TPD实验测量释放的H2分子中的氢原子数来确定分散度。
