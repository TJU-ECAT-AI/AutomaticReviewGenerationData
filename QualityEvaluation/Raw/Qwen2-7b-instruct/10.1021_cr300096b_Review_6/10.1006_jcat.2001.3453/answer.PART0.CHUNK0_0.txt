The low-temperature hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of thiophene was studied over Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces using Auger electron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, and low-energy electron diffraction. The Ni/Pt(111) surface, with nickel coverage at about one monolayer, showed enhanced reactivity compared to pure Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) surfaces. Specifically, the bimetallic surface decomposed thiophene at a significantly lower temperature (230 K) compared to the Ni(111) film (280 K). Both surfaces also produced butadiene. Preadsorption of hydrogen atoms at liquid nitrogen temperatures on the Ni/Pt(111) surface further increased the production of gas-phase butene by a factor of 2.2.

对Ni/Pt(111)双金属表面进行了低温硫化氢脱硫（HDS）研究，使用了Auger电子能谱、温度程序脱附和低能电子衍射技术。镍覆盖层约为一层单分子层的Ni/Pt(111)表面在反应活性上与纯Pt(111)表面和厚Ni(111)薄膜表面相比有增强。具体而言，Ni/Pt(111)表面在比Ni(111)薄膜低得多的温度（230 K）下分解了噻吩，而Ni(111)薄膜的温度为280 K。两个表面都产生了丁二烯。在液氮温度下预吸附氢原子到Ni/Pt(111)表面上进一步提高了气体相丁烯的生产量，提高了2.2倍。
