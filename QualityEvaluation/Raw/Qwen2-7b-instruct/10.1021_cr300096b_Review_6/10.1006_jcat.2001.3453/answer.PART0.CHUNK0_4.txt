3.2.2. Product selectivity.
Based on the obtained TPD results, it is clear that a fraction of thiophene undergoes complete decomposition on all three surfaces. The complete decomposition can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) → 4C(ads) + 2H2(g) + S(ads) [3] on Pt(111) c 4c 2c c on Ni/Pt(111) f 4 f 2 f f on Ni(111).

The reaction to produce butene, seen on Ni/Pt(111) and the Ni(111) film, can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) + 4H(ads) → C4H8(g) + S(ads) [4] g 2g g g on Ni(111) d 2d d d on Ni/Pt(111).

Finally, the reaction to produce butadiene, seen on both Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111), can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) + 2H(ads) → C4H6(g) + S(ads) [5] b b b b on Pt(111) e e e e on Ni/Pt(111).

From the AES measurements of the C (272 eV)/Pt (237 eV) and S (150 eV)/Pt (237 eV) ratios after the TPD experiments on Pt(111), the values for a and b were estimated to be 0.031 and 0.022, respectively. These atomic ratios were calculated using the standard sensitivity factors for C, S, and Pt (20).

The ratio of the TPD peak areas of butadiene between Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111), after subtracting the contributions from the cracking patterns of thiophene and butene, respectively, was calculated to be 2.65. This leads to the following relationship: C4H6 on Pt / C4H6 on Ni/Pt = 2.65 = b / e.

In order to calculate the amount of butene produced on Ni/Pt(111) (d value), the mass spectrometer sensitivity was checked by dosing butadiene and butene separately into the chamber at the same pressure. The peak ratio of the mass 39 from butadiene and mass 41 from butene was found to be 0.75. Therefore, the peak areas of butene were multiplied by 0.75 to correct for the different sensitivity factors for the mass spectrometry measurements. This leads to the following relationship: C4H6 on Ni/Pt / C4H8 on Ni/Pt = 0.19 = e / d.

Furthermore, the comparison of the relative intensities of masses 56 and 41 amu in the TPD spectra also suggests that different butene isomers are produced on Ni/Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) film. On the thick Ni(111) film, the intensity ratio of 56 amu / 41 amu is approximately 0.33, which is expected for the cracking pattern of 1-butene. On the other hand, the ratio is approximately 0.48 on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface, which is indicative of 2-butene.

The selectivity towards the production of C4 hydrocarbons on the three surfaces is relatively similar. However, the overall activities, defined as the number of decomposed thiophene per Pt atom basis, are larger for the Ni/Pt(111) surface and the Ni(111) film than that for Pt(111). The selectivity for producing butene on the Ni/Pt(111) surface is 41.6%, with an activity of 0.077 thiophene molecules per metal atom. The selectivity for producing butadiene on both Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) surfaces is 41.5% and 41.6% respectively, with activities of 0.022 and 0.032 thiophene molecules per metal atom. The presence of hydrogen preadsorption on the Ni/Pt(111) surface significantly increases the production of C4 hydrocarbons, enhancing the activity for the production of butene by a factor of 2.2. This promotional effect for the production of C4 hydrocarbons is not observed on Pt(111) or thick Ni(111) film, suggesting that the presence of Ni enhances the hydrogenation activity of Pt(111).

三种表面对于C4烃类产物的选择性相对相似。然而，定义为每Pt原子分解硫醇分子数的总体活性，Ni/Pt(111)表面和Ni(111)薄膜比Pt(111)表面要大。Ni/Pt(111)表面上生产丁烯的选定性为41.6%，每金属原子产生0.077硫醇分子。两个Pt(111)和Ni/Pt(111)表面上生产丁二烯的选定性分别为41.5%和41.6%，每金属原子活性分别为0.022和0.032硫醇分子。氢预吸附在Ni/Pt(111)表面上显著增加了C4烃类产物的生产，将生产丁烯的活性提高了2.2倍。在Pt(111)或厚Ni(111)薄膜上未观察到这种C4产物生成的促进效果，表明Ni的存在增强了Pt(111)的氢化活性。
