The low-temperature hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of thiophene was studied over Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces using Auger electron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, and low-energy electron diffraction. The Ni/Pt(111) surface, with nickel coverage at about one monolayer, showed enhanced reactivity compared to pure Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) surfaces. Specifically, the bimetallic surface decomposed thiophene at a significantly lower temperature (230 K) compared to the Ni(111) film (280 K). Both surfaces also produced butadiene. Preadsorption of hydrogen atoms at liquid nitrogen temperatures on the Ni/Pt(111) surface further increased the production of gas-phase butene by a factor of 2.2.

The monolayer Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surface exhibits increased reactivity and activity in the low-temperature hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of thiophene compared to pure Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) surfaces. This increased activity is attributed to the weak metal-hydrogen (MH) bond on the Ni/Pt(111) surface, which facilitates the decomposition of thiophene at a lower temperature. Specifically, the desorption of butene occurs at 230 K on the Ni/Pt(111) surface, whereas it happens at 280 K on the Ni(111) film. The overall activity towards thiophene decomposition on the Ni/Pt(111) surface is higher, with 0.077 thiophene molecules decomposed per metal atom, compared to 0.053 thiophene molecules per metal atom on the Pt(111) surface. The weak MH bond is proposed to be responsible for the enhanced HDS activity on the Ni/Pt(111) surface. Additionally, both the Ni/Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) surfaces are capable of producing butene, but the Pt(111) surface generates butadiene at a lower yield. The low-temperature peak associated with the weak MH bond on the Ni/Pt(111) surface is responsible for the efficient production of butene.

在Ni/Pt(111)双金属表面与纯Pt(111)和厚Ni(111)表面相比，在低温度下进行噻吩的氢脱硫化（HDS）时表现出增强的反应性和活性。这种增强的活性归因于Ni/Pt(111)表面上较弱的金属-氢（MH）键，这使得噻吩在较低温度下分解成为可能。具体而言，Ni/Pt(111)表面上但烯的脱附发生在230 K，而Ni(111)薄膜上的脱附温度为280 K。Ni/Pt(111)表面的总体活性对于噻吩分解更高，每金属原子可分解0.077个噻吩分子，而Pt(111)表面则为0.053个噻吩分子每金属原子。较弱的MH键被认为是Ni/Pt(111)表面上增强HDS活性的原因。此外，Ni/Pt(111)和厚Ni(111)表面都能生成但烯，但Pt(111)表面生成的但二烯量较少。与Ni/Pt(111)表面上关联的较弱MH键的低温峰负责高效生产但烯。

在低温下，研究了Ni/Pt(111)双金属表面的噻吩氢脱硫化（HDS），使用了电子能谱、程序升温脱附和低能电子衍射技术。对于大约一层镍覆盖的双金属表面的反应性进行了比较，与纯Pt(111)表面和厚Ni(111)薄膜相比。所有表面都能分解噻吩，但Ni/Pt(111)和厚Ni(111)表面产生了丁烯。Pt(111)和Ni/Pt(111)表面也产生了丁二烯。液氮温度下预吸附的原子氢在ML双金属Ni/Pt表面上进一步提高了生成气相丁烯的活性，增加了2.2倍。Ni/Pt(111)表面的增强HDS活性归因于较弱的MH键，这是纯金属表面所没有的。

3.2.2. Product selectivity.
Based on the obtained TPD results, it is clear that a fraction of thiophene undergoes complete decomposition on all three surfaces. The complete decomposition can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) → 4C(ads) + 2H2(g) + S(ads) [3] a 4a 2a a on Pt(111) c 4c 2c c on Ni/Pt(111) f 4 f 2 f f on Ni(111).

The reaction to produce butene, seen on Ni/Pt(111) and the Ni(111) film, can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) + 4H(ads) → C4H8(g) + S(ads) [4] g 2g g g on Ni(111) d 2d d d on Ni/Pt(111).

Finally, the reaction to produce butadiene, seen on both Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111), can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) + 2H(ads) → C4H6(g) + S(ads) [5] b b b b on Pt(111) e e e e on Ni/Pt(111).

The selectivity for the three surfaces toward the production of C4 hydrocarbons is quite similar. However, the overall activities, defined as the number of decomposed thiophene on a per Pt atom basis, are notably larger for the Ni/Pt(111) surface and the Ni(111) film compared to Pt(111). The enhanced activity on the Ni/Pt(111) surface is attributed to the weak MH bond, which facilitates the low-temperature HDS of thiophene.

The reaction to produce butene, seen on Ni/Pt(111) and the Ni(111) film, can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) + 4H(ads) → C4H8(g) + S(ads) [4] g 2g g g on Ni(111) d 2d d d on Ni/Pt(111).

Finally, the reaction to produce butadiene, seen on both Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111), can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) + 2H(ads) → C4H6(g) + S(ads) [5] b b b b on Pt(111) e e e e on Ni/Pt(111).

From the AES measurements of the C (272 eV)/Pt (237 eV) and S (150 eV)/Pt (237 eV) ratios after the TPD experiments on Pt(111), the values for a and b were estimated to be 0.031 and 0.022, respectively. These atomic ratios were calculated using the standard sensitivity factors for C, S, and Pt (20).

The ratio of the TPD peak areas of butadiene between Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111), after subtracting the contributions from the cracking patterns of thiophene and butene, respectively, was calculated to be 2.65. This leads to the following relationship: C4H6 on Pt / C4H6 on Ni/Pt = 2.65 = b / e.

In order to calculate the amount of butene produced on Ni/Pt(111) (d value), the mass spectrometer sensitivity was checked by dosing butadiene and butene separately into the chamber at the same pressure. The peak ratio of the mass 39 from butadiene and mass 41 from butene was found to be 0.75. Therefore, the peak areas of butene were multiplied by 0.75 to correct for the different sensitivity factors for the mass spectrometry measurements. This leads to the following relationship: C4H6 on Ni/Pt / C4H8 on Ni/Pt = 0.19 = e / d.

Furthermore, the comparison of the relative intensities of masses 56 and 41 amu in the TPD spectra also suggests that different butene isomers are produced on Ni/Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) film. On the thick Ni(111) film, the intensity ratio of 56 amu / 41 amu is approximately 0.33, which is expected for the cracking pattern of 1-butene. On the other hand, the ratio is approximately 0.48 on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface, which is indicative of 2-butene.

The selectivity towards the production of C4 hydrocarbons on the three surfaces is relatively similar. However, the overall activities, defined as the number of decomposed thiophene per Pt atom basis, are larger for the Ni/Pt(111) surface and the Ni(111) film than that for Pt(111). The selectivity for producing butene on the Ni/Pt(111) surface is 41.6%, with an activity of 0.077 thiophene molecules per metal atom. The selectivity for producing butadiene on both Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) surfaces is 41.5% and 41.6% respectively, with activities of 0.022 and 0.032 thiophene molecules per metal atom. The presence of hydrogen preadsorption on the Ni/Pt(111) surface significantly increases the production of C4 hydrocarbons, enhancing the activity for the production of butene by a factor of 2.2. This promotional effect for the production of C4 hydrocarbons is not observed on Pt(111) or thick Ni(111) film, suggesting that the presence of Ni enhances the hydrogenation activity of Pt(111).

三种表面对于C4烃类产物的选择性相对相似。然而，定义为每Pt原子分解硫醇分子数的总体活性，Ni/Pt(111)表面和Ni(111)薄膜比Pt(111)表面要大。Ni/Pt(111)表面上生产丁烯的选定性为41.6%，每金属原子产生0.077硫醇分子。两个Pt(111)和Ni/Pt(111)表面上生产丁二烯的选定性分别为41.5%和41.6%，每金属原子活性分别为0.022和0.032硫醇分子。氢预吸附在Ni/Pt(111)表面上显著增加了C4烃类产物的生产，将生产丁烯的活性提高了2.2倍。在Pt(111)或厚Ni(111)薄膜上未观察到这种C4产物生成的促进效果，表明Ni的存在增强了Pt(111)的氢化活性。
