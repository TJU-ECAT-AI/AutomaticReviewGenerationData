3.2.2. Product selectivity.
Based on the obtained TPD results, it is clear that a fraction of thiophene undergoes complete decomposition on all three surfaces. The complete decomposition can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) → 4C(ads) + 2H2(g) + S(ads) [3] a 4a 2a a on Pt(111) c 4c 2c c on Ni/Pt(111) f 4 f 2 f f on Ni(111).

The reaction to produce butene, seen on Ni/Pt(111) and the Ni(111) film, can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) + 4H(ads) → C4H8(g) + S(ads) [4] g 2g g g on Ni(111) d 2d d d on Ni/Pt(111).

Finally, the reaction to produce butadiene, seen on both Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111), can be expressed as C4H4S(ads) + 2H(ads) → C4H6(g) + S(ads) [5] b b b b on Pt(111) e e e e on Ni/Pt(111).

The selectivity for the three surfaces toward the production of C4 hydrocarbons is quite similar. However, the overall activities, defined as the number of decomposed thiophene on a per Pt atom basis, are notably larger for the Ni/Pt(111) surface and the Ni(111) film compared to Pt(111). The enhanced activity on the Ni/Pt(111) surface is attributed to the weak MH bond, which facilitates the low-temperature HDS of thiophene.

三种表面对于C4烃类产物的选择性相当接近。然而，整体活性，定义为每Pt原子分解的噻吩数量，对Ni/Pt(111)表面和Ni(111)薄膜的活性显著更高，与Pt(111)相比。Ni/Pt(111)表面的增强活性归因于较弱的MH键，这促进了噻吩的低温HDS。
