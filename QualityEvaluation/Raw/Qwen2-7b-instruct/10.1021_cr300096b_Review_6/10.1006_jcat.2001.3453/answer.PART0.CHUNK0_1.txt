The monolayer Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surface exhibits increased reactivity and activity in the low-temperature hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of thiophene compared to pure Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) surfaces. This increased activity is attributed to the weak metal-hydrogen (MH) bond on the Ni/Pt(111) surface, which facilitates the decomposition of thiophene at a lower temperature. Specifically, the desorption of butene occurs at 230 K on the Ni/Pt(111) surface, whereas it happens at 280 K on the Ni(111) film. The overall activity towards thiophene decomposition on the Ni/Pt(111) surface is higher, with 0.077 thiophene molecules decomposed per metal atom, compared to 0.053 thiophene molecules per metal atom on the Pt(111) surface. The weak MH bond is proposed to be responsible for the enhanced HDS activity on the Ni/Pt(111) surface. Additionally, both the Ni/Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) surfaces are capable of producing butene, but the Pt(111) surface generates butadiene at a lower yield. The low-temperature peak associated with the weak MH bond on the Ni/Pt(111) surface is responsible for the efficient production of butene.

在Ni/Pt(111)双金属表面与纯Pt(111)和厚Ni(111)表面相比，在低温度下进行噻吩的氢脱硫化（HDS）时表现出增强的反应性和活性。这种增强的活性归因于Ni/Pt(111)表面上较弱的金属-氢（MH）键，这使得噻吩在较低温度下分解成为可能。具体而言，Ni/Pt(111)表面上但烯的脱附发生在230 K，而Ni(111)薄膜上的脱附温度为280 K。Ni/Pt(111)表面的总体活性对于噻吩分解更高，每金属原子可分解0.077个噻吩分子，而Pt(111)表面则为0.053个噻吩分子每金属原子。较弱的MH键被认为是Ni/Pt(111)表面上增强HDS活性的原因。此外，Ni/Pt(111)和厚Ni(111)表面都能生成但烯，但Pt(111)表面生成的但二烯量较少。与Ni/Pt(111)表面上关联的较弱MH键的低温峰负责高效生产但烯。
