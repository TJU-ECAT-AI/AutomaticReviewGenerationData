The low-temperature hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of thiophene was studied on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces using techniques like Auger electron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, and low-energy electron diffraction. The reactivity of these surfaces with approximately one monolayer of nickel coverage was compared to Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) surfaces. All surfaces were able to decompose thiophene, but Ni/Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) surfaces produced butene. The Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) surfaces also produced butadiene. Preadsorbed atomic hydrogen on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface enhanced the activity towards producing gas-phase butene by a factor of 2.2. The increased HDS activity on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface was attributed to the weak MH bond, not observed on the pure metal surfaces.

在低温下，研究了Ni/Pt(111)双金属表面的噻吩氢脱硫化（HDS），使用了电子能谱、程序升温脱附和低能电子衍射技术。对于大约一层镍覆盖的双金属表面的反应性进行了比较，与纯Pt(111)表面和厚Ni(111)薄膜相比。所有表面都能分解噻吩，但Ni/Pt(111)和厚Ni(111)表面产生了丁烯。Pt(111)和Ni/Pt(111)表面也产生了丁二烯。液氮温度下预吸附的原子氢在ML双金属Ni/Pt表面上进一步提高了生成气相丁烯的活性，增加了2.2倍。Ni/Pt(111)表面的增强HDS活性归因于较弱的MH键，这是纯金属表面所没有的。
