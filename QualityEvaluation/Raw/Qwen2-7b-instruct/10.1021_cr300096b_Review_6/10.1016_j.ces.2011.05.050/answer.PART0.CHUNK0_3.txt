1. An accurate description of catalytic reactions relies heavily on the ability to detail each step of the chemical transformation and assign a rate constant to every step. This review focuses on mean-field microkinetic models and their refinement across scales. Parameter uncertainties in catalyst design are discussed, highlighting that adsorbate-adsorbate interactions can significantly influence material design. Each reaction is represented by a formula where each term corresponds to a specific reactant, and the reaction rate follows mass action kinetics. Thermodynamic consistency is crucial in microkinetic model development, often overlooked in the combination of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. To adjust surface reaction properties, the activation energy is modified by the proximity factor, which reflects the transition state's location along the reaction coordinate. This adjustment is made based on the difference between the DFT calculated activation energy and the heat of surface reaction through the gas-phase thermodynamic loop. Group additivity offers a simple and cost-effective method to predict the thermophysical properties of molecules, which is particularly useful for screening adsorbates before more accurate methods are applied. Linear scaling relations and transferability of thermochemistry among metals enable the prediction of adsorption energies on different surfaces based on the atomic binding energy of heteroatoms. DFT-based linear free energy relationships facilitate the prediction of kinetic properties from the thermodynamic properties of adsorbates.
