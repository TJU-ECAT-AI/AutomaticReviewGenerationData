How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "Auger spectroscopy experiments were also performed and indicated that the Ni/Pt mixing at higher temperatures (600900 K) occurs on the order of seconds to minutes."
[2] "MD simulations were performed using the embedded atom method potential."
[3] "It was also shown that the rate of mixing increases rapidly with temperature, resulting in the formation and reconstruction of active sites for the underlying elementary reactions."
[4] "Simulations indicate that higher temperatures, smaller Ni coverages and the presence of Pt steps (in this case there is inlayer mixing) facilitate mixing between Ni and Pt."
[5] "Accelerated MD gave insights on the behavior of the system at longer time scales (on the order of milliseconds), whereas the infinite time behavior was investigated through simulated annealing."
[6] "Nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations provided a static picture of the potential energy surface and elucidated possible pathways for Ni diffusion in the subsurface."

1. Auger spectroscopy experiments were utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The measurements of segregation kinetics and activation barriers were compared with DFT predictions, revealing consistency in the trends observed.

2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing the embedded atom method potential were conducted to gain insights into the system's behavior at longer time scales, approximately milliseconds. Simulated annealing was utilized to investigate the system's infinite time behavior.

3. It was demonstrated that the rate of mixing between Ni and Pt increases rapidly with temperature, leading to the formation and reconstruction of active sites for underlying elementary reactions. Higher temperatures, smaller Ni coverages, and the presence of Pt steps facilitated the mixing between Ni and Pt.

4. Accelerated MD simulations provided additional understanding of the system's behavior at longer time scales, complementing the insights gained from simulated annealing. 

5. Nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations helped construct a static picture of the potential energy surface and elucidated possible pathways for Ni diffusion in the subsurface region.

1. 原位 Auger 谱实验被用来验证并量化氧诱导的表面异质化，特别是 Ni 和 Co 在 Pt-3d-Pt(111) 双金属系统中的表面异质化。通过与第一原理计算预测比较，测量的异质化动力学和激活势垒趋势一致。

2. 使用嵌入原子方法势能的分子动力学（MD）模拟被进行，以获取系统在大约毫秒的时间尺度上的行为。通过模拟退火研究了系统的无限时间行为。

3. 表明随着温度的升高，Ni 和 Pt 的混合速率迅速增加，导致了底层基本反应活性位点的形成和重建。较高的温度、较低的 Ni 覆盖度以及 Pt 步的存在促进了 Ni 和 Pt 之间的混合。

4. 加速的 MD 模拟提供了系统在较长时间尺度上行为的额外理解，补充了模拟退火获得的见解。

5. 推挤弹性带（NEB）计算帮助构建了亚表面区域 Ni 扩散的静态能量表面图，并阐明了可能的扩散路径。
