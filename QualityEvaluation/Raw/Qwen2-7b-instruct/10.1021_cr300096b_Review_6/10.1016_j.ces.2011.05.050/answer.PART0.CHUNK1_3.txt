[1] "In the specific example, the activation energies were estimated using the UBI-QEP method and the refinement was done by incorporating NN interactions using DFT calculations into the UBI-QEP framework."
[2] "Comparison of models to experiments across scales remains essential in improving our understanding and continuing to build better models."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS measures the energy loss of electrons when they interact with the surface, which can reveal the presence of segregated atoms. AES detects the secondary electrons emitted from the surface and can identify the elemental composition, including the segregation of subsurface atoms. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers from these techniques can then be compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. This comparison helps validate the accuracy of DFT calculations in predicting the behavior of subsurface atoms in bimetallic systems. It also aids in refining the DFT models to better capture the complex interactions and dynamics in these materials.

实验技术如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和AES（阿勒尔电子能谱）可以验证并量化氧诱导表面掺杂的亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的分布。HREELS通过测量与表面相互作用时电子的能量损失来揭示掺杂原子的存在。AES检测从表面发出的次级电子，并可识别元素组成，包括亚表面原子的分布。这些技术所测得的掺杂动力学和激活壁垒可以与DFT（密度泛函理论）预测进行比较。这种比较有助于验证DFT计算在预测这些材料行为方面的准确性。它也有助于改进DFT模型，更好地捕捉这些材料中复杂的相互作用和动态。
