[1] "With the interest for more energy efficient, selective and renewable chemical processes intensifying, the need to control chemical reactions at the molecular level is also rapidly increasing."
[2] "Controlling reactions at the molecular level depends critically on our ability to describe the elementary reaction steps involved in a chemical transformation from reactants to products and assign a rate constant to each individual step."
[3] "Still, our ability to describe, and eventually control, chemical transformations by first-principles modeling, at the molecular level, is hindered by multiple challenges."
[4] "Given a list of reaction events and their rate constants, adsorbates arrange themselves in spatial configurations or patterns, as a result of the collective behavior of the ensemble of all species."
[5] "At the mesoscopic scale (middle of Fig. 1 ), the collective behavior has to be averaged over length and time scales that are much larger than the characteristic length and time scale of the underlying pattern  or what is known as the correlation length  in order to compute the reaction rate."
[6] "As a result, the catalyst is dynamic in response to its local environment, such as the gases and adsorbates present, the temperature, the pressure, etc. Catalyst dynamics, such as reconstruction and isomerization between various conformations, maybe more common than we currently think, but their effect on the kinetics of catalytic reactions is poorly understood."
