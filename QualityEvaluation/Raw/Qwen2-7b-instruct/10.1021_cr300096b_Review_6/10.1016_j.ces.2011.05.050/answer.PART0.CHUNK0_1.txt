A review of multiscale modeling of metal-catalyzed reactions: Mechanism development for complexity and emergent behavior

Abstract We review and provide a perspective on multiscale modeling of catalytic reactions with emphasis on mechanism development and application to complex and emergent systems. 

Computation-driven catalyst design is reviewed and a new platform for discovery of materials with emergent behavior is introduced. The effect of parameter uncertainty on catalyst design is discussed; it is shown that adsorbateadsorbate interactions can profoundly impact materials design. 

Spatiotemporal averaging of microscopic events via the kinetic Monte Carlo method for realistic reaction mechanisms is discussed as an alternative to mean-field modeling. A hierarchical multiscale modeling strategy is proposed as a means of addressing (some of) the complexity of catalytic reactions.

Structure-based microkinetic modeling is next reviewed to account for nanoparticle size and shape effects and structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions. It is hypothesized that catalysts with multiple sites of comparable activity can exhibit structure sensitivity that depends strongly on operating conditions.

It is shown that two descriptor models are necessary to describe the thermochemistry of adsorbates on nanoparticles. Multiscale and accelerated methods for computing free energies in solution, while accounting explicitly for solvent effects in catalytic reactions, are briefly touched upon with the acid catalyzed dehydration of fructose in water as an example.

Finally, we provide a summary and outlook.
