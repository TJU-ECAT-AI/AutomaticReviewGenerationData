How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "Auger spectroscopy experiments were also performed and indicated that the Ni/Pt mixing at higher temperatures (600900 K) occurs on the order of seconds to minutes."

[2] "At higher temperatures, these structures are dynamic in nature and may play a crucial role in determining the reactivity of the catalyst, as they result in the formation and reconstruction of active sites for the underlying elementary reactions."

[3] "Simulations indicate that higher temperatures, smaller Ni coverages and the presence of Pt steps (in this case there is inlayer mixing) facilitate mixing between Ni and Pt."

[4] "Accelerated MD gave insights on the behavior of the system at longer time scales (on the order of milliseconds), whereas the infinite time behavior was investigated through simulated annealing."

[5] "By means of NEB calculations and analysis of the MD trajectories, using the van Hove correlation function, it was demonstrated that Ni migration occurs through correlated hops."

The experimental techniques of HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. The measured results are compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. The HREELS and AES experiments indicate that the Ni/Pt mixing at higher temperatures (600-900 K) occurs on the order of seconds to minutes. The dynamic nature of these structures plays a crucial role in determining the reactivity of the catalyst. Higher temperatures, smaller Ni coverages, and the presence of Pt steps facilitate mixing between Ni and Pt. Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide insights on the behavior of the system at longer time scales (milliseconds). Simulated Annealing investigates the infinite time behavior of the system. Ni migration occurs through correlated hops, as demonstrated by NEB (Nudged Elastic Band) calculations and analysis of the MD trajectories.

使用HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子能谱）等实验技术来验证并量化氧诱导的表面相分离，特别是在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，特别是Ni和Co亚表面原子。这些技术用于测量相分离动力学和活化势垒，并将测量结果与DFT（密度泛函理论）预测进行比较。HREELS和AES实验表明，在600至900 K的高温下，Ni/Pt混合发生在秒到分钟的时间尺度上。这些动态结构的性质对于确定催化剂活性至关重要。在较高温度、较小Ni覆盖度和存在Pt台阶的情况下，Ni和Pt之间的混合更容易发生。加速分子动力学（MD）模拟提供了系统在更长时间尺度（毫秒级）上的行为见解。模拟退火研究了系统的无限时间行为。Ni迁移通过相关跳跃发生，这是由NEB（拉伸弹性带）计算和MD轨迹分析证明的。
