How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

In the realm of searching for catalysts with improved activity and/or reduced cost, bimetallic catalysts may be used. Typically, a dominant surface species is assumed and an overall LHHW rate expression is derived using a priori assumptions (see Section 3 ). The reaction rate depends on a single descriptor. By varying the value of the descriptor, a volcano curve can be generated. The values of binding energies of known materials are put on the volcano curve and additional ones can be computed via DFT. The composition of mixed alloys that maximizes activity (max of volcano curve) can be predicted by simple interpolation of the properties of single metals.

Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms like Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques provide information on the surface composition and the distribution of elements in the subsurface layers. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers can then be compared with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions. The volcano curve approach is used to generate a curve that relates the activity of the catalyst to the binding energies of the dominant surface species. By placing the values of known materials on this curve and interpolating for additional materials, the composition of mixed alloys that maximizes activity can be predicted. This prediction is based on the assumption that the reaction rate depends on a single descriptor, which is the binding energy in this case.

实验技术，如HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子能谱），可以验证并量化氧诱导表面分层在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）。这些技术提供了关于表面组成和子表层元素分布的信息。通过测量的分层动力学和激活壁垒与DFT（密度泛函理论）预测进行比较。火山曲线方法用于生成与主导表面物种的结合能相关联的活性曲线。将已知材料的价值放置在曲线上，并对额外的材料进行插值，可以预测最大化活性的合金组成。这种预测基于假设反应速率取决于单个描述符，即结合能在这种情况下。
