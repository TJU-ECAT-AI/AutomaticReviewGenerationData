A review of multiscale modeling of metal-catalyzed reactions: Mechanism development for complexity and emergent behavior

Abstract We review and provide a perspective on multiscale modeling of catalytic reactions with emphasis on mechanism development and application to complex and emergent systems. 

Computation-driven catalyst design is reviewed and a new platform for discovery of materials with emergent behavior is introduced. The effect of parameter uncertainty on catalyst design is discussed; it is shown that adsorbateadsorbate interactions can profoundly impact materials design. 

Spatiotemporal averaging of microscopic events via the kinetic Monte Carlo method for realistic reaction mechanisms is discussed as an alternative to mean-field modeling. A hierarchical multiscale modeling strategy is proposed as a means of addressing (some of) the complexity of catalytic reactions.

Structure-based microkinetic modeling is next reviewed to account for nanoparticle size and shape effects and structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions. It is hypothesized that catalysts with multiple sites of comparable activity can exhibit structure sensitivity that depends strongly on operating conditions.

It is shown that two descriptor models are necessary to describe the thermochemistry of adsorbates on nanoparticles. Multiscale and accelerated methods for computing free energies in solution, while accounting explicitly for solvent effects in catalytic reactions, are briefly touched upon with the acid catalyzed dehydration of fructose in water as an example.

Finally, we provide a summary and outlook.

Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

1. An accurate description of catalytic reactions relies heavily on the ability to detail each step of the chemical transformation and assign a rate constant to every step. This review focuses on mean-field microkinetic models and their refinement across scales. Parameter uncertainties in catalyst design are discussed, highlighting that adsorbate-adsorbate interactions can significantly influence material design. Each reaction is represented by a formula where each term corresponds to a specific reactant, and the reaction rate follows mass action kinetics. Thermodynamic consistency is crucial in microkinetic model development, often overlooked in the combination of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. To adjust surface reaction properties, the activation energy is modified by the proximity factor, which reflects the transition state's location along the reaction coordinate. This adjustment is made based on the difference between the DFT calculated activation energy and the heat of surface reaction through the gas-phase thermodynamic loop. Group additivity offers a simple and cost-effective method to predict the thermophysical properties of molecules, which is particularly useful for screening adsorbates before more accurate methods are applied. Linear scaling relations and transferability of thermochemistry among metals enable the prediction of adsorption energies on different surfaces based on the atomic binding energy of heteroatoms. DFT-based linear free energy relationships facilitate the prediction of kinetic properties from the thermodynamic properties of adsorbates.

In the realm of searching for catalysts with improved activity and/or reduced cost, bimetallic catalysts may be used. Typically, a dominant surface species is assumed and an overall LHHW rate expression is derived using a priori assumptions (see Section 3 ). The reaction rate depends on a single descriptor. By varying the value of the descriptor, a volcano curve can be generated. The values of binding energies of known materials are put on the volcano curve and additional ones can be computed via DFT. The composition of mixed alloys that maximizes activity (max of volcano curve) can be predicted by simple interpolation of the properties of single metals.

By placing the values of known materials on this curve and interpolating for additional materials, the composition of mixed alloys that maximizes activity can be predicted. This prediction is based on the assumption that the reaction rate depends on a single descriptor, which is the binding energy in this case.
