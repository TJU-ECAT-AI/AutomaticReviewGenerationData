How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "Auger spectroscopy experiments were also performed and indicated that the Ni/Pt mixing at higher temperatures (600900 K) occurs on the order of seconds to minutes."
[2] "At low temperatures, the Ni monolayer remains on the surface, and metastable Ni clusters form on the Pt(111) surface due to the smaller lattice constant of Ni compared to that of Pt."
[3] "It was also shown that the rate of mixing increases rapidly with temperature, resulting in the formation and reconstruction of active sites for the underlying elementary reactions."
[4] "Simulations indicate that higher temperatures, smaller Ni coverages and the presence of Pt steps (in this case there is inlayer mixing) facilitate mixing between Ni and Pt."
[5] "Accelerated MD gave insights on the behavior of the system at longer time scales (on the order of milliseconds), whereas the infinite time behavior was investigated through simulated annealing."
[6] "Both simulation methodologies showed that the system reaches a well-mixed state, thereby forming a Ni/Pt solid solution."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES can verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms like Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques measure the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which can then be compared to DFT predictions. The simulations show that the rate of mixing increases rapidly with temperature, facilitating the formation of a Ni/Pt solid solution. This matches the findings from experimental techniques, indicating the validity of the DFT predictions.

实验技术如HREELS和AES可以验证并量化氧诱导表面分层，特别是在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，子表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。这些技术测量了分层的速率和激活壁垒，然后与第一原理计算预测进行比较。模拟显示，随着温度的升高，混合速率迅速增加，从而形成Ni/Pt固溶体。这与实验技术的发现相吻合，表明第一原理预测的有效性。
