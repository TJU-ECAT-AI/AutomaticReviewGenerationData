[7] "The improvement in catalytic properties (activity, selectivity and stability) of bimetallic catalyst with regards to the monometallic can be also explained in this case by the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."

1. The catalysts were characterized using TPR, room temperature CO adsorption microcalorimetry, and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after reduction at 773 K.

2. The presence of Pt(II) species was indicated in the fresh catalysts, showing that Pt(IV) in the H2PtCl6 precursor was reduced upon impregnation on the carbon support.

3. Reduction of platinum to the metallic state occurred at 773 K, as indicated by the most intense band at 71.4 eV in the spectra.

4. The monolayer capacity of CO adsorption decreased with the addition of zinc.

5. At lower coverages, the differential heat of CO adsorption was significantly lower for the bimetallic catalyst compared to the monometallic one.

6. The bimetallic catalyst initially showed a selectivity of around 10% towards crotyl alcohol, which increased to 25% after 30 minutes due to the expense of butanal.

7. The improved catalytic properties of the bimetallic catalyst, including activity, selectivity, and stability, were attributed to the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles.

1. 催化剂通过温度程序还原（TPR）、室温CO吸附微热流和在773 K就地还原后的X射线光电子能谱进行了表征。

2. 在新鲜催化剂中发现了Pt(II)物种的存在，这表明H2PtCl6前体中的Pt(IV)在碳支持物上的浸渍和干燥过程中被还原。

3. 在773 K时，铂金属状态的还原发生在71.4 eV的最强烈峰处。

4. 锌的添加降低了CO吸附的单层容量。

5. 在较低覆盖率下，对于双金属样品的CO吸附的初始热差显著低于纯金属铂催化剂。

6. 在最初的反应阶段后，双金属催化剂对2-丁醇的最初选择性约为10%，但通过牺牲丁醇，在30分钟后增加到25%。

7. 双金属催化剂的改进催化性质，包括活性、选择性和稳定性，归因于PtZn双金属颗粒的形成。
