Experimental techniques such as High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic system. HREELS helped detect the presence of these atoms, providing insights into their segregation behavior. AES was used for quantitative analysis of the surface composition, confirming the segregation of the 3d atoms. Kinetics of the segregation process were studied to reveal activation barriers associated with the diffusion of Ni and Co atoms across the Pt surface. Comparisons were made between experimental findings and Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions to validate the theoretical models.

实验技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和俄歇电子能谱（AES），被用来验证并量化氧诱导的表面扩散在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的行为。HREELS帮助检测了这些原子的存在，并提供了它们扩散行为的见解。AES用于对表面组成进行定量分析，确认了3d原子的扩散。扩散过程的动力学被研究，揭示了Ni和Co原子在Pt表面扩散的相关活化壁垒。实验结果与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测进行了比较，以验证理论模型。
