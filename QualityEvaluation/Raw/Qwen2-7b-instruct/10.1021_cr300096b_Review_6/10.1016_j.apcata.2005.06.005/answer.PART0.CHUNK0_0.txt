The platinum content in the catalysts was 0.22 wt.% for the monometallic and 0.20 wt.% for the bimetallic, respectively. For this latter, the zinc content was 0.92 wt.% and, consequently, the bulk Zn/Pt atomic ratio was 13.7.
The amount of hydrogen consumed in the TPR experiments is much higher for the Zn-containing catalyst ( Fig. 1 ).
A sharp reduction peak centred at 546 K is obtained in the TPR of sample PtZn/C.
After reduction at 773 K, the most intense band appears at 71.4 eV in all cases, thus indicating the reduction of platinum to the metallic state.
The addition of zinc decreases the monolayer capacity of CO on the catalyst, as indicated above.
The initial activity is nearly two-fold for the bimetallic sample, although the deactivation is stronger and the steady-state activity remains in only 160 μmol s1 g Pt1.
These values are similar to those reported in the literature by Vannice and Sen [40] for monometallic platinum catalysts with different supports (1334 kJ mol1), although the highest activation energy corresponded to the catalysts which were more selective towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond.

The presence of zinc in the bimetallic catalyst leads to a higher initial activity in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde compared to the monometallic catalyst. However, this higher initial activity is accompanied by a stronger deactivation over time. Zinc also improves the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, leading to the formation of crotyl alcohol. Despite the higher initial activity, the steady-state activity of the bimetallic catalyst is lower than that of the monometallic catalyst. The activation energy for the hydrogenation process is lower in the bimetallic catalyst, which suggests better thermodynamic favorability. The selectivity towards crotyl alcohol increases with time, indicating a positive effect of zinc on the reaction mechanism. Zinc also affects the CO adsorption capacity and the selectivity towards iso-butane dehydrogenation, improving the selectivity to iso-butene while maintaining high stability.

锌在双金属催化剂中的存在导致在丙酮醛氢化过程中的更高初始活性与单金属催化剂相比。然而，这种更高的初始活性伴随着更强的时间内活性下降。锌也提高了羰基键氢化的选择性，导致生成丙烯醇。尽管有更高的初始活性，双金属催化剂的稳态活性低于单金属催化剂。双金属催化剂的活化能较低，这表明更好的热力学优势。随着时间的推移，选择性向丙烯醇增加，表明锌对反应机制的积极影响。锌还影响CO吸附能力和异丁烷脱氢作用的选择性，提高异丁烯的选择性同时保持高稳定性。
