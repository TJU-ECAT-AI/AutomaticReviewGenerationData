[1] "The catalysts have been characterised by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption microcalorimetry of CO at room temperature and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after in situ reduction at 773 K."
[2] "The amount of hydrogen consumed in the TPR experiments is much higher for the Zn-containing catalyst ( Fig. 1 )."
[3] "In the case of the fresh catalysts, a band appears between the platinum doublet. It is assigned to Al3+ in alumina, which seems to contaminate the fresh samples in some extent."
[4] "After reduction at 773 K, the most intense band appears at 71.4 eV in all cases, thus indicating the reduction of platinum to the metallic state."
[5] "Although the TPR experiment showed the reduction of Zn(II) species at a temperature lower than 773 K, no clear evidences of the presence of metallic Zn could be found in the AES results."
[6] "For the monometallic Pt/C catalyst, the initial activity is about 420 μmol s1 g Pt1 and, after a relatively small deactivation, reaches a steady-state activity of about 300 μmol s1 g Pt1."
[7] "In the case of the bimetallic catalyst, in the first stages of the reaction after the carbon balance has been achieved, selectivity towards crotyl alcohol is about 10%, but it increases with time on stream to achieve 25% after 30 min at the expense of butanal."
[8] "The improvement in catalytic properties (activity, selectivity and stability) of bimetallic catalyst with regards to the monometallic can be also explained in this case by the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."

The experimental techniques such as temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption microcalorimetry of CO at room temperature, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the catalysts. These methods helped in understanding the reduction process of platinum species and the presence of zinc in the bimetallic catalyst. XPS revealed the presence of aluminum contamination in the fresh samples, while TPR showed the reduction of zinc species at a lower temperature than 773 K. The initial activity of the monometallic Pt/C catalyst was higher compared to the bimetallic catalyst, and the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol improved with time in the bimetallic catalyst. The improvement in catalytic properties was attributed to the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles.

实验技术，如温度程序还原（TPR）、室温下CO吸附微热流法和X射线光电子能谱（XPS），用于催化剂的表征。这些方法有助于理解铂物种的还原过程和锌在双金属催化剂中的存在。XPS显示新鲜样品中铝的污染，而TPR表明锌物种在低于773 K的温度下被还原。与单金属Pt/C催化剂相比，双金属催化剂的初始活性较高，但随时间增加，双金属催化剂中丙烯醇的选择性提高。催化性能的改善归因于PtZn双金属颗粒的形成。
