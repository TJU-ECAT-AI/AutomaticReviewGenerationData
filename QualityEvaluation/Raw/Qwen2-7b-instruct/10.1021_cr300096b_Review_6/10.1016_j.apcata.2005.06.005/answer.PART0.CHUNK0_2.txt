[1] "The platinum content in the catalysts was 0.22 wt.% for the monometallic and 0.20 wt.% for the bimetallic, respectively."
[2] "There is another maximum in hydrogen consumption at higher temperatures (about 900 K), which is due to the gasification of the support to form methane, a reaction which is catalysed by the supported platinum."
[3] "The amount of hydrogen consumed in the TPR experiments is much higher for the Zn-containing catalyst ( Fig. 1 )."
[4] "In this range, platinum signal is characterized by a doublet corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 levels, this latter appearing at a higher binding energy than the former."
[5] "The addition of zinc decreases the monolayer capacity of CO on the catalyst, as indicated above."
[6] "Further deactivation seems to be related to the higher initial activity, as it has been shown that it is mainly due to poisoning by CO produced by decarbonylation reactions."
[7] "The initial data were taken after 10 min on stream, when the carbon balance was achieved."
[8] "The initial activity is nearly two-fold for the bimetallic sample, although the deactivation is stronger and the steady-state activity remains in only 160 μmol s−1 g Pt−1."
[9] "In the case of the bimetallic catalyst, in the first stages of the reaction after the carbon balance has been achieved, selectivity towards crotyl alcohol is about 10%, but it increases with time on stream to achieve 25% after 30 min."
[10] "Monometallic catalyst showed higher initial activity than its bimetallic counterpart (initial conversion: 29.9% for Pt/C and 21.8% for PtZn/C)."

1. The monometallic catalyst had a platinum content of 0.22 wt.%, while the bimetallic catalyst had a platinum content of 0.20 wt.%.
2. The higher hydrogen consumption at 900 K is attributed to the gasification of the carbon support, catalyzed by the supported platinum.
3. The Zn-containing catalyst showed a higher hydrogen consumption compared to the monometallic catalyst.
4. The Pt 4f signals for the fresh catalysts show a doublet with the Pt 4f5/2 level appearing at a higher binding energy.
5. The addition of zinc led to a decrease in the monolayer capacity of CO on the catalyst.
6. The higher initial activity is associated with poisoning by CO produced from decarbonylation reactions.
7. The carbon balance was achieved after 10 minutes of operation.
8. The bimetallic catalyst exhibited a two-fold higher initial activity, but experienced stronger deactivation leading to a steady-state activity of 160 μmol s−1 g Pt−1.
9. The bimetallic catalyst showed a selectivity of about 10% towards crotyl alcohol initially, which increased to 25% after 30 minutes.
10. The monometallic catalyst had a higher initial activity with conversions of 29.9% for Pt/C and 21.8% for PtZn/C.

1. 单金属催化剂的铂含量为0.22 wt.%，而双金属催化剂的铂含量为0.20 wt.%。
2. 在900 K时较高的氢消耗归因于碳支持的气化，由支持的铂催化。
3. 含锌催化剂的氢消耗量高于单金属催化剂。
4. 新鲜催化剂的Pt 4f信号显示一个双峰，Pt 4f5/2水平的出现比前者更高。
5. 锌的添加导致催化剂上CO的单层容量降低。
6. 较高的初始活性与由脱羰基反应产生的CO中毒有关。
7. 碳平衡在运行10分钟后实现。
8. 双金属催化剂的初始活性是其两倍，但经历了更强的失活，导致稳态活性为160 μmol s−1 g Pt−1。
9. 双金属催化剂在最初的阶段对丙烯醇的选择性约为10%，但在30分钟后增加到25%。
10. 单金属催化剂具有更高的初始活性，转化率分别为Pt/C的29.9%和PtZn/C的21.8%。
