How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

The platinum content in the catalysts was 0.22 wt.% for the monometallic and 0.20 wt.% for the bimetallic, respectively. For this latter, the zinc content was 0.92 wt.% and, consequently, the bulk Zn/Pt atomic ratio was 13.7.
The amount of hydrogen consumed in the TPR experiments is much higher for the Zn-containing catalyst ( Fig. 1 ).
A sharp reduction peak centred at 546 K is obtained in the TPR of sample PtZn/C.
After reduction at 773 K, the most intense band appears at 71.4 eV in all cases, thus indicating the reduction of platinum to the metallic state.
The addition of zinc decreases the monolayer capacity of CO on the catalyst, as indicated above.
The initial activity is nearly two-fold for the bimetallic sample, although the deactivation is stronger and the steady-state activity remains in only 160 μmol s1 g Pt1.
These values are similar to those reported in the literature by Vannice and Sen [40] for monometallic platinum catalysts with different supports (1334 kJ mol1), although the highest activation energy corresponded to the catalysts which were more selective towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond.

The presence of zinc in the bimetallic catalyst leads to a higher initial activity in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde compared to the monometallic catalyst. However, this higher initial activity is accompanied by a stronger deactivation over time. Zinc also improves the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, leading to the formation of crotyl alcohol. Despite the higher initial activity, the steady-state activity of the bimetallic catalyst is lower than that of the monometallic catalyst. The activation energy for the hydrogenation process is lower in the bimetallic catalyst, which suggests better thermodynamic favorability. The selectivity towards crotyl alcohol increases with time, indicating a positive effect of zinc on the reaction mechanism. Zinc also affects the CO adsorption capacity and the selectivity towards iso-butane dehydrogenation, improving the selectivity to iso-butene while maintaining high stability.

锌在双金属催化剂中的存在导致在丙酮醛氢化过程中的更高初始活性与单金属催化剂相比。然而，这种更高的初始活性伴随着更强的时间内活性下降。锌也提高了羰基键氢化的选择性，导致生成丙烯醇。尽管有更高的初始活性，双金属催化剂的稳态活性低于单金属催化剂。双金属催化剂的活化能较低，这表明更好的热力学优势。随着时间的推移，选择性向丙烯醇增加，表明锌对反应机制的积极影响。锌还影响CO吸附能力和异丁烷脱氢作用的选择性，提高异丁烯的选择性同时保持高稳定性。

[1] "The catalysts have been characterised by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption microcalorimetry of CO at room temperature and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after in situ reduction at 773 K."
[2] "The amount of hydrogen consumed in the TPR experiments is much higher for the Zn-containing catalyst ( Fig. 1 )."
[3] "In the case of the fresh catalysts, a band appears between the platinum doublet. It is assigned to Al3+ in alumina, which seems to contaminate the fresh samples in some extent."
[4] "After reduction at 773 K, the most intense band appears at 71.4 eV in all cases, thus indicating the reduction of platinum to the metallic state."
[5] "Although the TPR experiment showed the reduction of Zn(II) species at a temperature lower than 773 K, no clear evidences of the presence of metallic Zn could be found in the AES results."
[6] "For the monometallic Pt/C catalyst, the initial activity is about 420 μmol s1 g Pt1 and, after a relatively small deactivation, reaches a steady-state activity of about 300 μmol s1 g Pt1."
[7] "In the case of the bimetallic catalyst, in the first stages of the reaction after the carbon balance has been achieved, selectivity towards crotyl alcohol is about 10%, but it increases with time on stream to achieve 25% after 30 min at the expense of butanal."
[8] "The improvement in catalytic properties (activity, selectivity and stability) of bimetallic catalyst with regards to the monometallic can be also explained in this case by the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."

The experimental techniques such as temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption microcalorimetry of CO at room temperature, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the catalysts. These methods helped in understanding the reduction process of platinum species and the presence of zinc in the bimetallic catalyst. XPS revealed the presence of aluminum contamination in the fresh samples, while TPR showed the reduction of zinc species at a lower temperature than 773 K. The initial activity of the monometallic Pt/C catalyst was higher compared to the bimetallic catalyst, and the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol improved with time in the bimetallic catalyst. The improvement in catalytic properties was attributed to the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles.

实验技术，如温度程序还原（TPR）、室温下CO吸附微热流法和X射线光电子能谱（XPS），用于催化剂的表征。这些方法有助于理解铂物种的还原过程和锌在双金属催化剂中的存在。XPS显示新鲜样品中铝的污染，而TPR表明锌物种在低于773 K的温度下被还原。与单金属Pt/C催化剂相比，双金属催化剂的初始活性较高，但随时间增加，双金属催化剂中丙烯醇的选择性提高。催化性能的改善归因于PtZn双金属颗粒的形成。

[2] "There is another maximum in hydrogen consumption at higher temperatures (about 900 K), which is due to the gasification of the support to form methane, a reaction which is catalysed by the supported platinum."
