Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES measurements allow for the detection of oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface atoms by monitoring the changes in the AES spectra as a function of annealing temperature. The oxygen segregation kinetics and activation barriers can be determined from the temperature dependence of the AES signals. Meanwhile, HREELS provides information about the vibrational modes of adsorbed species, which can be related to the surface chemistry and the nature of the bonding. By comparing the experimental HREELS spectra with theoretical predictions, the extent of segregation and the bonding characteristics can be quantified. The results from these experiments are then compared with DFT predictions to assess the accuracy of the theoretical models in describing the surface chemistry of these bimetallic systems.

Answer: The experimental techniques of AES and HREELS are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.
