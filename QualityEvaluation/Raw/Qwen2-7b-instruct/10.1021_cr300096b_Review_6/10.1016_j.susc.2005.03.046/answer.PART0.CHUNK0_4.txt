2.1. Techniques
The ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the W(1 1 0) and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) surfaces has been described in detail previously [17] . Briefly, it is a three-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 3 × 1010 Torr) which is equipped with AES and TPD in the top two levels and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) in the bottom level.
2.2. Preparation of clean and modified W(1 1 0) and Mo(1 1 0) surfaces
The preparation of the clean W(1 1 0) surface has been described in detail previously [18] . Briefly, the W(1 1 0) crystal was cleaned using multiple cycles of Ne+ sputtering while held at 600 K, followed by annealing to 1200 K.
2.3. DFT modeling
3.1. Details of DFT modeling
DFT was employed to study the adsorption of hydrogen and ethylene on the bimetallic surfaces. Self-consistent periodic slab calculations were carried out based on gradient corrected DFT to produce all the theoretical results discussed in this paper.
3.2. Hydrogen binding energy on Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0)
The gas-phase energy for a hydrogen atom calculated using DFT (spin polarized) was found to be 13.68 eV. For the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on surfaces, hydrogen was adsorbed at the 3-fold binding site of the metal surface at a coverage of 0.25 ML.
3.3. Ethylene binding energy on Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0)
Periodic DFT calculations were also used to study the adsorption of ethylene on various metal substrates. The spin polarized gas phase energy for an ethylene molecule was calculated to be 374.54 eV.

Experimental techniques such as AES and HREELS are used to quantify and verify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES measurements can detect the changes in the surface composition and the AES spectra can provide information on the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. The HREELS spectra can be used to identify the different chemical states of the segregated atoms and to monitor the reactions that occur on the surface. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare well with the predictions from DFT calculations, providing evidence for the accuracy of the theoretical models used to describe the bimetallic systems.
