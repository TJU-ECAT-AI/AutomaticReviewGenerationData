[1] "The focus of the current paper is to investigate other monolayer metal films to determine if they display similar chemical properties as in the Ni/Pt bimetallic system."
[2] "In particular, the current study utilizes density functional theory (DFT), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to investigate reactions of hydrogen and ethylene on W(1 1 0), Pt-modified W(1 1 0), Mo(1 1 0), and Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) surface."
[3] "We will first report the DFT results for hydrogen and ethylene binding energies on the clean and modified Mo(1 1 0) and W(1 1 0) surfaces."
[4] "Next we report TPD results for hydrogen and ethylene on clean and modified W(1 1 0) and Mo(1 1 0) surfaces."
[5] "Finally, we present HREELS results for C2H4 and C2D4 on clean and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) surfaces."
[6] "These results illustrate the correlation between DFT modeling and experimental results for various bimetallic surfaces."

Experimental techniques such as DFT, TPD, and HREELS are used to investigate the chemical properties of monolayer metal films. DFT is employed to calculate the binding energies of hydrogen and ethylene on the surfaces. TPD experiments measure the desorption temperatures of hydrogen and ethylene, providing insight into the degree of decomposition. HREELS spectra monitor the thermal decomposition of ethylene and provide vibrational assignments to identify the bonding configurations. These experimental results correlate with the predictions made by DFT calculations, illustrating the effectiveness of combining theoretical models with surface science experiments in understanding the chemical behavior of bimetallic surfaces.
