[1] "In the current paper we report theoretical and experimental studies of the adsorption and decomposition of hydrogen and ethylene on several bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "The focus of the current paper is to investigate other monolayer metal films to determine if they display similar chemical properties as in the Ni/Pt bimetallic system."
[3] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations and experimental studies to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces."
[4] "In particular, the current study utilizes density functional theory (DFT), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to investigate reactions of hydrogen and ethylene on W(1 1 0), Pt-modified W(1 1 0), Mo(1 1 0), and Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) surface."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The focus is on determining the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. These measurements are compared with DFT predictions for these systems.
