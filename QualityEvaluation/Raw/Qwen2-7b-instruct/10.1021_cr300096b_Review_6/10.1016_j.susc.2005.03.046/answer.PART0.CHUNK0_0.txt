[1] "The focus of the current paper is to investigate other monolayer metal films to determine if they display similar chemical properties as in the Ni/Pt bimetallic system."
[2] "In particular, the current study utilizes density functional theory (DFT), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to investigate reactions of hydrogen and ethylene on W(1 1 0), Pt-modified W(1 1 0), Mo(1 1 0), and Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) surface."
[3] "The ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the W(1 1 0) and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) surfaces has been described in detail previously."
[4] "The tungsten single crystal sample was a [1 1 0] oriented, 1.5 mm thick tungsten disk (99.999%), 8 mm in diameter."
[5] "The ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber used for the Mo(1 1 0) and Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) experiments is a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr) which is equipped with AES and TPD."
[6] "The DFT calculations predicted that Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0) bimetallic surfaces would bind hydrogen and ethylene more weakly than do the corresponding surfaces of the parent metals."
[7] "The adsorption and decomposition of hydrogen and ethylene on Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0) bimetallic systems were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to test the DFT predictions."

The study investigates monolayer metal films to ascertain if they exhibit similar chemical properties to the Ni/Pt bimetallic system. The researchers employ density functional theory (DFT), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to examine hydrogen and ethylene reactions on W(1 1 0), Pt-modified W(1 1 0), Mo(1 1 0), and Pd-modified Mo(1 1 0) surfaces. The tungsten sample is a [1 1 0] oriented, 1.5 mm thick tungsten disk. The ultrahigh-vacuum chamber for the W(1 1 0) and Pt-modified W(1 1 0) surfaces has been detailed previously. The DFT calculations forecast that Pd/Mo(1 1 0) and Pt/W(1 1 0) bimetallic surfaces would bind hydrogen and ethylene more weakly than their parent metals' surfaces. The researchers then test these predictions through TPD, AES, and HREELS analysis on the specified surfaces.

研究聚焦于其他单层金属薄膜，以确定它们是否展现出与Ni/Pt双金属系统类似的化学性质。研究人员利用密度泛函理论（DFT）、温度程序脱附（TPD）和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）来研究W(1 1 0)、Pt修饰W(1 1 0)、Mo(1 1 0)和Pd修饰Mo(1 1 0)表面的氢和乙烷反应。钨样本为[1 1 0]取向、厚度为1.5毫米的钨盘。用于W(1 1 0)和Pt修饰W(1 1 0)表面的超高真空室的细节在之前已被描述。DFT计算预测，Pd/Mo(1 1 0)和Pt/W(1 1 0)双金属表面将比其母金属表面更弱地吸附氢和乙烷。然后通过TPD、AES和HREELS分析对指定表面进行测试，验证这些预测。
