[1] "After normalizing with the CO uptake the activity trend is: PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 < PtNi/LSA-ZrO2  PtNi/γ-Al2O3  PtNi/α-Al2O3."
[2] "The TEM images in Fig. 1 and the chemisorption results in Table 1 indicate that the PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits slightly larger particles and a lower CO uptake than the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "From the TEM images in Fig. 1 , the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst exhibits a bimodal particle size distribution, with both small particles of 1 nm and larger ones between 8 and 15 nm."
[4] "The Pt loadings in the two catalysts are estimated using the height of the edge-jump in the near edge region of the Pt L-edge, which is related to the concentration of Pt in the catalyst samples [28]."
[5] "Although the amorphous to tetragonal phase transformation of the HSA-ZrO2 support ( Fig. 5 ), which is accompanied with a decrease in support surface area [25], may trap some of the metal nanoparticles within the ZrO2 pores, this is unlikely the reason for the lower (at least per site) activity on the HSA-ZrO2-supported catalyst."

1. The normalized hydrogenation activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst is significantly less than that of the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst.
2. The PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst shows slightly larger particles and a lower CO uptake compared to the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.
3. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst displays a bimodal particle size distribution, featuring both small particles of 1 nm and larger ones between 8 and 15 nm.
4. The Pt loadings in the two catalysts are estimated by measuring the height of the edge-jump in the near edge region of the Pt L-edge, which correlates with the concentration of Pt in the catalyst samples.
5. The amorphous to tetragonal phase transformation of the HSA-ZrO2 support might lead to a decrease in support surface area, but this is not the main reason for the lower activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst.

1.PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂的正常化氢化活性远低于PtNi/LSA-ZrO2催化剂。
2.PtNi/α-Al2O3催化剂显示出比PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂稍大的颗粒和较低的CO吸收量。
3.PtNi/LSA-ZrO2催化剂表现出双峰的颗粒尺寸分布，包含1nm的小颗粒以及8至15nm的大颗粒。
4.Pt负载在两个催化剂中的估计是通过测量Pt L边缘附近边缘跳跃的高度来完成的，这与催化剂样品中的Pt浓度相关。
5.HSA-ZrO2支持的非晶到四方相转变可能会导致支持面积的减少，但这不是PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂活性较低的主要原因。
