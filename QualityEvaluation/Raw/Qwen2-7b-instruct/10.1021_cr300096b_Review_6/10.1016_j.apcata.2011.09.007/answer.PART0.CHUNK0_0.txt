[1] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed using a JEOL 2010F equipped with a Schottky field emission gun operated at 200 keV, with an ultra-high resolution pole piece providing a point resolution of 1.9 Å."
[2] "The micrographs were collected in high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode in order to take advantage of the Z2 contrast provided by the mode."
[3] "The images shown in this study were collected using a 20 nm camera length and a 0.5 nm diameter nanoprobe."
[4] "Catalysts were prepared for imaging by grinding and suspending several mg of spent catalyst in several mL of ethanol."
[5] "A pipette was then used to collect sample from the top of this suspension; two drops of this solution were then dropped onto a carbon-coated copper grid and allowed to dry before loading the sample into the TEM."
[6] "The pulse CO chemisorption measurements were collected using an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments)."
[7] "The amount of CO leaving the quartz reactor after each pulse was measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
[8] "The catalyst pellets were loaded into an in-house designed XAS cell which allows for simultaneous collection of both transmission and fluorescence signals before, during, and after in situ reduction."
[9] "The catalysts were reduced by heating under a diluted hydrogen flow (5% H2/He, 40 sccm) to 723 K at a rate of 10 K/min."
[10] "The spectra of a Pt foil were simultaneously collected with each sample so that the edge energies of the catalyst samples could be properly calibrated."

Experimental techniques such as TEM, pulse CO chemisorption, XAS, FTIR, and HREELS were employed to characterize and analyze the structure and activity of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. TEM provided images of the catalyst particles with a resolution of 1.9 Å, using HAADF mode to visualize the contrast. XAS measurements were performed on Pt LIII-edge to detect the formation of Pt-3d-Pt bonds, with Pt foil spectra used for calibration. FTIR spectroscopy was used to monitor the reaction progress and identify the presence of reactants and products. HREELS likely refers to high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, which could be used to quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms such as Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers could be compared with DFT predictions to validate the theoretical models.

The kinetic constants, activation barriers, and the extent of surface segregation would depend on the specific experimental conditions and the nature of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic system. The activation barriers would indicate the energy required for the chemical reactions, while the kinetic constants would reflect the reaction rates. Comparisons with DFT predictions would involve computational simulations that consider the electronic structure, bonding, and energetics of the system, helping to understand the mechanisms of surface segregation and its impact on the catalytic performance.

However, the document does not explicitly describe how HREELS is used to quantify the surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. It only mentions the use of TEM, pulse CO chemisorption, XAS, FTIR, and HREELS for general characterization purposes. Without additional context or details on the specific experimental setup and results, it is not possible to provide a precise answer to this question based solely on the provided document.

实验技术如透射电子显微镜（TEM）、脉冲CO化学吸附、X射线吸收光谱（XAS）、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）被用来表征和分析Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的结构和活性。TEM提供了具有1.9 Å分辨率的催化剂颗粒图像，使用HAADF模式来可视化对比度。XAS测量在Pt LIII边进行，以检测形成Pt-3d-Pt键，用Pt箔光谱进行校准。FTIR光谱用于监控反应进程并识别反应物和产物的存在。HREELS可能指的是高分辨率电子能量损失光谱，它可以用来量化氧诱导的Ni和Co等3d原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分离。通过比较实验结果与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测，可以验证理论模型。

激活势垒的大小将取决于特定的实验条件和Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的性质。激活势垒将反映化学反应所需的能量，而动力学常数将反映反应速率。与DFT预测的比较涉及考虑体系的电子结构、键合和能垒的计算模拟，这有助于理解表面分离机制及其对催化性能的影响。

然而，文档没有明确描述如何使用HREELS量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中Ni和Co的表面分离。它仅提到使用TEM、脉冲CO化学吸附、XAS、FTIR和HREELS进行一般表征。没有额外的上下文或详细的结果描述，仅基于提供的文档，无法根据问题提供精确答案。
