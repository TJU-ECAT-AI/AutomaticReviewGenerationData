[1] "The two alumina-supported catalysts show similar hydrogenation activity, based on catalyst mass and after normalizing with the number of actives sites."
[2] "The TEM images in Fig. 1 and the chemisorption results in Table 1 indicate that the PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits slightly larger particles and a lower CO uptake than the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The EXAFS results in Table 2 show that the PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a greater absolute extent of bimetallic bond formation than the PtNi/γ-Al2O3."
[4] "The two zirconia-supported catalysts, on the other hand, show significant differences between the low and high surface area supports."
[5] "The Pt loadings in the two catalysts are estimated using the height of the edge-jump in the near edge region of the Pt L-edge, which is related to the concentration of Pt in the catalyst samples."
[6] "From the TEM images in Fig. 1 , the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst exhibits a bimodal particle size distribution, with both small particles of 1 nm and larger ones between 8 and 15 nm."
[7] "In comparison, the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst displays a narrow particle size distribution on the order of 1 nm."
[8] "The pulse CO chemisorption results in Table 1 show that the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a lower CO uptake than PtNi/HSA-ZO2, which can be attributed to the larger particles present in the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst."
[9] "The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst shows a greater hydrogenation activity than PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 based on both per catalyst mass (a factor of 10) and per active site (a factor of 20)."
[10] "The significant difference in normalized hydrogenation activity between the two zirconia-supported catalysts suggests that the presence of the SMSI effects, which have been identified for some reducible oxide supports, may play a role in the low activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst."
[11] "Another possible explanation for the low hydrogenation activity of PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 is related to the difference in the PtNi bond length, which is about 0.05 Å shorter than that of the other three bimetallic catalysts (Table 2)."
[12] "The low PtPt coordination number of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst may indicate that there is no Pt core in nanoparticles and thus, the bimetallic character in the two catalysts may be different, leading to active site or sites of different activity."
