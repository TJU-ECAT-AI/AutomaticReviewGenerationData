Experimental techniques such as TEM, pulse CO chemisorption, XAS, FTIR, and HREELS were employed to characterize and analyze the structure and activity of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. TEM provided images of the catalyst particles with a resolution of 1.9 Å, using HAADF mode to visualize the contrast. XAS measurements were performed on Pt LIII-edge to detect the formation of Pt-3d-Pt bonds, with Pt foil spectra used for calibration. FTIR spectroscopy was used to monitor the reaction progress and identify the presence of reactants and products. HREELS likely refers to high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, which could be used to quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms such as Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers could be compared with DFT predictions to validate the theoretical models.

The kinetic constants, activation barriers, and the extent of surface segregation would depend on the specific experimental conditions and the nature of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic system. The activation barriers would indicate the energy required for the chemical reactions, while the kinetic constants would reflect the reaction rates. Comparisons with DFT predictions would involve computational simulations that consider the electronic structure, bonding, and energetics of the system, helping to understand the mechanisms of surface segregation and its impact on the catalytic performance.

However, the document does not explicitly describe how HREELS is used to quantify the surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. It only mentions the use of TEM, pulse CO chemisorption, XAS, FTIR, and HREELS for general characterization purposes. Without additional context or details on the specific experimental setup and results, it is not possible to provide a precise answer to this question based solely on the provided document.

实验技术如透射电子显微镜（TEM）、脉冲CO化学吸附、X射线吸收光谱（XAS）、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）被用来表征和分析Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的结构和活性。TEM提供了具有1.9 Å分辨率的催化剂颗粒图像，使用HAADF模式来可视化对比度。XAS测量在Pt LIII边进行，以检测形成Pt-3d-Pt键，用Pt箔光谱进行校准。FTIR光谱用于监控反应进程并识别反应物和产物的存在。HREELS可能指的是高分辨率电子能量损失光谱，它可以用来量化氧诱导的Ni和Co等3d原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中的表面分离。通过比较实验结果与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测，可以验证理论模型。

激活势垒的大小将取决于特定的实验条件和Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的性质。激活势垒将反映化学反应所需的能量，而动力学常数将反映反应速率。与DFT预测的比较涉及考虑体系的电子结构、键合和能垒的计算模拟，这有助于理解表面分离机制及其对催化性能的影响。

然而，文档没有明确描述如何使用HREELS量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中Ni和Co的表面分离。它仅提到使用TEM、脉冲CO化学吸附、XAS、FTIR和HREELS进行一般表征。没有额外的上下文或详细的结果描述，仅基于提供的文档，无法根据问题提供精确答案。

[1] "The Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on the two low surface area supports show larger metal nanoparticles; however, these catalysts also display greater extent of bimetallic bond formation, as characterized by the Pt LIII-edge EXAFS."
[2] "In contrast, normalizing the hydrogenation rate constants for the two zirconia catalysts reveals that the catalyst supported on the high surface area zirconia is approximately twenty times less active, suggesting a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the metal nanoparticles and the high surface area zirconia support."

1. The study investigates the impact of oxide support and support surface area on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on zirconia with low and high surface areas. The characterization results suggest that the bimetallic catalyst nanoparticles exhibit a structure with Pt residing on the top-most surface, resembling the Pt-terminated model surface in surface science studies. In the presence of adsorbed atomic hydrogen, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface is thermodynamically stable, whereas in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, Ni segregates to the surface to form the NiPtPt(1 1 1) structure. The thermodynamic stability of these Pt/Ni surface configurations is of interest, as both computational and experimental studies have shown that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates. The activation barrier for the transition between the Pt- and Ni-terminated configurations is relatively low, 15 kcal/mol, indicating that the transformation can occur at temperatures relevant to calcination, reduction, or reaction during synthesis and testing of supported catalysts. The goal of the current work is to explore the effects of oxide support and support surface area on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on zirconia with low and high surface areas. The hydrogenation activity of supported Pt/Ni catalysts correlates well with the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation obtained from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. The rate constants of the corresponding monometallic catalysts are also provided for comparison. Overall, the study finds that the surface area of alumina does not significantly influence the catalytic activity of the Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts.

1. 本研究旨在探讨氧化物支持和支撑面积对铂/镍双金属催化剂在低表面和高表面锆氧上活性的影响。表征结果表明，双金属催化剂纳米颗粒的结构中，铂位于最顶部表面，与表面科学研究中识别的铂终止模型表面相似。在吸附原子氢的存在下，铂镍铂（1 1 1）表面是热力学稳定的，而在吸附氧的存在下，镍迁移到表面形成镍铂铂（1 1 1）结构。这些铂/镍表面配置的热力学稳定性是值得注意的，因为计算和实验研究表明，镍单层可以在吸附剂的存在下迁移。转换从铂-和镍-终止配置的活化壁垒相对较低，为15千卡/摩尔，暗示该转换可以在合成和测试支持催化剂时的相关温度下发生。当前工作的目标是探索氧化物支持和支撑面积对铂/镍双金属催化剂在低表面和高表面锆氧上的活性的影响。支持铂/镍催化剂的氢化活性与从扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）测量获得的铂镍双金属键形成程度成正比。对于比较，提供了相应的单金属催化剂的速率常数。总的来说，研究发现氧化铝的表面面积对铂/镍双金属催化剂的活性影响不大。
