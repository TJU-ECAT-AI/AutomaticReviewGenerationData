[1] "The Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on the two low surface area supports show larger metal nanoparticles; however, these catalysts also display greater extent of bimetallic bond formation, as characterized by the Pt LIII-edge EXAFS."
[2] "In contrast, normalizing the hydrogenation rate constants for the two zirconia catalysts reveals that the catalyst supported on the high surface area zirconia is approximately twenty times less active, suggesting a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the metal nanoparticles and the high surface area zirconia support."
[3] "It is postulated that this lower activity is due to a strong metal-support interaction between the HSA-ZrO2 and the bimetallic catalysts leading to particles with no Pt core."

1. The Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on the two low surface area supports exhibit larger metal nanoparticles and greater bimetallic bond formation, as indicated by the Pt LIII-edge EXAFS analysis. 
2. The PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst displays significantly lower hydrogenation activity compared to the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst, with the former being approximately twenty times less active per active site. This is attributed to a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the metal nanoparticles and the high surface area zirconia support.
3. The lower activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst is hypothesized to be caused by a strong metal-support interaction leading to the formation of particles without a Pt core.

1. 支撑在两个低表面面积氧化物上的铂/镍双金属催化剂表现出较大的金属纳米颗粒和更广泛的双金属键形成，这通过Pt LIII-边EXAFS分析得到验证。
2. PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂的氢化活性与PtNi/LSA-ZrO2催化剂相比显著降低，前者每活性位点的活性大约是后者的二十倍。这种现象归因于高表面面积氧化锆支持下金属纳米颗粒与该支持之间的强金属-支撑相互作用（SMSI）。
3. PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂活性较低的假设是由于强金属-支撑相互作用导致形成没有铂核心的颗粒。
