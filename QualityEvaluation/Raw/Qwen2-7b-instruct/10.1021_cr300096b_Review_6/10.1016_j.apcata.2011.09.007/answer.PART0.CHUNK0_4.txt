1. The study investigates the impact of oxide support and support surface area on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on zirconia with low and high surface areas. The characterization results suggest that the bimetallic catalyst nanoparticles exhibit a structure with Pt residing on the top-most surface, resembling the Pt-terminated model surface in surface science studies. In the presence of adsorbed atomic hydrogen, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface is thermodynamically stable, whereas in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, Ni segregates to the surface to form the NiPtPt(1 1 1) structure. The thermodynamic stability of these Pt/Ni surface configurations is of interest, as both computational and experimental studies have shown that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates. The activation barrier for the transition between the Pt- and Ni-terminated configurations is relatively low, 15 kcal/mol, indicating that the transformation can occur at temperatures relevant to calcination, reduction, or reaction during synthesis and testing of supported catalysts. The goal of the current work is to explore the effects of oxide support and support surface area on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on zirconia with low and high surface areas. The hydrogenation activity of supported Pt/Ni catalysts correlates well with the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation obtained from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. The rate constants of the corresponding monometallic catalysts are also provided for comparison. Overall, the study finds that the surface area of alumina does not significantly influence the catalytic activity of the Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts.

1. 本研究旨在探讨氧化物支持和支撑面积对铂/镍双金属催化剂在低表面和高表面锆氧上活性的影响。表征结果表明，双金属催化剂纳米颗粒的结构中，铂位于最顶部表面，与表面科学研究中识别的铂终止模型表面相似。在吸附原子氢的存在下，铂镍铂（1 1 1）表面是热力学稳定的，而在吸附氧的存在下，镍迁移到表面形成镍铂铂（1 1 1）结构。这些铂/镍表面配置的热力学稳定性是值得注意的，因为计算和实验研究表明，镍单层可以在吸附剂的存在下迁移。转换从铂-和镍-终止配置的活化壁垒相对较低，为15千卡/摩尔，暗示该转换可以在合成和测试支持催化剂时的相关温度下发生。当前工作的目标是探索氧化物支持和支撑面积对铂/镍双金属催化剂在低表面和高表面锆氧上的活性的影响。支持铂/镍催化剂的氢化活性与从扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）测量获得的铂镍双金属键形成程度成正比。对于比较，提供了相应的单金属催化剂的速率常数。总的来说，研究发现氧化铝的表面面积对铂/镍双金属催化剂的活性影响不大。
