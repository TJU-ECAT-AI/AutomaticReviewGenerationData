<p>As shown in both flow reactor (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) and batch reactor (Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Table 3) results, although both PtCo and PtNi catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activities than the parent metals, the two types of bimetallic catalysts demonstrate quite different catalytic performance between cyclohexene and benzene hydrogenation reactions. For cyclohexene hydrogenation, PtNi bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activity than PtCo.</p>
<p>While the trend in the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene, PtNi &gt; PtCo &gt; Pt, is consistent with previous surface science experiments and DFT modeling on the corresponding single crystal surfaces, the significantly higher hydrogenation activity of benzene over the PtCo catalysts suggests unique hydrogenation properties. For benzene hydrogenation, the PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher activity than PtNi, as illustrated in the rate constants from batch reactor studies and the apparent activation energies from flow reactor studies.</p>

1. The PtNi bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activity than the PtCo catalysts for cyclohexene hydrogenation, as indicated in both flow reactor and batch reactor studies. 
2. For benzene hydrogenation, the PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit significantly higher activity than the PtNi bimetallic catalysts, supported by batch reactor studies and flow reactor studies showing higher conversion rates and lower apparent activation energies for the PtCo catalysts.

1. 对于环己烯氢化，PtNi双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于PtCo催化剂。
2. 对于苯氢化，PtCo双金属催化剂的活性明显高于PtNi双金属催化剂，支持批处理反应研究和流体反应器研究显示PtCo催化剂更高的转化率和更低的表观活化能。
