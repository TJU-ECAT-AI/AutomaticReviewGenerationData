Experimental techniques such as TPR and AES have been used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts promotes the reduction of cobalt oxides through hydrogen spillover, allowing Pt to be reduced at lower temperatures than Co. This leads to the migration of hydrogen from the surface of Pt to the surface of Co3O4 and support, facilitating the reduction of Co at lower temperatures in the bimetallic catalysts. The effect of adding Pt to the PtNi bimetallic catalysts is less effective compared to the PtCo bimetallic catalysts. The distances between Pt atoms in the PtCo and PtNi catalysts are determined to be and respectively, which are between the bulk 3d3d and PtPt distances, indicating the presence of bimetallic bonds. The coordination numbers for Pt atoms in the PtCo and PtNi catalysts are and respectively, showing that most Pt atoms are primarily coordinated with 3d atoms. The PtNi catalyst has more metallic active sites than the PtCo catalyst. The conversion of benzene over the 1.2%Pt30%Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst increased to 50%, demonstrating the higher activity of PtCo bimetallic catalysts in benzene hydrogenation compared to Co, Ni, Pt monometallic and PtNi bimetallic catalysts.

实验技术如TPR和AES被用来验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导表面掺杂的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的存在。在PtCo催化剂中，Pt的存在通过氢扩散促进钴氧化物的还原，允许Pt在比Co更低的温度下被还原。这导致氢从Pt表面迁移到Co3O4和支撑表面，从而使得Co在双金属催化剂中在较低温度下被还原。添加到PtNi双金属催化剂中的Pt的效果与添加到PtCo双金属催化剂中的效果相比更为有限。在PtCo和PtNi催化剂中，Pt原子之间的距离分别为和，它们位于bulk 3d3d和PtPt距离之间，表明存在双金属键。PtCo和PtNi催化剂中的Pt原子的配位数分别为和，表明大多数Pt原子主要与3d原子配位。PtNi催化剂具有比PtCo催化剂更多的金属活性位点。1.2%Pt30%Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂上苯的转化率增加至50%，这证明了PtCo双金属催化剂在苯氢化反应中的高活性，相比于Co、Ni、Pt单金属和PtNi双金属催化剂。
