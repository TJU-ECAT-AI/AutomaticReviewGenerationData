<p>As shown in both flow reactor (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) and batch reactor (Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Table 3) results, although both PtCo and PtNi catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activities than the parent metals, the two types of bimetallic catalysts demonstrate quite different catalytic performance between cyclohexene and benzene hydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>For benzene hydrogenation, the PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher activity than PtNi, as illustrated in the rate constants from batch reactor studies and the apparent activation energies from flow reactor studies.</p>
<p>The presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of Co3O4 and leads to an increase in the number of metal sites. Because Pt is an efficient catalyst for hydrogen adsorption and dissociation, it could provide atomic hydrogen to the Co metal sites for hydrogenation through the spillover effect. A closer inspection of the results in Fig. 5 suggests that Co is an active hydrogenation catalyst. For example, the apparent activation barriers over the 10%Co/Al2O3 and 1.2%Pt10%Co/Al2O3 are essentially identical, at 33.7 and 33.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, the role of Pt appears to be to keep Co in its reduced state and may also provide sites for the dissociation of H2.</p>

The experimental results demonstrate that the PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher activity than the PtNi bimetallic catalysts for benzene hydrogenation. This is supported by the rate constants from batch reactor studies and the apparent activation energies from flow reactor studies. The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts facilitates the reduction of Co3O4, increasing the number of metal sites available for hydrogenation. Additionally, Pt acts as an efficient catalyst for hydrogen adsorption and dissociation, providing atomic hydrogen to the Co metal sites through the spillover effect. This keeps Co in its reduced state and may also provide sites for the dissociation of H2, further enhancing the catalytic performance of the PtCo bimetallic catalysts for benzene hydrogenation.

实验结果表明，PtCo双金属催化剂在苯氢化反应中的活性高于PtNi双金属催化剂。这得到了批反应研究中率常数和流反应研究中表观活化能的支持。Pt的存在促进了Co3O4的还原，增加了可用于氢化反应的金属位点的数量。此外，Pt作为高效的氢吸附和离解催化剂，通过溢出效应为Co金属位点提供原子氢，保持了Co的还原状态，并可能提供了氢气解离的位点，进一步提高了PtCo双金属催化剂在苯氢化反应中的催化性能。
