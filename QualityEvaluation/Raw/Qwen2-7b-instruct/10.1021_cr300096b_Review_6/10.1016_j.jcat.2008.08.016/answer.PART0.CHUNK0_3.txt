The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts appears to promote the reduction of cobalt oxides through hydrogen spillover. Pt can be reduced at lower temperatures than Co, therefore hydrogen that dissociates on the surface of Pt could migrate to the surface of Co3O4 and support, resulting in Co being reduced at much lower temperatures in the bimetallic catalysts.
In comparison, for supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts the effect of Pt addition was not as effective as that of PtCo bimetallic catalysts. There was still a broad reduction temperature range for the 1.2%Pt10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, although the onset of the reduction temperature was decreased as compared to 10%Ni/γ-Al2O3.

Answer: The addition of Pt to the PtNi bimetallic catalysts facilitates the reduction of Co3O4 and results in a decrease in the reduction temperature range for Co, compared to Ni-based catalysts. This effect is less pronounced in PtNi bimetallic catalysts than in PtCo bimetallic catalysts.

添加铂到PtNi双金属催化剂中，可以促进钴氧化物的还原，并导致钴在双金属催化剂中的还原温度范围降低，与Ni基催化剂相比。这种效应在PtNi双金属催化剂中的表现不如在PtCo双金属催化剂中明显。
