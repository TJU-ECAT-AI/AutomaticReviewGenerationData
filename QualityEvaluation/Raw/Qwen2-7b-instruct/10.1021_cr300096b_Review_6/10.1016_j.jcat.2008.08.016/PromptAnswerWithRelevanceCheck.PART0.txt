<p>As shown in both flow reactor (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) and batch reactor (Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Table 3) results, although both PtCo and PtNi catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activities than the parent metals, the two types of bimetallic catalysts demonstrate quite different catalytic performance between cyclohexene and benzene hydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>For benzene hydrogenation, the PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher activity than PtNi, as illustrated in the rate constants from batch reactor studies and the apparent activation energies from flow reactor studies.</p>
<p>The presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of Co3O4 and leads to an increase in the number of metal sites. Because Pt is an efficient catalyst for hydrogen adsorption and dissociation, it could provide atomic hydrogen to the Co metal sites for hydrogenation through the spillover effect. A closer inspection of the results in Fig. 5 suggests that Co is an active hydrogenation catalyst. For example, the apparent activation barriers over the 10%Co/Al2O3 and 1.2%Pt10%Co/Al2O3 are essentially identical, at 33.7 and 33.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, the role of Pt appears to be to keep Co in its reduced state and may also provide sites for the dissociation of H2.</p>

The experimental results demonstrate that the PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher activity than the PtNi bimetallic catalysts for benzene hydrogenation. This is supported by the rate constants from batch reactor studies and the apparent activation energies from flow reactor studies. The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts facilitates the reduction of Co3O4, increasing the number of metal sites available for hydrogenation. Additionally, Pt acts as an efficient catalyst for hydrogen adsorption and dissociation, providing atomic hydrogen to the Co metal sites through the spillover effect. This keeps Co in its reduced state and may also provide sites for the dissociation of H2, further enhancing the catalytic performance of the PtCo bimetallic catalysts for benzene hydrogenation.

实验结果表明，PtCo双金属催化剂在苯氢化反应中的活性高于PtNi双金属催化剂。这得到了批反应研究中率常数和流反应研究中表观活化能的支持。Pt的存在促进了Co3O4的还原，增加了可用于氢化反应的金属位点的数量。此外，Pt作为高效的氢吸附和离解催化剂，通过溢出效应为Co金属位点提供原子氢，保持了Co的还原状态，并可能提供了氢气解离的位点，进一步提高了PtCo双金属催化剂在苯氢化反应中的催化性能。

<p>While the trend in the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene, PtNi &gt; PtCo &gt; Pt, is consistent with previous surface science experiments and DFT modeling on the corresponding single crystal surfaces, the significantly higher hydrogenation activity of benzene over the PtCo catalysts suggests unique hydrogenation properties.

Experimental techniques such as TPR and AES have been used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts promotes the reduction of cobalt oxides through hydrogen spillover, allowing Pt to be reduced at lower temperatures than Co. This leads to the migration of hydrogen from the surface of Pt to the surface of Co3O4 and support, facilitating the reduction of Co at lower temperatures in the bimetallic catalysts. The effect of adding Pt to the PtNi bimetallic catalysts is less effective compared to the PtCo bimetallic catalysts. The distances between Pt atoms in the PtCo and PtNi catalysts are determined to be and respectively, which are between the bulk 3d3d and PtPt distances, indicating the presence of bimetallic bonds. The coordination numbers for Pt atoms in the PtCo and PtNi catalysts are and respectively, showing that most Pt atoms are primarily coordinated with 3d atoms. The PtNi catalyst has more metallic active sites than the PtCo catalyst. The conversion of benzene over the 1.2%Pt30%Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst increased to 50%, demonstrating the higher activity of PtCo bimetallic catalysts in benzene hydrogenation compared to Co, Ni, Pt monometallic and PtNi bimetallic catalysts.

实验技术如TPR和AES被用来验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导表面掺杂的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的存在。在PtCo催化剂中，Pt的存在通过氢扩散促进钴氧化物的还原，允许Pt在比Co更低的温度下被还原。这导致氢从Pt表面迁移到Co3O4和支撑表面，从而使得Co在双金属催化剂中在较低温度下被还原。添加到PtNi双金属催化剂中的Pt的效果与添加到PtCo双金属催化剂中的效果相比更为有限。在PtCo和PtNi催化剂中，Pt原子之间的距离分别为和，它们位于bulk 3d3d和PtPt距离之间，表明存在双金属键。PtCo和PtNi催化剂中的Pt原子的配位数分别为和，表明大多数Pt原子主要与3d原子配位。PtNi催化剂具有比PtCo催化剂更多的金属活性位点。1.2%Pt30%Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂上苯的转化率增加至50%，这证明了PtCo双金属催化剂在苯氢化反应中的高活性，相比于Co、Ni、Pt单金属和PtNi双金属催化剂。

The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts appears to promote the reduction of cobalt oxides through hydrogen spillover. Pt can be reduced at lower temperatures than Co, therefore hydrogen that dissociates on the surface of Pt could migrate to the surface of Co3O4 and support, resulting in Co being reduced at much lower temperatures in the bimetallic catalysts.
In comparison, for supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts the effect of Pt addition was not as effective as that of PtCo bimetallic catalysts. There was still a broad reduction temperature range for the 1.2%Pt10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, although the onset of the reduction temperature was decreased as compared to 10%Ni/γ-Al2O3.
</quotes>

Answer: The addition of Pt to the PtNi bimetallic catalysts facilitates the reduction of Co3O4 and results in a decrease in the reduction temperature range for Co, compared to Ni-based catalysts. This effect is less pronounced in PtNi bimetallic catalysts than in PtCo bimetallic catalysts.

添加铂到PtNi双金属催化剂中，可以促进钴氧化物的还原，并导致钴在双金属催化剂中的还原温度范围降低，与Ni基催化剂相比。这种效应在PtNi双金属催化剂中的表现不如在PtCo双金属催化剂中明显。
