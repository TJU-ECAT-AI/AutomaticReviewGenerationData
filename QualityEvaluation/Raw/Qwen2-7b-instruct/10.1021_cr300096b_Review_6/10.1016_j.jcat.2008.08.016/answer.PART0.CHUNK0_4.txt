1. TPR (Temperature-programmed reduction) was used to study the reducibility of the calcined catalysts, and their reduction profiles were depicted in Figure 1.
2. Figure 1 illustrates the TPR outcomes for catalysts with varying metal loadings.
3. The addition of Pt to the PtCo catalysts facilitates the reduction of cobalt oxides via hydrogen spillover.
4. The reduction temperature for the first step was reduced from about 688 K for 10%Co/γAl2O3 to 504 K for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst.
5. The hydrogen consumption was higher in Figure 3b due to increased Co and Ni loadings.
6. The first nearest neighbor distances for the PtCo and PtNi catalysts were determined to be 2.7 Å and 2.6 Å, respectively.
7. The PtNi catalyst demonstrated a higher number of metallic active sites.
8. The 1.2%Pt10%Co catalyst exhibited a significantly higher conversion of 30%.
9. The rate constant for the addition of the first hydrogen was 1.74 min⁻¹ for the 1.2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.
