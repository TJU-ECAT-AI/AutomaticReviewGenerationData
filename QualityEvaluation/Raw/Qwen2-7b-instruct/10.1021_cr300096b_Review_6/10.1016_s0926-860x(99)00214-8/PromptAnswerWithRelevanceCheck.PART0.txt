The structure and selectivity of metal catalysts, particularly focusing on bimetallic zeolite systems, are influenced by several key factors. Firstly, under mild oxygen treatment, the PtCo bimetallic particles separate, leaving platinum in the supercage and transferring cobalt ions to the sodalite cage or hexagonal prisms. Conversely, direct oxygen treatment on Ru/NaY results in the migration of ruthenium particles to the external surface, while cobalt stabilizes ruthenium inside the supercage. The reduction of cobalt ions is facilitated by ruthenium and platinum, leading to a cherry-type model structure with cobalt as the core. The major difference between mono- and bimetallic samples is primarily governed by the location of the metal particles and the reducibility of cobalt ions. The olefin/paraffin ratio varies based on the position of the metal particles, and the chain growth is dependent on the residence time of species within the zeolite. These factors collectively determine the behavior of zeolite-supported bimetallic particles, influencing their structure and selectivity in reactions such as CO hydrogenation.
