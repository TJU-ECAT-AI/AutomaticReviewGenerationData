[1] "Under mild oxygen treatment the PtCo bimetallic particles are separated leaving the platinum particles in the supercage and transferring the Co2+ ions into the sodalite cage or into the hexagonal prisms."
[2] "Direct oxygen treatment on Ru/NaY results in the migration of the ruthenium particles to the external surface of the NaY, while the presence of cobalt in RuCo/NaY stabilizes the ruthenium inside the supercage."
[3] "EXAFS and XPS measurements indicate the reduction of Co2+ ions facilitated by ruthenium and platinum, but the catalyst structure can be described by a cherry-type model containing cobalt as its kernel."
[4] "As a result the major difference between mono- and bimetallic samples is mainly controlled by the location of the metal particles and the extent of reducibility of Co2+ ions."
[5] "The olefin/paraffin ratio changes depending on the location of the metal particles, and the chain growth depends on the residence time of the species inside the zeolite."

The structure and selectivity of metal catalysts, particularly focusing on bimetallic zeolite systems, are influenced by several key factors. Firstly, under mild oxygen treatment, the PtCo bimetallic particles separate, leaving platinum in the supercage and transferring cobalt ions to the sodalite cage or hexagonal prisms. Conversely, direct oxygen treatment on Ru/NaY results in the migration of ruthenium particles to the external surface, while cobalt stabilizes ruthenium inside the supercage. The reduction of cobalt ions is facilitated by ruthenium and platinum, leading to a cherry-type model structure with cobalt as the core. The major difference between mono- and bimetallic samples is primarily governed by the location of the metal particles and the reducibility of cobalt ions. The olefin/paraffin ratio varies based on the position of the metal particles, and the chain growth is dependent on the residence time of species within the zeolite. These factors collectively determine the behavior of zeolite-supported bimetallic particles, influencing their structure and selectivity in reactions such as CO hydrogenation.

金属催化剂的结构和选择性，特别是关注于沸石双金属系统，受几个关键因素的影响。首先，在温和的氧气处理下，PtCo双金属颗粒分离，铂留在超笼中，将钴离子转移到sodalite笼或六方棱柱中。相反，直接氧气处理对Ru/NaY导致钌粒子迁移到外表面，而钴稳定了Ru在超笼中的位置。钴离子的还原由钌和铂促进，形成一个以钴为内核的樱桃型模型结构。单金属与双金属样品的主要差异主要由金属颗粒的位置和钴离子的可还原性控制。烯烃/烷烃比根据金属颗粒的位置变化，链增长取决于物种在沸石通道内的停留时间。这些因素共同决定了沸石支持的双金属颗粒的行为，影响它们在如CO氢化反应中的结构和选择性。
