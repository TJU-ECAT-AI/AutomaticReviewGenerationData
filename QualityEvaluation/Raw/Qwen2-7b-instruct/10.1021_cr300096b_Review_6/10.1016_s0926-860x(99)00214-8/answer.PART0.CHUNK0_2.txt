1. "Formation of the bimetallic particles inside the zeolite framework, the effect of pre-treatments using O2/H2, He/H2 and He/H2/O2/H2 on the structure of the small bimetallic particles have also been studied."
2. "The structure of the samples was related to the activity and selectivity in CO hydrogenation."
3. "Under mild oxygen treatment the PtCo bimetallic particles are separated leaving the platinum particles in the supercage and transferring the Co2+ ions into the sodalite cage or into the hexagonal prisms."
4. "Direct oxygen treatment on Ru/NaY results in the migration of the ruthenium particles to the external surface of the NaY, while the presence of cobalt in RuCo/NaY stabilizes the ruthenium inside the supercage."
5. "EXAFS and XPS measurements indicate the reduction of Co2+ ions facilitated by ruthenium and platinum, but the catalyst structure can be described by a cherry-type model containing cobalt as its kernel."
6. "As a result the major difference between mono- and bimetallic samples is mainly controlled by the location of the metal particles and the extent of reducibility of Co2+ ions."
7. "The olefin/paraffin ratio changes depending on the location of the metal particles, and the chain growth depends on the residence time of the species inside the zeolite."
8. "The major parameters governing the general behavior of zeolite-supported bimetallic particles, are discussed."

1. The study examines the impact of various treatments on the structure of bimetallic particles within zeolite frameworks.
2. The structure of the samples correlates with their activity and selectivity in CO hydrogenation.
3. Mild oxygen treatment separates the PtCo bimetallic particles, leaving platinum in the supercage and cobalt ions in the sodalite cage or hexagonal prisms.
4. Oxygen treatment on Ru/NaY leads to ruthenium particle migration to the external surface, while cobalt in RuCo/NaY stabilizes ruthenium within the supercage.
5. Reduction of Co2+ ions is influenced by ruthenium and platinum, and the catalyst structure is described by a cherry-type model with cobalt as the core.
6. The main difference between mono- and bimetallic samples is attributed to the location of metal particles and the reducibility of Co2+ ions.
7. The olefin/paraffin ratio varies based on the location of metal particles, and chain growth is influenced by the duration of species within the zeolite.
