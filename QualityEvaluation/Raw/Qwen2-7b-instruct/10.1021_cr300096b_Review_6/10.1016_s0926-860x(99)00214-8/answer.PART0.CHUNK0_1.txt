<p>The structure of the samples was related to the activity and selectivity in CO hydrogenation. Under mild oxygen treatment the PtCo bimetallic particles are separated leaving the platinum particles in the supercage and transferring the Co2+ ions into the sodalite cage or into the hexagonal prisms. Direct oxygen treatment on Ru/NaY results in the migration of the ruthenium particles to the external surface of the NaY, while the presence of cobalt in RuCo/NaY stabilizes the ruthenium inside the supercage.</p>
<p>EXAFS and XPS measurements indicate the reduction of Co2+ ions facilitated by ruthenium and platinum, but the catalyst structure can be described by a cherry-type model containing cobalt as its kernel. As a result the major difference between mono- and bimetallic samples is mainly controlled by the location of the metal particles and the extent of reducibility of Co2+ ions.</p>
<p>The olefin/paraffin ratio changes depending on the location of the metal particles, and the chain growth depends on the residence time of the species inside the zeolite. The major parameters governing the general behavior of zeolite-supported bimetallic particles, are discussed.</p>
<p>Formation of PtCo bimetallic particles is further supported by CO chemisorption measured by FTIR. The spectra of the CO molecules adsorbed on Pt/NaY and PtCo/NaY bimetallic catalysts prepared by IE and IM were measured at different temperatures. The absorption frequencies of the linearly bound CO molecules shift to lower wave numbers in the sequence of Pt/NaY(IE) > PtCo/NaY(IE) > Pt/NaY(IM).</p>
<p>EXAFS and anomalous wide angle X-ray scattering were performed on the PtCo/NaY samples. In the as prepared state the simulation procedure showed that Pt atoms are surrounded by 4.4 light atoms at 0.201 nm which means that the Pt environment remained basically unchanged during impregnation. As shown in Fig. 1 after the reduction step the first coordination sphere is made up of 6.5 Pt atoms at 0.272 nm, thus the average diameter of the metallic particle seems to be around 1.5 nm.</p>
<p>Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and desorption (TPD) have been utilized to study the stability of the PtCo bimetallic particles entrapped in NaY zeolite cages upon O2 oxidation and reaction with surface protons generated during the reduction of transition metal cations.</p>
<p>The best way to check the predicted behavior in the bimetallic system is to measure the catalytic activity and selectivity in CO hydrogenation. This is characteristic of the surface properties and of the structure and reactivity of the PtCo/NaY bimetallic catalysts prepared by the ion-exchange and impregnation methods.</p>
<p>Small cobalt oxide particles cannot easily be reduced: the smaller the size of the precursor cobalt oxide particles, the lesser is the extent to which they can be reduced. As stated in Section 3.1, it was established that cobalt particles can be kept well below a certain size if cobalt is inserted into zeolite supercage of NaY, but its reduction is limited to large extent.</p>
