[1] "Under mild oxygen treatment the PtCo bimetallic particles are separated leaving the platinum particles in the supercage and transferring the Co2+ ions into the sodalite cage or into the hexagonal prisms."
[2] "Direct oxygen treatment on Ru/NaY results in the migration of the ruthenium particles to the external surface of the NaY, while the presence of cobalt in RuCo/NaY stabilizes the ruthenium inside the supercage."
[3] "The structure of the samples was related to the activity and selectivity in CO hydrogenation."
[4] "The olefin/paraffin ratio changes depending on the location of the metal particles, and the chain growth depends on the residence time of the species inside the zeolite."

1. Under mild oxygen treatment, the PtCo bimetallic particles are separated, leaving platinum in the supercage and transferring cobalt ions into the sodalite cage or hexagonal prisms.
2. Direct oxygen treatment on Ru/NaY moves ruthenium particles to the external surface, while cobalt in RuCo/NaY stabilizes ruthenium inside the supercage.
3. The structure of the samples correlates with their activity and selectivity in CO hydrogenation.
4. The olefin/paraffin ratio varies according to the location of the metal particles, and chain growth depends on the residence time of the species within the zeolite.

1. 在温和的氧气处理下，PtCo双金属颗粒被分离，铂留在超笼中，而钴离子转移到钠盐笼或六方棱柱中。
2. 直接氧气处理使钌在NaY表面迁移，而RuCo/NaY中的钴稳定了钌在超笼内的位置。
3. 样品的结构与它们在CO氢化反应中的活性和选择性有关。
4. 芳烃/烷烃比率根据金属颗粒的位置变化，并且链增长取决于物种在沸石通道内的停留时间。
