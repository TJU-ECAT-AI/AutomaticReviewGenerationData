The number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts was determined using the volumetric static CO chemisorption technique. This method calculates the amount of CO chemisorbed onto the catalysts based on a stoichiometry of one CO molecule per surface metal atom. The CO uptake values for the PtNi and PtCo catalysts were notably higher than those for monometallic Pt, indicating that CO molecules also adsorb on some of the Ni or Co metals within the bimetallic catalysts.

活性位点的数量通过体积静态CO化学吸附技术确定。这种方法根据每表面金属原子一个CO分子的比例来计算吸附到催化剂上的CO量。对于PtNi和PtCo催化剂，其CO吸附值明显高于单金属Pt催化剂，这表明CO分子也吸附在某些Ni或Co金属上，这些金属存在于双金属催化剂中。
