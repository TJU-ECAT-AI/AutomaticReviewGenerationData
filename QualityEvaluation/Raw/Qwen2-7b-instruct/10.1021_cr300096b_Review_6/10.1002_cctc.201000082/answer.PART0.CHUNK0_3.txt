[1] "The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts show higher complete hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt, whereas PtCu is a promising catalyst for selective partial hydrogenation."
[2] "One exception was the PtCu catalyst, which exhibited unexpectedly low hydrogenation activity accompanied by a high selectivity toward partial hydrogenation to produce cyclohexene."
[3] "The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt, with the trend being consistent with previously reported correlations that higher hydrogenation activity is related to more weakly bonded alkenes."
[4] "However, the only hydrogenation product was cyclohexene, suggesting that PtCu is a promising bimetallic catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions."

The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts demonstrated higher complete hydrogenation rates compared to monometallic Pt. Conversely, PtCu showed low hydrogenation activity but high selectivity for producing cyclohexene, indicating its potential as a catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions. These findings align with the observation that higher hydrogenation activity correlates with more weakly bonded alkenes, as evidenced by the PtNi and PtCo catalysts.

PtNi和PtCo双金属催化剂在完全氢化速率上高于单金属Pt。相反，PtCu的氢化活性较低，但对生成环己烯的选择性高，这表明它可能是部分氢化反应的潜在催化剂。这些发现与更高氢化活性与更弱键合烯烃相关联的观察结果一致，如PtNi和PtCo催化剂所示。
