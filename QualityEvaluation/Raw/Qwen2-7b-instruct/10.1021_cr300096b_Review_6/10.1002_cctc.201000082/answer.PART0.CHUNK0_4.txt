It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show different physical, chemical, and electronic properties from the corresponding monometallic catalysts.16 Many investigations combining fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations have been performed with the goal of correlating electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces.28 Recently our group has studied the hydrogenation of cyclohexene over PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts, using both model single crystal surfaces9 and supported catalysts.10 The combined theoretical and experimental studies suggest that the novel hydrogenation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces is related to the modification of the electronic properties due to the formation of the PtNiPt and PtCoPt subsurface bimetallic structures.5,9 The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on these surfaces are weaker than those on monometalic Pt, making the bimetallic surfaces more active for the low temperature hydrogenation of the CC bond of cyclohexene.9 The prediction from the model surface studies has also been verified on supported PtNi and PtCo catalysts using both batch and flow reactors.10 In the current study, we extend the hydrogenation study to a more complex cyclic molecule, 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD).

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). These methods provide insights into the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which are then compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions. The HREELS and AES measurements allow for the observation of changes in the chemical environment of the segregated atoms, providing evidence for their presence and movement on the surface. The kinetic data obtained from these experiments can be contrasted with theoretical calculations to validate the models predicting the behavior of these bimetallic systems.
