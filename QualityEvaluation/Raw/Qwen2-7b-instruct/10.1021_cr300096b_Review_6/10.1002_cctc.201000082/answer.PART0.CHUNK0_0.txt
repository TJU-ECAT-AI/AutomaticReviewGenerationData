[1] "The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts show higher complete hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt, whereas PtCu is a promising catalyst for selective partial hydrogenation."
[2] "The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on these surfaces are weaker than those on monometallic Pt, making the bimetallic surfaces more active for the low temperature hydrogenation of the CC bond of cyclohexene."
[3] "The volumetric static CO chemisorption technique was used to measure the number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts (Table2)."
[4] "The consumption rate of 1,4-CHD, normalized by the weight of catalysts, followed the order PtNi>PtCo>Pt>PtCu; after normalization by the number of surface sites the general trend was the same, except that the order of PtNi and PtCo is reversed."
[5] "However, the only hydrogenation product was cyclohexene, suggesting that PtCu is a promising bimetallic catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions."

The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher complete hydrogenation rates compared to monometallic Pt. Conversely, PtCu is suitable for selective partial hydrogenation. The lower binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on these bimetallic surfaces make them more active for hydrogenating the CC bond of cyclohexene at low temperatures. The CO chemisorption method was employed to assess the number of active sites on the catalyst surfaces. The consumption rate of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) over the PtCu catalyst was notably slower, yet it produced only cyclohexene, indicating that PtCu is a potential catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions.

PtNi和PtCo双金属催化剂的完全氢化速率比单金属Pt高。相反，PtCu适用于选择性部分氢化。这些双金属表面较低的氢原子和环己二烯分子的结合能使其在低温下更活跃地氢化环己二烯的CC键。CO化学吸附方法被用来评估催化剂表面的活性位点数量。1,4-环己二烯（1,4-CHD）在PtCu催化剂上的消耗速率显著较慢，但仅生成环己烯，表明PtCu是部分氢化反应的潜在催化剂。
