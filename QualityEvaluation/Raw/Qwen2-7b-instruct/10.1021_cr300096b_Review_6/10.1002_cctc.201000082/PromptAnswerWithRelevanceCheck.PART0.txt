[1] "The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts show higher complete hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt, whereas PtCu is a promising catalyst for selective partial hydrogenation."
[2] "The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on these surfaces are weaker than those on monometallic Pt, making the bimetallic surfaces more active for the low temperature hydrogenation of the CC bond of cyclohexene."
[3] "The volumetric static CO chemisorption technique was used to measure the number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts (Table2)."
[4] "The consumption rate of 1,4-CHD, normalized by the weight of catalysts, followed the order PtNi>PtCo>Pt>PtCu; after normalization by the number of surface sites the general trend was the same, except that the order of PtNi and PtCo is reversed."
[5] "However, the only hydrogenation product was cyclohexene, suggesting that PtCu is a promising bimetallic catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions."

The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher complete hydrogenation rates compared to monometallic Pt. Conversely, PtCu is suitable for selective partial hydrogenation. The lower binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on these bimetallic surfaces make them more active for hydrogenating the CC bond of cyclohexene at low temperatures. The CO chemisorption method was employed to assess the number of active sites on the catalyst surfaces. The consumption rate of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) over the PtCu catalyst was notably slower, yet it produced only cyclohexene, indicating that PtCu is a potential catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions.

PtNi和PtCo双金属催化剂的完全氢化速率比单金属Pt高。相反，PtCu适用于选择性部分氢化。这些双金属表面较低的氢原子和环己二烯分子的结合能使其在低温下更活跃地氢化环己二烯的CC键。CO化学吸附方法被用来评估催化剂表面的活性位点数量。1,4-环己二烯（1,4-CHD）在PtCu催化剂上的消耗速率显著较慢，但仅生成环己烯，表明PtCu是部分氢化反应的潜在催化剂。

The number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts was determined using the volumetric static CO chemisorption technique. This method calculates the amount of CO chemisorbed onto the catalysts based on a stoichiometry of one CO molecule per surface metal atom. The CO uptake values for the PtNi and PtCo catalysts were notably higher than those for monometallic Pt, indicating that CO molecules also adsorb on some of the Ni or Co metals within the bimetallic catalysts.

活性位点的数量通过体积静态CO化学吸附技术确定。这种方法根据每表面金属原子一个CO分子的比例来计算吸附到催化剂上的CO量。对于PtNi和PtCo催化剂，其CO吸附值明显高于单金属Pt催化剂，这表明CO分子也吸附在某些Ni或Co金属上，这些金属存在于双金属催化剂中。

[1] "One exception was the PtCu catalyst, which exhibited unexpectedly low hydrogenation activity accompanied by a high selectivity toward partial hydrogenation to produce cyclohexene."
[2] "The consumption rate of 1,4-CHD over the PtCu catalyst was much slower than that over the other three catalysts, it exhibited a unique hydrogenation behavior, as illustrated by the absence of the cyclohexane product and the continuous increase in the concentration of the partial hydrogenation product, cyclohexene."
[3] "However, the low cyclohexene hydrogenation rate on PtCu alone is not sufficient to explain the absence of any cyclohexane product. One possible explanation is that the surface intermediate is different when PtCu is exposed to pure cyclohexene or to the reaction mixture of 1,4-CHD, benzene, and cyclohexene."
[4] "The lower rate of cyclohexene hydrogenation over PtCu was likely the origin for the higher concentration of cyclohexene as compared to the other three catalysts, whereupon cyclohexene was initially produced but was subsequently consumed due to the higher hydrogenation rate of cyclohexene over PtNi, PtCo and Pt."
[5] "The dehydrogenation product, benzene, was also produced during the reaction of 1,4-CHD over the four catalysts (Figure1). The concentration of benzene decreased slightly with reaction time over the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts. The hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane occurs readily over PtNi and PtCo at 343K,10 which might have been responsible for the slight consumption of benzene at 308K (Figure1)."
[6] "In contrast, the continuous increase in benzene concentration over the PtCu catalyst suggested that it was completely inert toward benzene hydrogenation at 308K (Figure2b)."

The hydrogenation behavior of the PtCu catalyst deviated significantly from the other catalysts. Despite having a relatively low binding energy for 1,4-cyclohexadiene, the PtCu catalyst showed low hydrogenation activity towards complete hydrogenation to cyclohexane. Instead, it selectively produced cyclohexene, which persisted throughout the reaction, suggesting a different surface intermediate. This behavior contrasts with the other catalysts, particularly PtNi, PtCo, and Pt, where cyclohexane was initially produced but was consumed due to their higher hydrogenation rates. The PtCu catalyst was inert towards the hydrogenation of benzene at 308K, explaining the lack of cyclohexane production despite the low hydrogenation rate of cyclohexene.

铂铜催化剂的氢化行为与其它催化剂大相径庭。尽管其1,4-环己二烯的结合能相对较低，铂铜催化剂在完全氢化至环己烷方面的活性却很低。相反，它选择性地生成了环己烯，该产物在整个反应过程中持续增加，暗示了不同的表面中间体。这一行为与其它催化剂（特别是铂镍、铂钴和铂），其中环己烷最初被产生但随后由于铂、铂钴和铂上环己烯较高的氢化速率而被消耗的情况形成对比。铂铜催化剂在308K下对苯的氢化作用完全无活性，这解释了缺乏环己烷产物的原因，尽管其环己烯的氢化速率较低。

The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts demonstrated higher complete hydrogenation rates compared to monometallic Pt. Conversely, PtCu showed low hydrogenation activity but high selectivity for producing cyclohexene, indicating its potential as a catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions. These findings align with the observation that higher hydrogenation activity correlates with more weakly bonded alkenes, as evidenced by the PtNi and PtCo catalysts.

It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show different physical, chemical, and electronic properties from the corresponding monometallic catalysts.16 Many investigations combining fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations have been performed with the goal of correlating electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces.28 Recently our group has studied the hydrogenation of cyclohexene over PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts, using both model single crystal surfaces9 and supported catalysts.10 The combined theoretical and experimental studies suggest that the novel hydrogenation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces is related to the modification of the electronic properties due to the formation of the PtNiPt and PtCoPt subsurface bimetallic structures.5,9 The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on these surfaces are weaker than those on monometalic Pt, making the bimetallic surfaces more active for the low temperature hydrogenation of the CC bond of cyclohexene.9 The prediction from the model surface studies has also been verified on supported PtNi and PtCo catalysts using both batch and flow reactors.10 In the current study, we extend the hydrogenation study to a more complex cyclic molecule, 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD).

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). These methods provide insights into the segregation kinetics and activation barriers, which are then compared with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions. The HREELS and AES measurements allow for the observation of changes in the chemical environment of the segregated atoms, providing evidence for their presence and movement on the surface. The kinetic data obtained from these experiments can be contrasted with theoretical calculations to validate the models predicting the behavior of these bimetallic systems.
