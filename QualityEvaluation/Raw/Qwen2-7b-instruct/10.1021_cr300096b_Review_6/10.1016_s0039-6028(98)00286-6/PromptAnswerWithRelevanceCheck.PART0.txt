How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

The results of a comparative STM and TPD/TPR study on the adsorption and oxidation of CO on pure Ru(0001) and on structurally and compositionally well-defined, bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surfaces are presented. The defect structure and local surface composition of the bimetallic substrates, which are produced by epitaxial growth of monolayer Pt islands or by Pt deposition and subsequent surface alloying, are characterized by high-resolution STM images with chemical contrast. TPD and TPR experiments for CO adsorption/oxidation on these surfaces show a distinct lowering of the CO adsorption energy on the bimetallic surfaces with respect to the pure Ru(0001) and Pt(111) surfaces, with the onset of CO desorption already at 230 K.

Answer: The onset of CO desorption on the bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surfaces is at 230 K, significantly lower than on the pure Ru(0001) or Pt(111) surfaces.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答：铂/钌双金属表面上的CO脱附起始温度为230 K，显著低于纯钌（0001）或铂（111）表面。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
The reduction in adsorption energy is attributed to an electronic modification of the deposit metal due to interaction with the Ru(0001) substrate. The bimetallic surface alloy catalyzes CO oxidation under UHV conditions. The reduced temperature for CO2 desorption as compared to Pt(111) indicates an even lower barrier than on the latter surface, whereas the pure Ru(0001) surface is inert under these conditions.
</quotes>

Answer: The decrease in adsorption energy is due to an electronic alteration of the deposited metal caused by interaction with the Ru(0001) substrate. The bimetallic surface alloy catalyzes CO oxidation under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Compared to Pt(111), the bimetallic surface shows a lower barrier for CO2 desorption, indicating even lower activation energy.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答：吸附能的降低归因于沉积金属与钌（0001）基底相互作用导致的电子结构改变。双金属表面合金在超高真空条件下催化CO氧化。与Pt（111）相比，双金属表面对于CO2脱附的温度更低，表明激活能更低。

[1] "The results presented have important implications for the understanding of PtRu bimetallic catalysts. These are currently considered as very active and CO tolerant catalysts for the electrocatalytic oxidation of H2 in CO-containing feed gases in low-temperature fuel cells [3], and for the direct methanol oxidation [2]. Based on the results for Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) and PtRu(0001) surface alloys, the increased CO tolerance as compared with conventional Pt catalysts can be at least partly explained by the reduced CO adsorption energy on these surfaces, caused by an electronic modification of the Pt surface atoms due to interaction with neighboring Ru atoms. As a consequence, the desorption rate is increased, and the dynamic equilibrium coverage at operating temperatures of about 330350 K is reduced, so that the remaining CO adlayer no longer inhibits H2 adsorption and dissociation. The CO coverage is further reduced by the lower barrier for CO oxidation on the bimetallic PtRu surfaces as compared with the reaction on pure Pt(111). This interpretation is distinctly different from the bifunctional mechanism for CO oxidation on PtRu surfaces suggested earlier as an explanation for the improved CO tolerance of PtRu catalysts 11,12."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Based on the experimental results, the bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surfaces exhibit a reduced CO adsorption energy, which leads to an increased desorption rate and a decreased dynamic equilibrium CO coverage at operating temperatures around 330-350 K. This reduction allows H2 adsorption and dissociation to proceed without being inhibited by the remaining CO adlayer. Moreover, the lower barrier for CO oxidation on the bimetallic surface compared to pure Pt(111) further reduces the CO coverage, contributing to the enhanced CO tolerance of PtRu catalysts. This mechanism differs from the previously proposed bifunctional mechanism that attributed the improved CO tolerance to the enhanced CO oxidation activity at Pt sites due to the interaction with Ru.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
基于实验结果，Pt/Ru(0001)双金属表面的CO吸附能降低，导致脱附速率增加和在约330-350K的操作温度下的动态平衡CO覆盖度减少。这使得H2吸附和解离过程不会被剩余的CO吸附层所抑制。此外，与纯Pt(111)表面相比，PtRu表面的CO氧化壁垒更低，进一步降低了CO覆盖度，从而增强了PtRu催化剂的CO耐受性。这一机制与之前提出的双功能机制不同，该机制将改进的CO耐受性归因于Ru的存在增强了Pt位点上的CO氧化活性。

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems typically involve high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). HREELS allows for the detection of energy shifts in the core-level spectra, which can indicate the presence of segregated elements. AES provides information on the chemical state and concentration of elements at the surface, helping to understand the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. The measured values are compared with density functional theory (DFT) predictions to validate the theoretical models and to refine the understanding of the segregation mechanisms. 

The kinetics and activation barriers for surface segregation can vary depending on factors such as the specific elements involved, the substrate, and the deposition conditions. The comparison between experimental observations and DFT predictions helps in identifying discrepancies that might guide further research into the underlying mechanisms. For instance, if the experimental data show slower segregation rates or higher activation energies than predicted, it might suggest that additional factors, such as surface defects or alloying effects, are influencing the segregation process. Conversely, agreement between experiment and theory strengthens the confidence in the theoretical models and their applicability to real-world materials science problems.
