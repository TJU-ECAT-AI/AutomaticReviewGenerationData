The adsorption energy of CO on a Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surface or on a PtRu surface alloy is significantly lower than that on either of the two pure surfaces. For 0.4 ML Pt, the onset of desorption is shifted to about 230 K on the Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surface and to 250 K on the surface alloy. Therefrom, a reduction of the adsorption energy at saturation by about 0.25 eV is estimated as compared to adsorption on the pure Ru(0001) and Pt(111) surfaces.
Different from Ru(0001), but similar to Pt(111), the bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surface is not inert with respect to CO oxidation under UHV conditions. Upon heating a bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surface with coadsorbed Oad and COad, an appreciable amount of CO2 formation is observed, in addition to the dominant CO desorption.
The reaction experiments with preadsorbed oxygen revealed two different Oad species on the bimetallic surface alloy species, one being practically inert with respect to CO oxidation and the other one being reactive under UHV conditions.
The results presented have important implications for the understanding of PtRu bimetallic catalysts. These are currently considered as very active and CO tolerant catalysts for the electrocatalytic oxidation of H2 in CO-containing feed gases in low-temperature fuel cells [3] , and for the direct methanol oxidation [2].

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems typically involve high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). HREELS allows for the detection of energy shifts in the core-level spectra, which can indicate the presence of segregated elements. AES provides information on the chemical state and concentration of elements at the surface, helping to understand the segregation kinetics and activation barriers. The measured values are compared with density functional theory (DFT) predictions to validate the theoretical models and to refine the understanding of the segregation mechanisms. 

The kinetics and activation barriers for surface segregation can vary depending on factors such as the specific elements involved, the substrate, and the deposition conditions. The comparison between experimental observations and DFT predictions helps in identifying discrepancies that might guide further research into the underlying mechanisms. For instance, if the experimental data show slower segregation rates or higher activation energies than predicted, it might suggest that additional factors, such as surface defects or alloying effects, are influencing the segregation process. Conversely, agreement between experiment and theory strengthens the confidence in the theoretical models and their applicability to real-world materials science problems.

验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中次表层3d原子的表面分层，通常采用高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和Auger电子能谱（AES）。HREELS可以检测核心级光谱的能量偏移，这可以表明分层元素的存在。AES提供了表面元素的化学状态和浓度信息，有助于理解分层动力学和激活壁垒。实验结果与密度泛函理论（DFT）预测的比较，可以验证理论模型的有效性，并细化对分层机制的理解。例如，如果实验数据显示分层速率较慢或激活能较高，可能意味着其他因素，如表面缺陷或合金效应，正在影响分层过程。反之，实验结果与理论预测的一致性加强了对理论模型的信心及其在材料科学问题中的应用价值。
