[1] "The adsorption energy of CO on a Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surface or on a PtRu surface alloy is significantly lower than that on either of the two pure surfaces. For 0.4 ML Pt, the onset of desorption is shifted to about 230 K on the Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surface and to 250 K on the surface alloy."
[2] "Different from Ru(0001), but similar to Pt(111), the bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surface is not inert with respect to CO oxidation under UHV conditions. Upon heating a bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surface with coadsorbed Oad and COad, an appreciable amount of CO2 formation is observed, in addition to the dominant CO desorption."
[3] "The reaction experiments with preadsorbed oxygen revealed two different Oad species on the bimetallic surface alloy species, one being practically inert with respect to CO oxidation and the other one being reactive under UHV conditions."

1. Pt单层岛覆盖的Ru(0001)表面或PtRu表面合金上CO的吸附能显著低于两种纯表面。对于0.4 ML Pt，Pt单层岛覆盖的Ru(0001)表面上的脱附起始温度为约230 K，而表面合金上的温度为250 K。

2. 不同于Ru(0001)，但类似于Pt(111)，双金属Pt/Ru(0001)表面在UHV条件下对CO氧化不惰性。加热带有COad和Oad共吸附的双金属Pt/Ru(0001)表面时，观察到大量CO2形成，同时主导CO脱附。

3. 使用预吸附氧的反应实验揭示了双金属表面合金物种上的两种不同Oad物种，一种对CO氧化几乎无活性，另一种在UHV条件下具有活性。
