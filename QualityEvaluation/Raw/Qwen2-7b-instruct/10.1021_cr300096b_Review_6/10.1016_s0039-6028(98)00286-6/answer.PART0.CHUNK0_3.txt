[1] "The results presented have important implications for the understanding of PtRu bimetallic catalysts. These are currently considered as very active and CO tolerant catalysts for the electrocatalytic oxidation of H2 in CO-containing feed gases in low-temperature fuel cells [3], and for the direct methanol oxidation [2]. Based on the results for Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) and PtRu(0001) surface alloys, the increased CO tolerance as compared with conventional Pt catalysts can be at least partly explained by the reduced CO adsorption energy on these surfaces, caused by an electronic modification of the Pt surface atoms due to interaction with neighboring Ru atoms. As a consequence, the desorption rate is increased, and the dynamic equilibrium coverage at operating temperatures of about 330350 K is reduced, so that the remaining CO adlayer no longer inhibits H2 adsorption and dissociation. The CO coverage is further reduced by the lower barrier for CO oxidation on the bimetallic PtRu surfaces as compared with the reaction on pure Pt(111). This interpretation is distinctly different from the bifunctional mechanism for CO oxidation on PtRu surfaces suggested earlier as an explanation for the improved CO tolerance of PtRu catalysts 11,12."

Based on the experimental results, the bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surfaces exhibit a reduced CO adsorption energy, which leads to an increased desorption rate and a decreased dynamic equilibrium CO coverage at operating temperatures around 330-350 K. This reduction allows H2 adsorption and dissociation to proceed without being inhibited by the remaining CO adlayer. Moreover, the lower barrier for CO oxidation on the bimetallic surface compared to pure Pt(111) further reduces the CO coverage, contributing to the enhanced CO tolerance of PtRu catalysts. This mechanism differs from the previously proposed bifunctional mechanism that attributed the improved CO tolerance to the enhanced CO oxidation activity at Pt sites due to the interaction with Ru.

基于实验结果，Pt/Ru(0001)双金属表面的CO吸附能降低，导致脱附速率增加和在约330-350K的操作温度下的动态平衡CO覆盖度减少。这使得H2吸附和解离过程不会被剩余的CO吸附层所抑制。此外，与纯Pt(111)表面相比，PtRu表面的CO氧化壁垒更低，进一步降低了CO覆盖度，从而增强了PtRu催化剂的CO耐受性。这一机制与之前提出的双功能机制不同，该机制将改进的CO耐受性归因于Ru的存在增强了Pt位点上的CO氧化活性。
