[1] "The adsorption energy of CO on a Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surface or on a PtRu surface alloy is significantly lower than that on either of the two pure surfaces. For 0.4 ML Pt, the onset of desorption is shifted to about 230 K on the Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surface and to 250 K on the surface alloy."
[2] "Different from Ru(0001), but similar to Pt(111), the bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surface is not inert with respect to CO oxidation under UHV conditions."
[3] "Upon heating a bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surface with coadsorbed Oad and COad, an appreciable amount of CO2 formation is observed, in addition to the dominant CO desorption."
[4] "The higher reactivity compared with the pure Ru(0001) substrate can be easily explained by assuming an on average lower binding energy of oxygen to the alloy surface."
[5] "The reaction experiments with preadsorbed oxygen revealed two different Oad species on the bimetallic surface alloy species, one being practically inert with respect to CO oxidation and the other one being reactive under UHV conditions."

1. Pt单层岛覆盖的Ru(0001)表面或PtRu表面合金上，CO吸附能显著低于纯表面。对于0.4 ML Pt，在Pt单层岛覆盖的Ru(0001)表面上，脱附开始温度为约230 K，而在表面合金上为250 K。
2. 与纯的Ru(0001)不同，但类似于Pt(111)，双金属Pt/Ru(0001)表面在高真空条件下对CO氧化不惰性。
3. 加热含Oad和COad的双金属Pt/Ru(0001)表面时，观察到可观的CO2生成，同时存在主要的CO脱附。
4. 与纯的Ru(0001)基底相比，合金表面的氧吸附能平均较低，可以解释更高的反应活性。
5. 反应实验中预吸附的氧揭示了双金属表面合金上的两种不同的Oad物种，一种几乎不参与CO氧化，另一种在UHV条件下反应活性较高。
