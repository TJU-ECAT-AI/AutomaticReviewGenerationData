[1] "The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene has been used to test our catalysts since this reaction has been extensively studied by the group of Vannice over monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness technique."
[2] "For each data point, a bracketing technique was employed (18), which consisted of 30 min for the system to reach the steady state, 30 min to perform several sample analyses, and again 30 min under pure H2 for the regeneration of the catalyst, which actually recovers its former activity."
[3] "The purpose of this paper is to show that all these criteria are fulfilled by using the laser vaporization technique."
[4] "The size histograms, i.e., before and after reaction, are presented respectively in Figs. 3 and 4."
[5] "The activation energies corresponding to pure Pd and Pt are consistent with those measured on samples prepared by chemical methods (15, 16)."
[6] "Moreover, in the present case, the metal loading is too low to measure by LEIS the surface composition with a reasonable accuracy."
[7] "This maximum has been explained by assuming either a decrease of the surface coverage by aromatics at high temperature (18) or the formation of hydrogen-deficient surface carbonaceous species resulting from a dehydrogenation of the aromatics (23)."
[8] "One can also wonder if the active site can be described by two adjacent atoms over the whole range of temperature."
[9] "The effect of an inert or a slightly active diluent on the activity can be predicted, once the size of the active site has been determined."

1. The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene has been utilized as a testing method for the catalysts because it has been extensively researched by the Vannice group on monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts created through the incipient wetness technique.
2. For each data point, a bracketing technique was used, which included 30 minutes for the system to reach a steady state, 30 minutes for performing multiple sample analyses, and another 30 minutes under pure H2 for catalyst regeneration, which restores its original activity.
3. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that all the aforementioned requirements are met using the laser vaporization technique.
4. The size distribution histograms before and after the reaction are depicted in Figures 3 and 4.
5. The activation energies for pure Pd and Pt are in line with those measured on samples prepared via chemical methods (15, 16).
6. In the current situation, the metal loading is insufficient to accurately measure the surface composition using LEIS.
7. The reason behind the maximum in the activity curves might be attributed to a reduction in aromatic surface coverage at high temperature (18) or the dehydrogenation of aromatics forming hydrogen-deficient surface carbonaceous species (23).
8. It's possible that the active site can be described by two neighboring atoms throughout the entire temperature range.
9. Once the size of the active site has been determined, the impact of an inactive or slightly active diluent on the activity can be predicted.

1. 汽相氢化苯已烷被用作测试催化剂的方法，因为它已经被Vannice小组在通过浸渍湿法制备的单金属Pd/Al2O3和Pt/Al2O3催化剂上进行了广泛的研究。
2. 对于每个数据点，使用了一种括号技术，包括系统达到稳定状态的30分钟，30分钟进行多次样本分析，以及再次在纯H2下进行催化剂再生，这实际上恢复了其原有的活性。
3. 本文的目的在于证明所有这些标准都可通过激光蒸发技术实现。
4. 反应前后尺寸分布直方图分别在图3和图4中展示。
5. 纯Pd和Pt的活化能与通过化学方法测量的样品一致（15, 16）。
6. 当前情况下，金属负载过低无法通过LEIS准确测量表面组成。
7. 这个最大值的原因可能是由于高温度时芳香物表面覆盖率的减少（18）或芳香物脱氢形成氢缺陷表面碳质物种（23）。
8. 有可能将活性位点描述为在整个温度范围内相邻的两个原子。
9. 一旦确定了活性位点的大小，无活性或轻微活性稀释剂对活性的影响就可以预测。
