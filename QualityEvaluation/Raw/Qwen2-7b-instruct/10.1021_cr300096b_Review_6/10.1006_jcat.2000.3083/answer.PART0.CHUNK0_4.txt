[1] "The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remarkably uniform composition."
[2] "A simple explanation for this uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical methods the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support."
[3] "Moreover, it is, in principle, adapted to obtain bimetallic catalysts with all kinds of alloys, even with nonmiscible metals like Au Ni (19) or AgNi (31)."
