[1] "Since the size, the structure, or the composition of supported bimetallics is difficult to control for active phases obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straightforward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one."
[2] "To make the comparison easier, one needs to prepare monometallic and bimetallic systems having approximately the same size, morphology, and overall, uniform and well-defined composition."
[3] "The purpose of this paper is to show that all these criteria are fulfilled by using the laser vaporization technique."
[4] "In this paper, we report on the preparation, the characterization, and the catalytic behavior of pure Pd or Pt as well as bimetallic PdPt clusters produced by laser vaporization of bulk metals and alloys and deposited on high surface area alumina (γ -Al2O3)."
[5] "The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene has been used to test our catalysts since this reaction has been extensively studied by the group of Vannice over monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness technique."
[6] "For each data point, a bracketing technique was employed, which consisted of 30 min for the system to reach the steady state, 30 min to perform several sample analyses, and again 30 min under pure H2 for the regeneration of the catalyst, which actually recovers its former activity."

The experimental techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. TEM imaging showed that the mean size and standard deviation for all the fresh samples were nearly identical, indicating that the vaporization source produces clusters of the same size regardless of the metals or alloys. This uniformity was further confirmed by EDX analysis, which revealed that the composition of individual particles in the bimetallic systems was equal to that of the vaporized rod. The laser vaporization technique enabled the preparation of well-tailored supported particles with a uniform composition, facilitating detailed investigations of the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts compared to monometals. The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene was used as a testing method due to its extensive study over monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness technique. The bracketing technique involved a steady-state period, followed by sample analysis and regeneration of the catalyst under pure hydrogen, ensuring the catalyst's recovery of its original activity.

在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，利用透射电子显微镜（TEM）和能量色散X射线光谱法（EDX）验证并量化了氧诱导表面异质原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。TEM成像显示所有新鲜样品的平均尺寸和标准差几乎相同，表明蒸发源生成的簇无论金属或合金如何都具有相同的尺寸。这种一致性通过EDX分析进一步确认，该分析揭示了双金属体系中单个粒子的组成与蒸发棒的组成相等。激光蒸发技术允许制备具有均匀组成的良好定制支持颗粒，从而促进双金属催化剂与单金属相比的催化性质详细研究。由于使用气相氢化苯乙烯作为测试方法来研究由浸渍湿法技术制备的单金属Pd/Al2O3和Pt/Al2O3催化剂的广泛研究，因此使用了蒸气相氢化苯乙烯作为测试方法。采用括号技术包括稳定状态期，随后进行样本分析并在纯氢下对催化剂进行再生，确保催化剂恢复其原始活性。
