<p>The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remark- ably uniform composition. A simple explanation for this uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical meth- ods the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support.</p>
<p>In the hydrogenation of toluene, the results concerning the pure metals are in agreement with those of the literature. On the bimetallic catalysts, we have demonstrated that no synergy between the two elements can be evidenced, the rates being perfectly explained by an additivity of the properties of the two metals.</p>
<p>The behavior of the Pd17Pt83 bimetallic system at high temperature, which shows a cooperative effect between Pd and Pt, is interpreted by the ability of Pd to supply hydrogen in sufficient amount, whereas the aromatics remain more strongly bonded on platinum.</p>

The uniform composition of bimetallic clusters produced by laser vaporization is due to the clusters forming before deposition, unlike chemical methods where composition depends on the affinity of precursors for the support. The hydrogenation of toluene on pure metals aligns with literature findings, and on bimetallic catalysts, no synergy exists between the elements; their rates are explained by the additive properties of the metals. The cooperative effect in the Pd17Pt83 system at high temperature is attributed to Pd supplying sufficient hydrogen, while aromatics remain strongly bound to platinum.

激光蒸发技术产生的二元合金簇具有均匀的组成，原因是簇在沉积前已经形成，与化学方法中由前体对支持物的亲和力决定组成的区别。纯金属在对甲苯氢化中的结果与文献相符，在二元催化剂上，两个元素之间没有协同作用，它们的速率通过两种金属的性质的叠加得到解释。在高温度下Pd17Pt83系统的合作效应被归因于Pd提供足够的氢气，而芳香族化合物则牢固地绑定到铂上。
