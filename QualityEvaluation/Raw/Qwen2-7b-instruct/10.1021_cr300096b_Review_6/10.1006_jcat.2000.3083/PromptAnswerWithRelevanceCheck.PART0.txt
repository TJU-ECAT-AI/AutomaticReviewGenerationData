<p>The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remark- ably uniform composition. A simple explanation for this uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical meth- ods the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support.</p>
<p>In the hydrogenation of toluene, the results concerning the pure metals are in agreement with those of the literature. On the bimetallic catalysts, we have demonstrated that no synergy between the two elements can be evidenced, the rates being perfectly explained by an additivity of the properties of the two metals.</p>
<p>The behavior of the Pd17Pt83 bimetallic system at high temperature, which shows a cooperative effect between Pd and Pt, is interpreted by the ability of Pd to supply hydrogen in sufficient amount, whereas the aromatics remain more strongly bonded on platinum.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The uniform composition of bimetallic clusters produced by laser vaporization is due to the clusters forming before deposition, unlike chemical methods where composition depends on the affinity of precursors for the support. The hydrogenation of toluene on pure metals aligns with literature findings, and on bimetallic catalysts, no synergy exists between the elements; their rates are explained by the additive properties of the metals. The cooperative effect in the Pd17Pt83 system at high temperature is attributed to Pd supplying sufficient hydrogen, while aromatics remain strongly bound to platinum.

激光蒸发技术产生的二元合金簇具有均匀的组成，原因是簇在沉积前已经形成，与化学方法中由前体对支持物的亲和力决定组成的区别。纯金属在对甲苯氢化中的结果与文献相符，在二元催化剂上，两个元素之间没有协同作用，它们的速率通过两种金属的性质的叠加得到解释。在高温度下Pd17Pt83系统的合作效应被归因于Pd提供足够的氢气，而芳香族化合物则牢固地绑定到铂上。

[1] "The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene has been used to test our catalysts since this reaction has been extensively studied by the group of Vannice over monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness technique."
[2] "For each data point, a bracketing technique was employed (18), which consisted of 30 min for the system to reach the steady state, 30 min to perform several sample analyses, and again 30 min under pure H2 for the regeneration of the catalyst, which actually recovers its former activity."

[5] "The activation energies corresponding to pure Pd and Pt are consistent with those measured on samples prepared by chemical methods (15, 16)."
[6] "Moreover, in the present case, the metal loading is too low to measure by LEIS the surface composition with a reasonable accuracy."
[7] "This maximum has been explained by assuming either a decrease of the surface coverage by aromatics at high temperature (18) or the formation of hydrogen-deficient surface carbonaceous species resulting from a dehydrogenation of the aromatics (23)."
[8] "One can also wonder if the active site can be described by two adjacent atoms over the whole range of temperature."

1. The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene has been utilized as a testing method for the catalysts because it has been extensively researched by the Vannice group on monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts created through the incipient wetness technique.
2. For each data point, a bracketing technique was used, which included 30 minutes for the system to reach a steady state, 30 minutes for performing multiple sample analyses, and another 30 minutes under pure H2 for catalyst regeneration, which restores its original activity.
3. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that all the aforementioned requirements are met using the laser vaporization technique.
4. The size distribution histograms before and after the reaction are depicted in Figures 3 and 4.
5. The activation energies for pure Pd and Pt are in line with those measured on samples prepared via chemical methods (15, 16).
6. In the current situation, the metal loading is insufficient to accurately measure the surface composition using LEIS.
7. The reason behind the maximum in the activity curves might be attributed to a reduction in aromatic surface coverage at high temperature (18) or the dehydrogenation of aromatics forming hydrogen-deficient surface carbonaceous species (23).
8. It's possible that the active site can be described by two neighboring atoms throughout the entire temperature range.
9. Once the size of the active site has been determined, the impact of an inactive or slightly active diluent on the activity can be predicted.

5. 纯Pd和Pt的活化能与通过化学方法测量的样品一致（15, 16）。

The laser vaporization technique ensures the preparation of bimetallic clusters with uniform composition, making it easier to compare their catalytic properties with monometallic ones. This method creates ligand-free metal clusters, including bimetallic systems with compositions identical to the vaporized alloys. The clusters are deposited on γ-alumina powder through a stirring device in front of the cluster beam. For catalytic activity measurements, a bracketing technique is used to ensure the catalyst regains its original activity after the experiment.

The experimental techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were utilized to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. TEM imaging showed that the mean size and standard deviation for all the fresh samples were nearly identical, indicating that the vaporization source produces clusters of the same size regardless of the metals or alloys. This uniformity was further confirmed by EDX analysis, which revealed that the composition of individual particles in the bimetallic systems was equal to that of the vaporized rod. The laser vaporization technique enabled the preparation of well-tailored supported particles with a uniform composition, facilitating detailed investigations of the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts compared to monometals. The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene was used as a testing method due to its extensive study over monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness technique. The bracketing technique involved a steady-state period, followed by sample analysis and regeneration of the catalyst under pure hydrogen, ensuring the catalyst's recovery of its original activity.
