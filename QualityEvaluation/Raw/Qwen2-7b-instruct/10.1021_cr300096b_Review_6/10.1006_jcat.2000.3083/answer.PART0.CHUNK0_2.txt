[1] "The purpose of this paper is to show that all these criteria are fulfilled by using the laser vaporization technique."
[2] "Since the size, the structure, or the composition of supported bimetallics is difficult to control for active phases obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straightforward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one."
[3] "The laser vaporization technique allows the generation of ligand-free metal clusters and,in the case of bimetallic systems, particles which all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target."
[4] "To deposit the clusters on the support, which in the present case is a γ -alumina powder (Condea, Puralox SCFa-240 with a specific area of 240 m2/g), a device was developed which stirs the power in front of the cluster beam."
[5] "For each data point, a bracketing technique was employed (18), which consisted of 30 min for the system to reach the steady state, 30 min to perform several sample analyses, and again 30 min under pure H2 for the regeneration of the catalyst, which actually recovers its former activity."

The laser vaporization technique ensures the preparation of bimetallic clusters with uniform composition, making it easier to compare their catalytic properties with monometallic ones. This method creates ligand-free metal clusters, including bimetallic systems with compositions identical to the vaporized alloys. The clusters are deposited on γ-alumina powder through a stirring device in front of the cluster beam. For catalytic activity measurements, a bracketing technique is used to ensure the catalyst regains its original activity after the experiment.

激光蒸发技术确保了制备具有均匀组成的双金属簇，使得更容易将它们的催化性能与单金属进行比较。该方法通过生成不含配体的金属簇，包括具有蒸发合金组成的所有类型的双金属系统。簇通过位于簇束前方的搅拌装置沉积在γ-Al2O3粉末上。对于催化活性测量，采用夹点技术确保催化剂在实验后恢复其原始活性。
