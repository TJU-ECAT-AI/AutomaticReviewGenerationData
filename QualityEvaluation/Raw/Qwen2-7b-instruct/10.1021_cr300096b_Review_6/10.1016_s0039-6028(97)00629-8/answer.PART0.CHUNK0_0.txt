The presence of alloyed Sn in Pt-Sn surfaces does not have a large influence on Pt(111) chemistry. We noted that ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) has shown that alloying causes only small changes in the Pt d-DOS and in particular the DOS near Ev [40]. However, because of the stronger Sn-O bond compared with the Pt-O bond and the thermodynamic driving force for forming tin oxide, it is possible that Sn would increase the reactivity of the clean Pt( 111 ) surface, either increasing the adsorption energies of alcohols or lowering the activation barrier to dissociative adsorption. This intuitive idea does not correctly predict our results.

The presence of Sn in Pt-Sn alloys does not significantly affect the chemical properties of Pt(111). UPS studies indicate minor alterations in the Pt d-DOS and the Pt-O bond. Contrary to the intuitive expectation that the stronger Sn-O bond would enhance the reactivity of the Pt surface, increasing the adsorption energies of alcohols or lowering the activation barrier for dissociative adsorption, our experimental results do not support this prediction.

在Pt-Sn合金中，Sn的存在对Pt(111)表面的化学性质影响不大。紫外线光电谱研究表明，Pt的d-DOS和Pt-O键附近有轻微的变化。与直觉相反，尽管Sn-O键更强，且有形成氧化锡的热力学驱动力，但这一想法并没有正确预测出我们的实验结果。我们发现，Sn的存在并未显著增加醇类分子在Pt表面的吸附能或降低其脱附活化能。

The desorption temperature and desorption activation energy of this bilayer and subsequent condensed layers are unaffected by alloying, even though there is evidence that at very low coverages there is a small weakening of the direct interaction of water molecules with the surface with increasing Sn concentration.

The desorption temperature and desorption activation energy of the water bilayer and subsequent condensed layers remain unchanged despite the presence of alloying. There is evidence suggesting that at very low coverages, the direct interaction between water molecules and the surface weakens slightly with increasing Sn concentration, yet this does not affect the desorption characteristics.

水的双层结构及其后续凝聚层的脱附温度和脱附激活能不受合金化的影响。虽然有证据表明，在极低覆盖率下，随着Sn浓度的增加，水分子与表面之间的直接相互作用会略微减弱，但这并未影响脱附特性。
