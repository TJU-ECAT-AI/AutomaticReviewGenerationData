[1] "The interaction of water with transition metal surfaces is also an important topic for discussion of the electrode chemistry in electro-oxidation of alcohols."
[2] "We observed a decrease in the adsorption energies because Sn is not directly involved in the bonding of these molecules to the surface and the subtle localization of charge due to Pt Sn bonding weakens the adsorbate-surface interaction."
[3] "Water is only weakly adsorbed on all three surfaces studied and a thermally stabilized bilayer structure is formed on the two alloy surfaces similarly to Pt(111 )."

Water molecules are weakly adsorbed on Pt-Sn surface alloys, and a stable bilayer structure is formed on these surfaces. This bilayer structure is similar to that observed on the clean Pt(111) surface.
