[1] "The objective of this study was to determine the adsorption energies of these mole- cules on Pt( 111 ) and two different bimetallic sur- faces, the (2 x2) and ( x'f3)R30 ' Sn/Pt(lll) surface alloys."
[2] "Specifically, we wanted to evaluate whether the presence of Sn in the surface layer leads to an increase in adsorption energy or thermally activates these molecules for reaction due to the thermodynamic driving force provided by the Sn-O interaction."
[3] "We observed a decrease in the adsorption energies because Sn is not directly involved in the bonding of these molecules to the surface and the subtle localization of charge due to Pt Sn bonding weakens the adsorbate-surface interaction."
[4] "Regarding the reactivity of these surfaces, the activation barrier for dissociative adsorption of water exceeds 38-44 kJ/mol on these three surfaces."
[5] "The molecular desorption peak temperatures are shown for desorption at relatively low coverages of about 10% of the monolayer saturation coverage in order to reduce the influence of lateral interactions in the adsorbed layer."
[6] "In addition, the right-hand axis in Fig. 13 approximately indicates the corre- sponding desorption activation energies (this is an approximate guide since there is not strictly a linear relationship between the peak temperature and the activation energy)."

1. The primary objective of the study was to ascertain the adsorption energies of methanol, ethanol, and water on platinum surfaces and two Pt-Sn bimetallic surface alloys.
2. The research aimed to evaluate if the incorporation of tin (Sn) in the surface layer affects the adsorption energy, potentially enhancing the reactivity of these molecules through a thermodynamic driving force.
3. The study revealed that the presence of tin reduces the adsorption energies of methanol and ethanol due to its indirect involvement in the molecule-surface bond and the subtle alteration of charge distribution caused by Pt-Sn bonding, which weakens the interaction between the adsorbate and the surface.
4. The activation barrier for the dissociative adsorption of water on all three surfaces (Pt(111), 2x2 Sn/Pt(111), and (x'/3)R30 Sn/Pt(111)) exceeds 38-44 kJ/mol.
5. The study focused on measuring the desorption peak temperatures for low surface coverages (around 10% of the monolayer saturation coverage) to minimize the impact of lateral interactions within the adsorbed layer.
6. The right-hand axis in Figure 13 provides an estimated indication of the corresponding desorption activation energies, acknowledging that there isn't a strict linear correlation between peak temperature and activation energy.

1. 研究的主要目标是确定这些分子在铂表面和两种铂锡双金属表面合金上的吸附能。
2. 研究旨在评估表面层中锡（Sn）的存在是否导致吸附能增加，通过热力学驱动力激活这些分子进行反应。
3. 研究发现，锡的存在降低了甲醇和乙醇的吸附能，原因在于它间接参与分子与表面的结合，并且由于铂锡键合导致电荷分布的微小改变，这减弱了吸附剂与表面之间的相互作用。
4. 在所有三个表面上（铂（111）、2x2锡/铂（111）和（x'/3）R30锡/铂（111）），水分解吸附的活化能超过38-44 kJ/mol。
5. 研究重点关注测量低表面覆盖率（约为单层饱和覆盖度的10%）的脱附峰温度，以最小化吸附层内横向相互作用的影响。
6. 图13的右轴提供了相应的脱附活化能的大致指示，认识到峰值温度与活化能量之间并不存在严格的线性关系。
