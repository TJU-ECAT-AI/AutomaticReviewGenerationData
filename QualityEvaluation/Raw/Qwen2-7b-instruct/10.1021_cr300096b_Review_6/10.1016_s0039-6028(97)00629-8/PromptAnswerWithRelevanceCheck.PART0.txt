How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

The presence of alloyed Sn in Pt-Sn surfaces does not have a large influence on Pt(111) chemistry. We noted that ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) has shown that alloying causes only small changes in the Pt d-DOS and in particular the DOS near Ev [40]. However, because of the stronger Sn-O bond compared with the Pt-O bond and the thermodynamic driving force for forming tin oxide, it is possible that Sn would increase the reactivity of the clean Pt( 111 ) surface, either increasing the adsorption energies of alcohols or lowering the activation barrier to dissociative adsorption. This intuitive idea does not correctly predict our results.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of Sn in Pt-Sn alloys does not significantly affect the chemical properties of Pt(111). UPS studies indicate minor alterations in the Pt d-DOS and the Pt-O bond. Contrary to the intuitive expectation that the stronger Sn-O bond would enhance the reactivity of the Pt surface, increasing the adsorption energies of alcohols or lowering the activation barrier for dissociative adsorption, our experimental results do not support this prediction.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在Pt-Sn合金中，Sn的存在对Pt(111)表面的化学性质影响不大。紫外线光电谱研究表明，Pt的d-DOS和Pt-O键附近有轻微的变化。与直觉相反，尽管Sn-O键更强，且有形成氧化锡的热力学驱动力，但这一想法并没有正确预测出我们的实验结果。我们发现，Sn的存在并未显著增加醇类分子在Pt表面的吸附能或降低其脱附活化能。

The desorption temperature and desorption activation energy of this bilayer and subsequent condensed layers are unaffected by alloying, even though there is evidence that at very low coverages there is a small weakening of the direct interaction of water molecules with the surface with increasing Sn concentration.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The desorption temperature and desorption activation energy of the water bilayer and subsequent condensed layers remain unchanged despite the presence of alloying. There is evidence suggesting that at very low coverages, the direct interaction between water molecules and the surface weakens slightly with increasing Sn concentration, yet this does not affect the desorption characteristics.

The study primarily utilized temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) mass spectroscopy to analyze the adsorption and desorption of methanol, ethanol, and water on Pt(lll) and two ordered Pt-Sn alloy surfaces. The purpose was to assess if the presence of Sn in the surface layer affects the adsorption energy or thermally activates the molecules for reactions, influenced by the thermodynamic driving force of the Sn-O interaction. The Pt-Sn alloys were created by depositing several monolayers of Sn onto the Pt(lll) crystal surface followed by annealing at 1000 K for 10 seconds. Alloying Sn with Pt(111) resulted in a slight decrease in adsorbate-surface bonding across all cases, attributed to increased Pt orbital localization due to Pt-Sn bonding interactions. Water exhibited weak adsorption on all studied surfaces, forming a thermally stabilized bilayer structure on the two alloy surfaces akin to Pt(111). The findings offer benchmarks for discussing alcohol surface chemistry on Pt-Sn alloys, paving the way for enhanced understanding of electro-oxidation and catalysis of alcohols and oxygenated molecules on bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts.

本研究主要采用温度程序脱附（TPD）质谱法分析了甲醇、乙醇和水在Pt（lll）和两种有序的Pt-Sn合金表面的吸附和脱附情况。目的是评估在表面层存在Sn时，是否会影响吸附能或使分子在热动力学驱动力下活化反应，这一驱动力由Sn-O相互作用提供。通过将几个单层的Sn沉积到Pt（lll）晶体表面，然后在1000 K下退火10秒来制备Pt-Sn合金。Sn与Pt（111）合金化导致所有情况下吸附剂-表面键合的轻微减少，归因于由于Pt-Sn键合作用引起的Pt轨道局部化。水在所有研究的表面上表现出弱吸附，并在两个合金表面上形成类似Pt（111）的热稳定双层结构。发现为讨论Pt-Sn合金上醇的表面化学提供了基准，为增强对醇和氧基分子在双金属Pt-Sn催化剂上的电氧化和催化作用的理解铺平了道路。

1. The primary objective of the study was to ascertain the adsorption energies of methanol, ethanol, and water on platinum surfaces and two Pt-Sn bimetallic surface alloys.
2. The research aimed to evaluate if the incorporation of tin (Sn) in the surface layer affects the adsorption energy, potentially enhancing the reactivity of these molecules through a thermodynamic driving force.
3. The study revealed that the presence of tin reduces the adsorption energies of methanol and ethanol due to its indirect involvement in the molecule-surface bond and the subtle alteration of charge distribution caused by Pt-Sn bonding, which weakens the interaction between the adsorbate and the surface.
4. The activation barrier for the dissociative adsorption of water on all three surfaces (Pt(111), 2x2 Sn/Pt(111), and (x'/3)R30 Sn/Pt(111)) exceeds 38-44 kJ/mol.
5. The study focused on measuring the desorption peak temperatures for low surface coverages (around 10% of the monolayer saturation coverage) to minimize the impact of lateral interactions within the adsorbed layer.
6. The right-hand axis in Figure 13 provides an estimated indication of the corresponding desorption activation energies, acknowledging that there isn't a strict linear correlation between peak temperature and activation energy.

1. 研究的主要目标是确定这些分子在铂表面和两种铂锡双金属表面合金上的吸附能。
2. 研究旨在评估表面层中锡（Sn）的存在是否导致吸附能增加，通过热力学驱动力激活这些分子进行反应。

4. 在所有三个表面上（铂（111）、2x2锡/铂（111）和（x'/3）R30锡/铂（111）），水分解吸附的活化能超过38-44 kJ/mol。
5. 研究重点关注测量低表面覆盖率（约为单层饱和覆盖度的10%）的脱附峰温度，以最小化吸附层内横向相互作用的影响。
