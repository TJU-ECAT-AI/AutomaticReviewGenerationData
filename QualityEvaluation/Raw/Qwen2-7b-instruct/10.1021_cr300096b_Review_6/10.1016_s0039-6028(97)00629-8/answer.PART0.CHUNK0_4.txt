[1] "The two alloys studied were the p(2 × 2)Sn/Pt( 111 ) and ( × f3)R30 " Sn/Pt( 111 ) surface alloys prepared by vapor deposition of Sn on Pt( 111 ), with 0s. =0.25 and 0.33, respectively."
[2] "All three molecules are weakly bonded and reversibly adsorbed under UHV conditions on all three surfaces,molecularly desorbing during TPD without any decomposition."
[3] "The two Pt Sn surface alloys were found to chemisorb both methanol and ethanol slightly more weakly than on the Pt( 111 ) surface."
[4] "The desorption activation energies measured by TPD, and hence the adsorption energies, of both methanol and ethanol progressively decrease as the surface concentration of Sn increases,compared with Pt( 111 )."
[5] "The sticking coefficients and the monolayer coverages of these alcohols on the two alloys were identical to that on Pt( 111 ) at 100 K,independent of the amount of Sn present in the surface layer."
[6] "Water clusters are formed even at low coverages on all three surfaces, eventually forming a water bilayer prior to the formation of a condensed ice phase."
[7] "The interaction of water with transition metal surfaces is also an important topic for discussion of the electrode chemistry in electro-oxidation of alcohols."
[8] "Water is only weakly adsorbed on all three surfaces studied and a thermally stabilized bilayer structure is formed on the two alloy surfaces similarly to Pt(111 )."
[9] "Our data provide benchmarks for discussing the surface chemistry of alco- hols on Pt-Sn alloys, opening the road for an improved understanding of electro-oxidation and catalysis of alcohols and other oxygenated mole- cules on bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts."

1. The two studied alloys are p(2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) and ( × f3)R30 "Sn/Pt(111), prepared by vapor deposition of Sn on Pt(111).
2. Methanol, ethanol, and water are weakly bonded and reversibly adsorbed under UHV conditions on all three surfaces, molecularly desorbing without decomposition.
3. The two Pt-Sn alloys chemisorb methanol and ethanol slightly more weakly than the Pt(111) surface.
4. The desorption activation energies of methanol and ethanol decrease as the surface concentration of Sn increases, compared to Pt(111).
5. The sticking coefficients and monolayer coverages of methanol and ethanol on the two alloys are identical to that on Pt(111) at 100 K, regardless of the Sn surface concentration.
6. Water clusters form at low coverages on all three surfaces, eventually forming a water bilayer before ice phase formation.
7. The weak adsorption of water and the formation of a bilayer structure on the two alloy surfaces are important topics in electro-oxidation chemistry.
8. Water is weakly adsorbed on all surfaces, and a thermally stable bilayer structure is formed on the two alloy surfaces like Pt(111).
