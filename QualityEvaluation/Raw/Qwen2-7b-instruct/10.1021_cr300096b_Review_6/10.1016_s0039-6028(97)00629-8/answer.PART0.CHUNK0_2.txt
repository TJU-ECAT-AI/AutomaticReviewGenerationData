The study primarily utilized temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) mass spectroscopy to analyze the adsorption and desorption of methanol, ethanol, and water on Pt(lll) and two ordered Pt-Sn alloy surfaces. The purpose was to assess if the presence of Sn in the surface layer affects the adsorption energy or thermally activates the molecules for reactions, influenced by the thermodynamic driving force of the Sn-O interaction. The Pt-Sn alloys were created by depositing several monolayers of Sn onto the Pt(lll) crystal surface followed by annealing at 1000 K for 10 seconds. Alloying Sn with Pt(111) resulted in a slight decrease in adsorbate-surface bonding across all cases, attributed to increased Pt orbital localization due to Pt-Sn bonding interactions. Water exhibited weak adsorption on all studied surfaces, forming a thermally stabilized bilayer structure on the two alloy surfaces akin to Pt(111). The findings offer benchmarks for discussing alcohol surface chemistry on Pt-Sn alloys, paving the way for enhanced understanding of electro-oxidation and catalysis of alcohols and oxygenated molecules on bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts.

本研究主要采用温度程序脱附（TPD）质谱法分析了甲醇、乙醇和水在Pt（lll）和两种有序的Pt-Sn合金表面的吸附和脱附情况。目的是评估在表面层存在Sn时，是否会影响吸附能或使分子在热动力学驱动力下活化反应，这一驱动力由Sn-O相互作用提供。通过将几个单层的Sn沉积到Pt（lll）晶体表面，然后在1000 K下退火10秒来制备Pt-Sn合金。Sn与Pt（111）合金化导致所有情况下吸附剂-表面键合的轻微减少，归因于由于Pt-Sn键合作用引起的Pt轨道局部化。水在所有研究的表面上表现出弱吸附，并在两个合金表面上形成类似Pt（111）的热稳定双层结构。发现为讨论Pt-Sn合金上醇的表面化学提供了基准，为增强对醇和氧基分子在双金属Pt-Sn催化剂上的电氧化和催化作用的理解铺平了道路。
