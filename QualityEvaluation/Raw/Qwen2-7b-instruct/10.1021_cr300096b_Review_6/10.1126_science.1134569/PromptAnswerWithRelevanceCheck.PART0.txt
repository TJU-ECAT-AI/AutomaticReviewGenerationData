[1] "We demonstrated that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes (a continuing problem in vehicle applications) by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters."
[2] "In situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and voltammetry data suggest that the Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential."
[3] "The high ORR activity of the Au clusters on a modified Pt/C electrocatalyst is a counterintuitive observation."
[4] "Without this decrease, it appears that Au clusters have a very high activity, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk Au or of carbon-supported Au nanoparticles."

The experimental techniques of in situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and voltammetry were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The data showed that the Au clusters raised the Pt oxidation potential, leading to the stabilization of the Pt surface against dissolution under potential cycling regimes. The high ORR activity of the Au clusters on the Pt/C electrocatalyst was counterintuitive, suggesting a high activity despite covering approximately one-third of the Pt sites. This activity could be attributed to the efficient spillover of H2O2 from the Au clusters to the surrounding Pt atoms, enabling further reduction to H2O, or the formation of AuOH at certain potentials, which might assist in reducing H2O2.

在原位近边吸收X射线光谱和伏安法的实验技术下，证实并量化了Ni和Co等3d原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面聚集现象。数据表明，Au簇提高了Pt的氧化电位，从而实现了对Pt催化剂在电化学循环条件下的稳定化作用。Au簇在Pt/C电催化剂上的高氧还原反应活性出乎意料，尽管覆盖了约三分之一的Pt位点。这种高活性可能归因于Au簇向周围Pt原子高效地转移H2O2，使进一步还原为H2O成为可能，或者在特定的电位下形成AuOH，这可能有助于减少H2O2。

<p>Despite considerable recent advances, existing fuel-cell technology still has drawbacks, including the instability of the Pt electrocatalyst for the ORR at the cathode (10).</p>
<p>Recent work recorded a substantial loss of the Pt surface area over time in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) (11) during the stop-and-go driving of an electric car; this depletion exceeded the Pt dissolution rates observed upon holding at constant potentials (12) for extended time spans.</p>
<p>Our results show promise toward resolving this impediment.</p>
<p>For comparison, a Pt/C catalyst with the same Pt loading as that in Au/Pt/C was subjected to the same potential cycling conditions.</p>
<p>After 30,000 cycles, changes in the Pt surface area and electrocatalytic activity of the ORR were determined.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of Au/Pt/C, measured as the currents of O2 reduction obtained before and after potential cycling, showed only a 5-mV degradation in half-wave potential over the cycling period (Fig. 3A); in contrast, the corresponding change for Pt/C amounts to a loss of 39 mV (Fig. 3C).</p>
<p>However, for Pt/C, only 55% of the original Pt surface area remained after potential cycling (Fig. 3D).</p>

The document discusses the stabilization of platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts using gold (Au) clusters. These clusters prevent Pt dissolution during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under potential cycling, without decreasing the oxygen reduction kinetics. After 30,000 potential cycling tests, the Pt surface area and electrocatalytic activity of the ORR were significantly reduced for the pure Pt catalyst (55% remaining), compared to the Au/Pt/C catalyst, which experienced only a 5-mV degradation in half-wave potential over the same period.

<p>The stabilizing effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined in an accelerated stability test by continuously applying linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V, which caused surface oxidation/reduction cycles of Pt.</p>
<p>We conducted the test by applying potential sweeps at the rate of 50 mV/s to a thin-layer rotating disk electrode in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution at room temperature.</p>
<p>For comparison, a Pt/C catalyst with the same Pt loading as that in Au/Pt/C was subjected to the same potential cycling conditions.</p>
<p>After 30,000 cycles, changes in the Pt surface area and electrocatalytic activity of the ORR were determined.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of Au/Pt/C, measured as the currents of O2 reduction obtained before and after potential cycling, showed only a 5-mV degradation in half-wave potential over the cycling period.</p>
<p>However, for Pt/C, only 55% of the original Pt surface area remained after potential cycling.</p>
<p>As expected, the surface-area measurements are in good agreement with the measured ORR activities.</p>
<p>In the XANES spectra for Au/Pt/C at the Pt L3 edge (Fig. 4A), the intensity of the absorption bands reflects the depletion of the d band caused by the oxidation of Pt; a very small potential dependence indicates such oxidation.</p>
<p>This effect is more evident in the relative change of the x-ray absorption peak intensity of the Pt L3 edge spectra for Au/Pt/C and Pt/C as a function of potential (Fig. 4B).</p>
<p>The increase in the intensity of the absorption edge peak for the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst commences at considerably higher potentials than does that for the Pt/C catalyst; thus, the oxidation of Pt nanoparticles modified by Au clusters requires much higher potentials than are necessary for unmodified Pt nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The high Pt oxidation potential of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst (that is, the lower extent of Pt oxidation) is clearly the major mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters.</p>
<p>To explain the observed activity, we might consider an efficient spillover of H2O2 from Au clusters to the surrounding Pt atoms, where further reduction to H2O can take place.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if AuOH is formed at certain potentials, it may help in reducing H2O2, as discussed for alkaline solutions.</p>
<p>Such behavior could account for the negligible loss of activity of the Pt surface toward ORR.</p>

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include in situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. These methods allow for the determination of the oxidation state of Pt as a function of potential and provide insights into the stabilization effect of Au clusters on the Pt surface. The XANES spectra show a decreased oxidation of Pt nanoparticles covered by Au clusters compared to unmodified Pt nanoparticles, suggesting that the Au clusters raise the Pt oxidation potential, contributing to the stabilization effect.

The high Pt oxidation potential of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst indicates that the oxidation of Pt nanoparticles modified by Au clusters requires much higher potentials than for unmodified Pt nanoparticles. This reduced oxidation is the primary mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters on the Pt surface.

Regarding the origin of the observed stabilization effect, the formation of AuOH at certain potentials could potentially help reduce H2O2, accounting for the negligible loss of activity of the Pt surface towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

The stabilization effect of Au clusters on the Pt surface, combined with the high activity of the Au clusters themselves, offers promising possibilities for synthesizing improved ORR Pt-based catalysts and stabilizing Pt and other Pt-group metals under oxidizing conditions.

在验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面分离的3d原子时，采用的实验技术包括原位x射线吸收近边谱(XANES)和扩展x射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)光谱。这些方法允许确定Pt的氧化态随电势的变化，并提供Au簇对Pt表面稳定性的洞察。XANES光谱显示，Au簇覆盖的Pt纳米颗粒的氧化程度低于未修改的Pt纳米颗粒，表明Au簇提高了Pt的氧化电位，从而对Pt表面产生稳定作用。

Au/Pt/C电解催化剂的高Pt氧化电位表明，Au簇覆盖的Pt纳米颗粒的氧化需要比未修改的Pt纳米颗粒更高的电位。这种较低的氧化是Au簇在Pt表面稳定作用的主要机制。

关于观察到的稳定作用的起源，AuOH在某些电位下可能有助于减少H2O2，这可以解释Pt表面向氧还原反应（ORR）活动的微小损失。

Au簇在Pt表面的稳定作用，结合Au簇本身的高活性，为合成改进的ORR Pt基催化剂和在氧化条件下稳定Pt和其他铂族金属提供了有希望的可能性。

The Au clusters were deposited on a Pt catalyst through a process called galvanic displacement, where Au replaces a Cu monolayer on the Pt surface. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the structure of the Au-modified Pt/C catalyst. Voltammetry helped determine the Pt surface area by measuring hydrogen adsorption before and after potential cycling. The stabilization effect of Au clusters on Pt is mainly due to the increased high Pt oxidation potential, leading to less extent of Pt oxidation. Table 1 summarizes the observed changes in surface area and catalytic activity data caused by potential cycling.

The document demonstrates the stabilization of platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts through the modification of Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters. This stabilization occurs under oxidizing conditions and potential cycling regimes, with the Au clusters conferring stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential. The stabilization effect is evidenced by insignificant changes in the activity and surface area of Au-modified Pt over extensive cycling, contrasting with significant losses observed with pure Pt catalysts under the same conditions. The stabilization mechanism is attributed to the Au clusters' ability to prevent Pt dissolution during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) without decreasing the oxygen reduction kinetics. This study highlights the potential of Au clusters to resolve the instability issue of Pt electrocatalysts in fuel cells, which are expected to become a major source of clean energy, especially in transportation applications.

本文展示了通过将金（Au）簇修改Pt纳米颗粒，Pt氧还原燃料电池电催化剂的稳定化。这种稳定化在氧化性条件下和电位循环制度下发生，并且Au簇通过提高Pt氧化势能赋予稳定性。该稳定化效果由Au修饰Pt的活性和表面积在长期循环中的显著变化缺乏，与纯Pt催化剂在相同条件下观察到的大规模损失形成对比。稳定机制归因于Au簇能够防止Pt在氧还原反应（ORR）期间溶解，同时不降低氧气还原动力学。这项研究强调了Au簇解决Pt电催化剂在燃料电池中的不稳定问题的潜力，这有望成为主要的清洁能源来源，尤其是在交通运输应用中。
