<p>Despite considerable recent advances, existing fuel-cell technology still has drawbacks, including the instability of the Pt electrocatalyst for the ORR at the cathode (10).</p>
<p>Recent work recorded a substantial loss of the Pt surface area over time in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) (11) during the stop-and-go driving of an electric car; this depletion exceeded the Pt dissolution rates observed upon holding at constant potentials (12) for extended time spans.</p>
<p>Our results show promise toward resolving this impediment.</p>
<p>For comparison, a Pt/C catalyst with the same Pt loading as that in Au/Pt/C was subjected to the same potential cycling conditions.</p>
<p>After 30,000 cycles, changes in the Pt surface area and electrocatalytic activity of the ORR were determined.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of Au/Pt/C, measured as the currents of O2 reduction obtained before and after potential cycling, showed only a 5-mV degradation in half-wave potential over the cycling period (Fig. 3A); in contrast, the corresponding change for Pt/C amounts to a loss of 39 mV (Fig. 3C).</p>
<p>However, for Pt/C, only 55% of the original Pt surface area remained after potential cycling (Fig. 3D).</p>

The document discusses the stabilization of platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts using gold (Au) clusters. These clusters prevent Pt dissolution during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under potential cycling, without decreasing the oxygen reduction kinetics. After 30,000 potential cycling tests, the Pt surface area and electrocatalytic activity of the ORR were significantly reduced for the pure Pt catalyst (55% remaining), compared to the Au/Pt/C catalyst, which experienced only a 5-mV degradation in half-wave potential over the same period.

文档讨论了使用金簇对铂氧还原燃料电池电催化剂的稳定化。这些簇在氧化条件下防止铂溶解，并且不会降低氧还原动力学。在30,000次电势循环测试后，纯铂催化剂的表面面积和电催化活性的ORR显著减少（剩余55%），而Au/Pt/C催化剂在相同周期内仅经历了半波电位下降5毫伏的降解。
