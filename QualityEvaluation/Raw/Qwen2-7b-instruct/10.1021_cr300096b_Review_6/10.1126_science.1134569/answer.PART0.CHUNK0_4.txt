[1] "This behavior was observed under the oxidizing conditions of the O2 reduction reaction and potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts in over 30,000 cycles."
[2] "The Au clusters on carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles were generated using the same method. Because the size of the Pt nanoparticles is about 3 nm, the Au clusters on Au/Pt/C are clearly much smaller than those on Au/Pt(111)."
[3] "After undergoing several potential sweeps to 1.2 V, the Au monolayer transformed into three-dimensional clusters (Fig. 1)."
[4] "We found that the Pt nanoparticles retain their ORR activity crucial for fuel-cell catalysts after the deposition of Au clusters."
[5] "The stabilizing effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined in an accelerated stability test by continuously applying linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V, which caused surface oxidation/reduction cycles of Pt."
[6] "For all electrodes, the Pt loading was 1.95 μg(or10 nmol) of Pt on a 0.164 cm2 glassy carbon rotating-disk electrode."
[7] "For the loss in E1/2 of 39 mV, the calculated value for the remaining active Pt surface area is 47% of the initial one."
[8] "The high Pt oxidation potential of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst (that is, the lower extent of Pt oxidation) is clearly the major mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters."

The document demonstrates the stabilization of platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts through the modification of Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters. This stabilization occurs under oxidizing conditions and potential cycling regimes, with the Au clusters conferring stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential. The stabilization effect is evidenced by insignificant changes in the activity and surface area of Au-modified Pt over extensive cycling, contrasting with significant losses observed with pure Pt catalysts under the same conditions. The stabilization mechanism is attributed to the Au clusters' ability to prevent Pt dissolution during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) without decreasing the oxygen reduction kinetics. This study highlights the potential of Au clusters to resolve the instability issue of Pt electrocatalysts in fuel cells, which are expected to become a major source of clean energy, especially in transportation applications.

本文展示了通过将金（Au）簇修改Pt纳米颗粒，Pt氧还原燃料电池电催化剂的稳定化。这种稳定化在氧化性条件下和电位循环制度下发生，并且Au簇通过提高Pt氧化势能赋予稳定性。该稳定化效果由Au修饰Pt的活性和表面积在长期循环中的显著变化缺乏，与纯Pt催化剂在相同条件下观察到的大规模损失形成对比。稳定机制归因于Au簇能够防止Pt在氧还原反应（ORR）期间溶解，同时不降低氧气还原动力学。这项研究强调了Au簇解决Pt电催化剂在燃料电池中的不稳定问题的潜力，这有望成为主要的清洁能源来源，尤其是在交通运输应用中。
