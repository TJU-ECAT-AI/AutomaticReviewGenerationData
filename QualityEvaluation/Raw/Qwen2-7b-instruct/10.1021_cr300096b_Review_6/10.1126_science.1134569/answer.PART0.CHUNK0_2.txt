<p>The stabilizing effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined in an accelerated stability test by continuously applying linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V, which caused surface oxidation/reduction cycles of Pt.</p>
<p>We conducted the test by applying potential sweeps at the rate of 50 mV/s to a thin-layer rotating disk electrode in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution at room temperature.</p>
<p>For comparison, a Pt/C catalyst with the same Pt loading as that in Au/Pt/C was subjected to the same potential cycling conditions.</p>
<p>After 30,000 cycles, changes in the Pt surface area and electrocatalytic activity of the ORR were determined.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of Au/Pt/C, measured as the currents of O2 reduction obtained before and after potential cycling, showed only a 5-mV degradation in half-wave potential over the cycling period.</p>
<p>However, for Pt/C, only 55% of the original Pt surface area remained after potential cycling.</p>
<p>As expected, the surface-area measurements are in good agreement with the measured ORR activities.</p>
<p>In the XANES spectra for Au/Pt/C at the Pt L3 edge (Fig. 4A), the intensity of the absorption bands reflects the depletion of the d band caused by the oxidation of Pt; a very small potential dependence indicates such oxidation.</p>
<p>This effect is more evident in the relative change of the x-ray absorption peak intensity of the Pt L3 edge spectra for Au/Pt/C and Pt/C as a function of potential (Fig. 4B).</p>
<p>The increase in the intensity of the absorption edge peak for the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst commences at considerably higher potentials than does that for the Pt/C catalyst; thus, the oxidation of Pt nanoparticles modified by Au clusters requires much higher potentials than are necessary for unmodified Pt nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The high Pt oxidation potential of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst (that is, the lower extent of Pt oxidation) is clearly the major mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters.</p>
<p>To explain the observed activity, we might consider an efficient spillover of H2O2 from Au clusters to the surrounding Pt atoms, where further reduction to H2O can take place.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if AuOH is formed at certain potentials, it may help in reducing H2O2, as discussed for alkaline solutions.</p>
<p>Such behavior could account for the negligible loss of activity of the Pt surface toward ORR.</p>

The experimental techniques used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems include in situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. These methods allow for the determination of the oxidation state of Pt as a function of potential and provide insights into the stabilization effect of Au clusters on the Pt surface. The XANES spectra show a decreased oxidation of Pt nanoparticles covered by Au clusters compared to unmodified Pt nanoparticles, suggesting that the Au clusters raise the Pt oxidation potential, contributing to the stabilization effect.

The high Pt oxidation potential of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst indicates that the oxidation of Pt nanoparticles modified by Au clusters requires much higher potentials than for unmodified Pt nanoparticles. This reduced oxidation is the primary mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters on the Pt surface.

Regarding the origin of the observed stabilization effect, the formation of AuOH at certain potentials could potentially help reduce H2O2, accounting for the negligible loss of activity of the Pt surface towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

The stabilization effect of Au clusters on the Pt surface, combined with the high activity of the Au clusters themselves, offers promising possibilities for synthesizing improved ORR Pt-based catalysts and stabilizing Pt and other Pt-group metals under oxidizing conditions.

在验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面分离的3d原子时，采用的实验技术包括原位x射线吸收近边谱(XANES)和扩展x射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)光谱。这些方法允许确定Pt的氧化态随电势的变化，并提供Au簇对Pt表面稳定性的洞察。XANES光谱显示，Au簇覆盖的Pt纳米颗粒的氧化程度低于未修改的Pt纳米颗粒，表明Au簇提高了Pt的氧化电位，从而对Pt表面产生稳定作用。

Au/Pt/C电解催化剂的高Pt氧化电位表明，Au簇覆盖的Pt纳米颗粒的氧化需要比未修改的Pt纳米颗粒更高的电位。这种较低的氧化是Au簇在Pt表面稳定作用的主要机制。

关于观察到的稳定作用的起源，AuOH在某些电位下可能有助于减少H2O2，这可以解释Pt表面向氧还原反应（ORR）活动的微小损失。

Au簇在Pt表面的稳定作用，结合Au簇本身的高活性，为合成改进的ORR Pt基催化剂和在氧化条件下稳定Pt和其他铂族金属提供了有希望的可能性。
