[1] "We demonstrated that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes (a continuing problem in vehicle applications) by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters."
[2] "In situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and voltammetry data suggest that the Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential."
[3] "The high ORR activity of the Au clusters on a modified Pt/C electrocatalyst is a counterintuitive observation."
[4] "Without this decrease, it appears that Au clusters have a very high activity, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk Au or of carbon-supported Au nanoparticles."

The experimental techniques of in situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and voltammetry were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The data showed that the Au clusters raised the Pt oxidation potential, leading to the stabilization of the Pt surface against dissolution under potential cycling regimes. The high ORR activity of the Au clusters on the Pt/C electrocatalyst was counterintuitive, suggesting a high activity despite covering approximately one-third of the Pt sites. This activity could be attributed to the efficient spillover of H2O2 from the Au clusters to the surrounding Pt atoms, enabling further reduction to H2O, or the formation of AuOH at certain potentials, which might assist in reducing H2O2.

在原位近边吸收X射线光谱和伏安法的实验技术下，证实并量化了Ni和Co等3d原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面聚集现象。数据表明，Au簇提高了Pt的氧化电位，从而实现了对Pt催化剂在电化学循环条件下的稳定化作用。Au簇在Pt/C电催化剂上的高氧还原反应活性出乎意料，尽管覆盖了约三分之一的Pt位点。这种高活性可能归因于Au簇向周围Pt原子高效地转移H2O2，使进一步还原为H2O成为可能，或者在特定的电位下形成AuOH，这可能有助于减少H2O2。
