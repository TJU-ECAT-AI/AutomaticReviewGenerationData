The Au clusters were deposited on a Pt catalyst through a process called galvanic displacement, where Au replaces a Cu monolayer on the Pt surface. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the structure of the Au-modified Pt/C catalyst. Voltammetry helped determine the Pt surface area by measuring hydrogen adsorption before and after potential cycling. The stabilization effect of Au clusters on Pt is mainly due to the increased high Pt oxidation potential, leading to less extent of Pt oxidation. Table 1 summarizes the observed changes in surface area and catalytic activity data caused by potential cycling.

Au簇通过电位置换的过程沉积在铂催化剂上，即Au取代了Pt表面的Cu单层。高分辨率透射电子显微镜被用来检查Au修饰的Pt/C催化剂的结构。伏安法通过测量氢吸附前后Pt表面面积来确定Pt表面面积。Au簇对Pt的稳定作用主要由于Pt氧化潜能的提高，导致Pt氧化程度降低。表1总结了由电位循环引起的表面面积和催化活性数据的变化。
