[1] "These desorption experiments reveal that the 600 K deposited surface and the 300 K/600 K flash annealed surface of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) have similar properties, but the 300 K deposited surface is significantly different."
[2] "Furthermore, a recent DFT study from our group5,9 showed that the presence of subsurface Co or Ni in a Pt slab shifts the surface Pt d-band away from the Fermi level as compared to clean Pt(111)."
[3] "These calculations clearly show that incorporating subsurface Co or Ni into a Pt(111) substrate changes the electronic properties of the surface Pt d-band and the adsorption properties of hydrogen."
[4] "The calculated hydrogen binding energies also exhibit this similar trend, with the surfaces containing subsurface Ni or Co exhibiting HBEs weaker than that of Pt."

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES technique measures the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of these atoms. The HREELS technique identifies the presence of weakly π-bonded ethylene, confirming the reduction in the hydrogen peak area is due to a weaker interaction of molecularly adsorbed ethylene on the near monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface instead of a lower sticking coefficient. The DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations predict that the presence of subsurface Co or Ni shifts the surface Pt d-band away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker hydrogen binding energy and thus influencing the reaction pathways of molecules like hydrogen, ethylene, and cyclohexene on the bimetallic surfaces. These calculations align with the experimental observations on the novel reactivity of the Co/Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) surfaces.

实验技术如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和AES（Auger电子能谱）被用来验证和量化氧诱导的表面亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面扩散。AES技术测量这些原子的扩散动力学和活化势垒。HREELS技术可以识别弱π键化的乙烯的存在，这证实了氢峰面积减少的原因是分子吸附的乙烯与近单层Ni/Pt(111)表面之间较弱的相互作用，而不是较低的粘附系数。第一性原理计算预测，亚表面Co或Ni的存在使表面Pt d带远离费米能级，导致氢的结合能较弱，从而影响氢、乙烷和环己烯等分子在双金属表面上的反应途径。这些计算结果与Co/Pt(111)和Ni/Pt(111)表面的新型反应性的实验观察一致。
