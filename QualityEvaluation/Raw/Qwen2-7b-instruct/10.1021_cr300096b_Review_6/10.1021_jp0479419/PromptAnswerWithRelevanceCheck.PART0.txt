How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "These desorption experiments reveal that the 600 K deposited surface and the 300 K/600 K flash annealed surface of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) have similar properties, but the 300 K deposited surface is significantly different."
[2] "Furthermore, a recent DFT study from our group5,9 showed that the presence of subsurface Co or Ni in a Pt slab shifts the surface Pt d-band away from the Fermi level as compared to clean Pt(111)."
[3] "These calculations clearly show that incorporating subsurface Co or Ni into a Pt(111) substrate changes the electronic properties of the surface Pt d-band and the adsorption properties of hydrogen."
[4] "The calculated hydrogen binding energies also exhibit this similar trend, with the surfaces containing subsurface Ni or Co exhibiting HBEs weaker than that of Pt."

The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (such as Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES technique measures the segregation kinetics and activation barriers of these atoms. The HREELS technique identifies the presence of weakly π-bonded ethylene, confirming the reduction in the hydrogen peak area is due to a weaker interaction of molecularly adsorbed ethylene on the near monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface instead of a lower sticking coefficient. The DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations predict that the presence of subsurface Co or Ni shifts the surface Pt d-band away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker hydrogen binding energy and thus influencing the reaction pathways of molecules like hydrogen, ethylene, and cyclohexene on the bimetallic surfaces. These calculations align with the experimental observations on the novel reactivity of the Co/Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) surfaces.

实验技术如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和AES（Auger电子能谱）被用来验证和量化氧诱导的表面亚表面3d原子（如Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面扩散。AES技术测量这些原子的扩散动力学和活化势垒。HREELS技术可以识别弱π键化的乙烯的存在，这证实了氢峰面积减少的原因是分子吸附的乙烯与近单层Ni/Pt(111)表面之间较弱的相互作用，而不是较低的粘附系数。第一性原理计算预测，亚表面Co或Ni的存在使表面Pt d带远离费米能级，导致氢的结合能较弱，从而影响氢、乙烷和环己烯等分子在双金属表面上的反应途径。这些计算结果与Co/Pt(111)和Ni/Pt(111)表面的新型反应性的实验观察一致。

[1] "The ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber utilized for TPD and surface characterization is a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 1 × 10-10 Torr) equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and a mass spectrometer for temperature-programmed desorption experiments (TPD)."
[2] "The Co deposition was checked for uniformity on the Pt(111) surface using AES, which revealed that the surface contained less than 1% impurities (C or O) during Co deposition."
[3] "AES was used to characterize the Co/Pt(111) surfaces."
[4] "The calculated segregation energies of Co in Pt(111) indicate that Co atoms are more stable in the bulk of Pt(111) than on the surface."
[5] "The AES and TPD measurements were reproduced at least twice on all the surfaces."

The AES technique was used to analyze the presence and distribution of Co atoms in the Co/Pt(111) bimetallic system. AES measurements confirmed that the surface contained less than 1% impurities during Co deposition, indicating successful and uniform Co incorporation. The AES technique was also crucial in characterizing the Co/Pt(111) surfaces and determining the segregation energies of Co in Pt(111), which revealed that Co atoms are more stable in the bulk of Pt(111) rather than on its surface. Moreover, the AES and TPD measurements were replicated multiple times to ensure the reliability of the results.

AES技术被用来分析和确定Co/Pt(111)双金属体系中Co原子的存在和分布。AES测量结果显示，在Co沉积过程中，表面的杂质含量低于1%，这表明成功且均匀地实现了Co的掺入。AES技术对于表征Co/Pt(111)表面以及确定Co在Pt(111)中的分离能起到了关键作用，结果显示，Co原子在Pt(111)的内部比其表面更加稳定。此外，AES和TPD测量结果得到了重复验证至少两次，以确保结果的可靠性。

The experimental techniques of HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS identifies the presence of weakly π-bonded ethylene, indicating a weaker interaction of molecularly adsorbed ethylene on near monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surfaces instead of a lower sticking coefficient. AES characterizes the AES peaks and ratios as a function of time and deposition temperature, showing the formation of multilayers without well-defined layer-by-layer growth and the faster rate of Co sticking at 300 K compared to 600 K. The AES ratio increases at a faster rate at 300 K, suggesting either a higher sticking coefficient of Co or diffusion of Co atoms into the Pt(111) subsurface regions at 600 K. AES also reveals that the Co diffuses into Pt(111) at low temperatures, as indicated by the decrease in the Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ratio until it reaches approximately zero at 950 K. The DFT predictions demonstrate that the presence of subsurface Co or Ni modifies the electronic properties of the Pt(111) surface, shifting the d-band center away from the Fermi level, resulting in a weaker hydrogen binding energy.

实验技术HREELS和AES验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，特别是Ni和Co的氧诱导表面层析。HREELS确认了弱π键乙烯的存在，表明在接近单层Ni/Pt(111)表面上吸附的分子乙烯的较弱相互作用，而不是较低的粘附系数。AES通过测量沉积时间和温度函数中的AES峰值和比率来表征，显示形成多层而没有清晰的分层生长，并且在300 K时Co的粘附率比在600 K时快。AES比率在300 K时以更快的速度增加，这可能意味着Co的较高粘附系数或在600 K时Co原子扩散到Pt(111)亚表面区域。AES还揭示了Co在低温下扩散到Pt(111)，如Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV)比率降至约零时达到950 K所示。DFT预测显示，Subsurface Co或Ni的存在改变了Pt(111)表面的电子性质，将d带中心从费米能级移开，导致氢结合能较弱。
