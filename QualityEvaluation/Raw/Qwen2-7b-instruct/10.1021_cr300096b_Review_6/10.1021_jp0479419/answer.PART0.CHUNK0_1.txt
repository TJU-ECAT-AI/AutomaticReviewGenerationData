[1] "The ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber utilized for TPD and surface characterization is a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 1 × 10-10 Torr) equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and a mass spectrometer for temperature-programmed desorption experiments (TPD)."
[2] "The Co deposition was checked for uniformity on the Pt(111) surface using AES, which revealed that the surface contained less than 1% impurities (C or O) during Co deposition."
[3] "AES was used to characterize the Co/Pt(111) surfaces."
[4] "The calculated segregation energies of Co in Pt(111) indicate that Co atoms are more stable in the bulk of Pt(111) than on the surface."

The AES technique was used to analyze the presence and distribution of Co atoms in the Co/Pt(111) bimetallic system. AES measurements confirmed that the surface contained less than 1% impurities during Co deposition, indicating successful and uniform Co incorporation. The AES technique was also crucial in characterizing the Co/Pt(111) surfaces and determining the segregation energies of Co in Pt(111), which revealed that Co atoms are more stable in the bulk of Pt(111) rather than on its surface. Moreover, the AES and TPD measurements were replicated multiple times to ensure the reliability of the results.

AES技术被用来分析和确定Co/Pt(111)双金属体系中Co原子的存在和分布。AES测量结果显示，在Co沉积过程中，表面的杂质含量低于1%，这表明成功且均匀地实现了Co的掺入。AES技术对于表征Co/Pt(111)表面以及确定Co在Pt(111)中的分离能起到了关键作用，结果显示，Co原子在Pt(111)的内部比其表面更加稳定。此外，AES和TPD测量结果得到了重复验证至少两次，以确保结果的可靠性。
