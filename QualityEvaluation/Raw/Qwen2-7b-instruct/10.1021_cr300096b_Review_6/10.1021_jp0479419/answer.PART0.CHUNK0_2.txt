[1] "These desorption experiments reveal that the 600 K deposited surface and the 300 K/600 K flash annealed surface of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) have similar properties, but the 300 K deposited surface is significantly different."
[2] "These calculations clearly show that incorporating subsurface Co or Ni into a Pt(111) substrate changes the electronic properties of the surface Pt d-band and the adsorption properties of hydrogen."

The experimental techniques of HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. HREELS identifies the presence of weakly π-bonded ethylene, indicating a weaker interaction of molecularly adsorbed ethylene on near monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surfaces instead of a lower sticking coefficient. AES characterizes the AES peaks and ratios as a function of time and deposition temperature, showing the formation of multilayers without well-defined layer-by-layer growth and the faster rate of Co sticking at 300 K compared to 600 K. The AES ratio increases at a faster rate at 300 K, suggesting either a higher sticking coefficient of Co or diffusion of Co atoms into the Pt(111) subsurface regions at 600 K. AES also reveals that the Co diffuses into Pt(111) at low temperatures, as indicated by the decrease in the Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ratio until it reaches approximately zero at 950 K. The DFT predictions demonstrate that the presence of subsurface Co or Ni modifies the electronic properties of the Pt(111) surface, shifting the d-band center away from the Fermi level, resulting in a weaker hydrogen binding energy.

实验技术HREELS和AES验证并量化了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中，特别是Ni和Co的氧诱导表面层析。HREELS确认了弱π键乙烯的存在，表明在接近单层Ni/Pt(111)表面上吸附的分子乙烯的较弱相互作用，而不是较低的粘附系数。AES通过测量沉积时间和温度函数中的AES峰值和比率来表征，显示形成多层而没有清晰的分层生长，并且在300 K时Co的粘附率比在600 K时快。AES比率在300 K时以更快的速度增加，这可能意味着Co的较高粘附系数或在600 K时Co原子扩散到Pt(111)亚表面区域。AES还揭示了Co在低温下扩散到Pt(111)，如Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV)比率降至约零时达到950 K所示。DFT预测显示，Subsurface Co或Ni的存在改变了Pt(111)表面的电子性质，将d带中心从费米能级移开，导致氢结合能较弱。
