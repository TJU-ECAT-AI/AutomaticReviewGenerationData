Experimental techniques such as High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) were employed to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The kinetics of this segregation process and the activation barriers were experimentally measured and then compared with predictions made through Density Functional Theory (DFT).
