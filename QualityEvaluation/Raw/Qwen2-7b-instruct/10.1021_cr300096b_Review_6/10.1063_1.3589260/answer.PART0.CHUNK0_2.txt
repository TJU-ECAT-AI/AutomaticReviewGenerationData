The document does not provide specific details on how experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, nor does it compare the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions.
