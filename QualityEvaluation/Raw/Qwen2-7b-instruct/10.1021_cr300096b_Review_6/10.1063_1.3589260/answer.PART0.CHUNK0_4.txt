The document does not provide specific details on how experimental techniques such as HREELS (High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. It also does not compare the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions for these systems.

文档没有提供关于如何使用实验技术（例如HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子能谱））验证并量化由氧气引起的表面亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中的表面分层的具体细节。它也没有比较测量的分层动力学和活化势垒与DFT（密度泛函理论）预测的系统。
