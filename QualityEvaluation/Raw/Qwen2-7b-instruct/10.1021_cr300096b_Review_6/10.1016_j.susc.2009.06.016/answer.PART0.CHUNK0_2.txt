<p>For single crystal Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, there are two well characterized bimetallic surface structures as confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) [16] . When Ni is deposited onto Pt(111) at room temperature Ni grows in a layer-by-layer manner, leading to the formation of the surface monolayer structure, which is designated as NiPtPt(111). Either depositing a monolayer of Ni onto Pt(111) at 600 K or annealing the NiPtPt(111) surface to 600 K creates a subsurface monolayer structure due to thermally-induced diffusion of Ni atoms into the second atomic layer, which is designated as PtNiPt(111).</p>
<p>The Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces display chemical properties that are different from both Ni(111) and Pt(111). For example, density functional theory (DFT) modeling indicates that the binding energies of CH3OH and methoxy (CH3O) decrease significantly on PtNiPt(111) as compared to Pt(111) or Ni(111), while the binding energies on NiPtPt(111) are greater than on either of the parent metal surfaces [13] .</p>
<p>Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) confirmed that two distinct bimetallic configurations can be formed for the Ni/Pt system, each possessing unique chemical properties: one with the surface enriched in Ni atoms, designated NiPtPt, and the other with the subsurface region enriched in Ni atoms, designated PtNiPt.</p>
<p>For the same reason, the PtNiPt surface showed higher activity toward decomposition than that on PtNiPt(111) [13] .</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 3, in addition to the reduction of features related to methoxy due to heating to 300 K, a relatively weak feature is observed at 1583 cm1, which can be tentatively assigned to a di-σ bonded CO species from an aldehyde-like intermediate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the reforming activities of oxygenates ( Table 1 , Table 3 ) on subsurface PtNiPt are higher than Pt, which is the opposite of the trend between PtNiPt(111) and Pt(111). This difference is most likely related to the incomplete diffusion of surface Ni into the subsurface region on polycrystalline Pt, leaving portions of the bimetallic surface with more active NiPtPt structures.</p>

The AES technique confirms the formation of two bimetallic configurations in the Ni/Pt system: NiPtPt, with surface enrichment of Ni atoms, and PtNiPt, with subsurface enrichment of Ni atoms. The PtNiPt configuration displays higher activity than the PtNiPt(111) counterpart, possibly due to incomplete diffusion of surface Ni into the subsurface region on polycrystalline Pt, leading to more active NiPtPt structures. DFT modeling shows that the binding energies of oxygenates and their intermediates vary across the different bimetallic configurations.

AES技术证实了Ni/Pt系统中形成两种双金属配置：表面Ni原子富集的NiPtPt和次表面Ni原子富集的PtNiPt。PtNiPt配置的活性高于PtNiPt(111)的对应配置，这可能是因为在多晶Pt上表面Ni的不完全扩散到次表面区域，导致更多的活性NiPtPt结构。DFT建模显示了氧气化合物及其中间体在不同双金属配置中的结合能存在差异。
