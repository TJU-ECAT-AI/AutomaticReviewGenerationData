<p>For single crystal Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, there are two well characterized bimetallic surface structures as confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) [16]. When Ni is deposited onto Pt(111) at room temperature Ni grows in a layer-by-layer manner, leading to the formation of the surface monolayer structure, which is designated as NiPtPt(111). Either depositing a monolayer of Ni onto Pt(111) at 600 K or annealing the NiPtPt(111) surface to 600 K creates a subsurface monolayer structure due to thermally-induced diffusion of Ni atoms into the second atomic layer, which is designated as PtNiPt(111).</p>
<p>The Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces display chemical properties that are different from both Ni(111) and Pt(111). For example, density functional theory (DFT) modeling indicates that the binding energies of CH3OH and methoxy (CH3O) decrease significantly on PtNiPt(111) as compared to Pt(111) or Ni(111), while the binding energies on NiPtPt(111) are greater than on either of the parent metal surfaces [13]. Such trends have also been observed for the adsorption of ethylene glycol (C2H4(OH)2). The binding energies of C2H4(OH)2, HOC2H4O and OC2H4O have been shown to follow the trend of PtNiPt(111) < Pt(111) < NiPtPt(111), leading to higher reforming activities on the latter surface [18]. The difference in binding energies can be attributed to changes in the d-band density of states [19], [20].</p>
<p>When comparing the polycrystalline Pt surface with the bimetallic surfaces, the authors found that the reforming activities follow the trend of NiPtPt >> PtNiPt > Pt. The increased activity on polycrystalline NiPtPt is likely due to strong adsorbate binding energies resulting from a shift in the Fermi level toward the d-band center, as compared to Pt. Additionally, the strong bonding on NiPtPt facilitates CC bond cleavage, resulting in increased methanation activity of C2H4(OH)2 on NiPtPt as compared to PtNiPt or clean Pt.</p>
<p>Regarding the experimental techniques, HREELS and AES were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES confirmed that two distinct bimetallic configurations can be formed for the Ni/Pt system, each possessing unique chemical properties: one with the surface enriched in Ni atoms, designated NiPtPt, and the other with the subsurface region enriched in Ni atoms, designated PtNiPt. HREELS results suggested that OH bond scission is probably the first step in the decomposition for both oxygenates on polycrystalline Pt, PtNiPt, and NiPtPt surfaces.</p>

The experimental techniques HREELS and AES were employed to confirm and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES demonstrated that two unique bimetallic configurations exist for the Ni/Pt system: one with surface-enriched Ni atoms, denoted as NiPtPt, and another with a subsurface region enriched in Ni atoms, denoted as PtNiPt. HREELS findings indicated that OH bond scission likely initiates the decomposition process for both oxygenates on polycrystalline Pt, PtNiPt, and NiPtPt surfaces.

The polycrystalline NiPtPt surface exhibited higher reforming activities compared to PtNiPt and Pt surfaces. This enhancement is attributed to a shift in the Fermi level towards the d-band center, resulting in stronger adsorbate binding energies. Moreover, the robust bonding on NiPtPt enables the cleavage of CC bonds, leading to increased methanation activity of C2H4(OH)2 on NiPtPt relative to PtNiPt or clean Pt.

实验技术HREELS和AES被用于验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面迁移。AES表明，Ni/Pt系统中存在两种独特的双金属配置：一种是表面Ni原子富集的配置，标记为NiPtPt；另一种是亚表面区域Ni原子富集的配置，标记为PtNiPt。HREELS结果表明，在多晶Pt、PtNiPt和NiPtPt表面上，OH键断裂可能是氧气分解过程的第一步。

与PtNiPt和纯Pt相比，多晶NiPtPt表面的重整活性更高。这种增强归因于费米能级向d带中心移动，导致更强的吸附剂结合能。此外，NiPtPt上的牢固结合能够使CC键断裂，从而增加C2H4(OH)2在NiPtPt上的甲烷化活性。
