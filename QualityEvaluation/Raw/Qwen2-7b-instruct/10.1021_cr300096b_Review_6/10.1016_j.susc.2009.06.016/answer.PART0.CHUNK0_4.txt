[3] "Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) confirmed that two distinct bimetallic configurations can be formed for the Ni/Pt system, each possessing unique chemical properties: one with the surface enriched in Ni atoms, designated NiPtPt, and the other with the subsurface region enriched in Ni atoms, designated PtNiPt."
[4] "Consistent with single crystal studies, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) revealed that the NiPtPt configuration was more active for reforming to CO and H2 than either polycrystalline Pt or PtNiPt."

Answer: 
The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES confirmed the formation of two distinct bimetallic configurations for the Ni/Pt system, each with unique chemical properties. One configuration, designated NiPtPt, had the surface enriched in Ni atoms, while the other, designated PtNiPt, had the subsurface region enriched in Ni atoms. HREELS confirmed the presence of strongly bound reaction intermediates on the NiPtPt configuration, including aldehyde-like species. This indicates that the surface segregation of Ni atoms plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity for the reforming of oxygenates on the NiPtPt configuration, which is consistent with the findings on single crystal surfaces.

实验技术，如HREELS和AES，用于验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面分层。AES证实了Ni/Pt系统可以形成两种不同的双金属配置，每种配置都具有独特的化学性质：一种表面富含Ni原子，标记为NiPtPt；另一种是亚表面区域富含Ni原子，标记为PtNiPt。HREELS证实了NiPtPt配置上存在强键合反应中间体，包括醛类物种。这表明Ni原子的表面分层对于增强NiPtPt配置下的氧化物重整活性至关重要，这与单晶表面的研究结果一致。
