Either depositing a monolayer of Ni onto Pt(111) at 600 K or annealing the NiPtPt(111) surface to 600 K creates a subsurface monolayer structure due to thermally-induced diffusion of Ni atoms into the second atomic layer, which is designated as PtNiPt(111)."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES confirm the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES reveals the formation of two distinct bimetallic configurations: NiPtPt, with the surface enriched in Ni atoms, and PtNiPt, with the subsurface region enriched in Ni atoms. HREELS studies provide complementary information on the reaction intermediates for CH3OH and C2H4(OH)2 decomposition. The TPD results show that the binding energies of oxygenates and reaction intermediates play crucial roles in controlling the initial decomposition processes on these surfaces. The subsurface PtNiPt configuration exhibits higher reforming activities for CH3OH and C2H4(OH)2 compared to the surface Pt, demonstrating differences from single crystal surfaces.

实验技术如HREELS和AES证实了在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导表面分层的3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的存在。AES显示了两种不同的双金属配置：NiPtPt，其表面富集有Ni原子；以及PtNiPt，其次表层区域富集有Ni原子。HREELS研究提供了CH3OH和C2H4(OH)2分解反应中间体的补充信息。TPD结果表明氧化物和反应中间体的结合能对于控制这些表面上的初始分解过程起着关键作用。与单晶表面相比，次表面PtNiPt配置表现出更高的CH3OH和C2H4(OH)2重整活性，显示出差异。
