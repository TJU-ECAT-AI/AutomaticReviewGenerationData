[1] "For single crystal Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, there are two well characterized bimetallic surface structures as confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) [16] ."
[2] "When Ni is deposited onto Pt(111) at room temperature Ni grows in a layer-by-layer manner, leading to the formation of the surface monolayer structure, which is designated as NiPtPt(111). Either depositing a monolayer of Ni onto Pt(111) at 600 K or annealing the NiPtPt(111) surface to 600 K creates a subsurface monolayer structure due to thermally-induced diffusion of Ni atoms into the second atomic layer, which is designated as PtNiPt(111)."

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES confirm the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES reveals the formation of two distinct bimetallic configurations: NiPtPt, with the surface enriched in Ni atoms, and PtNiPt, with the subsurface region enriched in Ni atoms. HREELS studies provide complementary information on the reaction intermediates for CH3OH and C2H4(OH)2 decomposition. The TPD results show that the binding energies of oxygenates and reaction intermediates play crucial roles in controlling the initial decomposition processes on these surfaces.

The study evaluated whether the favorable chemistry observed on single crystal Ni/Pt(111) surfaces could be extended to more commercially relevant polycrystalline surfaces for oxygenate reforming, thus bridging the materials gap. Two bimetallic configurations, NiPtPt and PtNiPt, were identified on the Ni/Pt system, each with distinct chemical properties. The NiPtPt configuration demonstrated higher activity for reforming methanol and ethylene glycol to CO and H2 compared to polycrystalline Pt or PtNiPt. Strongly bound reaction intermediates, including aldehyde-like species, were observed on NiPtPt, similar to findings on NiPtPt(111).

<p>The Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces display chemical properties that are different from both Ni(111) and Pt(111).

<p>For the same reason, the PtNiPt surface showed higher activity toward decomposition than that on PtNiPt(111) [13] .</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 3, in addition to the reduction of features related to methoxy due to heating to 300 K, a relatively weak feature is observed at 1583 cm1, which can be tentatively assigned to a di-σ bonded CO species from an aldehyde-like intermediate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the reforming activities of oxygenates ( Table 1 , Table 3 ) on subsurface PtNiPt are higher than Pt, which is the opposite of the trend between PtNiPt(111) and Pt(111).

The AES technique confirms the formation of two bimetallic configurations in the Ni/Pt system: NiPtPt, with surface enrichment of Ni atoms, and PtNiPt, with subsurface enrichment of Ni atoms. The PtNiPt configuration displays higher activity than the PtNiPt(111) counterpart, possibly due to incomplete diffusion of surface Ni into the subsurface region on polycrystalline Pt, leading to more active NiPtPt structures. DFT modeling shows that the binding energies of oxygenates and their intermediates vary across the different bimetallic configurations.

Such trends have also been observed for the adsorption of ethylene glycol (C2H4(OH)2). The binding energies of C2H4(OH)2, HOC2H4O and OC2H4O have been shown to follow the trend of PtNiPt(111) < Pt(111) < NiPtPt(111), leading to higher reforming activities on the latter surface [18]. The difference in binding energies can be attributed to changes in the d-band density of states [19], [20].</p>
<p>When comparing the polycrystalline Pt surface with the bimetallic surfaces, the authors found that the reforming activities follow the trend of NiPtPt >> PtNiPt > Pt. The increased activity on polycrystalline NiPtPt is likely due to strong adsorbate binding energies resulting from a shift in the Fermi level toward the d-band center, as compared to Pt. Additionally, the strong bonding on NiPtPt facilitates CC bond cleavage, resulting in increased methanation activity of C2H4(OH)2 on NiPtPt as compared to PtNiPt or clean Pt.</p>

The experimental techniques HREELS and AES were employed to confirm and measure the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES demonstrated that two unique bimetallic configurations exist for the Ni/Pt system: one with surface-enriched Ni atoms, denoted as NiPtPt, and another with a subsurface region enriched in Ni atoms, denoted as PtNiPt. HREELS findings indicated that OH bond scission likely initiates the decomposition process for both oxygenates on polycrystalline Pt, PtNiPt, and NiPtPt surfaces.

The polycrystalline NiPtPt surface exhibited higher reforming activities compared to PtNiPt and Pt surfaces. This enhancement is attributed to a shift in the Fermi level towards the d-band center, resulting in stronger adsorbate binding energies. Moreover, the robust bonding on NiPtPt enables the cleavage of CC bonds, leading to increased methanation activity of C2H4(OH)2 on NiPtPt relative to PtNiPt or clean Pt.

实验技术HREELS和AES被用于验证并量化在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中由氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）的表面迁移。AES表明，Ni/Pt系统中存在两种独特的双金属配置：一种是表面Ni原子富集的配置，标记为NiPtPt；另一种是亚表面区域Ni原子富集的配置，标记为PtNiPt。HREELS结果表明，在多晶Pt、PtNiPt和NiPtPt表面上，OH键断裂可能是氧气分解过程的第一步。

与PtNiPt和纯Pt相比，多晶NiPtPt表面的重整活性更高。这种增强归因于费米能级向d带中心移动，导致更强的吸附剂结合能。此外，NiPtPt上的牢固结合能够使CC键断裂，从而增加C2H4(OH)2在NiPtPt上的甲烷化活性。

Answer: 
The experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (specifically Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. AES confirmed the formation of two distinct bimetallic configurations for the Ni/Pt system, each with unique chemical properties. One configuration, designated NiPtPt, had the surface enriched in Ni atoms, while the other, designated PtNiPt, had the subsurface region enriched in Ni atoms. HREELS confirmed the presence of strongly bound reaction intermediates on the NiPtPt configuration, including aldehyde-like species. This indicates that the surface segregation of Ni atoms plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity for the reforming of oxygenates on the NiPtPt configuration, which is consistent with the findings on single crystal surfaces.
