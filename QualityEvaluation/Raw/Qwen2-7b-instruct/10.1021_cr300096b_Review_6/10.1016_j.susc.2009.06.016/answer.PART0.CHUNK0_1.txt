The study evaluated whether the favorable chemistry observed on single crystal Ni/Pt(111) surfaces could be extended to more commercially relevant polycrystalline surfaces for oxygenate reforming, thus bridging the materials gap. Two bimetallic configurations, NiPtPt and PtNiPt, were identified on the Ni/Pt system, each with distinct chemical properties. The NiPtPt configuration demonstrated higher activity for reforming methanol and ethylene glycol to CO and H2 compared to polycrystalline Pt or PtNiPt. Strongly bound reaction intermediates, including aldehyde-like species, were observed on NiPtPt, similar to findings on NiPtPt(111). The TPD and HREELS results on polycrystalline surfaces matched those of their single crystal counterparts for oxygenate reforming. The reforming activities showed a clear trend of NiPtPt >> PtNiPt > Pt.

研究评估了单晶Ni/Pt(111)表面观察到的有利化学反应是否可以扩展到更具有商业相关性的多晶表面，以实现氧基重整，从而跨越材料差距。在Ni/Pt系统中识别了两种二金属配置，NiPtPt和PtNiPt，它们各自具有独特的化学性质。NiPtPt配置在将甲醇和乙二醇重整为CO和H2方面的活性高于多晶Pt或PtNiPt。在NiPtPt上观察到了强键合反应中间体，包括醛类物种，类似于在NiPtPt(111)上的发现。多晶表面上的TPD和HREELS结果与单晶对应物的结果相匹配，用于氧基重整。重整活性显示了NiPtPt >> PtNiPt > Pt的清晰趋势。
