[1] "An Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) pillared montmorillonite was used to support 1.0 wt.% of the bimetallic species Pd/Pt=5.0 and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r."
[2] "The resulting catalysts were characterized by XRPD, N2 physisorption, ammonia TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy."
[3] "The catalytic activity in the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening of naphthalene and thio-tolerance to dibenzothiophene were investigated at 6.0 MPa in a flow reactor."
[4] "Both catalysts showed interesting performances."
[5] "Of the two catalysts, the former showed higher productivities in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening compounds together with lower losses in carbon balance and higher thio-tolerance."
[6] "These results not only confirmed that Pd/Pt is one of the most suitable bimetallic pair for noble metal containing hydrotreating catalysts, but also that the Al/Ce/Mg PILC can be used as low cost support for noble-metal-containing active phases."

The Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 atomic ratio pillared montmorillonite was used to support 1.0 wt.% of the bimetallic species Pd/Pt=5.0 and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. The catalysts were characterized using XRPD, N2 physisorption, ammonia TPD, and FT-IR spectroscopy. The catalysts demonstrated performance in the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening of naphthalene, as well as thio-tolerance to dibenzothiophene. The catalyst with the Pd/Pt bimetallic species showed higher productivity, better carbon balance retention, and higher thio-tolerance compared to the other catalyst. The results confirmed that Pd/Pt is a suitable bimetallic pair for noble metal-containing hydrotreating catalysts, and that the Al/Ce/Mg PILC can serve as a cost-effective support for noble-metal-containing active phases.

使用Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0原子比的层状粘土插片，用于支持1.0 wt.%的双金属物种Pd/Pt=5.0和Pd/Au=5.0 a.r.。催化剂通过XRPD、N2物理吸附、氨TPD和FT-IR光谱进行表征。催化剂在氢化和氢解/环开naphthalene以及二苯并噻吩的耐硫性方面表现出性能。具有Pd/Pt双金属物种的催化剂显示出更高的生产率、更好的碳平衡保留和更高的耐硫性。结果确认了Pd/Pt是适用于贵金属催化加氢脱硫的最合适的双金属组合，并且Al/Ce/Mg插片层状粘土可以作为贵金属活性相的低成本支撑材料。
