[1] "An Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) pillared montmorillonite was used to support 1.0 wt.% of the bimetallic species Pd/Pt=5.0 and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r."
[2] "Both catalysts showed interesting performances."
[3] "These results not only confirmed that Pd/Pt is one of the most suitable bimetallic pair for noble metal containing hydrotreating catalysts, but also that the Al/Ce/Mg PILC can be used as low cost support for noble-metal-containing active phases."

The Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 atomic ratio pillared montmorillonite was used to support 1.0 wt.% of the bimetallic species Pd/Pt=5.0 and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r., leading to catalysts that showed interesting performances. These results confirmed that Pd/Pt is one of the most suitable bimetallic pairs for noble metal containing hydrotreating catalysts and demonstrated that the Al/Ce/Mg PILC can serve as a low-cost support for noble-metal-containing active phases.

使用了Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0原子比的层间插入蒙脱石，用于支持1.0 wt.%的双金属物种Pd/Pt=5.0和Pd/Au=5.0 a.r。这两款催化剂表现出有趣的性能。这些结果证实了Pd/Pt是贵金属催化加氢处理催化剂中最合适的双金属组合之一，并且证明了Al/Ce/Mg层间插入蒙脱石可以作为贵金属活性相的低成本支撑体。
