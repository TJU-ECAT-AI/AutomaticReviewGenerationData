Noble metal containing Al/Ce/Mg pillared montmorillonite clay as catalysts in the hydrotreating of LCO fractions

An Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) pillared montmorillonite was used to support 1.0 wt.% of the bimetallic species Pd/Pt=5.0 and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. The resulting catalysts were characterized by XRPD, N2 physisorption, ammonia TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy. The catalytic activity in the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening of naphthalene and thio-tolerance to dibenzothiophene were investigated at 6.0 MPa in a flow reactor. Both catalysts showed interesting performances.
Of the two catalysts, the former showed higher productivities in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening compounds together with lower losses in carbon balance and higher thio-tolerance. These results not only confirmed that Pd/Pt is one of the most suitable bimetallic pair for noble metal containing hydrotreating catalysts, but also that the Al/Ce/Mg PILC can be used as low cost support for noble-metal-containing active phases.

The study demonstrated that a specific type of pillared layered clay, with an Al/Ce/Mg atomic ratio of 50.0/1.0/1.0, could effectively support noble metals like Pd, Pt, and Au for use in hydrotreating processes. The catalysts showed promising performance in hydrogenating and hydrogenolyzing/naphthalene ring-opening reactions, with particular advantages in terms of product yield, carbon balance conservation, and sulfur tolerance. The results suggested that Pd/Pt is an optimal bimetallic combination for these types of catalysts and that the Al/Ce/Mg pillared clay offers a cost-effective support for noble metal-based active phases.
