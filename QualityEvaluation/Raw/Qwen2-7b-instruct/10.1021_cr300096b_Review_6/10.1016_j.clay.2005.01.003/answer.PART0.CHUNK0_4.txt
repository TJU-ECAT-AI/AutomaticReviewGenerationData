[1] "An Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) pillared montmorillonite was used to support 1.0 wt.% of the bimetallic species Pd/Pt=5.0 and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r."
[2] "Both catalysts showed interesting performances."
[3] "These results not only confirmed that Pd/Pt is one of the most suitable bimetallic pair for noble metal containing hydrotreating catalysts, but also that the Al/Ce/Mg PILC can be used as low cost support for noble-metal-containing active phases."

The Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 atomic ratio pillared montmorillonite was utilized to support 1.0 wt.% of the bimetallic species Pd/Pt=5.0 and Pd/Au=5.0. Both catalysts demonstrated notable performance, confirming that Pd/Pt is an ideal bimetallic combination for noble metal-containing hydrotreating catalysts, and showcasing the Al/Ce/Mg PILC's capability as an affordable support for noble metal-containing active phases.
