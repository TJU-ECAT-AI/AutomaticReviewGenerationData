[1] "An Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) pillared montmorillonite was used to support 1.0 wt.% of the bimetallic species Pd/Pt=5.0 and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. The resulting catalysts were characterized by XRPD, N2 physisorption, ammonia TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy."
[2] "The catalysts showed interesting performances."
[3] "Both catalysts showed higher productivities in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening compounds together with lower losses in carbon balance and higher thio-tolerance."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
These catalysts were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. They demonstrated notable performance in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening reactions, with higher productivity, lower carbon loss, and enhanced thio-tolerance.
