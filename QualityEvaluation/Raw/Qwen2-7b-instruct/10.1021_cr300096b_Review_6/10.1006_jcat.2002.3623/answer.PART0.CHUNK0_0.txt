1. The metallic mole fraction of Pt in bimetallic PtFe/SiO2 catalysts varied from 0.04 to 0.64, while the estimated surface composition in the bimetallic particles ranged from 0.39 to 0.70.
2. Adding small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 catalysts increased Fe reducibility during the reduction pretreatment and enhanced activity more than 10-fold and turnover frequencies 10- to 100-fold.
3. As the metal particle size increases, the surface/volume ratio decreases, making it hard to accurately determine the contribution from the surface iron atoms to the Mossbauer spectrum.
4. Based on the measurement, the minimum number of surface Pt atoms in the catalyst was 16.6 mol Pts/gcat.
5. Increasing the acetic acid partial pressure increased acetaldehyde selectivity due to a decrease in the surface coverage of acetaldehyde caused by competition with acetic acid for active sites.
6. An enhancement in TOF relative to Fe is clearly seen with all of the PtFe/SiO2 catalysts except 0.7Pt0.1Fe/SiO2, and all TOF values for reduction are higher than that on Pt/SiO2, which exhibited primarily decomposition activity.
7. Surface species were examined using DRIFTS to further investigate the role of PtFe crystallites in acetic acid reduction.
8. The addition of Pt to an Fe/C catalyst prevented severe deactivation associated with iron carbide formation.
9. The reaction model correlates the experimental data satisfactorily, and the enthalpy and entropy of adsorption for acetic acid and hydrogen on Pt obtained from the fitted parameters are thermodynamically consistent, meeting additional constraints and guidelines.

1. 在双金属PtFe/SiO2催化剂中，Pt的金属摩尔分数从0.04到0.64变化，而估计的表面组成在双金属颗粒中从0.39到0.70变化。
2. 向Fe/SiO2催化剂中添加少量Pt提高了Fe在还原预处理过程中的可还原性，并使活性增加了10倍以上和转速频率增加了10到100倍。
3. 随着金属粒子尺寸的增加，表面积/体积比降低，使得准确确定表面铁原子对Mossbauer谱的贡献变得困难。
4. 根据测量结果，催化剂中的最小表面Pt原子数为16.6 mol Pts/gcat。
5. 增加乙酸分压提高了乙醛选择性，因为乙酸的表面覆盖率由于与活性位点的竞争而下降。
6. 所有PtFe/SiO2催化剂除了0.7Pt0.1Fe/SiO2外，相对Fe的TOF均有显著提高，且所有还原TOF值均高于仅含Pt的催化剂，后者主要表现为分解反应。
7. 使用DRIFTS进一步研究了PtFe晶粒在乙酸还原中的作用，检查了乙酸吸附后表面物种的存在。
8. 向Fe/C催化剂中添加Pt防止了与铁碳化物形成相关的严重失活。
9. 反应模型能够很好地与实验数据相匹配，从拟合参数获得的乙酸和氢在Pt上的吸附焓和熵是热力学一致的，符合额外的约束条件和指南。
