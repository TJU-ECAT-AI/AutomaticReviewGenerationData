[1] "The addition of Pt to Fe to form bimetallic PtFe particles increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pre-treatment, enhanced activity, eliminated the induction period, lowered the apparent activation energy, and yet maintained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, particularly with catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios."
[2] "The addition of small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 catalysts (i) increased Fe reducibility during the reduction pretreatment,(ii) enhanced activity more than 10-fold and turnover frequencies 10- to 100-fold, (iii) eliminated the induction period, (iv) lowered the apparent activation energy by 810 kcal/mol, and (v) still maintained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde of over 70%."
[3] "Under reaction conditions, the best bimetallic catalyst contained both Fe0 and Fe2+ phases, which is a combination that seems to be required for stable selective acetaldehyde formation."

The addition of platinum (Pt) to iron (Fe) catalysts significantly enhances their performance in acetic acid reduction by hydrogen. This improvement includes increased reducibility of iron during the pretreatment, remarkable enhancement in activity, elimination of the induction period, reduction of the apparent activation energy, and maintenance of high selectivity towards acetaldehyde, especially in catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios. The best-performing bimetallic catalyst features both metallic iron (Fe0) and iron oxide (Fe2+) phases, a combination that facilitates stable and selective acetaldehyde formation.

向铁催化剂中添加铂（Pt）能显著提高其在乙酸氢化反应中的性能。这种改善包括铁在预处理过程中的增强可还原性，活性的巨大提升，诱导期的消除，显热活化能的降低，以及维持高乙醛选择性，尤其是在低Pt/Fe比例催化剂中的表现。表现最佳的双金属催化剂含有纯铁（Fe0）和铁氧化物（Fe2+）两种相态，这种组合能够促进稳定而选择性的乙醛生成。
