[1] "The addition of Pt to Fe to form bimetallic PtFe particles increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pre-treatment, enhanced activity, eliminated the induction period, lowered the apparent activation energy, and yet maintained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, particularly with catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios."
[2] "The addition of small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 catalysts (i) increased Fe reducibility during the reduction pretreatment,(ii) enhanced activity more than 10-fold and turnover frequencies 10- to 100-fold, (iii) eliminated the induction period, (iv) lowered the apparent activation energy by 810 kcal/mol, and (v) still maintained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde of over 70%."
[3] "Under reaction conditions, the best bimetallic catalyst contained both Fe0 and Fe2+ phases, which is a combination that seems to be required for stable selective acetaldehyde formation."
[4] "The kinetic behavior of these PtFe systems has many similarities to that of TiO2-supported Pt, as evidenced by a comparison of specific activities, apparent activation energies, and activity maintenance behavior."
[5] "The addition of Pt to an Fe/C catalyst prevented the severe deactivation that has been associated with iron carbide formation."

1. The addition of platinum (Pt) to iron (Fe) to create bimetallic PtFe particles improved the reducibility of iron during the pretreatment process, boosted activity, removed the induction period, reduced the apparent activation energy, and maintained a high selectivity towards acetaldehyde, especially in catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios.

2. Adding small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 catalysts increased the reducibility of Fe during pretreatment, enhanced activity by more than 10 times and turnover frequencies by 10 to 100 times, eliminated the induction period, lowered the apparent activation energy by 810 kcal/mol, and still kept a high selectivity towards acetaldehyde over 70%.

3. Under reaction conditions, the optimal bimetallic catalyst contained both metallic Fe (Fe0) and oxidized Fe (Fe2+) phases, a combination that appears to be essential for stable and selective acetaldehyde formation.

4. The kinetic behavior of these PtFe systems closely resembled that of Pt/TiO2 catalysts, as evidenced by similar specific activities, apparent activation energies, and activity maintenance patterns.

5. The addition of Pt to an Fe/C catalyst prevented the severe deactivation typically linked to iron carbide formation.

1. 添加铂（Pt）到铁（Fe）以形成双金属PtFe粒子，提高了铁在预处理过程中的可还原性，增强了活性，消除了诱导期，降低了显热激活能，并保持了高乙醛选择性，尤其是在低Pt/Fe比催化剂中。

2. 在Fe/SiO2催化剂中添加少量Pt增加了Fe的还原性，在预处理过程中，提高了活性超过10倍和周转频率10至100倍，消除了诱导期，降低了显热激活能810 kcal/mol，并且仍保持了超过70%的乙醛选择性。

3. 在反应条件下，最佳双金属催化剂含有金属Fe（Fe0）和氧化Fe（Fe2+）相，这种组合似乎是稳定选择性乙醛形成所必需的。

4. 这些PtFe系统的动力学行为与TiO2支持的Pt催化剂相似，通过特定活性、显热激活能和活性维持行为的比较得到证实。

5. 在Fe/C催化剂中添加Pt防止了与铁碳化物形成相关的严重失活。
