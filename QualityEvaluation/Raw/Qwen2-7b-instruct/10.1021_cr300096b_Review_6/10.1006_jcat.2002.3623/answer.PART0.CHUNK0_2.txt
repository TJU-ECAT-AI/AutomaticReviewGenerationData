1. The metallic mole fraction of Pt in the bimetallic PtFe/SiO2 catalysts varied from 0.04 to 0.64, while the estimated surface composition of the bimetallic particles ranged from 0.39 to 0.70.
2. Adding small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 catalysts increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pretreatment, enhanced activity by more than 10-fold, lowered the turnover frequencies by 10- to 100-fold, eliminated the induction period, reduced the apparent activation energy by 810 kcal/mol, and maintained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde of over 70%.
3. A model was proposed that described the titration results and allowed for the estimation of the number of surface Pt and Fe atoms in the bimetallic particles dispersed on SiO2.
4. The addition of Pt to Fe led to increased reducibility of iron during pretreatment, enhanced activity, elimination of the induction period, reduction of the apparent activation energy, and maintenance of high selectivity to acetaldehyde, especially in catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios.
5. It was proposed that acetic acid reduction with H2 over bimetallic PtFe catalysts proceeds through a rate-determining surface reaction between a hydrogen atom and surface acyl species. The kinetics of this process can be described by a rate expression derived from a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type model that involves hydrogen dissociation on Pt sites and acetic acid adsorption and activation on an FeO phase to generate the surface acyl species.

1. 在双金属PtFe/SiO2催化剂中，Pt的金属摩尔分数从0.04变化到0.64，而估计的双金属粒子表面组成范围在0.39至0.70之间。
2. 向Fe/SiO2催化剂中添加少量Pt增加了铁的还原性，在预处理过程中，提高了活性超过10倍，降低了转速频率10到100倍，消除了诱导期，降低了显着的活化能810 kcal/mol，并且保持了超过70%的高乙醛选择性。
3. 提出了一种模型，该模型描述了滴定结果并允许对分散在SiO2上的双金属粒子表面上的Pt和Fe原子数量进行估算。
4. 向Fe中添加Pt导致铁在预处理过程中的可还原性增加，活性增强，消除了诱导期，降低了显着的活化能，且在Pt/Fe比低的催化剂中保持了高乙醛选择性。
5. 提出，在双金属PtFe催化剂上通过H2进行乙酸还原通过氢原子与表面酰基物种之间的速率决定性表面反应进行。该过程的速率可以通过Langmuir-Hinshelwood型模型推导出的速率表达式来描述，该模型涉及在Pt位点上的氢解离和在FeO相上乙酸吸附和激活以生成表面酰基物种。
