4. Based on the measurement, the minimum number of surface Pt atoms in the catalyst was 16.6 mol Pts/gcat.
5. Increasing the acetic acid partial pressure increased acetaldehyde selectivity due to a decrease in the surface coverage of acetaldehyde caused by competition with acetic acid for active sites.
6. An enhancement in TOF relative to Fe is clearly seen with all of the PtFe/SiO2 catalysts except 0.7Pt0.1Fe/SiO2, and all TOF values for reduction are higher than that on Pt/SiO2, which exhibited primarily decomposition activity.
