[1] "The addition of Pt to Fe to form bimetallic PtFe particles increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pretreatment, enhanced activity, eliminated the induction period, lowered the apparent activation energy, and yet maintained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, particularly with catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios."

[1] "It is proposed that acetic acid reduction with H2 over bimetallic PtFe catalysts occurs via a rate-determining surface reaction between a hydrogen atom and surface acyl species, and the kinetics can be described by a rate expression derived from a LangmuirHinshelwood-type model invoking hydrogen dissociation on Pt sites and acetic acid adsorption and activation on an FeO phase to create the surface acyl species."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
4. It is hypothesized that acetic acid reduction with hydrogen over bimetallic PtFe catalysts involves a rate-limiting surface reaction between a hydrogen atom and surface acyl species, and the kinetics can be explained through a rate equation derived from a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type model that includes hydrogen dissociation on Pt sites and acetic acid adsorption and activation on an FeO phase to generate the surface acyl species.

4. 提出假设，在双金属PtFe催化剂上使用氢进行乙酸酸降解涉及一个速率决定的表面反应，其中氢原子与表面酰基物种之间发生反应，并通过Langmuir-Hinshelwood型模型解释了该过程的速率，该模型包括在Pt位点上的氢解离和在FeO相上乙酸吸附和活化，以产生表面酰基物种。
