[1] "The inverse CeO2/CuO catalyst was found to be more efficient than classical direct configurations for the preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich stream."
[2] "Computational and experimental studies have revealed that the presence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can significantly influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides."
[3] "These dopants can alter the surface chemistry and electronic structure of the host oxide, leading to enhanced activity and selectivity in catalytic reactions."
[4] "However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the complex interplay between Lewis acid-base interactions and the intrinsic properties of the host oxide."
[5] "The nature of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible, also plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of dopants."

1. The inverse CeO2/CuO catalyst demonstrated superior efficiency compared to traditional direct configurations for the preferential oxidation of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream. Studies have shown that both same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can significantly impact the catalytic properties of metal oxides, altering their surface chemistry and electronic structure, which in turn enhances their activity and selectivity in catalytic processes. However, creating universally applicable rules to predict dopant behavior is difficult due to the intricate relationship between Lewis acid-base interactions and the inherent characteristics of the host oxide. The reducibility or irreducibility of the host oxide also greatly influences the efficacy of dopants.

1. 反向CeO2/CuO催化剂在富氢流中选择性氧化CO方面比经典直接配置更有效。研究表明，同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）可以显著影响金属氧化物的催化性质，改变其表面化学和电子结构，从而提高其催化过程中的活性和选择性。然而，由于Lewis酸碱相互作用与宿主氧化物固有属性之间复杂的作用关系，构建预测掺杂行为的一般规则仍然具有挑战性。宿主氧化物的可还原性或不可还原性也极大地影响了掺杂剂的有效性。

The document discusses how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Theoretical calculations indicate that these dopants can enhance catalytic activity due to their unique electronic structures and Lewis acid-base interactions. Experimental evidence supports these findings, showing improved performance in various catalytic applications with the incorporation of SVDs and HVDs. However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging, especially considering the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). Factors contributing to this complexity include the interplay between dopant Lewis acidity/basicity and the intrinsic properties of the host oxide. Despite progress in understanding, the precise mechanisms governing dopant behavior in different environments are still subjects of ongoing research.

本文探讨了同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对不同金属氧化物催化性能的影响。理论计算表明，这些掺杂剂可以通过其独特的电子结构和路易斯酸碱相互作用显著增强催化活性。实验结果支持这些预测，显示在引入SVD和HVD后，各种催化应用的性能有所改善。然而，形成通用的掺杂行为预测规则仍然具有挑战性，特别是在考虑宿主氧化物的性质（可还原性vs.不可还原性）时。影响这一复杂性的因素包括掺杂剂路易斯酸度/碱性与宿主氧化物内在性质之间的相互作用。尽管取得了进展，但不同环境下的掺杂行为精确机制仍然是正在进行研究的主题。
