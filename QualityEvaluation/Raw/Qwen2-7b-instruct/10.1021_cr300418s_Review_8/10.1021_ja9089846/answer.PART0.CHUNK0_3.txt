In the context of catalytic applications, same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the properties of metal oxides by altering their activity, selectivity, and stability. Computational and experimental studies have elucidated the impact of these dopants, particularly in the preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich streams. However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains elusive due to the intricate nature of interactions within the host oxide. The reducibility of the oxide and Lewis acid-base interactions are critical factors in determining the effectiveness of dopants.

在催化应用中，同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过改变活性、选择性和稳定性影响金属氧化物的性质。计算和实验研究揭示了这些掺杂剂的影响，特别是在富氢流体中的CO选择性氧化中。然而，由于宿主氧化物的复杂性，形成通用的预测规则来描述掺杂剂的行为仍然具有挑战性。氧化物的可还原性和Lewis酸碱相互作用是决定掺杂剂有效性的关键因素。
