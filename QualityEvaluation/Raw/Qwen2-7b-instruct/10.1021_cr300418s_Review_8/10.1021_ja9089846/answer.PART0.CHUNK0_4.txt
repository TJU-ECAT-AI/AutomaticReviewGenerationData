1. The inverse CeO2/CuO catalyst was explored as an alternative for the preferential oxidation of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) significantly impact the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. Computational and experimental studies have elucidated how these dopants affect performance in various catalytic applications. Challenges in creating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include comprehending Lewis acid-base interactions and the characteristics of the host oxide, which can be either reducible or irreducible.

1. 研究了反向CeO2/CuO催化剂作为在富氢流中选择性氧化CO的替代方案。同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对不同金属氧化物的催化性质有显著影响。计算和实验研究揭示了这些掺杂剂如何影响各种催化应用的性能。创建通用预测规则以描述掺杂行为的挑战包括理解Lewis酸碱相互作用以及宿主氧化物的特性，后者可以是可还原或不可还原的。
