1. The inverse CeO2/CuO catalyst demonstrated superior efficiency compared to traditional direct configurations for the preferential oxidation of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream. Studies have shown that both same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can significantly impact the catalytic properties of metal oxides, altering their surface chemistry and electronic structure, which in turn enhances their activity and selectivity in catalytic processes. However, creating universally applicable rules to predict dopant behavior is difficult due to the intricate relationship between Lewis acid-base interactions and the inherent characteristics of the host oxide. The reducibility or irreducibility of the host oxide also greatly influences the efficacy of dopants.

1. 反向CeO2/CuO催化剂在富氢流中选择性氧化CO方面比经典直接配置更有效。研究表明，同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）可以显著影响金属氧化物的催化性质，改变其表面化学和电子结构，从而提高其催化过程中的活性和选择性。然而，由于Lewis酸碱相互作用与宿主氧化物固有属性之间复杂的作用关系，构建预测掺杂行为的一般规则仍然具有挑战性。宿主氧化物的可还原性或不可还原性也极大地影响了掺杂剂的有效性。
