The document discusses how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Theoretical calculations indicate that these dopants can enhance catalytic activity due to their unique electronic structures and Lewis acid-base interactions. Experimental evidence supports these findings, showing improved performance in various catalytic applications with the incorporation of SVDs and HVDs. However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging, especially considering the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). Factors contributing to this complexity include the interplay between dopant Lewis acidity/basicity and the intrinsic properties of the host oxide. Despite progress in understanding, the precise mechanisms governing dopant behavior in different environments are still subjects of ongoing research.

本文探讨了同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对不同金属氧化物催化性能的影响。理论计算表明，这些掺杂剂可以通过其独特的电子结构和路易斯酸碱相互作用显著增强催化活性。实验结果支持这些预测，显示在引入SVD和HVD后，各种催化应用的性能有所改善。然而，形成通用的掺杂行为预测规则仍然具有挑战性，特别是在考虑宿主氧化物的性质（可还原性vs.不可还原性）时。影响这一复杂性的因素包括掺杂剂路易斯酸度/碱性与宿主氧化物内在性质之间的相互作用。尽管取得了进展，但不同环境下的掺杂行为精确机制仍然是正在进行研究的主题。
