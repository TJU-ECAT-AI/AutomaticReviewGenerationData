[1] "The inverse CeO2/CuO catalyst was found to outperform classical direct configurations in the preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich streams."
[2] "Computational and experimental studies have provided insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides."
[3] "Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the role of Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)."

1. The inverse CeO2/CuO catalyst demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional direct configurations when oxidizing carbon monoxide in hydrogen-rich streams. Computational and experimental analyses have shed light on how both same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) impact the catalytic characteristics of metal oxides. However, creating universal predictive guidelines for dopant behavior remains challenging due to complexities such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the distinction between reducible and irreducible host oxides.

1. 反向CeO2/CuO催化剂在富氢流中氧化CO的表现优于传统的直接配置。计算和实验研究揭示了同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）如何影响金属氧化物的催化性质。然而，由于Lewis酸碱相互作用的作用以及宿主氧化物（可还原与不可还原）的性质等复杂性，构建通用的掺杂行为预测规则仍然具有挑战性。
