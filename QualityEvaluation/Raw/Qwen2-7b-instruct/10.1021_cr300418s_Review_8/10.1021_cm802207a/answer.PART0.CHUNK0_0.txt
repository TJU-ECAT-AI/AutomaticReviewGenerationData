[1] "Our efforts to understand and develop new/better OSMs have revealed (9) a synergistic redox role between Ce/Zr that renders CeO2ZrO2 oxides better OSMs than the corresponding CeO2HfO2 oxides."
[2] "The new material, synthesized by a soft-chemical hydrothermal route and stabilized in the fluorite structure through a CeIV/IIICrVI/IV redox process, exhibits excellent oxygen storage/release property that appears to be better than or at least competitive to that of the CeO2ZrO2-based oxides."
[3] "Formation of oxide I with a cation-disordered fluorite structure, unlike other lanthanide analogs, and its oxygen release/storage properties are discussed in terms of the redox chemistry of CeIV/III and CrVI/IV in the solid state."
[4] "We believe that formation of oxide I with the fluorite structure where Ce/Cr are atomically disordered is one of the factors that contributes to a high oxygen storage capacity."
[5] "Another likely factor that favors the high oxygen storage capacity is that, whereas Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 depends on CeIV/CeIII redox couple for its oxygen storage/release, oxide I employs both CeIV/CeIII and CrVI/IV/CrIII redox processes for its oxygen storage/release."
[6] "The material exhibits a high oxygen storage capacity of 0.175 moles O2/mole up to 550 C (retaining the fluorite structure) and a facile oxygen release/intake at a relatively low temperature of 350 C under reducing conditions."
[7] "Moreover, the material also releases oxygen under anaerobic condition around 350 C and oxidizes CO at 200 C."

The study describes the synthesis and characterization of a new metastable fluorite-type oxide, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.11, which exhibits excellent reversible oxygen storage and release properties. The key factors contributing to its high oxygen storage capacity include the formation of the material with a cation-disordered fluorite structure and the utilization of both CeIV/CeIII and CrVI/IV/CrIII redox processes. The oxide demonstrates a high oxygen storage capacity of 0.175 moles O2/mole up to 550 C and can release oxygen at a relatively low temperature of 350 C under reducing conditions. Additionally, it can release oxygen under anaerobic conditions and oxidize CO at 200 C.
