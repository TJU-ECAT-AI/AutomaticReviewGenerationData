[1] "Continuing our efforts in this direction with several CeO2-MOx (M = transition metal) systems and keeping in view the Ce/M redox characteristics in oxides as well as crystal chemistry, we have been able to develop a new OSM based on CeO2CrO3 oxides."
[2] "Formation of oxide I with a cation-disordered fluorite structure, unlike other lanthanide analogs, and its oxygen release/storage properties are discussed in terms of the redox chemistry of CeIV/III and CrVI/IV in the solid state."
[3] "The new material, synthesized by a soft-chemical hydrothermal route and stabilized in the fluorite structure through a CeIV/IIICrVI/IV redox process, exhibits excellent oxygen storage/release property that appears to be better than or at least competitive to that of the CeO2ZrO2-based oxides."
[4] "Our results described above show that oxide I is a better OSM than Ce1xZrxO2 oxides, both in terms of total oxygen storage capacity and the temperature range at which oxygen release/intake occurs."
[5] "We believe that formation of oxide I with the fluorite structure where Ce/Cr are atomically disordered is one of the factors that contributes to a high oxygen storage capacity."

The document discusses how dopants, specifically chromium (Cr), influence the catalytic properties of cerium oxide (CeO2) systems. By synthesizing a new oxide, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2+y, with a cation-disordered fluorite structure, the authors have developed an oxygen storage material (OSM) with enhanced oxygen storage capacity and release properties compared to traditional CeO2-ZrO2-based oxides. The redox chemistry of CeIV/III and CrVI/IV in the solid state plays a crucial role in the material's performance. The atomic disorder of cerium (Ce) and chromium (Cr) in the fluorite structure contributes to the high oxygen storage capacity of the oxide. The material demonstrates superior oxygen storage capacity and release at lower temperatures, making it a promising candidate for various applications requiring efficient oxygen storage and release.

文档讨论了掺杂剂，特别是铬（Cr），如何影响铈氧化物（CeO2）系统的催化性能。通过合成一种新的氧化物，Ce2/3Cr1/3O2+y，具有离子无序的氟化物结构，作者开发了一种氧气存储材料（OSM），其氧气存储容量和释放性能优于传统的CeO2-ZrO2基氧化物。铈IV/III和CrVI/IV在固体状态下的还原性化学对材料的性能至关重要。铈（Ce）和铬（Cr）在氟化物结构中的原子无序是该氧化物高氧气存储能力的一个重要因素。该材料在较低温度下表现出优异的氧气存储容量和释放能力，使其成为需要高效氧气存储和释放的各种应用的有前景候选者。
