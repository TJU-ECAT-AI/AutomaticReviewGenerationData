How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?

[1] "Our efforts to understand and develop new/better OSMs have revealed (9) a synergistic redox role between Ce/Zr that renders CeO2ZrO2 oxides better OSMs than the corresponding CeO2HfO2 oxides."
[2] "The new material, synthesized by a soft-chemical hydrothermal route and stabilized in the fluorite structure through a CeIV/IIICrVI/IV redox process, exhibits excellent oxygen storage/release property that appears to be better than or at least competitive to that of the CeO2ZrO2-based oxides."
[3] "Formation of oxide I with a cation-disordered fluorite structure, unlike other lanthanide analogs, and its oxygen release/storage properties are discussed in terms of the redox chemistry of CeIV/III and CrVI/IV in the solid state."
[4] "We believe that formation of oxide I with the fluorite structure where Ce/Cr are atomically disordered is one of the factors that contributes to a high oxygen storage capacity."
[5] "Another likely factor that favors the high oxygen storage capacity is that, whereas Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 depends on CeIV/CeIII redox couple for its oxygen storage/release, oxide I employs both CeIV/CeIII and CrVI/IV/CrIII redox processes for its oxygen storage/release."
[6] "The material exhibits a high oxygen storage capacity of 0.175 moles O2/mole up to 550 C (retaining the fluorite structure) and a facile oxygen release/intake at a relatively low temperature of 350 C under reducing conditions."
[7] "Moreover, the material also releases oxygen under anaerobic condition around 350 C and oxidizes CO at 200 C."

[1] "The formation of oxide I with a fluorite structure where cerium and chromium are disordered stands in contrast to the well-defined layered structure of other lanthanide oxychromates, Ln2O2CrO4 (Ln = rare earth)."
[2] "This difference in structure most likely arises from the redox characteristics of CeIV/CeIII (1.61 eV) and CrVI/CrIII (1.33 eV)."
[3] "In aqueous media, one would therefore expect from the solution redox potentials that the equilibrium (3) would lie to the right."
[4] "Accordingly, an electron transfer from CeIII to CrVI becomes facile in the solid state."

The document discusses how dopants, specifically chromium (Cr), influence the catalytic properties of cerium oxide (CeO2) systems. By synthesizing a new oxide, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2+y, with a cation-disordered fluorite structure, the authors have developed an oxygen storage material (OSM) with enhanced oxygen storage capacity and release properties compared to traditional CeO2-ZrO2-based oxides. The redox chemistry of CeIV/III and CrVI/IV in the solid state plays a crucial role in the material's performance. The atomic disorder of cerium (Ce) and chromium (Cr) in the fluorite structure contributes to the high oxygen storage capacity of the oxide. The material demonstrates superior oxygen storage capacity and release at lower temperatures, making it a promising candidate for various applications requiring efficient oxygen storage and release.
