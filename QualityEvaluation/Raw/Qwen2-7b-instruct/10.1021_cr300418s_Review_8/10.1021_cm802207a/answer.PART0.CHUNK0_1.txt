[1] "The formation of oxide I with a fluorite structure where cerium and chromium are disordered stands in contrast to the well-defined layered structure of other lanthanide oxychromates, Ln2O2CrO4 (Ln = rare earth)."
[2] "This difference in structure most likely arises from the redox characteristics of CeIV/CeIII (1.61 eV) and CrVI/CrIII (1.33 eV)."
[3] "In aqueous media, one would therefore expect from the solution redox potentials that the equilibrium (3) would lie to the right."
[4] "Accordingly, an electron transfer from CeIII to CrVI becomes facile in the solid state."
[5] "Ce2/3Cr1/3O2 fluorite would be CeIV2CrIVO6 rather than CeIII2CrVIO6 in the solid state."

The study explores the development of a new oxygen storage material, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2+y, based on the fluorite structure. The material is characterized by its reversible oxygen storage/release properties at relatively low temperatures (350°C). The formation of oxide I with a fluorite structure, where cerium and chromium are randomly distributed, is discussed in terms of the redox chemistry of CeIV/CeIII and CrVI/IV/CrIII in the solid state.

[1] "Formation of oxide I with a cation-disordered fluorite structure, unlike other lanthanide analogs, and its oxygen release/storage properties are discussed in terms of the redox chemistry of CeIV/III and CrVI/IV in the solid state."
[2] "Our efforts to understand and develop new/better OSMs have revealed (9) a synergistic redox role between Ce/Zr that renders CeO2ZrO2 oxides better OSMs than the corresponding CeO2HfO2 oxides."
[3] "The new material, synthesized by a soft-chemical hydrothermal route and stabilized in the fluorite structure through a CeIV/IIICrVI/IV redox process, exhibits excellent oxygen storage/release property that appears to be better than or at least competitive to that of the CeO2ZrO2-based oxides."
[4] "After we have completed our work, we came across the report (10) of a new series of oxygen storage materials, REBaCo4O7+δ (RE = rare earth), that show a similar oxygen storage capacity."

The research describes the characterization of a metastable nanocrystalline fluorite-type oxide, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.10, which displays reversible oxygen storage/release properties superior to or competitive with existing oxygen storage materials based on CeO2ZrO2. The formation of this material with a cation-disordered fluorite structure is attributed to the redox chemistry of CeIV/III and CrVI/IV in the solid state. The authors discuss the synergistic redox role between Ce and Zr that makes CeO2ZrO2 oxides better oxygen storage materials than CeO2HfO2 counterparts. They also introduce a new series of oxygen storage materials, REBaCo4O7+δ (RE = rare earth), which exhibit similar oxygen storage capacity.

该研究描述了描述了Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.10的表征，这是一种具有超稳定的纳米晶氟化物结构的氧化物，其可逆的氧存储/释放性能优于或与基于CeO2ZrO2的现有氧存储材料相媲美。该材料以离子无序的氟化物结构形成，归因于固体状态中CeIV/III和CrVI/IV的还原性化学作用。作者讨论了Ce和Zr之间的协同还原性作用，这使得CeO2ZrO2氧化物成为比CeO2HfO2更优秀的氧存储材料。他们还引入了一种新的氧存储材料系列，REBaCo4O7+δ（RE =稀土元素），这些材料显示出相似的氧存储能力。
