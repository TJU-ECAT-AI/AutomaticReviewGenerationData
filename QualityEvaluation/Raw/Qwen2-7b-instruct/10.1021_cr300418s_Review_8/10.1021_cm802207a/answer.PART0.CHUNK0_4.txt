<p>Formation of oxide I with a cation-disordered fluorite structure, unlike other lanthanide analogs, and its oxygen release/storage properties are discussed in terms of the redox chemistry of CeIV/III and CrVI/IV in the solid state.</p>
<p>To meet these demands, there is a need for new OSMs that store and release large quantities of oxygen at relatively low temperatures (<400 C).</p>
<p>After we have completed our work, we came across the report (10) of a new series of oxygen storage materials, REBaCo4O7+δ (RE = rare earth), that show a similar oxygen storage capacity.</p>
<p>The new material, synthesized by a soft-chemical hydrothermal route and stabilized in the fluorite structure through a CeIV/IIICrVI/IV redox process, exhibits excellent oxygen storage/release property that appears to be better than or at least competitive to that of the CeO2ZrO2-based oxides.</p>

The new material, synthesized using a hydrothermal method, is Ce2/3Cr1/3O2+y. This material crystallizes in a metastable nanocrystalline (4 nm) fluorite-type structure. The cerium and chromium ions are randomly distributed throughout the structure. The formula for this oxide is CeIV2/3CrVI1/9CrIV2/9O2.10  0.02. The redox chemistry of CeIV/III and CrVI/IV in the solid state explains the material's unique structure and its ability to store and release oxygen efficiently. This material is better than or at least competitive with CeO2ZrO2-based oxides in terms of oxygen storage capacity and release properties.

The new material, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2+y, exhibits excellent reversible oxygen release/storage properties at relatively low temperatures (350 C). The oxygen storage capacity is 0.175 moles of O2/mole up to 550 C. This value surpasses or matches the best OSMs based on CeO2ZrO2. The temperature (350 C) at which oxygen release/intake occurs with Ce2/3Cr1/3O2+y is lower than that of CeO2ZrO2-based oxides.
