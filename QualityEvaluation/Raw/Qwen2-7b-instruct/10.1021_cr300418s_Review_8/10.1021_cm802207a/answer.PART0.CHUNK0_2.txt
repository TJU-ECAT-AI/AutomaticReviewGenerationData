[1] "Formation of oxide I with a fluorite structure where cerium and chromium are disordered stands in contrast to the well-defined layered structure of other lanthanide oxychromates, Ln2O2CrO4 (Ln = rare earth)."
[2] "The material exhibits a high oxygen storage capacity of 0.175 moles O2/mole up to 550 C (retaining the fluorite structure) and a facile oxygen release/intake at a relatively low temperature of 350 C under reducing conditions."
[3] "Moreover, the material also releases oxygen under anaerobic condition around 350 C and oxidizes CO at 200 C."
[4] "All these characteristics make the oxide I an excellent OSM that is better than or at least competitive to Ce1xZrxO2 oxides."

This literature discusses the development of a new oxygen storage material, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.11, with a fluorite structure. This material exhibits a high oxygen storage capacity of 0.175 moles of O2 per mole up to 550°C, with facile oxygen release and intake occurring at a relatively low temperature of 350°C under reducing conditions. The material also releases oxygen under anaerobic conditions around 350°C and oxidizes CO at 200°C, making it an excellent oxygen storage material (OSM) that surpasses or is competitive with Ce1xZrxO2 oxides.

本文讨论了一种名为Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.11的新型氧存储材料，其结构为氟化物。该材料在550°C以下表现出高氧存储能力，每摩尔可存储0.175摩尔的O2，并且在350°C的还原条件下容易释放和吸收氧气。此外，该材料在无氧条件下约350°C释放氧气，并在200°C氧化CO，使其成为优于或与Ce1xZrxO2氧化物竞争的优秀氧存储材料。
