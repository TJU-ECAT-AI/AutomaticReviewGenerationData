[1] "The most useful surface probe, in this situation, is surface chemistry. One should compare the catalytic activity of the presumed doped catalyst to that of supported dopantoxide clusters and to those of supported metallic dopant clusters."
[2] "We find that the ease with which one can make oxygen vacancies correlates with the reactivity of the surface toward methane dissociation."
[3] "Our main conclusion is that Zn-doped lanthana is a much better catalyst than lanthana, for methane activation, if one can prepare it so that the Zn dopants are in the surface layer."
[4] "The binding energy of molecularly adsorbed methane to the surfaces examined here is very small."
[5] "The conventional interpretation of the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) rule would suggest that the activation energy to product A should be lower than that for forming B."

1. The main probe for understanding dopant behavior is surface chemistry. The catalytic activity of presumed doped catalysts should be compared to that of supported dopantoxide clusters and supported metallic dopant clusters.

2. The ease of making oxygen vacancies is closely linked to the reactivity of the surface towards methane dissociation.

3. Zn-doped lanthana is significantly more reactive than lanthana for methane activation, provided the Zn dopants are positioned in the surface layer.

4. The binding energy of molecularly adsorbed methane to the surfaces studied is very small.

5. Contrary to the conventional BrnstedEvansPolanyi rule, the activation energy for forming state B is lower than that for state A due to the closer proximity of the fragments in state B.

1. 在这种情况下，最有效的表面探针是表面化学。应将假定掺杂催化剂的催化活性与支持掺杂物氧化物簇和支持金属掺杂物簇的催化活性进行比较。

2. 制备氧气空位的简便性与表面甲烷解离反应的活性密切相关。

3. 如果能够将Zn掺杂剂定位在表面层，Zn掺杂镧为甲烷激活提供了比纯镧更为活跃的催化剂。

4. 研究的表面吸附甲烷的结合能非常小。

5. 与传统的BrnstedEvansPolanyi规则相反，形成状态B的活化能低于形成状态A，因为状态B中的碎片更接近。
