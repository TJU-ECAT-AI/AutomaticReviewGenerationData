[1] "In the present work, we use density functional theory to test this suggestion."
[2] "Previous work (18-21) has shown that some dopants facilitate the dissociative adsorption of methane because the fragments (CH3 and H) can bind strongly to the oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
[3] "We find that these dopants activate the surface oxygen atoms and make methane dissociation exothermic."
[4] "Our main conclusion is that Zn-doped lanthana is a much better catalyst than lanthana, for methane activation, if one can prepare it so that the Zn dopants are in the surface layer."
[5] "The reduced surface has lower activity."
[6] "We argue that, for dissociative adsorption, the BrnstedEvansPolanyi rule needs to be modified to take into account not only the binding energy of the products but also the distance between the fragments formed by dissociation."
[7] "We find that the dissociation energy is higher (i.e., the reaction is more exothermic) on Cu-doped lanthana (CuLa2O3) than on Mg-doped lanthana (MgLa2O3)."
[8] "These findings suggest that Cu-, Mg-, and Zn-doped La2O3 surfaces may be able to break the CH bond in methane at lower temperatures than La2O3."
[9] "We have not followed the fate of these fragments because we confine ourself to studying the breaking of the CH bond."

1. The study employs density functional theory to assess the impact of dopants on methane dissociation on lanthana surfaces.
2. Some dopants enhance methane dissociative adsorption by strengthening the binding of CH3 and H fragments to oxygen atoms.
3. Dopants activate the surface oxygen atoms, making methane dissociation exothermic.
4. Zinc-doped lanthana is identified as a superior catalyst for methane activation compared to undoped lanthana, provided the zinc dopants are located on the surface layer.
5. The reduced surface exhibits lower activity.
6. The BrnstedEvansPolanyi rule should be adapted to consider the distance between dissociation fragments, in addition to the binding energy of products, for dissociative adsorption.
7. Copper-doped lanthana demonstrates a higher dissociation energy than magnesium-doped lanthana.
8. The presence of dopants can lower the temperature at which methane activation occurs.
9. The study focuses solely on the breaking of the CH bond and does not explore the subsequent fate of the fragments.
