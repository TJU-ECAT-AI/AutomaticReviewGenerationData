<p>The dissociative adsorption energy, Edisso, is calculated from where E[CH3, H] is the energy of the oxide slab with H and CH3 adsorbed on its surface, ECH4(g) is the energy of gaseous methane, and Es is the energy of the oxide slab prior to methane adsorption.</p>

<p>We find that the dissociation energy Edisso is 0.45 eV, in contrast with dissociation on undoped La2O3(001), which is endothermic by 4.45 eV.</p>

The document provides insights into how dopants influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides. For example, Cu, Mg, and Zn doping activates the surface oxygen atoms, making methane dissociation exothermic. The ease with which oxygen vacancies are made correlates with the reactivity of the surface toward methane dissociation. The Cu dopant is highly active but prone to losing oxygen at high temperatures, reducing its effectiveness. Mg doping has a lesser effect compared to Zn. Zn doping, particularly on the (001) surface, results in a very low activation energy for methane dissociation, suggesting enhanced catalytic activity. However, Zn prefers to be in the bulk, diminishing its impact on surface chemistry. The study also highlights the importance of considering the distance between dissociated fragments and the binding energy of the products when applying the Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) rule for dissociative adsorption. Lastly, the interaction of gas-phase O2 with the reduced ZnLa2O3(001) surface leads to O2 adsorption and activation, facilitating methane dissociation.

文档提供了关于掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物催化性质的见解。例如，Cu、Mg和Zn掺杂激活了表面氧原子，使得甲烷解离变得放热。形成氧空位的容易程度与表面对甲烷解离的反应性成正比。Cu掺杂剂活性很高，但在高温下易于失去氧，降低其有效性。Mg掺杂的效果较弱，相比Zn。Zn掺杂，尤其是在（001）表面上，导致甲烷解离活化能非常低，暗示增强催化活性。然而，Zn倾向于位于晶格内部，减弱了其对表面化学的影响。研究还强调了在应用Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi（BEP）规则时考虑解离碎片之间的距离以及产物的结合能的重要性。最后，气体相O2与还原后的ZnLa2O3（001）表面的相互作用导致O2吸附和激活，促进甲烷解离。
