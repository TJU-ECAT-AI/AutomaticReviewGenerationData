[1] "We find that these dopants activate the surface oxygen atoms and make methane dissociation exothermic."
[2] "Cu-doped lanthana is very active, but it loses oxygen too easily and the surface is likely to be reduced at the temperatures at which methane dissociates."
[3] "The effect of Mg doping on methane activation is less than that of Zn."
[4] "We focus, therefore, on Zn-doped lanthana and calculate the activation barrier for methane dissociation."
[5] "Our main conclusion is that Zn-doped lanthana is a much better catalyst than lanthana, for methane activation, if one can prepare it so that the Zn dopants are in the surface layer."
[6] "We argue that this distance needs to be taken into account when applying BEP rules."

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by activating the surface oxygen atoms and affecting methane dissociation. High-valence dopants like Zn have been found to be more effective catalysts for methane activation than low-valence dopants like Cu and Mg. However, the ease with which the dopants can lose oxygen affects their effectiveness. Zn dopants, when properly positioned in the surface layer, are suggested to enhance methane activation due to their ability to maintain reactivity without losing oxygen too easily.

2. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the interplay between dopant Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide. The reducibility or irreducibility of the oxide plays a crucial role in determining how effectively dopants can influence the catalytic properties. The literature highlights the importance of considering the distance between the fragments formed by dissociation when applying the Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) rule. This insight suggests that the rule needs modification to account for both the binding energy of products and the distance between their binding sites during dissociative adsorption.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过激活表面氧原子并影响甲烷解离，对不同金属氧化物的催化性能产生影响。例如，如Zn这类高价掺杂剂被发现比Cu和Mg这类低价掺杂剂更有效地促进甲烷激活。然而，掺杂剂失去氧的能力会影响其效果。研究表明，当Zn掺杂剂正确地位于表面层时，可以增强甲烷激活，由于它们能够保持活性而不易失去氧。

2. 在制定用于预测掺杂行为的一般性规则时，理解掺杂剂的Lewis酸碱相互作用与宿主氧化物性质之间的关系是关键。氧化物的可还原性或不可还原性在确定掺杂剂如何有效影响催化性能方面起着重要作用。文献强调，在应用Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi（BEP）规则时考虑碎片形成的距离的重要性。这一见解表明，该规则需要修改，以考虑到产品结合能和在其分解过程中片段之间结合点的距离。
