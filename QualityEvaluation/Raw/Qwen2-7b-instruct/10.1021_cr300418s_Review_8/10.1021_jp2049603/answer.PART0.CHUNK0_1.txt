[1] "The ease with which one can make oxygen vacancies correlates with the reactivity of the surface toward methane dissociation."
[2] "We find that the dissociation energy is higher (i.e., the reaction is more exothermic) on Cu-doped lanthana (CuLa2O3) than on Mg-doped lanthana (MgLa2O3)."
[3] "The effect of Mg doping on methane activation is less than that of Zn."
[4] "Our calculations show that the reduced CuLa2O3 does not break the CH bond efficiently."
[5] "We believe that this happens because the two faces have almost the same surface energy, hence the same degree of undercoordination."
[6] "The calculations show that the activation energy to reach state B is lower than that for reaching state A, despite the fact that A binds more strongly."

1. The ease of creating oxygen vacancies is linked to the surface's reactivity in methane dissociation.
2. Cu-doped lanthana exhibits a higher dissociation energy, indicating a more exothermic reaction compared to Mg-doped lanthana.
3. Zn doping has a greater impact on methane activation than Mg doping.
4. Reduced Cu-doped lanthana fails to efficiently break the CH bond.
5. The similarity in surface energy between the two faces of Zn-doped lanthana contributes to their comparable reactivity towards methane dissociation.
6. Despite state A having a stronger binding energy, the activation energy to reach state B is lower due to the fragments being closer together during the dissociation process.

1. 制造氧空位的难易程度与表面在甲烷解离方面的反应性相关。
2. Cu掺杂镧氧化物的解离能高于Mg掺杂镧氧化物，表明其反应更为放热。
3. Zn掺杂对甲烷活化的影响大于Mg掺杂。
4. 减少的Cu掺杂镧氧化物无法有效地断裂CH键。
5. Zn掺杂镧氧化物两面的相似表面能量导致它们在甲烷解离方面具有相近的反应性。
6. 尽管状态A的结合能更强，但达到状态B的活化能较低，因为解离过程中片段之间的距离更短。
