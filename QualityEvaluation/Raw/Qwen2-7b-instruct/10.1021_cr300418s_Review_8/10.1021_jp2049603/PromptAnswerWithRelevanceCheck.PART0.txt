<p>The calculations reported here were performed by using periodic, spin-polarized DFT as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP).</p>
<p>The dissociative adsorption energy, Edisso, is calculated from where E[CH3, H] is the energy of the oxide slab with H and CH3 adsorbed on its surface, ECH4(g) is the energy of gaseous methane, and Es is the energy of the oxide slab prior to methane adsorption.</p>
<p>Because the energy of vacancy formation on CuLa2O3(001) is very low, we suspect that the doped oxide will form oxygen vacancies at the temperatures at which methane dissociative adsorption is likely to take place.</p>
<p>We find that the dissociation energy Edisso is 1.96 eV, in contrast with dissociation on undoped La2O3(001), which is endothermic by 4.45 eV.</p>
<p>These results show that the Cu dopant activates the surface oxygen atoms and makes methane dissociation exothermic.</p>
<p>We find that the dissociation energy Edisso is 0.45 eV, in contrast with dissociation on undoped La2O3(001), which is endothermic by 4.45 eV.</p>
<p>In this work, we have examined the chemical properties of systems in which the dopant is located in the outermost layer of the surface.</p>
<p>The calculations show that the reduced CuLa2O3 does not break the CH bond efficiently.</p>
<p>We find that the Zn atom prefers to be located in the bulk (in the absence of gases) and its influence on the chemistry of the surface, when this happens, is substantially diminished.</p>

The document provides insights into how dopants influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides. For example, Cu, Mg, and Zn doping activates the surface oxygen atoms, making methane dissociation exothermic. The ease with which oxygen vacancies are made correlates with the reactivity of the surface toward methane dissociation. The Cu dopant is highly active but prone to losing oxygen at high temperatures, reducing its effectiveness. Mg doping has a lesser effect compared to Zn. Zn doping, particularly on the (001) surface, results in a very low activation energy for methane dissociation, suggesting enhanced catalytic activity. However, Zn prefers to be in the bulk, diminishing its impact on surface chemistry. The study also highlights the importance of considering the distance between dissociated fragments and the binding energy of the products when applying the Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) rule for dissociative adsorption. Lastly, the interaction of gas-phase O2 with the reduced ZnLa2O3(001) surface leads to O2 adsorption and activation, facilitating methane dissociation.

文档提供了关于掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物催化性质的见解。例如，Cu、Mg和Zn掺杂激活了表面氧原子，使得甲烷解离变得放热。形成氧空位的容易程度与表面对甲烷解离的反应性成正比。Cu掺杂剂活性很高，但在高温下易于失去氧，降低其有效性。Mg掺杂的效果较弱，相比Zn。Zn掺杂，尤其是在（001）表面上，导致甲烷解离活化能非常低，暗示增强催化活性。然而，Zn倾向于位于晶格内部，减弱了其对表面化学的影响。研究还强调了在应用Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi（BEP）规则时考虑解离碎片之间的距离以及产物的结合能的重要性。最后，气体相O2与还原后的ZnLa2O3（001）表面的相互作用导致O2吸附和激活，促进甲烷解离。

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by activating the surface oxygen atoms and affecting methane dissociation. High-valence dopants like Zn have been found to be more effective catalysts for methane activation than low-valence dopants like Cu and Mg. However, the ease with which the dopants can lose oxygen affects their effectiveness. Zn dopants, when properly positioned in the surface layer, are suggested to enhance methane activation due to their ability to maintain reactivity without losing oxygen too easily.

2. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the interplay between dopant Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide. The reducibility or irreducibility of the oxide plays a crucial role in determining how effectively dopants can influence the catalytic properties. The literature highlights the importance of considering the distance between the fragments formed by dissociation when applying the Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) rule. This insight suggests that the rule needs modification to account for both the binding energy of products and the distance between their binding sites during dissociative adsorption.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过激活表面氧原子并影响甲烷解离，对不同金属氧化物的催化性能产生影响。例如，如Zn这类高价掺杂剂被发现比Cu和Mg这类低价掺杂剂更有效地促进甲烷激活。然而，掺杂剂失去氧的能力会影响其效果。研究表明，当Zn掺杂剂正确地位于表面层时，可以增强甲烷激活，由于它们能够保持活性而不易失去氧。

2. 在制定用于预测掺杂行为的一般性规则时，理解掺杂剂的Lewis酸碱相互作用与宿主氧化物性质之间的关系是关键。氧化物的可还原性或不可还原性在确定掺杂剂如何有效影响催化性能方面起着重要作用。文献强调，在应用Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi（BEP）规则时考虑碎片形成的距离的重要性。这一见解表明，该规则需要修改，以考虑到产品结合能和在其分解过程中片段之间结合点的距离。
