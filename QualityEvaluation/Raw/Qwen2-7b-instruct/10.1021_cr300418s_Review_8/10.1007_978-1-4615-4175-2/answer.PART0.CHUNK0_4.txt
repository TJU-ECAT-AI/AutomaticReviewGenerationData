[1] "The authors set out to accomplish two challenging goals in the writing of this book and they successfully accomplished both of them."
[2] "Their first goal was to give examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations and to consider them in a way that could lead to greater understanding of these reactions so that this insight might provide better design of catalytic oxidation processes."
[3] "The second goal that the authors set out was to take a fresh look at long established ideas and concepts, to ascertain their limitations and, by so doing delineate guidelines for future research."
[4] "They do a fine job of doing just that. Almost all new, and many established heterogeneous catalytic oxidation process technologies are covered at some point in this volume."
[5] "Detailed descriptions of nearly all aspects of the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation and ammoxidation of alkanes, alkenes and alkyl aromatics are provided from many different points of view including the catalysts, reaction conditions, applications, process concepts, reactor design and mechanisms."
[6] "The authors also highlight the enormous contributions made by catalytic oxidation technology to the chemical industry, noting that more than half the products made using catalytic processes and nearly all the monomers used for the production of fibers and plastics are obtained through selective oxidation."

Selective Oxidation by Heterogeneous Catalysis provides insights into the catalytic properties of different metal oxides influenced by same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs). The book discusses computational and experimental studies revealing how these dopants affect performance in various catalytic applications. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior are addressed, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

The authors successfully achieved their dual goals of offering examples of new catalytic oxidations for improved understanding and redesign of catalytic oxidation processes, and critically reviewing established ideas to suggest guidelines for future research. The book comprehensively covers new and established heterogeneous catalytic oxidation processes, detailing aspects such as catalysts, reaction conditions, applications, process concepts, reactor design, and mechanisms. It highlights the significant role of catalytic oxidation technology in the chemical industry, noting its substantial contributions to product manufacturing.

《异相催化选择氧化》一书提供了不同金属氧化物在同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）影响下的催化性质的见解。书中讨论了计算和实验研究，揭示了这些掺杂剂如何影响各种催化应用中的性能。书中解决了制定一般预测规则以描述掺杂行为的挑战，考虑了宿主氧化物（可还原性与不可还原性）的性质、Lewis酸碱相互作用等因素。

作者成功地实现了他们的双重目标：提供新催化氧化的示例以促进更深入的理解和催化氧化过程的改进设计，并对已建立的想法进行批判性审查以提出未来研究的指导原则。这本书全面涵盖了新的和已建立的异相催化氧化过程，详细介绍了催化剂、反应条件、应用、过程概念、反应器设计和机制等方面的内容。它强调了催化氧化技术在化学工业中的重要作用，指出其在产品制造中所做出的重大贡献。
