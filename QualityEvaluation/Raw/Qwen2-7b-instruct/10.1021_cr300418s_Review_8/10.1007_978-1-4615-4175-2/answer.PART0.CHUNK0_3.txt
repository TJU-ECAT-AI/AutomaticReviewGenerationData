[1] "The authors set out to accomplish two challenging goals in the writing of this book and they successfully accomplished both of them."
[2] "Their first goal was to give examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations and to consider them in a way that could lead to greater understanding of these reactions so that this insight might provide better design of catalytic oxidation processes."
[3] "The second goal that the authors set out was to take a fresh look at long established ideas and concepts, to ascertain their limitations and, by so doing delineate guidelines for future research."
[4] "They also highlight the enormous contributions made by catalytic oxidation technology to the chemical industry, noting that more than half the products made using catalytic processes and nearly all the monomers used for the production of fibers and plastics are obtained through selective oxidation."
[5] "It will be a valuable addition to the literature of heterogeneous catalytic oxidation."
