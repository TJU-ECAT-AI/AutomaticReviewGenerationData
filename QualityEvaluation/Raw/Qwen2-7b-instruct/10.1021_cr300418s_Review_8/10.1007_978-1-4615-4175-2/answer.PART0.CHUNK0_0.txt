[1] "The authors set out to accomplish two challenging goals in the writing of this book and they successfully accomplished both of them."
[2] "Their first goal was to give examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations and to consider them in a way that could lead to greater understanding of these reactions so that this insight might provide better design of catalytic oxidation processes."
[3] "The second goal that the authors set out was to take a fresh look at long established ideas and concepts, to ascertain their limitations and, by so doing delineate guidelines for future research."
[4] "New Technological and Industrial Opportunities"
[5] "Control of the Surface Reactivity of Solid Catalysts"
[6] "New Fields of Application for Solid Catalysts"
[7] "New Concepts and New Strategies in Selective Oxidation"
[8] "New Aspects of the Mechanisms of Selective Oxidation and Structure/Activity Relationships"
[9] "In conclusion, this volume is well written, informative, interesting, and thought provoking. It will be a valuable addition to the literature of heterogeneous catalytic oxidation."
