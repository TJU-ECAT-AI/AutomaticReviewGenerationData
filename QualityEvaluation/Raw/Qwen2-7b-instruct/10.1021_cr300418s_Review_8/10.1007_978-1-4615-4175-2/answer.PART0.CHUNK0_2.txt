[1] "The authors set out to accomplish two challenging goals in the writing of this book and they successfully accomplished both of them."
[2] "Their first goal was to give examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations and to consider them in a way that could lead to greater understanding of these reactions so that this insight might provide better design of catalytic oxidation processes."
[3] "The second goal that the authors set out was to take a fresh look at long established ideas and concepts, to ascertain their limitations and, by so doing delineate guidelines for future research."
[4] "Although the authors state, early on, that their goal is not to provide a comprehensive review of new oxidation process technology, they do a fine job of doing just that."
[5] "Almost all new, and many established heterogeneous catalytic oxidation process technologies are covered at some point in this volume."

Selective Oxidation by Heterogeneous Catalysis presents insights into the influence of dopants on the catalytic properties of metal oxides. The book covers various dopant types, including same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs), and their effects on the performance of different metal oxides in various catalytic applications. Insights are gained from both computational and experimental studies. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior are discussed, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). The book does not provide a comprehensive review of new oxidation process technology but covers almost all new and many established heterogeneous catalytic oxidation process technologies, offering guidelines for future research.

《异质催化选择氧化》一书提供了关于掺杂剂对金属氧化物催化性能影响的见解。该书涵盖了不同类型的掺杂剂，如同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD），以及它们在各种催化应用中对不同金属氧化物性能的影响。从计算和实验研究中获得了见解。讨论了制定掺杂行为通用预测规则的挑战，考虑因素包括Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质（可还原性vs.不可还原性）。该书没有提供新氧化过程技术的全面综述，但覆盖了几乎所有新的和许多已建立的异质催化氧化过程技术，为未来研究提供了指导原则。
