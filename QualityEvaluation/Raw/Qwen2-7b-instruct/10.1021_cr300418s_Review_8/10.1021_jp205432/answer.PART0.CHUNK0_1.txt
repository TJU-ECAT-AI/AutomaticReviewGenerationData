1. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation because they create a hole at the top of the valence band. This effect is independent of the distance between the dopant and the vacancy site. Recognizing LVDs can be done a priori by comparing the valences of the dopant in its own oxide and the cation in the host oxide.

2. The behavior of dopants in influencing the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation differs between low-valence dopants and high-valence dopants. Low-valence dopants lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation both near and far from the dopant, while high-valence dopants typically increase the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation near the dopant.

3. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the interplay between Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). Despite these complexities, certain trends emerge, such as the effect of dopant valence and the influence of the dopant's ability to bind oxygen in its own oxide.

4. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is puzzling because these dopants lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount despite their different chemical properties.

5. The reason for this similarity lies in the fact that these dopants manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce, creating bonds that are shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria. This action weakens the bond of the oxygen to the surface.

6. By pulling the oxygen atoms closer to themselves and away from Ce, these dopants weaken the oxygen's bond to the surface, contributing to the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation.

1. 低价掺杂剂（LVD）通过在价带顶部创建一个空穴来降低氧空位形成能。这种效应与掺杂剂和宿主氧化物中的离子之间的距离无关。识别LVD可以在其自身氧化物和宿主氧化物中离子的电荷之间进行先验比较。

2. 掺杂剂对氧空位形成能的影响在低价掺杂剂和高价掺杂剂之间有所不同。低价掺杂剂无论靠近还是远离掺杂剂都降低了氧空位形成能，而高价掺杂剂通常在掺杂剂附近增加了氧空位形成能。

3. 制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则的挑战包括理解Lewis酸碱相互作用与宿主氧化物（可还原性vs.不可还原性）性质之间的相互作用。尽管存在这些复杂性，但仍出现了一些趋势，例如掺杂剂电荷和掺杂剂在其自身氧化物中结合氧的能力的影响。

4. 钛、钌、锆、钽、铌、钼或钨掺杂的可还原CeO2(111)表面的氧空位形成能难以理解，因为这些掺杂剂以相似的量降低了氧空位形成能，尽管它们具有不同的化学性质。

5. 这种相似性的原因在于这些掺杂剂能够将氧原子从Ce拉近，形成比铈氧化物中铈氧键更短的键。这种行动削弱了氧对表面的键。

6. 通过将氧原子拉近自己并远离Ce，这些掺杂剂削弱了氧对表面的键，从而导致氧空位形成能的降低。
