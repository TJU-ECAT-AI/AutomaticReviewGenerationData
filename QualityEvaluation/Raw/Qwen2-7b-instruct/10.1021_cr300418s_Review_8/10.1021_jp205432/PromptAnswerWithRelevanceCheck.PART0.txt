<p>The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopantoxygen bonds that are much shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria. This similarity is puzzling considering that the oxides of these dopants have vastly different enthalpies of formation.</p>
<p>An examination of the projected density of states (PDOS) shows that W and Mo donate two electrons to ceria to reduce two Ce atoms, and Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom. After this electron donation, these dopants have only four electrons available for making bonds, just like the Ce atom they replace. The other dopants (Ru, Zr, and Pt) do not donate electrons to reduce Ce, and therefore, they also have four electrons for making bonds. We speculate that this is one the reasons for the similarity of their effect on ΔEv. The other reason is that their bonds with oxygen, in their own oxides, is much shorter than the CeO bond in CeO2. When one of these dopants replaces a Ce atom, it pulls the oxygen atoms in the oxide surface toward it and away from cerium. By doing this, they weaken the bond of the oxygen to the surface.</p>

The dopants Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W all lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in CeO2(111) by a similar amount. They manage to shift oxygen atoms away from Ce to create bonds that are shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria. Despite their oxides having vastly different enthalpies of formation, the dopants have four electrons available for bonding, similar to the Ce atom they replace. W and Mo donate two electrons, Ta and Nb donate one electron, reducing Ce atoms. This electron donation leaves the dopants with four electrons for bonding, contributing to the similarity in their effect on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation. The shortening of metal-oxygen bonds when the dopants replace Ce atoms weakens the bond of oxygen to the surface.

Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Nb、Mo和W等掺杂剂在CeO2(111)中降低氧空位形成能的能量相似。它们将氧原子移向Ce，形成比ceria中的CeO键更短的键。尽管这些掺杂剂的氧化物具有截然不同的形成焓，但它们均具有与所取代的Ce原子相同的四个电子用于成键。Mo和W捐赠两个电子，Ta和Nb捐赠一个电子，减少Ce原子。这种电子捐赠使掺杂剂具有四个电子用于成键，这是它们在氧空位形成能上产生相似效应的原因之一。当这些掺杂剂取代Ce原子时，金属-氧键缩短，减弱了氧与表面的键合。

[1] "The LVDs affect the energy of vacancy formation because they create a hole at the top of the valence band."
[2] "This mechanism is independent of the distance between the dopant and the site where the vacancy is formed."
[3] "In all the cases we examined, an LVD can be recognized a priori from the valence of the dopant in its own oxide and the valence of the cation in the host oxide (e.g., for Li-doped MgO, the monovalent Li replaces the divalent Mg)."
[4] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand."
[5] "They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopantoxygen bonds that are much shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria."
[6] "By doing this, they weaken the bond of the oxygen to the surface."

1. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation because they create a hole at the top of the valence band. This effect is independent of the distance between the dopant and the vacancy site. Recognizing LVDs can be done a priori by comparing the valences of the dopant in its own oxide and the cation in the host oxide.

2. The behavior of dopants in influencing the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation differs between low-valence dopants and high-valence dopants. Low-valence dopants lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation both near and far from the dopant, while high-valence dopants typically increase the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation near the dopant.

3. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the interplay between Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). Despite these complexities, certain trends emerge, such as the effect of dopant valence and the influence of the dopant's ability to bind oxygen in its own oxide.

4. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is puzzling because these dopants lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount despite their different chemical properties.

5. The reason for this similarity lies in the fact that these dopants manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce, creating bonds that are shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria. This action weakens the bond of the oxygen to the surface.

6. By pulling the oxygen atoms closer to themselves and away from Ce, these dopants weaken the oxygen's bond to the surface, contributing to the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation.

1. 低价掺杂剂（LVD）通过在价带顶部创建一个空穴来降低氧空位形成能。这种效应与掺杂剂和宿主氧化物中的离子之间的距离无关。识别LVD可以在其自身氧化物和宿主氧化物中离子的电荷之间进行先验比较。

2. 掺杂剂对氧空位形成能的影响在低价掺杂剂和高价掺杂剂之间有所不同。低价掺杂剂无论靠近还是远离掺杂剂都降低了氧空位形成能，而高价掺杂剂通常在掺杂剂附近增加了氧空位形成能。

3. 制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则的挑战包括理解Lewis酸碱相互作用与宿主氧化物（可还原性vs.不可还原性）性质之间的相互作用。尽管存在这些复杂性，但仍出现了一些趋势，例如掺杂剂电荷和掺杂剂在其自身氧化物中结合氧的能力的影响。

4. 钛、钌、锆、钽、铌、钼或钨掺杂的可还原CeO2(111)表面的氧空位形成能难以理解，因为这些掺杂剂以相似的量降低了氧空位形成能，尽管它们具有不同的化学性质。

5. 这种相似性的原因在于这些掺杂剂能够将氧原子从Ce拉近，形成比铈氧化物中铈氧键更短的键。这种行动削弱了氧对表面的键。

6. 通过将氧原子拉近自己并远离Ce，这些掺杂剂削弱了氧对表面的键，从而导致氧空位形成能的降低。

[1] "The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."
[2] "We find that low-valence dopants (Na and Li dopants in MgO and La and Y dopants in CeO2) have both a long-range and a short-range effect."
[3] "The only stable oxide of Ta is Ta2O5, and therefore, Ta is a pentavalent dopant, and when used to dope ceria, it is an HVD."
[4] "It is also important to keep in mind that Ce can readily adjust its valence in response to changes in conditions; besides Ce2O3 and CeO2, the following oxides are stable under various oxygen pressures and temperatures: CeO1.714, CeO1.778, CeO1.800, and CeO1.818."
[5] "The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopantoxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on ΔEv is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3."

The document explores how dopants influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Specifically, it discusses the effects of low-valence dopants (LVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for catalytic activity. LVDs, like La and Y in ceria, have both a local and global impact, affecting the energy of oxygen vacancy formation near and far from the dopant. HVDs, such as Ta, generally increase the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, except for Ga-doped magnesium oxide, which surprisingly reduces the energy. The study also highlights the importance of considering the valence of dopants and their ability to bind oxygen, noting that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation is influenced by the bond strength between the dopant and oxygen atoms in their respective oxides. Additionally, the document mentions the flexibility of cerium ions in adjusting their formal charge, which plays a role in the dopant's influence on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.

文档研究了掺杂剂对金属氧化物催化性能的影响。具体而言，它探讨了低价掺杂剂（LVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）如何影响表面氧空位形成所需的能量，这是预测氧化反应能力的关键因素。LVD，如铈氧化物中的镧和钇，既具有局部效应也具有全局效应，影响邻近和远离掺杂剂的氧空位形成能。HVD，如钽，通常增加氧空位形成能，除了镁氧化物中的镓掺杂，这出乎意料地降低了能级。研究还强调了考虑掺杂剂的电荷以及它们在各自氧化物中与氧原子的结合能力的重要性，指出氧化物中掺杂剂与氧原子之间的键强度影响氧空位形成能。此外，文档提到铈离子在不同氧压和温度下的灵活性，这对于理解掺杂剂对氧空位形成能的影响起着关键作用。

The study explores how dopants influence the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in ceria and magnesium oxide. It distinguishes between low-valence dopants (LVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs), noting that LVDs have both local and global effects on oxygen-vacancy formation, whereas HVDs primarily have a local effect. The research identifies Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W dopants as having a similar impact on oxygen-vacancy formation because they are effectively tetravalent, akin to the cerium atom they replace. The lack of correlation between the dopant's bond strength in its own oxide and its effect on oxygen-vacancy formation is explained by the ease with which cerium ions can alter their formal charge from +4 to +3.

研究探讨了掺杂剂如何影响氧化铈和镁氧化物中氧空位形成能。它区分了低价掺杂剂（LVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD），发现LVD既有局部效应也有全局效应，而HVD主要具有局部效应。研究确认了铂、钌、锆、铌、钽、钼和钨掺杂剂对氧空位形成能有相似的影响，因为它们在氧化物中的价态类似于它们取代的铈原子。缺乏掺杂剂自身氧化物中键强度与其对氧空位形成能影响之间的相关性，部分原因是铈离子可以轻松地将正式电荷从+4改变为+3。

[1] "It is reasonable to assume that the two pictures coexist. To test whether this is the case, we have calculated the energy, ΔEv, for forming an oxygen vacancy in the surface layer for two dopant positions: one near the site where the oxygen vacancy is formed and one away from it."
[2] "We find that the low-valence dopants (La and Y for CeO2 and Li and Na for MgO) have both a long-range and a short-range effect. High-valence dopants (Al, Sc, and Y) in MgO(001) slightly increase the energy of vacancy formation next to them, with the exception of Ga, which behaves differently because it is reduced when the vacancy is formed."
[3] "In the case of TiO2, the position of the polarons can substantially change the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation. We have examined a few polaron locations when an oxygen vacancy is made in doped ceria and found the effect of their location to be small (0.20.3 eV)."
[4] "We found that these dopants do not affect the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a large distance (Table 1)."
[5] "One common feature of these dopants is that their bond to oxygen, in their own oxide, is much shorter than the bond between Ce and oxygen in CeO2."

The document also mentions that the position of polarons in oxygen vacancies in doped ceria has a minimal impact on the energy of vacancy formation. Furthermore, it notes that dopants affecting the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation do not necessarily correlate with the strength of their bond to oxygen in their own oxides, partly due to the Ce ion's ability to change its formal charge easily. Lastly, the document emphasizes that Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W do not affect the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a large distance, despite changing the Fermi level.

文档讨论了掺杂剂对金属氧化物催化性能的影响，重点关注低价掺杂剂（LVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）如何影响表面层中氧空位形成所需的能量。它强调了LVD，如CeO2中的La和Y以及MgO中的Li和Na，表现出局部和全球效应，改变靠近和远离掺杂剂的氧空位形成能。相比之下，MgO(001)中的HVD，如Al、Sc和Y，倾向于增加附近氧空位形成的能量，除了Ga，由于形成氧空位时的还原作用而表现出不同行为。文档还提到，在掺杂铈化物中的氧空位位置上的极化子的影响非常小。此外，它指出，影响氧空位形成能的掺杂剂与它们在自己氧化物中的氧键强度之间没有必然的相关性，部分原因是铈离子可以轻松地改变其形式电荷。最后，文档强调了Pt、Ru、Zr、Nb、Ta、Mo和W在远距离上不会影响氧空位形成能，尽管它们改变了费米能级。
