[1] "The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."
[2] "We find that low-valence dopants (Na and Li dopants in MgO and La and Y dopants in CeO2) have both a long-range and a short-range effect."
[3] "The only stable oxide of Ta is Ta2O5, and therefore, Ta is a pentavalent dopant, and when used to dope ceria, it is an HVD."
[4] "It is also important to keep in mind that Ce can readily adjust its valence in response to changes in conditions; besides Ce2O3 and CeO2, the following oxides are stable under various oxygen pressures and temperatures: CeO1.714, CeO1.778, CeO1.800, and CeO1.818."
[5] "The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopantoxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on ΔEv is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3."

The document explores how dopants influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Specifically, it discusses the effects of low-valence dopants (LVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for catalytic activity. LVDs, like La and Y in ceria, have both a local and global impact, affecting the energy of oxygen vacancy formation near and far from the dopant. HVDs, such as Ta, generally increase the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, except for Ga-doped magnesium oxide, which surprisingly reduces the energy. The study also highlights the importance of considering the valence of dopants and their ability to bind oxygen, noting that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation is influenced by the bond strength between the dopant and oxygen atoms in their respective oxides. Additionally, the document mentions the flexibility of cerium ions in adjusting their formal charge, which plays a role in the dopant's influence on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.

文档研究了掺杂剂对金属氧化物催化性能的影响。具体而言，它探讨了低价掺杂剂（LVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）如何影响表面氧空位形成所需的能量，这是预测氧化反应能力的关键因素。LVD，如铈氧化物中的镧和钇，既具有局部效应也具有全局效应，影响邻近和远离掺杂剂的氧空位形成能。HVD，如钽，通常增加氧空位形成能，除了镁氧化物中的镓掺杂，这出乎意料地降低了能级。研究还强调了考虑掺杂剂的电荷以及它们在各自氧化物中与氧原子的结合能力的重要性，指出氧化物中掺杂剂与氧原子之间的键强度影响氧空位形成能。此外，文档提到铈离子在不同氧压和温度下的灵活性，这对于理解掺杂剂对氧空位形成能的影响起着关键作用。
