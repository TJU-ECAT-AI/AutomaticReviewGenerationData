<p>The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopantoxygen bonds that are much shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria. This similarity is puzzling considering that the oxides of these dopants have vastly different enthalpies of formation.</p>
<p>An examination of the projected density of states (PDOS) shows that W and Mo donate two electrons to ceria to reduce two Ce atoms, and Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom. After this electron donation, these dopants have only four electrons available for making bonds, just like the Ce atom they replace. The other dopants (Ru, Zr, and Pt) do not donate electrons to reduce Ce, and therefore, they also have four electrons for making bonds. We speculate that this is one the reasons for the similarity of their effect on ΔEv. The other reason is that their bonds with oxygen, in their own oxides, is much shorter than the CeO bond in CeO2. When one of these dopants replaces a Ce atom, it pulls the oxygen atoms in the oxide surface toward it and away from cerium. By doing this, they weaken the bond of the oxygen to the surface.</p>

The dopants Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W all lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in CeO2(111) by a similar amount. They manage to shift oxygen atoms away from Ce to create bonds that are shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria. Despite their oxides having vastly different enthalpies of formation, the dopants have four electrons available for bonding, similar to the Ce atom they replace. W and Mo donate two electrons, Ta and Nb donate one electron, reducing Ce atoms. This electron donation leaves the dopants with four electrons for bonding, contributing to the similarity in their effect on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation. The shortening of metal-oxygen bonds when the dopants replace Ce atoms weakens the bond of oxygen to the surface.

Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Nb、Mo和W等掺杂剂在CeO2(111)中降低氧空位形成能的能量相似。它们将氧原子移向Ce，形成比ceria中的CeO键更短的键。尽管这些掺杂剂的氧化物具有截然不同的形成焓，但它们均具有与所取代的Ce原子相同的四个电子用于成键。Mo和W捐赠两个电子，Ta和Nb捐赠一个电子，减少Ce原子。这种电子捐赠使掺杂剂具有四个电子用于成键，这是它们在氧空位形成能上产生相似效应的原因之一。当这些掺杂剂取代Ce原子时，金属-氧键缩短，减弱了氧与表面的键合。
