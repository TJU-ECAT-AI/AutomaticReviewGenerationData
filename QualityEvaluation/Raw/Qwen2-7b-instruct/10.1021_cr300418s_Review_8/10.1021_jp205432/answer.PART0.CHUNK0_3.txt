[1] "The methods used in the present calculations are explained in section 2. Section 3 presents results on the energy of vacancy formation near and away from the dopant."
[2] "We find that the low-valence dopants (La and Y for CeO2 and Li and Na for MgO) have both a long-range and a short-range effect."
[3] "High-valence dopants (Al, Sc, and Y) in MgO(001) slightly increase the energy of vacancy formation next to them, with the exception of Ga, which behaves differently because it is reduced when the vacancy is formed."
[4] "We speculate that Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W dopants have a similar effect on the energy of vacancy formation because they are all effectively tetravalent, like the Ce atom they replace."
[5] "The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopantoxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on ΔEv is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3."

The study explores how dopants influence the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in ceria and magnesium oxide. It distinguishes between low-valence dopants (LVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs), noting that LVDs have both local and global effects on oxygen-vacancy formation, whereas HVDs primarily have a local effect. The research identifies Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W dopants as having a similar impact on oxygen-vacancy formation because they are effectively tetravalent, akin to the cerium atom they replace. The lack of correlation between the dopant's bond strength in its own oxide and its effect on oxygen-vacancy formation is explained by the ease with which cerium ions can alter their formal charge from +4 to +3.

研究探讨了掺杂剂如何影响氧化铈和镁氧化物中氧空位形成能。它区分了低价掺杂剂（LVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD），发现LVD既有局部效应也有全局效应，而HVD主要具有局部效应。研究确认了铂、钌、锆、铌、钽、钼和钨掺杂剂对氧空位形成能有相似的影响，因为它们在氧化物中的价态类似于它们取代的铈原子。缺乏掺杂剂自身氧化物中键强度与其对氧空位形成能影响之间的相关性，部分原因是铈离子可以轻松地将正式电荷从+4改变为+3。
