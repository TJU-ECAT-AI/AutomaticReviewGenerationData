[1] "In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."
[2] "Active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen."
[3] "Early work on model Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies with catalytic activity for CO oxidation."
[4] "These bilayer Au structures have been shown to bind CO approximately 50% more strongly than bulk Au."
[5] "Furthermore oxygen either alone or in a reaction mixture has been shown to promote sintering of these bilayer Au structures."
[6] "A recent model study has demonstrated that a coordinatively unsaturated, continuous Au bilayer structure that precludes access of the reactant to the support, exhibits an exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation."
[7] "The activity of this Au bilayer film is more than an order of magnitude more active than any previous report on a per Au atom basis."
[8] "In the late seventies and eighties considerable attention was given to the unusual properties of metals supported on TiO2 when reduced at relatively high temperatures, results first reported by Tauster et al. for supported Pt and Ir [20], and designated as strong metal-support interaction (SMSI)."
[9] "For example, Tauster et al. [20,21] showed that H2 and CO chemisorption on highly dispersed titania-supported catalysts was suppressed."
[10] "Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal [34]."
[11] "With SMSI electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal."
[12] "When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption for various metals."
[13] "Oxidative environments reoxidize the reduced TiOx support and reverse the SMSI effect [30]."
[14] "There is one outstanding discrepancy in the comparison of SMSI and catalytically active Au. This discrepancy is the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx, perhaps TiO, onto the supported metal causing inhibition of chemisorption and modified catalytic properties."
[15] "For Au on titania an oxidizing environment re-oxidizes the TiOx support [41] causing de-wetting and sintering of the Au."

1. The document discusses how active gold (Au) on titanium dioxide (TiO2) spreads to form a bilayer structure, which is electron-rich, nucleates on reduced Ti defects at temperatures above 750 K, and becomes deactivated through sintering in an oxygen environment. This behavior is similar to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) involving Group VIII metals, indicating a close relationship between the two phenomena. The bilayer Au structure binds CO more strongly than bulk Au and can be promoted by oxygen, enhancing its activity for catalytic CO oxidation.

2. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) phenomenon involves the spreading of metal on the support at high temperatures, strong bonding between the metal and reduced support, electron transfer from the support to the metal leading to an electron-rich metal, and the suppression of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO) chemisorption. In contrast, active Au on TiO2 exhibits enhanced CO binding and catalytic activity, which might differ from the effects observed in SMSI for Group VIII metals due to differences in electronic interactions between the metal and support.

3. The discrepancies between SMSI and catalytically active Au include the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx species onto the supported metal, inhibiting chemisorption and altering catalytic properties. For Au on TiO2, inspection reveals an enhancement of reduced titania species at the active catalyst interface, potentially due to the critical role of defect sites in wetting the support. This could be misinterpreted as TiOx formation on the cluster, affecting predictions about dopant behavior in metal oxides.

4. The challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in metal oxides, considering factors like Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), stem from inconsistencies in how dopants influence catalytic performance. While computational and experimental studies provide insights into specific cases, they often fail to capture the complexity of dopant interactions across different materials and conditions. The reliance on empirical data and the need for detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms limit the development of universally applicable rules.

1. 文档讨论了活性金(Au)在二氧化钛(TiO2)上的行为，它形成双层结构，并且是电子丰富的。这种行为发生在将温度加热到750K以上以产生Ti缺陷的情况下，并且在氧气环境中通过烧结而失效。这与包括第VIII族金属在内的强金属支持相互作用(SMSI)的现象密切相关，表明这两种现象关系密切。双层Au结构比块状Au更强烈地吸附CO，并且可以通过氧气促进其活性，从而增强其CO氧化催化活性。

2. SMSI现象涉及金属在高温下扩散至支撑物表面，金属和还原支撑物之间的强烈结合，从支撑物向金属转移电子导致金属电子丰富，以及氢和一氧化碳(CO)吸附抑制。相比之下，Au在TiO2上表现出增强的CO吸附和催化活性，这可能与使用第VIII族金属时观察到的效果有所不同，因为金属和支撑物之间的电子相互作用存在差异。

3. SMSI和活性Au之间的差异包括认为SMSI是由还原TiOx物种迁移至支撑金属，从而抑制吸附并改变催化性质的主张。对于Au在TiO2上的情况，检查显示活跃催化剂界面处还原二氧化钛物种的增加，可能由于缺陷位点在湿润支撑物表面中的关键作用。这可能导致误解为簇上的TiOx形成，影响对掺杂行为的一般预测。

4. 形成适用于不同材料和条件的通用规则的挑战在于确定掺杂剂如何影响催化性能时面临的复杂性。尽管计算和实验研究提供了特定情况的见解，但它们往往无法捕捉到掺杂剂交互的复杂性。依赖于经验数据和对底层机制的详细理解限制了通用规则的发展。
