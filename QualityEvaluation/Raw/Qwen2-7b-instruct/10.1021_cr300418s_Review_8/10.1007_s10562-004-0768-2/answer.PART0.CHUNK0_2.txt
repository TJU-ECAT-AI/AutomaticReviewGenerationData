In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related. That active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen, is convincing evidence that the same basic principles responsible for activation of Au on titania are operative for SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals.

The active Au on titania forms a bilayer structure, is electron-rich, nucleates on reduced Ti defects, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen, indicating that the same principles govern the activation of Au on titania as in the SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals.

活性Au在titania上形成双层结构，是电子丰富的，核化在退火到温度>750K产生的Ti缺陷上，并通过氧气中的烧结失活，这表明控制Au在titania激活的原理同样适用于Gr. VIII金属的SMSI。

Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical condition required to induce SMSI. This temperature has been shown to be sufficient to create surface defects in model studies of single crystal TiO2 [36] and to be critical in the nucleation and growth morphology of Au clusters [37]. A recent study of supported Au on titania has shown that catalysts prepared at temperatures near 800 K exhibit higher activity and higher dispersion.

Hydrogen reduction at 773 K typically induces SMSI. This temperature creates surface defects in model TiO2 studies [36] and is crucial for Au cluster nucleation and growth morphology [37]. Recent studies indicate that Au on titania catalysts prepared at around 800 K show increased activity and dispersion.

在773 K氢气还原通常引发SMSI。这一温度在单晶TiO2模型研究中能产生表面缺陷[36]，对Au簇的核聚和生长形态至关重要[37]。近期研究表明，约800 K下制备的Au在titania上的催化剂表现出更高的活性和分散性。
