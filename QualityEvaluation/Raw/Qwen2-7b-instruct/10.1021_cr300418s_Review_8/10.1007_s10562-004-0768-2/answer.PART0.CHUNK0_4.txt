[1] "That active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects made by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and sinters in the presence of oxygen is strong evidence that the same basic principles responsible for activation of Au on titania are respon- sible for SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals."
[2] "Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical condition required to induce SMSI."
[3] "Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal."
[4] "With SMSI electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal."
[5] "When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption for various metals."
[6] "Similarly, for Au on titania an oxidizing environment re-oxidizes the TiOx support causing de-wetting and sintering of the Au."
[7] "There is one outstanding discrepancy in the compar- ison of SMSI and catalytically active Au. This discrep- ancy is the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx, perhaps TiO, onto the supported metal causing inhibition of chemisorption and modified cata- lytic properties."
[8] "For Gr. VIII SMSI metals electron transfer from the support to the metal and the accompanying destabilization of the d-band may actually lead to a reduction in the metal back-bonding to CO."
[9] "Assuming this accumulation of defects at the cluster-support interface occurs as well during SMSI formation, this could easily be interpreted as TiOx formation on the cluster."
[10] "Likewise, an increase in the Ti feature in low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) as a function of anneal temperature, interpreted as migration of TiOx onto the metal, could be simply due to the improved accessibility of the probe ions to Ti because of the decrease in the oxygen stoichiometry during reduction."

1. Active Au on titania forms a bilayer structure, is electron-rich, nucleates on reduced Ti defects at high temperatures, and sinters in oxygen, indicating similarities between Au activation on titania and SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals.
2. Hydrogen reduction at 773 K typically induces SMSI.
3. SMSI leads to metal wetting of the support.
4. Electron transfer from the titania support to the metal results in an electron-rich metal during SMSI.
5. SMSI causes suppression of hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption for various metals.
6. An oxidizing environment reverses the SMSI effect by re-oxidizing the TiOx support, causing Au de-wetting and sintering.
7. The discrepancy in comparing SMSI and catalytically active Au involves the assertion that SMSI arises from metal migration onto the supported metal, affecting chemisorption and catalytic properties.
8. For Gr. VIII SMSI metals, electron transfer and d-band destabilization might reduce metal back-bonding to CO.
9. Accumulation of defects at the cluster-support interface during SMSI formation could be misinterpreted as TiOx formation on the cluster due to its transparency to electron probes.
10. An increase in the Ti feature in LEIS might indicate improved accessibility of probe ions to Ti rather than actual TiOx migration onto the metal, considering changes in oxygen stoichiometry during reduction.

1. 活性Au在titania上形成双层结构，电子富集，通过高温热处理和氧气作用下形成，表明Au在titania上的激活与Gr. VIII金属的SMSI现象有相似之处。
2. 773 K下的氢还原通常引发SMSI。
3. SMSI导致金属浸润支持表面。
4. 从titania支持到金属的电子转移产生电子富集的金属，在SMSI中。
5. SMSI导致氢气和一氧化碳化学吸附抑制，适用于各种金属。
6. 氧化环境通过重新氧化TiOx支持，导致Au去湿润和聚集，逆转SMSI效应。
7. 比较SMSI和催化活性Au的差异在于，SMSI被认为是由金属迁移至支持金属上引起化学吸附抑制和催化性质改变的主张。
8. 对于Gr. VIII SMSI金属，电子转移和d能级不稳定可能导致金属对CO的结合力降低。
9. 在SMSI形成过程中，簇-支持界面的缺陷积累可能被误认为是TiOx在簇上的形成，因为这种缺陷对于电子探针透明。
10. 低能离子散射光谱（LEIS）中Ti特征的增加可能是由于氧化学计量比变化期间，探针离子更易于接近Ti，而非实际的TiOx迁移到金属上。
