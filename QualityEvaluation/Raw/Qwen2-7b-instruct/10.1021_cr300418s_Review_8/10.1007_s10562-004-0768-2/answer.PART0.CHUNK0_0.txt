[1] "That active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen, is convincing evidence that the same basic principles responsible for activation of Au on titania are operative for SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals."
[2] "Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical condition required to induce SMSI."
[3] "Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal."
[4] "With SMSI electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal."
[5] "When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption for various metals."
[6] "Oxidative environments reoxidize the reduced TiOx support and reverse the SMSI effect."

1. Active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, which is electron-rich, nucleates on reduced Ti defects at temperatures above 750 K, and becomes deactivated through sintering in oxygen, providing evidence that the fundamental principles governing the activation of Au on titania are also applicable to SMSI involving Group VIII metals.

2. Reduction at 773 K typically initiates SMSI.

3. SMSI leads to the support being wetted by the metal.

4. During SMSI, electron transfer occurs from the titania support to the metal, resulting in an electron-rich metal.

5. Inducing SMSI suppresses hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption for various metals.

6. Oxidative conditions reoxidize the reduced TiOx support, reversing the SMSI effect.

1. 活性Au在titania上扩展形成双层结构，该结构电子丰富，通过理论和实验确定，在超过750 K的温度下在还原的Ti缺陷上形成，通过氧气中的烧结失活，这为Au在titania上的激活原则对涉及第VIII族金属的SMSI也适用提供了证据。

2. 在773 K的氢化物还原通常会引发SMSI。

3. SMSI导致支持被金属湿润。

4. 在SMSI期间，从titania支持到金属发生电子转移，导致金属电子丰富。

5. 引发SMSI抑制各种金属的氢和一氧化碳化学吸附。

6. 氧化环境重新氧化还原的TiOx支持，逆转了SMSI效应。
