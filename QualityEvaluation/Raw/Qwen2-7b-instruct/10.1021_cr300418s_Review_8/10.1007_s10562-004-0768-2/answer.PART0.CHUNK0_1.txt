"Catalytically active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen, is convincing evidence that the same basic principles responsible for activation of Au on titania are operative for SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals."
"In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."
"In summary the essential features of the interaction of Au with TiO2 that lead to enhanced catalytic activity are: (1) wetting of the support by the cluster; (2) strong bonding between the Au atoms at the interface with surface defects (reduced Ti sites); (3) electron-rich Au; (4) annealing at temperatures in excess of 750 K, sufficient to create and mobilize surface and bulk defects, is crucial in preparing an active catalyst; and (5) oxidation leads to deactivation via sintering of Au."

1. The interaction between catalytically active Au and titania leads to the formation of a bilayer structure, which is electron-rich. This structure nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures greater than 750 K. Oxidation in an oxygen environment causes the deactivation of Au through sintering.

2. There are several parallels between the behavior of catalytically active Au on titania and the SMSI effect observed in Gr. VIII metals. These include wetting of the support by the metal, strong bonding between the metal and reduced Ti sites, electron-rich Au, and the requirement of annealing at temperatures above 750 K to induce the SMSI effect. Oxidative environments can reverse the SMSI effect by reoxidizing the support and causing de-wetting and sintering of the Au.

3. The essential features for the activation of both systems involve a strong interaction between the metal and defects formed at the surface of the reduced support at elevated temperatures, followed by de-wetting and sintering of the metal in an oxidizing environment.

1. 活性Au与二氧化钛之间的相互作用导致形成双层结构，该结构电子丰富。这种结构在高于750 K的温度下通过退火在Ti缺陷上核化。在氧气环境中氧化导致Au失活通过聚集。

2. 活性Au在二氧化钛上的行为与Gr. VIII金属的SMSI现象有多个相似之处。这些包括金属对支持的湿润、金属和还原Ti位点之间的强烈结合、电子丰富的Au以及要求在高于750 K的温度下退火以诱导SMSI效应。氧化环境可以通过重新氧化支持并导致金属脱湿和聚集来逆转SMSI效应。

3. 两种系统激活的关键特征涉及在高温下支持表面形成的金属和缺陷之间的强烈相互作用，随后在氧化环境中金属脱湿和聚集。
