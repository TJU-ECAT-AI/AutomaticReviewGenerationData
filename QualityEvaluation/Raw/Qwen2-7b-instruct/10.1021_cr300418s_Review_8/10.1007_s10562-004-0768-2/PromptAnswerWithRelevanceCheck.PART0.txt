"Catalytically active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen, is convincing evidence that the same basic principles responsible for activation of Au on titania are operative for SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals."
"In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."
"In summary the essential features of the interaction of Au with TiO2 that lead to enhanced catalytic activity are: (1) wetting of the support by the cluster; (2) strong bonding between the Au atoms at the interface with surface defects (reduced Ti sites); (3) electron-rich Au; (4) annealing at temperatures in excess of 750 K, sufficient to create and mobilize surface and bulk defects, is crucial in preparing an active catalyst; and (5) oxidation leads to deactivation via sintering of Au."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The interaction between catalytically active Au and titania leads to the formation of a bilayer structure, which is electron-rich. This structure nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures greater than 750 K. Oxidation in an oxygen environment causes the deactivation of Au through sintering.

2. There are several parallels between the behavior of catalytically active Au on titania and the SMSI effect observed in Gr. VIII metals. These include wetting of the support by the metal, strong bonding between the metal and reduced Ti sites, electron-rich Au, and the requirement of annealing at temperatures above 750 K to induce the SMSI effect. Oxidative environments can reverse the SMSI effect by reoxidizing the support and causing de-wetting and sintering of the Au.

3. The essential features for the activation of both systems involve a strong interaction between the metal and defects formed at the surface of the reduced support at elevated temperatures, followed by de-wetting and sintering of the metal in an oxidizing environment.

Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical condition required to induce SMSI. This temperature has been shown to be sufficient to create surface defects in model studies of single crystal TiO2 [36] and to be critical in the nucleation and growth morphology of Au clusters [37]. A recent study of supported Au on titania has shown that catalysts prepared at temperatures near 800 K exhibit higher activity and higher dispersion.

1. The document discusses how active gold (Au) on titanium dioxide (TiO2) spreads to form a bilayer structure, which is electron-rich, nucleates on reduced Ti defects at temperatures above 750 K, and becomes deactivated through sintering in an oxygen environment. This behavior is similar to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) involving Group VIII metals, indicating a close relationship between the two phenomena. The bilayer Au structure binds CO more strongly than bulk Au and can be promoted by oxygen, enhancing its activity for catalytic CO oxidation.

2. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) phenomenon involves the spreading of metal on the support at high temperatures, strong bonding between the metal and reduced support, electron transfer from the support to the metal leading to an electron-rich metal, and the suppression of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO) chemisorption. In contrast, active Au on TiO2 exhibits enhanced CO binding and catalytic activity, which might differ from the effects observed in SMSI for Group VIII metals due to differences in electronic interactions between the metal and support.

3. The discrepancies between SMSI and catalytically active Au include the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx species onto the supported metal, inhibiting chemisorption and altering catalytic properties. For Au on TiO2, inspection reveals an enhancement of reduced titania species at the active catalyst interface, potentially due to the critical role of defect sites in wetting the support. This could be misinterpreted as TiOx formation on the cluster, affecting predictions about dopant behavior in metal oxides.

4. The challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in metal oxides, considering factors like Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), stem from inconsistencies in how dopants influence catalytic performance. While computational and experimental studies provide insights into specific cases, they often fail to capture the complexity of dopant interactions across different materials and conditions. The reliance on empirical data and the need for detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms limit the development of universally applicable rules.

1. 文档讨论了活性金(Au)在二氧化钛(TiO2)上的行为，它形成双层结构，并且是电子丰富的。这种行为发生在将温度加热到750K以上以产生Ti缺陷的情况下，并且在氧气环境中通过烧结而失效。这与包括第VIII族金属在内的强金属支持相互作用(SMSI)的现象密切相关，表明这两种现象关系密切。双层Au结构比块状Au更强烈地吸附CO，并且可以通过氧气促进其活性，从而增强其CO氧化催化活性。

2. SMSI现象涉及金属在高温下扩散至支撑物表面，金属和还原支撑物之间的强烈结合，从支撑物向金属转移电子导致金属电子丰富，以及氢和一氧化碳(CO)吸附抑制。相比之下，Au在TiO2上表现出增强的CO吸附和催化活性，这可能与使用第VIII族金属时观察到的效果有所不同，因为金属和支撑物之间的电子相互作用存在差异。

3. SMSI和活性Au之间的差异包括认为SMSI是由还原TiOx物种迁移至支撑金属，从而抑制吸附并改变催化性质的主张。对于Au在TiO2上的情况，检查显示活跃催化剂界面处还原二氧化钛物种的增加，可能由于缺陷位点在湿润支撑物表面中的关键作用。这可能导致误解为簇上的TiOx形成，影响对掺杂行为的一般预测。

4. 形成适用于不同材料和条件的通用规则的挑战在于确定掺杂剂如何影响催化性能时面临的复杂性。尽管计算和实验研究提供了特定情况的见解，但它们往往无法捕捉到掺杂剂交互的复杂性。依赖于经验数据和对底层机制的详细理解限制了通用规则的发展。
