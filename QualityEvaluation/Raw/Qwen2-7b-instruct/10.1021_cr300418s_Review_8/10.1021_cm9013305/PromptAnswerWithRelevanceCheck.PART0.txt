<p>The amount of evolved H2 is calculated by calibrating the GC signal for evolved hydrogen signal against the H2 signal for known composition of H2 in N2. The hydrogen generation plot is shown for three cycles in Figure 6ac at 65 C.</p>
<p>There is a good agreement in amount of generated H2 estimated by GC experiment and estimated gravimetrically by CuO reduction to Cu.</p>
<p>There is no significant variation in lattice parameters of the material before and after several cycling.</p>
<p>Cr ion-substituted CeO2 is not conducting. In fact, it is insulating and Cr ion is in an insulating environment as in Cr2O3.</p>
<p>So from XPS study presence of Cr ion in 4+ and 6+ state in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 is confirmed.</p>
<p>Further electronic state of Cr ion in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 is also investigated by Raman spectroscopy.</p>
<p>Raman band at 462 cm-1 in Figure 10(a) is assigned as phonon mode stretching for symmetric breathing mode of oxygen atoms around cerium atom.</p>
<p>There is no band observed at 543 cm1, which is characteristic band for Cr2O3.</p>
<p>So Raman spectroscopy study also reveals the absence of Cr3+ and presence of Cr6+ in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11.</p>
<p>Ce(3d) spectrum of the compound after hydrogen generation cycle also shows that Ce is only in 4+ state with Ce(3d5/2) at 881.8 eV and a characteristic satellite peak at 916.8 eV.</p>
<p>That is why compound shows reversible oxygen release and intake by H2O absorption and subsequent hydrogen release to gain the parent structure.</p>

The document discusses the use of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 as a catalyst for generating hydrogen through the thermochemical splitting of water. The compound releases a significant amount of lattice oxygen at relatively low temperatures (465°C), enabling the generation of hydrogen at much lower temperatures (65°C). This is attributed to the compound's unique structure and the coupling between the Ce4+/Ce3+ and Cr4+/Cr6+/Cr3+ redox couples, which allows for reversible oxygen release and intake. The study also highlights that the compound can be used for the generation of hydrogen at very low temperatures by thermo-chemical splitting of water, demonstrating its potential as an efficient hydrogen production catalyst. The document further explains that the reversible nature of oxygen release and intake is due to the compound's fluorite structure, which facilitates the transfer of electrons between the redox couples. The study provides detailed experimental evidence, including XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy, to support these findings and elucidate the mechanism of hydrogen generation. The results suggest that Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 could be a promising material for hydrogen production from water, offering a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solution.

<p>The compound Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 shows high oxygen storage capacity and oxygen release by heating in air. The compound (Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.11) was heated under flow of He and gaseous products were analyzed by means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer. There were no additional peaks observed except O2 evolution with M/e at 32 was indeed observed, which was increasing with increasing temperature.</p>
<p>Oxygen evolution in this material starts around 200 C. To see the nature and the amount of oxygen evolution, TGA of the sample is done in UHP N2. From the TG curve in Figure 3, it is clear that weight loss is continuous after 200 C, a small plateau is found around 450 C, and then fast weight loss is observed. The weight loss is around 1.1% up to 450 C, which is equivalent to 0.1 mol of [O]. From TGA plot, the total weight loss up to 550 C is 3.1%, which corresponds to 0.28 mol of O/mol of compound. We have chosen oxygen removal experiment at 465 C because weight loss is fast after 450 C and the compound is also stable at this temperature.</p>
<p>By taking 144.8 as the molecular weight of compound Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11, the amount of [O] released are 0.148, 0.186, and 0.163 M [O]/mol of oxide, respectively, for first, third, and fifth cycles. Average oxygen release with six consecutive cycles is 0.167 mol of O/mol of oxide.</p>
<p>For H2 generation, compound is heated in a N2 flow at 465 C until oxygen evolution stops completely. Water vapor is passed along with N2 and compound is cooled up to 50 C under water vapor but no H2 signal is detected, we stopped the water vapor flow and under N2 flow only we heated the compound at 65 C and hydrogen evolution was observed. Compound is heated at this temperature until the H2 signal stopped. The H2 signal observed after stopping the water vapor flow and heating under N2 only because in the presence of high partial pressure of H2O vapor, H2O dissociation does not occur; similarly, no H2 detection/release is observed when water vapor is passed at higher temperature (450 C).</p>
<p>There is a good agreement in amount of generated H2 estimated by GC experiment and estimated gravimetrically by CuO reduction to Cu.</p>
<p>There is no significant variation in lattice parameters of the material before and after several cycling.</p>
<p>XPS spectra of Cr(2p) and Ce(3d) region of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 after 8 cycles of H2 generations is shown in Figures 8a and 9a, respectively. XPS of Cr(2p) and Ce(3d) region of as-prepared Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 sample before cycling is also given for comparison in Figures 8b and 9b, respectively.</p>
<p>Raman spectra of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 and pure CeO2 are given in Figure 10 (a) and (b) respectively.</p>
<p>The mechanism of H2 generation is represented in Figure 11 and the reaction can be described as follows:</p>

The study reports the development of a new material, Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11, which demonstrates high oxygen storage capacity and can release oxygen at relatively low temperatures (around 465°C). This material can be used to generate hydrogen from water splitting at a low temperature (65°C). The release and intake of oxygen in the material are attributed to the coupling between the Ce4+/Ce3+ and Cr4+/Cr6+/Cr3+ redox couples in its fluorite structure.

Computational and experimental studies have helped elucidate how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. The insights gained suggest that dopants can alter the redox potentials, affecting the material's performance in various catalytic applications. However, challenges persist in predicting the behavior of dopants universally across different oxide systems due to the complexity of interactions between the dopants, the host oxide, and external conditions.

In conclusion, the material Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 exhibits promising catalytic properties for hydrogen generation via thermochimical splitting of water, offering a potential solution for sustainable hydrogen production. The study contributes to the broader understanding of dopant effects on metal oxide catalysts and highlights the importance of considering the host oxide's nature and redox potentials in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior.

The document describes the catalytic properties of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 in relation to oxygen evolution and hydrogen generation. The material releases a significant amount of oxygen at a relatively low temperature of 465°C, enabling the generation of hydrogen at a much lower temperature of 65°C. The redox potential of the CeIV/CeIII (1.61 V) and CrVI/CrIII (1.33 V) couples contribute to the reversible oxygen release and intake, which is attributed to the material's fluorite structure. The presence of Cr ions in both +4 and +6 oxidation states enhances the material's oxygen storage capacity and catalytic activity. The document also discusses the structural stability of the material during multiple cycles of hydrogen generation and the confirmation of Cr ions in both +4 and +6 states through XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The mechanism of hydrogen generation involves the reduction of CrVI to CrIII, facilitated by the CeIV reduction, leading to the release of oxygen and the subsequent hydrogen evolution upon water splitting.

The document discusses how the introduction of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) in metal oxides can significantly alter their catalytic properties. For instance, the presence of Cr4+/Cr6+ ions in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 enhances the oxygen storage capacity and enables reversible oxygen release and intake, facilitating hydrogen generation at lower temperatures. This is attributed to the unique redox potentials of CeIV/CeIII and CrVI/CrIII, which allow for the efficient conversion of oxygen and hydrogen. The study highlights that the nature of the dopant and the host oxide play crucial roles in determining the performance of the catalyst in various applications. However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of interactions between dopants and the host material, including Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the oxide.

The key challenges in predicting dopant behavior include understanding the precise mechanisms of dopant incorporation, assessing the impact of dopant valence and concentration, and accounting for the dynamic changes in the material's electronic structure upon doping. Computational methods and experimental techniques, such as XPS and Raman spectroscopy, offer insights into these processes but require further development to enable accurate predictions of dopant effects on catalytic performance.

In summary, while the introduction of dopants can significantly enhance the catalytic properties of metal oxides, formulating general rules for their behavior remains a complex task due to the intricate interplay between dopant chemistry, material structure, and electronic properties.
