<p>The compound Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 shows high oxygen storage capacity and oxygen release by heating in air. The compound (Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.11) was heated under flow of He and gaseous products were analyzed by means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer. There were no additional peaks observed except O2 evolution with M/e at 32 was indeed observed, which was increasing with increasing temperature.</p>
<p>Oxygen evolution in this material starts around 200 C. To see the nature and the amount of oxygen evolution, TGA of the sample is done in UHP N2. From the TG curve in Figure 3, it is clear that weight loss is continuous after 200 C, a small plateau is found around 450 C, and then fast weight loss is observed. The weight loss is around 1.1% up to 450 C, which is equivalent to 0.1 mol of [O]. From TGA plot, the total weight loss up to 550 C is 3.1%, which corresponds to 0.28 mol of O/mol of compound. We have chosen oxygen removal experiment at 465 C because weight loss is fast after 450 C and the compound is also stable at this temperature.</p>
<p>By taking 144.8 as the molecular weight of compound Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11, the amount of [O] released are 0.148, 0.186, and 0.163 M [O]/mol of oxide, respectively, for first, third, and fifth cycles. Average oxygen release with six consecutive cycles is 0.167 mol of O/mol of oxide.</p>
<p>For H2 generation, compound is heated in a N2 flow at 465 C until oxygen evolution stops completely. Water vapor is passed along with N2 and compound is cooled up to 50 C under water vapor but no H2 signal is detected, we stopped the water vapor flow and under N2 flow only we heated the compound at 65 C and hydrogen evolution was observed. Compound is heated at this temperature until the H2 signal stopped. The H2 signal observed after stopping the water vapor flow and heating under N2 only because in the presence of high partial pressure of H2O vapor, H2O dissociation does not occur; similarly, no H2 detection/release is observed when water vapor is passed at higher temperature (450 C).</p>
<p>There is a good agreement in amount of generated H2 estimated by GC experiment and estimated gravimetrically by CuO reduction to Cu.</p>
<p>There is no significant variation in lattice parameters of the material before and after several cycling.</p>
<p>XPS spectra of Cr(2p) and Ce(3d) region of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 after 8 cycles of H2 generations is shown in Figures 8a and 9a, respectively. XPS of Cr(2p) and Ce(3d) region of as-prepared Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 sample before cycling is also given for comparison in Figures 8b and 9b, respectively.</p>
<p>Raman spectra of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 and pure CeO2 are given in Figure 10 (a) and (b) respectively.</p>
<p>The mechanism of H2 generation is represented in Figure 11 and the reaction can be described as follows:</p>

The study reports the development of a new material, Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11, which demonstrates high oxygen storage capacity and can release oxygen at relatively low temperatures (around 465°C). This material can be used to generate hydrogen from water splitting at a low temperature (65°C). The release and intake of oxygen in the material are attributed to the coupling between the Ce4+/Ce3+ and Cr4+/Cr6+/Cr3+ redox couples in its fluorite structure. The material can be utilized for generating hydrogen at very low temperatures by thermochimical splitting of water. The research also explores the reversible oxygen release and intake of this material, highlighting its potential for hydrogen generation applications. The material shows a comparable amount of oxygen release and hydrogen generation at lower temperatures compared to other CeO2-based mixed-oxide solid solutions.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in metal oxides, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), remain. The study of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 provides insights into the effects of dopants like chromium (Cr) on the catalytic properties of cerium oxide (CeO2), particularly in terms of oxygen storage capacity, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen generation. Computational and experimental studies have helped elucidate how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. The insights gained suggest that dopants can alter the redox potentials, affecting the material's performance in various catalytic applications. However, challenges persist in predicting the behavior of dopants universally across different oxide systems due to the complexity of interactions between the dopants, the host oxide, and external conditions.

In conclusion, the material Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 exhibits promising catalytic properties for hydrogen generation via thermochimical splitting of water, offering a potential solution for sustainable hydrogen production. The study contributes to the broader understanding of dopant effects on metal oxide catalysts and highlights the importance of considering the host oxide's nature and redox potentials in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior.
