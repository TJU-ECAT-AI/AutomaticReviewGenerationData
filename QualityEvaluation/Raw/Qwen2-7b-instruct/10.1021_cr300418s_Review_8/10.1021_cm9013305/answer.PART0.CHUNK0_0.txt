<p>The amount of evolved H2 is calculated by calibrating the GC signal for evolved hydrogen signal against the H2 signal for known composition of H2 in N2. The hydrogen generation plot is shown for three cycles in Figure 6ac at 65 C.</p>
<p>There is a good agreement in amount of generated H2 estimated by GC experiment and estimated gravimetrically by CuO reduction to Cu.</p>
<p>There is no significant variation in lattice parameters of the material before and after several cycling.</p>
<p>Cr ion-substituted CeO2 is not conducting. In fact, it is insulating and Cr ion is in an insulating environment as in Cr2O3.</p>
<p>So from XPS study presence of Cr ion in 4+ and 6+ state in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 is confirmed.</p>
<p>Further electronic state of Cr ion in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 is also investigated by Raman spectroscopy.</p>
<p>Raman band at 462 cm-1 in Figure 10(a) is assigned as phonon mode stretching for symmetric breathing mode of oxygen atoms around cerium atom.</p>
<p>There is no band observed at 543 cm1, which is characteristic band for Cr2O3.</p>
<p>So Raman spectroscopy study also reveals the absence of Cr3+ and presence of Cr6+ in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11.</p>
<p>Ce(3d) spectrum of the compound after hydrogen generation cycle also shows that Ce is only in 4+ state with Ce(3d5/2) at 881.8 eV and a characteristic satellite peak at 916.8 eV.</p>
<p>That is why compound shows reversible oxygen release and intake by H2O absorption and subsequent hydrogen release to gain the parent structure.</p>
<p>So with these details, the mechanism of H2 generation is represented in Figure 11 and the reaction can be described as follows.</p>

The document discusses the use of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 as a catalyst for generating hydrogen through the thermochemical splitting of water. The compound releases a significant amount of lattice oxygen at relatively low temperatures (465°C), enabling the generation of hydrogen at much lower temperatures (65°C). This is attributed to the compound's unique structure and the coupling between the Ce4+/Ce3+ and Cr4+/Cr6+/Cr3+ redox couples, which allows for reversible oxygen release and intake. The study also highlights that the compound can be used for the generation of hydrogen at very low temperatures by thermo-chemical splitting of water, demonstrating its potential as an efficient hydrogen production catalyst. The document further explains that the reversible nature of oxygen release and intake is due to the compound's fluorite structure, which facilitates the transfer of electrons between the redox couples. The study provides detailed experimental evidence, including XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy, to support these findings and elucidate the mechanism of hydrogen generation. The results suggest that Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 could be a promising material for hydrogen production from water, offering a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solution.

文档讨论了使用Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11作为水热化学分解制氢的催化剂。该化合物在相对较低的温度（465°C）下释放大量晶格氧，从而在更低的温度（65°C）下生成氢气。这归因于化合物的独特结构和Ce4+/Ce3+与Cr4+/Cr6+/Cr3+电荷转移对之间的耦合，这使得氧气的释放和吸收具有可逆性。研究还表明，该化合物可以用于通过水热化学分解制氢，显示出在非常低的温度下生产氢气的潜力。文档进一步解释说，氧气释放和吸收的可逆性是由于化合物的氟化物结构，它促进了电荷转移对之间的电子转移。文档提供了详细的实验证据，包括X射线衍射、X射线光电子能谱和拉曼光谱，以支持这些发现并阐明氢生成机制。结果表明，Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11可能是生产水氢的一个有前景的材料，提供了一种可持续和环保的能源解决方案。
