<p>Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 being the only compound likes UO2+δ to have excess oxygen, it releases a large proportion of its lattice oxygen (0.167 M [O]/mole of compound) at relatively low temperature (465 C) directly and it has been utilized for generation of H2 by thermo-splitting of water.</p>
<p>There is an almost comparable amount of oxygen release and hydrogen generation over this material at very low temperature compared to other CeO2MOx (Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ni) mixed-oxide solid solutions (O2 evolution 1300 C and H2 generation at 1000 C).</p>
<p>The reversible nature of oxygen release and intake of this material is attributed to its fluorite structure and coupling between the Ce4+/Ce3+ and Cr4+/6+/Cr3+ redox couples.</p>
<p>Among these OSC materials, Ce0.67Cr0.33O2+δ not only has shown higher OSC capacity than Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 but it also releases lattice oxygen directly at much lower temperature (300 C).</p>
<p>Oxygen evolution in this material starts around 200 C.</p>
<p>Therefore, compound shows reversible oxygen release and intake by H2O absorption and subsequent hydrogen release to gain parent structure and hence this material can not only act as very high oxygen release/storage material but also can be utilized for generation of H2 by thermo-chemical splitting of water.</p>

The document describes the use of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 as a catalyst for generating hydrogen from water splitting. This material releases a large proportion of its lattice oxygen at relatively low temperatures (465°C), making it suitable for thermochemical splitting of water. It shows an almost comparable amount of oxygen release and hydrogen generation at low temperatures compared to other mixed-oxide solid solutions. The reversible nature of oxygen release and intake is attributed to its fluorite structure and the redox couples of Ce4+/Ce3+ and Cr4+/6+/Cr3+. This allows the material to act as both an oxygen release/storage material and a catalyst for hydrogen generation through water splitting.

文档描述了Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11作为水裂解产生氢气催化剂的应用。该材料在较低温度（465°C）下释放大量晶格氧，使其适合水的热化学分解。它在低温下显示与其它混合氧化物固体溶液相当的氧释放和氢生成量。氧释放和吸收的可逆性归因于其氟化物结构和Ce4+/Ce3+、Cr4+/6+/Cr3+的氧化还原对。这使得材料既能作为氧释放/存储材料，又能通过水裂解产生氢气作为催化剂。
