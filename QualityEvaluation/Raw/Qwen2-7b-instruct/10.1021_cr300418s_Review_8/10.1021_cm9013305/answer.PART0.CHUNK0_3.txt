<p>The oxygen evolution starts around 200 C.</p>
<p>To see the nature and the amount of oxygen evolution, TGA of the sample is done in UHP N2. From the TG curve in Figure 3, it is clear that weight loss is continuous after 200 C, a small plateau is found around 450 C, and then fast weight loss is observed.</p>
<p>Oxygen evolution in this material starts around 200 C.</p>
<p>For H2 generation, compound is heated in a N2 flow at 465 C until oxygen evolution stops completely.</p>
<p>The compound starts losing weight by heating in air and weight loss starts around 200 C.</p>
<p>There is no significant variation in lattice parameters of the material before and after several cycling.</p>
<p>Cr ion-substituted CeO2 is not conducting. In fact, it is insulating and Cr ion is in an insulating environment as in Cr2O3.</p>
<p>So from XPS study presence of Cr ion in 4+ and 6+ state in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 is confirmed.</p>
<p>Raman band at 462 cm-1 in Figure 10(a) is assigned as phonon mode stretching for symmetric breathing mode of oxygen atoms around cerium atom.</p>
<p>The reaction can be described as follows:</p>

The document describes the catalytic properties of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 in relation to oxygen evolution and hydrogen generation. The material releases a significant amount of oxygen at a relatively low temperature of 465°C, enabling the generation of hydrogen at a much lower temperature of 65°C. The redox potential of the CeIV/CeIII (1.61 V) and CrVI/CrIII (1.33 V) couples contribute to the reversible oxygen release and intake, which is attributed to the material's fluorite structure. The presence of Cr ions in both +4 and +6 oxidation states enhances the material's oxygen storage capacity and catalytic activity. The document also discusses the structural stability of the material during multiple cycles of hydrogen generation and the confirmation of Cr ions in both +4 and +6 states through XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The mechanism of hydrogen generation involves the reduction of CrVI to CrIII, facilitated by the CeIV reduction, leading to the release of oxygen and the subsequent hydrogen evolution upon water splitting.

文档描述了Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11在氧气演化和氢生成方面的催化性质。该材料在465°C相对较低的温度下释放大量氧气，从而能够在65°C的较低温度下生成氢气。CeIV/CeIII（1.61 V）和CrVI/CrIII（1.33 V）电对的还原潜力促进了氧气的可逆释放和吸收，这归因于材料的氟化物结构。Cr离子的存在促进了+4和+6氧化态的增强，提高了材料的氧存储容量和催化活性。文档还讨论了材料在多个氢生成周期中的结构稳定性以及通过XPS和拉曼光谱确认Cr离子在+4和+6状态的存在。机制表明，CrVI的还原到CrIII通过CeIV的还原促进，导致氧气释放和随后的水解反应中氢的产生。
