1. Computational studies have the advantage of being able to unambiguously prepare and analyze substitutionally doped oxides. However, experimental progress in creating doped oxide catalysts has been slow due to a lack of systematic methods for selecting dopant-host combinations and reliable synthetic techniques for placing dopants on the oxide surface.

2. Previous studies have examined how doping the surfaces of TiO2, CeO2, and ZnO affects their oxidative capacity. There was a belief that doped oxides might be less effective as catalysts compared to their undoped counterparts.

3. The catalytic cycle for CO oxidation involves the reductant reacting with the oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, leaving behind oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are filled by molecular oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

4. The authors suggest that the dopants, especially those with higher valence than zinc, tend to adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy their coordination needs. This can lead to enhanced oxidation reactions.

5. The presence of both 16O2 and 18O2 isotopes in the reaction products indicates that multiple reaction mechanisms are at play, producing CO2 isotopes of different masses.

6. Without performing specific calculations, it's difficult to determine which of the proposed mechanisms will dominate under varying conditions.

1. 计算机模拟可以明确无误地准备和研究掺杂氧化物，其优势在于能够准确进行此类分析。然而，由于缺乏系统的方法来选择掺杂剂-载体组合以及可靠的合成技术将掺杂剂放置在氧化物表面上，因此在创建掺杂氧化物催化剂方面的实验进展缓慢。

2. 前期研究探索了如何通过掺杂TiO2、CeO2和ZnO的表面来改变它们的氧化能力。人们曾认为，掺杂的氧化物可能不如其未掺杂的同位素作为催化剂有效。

3. 在大多数氧化反应中，还原剂与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，留下氧空位。这些空位随后由气体中的分子氧填充，完成催化循环。

4. 研究表明，尤其是那些比锌具有更高电荷的掺杂剂倾向于吸附气体中的氧气以满足其配位需求。这可能导致增强的氧化反应。

5. 反应产物中16O2和18O2两种同位素的共存表明存在多种反应机制，并且产生不同质量的CO2同位素。

6. 没有执行特定的计算，很难确定在不同条件下哪一种提出的机制将占主导地位。
