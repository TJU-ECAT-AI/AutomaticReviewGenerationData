1. Computational studies have the advantage of being able to unambiguously prepare and analyze substitutionally doped oxides. However, experimental progress in creating doped oxide catalysts has been slow due to a lack of systematic methods for selecting dopant-host combinations and reliable synthetic techniques for placing dopants on the oxide surface.

2. Previous studies have examined how doping the surfaces of TiO2, CeO2, and ZnO affects their oxidative capacity. There was a belief that doped oxides might be less effective as catalysts compared to their undoped counterparts.

3. The catalytic cycle for CO oxidation involves the reductant reacting with the oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, leaving behind oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are filled by molecular oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

4. The authors suggest that the dopants, especially those with higher valence than zinc, tend to adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy their coordination needs. This can lead to enhanced oxidation reactions.

5. The presence of both 16O2 and 18O2 isotopes in the reaction products indicates that multiple reaction mechanisms are at play, producing CO2 isotopes of different masses.

6. Without performing specific calculations, it's difficult to determine which of the proposed mechanisms will dominate under varying conditions.

1. 计算机模拟可以明确无误地准备和研究掺杂氧化物，其优势在于能够准确进行此类分析。然而，由于缺乏系统的方法来选择掺杂剂-载体组合以及可靠的合成技术将掺杂剂放置在氧化物表面上，因此在创建掺杂氧化物催化剂方面的实验进展缓慢。

2. 前期研究探索了如何通过掺杂TiO2、CeO2和ZnO的表面来改变它们的氧化能力。人们曾认为，掺杂的氧化物可能不如其未掺杂的同位素作为催化剂有效。

3. 在大多数氧化反应中，还原剂与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，留下氧空位。这些空位随后由气体中的分子氧填充，完成催化循环。

4. 研究表明，尤其是那些比锌具有更高电荷的掺杂剂倾向于吸附气体中的氧气以满足其配位需求。这可能导致增强的氧化反应。

5. 反应产物中16O2和18O2两种同位素的共存表明存在多种反应机制，并且产生不同质量的CO2同位素。

1. Substitutional doping of oxides allows quantum mechanical calculations to unambiguously prepare and study the dopants, hoping to discover useful catalysts in this class of compounds. It was initially thought that doped oxides might be less effective catalysts compared to undoped hosts. In the Marsvan Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, the reductant reacts with oxide surface oxygen atoms, not the gas phase oxygen. The gas phase oxygen prevents the complete reduction of the oxide by refilling the vacancies.

2. Doping oxides with high valence dopants (HVDs) enhances their catalytic properties, particularly in CO oxidation, by facilitating the adsorption and activation of gas-phase oxygen. This leads to reactions that differ from the traditional MVK mechanism.

3. There are four proposed mechanisms for CO oxidation on Ti- and Al-doped ZnO, involving adsorbed oxygen, carbonate formation, and oxygen vacancy creation. These mechanisms produce different CO2 isotopes depending on the oxygen source.

4. Mechanisms 1 and 2 involve the adsorption of oxygen on the dopant followed by reactions with CO, leading to CO2 production and oxygen vacancy formation. Mechanism 3 involves the formation of an oxalate before decomposition. Mechanism 4 suggests an oxygen atom from the surface moving onto the dopant, creating an oxygen vacancy and reacting with CO.

5. The presence of C16O2 suggests a Marsvan Krevelen-like mechanism, while C18O2 complicates the understanding. It is speculated that the oxygen atoms may rearrange upon the formation of carbonates or oxalates, potentially leading to the formation of C18O2.

6. Mechanism 4, involving the creation of an oxygen vacancy near the dopant, is less efficient than mechanisms 1–3, especially at high oxygen pressures, due to competition with oxygen adsorption on the dopant.

1. 替换掺杂氧化物允许量子力学计算明确准备和研究掺杂剂，希望在这个类化合物中发现有用的催化剂。最初认为掺杂的氧化物可能比未掺杂的主机更不具有催化性能。在MVK机制中，还原剂与氧化物表面氧原子反应，而不是气体相氧。气体相氧通过填充空位防止氧化物的完全还原。

2. 高价掺杂剂（HVD）在氧化物中的掺杂增强了其催化性能，特别是在CO氧化中，通过促进气体相氧的吸附和活化。这导致与传统MVK机制不同的反应。

3. 在Ti-和Al掺杂的ZnO上，CO氧化有四种提出的机制，涉及吸附氧、碳酸盐形成和氧空位形成。这些机制根据氧气来源的不同产生不同种类的CO2同位素。

4. 机制1和2涉及在掺杂剂处吸附氧随后与CO反应，产生CO2和氧空位形成。机制3涉及形成一个草酸盐，然后分解。机制4建议表面的一个氧原子移动到掺杂剂上，形成一个氧空位并与CO反应。

5. C16O2的存在表明存在类似于MVK机制的过程，而C18O2使理解复杂化。推测氧原子可能在形成碳酸盐或草酸盐后重新排列，可能导致形成C18O2。

6. 机制4，涉及在掺杂剂附近创建氧空位，效率低于机制1-3，尤其是在高氧压下，由于与掺杂剂上的氧吸附的竞争。
