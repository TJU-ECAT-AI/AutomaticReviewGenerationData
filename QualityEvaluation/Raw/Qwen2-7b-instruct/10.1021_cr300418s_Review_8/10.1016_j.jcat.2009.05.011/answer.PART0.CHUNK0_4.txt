<p>Most heterogeneous oxidation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place via the Mars and van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, in which the reductant (CO in our case) reacts with the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide [2,3,49].</p>
<p>The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination. If the dopants valence is satisfied by binding one oxygen atom of gas-phase O2,then the other O atom would be available for oxidizing a molecule.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the undercoordinated dopant will steal an oxygen atom from the surface of the host oxide. This atom will settle on top of the dopant, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy in the surface layer.</p>
<p>Oxygen activation by the dopant</p>
<p>In previous calculations [50], we have found that doping ZnO with Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, or W increases substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide; Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os and Ce have a similar, but less pronounced, effect. This indicates that these dopants are not satisfied with the number of oxygen atoms surrounding them and compensate by binding the neighboring oxygen more strongly.</p>
<p>3.3. Mechanism 3</p>
<p>A third possible pathway is illustrated in Fig. 3, which also starts with oxygen adsorption followed by reaction with CO to form a carbonate. The carbonate can then react with another CO to form an oxalate whose structure is shown in Fig. 3b. The oxalate decomposes to form CO2 and leaves an oxygen molecule on the dopant.</p>
<p>4.3. Catalyst testing</p>
<p>The activity of the metal oxide catalyst was measured in a packed bed reactor (PBR) using argon as a carrier gas and calibra- tion standard. The PBR was a 6 mm diameter glass tube, 300 mm in length, which was fitted inside an aluminum heating block. In a typical run approximately 250 mg of catalyst was used in an active reaction volume of 0.25 ml. The void fraction was approximately 82%. The volumetric flow rates of argon, carbon monoxide and oxy- gen were controlled by mass flow controllers (MKS).</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Heterogeneous oxidation reactions typically follow the MVK mechanism, where the reductant reacts with surface oxygen atoms. Doping oxides with certain elements can affect this mechanism.
2. Undercoordinated dopants tend to adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy their coordination needs.
3. Doping oxides like ZnO with high-valence elements can lead to the adsorption of oxygen molecules on the dopant atoms, facilitating oxidation reactions.
4. The activity of metal oxide catalysts is measured in packed bed reactors with controlled flow rates of gases.
5. CO oxidation tests on doped and undoped ZnO reveal enhanced activity for the doped samples at lower temperatures.
