[1] "Quantum mechanical calculations have the advantage that they can unambiguously prepare and study substitutionally doped oxides."
[2] "Given the large number of possible dopant-oxide pairs, it is hoped that some useful catalysts may be found in this class of compounds."
[3] "Experimental progress in creating doped oxide catalysts has been slow, since there has been no systematic method for selecting dopant-host combinations and there are no sure-fire synthetic methods for placing substitutional dopants at the surface of the oxide."
[4] "Most heterogeneous oxidation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place via the Mars and van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, in which the reductant (CO in our case) reacts with the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide."
[5] "In the case of ZnO, many dopants increase the energy that is necessary for removing an oxygen atom from the surface."
[6] "The oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide, indicating that the dopant is undercoordinated."
[7] "This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination."
[8] "Another possibility is that the undercoordinated dopant will steal an oxygen atom from the surface of the host oxide."
[9] "To prove that CO is oxidized by O2 adsorbed from the gas phase, we have performed the oxidation reaction with gas-phase 18O2."
[10] "Unfortunately, this argument does not rule out the possibility that we have prepared molecule-sized clusters of AlOx or TiOx supported on the surface of ZnO."

[12] "The formation of three CO2 isotopes indicates that several distinct reaction mechanisms are at work in this system."
[13] "We have used solgel synthesis to attempt the preparation of high-surface-area ZnO atomically doped with Al or Ti."
[14] "We have chosen to work with Ti, Al and Zn because TiO2, Al2O3, or ZnO does not oxidize CO at temperatures below 450 C, where we perform our experiments."
[15] "Unfortunately, this argument does not rule out the possibility that we have prepared molecule-sized clusters of AlOx or TiOx supported on the surface of ZnO."
[16] "Tests performed with a (3  4) super-cell show that an increase in slab thickness and super-cell size changes the adsorption energies by less than 0.05 eV."
[17] "We have used solgel synthesis to attempt the preparation of high-surface-area ZnO atomically doped with Al or Ti."
[18] "The net result is that the dopant adsorbs and activates O2 from the gas phase, promoting oxidation reactions."
[19] "This mechanism explains the presence of C16O2 products when the gas-phase oxygen is 18O2."
[20] "Therefore, we speculate that the mechanism presented here works better if the cations of the host oxide have only one stable oxidation state."

1. Quantum mechanical calculations can unambiguously prepare and study substitutionally doped oxides, which might lead to finding useful catalysts. However, experimental progress in creating doped oxide catalysts has been slow due to lack of systematic methods for selecting dopant-host combinations and synthetic methods for placing substitutional dopants at the surface of the oxide.

2. Many dopants increase the energy needed for removing an oxygen atom from the surface of ZnO, hindering the oxidation through the MVK pathway.

3. Dopants that are undercoordinated due to binding more strongly to the oxide will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy their coordination needs.

4. An alternative mechanism involves the undercoordinated dopant stealing an oxygen atom from the surface of the host oxide, creating an oxygen vacancy.

5. By performing the oxidation reaction with gas-phase 18O2, the researchers were able to prove that CO is oxidized by O2 adsorbed from the gas phase.

6. The solgel synthesis technique was used to prepare high-surface-area ZnO atomically doped with Al or Ti, attempting to overcome the issue of these oxides not oxidizing CO at low temperatures.

7. The presence of three CO2 isotopes suggests that multiple reaction mechanisms are at play in the system, including the one involving adsorbed O2.

8. The synthesis of high-surface-area ZnO doped with Al or Ti was attempted using solgel techniques, with the aim of creating a catalyst for CO oxidation at low temperatures.

9. The mechanism presented here works better if the cations of the host oxide have only one stable oxidation state, allowing the dopant to bind more effectively.

10. The presence of C16O2 products when the gas-phase oxygen is 18O2 can be explained by the mechanism involving an oxygen atom migrating onto the dopant atom and reacting with CO.

1. 量子机械计算能够明确地准备和研究取代掺杂氧化物，这可能有助于找到有用的催化剂。然而，由于缺乏系统的方法来选择掺杂剂-氧化物组合以及合成方法在氧化物表面放置取代掺杂剂，制备掺杂氧化物催化剂的实验进展缓慢。

2. 许多掺杂剂增加了从ZnO表面移除氧原子所需的能量，从而阻碍了通过MVK途径的氧化作用。

3. 由于与氧化物结合得更紧密，导致掺杂剂过饱和的掺杂剂将从气体中吸附氧气以满足其协调需求。

4. 通过使用气体相18O2进行氧化反应，研究人员能够证明CO是由从气体相氧化合物氧化的。

5. 使用溶胶合成技术尝试制备高表面积的ZnO，原子级掺杂Al或Ti，目的是克服这些氧化物在低温下不氧化CO的问题。

6. 存在三种CO2同位素表明系统中存在多个反应机制，包括涉及吸附氧的机制。
