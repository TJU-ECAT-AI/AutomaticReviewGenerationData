[1] "Quantum mechanical calculations have the advantage that they can unambiguously prepare and study substitutionally doped oxides."
[2] "We have chosen to work with Ti, Al and Zn because TiO2, Al2O3, or ZnO does not oxidize CO at temperatures below 450 C, where we perform our experiments."
[3] "In MVK reactions, the reductant takes oxygen atoms out of the oxide surface, not from the gas phase."
[4] "In our previous work, we had shown that in the case of Au-doped ceria or Au-doped rutile titania, the presence of the dopant weakens the bond of a surface oxygen atom to the oxide, and that oxygen atom reacts with CO to make a CO2 molecule."
[5] "The adsorption of O2 on the dopant, required by Mechanisms 1-3, has no barrier and is strongly exothermic."
[6] "We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that are different from the traditional MVK mechanism."
[7] "We believe that the fact that the dopant has a higher valence than Zn explains qualitatively the behavior of the doped oxide."
[8] "We have also found that an oxygen atom from the surface may migrate onto the dopant atom, and then react with CO."

1. Quantum mechanical calculations offer the advantage of clearly preparing and examining substitutionally doped oxides. 
2. TiO2, Al2O3, or ZnO do not oxidize CO at temperatures below 450°C, as performed in the experiments.
3. In the Marsvan Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, the reductant interacts with the oxide surface, not the gas phase.
4. Previous studies revealed that in Au-doped ceria and rutile titania, the dopant weakens the oxygen atom's bond, causing it to react with CO.
5. The adsorption of O2 on the dopant requires no barrier and is strongly exothermic.
6. Two novel CO oxidation pathways have been identified, differing from the traditional MVK mechanism.
7. The higher valence of the dopant compared to Zn qualitatively explains the behavior of the doped oxide.
8. An oxygen atom from the surface can migrate to the dopant atom, subsequently reacting with CO.

1. 定量机械计算的优势在于能够明确准备和研究掺杂氧化物。
2. TiO2、Al2O3或ZnO在450°C以下无法氧化CO，这是实验中进行的操作。
3. 在MVK机制中，还原剂与氧化物表面互动，而非气体相。
4. 过去的研究表明，在铈酸盐或锐钛矿氧化钛中掺入Au时，掺杂剂会削弱氧原子的键，导致氧原子与CO反应生成CO2分子。
5. O2吸附到掺杂剂上不需要任何障碍，并且是强烈的放热过程。
6. 已提出两种不同的CO氧化途径，与传统的MVK机制不同。
7. 掺杂剂的价态高于Zn，这在定性上解释了掺杂氧化物的行为。
8. 表面的氧原子可以迁移到掺杂原子上，随后与CO反应。
