[1] "In this article, we present one of the examples of our trial, CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides, which shows a very high capability for oxygen storage and is a promising new material for three-way catalysis or other forms of catalysis for oxidation reactions."
[2] "The redox behavior of CeO2TiO2 mixed oxides is an important feature because most catalysts used for the oxidation reaction are under the redox cycle; for example, a three-way catalyst works under redox conditions."
[3] "From the relative area of the reduction peak of mixed oxides, the increase in peak area at about 650 C is attributed to mainly the increase of Ti content in CexTi1-xO2 solid solution."
[4] "For CexTi1-xO2 (x = 0.20.6) samples, the Ce4+ ions reduced at 950 C are estimated to be about Ce3+, while the reduction of CeO2 alone at 950 C can reach only Ce3.8+."
[5] "The crystallite phases of CexTi1-xO2 are shown to be stable at calcination temperatures from 500 to 950 C."
[6] "The reduction degree of CexTi1-xO2 is greatly enhanced, owing to the introduction of Ti into a CeO2 lattice."

The document provides insights into how the introduction of TiO2 into a CeO2 lattice results in a solid solution of CexTi1-xO2, which exhibits improved catalytic properties, particularly in oxygen storage and redox reactions. The document highlights that the presence of TiO2 promotes the reduction of CeO2 within the solid solution, leading to a more efficient Ce4+ to Ce3+ redox cycle. This is evidenced by the increased reduction degree of CexTi1-xO2 compared to CeO2 alone, reaching Ce3+ in the solid solution versus Ce3.8+ in pure CeO2. The stability of the crystallite phases of CexTi1-xO2 at various calcination temperatures further supports its potential for use in catalytic applications. The study suggests that the introduction of TiO2 into CeO2 lattices enhances the redox properties and catalytic efficiency, particularly in CeO2-rich solid solutions, which exhibit superior oxygen storage capabilities.

文档提供了有关如何将TiO2引入CeO2晶格中形成CexTi1-xO2固溶体，这在氧气存储和氧化反应催化方面表现出改善的催化性能。文档强调了TiO2的存在促进了CeO2在固溶体中的还原，导致更高效的Ce4+到Ce3+还原循环。这通过CexTi1-xO2的增加还原程度与仅CeO2的比较得到证实，CexTi1-xO2的还原度高于纯CeO2，达到Ce3+相比Ce3.8+。CexTi1-xO2在不同煅烧温度下的晶粒相稳定性进一步支持了其在催化应用中的潜在用途。研究表明，将TiO2引入CeO2晶格中增强了还原性质和催化效率，特别是在CeO2丰富的固溶体中，它们展现出更好的氧气储存能力。
