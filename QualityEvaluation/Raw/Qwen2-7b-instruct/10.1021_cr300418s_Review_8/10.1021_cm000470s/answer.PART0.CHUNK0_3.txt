[1] "The introduction of TiO2 into CeO2 leads to the formation of solid solution CexTi1-xO2, enhances the reduction of bulk oxygen, and results in high efficiency of the Ce4+ Ce3+ redox cycle, especially, for a CeO2-rich solid solution."
[2] "For the Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 sample, the cubic phase is already formed when the precursor was calcined at 350 C. However, as the calcination temperature increases, the diffraction peak becomes narrower, which means the crystallite size becomes larger due to the sample sintering."
[3] "The reduction degree of CexTi1-xO2 is greatly enhanced, owing to the introduction of Ti into a CeO2 lattice. For CexTi1-xO2 (x = 0.20.6) samples, the Ce4+ ions reduced at 950 C are estimated to be about Ce3+, while the reduction of CeO2 alone at 950 C can reach only Ce3.8+."
[4] "The CeO2-rich solid solution shows better oxygen storage than the CeO2-lean solid solution."

1. Introducing TiO2 into CeO2 leads to the formation of a solid solution, enhancing the reduction of bulk oxygen and improving the efficiency of the Ce4+ to Ce3+ redox cycle, particularly in CeO2-rich solid solutions.

2. For the Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 sample, calcination at 350°C results in the formation of a cubic phase. As the calcination temperature rises, the crystallite size increases due to sintering, and the diffraction peak narrows.

3. The introduction of Ti into a CeO2 lattice significantly enhances the reduction degree of CexTi1-xO2, allowing Ce4+ ions reduced at 950°C to be approximately Ce3+. In contrast, the reduction of pure CeO2 at 950°C only achieves Ce3.8+.

4. CeO2-rich solid solutions exhibit superior oxygen storage capabilities compared to CeO2-lean solid solutions.

1. 将TiO2引入CeO2中，形成固溶体，增强了基体氧的还原效率，并提高了Ce4+到Ce3+的氧化还原循环效率，特别是在CeO2丰富的固溶体中。

2. 对于Ce0.8Ti0.2O2样品，在350°C时形成了立方相。随着煅烧温度升高，晶粒尺寸增大导致烧结，衍射峰变窄。

3. 将Ti引入CeO2晶格中显著提高了CexTi1-xO2的还原程度，使得在950°C下还原的Ce4+离子约为Ce3+。相比之下，纯CeO2在950°C下的还原仅达到Ce3.8+。

4. CeO2丰富的固溶体具有比CeO2贫乏固溶体更好的氧储存能力。
