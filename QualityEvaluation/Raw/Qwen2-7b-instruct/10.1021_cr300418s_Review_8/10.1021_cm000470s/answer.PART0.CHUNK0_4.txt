[1] "Among the CeO2-containing solid solutions, special attention has been focused on the CeO2ZrO2 solid solution because this material has been found to be very important to the three-way catalyst for eliminating the exhaust gases."
[2] "The CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides have been shown to have high structural stability and oxygen storage capability over a wide range of ceria content."
[3] "When x = 0.3, a monoclinic phase is observed with the space group C2/m and a = 0.9811(8) nm, b = 0.3726(3) nm, c = 0.6831(6) nm, and β = 118.84."
[4] "The reduction degree of CexTi1-xO2 is greatly enhanced, owing to the introduction of Ti into a CeO2 lattice."
[5] "For CexTi1-xO2 (x = 0.20.6) samples, the Ce4+ ions reduced at 950 C are estimated to be about Ce3+, while the reduction of CeO2 alone at 950 C can reach only Ce3.8+."

1. The CeO2ZrO2 solid solution is considered crucial for three-way catalysts aimed at eliminating exhaust gases, showcasing its high structural stability and oxygen storage capability across a broad range of ceria content.
2. When x = 0.3, the mixed oxide adopts a monoclinic symmetry with specific lattice parameters.
3. The introduction of Ti into a CeO2 lattice significantly enhances the reduction degree of CexTi1-xO2, with Ce4+ ions reduced at 950°C estimated to be Ce3+.
4. In CexTi1-xO2 samples with x ranging from 0.2 to 0.6, the reduction of CeO2 is notably more effective, reaching Ce3.8+ under the same condition, compared to Ce3+ in the CeO2 alone scenario.

1. CeO2ZrO2固溶体被发现对于消除尾气的三元催化剂至关重要，其展现出广泛的铈含量范围内高的结构稳定性和氧储存能力。
2. 当x=0.3时，混合氧化物表现出C2/m晶系，具有特定的晶格参数。
3. 将Ti引入CeO2晶格中极大地提高了CexTi1-xO2的还原度，在950°C下还原的Ce4+离子估计为Ce3+。
4. 在x从0.2到0.6的CexTi1-xO2样品中，CeO2的还原效果显著提高，达到Ce3.8+，相比之下，仅在CeO2中还原仅能达到Ce3+。
