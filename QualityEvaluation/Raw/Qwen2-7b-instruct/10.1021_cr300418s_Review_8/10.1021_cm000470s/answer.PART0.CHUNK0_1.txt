[1] "The reduction degree of CexTi1-xO2 is greatly enhanced, owing to the introduction of Ti into a CeO2 lattice. For CexTi1-xO2 (x = 0.20.6) samples, the Ce4+ ions reduced at 950 C are estimated to be about Ce3+, while the reduction of CeO2 alone at 950 C can reach only Ce3.8+."
[2] "The CeO2-rich solid solution shows better oxygen storage than the CeO2-lean solid solution."

The introduction of titanium (Ti) into the ceria (CeO2) lattice through doping significantly enhances the catalytic properties of CeO2-based materials. This enhancement is particularly noticeable in the redox properties, as evidenced by the reduction of Ce4+ ions to Ce3+ at a higher extent in the mixed oxides (CexTi1-xO2) compared to pure CeO2. The CeO2-rich solid solutions exhibit superior oxygen storage capabilities than those with a lower concentration of CeO2. This improvement is attributed to the synergistic effects between the two metals within the mixed oxide structure, leading to optimized redox behavior and enhanced catalytic activity.

掺入钛（Ti）到铈氧化物（CeO2）晶格中，通过掺杂显著提高了CeO2基材料的催化性能。这种增强特别体现在还原性质上，在混合氧化物（CexTi1-xO2）中Ce4+离子在950℃时还原到约Ce3+的程度比单一的CeO2高得多。CeO2富含量固溶体表现出优于CeO2贫含量固溶体的氧储存能力。这种改善归因于两种金属在混合氧化物结构中的协同效应，导致优化的氧化还原行为和增强的催化活性。
