The introduction of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) into metal oxides, particularly CeO2, through the formation of solid solutions like CexTi1-xO2, can significantly enhance their catalytic properties. This is evidenced by improved oxygen storage capabilities and redox efficiencies, especially in CeO2-rich solid solutions. The study suggests that the incorporation of TiO2 into the CeO2 lattice not only enhances the storage capacity of oxygen but also improves the redox properties, facilitating a more efficient Ce4+ to Ce3+ redox cycle. The CeO2-rich solid solutions demonstrate superior performance in terms of oxygen storage compared to CeO2-lean solutions. However, challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remain, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

引入相同价态掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）到金属氧化物中，特别是CeO2中，通过形成固溶体如CexTi1-xO2，可以显著增强其催化性能。这体现在增强了氧存储能力以及较高的Ce4+到Ce3+还原循环效率，尤其是在CeO2丰富的固溶体中。研究表明，将TiO2引入CeO2晶格不仅提高了氧存储容量，还改善了氧化性，使Ce4+到Ce3+还原循环更加高效。CeO2丰富的固溶体在氧存储方面表现出优于CeO2稀薄解决方案的性能。然而，对于掺杂剂行为的通用预测规则仍然存在挑战，需要考虑的因素包括Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质（可还原与不可还原）。

[1] "The reduction degree of CexTi1-xO2 is greatly enhanced, owing to the introduction of Ti into a CeO2 lattice. For CexTi1-xO2 (x = 0.20.6) samples, the Ce4+ ions reduced at 950 C are estimated to be about Ce3+, while the reduction of CeO2 alone at 950 C can reach only Ce3.8+."

The introduction of titanium (Ti) into the ceria (CeO2) lattice through doping significantly enhances the catalytic properties of CeO2-based materials. This enhancement is particularly noticeable in the redox properties, as evidenced by the reduction of Ce4+ ions to Ce3+ at a higher extent in the mixed oxides (CexTi1-xO2) compared to pure CeO2. The CeO2-rich solid solutions exhibit superior oxygen storage capabilities than those with a lower concentration of CeO2. This improvement is attributed to the synergistic effects between the two metals within the mixed oxide structure, leading to optimized redox behavior and enhanced catalytic activity.

The document provides insights into how the introduction of TiO2 into a CeO2 lattice results in a solid solution of CexTi1-xO2, which exhibits improved catalytic properties, particularly in oxygen storage and redox reactions. The document highlights that the presence of TiO2 promotes the reduction of CeO2 within the solid solution, leading to a more efficient Ce4+ to Ce3+ redox cycle. This is evidenced by the increased reduction degree of CexTi1-xO2 compared to CeO2 alone, reaching Ce3+ in the solid solution versus Ce3.8+ in pure CeO2. The stability of the crystallite phases of CexTi1-xO2 at various calcination temperatures further supports its potential for use in catalytic applications. The study suggests that the introduction of TiO2 into CeO2 lattices enhances the redox properties and catalytic efficiency, particularly in CeO2-rich solid solutions, which exhibit superior oxygen storage capabilities.
