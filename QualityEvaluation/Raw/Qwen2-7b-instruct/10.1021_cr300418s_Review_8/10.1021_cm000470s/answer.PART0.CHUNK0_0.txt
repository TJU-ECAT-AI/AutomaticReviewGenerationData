The introduction of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) into metal oxides, particularly CeO2, through the formation of solid solutions like CexTi1-xO2, can significantly enhance their catalytic properties. This is evidenced by improved oxygen storage capabilities and redox efficiencies, especially in CeO2-rich solid solutions. The study suggests that the incorporation of TiO2 into the CeO2 lattice not only enhances the storage capacity of oxygen but also improves the redox properties, facilitating a more efficient Ce4+ to Ce3+ redox cycle. The CeO2-rich solid solutions demonstrate superior performance in terms of oxygen storage compared to CeO2-lean solutions. However, challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remain, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

引入相同价态掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）到金属氧化物中，特别是CeO2中，通过形成固溶体如CexTi1-xO2，可以显著增强其催化性能。这体现在增强了氧存储能力以及较高的Ce4+到Ce3+还原循环效率，尤其是在CeO2丰富的固溶体中。研究表明，将TiO2引入CeO2晶格不仅提高了氧存储容量，还改善了氧化性，使Ce4+到Ce3+还原循环更加高效。CeO2丰富的固溶体在氧存储方面表现出优于CeO2稀薄解决方案的性能。然而，对于掺杂剂行为的通用预测规则仍然存在挑战，需要考虑的因素包括Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质（可还原与不可还原）。
