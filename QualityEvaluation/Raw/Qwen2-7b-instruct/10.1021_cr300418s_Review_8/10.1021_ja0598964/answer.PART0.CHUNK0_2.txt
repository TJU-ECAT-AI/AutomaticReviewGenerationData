Metal oxide catalysts exhibit diverse properties depending on their valence state and dopant type. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic performance of different metal oxides in various ways. For instance, SVDs can alter the electronic structure of the host oxide, affecting its reactivity. HVDs might introduce additional charge density, potentially changing the redox potential and catalytic activity. Computational and experimental studies have provided insights into how dopants impact the performance of metal oxides in different catalytic applications. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the complex interplay between dopant Lewis acid-base interactions and the intrinsic properties of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible. Factors such as the dopant's valence state, the specific metal oxide, and the reaction conditions all contribute to the observed catalytic behavior. Despite advances, a universal framework to predict dopant effects remains elusive due to the inherent complexity of these systems.

金属氧化物催化剂的性质根据其价态和掺杂类型而异。同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）以不同的方式影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能。例如，SVD可以改变宿主氧化物的电子结构，从而影响其反应性。HVD可能会引入额外的电荷密度，可能改变还原电势和催化活性。计算和实验研究提供了关于掺杂剂如何影响不同金属氧化物在各种催化应用中的性能的见解。形成一般预测规则的挑战包括理解掺杂剂Lewis酸碱相互作用与宿主氧化物固有属性之间的复杂相互作用。因素如掺杂剂的价态、特定金属氧化物以及反应条件都对观察到的催化行为产生影响。尽管取得了进展，但仍然缺乏普遍框架来预测掺杂剂效果，因为这些系统的内在复杂性。
