[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "Chapters 6 and 7 are appropriately paired, the first dealing with electronic properties and the second with magnetic and optical properties."
[3] "Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides."
[4] "Chapter 7 is perhaps less helpful as an introduction because it focuses narrowly on manganite colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high-Tc superconductors."
[5] "Also woven into this chapter is a section on resonant X-ray scattering, but the presentation is focused on orbital ordering phenomena in manganites and thus is not likely to be informative for the typical reader."
[6] "This is unfortunate since the same technique can be a very powerful tool for applications in oxide characterization for cases where elemental distributions are difficult to resolve with conventional (off-edge) X-ray diffraction."
[7] "Overall, this volume contains many useful contributions, particularly for those working in transition-metal oxide catalysis."
[8] "A wealth of references are given with each chapter, providing a valuable starting point for those new to each area of focus."

The document discusses the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, with a focus on transition-metal oxides in catalysis. It mentions that while some chapters offer excellent coverage of basic topics, the organization lacks coherence. Chapter 6 provides a comprehensive overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides, while Chapter 7 narrows its focus to specific materials like manganites. The text notes that Chapter 7 might not serve as an ideal introduction due to its specialized content, and the presentation on resonant X-ray scattering could be less accessible to general readers. However, the book is useful for those working in transition-metal oxide catalysis, offering numerous references for each chapter.

本文讨论了金属氧化物的化学和应用，特别关注过渡金属氧化物在催化领域的应用。它提到，虽然有些章节提供了基本主题的优秀介绍，但组织缺乏连贯性。第6章提供了一种全面概述金属氧化物的电子结构，而第7章则将焦点集中在特定材料如锰酸盐上。文本指出，第7章可能不适合作为一般读者的入门介绍，因为它在共振X射线散射的呈现中聚焦于锰酸盐中的轨道有序现象，这可能对普通读者不太有帮助。然而，这本书对那些从事过渡金属氧化物催化工作的人很有用，每章都提供了丰富的参考文献。
