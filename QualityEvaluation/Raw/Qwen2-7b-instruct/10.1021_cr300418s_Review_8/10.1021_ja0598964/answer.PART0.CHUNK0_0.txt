[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "Chapters 6 and 7 are appropriately paired, the first dealing with electronic properties and the second with magnetic and optical properties."
[3] "Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides."
[4] "Chapter 7 is perhaps less helpful as an introduction because it focuses narrowly on manganite colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high-Tc superconductors."
[5] "This contribution rapidly launches into second quantization approaches that will surely lose many readers, especially those whose primary interest is tied to catalysis."
[6] "Also woven into this chapter is a section on resonant X-ray scattering, but the presentation is focused on orbital ordering phenomena in manganites and thus is not likely to be informative for the typical reader."
[7] "This volume contains many useful contributions, particularly for those working in transition-metal oxide catalysis."
[8] "A wealth of references are given with each chapter, providing a valuable starting point for those new to each area of focus."

The document discusses the influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. Computational and experimental studies have provided insights into how these dopants affect the performance of metal oxides in various catalytic applications. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the role of Lewis acid-base interactions and the specific characteristics of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible. The document acknowledges that while some chapters offer comprehensive coverage of basic topics in metal oxide chemistry and applications, the organization lacks clarity, and the selection of topics may not cater to all interests, particularly those focusing on catalysis.

文档讨论了同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对不同金属氧化物催化性能的影响。计算和实验研究提供了这些掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物在各种催化应用中的性能的见解。在制定通用的掺杂行为预测规则时，需要理解Lewis酸碱相互作用的作用以及宿主氧化物的特定特性，无论是可还原的还是不可还原的。文档承认，虽然一些章节提供了关于金属氧化物化学和应用的基本主题的全面覆盖，但组织缺乏清晰性，并且选题可能不满足所有兴趣，特别是那些专注于催化的人。
