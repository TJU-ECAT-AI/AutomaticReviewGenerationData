[1] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."
[2] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
[3] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."
[4] "In experiments, the position of the dopant will depend on the method of preparation; the kinetics of preparation will control the structure."
[5] "However, if the temperature is not very high the entropic contribution (Temperature*Entropy) to the free energy is negligible and the contribution of the vibrations to the enthalpy is small. In such cases, the total energy is a good indicator of the stability of the system."
[6] "We found that alkali dopants, as well as Ag and Au, are particularly active in weakening the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide with Pt, Pd, Cd, Ir, and Rh being less active."
[7] "Our overall conclusion is that there is hope that among so many possible dopant-oxide host pairs there are some promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts."

1. The study found that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk. Most dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for certain elements which prefer to substitute at the surface.

2. The position of the dopant in the oxide depends on the method of preparation and the kinetics of the preparation process. However, at lower temperatures, the total energy of the system can be used as an indicator of the stability of the dopant's location.

3. Alkali dopants and silver (Ag) and gold (Au) were found to weaken the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, with platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), cadmium (Cd), iridium (Ir), and rhodium (Rh) being less active in this regard.

1. 研究发现，锂、钠、钾、铷、铯、锇、铑、铱、镍、钯、铂、铜、银、金等元素降低氧空位形成能（OVFE），并倾向于位于ZnO表面而不是内部。大多数增加OVFE的掺杂剂倾向于在内部替换锌原子，除了某些元素，它们更倾向于在表面替换锌原子。

2. 掺杂剂在氧化物中的位置取决于制备方法和制备过程的动力学。然而，在较低温度下，系统的总能量可以作为确定掺杂剂位置稳定性的指标。

3. 一些碱金属掺杂剂以及银（Ag）和金（Au）被发现减弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键，而铂（Pt）、钯（Pd）、镉（Cd）、铱（Ir）和铑（Rh）在这方面的作用较弱。
