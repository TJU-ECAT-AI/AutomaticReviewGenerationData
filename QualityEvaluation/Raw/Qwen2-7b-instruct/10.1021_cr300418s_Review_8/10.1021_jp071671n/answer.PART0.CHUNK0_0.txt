[1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
[2] "Among these, only Au and Ag cause a substantial lowering of OVFE, comparable to that caused by alkali dopants."
[3] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."
[4] "We were unsuccessful in our attempts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with other properties of the dopants like: the ionization energy, the electronegativity, the chemical hardness, and the covalent or the ionic radius."
[5] "However, some rationalization of these results is possible. A dopant at the surface forms fewer bonds with oxygen than a dopant in the bulk. If the dopant-oxygen bond is weaker than the ZnO bond, then less binding energy is lost if the dopant is at the surface."
[6] "The model used here contains two weak points. Highly dispersed catalysts have a large number of steps, kinks, mesas, and other morphological features on their surface. The calculations performed here are relevant only for the flat facets of such oxides."

1. Dopants that decrease the energy of oxygen vacancy formation (OVFE) tend to be located at the surface of zinc oxide (ZnO) rather than in the bulk. Among these, gold (Au) and silver (Ag) cause a significant reduction in OVFE, similar to alkali metal dopants.

2. High-valence dopants (HVDs) that increase OVFE generally prefer to substitute zinc (Zn) atoms in the bulk of the host oxide. Exceptions to this rule include calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), ruthenium (Ru), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface.

3. Efforts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with properties such as ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and atomic radii were unsuccessful. The relationship between these properties and OVFE remains unclear.

4. The reason dopants that decrease OVFE prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO is that they form fewer bonds with oxygen than dopants in the bulk. If the dopant-oxygen bond is weaker than the ZnO bond, less binding energy is lost when the dopant is at the surface.

5. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the complex interactions between dopants and the host oxide, especially concerning Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the oxide. Additionally, the limitations of computational models, such as their applicability to flat facets of highly dispersed catalysts, pose obstacles.

1. 减少氧空位形成能（OVFE）的掺杂剂倾向于位于锌氧化物（ZnO）的表面，而不是内部。其中，金（Au）和银（Ag）对OVFE的降低造成显著影响，类似于碱金属掺杂剂。

2. 增加OVFE的高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常偏好在宿主氧化物的内部替换锌（Zn）原子。例外包括钙（Ca）、锶（Sr）、钡（Ba）、镧（La）、铈（Ce）、钌（Ru）、铁（Fe）、钴（Co）、锡（Sn）和铅（Pb），它们偏好在表面替换一个Zn原子。

3. 尝试将OVFE的大小与电离能、电负性、化学硬度和原子半径等属性相关联的努力失败了。这些属性与OVFE之间的关系仍然不明确。

4. 掺杂剂降低OVFE的原因是它们与氧形成的键少于内部的掺杂剂。如果掺杂剂-氧键比ZnO键弱，则当掺杂剂位于表面时，失去的结合能量较少。

5. 在预测掺杂行为的一般规则方面面临的挑战包括理解掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间的复杂相互作用，特别是关于Lewis酸碱相互作用和氧化物的可还原性。此外，计算模型的局限性，如它们适用于高度分散催化剂的平坦面的应用，也构成了障碍。
