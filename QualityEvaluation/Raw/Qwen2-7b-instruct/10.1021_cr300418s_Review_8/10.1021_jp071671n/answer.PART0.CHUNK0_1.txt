[1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO."
[2] "Among these, only Au and Ag cause a substantial lowering of OVFE, comparable to that caused by alkali dopants."
[3] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."
[4] "The presence of any of these dopants in place of Zn stabilizes the oxygen atoms (they make it harder to make an oxygen vacancy)."
[5] "The increase in size of the atom also affects the structure of doped oxide around a dopant substituting a surface Zn atom."
[6] "Our overall conclusion is that there is hope that among so many possible dopant-oxide host pairs there are some promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts."

1. Alkali metals, as well as silver (Ag) and gold (Au), significantly weaken the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, enhancing its catalytic properties. This effect is comparable to that of alkali dopants. High-valence dopants tend to preferentially substitute zinc atoms in the bulk, except for calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), erbium (Er), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute zinc atoms at the surface.

2. The presence of certain dopants stabilizes the oxygen atoms, making it more difficult to create oxygen vacancies, which affects the catalytic performance of the oxide. The structure of the doped oxide changes around a dopant substituting a surface zinc atom, especially when the dopant size increases.

3. There is potential for specific dopant-oxide combinations to function as effective catalysts for oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. While computational models can predict the oxidative power of doped oxides, experimental validation remains crucial for practical applications.

1. 钾、铯、铷、锂、钠、锶、钡、镧、铈、锇、铑、铱、镍、钯、铂、铜、银和金等碱金属以及银和金，显著减弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键，增强其催化性能。这种效果与碱金属类似。高价态掺杂剂倾向于在内部晶格中替换锌原子，除了钙、锶、钡、镧、铈、铒、铁、钌、钴、锡和铅，这些元素更倾向于在表面替换锌原子。

2. 某些掺杂物的存在稳定了氧原子，使得形成氧空位变得更加困难，这影响了氧化物的催化性能。当掺杂物替换表面锌原子时，掺杂氧化物的结构会发生变化，尤其是在掺杂物大小增加时。

3. 存在潜在的特定掺杂剂-氧化物组合作为氧化和氧化脱氢反应的有效催化剂。虽然计算模型可以预测掺杂氧化物的氧化能力，但实验验证对于实际应用仍然至关重要。
