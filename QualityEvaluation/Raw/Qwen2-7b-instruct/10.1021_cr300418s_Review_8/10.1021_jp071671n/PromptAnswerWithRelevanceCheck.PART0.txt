[1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
[2] "Among these, only Au and Ag cause a substantial lowering of OVFE, comparable to that caused by alkali dopants."
[3] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."
[4] "We were unsuccessful in our attempts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with other properties of the dopants like: the ionization energy, the electronegativity, the chemical hardness, and the covalent or the ionic radius."
[5] "However, some rationalization of these results is possible. A dopant at the surface forms fewer bonds with oxygen than a dopant in the bulk. If the dopant-oxygen bond is weaker than the ZnO bond, then less binding energy is lost if the dopant is at the surface."
[6] "The model used here contains two weak points. Highly dispersed catalysts have a large number of steps, kinks, mesas, and other morphological features on their surface. The calculations performed here are relevant only for the flat facets of such oxides."

1. Dopants that decrease the energy of oxygen vacancy formation (OVFE) tend to be located at the surface of zinc oxide (ZnO) rather than in the bulk. Among these, gold (Au) and silver (Ag) cause a significant reduction in OVFE, similar to alkali metal dopants.

2. High-valence dopants (HVDs) that increase OVFE generally prefer to substitute zinc (Zn) atoms in the bulk of the host oxide. Exceptions to this rule include calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), ruthenium (Ru), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface.

3. Efforts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with properties such as ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and atomic radii were unsuccessful. The relationship between these properties and OVFE remains unclear.

4. The reason dopants that decrease OVFE prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO is that they form fewer bonds with oxygen than dopants in the bulk. If the dopant-oxygen bond is weaker than the ZnO bond, less binding energy is lost when the dopant is at the surface.

5. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the complex interactions between dopants and the host oxide, especially concerning Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the oxide. Additionally, the limitations of computational models, such as their applicability to flat facets of highly dispersed catalysts, pose obstacles.

1. 减少氧空位形成能（OVFE）的掺杂剂倾向于位于锌氧化物（ZnO）的表面，而不是内部。其中，金（Au）和银（Ag）对OVFE的降低造成显著影响，类似于碱金属掺杂剂。

2. 增加OVFE的高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常偏好在宿主氧化物的内部替换锌（Zn）原子。例外包括钙（Ca）、锶（Sr）、钡（Ba）、镧（La）、铈（Ce）、钌（Ru）、铁（Fe）、钴（Co）、锡（Sn）和铅（Pb），它们偏好在表面替换一个Zn原子。

3. 尝试将OVFE的大小与电离能、电负性、化学硬度和原子半径等属性相关联的努力失败了。这些属性与OVFE之间的关系仍然不明确。

4. 掺杂剂降低OVFE的原因是它们与氧形成的键少于内部的掺杂剂。如果掺杂剂-氧键比ZnO键弱，则当掺杂剂位于表面时，失去的结合能量较少。

5. 在预测掺杂行为的一般规则方面面临的挑战包括理解掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间的复杂相互作用，特别是关于Lewis酸碱相互作用和氧化物的可还原性。此外，计算模型的局限性，如它们适用于高度分散催化剂的平坦面的应用，也构成了障碍。

1. Alkali metals, as well as silver (Ag) and gold (Au), significantly weaken the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, enhancing its catalytic properties. This effect is comparable to that of alkali dopants. High-valence dopants tend to preferentially substitute zinc atoms in the bulk, except for calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), erbium (Er), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute zinc atoms at the surface.

2. The presence of certain dopants stabilizes the oxygen atoms, making it more difficult to create oxygen vacancies, which affects the catalytic performance of the oxide. The structure of the doped oxide changes around a dopant substituting a surface zinc atom, especially when the dopant size increases.

3. There is potential for specific dopant-oxide combinations to function as effective catalysts for oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. While computational models can predict the oxidative power of doped oxides, experimental validation remains crucial for practical applications.

1. 钾、铯、铷、锂、钠、锶、钡、镧、铈、锇、铑、铱、镍、钯、铂、铜、银和金等碱金属以及银和金，显著减弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键，增强其催化性能。这种效果与碱金属类似。高价态掺杂剂倾向于在内部晶格中替换锌原子，除了钙、锶、钡、镧、铈、铒、铁、钌、钴、锡和铅，这些元素更倾向于在表面替换锌原子。

2. 某些掺杂物的存在稳定了氧原子，使得形成氧空位变得更加困难，这影响了氧化物的催化性能。当掺杂物替换表面锌原子时，掺杂氧化物的结构会发生变化，尤其是在掺杂物大小增加时。

3. 存在潜在的特定掺杂剂-氧化物组合作为氧化和氧化脱氢反应的有效催化剂。虽然计算模型可以预测掺杂氧化物的氧化能力，但实验验证对于实际应用仍然至关重要。

3.1. Trends in Oxygen Vacancy Formation Energy in Doped ZnO. The OVFE in doped ZnO(1010) is shown in Figure 2. We did not consider Be, which is toxic, and Tc, which is radioactive. In the box corresponding to a dopant, the magnitude of the OVFE is given by the numbers in normal font (at the top of each box). For example, the OVFE for undoped ZnO(1010) is 3.3 eV and is given in the box for Zn. The dopants in the boxes shaded gray decrease OVFE (as compared to the OVFE of pure ZnO). The numbers at the bottom of each box (italic font) give the energy difference between a slab with the dopant substituting Zn at the surface and one with the dopant substituting Zn in the bulk (for example, Ta dopant prefers substituting in the bulk by 1.2 eV and K prefers substituting at the surface by 1.8 eV). Boxes with a line on the diagonal contain dopants that segregate at the surface.

3.2. The Location of the Dopant: at the Surface or in the Bulk? To be useful in catalysis, the dopant must replace a Zn atom at the surface of the oxide or in the first layer below the surface. In experiments, the position of the dopant will depend on the method of preparation; the kinetics of preparation will control the structure. If the preparation temperature is low or no annealing is performed so that the mobility of the dopant is very small, the dopant will be stuck in the position it happened to be when the solid oxide was formed. Given the complexity of the preparation methods, a reliable (or even an unreliable) simulation of the distribution of the dopant in the solid is not possible at this time.

The total energy of the slab with the dopant at the surface minus the total energy of the same slab with the dopant in the bulk are given in Figure 2 at the bottom of each box (in italic font). For these calculations, the energies have been sampled only at the gamma point. A negative value indicates that the dopant prefers to be located at the surface. As with the OVFE, we find no general pattern in the results, but there is a propensity that dopants that decrease OVFE prefer to be located at the surface. However, Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Sn, and Pb, which increase OVFE, also segregate to the surface. However, some rationalization of these results is possible. A dopant at the surface forms fewer bonds with oxygen than a dopant in the bulk. If the dopant-oxygen bond is weaker than the ZnO bond, then less binding energy is lost if the dopant is at the surface. This may explain why the dopants that decrease OVFE prefer to substitute a surface Zn atom. In addition, when the size of a dopant is bigger than that of Zn, it will prefer to be located at the surface where the stress can be released by a displacement of the dopant toward the vacuum.

Answering the first question, the document elucidates that same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) impact the catalytic properties of different metal oxides in distinct ways. Specifically, the document examines how dopants influence the formation of oxygen vacancies in doped zinc oxide (ZnO) surfaces. SVDs, such as alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs), decrease the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, indicating enhanced catalytic activity. Conversely, HVDs, including transition metals (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, etc.), tend to increase the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation. The document also highlights that dopants' location—whether at the surface or in the bulk—impacts their effectiveness in catalysis, with surface dopants generally showing more favorable catalytic behavior due to their reduced interaction with oxygen atoms and relieved strain.

Regarding the second question, the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior stem from several factors. The document notes that the effects of dopants are influenced by their Lewis acid-base interactions with the host oxide. Additionally, the nature of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible, plays a significant role. The document discusses that computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), offer insights into dopant effects but are limited by their inability to accurately predict properties of certain narrow-band oxides. The document also acknowledges that experimental validation is lacking, as there are no direct comparisons to the theoretical results, which necessitates further synthesis and study of the systems discussed.

Answering the third question, the document reveals that while some dopants decrease the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, others increase it. The document provides a classification of dopants into five groups based on their impact on the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE). The groups are as follows:

1. Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs: Decrease OVFE significantly, likely due to the weakening of the bond between the oxygen atom and the oxide.
2. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba: Increase OVFE, but dopants in this group still prefer to be at the surface, possibly due to their large size and reduced interaction with oxygen atoms.
3. Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, Ce: Increase OVFE, and these dopants prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk rather than at the surface.
4. Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Cd: Only Au and Ag cause a substantial lowering of OVFE, similar to alkali dopants.
5. Al, Sn, Ga, Pb: Increase OVFE, and these dopants also prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk.

The document explains that while there is no general pattern in the results, dopants that decrease OVFE tend to prefer to be located at the surface. This is attributed to the reduced interaction with oxygen atoms and the ability to relieve strain by moving towards the vacuum.

Answering the fourth question, the document indicates that the computational methodology used relies on density functional theory (DFT), which calculates the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in doped ZnO surfaces. The calculations consider various dopants and their effects on the OVFE. The document also discusses the limitations of computational methods, including difficulties in accurately predicting properties of certain narrow-band oxides and the lack of direct experimental validation. It suggests that the trends identified in the computational results are more reliable than the absolute numbers and emphasizes the need for further synthesis and study of the systems to validate the findings.

In summary, the document elucidates the complex interplay between dopants and their impact on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, highlighting the significance of understanding dopant behavior in relation to their location, the nature of the host oxide, and computational limitations. It underscores the ongoing need for both computational and experimental research to develop more accurate predictive models for dopant behavior in metal oxides.

回答第一个问题，文档阐述了同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）如何以不同的方式影响不同金属氧化物的催化性质。特别是，文档研究了掺杂剂如何影响掺杂锌氧化物（ZnO）表面的氧空位形成能。同价掺杂剂，如碱金属（Li、Na、K、Rb、Cs），显著降低了氧空位形成所需的能量，表明增强催化活性。相反，高价掺杂剂，包括过渡金属（Sc、Ti、V、Cr、Mn等），倾向于增加氧空位形成能量的壁垒。文档还指出，掺杂剂的位置——是否在表面或内部——影响其在催化中的有效性，表面掺杂剂通常由于与氧原子的较少相互作用和应力释放而表现出更优的催化行为。

对于第二个问题，制定一般预测规则以描述掺杂剂行为的挑战源自几个因素。文档指出，掺杂剂效果受到它们与宿主氧化物的Lewis酸碱相互作用的影响。此外，宿主氧化物的性质，无论是可还原的还是不可还原的，起着重要作用。文档讨论了计算方法，如密度泛函理论（DFT），为提供有关掺杂剂的信息提供了见解，但无法准确预测某些窄带氧化物的属性。文档也承认实验验证是缺乏的，因为没有直接将理论结果与实验结果进行比较，这需要进一步合成和研究所讨论的系统。

回答第三个问题，文档揭示了一些掺杂剂降低氧空位形成能，而其他则增加它。文档根据它们对氧空位形成能（OVFE）的影响将掺杂剂分为五个组：

1. Li、Na、K、Rb、Cs：大幅降低OVFE，可能是因为削弱了氧原子与氧化物之间的键。
2. Mg、Ca、Sr、Ba：增加OVFE，但这些掺杂剂仍然倾向于在表面取代锌原子，可能是因为它们较大的尺寸和与氧原子的较少相互作用。
3. Sc、Ti、V、Cr、Mn、Y、Zr、Nb、Mo、Hf、Ta、W、Re、La、Ce：增加OVFE，并且这些掺杂剂更倾向于在内部取代锌原子而不是表面。
4. Fe、Ru、Os、Co、Rh、Ir、Ni、Pd、Pt、Cu、Ag、Au、Cd：只有Au和Ag导致显著降低OVFE，类似于碱金属掺杂剂。
5. Al、Sn、Ga、Pb：增加OVFE，并且这些掺杂剂也倾向于在内部取代锌原子。

文档解释说，虽然结果中没有普遍模式，但降低OVFE的掺杂剂倾向于位于表面。这归因于与氧原子的较少相互作用和通过向真空侧移动以缓解应力的能力。

回答第四个问题，文档表明使用的计算方法依赖于密度泛函理论（DFT），该方法计算了掺杂ZnO表面的氧空位形成能。计算考虑了各种掺杂剂及其对OVFE的影响。文档还讨论了计算方法的局限性，包括预测某些窄带氧化物属性的困难以及缺乏直接实验验证。它强调趋势在计算结果中更为可靠，而不是绝对数字，并强调进一步合成和研究系统以验证发现的必要性。

总之，文档阐明了掺杂剂与催化金属氧化物性质之间复杂互动的作用，强调了理解掺杂剂行为与其位置、宿主氧化物的性质和计算限制之间的关系的重要性。它强调了继续进行计算和实验研究以开发更准确的预测模型的持续需求。

1. Dopants like Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO. On the contrary, dopants including Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE and tend to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface.

2. By altering the OVFE, doping an oxide modifies its oxidative power, potentially enhancing its catalytic activity in oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

3. The computational methodology employed in this study involves density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a plane wave basis set implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).

4. The results indicate that alkali metal dopants and certain transition metals (Ag and Au) significantly weaken the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, suggesting they could improve catalytic properties in oxidation reactions. However, other dopants either cause a minimal change in OVFE or strengthen the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, thus not enhancing the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides.
