[1] "The doping with Zr increased the thermal stability of the ceria nanoparticles (reducing sintering above 600 C) and their chemical reactivity toward hydrogen."
[2] "At temperatures between 300 and 900 C, the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles reacted with H2 and water evolved into the gas phase."
[3] "XANES showed the generation of Ce3+ cations (without reduction of Zr4+) but no diffraction lines were detected for the formation of crystal structures similar to bulk CeO1.71 or Ce2O3."
[4] "There was an expansion in the unit cell of the reduced particles probably as a consequence of a partial Ce4+  Ce3+ transformation and the sorption of hydrogen."
[5] "The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles interact with H2 and get reduced at lower temperatures than bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems."

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides by altering their structural and electronic properties. For instance, doping ceria with zirconia (Zr) increases the thermal stability and chemical reactivity towards hydrogen, allowing the ceria nanoparticles to react with hydrogen at lower temperatures than bulk ceria systems.

2. Ceria nanoparticles doped with zirconia react with hydrogen and water, evolving hydrogen gas at temperatures between 300 and 900°C. This indicates that the presence of zirconia enhances the reactivity of ceria towards hydrogen.

3. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) reveals the generation of Ce3+ cations upon reduction, without the reduction of Zr4+. This suggests that the catalytic behavior of ceria-zirconia nanoparticles involves Ce rather than Zr, despite the latter being present in the high-valence state.

4. The unit cell of the reduced ceria-zirconia nanoparticles expands due to a partial transformation of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the sorption of hydrogen. This expansion is a consequence of the chemical reduction process and the storage of hydrogen within the material.

5. Ceria-zirconia nanoparticles react with hydrogen at lower temperatures than bulk ceria-zirconia systems. This enhanced reactivity could be attributed to the nanostructured properties of the materials, which allow for differences in the cation-anion energetics compared to their bulk counterparts.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）可以通过改变其结构和电子性质来影响金属氧化物的催化性能。例如，在铈氧化物中掺入锆可以增加其热稳定性，并且增强了氢的化学反应性。

2. 铈氧化物纳米颗粒掺杂锆在300至900°C的温度范围内与氢反应，同时水蒸发成气体。这表明掺杂锆可以增强铈氧化物对氢的反应性。

3. X射线吸收近边光谱（XANES）显示，在还原过程中生成了铈3+离子，而锆4+未被还原。这表明铈氧化物-锆氧化物纳米颗粒的催化行为涉及铈而不是锆，尽管后者处于高价态。

4. 还原后的铈氧化物-锆氧化物纳米颗粒的单元格膨胀是由于铈4+部分转化为铈3+和氢的吸附导致的。这种膨胀是化学还原过程和材料内氢储存的结果。

5. 铈氧化物-锆氧化物纳米颗粒在比块体铈氧化物-锆氧化物系统更低的温度下与氢反应。这种增强的活性可能归因于材料的纳米结构特性，这允许与块体化合物相比在离子-离子能性上有差异。
