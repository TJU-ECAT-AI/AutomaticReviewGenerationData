[1] "The doping with Zr increased the thermal stability of the ceria nanoparticles (reducing sintering above 600 C) and their chemical reactivity toward hydrogen."
[2] "At temperatures between 300 and 900 C, the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles reacted with H2 and water evolved into the gas phase."
[3] "There was an expansion in the unit cell of the reduced particles probably as a consequence of a partial Ce4+  Ce3+ transformation and the sorption of hydrogen."
[4] "The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles interact with H2 and get reduced at lower temperatures than bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems."

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by altering their structural and electronic properties. In this study, the doping of ceria with zirconia (Zr) led to increased thermal stability and chemical reactivity towards hydrogen. The combination of structural and electronic effects resulted in distinct XANES spectra for the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles, indicating changes in the local structure of metal cations and their charges. 

2. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles demonstrated reduced behavior at lower temperatures than their bulk counterparts when interacting with hydrogen. This suggests that the nanostructured properties of the materials may enhance chemical reactivity through differences in cation-anion energetics, possibly related to the Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide.

3. The expansion in the unit cell of the reduced particles was likely due to a partial transformation from Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the sorption of hydrogen. This process might affect the lattice structure and potentially the catalytic activity of the nanoparticles.

4. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles exhibited lower reduction temperatures for hydrogen interaction compared to bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems. This difference could be attributed to the enhancement in chemical reactivity due to the nanostructured properties of the materials, which might involve differences in cation-anion energetics.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过改变不同金属氧化物的结构和电子性质，影响它们的催化性能。在本研究中，铈氧化物通过锆掺杂增加了热稳定性，并且对氢的化学反应性增强。结构和电子效应结合导致了Ce1-xZrxO2纳米颗粒特有的XANES光谱，表明金属离子局部结构的变化及其电荷的调整。

2. Ce1-xZrxO2纳米颗粒在与氢的相互作用中表现出较低的还原温度，与它们的块体对应物相比。这可能意味着材料的纳米结构特性通过涉及Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质来增强化学反应性。

3. 减少后粒子单元格尺寸的膨胀可能是由于部分Ce4+到Ce3+的转变和氢的吸附。这个过程可能会改变晶格结构并可能影响纳米颗粒的催化活性。

4. Ce1-xZrxO2纳米颗粒在与氢交互时的还原温度低于其块体系统。这种差异可能归因于材料的纳米结构特性，这可能涉及到离子-离子能的差异，这可能与Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质有关。
