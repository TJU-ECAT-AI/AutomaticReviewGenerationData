[1] "The doping with Zr increased the thermal stability of the ceria nanoparticles (reducing sintering above 600 C) and their chemical reactivity toward hydrogen."
[2] "At temperatures between 300 and 900 C, the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles reacted with H2 and water evolved into the gas phase."
[3] "A smooth evolution was observed with Zr content in the Ce1-xZrxO2 reduction behavior in going from the two-step (surface and bulk) mechanism characteristic of ceria to a single step typical of binary systems with a Ce/Zr atomic ratio close to 1."
[4] "XANES showed the generation of Ce3+ cations (without reduction of Zr4+) but no diffraction lines were detected for the formation of crystal structures similar to bulk CeO1.71 or Ce2O3."
[5] "There was an expansion in the unit cell of the reduced particles probably as a consequence of a partial Ce4+  Ce3+ transformation and the sorption of hydrogen."
[6] "Hydrogen could be stored at the bulk of the mixed oxides with a H/cation ratio close to 0.2."
[7] "The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles interact with H2 and get reduced at lower temperatures than bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems."

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) like Zr can increase the thermal stability of metal oxides, particularly ceria, while high-valence dopants (HVDs) can enhance chemical reactivity towards hydrogen. 
2. In the context of ceria-based materials, the addition of Zr leads to a smoother reduction process, moving from a two-step surface and bulk mechanism to a single-step process akin to binary systems with a near 1:1 Ce/Zr ratio.
3. XANES analysis reveals that upon reduction, ceria mixed with Zr generates Ce3+ cations without altering the Zr4+ state, and no diffraction lines indicative of certain crystalline structures are observed.
4. The reduced particles experience an expansion in their unit cell size, possibly due to a partial transformation from Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the adsorption of hydrogen.
5. Hydrogen can be stored within the bulk of the mixed oxides with a ratio of approximately 0.2 H per cation.
6. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles react with hydrogen at lower temperatures compared to bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems, indicating enhanced chemical reactivity.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）如Zr可以提高金属氧化物，特别是铈氧化物的热稳定性，而高价掺杂剂（HVD）可以增强其对氢的化学活性。
2. 在铈基材料中，加入Zr导致从表面和内部的两步机制平滑过渡到近1:1铈/锆原子比的二元体系中的单步过程。
3. XANES分析显示，在还原过程中，铈氧化物与Zr混合生成铈3+离子而不改变Zr4+状态，并未观察到某些晶体结构的衍射线。
4. 减少的粒子在其单元格大小上经历了扩张，这可能是由于部分铈4+转化为铈3+和氢吸附的结果。
5. 氢可以在混合氧化物的主体中以大约每阳离子0.2个氢的比例存储。
6. 铈1-xZrxO2纳米颗粒在低于纯铈1-xZrxO2系统的情况下与氢反应，表明化学活性增强。
