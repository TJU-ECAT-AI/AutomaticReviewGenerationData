[1] "The doping with Zr increased the thermal stability of the ceria nanoparticles (reducing sintering above 600 C) and their chemical reactivity toward hydrogen."
[2] "At temperatures between 300 and 900 C, the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles reacted with H2 and water evolved into the gas phase."
[3] "XANES showed the generation of Ce3+ cations (without reduction of Zr4+) but no diffraction lines were detected for the formation of crystal structures similar to bulk CeO1.71 or Ce2O3."
[4] "There was an expansion in the unit cell of the reduced particles probably as a consequence of a partial Ce4+  Ce3+ transformation and the sorption of hydrogen."
[5] "The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles interact with H2 and get reduced at lower temperatures than bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems. This important difference could originate in an enhancement in chemical reactivity due to differences in cationanion energetics, attributable to the nanostructured properties of the materials."

1. The same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) in metal oxides can influence their catalytic properties. In the context of ceria nanoparticles doped with zirconia, the doping increases the thermal stability of the material, allowing it to resist sintering at higher temperatures. Moreover, these doped nanoparticles show enhanced chemical reactivity towards hydrogen. 

2. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles react with hydrogen at temperatures ranging from 300 to 900 degrees Celsius, and upon reaction, water is evolved into the gas phase. This process demonstrates the catalytic capability of these nanoparticles towards hydrogen.

3. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) studies revealed the formation of Ce3+ cations in the doped ceria nanoparticles, indicating a reduction process without altering the Zr4+ state. No evidence was found for the formation of crystal structures similar to bulk CeO1.71 or Ce2O3.

4. The unit cell of the reduced particles expanded possibly due to a partial transformation from Ce4+ to Ce3+, and the sorption of hydrogen. This expansion is a result of the chemical reduction process and the physical adsorption of hydrogen.

5. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles react with hydrogen at lower temperatures compared to bulk ceria-based systems. This difference might be attributed to enhanced chemical reactivity, influenced by the nanostructured properties of the materials, specifically the differences in cation-anion energetics.

2. 铈1-x锆x氧化物纳米颗粒在300至900度摄氏度的温度范围内与氢反应，并且在反应过程中水蒸发成气体。这一过程表明这些纳米颗粒具有氢催化能力。

3. X射线吸收边谱（XANES）研究表明，在掺杂的铈氧化物纳米颗粒中形成了铈3+离子，表明了一个还原过程而没有改变锆4+状态。没有发现与纯铈氧化物类似的晶体结构证据。

4. 减少后的粒子单元格可能由于铈4+到铈3+的部分转换以及氢的吸附而膨胀。这种膨胀是化学还原过程和氢物理吸附的结果。

5. 铈1-x锆x氧化物纳米颗粒在比纯铈基系统更低的温度下与氢反应。这种差异可能归因于由材料的纳米结构特性引起的增强化学活性，特别是由于不同阳离子-阴离子能性的差异。

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) like Zr can increase the thermal stability of metal oxides, particularly ceria, while high-valence dopants (HVDs) can enhance chemical reactivity towards hydrogen. 
2. In the context of ceria-based materials, the addition of Zr leads to a smoother reduction process, moving from a two-step surface and bulk mechanism to a single-step process akin to binary systems with a near 1:1 Ce/Zr ratio.
3. XANES analysis reveals that upon reduction, ceria mixed with Zr generates Ce3+ cations without altering the Zr4+ state, and no diffraction lines indicative of certain crystalline structures are observed.
4. The reduced particles experience an expansion in their unit cell size, possibly due to a partial transformation from Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the adsorption of hydrogen.

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by altering their structural and electronic properties. In this study, the doping of ceria with zirconia (Zr) led to increased thermal stability and chemical reactivity towards hydrogen. The combination of structural and electronic effects resulted in distinct XANES spectra for the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles, indicating changes in the local structure of metal cations and their charges. 

2. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles demonstrated reduced behavior at lower temperatures than their bulk counterparts when interacting with hydrogen. This suggests that the nanostructured properties of the materials may enhance chemical reactivity through differences in cation-anion energetics, possibly related to the Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide.

3. The expansion in the unit cell of the reduced particles was likely due to a partial transformation from Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the sorption of hydrogen. This process might affect the lattice structure and potentially the catalytic activity of the nanoparticles.

4. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles exhibited lower reduction temperatures for hydrogen interaction compared to bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems. This difference could be attributed to the enhancement in chemical reactivity due to the nanostructured properties of the materials, which might involve differences in cation-anion energetics.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过改变不同金属氧化物的结构和电子性质，影响它们的催化性能。在本研究中，铈氧化物通过锆掺杂增加了热稳定性，并且对氢的化学反应性增强。结构和电子效应结合导致了Ce1-xZrxO2纳米颗粒特有的XANES光谱，表明金属离子局部结构的变化及其电荷的调整。

2. Ce1-xZrxO2纳米颗粒在与氢的相互作用中表现出较低的还原温度，与它们的块体对应物相比。这可能意味着材料的纳米结构特性通过涉及Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质来增强化学反应性。

3. 减少后粒子单元格尺寸的膨胀可能是由于部分Ce4+到Ce3+的转变和氢的吸附。这个过程可能会改变晶格结构并可能影响纳米颗粒的催化活性。

4. Ce1-xZrxO2纳米颗粒在与氢交互时的还原温度低于其块体系统。这种差异可能归因于材料的纳米结构特性，这可能涉及到离子-离子能的差异，这可能与Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质有关。

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides by altering their structural and electronic properties. For instance, doping ceria with zirconia (Zr) increases the thermal stability and chemical reactivity towards hydrogen, allowing the ceria nanoparticles to react with hydrogen at lower temperatures than bulk ceria systems.

2. Ceria nanoparticles doped with zirconia react with hydrogen and water, evolving hydrogen gas at temperatures between 300 and 900°C. This indicates that the presence of zirconia enhances the reactivity of ceria towards hydrogen.

3. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) reveals the generation of Ce3+ cations upon reduction, without the reduction of Zr4+. This suggests that the catalytic behavior of ceria-zirconia nanoparticles involves Ce rather than Zr, despite the latter being present in the high-valence state.

4. The unit cell of the reduced ceria-zirconia nanoparticles expands due to a partial transformation of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the sorption of hydrogen. This expansion is a consequence of the chemical reduction process and the storage of hydrogen within the material.

5. Ceria-zirconia nanoparticles react with hydrogen at lower temperatures than bulk ceria-zirconia systems. This enhanced reactivity could be attributed to the nanostructured properties of the materials, which allow for differences in the cation-anion energetics compared to their bulk counterparts.

4. 还原后的铈氧化物-锆氧化物纳米颗粒的单元格膨胀是由于铈4+部分转化为铈3+和氢的吸附导致的。这种膨胀是化学还原过程和材料内氢储存的结果。

5. 铈氧化物-锆氧化物纳米颗粒在比块体铈氧化物-锆氧化物系统更低的温度下与氢反应。这种增强的活性可能归因于材料的纳米结构特性，这允许与块体化合物相比在离子-离子能性上有差异。
