[1] "The doping with Zr increased the thermal stability of the ceria nanoparticles (reducing sintering above 600 C) and their chemical reactivity toward hydrogen."
[2] "At temperatures between 300 and 900 C, the Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles reacted with H2 and water evolved into the gas phase."
[3] "XANES showed the generation of Ce3+ cations (without reduction of Zr4+) but no diffraction lines were detected for the formation of crystal structures similar to bulk CeO1.71 or Ce2O3."
[4] "There was an expansion in the unit cell of the reduced particles probably as a consequence of a partial Ce4+  Ce3+ transformation and the sorption of hydrogen."
[5] "The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles interact with H2 and get reduced at lower temperatures than bulk Ce1-xZrxO2 systems. This important difference could originate in an enhancement in chemical reactivity due to differences in cationanion energetics, attributable to the nanostructured properties of the materials."

1. The same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) in metal oxides can influence their catalytic properties. In the context of ceria nanoparticles doped with zirconia, the doping increases the thermal stability of the material, allowing it to resist sintering at higher temperatures. Moreover, these doped nanoparticles show enhanced chemical reactivity towards hydrogen. 

2. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles react with hydrogen at temperatures ranging from 300 to 900 degrees Celsius, and upon reaction, water is evolved into the gas phase. This process demonstrates the catalytic capability of these nanoparticles towards hydrogen.

3. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) studies revealed the formation of Ce3+ cations in the doped ceria nanoparticles, indicating a reduction process without altering the Zr4+ state. No evidence was found for the formation of crystal structures similar to bulk CeO1.71 or Ce2O3.

4. The unit cell of the reduced particles expanded possibly due to a partial transformation from Ce4+ to Ce3+, and the sorption of hydrogen. This expansion is a result of the chemical reduction process and the physical adsorption of hydrogen.

5. The Ce1-xZrxO2 nanoparticles react with hydrogen at lower temperatures compared to bulk ceria-based systems. This difference might be attributed to enhanced chemical reactivity, influenced by the nanostructured properties of the materials, specifically the differences in cation-anion energetics.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）在金属氧化物中可以影响其催化性能。在铈氧化物纳米颗粒掺杂锆的情况下，掺杂提高了材料的热稳定性，使其能够在更高温度下抵抗结块。此外，这些掺杂的纳米颗粒显示出对氢的增强化学活性。

2. 铈1-x锆x氧化物纳米颗粒在300至900度摄氏度的温度范围内与氢反应，并且在反应过程中水蒸发成气体。这一过程表明这些纳米颗粒具有氢催化能力。

3. X射线吸收边谱（XANES）研究表明，在掺杂的铈氧化物纳米颗粒中形成了铈3+离子，表明了一个还原过程而没有改变锆4+状态。没有发现与纯铈氧化物类似的晶体结构证据。

4. 减少后的粒子单元格可能由于铈4+到铈3+的部分转换以及氢的吸附而膨胀。这种膨胀是化学还原过程和氢物理吸附的结果。

5. 铈1-x锆x氧化物纳米颗粒在比纯铈基系统更低的温度下与氢反应。这种差异可能归因于由材料的纳米结构特性引起的增强化学活性，特别是由于不同阳离子-阴离子能性的差异。
