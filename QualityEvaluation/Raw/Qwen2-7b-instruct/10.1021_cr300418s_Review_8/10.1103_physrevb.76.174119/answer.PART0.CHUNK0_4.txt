Compared to pure ceria, reduction is facilitated and the reducibility increases in the sequence of CeO2-SnO2, CeO2-GeO2, and CeO2-SiO2, which correlates with the decrease of the ionic radii of the solutes. 

For low solute concentrations, there is an inverse relation between high reducibility and the solution energy of tetravalent solutes.

CeO2-PbO2 is unique in the sense that the initial reduction occurs by PbIVPbII instead of the usual CeIVCeIII reaction. 

The properties of Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 are similar to the properties of Ce0.9688Sn0.0312O2 and Ce0.9688Ge0.0312O2. Both the relaxed and unre- laxed vacancy formation energies are shifted slightly upwards and, equivalently, the occupied Ce f states move away from the O 2p valence band edge by 0.03 eV compared to Ce0.9688Si0.0312O1.9688 band separation.

Among the investigated ceria compounds, CeO2-PbO2 has the lowest reduction energy and rather low solution energy.

The solution energy increases monotonously with concentration, while the reduction energy first decreases, as compared to pure ceria except for Th, which exhibits a small increase, and with further increase of solute concentration, it either remains almost constant Zr, Hf, and Th or slightly increases Ti, Si, Ge, and Sn.

The document discusses how different dopants affect the catalytic properties of ceria-based materials. Small-sized dopants like SiO2, GeO2, and SnO2 enhance the reducibility of ceria, correlating with their smaller ionic radii. PbO2 is unique because it undergoes reduction by PbIVPbII instead of the typical CeIVCeIII reaction. The solution energy increases with the concentration of dopants, whereas the reduction energy initially decreases before stabilizing or increasing at higher concentrations. Among the studied compounds, CeO2-PbO2 exhibits the lowest reduction energy and moderate solution energy. The document also explores the relationship between vacancy formation energies, band separation, and dopant properties in ceria materials.

文档讨论了不同掺杂剂如何影响基于铈的材料的催化性能。小尺寸掺杂剂如二氧化硅、锗氧化物和锡氧化物可以增强铈的可还原性，与它们较小的离子半径相关联。铅氧化物具有独特性，因为它通过铅IV铅II反应而不是通常的铈IV铈III反应进行还原。溶液能量随掺杂剂浓度的增加而增加，而还原能最初减少，在某些情况下保持稳定（例如，铪、锆、钍），在更高的浓度下可能略有增加（例如，钛、硅、锗、锡）。在研究的化合物中，铈氧铅具有最低的还原能和适度的溶液能量。文档还探讨了铈基材料中掺杂剂性质与空位形成能、带分离之间的关系。
