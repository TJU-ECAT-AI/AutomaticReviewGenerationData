[1] "Compared to pure ceria, reduction is facilitated and the reducibility increases in the sequence of CeO2-SnO2, CeO2-GeO2, and CeO2-SiO2, which correlates with the decrease of the ionic radii of the solutes."
[2] "CeO2-PbO2 is unique in the sense that the initial reduction occurs by PbIVPbII instead of the usual CeIVCeIII reaction."
[3] "Among the investigated ceria compounds, CeO2-PbO2 has the lowest reduction energy and rather low solution energy."
[4] "Vacancy formation energy in Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2 is higher than the extrapolation from the group 4b elements; however, the absolute value is still somewhat lower than for Ce0.9688Ti0.0312O2, which has the smallest vacancy formation energy of the group 4b ceria compounds."

1. The reduction process in ceria is enhanced by the addition of smaller solutes like Sn, Ge, and Si, which correlate with decreasing ionic radii. PbO2 behaves uniquely, undergoing reduction via PbIVPbII rather than the typical CeIVCeIII reaction. CeO2-PbO2 exhibits the lowest reduction energy and relatively low solution energy among the investigated compounds.
2. The vacancy formation energy in ceria solid solutions varies with the type of solute added. While it is higher for Si than predicted by extrapolating from group 4b elements, it remains lower than for CeO2-TiO2.

1. 添加如Sn、Ge和Si等更小的溶剂可以增强铈氧化物的还原过程，与溶质离子半径的减小相关。对于PbO2，其还原过程独特，通过PbIVPbII而非典型的CeIVCeIII反应进行。在研究的化合物中，CeO2-PbO2具有最低的还原能和相对较低的溶解能。
2. 铈氧化物固溶体中的空位形成能随所加溶质的不同而变化。尽管Si的空位形成能在预测的基础上更高，但仍然低于CeO2-TiO2。

[1] "The tendency of the M4+ ions to undergo reduction is directly related to the energy associated with the MO2MO+O2/2 reaction."
[2] "Table I summarizes the experimental reaction enthalpies at 298 K for the Pb, Sn, Ge, and Ti oxides there is no data for the other elements since those reactions do not occur."
[3] "Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2, Ce0.9688Ge0.0312O2, Ce0.9688Sn0.0312O2, and Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 all have lower reduction temperatures than Ce0.9688Zr0.0312O2, which represents the current state of the art OSC material not necessarily with this particular Zr concentration."

3. The likelihood of the M4+ ions undergoing reduction is proportional to the energy linked to the MO2MO+O2/2 reaction. 
4. Table I compiles the experimental reaction enthalpies at 298 K for Pb, Sn, Ge, and Ti oxides; no data is available for other elements because those reactions do not take place.
5. Among the ceria compounds, those with PbO2, SiO2, GeO2, and SnO2 have lower reduction temperatures compared to Ce0.9688Zr0.0312O2, which is currently the leading OSC material, potentially due to the specific Zr concentration used.

3. M4+离子发生还原的趋势直接与MO2MO+O2/2反应相关的能量有关。
4. 表I总结了298 K时Pb、Sn、Ge和Ti氧化物的实验反应热力学值；其他元素没有数据，因为这些反应不发生。
5. 在铈氧化物中，掺入PbO2、SiO2、GeO2和SnO2的化合物具有比Ce0.9688Zr0.0312O2更低的还原温度，这可能是由于特定的Zr浓度，目前这是最先进的OSC材料。
