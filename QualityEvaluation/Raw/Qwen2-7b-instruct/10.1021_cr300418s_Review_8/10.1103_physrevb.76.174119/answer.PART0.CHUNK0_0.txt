[1] "Compared to pure ceria, reduction is facilitated and the reducibility increases in the sequence of CeO2-SnO2, CeO2-GeO2, and CeO2-SiO2, which correlates with the decrease of the ionic radii of the solutes."
[2] "The development of new OSC materials will benefit from better knowledge of the redox properties and the stability ranges of CeO2-MO2 M=Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb solution phases."
[3] "The vacancy formation energy for Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 is, as a matter of fact, lower than for any of the other solute ions, in spite of the fact that Pb4+ has the largest ionic radius with the exception of Th4+."
[4] "The tendency of the M4+ ions to undergo reduction is directly related to the energy associated with the MO2MO+O2/2 reaction."

1. When compared to pure ceria, the introduction of solutes like SnO2, GeO2, and SiO2 facilitates reduction and enhances reducibility, correlating with the diminution in the ionic radii of these solutes. 
2. Improved understanding of the redox properties and stability ranges of CeO2-MO2 phases, where M includes Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb, will contribute to the development of new Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC) materials.  
3. Despite having the largest ionic radius (besides Th4+), Pb4+ shows the lowest vacancy formation energy in Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2, indicating a unique reduction mechanism.
4. The propensity of M4+ ions to undergo reduction is directly tied to the energy involved in the MO2 to MO+O2/2 reaction.

1. 与纯铈氧化物相比，引入如SnO2、GeO2和SiO2这样的溶剂可以促进还原反应并增强还原性，这与这些溶剂离子半径的减小成正比。
2. 对于CeO2-MO2相（其中M包括Ti、Zr、Hf、Th、Si、Ge、Sn或Pb）的氧化还原特性和稳定范围有更深入的理解将有助于新型氧气存储能力(OSC)材料的发展。
3. 尽管在除了Th4+之外的元素中具有最大的离子半径，但在Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2中的Pb4+显示出最低的空位形成能，表明了一种独特的还原机制。
4. M4+离子进行还原的倾向直接与MO2到MO+O2/2反应的能量有关联。
