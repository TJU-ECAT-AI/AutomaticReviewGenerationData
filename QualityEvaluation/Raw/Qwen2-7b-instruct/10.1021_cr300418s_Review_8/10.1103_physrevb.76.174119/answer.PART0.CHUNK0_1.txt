[1] "CeO2-SnO2 materials were studied by Lin et al.21,22 and they found excellent redox properties and high catalytic activity."
[2] "The development of new OSC materials will benefit from better knowledge of the redox properties and the stability ranges of CeO2-MO2 M=Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb solution phases."
[3] "Compared to pure ceria, reduction is facilitated and the reducibility increases in the sequence of CeO2-SnO2, CeO2-GeO2, and CeO2-SiO2, which correlates with the decrease of the ionic radii of the solutes."
[4] "Among the investigated ceria compounds, CeO2-PbO2 has the lowest reduction energy and rather low solution energy."
[5] "We have studied how the solution and reduction energies depend on the concentration of Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Ti, Zr, Hf, and Th solute ions."

1. Lin et al. studied CeO2-SnO2 materials and found they exhibit excellent redox properties and high catalytic activity. 
2. The development of new oxygen storage capacity (OSC) materials can benefit from a deeper understanding of the redox properties and stability ranges of ceria compounds mixed with Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb.
3. Reducing the ionic radii of solutes enhances the redox properties of ceria. Specifically, CeO2-SnO2, CeO2-GeO2, and CeO2-SiO2 show improved redox properties compared to pure CeO2.
4. CeO2-PbO2 has the lowest reduction energy and relatively low solution energy among the investigated ceria compounds.
5. The study examines how solution and reduction energies change with the concentration of solute ions including Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Ti, Zr, Hf, and Th.
