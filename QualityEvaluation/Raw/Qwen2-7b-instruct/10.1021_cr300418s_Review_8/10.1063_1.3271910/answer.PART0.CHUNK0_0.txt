1. The study examines the impact of lanthanum (La) doping on carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption on ceria surfaces. Using density functional theory (DFT) augmented with the U Hubbard term, researchers found that La doping increases the adsorption energy of CO on ceria surfaces. This enhancement leads to improved catalytic properties, specifically increased activity and selectivity of ceria-based catalysts for CO oxidation. However, predicting dopant behavior universally remains challenging due to the intricate relationship between Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide, which is further complicated by the reducibility and irreducibility of the oxide.

1. 本研究探讨了镧(La)掺杂对碳氧化物(CO)在铈表面吸附的影响。利用密度泛函理论(DFT)与U哈伯德项增强的方法，研究人员发现La掺杂增加了CO在铈表面的吸附能。这种增强导致铈基催化剂对CO氧化的催化性能提高，特别是提高了活性和选择性。然而，由于Lewis酸碱相互作用与宿主氧化物性质之间的复杂相互作用，预测掺杂行为的通用规则仍然具有挑战性。这种复杂性进一步由宿主氧化物的可还原性和不可还原性引起。
