The literature focuses on the effect of lanthanum (La) doping on carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption at ceria surfaces. The study uses computational methods, specifically density functional theory (DFT) augmented with an on-site energy term (U), to model the La doping of ceria surfaces with (111) and (110) crystal orientations. The results and discussion section delves into CO adsorption dynamics on these surfaces, which provides insights into the catalytic properties of ceria surfaces modified by La doping. However, the document does not extensively discuss how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides or formulate general predictive rules for dopant behavior considering specific factors.

文献主要探讨了镧(La)掺杂对一氧化碳(CO)在铈表面吸附的影响。研究使用了计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论(DFT)与局域能量项(U)增强相结合的方法，来模拟La掺杂的铈表面的(111)和(110)晶面结构。结果与讨论部分深入分析了这些表面的CO吸附动力学，为铈表面改性后催化性质提供了见解。然而，文档没有详细讨论同价掺杂剂(SVD)和高价掺杂剂(HVD)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能，也没有形成关于掺杂行为的一般预测规则，考虑特定因素。
