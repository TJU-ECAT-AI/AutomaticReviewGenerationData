The effect of lanthanum (La) doping on carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption at ceria surfaces has been studied computationally and experimentally. The findings indicate that La doping increases CO adsorption on ceria surfaces, which might improve catalytic performance. This enhancement is linked to the modification of electronic structure due to La doping, resulting in a more favorable adsorption energy for CO. However, predicting dopant behavior universally remains difficult, especially considering the impact of Lewis acid-base interactions and the characteristics of the host oxide (reducible versus irreducible). A complete understanding of dopant effects in metal oxides is still developing.

镧（La）掺杂对铈表面一氧化碳（CO）吸附的影响已被计算和实验研究。结果表明，镧掺杂可以增加铈表面的CO吸附，这可能提高催化性能。这种增强与镧掺杂导致的电子结构改变有关，从而形成更有利于CO吸附的能量。然而，预测掺杂剂行为具有普遍性仍然困难，特别是考虑到Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物（可还原性与不可还原性）的特性的影响。金属氧化物中掺杂剂效应的全面理解仍在发展中。
