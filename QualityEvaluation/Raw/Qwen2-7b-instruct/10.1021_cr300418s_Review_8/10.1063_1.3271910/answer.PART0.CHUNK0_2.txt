The study investigates how lanthanum (La) doping affects carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption on ceria surfaces. By using density functional theory (DFT) with the U method, the researchers modeled La doping on ceria surfaces with (111) and (110) crystallographic orientations. The findings indicate that both same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can significantly impact the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Incorporating dopants into these materials can modify their electronic structure and surface chemistry, enhancing their performance in catalytic applications. However, predicting dopant behavior universally remains difficult due to the intricate balance between Lewis acid-base interactions and the unique characteristics of the host oxide, including its reducibility and irreducibility, which influence how the dopants interact effectively.

这项研究旨在探究镧(La)掺杂对一氧化碳(CO)在铈表面吸附的影响。通过使用密度泛函理论(DFT)结合U方法，研究人员对具有(111)和(110)晶面结构的铈表面进行了La掺杂的建模。研究结果表明，同价掺杂剂(SVD)和高价掺杂剂(HVD)均能显著改变金属氧化物的催化性能。在这些材料中引入掺杂剂可以改变其电子结构和表面化学性质，从而提高它们在催化应用中的性能。然而，由于Lewis酸碱相互作用的复杂性和宿主氧化物的独特性质（可还原性与不可还原性），预测掺杂剂行为的普遍规律仍然具有挑战性。这些复杂性源于宿主氧化物的不同可还原性和不可还原性特性，这些特性影响掺杂剂的有效相互作用方式。
