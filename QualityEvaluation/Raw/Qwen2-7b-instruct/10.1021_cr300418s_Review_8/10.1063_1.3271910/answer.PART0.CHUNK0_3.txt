The effect of La doping on CO adsorption at ceria surfaces has been studied computationally using DFT+U methods. The results indicate enhanced CO adsorption on surfaces doped with La. Challenges in predicting dopant behavior include understanding the Lewis acid-base interactions and the specific characteristics of the host oxide, whether it is reducible or irreducible.
