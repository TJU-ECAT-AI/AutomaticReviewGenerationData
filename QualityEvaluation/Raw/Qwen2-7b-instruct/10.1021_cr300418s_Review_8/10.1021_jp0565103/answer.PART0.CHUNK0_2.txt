The scientific literature discusses how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) impact the catalytic properties of various metal oxides. Computational and experimental studies have elucidated the effects of these dopants on the performance of metal oxides in diverse catalytic applications. However, challenges remain in developing comprehensive predictive guidelines for dopant behavior due to the intricate interplay of factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the characteristics of the host oxide. These studies highlight the importance of understanding the nature of the host oxide and the specific interactions between dopants and the oxide structure in predicting the dopant's influence on the overall catalytic activity.
