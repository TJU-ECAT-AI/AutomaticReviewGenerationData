How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?

The presence of Ti and Pt dopants significantly influences the catalytic properties of metal oxides, leading to enhanced reducibility and higher redox catalytic activity compared to undoped counterparts. Computational and experimental studies have provided insights into how dopants affect the performance of various catalytic applications. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to complex interactions with the host oxide, particularly involving Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility or irreducibility of the host oxide. These factors play crucial roles in determining the effectiveness of dopants.

同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性质，以及从计算和实验研究中获得的关于它们在各种催化应用性能影响的见解是什么？此外，在考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物（可还原性与不可还原性）的性质等因素的情况下，形成通用预测规则的挑战是什么？

Ti和Pt掺杂剂显著影响金属氧化物的催化性质，导致与未掺杂对应物相比增强的可还原性和更高的氧化还原催化活性。计算和实验研究表明，掺杂剂如何影响各种催化应用的性能。形成通用掺杂行为预测规则的挑战仍然存在，这主要是由于与宿主氧化物的复杂相互作用，特别是涉及Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的可还原性或不可还原性。这些因素在决定掺杂剂的有效性方面起着关键作用。
