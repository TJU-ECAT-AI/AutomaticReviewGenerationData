[3] "Computational and experimental studies have revealed that the incorporation of HVDs like Ti and Pt enhances the reducibility of Ce-based oxides and boosts their redox catalytic activity."
[4] "However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the complex interplay between the Lewis acid-base interactions within the oxide lattice and the specific nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)."

The study explores how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) impact the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. It reveals that incorporating HVDs like Ti and Pt into Ce-based oxides increases their reducibility and redox catalytic activity compared to their undoped counterparts. However, establishing universal predictive rules for dopant behavior remains difficult because of the intricate relationship between Lewis acid-base interactions within the oxide lattice and the oxide's reducibility. Challenges include understanding the complex interactions and predicting the effects of dopants in reducible versus irreducible oxides.

该研究探讨了不同金属氧化物中同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对其催化性质的影响。研究表明，将Ti和Pt等HVD掺入Ce基氧化物中可以显著提高其可还原性和原电池催化活性，与未掺杂的氧化物相比。然而，由于氧化物晶格内的Lewis酸碱相互作用的复杂性以及氧化物本身的可还原性与不可还原性的特定性质之间的关系，建立通用的掺杂行为预测规则仍然具有挑战性。挑战包括理解复杂的相互作用并预测在可还原氧化物和不可还原氧化物中的掺杂效果。</ChineseVersionAnswer>
