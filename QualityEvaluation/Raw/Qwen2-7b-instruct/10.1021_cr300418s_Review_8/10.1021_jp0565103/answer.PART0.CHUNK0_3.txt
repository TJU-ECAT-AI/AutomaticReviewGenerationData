1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) significantly influence the reducibility and redox catalytic activity of ceria-based oxides, particularly when compared to ceria alone. Computational and experimental studies highlight that the type of dopant, whether SVD or HVD, plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Challenges in predicting dopant behavior generally involve comprehending the interaction dynamics between Lewis acid-base properties and the reducibility nature of the host oxide.
