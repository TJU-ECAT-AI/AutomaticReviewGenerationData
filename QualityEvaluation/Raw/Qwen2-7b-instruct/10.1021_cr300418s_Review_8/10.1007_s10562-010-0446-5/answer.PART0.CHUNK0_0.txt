The document discusses the impact of dopants, specifically zirconium (Zr) and calcium (Ca), on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, focusing on their ability to enhance redox performance. Zr4+ dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, weakening Ce-O bonds, which benefits CO direct oxidation on Zr-doped ceria. However, the reaction dynamics of CO oxidation are not fully understood. CO binds strongly to the CeO2 (110) surface, while on (111) it binds to Ce sites with smaller adsorption energy. Zr doping on (111) surfaces allows CO to be directly oxidized, whereas on (110) surfaces, CO remains bound, making them less reactive. Despite the reduction of oxygen vacancy formation energy due to Zr doping, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (110) is still less active for CO direct oxidation compared to Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111).

文档讨论了掺杂剂，特别是锆(Zr)和钙(Ca)，对金属氧化物催化性能的影响，着重于它们增强还原性的能力。Zr4+掺杂促进了Ce4+到Ce3+的还原，削弱了Ce-O键，这有利于Zr掺杂铈氧化物中的CO直接氧化。然而，CO氧化反应的动力学尚未完全解开。CO在CeO2 (110)表面结合牢固，而在(111)表面上则结合到Ce位点，吸附能较小。Zr掺杂在(111)表面上允许CO直接氧化，而(110)表面上CO保持结合，使其活性较低。尽管由于Zr掺杂导致氧空位形成能降低，Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (110)仍然不如Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111)直接进行CO氧化。
