[1] "One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2  and CO2 on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) with small activation energies."
[2] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct formation and release of CO2."
[3] "The smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."
[4] "Our findings satisfactorily explain experimental observations [5] and give indispensable insights for rational manipulations of composition and structure of nanocatalysts that involve oxides."

Computational and experimental studies have revealed that same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides by facilitating the reduction of the host oxide's oxidation state, weakening the bonds within the oxide lattice, and enhancing oxygen mobility. This, in turn, enables the direct formation and release of CO2, improving the efficiency of catalytic processes. The insights gained suggest that dopants can be strategically manipulated to optimize catalytic performance in various applications. Despite these advancements, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of interactions involving Lewis acid-base properties and the intrinsic nature of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible.

计算和实验研究表明，同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过促进宿氧化物的氧化态还原，削弱氧化物晶格内的键，增加氧的流动性，从而影响金属氧化物的催化性质。这使得CO2的直接形成和释放成为可能，提高了催化过程的效率。这些见解表明，可以通过有策略地调整掺杂剂来优化涉及氧化物的催化剂性能。尽管取得了这些进展，但预测掺杂剂行为的一般规则仍面临挑战，因为涉及到Lewis酸碱性质的复杂相互作用以及宿氧化物的固有性质，无论是可还原的还是不可还原的，这都增加了构建通用规则的难度。
