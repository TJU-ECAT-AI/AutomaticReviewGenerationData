[1] "Rational design of robust nanocatalysts for CO oxidation and NOx reduction is crucial for many important applications such as pollution control and energy production."
[2] "Significantly, its redox performance can be further enhanced by the presence of various dopants, such as Zr4+, Ca2+ and some noble metal [36]."
[3] "One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2  and CO2 on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) with small activation energies."
[4] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct formation and release of CO2."
[5] "The calculated Evac values are 2.30 and 0.94 eV for CeO2  x (110) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2  x (110), respectively."
[6] "Since the binding energies of CO are rather high on the clean and Zr-doped CeO2 (110), the reaction can be easily poisoned and the (110) surfaces remain inactive."

The literature discusses the impact of dopants on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly focusing on CO oxidation and NOx reduction applications. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) like Zr4+ and high-valence dopants (HVDs) enhance the redox performance of these materials. For instance, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for CO oxidation by facilitating the formation and release of CO2. The literature also highlights that Zr dopants weaken the CeO bonds, contributing to the direct oxidation of CO. In terms of the CeO2 (110) surface, the literature indicates that despite the potential for oxygen vacancy formation, the high binding energy of CO on the surface makes the surface inactive for direct CO oxidation, leading to easy poisoning. The calculated energy for oxygen vacancy formation on the CeO2 (110) surface is notably higher than on the Zr-doped counterpart, supporting the notion that Zr doping enhances the reactivity of the material.

文献讨论了掺杂对金属氧化物催化性质的影响，特别是对于CO氧化和NOx减少这类重要应用。同价掺杂剂（SVD）如Zr4+和高价掺杂剂（HVD）能够进一步提升这些材料的还原性性能。例如，Zr掺杂可以降低CO氧化过程的能量成本，促进CO2的直接形成与释放。文献还指出，Zr掺杂能够削弱CeO键，从而有利于CO的直接氧化。对于CeO2（110）表面，文献表明尽管存在形成氧空位的可能性，但由于CO在表面的高结合能，表面难以实现直接CO氧化，容易被毒化。计算得到的氧空位形成能显示，CeO2（110）表面远高于其Zr掺杂的对应物，这支持了Zr掺杂能够增强材料活性的观点。
