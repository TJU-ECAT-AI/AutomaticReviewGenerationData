[1] "Significantly, its redox performance can be further enhanced by the presence of various dopants, such as Zr4+, Ca2+ and some noble metal [36]."
[2] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce(IV) to Ce(III) and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct oxidation of CO on Zr-doped ceria."
[3] "However, the relevant reaction dynamics has not been satisfactorily unravelled."
[4] "In contrast, CO tends to strongly bind to CeO2 (110) at the O-bridge site [25, 26]."
[5] "Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol."
[6] "From the DOS curve plotted in Fig. 1b, the gap state localizes on two of the Ce cations around the vacancy, indicating that the two surface Ce4+ cations are already reduced to Ce3+ cations."
[7] "We believe that Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (110) is still inactive for direct CO oxidation, although it is somewhat better than CeO2(110)."

The document discusses the impact of dopants, specifically zirconium (Zr) and calcium (Ca), on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, focusing on their ability to enhance redox performance. Zr4+ dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, weakening Ce-O bonds, which benefits CO direct oxidation on Zr-doped ceria. However, the reaction dynamics of CO oxidation are not fully understood. CO binds strongly to the CeO2 (110) surface, while on (111) it binds to Ce sites with smaller adsorption energy. Zr doping on (111) surfaces allows CO to be directly oxidized, whereas on (110) surfaces, CO remains bound, making them less reactive. Despite the reduction of oxygen vacancy formation energy due to Zr doping, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (110) is still less active for CO direct oxidation compared to Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111).

文档讨论了掺杂剂，特别是锆(Zr)和钙(Ca)，对金属氧化物催化性能的影响，着重于它们增强还原性的能力。Zr4+掺杂促进了Ce4+到Ce3+的还原，削弱了Ce-O键，这有利于Zr掺杂铈氧化物中的CO直接氧化。然而，CO氧化反应的动力学尚未完全解开。CO在CeO2 (110)表面结合牢固，而在(111)表面上则结合到Ce位点，吸附能较小。Zr掺杂在(111)表面上允许CO直接氧化，而(110)表面上CO保持结合，使其活性较低。尽管由于Zr掺杂导致氧空位形成能降低，Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (110)仍然不如Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111)直接进行CO氧化。

Computational and experimental studies have revealed that same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides by facilitating the reduction of the host oxide's oxidation state, weakening the bonds within the oxide lattice, and enhancing oxygen mobility. This, in turn, enables the direct formation and release of CO2, improving the efficiency of catalytic processes. The insights gained suggest that dopants can be strategically manipulated to optimize catalytic performance in various applications. Despite these advancements, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of interactions involving Lewis acid-base properties and the intrinsic nature of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible.

计算和实验研究表明，同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过促进宿氧化物的氧化态还原，削弱氧化物晶格内的键，增加氧的流动性，从而影响金属氧化物的催化性质。这使得CO2的直接形成和释放成为可能，提高了催化过程的效率。这些见解表明，可以通过有策略地调整掺杂剂来优化涉及氧化物的催化剂性能。尽管取得了这些进展，但预测掺杂剂行为的一般规则仍面临挑战，因为涉及到Lewis酸碱性质的复杂相互作用以及宿氧化物的固有性质，无论是可还原的还是不可还原的，这都增加了构建通用规则的难度。

The literature discusses the impact of dopants on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly focusing on CO oxidation and NOx reduction applications. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) like Zr4+ and high-valence dopants (HVDs) enhance the redox performance of these materials. For instance, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for CO oxidation by facilitating the formation and release of CO2. The literature also highlights that Zr dopants weaken the CeO bonds, contributing to the direct oxidation of CO. In terms of the CeO2 (110) surface, the literature indicates that despite the potential for oxygen vacancy formation, the high binding energy of CO on the surface makes the surface inactive for direct CO oxidation, leading to easy poisoning. The calculated energy for oxygen vacancy formation on the CeO2 (110) surface is notably higher than on the Zr-doped counterpart, supporting the notion that Zr doping enhances the reactivity of the material.

文献讨论了掺杂对金属氧化物催化性质的影响，特别是对于CO氧化和NOx减少这类重要应用。同价掺杂剂（SVD）如Zr4+和高价掺杂剂（HVD）能够进一步提升这些材料的还原性性能。例如，Zr掺杂可以降低CO氧化过程的能量成本，促进CO2的直接形成与释放。文献还指出，Zr掺杂能够削弱CeO键，从而有利于CO的直接氧化。对于CeO2（110）表面，文献表明尽管存在形成氧空位的可能性，但由于CO在表面的高结合能，表面难以实现直接CO氧化，容易被毒化。计算得到的氧空位形成能显示，CeO2（110）表面远高于其Zr掺杂的对应物，这支持了Zr掺杂能够增强材料活性的观点。
