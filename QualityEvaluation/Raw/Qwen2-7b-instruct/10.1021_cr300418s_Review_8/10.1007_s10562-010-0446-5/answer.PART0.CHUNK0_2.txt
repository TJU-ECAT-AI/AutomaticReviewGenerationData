[1] "One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2 and CO2 on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) with small activation energies."
[2] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct formation and release of CO2."
[3] "Our findings satisfactorily explain experimental observations [5] and give indispensable insights for rational manipulations of composition and structure of nanocatalysts that involve oxides."

The introduction discusses the importance of understanding the role of lattice oxygen in CO oxidation on redox oxides. It mentions that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen on ceria, supporting the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The presence of Zr dopants facilitates the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3, weakening the CeO bonds and benefiting the direct formation and release of CO2. The study's findings explain experimental observations and provide insights for manipulating the composition and structure of nanocatalysts involving oxides.
