[1] "One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2  and CO2 on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) with small activation energies."
[2] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct formation and release of CO2."
[3] "Our findings satisfactorily explain experimental observations [5] and give indispensable insights for rational manipulations of composition and structure of nanocatalysts that involve oxides."
[4] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [7]."

The study reveals that CO easily binds to lattice oxygen atoms on ceria and ceria-Zr oxide surfaces to form CO2 with small activation energies. Zr dopants enhance the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, weakening the CeO bonds, which aids in the direct formation and release of CO2. The findings offer insights for the rational manipulation of oxide catalyst compositions and structures. The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism is considered the primary pathway for CO oxidation on ceria surfaces.

研究发现，CO很容易与氧化铈和氧化铈-Zr掺杂表面的晶格氧原子结合形成CO2，且具有较小的活化能。Zr掺杂剂促进了Ce4+到Ce3+的还原，减弱了CeO键，从而有利于直接形成和释放CO2。这些发现为氧化物催化剂成分和结构的合理调控提供了见解。Marsvan Krevelen机制被认为是CO在氧化铈表面氧化的主要途径。
