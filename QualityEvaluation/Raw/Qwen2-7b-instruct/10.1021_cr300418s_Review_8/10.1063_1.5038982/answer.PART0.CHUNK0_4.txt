<p>In this work, the genetic algorithm has been introducted into parameter extraction for on-wafer inductors for up to 110 GHz millimeter-wave operations, and nine independent parameters of the equivalent circuit model are optimized together.</p>
<p>With the genetic algorithm, the model with the optimized parameters gives a better fitting accuracy than the preliminary parameters without optimization. Especially, the fitting accuracy of the Q value achieves a significant improvement after the optimization.</p>
<p>In a genetic algorithm, a population of candidate solutions (called individuals) to an optimization problem is evolved toward better solutions. Each candidate solution has a set of properties (its chromosomes or genotype) which can be mutated and altered; traditionally, solutions are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s, but other encodings are also possible.</p>
<p>The reciprocal of the fitting error of the device characteristics between the model and the electromagnetic simulation is used as the fitness in the algorithm.</p>
<p>TABLE 1 shows the preliminary values and the final values after the GA optimization for the nine model parameters, respectively. As FIGURE 4 shows, the model with the optimized parameters gives a better fitting accuracy than the preliminary parameters without optimization. Especially, the fitting accuracy of the Q value is found to achieve a significant improvement after the optimization with GA.</p>

The genetic algorithm was applied to optimize the parameters of on-wafer inductors for up to 110 GHz operations. It improved the fitting accuracy of the equivalent circuit model, particularly enhancing the Q value's accuracy. The optimization process involved evolving a population of candidate solutions through mutation, crossover, and selection, aiming to find better parameters. The fitness function was based on the reciprocal of the fitting error between the model and electromagnetic simulation data. The optimized parameters resulted in a significantly better fit compared to preliminary values, especially for the Q value.
