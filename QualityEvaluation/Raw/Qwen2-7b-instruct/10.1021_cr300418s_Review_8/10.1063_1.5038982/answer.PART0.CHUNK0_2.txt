<p>In this work, the genetic algorithm has been introducted into parameter extraction for on-wafer inductors for up to 110 GHz millimeter-wave operations, and nine independent parameters of the equivalent circuit model are optimized together.</p>
<p>With the genetic algorithm, the model with the optimized parameters gives a better fitting accuracy than the preliminary parameters without optimization. Especially, the fitting accuracy of the Q value achieves a significant improvement after the optimization.</p>
<p>In a genetic algorithm, a population of candidate solutions (called individuals) to an optimization problem is evolved toward better solutions. Each candidate solution has a set of properties (its chromosomes or genotype) which can be mutated and altered; traditionally, solutions are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s, but other encodings are also possible.</p>
<p>The evolution starts from a population of randomly generated individuals, and is an iterative process, with the population in each iteration called a generation. In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated; the fitness in the optimization problem being solved is defined by the user. The more fit individuals are stochastically selected with a larger probability from the current population, and each individual's genome is modified (recombined and randomly mutated) to form a new generation. The new generation of the candidate solutions is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm.</p>
<p>The algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population.</p>
<p>In parameter extraction of the on-wafer devices, we encode the parameters, which need to be optimized, to a chromosome and each genotype on the chromosome represents a parameter. The population size keeps unchanged in every generation. The reciprocal of the fitting error of the device characteristics between the model and the electromagnetic simulation is used as the fitness in the algorithm.</p>
<p>These nine parameters are encoded into a binary chromosome with length of 90, where every 10 continuous bit sequence in the chromosome is a genotype. The value of each parameter can be decoded with the corresponding genotype. Equation (4) shows the relationship between the genotype and the corresponding parameter value:</p>
<p>GA is used to optimize parameter extraction for on-wafer inductors for up to 110 GHz.</p>
<p>As FIGURE 4 shows, these nine parameters are encoded into a binary chromosome with length of 90, where every 10 continuous bit sequence in the chromosome is a genotype. The value of each parameter can be decoded with the corresponding genotype. Equation (4) shows the relationship between the genotype and the corresponding parameter value:</p>
<p>Where y is the parameter value, x is the genotype in decimal system, Max and Min are the upper and lower optimization boundary, respectively.</p>
<p>The reciprocal of the fitting error of the device characteristics between the model and electromagnetic simulation is used as the fitness in the algorithm. The fitting error  and the fitness are defined as (5) and (6), respectively:</p>
<p>As FIGURE 4 shows, the model with the optimized parameters gives a better fitting accuracy than the preliminary parameters without optimization. Especially, the fitting accuracy of the Q value is found to achieve a significant improvement after the optimization with GA.</p>

This study applies genetic algorithms to optimize the parameters of on-wafer inductors operating up to 110 GHz. It demonstrates that genetic algorithms improve the fitting accuracy of the inductor models significantly compared to preliminary parameters. The genetic algorithm works by evolving a population of potential solutions through generations, with each solution represented as a chromosome. Fitness is determined by the reciprocal of the fitting error between the model predictions and electromagnetic simulation results. The study also outlines how parameters are encoded into binary chromosomes, with specific genotypes representing individual parameters. The algorithm terminates once a satisfactory fitness level is achieved or a predetermined number of generations is reached. The optimized parameters lead to improved fitting accuracy, particularly for the quality factor (Q value) of the inductors.
