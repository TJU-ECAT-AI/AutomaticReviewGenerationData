<p>In this work, the genetic algorithm has been introducted into parameter extraction for on-wafer inductors for up to 110 GHz millimeter-wave operations, and nine independent parameters of the equivalent circuit model are optimized together.</p>
<p>With the genetic algorithm, the model with the optimized parameters gives a better fitting accuracy than the preliminary parameters without optimization. Especially, the fitting accuracy of the Q value achieves a significant improvement after the optimization.</p>
<p>Parameter extraction and modeling with high accuracy for devices in the integrated circuit are very important.</p>
<p>Although there are usually different modeling and parameter extraction methods for a certain kind of device, in most cases, optimization (finding best-fit parameters) needs to be taken to fit the model to the measured characteristics of the on-wafer device.</p>
<p>In this work, a set of on-wafer inductors fabricated on HLMC 40 nm RF CMOS process are investigated. The model parameters of the inductors are extracted from the electromagnetic (EM) simulations, which are validated by the de-embedded measurements of the fabricated devices.</p>
<p>The evolution starts from a population of randomly generated individuals, and is an iterative process, with the population in each generation called a generation. In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated; the fitness in the optimization problem being solved is defined by the user. The more fit individuals are stochastically selected with a larger probability from the current population, and each individual's genome is modified (recombined and randomly mutated) to form a new generation. The new generation of the candidate solutions is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm.</p>
<p>These nine parameters are encoded into a binary chromosome with length of 90, where every 10 continuous bit sequence in the chromosome is a genotype. The value of each parameter can be decoded with the corresponding genotype.</p>

This study applies genetic algorithms to optimize the parameters of on-wafer inductors operating up to 110 GHz. It demonstrates that genetic algorithms improve the fitting accuracy of the inductor models significantly compared to preliminary parameters. The genetic algorithm works by evolving a population of potential solutions through generations, with each solution represented as a chromosome. Fitness is determined by the reciprocal of the fitting error between the model predictions and electromagnetic simulation results. The study also outlines how parameters are encoded into binary chromosomes, with specific genotypes representing individual parameters. The algorithm terminates once a satisfactory fitness level is achieved or a predetermined number of generations is reached. The optimized parameters lead to improved fitting accuracy, particularly for the quality factor (Q value) of the inductors.
