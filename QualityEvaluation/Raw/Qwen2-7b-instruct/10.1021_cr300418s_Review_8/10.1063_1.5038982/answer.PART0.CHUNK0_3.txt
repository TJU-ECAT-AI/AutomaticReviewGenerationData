The genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of on-wafer inductors for up to 110 GHz millimeter-wave operations. This method improves the fitting accuracy significantly compared to preliminary parameter extraction without optimization. The parameters are encoded into a binary chromosome, and the reciprocal of the fitting error between the model and electromagnetic simulation is used as the fitness function. The genetic algorithm optimizes all nine independent parameters of the equivalent circuit model efficiently, requiring fewer iterations to achieve a satisfactory solution.

遗传算法被应用于优化110 GHz毫米波操作下的在片电感器参数。与未进行优化的初步参数提取方法相比，这种方法显著提高了拟合精度。参数以二进制染色体的形式编码，用于计算模型与电磁仿真之间的拟合误差倒数作为适应度函数。遗传算法优化等效电路模型中的所有九个独立参数，需要更少的迭代次数即可达到满意的结果。
