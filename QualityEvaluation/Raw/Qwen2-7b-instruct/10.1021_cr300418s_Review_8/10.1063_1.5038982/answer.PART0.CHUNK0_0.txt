<p>In this work, the genetic algorithm has been introducted into parameter extraction for on-wafer inductors for up to 110 GHz millimeter-wave operations, and nine independent parameters of the equivalent circuit model are optimized together.</p>
<p>With the genetic algorithm, the model with the optimized parameters gives a better fitting accuracy than the preliminary parameters without optimization. Especially, the fitting accuracy of the Q value achieves a significant improvement after the optimization.</p>
<p>Parameter extraction and modeling with high accuracy for devices in the integrated circuit are very important.</p>
<p>Although there are usually different modeling and parameter extraction methods for a certain kind of device, in most cases, optimization (finding best-fit parameters) needs to be taken to fit the model to the measured characteristics of the on-wafer device.</p>
<p>In this work, a set of on-wafer inductors fabricated on HLMC 40 nm RF CMOS process are investigated. The model parameters of the inductors are extracted from the electromagnetic (EM) simulations, which are validated by the de-embedded measurements of the fabricated devices.</p>
<p>The evolution starts from a population of randomly generated individuals, and is an iterative process, with the population in each generation called a generation. In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated; the fitness in the optimization problem being solved is defined by the user. The more fit individuals are stochastically selected with a larger probability from the current population, and each individual's genome is modified (recombined and randomly mutated) to form a new generation. The new generation of the candidate solutions is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm.</p>
<p>These nine parameters are encoded into a binary chromosome with length of 90, where every 10 continuous bit sequence in the chromosome is a genotype. The value of each parameter can be decoded with the corresponding genotype.</p>
<p>The reciprocal of the fitting error of the device characteristics between the model and electromagnetic simulation is used as the fitness in the algorithm.</p>
<p>TABLE 1 shows the preliminary values and the final values after the GA optimization for the nine model parameters, respectively. As FIGURE 4 shows, the model with the optimized parameters gives a better fitting accuracy than the preliminary parameters without optimization. Especially, the fitting accuracy of the Q value is found to achieve a significant improvement after the optimization with GA.</p>
<p>With the genetic algorithm, all the parameters of the equivalent circuit model can be optimized and without too many iterations (generations) needed to get a satisfying solution.</p>

The genetic algorithm was applied to optimize the parameters of on-wafer inductors, leading to improved fitting accuracy, especially for the Q value. The process involves encoding parameters into a binary chromosome, evaluating fitness through the reciprocal of the fitting error, and iteratively refining the model parameters through genetic operations. The optimized model demonstrated superior accuracy compared to preliminary parameters.
