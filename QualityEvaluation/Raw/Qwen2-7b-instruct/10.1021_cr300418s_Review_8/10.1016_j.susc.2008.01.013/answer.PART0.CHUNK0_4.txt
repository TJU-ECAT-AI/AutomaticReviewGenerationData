The literature discusses the effects of Zr doping on the atomic, electronic, and catalytic properties of ceria and ceria/zirconia mixed oxides. Specifically, it shows that Zr doping facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies at the ceria(111) surface, lowers the formation energy of these vacancies, and enhances the reduction of ceria, making it more reactive. The doping also modifies the electronic structure of the surface, leading to the localization of excess electrons on Ce ions near the vacancy. These changes contribute to the improved redox properties and thermal stability of ceria-based catalysts, particularly when combined with zirconia. The computational methods used involve density functional theory with the inclusion of on-site Coulomb interaction to accurately describe the correlated electron behavior in the Ce 4f states.

文献讨论了Zr掺杂对铈和铈锆复合氧化物的原子、电子和催化性质的影响。具体来说，它表明Zr掺杂促进了铈(111)表面氧空位的形成，降低了氧空位的形成能，并增强了铈的还原性，使其更具活性。掺杂还改变了表面的电子结构，导致多余电子在空位附近的铈离子上局部化。这些变化有助于提高铈基催化剂的还原性和热稳定性，特别是与锆结合时。所使用计算方法涉及密度泛函理论，包含局域电荷相互作用，以准确描述铈4f状态中的相关电子行为。
