[1] "It is found that (i) Zr doping induces a severe distortion of the unreduced surface structure; (ii) at the reduced Zr-doped ceria(111) surface, the oxygen anions around the oxygen vacancy show much larger displacements than those on the pure CeO2(111) surface; (iii) an oxygen vacancy is more easily formed around the Zr dopant, and the reduction energy is lowered by about 0.5 eV; (iv) the excess electrons left by the removed oxygen atom localize on the two Ce cations neighboring the vacancy and thus brings about the reduction of the two Ce4+ ions; and (v) the atomic structure modification induced by the Zr doping plays a vital role in facilitating the reduction of the ceriazirconia solid solution as compared to the pure ceria."
[2] "In contrast, the relaxation on the (111) surface of the Zr-doped ceria is found to be so large that the structure is significantly disturbed, especially in the vicinity of the Zr doping centers. The largest change takes place in the top layers, where the three oxygen atoms nearest to the Zr move towards the Zr center by 0.192 A as shown in Fig. 2."
[3] "The formation of each oxygen vacancy results in the reduction of two Ce cations neighboring the O vacancy."
[4] "The effects of Zr doping in enhancing the reactivity of CeO2 are in agreement with Metius finding that doping can modify the reactivity of oxide-based catalysts [30,31]."

The presence of Zr dopants significantly alters the atomic structure and electronic properties of ceria surfaces, facilitating oxygen vacancy formation and reducing the associated energy barrier. Specifically, Zr doping leads to substantial distortions in the surface structure, particularly in the vicinity of the dopant atoms. Oxygen anions around the oxygen vacancy show larger displacements compared to pure ceria surfaces. This distortion enhances the formation of oxygen vacancies and lowers their energy, making the surface more reactive. The excess electrons from the removed oxygen atom localize on the surrounding Ce ions, leading to their reduction. The atomic structure modifications induced by Zr doping play a crucial role in increasing the reactivity of ceria compared to pure ceria. These findings align with the observation that the addition of zirconium to ceria improves its redox properties and thermal stability, potentially through similar mechanisms.

锆掺杂显著改变了铈氧化物表面的原子结构和电子性质，促进了氧空位的形成并降低了相关能垒。具体而言，锆掺杂导致表面结构在掺杂原子附近发生显著扭曲。氧离子围绕氧空位的位移与纯铈氧化物表面相比更大。这种扭曲增强了氧空位的形成，并降低了其能量，使表面更具反应性。从被移除的氧原子中剩余的电子局部化到周围的铈离子上，导致它们的还原。由锆掺杂引起的原子结构修改对增加铈氧化物的活性起着关键作用，与纯铈氧化物相比。这些发现与锆的添加提高了铈的还原性和热稳定性的观察结果相吻合，可能通过类似机制实现。
