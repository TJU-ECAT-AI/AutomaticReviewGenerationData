The study examines the interaction of hydrogen with the (110) and (111) surfaces of ceria through ab initio calculations using density functional theory. The use of a Hubbard U term enhances the accuracy of the electronic structure description. An OHO bridge forms on the (110) surface, while an axial tricoordinated OH group results on the (111) surface. Adsorption of an H atom on these surfaces is energetically favored by 150.8 and 128.3 kJ/mol, respectively. Vibrational frequencies for the OH stretching mode are 3100 cm-1 for the (110) surface and 3627 cm-1 for the (111) surface. The final geometries support the existence of hydrogen-bonded OH groups in polycrystalline CeO2. The DFT + U methodology yields electronic structures in agreement with experimental findings. Adsorption leads to the +4/+3 reduction of a single Ce ion, and the OH stretching frequencies correlate well with experimental data, albeit with some discrepancies between the predicted and reported values.

本文通过密度泛函理论的ab initio计算研究了铈氧化物（CeO2）的（110）和（111）表面与原子氢之间的相互作用。添加Hubbard U项可以提高对表面电子结构描述的准确性。在（110）表面上形成OHO桥，而在（111）表面上形成轴向三配位OH基团。氢原子吸附在这两个表面上的能量分别为150.8和128.3 kJ/mol，分别对应于自由分子H2。两种表面的OH伸展振动频率分别为3100 cm-1和3627 cm-1。最终几何形状支持聚晶CeO2中氢键结合的OH基团的存在。DFT + U方法得到的电子结构与实验结果相吻合。吸附导致Ce离子从+4到+3的氧化还原，并且OH伸展频率与实验数据具有良好的一致性，尽管存在预测值与报告值之间的某些差异。

The study focuses on the interaction between hydrogen and ceria surfaces (110) and (111) using density functional theory. The adsorption of hydrogen on these surfaces leads to the reduction of a Ce ion and the formation of specific OH groups. The (110) surface forms an OHO bridge, while the (111) surface creates an axial tricoordinated OH group. Both processes are energetically favorable, with the (110) surface requiring 150.8 kJ/mol and the (111) surface needing 128.3 kJ/mol compared to free molecular hydrogen. The OH stretching vibrations yield frequencies of 3100 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the (110) surface and 3627 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the (111) surface.

The study focuses on the interaction of hydrogen with the (110) and (111) surfaces of ceria (CeO2) through ab initio calculations based on density functional theory. The calculations reveal that the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on these surfaces is energetically favored. Specifically, the adsorption energy on the (110) surface is 150.8 kJ/mol, and on the (111) surface, it is 128.3 kJ/mol, compared to free molecular hydrogen. Vibrational frequency calculations show that the OH stretching frequency for the (110) surface is 3100 cm<sup>-1</sup>, while for the (111) surface, it is 3627 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The final configurations suggest that the (110) surface forms an OHO bridge, and the (111) surface creates an axial tricoordinated OH group upon hydrogen adsorption. The discrepancies between the calculated and reported OH stretching frequencies for the (110) surface are attributed to factors such as surface coverage, nature of the adsorbed hydrogen atom, and the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional used in the calculations.
