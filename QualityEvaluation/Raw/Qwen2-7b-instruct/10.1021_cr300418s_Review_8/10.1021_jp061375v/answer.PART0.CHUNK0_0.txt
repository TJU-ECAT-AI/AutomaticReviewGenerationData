The one for the (111) surface, 3627 cm-1, is in very close agreement with the experimental value reported for a tricoordinated OH group; the value of 3100 cm-1 calculated for the (110) surface is considerably lower than the values quoted in the literature for an H-bonded OH group.</p>

The study examines the interaction of hydrogen with the (110) and (111) surfaces of ceria through ab initio calculations using density functional theory. The use of a Hubbard U term enhances the accuracy of the electronic structure description. An OHO bridge forms on the (110) surface, while an axial tricoordinated OH group results on the (111) surface. Adsorption of an H atom on these surfaces is energetically favored by 150.8 and 128.3 kJ/mol, respectively. Vibrational frequencies for the OH stretching mode are 3100 cm-1 for the (110) surface and 3627 cm-1 for the (111) surface. The final geometries support the existence of hydrogen-bonded OH groups in polycrystalline CeO2. The DFT + U methodology yields electronic structures in agreement with experimental findings. Adsorption leads to the +4/+3 reduction of a single Ce ion, and the OH stretching frequencies correlate well with experimental data, albeit with some discrepancies between the predicted and reported values.

本文通过密度泛函理论的ab initio计算研究了铈氧化物（CeO2）的（110）和（111）表面与原子氢之间的相互作用。添加Hubbard U项可以提高对表面电子结构描述的准确性。在（110）表面上形成OHO桥，而在（111）表面上形成轴向三配位OH基团。氢原子吸附在这两个表面上的能量分别为150.8和128.3 kJ/mol，分别对应于自由分子H2。两种表面的OH伸展振动频率分别为3100 cm-1和3627 cm-1。最终几何形状支持聚晶CeO2中氢键结合的OH基团的存在。DFT + U方法得到的电子结构与实验结果相吻合。吸附导致Ce离子从+4到+3的氧化还原，并且OH伸展频率与实验数据具有良好的一致性，尽管存在预测值与报告值之间的某些差异。
