[1] "Cerium reduction in cerium oxide is known to be triggered by high-temperature treatment under vacuum; however, the same effect can be obtained at lower temperatures when the material is exposed to a chemically reducing atmosphere."
[2] "The calculated density of states for the two surfaces in the presence of adsorbed H are qualitatively similar, the main features being the two new peaks (as compared to the clean surfaces) at higher and lower energy with respect to the O 2p valence band."
[3] "The final adsorption geometry on the (111) surface (H atom on top of an exposed O atom) has been experimentally observed with noncontact atomic force microscopy as a set of 0.30.5 Å high protrusions."
[4] "Our calculations provide a sensible description of the hydrogen adsorption process and of its final minimum energy configuration, which unambiguously shows concomitant reduction of one Ce ion per adsorbed H atom."
[5] "The use of a DFT + U methodology allows calculation of electronic structures in good agreement with experimental results."
[6] "Adsorption energies for the (110) and (111) surfaces are 150.8 and 128.3 kJ/mol, respectively, indicating that the adsorption of molecular hydrogen on these surfaces of ceria is energetically favored."
[7] "The OH stretching frequencies in the final relaxed configurations of the two surfaces were estimated. The one for the (111) surface, 3627 cm-1, is in very close agreement with the experimental value reported for a tricoordinated OH group; the value of 3100 cm-1 calculated for the (110) surface is considerably lower than the values quoted in the literature for an H-bonded OH group."

1. The interaction of hydrogen with cerium oxide surfaces was studied through ab initio calculations using density functional theory with a Hubbard U term to accurately describe the electronic structure of the surfaces. The minimum energy configurations for the adsorbed hydrogen on the (110) and (111) surfaces were obtained, with an OHO bridge forming on the (110) surface and an axial tricoordinated OH group on the (111) surface.

2. The computational study revealed that the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on the (110) and (111) surfaces of ceria is energetically favored by 150.8 and 128.3 kJ/mol, respectively, compared to free molecular hydrogen.

3. Vibrational properties of the OH stretching mode were estimated for both surfaces, with the calculated frequencies being 3100 cm-1 for the (110) surface and 3627 cm-1 for the (111) surface, closely agreeing with experimental data.

4. The use of the DFT + U methodology was crucial for this study, as it allowed the accurate calculation of electronic structures for partially reduced cerium oxides, overcoming the limitations of standard DFT approaches.

5. The adsorption process led to the +4/+3 reduction of a single cerium ion per adsorbed hydrogen atom, accompanied by the formation of oxyhydroxy surface species.

6. The calculated density of states for the surfaces in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen showed two new peaks, one at higher energy and the other at lower energy compared to the O 2p valence band.

7. The final geometry for the (111) surface, with the hydrogen atom on top of an exposed oxygen atom, matched experimental observations, providing insights into the interaction between hydrogen and ceria surfaces.

1. 对铈氧化物表面与氢的相互作用进行了研究，通过基于密度泛函理论的ab initio计算，并使用Hubbard U项来准确描述表面的电子结构。在(110)和(111)表面上吸附氢原子的最小能量配置被获得，(110)表面上形成了OHO桥接，而(111)表面上形成了一个三重联结的OH组分。

2. 计算结果显示，原子氢在铈氧化物(110)和(111)表面上的吸附能分别是150.8和128.3千焦每摩尔，分别高于自由分子氢的能量。

3. 对于两个表面，OH拉伸模式的振动频率被估算，(110)表面为3100厘米^-1，(111)表面为3627厘米^-1，与实验数据高度一致。

4. DFT + U方法对于此研究至关重要，它允许对部分还原的铈氧化物进行精确的电子结构计算，克服了标准DFT方法的局限性。

5. 吸附过程导致每个吸附氢原子还原一个铈离子，伴随着氧氢化表面物种的形成。

6. 表面在存在吸附氢的情况下，其密度态图显示了两个新的峰值，一个位于O 2p价带之上，另一个位于之下。
