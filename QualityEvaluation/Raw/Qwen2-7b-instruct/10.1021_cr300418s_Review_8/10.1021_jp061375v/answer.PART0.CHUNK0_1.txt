The study focuses on the interaction between hydrogen and ceria surfaces (110) and (111) using density functional theory. The adsorption of hydrogen on these surfaces leads to the reduction of a Ce ion and the formation of specific OH groups. The (110) surface forms an OHO bridge, while the (111) surface creates an axial tricoordinated OH group. Both processes are energetically favorable, with the (110) surface requiring 150.8 kJ/mol and the (111) surface needing 128.3 kJ/mol compared to free molecular hydrogen. The OH stretching vibrations yield frequencies of 3100 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the (110) surface and 3627 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the (111) surface.

研究关注了密度泛函理论在CeO2表面（110）和（111）上氢的吸附。氢的吸附导致Ce离子的还原和特定OH团簇的形成。在（110）表面上形成了OHO桥，而在（111）表面上形成了轴向三配位的OH团簇。这两个过程都是能量有利的，（110）表面需要150.8 kJ/mol，而（111）表面需要128.3 kJ/mol与自由分子氢相比。OH伸缩振动的频率分别为（110）表面3100 cm<sup>-1</sup>和（111）表面3627 cm<sup>-1</sup>。
