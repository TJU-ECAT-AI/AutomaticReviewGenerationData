[1] "Recent work21-24 clearly shows the high predictive power of this method for cerium oxide based materials with respect to current standard DFT approaches."
[2] "The interaction of hydrogen with ceria leads to its partial reduction and hence to occupation of Ce 4f states."
[3] "From the analysis of the projected density of states, it can be seen that the adsorption of an H atom causes the +4/+3 reduction of a single Ce ion."
[4] "The OH stretching frequencies in the final relaxed configurations of the two surfaces were estimated. The one for the (111) surface, 3627 cm-1, is in very close agreement with the experimental value reported for a tricoordinated OH group."
[5] "Reasons for this disagreement might be the low population of (110) exposed facets in the polycrystalline samples used in the experiments, a possible dependence of the stretching frequency upon the coverage and/or the partial inadequacy of the exchange-correlation functional used in the calculations."

1. The DFT + U methodology allows for the accurate calculation of electronic structures in cerium oxide-based materials, particularly concerning the occupation of Ce 4f states upon hydrogen interaction.
2. The adsorption of an H atom leads to the reduction of a single Ce ion, which is one of the nearest neighbors of the adsorbed hydrogen.
3. The OH stretching frequency for the (111) surface, estimated to be 3627 cm-1, closely matches the experimental value for a tricoordinated OH group.
4. The discrepancy in the calculated OH stretching frequency for the (110) surface compared to the literature values could be attributed to factors such as low population of (110) facets, coverage effects, or limitations of the exchange-correlation functional.

1. 这种方法对于铈氧化物基材料与标准DFT方法相比，显示出很高的预测能力。
2. 吸附的H原子导致铈离子从+4价变为+3价。
3. 对于(111)表面，最终放松配置中OH拉伸频率估算值为3627 cm-1，这与三配位OH基团的实验值非常接近。
4. (110)表面上计算的OH拉伸频率与文献值之间的差异可能是因为样品中(110)面的低存在率、覆盖效应或交换相关功能的不准确性。
