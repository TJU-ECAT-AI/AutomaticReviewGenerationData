The study focuses on the interaction of hydrogen with the (110) and (111) surfaces of ceria (CeO2) through ab initio calculations based on density functional theory. The calculations reveal that the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on these surfaces is energetically favored. Specifically, the adsorption energy on the (110) surface is 150.8 kJ/mol, and on the (111) surface, it is 128.3 kJ/mol, compared to free molecular hydrogen. Vibrational frequency calculations show that the OH stretching frequency for the (110) surface is 3100 cm<sup>-1</sup>, while for the (111) surface, it is 3627 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The final configurations suggest that the (110) surface forms an OHO bridge, and the (111) surface creates an axial tricoordinated OH group upon hydrogen adsorption. The discrepancies between the calculated and reported OH stretching frequencies for the (110) surface are attributed to factors such as surface coverage, nature of the adsorbed hydrogen atom, and the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional used in the calculations.

研究重点是通过基于密度泛函理论的从头算方法，探讨氢与CeO2的（110）和（111）表面的相互作用。计算结果表明，原子氢在这两个表面上的吸附是能量有利的。具体而言，（110）表面的吸附能为150.8 kJ/mol，而（111）表面为128.3 kJ/mol，与自由分子氢相比。振动频率计算显示，（110）表面的OH伸缩频率为3100 cm<sup>-1</sup>，（111）表面为3627 cm<sup>-1</sup>。最终配置表明，（110）表面形成一个OHO桥接，而（111）表面在氢吸附后形成一个轴向三配位OH组。（110）表面的计算和报道的OH伸缩频率之间的差异被归因于表面覆盖率、吸附氢原子的性质以及用于计算的交换相关功能的局限性等因素。
