We combine ﬁrst-principles calculations with EXAFS studies to investigate the origin of high oxygen storage capacity in ceria-
zirconia solid solution, prepared by solution combustion method. We ﬁnd that nanocrystalline Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 can be reduced to
Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.57 by H2 upto 850 C with an OSC of 65 cc/gm which is extremely high. Calculated local atomic-scale structure reveals
the presence of long and short bonds resulting in four-fold coordination of the cations, conﬁrmed by the EXAFS studies. Bond
valence analysis of the microscopic structure and energetics is used to evaluate the strength of binding of diﬀerent oxide ions and
vacancies. We ﬁnd the presence of strongly and weakly bound oxygens, of which the latter are responsible for the higher oxygen
storage capacity in the mixed oxides than in the pure CeO2.

1. Introduction
Amount of oxygen that can be released under
reducing condition and to uptake it under oxidizing
condition is called oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [1,2].
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) by H2 is
generally employed to estimate OSC. The mechanism of
CeO2–Ce2O3 transition associated with oxygen vacancy
formation was explained on the basis of ﬁrst-principles
calculations as a possible reason behind the high OSC of
ceria [3]. Even though ZrO2 cannot be reduced by CO or
H2, OSC was enhanced in the Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solution
[4–6]. This means, in the solid solution, Ce can be
reduced lot more easily compared to pure CeO2.
Because of its importance in auto exhaust catalysis,
several studies exist in the literature to explain this
observation [7–9]. It was suggested that the availability
of free oxygen is increased by the transport of bulk
oxygen to surface [10]. Later, movement of oxide ions
from the tetrahedral sites to the vacant octahedral sites
was suggested to be one of possibilities which can
enhance OSC [11]. A common observation is that the
X-ray diﬀraction lines of Ce1-xZrxO2 are much broader
in the solid solution. This is generally attributed to the
decrease in size of crystallites and therefore higher OSC
was attributed to larger surface area of Ce1-xZrxO2. It is
also possible that the local coordination around Zr in
Ce1-xZrxO2 is diﬀerent from the ideal eight-fold coor-
dination of Ce in CeO2, which can lead to broadening of
X-ray lines. EXAFS studies have revealed 4+4 coordi-
nation for Zr in Ce1-xZrxO2 [12,13]. Atomistic and
ﬁrst-principles calculations have been valuable in studies
of ceria, its surfaces [14] and interaction with Hydrogen
[15]. Important study has been done on the role of
oxygen vacancies on ceria surfaces in the oxidation of
carbon
monoxide
[16].
Higher
OSC
or
increased
reducibility of CeO2 in the CeO2–ZrO2 solid solution
has not been satisfactorily explained in the earlier
studies, as referred above. Here we report H2/TPR of
Ce1-xZrxO2 and a ﬁrst
principles
structural
study
of solid solutions. Theoretically determined structure of
Ce1-xZrxO2 is compared with results of EXAFS. We
show that oxygen sublattice is signiﬁcantly distorted
leading to destabilization of oxide ions in terms of
Ce–O, Zr–O distances.
2. Methods
2.1. Experiment
Ce1-xZrxO2 has been prepared by solution combus-
tion method. Stoichiometric amounts of ceric ammo-
nium nitrate, zirconium nitrate and glycine were taken
in a glass vessel; the salts were dissolved into solution by
adding minimum amount of water. The solution was
heated rapidly at 350 C. At the point of complete water
evaporation, the material ignites into a ﬂame reaching a
temperature of above 900 C. After the combustion is
complete, the sample cools to 350 C in about 1 min.
The product was ﬁne powder of Ce1-xZrxO2 which was
analysed. Hydrogen uptake was measured by tempera-
ture programmed reduction with 5% H2 in Ar from
30 C to 850 C. Volume of H2 taken up for reduction is
calibrated against that of CuO. The chemical reactions

EXAFS at the Zr K-edge were recorded in trans-
mission mode at the EXAFS-1 Beamline at Elettra
Synchrotron Source using Si(111) as monochromator.
The incident and transmitted ﬂux was measured using
ionization chambers ﬁlled with a mixture of N2 and Ar
and pure Ar gases respectively. For the measurements,
absorbers were prepared in the form of self-supporting
pellets (40 mg) of about 10 mm diameter. The amount
of sample was zalculated such that total absorption
coeﬃcient (lx) after the edge was around than 2.5. The
energy was calibrated with respect to Cu K-edge in Cu
metal. Three scans of each were recorded in the energy
interval 17,750–19,000 eV in steps of 5 eV in the pre-
edge region (200 eV),and 2 eV for the rest of the scan.
Data analysis was done using the open source IFEFFIT
analysis package developed by Matt Newville at the
University of Chicago.
2.2. Theory
Our total energy calculations are based on density
functional theory (DFT) with a local density approxi-
mation (LDA) to the exchange correlation energy of
electrons. While the LDA+U type of corrections are
known to be important in reduced form of ceria [17], we
are mainly interested in the atomic structure which is
expected to be less sensitive to these corrections. Inter-
action between valence electrons and ionic cores is
treated using ﬁrst-principles ultra-soft pseudopotentials
[18] and single particle wavefunctions (density) were
represented with a plane wave basis with an energy
cutoﬀof 30 Ry (150 Ry). Semi-core states of Ce and Zr
are included in the valence. We use PWSCF [19]
implementation of DFT for these calculations. Zr sub-
stitution in CeO2 is treated using periodic supercells of
up to 8 formula units of CeO2 with Ce atoms replaced
with Zr according to diﬀerent concentrations of Zr
substitution. Internal structure in each case was opti-
mized to minimize the total energy using the Broyden,
Fletcher, Goldfarb, Shanno (BFGS)-based method [20].
Integrals over the Brillouin zone were sampled on
444
k-point Monkhorst–Pack [21] mesh for pure
CeO2, pure ZrO2 and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 which were simu-
lated with a cubic unit cell with four formula units of
MO2
(M=metal
ion).
For
Ce0.875Zr0.125O2
and
Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 we used a tetragonal supercell (doubled
in the ab-plane, c/a=0.71) with eight formula units
and
Brillouin
zone
was
sampled
on
a
334
Monkhorst–Pack [21] k-point mesh.
The bond distances determined from the optimized
structures are used to calculate valencies of metal ions
following the bond valence method [22]. Bond valence s
is deﬁned as: (a) s=(R/Ro))N (for Zr–O bonds) and (b)
s=exp[)(R)Ro)/B] (for Ce–O bonds), where R is the
bond length, Ro is the length of a bond of unit valence,
N and B are ﬁtted parameters. For Ce–O and Zr–O
bonds,RLDA
o
¼ Ro aLDA
aexp , where aLDA is the lattice con-
stant from our theoretical calculations and aexp is the
experimental lattice constant. The atomic valence V is
obtained by summing the bond valencies associated with
a particular ion given by V=Sisi.
3. Results
As seen from the X-ray diﬀraction patterns of Ce1-
xZrxO2 (x=0.0–0.5) (given in ﬁgure 1), the oxides
crystallize in ﬂuorite structure. On Zr substitution, X-
ray line widths become broader compared to pure CeO2.
Lattice parameters of the oxides have been determined
and a decrease in a’ for the Zr substituted oxides is
observed as expected (see table 1). The average crystal-
lite size of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 obtained from Scherrer’s for-
mula is 18 nm. Hydrogen uptake as a function of
temperature is shown in ﬁgure 2. Note, the y scales are
diﬀerent for the diﬀerent samples. For pure CeO2, the
total H2 uptake upto 850 C corresponds to the reduc-
tion of CeO2 to CeO1.92. Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 gets reduced to
Ce0.75Zr0.25O1.70.

Zr k-edge EXAFS in Ce0.5 Zr0.5 O2 and Ce0.7 Zr0.3 O2
was Fourier transformed (FT) in the k-range 2 A
˚ )1-
12 A
˚ )1 with k2 weighting. The resulting magnitudes of
FT in the range 1 A
˚ –4 A
˚
along with the back trans-
formed data are presented in ﬁgure 3. The magnitude of
FT shows a strong peak at about 2.1 A
˚ corresponding
to Zr–O correlations. Some more peaks are also seen in
the range 3 A
˚ corresponding to Zr–O correlations. Some
more peaks are also seen in the range 3 A
˚ –4 A
˚
which
could be ascribed to Zr–Zr(Ce) and Zr–O coordination
shells.
The ﬁrst peak was ﬁtted using Zr–O correlation with
diﬀerent combination of coordination numbers. In the
ﬁrst instance, a single shell ﬁtting was performed. This
ﬁtting gave a coordination number of 3.8 at 2.18 A
˚ .
However, 8 oxygens surround the metal ion in the
ﬂuorite structure. Hence coordination of 3.8 is not sat-
isfactory. A two-shell ﬁtting was carried out with ﬁxed
coordination numbers. Three models were used to ﬁt the
data. In all the cases the total coordination number was
8 but was arrived at through diﬀerent combinations
namely, 6+2, 4+4 and 4+2+2. The results of all these
ﬁttings are presented in table 2. Vlaic et al. [12] have
used such combinations for the analysis of their Zr K
EXAFS in Rh/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. In case of 6+2 combina-
tion, the Zr–O bond distances obtained were 2.20 and
2.52 A
˚ . The ﬁrst distance of 2.20 A
˚ is higher than Zr–O

distance expected in pure ZrO2 and the second distance
is quite long. Such a long distance has not been reported
earlier. Vlaic et al. have reported a Zr–O bond at 2.6 A
˚
in Rh/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 with coordination number 2 in their
4, 2 and 2 model. In case of 4+4 model, the Zr–O dis-
tances obtained were 2.17 and 2.30 A
˚ . As can be seen
the ﬁrst distance closely matches with Zr–O distance in
ZrO2 and the second one is close to the Ce–O distance in
pure CeO2. In the case of a three-shell ﬁt with 4+2+2
coordination numbers the distances obtained were 2.15,
2.31 and 2.64 A
˚ , respectively. But as can be seen from
table 2 the r2 for the correlation at 2.31 A
˚ is negative.
Thus from the EXAFS analysis of the ﬁrst peak 4+4
coordination of oxide ions around Zr ion gives the best
ﬁt. Further the second shell correlations namely: Zr–Zr,
Zr–Ce and Zr–O were included in the ﬁtting. The
parameters obtained are presented in table 2 and the
complete ﬁtting in the back-transformed space is shown
in ﬁgure 3. The data is ﬁtted for the three diﬀerent
coordinations of Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 also. Clearly, 4+4 coor-
dination of oxygen around Zr is better than 6+2 or
4+2+2 coordinations. The ﬁtting is good as can be seen
from the ﬁgure. The bond lengths and debye waller
factors remain almost same irrespective of oxygen
coordination in the ﬁrst shell. Similar 4+4 coordination
for Zr ion is found by Lemaux et al. [13].
The lattice constants determined from ﬁrst princi-
ples calculations are within the typical DFT errors
with respect to their experimental values (see table 1).
The local coordination of cations in the optimised
structure of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 is shown in ﬁgure 4(a). As
labelled in the ﬁgure, oxygens O1, O3, O6, O8 form
short Zr–O bonds and while oxygens O2, O4, O5, O7
form long Zr–O bonds. Four of the eight nearest
neighbour oxide ions come closer to Zr ion, resulting
in coordination of four with average distance of
2.03 A
˚ . O3 forms a short bond with Zr and a long
bond with Ce, while O7 forms a long bond with Zr
and a short bond with Ce. Hence oxygens farther from
the Zr ion are closer to the Ce ion and vice versa. The
average distance of the four nearest oxygens around
Ce ion is 2.26 A
˚ . The average Zr–O, Zr–Zr and Zr–Ce
distances obtained from the calculation are given in
table 2. As can be seen from the table, the calculated

values agree quite well with the 4+4 coordination
model in the EXAFS experiment.
With access to local structural details, we did bond
valence analysis to uncover the cause for the enhanced
observed OSC. The parameters used in the bond valence
calculation [22] are given in table 3. For pure CeO2, the
average valency of Ce is 3.97 and that of an oxygen is
1.99. For pure ZrO2, two types of average valencies of
Zr are 4.11 and 3.90. The average oxygen valency is
1.98. Thus, the metal and oxygen valencies in pure
oxides are close to the expected values of 4.0 and 2.0,
respectively.
In Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, as given in table 4, the oxygens
with three Ce–O long bonds and one Zr–O short bond
have valency lower than 2.0 and the oxygens with 3 Ce–
O short bonds and 1 Zr–O long bond have valency
greater than 2.0. For other concentrations of Zr also, the
oxygens can be grouped into the two types as in
Ce0.75Zr0.25O2. The increase in oxygen valencies above
2.0 shows that these oxygens are strongly bonded. The
oxygens whose valencies are lower than 2.0, are weakly
bonded. The average Zr valencies in Ce0.50Zr0.50O2
Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2 are 3.54, 3.62 and
3.47,
respectively.

Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2 are

It is noteworthy that the valency of the weakly bon-
ded oxygen in Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 is 1.86 and that of
Ce0.75Zr0.25O1.75 is 1.87 (vacancy introduced mixed
oxide will be discussed later). In Ba2YCu3O7, [23] the
valency of the oxygen in the Cu–O plane is about 1.87
and this particular oxygen is weakly bonded with the
eﬀect that it can be desorbed at about 400 C and is
available as free oxygen. Therefore, in ceria-zirconia
solid solution, oxide ions having valency close to 1.87

H2 or CO.
Distribution of cation to oxygen distances given in
ﬁgure 5(a) shows the presence of a single Ce–O bond
length in pure CeO2 at 2.36 A
˚ . On Zr substitution, bond
lengths can be divided into two categories short and
long, where the short category falls below 2.36 A
˚ , and
the long category falls above 2.36 A
˚ . In Ce0.875Zr0.125O2,
three types of short and three types of long bonds are
found. In Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, two types of short and two
types of long bonds are found. In pure ZrO2, even
though there are short and long bonds, all the bond
lengths fall under the short category. The long bonds are
weaker and the short bonds are stronger, hence avail-
ability of longer bonds in Zr doped CeO2 lead to higher
oxygen storage capacity than pure CeO2 and pure ZrO2.

Table 5 show the average value of bond lengths in Zr
substituted CeO2. Thus from the bond valence analysis,
two type of oxygens can be identiﬁed: type 1 (strong),
type 2 (weak).
The total cohesive energy E can be expressed in terms
of bond energy (b): (b) D(b) db=E, D(b) being the
distribution of bond-lengths or the bond-length density.
To determine energies of short and long bonds in
Ce1-xZrxO2, we assume the following simple rela-
tion:Etype1
Etype2 ¼ avðstype1Þ
avðstype2Þ, where av(s) is the average bond
valence of a type of bond. According to the bond
valence theory, valence of an atom is a measure of its
involvement in bonding [22]. As the valence of an atom
is the sum of its individual bond valences, it is reason-
able to assume that more is the bond valence, the
stronger is the bond and vice versa.
The relative bonding energies in Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 given
in table 6 bear that, Ce–O (long), Zr–O (long), Zr–O
(short) bonds are weaker than the pure Ce–O bond. We
have showed the % diﬀerence in the bonding energies
with respect to pure Ce–O bond because their absolute
values are typically overestimated in LDA calculations.
The binding energy of diﬀerent type of oxygens is
obtained by summing up of individual bond energies.
The relative binding energy of oxygens in Zr substituted
CeO2 is given in table 7. For pure CeO2, we have a
single type of oxygen, in which each oxygen forms four
bonds with Ce. For Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, the binding energy
of an oxygen with 3 Ce–O short bonds and 1 Zr–O long
bond is given by type 1 and have binding energy more
than that of an oxygen in pure CeO2. Type 2, in which
oxygen has 3 Ce–O long bonds and 1 Zr–O short bond
are weakly bound than an oxygen in pure CeO2. Our
analysis of bond-strengths is consistent with the result
that cohesive energy of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 is 15.53% smaller
than pure CeO2.
To probe further the OSC of mixed oxides, we ana-
lyzed eﬀects of oxygen vacancies introduced in the tet-
rahedral position. Ce0.75Zr0.25O1.75 is a structure with
12.5% oxygen vacancy. Our calculated cohesive energies
of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 and (Ce0.75Zr0.25O1.75+an oxygen)
suggest that it will cost an energy of 11.73 eV to create
an oxygen vacancy. Similarly, the diﬀerence in cohesive
energies of CeO2 and (CeO1.75+an oxygen) is 11.83 eV.
To assess the mechanism suggested in one of the earlier
investigations [11], we simulated a conﬁguration of
Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, with one of the oxide ions displaced from
the tetrahedral position to the octahedral vacant posi-
tion. On relaxing the structure, we ﬁnd that the oxygen
moves back to the tetrahedral position, resulting in the
original structure without vacancy and having the same
energy. Thus, it rules out the possibility for an oxygen
atom to occupy the octahedral site in the bulk form of
these oxides. Figure 4(b) and (c) show the conﬁgura-
tions with oxygen vacancies in the ceria-zirconia mixed
oxide. Our calculations with oxygen vacancy in ceria-
zirconia show that presence of oxygen vacancy makes
the structure weakly bound and increases the number of
weak oxygens, contributing to higher OSC.
Figure 5(b) shows the presence of both short and
long bonds in vacancy introduced ceria as in CeO1.75
compared to the single bond length of 2.36 A
˚
in pure
CeO2. Presence of longer bonds compared to CeO2,
shows the availability of weaker oxygens in CeO2-d.
Ce0.75Zr0.25O1.75 shows more prominant change of bond
lengths and presence of longer bonds compared to
Ce0.75Zr0.25O2. In ZrO1.75, longer bond lengths are

found compared to ZrO2. Hence presence of oxygen
vacancies is an important factor contributing to the
OSC of mixed oxides (see table 5 for bond lengths in
vacancy introduced mixed oxides). The values of the
oxygen valencies for Ce0.75Zr0.25O1.75 are given in
table 4. In each case, the number of strong and weak
oxygens are four and three, respectively. Hence it shows
that the position of the tetrahedral vacancy was the site
of an weakly bound oxygen.
4. Conclusion
EXAFS study of Ce1-xZrxO2 shows that oxygen
coordination around Zr is 4+4. The structures deter-
mined from our ﬁrst-principles calculations agree with
the EXAFS results. We ﬁnd that the presence of short
and long bonds result in two type of oxygens: strongly
and weakly bound. The stronger ones have valency
greater than 2.0 and the weaker ones have valency less
than 2.0. Using the valencies of cations and oxygens
calculated by bond valence method, we determined the
weakly bound oxygens responsible for higher OSC in
the mixed oxides. Presence of oxygen vacancies in ceria-
zirconia has been found to result in longer cation-oxy-
gen bonds, which might lead to weakening of strongly
bound oxygens, thereby further increasing the OSC.
