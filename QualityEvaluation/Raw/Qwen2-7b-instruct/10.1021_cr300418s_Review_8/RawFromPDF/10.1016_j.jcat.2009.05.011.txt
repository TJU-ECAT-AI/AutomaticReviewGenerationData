Using a combination of theory and experiments, we show that ZnO substitutionally doped with Ti or Al
oxidizes CO by several parallel reaction pathways that differ from the traditional Mars–van Krevelen
(MVK) mechanism. In one, the dopant atoms at the surface of the doped oxide adsorb and activate O2
so that it reacts with CO. In the other, a surface oxygen atom from the lattice next to the dopant, D, moves
onto the dopant and creates an O-D group and an oxygen vacancy. The O-D group is capable of oxidizing a
reductant. To test these predictions made by theory, we have prepared Ti- and Al-doped ZnO and have
shown that these compounds oxidize CO at temperatures at which pure-phase ZnO, Al2O3, or TiO2 do
not. The proposed mechanisms were made plausible by studying CO oxidation with 18O2.

1. Introduction
Oxide catalysts are widely used in industry [1–3] and much
work is directed toward improving their performance and reduc-
ing the energy required for their use. One possible method for
achieving these goals is to substitutionally exchange a small frac-
tion of the cations at the host oxide surface [4–46]. We call the
resulting compound a ‘doped oxide’ and the guest cation a ‘dop-
ant’. Given the large number of possible dopant-oxide pairs, it is
hoped that some useful catalysts may be found in this class of
compounds. Experimental progress in creating doped oxide cata-
lysts has been slow, since there has been no systematic method
for selecting dopant-host combinations and there are no sure-ﬁre
synthetic methods for placing substitutional dopants at the sur-
face of the oxide. Moreover, if the doping level is low (e.g. 1%
of cations are substituted), it is difﬁcult to rule out that the sam-
ple consists of a mixture of two oxides; or that it consists of ex-
tremely small (molecule sized) clusters of the dopant oxide on
the surface of the host support; or that all dopant atoms are in
the bulk of the sample. Quantum mechanical calculations have
the advantage that they can unambiguously ‘‘prepare” and study
substitutionally doped oxides. On the other hand, the calculations
are performed on oxide slabs that may not be representative of
the high-surface-area catalysts used in practice, and the real cat-
alyst may have hydroxyls or even traces of carbonate on its sur-
faces caused by the presence of CO2. In addition, it is suspected
that density-functional theory has difﬁculties in describing accu-
rately some of the oxides of interest to catalysis [47,48]. For these
reasons, we use theory to qualitatively explore various possibili-
ties and to predict the best candidates, then use experiments to
test whether the suggestions made by theory can be translated
into real-world catalysts.
Most heterogeneous oxidation reactions catalyzed by oxides
take place via the Mars and van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, in
which the reductant (CO in our case) reacts with the oxygen atoms
from the surface of the oxide [2,3,49]. The oxidized molecules des-
orb and take oxygen with them, leaving behind oxygen vacancies
on the surface. These vacancies are ﬁlled by molecular oxygen from
the gas phase, a step that completes the catalytic cycle. In previous
computational studies, we have explored how doping the surface
of TiO2, CeO2, and ZnO changes their oxidative power [50–52]. In
the case of TiO2 and CeO2 all the dopants that we studied decrease
the energy needed for forming oxygen vacancies and, therefore,
make the oxide a better MVK oxidant. The increased oxidation
activity was illustrated by a study of the catalytic cycle for CO oxi-
dation [51,52].

In the case of ZnO, many dopants increase the energy that is nec-
essary for removing an oxygen atom from the surface [50]; doping
the oxide with them will hinder the oxidation through the MVK
pathway. One would think that such doped oxides are less effective
oxidation catalysts than the undoped host. In the present work, we
consider two other possibilities that have been overlooked so far.
The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly
to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This
would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas
phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination. If the dopant’s
valence is satisﬁed by binding one oxygen atom of gas-phase O2,
then the other O atom would be available for oxidizing a molecule.
The net result is that the dopant adsorbs and activates O2 from the
gas phase, promoting oxidation reactions. Another possibility is
that the undercoordinated dopant will ‘‘steal” an oxygen atom
from the surface of the host oxide. This atom will settle on top of
the dopant, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy in the surface layer.
The oxygen on top of the dopant may be an active center for
oxidation.
In this article, we present results of calculations and experi-
ments that explore these two possibilities. To prove that CO is oxi-
dized by O2 adsorbed from the gas phase, we have performed the
oxidation reaction with gas-phase 18O2. We found that the catalyst
produces 18OC16O, which proves that the oxygen atom that oxi-
dizes CO originates from the gas-phase oxygen molecule. However,
the reaction also produces comparable amounts of C16O2, and
small amounts of C18O2. The formation of three CO2 isotopes indi-
cates that several distinct reaction mechanisms are at work in this
system.
We have used sol–gel synthesis to attempt the preparation of
high-surface-area ZnO atomically doped with Al or Ti. We have
chosen to work with Ti, Al and Zn because TiO2, Al2O3, or ZnO does
not oxidize CO at temperatures below 450 C, where we perform
our experiments. Therefore, if the compound we prepare is active
for CO oxidation at low temperatures, it cannot consist of separate
bulk oxide phases. Since we use very small amounts of dopant pre-
cursor, it is likely that during synthesis the dopant atoms will not
ﬁnd each other to segregate and make a multiphase system con-
sisting of ZnO and TiO2 or Al2O3. Unfortunately, this argument does
not rule out the possibility that we have prepared molecule-sized
clusters of AlOx or TiOx supported on the surface of ZnO. In many
cases, such supported molecule-sized oxide clusters are more ac-
tive than the corresponding oxide [53,54] and may be responsible
for the oxidation of CO.
2. Theoretical methodology
Since this is a combined theoretical and experimental study, we
employ the following ‘‘division of labor”. We use theory to identify
energetically favored reaction pathways. We calculate the activa-
tion energy only for the most important steps: the reaction of CO
with the adsorbed O2 molecule and the formation of an oxygen va-
cancy by transfer of an oxygen atom from the surface onto the dop-
ant. Since the calculations of activation energies are very time
consuming and the values obtained are not very reliable, we pre-
ferred using experiments to test whether the doped oxides will
convert CO to CO2.
We use the density-functional theory implemented in the VASP
code [55,56]. The electron-ion interaction is treated with the pro-
jector augmented wave method in which all the electrons except
the valence ones are kept frozen [57]. The exchange-correlation en-
ergy is calculated with the PW-91 GGA functional [58]. The com-
puted bulk lattice constants of ZnO were found to be a = 3.282 Å,
c/a = 1.6176 and u = 0.378. The calculated heat of formation of
ZnO is 3.41 eV, which is close to that observed in experiments
[59,60] and in other computations [61–63]. A (2  3)-ZnOð10 
10Þ
surface super-cell with ﬁve layers was used in all calculations.
Tests performed with a (3  4) super-cell show that an increase
in slab thickness and super-cell size changes the adsorption ener-
gies by less than 0.05 eV. A plane-wave cut-off of 400 eV and a
2  2  1 k-points grid was used for all calculations. For a few sys-
tems, we increased the k-points grid to 4  4  1 and this changed
the relative adsorption energies by less than 0.05 eV. The total en-
ergy is converged to within 103 eV/super-cell. We have allowed
fractional occupancy of bands by using Gaussian smearing with
an energy window of 0.05 eV. All calculations reported here take
into account spin polarization.
Because DFT does not allow for rigorous description of spin of
the many-body electronic wave function we enforce the conserva-
tion of spin polarization along the reaction path, as discussed in
Refs. [64,65]. We do this because the internal magnetic ﬁelds felt
by the electrons during the reaction are very weak, and the proba-
bility that the spin of an electron is changed during the reaction is
very low. In this article we examine only the states allowed by spin
conservation and if several spin states are allowed we report the
evolution of the one having the lowest energy.
Density-functional theory seems to have some difﬁculties when
applied to narrow band oxides [47,48]. It is not clear whether these
difﬁculties result in errors in total energy differences, which are of
interest to chemists; nor is it clear for which oxides or for which
chemical processes the calculations are unreliable (it is conceivable
that processes that do not involve changes in the population or the
energy of the narrow bands are not affected). Because of this we fo-
cus on qualitative results and trends and, whenever possible, use
experiments to settle more quantitative questions.
3. Oxygen activation by the dopant
In previous calculations [50], we have found that doping ZnO
with Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, or W increases substantially the energy re-
quired for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide; Al,
Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os and Ce have a similar, but less pronounced, effect.
This indicates that these dopants are not satisﬁed with the number
of oxygen atoms surrounding them and compensate by binding the
neighboring oxygen more strongly. This is more pronounced for do-
pants whose preferred valence is higher than 2. It is likely that these
‘‘dissatisﬁed” dopants will tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase. If
their valence is satisﬁed by binding to one additional O atom then
the system will be inclined, after adsorbing an O2 molecule, to pro-
vide the other oxygen atom for an oxidation reaction. Thus, ZnO
doped with one of the dopants listed above is likely to adsorb O2
and enhance its ability to engage in oxidation reactions. This mech-
anism is different from the usual Mars–van Krevelen (MVK) mech-
anism [49], which is invoked for explaining the majority of
oxidation reactions catalyzed by oxides [66]. In MVK reactions,
the reductant takes oxygen atoms out of the oxide surface, not from
the gas phase. The role of O2 in the gas phase is to prevent the com-
plete reduction of the oxide by reﬁlling the vacancies.
This qualitative argument prompted us to examine this idea in
detail by studying the oxidation of CO by ZnO doped with Ti or Al.
Our calculations found that O2 adsorbs readily on the dopant and
after that it reacts with CO. The subsequent evolution of the system
is complicated: we found three possibilities, which are discussed
below and illustrated by Figs. 1–3. All three mechanisms start with
O2 adsorption on the dopant (see structure Fig. 1b). This is highly
exothermic for both Ti and Al. The O–O distance in the adsorbed
oxygen molecule is 1.53 Å, which is larger than the value of
1.24 Å found by DFT for the gas-phase molecule. This increase
in the bond length is a sign that the anti-bonding orbitals of O2
are involved in the formation of the bond with the dopant. The

51
Bader charge [67,68] on each adsorbed oxygen atom is 0.46,
which supports the suggestion that the antibonding orbital in O2
is populated when the molecule is adsorbed. The next step in all
three mechanisms is the reaction of CO with the adsorbed oxygen
to form a ‘‘carbonate” (see structure Fig. 1c), which takes place
without an energy barrier. After these steps several mechanisms
are possible.
3.1. Mechanism 1
The carbonate (Fig. 1c) decomposes to produce CO2 in the gas
phase, and leaves behind an oxygen atom bound to the dopant
(Fig. 1d). This reacts with a second CO to form an ‘‘adsorbed CO2 spe-
cies” (Fig. 1e). The latter desorbs to produce CO2 in the gas phase.
This completes the catalytic cycle. The energy-level diagram in
Fig. 1 shows that for the Al-doped catalyst (blue curve)2 most steps
in this mechanism are strongly exothermic, while two are
mildly endothermic by 0.2 eV and 0.4 eV. For the Ti-doped oxide,
the decomposition of the carbonate is uphill by 0.7 eV, and the
reaction of CO with the adsorbed oxygen atom is uphill by
0.5 eV. These values are still small enough to make this mechanism
plausible.
3.2. Mechanism 2
The second mechanism is illustrated by Fig. 2. The ﬁrst two
steps are the same as in Mechanism 1: O2 adsorbs at the dopant
site, reacts with CO to form a carbonate, which decomposes to
produce CO2 in the gas phase leaving an oxygen atom adsorbed
on the dopant (we denote this by D-O). The distinction from
Mechanism 1 starts in the next step: the Ti–O group adsorbs an-
other oxygen molecule to form a ‘‘TiO3” complex (see Fig. 2b).
This reaction is exothermic for the Al-doped oxide and is endo-
thermic by 0.4 eV for the Ti-doped one. The TiO3 complex reacts
with CO to form CO2 in gas phase and O2 adsorbed on the dopant,

which closes the catalytic cycle. This reaction is strongly exother-
mic for both the dopants. All other things being equal, one would
expect that mechanism 1 is favored when the CO pressure is
higher than the O2 pressure, since in this case the reaction of
CO with Ti–O is more likely than the reaction of Ti–O with
oxygen.
3.3. Mechanism 3
A third possible pathway is illustrated in Fig. 3, which also starts
with oxygen adsorption followed by reaction with CO to form a
carbonate. The carbonate can then react with another CO to form
an oxalate whose structure is shown in Fig. 3b. The oxalate decom-
poses to form CO2 and leaves an oxygen molecule on the dopant.
Both reactions are exothermic.
We have calculated the binding energies of the compounds in-
volved in these mechanisms to make sure that none contains reac-
tions that are strongly ‘‘uphill”. The activation energy was
calculated only for one critical step: the reaction of the adsorbed
O2 with CO.
4. Experimental methodology
4.1. Catalyst synthesis
The MxZn1xOd (M = Al, Ti) powder catalysts were synthesized
from sol–gel precursors. Solutions were prepared by mixing 1%
(metals basis) of the dopant butoxide (aluminum butoxide or tita-
nium (IV) butoxide (Sigma–Aldrich)) with Zn(NO3)26H2O (Fisher)
in isopropanol (EMD). The solution was stirred for approximately
30 min, until the precursors were dissolved, and then capped and
stirred for an additional 30 min to insure adequate mixing. The
solution was then uncapped and placed into a water bath at
70 C to evaporate the solvent and simultaneously hydrolyze the
precursors using water from moisture in the ambient air and in
the precursor solutions. The solution gels and appears white after
approximately two hours. The gel was pre-dried in a water bath
at 100 C for 2 h, then calcined in air at 1000 C for 6 h. The ZnO
control material was prepared identically except no dopant metal
butoxide was added.
4.2. Catalyst characterization
The morphology of the powder sample was characterized by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI XL40 Sirion FEG Digital
Scanning
Microscope)
and
transmission
electron
microscopy
(TEM, FEI Titan FEG High Resolution TEM/STEM operated at
300 kV). The detailed elemental distribution was obtained from en-
ergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) using the instrument at-
tached to the TEM, (FEI Titan 300 kV FEG TEM/STEM System w/EDS
& EELS). The surface area was determined by BET analysis (Tristar
3000 Gas Absorption Analyzer, Micromeritics). The powder X-Ray
Diffraction (XRD) spectra were measured with a Scintag X2 diffrac-
tometer, with a 2 kW Cu anode and a solid-state point detector.
The XRD data were processed using the Windows version of the
Scintag data collection and analysis package. The Rietveld reﬁne-
ment of the XRD data was simulated using a General Structure
Analysis System (GSAS) to obtain the fractional dopant concentra-
tions from the changes in the lattice spacing.

4.3. Catalyst testing
The activity of the metal oxide catalyst was measured in a
packed bed reactor (PBR) using argon as a carrier gas and calibra-
tion standard. The PBR was a 6 mm diameter glass tube, 300 mm in
length, which was ﬁtted inside an aluminum heating block. In a
typical run approximately 250 mg of catalyst was used in an active
reaction volume of 0.25 ml. The void fraction was approximately
82%. The volumetric ﬂow rates of argon, carbon monoxide and oxy-
gen were controlled by mass ﬂow controllers (MKS). Typical exper-
imental ﬂow rates were 3.7 ml/min for argon, 9.7 ml/min for
oxygen and 9.7 ml/min for carbon monoxide, with an approximate
space time of 0.3 s. The product gas was sampled directly at the
reactor outlet into a differentially pumped mass spectrometer
(SRS) through a controlled leak valve.
For temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) studies, the tem-
perature was ramped at a rate of 7.5 K/min using a programable
controller (Omega, CSC32). For Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
(Thermo Electron Corporation, Nicolet 4700) studies, the catalysts
were exposed to the same ﬂow rate of gases at temperatures up to
400 C with automated temperature control (Harrick). Partial pres-
sure-programmed reaction experiments were conducted at a con-
stant temperature of (450 C) and a constant total ﬂow rate of
23 ml/min. The ﬂow rates of carbon monoxide, oxygen and argon
were varied to change the CO/O2 ratio while maintaining a con-
stant total ﬂow rate.
The reaction with isotopically labeled oxygen, 18O2 (ISOTEC),
was performed by pre-treating the catalyst to remove all absorbed
16O2: the catalyst was heated to 375 C in an Ar ﬂow rate of 3.7 ml/
min for 1 h, followed by 1 h of exposure to CO at a ﬂow rate of
9.7 ml/min at 375 C, and then another hour in Ar at 375 C. While
ﬂowing CO and Ar at ﬂow rates of 9.7 ml/min and 3.7 ml/min
respectively, the 18O2 was introduced in pulses (3–5 s) using a
two-position microelectric valve (VICI).
5. Experimental results
5.1. Physical characterization of doped ZnO
SEM images show that after calcination at 1000 C, ZnO forms
micron-sized crystallites (Fig. 4a). Al- and Ti doping leads to the
creation of more edge and corner sites (Fig. 4b and c). The Ti-doped
ZnO showed an insigniﬁcant BET surface area increase, after calci-
nation, from 0.24 m2/g to 0.25 m2/g; however, the surface area of
the Al-doped ZnO increased to 0.39 m2/g.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
with line-scan EDS was also used on approximately 10 different
areas for each sample. Bright ﬁeld, high angle annular dark ﬁeld
(HAADF) scanning TEM (STEM) images with sub-nanometer reso-
lution combined with selected area line-scan EDS showed the Al-
doped ZnO to be uniform. For the Ti-doped ZnO, a small amount
of Ti enrichment was observed by line-scan EDS at the surface of
the ZnO crystallites. These two EDS experiments suggest that
ZnO is doped uniformly without creation of regions of high dopant
concentration.
Qualitatively, all XRD spectra indicate a singular phase match-
ing: those of pure ZnO. Rietveld reﬁnement of the XRD data for
Al-doped ZnO, Fig. 5, shows that the lattice contracts from
3.2507 Å to 3.2499 Å along the a- and b-axis, and expands from
5.2051 Å to 5.2066 Å along the c-axis vs. pure ZnO. The reﬁnement
indicates that Al was doped into the ZnO lattice at an atomic frac-
tion of 0.99%. This is in agreement with the 1% mole ratio of Al in

Zn used in the synthesis. No signiﬁcant lattice change was observed
by Rietveld reﬁnement of the Ti-doped ZnO, which is likely due to a
similar size of the Ti and Zn cations. The XRD and Rietveld studies
suggest that the materials are of a uniform phase and do not consist
of a phase of the dopant’s oxide and one of the host oxide.

400 C) for the Ti- and Al-doped ZnO was signiﬁcantly greater than
that for the undoped ZnO control sample, which has extremely low
activity in this temperature range. The Ti-doped samples were
more active than those doped with Al, which could be due to a
greater density of active sites on the Ti-enriched surface as ob-
served in HRTEM EDS measurements. With in situ FTIR, under
the same reaction conditions at 400 C, absorption peaks were ob-
served at 1560 cm1 and 1370 cm1, which are attributed to –
OCO– and C@O stretches in the Ti–O2CO complex [69]. The obser-
vation of these bidentate peaks is consistent with the mechanism
proposed in Fig. 1. No bidentate peaks were observed for the Al-
doped sample under identical conditions.
Fig. 6b shows the change in the activity, at 450 C, when the
partial pressure of CO is varied and that of O2 is held constant.
Fig. 6c shows the change in the activity, when the partial pressure
of O2 is varied and that of CO is held constant. In both the cases, a
hysteresis is observed for Ti-doped ZnO and a reversible behavior is
observed for Al-doped ZnO.
5.3. CO oxidation by 18O2
The main point of this paper is that the mechanism of CO oxida-
tion on Ti- or Al-doped ZnO differs from that of Mars–van Kreve-
len; the oxidation is due to the adsorbed oxygen molecule, not
by the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide. To test this
hypothesis, we have performed the reaction with gaseous 18O2. If
the oxidation is caused by the adsorbed oxygen, the reaction will
produce C18O16O; if the mechanism is Mars–van Krevelen, the
product will be C16O2. Fig. 7a shows the partial pressure of CO,
Ar and O2 in the mass spectrometer, at the exit from the reactor,
for Ti-doped ZnO. We introduce CO and Ar continuously, without
oxygen, and then use a 5 s oxygen pulse, followed by a 3 min oxy-
gen pulse. The reaction is run at 350 C. The total pressure in the
mass spectrometer is held constant and pulsing O2 lowers the par-
tial pressure of CO and Ar. In addition, the partial pressure of CO is
diminished by its oxidation. Fig. 7b shows the partial pressure of
the isotopes of CO2 produced under the conditions used in
Fig. 7a. We have measured the amount of C16O2 impurity in CO
and have removed this contribution from the C16O2 produced by
the reaction. If all CO were oxidized exclusively by the gas-phase
18O2, we would have observed only C16O18O. The presence of
C16O2 and C18O2 indicates that additional mechanisms are at work.
Fig. 7c shows the 5 s oxygen pulse used to oxidize CO on undoped
ZnO. Since the undoped oxide is considerably less active than the
doped oxide, we use a temperature of 450 C for this experiment.
The partial pressure of various CO2 isotopes, at the exit of the reac-
tor, is shown in Fig. 7d. Note that the partial pressure scale is an
order of magnitude smaller than that in Fig. 7b. The ratio of
C16O2 to C18O16O is much higher for the undoped oxide than for
the doped one. We assume that the C18O16O is produced after some
16O atoms in the surface are exchanged with 18O. The fact that the
ratio of mass 44 to mass 46 changes from 8:1 (on pure ZnO) to 3:2
(in 1% Ti-doped ZnO) is evidence that the non-Mars–van Krevelen
mechanism is dominant in the Ti-doped material. In all these

Fig. 7. (a) The partial pressure of CO, O2, and Ar in the mass spectrometer at the exit of the reactor when O2 pulses are introduced. The reaction, which is catalyzed by Ti-
doped ZnO, takes place at 350 C. The total pressure is constant and the introduction of the oxygen pulse lowers the partial pressure of Ar and CO. In addition, CO is consumed
and the CO/Ar ratio is smaller than that obtained prior to the introduction of oxygen. The duration of the ﬁrst pulse is 5 min, that of the second pulse is three minutes. (b) The

is lower than that obtained in (c). (For interpretation of the references in color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

experiments, care was taken to remove any 18O2 adsorbed in the
previous experiment.
The presence of C18O2 and C16O2, along with the expected
C18O16O, surprised us. None of the three mechanisms proposed in
Section 3 would produce them. We need to invoke additional
mechanisms and we do this in the next section.
6. Additional mechanisms
The formation of C16O2 has to involve 16O atoms from the sur-
face of the oxide, which suggests a Mars–van Krevelen or a MVK-
like mechanism. In our previous work, we had shown that in the
case of Au-doped ceria [52] or Au-doped rutile titania [51], the
presence of the dopant weakens the bond of a surface oxygen atom
to the oxide, and that oxygen atom reacts with CO to make a CO2
molecule. Our calculations show that this mechanism does not
operate for the doped oxides studied here. This is not surprising
since it was found [50] that doping with Al or Ti makes the oxygen
atoms at the surface of ZnO bind more strongly to the oxide than in
the case of the undoped surface. We found, however, that an oxy-
gen atom from the surface layer can move on top of the dopant to
create a 16O–Ti group and an oxygen vacancy on the surface layer
near the dopant. The activation energy for this process is 0.2 eV.
The reaction path is shown in Fig. 8. We think that this is not pe-
culiar to the TixZn1xO system. Calculations have shown [65] that
if VxTi1xO2, WxTi1xO2, MoxTi1xO2, or CrxTi1xO2, with the dopant
in the surface layer, are in contact with gaseous O2, the compounds
(VO)xTi1xO2, (WO)xTi1xO2, (MoO)xTi1xO2, or (CrO)xTi1xO2 in
which an oxygen atom is bound on top of the dopant are more sta-
ble than the doped oxide and 1/2O2 in the gas phase. This is not a
general feature, though MnxTiO2 with 1/2O2 in the gas phase is
more stable than (MnO)xTi1xO2.
The fact that an oxygen atom from the ZnO surface can climb
on top of the Ti dopant (and create an oxygen vacancy in the sur-
face) gives rise to Mechanism 4: the 16O–Ti group reacts with
C16O to form C16O2. This explains the presence of this species
among our products. Each desorbed CO2 creates an oxygen va-
cancy on the surface. To have a catalytic reaction, the surface
must be re-oxidized. It is very likely that 18O2 adsorbs at the va-
cancy site and will then react with CO to produce C16O18O, which
desorbs and annihilates the vacancy. Another possibility is that
18O2 adsorbs at the vacancy site and dissociates, ﬁlling the va-
cancy and producing an 18O which later reacts with C16O or ﬁnds
another vacancy. O2 dissociation at vacancy sites has been ob-
served in STM experiments [64,70–72] with reduced TiO2(110)
and in DFT calculations, in which spin conservation has been im-
posed [64]. We have not performed calculations to explore these
possibilities for TixZn1xO. However, it is clear that no matter
which of these alternatives take place, the result is that the sur-
face will slowly accumulate 18O at sites near the dopant atoms.
Our experiments used a pulse of 18O2 and, therefore, did not de-
plete the surface oxide signiﬁcantly of 16O.
We note that the adsorption of O2 on the dopant, required by
Mechanisms 1–3, has no barrier and is strongly exothermic. The
adsorption of O2 on Ti competes with the formation of Ti–O, re-
quired by Mechanism 4, which has a barrier of 0.2 eV. Therefore,
Mechanism 4 is expected to be less efﬁcient than Mechanisms 1–
3, especially at high partial pressures of O2.
A plausible explanation is presented for the observed C16O2
even though the reaction does not go through a traditional
Mars–van Krevelen mechanism (i.e., CO does not react directly
with an oxygen atom from the surface layer, but reacts with an
oxygen atom on top of the dopant).
We do not have a ﬁrm explanation for the appearance of C18O2.
It is possible that when the carbonate or the oxalate is formed the
oxygen atoms may rearrange and C18O2 is formed from the carbon-
ate C16O18O2 or from the oxalate.
7. Summary
We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that
are different from the traditional MVK mechanism. We have shown
that cationic substitutional doping of ZnO with Ti or Al promotes
adsorption of O2 on the dopant. Essentially, this happens because
Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn. When these dopants re-
place a Zn atom, at the surface of ZnO, they do not ﬁnd enough lat-
tice oxygen atoms to satisfy their valence. This drives them to
adsorb gas-phase O2. Because these particular dopants would pre-
fer to have one additional oxygen atom, rather than two, the ad-
sorbed O2 molecule reacts readily with a reductant. For CO, the
oxidation can take place by three mechanisms that will produce
C18O16O if the gas-phase oxygen is 18O2 and by a fourth mechanism
that will produce C16O2. We have not performed the calculations
necessary for sorting out which mechanism prevails under a given
set of conditions. It is quite possible that all these take place simul-
taneously, with different reactions occurring at different dopant
sites.
We believe that the fact that the dopant has a higher valence
than Zn explains qualitatively the behavior of the doped oxide.
There is, however, a second relevant factor: the Zn atoms do not
adjust its valence to respond to the presence of a dopant; in the
Zn–O–Ti groups present on the surface, Zn will stay divalent.
CuO doped with Ti or Al would behave differently than ZnO in this
respect, because in the group Cu–O–Ti, Cu may become monova-
lent to give the dopant a chance to bind more strongly to the
shared oxygen atom. Therefore, we speculate that the mechanism
presented here works better if the cations of the host oxide have
only one stable oxidation state.
We have also found that an oxygen atom from the surface may
migrate onto the dopant atom, and then react with CO. This mech-
anism explains the presence of C16O2 products when the gas-phase
oxygen is 18O2.
We speculate that numerous other oxides doped with cations
having a higher valence than the host will behave like the present
system in oxidation reactions, especially if the cation in the host is
not able to reduce its valence when the dopant is present.
