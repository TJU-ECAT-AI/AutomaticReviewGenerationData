We have used density functional theory calculations within the LDA+U formulation to investigate how
small amounts of dissolved SiO2, GeO2, SnO2, or PbO2 affect the redox thermodynamics of ceria CeO2.
Compared to pure ceria, reduction is facilitated and the reducibility increases in the sequence of CeO2-SnO2,
CeO2-GeO2, and CeO2-SiO2, which correlates with the decrease of the ionic radii of the solutes. For low solute
concentrations, there is an inverse relation between high reducibility and the solution energy of tetravalent
solutes. CeO2-PbO2 is unique in the sense that the initial reduction occurs by PbIV⇒PbII instead of the
usual CeIV⇒CeIII reaction. Among the investigated ceria compounds, CeO2-PbO2 has the lowest reduc-
tion energy and rather low solution energy. We have studied how the solution and reduction energies depend on
the concentration of Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Ti, Zr, Hf, and Th solute ions. While the solution energy increases
monotonously with concentration, the reduction energy ﬁrst decreases, as compared to pure ceria except for
Th, which exhibits a small increase, and with further increase of solute concentration, it either remains almost
constant Zr, Hf, and Th or slightly increases Ti, Si, Ge, and Sn.

I. INTRODUCTION
Ceria based materials are found in a wide range of appli-
cations,
for
example,
ceria-zirconia
mixed
oxides
Ce1−yZryO2 are used for oxygen storage release in three-
way catalysts for automotive exhaust treatment.1,2 CeO2
doped with divalent or trivalent ions is a promising electro-
lyte material for application in solid oxide fuel cells.3–5 In
three-way catalysts, ceria is used to control the oxygen at-
mosphere by making use of the ability of ceria to release
oxygen by forming oxygen vacancies under reducing condi-
tions and, conversely, to store oxygen by ﬁlling oxygen va-
cancies under oxidizing conditions. The excellent oxygen
storage capacity OSC is an inherent property of ceria in the
cubic ﬂuorite structure.6 The addition of ZrO2 further im-
proves the OSC as well as the thermal stability.2,7–10 Using
density functional theory DFT calculations, we have previ-
ously investigated how small amounts of tetravalent ions
from group 4b in the Periodic Table, i.e., Zr4+, Hf4+, Ti4+,
and Th4+, inﬂuence the redox thermodynamics and kinetics
of ceria.11 We concluded that reduction is facilitated by dis-
solving TiO2 largest improvement, HfO2, or ZrO2 least
improvement, while ThO2 makes the reduction slightly
more difﬁcult. The migration barrier for the diffusion of oxy-
gen ions is much lower in the neighborhood of a Ti ion
largest decrease, Hf ion, or Zr ion least decrease, which
increases the rate of oxygen diffusion. The binding energy of
vacancies and solutes, which decreases from Ti, Hf, Zr, to
Th, inﬂuences diffusion in the opposite direction by increas-
ing the activation energy for diffusion. In Ref. 11, we ratio-
nalized the properties of ceria solid solutions in terms of
defect cluster relaxations that are coupled to a gain in the
band energy. Small ions such as Ti4+ enable a favorable re-
laxation pattern that allows large Ce3+ ions to ﬁt into the
ceria matrix, while large ions such as Th4+ instead worsen
these properties. The beneﬁts of dissolving ZrO2 into CeO2
are well established,2,7–10 but HfO2 Ref. 12 and TiO2 Refs.
13 and 14 have also been identiﬁed as promising alterna-
tives. Recent experiments15,16 have reported a considerable
decrease of the reduction energy for Ce1−yZryO2 y=0.19
compared to CeO2, which is in agreement with our theoret-
ical predictions in Ref. 11. Nevertheless, experiments sug-
gest a slightly larger decrease than theory.15,16 In conjunction
with Ti, Zr, Hf, and Th, the group 4a elements, i.e., Si, Ge,
Sn, and Pb, form tetravalent oxygen compounds and pro-
spectively they can be used as solutes or dopants to optimize
the properties of ceria. Moreover, Si is one of the main con-
taminants in commercial CeO2 grades and thus it is impor-
tant to understand its effect on redox thermodynamics and
structural properties. Solid solutions of ceria and tetravalent
ions from group 4a have only been scarcely discussed in the
literature. One reason for this is the difﬁculty of forming the
solid solutions in a controlled way. A few studies have been
undertaken on composite and mixed CeO2-SiO2 Refs.
17–20 materials, which under certain conditions were re-
ported to possess favorable redox properties compared to
pure CeO2 and CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides. Due to the high
complexity of these materials, interpretation of experiments
is often nontrivial but could be made easier if the redox
properties
of
the
constituent
phases
were
established.
CeO2-SnO2 materials were studied by Lin et al.21,22 and they
found excellent redox properties and high catalytic activity.
The development of new OSC materials will beneﬁt from
better knowledge of the redox properties and the stability
ranges of CeO2-MO2 M=Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb
solution phases.
In the present paper, we address the above issues using
theoretical methods based on the density functional theory.
The details are described in Sec. II. We study small amounts
of group 4a elements in ceria Sec. III A–III C, as well as

and Th solution phases in the solute range of 0y0.25
Sec. III D.
II. THEORY
The DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna ab
initio simulation package VASP in the framework of the
projector augmented wave method.23–27 In order to account
for the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion among the Ce 4f
electrons, we have applied the LDA+U scheme formulated
by Dudarev et al.28 The exchange-correlation effects were
treated within the local density approximation LDA to-
gether with a Hubbard U parameter of 6 eV since that is a
good choice to describe the structural, electronic band struc-
ture,
and
energetic
properties
of
CeO2,
Ce2O3,
and
CeO2−x.29 We modeled defect properties using a 222
supercell 96 sites, derived from the ideal ﬂuorite structure.
For small solute concentrations, the volume of the supercell
was set equal to the calculated volume of pure ceria.29 This
results in an underestimation of the vacancy formation en-
ergy see below by 0.04–0.05 eV 1.4%–1.6%, which is
negligible on the scale of vacancy formation energy values.
This range was estimated through the volume relaxation of
CeO1.9688, Ce1.9688Ti0.0312O1.9688, and Ce1.9688Si0.0312O1.9688,
as well as of the corresponding oxidized compounds, i.e.,
Ce1.9688Ti0.0312O2 and Ce1.9688Si0.0312O2. It is more important
to include volume relaxation for high solute concentrations
and, in our case, it was included for y=0.25. All internal
structural parameters were relaxed until the Hellman-
Feynman forces on each ion were negligible 0.02 eV/Å.
We used a plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 eV and applied a
222 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh30 four irreducible k
points with Gaussian smearing of 0.20 eV.29 For accurate
calculation of the electronic density of states DOS, we ap-
plied a 333 k-point mesh30 eight irreducible k points
and the modiﬁed tetrahedron method of Blöchl.31 All the
band structure properties were derived from the accurate
DOS calculations, but to improve visibility of atomiclike
peaks, a smearing was also applied to all the DOS plots.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Vacancy formation in Ce0.9688M0.0312O2
Ceria releases oxygen according to the reaction
CeO2 ⇔CeO2−x + x
2O2.
1
The equilibrium is controlled by the oxygen chemical poten-
tial and for a given x, it is determined by
Hf
v −TSf
v + RT
2 lnPO2 = 0.
2
Here, PO2 is the partial pressure of O2, T is the temperature,
and R is the molar gas constant. The vacancy formation en-
thalpy Hf
v and entropy Sf
v are deﬁned as
Xf
v = 1
xXCeO2−x + 1
2XO2 −1
xXCeO2,
3
where X denotes either enthalpy H or entropy S. We as-
sume that Hf
v is equal to the vacancy formation energy, Ef
v.
Low Ef
v means high reducibility, which translates into a high
OSC. Theoretical values of Ef
v derived from DFT calcula-
tions are underestimated compared to experiments.29,32 By
creating one vacancy in the 222 supercell x=0.0312,
we estimate Ef
v to be 3.61 eV,29 to be compared with mea-
sured values of 4.65–5.00 eV for bulk reduction.33 The the-
oretical underestimation is largely due to the overestimation
of the O2 binding energy within DFT29,31 1.2 eV/0.5 O2
in the LDA and consequently the underestimation is inde-
pendent of the conditions in the ceria material itself and can
easily be corrected.
When a vacancy is formed in pure ceria, two electrons
localize on two f-level traps on two nearest neighbor NN
Ce ions, thus transforming into Ce3+. This process is inﬂu-
enced by the presence of +4 solute ions. In Ref. 11, we
identiﬁed an almost linear dependence of Ef
v on the ionic
radius of the +4 solutes from group 4b, which is illustrated in
Fig. 1a where these data have been reproduced. In this
paper, the ionic radius34 either refers to eightfold Ti4+, Zr4+,
Hf4+, Th4+, Sn4+, and Pb4+ or fourfold Si4+ and Ge4+ co-
ordination of the tetravalent ions. Si4+ and Ge4+ strongly pre-
fer fourfold rather than eightfold coordination and conse-
quently there is no data for the ionic radius of the eightfold
coordination. One may assume that the +4 ions from group
4a should follow a similar pattern; however, Fig. 1a, at
least partly, does not support this reasoning. The differences
between the group 4a and 4b ions must originate from the
electronic structure of the solid solutions.
According to Fig. 1a, the vacancy formation energy in
Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2 is higher than the extrapolation from the
group 4b elements; however, the absolute value is still some-
what lower than for Ce0.9688Ti0.0312O2, which has the smallest
vacancy formation energy of the group 4b ceria compounds.
The
explanation
for
the
facile
vacancy
formation
in
Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2 is that the small size of the Si4+ ions en-
ables the large Ce3+ ions in reduced ceria to better ﬁt into the
ceria matrix. This is directly visible in the Ce3+-O2−nearest
neighbor coordination, which mimics the calculated coordi-
nation
in
the
hexagonal
A-type
form
of
the
Ce2O3
sesquioxide,11,29 in which all the Ce ions are trivalent. The
geometry relaxation is coupled to a gain in the band energy
the sum of the energies of all the individual electrons; in
DFT, the sum of the one-electron energies, via a decrease of
the separation between the occupied Ce 4f states in the band
gap and the O 2p valence band edge hereafter referred to as
the band separation, see Fig. 3, as compared to pure ceria.11
Among the group 4b ceria compounds, the largest decrease
of the band separation was found for Ce0.9688Ti0.0312O1.9688
0.27 eV,11 which also exhibits the smallest Ef
v. In agree-
ment with this observation, the decrease of the band separa-
tion is even larger for Ce0.9688Si0.0312O1.9688 0.30 eV. One
way of quantifying the effect of local relaxation of the
Ce3+-M4+-Va clusters is to calculate the structural relaxation
energy, i.e., the effect of local strain minimization, in the

vacancy-containing material. Figure 1b shows that the un-
relaxed vacancy formation energy Ef
v unrelaxed is mark-
edly lower for Si4+ containing ceria compounds than for any
of the group 4b ceria compounds. This is a consequence of
the small size of the Si4+ ions and their strong preference to
surround themselves with four oxygen ions in a tetrahedral
arrangement fourfold coordination. In the regular ﬂuorite
structure no vacancies, the cations are surrounded by eight
oxygen ions in a cubic arrangement. The Si4+-O2−coordina-
tion in Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2 is illustrated in Fig. 2. In order to
form the stable tetrahedron arrangement, the O2−ions must
leave their original ﬂuorite lattice positions and occupy
interstitial-like sites inside the matrix. Hereafter, these ions
are denoted OT. The oxygen ions that are not a part of the
tetrahedron move away from the Si4+ ion. The Si-O distances
in the tetrahedron are 1.685 Å, which is signiﬁcantly
shorter than the average cation-oxygen distance in the ceria
matrix 2.34 Å. The lowest-energy structural conﬁguration
of the vacancy-free material cannot be found by starting the
relaxation from the positions of the ideal ﬂuorite structure.
The reason is that the local reconstruction around the +4
solute ion requires the symmetry of the eight nearest neigh-
bor oxygen ions to be broken, which does not occur unless
temperature or an external distortion is applied in the simu-
lations. We achieve this by creating an oxygen vacancy and,
after relaxing the vacancy-containing structure, the lowest-
energy vacancy-free state is obtained by reﬁlling the vacant
oxygen position. The large distortions of the lattice that ac-
company the formation of the Si4+-O2−tetrahedron in the
vacancy-free material explain the low values for the unre-
laxed vacancy formation energy Ef
v unrelaxed and for the
relaxation energy Er. For Ce0.9688Si0.0312O1.9688, most of the
relaxation, which for the group 4b ceria solid solutions is
associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies, already
takes place during the reconstruction around the Si4+ ion in
the vacancy-free material. Figure 3 shows the projected den-

sity of states PDOS for the Si 3s, Si 3p, and Ce 4f orbitals,
given as an average over all the Si and Ce atoms in the unit
cell, respectively. The O 2p projections are divided into the
contribution from the OT atoms and from the remaining O
atoms. The O 2p projections that are restricted to the OT
atoms reveal that localization occurs for some OT 2p states.
These states are situated about 0.5–1.0 eV below the main
O 2p band see Fig. 3 and integration yields a total of two
electrons.
The formation of the Si4+-O2−tetrahedron will effectively
enlarge the octahedral interstitial positions in the ﬂuorite lat-
tice, which should lower the energy that is needed to put an
oxygen ion in one of these positions. In pure ceria, our cal-
culations predict that an energy of 4.05 eV is required to
form an oxygen interstitial in the octahedral position from
one of the lattice oxygen ions, i.e., a Frenkel defect. Such a
high value casts some doubt upon the conclusion that a large
fraction of Frenkel defects should exist in pure CeO2.35,36 If
the oxygen ion in the octahedral interstitial position is placed
next to its original lattice position, now a vacant site, it spon-
taneously relaxes back into this site. In Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2, the
energy needed to form a Frenkel defect is lowered to
3.09 eV. We calculated this value by placing the vacancy
close to the Si4+ ion in the 222 supercell and the oxygen
ion in an octahedral interstitial site away from the vacancy.
The gain in energy compared to pure ceria mainly comes
from the formation of the low-energy Si4+-O2−tetrahedron.
This mechanism may, at least partly, be responsible for the
observation of interstitial oxygen ions in nanoscale CeO2
powders.35,36
The properties of Ce0.9688Ge0.0312O2 are similar to the
properties of Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2. Both the relaxed and unre-
laxed vacancy formation energies are shifted slightly up-
wards and, equivalently, the occupied Ce f states move away
from the O 2p valence band edge by 0.03 eV compared to
Ce0.9688Si0.0312O1.9688 band separation. The Ge4+-OT dis-
tance is 1.83 Å, which is higher than for Si4+ but still sig-
niﬁcantly lower than the distance in the ideal ﬂuorite struc-
ture.
The driving force to form a tetrahedral arrangement with
the neighboring oxygen ions is weaker for Sn4+ and Pb4+
than for Si4+ or Ge4+, but from the projected density of states
not shown, we conclude that there is still some localization
of electrons on the oxygen ions that surround the tetravalent
ions. These states are still situated below the main O 2p
band. The localization is not restricted to the OT ions but it
involves instead all the eight nearest neighbor oxygen ions in
the ﬂuorite lattice. The average Sn4+-OT and Pb4+-OT dis-
tances
are
2.07
and
2.22 Å,
respectively.
Unlike
Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2 and Ce0.9688Ge0.0312O2, the vacancy forma-
tion energy for Ce0.9688Sn0.0312O2 lies on the line that indi-
cates the trend for the group 4b ceria compounds dashed
line in Fig. 1a, while the corresponding value for
Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 is surprisingly low see Fig. 1a. The va-
cancy formation energy for Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 is, as a matter
of fact, lower than for any of the other solute ions, in spite of
the fact that Pb4+ has the largest ionic radius with the ex-
ception of Th4+. This is the result of a different vacancy
formation mechanism in Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 than for any other
ceria solid solutions. For Ce0.9688M0.0312O1.9688 with M being
Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, or Sn, the two electrons that are left
behind when an oxygen atom is released from ceria localize
on two nearest neighbor Ce ions, which thus transform from
+4 to +3 and, due to Hund’s rule, they also exhibit a local-
ized
magnetic
moment
of
1B/Ce3+.
However,
for
Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O1.9688, the two extra electrons instead occupy
the states of mainly O 2p and Pb 6s character that are situ-
ated in the band gap 0.64 eV above the top of the O 2p
valence band Fig. 4. This signature is indicative of the pres-
ence of a Pb2+ ion. This implies that for Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2,
the initial reduction is, in fact, due to PbIV⇒PbII rather
than the usual CeIV⇒CeIII reaction. The total magnetic
moment of Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O1.9688 is zero, while it is 2B for
the
ferromagnetically
aligned
solution
for
Ce0.9688M0.0312O1.9688 M=Ce, Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, or Sn,
where the reduction occurs via CeIV⇒CeIII. The solu-
tion for Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O1.9688 with two localized Ce f elec-
trons can be obtained as a metastable state by starting the
calculation from a different magnetic and structural conﬁgu-
ration. This solution is 0.60 eV higher in energy triangle in
Fig. 1a than the ground-state solution. The metastable
Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O1.9688 solution predicts that the vacancy for-
mation energy increases compared to Ce0.9688Sn0.0312O2 and,

agreement with the general trend for the vacancy formation
energy. For the metastable solution, the PDOS does not in-
dicate any O 2p or Pb 6s states just above the top of the
valence band, but instead localized Ce f states two elec-
trons appear in the band gap. Our calculations show that the
average nearest neighbor Pb-O distance taken for the seven
nearest neighbor oxygen ions is 0.2 Å higher for the Pb2+
solution than for the Pb4+ solution, as expected from the
larger size of the Pb2+ ion compared to the Pb4+ ion. We have
also been able to estimate the vacancy formation energy in
Ce0.9688Sn0.0312O2 and Ce0.9688Ge0.0312O2 according to the
MIV⇒MII reaction. These values are 1.31 and 2.11 eV
higher in energy than for the corresponding CeIV⇒CeIII
reactions, respectively. Since Si, Zr, Hf, and Th are very
unstable in their divalent modiﬁcations, we were not able to
estimate the vacancy formation energies according to the
MIV⇒MII reaction. Ti exists in the divalent state, e.g.,
in TiO.37 Nevertheless, we were unable to calculate any ac-
curate value for the metastable TiIV⇒TiII reaction. The
tendency of the M4+ ions to undergo reduction is directly
related to the energy associated with the MO2⇒MO+O2/2

mental reaction enthalpies at 298 K for the Pb, Sn, Ge, and

that the reaction enthalpy for Pb is signiﬁcantly lower than
for the other elements, which is in agreement with our theo-
retical prediction of the reducibility of Pb4+ ions in

Ce0.9688Ti0.0312O2 the Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 number refers to the
MIV⇒MII reaction. Ce0.9688Th0.0312O2 is the only com-
pound that increases the reduction temperature. Moreover,
Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2, Ce0.9688Ge0.0312O2, Ce0.9688Sn0.0312O2, and
Ce0.9688Pb0.0312O2 all have lower reduction temperatures than
Ce0.9688Zr0.0312O2, which represents the current state of the
art OSC material not necessarily with this particular Zr con-
centration.
B. Migration barriers and defect binding (association) in
Ce0.9688M0.0312O1.9688
The oxygen diffusivity, which, for example, determines
how fast the bulk ceria material can exchange oxygen with
the surrounding environment, is inﬂuenced by interactions
between the dissolved +4 ions and the oxygen vacancies.
The diffusivity is governed by the activation energy for dif-
fusion, which is identiﬁed as the sum of the migration barrier
for moving an oxygen ion from one lattice site to a neigh-
boring vacant site Em and the binding energy between va-
cancies and tetravalent solutes. We estimated Em Fig. 6a
by calculating the energy that is needed to place an oxygen
ion in the saddle point position that is situated next to the +4
solute
ion
in
the
222
supercell
model
of
Ce0.96880M0.0312O1.9688. The saddle point is taken halfway be-
tween the oxygen sites involved in the diffusion process.39
The migrating oxygen ion was only allowed to relax in the
directions perpendicular to the migration path, while the re-
maining ions were fully relaxed. Compared to pure ceria, the
barrier decreases signiﬁcantly for Sn4+ and Pb4+, which is
understood from the fact that the small size of these ions
allows a simple passage through the saddle point. The barrier
for the saddle point next to a Pb2+ ion remember the
PbIV⇒PbII reaction mechanism is much higher than
for the Pb4+ case 1.52 eV compared to 0.27 eV, which is
due to the large size of the Pb2+ ion. This implies that the
diffusing oxygen ions in Pb-doped ceria would avoid the
migration paths involving saddle points close to the Pb2+
ions. One may speculate that the Pb2+ barrier is lowered by
an instantaneous electronic transition from Pb2+ to Pb4+,
accompanied by the formation of two Ce3+ ions, when an
oxygen ion passes through the saddle point. Our calculations
show that such a reaction is energetically favorable. Even
though both the Si4+ and the Ge4+ ions are small, their tetra-
hedral oxygen coordination results in migration barriers that
are of the same magnitude as for the larger Sn4+ and Pb4+
ions. We note that the migration barriers that enter the acti-
vation energy for diffusion correspond to an effective bulk
barrier and should not be directly identiﬁed with the barrier
close to the M4+ ions, at least not for low concentration of
solute ions.
Oxygen vacancies bind to the +4 solute ions and Fig. 6b
contains our calculated binding energies. The Pb2+-Va bind-
ing energy is approximately 0.1 eV higher than for Pb4+-Va
Pb4+-Va is shown in Fig. 6b. For small solute concentra-
tions, defect binding will increase the activation energy for
diffusion and thus decrease the diffusivity of oxygen ions.
Due to overlapping interaction ﬁelds of the solute ions, this
effect should decrease for increasing solute concentrations.
C. Dissolution of tetravalent solutes „M4+…, Ce0.9688M0.0312O2
The solution energy Es of +4 ions in ceria determines
the stability of the solid solution phases with respect to phase
separation into the constituent oxides. Figure 7 shows the
calculated values of Es for one +4 ion in the 222 super-
cell Ce0.9688M0.0312O2. The rutile structure was used as the
reference state of Si4+, Ge4+, Sn4+, and Pb4+. We note that the
ground-state structures of SiO2 and GeO2 is of -quartz type
and the corresponding solution energies in Fig. 7 should thus
be shifted slightly upward. For Th4+, the ﬂuorite structure
was used as the reference state, while we used the anatase
structure for Ti4+ and the monoclinic baddeleyite structure
for Hf4+ and Zr4+. In particular, we emphasize the excellent
agreement with experimental data for Zr4+.43 The solution
energies exhibit an approximately linear dependence on the
ionic radii. Ions of similar size as Ce4+ are easy to dissolve in
the CeO2 matrix, while small ions are more difﬁcult to dis-
solve. Since all the solution energies are positive, the solid

solutions will be metastable at low temperature, but at high
temperature, entropy provides a stabilizing contribution.
Nevertheless, there will be a strong tendency to phase sepa-
rate for the small solute ions. From Fig. 7, we conclude that
both Sn4+ and Pb4+ are easier to dissolve than Ti4+. At the
same time, Sn4+ and Pb4+ yield similar or even lower va-
cancy formation energies, i.e., they have higher reducibility.
Within each group 4a and 4b, there is an inverse relation
between high solution energy and high reactivity low va-
cancy formation energy, compare Fig. 1a. The unique
properties of Pb make it an exception, i.e., both the solution
energy and the vacancy formation energy are quite low.
D. Vacancy formation and M4+ solution energies in
Ce1−yMyO2
In order to clarify how the solution energy and the va-
cancy formation energy depend on the concentration of tet-
ravalent solutes, we have studied Ce1−yMyO2 with M being
Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Si, Ge, or Sn and y=0.0312, 0.0625, or 0.25.
The y=0.0312 case has been discussed extensively in the
preceding sections. In order to have the same vacancy con-
centration for every y, we have used the 222 supercell
setup, not only for y=0.0312 but also for y=0.0625 and y
=0.25. In the latter two cases, we have to make some as-
sumption about the distribution of the tetravalent solutes on
the Ce sublattice. The detailed distribution is not known from
experiments and, moreover, due to slow cationic diffusion,
the distribution does, in general, not correspond to complete
equilibrium. For each y, we tried two different models that
mimic the clustering and homogeneous equally spaced dis-
tribution of the solute ions. In the clustering model, for y
=0.0625, the two solute ions in the supercell are assumed to
be nearest neighbors, and for y=0.25, the solute ions are
assumed to occupy one separate 100 plane the solute ions
are nearest neighbors also in this case. The latter model
mimics the planar type of ordering pattern suggested for
CeZrO2 in Ref. 44. The models for the homogeneous distri-
bution were constructed by placing the solute ions at equal
distances from each other in the 222 supercell. In order
to ﬁnd the relaxed vacancy-free structures, we used the fol-
lowing technique. First, we removed an oxygen atom and
relaxed the structure and then we replaced the oxygen atom
again, as it was described for single Si4+ solutes in Sec. III A.
If we start the relaxation from the original ﬂuorite lattice
positions, we do not reach the ground-state structure. This
conclusion applies to M=Ti, Si, Ge, and Sn, while the
ground-state structure for M=Zr, Hf, and Th was obtained
by conventional relaxation schemes. Our DFT calculations
show that the homogeneous distribution of solute ions is
more stable than the clustered state Pb is an exception. In
order to illustrate this property, Fig. 8 shows the energy dif-
ference
between
the
two
distribution
models
for
Ce0.9375M0.0625O2, which is equivalent to the binding energy
of +4 solute ions negative values mean that the ions do not
want to have each other as nearest neighbors. The energy
difference between the two distribution models is the largest
for Si4+, Ge4+, Sn4+, and Ti4+ because these ions referred to
as group A in the following distort the original ﬂuorite struc-
ture to a much larger extent than the Zr4+, Hf4+, and Th4+
ions referred to as group B in the following. The large
distortions for group A follows from the tendency to form a
fourfold M4+-O2−coordination, e.g., the formation of the tet-
rahedral M4+-O2−environment in Ce0.9688Si0.0312O2 and
Ce0.9688Ge0.0312O2, instead of the eightfold oxygen coordina-
tion in the ﬂuorite crystal structure. We recall that SiO2,
GeO2, SnO2, and TiO2 group A all prefer the rutile crystal
structure fourfold coordination rather than the ﬂuorite
structure or any other closely related structure. The stability
of the rutile and ﬂuorite crystal structures is reversed for
ZrO2, HfO2, and ThO2 group B. If the +4 solutes in group
A are situated close to each other, the redistribution of the
surrounding oxygen ions into the tetrahedral coordination is
more difﬁcult than for the homogeneous solute distribution,
which explains the energetic preference for the latter distri-
bution. Pb4+ is the only solute ion that prefers the clustered
distribution, even though this is only marginally more stable
than the homogeneous distribution. Since PbO2 is more
stable in the rutile structure than in the ﬂuorite structure, we
classify Pb as a group A element, which is also consistent
with the results discussed below.
The volume relaxation for Ce0.75M0.25O2 is plotted in Fig.
9. These values refer to the lowest-energy structures, i.e., the
homogeneous distribution of solutes. At ﬁrst glance the data
points seem rather scattered, but if the group A and group B
solutes are treated separately, an almost linear function of the
ionic radii emerges for group B see the dashed line. The
trend is not as obvious for group A, but it is apparent that it
deviates from the group B behavior. In this context, we recall
that group A could, in fact, be further subdivided since the
ground-state structure of both SiO2 and GeO2 is the -quartz
structure. The reason for this is the high degree of structural
relaxation for group A compared to group B, which, in fact,
leads to the formation of a new ordered crystal structure for

the group A compounds that is closely related to the original
ﬂuorite structure. The new crystal structure is formed by dis-
placing half of the oxygen ions in the oxygen cube that sur-
rounds each M4+ ion in the ﬂuorite structure toward the M4+
ion itself, while the remaining oxygen ions move away from
the M4+ ion. This results in a fourfold tetrahedronlike envi-
ronment around each M4+ ion. This relaxation pattern is
equivalent to the structure in Fig. 2. In the homogeneous
structure model, the M4+ ions form a cubic sublattice and
thus the displaced oxygen ions will also form a separate sub-
lattice of cubic symmetry. All the compounds that belong to
group A form ordered superstructures of the type described
above, which explains their special behavior compared to the
group B compounds in Fig. 9.
The calculated concentration dependence of the solution
energies for the homogeneous distribution of solute ions is
shown in Fig. 10. There is an excellent agreement with ex-
periments for Zr4+,43 which validates the present modeling
approach. The highest and the lowest solution energies are
obtained for Si and Th, respectively. For Ce0.75M0.25O2 y
=0.25 with M being Ti, Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb, the solution
energy is lower than suggested by a linear extrapolation from
the y=0.0312 and y=0.0625 values, which follows from the
large structural relaxation and the formation of an ordered
superstructure, as described in the previous paragraph. From
Fig. 8a, we conclude that the solution energies for the clus-
tered distribution would be even higher than for the homo-
geneous distribution of solute ions.

neous distribution of solutes. Up to y=0.0312, the vacancy
formation energies decrease except for Th4+, but between
y=0.0312 and y=0.25, this trend is reversed and the energies
are of equal magnitude or even higher than for the low-
concentration range y=0.0312. Zhou et al. measured the
reduction energy vacancy formation energy for Ce1−yZryO2
and they reported a very weak concentration dependence,16
in agreement with our theoretical predictions. The experi-
mental value of Ef
v for Ce1−yZryO2 is 2.72 eV,15 which is
somewhat lower than our theoretical result especially if the
overestimation of the binding energy of O2 molecules is
taken into account. The reason for this partial discrepancy
will be further analyzed. The increase of the vacancy forma-
tion energy between y=0.0312 and y=0.25 is most signiﬁ-
cant for Ti4+, Si4+, Ge4+, Sn4+ and Pb4+, which correlates
with the large structural relaxations and the formation of or-
dered superstructures for these compounds group A. From
Fig. 8b, we conclude that the vacancy formation energy is
markedly lower for clustered solute ions than for the homo-
geneous distribution in Fig. 11, which correlates with the
higher solution energies for these compounds compared to
the homogeneous solute distribution.
For both y=0.0625 and y=0.25, reduction occurs via the
CeIV⇒CeIII reaction for all the solute ions except for
Pb4+, which is reduced according to PbIV⇒PbII. In the
222 supercell model of Ce0.9375Ti0.0625O2, one could
imagine the TiIV⇒TiIII reaction to be more favorable
than the CeIV⇒CIII reaction the other solute ions are
unstable in their trivalent modiﬁcation, but according to our
calculations, the latter reaction always occurs in the initial
reduction step. We checked if this conclusion is changed by
the application of a Hubbard U term between 2 and 6 eV for
the Ti 3d orbitals, but the CeIV⇒CIII reaction was still
the least endothermic.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Using density functional theory calculations, we have
shown that small amounts of dissolved SiO2, GeO2, SnO2, or
PbO2 improve the reducibility of ceria CeO2, as quantiﬁed
by the decrease of the vacancy formation energy. The reason
for
this
is
the
favorable
geometry
relaxation
of
the
Ce3+-M4+-Va clusters in the reduced samples, which results
in a gain in the band energy due to the motion of the local-
ized Ce 4f states in the band gap toward the valence band
edge, i.e., the decrease of the band separation. The reducibil-
ity increases in the sequence of CeO2-SnO2, CeO2-GeO2,
and CeO2-SiO2. For all these materials, the vacancy forma-
tion energy is lower than for the current state of the art
CeO2-ZrO2 materials. The group 4a solutes tend to form a
tetrahedral arrangement with the surrounding +4 ions; in par-
ticular, this tendency is strong for Si4+ and Ge4+, which is
accompanied by the localization of electrons on the nearest
neighbor oxygen ions. This yields highly distorted structures
for CeO2-SiO2 and CeO2-GeO2. CeO2-PbO2 is unique in the
sense that the initial reduction occurs by PbIV⇒PbII in-
stead of the usual CeIV⇒CeIII reaction. Among all the
investigated ceria compounds, CeO2-PbO2 has the highest
reducibility. For low solute concentrations, there is an in-
verse relation between high reducibility and the solution en-
ergy of tetravalent solutes. The +4 solute ions inﬂuence the
diffusivity of oxygen ions in two ways: by decreasing the
migration barrier close to the solute ions and by forming
bound defect complexes with the oxygen vacancies. The
former contribution decreases the activation energy for dif-
fusion and thus the diffusivity of oxygen ions, while the
latter works in the opposite direction. The height of the mi-
gration barrier and the defect binding energy are inversely
related. We have also studied how the solution energy and
the reducibility depend on the concentration of Ti, Zr, Hf,
Th, Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb solute ions. Starting from pure ceria,
there is an initial decrease of the reduction energy, after
which it remains almost constant Zr, Hf, and Th or in-
creases slightly Ti, Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb for high solute con-
centrations. The increase is a consequence of the formation
of an ordered superstructure from the defective ﬂuorite struc-
ture. The solution energies increase monotonously with con-
centration. Our calculations also reveal that the solutes do
not want to have each other as nearest neighbors and there-
fore favor a homogeneous distribution Pb is an exception;
in particular, this effect is important for ceria that contains
Si4+ and Ge4+ ions. The formation of metastable clusters of
+4 solute ions decreases the vacancy formation energy sig-
niﬁcantly.
