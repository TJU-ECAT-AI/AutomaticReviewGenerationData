1. "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
2. "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
3. "Doped oxides are an interesting class of oxidation catalyst, worth exploring by experiments."
4. "The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism."
5. "Conclusions based on energy differences (such as a TiO2 doped with Cu is easier to reduce than when doped with Au) are likely to be correct."
6. "The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."
