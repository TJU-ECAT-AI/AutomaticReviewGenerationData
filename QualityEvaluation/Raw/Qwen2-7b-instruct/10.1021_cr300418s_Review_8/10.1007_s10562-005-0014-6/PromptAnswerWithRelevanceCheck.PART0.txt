[1] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
[2] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "Our results suggest that the Au-doped TiO2 is a stronger oxidant than the pure oxide or the one with a neutral Au cluster on it."
[4] "One may presume that a dopant that makes it very easy to remove oxygen, will slow down the annihilation of the oxygen vacancy."
[5] "The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."
[6] "A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction."

The document discusses the impact of doping metal oxides with various elements on their catalytic properties, particularly in the context of CO oxidation. Dopants like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni are shown to weaken the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, enhancing the catalyst's ability to oxidize CO. High-valence dopants (HVDs) and same-valence dopants (SVDs) influence the catalytic properties differently, with SVDs generally making the catalysts more efficient by reducing the strength of the oxygen-oxide bond. Challenges in formulating general rules for dopant behavior exist due to factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide. Predictive rules are hindered by uncertainties in the nature of dopants and their interactions within the oxide matrix. The document suggests that while quantitative accuracy in DFT calculations may vary, qualitative conclusions about the role of dopants in catalysis are likely reliable.

本文讨论了向金属氧化物掺杂不同元素对其催化性能的影响，特别是CO氧化的背景下。Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等掺杂剂被证明能显著减弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键合，从而增强催化剂的CO氧化能力。高价掺杂剂（HVD）和同价掺杂剂（SVD）对催化剂性能的影响有所不同，SVD通常通过减弱氧-氧化物键合强度来提高催化效率。确定掺杂剂行为的一般规则存在挑战，这主要由于Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的可还原性等因素。在预测规则方面，掺杂剂的性质及其与氧化物矩阵的相互作用的不确定性是阻碍因素。文章指出，尽管密度泛函理论计算的定量准确性可能存在差异，但关于掺杂剂在催化作用中的角色的定性结论可能是可靠的。

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) significantly impact the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. By weakening the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, dopants facilitate the oxidation process, making doped oxides better catalysts for oxidation reactions. The computational and experimental studies reveal that dopants alter the reactivity of oxygen vacancies and molecules adsorbed at these sites, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior stem from the complexity of interactions, including Lewis acid-base relationships and the specific nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). Despite these challenges, the study indicates that doped oxides are promising candidates for oxidation catalysts, offering advantages over traditional metal clusters due to reduced metal content, improved resistance to sintering, and increased sensitivity to environmental changes. However, the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) calculations for oxide chemistry remains uncertain, particularly concerning the nature of the Kohn-Sham states and their potential errors in describing the electronic structure accurately.

同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对不同金属氧化物的催化性质产生了显著影响。通过削弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键，掺杂物促进了氧化过程，使得掺杂氧化物成为更好的氧化催化剂。计算和实验研究揭示，掺杂物改变了氧空位和吸附在其上的分子的活性，从而提高了催化效率。在形成一般预测规则时面临的挑战源于相互作用的复杂性，包括Lewis酸碱相互作用以及宿主氧化物的特定性质（可还原性vs.不可还原性）。尽管存在这些挑战，研究表明掺杂氧化物是氧化催化剂的有前景候选者，它们提供了与传统金属簇相比的优势，如减少金属含量、提高抗聚集能力、对外部环境变化的高度敏感性。然而，密度泛函理论（DFT）计算在氧化物化学中的准确性仍存在不确定性，特别是在描述电子结构时Kohn-Sham状态的性质可能引起的潜在误差方面。

The study explores how dopants, specifically Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni, impact the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly in terms of CO oxidation. It demonstrates that doping these oxides significantly weakens the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, enhancing their catalytic efficiency. The research confirms that doped oxides represent an intriguing category of oxidation catalysts worth experimental investigation. The catalytic process follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, and conclusions drawn from energy differences, like the ease of reducing a Cu-doped TiO2 compared to Au-doped TiO2, are expected to be accurate. Despite uncertainties in the density functional theory's accuracy for oxide chemistry, the study provides valuable insights into dopant behavior and catalytic performance.

The study explores whether doping oxides enhances their oxidation catalytic properties. It finds that adding metals like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni to titania or ceria significantly weakens the surface oxygen bond, making these materials better catalysts. The research indicates that doping with Au specifically increases the catalytic power. Copper doping in particular causes the most significant weakening of the oxygen-oxygen bond, suggesting it might be the most effective catalyst in this class. However, a balance must be struck between donating and acquiring oxygen atoms to maintain catalytic efficiency. Despite potential inaccuracies in calculating band gaps, the method effectively predicts binding energies, supporting the study's findings.
