[1] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
[2] "Doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "Our results suggest that the Au-doped TiO2 is a stronger oxidant than the pure oxide or the one with a neutral Au cluster on it."
[4] "Doped oxides are an interesting class of oxidation catalyst, worth exploring by experiments."
[5] "The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism."
[6] "Conclusions based on energy differences (such as a TiO2 doped with Cu is easier to reduce than when doped with Au) are likely to be correct."
[7] "These states are only supposed to provide the correct density and, strictly speaking, were not meant to describe the electronic structure."

The study explores how dopants, specifically Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni, impact the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly in terms of CO oxidation. It demonstrates that doping these oxides significantly weakens the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, enhancing their catalytic efficiency. The research confirms that doped oxides represent an intriguing category of oxidation catalysts worth experimental investigation. The catalytic process follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, and conclusions drawn from energy differences, like the ease of reducing a Cu-doped TiO2 compared to Au-doped TiO2, are expected to be accurate. Despite uncertainties in the density functional theory's accuracy for oxide chemistry, the study provides valuable insights into dopant behavior and catalytic performance.

研究探讨了Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物的催化性质，特别是CO氧化。结果显示，这些氧化物中的掺杂显著减弱了表面氧与氧化物之间的键合，提高了它们的催化效率。研究表明，掺杂氧化物是一个值得通过实验探索的氧化催化剂类别的有趣领域。催化过程遵循马尔斯-范克雷文机制，基于能量差异的结论（如Cu掺杂的TiO2比Au掺杂的TiO2更容易还原）很可能是正确的。尽管密度泛函理论在氧化物化学领域的准确性存在不确定性，但本研究提供了有关掺杂物行为和催化性能的重要见解。
