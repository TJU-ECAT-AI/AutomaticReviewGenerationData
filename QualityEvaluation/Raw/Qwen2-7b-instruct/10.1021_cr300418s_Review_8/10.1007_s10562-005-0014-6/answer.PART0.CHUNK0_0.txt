[1] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
[2] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "Our results suggest that the Au-doped TiO2 is a stronger oxidant than the pure oxide or the one with a neutral Au cluster on it."
[4] "One may presume that a dopant that makes it very easy to remove oxygen, will slow down the annihilation of the oxygen vacancy."
[5] "The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."
[6] "A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction."

The document discusses the impact of doping metal oxides with various elements on their catalytic properties, particularly in the context of CO oxidation. Dopants like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni are shown to weaken the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, enhancing the catalyst's ability to oxidize CO. High-valence dopants (HVDs) and same-valence dopants (SVDs) influence the catalytic properties differently, with SVDs generally making the catalysts more efficient by reducing the strength of the oxygen-oxide bond. Challenges in formulating general rules for dopant behavior exist due to factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide. Predictive rules are hindered by uncertainties in the nature of dopants and their interactions within the oxide matrix. The document suggests that while quantitative accuracy in DFT calculations may vary, qualitative conclusions about the role of dopants in catalysis are likely reliable.

本文讨论了向金属氧化物掺杂不同元素对其催化性能的影响，特别是CO氧化的背景下。Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等掺杂剂被证明能显著减弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键合，从而增强催化剂的CO氧化能力。高价掺杂剂（HVD）和同价掺杂剂（SVD）对催化剂性能的影响有所不同，SVD通常通过减弱氧-氧化物键合强度来提高催化效率。确定掺杂剂行为的一般规则存在挑战，这主要由于Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的可还原性等因素。在预测规则方面，掺杂剂的性质及其与氧化物矩阵的相互作用的不确定性是阻碍因素。文章指出，尽管密度泛函理论计算的定量准确性可能存在差异，但关于掺杂剂在催化作用中的角色的定性结论可能是可靠的。
