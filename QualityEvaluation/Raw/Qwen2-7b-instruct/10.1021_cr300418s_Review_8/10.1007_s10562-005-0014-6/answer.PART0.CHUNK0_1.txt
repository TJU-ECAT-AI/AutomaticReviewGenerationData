[1] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
[2] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "These calculations suggest that it is worthwhile to explore doped oxides as oxidation catalysts."
[4] "The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."
[5] "We propose that removing two oxygen atoms from the surface facilitates the conversion of the ion to a neutral Au atom."
[6] "Moreover, a too rapid removal of the oxygen atoms will compromise the stability of the catalyst, by formation of neutral dopant atoms."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) significantly impact the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. By weakening the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, dopants facilitate the oxidation process, making doped oxides better catalysts for oxidation reactions. The computational and experimental studies reveal that dopants alter the reactivity of oxygen vacancies and molecules adsorbed at these sites, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior stem from the complexity of interactions, including Lewis acid-base relationships and the specific nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). Despite these challenges, the study indicates that doped oxides are promising candidates for oxidation catalysts, offering advantages over traditional metal clusters due to reduced metal content, improved resistance to sintering, and increased sensitivity to environmental changes. However, the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) calculations for oxide chemistry remains uncertain, particularly concerning the nature of the Kohn-Sham states and their potential errors in describing the electronic structure accurately.

同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对不同金属氧化物的催化性质产生了显著影响。通过削弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键，掺杂物促进了氧化过程，使得掺杂氧化物成为更好的氧化催化剂。计算和实验研究揭示，掺杂物改变了氧空位和吸附在其上的分子的活性，从而提高了催化效率。在形成一般预测规则时面临的挑战源于相互作用的复杂性，包括Lewis酸碱相互作用以及宿主氧化物的特定性质（可还原性vs.不可还原性）。尽管存在这些挑战，研究表明掺杂氧化物是氧化催化剂的有前景候选者，它们提供了与传统金属簇相比的优势，如减少金属含量、提高抗聚集能力、对外部环境变化的高度敏感性。然而，密度泛函理论（DFT）计算在氧化物化学中的准确性仍存在不确定性，特别是在描述电子结构时Kohn-Sham状态的性质可能引起的潜在误差方面。
