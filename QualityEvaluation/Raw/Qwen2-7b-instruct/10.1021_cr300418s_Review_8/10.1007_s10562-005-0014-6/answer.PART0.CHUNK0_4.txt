1. "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
2. "Doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
3. "Our results suggest that the Au-doped TiO2 is a stronger oxidant than the pure oxide or the one with a neutral Au cluster on it."
4. "Doping titania with copper produces the greatest weakening of the oxygenoxide bond."
5. "A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction."
6. "There are many examples in which the Kohn-Sham states give the wrong band gap but describe, nevertheless, adsorbate binding energies correctly."

The study explores whether doping oxides enhances their oxidation catalytic properties. It finds that adding metals like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni to titania or ceria significantly weakens the surface oxygen bond, making these materials better catalysts. The research indicates that doping with Au specifically increases the catalytic power. Copper doping in particular causes the most significant weakening of the oxygen-oxygen bond, suggesting it might be the most effective catalyst in this class. However, a balance must be struck between donating and acquiring oxygen atoms to maintain catalytic efficiency. Despite potential inaccuracies in calculating band gaps, the method effectively predicts binding energies, supporting the study's findings.

研究探讨了掺杂氧化物是否能增强其氧化催化性能。发现向二氧化钛或氧化铈中添加金、银、铜、铂、钯和镍等金属显著削弱了表面氧键，使这些材料成为更好的催化剂。研究表明，特别是用金掺杂可以显著提高催化能力。铜掺杂尤其导致氧-氧键的最显著削弱，暗示它可能是这一类化合物中最有效的催化剂。然而，为了保持催化效率，必须在提供和获取氧原子之间找到平衡。尽管可能在计算带隙时存在误差，但该方法能够准确预测吸附剂结合能，支持研究结果的有效性。
