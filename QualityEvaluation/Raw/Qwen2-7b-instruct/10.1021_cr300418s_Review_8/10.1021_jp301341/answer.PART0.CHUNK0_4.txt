[1] "According to the rule proposed here, we can neutralize the effect of a Lewis acid by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base."
[2] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[3] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."

The rules propose that same-valence dopants (SVDs) can neutralize the effect of a Lewis acid on a surface by adsorbing a Lewis base. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, facilitating oxygen vacancy formation and enhancing the binding energy of single metal atoms. High-valence dopants, acting as Lewis bases, strongly adsorb Lewis acids like O2 or halogens (X2).

规则提出，等价掺杂剂（SVD）可以通过吸附Lewis碱来中和表面的Lewis酸效应。可还原氧化物显示出Lewis酸性，促进氧空位形成并增强单个金属原子的结合能。高价掺杂剂作为Lewis碱强烈吸附如O2或卤素（X2）这样的Lewis酸。
