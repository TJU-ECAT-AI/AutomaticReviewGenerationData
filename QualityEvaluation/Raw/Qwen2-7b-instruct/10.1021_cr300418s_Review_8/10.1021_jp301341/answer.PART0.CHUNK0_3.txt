[1] "Many trends related to chemical processes relevant to catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted (or rationalized) by a few rules pertaining to the Lewis acidbase properties of the chemicals involved."
[2] "These rules provide guidance on possible ways of manipulating oxide surface chemistry."
[3] "An oxide surface doped with a LVD lowers the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, increases the binding energy of H and CH3 to surface oxygen, and makes the dissociative adsorption of CH4 (with H and CH3bonded to surface oxygen) more exothermic than on the undoped oxide."
[4] "According to the rule proposed here, we can neutralize the effect of a Lewis acid by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base."
[5] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[6] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."

1. Many trends in catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted using rules about Lewis acid-base properties. These rules guide manipulation of oxide surface chemistry.
2. The proposed rules offer insight into possible methods for altering oxide surface characteristics.
3. Doping an oxide surface with a low-valence dopant (LVD) reduces the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, enhances the bonding of H and CH3 to the surface, and makes the dissociative adsorption of CH4 more exothermic compared to an undoped oxide.
4. By placing a Lewis base on a surface, the effect of a Lewis acid can be nullified.
5. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, which facilitate oxygen-vacancy formation and boost the binding energy of single metal atoms.
6. High-valence dopants act as Lewis bases, effectively attracting Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules.

1. 许多与氧化物表面催化化学相关的趋势可以通过涉及化学物质Lewis酸碱性质的规则来预测。这些规则提供了改变氧化物表面性质的可能性指导。
2. 提出的规则为调整氧化物表面特性提供了一些见解。
3. 在氧化物表面添加低价掺杂剂（LVD）可以降低氧空位形成能，增强氢和CH3与表面氧的结合力，并使甲烷的离解吸附过程更加放热，相比未掺杂的氧化物而言。
4. 在表面上放置一个Lewis碱可以抵消Lewis酸的效果。
5. 可还原氧化物显示出Lewis酸的性质，这有助于氧空位的形成并增加单金属原子的结合能。
6. 高价掺杂剂作为Lewis碱，有效地吸引如O2或卤素分子等Lewis酸。
