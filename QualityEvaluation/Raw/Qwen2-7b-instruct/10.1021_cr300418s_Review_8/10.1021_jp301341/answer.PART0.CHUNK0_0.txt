[1] "Many trends related to chemical processes relevant to catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted (or rationalized) by a few rules pertaining to the Lewis acidbase properties of the chemicals involved."
[2] "An oxide surface doped with a LVD lowers the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, increases the binding energy of H and CH3 to surface oxygen, and makes the dissociative adsorption of CH4 more exothermic than on the undoped oxide."
[3] "According to the rule proposed here, we can neutralize the effect of a Lewis acid by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base."
[4] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[5] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."

1. The chemical processes related to catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted or rationalized by rules involving the Lewis acidbase properties of the chemicals involved.
2. Doping an oxide surface with a low-valence dopant (LVD) affects the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, increases the binding energy of hydrogen and methyl groups, and makes the dissociative adsorption of methane more exothermic.
3. The effect of a Lewis acid on a surface can be neutralized by adsorbing a Lewis base onto the surface.
4. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, which facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies and enhance the binding of metal atoms.
5. High-valence dopants (HVDs) are Lewis bases that strongly adsorb Lewis acids like oxygen or halogen molecules.

1. 与化学过程相关的催化化学氧化物表面的化学过程可以通过涉及化学物质的Lewis酸碱性质的规则来预测或解释。
2. 向氧化物表面掺杂低价掺杂剂（LVD）会影响氧空位形成能，增加氢和甲基团的吸附能，并使甲烷的离解吸附更放热。
3. 可以通过在表面上吸附一个Lewis碱来中和Lewis酸的作用效果。
4. 可还原氧化物显示出Lewis酸的性质，这有助于形成氧空位并增强金属原子的结合。
5. 高价掺杂剂（HVD）是Lewis碱，强烈吸附氧或卤素等Lewis酸分子。
