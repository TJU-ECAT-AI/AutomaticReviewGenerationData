<p>Many experiments with ceria or titania have shown (14, 64, 95-103) that, unless special precautions are taken, Ce3+ and Ti3+ are present in TiO2 and CeO2. Something always reduces some of the Ce4+ or Ti4+ cations. Moreover, it was observed that the formation of oxygen vacancies or the presence of hydroxyls on the surface increases the number of the reduced cations. Because the vacancies and the hydroxyls are Lewis bases, this observation suggests that the cations in these two oxides act as Lewis acids.</p>
<p>Recent calculations have helped clarify the interaction between oxygen vacancies and acidic properties of the reducible cations in ceria (6, 12, 58, 104) and rutile. (40, 105) These calculations have shown that the two unpaired electrons created when an oxygen atom is removed (to create an oxygen vacancy) become localized on two Ce or two Ti atoms, reducing them from a formal charge of 4+ to 3+. The reduction of the cations is accompanied by a displacement of the oxygen atoms from their normal position (i.e., in the stoichiometric oxide) to form a polaron.</p>
<p>The fact that Ce ions are Lewis acids has interesting consequences when ceria is doped with a high-valence dopant (HVD). A HVD is a dopant that has a higher valence than the cation it substitutes. For example, pentavalent Ta is a HVD when it dopes ceria. A HVD is a Lewis base because it has an excess of valence electrons, when compared to the cation it substitutes.</p>
<p>Doping ceria with Mo, W, Ta, Nb, Ru, Pt, or Zr has roughly the same effect on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. (87) This is unexpected since the Zr, Ta, and Nb form very stable oxides, and one would think that they would make strong bonds with the neighboring oxygen atoms in the doped ceria. Moreover, Ru and Pt oxides are much less stable than ceria, and one would expect that they would bind the neighboring oxygen atoms more weakly than Zr, Ta, or Nb. This is not what is observed: the acidbase neutralization process mentioned above makes all dopants tetravalent, and because of this, all these dopants have a similar effect on the neighboring oxygen atoms.</p>
<p>High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one. To illustrate the difference, we contrast the effect of Ta dopant in ZrO2 and in CeO2. In ceria, a Ta dopant donates an electron (87) to the oxide to reduce a Ce4+ to Ce3+. Such reduction does not occur when Ta dopes ZrO2 since Zr2O3 does not exist, and there is no driving force to create Zr3+. When it replaces a Zr atom in ZrO2, a Ta atom can use only four of its five valence electrons. The unused electron stays on the Ta dopant, turning it into a strong Lewis base.</p>

1. Reducible oxides like ceria and titania contain Lewis acids such as Ce3+ and Ti3+ ions. The formation of oxygen vacancies or hydroxyls on the surface increases the number of these reduced cations, suggesting that the cations act as Lewis acids.
2. The interaction between oxygen vacancies and the acidic properties of reducible cations in ceria and rutile involves the localization of unpaired electrons on the cations, causing their reduction from a formal charge of 4+ to 3+. This reduction leads to the displacement of oxygen atoms from their normal positions in the stoichiometric oxide.
3. High-valence dopants (HVDs) in ceria are Lewis bases due to their excess valence electrons, allowing them to neutralize the acidity of the cations. This results in a similar effect on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation across different HVDs.
4. High-valence dopants in reducible oxides exhibit different behavior compared to those in irreducible oxides. For instance, a Ta dopant reduces Ce4+ to Ce3+ in ceria but does not reduce Zr4+ to Zr3+ in zirconia due to the lack of a driving force for Zr3+ formation. Instead, the unused electron remains on the Ta dopant, making it a strong Lewis base.

1. 氧化铈和氧化钛中的可还原氧化物包含Lewis酸如Ce3+和Ti3+离子。氧空位或表面羟基的形成会增加这些还原态阳离子的数量，这表明这些阳离子作为Lewis酸的作用。
2. 氧化铈和氧化锆中氧空位与可还原性阳离子的相互作用涉及未配对电子在阳离子上的定位，导致它们从正式电荷为4+减少到3+。这种减少导致氧原子从正常位置在化学式氧化物中移位。
3. 氧化铈中的高价掺杂剂（HVD）是由于它们的额外价电子而成为Lewis碱。这允许它们中和阳离子的酸性，导致氧气空位形成能量在不同HVD下具有相似的影响。
4. 在可还原氧化物中的高价掺杂剂与在不可还原氧化物中的行为不同。例如，在氧化铈中Ta掺杂会将Ce4+减少为Ce3+，但在氧化锆中不会将Zr4+减少为Zr3+，因为缺乏Zr3+形成的驱动力。相反，剩余的未使用电子保留在Ta掺杂剂上，使其成为一个强Lewis碱。
