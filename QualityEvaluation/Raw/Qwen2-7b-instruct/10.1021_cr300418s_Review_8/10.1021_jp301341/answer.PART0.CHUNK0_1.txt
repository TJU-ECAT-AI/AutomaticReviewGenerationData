[1] "These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair."
[2] "According to our rules, a base binds substantially more strongly to the surface of an oxide doped with a LVD than to the surface of the undoped one."
[3] "If doping an oxide with a LVD turns it into a Lewis acid, then doping should increase substantially the binding energy of any Lewis base, not just the formation of an oxygen vacancy."
[4] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[5] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."

1. The rules proposed in the document are general, applicable to any chemical process involving a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the specific substances involved. The predictions made by these rules are significant in magnitude and seem to universally apply to such interactions.

2. The presence of a low-valence dopant (LVD) on an oxide surface increases the binding energy of a Lewis base significantly compared to the undoped surface.

3. Doping an oxide with a Lewis acid leads to an enhancement in the binding energy of all Lewis bases adsorbed onto the surface.

4. Reducible oxides exhibit acidic properties, facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies and enhancing the binding of single metal atoms onto their surfaces.

5. High-valence dopants function as Lewis bases, strongly adsorbing Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules.

1. 提出的规则普遍适用，适用于任何涉及路易斯酸和碱的化学过程，无论涉及的具体物质如何。这些规则预测的效应在数量级上是显著的，并且似乎普遍适用于此类相互作用。

2. 在氧化物表面掺杂低价原子（LVD）会大幅度增加路易斯碱在掺杂表面上的结合能，与未掺杂表面相比。

3. 对氧化物进行掺杂使得氧化物成为路易斯酸，这显著增强了吸附于其表面的所有路易斯碱的结合能。

4. 可还原氧化物表现出酸性特性，促进氧空位的形成并增强单个金属原子在其表面的吸附。

5. 高价掺杂剂充当路易斯碱，强烈吸附如O2或卤素分子这样的路易斯酸。
