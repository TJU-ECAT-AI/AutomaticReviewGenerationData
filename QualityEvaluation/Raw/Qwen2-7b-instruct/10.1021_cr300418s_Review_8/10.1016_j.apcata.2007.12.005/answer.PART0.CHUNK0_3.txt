<p>The text of the study focuses on the preparation of ceria-zirconia oxides with different ceria content, and evaluates their effects on structure and reductive properties using various techniques such as XRD, DRS, FTIR, Raman, XPS, TGA, and TPR.</p>
<p>It is stated that the tetragonal phase of zirconia is preserved in all ceria-zirconia oxides, although they retain a high number of defect sites caused by a strong interaction between zirconia and cerium oxide species.</p>
<p>An enrichment of the zirconia surface with a fluorite structure of ceria is observed for the ceria-zirconia oxide with the highest ceria content (12 wt%).</p>
<p>The samples subjected to consecutive reduction-oxidation cycles at different temperatures showed good redox properties related to the increase of oxygen mobility.</p>
<p>The study concludes that these ceria-zirconia oxide systems, displaying high surface and good thermal stability, are similar to chemically mixed oxides due to the strong interaction between the zirconia carrier and deposited ceria.</p>

The study investigates the preparation of ceria-zirconia oxides with varying ceria content, evaluating their structural and reductive properties through various analytical techniques. It is found that the tetragonal phase of zirconia remains intact across all samples, retaining numerous defect sites due to the strong interaction between zirconia and cerium oxide species. An enhancement of the zirconia surface with a fluorite structure of ceria is noted in the sample with the highest ceria content. The samples exhibit improved redox properties with increased oxygen mobility after successive reduction-oxidation cycles at different temperatures. These ceria-zirconia systems, characterized by high surface area and thermal stability, are comparable to chemically mixed oxides, attributed to the strong interaction between the zirconia carrier and deposited ceria.

本研究探讨了不同铈含量的铈锆氧化物的制备，通过各种分析技术评估了它们的结构和还原性质。发现锆酸盐的四方相在所有样品中保持不变，保留了大量的缺陷位点，这是由于铈氧化物物种与锆之间的强烈相互作用。在含铈量最高的样品中，锆表面被氟化结构的铈丰富。在不同温度下进行连续还原-氧化循环后，样品显示出与氧流动性增加相关的良好还原性质。这些铈锆系统，具有高表面积和热稳定性，类似于化学混合氧化物，归因于载体锆和沉积铈之间的强烈相互作用。
