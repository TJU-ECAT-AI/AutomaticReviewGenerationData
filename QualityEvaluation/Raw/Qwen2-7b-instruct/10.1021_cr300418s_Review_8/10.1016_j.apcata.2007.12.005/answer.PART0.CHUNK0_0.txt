[1] "The objective of our work is to stabilize highly dispersed ceria on zirconia and obtain ceria-zirconia oxides with high thermal stability and surface area and good redox properties."
[2] "The reducibility of the carrier of supported metal catalysts is a very important issue in connection with its ability to generate oxygen vacancies and transfer the oxygen onto the metal particles."
[3] "The high thermal stability and high reducibility of these oxides would make them very attractive carriers for supported Pt catalysts for CH4 reforming reactions."
