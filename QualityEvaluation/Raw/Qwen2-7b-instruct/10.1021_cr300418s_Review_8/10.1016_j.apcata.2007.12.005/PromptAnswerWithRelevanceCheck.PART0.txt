[1] "It should be noted that the overall absorption of the CeO2 ZrO2 oxides is significantly higher than that of pure zirconia (Fig. 3)."
[2] "Moreover, the position of the edge onset is slightly higher than that for the oxides treated at low temperature."
[3] "The position of both maxima shifts to higher energies."

[5] "The redox properties of the pure oxides, as well as of the mixed oxides, subjected to different treatments, are shown in Fig. 7."
[6] "The characteristic peak in TPR profiles due to the surface reduction of the fresh materials disappeared after subjecting the samples to reoxidation at 773 K (R-O773) (Fig. 7)."
[7] "The redox behaviour of the samples after R-O1073 is modified,since the reduction occurs concurrently at the surface and in the bulk."

[9] "An unusually low OSC is obtained for CeO2."
[10] "Although CeO2ZrO2 oxides are not true mixed oxides,being prepared by impregnation of ZrO2 with a solution of cerium nitrate, the results clearly indicate that a strong interaction exists between the zirconia carrier and deposited ceria, which makes the system similar to chemically mixed oxides."

The study examines the effects of ceria (CeO2) content, calcination temperature, and the interaction between components on the structure and reductive properties of ceria-zirconia oxides (CeO2ZrO2). These oxides were prepared by impregnation, and their properties were evaluated using various techniques. The research highlights the preservation of the tetragonal phase of zirconia in all CeO2ZrO2 oxides despite the presence of defect sites caused by a strong interaction between zirconia and cerium oxide species. An enrichment of the zirconia surface with a fluorite structure of CeO2 is observed in the CeO2ZrO2 oxide with the highest CeO2 content (12 wt%). The samples subjected to consecutive reduction-oxidation cycles at different temperatures show good redox properties related to the increase of oxygen mobility. The authors conclude that these CeO2ZrO2 oxide systems display high surface area and thermal stability, similar to chemically mixed oxides, due to the strong interaction between the zirconia carrier and deposited ceria. The redox properties of the samples after reoxidation at different temperatures are modified, with the reduction occurring concurrently at the surface and in the bulk. The study also notes that the low-temperature process primarily accounts for surface reduction, and the presence of two peaks for bulk reduction was previously reported for solid solution Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. Additionally, the research discusses the OSC (oxygen storage capacity) of the CeO2ZrO2 oxides, with the CeO2-rich samples showing higher H2 consumption after reoxidation at both temperatures compared to the fresh samples and pure zirconia.

The study investigates the preparation of ceria-zirconia oxides with varying ceria content, evaluating their structural and reductive properties through various analytical techniques. It is found that the tetragonal phase of zirconia remains intact across all samples, retaining numerous defect sites due to the strong interaction between zirconia and cerium oxide species. An enhancement of the zirconia surface with a fluorite structure of ceria is noted in the sample with the highest ceria content. The samples exhibit improved redox properties with increased oxygen mobility after successive reduction-oxidation cycles at different temperatures. These ceria-zirconia systems, characterized by high surface area and thermal stability, are comparable to chemically mixed oxides, attributed to the strong interaction between the zirconia carrier and deposited ceria.

The document discusses how the reducibility of carriers in metal catalysts is crucial for generating oxygen vacancies and transferring oxygen to metal particles, impacting catalytic activity. The authors aim to create ceria-zirconia oxides with high thermal stability, surface area, and redox properties, making them suitable for supporting Pt catalysts in CH4 reforming reactions. The study reveals that bulk reduction predominates over surface reduction during high-temperature redox aging, while surface reduction plays a more significant role at lower temperatures. CeO2-rich samples exhibit enhanced reducibility after reoxidation, attributed to the segregation of Ce3+ on the surface, forming ceria-rich clusters. This segregation is confirmed by an increase in the surface atomic ratio of Ce/Ce + Zr.

文档讨论了催化剂载体的可还原性对于生成氧空位和将氧传输到金属粒子的重要性，这影响了催化活性。作者的目标是制备具有高热稳定性和表面面积以及良好还原性的铈锆氧化物，使其适合支持Pt催化剂在CH4重整反应中的应用。研究表明，在高温还原老化过程中，主要发生的是体相还原，而表面还原作用在较低温度下更为显著。铈含量高的样品在再氧化后显示出增强的还原性，这归因于表面铈3+的分离，形成了铈富集簇。这一分离通过表面铈/（铈+锆）原子比的增加得到了确认。
