[1] "It should be noted that the overall absorption of the CeO2 ZrO2 oxides is significantly higher than that of pure zirconia (Fig. 3)."
[2] "Moreover, the position of the edge onset is slightly higher than that for the oxides treated at low temperature."
[3] "The position of both maxima shifts to higher energies."
[4] "The intensity of the second maximum rises with increasing CeO2 content in the CeO2ZrO2 samples."
[5] "The redox properties of the pure oxides, as well as of the mixed oxides, subjected to different treatments, are shown in Fig. 7."
[6] "The characteristic peak in TPR profiles due to the surface reduction of the fresh materials disappeared after subjecting the samples to reoxidation at 773 K (R-O773) (Fig. 7)."
[7] "The redox behaviour of the samples after R-O1073 is modified,since the reduction occurs concurrently at the surface and in the bulk."
[8] "It is generally accepted that the low-temperature process accounts for reduction of the surface."
[9] "An unusually low OSC is obtained for CeO2."
[10] "Although CeO2ZrO2 oxides are not true mixed oxides,being prepared by impregnation of ZrO2 with a solution of cerium nitrate, the results clearly indicate that a strong interaction exists between the zirconia carrier and deposited ceria, which makes the system similar to chemically mixed oxides."

The study examines the effects of ceria (CeO2) content, calcination temperature, and the interaction between components on the structure and reductive properties of ceria-zirconia oxides (CeO2ZrO2). These oxides were prepared by impregnation, and their properties were evaluated using various techniques. The research highlights the preservation of the tetragonal phase of zirconia in all CeO2ZrO2 oxides despite the presence of defect sites caused by a strong interaction between zirconia and cerium oxide species. An enrichment of the zirconia surface with a fluorite structure of CeO2 is observed in the CeO2ZrO2 oxide with the highest CeO2 content (12 wt%). The samples subjected to consecutive reduction-oxidation cycles at different temperatures show good redox properties related to the increase of oxygen mobility. The authors conclude that these CeO2ZrO2 oxide systems display high surface area and thermal stability, similar to chemically mixed oxides, due to the strong interaction between the zirconia carrier and deposited ceria. The redox properties of the samples after reoxidation at different temperatures are modified, with the reduction occurring concurrently at the surface and in the bulk. The study also notes that the low-temperature process primarily accounts for surface reduction, and the presence of two peaks for bulk reduction was previously reported for solid solution Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. Additionally, the research discusses the OSC (oxygen storage capacity) of the CeO2ZrO2 oxides, with the CeO2-rich samples showing higher H2 consumption after reoxidation at both temperatures compared to the fresh samples and pure zirconia.

研究考察了铈氧化物（CeO2）含量、煅烧温度以及组分之间相互作用对铈锆氧化物（CeO2ZrO2）结构和还原性质的影响。这些氧化物通过浸渍法制备，并使用多种技术对其性质进行了评估。研究强调了在所有CeO2ZrO2氧化物中，四面体锆氧化物相得以保留，尽管存在由铈氧化物物种与锆氧化物之间的强烈相互作用引起的缺陷位点。发现铈氧化物含量为12 wt%的氧化物表面富含氟化结构的铈氧化物。样品经过不同温度的连续还原-氧化循环后，显示出与氧移动性增加相关的良好还原性质。作者得出结论，这些CeO2ZrO2氧化物系统具有高表面积和热稳定性，类似于化学混合氧化物，这是由于锆载体与沉积铈之间的强烈相互作用。研究还指出，样品在不同温度下的再氧化后，其还原性质发生了改变，表面和内部同时发生还原。此外，研究讨论了铈氧化物（CeO2）的氧存储容量（OSC），铈含量高的样品在再氧化后，在两个温度下显示更高的氢消耗量，与新鲜样品和纯锆氧化物相比。
