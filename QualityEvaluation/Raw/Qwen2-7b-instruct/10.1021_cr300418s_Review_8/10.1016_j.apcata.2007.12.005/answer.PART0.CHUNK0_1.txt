[1] "An important feature associated with binary CeO2ZrO2 systems is to improve their low-temperature reducibility at moderate temperatures or their oxygen storage/release capacity."
[2] "The reducibility of the carrier of supported metal catalysts is a very important issue regarding its ability to generate oxygen vacancies and transfer the oxygen onto the metal particles."
[3] "The objective of our work is to stabilize highly dispersed ceria on zirconia and obtain ceriazirconia oxides with high thermal stability and surface area and good redox properties."
[4] "The redox properties of the samples after R-O1073 is modified, since the reduction occurs concurrently at the surface and in the bulk."
[5] "The high surface area favours surface reduction at a lower temperature similar to the observation for mixed Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 oxides prepared by solgel method."

The study focuses on stabilizing ceria on zirconia to create ceriazirconia oxides with high thermal stability and surface area, aiming for good redox properties. The system improves low-temperature reducibility and oxygen storage/release capacity. The redox behavior of the samples changes after redox aging, allowing surface and bulk reductions to occur simultaneously. The high surface area enables easier surface reduction at lower temperatures, similar to mixed Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 oxides made via solgel method.

研究重点是稳定铈在锆酸盐上的分布，以制备具有高热稳定性和表面积的铈锆氧化物，旨在获得良好的还原性。该系统提高了低温可还原性以及氧存储/释放能力。样品的还原行为在红氧老化后改变，允许表面和内部同时进行还原。高表面积使得表面还原更容易在较低温度下发生，类似于通过溶胶法制成的混合Ce0.5Zr0.5O2氧化物。
