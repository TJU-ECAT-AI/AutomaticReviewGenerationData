<p>It is well known that the reducibility of the carrier of supported metal catalysts is a very important issue regarding its ability to generate oxygen vacancies and transfer the oxygen onto the metal particles.</p>
<p>This refers to redox behaviour that is relevant to catalysis and considers all the characteristics of the reduction and oxidation processes.</p>
<p>The objective of our work is to stabilize highly dispersed ceria on zirconia and obtain ceria-zirconia oxides with high thermal stability and surface area and good redox properties.</p>
<p>The high thermal stability and high reducibility of these oxides would make them very attractive carriers for supported Pt catalysts for CH4 reforming reactions.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that the low-temperature process accounts for reduction of the surface. It has been observed [18] that bulk reduction may prevail due to the high-temperature redox aging, while the role of surface reduction diminishes.</p>
<p>By contrast, the highest reduction degree of ceria is mainly due to the bulk reduction of the larger ceria crystallites (Table 1).</p>
<p>CeO2-rich samples show higher H2 consumption after reoxidation at both temperatures compared to those of the fresh samples and pure ZrO2 (Table 3).</p>
<p>A partial segregation of Ce3+ occurs on the surface of the oxides due to the higher ionic radii of Ce3+ (1.1 A) compared to that of Ce4+ (0.97 A) and Zr4+(0.84 A).</p>
<p>Upon reoxidation, the segregated cerium cations form small ceria-rich clusters on top of the oxides. The surface segregation of cerium species is confirmed by the increasing surface atomic Ce/Ce + Zr ratio (Table 2).</p>

The document discusses how the reducibility of carriers in metal catalysts is crucial for generating oxygen vacancies and transferring oxygen to metal particles, impacting catalytic activity. The authors aim to create ceria-zirconia oxides with high thermal stability, surface area, and redox properties, making them suitable for supporting Pt catalysts in CH4 reforming reactions. The study reveals that bulk reduction predominates over surface reduction during high-temperature redox aging, while surface reduction plays a more significant role at lower temperatures. CeO2-rich samples exhibit enhanced reducibility after reoxidation, attributed to the segregation of Ce3+ on the surface, forming ceria-rich clusters. This segregation is confirmed by an increase in the surface atomic ratio of Ce/Ce + Zr.

文档讨论了催化剂载体的可还原性对于生成氧空位和将氧传输到金属粒子的重要性，这影响了催化活性。作者的目标是制备具有高热稳定性和表面面积以及良好还原性的铈锆氧化物，使其适合支持Pt催化剂在CH4重整反应中的应用。研究表明，在高温还原老化过程中，主要发生的是体相还原，而表面还原作用在较低温度下更为显著。铈含量高的样品在再氧化后显示出增强的还原性，这归因于表面铈3+的分离，形成了铈富集簇。这一分离通过表面铈/（铈+锆）原子比的增加得到了确认。
