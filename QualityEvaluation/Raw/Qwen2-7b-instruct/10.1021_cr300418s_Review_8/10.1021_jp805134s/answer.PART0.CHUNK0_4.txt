1. The DFT+U method demonstrated that both oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption on ceria and doped ceria involve surface reduction processes, indicating that the methane oxidation reaction energy correlates with the surface reducibility.

2. For pure ceria, the calculated vacancy formation energy matched the results from similar studies by Nolan et al. (25, 44).

3. For Zr-doped ceria surfaces, the order of increasing vacancy formation energy is (100) > (111) > (110).

4. Adsorption on surfaces with Pd showed the greatest exothermicity, with CH3 and H attaching to surface oxygen atoms bonded to Pd.

5. The introduction of metals like Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface decreases the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the methane adsorption energy and activation barrier.

1. DFT+U方法表明，Ceria和掺杂Ceria上的氧空位形成和甲烷吸附都是表面还原过程，这意味着甲烷氧化反应能量与表面可还原性相关。

2. 对于纯Ceria，计算得到的氧空位形成能与Nolan等人（25, 44）进行的类似研究的结果相吻合。

3. 对于Zr掺杂的Ceria表面，氧空位形成能随表面类型依次递增：（100）＞（111）＞（110）。

4. 含有Pd的表面显示出最大的吸热性，CH3和H与Pd相连的表面氧原子结合。

5. 在Ceria晶格中引入金属如Zr或Pd到表面，可以降低氧空位形成能，以及甲烷吸附能和活化壁垒。
