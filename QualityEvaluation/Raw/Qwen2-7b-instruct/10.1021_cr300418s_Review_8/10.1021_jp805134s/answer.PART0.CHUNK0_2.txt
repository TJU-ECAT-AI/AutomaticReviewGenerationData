<p>The DFT+U method was used to show that both oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption on ceria and doped ceria are surface reduction processes, and thus the reaction energy for methane oxidation correlates with surface reducibility.</p>
<p>Dissociative methane adsorption proceeds through H abstraction and the formation of a methyl radical transition state in which a metal atom of the surface is reduced by a single electron. The activation barrier for this step, therefore, also correlates with the surface reducibility measured by the oxygen vacancy formation energy.</p>
<p>The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption.</p>
<p>Previous studies (13, 19-21) have illustrated the incorporation of Zr into the fluorite lattice of ceria, however we have neglected to consider the thermodynamic preference of Pd surface substitution, which will be addressed in future studies.</p>

This study highlights the role of dopants like Zr and Pd in influencing the catalytic properties of ceria by affecting surface reducibility. The reduction of ceria surfaces through oxygen vacancy formation and the adsorption of methane are shown to correlate with the activity of ceria-based catalysts. Incorporating Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice enhances the reducibility, lowering the energy barriers for these processes. However, the study does not account for the specific thermodynamic preference of Pd surface substitution, which will be explored in future research.

本研究强调了掺杂剂如Zr和Pd在影响氧化铈催化剂性能方面的作用，通过影响表面还原性。氧化铈表面通过氧空位形成和甲烷吸附的还原过程与活性相关。将Zr或Pd掺入氧化铈晶格中增强了可还原性，降低了这些过程的能量壁垒。然而，研究并未考虑钯表面置换的具体热力学偏好，这将在未来的研究中探讨。
