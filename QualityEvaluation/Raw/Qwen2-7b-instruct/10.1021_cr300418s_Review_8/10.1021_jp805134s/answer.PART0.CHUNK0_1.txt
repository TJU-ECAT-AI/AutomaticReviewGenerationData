[1] "The addition of Zr to CeO2 alters structural and electronic properties of relevance for heterogeneous catalysis, however the impact of Zr addition on surface reducibility and activity is unclear."
[2] "Palladium supported on ceria has shown promise as an effective catalyst for hydrocarbon oxidation, and also displays altered redox properties as compared to pure ceria."
[3] "For the oxidation of CH4 to CO2, microreactor experiments performed by Bozo et. al suggest that Zr doping may increase the thermal stability of ceria by preventing deactivation at high temperatures."
[4] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."
[5] "Previous studies (13, 19-21) have illustrated the incorporation of Zr into the fluorite lattice of ceria, however we have neglected to consider the thermodynamic preference of Pd surface substitution, which will be addressed in future studies."

The introduction of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) into metal oxides, such as ceria, impacts their catalytic properties by altering their structural and electronic characteristics. This modification can enhance or diminish the activity and stability of the catalysts. For instance, Zr doping in ceria affects its reducibility and thermal stability, which in turn influences the catalytic performance for hydrocarbon oxidation. Palladium, when supported on ceria, shows improved catalytic activity for hydrocarbon oxidation compared to pure ceria, suggesting altered redox properties. Zirconium doping in ceria might also contribute to its enhanced thermal stability during the oxidation of methane. However, the precise effects of dopant behavior, including Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), remain challenging to predict in a general manner. Future studies aim to address the thermodynamic preference for surface substitution, particularly with Pd, to better understand and control the catalytic properties of doped ceria.

将同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）引入金属氧化物，如氧化铈，会影响它们的催化性能，通过改变其结构和电子特性。这种修改可以增强或减弱催化剂的活性和稳定性。例如，在氧化铈中掺入锆会改变其可还原性和热稳定性，进而影响烃类氧化的催化性能。钯支持在氧化铈上显示出比纯氧化铈更好的羟基化活性，这表明其红氧化性发生了改变。锆掺杂在氧化铈中可能会增加其在甲烷氧化过程中热稳定的贡献。然而，掺杂剂行为的精确影响，包括Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质（可还原性vs.不可还原性），在一般意义上预测起来仍然具有挑战性。未来的研究旨在解决表面取代的热力学偏好问题，特别是与钯相关的，以更好地理解和控制掺杂氧化铈的催化性能。
