[1] "The DFT+U method was used to show that both oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption on ceria and doped ceria are surface reduction processes, and thus the reaction energy for methane oxidation correlates with surface reducibility."
[2] "For pure ceria, oxygen vacancy formation is most exothermic for the (110) surface, followed by the (100) and then the (111) surface. Vacancy formation on these systems results in the reduction of two surface cerium atoms per vacancy."
[3] "For Zr-doped surfaces, vacancy formation energies proceed in the following order: (100) > (111) > (110). The change in order can be attributed to the specific coordination environment of the (100) surface when Zr is substituted into the surface."
[4] "For Pd-doped surfaces, vacancy formation energies assume the same order as for pure ceria, with the (110) having the most exothermic ΔEvac. In each case, Pd is reduced instead of Ce, as visible in Bader charge and DOS data."
[5] "Methane adsorption is a surface reduction process similar to that of vacancy formation, which suggests that surface reducibility and alkane adsorption thermodynamics are directly correlated."
[6] "Adsorption on surfaces containing Pd was most exothermic with CH3 and H binding to surface oxygen coordinated with Pd."
[7] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."

The study demonstrates that dopants such as Zr and Pd in ceria influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides by affecting the surface reducibility. The introduction of Zr and Pd reduces the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption, suggesting that these dopants enhance the activity for methane activation. The research indicates that the surface reducibility, measured by oxygen vacancy formation energy, correlates with catalytic activity. Furthermore, the study suggests that a fully oxidized surface might provide enhanced activity for methane activation. The challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the complex interactions between dopants and the host oxide, as well as the role of Lewis acid-base interactions. The effects of dopants on the surface structure and electronic properties of metal oxides provide insights into optimizing their performance in various catalytic applications.
