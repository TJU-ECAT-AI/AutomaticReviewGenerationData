[1] "The DFT+U method was used to show that both oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption on ceria and doped ceria are surface reduction processes, and thus the reaction energy for methane oxidation correlates with surface reducibility."
[2] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study indicates that dopants like Zr and Pd reduce the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption on ceria surfaces, thereby enhancing the surface's reactivity and catalytic performance for methane oxidation. This is attributed to the surface reduction processes involved in oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption correlating with the overall catalytic activity.

[1] "For pure ceria, oxygen vacancy formation is most exothermic for the (110) surface, followed by the (100) and then the (111) surface."
[2] "Vacancy formation on these systems results in the reduction of two surface cerium atoms per vacancy."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In pure ceria, oxygen vacancy formation is most energetically favorable on the (110) surface, followed by the (100) and then the (111) surface. This process results in the reduction of two surface cerium atoms per vacancy.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在纯铈氧化物中，氧空位的形成在（110）表面上最有利，其次是（100），然后是（111）。这个过程会导致每个空位减少两个表面铈原子。

[1] "Adsorption on surfaces containing Pd was most exothermic with CH3 and H binding to surface oxygen coordinated with Pd."
[2] "Adsorption is substantially more exothermic than over pure ceria due to the greater reducibility of the Pd-containing surfaces, despite no direct bonding of CH3 or H species with Pd atoms."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
On surfaces containing palladium, the adsorption of CH3 and H to surface oxygen atoms coordinated with palladium was most exothermic. The adsorption on these surfaces is notably more exothermic than on pure ceria surfaces, owing to the higher reducibility of the palladium-containing surfaces, even though there is no direct bonding of CH3 or H species to palladium atoms.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在含钯表面上，CH3和H通过与钯配合的表面氧吸附，吸附最为放热。这些表面的吸附显著比纯铈氧化物更放热，这是由于含钯表面的更高可还原性，尽管CH3或H物种没有直接与钯原子结合。

[1] "The influence of the U value on the energy of the Ce 4f states can be shown by considering the relative energy of the gap state (resulting from partial occupation of Ce 4f states due to reduction), with respect to the CeO2 valence band (ΔEgap)."
[2] "A U value of 5 eV results in a distinct gap state due to the localization of Ce 4f electrons, and lies between the 4 and 7 eV limits, thus further motivating its use in this study."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The effect of the U value on the energy of the Ce 4f states can be demonstrated by examining the gap state's energy relative to the CeO2 valence band (ΔEgap). A U value of 5 eV creates a clear gap state due to the localization of Ce 4f electrons, placing it between the 4 and 7 eV ranges, which justifies its usage in this research.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
U值对铈4f状态能量的影响可以通过观察间隙状态的能量相对于铈氧化物价带（ΔEgap）来展示。5 eV的U值产生了一个清晰的间隙状态，由于铈4f电子的局部化而出现，它位于4和7 eV范围之间，这为本研究提供了进一步的使用理由。

[1] "The addition of Zr to CeO2 alters structural and electronic properties of relevance for heterogeneous catalysis, however the impact of Zr addition on surface reducibility and activity is unclear."
[2] "Palladium supported on ceria has shown promise as an effective catalyst for hydrocarbon oxidation, and also displays altered redox properties as compared to pure ceria."
[3] "For the oxidation of CH4 to CO2, microreactor experiments performed by Bozo et. al suggest that Zr doping may increase the thermal stability of ceria by preventing deactivation at high temperatures."
[4] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."
[5] "Previous studies (13, 19-21) have illustrated the incorporation of Zr into the fluorite lattice of ceria, however we have neglected to consider the thermodynamic preference of Pd surface substitution, which will be addressed in future studies."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The introduction of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) into metal oxides, such as ceria, impacts their catalytic properties by altering their structural and electronic characteristics. This modification can enhance or diminish the activity and stability of the catalysts. For instance, Zr doping in ceria affects its reducibility and thermal stability, which in turn influences the catalytic performance for hydrocarbon oxidation. Palladium, when supported on ceria, shows improved catalytic activity for hydrocarbon oxidation compared to pure ceria, suggesting altered redox properties. Zirconium doping in ceria might also contribute to its enhanced thermal stability during the oxidation of methane. However, the precise effects of dopant behavior, including Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), remain challenging to predict in a general manner. Future studies aim to address the thermodynamic preference for surface substitution, particularly with Pd, to better understand and control the catalytic properties of doped ceria.

将同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）引入金属氧化物，如氧化铈，会影响它们的催化性能，通过改变其结构和电子特性。这种修改可以增强或减弱催化剂的活性和稳定性。例如，在氧化铈中掺入锆会改变其可还原性和热稳定性，进而影响烃类氧化的催化性能。钯支持在氧化铈上显示出比纯氧化铈更好的羟基化活性，这表明其红氧化性发生了改变。锆掺杂在氧化铈中可能会增加其在甲烷氧化过程中热稳定的贡献。然而，掺杂剂行为的精确影响，包括Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质（可还原性vs.不可还原性），在一般意义上预测起来仍然具有挑战性。未来的研究旨在解决表面取代的热力学偏好问题，特别是与钯相关的，以更好地理解和控制掺杂氧化铈的催化性能。

This study highlights the role of dopants like Zr and Pd in influencing the catalytic properties of ceria by affecting surface reducibility. The reduction of ceria surfaces through oxygen vacancy formation and the adsorption of methane are shown to correlate with the activity of ceria-based catalysts. Incorporating Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice enhances the reducibility, lowering the energy barriers for these processes. However, the study does not account for the specific thermodynamic preference of Pd surface substitution, which will be explored in future research.

The study demonstrates that dopants such as Zr and Pd in ceria influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides by affecting the surface reducibility. The introduction of Zr and Pd reduces the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption, suggesting that these dopants enhance the activity for methane activation. The research indicates that the surface reducibility, measured by oxygen vacancy formation energy, correlates with catalytic activity. Furthermore, the study suggests that a fully oxidized surface might provide enhanced activity for methane activation. The challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the complex interactions between dopants and the host oxide, as well as the role of Lewis acid-base interactions. The effects of dopants on the surface structure and electronic properties of metal oxides provide insights into optimizing their performance in various catalytic applications.
