1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) have been shown to significantly influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, affecting their performance in various applications. Computational and experimental studies have revealed that these dopants can alter the activity of metal oxides. However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior is challenging due to the complex interactions between dopants and the host oxide. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide are critical in determining dopant behavior.
