The document discusses the influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. Computational and experimental studies have provided insights into how these dopants affect the performance of metal oxides in various catalytic applications. However, challenges remain in creating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, taking into account factors like Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (whether it is reducible or irreducible).

本文讨论了同价掺杂剂(SVD)和高价掺杂剂(HVD)对不同金属氧化物催化性质的影响。通过计算和实验方法，已经获得了这些掺杂剂在各种催化应用中的性能影响的见解。然而，仍然存在制定一般预测规则的挑战，这需要考虑到诸如Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质（可还原性还是不可还原性）等因素。
