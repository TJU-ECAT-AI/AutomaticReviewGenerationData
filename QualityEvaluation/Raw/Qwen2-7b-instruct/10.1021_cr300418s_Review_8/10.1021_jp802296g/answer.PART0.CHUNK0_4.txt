[1] "Doping is not always beneficial. Ceria doped with Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta has lower activity toward n-butane oxidation (47) than ceria alone, and doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb slows down CO oxidation."
[2] "We find that in the presence of O, V, Cr, Mo, and W dopants at the surface bind an oxygen atom so that the dopant has formula MO (M = V, Cr, Mo, W)."
[3] "The only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another are the energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
[4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
[5] "We have found that in the presence of gas phase oxygen all dopants, except Mn, bind an oxygen atom; therefore, the dopant is a MO group (M = V, Cr, Mo, or W)."
[6] "The energy of vacancy formation is useful in characterizing the reaction of CO with the surface oxygen atoms."
[7] "The three energies that change from one catalyst to another (the CO reaction with surface oxygen, the O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and the energy of vacancy formation) are related by two linear relations."
[8] "Qualitatively, a plot of activity versus ΔEv2 will be a volcano curve."

1. Not all doping has positive effects. Ceria doped with certain elements reduces its activity in n-butane oxidation, and doping ceria with specific elements decreases CO oxidation speed.

2. V, Cr, Mo, and W dopants bind an oxygen atom on the surface, resulting in a MO structure (M = V, Cr, Mo, W).

3. The energy of CO reacting with an oxygen atom and the energy of O2 adsorption at a vacancy vary linearly with the energy of vacancy formation (ΔEv).

4. Reactions requiring spin flipping are not considered in the catalytic process.

5. Except for manganese, all dopants bind an oxygen atom in the presence of gas phase oxygen, forming a MO group.

6. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation helps characterize the reaction of CO with surface oxygen atoms.

7. The energies of CO reaction with surface oxygen, O2 adsorption at a vacancy, and oxygen vacancy formation are related linearly in different catalysts.

8. A volcano curve can qualitatively represent the relationship between activity and ΔEv2.

1. 并非所有掺杂都有积极作用。特定元素掺杂的铈降低了其在丁烷氧化中的活性，而某些铈的掺杂降低了CO氧化速度。

2. V、Cr、Mo和W掺杂剂在表面结合氧原子，形成MO结构（M = V、Cr、Mo、W）。

3. CO与表面氧原子反应的能量和吸附于空位的O2能量随空位形成能（ΔEv）线性变化。

4. 需要翻转自旋的反应被认为催化作用太慢而不考虑。

5. 除了锰外，在气体相氧存在下，所有掺杂剂都在表面结合一个氧原子，形成MO组分。

6. 在气体相氧存在下，除了锰以外，所有掺杂剂都结合一个氧原子，形成MO结构。

7. 空位形成能有助于表征CO与表面氧原子的反应。

8. 活动与ΔEv2的关系可以用火山曲线定量表示。
