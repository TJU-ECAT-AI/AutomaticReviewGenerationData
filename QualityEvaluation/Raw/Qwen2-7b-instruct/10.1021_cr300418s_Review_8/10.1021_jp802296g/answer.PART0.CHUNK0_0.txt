<p>There are indications, from theory and experiment, that substitutionally doped oxides might be a class of interesting partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.</p>
<p>The explicit idea of using doped oxides (or mixed oxides as they were called in the older literature) seems to go back to Cimino and co-workers, (1, 2) who showed that NixMg1xO is more active for N2O decomposition than NiO.</p>
<p>More important to us are papers that set out to prepare doped oxides to use as catalysts or to make the host oxide a better oxidant. (1, 2, 13-44) Most among these papers found that doping lowers the temperature at which the oxide is reduced by CO or H2. Those who studied a catalytic reaction found that doping improves the catalytic activity of the host oxide.</p>
<p>Our calculations find that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in (MO)xTi1xO2 (110) with M = V, W, Cr, or Moand in MnxTi1xO2 (110) is smaller than in TiO2 (110).</p>
<p>This kind of correlation is not quantitative, but it may serve as a rough guide when trying to figure out which dopant is more likely to ease vacancy formation for a given host oxide.</p>
<p>We find that in the presence of O, V, Cr, Mo, and W dopants at the surface bind an oxygen atom so that the dopant has formula MO (M = V, Cr, Mo, W).</p>
<p>In the case of (CrO)xTi1xO2 (110), (WO)xTi1xO2 (110), and (MoO)xTi1xO2 (110), the surface recovers its composition after the fifth reaction, but the spin state is different from the one it had before reacting with CO.</p>
<p>Qualitatively, a plot of activity versus ΔEv2 will be a volcano curve.</p>
<p>Therefore, any one of these three quantities can be used as a descriptor. They can be all computed with about the same difficulty.</p>
<p>Although we have not calculated activation barriers, we can attempt to guess them from the reaction energies by using the BronstedEvansPolany (BEP) (94, 95) relationship.</p>

1. Doped oxides, particularly those with substitutional doping, are being explored as catalysts for partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Studies indicate that doping can improve the catalytic activity of the host oxide, lowering the temperature at which it is reduced by CO or H2.

2. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation in doped oxides is lower compared to undoped TiO2, suggesting that these materials are better oxidants and potential catalysts.

3. The energy of vacancy formation is not a direct indicator of the catalytic activity, as other factors such as the reactivity of surface oxygen and the ability of the vacancy to adsorb O2 also play crucial roles.

4. The energy of CO adsorption, the energy of O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and the energy of vacancy formation are interrelated and can be used as descriptors for catalytic activity.

5. The energy of CO2 desorption and the energy of the reaction of CO with the adsorbed oxygen do not vary with the catalyst, indicating that differences in catalytic activity are determined by the surface oxygen reactivity and the ability of the vacancy to adsorb O2.

6. The computational study predicts that (VO)xTi1xO2 (110) is likely to be the fastest oxidant, while (CrO)xTi1xO2 (110), (VO)xTi1xO2 (110), and MnxTi1xO2 (110) could be better CO oxidation catalysts than (WO)xTi1xO2 (110) and (MoO)xTi1xO2 (110).

7. The authors suggest that a volcano curve can represent the relationship between activity and ΔEv2, highlighting the importance of finding an optimal value of ΔEv2 for maximizing catalytic efficiency.

8. The computational approach offers a qualitative tool to predict which systems are likely to be useful catalysts, despite limitations in accurately describing certain physical properties of the materials.

1. 替换掺杂的氧化物，特别是具有置换掺杂的氧化物，正在被探索作为部分氧化和氧化脱氢反应的催化剂。研究表明，掺杂可以提高宿主氧化物的催化活性，降低其由CO或H2还原的温度。

2. 掺杂氧化物中的氧空位形成能低于未掺杂的TiO2，这表明这些材料是更好的氧化剂，并且可能是潜在的催化剂。

3. 氧空位形成能不是催化活性的直接指标，因为表面氧的反应性和氧空位吸附O2的能力也是决定性因素。

4. CO吸附的能量、O2在氧空位处的吸附能量以及氧空位形成的能量之间的相互关联，可以用作描述催化活性的指标。

5. CO2脱附的能量和CO与吸附氧的反应能量不随催化剂而变，表明催化剂差异是由表面氧的反应性和氧空位吸附O2的能力决定的。

6. 计算研究表明，(VO)xTi1xO2 (110)可能是最快的氧化剂，而(CrO)xTi1xO2 (110)、(VO)xTi1xO2 (110)和MnxTi1xO2 (110)可能是比(WO)xTi1xO2 (110)和(MoO)xTi1xO2 (110)更好的CO氧化催化剂。

7. 作者建议，火山曲线可以表示活动性和ΔEv2之间的关系，强调找到最大化催化效率的最佳ΔEv2的重要性。

8. 计算方法提供了一种定量工具来预测哪些体系可能成为有用的催化剂，尽管在准确描述某些材料物理性质方面存在局限性。
