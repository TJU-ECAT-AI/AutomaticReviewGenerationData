<p>Because we are interested in using these doped oxides as oxidation catalysts, we need to know their structure in the presence of gas-phase oxygen. We found that at all reasonable oxygen pressures and temperatures V, Cr, Mo, and W will bind an oxygen atom from gas phase to form a compound that we denote by (MO)xTi1xO2 (110), with M = Cr, Mo, W, or V.</p>
<p>The most stable tungsten oxide is WO3, but rutile WO2 is also formed. The energy of formation of WO2 is so close to that of TiO2 that, within the errors of experiment and DFT, the replacement of a Ti atom with a W atom does not change the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy.</p>
<p>This kind of correlation is not quantitative, but it may serve as a rough guide when trying to figure out which dopant is more likely to ease vacancy formation for a given host oxide.</p>
<p>We have studied the energetics of the catalytic cycle for CO oxidation by rutile TiO2 (110) doped with V, Cr, Mo, W, and Mn. Our calculations found that in the presence of gas phase oxygen all dopants, except Mn, bind an oxygen atom; therefore, the dopant is a MO group (M = V, Cr, Mo, or W).</p>
<p>We have found that doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged. The energy of vacancy formation is lowered even more when V, Cr, W, or Mo bind an oxygen atom to form a MO group (which replaces a Ti atom at the surface of the oxide).</p>
<p>On the basis of the energies of various possible intermediates we propose the following reaction mechanism. (1) Because the dopants lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the doped surface reacts more readily with CO, than the undoped one, to make a carbonate or a CO2 molecule (for Mn dopant). (2) This decomposes to form CO2 and leave behind an oxygen vacancy. (3) Oxygen from the gas phase is adsorbed at the vacancy site, and the OO bond is weakened. (4) CO from gas phase reacts with the adsorbed oxygen to form a carbonate. (5) This easily decomposes to release CO2, heal the oxygen vacancy, and restore the surface to its initial composition but not necessarily to its initial spin state.</p>
<p>When we calculated the energy of various intermediate reactions we have taken into account the total electronic spin state of the reactants and products. We included into the reaction mechanism only reactions in which the total electronic spin is conserved.</p>

1. V, Cr, Mo, and W bind an oxygen atom from gas phase to form a compound (MO)xTi1xO2 (110) when present in metal oxides.
2. Replacing Ti with W in the oxide does not significantly affect the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.
3. Doping with V, Cr, Mo, or Mn lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.
4. The reaction mechanism for CO oxidation includes making a carbonate or CO2 molecule, decomposing it to form CO2 and an oxygen vacancy, adsorbing oxygen at the vacancy site, reacting CO with the adsorbed oxygen to form a carbonate, and finally decomposing the carbonate to release CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy.
5. The energy of various intermediate reactions was calculated while considering the total electronic spin state of the reactants and products.

1.V、Cr、Mo和W会在金属氧化物中与气体中的氧原子结合形成化合物（MO)xTi1xO2 (110)。
2.用W替换Ti在氧化物中不会显著影响氧空位形成的能量。
3.用V、Cr、Mo或Mn进行掺杂会降低氧空位形成能。
4.CO氧化的反应机制包括生成碳酸盐或CO2分子，分解成CO2和一个氧空位，将氧气吸附到空位位置，用CO与吸附的氧气形成碳酸盐，最后分解碳酸盐释放CO2并修复氧空位。
5.在计算各种中间反应的能量时考虑了反应物和产物的总电子自旋状态。
