<p>There are indications, from theory and experiment, that substitutionally doped oxides might be a class of interesting partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.</p>
<p>The explicit idea of using doped oxides (or mixed oxides as they were called in the older literature) seems to go back to Cimino and co-workers, (1, 2) who showed that NixMg1xO is more active for N2O decomposition than NiO.</p>
<p>More important to us are papers that set out to prepare doped oxides to use as catalysts or to make the host oxide a better oxidant. (1, 2, 13-44) Most among these papers found that doping lowers the temperature at which the oxide is reduced by CO or H2. Those who studied a catalytic reaction found that doping improves the catalytic activity of the host oxide.</p>
<p>Our calculations find that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in (MO)xTi1xO2 (110) with M = V, W, Cr, or Moand in MnxTi1xO2 (110) is smaller than in TiO2 (110).</p>
<p>This kind of correlation is not quantitative, but it may serve as a rough guide when trying to figure out which dopant is more likely to ease vacancy formation for a given host oxide.</p>
<p>We find that in the presence of O, V, Cr, Mo, and W dopants at the surface bind an oxygen atom so that the dopant has formula MO (M = V, Cr, Mo, W).</p>
<p>In the case of (CrO)xTi1xO2 (110), (WO)xTi1xO2 (110), and (MoO)xTi1xO2 (110), the surface recovers its composition after the fifth reaction, but the spin state is different from the one it had before reacting with CO.</p>
<p>Qualitatively, a plot of activity versus ΔEv2 will be a volcano curve.</p>
<p>Therefore, any one of these three quantities can be used as a descriptor. They can be all computed with about the same difficulty.</p>
<p>Although we have not calculated activation barriers, we can attempt to guess them from the reaction energies by using the BronstedEvansPolany (BEP) (94, 95) relationship.</p>

1. Doped oxides, particularly those with substitutional doping, are being explored as catalysts for partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Studies indicate that doping can improve the catalytic activity of the host oxide, lowering the temperature at which it is reduced by CO or H2.

2. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation in doped oxides is lower compared to undoped TiO2, suggesting that these materials are better oxidants and potential catalysts.

3. The energy of vacancy formation is not a direct indicator of the catalytic activity, as other factors such as the reactivity of surface oxygen and the ability of the vacancy to adsorb O2 also play crucial roles.

4. The energy of CO adsorption, the energy of O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and the energy of vacancy formation are interrelated and can be used as descriptors for catalytic activity.

5. The energy of CO2 desorption and the energy of the reaction of CO with the adsorbed oxygen do not vary with the catalyst, indicating that differences in catalytic activity are determined by the surface oxygen reactivity and the ability of the vacancy to adsorb O2.

6. The computational study predicts that (VO)xTi1xO2 (110) is likely to be the fastest oxidant, while (CrO)xTi1xO2 (110), (VO)xTi1xO2 (110), and MnxTi1xO2 (110) could be better CO oxidation catalysts than (WO)xTi1xO2 (110) and (MoO)xTi1xO2 (110).

7. The authors suggest that a volcano curve can represent the relationship between activity and ΔEv2, highlighting the importance of finding an optimal value of ΔEv2 for maximizing catalytic efficiency.

8. The computational approach offers a qualitative tool to predict which systems are likely to be useful catalysts, despite limitations in accurately describing certain physical properties of the materials.

5. CO2脱附的能量和CO与吸附氧的反应能量不随催化剂而变，表明催化剂差异是由表面氧的反应性和氧空位吸附O2的能力决定的。

6. 计算研究表明，(VO)xTi1xO2 (110)可能是最快的氧化剂，而(CrO)xTi1xO2 (110)、(VO)xTi1xO2 (110)和MnxTi1xO2 (110)可能是比(WO)xTi1xO2 (110)和(MoO)xTi1xO2 (110)更好的CO氧化催化剂。

7. 作者建议，火山曲线可以表示活动性和ΔEv2之间的关系，强调找到最大化催化效率的最佳ΔEv2的重要性。

1. The study employed density functional theory to investigate the catalytic properties of CO oxidation on rutile TiO2(110) surfaces doped with V, W, Cr, Mo, and Mn. The dopants at the surface bind an oxygen atom, forming MO compounds (where M is V, Cr, Mo, or W). This behavior is similar to that observed on AuxTi1xO2(110) surfaces.

2. The doping of ceria with certain elements, like Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta, decreases its activity in n-butane oxidation compared to undoped ceria. Similarly, doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb affects CO oxidation negatively.

3. On (VO)xTi1xO2(110), the VO group facilitates CO oxidation by weakening the bonds of the oxygen atoms at specific positions (b1 and b2) to the oxide surface.

4. No correlation was found between the Bader charges on atoms in reaction intermediates and their chemical activity. 

5. The similarity between CO oxidation on (VO)xTi1xO2(110) and AuxTi1xO2(110) surfaces lies in the assistance of the dopant in weakening the bonds of oxygen atoms to the oxide surface.

6. The energy of vacancy formation ΔEv2 influences the catalytic properties of the oxide. Catalysts effective for CO oxidation are anticipated to perform well in other oxidation reactions where a reactant takes one oxygen atom from the surface.

1. 我们使用密度泛函理论研究了在表面替换了一些Ti原子的TiO2(110)上CO氧化催化作用，这些Ti原子被V、Cr、Mo、W或Mn取代。这些掺杂剂在表面结合了一个氧原子，形成了MO化合物（M为V、Cr、Mo或W）。这种行为类似于在AuxTi1xO2(110)表面上观察到的行为。

2. 在Sm、Gd、La、Nb和Ta等元素掺杂的铈中，其对丁烷氧化的活性低于未掺杂的铈。类似地，La、Pr、Gd或Nb的铈掺杂会减慢CO的氧化速率。

3. 对于(VO)xTi1xO2(110)，VO组在CO氧化过程中通过削弱特定位置（b1和b2）的氧原子与氧化物表面的键，辅助CO氧化。

4. 没有在反应中间体中的原子电荷量与其化学活性之间发现相关性。

5. (VO)xTi1xO2(110)和AuxTi1xO2(110)表面之间的相似之处在于助剂通过削弱氧原子与氧化物表面的键来辅助CO氧化。

1. The study investigated the influence of doping on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, specifically focusing on the role of dopants in facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies during CO oxidation. High-valence dopants were found to decrease the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the catalytic activity of the doped oxides compared to undoped ones.

2. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) impact the catalytic performance of metal oxides by altering the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, which affects the efficiency of the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in CO oxidation. The study provided insights into the specific roles of various dopants in the catalytic cycle, including CO adsorption, CO2 desorption, and O2 adsorption at the vacancy site.

3. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in metal oxides stem from the complexity of interactions between dopants, host oxides, and the catalytic mechanism. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide can significantly influence the effectiveness of dopants. The study highlighted the importance of considering these factors in predicting the performance of doped oxides in catalytic applications.

4. Insights gained from computational and experimental studies on dopant behavior in metal oxides can contribute to developing more efficient catalysts for various oxidation reactions, such as SO2 oxidation to SO3. The findings suggest that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation can serve as a descriptor for evaluating the catalytic activity of doped oxides in Marsvan Krevelen-type mechanisms.

5. The energy of CO adsorption on the surface, the energy of O2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy site, and the energy of oxygen vacancy formation are key factors in determining the catalytic activity of doped oxides. These quantities are interrelated and can be used to assess the performance of different doped oxides in CO oxidation.

6. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior due to the intricate interplay between dopant valence, Lewis acidity/basicity, and the specific properties of the host oxide. The study demonstrated that computational methods can provide valuable insights into the catalytic properties of doped oxides, but a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is still needed to develop universally applicable guidelines.

<p>Because we are interested in using these doped oxides as oxidation catalysts, we need to know their structure in the presence of gas-phase oxygen. We found that at all reasonable oxygen pressures and temperatures V, Cr, Mo, and W will bind an oxygen atom from gas phase to form a compound that we denote by (MO)xTi1xO2 (110), with M = Cr, Mo, W, or V.</p>
<p>The most stable tungsten oxide is WO3, but rutile WO2 is also formed. The energy of formation of WO2 is so close to that of TiO2 that, within the errors of experiment and DFT, the replacement of a Ti atom with a W atom does not change the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy.</p>
<p>This kind of correlation is not quantitative, but it may serve as a rough guide when trying to figure out which dopant is more likely to ease vacancy formation for a given host oxide.</p>
<p>We have studied the energetics of the catalytic cycle for CO oxidation by rutile TiO2 (110) doped with V, Cr, Mo, W, and Mn. Our calculations found that in the presence of gas phase oxygen all dopants, except Mn, bind an oxygen atom; therefore, the dopant is a MO group (M = V, Cr, Mo, or W).</p>
<p>We have found that doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged. The energy of vacancy formation is lowered even more when V, Cr, W, or Mo bind an oxygen atom to form a MO group (which replaces a Ti atom at the surface of the oxide).</p>
<p>On the basis of the energies of various possible intermediates we propose the following reaction mechanism. (1) Because the dopants lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the doped surface reacts more readily with CO, than the undoped one, to make a carbonate or a CO2 molecule (for Mn dopant). (2) This decomposes to form CO2 and leave behind an oxygen vacancy. (3) Oxygen from the gas phase is adsorbed at the vacancy site, and the OO bond is weakened. (4) CO from gas phase reacts with the adsorbed oxygen to form a carbonate. (5) This easily decomposes to release CO2, heal the oxygen vacancy, and restore the surface to its initial composition but not necessarily to its initial spin state.</p>
<p>When we calculated the energy of various intermediate reactions we have taken into account the total electronic spin state of the reactants and products. We included into the reaction mechanism only reactions in which the total electronic spin is conserved.</p>
