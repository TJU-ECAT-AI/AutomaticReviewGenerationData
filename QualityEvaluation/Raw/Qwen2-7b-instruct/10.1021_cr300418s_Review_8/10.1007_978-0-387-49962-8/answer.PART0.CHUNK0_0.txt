Since there are no specific quotes addressing the questions about how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, the insights gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications, and the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, there is no direct answer within the provided literature. However, based on general knowledge, it is known that dopants can alter the electronic structure and surface chemistry of metal oxides, impacting their catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Challenges often involve understanding the complex interplay between dopant chemistry and the host oxide, as well as predicting the behavior of dopants under various reaction conditions.

由于提供的文献中没有针对同价掺杂剂(SVD)和高价掺杂剂(HVD)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性质、从计算和实验研究中获得的关于它们在各种催化应用中的性能影响的见解，以及制定通用的掺杂剂行为预测规则所面临的挑战的具体引用，因此无法直接回答问题。然而，根据一般知识，掺杂剂可以改变金属氧化物的电子结构和表面化学特性，从而影响其催化活性、选择性和稳定性。挑战通常涉及理解掺杂剂化学与基质氧化物之间的复杂相互作用，以及在各种反应条件下预测掺杂剂行为的难度。
