Catalysis significantly influences the manufacturing process of various products, including gasoline, plastics, fertilizers, and herbicides, making them accessible or affordable. It is a crucial component in the production of almost every chemical- or oil-based material item in modern society. Moreover, catalysis is increasingly being utilized for environmental control purposes, such as pollution management. Over time, the field has seen advancements leading to a substantial increase in research publications and a deeper understanding of catalytic phenomena. However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in metal oxides remains challenging due to factors like Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). The impact of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides varies significantly, necessitating further investigation and experimentation to address these complexities.

催化作用在汽油、塑料、化肥和除草剂等产品的制造过程中起着至关重要的作用，使其变得可获取或经济实惠。几乎所有现代社会的化学或石油基材料项目都依赖于催化阶段。此外，催化正被越来越多地用于环境控制领域，如污染治理。多年来，研究活动带来了更深层次的理解，并伴随着大量出版物的增加。然而，由于Lewis酸碱相互作用等因素以及宿氧化合物（可还原性与不可还原性）的性质，形成一般预测规则来描述掺杂行为仍然具有挑战性。同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物的催化性质的影响存在显著差异，需要进一步的研究和实验来解决这些复杂性。
