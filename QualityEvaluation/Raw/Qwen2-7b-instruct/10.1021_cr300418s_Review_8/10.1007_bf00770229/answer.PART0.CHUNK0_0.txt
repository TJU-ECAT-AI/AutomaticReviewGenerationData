The introduction of carbon tetrachloride to the feed stream in the conversion of methane to C hydrocarbons over a variety of silica-supported oxides is shown to alter both the conversion and selectivity, but, notably with oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn produces remarkable increases in the yield and selectivity to C2H4 and C2H6, particularly the former.

In the light of these positive effects of a chloroadditive on the partial oxidation of methane as observed with heteropoly oxometalates in this laboratory we have undertaken an extensive study of the effect of these chlorocompounds on the direct oxidative coupling of methane to higher hydrocarbons using a variety of catalytic materials.

Over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction. Over Cs, however, this increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is not maintained with further process time. On Ba/SiO2 a large increase in the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbon in the initial periods of reaction is observed as well.

It is difficult therefore to separate the heterogeneous from the homogeneous involvement in the enrichment of C2H4 to C2H6 ratio in the presence of CC14. In fact, at high temperatures, chlorine radicals have been shown to catalyze formations of C2H4 from CH4 in the gas phase.

The introduction of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) to the feed stream enhances the oxidative coupling of methane on various silica-supported oxides, notably increasing the yield and selectivity to ethane (C2H4) and ethene (C2H6), particularly for oxides of barium (Ba), cesium (Cs), and manganese (Mn). The enhancement is most pronounced with Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2, and Mn/SiO2, leading to significant increases in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons and selectivity to these products. The selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons increases notably during the initial stages of reaction over Ba/SiO2. However, the increase in yield of C2 hydrocarbons does not persist over Cs/SiO2 with further process time. High temperatures seem to facilitate the formation of C2H4 from CH4 through the catalytic action of chlorine radicals supplied by CC14, indicating a role for both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions in the enrichment of C2H4 to C2H6 ratio in the presence of CC14.

碳四氯化物（CCl4）引入到反应流中，显著提高了甲烷在各种硅基氧化物上的氧化耦合反应效率，特别是对于钡（Ba）、铯（Cs）和锰（Mn）的氧化物，提高了乙烯（C2H4）和乙烷（C2H6）的产率和选择性，尤其是Ba/SiO2、Cs/SiO2和Mn/SiO2。Ba/SiO2、Cs/SiO2和Mn/SiO2对C2烃的产率提升尤为明显。Ba/SiO2上，C2烃的选择性在反应初期有显著增加。然而，Cs/SiO2上，随着反应时间的延长，C2烃产率的增加并未持续。高温条件下，氯化物似乎通过CC14提供的氯原子催化了CH4转化为C2H4的过程，这表明CC14在提高C2H4与C2H6比值中的作用既有异相反应也有均相反应的参与。
