[1] "In the present communication the result of the addition of a small quantity of tetrachloromethane to the feed on the oxidative dimerization reaction with a number of silica supported metal oxides is reported."
[2] "The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CC14 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."
[3] "For example, in addition to oxides which facilitate the coupling reaction, there are some oxides such as Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO2 which appear to have little effect on the oxidation process and some such as Pb/SiO2, and Ti/SiO2 with which the addition of CC14 strongly inhibits the reaction."
[4] "Over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction. Over Cs, however, this increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is not maintained with further process time."

The document discusses how the addition of tetrachloromethane (CC14) to the feed stream can enhance the oxidative coupling of methane on certain silica-supported metal oxides, specifically Ba, Cs, and Mn oxides. The addition of CC14 leads to significant increases in the yield and selectivity of C2 hydrocarbons. The enhancement is observed to depend on the type of oxide used; some oxides, like Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO2, have little effect, while others, such as Pb/SiO2 and Ti/SiO2, see strong inhibition of the reaction when CC14 is added. The yields of C2 hydrocarbons increase initially but are not sustained over longer reaction times on Cs/SiO2.

文档讨论了向甲烷氧化耦合反应中添加少量四氯化碳（CC14）到进料流中如何增强Ba、Cs和Mn在硅基质上的金属氧化物的催化性能。向这些氧化物中添加CC14可以显著增加C2烃类的产率和选择性。增强效果取决于所用氧化物的类型；某些氧化物，如Ni/SiO2、Cd/SiO2和Zn/SiO2，几乎没有影响，而其他氧化物，如Pb/SiO2和Ti/SiO2，在添加CC14时显示出强烈的抑制作用。在Cs/SiO2上，C2烃类的产率最初会增加，但不会持续更长时间的反应过程。
