[1] "In the present communication the result of the addition of a small quantity of tetrachloromethane to the feed on the oxidative dimerization reaction with a number of silica supported metal oxides is reported."
[2] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."
[3] "For example, in addition to oxides which facilitate the coupling reaction, there are some oxides such as Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO 2 which appear to have little effect on the oxidation process and some such as Pb/SiO 2, and T1/SiO 2 with which the addition of CCl 4 strongly inhibits the reaction."
[4] "Over Ba/SiO 2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C 2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction."
[5] "On Ba/SiO 2 a large increase in the selectivity to C 2 hydrocarbon in the initial periods of reaction is observed as well."
[6] "It is reasonable to suspect that CC14 is modifying the oxide surface in a number of ways."
[7] "The fact that an increase in oxygen concentration increases the ratio of C2H 4 to C2H 6 appears to indicate as suggested by others in the absence of CCI 4 [5,10,19], that C2H 6 is the primary C 2 product and C2H 4 is produced by the subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6."
[8] "In fact, at high temperatures, chlorine radicals have been shown to catalyze formations of C2H 4 from CH 4 in the gas phase [20,21]."
[9] "The low selectivity of CH3C1 is not surprising in view of the high temperature used."
[10] "Nevertheless, in view of the remarkable increase observed both in the yield and selectivity of dimerized product, it is believed that further studies will provide valuable practical and mechanistic information on the conversion process and the nature of the additive effect."

The literature discusses how the addition of tetrachloromethane to the feed stream enhances the oxidative coupling of methane on oxide/silica catalysts, particularly for oxides of barium (Ba), cesium (Cs), and manganese (Mn). The effects vary depending on the type of catalyst, with some showing little impact and others experiencing strong inhibition when exposed to the additive. The presence of tetrachloromethane leads to an increase in the yield and selectivity of C2 hydrocarbons, especially ethylene, during the initial stages of the reaction. Computational and experimental studies suggest that the additive modifies the oxide surface in multiple ways, potentially altering its Lewis acid-base interactions and influencing its reducibility or irreducibility. While the yields and selectivities are not as high as those reported for some alkali-promoted alkaline earth and rare earth oxides, the significant increase in the production of dimerized products indicates potential for valuable practical and mechanistic insights into the conversion process and the role of the additive.

文献讨论了向反应流中添加四氯化碳如何增强氧化甲烷耦合在氧化物/硅酸盐催化剂上的催化性能，特别是在钡（Ba）、铯（Cs）和锰（Mn）的氧化物上。不同类型的催化剂对添加剂的影响各不相同，有些几乎没有影响，而有些则在暴露于添加剂时表现出强烈的抑制作用。当加入四氯化碳时，可以观察到C2烃类产物的产率和选择性显著增加，尤其是在反应的初期阶段，特别是乙烷和乙烯的选择性增加尤为明显。计算和实验研究表明，该添加剂通过多种方式改变了氧化物表面，可能影响其Lewis酸碱相互作用和其可还原性或不可还原性。虽然得到的产率和选择性不如一些碱土金属促进的碱金属和稀有土金属氧化物高，但观察到的双聚产物产率的显著增加表明有可能为转化过程和添加剂的作用提供有价值的实践和机制信息。
