[1] "The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CC14 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."
[2] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."
[3] "The observed effects may, among others,depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CC14, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CC14 and form Cl atoms or radicals."
[4] "It is difficult therefore to separate the heterogeneous from the homogeneous involvement in the enrichment of C2H4 to C2H6 ratio in the presence of CC14."

The document discusses how the introduction of a small amount of chloromethane (CC14) to the feed stream can dramatically enhance the formation of C2 hydrocarbons during the oxidative coupling of methane. This enhancement occurs specifically with the oxides of barium (Ba), cesium (Cs), and manganese (Mn) supported on silica. The document also mentions that the impact of CC14 on the oxidation process varies depending on the nature of the oxide used. It suggests that CC14 alters the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface, incorporating or retaining chlorine within the oxide, forming metal-chlorine bonds, and enabling the decomposition of CC14 to produce chlorine atoms or radicals. However, distinguishing between the heterogeneous and homogeneous roles in increasing the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 in the presence of CC14 is challenging due to the complex interactions involved.

文档讨论了将少量氯甲烷（CC14）引入反应流中如何显著增强甲烷氧化耦合过程中的C2烃类化合物生成。这种增强特别发生在钡（Ba）、铯（Cs）和锰（Mn）的氧化物支持在硅胶上时。文档还提到，CC14对氧化过程的影响取决于所使用的氧化物的性质。它表明，CC14改变了氧化物表面的酸性和/或碱性，可能在氧化物内或保留氯原子，形成金属-氯键，以及使CC14分解产生氯原子或自由基。然而，在CC14存在的条件下，区分异相和均相参与增加C2H4与C2H6比例的复杂性，由于涉及的相互作用较为复杂。
