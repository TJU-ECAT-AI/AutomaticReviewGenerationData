Catalysis Letters 2 (1989) 309-318

The introduction of carbon tetrachloride to the feed stream in the conversion of methane to C hydrocarbons over a variety of silica-supported oxides is shown to alter both the conversion and selectivity, but, notably with oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn produces remarkable increases in the yield and selectivity to C2H4 and C2H6, particularly the former.

In the light of these positive effects of a chloroadditive on the partial oxidation of methane as observed with heteropoly oxometalates in this laboratory we have undertaken an extensive study of the effect of these chlorocompounds on the direct oxidative coupling of methane to higher hydrocarbons using a variety of catalytic materials.

Over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction. Over Cs, however, this increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is not maintained with further process time. On Ba/SiO2 a large increase in the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbon in the initial periods of reaction is observed as well.

It is difficult therefore to separate the heterogeneous from the homogeneous involvement in the enrichment of C2H4 to C2H6 ratio in the presence of CC14. In fact, at high temperatures, chlorine radicals have been shown to catalyze formations of C2H4 from CH4 in the gas phase.

The introduction of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) to the feed stream enhances the oxidative coupling of methane on various silica-supported oxides, notably increasing the yield and selectivity to ethane (C2H4) and ethene (C2H6), particularly for oxides of barium (Ba), cesium (Cs), and manganese (Mn). The enhancement is most pronounced with Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2, and Mn/SiO2, leading to significant increases in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons and selectivity to these products. The selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons increases notably during the initial stages of reaction over Ba/SiO2. However, the increase in yield of C2 hydrocarbons does not persist over Cs/SiO2 with further process time. High temperatures seem to facilitate the formation of C2H4 from CH4 through the catalytic action of chlorine radicals supplied by CC14, indicating a role for both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions in the enrichment of C2H4 to C2H6 ratio in the presence of CC14.

碳四氯化物（CCl4）引入到反应流中，显著提高了甲烷在各种硅基氧化物上的氧化耦合反应效率，特别是对于钡（Ba）、铯（Cs）和锰（Mn）的氧化物，提高了乙烯（C2H4）和乙烷（C2H6）的产率和选择性，尤其是Ba/SiO2、Cs/SiO2和Mn/SiO2。Ba/SiO2、Cs/SiO2和Mn/SiO2对C2烃的产率提升尤为明显。Ba/SiO2上，C2烃的选择性在反应初期有显著增加。然而，Cs/SiO2上，随着反应时间的延长，C2烃产率的增加并未持续。高温条件下，氯化物似乎通过CC14提供的氯原子催化了CH4转化为C2H4的过程，这表明CC14在提高C2H4与C2H6比值中的作用既有异相反应也有均相反应的参与。

The document discusses how the addition of tetrachloromethane (CC14) to the feed stream can enhance the oxidative coupling of methane on certain silica-supported metal oxides, specifically Ba, Cs, and Mn oxides. The addition of CC14 leads to significant increases in the yield and selectivity of C2 hydrocarbons. The enhancement is observed to depend on the type of oxide used; some oxides, like Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO2, have little effect, while others, such as Pb/SiO2 and Ti/SiO2, see strong inhibition of the reaction when CC14 is added. The yields of C2 hydrocarbons increase initially but are not sustained over longer reaction times on Cs/SiO2.

1. In the recent studies on methane conversion by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, the addition of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream significantly influenced the conversion of methane and the selectivities to different products.

2. The yield of C2 hydrocarbons increased substantially within the first hours of reaction over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2.

3. The presence of chloromethanes had varied effects depending on the type of oxide used. Some facilitated the coupling reaction, while others like Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO2 had little impact. Conversely, Pb/SiO2 and T1/SiO2 showed strong inhibition of the reaction when exposed to chloromethanes.

4. It's challenging to distinguish between the heterogeneous and homogeneous components contributing to the enhancement of the C2H4 to C2H6 ratio when chloromethanes are present in the feed.

5. Halogen radicals from chloromethanes likely catalyzed the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, given the observed high ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 in the presence of chloromethanes.

1. 在对硝酸氧化硅支持的杂多酸氧化物进行的最近研究中，向流体中添加二氯甲烷或四氯化碳显著影响了甲烷的转化和不同产物的选择性。

2. 在最初的几个小时内，Ba/SiO2和Cs/SiO2上产生的C2氢化合物的产率有了显著增加。

4. 当氯甲烷存在于流体中时，区分异相和均相成分对C2H4与C2H6比率的增强作用具有挑战性。

The literature discusses how the addition of tetrachloromethane to the feed stream enhances the oxidative coupling of methane on oxide/silica catalysts, particularly for oxides of barium (Ba), cesium (Cs), and manganese (Mn). The effects vary depending on the type of catalyst, with some showing little impact and others experiencing strong inhibition when exposed to the additive. The presence of tetrachloromethane leads to an increase in the yield and selectivity of C2 hydrocarbons, especially ethylene, during the initial stages of the reaction. Computational and experimental studies suggest that the additive modifies the oxide surface in multiple ways, potentially altering its Lewis acid-base interactions and influencing its reducibility or irreducibility. While the yields and selectivities are not as high as those reported for some alkali-promoted alkaline earth and rare earth oxides, the significant increase in the production of dimerized products indicates potential for valuable practical and mechanistic insights into the conversion process and the role of the additive.

The document discusses how the introduction of a small amount of chloromethane (CC14) to the feed stream can dramatically enhance the formation of C2 hydrocarbons during the oxidative coupling of methane. This enhancement occurs specifically with the oxides of barium (Ba), cesium (Cs), and manganese (Mn) supported on silica. The document also mentions that the impact of CC14 on the oxidation process varies depending on the nature of the oxide used. It suggests that CC14 alters the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface, incorporating or retaining chlorine within the oxide, forming metal-chlorine bonds, and enabling the decomposition of CC14 to produce chlorine atoms or radicals. However, distinguishing between the heterogeneous and homogeneous roles in increasing the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 in the presence of CC14 is challenging due to the complex interactions involved.
