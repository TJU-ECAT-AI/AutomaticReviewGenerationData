[1] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different"
[2] "Over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C 2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction."
[3] "For example, in addition to oxides which facilitate the coupling reaction, there are some oxides such as Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO 2 which appear to have little effect on the oxidation process and some such as Pb/SiO 2, and T1/SiO 2 with which the addition of CCl 4 strongly inhibits the reaction."
[4] "It is difficult therefore to separate the heterogeneous from the homogeneous involvement in the enrichment of C2H 4 to C2H 6 ratio in the presence of CC14."
[5] "The relative high ratio of C2H 4 to C2H 6 observed in the presence of CC14 in the feed suggests that halogen radicals supplied from CC14 are catalyzing the dehydrogenation of C2H 6 to C2H 4."

1. In the recent studies on methane conversion by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, the addition of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream significantly influenced the conversion of methane and the selectivities to different products.

2. The yield of C2 hydrocarbons increased substantially within the first hours of reaction over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2.

3. The presence of chloromethanes had varied effects depending on the type of oxide used. Some facilitated the coupling reaction, while others like Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO2 had little impact. Conversely, Pb/SiO2 and T1/SiO2 showed strong inhibition of the reaction when exposed to chloromethanes.

4. It's challenging to distinguish between the heterogeneous and homogeneous components contributing to the enhancement of the C2H4 to C2H6 ratio when chloromethanes are present in the feed.

5. Halogen radicals from chloromethanes likely catalyzed the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, given the observed high ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 in the presence of chloromethanes.

1. 在对硝酸氧化硅支持的杂多酸氧化物进行的最近研究中，向流体中添加二氯甲烷或四氯化碳显著影响了甲烷的转化和不同产物的选择性。

2. 在最初的几个小时内，Ba/SiO2和Cs/SiO2上产生的C2氢化合物的产率有了显著增加。

3. 氯甲烷的存在对不同的氧化物产生了不同的影响。一些氧化物促进耦合反应，而Ni/SiO2、Cd/SiO2和Zn/SiO2等则几乎没有影响。相反，Pb/SiO2和T1/SiO2在暴露于氯甲烷时强烈抑制了反应。

4. 当氯甲烷存在于流体中时，区分异相和均相成分对C2H4与C2H6比率的增强作用具有挑战性。

5. 可能是卤素自由基从氯甲烷催化了C2H6转化为C2H4，因为观察到在存在氯甲烷的情况下，C2H4与C2H6的比例较高。
