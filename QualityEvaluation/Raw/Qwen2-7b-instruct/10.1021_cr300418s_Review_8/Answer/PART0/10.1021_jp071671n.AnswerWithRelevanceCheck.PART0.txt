          [1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
          [2] "Among these, only Au and Ag cause a substantial lowering of OVFE, comparable to that caused by alkali dopants."
          [3] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."
          [4] "We were unsuccessful in our attempts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with other properties of the dopants like: the ionization energy, the electronegativity, the chemical hardness, and the covalent or the ionic radius."
          [5] "However, some rationalization of these results is possible. A dopant at the surface forms fewer bonds with oxygen than a dopant in the bulk. If the dopant-oxygen bond is weaker than the ZnO bond, then less binding energy is lost if the dopant is at the surface."
          [6] "The model used here contains two weak points. Highly dispersed catalysts have a large number of steps, kinks, mesas, and other morphological features on their surface. The calculations performed here are relevant only for the flat facets of such oxides."

          Dopants that decrease the energy of oxygen vacancy formation (OVFE) tend to be located at the surface of zinc oxide (ZnO) rather than in the bulk. Among these, gold (Au) and silver (Ag) cause a significant reduction in OVFE, similar to alkali metal dopants. High-valence dopants (HVDs) that increase OVFE generally prefer to substitute zinc (Zn) atoms in the bulk of the host oxide, except for calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), ruthenium (Ru), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface. Efforts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with properties such as ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and atomic radii were unsuccessful. The reason dopants that decrease OVFE prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO is that they form fewer bonds with oxygen than dopants in the bulk. If the dopant-oxygen bond is weaker than the ZnO bond, less binding energy is lost when the dopant is at the surface. The model used here has two weak points: highly dispersed catalysts have a large number of steps, kinks, mesas, and other morphological features on their surface, and the calculations performed here are relevant only for the flat facets of such oxides.

          减少氧空位形成能（OVFE）的掺杂剂倾向于位于锌氧化物（ZnO）的表面，而不是内部。其中，金（Au）和银（Ag）对OVFE的降低造成显著影响，类似于碱金属掺杂剂。高价掺杂剂（HVDs）增加OVFE通常偏好在宿主氧化物的内部替换锌（Zn）原子，除了钙（Ca）、锶（Sr）、钡（Ba）、镧（La）、铈（Ce）、钌（Ru）、铁（Fe）、钴（Co）、锡（Sn）和铅（Pb），它们偏好在表面替换一个Zn原子。尝试将OVFE的大小与电离能、电负性、化学硬度和原子半径等属性相关联的努力失败了。降低OVFE的掺杂剂倾向于位于ZnO表面的原因是它们与氧形成的键少于内部的掺杂剂。如果掺杂剂-氧键比ZnO键弱，则当掺杂剂位于表面时，失去的结合能量较少。所用的模型有两个弱点：高度分散的催化剂在其表面上具有大量的台阶、尖峰、台地和其他形态特征，这里进行的计算仅适用于此类氧化物的平坦面。

          Alkali metals, as well as silver (Ag) and gold (Au), significantly weaken the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, enhancing its catalytic properties. This effect is comparable to that of alkali dopants. High-valence dopants tend to preferentially substitute zinc atoms in the bulk, except for calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), erbium (Er), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute zinc atoms at the surface. The presence of any of these dopants in place of Zn stabilizes the oxygen atoms (making it harder to create an oxygen vacancy). The increase in size of the atom also affects the structure of the doped oxide around a dopant substituting a surface Zn atom. Our overall conclusion is that among so many possible dopant-oxide host pairs, there are some promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.

The position of the dopant in the oxide depends on the method of preparation and the kinetics of the preparation process. However, at lower temperatures, the total energy of the system can be used as an indicator of the stability of the dopant's location. We found that alkali dopants, as well as Ag and Au, are particularly active in weakening the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, with Pt, Pd, Cd, Ir, and Rh being less active.

          氧空位形成能（OVFE）作为衡量晶格氧参与氧化反应的火星和范克里夫机制的容易程度的指标。我们发现，锂、钠、钾、铷、铯、锇、铑、铱、镍、钯、铂、铜、银、金和镉降低OVFE，并倾向于位于锌氧化物（ZnO）的表面而不是内部。大多数增加OVFE的掺杂剂倾向于在内部晶格中替换锌原子，除了钙（Ca）、锶（Sr）、钡（Ba）、镧（La）、铈（Ce）、铼（Re）、铁（Fe）、钌（Ru）、钴（Co）、锡（Sn）和铅（Pb），这些元素更倾向于在表面替换锌原子。氧化物中掺杂剂的位置取决于制备方法和制备过程的动力学。然而，在较低温度下，系统的总能量可以作为确定掺杂剂位置稳定性的指标。我们发现，碱金属掺杂剂以及银（Ag）和金（Au）特别活跃于减弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键，铂（Pt）、钯（Pd）、镉（Cd）、铱（Ir）和铑（Rh）的作用较弱。我们总体的结论是在如此多可能的掺杂剂-氧化物宿主对中，存在一些有前景的氧化和氧化脱氢催化剂的希望。
