Oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) is used as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen can participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanisms for oxidation reactions. We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk. Most dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface. The position of the dopant in the oxide depends on the method of preparation and the kinetics of the preparation process. However, at lower temperatures, the total energy of the system can be used as an indicator of the stability of the dopant's location. We found that alkali dopants, as well as Ag and Au, are particularly active in weakening the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, with Pt, Pd, Cd, Ir, and Rh being less active. Our overall conclusion is that among so many possible dopant-oxide host pairs, there is hope for some promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.

This work provides insights into the complex interplay between dopants and metal oxides, contributing to a better understanding of their effects on catalytic performance.
