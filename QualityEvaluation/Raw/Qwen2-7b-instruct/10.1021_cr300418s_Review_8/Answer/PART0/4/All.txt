We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk. Most dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface. The position of the dopant in the oxide depends on the method of preparation and the kinetics of the preparation process. However, at lower temperatures, the total energy of the system can be used as an indicator of the stability of the dopant's location. We found that alkali dopants, as well as Ag and Au, are particularly active in weakening the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, with Pt, Pd, Cd, Ir, and Rh being less active. Our overall conclusion is that among so many possible dopant-oxide host pairs, there is hope for some promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.", "Chinese": "氧空位形成能（OVFE）作为衡量晶格氧参与氧化反应的火星和范克里夫机制的容易程度的指标。我们发现，锂、钠、钾、铷、铯、锇、铑、铱、镍、钯、铂、铜、银、金和镉降低OVFE，并倾向于位于锌氧化物（ZnO）的表面而不是内部。大多数增加OVFE的掺杂剂倾向于在内部晶格中替换锌原子，除了钙（Ca）、锶（Sr）、钡（Ba）、镧（La）、铈（Ce）、铼（Re）、铁（Fe）、钌（Ru）、钴（Co）、锡（Sn）和铅（Pb），这些元素更倾向于在表面替换锌原子。氧化物中掺杂剂的位置取决于制备方法和制备过程的动力学。然而，在较低温度下，系统的总能量可以作为确定掺杂剂位置稳定性的指标。我们发现，碱金属掺杂剂以及银（Ag）和金（Au）特别活跃于减弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键，铂（Pt）、钯（Pd）、镉（Cd）、铱（Ir）和铑（Rh）的作用较弱。我们总体的结论是在如此多可能的掺杂剂-氧化物宿主对中，存在一些有前景的氧化和氧化脱氢催化剂的希望。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp071671n"},
