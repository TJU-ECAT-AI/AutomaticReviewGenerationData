Alkali metals, as well as silver (Ag) and gold (Au), significantly weaken the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, enhancing its catalytic properties. This effect is comparable to that of alkali dopants. High-valence dopants tend to preferentially substitute zinc atoms in the bulk, except for calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), erbium (Er), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute zinc atoms at the surface. The presence of any of these dopants in place of Zn stabilizes the oxygen atoms (making it harder to create an oxygen vacancy). The increase in size of the atom also affects the structure of the doped oxide around a dopant substituting a surface Zn atom. Our overall conclusion is that among so many possible dopant-oxide host pairs, there are some promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.

The doping of metal oxides with same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influences their catalytic properties by weakening the bond between oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making oxygen vacancy formation easier. This enhances the reactivity of the oxide, particularly towards gases like CO, which reacts more readily with oxygen atoms near the dopant. HVDs, in particular, tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it, leading to improved catalytic activity against reactions such as CO oxidation. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is affected by the choice of dopant, with a correlation observed between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on a doped oxide and the enthalpy of the dopant's oxide formation. This relationship provides insights into the dopant's effect on the oxide's catalytic performance. For instance, doping La2O3 with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, or Al can lead to a substantial reduction in the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, enhancing its catalytic efficiency. The study highlights the importance of understanding the specific dopant's effect on the oxide's electronic structure and the energetics of oxygen-vacancy formation to optimize catalytic applications.

The scientific literature focuses on the detailed examination of the thermodynamic, electronic, and structural characteristics of Cu/CeO₂ surfaces and interfaces utilizing first-principles DFT+U calculations. This research aims to elucidate how dopants, specifically same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs), impact the catalytic properties of various metal oxides. Insights from both computational and experimental analyses shed light on the significant role of dopant behavior in diverse catalytic applications. However, the literature acknowledges the ongoing challenges in developing universally applicable predictive guidelines for dopant behavior, which take into account factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible.
