<p>Some dopants weaken the bond between the oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making it easier to make oxygen vacancies. (1) The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant. (2-5)</p>
          <p>For several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation.</p>
          <p>Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant. Calculations and experiments show that this activated oxygen reacts with CO and oxidizes it.</p>
          <p>In this article, we study how the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the (001) and (011) faces of La2O3 is affected by doping the oxide with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, or Al. We are interested in La2O3 because it has been used as a catalyst for the oxichlorination of methane, (11) for the destruction of halogenated organic compounds, (12, 13) and for methane oxidative coupling. (14, 15) Lanthanum oxide doped with Fe and Sr catalyzes methane oxidative coupling, (16-18) and doping seems to improve the efficiency of the catalyst.</p>
          <p>The formation of oxygen vacancies has been studied extensively for reducible oxides, in particular, TiO2 and CeO2. (19-23) The removal of an oxygen atom from these oxides causes the reduction of Ti or Ce from a formal charge of 4+ to 3+. The electrons that had been engaged in the bond between the removed oxygen and the oxide become localized on the cation after oxygen removal. Even though compounds in which La is divalent exist (e.g., LaH2, LaSe, LaS, LaTe), La has a very strong preference for being trivalent. For this reason, La2O3 is considered an irreducible oxide in the sense that chemical events at the surface of the oxide will not induce La atoms to change their valence (or formal charge).</p>
          <p>There is a fair correlation between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on a doped oxide and the enthalpy of the formation of the oxide of the dopant. (11) The graph is also useful for a qualitative interpretation of the results: it suggests that the state of the Fe dopant in the lanthanum oxide is closer to that in Fe2O3 than to that in FeO because the point representing Fe2O3 is closer to the straight line in the graph. For Cu, the distinction is not as clear as for Fe because the enthalpy of formation of CuO is so close to that of Cu2O.</p>
          <p>From among divalent dopants, we have chosen Cu, because it is capable of two valence states, and Mg, because it is unwilling to change its valence. Zn was selected because it is an irreducible dopant (like Mg, it will not change its valence) whose enthalpy for oxide formation is lower than that of Mg. From among trivalent dopants, we picked Fe, which is multivalent, and Al, which is not.
