Dopants that decrease the energy of oxygen vacancy formation (OVFE) tend to be located at the surface of zinc oxide (ZnO) rather than in the bulk. Among these, gold (Au) and silver (Ag) cause a significant reduction in OVFE, similar to alkali metal dopants. High-valence dopants (HVDs) that increase OVFE generally prefer to substitute zinc (Zn) atoms in the bulk of the host oxide, except for calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), ruthenium (Ru), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface. Efforts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with properties such as ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and atomic radii were unsuccessful. The reason dopants that decrease OVFE prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO is that they form fewer bonds with oxygen than dopants in the bulk. If the dopant-oxygen bond is weaker than the ZnO bond, less binding energy is lost when the dopant is at the surface. The model used here has two weak points: highly dispersed catalysts have a large number of steps, kinks, mesas, and other morphological features on their surface, and the calculations performed here are relevant only for the flat facets of such oxides.

Electronic structure and reactivity of cerium (Ce) and zirconium (Zr)-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) have been assessed through the use of density functional theory approaches. Computational and experimental studies have elucidated how these dopants influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly considering Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible or irreducible). Despite these advancements, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the intricate nature of these factors.

The doping of metal oxides with same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influences their catalytic properties by weakening the bond between oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making oxygen vacancy formation easier. This enhances the reactivity of the oxide, particularly towards gases like CO, which reacts more readily with oxygen atoms near the dopant. HVDs, in particular, tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it, leading to improved catalytic activity against reactions such as CO oxidation. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is affected by the choice of dopant, with a correlation observed between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on a doped oxide and the enthalpy of the dopant's oxide formation. This relationship provides insights into the dopant's effect on the oxide's catalytic performance. For instance, doping La2O3 with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, or Al can lead to a substantial reduction in the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, enhancing its catalytic efficiency. The study highlights the importance of understanding the specific dopant's effect on the oxide's electronic structure and the energetics of oxygen-vacancy formation to optimize catalytic applications.

The promoting action of ceria (CeO2) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, specifically in the context of Pt/CeO2 catalysts for CO oxidation, is attributed to its oxygen storage capacity (OSC), enhanced reducibility of Pt in the presence of ceria, higher dispersion of Pt over ceria compared to other supports like Al2O3, and the prevention of sintering of Pt metal particles. Quantitative evidence from Figure 1 demonstrates that the CO conversion rate over 1% Pt/CeO2 is significantly higher (85 times) than that over pure Pt metal particles at 200°C. XRD analysis confirms the presence of 0.08% Pt metal and indicates that if any Pt oxides were formed, they would have been detected. The catalyst preparation involves a single-step solution combustion technique, resulting in 1% Pt/CeO2 nanocrystallites. Platinum is primarily stabilized in a +2 oxidation state on nanosized CeO2 in a Ce1-xPtxO2-δ-like phase, making the Pt ions the active sites for CO oxidation in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst.
