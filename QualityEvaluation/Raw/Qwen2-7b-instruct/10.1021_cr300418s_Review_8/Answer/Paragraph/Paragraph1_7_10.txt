            <p>Our analysis reveals that same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) significantly influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, notably affecting their reactivity and efficiency in processes such as propane dehydrogenation. These dopants modulate the electronic structure and energetics of the oxide surface, thereby impacting oxygen vacancy formation, which is pivotal for catalytic activity. The study of SVDs and HVDs in various host systems provides insights into the complex interplay between dopant chemistry, oxide properties, and catalytic performance.</p>
            <p>A comprehensive understanding of dopant behavior in metal oxides has been facilitated through both computational and experimental approaches. Electronic structure calculations and density functional theory (DFT) have been instrumental in elucidating the role of dopants, particularly in terms of their Lewis acid-base interactions and their impact on the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the intricate nature of these factors and their variability across different systems.</p>
            <p>For instance, in the case of zinc oxide (ZnO), dopants like lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), osmium (Os), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) tend to decrease the energy of oxygen vacancy formation (OVFE) and preferentially locate at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk. Among these, gold (Au) and silver (Ag) cause a substantial reduction in OVFE, comparable to alkali dopants. Conversely, high-valence dopants that increase OVFE generally prefer to substitute zinc (Zn) atoms in the bulk of the host oxide, except for certain exceptions like calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), ruthenium (Ru), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface.</p>
            <p>Despite efforts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with properties like ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and atomic radii, successful correlations have proven elusive. This highlights the complexity of dopant behavior, which is influenced by a myriad of factors including the nature of the dopant itself and the specific characteristics of the host oxide.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the placement of dopants at the surface versus in the bulk of the oxide can be explained by the number of bonds formed with oxygen atoms. Surface dopants form fewer bonds with oxygen, allowing them to maintain a weaker bond than the ZnO bond, thus reducing the binding energy when the dopant is at the surface. This principle helps rationalize the observed behavior of dopants at the surface of ZnO.</p>
            <p>However, the model used in such analyses contains two weak points: highly dispersed catalysts often exhibit complex morphologies on their surface, and the calculations performed typically focus on flat facets of the oxide. This means that the models may not fully capture the behavior of dopants in more complex, real-world catalyst geometries.</p>

            <p>Looking ahead, the field of catalysis stands at the cusp of exciting new discoveries. The integration of advanced materials science, computational chemistry, and synthetic techniques promises to yield catalysts with unprecedented performance. As we delve deeper into the effects of dopants on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, we anticipate uncovering novel strategies for optimizing catalytic activity. The development of predictive models that can accurately forecast dopant behavior in different host systems will be a cornerstone of this endeavor.</p>
            <p>The future of catalysis will likely involve the strategic design of metal oxides with tailored dopant compositions to enhance their catalytic properties for specific applications. This will require a nuanced understanding of the interplay between dopant valence, oxide structure, and reaction kinetics. Moreover, the ability to control dopant distribution within the oxide matrix, whether at the surface or in the bulk, will be critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance.</p>
            <p>As we look towards the horizon, the exploration of emerging fields and innovative methodologies becomes paramount. Research directions may include the development of novel catalyst designs that leverage the synergies between different dopants and host oxides, the creation of catalysts with tunable surface morphologies, and the application of machine learning algorithms to predict and optimize catalytic behavior based on dopant composition and oxide structure.</p>

            <p>我们的分析表明，同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对金属氧化物的催化性质产生了显著影响，特别是它们在反应活性和效率方面的作用。这些掺杂剂通过调节氧化物表面的电子结构和能态，进而影响氧空位形成，这对于催化作用至关重要。通过同价掺杂剂和高价掺杂剂在不同宿主系统中的研究，我们可以深入了解掺杂剂化学、氧化物属性与催化性能之间的复杂相互作用。</p>
            <p>通过计算和实验方法对掺杂行为进行深入理解，密度泛函理论（DFT）等工具在阐明掺杂剂的作用中发挥了关键作用，尤其是在考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用以及宿主氧化物的可还原性和不可还原性方面。然而，由于这些因素的复杂性和变化性，构建能够预测掺杂剂行为的一般性规则仍面临挑战。</p>
            <p>以锌氧化物（ZnO）为例，锂（Li）、钠（Na）、钾（K）、铷（Rb）、铯（Cs）、锇（Os）、铑（Rh）、铱（Ir）、镍（Ni）、钯（Pd）、铂（Pt）、铜（Cu）、银（Ag）和金（Au）等掺杂剂倾向于降低氧空位形成能（OVFE），并优先位于ZnO表面而非内部。其中，金（Au）和银（Ag）对OVFE的降低效果显著，类似于碱金属掺杂剂。相比之下，增加OVFE的高价位掺杂剂通常倾向于在宿主氧化物的内部替代锌（Zn）原子，除非是某些例外情况，如钙（Ca）、锶（Sr）、钡（Ba）、镧（La）、铈（Ce）、钌（Ru）、铁（Fe）、钴（Co）、锡（Sn）和铅（Pb），它们更倾向于在表面替代一个Zn原子。</p>
            <p>尽管尝试将OVFE与离子化能、电负性、化学硬度和原子半径等属性相关联的努力未能取得成功，这凸显了掺杂剂行为的复杂性，其受到多种因素的影响，包括掺杂剂本身的性质及其宿主氧化物的具体特性。</p>
            <p>此外，掺杂剂在表面与内部的放置可以由它们与氧原子形成的键的数量来解释。表面掺杂剂形成较少的氧键，允许它们维持比ZnO键弱的键，从而在表面时减少结合能。这一原理有助于解释掺杂剂在ZnO表面的行为。</p>
            <p>然而，用于此类分析的模型存在两个薄弱环节：高度分散的催化剂往往在其表面上具有复杂的形态，而执行的计算主要关注氧化物的平滑面。这意味着模型可能无法完全捕捉在更复杂的实际催化剂几何形状下的掺杂剂行为。</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>展望未来，催化领域正处于激动人心的新发现边缘。先进的材料科学、计算化学和合成技术的结合，有望产生性能空前的催化剂。随着我们深入研究掺杂剂对金属氧化物催化性质的影响，我们预计会揭示优化催化活性的新型策略。能够准确预测不同宿主系统中掺杂剂行为的预测模型将成为这一努力的核心。</p>
            <p>催化未来的方向很可能会涉及根据特定应用设计具有定制掺杂组成的金属氧化物，以增强其催化性能。这需要深入了解掺杂剂价态、氧化物结构与反应动力学之间的相互作用。此外，控制氧化物内部掺杂剂分布的精确程度，无论是表面还是内部，对于实现最佳催化性能至关重要。</p>
            <p>展望未来，探索新兴领域和创新方法变得尤为重要。研究方向可能包括利用不同掺杂剂和宿主氧化物之间的协同效应开发新型催化剂设计、创造具有可调表面形态的催化剂，以及基于掺杂剂组成和氧化物结构应用机器学习算法来预测和优化催化行为。</p>
