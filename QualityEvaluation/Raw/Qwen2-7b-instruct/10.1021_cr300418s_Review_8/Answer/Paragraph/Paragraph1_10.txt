The incorporation of dopants into metal oxide structures significantly influences their catalytic performance, a fact that has been extensively studied in the field of materials science. This influence is particularly pronounced when considering the effects of both same-valence and high-valence dopants within diverse host systems. Same-valence dopants, which carry the same charge as the host metal ions, introduce localized defects or modify the electronic structure without altering the overall ionic valence, thereby potentially enhancing the surface reactivity or modifying the adsorption energies of reactant molecules. High-valence dopants, on the other hand, can lead to significant changes in the electronic band structure, creating new states that can act as effective sites for catalytic reactions. These dopants often alter the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) pathways, affecting the overpotential required for these processes. The choice of dopant type, concentration, and the specific host metal oxide play critical roles in determining the final catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Comprehensive analyses have revealed that the precise tuning of these parameters can lead to the development of highly efficient catalysts for various applications, including energy conversion and storage technologies. Understanding the intricate mechanisms by which dopants affect the catalytic properties of metal oxides is thus essential for optimizing their performance in practical applications, making this area of research both challenging and rewarding.
