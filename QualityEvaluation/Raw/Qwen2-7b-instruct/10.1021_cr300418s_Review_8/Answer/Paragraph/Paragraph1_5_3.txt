            Electronic structure and reactivity of cerium (Ce) and zirconium (Zr)-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) have been assessed through the use of density functional theory approaches. Computational and experimental studies have elucidated how these dopants influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly considering Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible or irreducible). Despite these advancements, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the intricate nature of these factors.

            From among divalent dopants, Cu and Mg were chosen because Cu is capable of two valence states, and Mg is unwilling to change its valence. Zn was selected because it is an irreducible dopant (like Mg, it will not change its valence) whose enthalpy for oxide formation is lower than that of Mg. From among trivalent dopants, Fe and Al were picked, with the enthalpies of formation of the oxides of these dopants all smaller than the enthalpy of formation of lanthanum oxide. All of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above.

            The model used here contains two weak points. Highly dispersed catalysts have a large number of steps, kinks, mesas, and other morphological features on their surface. The calculations performed here are relevant only for the flat facets of such oxides. There is a fair correlation between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on a doped oxide and the enthalpy of the formation of the oxide of the dopant. The graph is also useful for a qualitative interpretation of the results: it suggests that the state of the Fe dopant in the lanthanum oxide is closer to that in Fe2O3 than to that in FeO because the point representing Fe2O3 is closer to the straight line in the graph. For Cu, the distinction is not as clear as for Fe because the enthalpy of formation of CuO is so close to that of Cu2O.

            通过密度泛函理论方法评估了铈（Ce）和锆（Zr）掺杂的二氧化钛（TiO2）的电子结构和反应活性。计算和实验研究表明，这些掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物的催化性能，特别是考虑到Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物（可还原性或不可还原性）的性质。尽管取得了这些进步，但仍然难以建立通用的掺杂剂行为预测规则，这归因于这些因素的复杂性和多样性。

            在二价掺杂剂中，选择了Cu和Mg，因为Cu具有两种价态的能力，而Mg不愿意改变其价态。Zn被选择为不可还原掺杂剂（类似于Mg，它不会改变其价态），其形成氧化物的焓低于镁。在三价掺杂剂中，选择了Fe和Al，它们形成氧化物的焓都小于镧氧化物的焓。所有这些掺杂剂均能显著降低氧空位形成能，符合上述倾向规则。

            这里使用的模型包含两个弱点。高度分散的催化剂在其表面上具有大量台阶、凸起、台地和其他形态特征。这里进行的计算仅适用于这类氧化物的平滑面。氧空位形成能与掺杂氧化物的形成焓之间存在良好的相关性。图表对于定性的解释也很有用：它表明镧氧化物中的Fe掺杂剂状态更接近Fe2O3而不是FeO，因为代表Fe2O3的点更靠近直线。对于Cu，这种区分不如Fe明显，因为CuO的形成焓接近Cu2O。
