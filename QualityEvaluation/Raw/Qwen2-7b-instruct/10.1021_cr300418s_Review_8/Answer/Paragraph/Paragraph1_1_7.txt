        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/jp071671n], synthesizing understanding from references [10.1021/jp203112], [10.1063/1.3515424], and [10.1021/jp022132f]. The role of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) in influencing the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly in the context of propane dehydrogenation, is thoroughly explored. Insights from computational and experimental studies reveal that SVDs and HVDs can significantly alter the electronic structure and reactivity of metal oxides, impacting their performance in various catalytic applications.

        Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) play crucial roles in determining dopant behavior. However, formulating general predictive rules remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of these factors. Challenges include correlating the magnitude of oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) with properties of dopants like ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and atomic radii. Rational explanations for why dopants prefer certain locations on the oxide surface, such as the surface of zinc oxide (ZnO) for SVDs and the bulk for most HVDs, are provided.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook section delves into the future directions for research in this field. It emphasizes the importance of considering emerging fields and innovative methodologies to address the challenges in formulating general predictive rules. Potential future research directions might focus on developing more sophisticated computational models, exploring the effects of dopants in more complex oxide systems, and investigating the role of surface morphology in dopant behavior.

        The review concludes by highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach to tackle the complexities involved in understanding and predicting the effects of dopants on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, with a particular focus on propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The insights gained from this review provide a foundation for advancing the field and optimizing catalyst design for more efficient and sustainable processes.

        根据参考文献 [10.1021/jp071671n] 的深入分析，结合了来自 [10.1021/jp203112]、[10.1063/1.3515424] 和 [10.1021/jp022132f] 的综合理解，详细探讨了同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对金属氧化物催化性能的影响，特别是丙烷脱氢应用中的影响。计算和实验研究揭示，SVDs 和 HVDs 可以显著改变金属氧化物的电子结构和反应活性，从而影响它们在各种催化应用中的表现。

        诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物（可还原性与不可还原性）的性质等因素，在决定掺杂物行为方面起着关键作用。然而，由于这些因素的复杂性和变化性，制定通用预测规则仍然具有挑战性。挑战包括将氧空位形成能（OVFE）的大小与掺杂物的离子化能、电负性、化学硬度和原子半径等属性相关联。对于为什么某些掺杂物倾向于在氧化物表面的特定位置（如锌氧化物（ZnO）的表面对于SVDs而言，大多数HVDs倾向于在宿主氧化物的内部）提供了合理的解释。

        整合的理解与前瞻展望部分强调了需要采取多学科的方法来解决理解并预测金属氧化物中掺杂物对催化性能影响的复杂性，并特别关注了丙烷脱氢催化剂领域的进展。从这一综述中获得的见解为推动该领域的发展和优化催化剂设计以实现更高效、更可持续的过程提供了基础。
