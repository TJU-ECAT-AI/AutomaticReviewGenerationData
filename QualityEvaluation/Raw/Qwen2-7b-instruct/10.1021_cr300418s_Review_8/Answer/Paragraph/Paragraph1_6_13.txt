        Detailed analysis has been conducted to understand the complex effects of dopants on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, focusing on the behavior of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) in various host systems. Studies have revealed that dopants influencing the energy of oxygen vacancy formation (OVFE) tend to locate at the surface of zinc oxide (ZnO) rather than in the bulk. Among these, gold (Au) and silver (Ag) notably decrease OVFE, comparable to alkali metal dopants. HVDs that increase OVFE usually prefer to substitute zinc atoms in the bulk of the host oxide, except for certain elements like calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), ruthenium (Ru), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb), which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface. Despite attempts, there hasn't been a successful correlation between the magnitude of OVFE and properties like ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and atomic radii of the dopants. The reason dopants that decrease OVFE prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO is that they form fewer bonds with oxygen than dopants in the bulk, minimizing the binding energy loss when the dopant is at the surface.

        Computational and experimental studies have provided insights into how dopants affect the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly considering Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the intricate nature of these factors. Highly dispersed catalysts present additional complexities with morphological features on their surface, limiting the relevance of calculations to flat facets of such oxides.

        The model used in these studies has identified two weak points: the relevance of calculations to the flat facets of oxides, and the complexity of predicting dopant behavior across various factors. Future research may aim to address these limitations by incorporating more advanced modeling techniques that account for the full range of surface morphologies and the interplay between dopant properties and host oxide characteristics.

        The integrative understanding of these findings suggests that there is potential for advancing the field by exploring novel dopants and host oxide combinations, leveraging the insights gained from computational and experimental studies. Emerging research areas might include the development of tailored catalysts with optimized dopant compositions and structures, as well as the application of machine learning algorithms to predict dopant effects more accurately. The broader horizons opened by this work indicate promising avenues for improving the performance and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts in a variety of industrial processes.
        
        The key takeaways from this review are:
        1. Same-valence and high-valence dopants exhibit distinct behaviors in terms of their impact on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, affecting the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of metal oxides.
        2. The location of dopants at the surface versus in the bulk of the host oxide plays a critical role in determining their overall effect on catalytic performance.
        3. Computational and experimental studies provide valuable insights into dopant behavior, but challenges remain in formulating universal predictive rules due to the complexity of dopant-host oxide interactions.
        4. Future research efforts should focus on addressing the limitations of current models and exploring new strategies for optimizing dopant selection and catalyst design to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

        对于金属氧化物中的掺杂剂（SVDs和HVDs）对催化性质的影响进行了深入分析，特别关注了不同主系统的掺杂行为。研究发现，影响氧空位形成能（OVFE）的掺杂剂倾向于位于锌氧化物（ZnO）的表面而不是内部。其中，金（Au）和银（Ag）显著降低OVFE，类似于碱金属掺杂剂。增加OVFE的高价掺杂剂通常更倾向于替换主氧化物中的锌原子，除非是某些元素如钙（Ca）、锶（Sr）、钡（Ba）、镧（La）、铈（Ce）、钌（Ru）、铁（Fe）、钴（Co）、锡（Sn）和铅（Pb），这些元素更倾向于在表面替换一个Zn原子。尽管尝试过，但没有成功地将OVFE的大小与掺杂剂的离子化能、电负性、化学硬度和原子半径等属性相关联。降低OVFE的掺杂剂倾向于位于ZnO表面的原因是它们与氧气形成的键较少，在表面时损失的结合能更少。

        计算和实验研究表明，掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物的催化性能，特别是考虑到Lewis酸-碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质（可还原性vs不可还原性）。然而，由于各种因素的复杂性，制定通用的预测规则以描述掺杂剂行为仍然具有挑战性。高度分散的催化剂在表面上存在复杂的形态特征，这限制了对平表面的计算结果的适用性。

        所使用的模型已识别出两个弱点：计算结果仅适用于氧化物的平表面，并且难以预测掺杂剂行为的复杂性。未来的研究可能旨在通过集成更先进的建模技术来解决这些局限性，这些技术能够考虑表面形态的全范围以及掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间的相互作用。新兴的研究领域可能包括开发具有优化掺杂剂组成和结构的定制催化剂，以及利用机器学习算法更准确地预测掺杂剂效应。

        这一综述的关键要点包括：
        1. 同价和高价掺杂剂在影响氧空位形成能方面表现出不同的行为，从而影响金属氧化物的表面化学和催化性能。
        2. 掺杂剂在宿主氧化物中的位置（表面与内部）对其整体催化性能的影响至关重要。
        3. 计算和实验研究为理解掺杂剂行为提供了宝贵见解，但仍然存在挑战，因为难以制定普遍的预测规则，原因是掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间相互作用的复杂性。
        4. 将来的研究工作应侧重于解决当前模型的局限性，并探索新的策略来优化掺杂剂选择和催化剂设计，以提高催化效率和选择性。
