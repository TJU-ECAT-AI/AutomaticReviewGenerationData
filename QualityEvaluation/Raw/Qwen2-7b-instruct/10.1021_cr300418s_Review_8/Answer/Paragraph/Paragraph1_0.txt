        The complex effects of dopants on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly focusing on same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs), have been extensively explored. SVDs, including elements like Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, and Cu, tend to lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation (OVFE) and preferentially locate at the surface of zinc oxide (ZnO) rather than in the bulk, with gold (Au) and silver (Ag) causing substantial reductions comparable to alkali metals. Conversely, HVDs that increase OVFE generally substitute Zn atoms in the bulk of the host oxide, except for certain elements like Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, and Fe, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface.

        Computational and experimental studies have provided valuable insights into how dopants impact the catalytic properties of metal oxides, especially considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). However, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of these factors. A model used in these studies acknowledges two weak points: highly dispersed catalysts often exhibit a multitude of surface features, and calculations performed are relevant only for the flat facets of such oxides.

        The model predicts that a dopant at the surface forms fewer bonds with oxygen than one in the bulk, and if the dopant-oxygen bond is weaker than the ZnO bond, less binding energy is lost when the dopant is at the surface. This model explains why dopants that decrease OVFE prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO. However, the model also acknowledges limitations, particularly concerning the relevance of calculations to the flat facets of highly dispersed catalysts.

        Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the referenced documents, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more accurate predictive models, understanding the role of dopants in diverse catalytic applications beyond propane dehydrogenation, and investigating the effects of dopants in complex oxide systems.

        关注同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物催化性能的复杂影响。SVDs，包括锂、钠、钾、铷、铯以及铜等元素，倾向于降低氧空位形成能（OVFE）并优先位于锌氧化物（ZnO）表面而非内部，其中金（Au）和银（Ag）导致的显著降低与碱金属类似。相比之下，增加OVFE的HVDs通常在主氧化物中替换Zn原子，除非某些元素如钙、锶、钡、镧、铈和铁等，更倾向于在表面替换一个Zn原子。

        计算机模拟和实验研究为理解金属氧化物催化性能提供了宝贵见解，特别是考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的可还原性或不可还原性。然而，由于这些因素的复杂性和变化性，预测掺杂剂行为的一般规则仍然具有挑战性。所用模型承认两个弱点：高度分散的催化剂往往具有多种表面特征，并且进行的计算仅适用于此类氧化物的平坦面。

        模型预测，表面的掺杂剂与氧形成的键少于内部的键，如果掺杂剂-氧键弱于ZnO键，则表面的掺杂剂损失的结合能量较少。这一模型解释了为什么减少OVFE的掺杂剂倾向于位于ZnO表面的原因。然而，模型也承认局限性，特别是关于计算对高度分散催化剂的平坦面的相关性。

        考虑到文件中讨论的进展和发现，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来研究可能侧重于开发更准确的预测模型、深入理解掺杂剂在不同催化应用中的作用，并研究掺杂剂在复杂氧化物系统中的影响。
