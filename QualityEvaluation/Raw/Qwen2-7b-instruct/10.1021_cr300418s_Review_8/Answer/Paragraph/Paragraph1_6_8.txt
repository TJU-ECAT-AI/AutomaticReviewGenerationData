        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing predictive models that consider the complex interplay between dopant properties and their impact on catalytic performance. Additionally, investigating the role of dopants in enhancing the stability and selectivity of catalysts under various operational conditions could provide insights into optimizing catalytic processes. The model used here acknowledges two limitations: the relevance of calculations to flat facets of oxide surfaces and the complexity in formulating general rules due to the variability in dopant behavior across different host systems. Addressing these limitations could involve refining computational methods to account for surface morphology and developing a more comprehensive framework that integrates both computational predictions and experimental observations. Future work might also delve into the dynamics of dopant diffusion and its effect on catalytic activity over time, as well as exploring the synergistic effects of combining multiple dopants to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
