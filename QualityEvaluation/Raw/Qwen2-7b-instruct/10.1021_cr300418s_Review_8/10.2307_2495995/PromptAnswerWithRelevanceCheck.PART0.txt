The review suggests that Robert G. Wesson's fixation on the distribution of power, particularly the party's monopoly, in his books on the Soviet Russian State and The Soviet State: An Aging Revolution, provides a framework that highlights discrepancies between political reality and mythology. This emphasis could potentially limit the understanding of how the political system operates beyond just power dynamics.

当然的核心问题在于，将权力分布作为理解政治体制运作的最佳框架是否合适。这种关注党的垄断权力，并且传统地指出神话与政治现实之间的差异的做法，可能使罗伯特·G·韦森在《苏联俄罗斯国家》和《苏联国家：一个老龄革命》两本书中强调了政治体系运行方式的理解仅限于权力层面。这种聚焦可能限制了对政治系统运作方式的全面理解。
