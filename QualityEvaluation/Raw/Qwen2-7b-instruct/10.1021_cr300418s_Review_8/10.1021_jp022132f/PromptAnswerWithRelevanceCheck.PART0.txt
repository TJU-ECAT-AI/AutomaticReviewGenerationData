<p>It is observed that interaction between noble metal such as Pt with ceria enhances the catalytic activities. 11-18 The promoting action of CeO2 is attributed to oxygen storage capacity (OSC), higher reducibility in the presence of Pt, higher dispersion of Pt over CeO2 compared to Al2O3, and prevention of sintering of Pt metal particles.</p>
<p>The promoting effect of CeO2 in Pt/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation can be seen quantitatively in Figure 1. For example, at 200 C, the CO conversion rate over 1% Pt/CeO2 is 1.13 × 10-3 mol g-1 (Pt) s-1, whereas it is 1.32 × 10-5 mol g-1 (Pt) s-1 over Pt metal particles. Thus, the rate is 85 times higher on 1% Pt/CeO2 than on pure Pt metal particles.</p>
<p>In the XRD pattern about 0.08% Pt metal out of 1 at. % Pt is indeed detected. If any of the oxides of Pt are formed, even at the 0.08% level, it could have been detected in the XRD. In the TEM also, about 0.05% Pt is seen as metal particles out of 1% Pt taken in the preparation. In XPS studies, it is shown that about 0.07% Pt in 1% Pt/CeO2 are in metallic state.</p>
<p>Based on the Ce1-xPtxO2-δ model, the CO oxidation mechanism is depicted in Figure 13, where, , , and h• are doubly ionized oxide ion vacancy, neutral oxygen occupied in the vacancy, and electron hole, respectively. It is important to note that in addition to the Pt2+/Pt0 redox couple, the Ce4+/Ce3+ couple is involved in this model.</p>
<p>The main features of this investigation are: (1) single-step preparation of 1% Pt/CeO2 nanocrystallites by the solution combustion technique; (2) platinum is stabilized mainly in +2 oxidation state on nanosized CeO2 in the form of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ like phase; (3) platinum ions are the active sites in Pt/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation.</p>

The document provides insights into how ceria (CeO2) influences the catalytic properties of noble metals, particularly platinum (Pt), in different metal oxides. The promotion effect of ceria on Pt/CeO2 catalysts is attributed to several factors including:

1. **Enhanced Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC)**: Ceria has a high ability to store oxygen, which facilitates more efficient oxidation reactions.

2. **Increased Reducibility**: The presence of ceria allows for easier reduction of Pt, enhancing its reactivity.

3. **Improved Dispersion**: Pt is better dispersed over ceria compared to aluminum oxide (Al2O3), leading to more active surface sites.

4. **Prevention of Sintering**: Ceria helps prevent the aggregation of Pt particles, maintaining a more active catalyst structure.

These findings are based on detailed characterization methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The document also presents quantitative evidence showing that the catalytic activity of Pt/CeO2 is significantly higher than that of pure Pt, especially at lower temperatures.

Regarding the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, the document acknowledges that understanding the specific effects of dopants depends on factors like Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide. While ceria is reducible, the behavior of other oxides might differ, influencing how dopants interact and affect catalytic performance. The document's findings suggest that the precise arrangement and oxidation state of dopants, as well as their interactions with the host material, play crucial roles in determining the overall catalytic efficiency. However, the document does not provide a comprehensive set of rules applicable to all cases, indicating that further research is needed to develop a more generalizable framework.

In summary, the document elucidates the mechanisms by which ceria enhances the catalytic properties of Pt in metal oxide systems, providing valuable insights into the role of ceria as a promoter. It also highlights the complexities involved in predicting dopant behavior across different materials, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the interplay between dopants, host materials, and catalytic performance.

本文提供了有关铈（CeO2）如何影响不同金属氧化物中贵金属，特别是铂（Pt），的催化性能的见解。铈对Pt/CeO2催化剂的促进作用归因于以下因素：

1. **增强的氧存储能力（OSC）**：铈具有很高的氧存储能力，这有助于更高效的氧化反应。

2. **增加的可还原性**：铈的存在使得铂更容易被还原，从而增强了其活性。

3. **改善的分散性**：铂在铈上的分散效果优于铝氧化物（Al2O3），导致更多的活性表面位点。

4. **防止聚集**：铈帮助防止铂颗粒的聚集，保持更活跃的催化剂结构。

这些发现基于详细的表征方法，如X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）。文档还提供了定量证据，显示了Pt/CeO2的催化活性明显高于纯铂，尤其是在较低温度下。

关于预测掺杂剂行为的普遍规则的挑战，文档承认理解掺杂剂的影响取决于诸如Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质等因素。虽然铈是可还原的，但其他氧化物的行为可能不同，这影响了掺杂剂与宿主材料之间的相互作用及其对催化性能的影响。文档的发现表明，掺杂物的具体排列、氧化状态以及与宿主材料的相互作用对于确定总体催化效率起着关键作用。然而，文档并未提供适用于所有情况的全面规则，指出需要进一步研究来发展一个更通用的框架。

总之，文档阐明了铈如何通过金属氧化物系统增强铂的催化性能，提供了有关铈作为促进剂的宝贵见解。它也强调了在不同材料中预测掺杂剂行为的复杂性，并指出了进一步研究以开发更通用框架的必要性。

<p>Recently, we have synthesized ceria and alumina supported metal catalysts by the solution combustion method and studied their catalytic activities. 27-29 To understand the promoting effect of CeO2, we have investigated the structure of Pt/CeO2 catalyst by XRD, TEM, XPS, and FTIR techniques and carried out comparative catalytic studies on Pt/CeO2 prepared by the combustion method with fine Pt metal particles. Here, we show that platinum ions present in the form of a Ce1-xPtxO2-δ solid solution in the combustion synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalyst are the active sites, and the promoting action of CeO2 is attributed to the accessibility of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple with Pt2+/Pt0 through oxide ion vacancies.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of the CO + O2 reaction over 1% Pt/CeO2 as a function of time at 220 C is also investigated and it is shown in Figure 3. The GHSV for this constant temperature reaction was 30000 h-1. An increase in the percent conversion is seen initially, and after 150 min the reaction approaches a steady state complete conversion. Thereafter, no deactivation of the catalyst is observed even up to 25 h on stream reaction.</p>
<p>In XRD studies, a careful XRD study was undertaken to see whether platinum ions are incorporated into the CeO2 matrix in 1% Pt/CeO2 catalyst. Observed, calculated, and difference XRD patterns of 1% Pt/CeO2 are shown in Figure 6. Rietveld refinements are carried out by varying 19 parameters such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy. The diffraction lines are indexed to fluorite structure (Fm3m).</p>
<p>From the above studies, we suggest that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst consists of 30 nm Ce1-xPtxO2-δ crystallites where Pt in mostly the +2 state occupying the Ce4+ site creates oxide ion vacancy. Such a structure provides Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages. Total Pt content being low (just 1 at. %), even if all of the Pt taken are dispersed over the surface of 30 nm CeO2 crystallites, not more than 1520% of Ce4+ ion on the surface can be replaced by Pt ions.</p>
<p>Based on the Ce1-xPtxO2-δ model, the CO oxidation mechanism is depicted in Figure 13, where, , , and h• are doubly ionized oxide ion vacancy, neutral oxygen occupied in the vacancy, and electron hole, respectively. It is important to note that in addition to the Pt2+/Pt0 redox couple, the Ce4+/Ce3+ couple is involved in this model. Delocalization of electrons from Pt0 can easily occur to Ce(4f) levels due to the proximity of Pt2+ and Ce4+ provided by the Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages in the lattice.</p>

<p>Introduction The catalytic activity of dispersed metals on a support is influenced by a number of factors, namely, size, shape, extent of dispersion, relative amount of metals present, chemical nature of the support, and the strength of interaction between the support and the metal. </p>
<p>Recently, we have synthesized ceria and alumina supported metal catalysts by the solution combustion method and studied their catalytic activities. 27-29 To understand the promoting effect of CeO2, we have investigated the structure of Pt/CeO2 catalyst by XRD, TEM, XPS, and FTIR techniques and carried out comparative catalytic studies on Pt/CeO2 prepared by the combustion method with fine Pt metal particles.</p>
<p>The promoting effect of CeO2 in Pt/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation can be seen quantitatively in Figure 1. For example, at 200 C, the CO conversion rate over 1% Pt/CeO2 is 1.13 × 10-3 mol g-1 (Pt) s-1, whereas it is 1.32 × 10-5 mol g-1 (Pt) s-1 over Pt metal particles. Thus, the rate is 85 times higher on 1% Pt/CeO2 than on pure Pt metal particles.</p>
<p>In the XRD pattern about 0.08% Pt metal out of 1 at. % Pt is indeed detected. If any of the oxides of Pt are formed, even at the 0.08% level, it could have been detected in the XRD. In the TEM also, about 0.05% Pt is seen as metal particles out of 1% Pt taken in the preparation. In XPS studies, it is shown that about 0.07% Pt in 1% Pt/CeO2 are in metallic state. Even though, at 1 at. % Pt level, it is difficult to ascertain Pt ion substitution; high resolution XRD studies presented here certainly indicate the substitution of Pt2+ in the Ce4+ site by way of decrease in lattice parameter and total lattice oxygen compared to pure CeO2. This is further substantiated by the fact that a PtO or PtO2 phase could not be detected from any of the experimental techniques studied here.</p>
<p>To obtain higher rates of CO conversion, it is not sufficient alone that a larger number of CO adsorption sites is created. A corresponding increase in the availability of dissociated oxygen is essential. Even though lattice oxygen is utilized for CO2 formation, as seen from Figure 2, yield is low for the same CO flow compared to when feed oxygen is present. Therefore, additional sites for O2 adsorption/dissociation are needed.</p>
<p>Based on the Ce1-xPtxO2-δ model, the CO oxidation mechanism is depicted in Figure 13, where, , , and h• are doubly ionized oxide ion vacancy, neutral oxygen occupied in the vacancy, and electron hole, respectively. It is important to note that in addition to the Pt2+/Pt0 redox couple, the Ce4+/Ce3+ couple is involved in this model. Delocalization of electrons from Pt0 can easily occur to Ce(4f) levels due to the proximity of Pt2+ and Ce4+ provided by the Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages in the lattice. This model supports the experimental observation of the promoting effect of CeO2 such as high oxygen storage capacity at low temperature, higher dispersion of Pt, and prevention of sintering due to separation of Pt in the form of Pt2+ ions.</p>
<p>The main features of this investigation are: (1) single-step preparation of 1% Pt/CeO2 nanocrystallites by the solution combustion technique; (2) platinum is stabilized mainly in +2 oxidation state on nanosized CeO2 in the form of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ like phase; (3) platinum ions are the active sites in Pt/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation.
