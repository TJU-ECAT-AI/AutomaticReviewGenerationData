          "The promoting action of CeO2 is attributed to oxygen storage capacity (OSC), higher reducibility in the presence of Pt, higher dispersion of Pt over CeO2 compared to Al2O3, and prevention of sintering of Pt metal particles."
          "In the XRD pattern about 0.08% Pt metal out of 1 at. % Pt is indeed detected. If any of the oxides of Pt are formed, even at the 0.08% level, it could have been detected in the XRD."
          "The promoting effect of CeO2 in Pt/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation can be seen quantitatively in Figure 1."
          "The main features of this investigation are: (1) single-step preparation of 1% Pt/CeO2 nanocrystallites by the solution combustion technique; (2) platinum is stabilized mainly in +2 oxidation state on nanosized CeO2 in the form of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ like phase; (3) platinum ions are the active sites in Pt/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation."

          The promoting action of ceria (CeO2) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, specifically in the context of Pt/CeO2 catalysts for CO oxidation, is attributed to its oxygen storage capacity (OSC), enhanced reducibility of Pt in the presence of ceria, higher dispersion of Pt over ceria compared to other supports like Al2O3, and the prevention of sintering of Pt metal particles. Quantitative evidence from Figure 1 demonstrates that the CO conversion rate over 1% Pt/CeO2 is significantly higher (85 times) than that over pure Pt metal particles at 200°C. XRD analysis confirms the presence of 0.08% Pt metal and indicates that if any Pt oxides were formed, they would have been detected. The catalyst preparation involves a single-step solution combustion technique, resulting in 1% Pt/CeO2 nanocrystallites. Platinum is primarily stabilized in a +2 oxidation state on nanosized CeO2 in a Ce1-xPtxO2-δ-like phase, making the Pt ions the active sites for CO oxidation in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst.

          氧化铈（CeO2）在不同金属氧化物的催化性能中的促进作用，特别是在铂/氧化铈（Pt/CeO2）催化剂用于一氧化碳氧化时，归因于其氧气存储能力（OSC）、铂在氧化铈存在的条件下增强的可还原性、铂在氧化铈上的更高分散度与铝氧化物（Al2O3）相比，以及防止铂金属颗粒聚集。定量证据（图1）显示，在200°C下，1% Pt/CeO2的CO转化速率比纯铂颗粒高出85倍。XRD分析证实检测到了0.08%的铂金属，并表明如果形成了铂的氧化物，即使在0.08%水平，也能够在XRD中检测到。催化剂的制备采用单步溶液燃烧技术，得到1% Pt/CeO2纳米晶粒。铂主要稳定在氧化铈纳米大小的+2氧化态，以Ce1-xPtxO2-δ相的形式存在，成为Pt/CeO2催化剂中CO氧化的活性位点。

          "The catalytic activity of dispersed metals on a support is influenced by a number of factors, namely, size, shape, extent of dispersion, relative amount of metals present, chemical nature of the support, and the strength of interaction between the support and the metal."
          "To obtain higher rates of CO conversion, it is not sufficient alone that a larger number of CO adsorption sites is created. A corresponding increase in the availability of dissociated oxygen is essential."
          "The promoting effect of CeO2 in Pt/CeO2 catalyst is due to the ionic dispersion of platinum leading to Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages."

          The catalytic activity of dispersed metals on a support is influenced by multiple factors including particle size, shape, degree of dispersion, metal content relative to the support, the chemical nature of the support, and the strength of interaction between the support and the metal. To achieve higher rates of CO conversion, merely increasing the number of CO adsorption sites is insufficient; there must also be a corresponding increase in the availability of dissociated oxygen. The promoting effect of ceria (CeO2) in a Pt/CeO2 catalyst is attributed to the ionic dispersion of platinum leading to the formation of Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages.

          分散金属在载体上的催化活性受到多种因素的影响，包括颗粒大小、形状、分散程度、金属相对于载体的含量、载体的化学性质以及载体与金属之间的相互作用强度。为了获得更高的CO转化率，仅仅增加CO吸附位点的数量是不够的；还需要相应地提高解离氧的可用性。氧化铈（CeO2）在铂/氧化铈（Pt/CeO2）催化剂中的促进作用归因于铂的离子分散导致了铈4+氧2-铂2+键的形成。
