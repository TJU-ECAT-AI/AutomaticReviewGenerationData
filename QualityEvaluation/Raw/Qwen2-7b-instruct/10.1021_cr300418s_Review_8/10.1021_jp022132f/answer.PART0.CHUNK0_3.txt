1. The promoting action of CeO2 is attributed to several factors including its oxygen storage capacity (OSC), higher reducibility in the presence of Pt, greater dispersion of Pt over CeO2 compared to Al2O3, and the prevention of sintering of Pt metal particles.

2. Analysis of the XRD pattern revealed that only 0.08% of the 1 atomic percent Pt was detected as metal, suggesting that if any Pt oxides were formed, they would have been detected in the XRD.

3. Incorporation of ions in CeO2 can occur through a solid solution of the type Ce1-xPtxO2-δ.

4. Based on the studies conducted, it is suggested that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst comprises 30 nm Ce1-xPtxO2-δ crystallites, with Pt predominantly in the +2 state occupying the Ce4+ site, thereby creating oxide ion vacancies.

5. The promoting action of CeO2 in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst is attributed to the ionic dispersion of platinum, resulting in the formation of Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages.

1. CeO2的促进作用归因于多个因素，包括其氧气存储能力(OSC)、在Pt存在的条件下更高的还原性、Pt在CeO2上的更高分散度与Al2O3相比，以及防止Pt金属颗粒的聚集。

2. 分析XRD图谱显示，仅检测到了1原子百分比Pt中的0.08%为金属形式，这意味着如果存在任何Pt氧化物，它们可能在XRD中被检测到。

3. CeO2中离子的插入可以通过类型为Ce1-xPtxO2-δ的固溶体实现。

4. 根据研究结果，推测Pt/CeO2催化剂由30nm的Ce1-xPtxO2-δ晶粒组成，其中Pt主要以+2状态占据Ce4+位点，从而形成氧离子空位。

5. CeO2在Pt/CeO2催化剂中的促进作用归因于铂的离子分布，导致了Ce4+O2-Pt2+键的形成。
