<p>Introduction The catalytic activity of dispersed metals on a support is influenced by a number of factors, namely, size, shape, extent of dispersion, relative amount of metals present, chemical nature of the support, and the strength of interaction between the support and the metal. </p>
<p>Recently, we have synthesized ceria and alumina supported metal catalysts by the solution combustion method and studied their catalytic activities. 27-29 To understand the promoting effect of CeO2, we have investigated the structure of Pt/CeO2 catalyst by XRD, TEM, XPS, and FTIR techniques and carried out comparative catalytic studies on Pt/CeO2 prepared by the combustion method with fine Pt metal particles.</p>
<p>The promoting effect of CeO2 in Pt/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation can be seen quantitatively in Figure 1. For example, at 200 C, the CO conversion rate over 1% Pt/CeO2 is 1.13 × 10-3 mol g-1 (Pt) s-1, whereas it is 1.32 × 10-5 mol g-1 (Pt) s-1 over Pt metal particles. Thus, the rate is 85 times higher on 1% Pt/CeO2 than on pure Pt metal particles.</p>
<p>In the XRD pattern about 0.08% Pt metal out of 1 at. % Pt is indeed detected. If any of the oxides of Pt are formed, even at the 0.08% level, it could have been detected in the XRD. In the TEM also, about 0.05% Pt is seen as metal particles out of 1% Pt taken in the preparation. In XPS studies, it is shown that about 0.07% Pt in 1% Pt/CeO2 are in metallic state. Even though, at 1 at. % Pt level, it is difficult to ascertain Pt ion substitution; high resolution XRD studies presented here certainly indicate the substitution of Pt2+ in the Ce4+ site by way of decrease in lattice parameter and total lattice oxygen compared to pure CeO2. This is further substantiated by the fact that a PtO or PtO2 phase could not be detected from any of the experimental techniques studied here.</p>
<p>To obtain higher rates of CO conversion, it is not sufficient alone that a larger number of CO adsorption sites is created. A corresponding increase in the availability of dissociated oxygen is essential. Even though lattice oxygen is utilized for CO2 formation, as seen from Figure 2, yield is low for the same CO flow compared to when feed oxygen is present. Therefore, additional sites for O2 adsorption/dissociation are needed.</p>
<p>Based on the Ce1-xPtxO2-δ model, the CO oxidation mechanism is depicted in Figure 13, where, , , and h• are doubly ionized oxide ion vacancy, neutral oxygen occupied in the vacancy, and electron hole, respectively. It is important to note that in addition to the Pt2+/Pt0 redox couple, the Ce4+/Ce3+ couple is involved in this model. Delocalization of electrons from Pt0 can easily occur to Ce(4f) levels due to the proximity of Pt2+ and Ce4+ provided by the Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages in the lattice. This model supports the experimental observation of the promoting effect of CeO2 such as high oxygen storage capacity at low temperature, higher dispersion of Pt, and prevention of sintering due to separation of Pt in the form of Pt2+ ions.</p>
<p>The main features of this investigation are: (1) single-step preparation of 1% Pt/CeO2 nanocrystallites by the solution combustion technique; (2) platinum is stabilized mainly in +2 oxidation state on nanosized CeO2 in the form of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ like phase; (3) platinum ions are the active sites in Pt/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation. (4) Pt2+/Pt0 coupled with Ce4+/Ce3+ via oxygen vacancy is suggested to facilitate low-temperature redox reactions; (5) the promoting action of CeO2 in Pt/CeO2 catalyst is due to the ionic dispersion of platinum leading to Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages.</p>

1. The catalytic activity of dispersed metals on a support is influenced by factors such as size, shape, dispersion, metal amount, support chemical nature, and metal-support interaction strength.
2. The promoting effect of ceria on Pt/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation can be seen quantitatively, with an 85 times higher rate at 200 C compared to pure Pt metal particles.
3. Pt ions are incorporated into the CeO2 matrix in the form of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ solid solution, resulting in a decrease in lattice parameter and total oxygen content compared to pure CeO2.
4. The Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple, coupled with the Pt2+/Pt0 redox couple via oxygen vacancy, facilitates low-temperature redox reactions in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst.
5. The promoting action of ceria in Pt/CeO2 catalyst is attributed to ionic dispersion of platinum leading to Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages.
