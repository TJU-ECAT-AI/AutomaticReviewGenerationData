<p>Recently, we have synthesized ceria and alumina supported metal catalysts by the solution combustion method and studied their catalytic activities. 27-29 To understand the promoting effect of CeO2, we have investigated the structure of Pt/CeO2 catalyst by XRD, TEM, XPS, and FTIR techniques and carried out comparative catalytic studies on Pt/CeO2 prepared by the combustion method with fine Pt metal particles. Here, we show that platinum ions present in the form of a Ce1-xPtxO2-δ solid solution in the combustion synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalyst are the active sites, and the promoting action of CeO2 is attributed to the accessibility of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple with Pt2+/Pt0 through oxide ion vacancies.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of the CO + O2 reaction over 1% Pt/CeO2 as a function of time at 220 C is also investigated and it is shown in Figure 3. The GHSV for this constant temperature reaction was 30000 h-1. An increase in the percent conversion is seen initially, and after 150 min the reaction approaches a steady state complete conversion. Thereafter, no deactivation of the catalyst is observed even up to 25 h on stream reaction.</p>
<p>In XRD studies, a careful XRD study was undertaken to see whether platinum ions are incorporated into the CeO2 matrix in 1% Pt/CeO2 catalyst. Observed, calculated, and difference XRD patterns of 1% Pt/CeO2 are shown in Figure 6. Rietveld refinements are carried out by varying 19 parameters such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy. The diffraction lines are indexed to fluorite structure (Fm3m).</p>
<p>From the above studies, we suggest that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst consists of 30 nm Ce1-xPtxO2-δ crystallites where Pt in mostly the +2 state occupying the Ce4+ site creates oxide ion vacancy. Such a structure provides Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages. Total Pt content being low (just 1 at. %), even if all of the Pt taken are dispersed over the surface of 30 nm CeO2 crystallites, not more than 1520% of Ce4+ ion on the surface can be replaced by Pt ions.</p>
<p>Based on the Ce1-xPtxO2-δ model, the CO oxidation mechanism is depicted in Figure 13, where, , , and h• are doubly ionized oxide ion vacancy, neutral oxygen occupied in the vacancy, and electron hole, respectively. It is important to note that in addition to the Pt2+/Pt0 redox couple, the Ce4+/Ce3+ couple is involved in this model. Delocalization of electrons from Pt0 can easily occur to Ce(4f) levels due to the proximity of Pt2+ and Ce4+ provided by the Ce4+O2-Pt2+ linkages in the lattice.</p>

1. 在燃烧合成的Pt/CeO2催化剂中，铂离子以Ce1-xPtxO2-δ固溶体的形式存在，并且是活性位点。氧化铈的促进作用归因于Ce4+/Ce3+电荷耦合与Pt2+/Pt0通过氧离子空位的可接近性。
2. 在220°C下进行的CO + O2反应的催化活性实验显示，在150分钟后达到完全转化的稳态，即使连续反应长达25小时，催化剂也没有表现出失活现象。
3. 铂离子被整合到氧化铈矩阵中形成Ce1-xPtxO2-δ固溶体形式存在于1% Pt/CeO2催化剂中。
4. Pt/CeO2催化剂的结构由30nm的Ce1-xPtxO2-δ晶粒组成，其中铂离子占据Ce4+位点以形成氧离子空位。
5. Pt/CeO2催化剂的CO氧化机制包括Pt2+/Pt0氧化还原对、Ce4+/Ce3+对以及在Ce4+O2-Pt2+键接关系的晶格中促进Pt0电子向Ce(4f)能级的扩散。
