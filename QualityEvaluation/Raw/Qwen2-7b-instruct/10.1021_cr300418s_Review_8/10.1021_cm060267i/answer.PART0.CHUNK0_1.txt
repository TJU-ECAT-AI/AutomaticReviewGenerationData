The study found that the introduction of Ti ions into CeO2 leads to the formation of two types of oxygens in the mixed oxides: strongly bound and weakly bound. The strongly bound oxygens have a valency greater than 2.0, while the weakly bound oxygens have a valency less than 2.0. These weakly bound oxygens are responsible for the higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) in the mixed oxides compared to pure CeO2. The researchers determined the weakly bound oxygens by analyzing the bond valencies and binding energies of cations and oxygens using the bond valence method.

研究发现，将Ti离子引入到CeO2中会导致混合氧化物中形成两种类型的氧原子：强结合氧和弱结合氧。强结合氧的价大于2.0，而弱结合氧的价小于2.0。这些弱结合氧是混合氧化物中比纯CeO2更高的氧气存储能力（OSC）的原因。研究人员通过使用键价方法分析阳离子和氧原子的键价和结合能来确定弱结合氧。
