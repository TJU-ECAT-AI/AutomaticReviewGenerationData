The study investigates how Ti doping enhances the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of CeO2. EXAFS and DFT calculations reveal that oxygen coordination around Ti is distorted, leading to a 4 + 4 distribution. Four oxygens approach Ti at 1.9 Å, while the other four move away at 2.5 Å. The presence of short and long bonds results in two types of oxygens: strongly and weakly bound. The weakly bound oxygens contribute to the higher OSC in the mixed oxides.

In the mixed oxides, the presence of short and long bonds leads to two types of oxygens: strongly and weakly bound. The strongly bound oxygens have a valency greater than 2.0, while the weakly bound oxygens have a valency less than 2.0. These findings explain the enhanced reducibility and higher oxygen storage capacity observed in Ti-doped CeO2.

Despite advancements in understanding the effects of dopants on metal oxide properties, formulating general predictive rules remains challenging due to the complex interplay between dopant type, host oxide reducibility, and the specific catalytic application. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions further complicate the development of universal guidelines.
