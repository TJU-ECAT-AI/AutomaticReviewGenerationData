[1] "In this paper the higher OSC of the Ti doped CeO2 solid solution is probed by EXAFS and DFT calculations."
[2] "The EXAFS study of Ce1-xTixO2 shows that oxygen coordination around Ti is distorted, resulting in 4 + 4 distribution such that 4 oxygens come close to Ti at 1.9 Å while the other 4 move away at 2.5 Å."
[3] "We find that the presence of short and long bonds results in two types of oxygens: strongly and weakly bound."
[4] "Using the valencies of cations and oxygens calculated by the bond valence method and binding energies, we determined the weakly bound oxygens responsible for higher OSC in the mixed oxides."

1. The study investigates the increased oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria (CeO2) when titanium (Ti) is substituted through EXAFS and DFT calculations. 
2. Oxygen coordination around titanium is found to be distorted, leading to a 4 + 4 distribution where four oxygens approach titanium at 1.9 Å while the other four move away at 2.5 Å.
3. The presence of short and long bonds creates two types of oxygens: strongly bound and weakly bound.
4. By calculating the valencies of cations and oxygens using the bond valence method and determining binding energies, the study identifies the weakly bound oxygens as the cause for the higher OSC in the mixed oxides.

1. 研究通过EXAFS和DFT计算探讨了掺杂钛的CeO2固溶体更高的OSC。
2. 发现氧围绕钛的配位被扭曲，导致形成4 + 4分布，其中四个氧接近钛达到1.9 Å，其余四个远离至2.5 Å。
3. 短键和长键的存在产生了两种氧：强结合氧和弱结合氧。
4. 使用键值方法计算阳离子和氧的价数并确定结合能，研究确定了导致混合氧化物更高OSC的弱结合氧。
