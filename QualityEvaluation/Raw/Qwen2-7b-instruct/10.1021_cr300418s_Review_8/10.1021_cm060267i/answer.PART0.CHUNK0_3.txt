<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of Ti in CeO2 leads to a distortion in the oxygen coordination, creating two types of oxygens: strongly and weakly bound. The strongly bound oxygens have a valency greater than 2.0, while the weakly bound oxygens have a valency less than 2.0. These weakly bound oxygens contribute to the higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) in the mixed oxides.
