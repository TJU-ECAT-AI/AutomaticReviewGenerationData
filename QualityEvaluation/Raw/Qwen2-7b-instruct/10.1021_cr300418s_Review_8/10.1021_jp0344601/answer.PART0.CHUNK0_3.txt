Answer: SVDs and HVDs can significantly impact the catalytic properties of metal oxides, enhancing stability, selectivity, and activity. Challenges in predicting dopant behavior stem from understanding the Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide. The behavior of dopants in reducible versus irreducible host oxides differs, complicating the creation of universal rules.

答案：同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）可以显著影响金属氧化物的催化性能，提高稳定性和选择性，并增加活性。预测掺杂行为的挑战在于理解Lewis酸碱相互作用以及宿主氧化物的性质。在可还原与不可还原宿主氧化物中的掺杂行为不同，这使得制定通用规则变得复杂。
