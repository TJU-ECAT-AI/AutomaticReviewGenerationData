The CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide demonstrates thermal stability, transitioning from poorly crystalline to well-crystallized phases as the calcination temperature increases from 773 to 1073 K. Vanadia impregnation enhances the crystallization of CeO2 and TiO2 oxides. Despite calcination temperature changes, no crystalline V2O5 is observed. At lower calcination temperatures, the dispersed vanadium oxide forms polyvanadate species on the surface of CeO2TiO2. At higher temperatures, the vanadium oxide preferentially interacts with the ceria portion, forming a stable CeVO4 compound. XPS analysis reveals that CeO2TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples mainly contain their mixed-oxide elements in their highest oxidation states at 773 K. The presence of Ce(III) is noted across all temperatures. Further research is needed to elucidate the solid-state reactions between the vanadium oxide and CeO2TiO2, as these materials show promise in catalytic applications.

CeO2TiO2混合氧化物显示出热稳定性，在从773到1073 K的煅烧温度下，从非结晶性到结晶性相的转变。掺杂钒可以增强CeO2和TiO2氧化物的结晶化。无论煅烧温度如何变化，都无法观察到结晶性的V2O5。在较低的煅烧温度下，分散的钒氧化物在CeO2TiO2表面上形成聚钒酸盐物种。在较高温度下，分散的钒氧化物优先与铈部分相互作用，形成稳定的CeVO4化合物。XPS分析表明，773 K时的CeO2TiO2和V2O5/CeO2TiO2样品主要包含它们的混合氧化物元素的最高氧化态。注意到所有温度下都有Ce(III)的存在。需要进一步研究来阐明分散的钒氧化物与CeO2TiO2混合氧化物之间的固态反应机制，因为这些材料在催化应用中表现出前景。
