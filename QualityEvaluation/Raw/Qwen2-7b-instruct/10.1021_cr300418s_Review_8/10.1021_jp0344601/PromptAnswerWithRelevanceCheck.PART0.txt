The CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide demonstrates thermal stability, transitioning from poorly crystalline to well-crystallized phases as the calcination temperature increases from 773 to 1073 K. Vanadia impregnation enhances the crystallization of CeO2 and TiO2 oxides. Despite calcination temperature changes, no crystalline V2O5 is observed. At lower calcination temperatures, the dispersed vanadium oxide forms polyvanadate species on the surface of CeO2TiO2. At higher temperatures, the vanadium oxide preferentially interacts with the ceria portion, forming a stable CeVO4 compound. XPS analysis reveals that CeO2TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples mainly contain their mixed-oxide elements in their highest oxidation states at 773 K. The presence of Ce(III) is noted across all temperatures. Further research is needed to elucidate the solid-state reactions between the vanadium oxide and CeO2TiO2, as these materials show promise in catalytic applications.

CeO2TiO2混合氧化物显示出热稳定性，在从773到1073 K的煅烧温度下，从非结晶性到结晶性相的转变。掺杂钒可以增强CeO2和TiO2氧化物的结晶化。无论煅烧温度如何变化，都无法观察到结晶性的V2O5。在较低的煅烧温度下，分散的钒氧化物在CeO2TiO2表面上形成聚钒酸盐物种。在较高温度下，分散的钒氧化物优先与铈部分相互作用，形成稳定的CeVO4化合物。XPS分析表明，773 K时的CeO2TiO2和V2O5/CeO2TiO2样品主要包含它们的混合氧化物元素的最高氧化态。注意到所有温度下都有Ce(III)的存在。需要进一步研究来阐明分散的钒氧化物与CeO2TiO2混合氧化物之间的固态反应机制，因为这些材料在催化应用中表现出前景。

The study examines the structural characteristics of ceria-titania and vanadia/ceria-titania mixed oxides, focusing on their Raman and XPS analyses. The mixed oxide is prepared via a coprecipitation method and then impregnated with a nominal 5 wt % vanadia. The samples are subjected to thermal treatments ranging from 773 to 1073 K, followed by characterization using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. 

The results suggest that the CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide calcined at 773 K consists of poorly crystalline CeO2 and TiO2-anatase phases. Higher calcination temperatures lead to better crystallization of these oxides, with some incorporation of titanium into the ceria lattice. Impregnation of vanadia enhances the crystallization of CeO2 and TiO2, although no crystalline V2O5 is observed. Instead, the dispersed vanadia forms a stable CeVO4 compound at higher calcination temperatures, interacting preferentially with the ceria portion of the mixed oxide. XPS results confirm the presence of Ce(IV), Ti(IV), and V(V) in the mixed oxides, with the formation of Ce(III) noted at all temperatures. The study provides insights into the formation and evolution of CeVO4 in mixed oxide catalysts, influenced by factors such as temperature and dopant type.

该研究探讨了氧化铈-二氧化钛和氧化钒/氧化铈-二氧化钛混合氧化物的结构特性，重点是它们的拉曼光谱和XPS分析。混合氧化物通过共沉淀法制备，并随后用5 wt％的氧化钒浸渍。样品在773至1073 K的温度下进行热处理，随后使用X射线衍射（XRD）、拉曼光谱（RS）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）技术进行表征。

结果显示，773 K下煅烧的CeO2TiO2混合氧化物主要由非晶态CeO2和TiO2-α相组成。随着煅烧温度的升高，这些氧化物的结晶性得到改善，并且钛离子部分地进入铈化物晶格中。氧化钒的添加促进了CeO2和TiO2的结晶化，但没有观察到结晶的V2O5。相反，在较高煅烧温度下形成的分散的氧化钒与混合氧化物中的铈部分形成稳定的CeVO4化合物。XPS结果确认了混合氧化物中存在的Ce(IV)、Ti(IV)和V(V)，并注意到所有温度下都形成了Ce(III)。研究提供了有关CeVO4在混合氧化物催化剂中形成和演变的信息，这些信息受到诸如温度和掺杂剂类型等因素的影响。

Answer: SVDs and HVDs can significantly impact the catalytic properties of metal oxides, enhancing stability, selectivity, and activity. Challenges in predicting dopant behavior stem from understanding the Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide. The behavior of dopants in reducible versus irreducible host oxides differs, complicating the creation of universal rules.

The CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide demonstrates thermal stability, transitioning from poorly crystalline to well-crystallized phases with increasing calcination temperature. Impregnation of vanadia enhances the crystallization of both CeO2 and TiO2 oxides. XRD patterns show a mixture of CeO2 and TiO2 anatase phases, while Raman spectra confirm the presence of both CeO2 and TiO2 anatase phases. Broad bands in the Raman spectra suggest the presence of polyvanadate species at lower calcination temperatures, indicating vanadium oxide is mostly in the V(V) oxidation state. XPS results confirm that elements in the CeO2TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples are in their highest oxidation states at 773 K, with indications of Ce(III) ions present at all temperatures.

CeO2TiO2混合氧化物在热稳定性方面表现出色，随着烧结温度的升高，从非晶态向结晶良好的阶段过渡。将钒杂质注入CeO2TiO2混合氧化物中可以增强CeO2和TiO2氧化物的结晶化。XRD模式显示了CeO2和TiO2的anatase相的混合特征，而拉曼光谱确认了CeO2和TiO2的anatase相的存在。拉曼光谱中的宽带可能表明较低烧结温度下存在聚钒酸盐物种，这表明钒氧化物主要处于V(V)氧化状态。XPS结果表明，在773 K时，CeO2TiO2和V2O5/CeO2TiO2样品中的元素主要保持在最高氧化态，同时观察到不同温度下Ce(III)离子的存在。
