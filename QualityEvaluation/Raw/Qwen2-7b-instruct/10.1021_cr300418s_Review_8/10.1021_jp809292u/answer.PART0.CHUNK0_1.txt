[1] "Ceria surfaces have a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, (7, 8) which arises from the ability of ceria to change oxidation state from (formally) 4+ to (formally) 3+."
[2] "Doping of the (110) ceria surface with Ti, Zr, and Hf will enhance the oxidative ability of this ceria surface, consistent with previous studies of Zr doping of the bulk (10) and the (111) surface."
[3] "The introduction of the dopant into the (110) surface of ceria reduces the energy required for formation of an oxygen vacancy in the surface."
[4] "When two NO molecules adsorb at neighboring oxygen vacancies, the molecules tilt so that a bond begins to form between the N atoms of each NO molecule; the resulting NN distances are longer than in free N2 (1.10 Å), but it is clear that a NN bond is forming."
[5] "Enhancing oxygen vacancy formation will enhance the interaction of CO with a doped ceria surface, but the tradeoff will be that the interaction of NOx with the doped surface will not be as favorable."

1. Doping the (110) ceria surface with Ti, Zr, and Hf decreases the oxygen vacancy formation energy, enhancing the surface's oxidative ability. This is consistent with previous studies showing that Zr doping of ceria increases its oxidative capacity.
2. Doping ceria surfaces with Ti, Zr, and Hf affects their catalytic properties differently. Ti doping enhances CO adsorption, promoting CO oxidation, while Zr doping reduces the adsorption of NO, impacting its reductive power.
3. Dopants introduce structural distortions that facilitate oxygen vacancy formation, affecting the surface's reactivity. The trade-off is that while CO adsorption is enhanced, NO adsorption is weakened, altering the balance between oxidation and reduction.
4. NO molecules adsorbing at oxygen vacancies form a structure suggesting a partial bond between N atoms of each NO molecule. This indicates the potential for NO to undergo chemical transformation on the surface.
5. The correlation between oxygen vacancy formation and dopant behavior suggests that enhancing oxidation may come at the cost of reduced reductive capabilities. General predictive rules for dopant behavior in metal oxides remain elusive due to complex interactions and the specific nature of the host oxide.

1. 添加Ti、Zr和Hf到铈的（110）表面降低了氧空位形成能，提高了表面的氧化能力。这与先前关于Zr掺杂铈增加其氧化能力的研究一致。
2. 铈的表面掺杂Ti、Zr和Hf影响其催化性质的方式不同。Ti掺杂增强了CO吸附，促进CO氧化，而Zr掺杂减弱了NO吸附，影响其还原能力。
3. 添加剂引入结构畸变，有助于氧空位形成，影响表面活性。增强氧化的代价是减少还原能力，同时CO吸附得到增强，而NO吸附减弱，改变了氧化与还原之间的平衡。
4. 在氧缺陷处吸附的NO分子形成一个结构，表明每个NO分子的N原子之间可能形成部分化学键。这表明NO在表面可能存在化学转变的潜力。
5. 氧空位形成与掺杂物行为之间的相关性表明，增强氧化可能会以减少还原能力为代价。由于复杂的相互作用和宿主氧化物的特定性质，对于掺杂物行为的一般预测规则仍然难以捉摸。
