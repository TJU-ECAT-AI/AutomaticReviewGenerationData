[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17) It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria, (6, 9-18) by weakening the bonds to the oxide of the oxygen atoms around the dopant."
[2] "The introduction of the dopant into the (110) surface of ceria reduces the energy required for formation of an oxygen vacancy in the surface. The vacancy formation energy is still positive, which means that we do not expect oxygen vacancies to form spontaneously, in contrast to gold doping as discussed in ref 18, for example."
[3] "The adsorption of CO onto the doped surface shows the impact of the reduction of the vacancy formation energy, in that the energy gained when CO pulls two oxygen atoms out of the surface is much larger on the doped surface than on the undoped surface, leading to a greater stabilization of the surface intermediate."
[4] "On comparing the dopants, the shortest NN distance is found for Zr doping, which then has the longest NO distances (1.42 Å), as well as the longest dopantO distance (to O of the adsorbate), and it is for Zr doping that the smallest adsorption energy is found."
[5] "Considering the reactions (3) (4) which will be affected by ceria doping, the impact of Ti, Zr, and Hf doping on the redox activity of ceria is therefore two-fold. When doped with these elements, the oxidative power of ceria is enhanced: a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy is needed, CO adsorbs more strongly at the doped surface, and we expect CO oxidation to be enhanced."
[6] "On the other hand, the adsorption of NO at the doped surfaces is less favorable than at the undoped surface. These effects arise from distortions to the structure around the dopant facilitating formation of an oxygen vacancy upon doping, and from previous work, if vacancies are easily formed, then the reoxidation of the surface is less favorable."
[7] "We suggest that experiments could be carried out to test this idea."

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can significantly influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. For instance, doping ceria with Zr has been shown to enhance thermal stability and catalytic activity, likely due to weakening the bonds to the oxide of the oxygen atoms around the dopant, facilitating the reduction of ceria.

2. The introduction of dopants into the ceria surface reduces the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation. This contrasts with gold doping, which does not show spontaneous oxygen vacancy formation.

3. Doping the ceria surface with Ti, Zr, and Hf affects CO adsorption by reducing the vacancy formation energy, leading to a greater stabilization of the surface intermediate. This results in enhanced reactivity towards CO adsorption and oxidation.

4. Zr doping specifically influences NO adsorption negatively, with the shortest NN distance and longest NO distances, indicating a decrease in NO adsorption energy compared to other dopants.

5. Doping ceria with Ti, Zr, and Hf enhances its oxidative power, as indicated by the reduced oxygen vacancy formation energy, stronger CO adsorption, and expected enhancement of CO oxidation. 

6. However, these dopants negatively impact NO adsorption, making it less favorable compared to the undoped surface. This is attributed to the distortions in the structure around the dopant, which facilitate oxygen vacancy formation and subsequently reduce the reoxidation of the surface.

7. Further experimentation could validate the observed effects of dopant behavior on ceria's redox activity and catalytic performance.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）可以显著影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能。例如，向铈掺杂锆可以增强热稳定性和催化活性，这可能是因为减弱了氧原子周围掺杂剂与氧化物之间的键，从而促进了铈的还原。

2. 将掺杂物引入铈表面降低了氧空位形成所需的能量。这与金掺杂不同，金掺杂不显示自发氧空位形成。

3. 对铈进行Ti、Zr和Hf掺杂会影响CO吸附，通过降低氧空位形成能来增加表面中间体的稳定性。这导致CO吸附和氧化的增强反应性。

4. Zr掺杂特别影响NO吸附，具有最短的NN距离和最长的NO距离，表明与其它掺杂剂相比，NO吸附能降低了能量。

5. 对铈进行Ti、Zr和Hf掺杂增强了其氧化能力，通过减少氧空位形成能、增强CO吸附，并预期CO氧化增强。

6. 然而，这些掺杂剂对NO吸附产生负面影响，使其在掺杂表面比未掺杂表面更不利。这归因于掺杂剂周围结构的畸变，这促进氧空位形成并随后减少了表面的重新氧化。

7. 进一步的实验可以验证掺杂剂行为对铈的氧化还原活性和催化性能的影响。
