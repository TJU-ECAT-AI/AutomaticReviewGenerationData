[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17)"
[2] "Enhancing the oxidative power of the oxide makes molecular reduction less favorable."
[3] "On comparing the dopants, the shortest NN distance is found for Zr doping, which then has the longest NO distances (1.42 Å), as well as the longest dopantO distance (to O of the adsorbate), and it is for Zr doping that the smallest adsorption energy is found."
[4] "These effects arise from distortions to the structure around the dopant facilitating formation of an oxygen vacancy upon doping, and from previous work, if vacancies are easily formed, then the reoxidation of the surface is less favorable."

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by enhancing their oxidative power and promoting catalytic activity. This is evidenced by a reduction in the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation and improved adsorption of molecules like CO. However, these enhancements may lead to less favorable adsorption of NOx, potentially impacting the reductive power of the oxide.

2. The computational and experimental studies have revealed that dopants alter the structure of the host oxide, facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies. This can reduce the reoxidation of the surface, which in turn affects the interaction of molecules such as NOx. The nature of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible, plays a significant role in determining the dopant behavior and its impact on the catalytic performance.

3. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior stem from the complex interplay between Lewis acid-base interactions within the oxide structure and the specific properties of the dopant. The Lewis acidity or basicity of the dopant can significantly affect its solubility, stability, and reactivity within the host oxide, leading to variations in catalytic activity. Moreover, the reducibility of the host oxide itself can modulate the dopant's ability to form stable defects, thereby influencing its effectiveness in catalytic processes.

4. The computational studies highlight that Zr doping results in the shortest NN distance among the considered dopants, followed by the longest NO distances and the longest dopantO distance. This suggests that Zr doping might lead to a more favorable environment for the adsorption of NO, despite having the longest NO distances, due to its ability to form the most stable oxygen vacancies.

5. The insights gained from these studies suggest that further experimental investigations are needed to validate the computational predictions and to explore the detailed mechanisms governing the dopant behavior in different metal oxides. This includes understanding the specific effects of dopants on the surface chemistry, the formation of defects, and the interactions with reactants in various catalytic applications.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过增强氧化性并促进催化活性来影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能。这体现在降低氧空位形成所需的能量以及对如CO等分子的吸附上。然而，这些增强可能会导致NOx吸附不利，可能影响氧化物的还原性。

2. 计算和实验研究揭示了掺杂剂改变了宿主氧化物的结构，促进了氧空位的形成。这可能导致表面还原性减弱，从而影响NOx等分子的相互作用。宿主氧化物的可还原性或不可还原性在确定掺杂剂行为及其对催化性能影响方面起着重要作用。

3. 在制定一般预测规则时面临的挑战来自于掺杂剂与宿主氧化物结构中Lewis酸碱相互作用之间的复杂相互作用以及特定掺杂剂的性质。掺杂剂的Lewis酸性或碱性可以显著影响其在宿主氧化物中的溶解性、稳定性和反应性，导致催化活性的差异。此外，宿主氧化物本身的可还原性可以调节掺杂剂形成稳定缺陷的能力，进而影响其在催化过程中的有效性。

4. 计算研究表明，Zr掺杂产生最短的NN距离，随后是最长的NO距离和最长的掺杂剂O距离。这表明Zr掺杂可能对NO吸附产生更有利的环境，尽管NO距离最长，但其能够形成最稳定的氧空位，因此可能在不同的催化应用中表现出更好的效果。

5. 这些研究的见解表明，需要进一步的实验研究来验证计算预测，并探索不同金属氧化物中掺杂剂行为的详细机制。这包括理解特定条件下掺杂剂对表面化学、缺陷形成和与反应物相互作用的影响。
