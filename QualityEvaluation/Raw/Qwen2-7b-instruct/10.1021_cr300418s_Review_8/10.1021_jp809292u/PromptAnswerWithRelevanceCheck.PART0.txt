1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides by enhancing thermal stability and promoting catalytic activity. This is evidenced by studies on the effects of doping ceria with elements like Zr, Ti, and Hf, which have improved oxidative abilities due to reduced oxygen vacancy formation energies.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）可以通过增强热稳定性并促进催化活性来影响金属氧化物的催化性能。例如，通过向铈掺入元素如Zr、Ti和Hf，可以提高铈表面的氧化能力，因为这降低了氧空位形成能。

[1] "Ceria surfaces have a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, (7, 8) which arises from the ability of ceria to change oxidation state from (formally) 4+ to (formally) 3+."
[2] "Doping of the (110) ceria surface with Ti, Zr, and Hf will enhance the oxidative ability of this ceria surface, consistent with previous studies of Zr doping of the bulk (10) and the (111) surface."
[3] "The introduction of the dopant into the (110) surface of ceria reduces the energy required for formation of an oxygen vacancy in the surface."
[4] "When two NO molecules adsorb at neighboring oxygen vacancies, the molecules tilt so that a bond begins to form between the N atoms of each NO molecule; the resulting NN distances are longer than in free N2 (1.10 Å), but it is clear that a NN bond is forming."
[5] "Enhancing oxygen vacancy formation will enhance the interaction of CO with a doped ceria surface, but the tradeoff will be that the interaction of NOx with the doped surface will not be as favorable."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Doping the (110) ceria surface with Ti, Zr, and Hf decreases the oxygen vacancy formation energy, enhancing the surface's oxidative ability. This is consistent with previous studies showing that Zr doping of ceria increases its oxidative capacity.
2. Doping ceria surfaces with Ti, Zr, and Hf affects their catalytic properties differently. Ti doping enhances CO adsorption, promoting CO oxidation, while Zr doping reduces the adsorption of NO, impacting its reductive power.
3. Dopants introduce structural distortions that facilitate oxygen vacancy formation, affecting the surface's reactivity. The trade-off is that while CO adsorption is enhanced, NO adsorption is weakened, altering the balance between oxidation and reduction.
4. NO molecules adsorbing at oxygen vacancies form a structure suggesting a partial bond between N atoms of each NO molecule. This indicates the potential for NO to undergo chemical transformation on the surface.
5. The correlation between oxygen vacancy formation and dopant behavior suggests that enhancing oxidation may come at the cost of reduced reductive capabilities. General predictive rules for dopant behavior in metal oxides remain elusive due to complex interactions and the specific nature of the host oxide.

1. 添加Ti、Zr和Hf到铈的（110）表面降低了氧空位形成能，提高了表面的氧化能力。这与先前关于Zr掺杂铈增加其氧化能力的研究一致。
2. 铈的表面掺杂Ti、Zr和Hf影响其催化性质的方式不同。Ti掺杂增强了CO吸附，促进CO氧化，而Zr掺杂减弱了NO吸附，影响其还原能力。
3. 添加剂引入结构畸变，有助于氧空位形成，影响表面活性。增强氧化的代价是减少还原能力，同时CO吸附得到增强，而NO吸附减弱，改变了氧化与还原之间的平衡。
4. 在氧缺陷处吸附的NO分子形成一个结构，表明每个NO分子的N原子之间可能形成部分化学键。这表明NO在表面可能存在化学转变的潜力。
5. 氧空位形成与掺杂物行为之间的相关性表明，增强氧化可能会以减少还原能力为代价。由于复杂的相互作用和宿主氧化物的特定性质，对于掺杂物行为的一般预测规则仍然难以捉摸。

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by enhancing their oxidative power and promoting catalytic activity. This is evidenced by a reduction in the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation and improved adsorption of molecules like CO. However, these enhancements may lead to less favorable adsorption of NOx, potentially impacting the reductive power of the oxide.

2. The computational and experimental studies have revealed that dopants alter the structure of the host oxide, facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies. This can reduce the reoxidation of the surface, which in turn affects the interaction of molecules such as NOx. The nature of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible, plays a significant role in determining the dopant behavior and its impact on the catalytic performance.

3. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior stem from the complex interplay between Lewis acid-base interactions within the oxide structure and the specific properties of the dopant. The Lewis acidity or basicity of the dopant can significantly affect its solubility, stability, and reactivity within the host oxide, leading to variations in catalytic activity. Moreover, the reducibility of the host oxide itself can modulate the dopant's ability to form stable defects, thereby influencing its effectiveness in catalytic processes.

4. The computational studies highlight that Zr doping results in the shortest NN distance among the considered dopants, followed by the longest NO distances and the longest dopantO distance. This suggests that Zr doping might lead to a more favorable environment for the adsorption of NO, despite having the longest NO distances, due to its ability to form the most stable oxygen vacancies.

5. The insights gained from these studies suggest that further experimental investigations are needed to validate the computational predictions and to explore the detailed mechanisms governing the dopant behavior in different metal oxides. This includes understanding the specific effects of dopants on the surface chemistry, the formation of defects, and the interactions with reactants in various catalytic applications.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过增强氧化性并促进催化活性来影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能。这体现在降低氧空位形成所需的能量以及对如CO等分子的吸附上。然而，这些增强可能会导致NOx吸附不利，可能影响氧化物的还原性。

2. 计算和实验研究揭示了掺杂剂改变了宿主氧化物的结构，促进了氧空位的形成。这可能导致表面还原性减弱，从而影响NOx等分子的相互作用。宿主氧化物的可还原性或不可还原性在确定掺杂剂行为及其对催化性能影响方面起着重要作用。

3. 在制定一般预测规则时面临的挑战来自于掺杂剂与宿主氧化物结构中Lewis酸碱相互作用之间的复杂相互作用以及特定掺杂剂的性质。掺杂剂的Lewis酸性或碱性可以显著影响其在宿主氧化物中的溶解性、稳定性和反应性，导致催化活性的差异。此外，宿主氧化物本身的可还原性可以调节掺杂剂形成稳定缺陷的能力，进而影响其在催化过程中的有效性。

4. 计算研究表明，Zr掺杂产生最短的NN距离，随后是最长的NO距离和最长的掺杂剂O距离。这表明Zr掺杂可能对NO吸附产生更有利的环境，尽管NO距离最长，但其能够形成最稳定的氧空位，因此可能在不同的催化应用中表现出更好的效果。

5. 这些研究的见解表明，需要进一步的实验研究来验证计算预测，并探索不同金属氧化物中掺杂剂行为的详细机制。这包括理解特定条件下掺杂剂对表面化学、缺陷形成和与反应物相互作用的影响。

[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17) It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria, (6, 9-18) by weakening the bonds to the oxide of the oxygen atoms around the dopant."
[2] "The introduction of the dopant into the (110) surface of ceria reduces the energy required for formation of an oxygen vacancy in the surface. The vacancy formation energy is still positive, which means that we do not expect oxygen vacancies to form spontaneously, in contrast to gold doping as discussed in ref 18, for example."
[3] "The adsorption of CO onto the doped surface shows the impact of the reduction of the vacancy formation energy, in that the energy gained when CO pulls two oxygen atoms out of the surface is much larger on the doped surface than on the undoped surface, leading to a greater stabilization of the surface intermediate."
[4] "On comparing the dopants, the shortest NN distance is found for Zr doping, which then has the longest NO distances (1.42 Å), as well as the longest dopantO distance (to O of the adsorbate), and it is for Zr doping that the smallest adsorption energy is found."
[5] "Considering the reactions (3) (4) which will be affected by ceria doping, the impact of Ti, Zr, and Hf doping on the redox activity of ceria is therefore two-fold. When doped with these elements, the oxidative power of ceria is enhanced: a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy is needed, CO adsorbs more strongly at the doped surface, and we expect CO oxidation to be enhanced."
[6] "On the other hand, the adsorption of NO at the doped surfaces is less favorable than at the undoped surface. These effects arise from distortions to the structure around the dopant facilitating formation of an oxygen vacancy upon doping, and from previous work, if vacancies are easily formed, then the reoxidation of the surface is less favorable."

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can significantly influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. For instance, doping ceria with Zr has been shown to enhance thermal stability and catalytic activity, likely due to weakening the bonds to the oxide of the oxygen atoms around the dopant, facilitating the reduction of ceria.

2. The introduction of dopants into the ceria surface reduces the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation. This contrasts with gold doping, which does not show spontaneous oxygen vacancy formation.

3. Doping the ceria surface with Ti, Zr, and Hf affects CO adsorption by reducing the vacancy formation energy, leading to a greater stabilization of the surface intermediate. This results in enhanced reactivity towards CO adsorption and oxidation.

4. Zr doping specifically influences NO adsorption negatively, with the shortest NN distance and longest NO distances, indicating a decrease in NO adsorption energy compared to other dopants.

5. Doping ceria with Ti, Zr, and Hf enhances its oxidative power, as indicated by the reduced oxygen vacancy formation energy, stronger CO adsorption, and expected enhancement of CO oxidation. 

6. However, these dopants negatively impact NO adsorption, making it less favorable compared to the undoped surface. This is attributed to the distortions in the structure around the dopant, which facilitate oxygen vacancy formation and subsequently reduce the reoxidation of the surface.

7. Further experimentation could validate the observed effects of dopant behavior on ceria's redox activity and catalytic performance.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）可以显著影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能。例如，向铈掺杂锆可以增强热稳定性和催化活性，这可能是因为减弱了氧原子周围掺杂剂与氧化物之间的键，从而促进了铈的还原。

2. 将掺杂物引入铈表面降低了氧空位形成所需的能量。这与金掺杂不同，金掺杂不显示自发氧空位形成。

3. 对铈进行Ti、Zr和Hf掺杂会影响CO吸附，通过降低氧空位形成能来增加表面中间体的稳定性。这导致CO吸附和氧化的增强反应性。

4. Zr掺杂特别影响NO吸附，具有最短的NN距离和最长的NO距离，表明与其它掺杂剂相比，NO吸附能降低了能量。

5. 对铈进行Ti、Zr和Hf掺杂增强了其氧化能力，通过减少氧空位形成能、增强CO吸附，并预期CO氧化增强。

6. 然而，这些掺杂剂对NO吸附产生负面影响，使其在掺杂表面比未掺杂表面更不利。这归因于掺杂剂周围结构的畸变，这促进氧空位形成并随后减少了表面的重新氧化。

7. 进一步的实验可以验证掺杂剂行为对铈的氧化还原活性和催化性能的影响。

2. 计算和实验研究表明，对铈的表面进行SVD和HVD掺杂可以显著影响其催化性能。例如，用Ti、Zr和Hf掺杂可以增强铈的氧化能力，降低氧空位形成能并增加CO吸附。相反，这些掺杂剂可能削弱了NO与掺杂表面的相互作用，影响了氧化物的还原能力。

3. 制定一般预测规则以确定掺杂剂行为的挑战在于复杂的作用机制，包括掺杂剂属性、宿主氧化物特性以及特定催化反应之间的相互作用。因素如Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的可还原性在确定掺杂效果中起着关键作用。需要进一步研究来理解这些机制，并开发更准确的预测模型。
