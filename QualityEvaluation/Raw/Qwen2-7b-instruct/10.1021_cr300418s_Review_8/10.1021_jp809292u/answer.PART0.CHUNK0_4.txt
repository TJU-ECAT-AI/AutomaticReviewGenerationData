[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17)"
[2] "The introduction of the dopant into the (110) surface of ceria reduces the energy required for formation of an oxygen vacancy in the surface."
[3] "When two NO molecules adsorb at neighboring oxygen vacancies, the molecules tilt so that a bond begins to form between the N atoms of each NO molecule; the resulting NN distances are longer than in free N2 (1.10 Å), but it is clear that a NN bond is forming."
[4] "Considering the reactions (3) (4) which will be affected by ceria doping, the impact of Ti, Zr, and Hf doping on the redox activity of ceria is therefore two-fold. When doped with these elements, the oxidative power of ceria is enhanced, as indicated by a reduction in the energy required for the formation of oxygen vacancies and enhanced adsorption of CO. On the other hand, the adsorption of NO at the doped surfaces is less favorable than at the undoped surface."

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by enhancing their thermal stability and promoting catalytic activity. They reduce the energy required for the formation of oxygen vacancies and increase the adsorption of certain molecules, like CO, thereby enhancing the oxidative power of the oxide. However, they may decrease the adsorption of other molecules, such as NO, affecting the reductive power of the oxide.

2. The computational and experimental studies have shown that doping the ceria surface with SVDs and HVDs can significantly influence its catalytic performance. For instance, doping with Ti, Zr, and Hf enhances the oxidative power of ceria by lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy and increasing CO adsorption. Conversely, these dopants might weaken the interaction of NO with the doped surface, impacting its reductive power.

3. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior due to the complex interplay between dopant properties, host oxide characteristics, and specific catalytic reactions. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide play crucial roles in determining dopant effects. Further research is needed to understand these mechanisms and develop more accurate predictive models.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过增强热稳定性和促进催化活性影响不同金属氧化物的催化性质。它们减少了表面氧空位形成的能量需求，并增加了某些分子（如CO）的吸附，从而增强了氧化物的氧化能力。然而，它们可能会降低与掺杂表面的NO吸附，影响氧化物的还原能力。

2. 计算和实验研究表明，对铈的表面进行SVD和HVD掺杂可以显著影响其催化性能。例如，用Ti、Zr和Hf掺杂可以增强铈的氧化能力，降低氧空位形成能并增加CO吸附。相反，这些掺杂剂可能削弱了NO与掺杂表面的相互作用，影响了氧化物的还原能力。

3. 制定一般预测规则以确定掺杂剂行为的挑战在于复杂的作用机制，包括掺杂剂属性、宿主氧化物特性以及特定催化反应之间的相互作用。因素如Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的可还原性在确定掺杂效果中起着关键作用。需要进一步研究来理解这些机制，并开发更准确的预测模型。
