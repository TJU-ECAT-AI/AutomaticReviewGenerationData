[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17)"
[2] "Doping of the (110) ceria surface with Ti, Zr, and Hf will enhance the oxidative ability of this ceria surface, consistent with previous studies of Zr doping of the bulk (10) and the (111) surface. (35)"
[3] "On comparing the dopants, the shortest NN distance is found for Zr doping, which then has the longest NO distances (1.42 Å), as well as the longest dopantO distance (to O of the adsorbate), and it is for Zr doping that the smallest adsorption energy is found."
[4] "These effects arise from distortions to the structure around the dopant facilitating formation of an oxygen vacancy upon doping, and from previous work, if vacancies are easily formed, then the reoxidation of the surface is less favorable."

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides by enhancing thermal stability and promoting catalytic activity. This is evidenced by studies on the effects of doping ceria with elements like Zr, Ti, and Hf, which have improved oxidative abilities due to reduced oxygen vacancy formation energies.

2. The computational and experimental studies suggest that doping can affect the performance of metal oxides in various catalytic applications. SVDs and HVDs may alter the reactivity and selectivity of metal oxides, impacting the efficiency of processes like CO oxidation and NO reduction.

3. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the complex interplay between dopant interactions and the nature of the host oxide. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions play a crucial role in determining dopant behavior within the oxide structure.

4. The effects of dopants on metal oxides are influenced by the distortions they cause in the atomic structure, which can either enhance or hinder the formation of oxygen vacancies. The ease of oxygen vacancy formation and subsequent reoxidation of the surface can significantly impact the reductive and oxidative powers of the doped metal oxides.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）可以通过增强热稳定性并促进催化活性来影响金属氧化物的催化性能。例如，通过向铈掺入元素如Zr、Ti和Hf，可以提高铈表面的氧化能力，因为这降低了氧空位形成能。

2. 计算机和实验研究显示，掺杂可以影响金属氧化物在各种催化应用中的性能。同价掺杂剂和高价掺杂剂可能改变金属氧化物的反应性和选择性，从而影响过程如CO氧化和NO还原的效率。

3. 制定一般预测规则以确定掺杂剂行为的挑战包括理解掺杂剂相互作用与氧化物性质之间的复杂关系。诸如Lewis酸碱相互作用等因素对氧化物结构内的掺杂剂行为起着关键作用。

4. 掺杂剂对金属氧化物的影响受到它们在原子结构中造成的扭曲的影响，这些扭曲可以增强或阻碍氧空位的形成。氧空位形成的容易程度及其随后对表面的再氧化，可以显著影响掺杂金属氧化物的还原性和氧化性。
