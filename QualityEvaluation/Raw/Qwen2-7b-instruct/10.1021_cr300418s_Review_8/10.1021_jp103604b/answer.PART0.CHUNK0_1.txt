[1] "Some dopants weaken the bond between the oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making it easier to make oxygen vacancies."
[2] "Doping with Cu has the most dramatic effect on the geometry of the system."
[3] "The presence of Cu reduces the Evac(f) by more than 5 eV (from that of the pure La2O3 surface)."
[4] "The Cu-doped La2O3(001) has by far the lowest vacancy formation energies: 0.52 and 0.59 eV for the O4 and O6 vacancies, respectively."
[5] "All dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above."
[6] "We have found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above."
[7] "Doping La2O3 with Cu lowers the energy of vacancy formation the most."
[8] "A good dopant should activate the surface oxygen but not by too much."
[9] "It is often suggested that, because oxygen vacancies are chemically active, they must play an important role in catalysis."
[10] "We note that it is possible that many of the catalysts studied experimentally may be inadvertently doped."

1. Same-valence dopants weaken the bond between oxygen atoms and the oxide, facilitating oxygen vacancy formation. High-valence dopants also reduce the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, improving the oxide's catalytic properties. Insights from computational and experimental studies suggest that dopants modify the oxide's electronic structure and bond strength, affecting its reactivity and catalytic performance.

2. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the complex interactions between dopants, the host oxide, and the catalytic environment. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the oxide influence dopant effects, making it difficult to establish universal rules.

3. Accidental doping can significantly impact catalytic properties, as demonstrated by examples where impurities like Fe in silica or CaO, TiO2, and Na2O on the surface of YSZ influenced catalytic activities.

1. 同价掺杂剂削弱氧原子与氧化物之间的键，使形成氧空位变得更容易。高价掺杂剂也显著降低了氧空位形成的能量，改善了氧化物的催化性能。计算和实验研究的见解表明，掺杂剂修改了氧化物的电子结构和键强度，影响其活性和催化性能。

2. 制定通用预测规则以理解掺杂剂行为的挑战包括理解掺杂剂、宿主氧化物以及催化环境之间的复杂相互作用。诸如Lewis酸碱相互作用和氧化物的可还原性等因素影响掺杂剂效应，使得建立通用规则变得困难。

3. 偶然掺杂可以显著影响催化性能，如Fe在硅胶中的例子，或者YSZ表面的CaO、TiO2和Na2O杂质都影响了催化活性。
