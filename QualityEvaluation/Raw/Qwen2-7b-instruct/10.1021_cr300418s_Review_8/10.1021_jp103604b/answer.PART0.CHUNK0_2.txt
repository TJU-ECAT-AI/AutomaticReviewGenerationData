<p>The large oxygen formation energy for the pure La2O3 surfaces prompted us to investigate whether doping the La2O3 surface activates the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood of the dopant.</p>
<p>From among divalent dopants, we have chosen Cu, because it is capable of two valence states, and Mg, because it is unwilling to change its valence. Zn was selected because it is an irreducible dopant (like Mg, it will not change its valence) whose enthalpy for oxide formation is lower than that of Mg. From among trivalent dopants, we picked Fe, which is multivalent, and Al, which is not.</p>
<p>We have found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above. We also found that there is an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant.</p>
<p>Doping La2O3 with Cu lowers the energy of vacancy formation the most. This means two things: This system will lose the active oxygen easily to form an oxygen vacancy, which is not eager to adsorb O2 from the gas phase.</p>
<p>It is often suggested that, because oxygen vacancies are chemically active, they must play an important role in catalysis. This is not necessarily the case. If the oxidation reaction uses oxygen from the surface, the oxidation creates oxygen vacancies on the surface. However, because oxygen is present in the gas, the vacancies will be filled by a competing process. At steady state, the concentration of vacancies on the surface is established by the competition between reduction and oxidation.</p>
<p>There is at least one example where accidental doping affected catalysis: the activity of silica for methane partial oxidation is due to the unintended presence of Fe impurities. Also, Lefferts et al. used X-ray fluorescence and low-energy ion scattering to show that CaO, TiO2, and Na2O were present on the surface of YSZ and affected catalytic properties.</p>

1. Divalent dopants like Cu, Mg, and Zn, and trivalent dopants like Fe and Al, influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by lowering the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation. The linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant has been found.
2. Accidental doping, such as the presence of Fe impurities on silica, can significantly affect the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Unintended dopants like CaO, TiO2, and Na2O on the surface of YSZ can also alter catalytic activities.

1. 等价电荷掺杂剂（如Cu、Mg、Zn）和三价电荷掺杂剂（如Fe、Al）通过降低氧空位形成能，影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能。发现氧空位形成能与掺杂氧化物的形成焓之间存在近似线性关系。
2. 无意中的掺杂，如硅酸盐表面的Fe杂质，可以显著影响金属氧化物的催化性能。YSZ表面的CaO、TiO2和Na2O等意外掺杂物也可以改变催化性能。
