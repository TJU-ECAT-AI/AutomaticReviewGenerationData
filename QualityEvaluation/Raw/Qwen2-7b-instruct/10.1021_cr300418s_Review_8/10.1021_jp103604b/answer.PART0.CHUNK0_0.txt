<p>Some dopants weaken the bond between the oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making it easier to make oxygen vacancies. (1) The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant. (2-5)</p>
<p>For several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation.</p>
<p>Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant. Calculations and experiments show that this activated oxygen reacts with CO and oxidizes it.</p>
<p>In this article, we study how the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the (001) and (011) faces of La2O3 is affected by doping the oxide with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, or Al. We are interested in La2O3 because it has been used as a catalyst for the oxichlorination of methane, (11) for the destruction of halogenated organic compounds, (12, 13) and for methane oxidative coupling. (14, 15) Lanthanum oxide doped with Fe and Sr catalyzes methane oxidative coupling, (16-18) and doping seems to improve the efficiency of the catalyst.</p>
<p>The formation of oxygen vacancies has been studied extensively for reducible oxides, in particular, TiO2 and CeO2. (19-23) The removal of an oxygen atom from these oxides causes the reduction of Ti or Ce from a formal charge of 4+ to 3+. The electrons that had been engaged in the bond between the removed oxygen and the oxide become localized on the cation after oxygen removal. Even though compounds in which La is divalent exist (e.g., LaH2, LaSe, LaS, LaTe), La has a very strong preference for being trivalent. For this reason, La2O3 is considered an irreducible oxide in the sense that chemical events at the surface of the oxide will not induce La atoms to change their valence (or formal charge).</p>
<p>There is a fair correlation between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on a doped oxide and the enthalpy of the formation of the oxide of the dopant. (11) The graph is also useful for a qualitative interpretation of the results: it suggests that the state of the Fe dopant in the lanthanum oxide is closer to that in Fe2O3 than to that in FeO because the point representing Fe2O3 is closer to the straight line in the graph. For Cu, the distinction is not as clear as for Fe because the enthalpy of formation of CuO is so close to that of Cu2O.</p>
<p>From among divalent dopants, we have chosen Cu, because it is capable of two valence states, and Mg, because it is unwilling to change its valence. Zn was selected because it is an irreducible dopant (like Mg, it will not change its valence) whose enthalpy for oxide formation is lower than that of Mg. From among trivalent dopants, we picked Fe, which is multivalent, and Al, which is not. The enthalpies of formation of the oxides of these dopants are all smaller than the enthalpy of formation of lanthanum oxide.</p>
<p>We have found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above.</p>

The study explores how doping with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, or Al affects the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the (001) and (011) faces of La2O3. This energy is crucial for the catalytic properties of the oxide. Doping generally leads to a reduction in the energy required to form oxygen vacancies, making the oxide a better oxidant. Different dopants have varying effects based on their valence, oxide formation enthalpy, and ability to modify the chemical bonds of the oxygen atoms. A linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the dopant's oxide is observed, although the study acknowledges that numerous factors contribute to this relationship and further investigation is needed to generalize these findings.

The doping of La2O3 with Cu is found to have the most significant impact on reducing the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, suggesting that the Cu-doped surface will have an oxygen vacancy near the dopant, which is not eager to adsorb O2 from the gas phase. This finding supports the moderation principle, which posits that the best dopant activates the surface oxygen without overactivating it. 

The presence of dopants can alter the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation both globally and locally. Globally, the dopants change the Fermi level, affecting the charge of the vacancy and its energy of formation. Locally, if dopants tend to segregate at the surface, they can modify the chemical bonds of the oxygen atoms, further influencing the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation.

Experimental studies have shown that the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can vary significantly from computational predictions. This discrepancy may be due to the inadvertent introduction of dopants during catalyst preparation, which can affect the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation through both global and local effects.

本文研究了用Cu、Zn、Mg、Fe或Al对La2O3的（001）和（011）面进行掺杂，对其氧空位形成能的影响。这种能量对于氧化物的催化性能至关重要。掺杂通常导致形成氧空位所需的能量降低，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。不同的掺杂剂根据其电荷、氧化物形成焓以及对氧原子化学键的修改作用而产生不同的影响。观察到掺杂剂的氧化物形成焓与氧空位形成能之间存在线性关系，尽管研究承认有许多因素影响这种关系，并且需要进一步调查以概括这些发现。

在La2O3中掺杂Cu被发现对降低氧空位形成能的影响最大，这意味着掺杂Cu的表面将有一个靠近掺杂剂的氧空位，该氧空位不急于从气相吸附O2。这支持了“适度原则”，即最好的掺杂剂激活表面氧而不过度激活它。

掺杂剂可以以全局和局部两种方式改变氧空位形成能。全局上，掺杂剂改变了费米能级，影响空位的电荷及其形成能。局部上，如果掺杂剂倾向于在表面聚集，它们可以修改氧原子与氧化物的化学键，进一步影响氧空位形成能。

实验研究表明，计算预测的氧空位形成能可能有很大差异。这种差异可能是由于催化剂制备过程中无意引入的掺杂剂造成的，这些掺杂剂通过全局和局部效应影响氧空位形成能。
