Electronic structure and reactivity of cerium (Ce) and zirconium (Zr)-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) have been assessed through the use of density functional theory approaches. Computational and experimental studies have elucidated how these dopants influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly considering Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible or irreducible). Despite these advancements, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the intricate nature of these factors.

通过密度泛函理论方法，对铈（Ce）和锆（Zr）掺杂的钛酸盐（TiO2）的电子结构和反应性进行了评估。计算和实验研究揭示了这些掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物的催化性能，特别是考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质（可还原或不可还原）。尽管取得了这些进展，但由于这些因素的复杂性和变化性，仍难以制定通用的预测规则来描述掺杂行为。
