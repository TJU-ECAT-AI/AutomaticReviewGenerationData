The electronic structure and reactivity of Ce- and Zr-doped TiO2 have been assessed through the reliability of density functional theory approaches. Incorporating dopants into metal oxides affects their catalytic properties, particularly in different catalytic applications. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior exist, considering factors like Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide.
