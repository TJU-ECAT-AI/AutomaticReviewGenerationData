10.1 Introduction
"The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not."
10.2 HVDs in Irreducible Oxides
"Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO. They showed that all HVDs increased the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant."
10.3 HVDs in Reducible Oxides
"Very few calculations have examined this kind of system. They allow us to make some guesses and extrapolations, but they need to be reinforced (or modified) by further work."
10.4 The Stability of High-Valence Dopants
"One would suspect that such a dopant in contact with gas-phase oxygen might prefer to leave the cationic site, move on top of the surface, and adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to form an oxide cluster."

High-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides based on the reducibility of the host oxide. In irreducible oxides, HVDs can increase the energy required for removing a surface oxygen atom near the dopant, potentially hindering oxidation. In reducible oxides, HVDs can donate electrons to reduce host ions, affecting the redox properties. However, the effects of HVDs are complex and require further investigation, as computational models often provide only preliminary insights that need to be validated experimentally. The stability of HVDs in contact with gas-phase oxygen is another challenge, as they may segregate from the cationic site to form oxide clusters. These phenomena contribute to the difficulty in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in catalysis, particularly in reducible oxides, where the interplay between Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide significantly influences the outcomes.

高价掺杂剂（HVD）对不同金属氧化物的催化性质的影响取决于宿主氧化物的可还原性。在不可还原氧化物中，HVD可以增加移除靠近掺杂剂的表面氧原子所需的能量，可能阻碍氧化。在可还原氧化物中，HVD可以捐赠电子来减少宿主离子，影响氧化还原性质。然而，HVD的作用机制复杂，需要进一步的研究，因为计算模型通常仅提供初步见解，这些见解需要通过实验验证。HVD与气体相氧气接触时的稳定性也是一个挑战，它们可能会从阳离子位点分离形成氧化物簇。这些现象加剧了在催化领域制定通用预测规则的难度，特别是在可还原氧化物中，Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质之间的相互作用显著影响结果。
