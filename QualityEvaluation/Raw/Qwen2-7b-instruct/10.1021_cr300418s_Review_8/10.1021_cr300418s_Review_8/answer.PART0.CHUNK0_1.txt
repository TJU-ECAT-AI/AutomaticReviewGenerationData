1. Work has been conducted on same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) in various metal oxides. Computational and experimental studies have shown that doping with SVDs generally improves performance. However, there are no straightforward rules for predicting the effects of SVDs in catalysis, suggesting they should be tested, especially when tuning the properties of an already efficient catalyst. 

2. HVDs exhibit distinct behaviors in reducible versus irreducible oxides. In reducible oxides, high-valence dopants like W or Mo donate two electrons to reduce two Ce4+ ions, while in irreducible oxides, they behave differently, donating electrons to reduce Ce ions.

3. Different high-valence dopants, such as Ta or Nb, have varying abilities to reduce Ce4+ ions depending on their valence, acting as Lewis bases in the process.

4. High-valence dopants in irreducible oxides are treated differently from those in reducible oxides due to the nature of the host oxide. 

5. Calculations on other systems indicate that the activation of oxygen adsorbed on an HVD1 is generally possible, although fewer studies have examined this specific type of system. 

6. More calculations and experiments are required to confirm qualitative statements regarding the behavior of HVDs in reducible oxides.

7. The behavior of flexible-valence dopants, particularly those classified as FVDs, remains largely unknown, presenting challenges in formulating general rules for their effects. 

8. Classification of a V-dopant in a MeO2 host oxide as a flexible-valence dopant (FVD) arises from its ability to adopt multiple valences when bonding to oxygen.

9. Cr-doped ceria exhibits unusual behavior, with the system having six different geometries, differing by at most 0.26 eV from the lowest energy configuration. This includes structures that can bind five or four oxygen atoms, create pseudo oxygen vacancies, and reduce Ce ions, suggesting the compound might be a strong oxidant.

1. 在不同金属氧化物中，关于相同价态掺杂剂（SVD）和高价态掺杂剂（HVD）的工作已经进行了。计算和实验研究表明，使用SVD通常可以提高性能。然而，对于在催化应用中预测SVD的影响，没有简单的规则，因此它们应该被尝试，特别是在调整已有的高效催化剂的性质时。

2. 高价态掺杂剂在可还原和不可还原氧化物中的行为有所不同。在可还原氧化物中，如钨或钼这样的高价态掺杂剂会捐赠两个电子来减少四个铈离子；而在不可还原氧化物中，它们的行为则不同，捐赠电子以减少铈离子。

3. 不同的高价态掺杂剂，如钽或铌，具有不同的能力来减少铈离子，这取决于它们的价态，在过程中充当Lewis碱。

4. 对于不可还原氧化物中的高价态掺杂剂而言，由于氧化物本身的性质，它们需要被分别对待。

5. 其他系统的计算表明，吸附在HVD1上的氧的激活通常是可能的，尽管对这种特定类型系统的研究较少。

6. 确认高价态掺杂剂在可还原氧化物中的行为需要更多的计算和实验。

7. 关于灵活价态掺杂剂（FVD）的通用行为的知识仍然很少，这给制定它们效果的一般规则带来了挑战。

8. 将在MeO2宿主氧化物中的V掺杂剂分类为灵活价态掺杂剂（FVD）的原因在于它能够采用多种价态与氧结合。

9. Cr掺杂的CeO2表现出异常行为，该系统具有六个不同的几何形状，其能量最多相差0.26 eV从最低能量配置。这包括可以绑定五个或四个氧原子的结构，创建伪氧空位，并减少铈离子，这表明化合物可能是强氧化剂。
