10.1 Introduction: "In an irreducible oxide (e.g., ZnO), a high-valence dopant, such as Al, has one excess electron (two out of the three valence electrons of Al are used to replace Zn2+)."
10.2 HVDs in Irreducible Oxides: "Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO."
10.3 HVDs in Reducible Oxides: "By definition, the cation in a reducible oxide (e.g., CeO2, TiO2) can easily change its formal charge while interacting with electron-donating species (Lewis bases)."
10.4 The Stability of High-Valence Dopants: "Consider a high-valence dopant that forms a very stable oxide (e.g., Ta, Nb, La) with a high coordination to oxygen."
11 Same-Valence Dopants (SVDs) and Flexible-Valence Dopants (FVDs): "We define the valence of a dopant by examining the stoichiometry of its stable oxides, we cannot assign a unique valence to dopants that have several stable oxides."

High-valence dopants (HVDs) have a significant impact on the chemistry of the host oxide, depending on whether the host is reducible or not. In irreducible oxides, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), a high-valence dopant introduces an excess electron that localizes on the dopant, making it a Lewis base. This affects the chemistry of the oxide, particularly in terms of its interaction with oxygen and the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. In reducible oxides, like ceria (CeO2), high-valence dopants can donate their excess electrons to reduce Ce ions in the host oxide. This behavior is distinct from that observed in irreducible oxides. The stability of high-valence dopants is influenced by their interaction with the host oxide, particularly in cases where the dopant forms a very stable oxide with a high coordination to oxygen. In contrast, same-valence dopants (SVDs) generally improve the properties of the host oxide, leading to enhanced performance in catalytic applications. Flexible-valence dopants (FVDs), due to their ability to adopt multiple valences, pose challenges in predicting their behavior, especially in reducible oxides, and require further computational and experimental investigation.

在不可还原氧化物（如锌氧化物）中，高电荷掺杂剂引入一个多余的电子，该电子局部化在掺杂剂上，使其成为路易斯碱。这影响了氧化物的化学性质，特别是其与氧和Marsvan Krevelen机制的相互作用。在可还原氧化物（如铈氧化物）中，高电荷掺杂剂可以捐赠其多余的电子来减少铈离子。这种行为与在不可还原氧化物中的观察不同。高电荷掺杂剂的稳定性受其与宿主氧化物的相互作用的影响，特别是在掺杂剂形成与氧高配位的非常稳定的氧化物的情况下。相反，同电荷掺杂剂（SVD）通常改善宿主氧化物的性质，导致催化应用中的性能增强。灵活电荷掺杂剂（FVD）由于其能够采用多种电荷状态，对预测其行为构成了挑战，尤其是在可还原氧化物中，并需要进一步的计算和实验研究。
