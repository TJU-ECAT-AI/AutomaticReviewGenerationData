[1] "Same a bit of work has been devoted to the situation when the dopant and the cation being substituted have the same valence."
[2] "All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."
[3] "In all cases, doping with an SVD improves performance."
[4] "There is no a priori answer to this question."
[5] "This is why we classify a V-dopant in a MeO2 host oxide as being a flexible-valence dopant (FVD)."
[6] "This system has very peculiar behavior."
[7] "Both the CrO4 and the CrO5 structures adsorb oxygen from the gas phase, and the reaction is exoergic by 1 eV for CrO4 and 0.7 eV for CrO5."
[8] "More computational and experimental work is needed for clarifying the behavior of these systems."

1. Work has been conducted to study the impact of same-valence dopants (SVDs) on metal oxides, revealing that these dopants generally enhance the properties of the host oxide. Doping with SVDs typically results in improved performance across various catalytic applications.
2. The classification of a V-dopant in a MeO2 host oxide as a flexible-valence dopant (FVD) arises due to the versatility of vanadium in forming multiple stable oxides with varying valences.
3. Cr-doped ceria exhibits a unique behavior characterized by the coexistence of Ce3+, Ce4+, Cr4+, and Cr6+ ions. This system is notable for its ability to store excess oxygen, which might explain the observed stoichiometric formula of the compound.
4. The behavior of flexible-valence dopants, particularly in reducible oxides, presents challenges in formulating general predictive rules due to their variable valence states and the complexity of interactions within the host oxide.

1. 对于相同价态掺杂剂（SVD）对金属氧化物的影响的研究工作已经开展，结果表明这些掺杂剂通常能改善宿主氧化物的性质。掺杂SVD时，性能普遍得到提升。
2. 将V掺杂剂分类为在MeO2宿主氧化物中作为可变价掺杂剂（FVD），是由于V原子能够形成多种稳定氧化物，并具有不同的价态。
3. Cr掺杂的铈氧化物表现出独特的行为，包括铈3+、铈4+、Cr4+和Cr6+离子共存。该系统因其能够存储过剩氧的能力而著名，这可能解释了所观察到的化合物的化学式。
4. 对于可还原氧化物中的可变价掺杂剂的行为，由于它们的多变价态以及与宿主氧化物之间的复杂相互作用，很难制定出通用的预测规则。
