Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by enhancing their performance in various catalytic applications. SVDs tend to improve the properties of the host oxide, while the effect of HVDs is more complex and depends on the reducibility of the host oxide. For reducible oxides, HVDs can donate their excess electrons to reduce certain ions in the host oxide, altering its redox properties. For irreducible oxides, HVDs behave differently, acting as Lewis bases that can hinder oxidation processes. Flexible-valence dopants (FVDs), like Cr and V, can adopt multiple valences and exhibit unusual behaviors that challenge the formulation of general predictive rules due to their versatile nature and the influence of Lewis acid-base interactions. Computational and experimental studies continue to explore these complexities, aiming to clarify the behavior of these systems and develop more comprehensive guidelines for dopant selection and application in catalysis.

同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过改善不同金属氧化物的性能，在各种催化应用中影响催化特性。SVD倾向于提高宿氧化物的性能，而HVD的影响更为复杂，这取决于宿氧化物的可还原性。对于可还原氧化物，HVD可以捐赠其多余的电子来减少宿氧化物中的某些离子，改变其氧化还原性质。对于不可还原氧化物，HVD表现出不同的行为，作为Lewis碱基，可以阻碍氧化过程。灵活价态掺杂剂（FVD），如Cr和V，可以采用多种价态，并显示出复杂的性质，这使得制定通用预测规则变得具有挑战性，因为这些化合物的性质受到Lewis酸碱相互作用的影响。继续进行计算和实验研究，以探索这些复杂性并开发更全面的指导原则，用于选择和应用掺杂剂在催化领域。

1. Work has been conducted on same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) in various metal oxides. Computational and experimental studies have shown that doping with SVDs generally improves performance. However, there are no straightforward rules for predicting the effects of SVDs in catalysis, suggesting they should be tested, especially when tuning the properties of an already efficient catalyst. 

2. HVDs exhibit distinct behaviors in reducible versus irreducible oxides. In reducible oxides, high-valence dopants like W or Mo donate two electrons to reduce two Ce4+ ions, while in irreducible oxides, they behave differently, donating electrons to reduce Ce ions.

3. Different high-valence dopants, such as Ta or Nb, have varying abilities to reduce Ce4+ ions depending on their valence, acting as Lewis bases in the process.

4. High-valence dopants in irreducible oxides are treated differently from those in reducible oxides due to the nature of the host oxide. 

5. Calculations on other systems indicate that the activation of oxygen adsorbed on an HVD1 is generally possible, although fewer studies have examined this specific type of system. 

6. More calculations and experiments are required to confirm qualitative statements regarding the behavior of HVDs in reducible oxides.

7. The behavior of flexible-valence dopants, particularly those classified as FVDs, remains largely unknown, presenting challenges in formulating general rules for their effects. 

8. Classification of a V-dopant in a MeO2 host oxide as a flexible-valence dopant (FVD) arises from its ability to adopt multiple valences when bonding to oxygen.

9. Cr-doped ceria exhibits unusual behavior, with the system having six different geometries, differing by at most 0.26 eV from the lowest energy configuration. This includes structures that can bind five or four oxygen atoms, create pseudo oxygen vacancies, and reduce Ce ions, suggesting the compound might be a strong oxidant.

1. 在不同金属氧化物中，关于相同价态掺杂剂（SVD）和高价态掺杂剂（HVD）的工作已经进行了。计算和实验研究表明，使用SVD通常可以提高性能。然而，对于在催化应用中预测SVD的影响，没有简单的规则，因此它们应该被尝试，特别是在调整已有的高效催化剂的性质时。

2. 高价态掺杂剂在可还原和不可还原氧化物中的行为有所不同。在可还原氧化物中，如钨或钼这样的高价态掺杂剂会捐赠两个电子来减少四个铈离子；而在不可还原氧化物中，它们的行为则不同，捐赠电子以减少铈离子。

3. 不同的高价态掺杂剂，如钽或铌，具有不同的能力来减少铈离子，这取决于它们的价态，在过程中充当Lewis碱。

4. 对于不可还原氧化物中的高价态掺杂剂而言，由于氧化物本身的性质，它们需要被分别对待。

5. 其他系统的计算表明，吸附在HVD1上的氧的激活通常是可能的，尽管对这种特定类型系统的研究较少。

6. 确认高价态掺杂剂在可还原氧化物中的行为需要更多的计算和实验。

7. 关于灵活价态掺杂剂（FVD）的通用行为的知识仍然很少，这给制定它们效果的一般规则带来了挑战。

8. 将在MeO2宿主氧化物中的V掺杂剂分类为灵活价态掺杂剂（FVD）的原因在于它能够采用多种价态与氧结合。

9. Cr掺杂的CeO2表现出异常行为，该系统具有六个不同的几何形状，其能量最多相差0.26 eV从最低能量配置。这包括可以绑定五个或四个氧原子的结构，创建伪氧空位，并减少铈离子，这表明化合物可能是强氧化剂。

10.1 Introduction: "In an irreducible oxide (e.g., ZnO), a high-valence dopant, such as Al, has one excess electron (two out of the three valence electrons of Al are used to replace Zn2+)."
10.2 HVDs in Irreducible Oxides: "Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO."
10.3 HVDs in Reducible Oxides: "By definition, the cation in a reducible oxide (e.g., CeO2, TiO2) can easily change its formal charge while interacting with electron-donating species (Lewis bases)."
10.4 The Stability of High-Valence Dopants: "Consider a high-valence dopant that forms a very stable oxide (e.g., Ta, Nb, La) with a high coordination to oxygen."
11 Same-Valence Dopants (SVDs) and Flexible-Valence Dopants (FVDs): "We define the valence of a dopant by examining the stoichiometry of its stable oxides, we cannot assign a unique valence to dopants that have several stable oxides."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
High-valence dopants (HVDs) have a significant impact on the chemistry of the host oxide, depending on whether the host is reducible or not. In irreducible oxides, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), a high-valence dopant introduces an excess electron that localizes on the dopant, making it a Lewis base. This affects the chemistry of the oxide, particularly in terms of its interaction with oxygen and the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. In reducible oxides, like ceria (CeO2), high-valence dopants can donate their excess electrons to reduce Ce ions in the host oxide. This behavior is distinct from that observed in irreducible oxides. The stability of high-valence dopants is influenced by their interaction with the host oxide, particularly in cases where the dopant forms a very stable oxide with a high coordination to oxygen. In contrast, same-valence dopants (SVDs) generally improve the properties of the host oxide, leading to enhanced performance in catalytic applications. Flexible-valence dopants (FVDs), due to their ability to adopt multiple valences, pose challenges in predicting their behavior, especially in reducible oxides, and require further computational and experimental investigation.

在不可还原氧化物（如锌氧化物）中，高电荷掺杂剂引入一个多余的电子，该电子局部化在掺杂剂上，使其成为路易斯碱。这影响了氧化物的化学性质，特别是其与氧和Marsvan Krevelen机制的相互作用。在可还原氧化物（如铈氧化物）中，高电荷掺杂剂可以捐赠其多余的电子来减少铈离子。这种行为与在不可还原氧化物中的观察不同。高电荷掺杂剂的稳定性受其与宿主氧化物的相互作用的影响，特别是在掺杂剂形成与氧高配位的非常稳定的氧化物的情况下。相反，同电荷掺杂剂（SVD）通常改善宿主氧化物的性质，导致催化应用中的性能增强。灵活电荷掺杂剂（FVD）由于其能够采用多种电荷状态，对预测其行为构成了挑战，尤其是在可还原氧化物中，并需要进一步的计算和实验研究。

10.1 Introduction
"The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not."
10.2 HVDs in Irreducible Oxides
"Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO. They showed that all HVDs increased the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant."
10.3 HVDs in Reducible Oxides
"Very few calculations have examined this kind of system. They allow us to make some guesses and extrapolations, but they need to be reinforced (or modified) by further work."
10.4 The Stability of High-Valence Dopants
"One would suspect that such a dopant in contact with gas-phase oxygen might prefer to leave the cationic site, move on top of the surface, and adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to form an oxide cluster."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
High-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides based on the reducibility of the host oxide. In irreducible oxides, HVDs can increase the energy required for removing a surface oxygen atom near the dopant, potentially hindering oxidation. In reducible oxides, HVDs can donate electrons to reduce host ions, affecting the redox properties. However, the effects of HVDs are complex and require further investigation, as computational models often provide only preliminary insights that need to be validated experimentally. The stability of HVDs in contact with gas-phase oxygen is another challenge, as they may segregate from the cationic site to form oxide clusters. These phenomena contribute to the difficulty in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in catalysis, particularly in reducible oxides, where the interplay between Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide significantly influences the outcomes.

高价掺杂剂（HVD）对不同金属氧化物的催化性质的影响取决于宿主氧化物的可还原性。在不可还原氧化物中，HVD可以增加移除靠近掺杂剂的表面氧原子所需的能量，可能阻碍氧化。在可还原氧化物中，HVD可以捐赠电子来减少宿主离子，影响氧化还原性质。然而，HVD的作用机制复杂，需要进一步的研究，因为计算模型通常仅提供初步见解，这些见解需要通过实验验证。HVD与气体相氧气接触时的稳定性也是一个挑战，它们可能会从阳离子位点分离形成氧化物簇。这些现象加剧了在催化领域制定通用预测规则的难度，特别是在可还原氧化物中，Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质之间的相互作用显著影响结果。
