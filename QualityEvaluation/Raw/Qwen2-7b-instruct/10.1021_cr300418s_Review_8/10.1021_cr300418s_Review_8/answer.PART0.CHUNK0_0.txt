Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by enhancing their performance in various catalytic applications. SVDs tend to improve the properties of the host oxide, while the effect of HVDs is more complex and depends on the reducibility of the host oxide. For reducible oxides, HVDs can donate their excess electrons to reduce certain ions in the host oxide, altering its redox properties. For irreducible oxides, HVDs behave differently, acting as Lewis bases that can hinder oxidation processes. Flexible-valence dopants (FVDs), like Cr and V, can adopt multiple valences and exhibit unusual behaviors that challenge the formulation of general predictive rules due to their versatile nature and the influence of Lewis acid-base interactions. Computational and experimental studies continue to explore these complexities, aiming to clarify the behavior of these systems and develop more comprehensive guidelines for dopant selection and application in catalysis.

同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过改善不同金属氧化物的性能，在各种催化应用中影响催化特性。SVD倾向于提高宿氧化物的性能，而HVD的影响更为复杂，这取决于宿氧化物的可还原性。对于可还原氧化物，HVD可以捐赠其多余的电子来减少宿氧化物中的某些离子，改变其氧化还原性质。对于不可还原氧化物，HVD表现出不同的行为，作为Lewis碱基，可以阻碍氧化过程。灵活价态掺杂剂（FVD），如Cr和V，可以采用多种价态，并显示出复杂的性质，这使得制定通用预测规则变得具有挑战性，因为这些化合物的性质受到Lewis酸碱相互作用的影响。继续进行计算和实验研究，以探索这些复杂性并开发更全面的指导原则，用于选择和应用掺杂剂在催化领域。
