[1] "Given the importance of ceria, and particularly of ceria-zirconia solutions, it is surprising that our fundamental understanding of the redox properties of these and related materials is rather poor."
[2] "The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria powders prepared at low temperatures with relatively high surface areas were found to be indistinguishable from the thermodynamic properties of high-temperature-calcined ceria reported in the literature."
[3] "Unlike pure ceria, all of the solid solutions contained weakly bound oxygen that could be removed at relatively high PO2 values, inaccessible through the use of H2/H2O mixtures."
[4] "Although the solid solutions remained in the cubic structure following reduction, there is evidence in the oxidation isotherms for oxygen stoichiometries having particularly high stabilities (i.e., Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.90; Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.87.)."

Ceria and ceria-zirconia solid solutions exhibit distinct redox properties compared to pure ceria. The thermodynamic properties of ceria powders, irrespective of their surface area or calcination temperature, closely resemble those reported in the literature. However, ceria-zirconia solutions show enhanced reducibility, indicating the presence of weakly bound oxygen that can be removed at high oxygen fugacity levels, which is beyond the capabilities of hydrogen/hydrogen oxide mixtures. Moreover, there are specific oxygen stoichiometries in these solutions that display exceptional stability during oxidation processes.

与纯铈相比，铈锆固溶体显示出不同的电化学性质。低温度下制备的铈粉末与高温煅烧后铈粉末的热力学还原性质在文献中报告的性质上几乎没有区别。然而，铈锆固溶体表现出增强的可还原性，表明存在可以被高氧化物分压去除的弱结合氧，这超出了氢/氢氧化物混合物的能力。此外，在氧化过程中，这些溶液中存在特别稳定的氧化学计量比（例如，Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.90；Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.87）。
