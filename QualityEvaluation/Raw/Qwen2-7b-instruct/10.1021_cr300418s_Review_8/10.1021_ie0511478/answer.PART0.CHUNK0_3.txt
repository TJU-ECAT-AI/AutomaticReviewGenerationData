[1] "Given the importance of ceria, and particularly of ceria-zirconia solutions, it is surprising that our fundamental understanding of the redox properties of these and related materials is rather poor."
[2] "Surprisingly, no evidence was found for differences in the redox properties associated with surface oxygen."
[3] "Unlike pure ceria, all of the solid solutions contained weakly bound oxygen that could be removed at relatively high PO2 values, inaccessible through the use of H2/H2O mixtures."
[4] "The properties of ceria and ceria-zirconia solid solutions were found to be very different from those of pure ceria."
[5] "There is evidence in the oxidation isotherms for oxygen stoichiometries having particularly high stabilities."

The document explores the thermodynamic redox properties of ceria and ceria-zirconia solid solutions, revealing that these mixed oxides have distinct characteristics compared to pure ceria. The study indicates that the redox properties are influenced by the oxide composition, not by the surface area or calcination temperature, as long as the phase of the mixed oxide remains unchanged. The research highlights that the solid solutions can release oxygen at higher partial oxygen pressures than pure ceria, and they exhibit different reduction behaviors. Furthermore, the document suggests that certain oxygen states in the solid solutions are more stable than in pure ceria, which could have implications for catalytic applications.

文档研究了氧化铈和氧化铈锆固溶体的热力学氧化还原性质，发现这些混合氧化物与纯氧化铈具有不同的特性。研究表明，氧化性质受氧化物组成的控制，而不是表面面积或煅烧温度，只要混合氧化物的相态不变。研究显示，固溶体可以在比纯氧化铈更高的部分氧压力下释放氧，并表现出不同的还原行为。此外，文档表明，固溶体中的某些氧状态比纯氧化铈更为稳定，这可能对催化应用有影响。
