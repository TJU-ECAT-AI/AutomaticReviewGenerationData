[1] "Surprisingly, no evidence was found for differences in the redox properties associated with surface oxygen."
[2] "The thermodynamic redox properties were found to be a strong function of composition but were independent of surface area or calcination temperature, as long as calcination did not affect the phase of the mixed oxide."
[3] "Unlike pure ceria, all of the solid solutions contained weakly bound oxygen that could be removed at relatively high PO2 values, inaccessible through the use of H2/H2O mixtures."
[4] "The properties of ceriazirconia solid solutions were found to be very different from those of pure ceria."
[5] "Although the solid solutions remained in the cubic structure following reduction, there is evidence in the oxidation isotherms for oxygen stoichiometries having particularly high stabilities (i.e., Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.90; Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.87.)."

1. The redox properties of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) in metal oxides are influenced by their ability to introduce weakly bound oxygen that can be removed at high oxygen fugacity (PO2) values, which is not accessible through traditional methods like H2/H2O mixtures. This leads to distinct catalytic behaviors compared to the parent metal oxide.

2. The thermodynamic redox properties of dopants are highly dependent on the chemical composition of the oxide but are independent of the surface area or calcination temperature, provided the calcination process does not alter the phase of the mixed oxide. This contrasts with the kinetic aspects of reduction, which are influenced by surface area and the presence of a catalyst.

3. High-valence dopants significantly enhance the reducibility of ceria, leading to the removal of oxygen at high PO2 values, which is not observed in pure ceria. This results in differential enthalpy changes for deep reduction that are notably lower than those for pure ceria.

4. Ceria-zirconia solid solutions exhibit markedly different redox properties from pure ceria, characterized by the presence of oxygen with unusually high stability at specific stoichiometries, such as Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.90 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.87.

5. Despite the stability of the cubic structure post-reduction, there are evident high-stability oxygen stoichiometries in ceria-zirconia solid solutions, such as Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.90 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.87, which contribute to their unique catalytic properties.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）在金属氧化物中的还原性质受到其引入的弱结合氧的影响，这种氧可以在高氧化势（PO2）值下被去除，这不能通过传统的氢气/水混合物方法实现。这导致了与母体金属氧化物相比的特殊催化行为。

2. 掺杂的热力学还原性质高度依赖于化学组成，但与表面面积或煅烧温度无关，前提是煅烧过程不会改变混合氧化物的相态。这与减缓方面的反应动力学不同，后者受表面面积和催化剂的存在影响。

3. 高价掺杂剂显著增强了铈的可还原性，导致在高PO2值下可以去除氧，这是纯铈中未观察到的现象。这导致深层还原的焓差明显低于纯铈。

4. 铈锆固溶体显示出与纯铈截然不同的还原性质，特征是具有特定稳定性的氧含量，如Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.90和Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.87，这有助于它们独特的催化特性。

5. 尽管减去后的立方结构保持稳定，但在铈锆固溶体中仍然存在明显的高稳定性氧含量，如Ce0.81Zr0.19O1.90和Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.87，这些都对它们的催化性能有贡献。
