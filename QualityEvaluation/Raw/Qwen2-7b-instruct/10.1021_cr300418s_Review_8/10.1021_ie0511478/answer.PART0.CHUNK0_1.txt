[1] "Surprisingly, no evidence was found for differences in the redox properties associated with surface oxygen."
[2] "The thermodynamic redox properties were found to be a strong function of composition but were independent of surface area or calcination temperature, as long as calcination did not affect the phase of the mixed oxide."
[3] "Unlike pure ceria, all of the solid solutions contained weakly bound oxygen that could be removed at relatively high PO2 values, inaccessible through the use of H2/H2O mixtures."
[4] "The properties of ceriazirconia solid solutions were found to be very different from those of pure ceria."

1. The study revealed that the redox properties of surface oxygen in ceria powders prepared at low temperatures with high surface areas are indistinguishable from those of high-temperature-calcined ceria. No differences in redox properties due to surface oxygen were observed.

2. The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria and ceriazirconia solid solutions are significantly influenced by the composition of the materials, rather than their surface area or calcination temperature, provided the calcination process does not alter the phase of the mixed oxide.

3. Contrary to pure ceria, all ceriazirconia solid solutions possess weakly bound oxygen that can be removed at high oxygen fugacity (PO2) values, which are not achievable using hydrogen/hydrogen peroxide mixtures. This indicates that the solid solutions are more easily reduced than pure ceria.

4. The study found that the redox properties of ceriazirconia solid solutions are markedly different from those of pure ceria. The solutions exhibit unique characteristics, such as the presence of weakly bound oxygen that can be removed at high PO2 values.

1. 研究发现，低温高表面活性剂制备的铈粉的氧化还原性质与高温煅烧铈粉的性质并无显著差异。没有发现与表面氧相关的氧化还原性质变化。

2. 铈和铈锆固溶体的氧化还原性质主要取决于其组成，而与表面积或煅烧温度无关，只要煅烧过程不影响混合氧化物的相态。

3. 相对于纯铈，所有铈锆固溶体都含有结合力较弱的氧，可以在较高的氧逸度（PO2）值下被去除，这在使用氢/过氧化氢混合物的情况下是无法实现的。这表明固溶体比纯铈更容易还原。

4. 研究发现，铈锆固溶体的氧化还原性质与纯铈大不相同。这些溶液展现出独特的特性，如存在可以被高PO2值去除的结合力较弱的氧。
