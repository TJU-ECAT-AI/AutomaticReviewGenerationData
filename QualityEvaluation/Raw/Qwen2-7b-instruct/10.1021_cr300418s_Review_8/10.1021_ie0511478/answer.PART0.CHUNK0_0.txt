[1] "Surprisingly, no evidence was found for differences in the redox properties associated with surface oxygen."
[2] "The thermodynamic redox properties were found to be a strong function of composition but were independent of surface area or calcination temperature, as long as calcination did not affect the phase of the mixed oxide."
[3] "Unlike pure ceria, all of the solid solutions contained weakly bound oxygen that could be removed at relatively high PO2 values, inaccessible through the use of H2/H2O mixtures."
[4] "The properties of ceriazirconia solid solutions were found to be very different from those of pure ceria."

1. The study revealed that the redox properties of ceria powders prepared at low temperatures with high surface areas are similar to those of high-temperature-calcined ceria. There is no discernible difference in redox properties related to surface oxygen.
2. The thermodynamic redox properties are highly dependent on the composition of the ceria-zirconia solid solutions, but are not influenced by the surface area or calcination temperature, provided that the calcination process does not alter the phase of the mixed oxide. This contrasts with the reduction kinetics, which is significantly affected by surface area and the presence of a catalyst.
3. The ceria-zirconia solid solutions exhibit distinct redox properties compared to pure ceria. Specifically, they contain weakly bound oxygen that can be removed at high oxygen fugacity levels, which is beyond the reach of H2/H2O mixtures.
4. The redox properties of ceria-zirconia solid solutions differ markedly from those of pure ceria. The solid solutions maintain their cubic structure post-reduction and display oxygen stoichiometries with exceptional stability.

1. 研究发现，低温制备、高表面积的铈粉的氧化还原性质与高温煅烧的铈粉相似。没有发现与表面氧有关的氧化还原性质差异。
2. 氧化还原性质在很大程度上依赖于混合氧化物的组成，但不受表面面积或煅烧温度的影响，只要煅烧过程不影响混合氧化物的相态。这与反应速率有显著不同，后者受表面面积和催化剂存在的影响很大。
3. 铈锆复合氧化物显示出与纯铈截然不同的氧化还原性质。具体而言，它们包含可被较高氧气分压去除的弱结合氧，该水平远超H2/H2O混合物所能达到的。
4. 铈锆复合氧化物的氧化还原性质与纯铈有很大区别。这些复合氧化物在还原后保持立方结构，并显示具有特别高稳定性的氧化学计量比。
