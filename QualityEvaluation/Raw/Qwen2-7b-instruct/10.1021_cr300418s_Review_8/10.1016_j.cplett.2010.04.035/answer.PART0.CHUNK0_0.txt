<p>Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19].</p>
<p>Our approach is the following: we use DFT + U (U = 5 eV [3]) and HSE06 to study the Ta and Nb doped (1 1 0) surface and show that DFT + U provides a consistent description of the resulting Ce3+ de- fect, with one Ce3+ ion being formed.</p>
<p>The choice of U in the present Letter is sufficient to describe localised Ce3+ and is used throughout.</p>
<p>At the undoped surface, NO2 does not react, but NO2 reacts with the Ce3+ present at the doped surface, showing that Ce3+ species are needed to activate NO2.</p>
<p>In Fig. 1 we show the structure of the (1 1 0) ceria surface doped with Ta (Fig. 1a) and Nb (Fig. 1b) from the HSE06 calculations (the DFT + U picture is little changed and is shown in the Supporting information).</p>
<p>Thus DFT + U and HSE06 give similar structural changes upon doping of the ceria surface with Ta and Nb.</p>
<p>For Nb, DFT + U places the Ce 4f state very close to the top of the VB, while HSE06 positions this state 1.5 eV above the valence band edge.</p>
<p>For Ta doping, the offset from the valence band edge to the gap state is 1.5 eV with DFT + U and 2.2 eV with HSE06.</p>
<p>With DFT + U giving a consistent description of the for- mation of Ce3+ from Ta and Nb doping, we have carried out a DFT + U calculation of NO2 adsorption at the defect-free, undoped (1 1 0) surface and find no interaction between the molecule and the oxide.</p>
<p>The final adsorption structures are shown in Fig. 3. The adsorption energies show a gain of 0.87 eV (Ta) and 0.73 eV (Nb), indicating favourable adsorption of NO2 and a reasonably strong interaction.</p>

The document discusses how doping with same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influences the catalytic properties of ceria. Specifically, doping with +5 cations like Ta and Nb results in the formation of Ce3+ ions on the ceria surface, which activates the surface for NO2 reduction. The computational studies using DFT + U and HSE06 methods show that these dopants induce structural changes, including distortions around the dopant atoms and the creation of localized Ce3+ ions. The presence of Ce3+ ions is crucial for the activation of NO2, facilitating its dissociation and subsequent reduction to nitrogen and oxygen. The challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the specific interactions between dopants and the host oxide, as well as the role of Lewis acid-base interactions in determining catalytic performance.

In summary, doping strategies offer a more controlled means of introducing Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation, which is typically the conventional method for creating Ce3+ in ceria. This controlled introduction of Ce3+ through doping enhances the catalytic properties of ceria, particularly in terms of NO2 reduction. However, formulating universal rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of interactions within the system.

The document also highlights that while DFT + U and HSE06 provide consistent descriptions of the Ce3+ defect formation, there are slight differences in the positioning of the Ce 4f state within the bandgap, with HSE06 generally predicting a higher position compared to DFT + U. This difference could have implications for the electronic properties and, by extension, the catalytic performance of the doped ceria surfaces.

In terms of catalytic applications, the presence of Ce3+ ions on the ceria surface acts as an effective catalyst for NO2 reduction, demonstrating the potential of dopant-based strategies to enhance the reactivity and selectivity of metal oxides in catalytic processes. The computational studies support the idea that doping with high-valence cations can be a viable and potentially more controlled alternative to traditional oxygen vacancy formation for generating Ce3+ ions with enhanced catalytic activity.

文档讨论了同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对氧化铈催化性能的影响。具体来说，掺杂+5价离子如Ta和Nb导致铈在氧化铈表面形成Ce3+离子，激活表面以进行NO2还原。使用DFT + U和HSE06方法的计算研究表明，这些掺杂剂会引起结构变化，包括掺杂原子周围的畸变以及局部Ce3+离子的形成。Ce3+离子的存在对于激活NO2至关重要，促进其分解并随后还原为氮和氧。

确定掺杂行为通用预测规则的挑战包括理解掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间的特定相互作用，以及Lewis酸碱相互作用在确定催化性能中的作用。

简而言之，掺杂策略提供了一种比通过氧气空位形成更受控的方法来引入Ce3+离子。这种受控的Ce3+离子通过掺杂增强了铈的催化性能，特别是在NO2还原方面。然而，由于系统中交互复杂性，制定普遍的掺杂行为规则仍然具有挑战性。

总结而言，在催化剂应用中，铈表面存在的Ce3+离子作为NO2还原的有效催化剂，证明了基于掺杂策略增强金属氧化物催化性能的潜力。计算研究支持高价离子掺杂可以作为传统氧气空位形成的一种可行且可能更加受控的替代方法，用于生成具有增强催化活性的Ce3+离子。

此外，DFT + U和HSE06在描述Ce3+缺陷形成时提供了一致的描述，但它们在带隙中Ce 4f状态的位置上有细微差异，HSE06通常预测的位置较高。这种差异可能会影响电子性质，并进一步影响掺杂铈表面的催化性能。
