<p>Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19].</p>
<p>Our approach is the following: we use DFT + U (U = 5 eV [3]) and HSE06 to study the Ta and Nb doped (1 1 0) surface and show that DFT + U provides a consistent description of the resulting Ce3+ de- fect, with one Ce3+ ion being formed.</p>
<p>The choice of U in the present Letter is sufficient to describe localised Ce3+ and is used throughout.</p>
<p>At the undoped surface, NO2 does not react, but NO2 reacts with the Ce3+ present at the doped surface, showing that Ce3+ species are needed to activate NO2.</p>
<p>In Fig. 1 we show the structure of the (1 1 0) ceria surface doped with Ta (Fig. 1a) and Nb (Fig. 1b) from the HSE06 calculations (the DFT + U picture is little changed and is shown in the Supporting information).</p>
<p>Thus DFT + U and HSE06 give similar structural changes upon doping of the ceria surface with Ta and Nb.</p>
<p>For Nb, DFT + U places the Ce 4f state very close to the top of the VB, while HSE06 positions this state 1.5 eV above the valence band edge.</p>
<p>For Ta doping, the offset from the valence band edge to the gap state is 1.5 eV with DFT + U and 2.2 eV with HSE06.</p>
<p>With DFT + U giving a consistent description of the for- mation of Ce3+ from Ta and Nb doping, we have carried out a DFT + U calculation of NO2 adsorption at the defect-free, undoped (1 1 0) surface and find no interaction between the molecule and the oxide.</p>
<p>The final adsorption structures are shown in Fig. 3. The adsorption energies show a gain of 0.87 eV (Ta) and 0.73 eV (Nb), indicating favourable adsorption of NO2 and a reasonably strong interaction.</p>

The document discusses how doping with same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influences the catalytic properties of ceria. Specifically, doping with +5 cations like Ta and Nb results in the formation of Ce3+ ions on the ceria surface, which activates the surface for NO2 reduction. The computational studies using DFT + U and HSE06 methods show that these dopants induce structural changes, including distortions around the dopant atoms and the creation of localized Ce3+ ions. The presence of Ce3+ ions is crucial for the activation of NO2, facilitating its dissociation and subsequent reduction to nitrogen and oxygen. The challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include understanding the specific interactions between dopants and the host oxide, as well as the role of Lewis acid-base interactions in determining catalytic performance.

In summary, doping strategies offer a more controlled means of introducing Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation, which is typically the conventional method for creating Ce3+ in ceria. This controlled introduction of Ce3+ through doping enhances the catalytic properties of ceria, particularly in terms of NO2 reduction. However, formulating universal rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of interactions within the system.

The document also highlights that while DFT + U and HSE06 provide consistent descriptions of the Ce3+ defect formation, there are slight differences in the positioning of the Ce 4f state within the bandgap, with HSE06 generally predicting a higher position compared to DFT + U. This difference could have implications for the electronic properties and, by extension, the catalytic performance of the doped ceria surfaces.

In terms of catalytic applications, the presence of Ce3+ ions on the ceria surface acts as an effective catalyst for NO2 reduction, demonstrating the potential of dopant-based strategies to enhance the reactivity and selectivity of metal oxides in catalytic processes. The computational studies support the idea that doping with high-valence cations can be a viable and potentially more controlled alternative to traditional oxygen vacancy formation for generating Ce3+ ions with enhanced catalytic activity.

文档讨论了同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对氧化铈催化性能的影响。具体来说，掺杂+5价离子如Ta和Nb导致铈在氧化铈表面形成Ce3+离子，激活表面以进行NO2还原。使用DFT + U和HSE06方法的计算研究表明，这些掺杂剂会引起结构变化，包括掺杂原子周围的畸变以及局部Ce3+离子的形成。Ce3+离子的存在对于激活NO2至关重要，促进其分解并随后还原为氮和氧。

确定掺杂行为通用预测规则的挑战包括理解掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间的特定相互作用，以及Lewis酸碱相互作用在确定催化性能中的作用。

简而言之，掺杂策略提供了一种比通过氧气空位形成更受控的方法来引入Ce3+离子。这种受控的Ce3+离子通过掺杂增强了铈的催化性能，特别是在NO2还原方面。然而，由于系统中交互复杂性，制定普遍的掺杂行为规则仍然具有挑战性。

总结而言，在催化剂应用中，铈表面存在的Ce3+离子作为NO2还原的有效催化剂，证明了基于掺杂策略增强金属氧化物催化性能的潜力。计算研究支持高价离子掺杂可以作为传统氧气空位形成的一种可行且可能更加受控的替代方法，用于生成具有增强催化活性的Ce3+离子。

此外，DFT + U和HSE06在描述Ce3+缺陷形成时提供了一致的描述，但它们在带隙中Ce 4f状态的位置上有细微差异，HSE06通常预测的位置较高。这种差异可能会影响电子性质，并进一步影响掺杂铈表面的催化性能。

1. The formation of Ce3+ ions plays a crucial role in the catalytic properties of ceria, particularly in processes like CO oxidation and NOx reduction. These ions are essential for the effectiveness of ceria in these applications. 

2. High-valence dopants, such as Ta and Nb, are capable of introducing Ce3+ ions into ceria. This occurs through the donation of electrons from the dopants to oxygen atoms, leaving an extra electron that is accommodated by the formation of a localized Ce3+ ion. This strategy offers a more controlled method for generating Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation.

3. The presence of Ce3+ ions at the oxide surface is critical for activating NO2. This activation is achieved through a process of charge transfer from the Ce3+ ion to the NO2 molecule, which weakens one NO bond and initiates the dissociation of NO2 to NO and oxygen.

4. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in metal oxides include understanding the complex interplay between dopant-lattice interactions, the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), and the specific catalytic application. The role of Lewis acid-base interactions is also significant, affecting the stability and reactivity of dopants within the oxide matrix.

5. Doping strategies involving the use of high oxidation state cations can be considered more controllable for introducing Ce3+ ions into metal oxides. This approach allows for the creation of active sites for molecular reduction, offering an alternative to the formation of oxygen vacancies.

1. Ce3+离子在铈氧化物的应用中起着关键作用，特别是在CO氧化和NOx还原过程中。这些离子对于这些应用的有效性至关重要。

2. 高价掺杂剂，如Ta和Nb，能够将Ce3+离子引入铈氧化物。这一过程通过掺杂剂向氧原子捐赠电子来实现，留下一个额外的电子，从而形成局部化的Ce3+离子。这种方法提供了一种比氧空位形成更可控的方法来生成Ce3+离子。

3. 硫酸根离子的存在对于激活NO2至关重要。这种激活是通过从Ce3+离子到NO2分子的电荷转移实现的，这会减弱一个NO键，并启动NO2的分解为NO和氧气。

4. 形成一般预测规则的挑战包括理解掺杂剂与晶格之间的相互作用、宿主氧化物（可还原性与不可还原性）的性质以及特定催化应用的复杂性。Lewis酸碱相互作用的作用也非常重要，影响掺杂剂在氧化物矩阵中的稳定性和活性。

5. 采用高价阳离子的掺杂策略可以考虑更可控地将Ce3+离子引入金属氧化物中。这种方法允许在氧化物表面创建用于分子还原的活性位点，提供了一种替代氧空位形成的方法。

The study discusses the role of substitutional doping with high-valence cations, specifically tantalum (Ta) and niobium (Nb), in creating cerium(III) (Ce3+) ions on the ceria (CeO2) (1 1 0) surface. These Ce3+ ions facilitate the activation of nitric oxide (NO2) molecules, allowing for their reduction to nitrogen (N2) via a charge transfer mechanism. The Ce3+ ions are crucial for this process, as they weaken one of the NO bonds in NO2, leading to its dissociation into NO and oxygen. This activation step is the initial stage in the reduction of NO2 to N2, highlighting the importance of Ce3+ ions in catalytic reactions involving ceria surfaces.
