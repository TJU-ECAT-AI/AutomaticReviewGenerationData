<p>In the introduction, it states: "Ceria is a widely used metal oxide in catalytic applications, well known examples include CO oxidation and NOx reduction [1,2]." This highlights the utility of ceria in catalytic processes, specifically CO oxidation and NOx reduction.</p>
<p>Another quote from the introduction: "The loss of oxygen facilitates CO oxidation [5-7], while the reduced Ce3+ remaining at the surface are active sites for adsorption of NOx [8], and the ultimate reduction to N2." This explains how ceria's reactivity arises from the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the role of Ce3+ in catalyzing NOx reduction.</p>
<p>The methods section states: "We use slab models of the (1 1 0) surface and a plane wave basis set to describe the valence electronic wave functions with the VASP code [26]." This describes the computational tools and methods used for the study.</p>
<p>In the results section, it mentions: "The adsorption energy of NO2 is given by Eads = EM0:036Ce1:964O2 NO2 EM0:036Ce1:964O2 ENO2." This equation represents the calculation of the adsorption energy of NO2 on the ceria surface.</p>
<p>The results section also includes: "In Fig. 1 we show the structure of the (1 1 0) ceria surface doped with Ta (Fig. 1a) and Nb (Fig. 1b) from the HSE06 calculations (the DFT + U picture is little changed and is shown in the Supporting information)." This describes the structural changes upon doping of the ceria surface with Ta and Nb.</p>
<p>Finally, the summary states: "Doping of ceria with high oxidation state cations is a novel and potentially more controlled means of generating Ce3+ ions that are active for molecular reduction, as compared to oxygen vacancy formation." This highlights the potential benefits of doping ceria with high oxidation state cations for catalytic applications.</p>

1. Ceria is widely used in catalytic applications, notably in CO oxidation and NOx reduction. The reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ facilitates CO oxidation, and Ce3+ at the surface acts as an active site for NOx adsorption leading to its ultimate reduction to nitrogen gas.
2. Computational tools like the VASP code with slab models of the (1 1 0) surface and plane wave basis sets were employed for the study.
3. The structure of the ceria surface upon doping with Ta and Nb was significantly altered, with distortions more pronounced for Ta than Nb.
4. The adsorption energy of NO2 on the ceria surface was calculated using a specific equation, indicating favorable adsorption upon doping.
5. Doping ceria with high oxidation state cations, like Ta and Nb, can generate Ce3+ ions in a more controlled manner compared to oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing its catalytic properties.

1. 氟化铈在催化应用中被广泛使用，特别在CO氧化和NOx还原方面。Ce4+还原为Ce3+促进了CO氧化，而表面的Ce3+作为NOx吸附的活性位点，最终将其还原为氮气。
2. 使用VASP代码、层模型和平面波基集等计算工具对（1 1 0）表面进行了研究。
3. 铌和钽掺杂后，氟化铈表面结构发生了显著改变，Ta引起的畸变更为明显，而Nb则较轻。
4. 计算了NO2在氟化铈表面的吸附能，表明掺杂后吸附是有利的。
5. 与氧空位形成相比，通过高氧化态阳离子掺杂氟化铈可以更可控地生成活性的Ce3+离子，增强其催化性能。
