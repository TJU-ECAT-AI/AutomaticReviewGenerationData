[1] "The formation of Ce3+ ions in CeO2 is key for its applications."
[2] "The loss of oxygen facilitates CO oxidation [57], while the reduced Ce3+ remaining at the surface are active sites for adsorption of NOx [8], and the ultimate reduction to N2."
[3] "We are interested in systems in which Ce3+ can be produced by doping, as an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation."
[4] "Doping of TiO2 with Ta and Nb produces a single reduced Ti3+ cation."
[5] "DFT + U provides a consistent description of the resulting Ce3+ defect, with one Ce3+ ion being formed."
[6] "At the undoped surface, NO2 does not react, but NO2 reacts with the Ce3+ present at the doped surface, showing that Ce3+ species are needed to activate NO2."

1. The formation of Ce3+ ions plays a crucial role in the catalytic properties of ceria, particularly in processes like CO oxidation and NOx reduction. These ions are essential for the effectiveness of ceria in these applications. 

2. High-valence dopants, such as Ta and Nb, are capable of introducing Ce3+ ions into ceria. This occurs through the donation of electrons from the dopants to oxygen atoms, leaving an extra electron that is accommodated by the formation of a localized Ce3+ ion. This strategy offers a more controlled method for generating Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation.

3. The presence of Ce3+ ions at the oxide surface is critical for activating NO2. This activation is achieved through a process of charge transfer from the Ce3+ ion to the NO2 molecule, which weakens one NO bond and initiates the dissociation of NO2 to NO and oxygen.

4. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in metal oxides include understanding the complex interplay between dopant-lattice interactions, the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), and the specific catalytic application. The role of Lewis acid-base interactions is also significant, affecting the stability and reactivity of dopants within the oxide matrix.

5. Doping strategies involving the use of high oxidation state cations can be considered more controllable for introducing Ce3+ ions into metal oxides. This approach allows for the creation of active sites for molecular reduction, offering an alternative to the formation of oxygen vacancies.

1. Ce3+离子在铈氧化物的应用中起着关键作用，特别是在CO氧化和NOx还原过程中。这些离子对于这些应用的有效性至关重要。

2. 高价掺杂剂，如Ta和Nb，能够将Ce3+离子引入铈氧化物。这一过程通过掺杂剂向氧原子捐赠电子来实现，留下一个额外的电子，从而形成局部化的Ce3+离子。这种方法提供了一种比氧空位形成更可控的方法来生成Ce3+离子。

3. 硫酸根离子的存在对于激活NO2至关重要。这种激活是通过从Ce3+离子到NO2分子的电荷转移实现的，这会减弱一个NO键，并启动NO2的分解为NO和氧气。

4. 形成一般预测规则的挑战包括理解掺杂剂与晶格之间的相互作用、宿主氧化物（可还原性与不可还原性）的性质以及特定催化应用的复杂性。Lewis酸碱相互作用的作用也非常重要，影响掺杂剂在氧化物矩阵中的稳定性和活性。

5. 采用高价阳离子的掺杂策略可以考虑更可控地将Ce3+离子引入金属氧化物中。这种方法允许在氧化物表面创建用于分子还原的活性位点，提供了一种替代氧空位形成的方法。
