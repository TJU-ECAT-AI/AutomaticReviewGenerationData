[1] "The formation of Ce3+ ions in CeO2 is key for its applications."
[2] "We present density functional theory (DFT) studies of doping of the CeO2 (1 1 0) surface with +5 cations, Ta and Nb, as a route to formation of Ce3+ ions."
[3] "Doping with Nb and Ta activates the surface to NO2 reduction  there is no interaction with the undoped surface but the Ce3+ ion in the doped surface interacts strongly with NO2."
[4] "The presence of the Ce3+ ions is key to activating NO2, by charge transfer from Ce3+ to the molecule, which weakens one NO bond and is the first step in dissociation to NO and oxygen."

The study discusses the role of substitutional doping with high-valence cations, specifically tantalum (Ta) and niobium (Nb), in creating cerium(III) (Ce3+) ions on the ceria (CeO2) (1 1 0) surface. These Ce3+ ions facilitate the activation of nitric oxide (NO2) molecules, allowing for their reduction to nitrogen (N2) via a charge transfer mechanism. The Ce3+ ions are crucial for this process, as they weaken one of the NO bonds in NO2, leading to its dissociation into NO and oxygen. This activation step is the initial stage in the reduction of NO2 to N2, highlighting the importance of Ce3+ ions in catalytic reactions involving ceria surfaces.

该研究探讨了用高价离子，具体为钽（Ta）和铌（Nb），在铈氧化物（CeO2）（1 1 0）表面掺杂形成铈（III）（Ce3+）离子的作用。这些Ce3+离子有助于激活二氧化氮（NO2）分子，并允许其还原为氮（N2）。Ce3+离子对于这一过程至关重要，因为它们削弱了NO2中的一条NO键，导致其分解成NO和氧气。这一激活步骤是将NO2还原为N2的初始阶段，突显了铈氧化物表面中Ce3+离子在催化反应中的重要性。
