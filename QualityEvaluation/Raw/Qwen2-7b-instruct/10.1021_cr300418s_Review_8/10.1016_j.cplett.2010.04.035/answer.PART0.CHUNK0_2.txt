[1] "Doping with Nb and Ta activates the surface to NO2 reduction...there is no interaction with the undoped surface but the Ce3+ ion in the doped surface interacts strongly with NO2."
[2] "Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19]."
[3] "Thus, DFT + U and HSE06 predict formation of the Ce 4f gap state, that this state is closer to the VB for Nb doping."
[4] "The adsorption energies show a gain of 0.87 eV (Ta) and 0.73 eV (Nb), indicating favourable adsorption of NO2 and a reasonably strong interaction."
[5] "Thus, the vital factor in the reduction of NO2 is the presence of Ce3+ ions at the oxide surface and the ease with which such ions can be reoxidised through charge transfer to an adsorbate."

1. Doping with Nb and Ta enhances the surface's capability for NO2 reduction. The Ce3+ ions in the doped surface strongly interact with NO2, unlike the undoped surface which shows no interaction.
2. Two Density Functional Theory (DFT) approaches were employed to study ceria: DFT + U, which corrects for on-site Coulomb interactions, and the HSE06 functional, a hybrid DFT method.
3. DFT + U and HSE06 both predict the formation of a Ce 4f state within the band gap, with this state being closer to the valence band edge for Nb doping.
4. The adsorption of NO2 on the doped surfaces (Ta and Nb) results in favorable interactions, with energies of 0.87 eV for Ta and 0.73 eV for Nb, indicating strong bonding.
5. The presence of Ce3+ ions on the oxide surface and their capacity for reoxidation through charge transfer to an adsorbate are crucial factors in the NO2 reduction process.

1. Nb和Ta的掺杂激活了表面的NO2还原能力。掺杂表面中的Ce3+离子与NO2强烈相互作用，而未掺杂表面则没有这种相互作用。
2. 为了研究氧化铈，应用了两种密度泛函理论（DFT）方法：通过在DFT中修正局域电荷相互作用的DFT + U方法和HSE06功能形式的混合DFT方法。
3. DFT + U和HSE06都预测了形成位于带隙内的Ce 4f状态，对于Nb掺杂，这个状态更接近价带边。
4. NO2在掺杂表面上（Ta和Nb）的吸附结果产生有利的相互作用，Ta为0.87 eV，Nb为0.73 eV，表明强烈的结合。
5. 氧化物表面的Ce3+离子的存在及其通过向吸附剂转移电荷进行再氧化的能力是NO2还原过程的关键因素。
