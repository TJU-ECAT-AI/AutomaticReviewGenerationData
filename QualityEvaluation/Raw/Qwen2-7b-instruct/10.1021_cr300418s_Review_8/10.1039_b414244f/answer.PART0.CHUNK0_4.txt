[1] "Despite the apparent simplicity of these systems, extreme variability of their chemical and textural properties has been observed."
[2] "An attempt is made here to rationalise the various factors and the inter-connections to the structure, the texture, and the effects of the nanometre scale, which all contribute to the properties of these materials."
[3] "This wide use of these systems as catalyst components prompted a renewed interest with regards to these materials in the form of nanosized, high surface area powders."
[4] "However, it has now became clear that both the chemistry of the simple oxides and the complex metalCeO2-based oxide interactions can play a critical role in developing novel and highly active materials for a number of processes, ranging from catalysts for H2 production from fuels up to ceramic materials and solid state conductors for fuel cells."
