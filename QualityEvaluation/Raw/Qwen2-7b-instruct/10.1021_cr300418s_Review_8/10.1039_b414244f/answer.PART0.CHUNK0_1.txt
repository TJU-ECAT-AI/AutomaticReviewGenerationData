[1] "Despite the apparent simplicity of these systems, extreme variability of their chemical and textural properties has been observed."
[2] "The possibility of producing redox nanomaterials with tuneable redox capability to activate simple reactants has recently been discussed."
[3] "An attempt is made here to rationalise the various factors and the inter-connections to the structure, the texture, and the effects of the nanometre scale, which all contribute to the properties of these materials."
[4] "However, it has now became clear that both the chemistry of the simple oxides and the complex metalCeO2-based oxide interactions can play a critical role in developing novel and highly active materials for a number of processes, ranging from catalysts for H2 production from fuels up to ceramic materials and solid state conductors for fuel cells."
[5] "Despite 50 years of investigations,2436 there are still disagreements on the phase diagram itself and its phase boundaries,3,37 besides problems related to structural aspects38 and chemical (redox) behaviour."
[6] "Furthermore,it has now become clearly evident that, due to the metastability of these systems, the processing of the sample, i.e. temperature and extent of reduction and oxidation that have been applied to the mixed oxide precursor, plays a key role in leading to systems possessing different structural and chemical properties."
[7] "This adds complexity to the characterisation of these mixed oxides since: (i) the XRD patterns are broadened due to low particle size of such high surface area product, not allowing a proper assessment of the presence of a single phase; and (ii) when the material is calcined at high temperatures to induce its partial sintering and hence sharpening of the XRD profiles, phase segregation may be observed for compositions where the metastable phases are formed (20 mol% , CeO2 , 80 mol%)."
[8] "The metastability of the t9 and t0 phases, which exist in the range of CeO2 content 2080 mol%, has represented a real challenge for the characterisation of these materials, particularly those employed in catalytic applications."

The document discusses the influence of dopants, including same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs), on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. Insights from computational and experimental studies highlight the importance of understanding the interactions between dopants and the host oxide, particularly in terms of Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior arise from the complexity of these interactions and the variability in chemical and textural properties of metal oxides. The document also notes that processing conditions, such as temperature and degree of reduction or oxidation, significantly impact the structural and chemical properties of these materials, contributing to their catalytic performance. Despite advancements, there remain disagreements on the phase diagram of CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides, indicating ongoing research and development in this area.

文档讨论了掺杂剂，包括同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD），对不同金属氧化物催化性能的影响。从计算和实验研究中获得的见解强调了理解掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间相互作用的重要性，特别是在Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物可还原性方面的相互作用。形成一般预测规则以描述掺杂剂行为的挑战来自于这些相互作用的复杂性和金属氧化物化学和纹理属性的变异性。文档还指出，处理条件，如温度和还原或氧化程度，显著影响这些材料的结构和化学性质，从而影响其催化性能。尽管取得了进展，但在CeO2-ZrO2混合氧化物的相图方面仍存在分歧，这表明该领域正在进行持续的研究和发展。
