[1] "Despite the apparent simplicity of these systems, extreme variability of their chemical and textural properties has been observed."
[2] "An attempt is made here to rationalise the various factors and the inter-connections to the structure, the texture, and the effects of the nanometre scale, which all contribute to the properties of these materials."
[3] "The possibility of producing redox nanomaterials with tuneable redox capability to activate simple reactants has recently been discussed."
[4] "The present paper is focused on CexZr12xO2 solid solutions and organised as follows: first, the structural and phase homogeneity are analysed,then textural properties are discussed."
[5] "It is important to notice that despite 50 years of investigations,2436 there are still disagreements on the phase diagram itself and its phase boundaries,3,37 besides problems related to structural aspects38 and chemical (redox) behaviour."
[6] "Furthermore,it has now become clearly evident that, due to the metastability of these systems, the processing of the sample, i.e. temperature and extent of reduction and oxidation that have been applied to the mixed oxide precursor, plays a key role in leading to systems possessing different structural and chemical properties."

1. The study addresses the variability of chemical and textural properties in CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides, focusing on the structural and phase homogeneity, and textural properties. It also discusses the possibility of producing redox nanomaterials with tunable redox capability. Despite decades of investigation, there are still disagreements on the phase diagram and its boundaries, as well as structural and chemical behaviors. The processing of the sample, including temperature and extent of reduction and oxidation, significantly influences the resulting properties of these mixed oxides.
