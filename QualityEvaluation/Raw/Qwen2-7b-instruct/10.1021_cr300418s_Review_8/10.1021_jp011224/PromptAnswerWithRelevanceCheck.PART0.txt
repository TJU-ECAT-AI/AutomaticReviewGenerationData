How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?

[1] "In general, the surface chemistry of NO2 on oxides can be very complex since NO2 can interact with both cations and anions by chemisorption, decomposition, and nitrate compound formation."
[2] "On the reduced ceria surfaces, NO chemisorbs, dissociates, and reoxidizes the Ce3+ ions. N2O exposure leads to NO formation."
[3] "The adsorbed NOx species desorb from the oxide surfaces between 400 and 800 K. On these systems, the existence of O vacancies probably prevents the formation of nitrate species upon NO2 adsorption."

[1] "Zirconia doping into ceria induces both structural and electronic modifications in ceria."
[2] "Doping with Zr in the Ce1-xZrxO2 (x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) films may provide a special chemical environment for oxygen atoms as evidenced by O K-edge XANES."
[3] "The band gap in bulk Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 is 0.6 eV smaller than in bulk CeO2, with the Zr atoms in the mixed-metal oxide showing smaller positive charges than the cations in ZrO2 or CeO2."
[4] "When present in a lattice of CeO2, the Zr atoms are forced to adopt larger metalO distances than in ZrO2, leading to a partial reduction in the oxidation state of this element."
[5] "Adsorption of NO2 on reduced Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) surfaces mainly leads to chemisorbed NO2 with transformation of Ce3+ into Ce4+ cations."

Zirconia doping into ceria results in both structural and electronic modifications, affecting the oxygen environment and reducing the band gap. Zr atoms adopt larger metal-oxygen distances, leading to a partial reduction in their oxidation state. NO2 adsorption on reduced ceria surfaces, especially those with zirconia doping, leads to the transformation of Ce3+ ions into Ce4+ through chemisorption, enhancing catalytic activity. This contrasts with the behavior on surfaces with reduced zirconia, where chemisorbed NO2 is the predominant species, leading to the oxidation of zirconia from Zr0 to Zr2+.

锆掺杂到铈中会导致结构和电子性质的改变，影响氧环境并减小带隙。锆原子采用较大的金属-氧距离，导致其氧化状态的部分降低。NO2在还原铈表面的吸附主要导致化学吸附NO2，并将Ce3+离子转化为Ce4+，增强催化活性。相比之下，在还原锆表面的行为主要是化学吸附NO2，导致锆从Zr0氧化为Zr2+。

The document discusses how the introduction of zirconia (Zr) into ceria (Ce) can modify the structure and electronic properties of the resulting mixed-metal oxides. Specifically, the presence of Zr in Ce1-xZrxO2 systems leads to a reduction in the band gap, with Zr atoms adopting larger metal-oxygen distances compared to pure ZrO2 or CeO2, resulting in a partial reduction in their oxidation state. The document also highlights that NO2 adsorption on reduced Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 surfaces leads to chemisorption of NO2, causing a transformation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ ions. Similar observations are made for Zr(Y)O2 surfaces, where NO2 adsorption results in the oxidation of Zr0 to Zr2+ ions. The document further notes that the presence of oxygen vacancies on these surfaces likely inhibits the formation of nitrate species upon NO2 adsorption, facilitating the formation of chemisorbed NO2 instead. Overall, these findings suggest that the introduction of Zr into ceria can alter the catalytic properties of the mixed-metal oxides by influencing the reactivity of metal sites and the stability of adsorbed species.

文档讨论了锆（Zr）在铈（Ce）中引入如何修改陶瓷的结构和电子性质。特别是，铈1-x锆x氧化物体系中锆的存在导致带隙的减少，锆原子采用与纯锆氧化物或铈氧化物相比更大的金属-氧距离，导致其氧化态的部分降低。文档还指出，在还原的铈0.8锆0.2氧化物表面上吸附的NO2导致NO2的化学吸附，引起铈3+转变为铈4+离子。对锆（Y）氧化物表面类似的观察表明，NO2吸附导致锆0的氧化为锆2+离子。文档进一步指出，在这些表面上存在的氧空位可能阻止NO2吸附时形成硝酸盐物种，促进NO2的化学吸附。总的来说，这些发现表明，锆在铈中的引入可以通过影响金属位点的反应性和吸附物种的稳定性来改变混合金属氧化物的催化性能。
