[1] "In general, the surface chemistry of NO2 on oxides can be very complex since NO2 can interact with both cations and anions by chemisorption, decomposition, and nitrate compound formation."
[2] "On the reduced ceria surfaces, NO chemisorbs, dissociates, and reoxidizes the Ce3+ ions. N2O exposure leads to NO formation."
[3] "The adsorbed NOx species desorb from the oxide surfaces between 400 and 800 K. On these systems, the existence of O vacancies probably prevents the formation of nitrate species upon NO2 adsorption."

How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?
