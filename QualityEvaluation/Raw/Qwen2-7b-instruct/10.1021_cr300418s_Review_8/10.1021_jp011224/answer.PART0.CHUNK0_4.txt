[1] "In the present work, it was found that at both 100 and 300 K, NO2 gas exposure onto reduced Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) surfaces mainly leads to chemisorbed NO2 with transformation of Ce3+ into Ce4+ cations."
[2] "On partially reduced Zr(Y)O2-x(111) surfaces, chemisorbed NO2 is also the main species for NO2 dosing at 300 K with oxidation of Zr0 to Zr2+ ions."
[3] "The adsorbed NOx species desorb from the oxide surfaces between 400 and 800 K."

The study investigated the interaction of NO2 with Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) and Zr(Y)O2-x(111) surfaces. At both 100 and 300 K, NO2 exposure led to chemisorbed NO2 on the reduced Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) surfaces, causing the transformation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ cations. On partially reduced Zr(Y)O2-x(111) surfaces, chemisorbed NO2 was the predominant species upon NO2 dosing at 300 K, resulting in the oxidation of Zr0 to Zr2+ ions. The adsorbed NOx species desorbed from the oxide surfaces between 400 and 800 K.

研究探讨了NO2与Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111)和Zr(Y)O2-x(111)表面的相互作用。在100和300 K下，NO2暴露导致了减少的Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111)表面上的吸附NO2，并导致了Ce3+向Ce4+离子的转变。在部分还原的Zr(Y)O2-x(111)表面上，在300 K时NO2剂量的主要物种是吸附的NO2，导致Zr0氧化为Zr2+离子。吸附的NOx物种在400至800 K之间从氧化物表面脱附。
