<p>Due to the delocalized (plane-wave) nature of its basis set, CASTEP yields useful electronic information (levels and band structure) only in the k-space. To investigate localized charges and the localized electronic density of states around various atoms of interest, we used the DMol3 code. </p>
<p>The crystal structures determined with CASTEP for CeO2, ZrO2, and Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 were used in DMol3 to examine electronic properties of these oxides.</p>
<p>Figure 1 displays the calculated energy positions for the valence (solid lines) and conduction (dashed lines) bands of CeO2, ZrO2, and Ce0.8Zr0.2O2. For CeO2, the calculations predict a band gap of 3 eV. Experimental measurements give band gaps of 3.26 eV for CeO2, depending on the techniques.</p>
<p>Figure 2 displays a series of valence spectra for polycrystalline CeO2,3a Ce0.8Zr0.2O2(111), and YSZ(111) at room temperature.</p>
<p>Figure 3 displays the CeO2 3d core-level XPS spectra from fully oxidized and heavily sputtered CeO2(111).</p>
<p>Figure 4 illustrates the effects of Ne+ ion bombardment on the Zr 3d oxidation states for sputtered YSZ(111).</p>
<p>Figure 5 shows O K-edge electron-yield XANES spectra for a series of CexZr1-xO2 samples, including reference spectra of pure ZrO2, Zr(Y)O2, and CeO2.</p>
<p>Figure 6 shows effects of NO2 adsorption and subsequent annealing on the Ce 3d core-level spectra of CeO2-x(111).</p>
<p>Figure 7 shows N 1s spectra for the adsorption of NO2 on a heavily sputtered Ce1-xZrxO2(111) surface.</p>
<p>Figure 8 shows N 1s spectra for the adsorption of NO2 on a heavily sputtered Ce1-xZrxO2 surface at 100 K.</p>
<p>Figure 9 shows the effects of NO2 adsorption on the Zr 3d levels and the valence band structure of O-vacancy-rich YSZ(111).</p>
<p>In prior published work, it was found that nitrate is the dominant product for the adsorption of NO2 on fully oxidized CeO2 and ZrO2. We found here that at both 100 and 300 K, NO2 gas exposure onto reduced Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-x(111) surfaces mainly leads to chemisorbed NO2 with transformation of Ce3+ into Ce4+ cations.</p>
