Zirconia doping into ceria results in both structural and electronic modifications, affecting the oxygen environment and reducing the band gap. Zr atoms adopt larger metal-oxygen distances, leading to a partial reduction in their oxidation state. NO2 adsorption on reduced ceria surfaces, especially those with zirconia doping, leads to the transformation of Ce3+ ions into Ce4+ through chemisorption, enhancing catalytic activity. This contrasts with the behavior on surfaces with reduced zirconia, where chemisorbed NO2 is the predominant species, leading to the oxidation of zirconia from Zr0 to Zr2+.

锆掺杂到铈中会导致结构和电子性质的改变，影响氧环境并减小带隙。锆原子采用较大的金属-氧距离，导致其氧化状态的部分降低。NO2在还原铈表面的吸附主要导致化学吸附NO2，并将Ce3+离子转化为Ce4+，增强催化活性。相比之下，在还原锆表面的行为主要是化学吸附NO2，导致锆从Zr0氧化为Zr2+。
