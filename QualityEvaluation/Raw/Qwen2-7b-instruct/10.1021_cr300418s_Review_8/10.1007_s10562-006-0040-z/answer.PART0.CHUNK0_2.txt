[1] "EXAFS study of Ce1-xZrxO2 shows that oxygen coordination around Zr is 4+4."
[2] "The presence of short and long bonds result in two type of oxygens: strongly and weakly bound."
[3] "Using the valencies of cations and oxygens calculated by bond valence method, we determined the weakly bound oxygens responsible for higher OSC in the mixed oxides."
[4] "Presence of oxygen vacancies in ceria-zirconia has been found to result in longer cation-oxygen bonds, which might lead to weakening of strongly bound oxygens, thereby further increasing the OSC."

The document explains that in ceria-zirconia solid solutions, the introduction of dopants leads to the formation of both strongly and weakly bound oxygen species. The strongly bound oxygens have valencies greater than 2.0, while the weakly bound oxygens have valencies less than 2.0. These weakly bound oxygens are responsible for the enhanced oxygen storage capacity (OSC) observed in mixed oxides. The presence of oxygen vacancies in these materials increases the number of weakly bound oxygens, contributing further to the OSC. The computational and experimental studies conducted in the document aim to elucidate the structural origins of this enhanced OSC.

文档说明，在铈锆固溶体中，掺杂引入导致形成强键氧和弱键氧两种氧物种。强键氧的电荷值大于2.0，而弱键氧的电荷值小于2.0。这些弱键氧是混合氧化物中观察到的高氧存储容量(OSC)的原因。材料中的氧空位的存在增加了弱键氧的数量，进一步提高了OSC。进行的计算和实验研究旨在揭示这种增强的OSC的结构起源。
