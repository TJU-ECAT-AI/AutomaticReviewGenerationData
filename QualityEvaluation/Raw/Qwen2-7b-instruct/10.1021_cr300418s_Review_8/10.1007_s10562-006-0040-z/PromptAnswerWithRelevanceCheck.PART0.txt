The document explains that in ceria-zirconia solid solutions, the introduction of dopants leads to the formation of both strongly and weakly bound oxygen species. The strongly bound oxygens have valencies greater than 2.0, while the weakly bound oxygens have valencies less than 2.0. These weakly bound oxygens are responsible for the enhanced oxygen storage capacity (OSC) observed in mixed oxides. The presence of oxygen vacancies in these materials increases the number of weakly bound oxygens, contributing further to the OSC. The computational and experimental studies conducted in the document aim to elucidate the structural origins of this enhanced OSC.

The document elucidates how dopants can influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Specifically, it discusses how the introduction of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can alter the local atomic-scale structure, leading to the formation of both strongly and weakly bound oxygens. These varying bond strengths impact the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) in mixed oxides, with weakly bound oxygens playing a crucial role in enhancing the OSC. Moreover, the presence of oxygen vacancies is highlighted as another factor that contributes to the OSC by promoting the formation of longer cation-oxygen bonds, which in turn weakens the strongly bound oxygens, further boosting the OSC.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior are acknowledged. The document considers factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible), indicating that these elements play significant roles in determining the effectiveness of dopants in catalytic applications.

文献解释了掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物的催化性能。具体而言，它讨论了同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）如何改变原子尺度结构，导致形成强键和弱键氧，这些不同的键强度影响混合氧化物的氧气存储容量（OSC）。弱键氧在提高OSC中起着关键作用。此外，文献强调了氧空位的存在作为另一个增加OSC的因素，通过促进形成更长的阳离子-氧键，这进而削弱强键氧，进一步增强OSC。

对于制定预测掺杂剂行为的一般规则的挑战被承认。文献考虑了Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物（可还原性与不可还原性）的性质，指出这些因素在确定催化剂应用中掺杂剂的有效性方面起着重要作用。

The document explains that dopants can alter the bonding environment in metal oxides, leading to the formation of two types of oxygen atoms: strongly bound and weakly bound. Strongly bound oxygens have a valency greater than 2.0, while weakly bound oxygens have a valency less than 2.0. The presence of oxygen vacancies in ceria-zirconia contributes to the formation of longer cation-oxygen bonds, which may weaken the strongly bound oxygens and thus increase the oxygen storage capacity (OSC). This phenomenon is attributed to the Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide.
