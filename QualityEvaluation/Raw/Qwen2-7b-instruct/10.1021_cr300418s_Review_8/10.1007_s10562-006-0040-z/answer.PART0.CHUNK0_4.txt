[1] "We find that the presence of short and long bonds result in two type of oxygens: strongly and weakly bound. The stronger ones have valency greater than 2.0 and the weaker ones have valency less than 2.0."
[2] "Using the valencies of cations and oxygens calculated by bond valence method, we determined the weakly bound oxygens responsible for higher OSC in the mixed oxides."
[3] "Presence of oxygen vacancies in ceria-zirconia has been found to result in longer cation-oxygen bonds, which might lead to weakening of strongly bound oxygens, thereby further increasing the OSC."

The document explains that dopants can alter the bonding environment in metal oxides, leading to the formation of two types of oxygen atoms: strongly bound and weakly bound. Strongly bound oxygens have a valency greater than 2.0, while weakly bound oxygens have a valency less than 2.0. The presence of oxygen vacancies in ceria-zirconia contributes to the formation of longer cation-oxygen bonds, which may weaken the strongly bound oxygens and thus increase the oxygen storage capacity (OSC). This phenomenon is attributed to the Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide.

文档解释说，掺杂剂可以改变金属氧化物中的结合环境，导致形成两种类型的氧原子：强结合氧和弱结合氧。强结合氧的电荷大于2.0，而弱结合氧的电荷小于2.0。在铈锆复合氧化物中，氧空位的存在导致形成更长的离子-氧键，这可能会削弱强结合氧并因此增加氧气储存能力（OSC）。这种现象归因于Lewis酸-碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质。
