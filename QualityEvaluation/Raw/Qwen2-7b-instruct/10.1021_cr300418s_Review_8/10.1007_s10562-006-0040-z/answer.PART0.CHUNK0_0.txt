<p>The mechanism of CeO2Ce2O3 transition associated with oxygen vacancy formation was explained on the basis of first-principles calculations as a possible reason behind the high OSC of ceria.</p>
<p>Even though ZrO2 cannot be reduced by CO or H2, OSC was enhanced in the Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solution.</p>
<p>We find that nanocrystalline Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 can be reduced to Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.57 by H2 upto 850 C with an OSC of 65 cc/gm which is extremely high.</p>
<p>EXAFS at the Zr K-edge were recorded in transmission mode at the EXAFS-1 Beamline at Elettra Synchrotron Source using Si(111) as monochromator.</p>
<p>For pure CeO2, the total H2 uptake upto 850 C corresponds to the reduction of CeO2 to CeO1.92.</p>
<p>In Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, as given in table 4, the oxygens with three CeO long bonds and one ZrO short bond have valency lower than 2.0 and the oxygens with 3 CeO short bonds and 1 ZrO long bond have valency greater than 2.0.</p>
<p>The presence of short and long bonds result in two type of oxygens: strongly and weakly bound. The stronger ones have valency greater than 2.0 and the weaker ones have valency less than 2.0.</p>
<p>Presence of oxygen vacancies in ceria-zirconia has been found to result in longer cation-oxygen bonds, which might lead to weakening of strongly bound oxygens, thereby further increasing the OSC.</p>

1. The CeO2 to Ce2O3 transition and the high oxygen storage capacity of ceria can be attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies, as suggested by first-principles calculations.
2. Incorporating ZrO2 into a solid solution with CeO2 enhances the oxygen storage capacity despite ZrO2's inability to be reduced by CO or H2.
3. Nanocrystalline Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 exhibits a high oxygen storage capacity when reduced with H2 up to 850°C.
4. EXAFS studies conducted at the Zr K-edge provided insights into the local atomic-scale structure of ceria-zirconia solid solutions.
5. The total hydrogen uptake of pure CeO2 up to 850°C corresponds to the reduction of CeO2 to CeO1.92.
6. In Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, oxygens with specific bond configurations exhibit varying degrees of binding strength, with stronger oxygens having a valency greater than 2.0 and weaker oxygens having a valency less than 2.0.
7. The presence of oxygen vacancies in ceria-zirconia leads to longer cation-oxygen bonds, which might weaken the strongly bound oxygens and consequently increase the oxygen storage capacity.

1. CeO2到Ce2O3转换和铈氧化物的高氧存储能力可以归因于氧空位的形成，这是基于第一原理计算的可能原因。
2. 将ZrO2引入CeO2固溶体中，即使ZrO2不能被CO或H2还原，其氧存储能力仍然得到增强。
3. 纳米晶Ce0.5Zr0.5O2在使用H2还原至850°C时表现出高的氧存储容量。
4. 在Elettra同步加速器源的EXAFS-1束线处，以Si(111)作为单色器进行了Zr K边缘的透射模式EXAFS研究。
5. 纯CeO2在850°C之前的总氢吸收对应于CeO2还原为CeO1.92。
6. 在Ce0.5Zr0.5O2中，具有特定键合配置的氧原子显示出不同的结合强度，较强的氧原子的价数大于2.0，较弱的氧原子的价数小于2.0。
7. 在铈氧化锆中存在氧空位导致更长的离子-氧键，这可能会削弱强结合的氧原子并因此增加氧存储能力。
