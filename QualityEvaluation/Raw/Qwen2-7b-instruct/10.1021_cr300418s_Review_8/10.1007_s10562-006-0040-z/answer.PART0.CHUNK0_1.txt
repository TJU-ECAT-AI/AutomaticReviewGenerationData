1. The mechanism of CeO2 to Ce2O3 transition involving oxygen vacancy formation was proposed as a potential explanation for the high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria, based on first-principles calculations.
2. In the solid solution of ceria-zirconia (Ce1-xZrxO2), the addition of zirconia (Zr) enhances the OSC even though pure zirconia cannot be reduced by CO or H2.
3. Nanocrystalline ceria-zirconia (Ce0.5Zr0.5O2) can be reduced to Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.57 by hydrogen up to 850°C, achieving an exceptionally high OSC of 65 cc/gm.
4. Studies in the literature have explored the reasons behind the enhanced OSC in ceria-zirconia solid solutions, particularly in the context of automobile exhaust catalysis.
5. The oxygen sublattice in ceria-zirconia is significantly distorted, leading to the destabilization of oxide ions in terms of the distances between CeO and ZrO.
6. In ceria-zirconia (Ce0.75Zr0.25O2), oxygens bonded with three CeO long bonds and one ZrO short bond have valencies below 2.0, while oxygens with three CeO short bonds and one ZrO long bond have valencies above 2.0.
7. The bond length distribution in ceria-zirconia solid solutions is illustrated.
8. The presence of longer bonds in ceria doped with zirconia leads to higher oxygen storage capacity compared to pure ceria or zirconia, due to the weakening of longer bonds and strengthening of shorter bonds.
9. The relative bonding energies in ceria-zirconia (Ce0.75Zr0.25O2) indicate that CeO (long), ZrO (long), and ZrO (short) bonds are weaker than the pure CeO bond.
10. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in enhancing the OSC of ceria-zirconia mixed oxides, as evidenced by changes in bond lengths when oxygen vacancies are introduced into the lattice.

1. CeO2到Ce2O3过渡机制中的氧空位形成，基于第一原理计算被提出作为解释铈的高氧气存储容量（OSC）的潜在原因。
2. 在铈锆固溶体（Ce1-xZrxO2）中，添加锆可以增强OSC，尽管纯锆无法通过CO或H2还原。
3. 纳米晶铈锆（Ce0.5Zr0.5O2）可以通过氢气在850°C下还原至Ce0.5Zr0.5O1.57，实现非常高的OSC为65 cc/gm。
4. 文献中存在研究，探索了铈锆固溶体的高OSC特性，尤其是在汽车尾气催化方面的应用。
5. 铈锆的氧子晶格显著失稳，导致氧化物离子在CeO和ZrO之间的距离上不稳定性增加。
6. 在铈锆（Ce0.75Zr0.25O2）中，与三个CeO长键和一个ZrO短键相连的氧原子具有小于2.0的电荷数，而与三个CeO短键和一个ZrO长键相连的氧原子具有大于2.0的电荷数。
7. 描述了铈锆固溶体的键长分布。
8. 铈掺杂的锆导致更高的氧气存储容量，因为更长的键较弱，较短的键较强，使得掺杂的铈比纯铈或锆具有更高的氧气存储能力。
9. 在铈锆（Ce0.75Zr0.25O2）中，CeO（长）、ZrO（长）和ZrO（短）键相对于纯CeO键较弱。
10. 氧空位在铈锆混合氧化物中起着关键作用，增加了氧气存储容量，这从引入氧空位时的键长变化可以看出。
