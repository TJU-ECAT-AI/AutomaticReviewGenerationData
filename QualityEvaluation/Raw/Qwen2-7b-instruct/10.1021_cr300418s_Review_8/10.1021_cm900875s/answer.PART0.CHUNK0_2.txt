[1] "The compounds crystallize in fluorite structure and the composition is Ce1xRuxO2x/2 where Ru is in +4 state and Ce is in mixed-valence (+3, +4) state."
[2] "Utilization of Higher OSC of Ce1xRuxO2δ (x=0.05 and 0.10) is also reflected in terms of low-temperature CO oxidation with these catalysts, both in the presence and absence of feed oxygen."
[3] "The Ru4+ ion acts as an active center for reducing molecules (CO, hydrocarbon HC) and oxide ion vacancy acts as an active center for O2 and NO, leading to low-temperature NO conversion to N2."
[4] "Thus due to Ru4+ ion, Ce1xRuxO2δ is not just a high oxygen storage material but also shows high activity toward CO, hydrocarbon HC oxidation, and NO reduction by CO at low temperature with high N2 selectivity for three-way catalysis."
[5] "Such a high OSC of Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 is also confirmed by thermogravimetric (TG) study of Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 in hydrogen."
[6] "The noble metal ions are a potential adsorbent of NO and CO. This kind of adsorption will be mainly molecular adsorption, but NO can also get dissociatively adsorbed in the vacant site."

1. The compounds crystallize in a fluorite structure with a specific composition involving Ce and Ru ions. The Ru ion is in a +4 state, while Ce is in a mixed-valence state (+3, +4). These materials exhibit high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and demonstrate high catalytic activity towards CO, hydrocarbon HC oxidation, and NO reduction at low temperatures.

2. The high OSC of Ce1xRuxO2δ materials enables effective CO oxidation, both in the presence and absence of feed oxygen. This is due to the Ru4+ ion acting as an active center for reducing molecules (CO, hydrocarbons) and the oxide ion vacancy serving as an active center for O2 and NO.

3. Due to the presence of the Ru4+ ion, Ce1xRuxO2δ materials function not only as high OSC materials but also as efficient three-way catalysts for CO, hydrocarbon HC oxidation, and NO reduction by CO at low temperatures with high N2 selectivity.

4. The high OSC of Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 is confirmed through thermogravimetric (TG) studies, indicating its ability to reversibly exchange oxygen at elevated temperatures.

5. Noble metal ions, such as Ru, can serve as adsorbents for NO and CO, primarily through molecular adsorption. However, NO can also undergo dissociative adsorption in vacant sites.

1. 这些化合物以氟石结构结晶，组成涉及铈和钌离子。钌离子处于+4状态，而铈处于混合价态（+3，+4）。这些材料表现出高氧存储容量（OSC）并展示出在低温下对CO、烃类氧化和NO还原的高效催化活性。

2. Ce1xRuxO2δ材料的高OSC使其能够有效进行CO氧化，无论是否有氧气供给。这是由于Ru4+离子作为降低分子（CO、烃类）的活性中心以及氧化物离子空位作为O2和NO的活性中心。

3. 由于存在Ru4+离子，Ce1xRuxO2δ材料不仅作为高OSC材料发挥作用，而且在低温下通过CO进行NO还原时也展现出高效催化活性，并且具有高N2选择性。

4. Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94的高OSC通过热重分析（TG）研究得到证实，表明其能够在较高温度下可逆地交换氧。

5. 贵金属离子如Ru可以作为NO和CO的吸附剂，主要通过分子吸附。然而，NO也可以在空位位点上进行离解吸附。
