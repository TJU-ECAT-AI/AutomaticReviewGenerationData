<p>The compounds crystallize in fluorite structure and the composition is Ce1xRuxO2x/2 where Ru is in +4 state and Ce is in mixed-valence (+3, +4) state.</p>
<p>Utilization of Higher OSC of Ce1xRuxO2δ (x=0.05 and 0.10) is also reflected in terms of low-temperature CO oxidation with these catalysts, both in the presence and absence of feed oxygen.</p>
<p>The Ru4+ ion acts as an active center for reducing molecules (CO, hydrocarbon HC) and oxide ion vacancy acts as an active center for O2 and NO, leading to low-temperature NO conversion to N2.</p>
<p>The Ru(3d5/2) peak in Ce0.95Ru0.05O2-δ and Ce0.90Ru0.10O2δ is observed at 281.4 eV, which is higher than the Ru(3d5/2) peak in RuO2.</p>
<p>So the formation of Ce1xRuxO2x/2 occurs via Ce4+ reduction followed by Ru3+ oxidation and it can be described as Ce12x4+Cex3+Rux4+O2x/2.</p>
<p>Oxygen storage capacity of Ce1xRuxO2x/2 is studied by hydrogen uptake measurements.</p>
<p>The reduction temperature of Ce1xRuxO2x/2 is around 125 C.</p>
<p>From the amount of hydrogen taken up, Ce0.95Ru0.05O1.97 reduced to Ce0.95Ru0.05O1.75, which is equivalent to 0.22 mol of [O]/mol or 1334.8 μmol/g of [O].</p>
<p>Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 is reduced to Ce0.85Ru0.15O1.52, which is equivalent to 0.42 mol of [O]/mol or 2512.6 μmol/g of [O] up to 250 C.</p>
<p>Such a high OSC of Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 is also confirmed by thermogravimetic (TG) study of Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 in hydrogen.</p>
<p>A TG reduction plot of Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 in 10%H2/Ar up to 500 C is shown in inset of figure 7.</p>
<p>Final composition of Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 after H2 reduction by TG study is found to be Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.54, which is close to the value obtained from hydrogen uptake study.</p>
<p>Hydrogen uptake measurements were performed repeatedly by reducing in H2 up to 500 C and oxidizing it in O2 at 250 C as shown in Figure 8 and it is fully reversible.</p>
<p>Inset, TGA curve for Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 in hydrogen.</p>
<p>Activation energies for CO oxidation with Ce0.95Ru0.05O1.97 and Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 are 92.2 and 43 kJ/mol, respectively.</p>
<p>CO oxidation was also carried out with a 1:1 vol % CO:O2 ratio with different weights of the catalysts to obtain the actual rates from the equation (6)</p>
<p>Activation energies for CO oxidation with Ce0.95Ru0.05O1.97 and Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 are 94.5 and 44.8 kJ/mol, respectively, which are closer to the values obtained from the direct conversion plot with 200 mg of these catalysts.</p>
<p>Both Ce0.95Ru0.05O1.97 and Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 are found to be superior to other noble-metal-ion-substituted and metal-impregnated catalysts.</p>
<p>Complete oxidation of HC oxidation is achieved below 240C with the Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.93 catalyst and below 280C with the Ce0.95Ru0.05O1.97 catalyst.</p>
<p>Removal of NOx (NO + NO2) from exhaust stream of stationary and mobile sources has been a central challenge for environmental scientists.</p>
<p>Activation energy of NO reduction or Ea(CO/CO2) is found to be 41 kJ/mol for Ce0.95Ru0.05O1.97 and 53.2 kJ/mol for Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94.</p>
<p>As a whole, Ce1xRuxO2x/2 is not only shown to be higher OSC material than Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 but because of the presence of Ru4+ ion and oxide ion vacancy, it acts as a catalyst by itself avoiding use of Pt, Pd metals.</p>

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by altering their redox potentials, electronic structures, and surface chemistry. In the case of Ce1xRuxO2x/2, the Ru4+ ion substitution enhances the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and catalytic activity towards CO and HC oxidation, as well as NO reduction by CO, at lower temperatures. The Ru4+ ion acts as an active center for reducing molecules, while oxide ion vacancies facilitate O2 and NO reactions. Computational and experimental studies have shown that the presence of HVDs can lead to higher OSC and improved catalytic performance due to the stabilization of oxygen vacancies and the creation of active sites for reactions.

2. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior in metal oxides include understanding the complex interplay between the Lewis acid-base interactions of the dopants and the host oxide, as well as the effect of the host oxide's reducibility versus irreducibility on dopant incorporation and functionality. Factors such as the dopant's ionic radius, electronic structure, and the specific chemical environment within the host oxide matrix contribute to variations in dopant behavior. While computational methods can aid in predicting dopant stability and reactivity, empirical data and detailed characterization are often required to fully understand the effects of dopants on catalytic performance. The literature indicates that a comprehensive approach combining theoretical calculations with experimental validation is essential for developing predictive models that can guide the rational design of dopants for enhanced catalytic properties.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过改变不同金属氧化物的还原电势、电子结构和表面化学，影响其催化性能。在Ce1xRuxO2x/2的情况下，Ru4+离子的替换增强了氧存储容量（OSC）以及CO和HC氧化、CO对NO的低温度还原的催化活性。Ru4+离子作为还原分子的活性中心，而氧化离子空位则促进O2和NO的反应。计算和实验研究表明，高价掺杂剂的存在可以导致更高的OSC和改善的催化性能，这归因于氧空位的稳定化和反应活性位点的产生。挑战在于形成描述掺杂行为的一般预测规则包括理解掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间的Lewis酸碱相互作用的复杂性，以及宿主氧化物的可还原性或不可还原性对掺杂剂的整合和功能的影响。掺杂剂的离子半径、电子结构以及宿主氧化物矩阵内的特定化学环境都对掺杂剂的行为有贡献。虽然计算方法可以帮助预测掺杂剂的稳定性与活性，但需要实际数据和详细表征才能完全理解掺杂剂对催化性能的影响。文献表明，结合理论计算与实验验证的全面方法对于指导设计具有增强催化性能的掺杂剂至关重要。

The document discusses the influence of dopants on the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) play roles in the structure and catalytic activity of the materials. For instance, the introduction of Ru4+ ions into CeO2 activates the lattice oxygen, enhancing the oxygen storage capacity. The presence of Ru4+ ions leads to higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and improved catalytic performance in CO, hydrocarbon HC oxidation, and NO reduction by CO at lower temperatures, with high N2 selectivity. The OSC data for Ce1xRuxO2δ (x=0.05 and 0.10) indicate significantly higher values compared to Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. The document also provides activation energies for CO oxidation, hydrocarbon oxidation, and NO reduction by CO, highlighting the efficiency of these materials in catalytic applications.

通过使用三聚氰胺作为络合剂，合成Ce1xRuxO2δ（x=0.05和0.10），结果得到在萤石结构中结晶的化合物。Ru4+离子在CeO2中的替换激活了晶格氧。这些化合物的氧气存储容量（OSC）分别为0.22[O]和0.42[O]，对于x=0.05和0.10，这高于Ce0.50Zr0.50O2的最大可能OSC为0.22 [O]。它们表现出低温度下对CO和HC氧化以及由CO对NO的还原的高催化活性，具有高N2选择性，适用于三向催化。较高的OSC归因于萤石结构中氧子晶格的不稳定化，导致形成比CeO2中的CeO键更长和更短的MO键。在等摩尔燃烧条件下，CO、HC和NOx吸附在贵金属原子上与其他物质或O2反应形成CO2、H2O和N2，从而减少排放废气中的污染物。
