The study discusses the synthesis of Ce1xRuxO2δ (x=0.05, 0.10) as a novel high oxygen storage material. It exhibits higher oxygen storage capacity than Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 at lower temperatures. This is attributed to the substitution of Ru4+ ion in CeO2, which activates the lattice oxygen. The material acts as a high OSC material and also functions as a uniform, solid three-way catalyst. Its high catalytic activity towards CO, hydrocarbon HC oxidation, and NO reduction by CO at low temperatures, with high N2 selectivity, makes it a promising alternative to Pt, Pd metals in auto exhaust catalysis.

研究讨论了Ce1xRuxO2δ（x=0.05，0.10）作为新型高氧存储材料的合成。它的氧存储容量在较低温度下高于Ce0.5Zr0.5O2。这归因于铈中Ru4+离子的取代，激活了晶格氧。该材料作为高氧存储材料以及均匀固体三元催化剂发挥作用。其在较低温度下对CO、烃类氧化和由CO还原NO的高催化活性，具有高N2选择性，使其成为汽车排气催化中替代Pt、Pd金属的有前景的选择。
