The synthesis of Ce1xRuxO2δ (x=0.05 and 0.10) using melamine as a complexing agent leads to the formation of compounds that crystallize in the fluorite structure. The substitution of Ru4+ ion in CeO2 enhances the lattice oxygen activity. These compounds demonstrate a higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of 0.22[O] and 0.42[O] for x=0.05 and 0.10, respectively, compared to the maximum possible OSC of 0.22 [O] for Ce0.50Zr0.50O2. They exhibit high catalytic activity towards low-temperature CO and hydrocarbon HC oxidation, as well as NO reduction by CO, with high N2 selectivity, making them suitable for three-way catalysis. The higher OSC is attributed to the destabilization of the oxygen sublattice in the fluorite structure, which leads to the formation of longer and shorter MO bonds compared to the CeO bond in CeO2. Under stoichiometric combustion conditions, CO, HC, and NOx absorbed on noble metal atoms react with each other or with O2 to form CO2, H2O, and N2, thus reducing pollutants in exhaust emissions.

通过使用三聚氰胺作为络合剂，合成Ce1xRuxO2δ（x=0.05和0.10），结果得到在萤石结构中结晶的化合物。Ru4+离子在CeO2中的替换激活了晶格氧。这些化合物的氧气存储容量（OSC）分别为0.22[O]和0.42[O]，对于x=0.05和0.10，这高于Ce0.50Zr0.50O2的最大可能OSC为0.22 [O]。它们表现出低温度下对CO和HC氧化以及由CO对NO的还原的高催化活性，具有高N2选择性，适用于三向催化。较高的OSC归因于萤石结构中氧子晶格的不稳定化，导致形成比CeO2中的CeO键更长和更短的MO键。在等摩尔燃烧条件下，CO、HC和NOx吸附在贵金属原子上与其他物质或O2反应形成CO2、H2O和N2，从而减少排放废气中的污染物。
