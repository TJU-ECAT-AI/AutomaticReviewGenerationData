<p>The compounds crystallize in fluorite structure and the composition is Ce1xRuxO2x/2 where Ru is in +4 state and Ce is in mixed-valence (+3, +4) state. Substitution of Ru4+ ion in CeO2 activated the lattice oxygen.</p>
<p>Ce1xRuxO2x/2 reversibly releases 0.22[O] and 0.42[O] for x=0.05 and 0.10, respectively, which is higher than the maximum possible OSC of 0.22 [O] observed for Ce0.50Zr0.50O2.</p>
<p>Utilization of Higher OSC of Ce1xRuxO2δ (x=0.05 and 0.10) is also reflected in terms of low-temperature CO oxidation with these catalysts, both in the presence and absence of feed oxygen.</p>
<p>Due to Ru4+ ion, Ce1xRuxO2δ is not just a high oxygen storage material but also shows high activity toward CO, hydrocarbon HC oxidation, and NO reduction by CO at low temperature with high N2 selectivity for three-way catalysis.</p>
<p>Oxygen storage capacity of Ce1xRuxO2x/2 is studied by hydrogen uptake measurements. H2/TPR profile of Ce1xRuxO2x/2 (x=0.0.5 and 0.10) and of CeO2 up to 500 C are shown in Figure 7.</p>
<p>Activation energies for CO oxidation with Ce0.95Ru0.05O1.97 and Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 are 92.2 and 43 kJ/mol, respectively.</p>
<p>Activation energies for propane oxidation with Ce0.95Ru0.05O1.97 and Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94 are 108.2 and 100.1 kJ/mol, respectively.</p>
<p>Activation energy of NO reduction or Ea(CO/CO2) is found to be 41 kJ/mol for Ce0.95Ru0.05O1.97 and 53.2 kJ/mol for Ce0.90Ru0.10O1.94.</p>

The document discusses the influence of dopants on the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) play roles in the structure and catalytic activity of the materials. For instance, the introduction of Ru4+ ions into CeO2 activates the lattice oxygen, enhancing the oxygen storage capacity. The presence of Ru4+ ions leads to higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and improved catalytic performance in CO, hydrocarbon HC oxidation, and NO reduction by CO at lower temperatures, with high N2 selectivity. The OSC data for Ce1xRuxO2δ (x=0.05 and 0.10) indicate significantly higher values compared to Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. The document also provides activation energies for CO oxidation, hydrocarbon oxidation, and NO reduction by CO, highlighting the efficiency of these materials in catalytic applications.

文档讨论了掺杂剂对金属氧化物催化性质的影响。等价电荷掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价电荷掺杂剂(HVDs)在材料结构和催化活性中起作用。例如，将Ru4+离子引入到CeO2中激活了晶格氧，提高了氧存储容量(OSC)。Ru4+离子的存在导致了Ce1xRuxO2δ(x=0.05和0.10)的氧存储容量(OSC)显著高于Ce0.5Zr0.5O2，并且改善了在较低温度下的CO、碳氢化合物HC氧化以及CO还原NO生成N2的催化性能，具有高的N2选择性。这些材料的OSC数据显示了与Ce0.5Zr0.5O2相比更高的值。文档还提供了CO氧化、碳氢化合物氧化和CO还原NO的激活能，突出了这些材料在催化应用中的效率。
