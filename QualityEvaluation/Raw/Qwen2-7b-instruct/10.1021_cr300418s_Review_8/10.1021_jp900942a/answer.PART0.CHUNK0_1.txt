[1] "Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations."
[2] "Specifically, high OSC efficiency (89% with respect to the theoretical OSC value), has been achieved from the well-ordered Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 solid solution phase."
[3] "It is shown that Erelax is the dominating term and is determined by the local topological structures around the O vacancy."
[4] "Using this model, we are able to explain why ceria with 50% ZrO2 exhibits the best OSC performance."

The document discusses how doping Zr to form Ce1xZrxO2 solid solutions affects the oxygen vacancy formation energy, particularly focusing on the role of electrostatic interaction and structural relaxation. It proposes a model explaining the formation of oxygen vacancies in these materials, which helps in understanding the best oxygen storage capacity in ceria with 50% ZrO2 content. This model suggests that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is composed of two components: the bond energy (Ebond) and the relaxation energy (Erelax). The relaxation energy plays a vital role in affecting the oxygen vacancy formation energies and is determined by the local topological structures around the oxygen vacancy. This model can explain the high oxygen storage capacity of ceria with 50% ZrO2 content and shed light on the doping effects on ceria.

文献讨论了掺杂Zr形成Ce1xZrxO2固溶体如何影响氧空位形成能，特别是电荷相互作用和结构松弛的角色。提出了一个模型来理解这些材料中氧空位的形成，并解释了CeO2中50%ZrO2含量时最佳氧气存储能力的原因。该模型表明氧空位形成能由两个部分组成：键能（Ebond）和松弛能（Erelax）。松弛能是决定氧空位形成能的关键因素，并且由氧空位周围的局部拓扑结构决定。使用这个模型，可以解释CeO2中50%ZrO2含量时的高氧气存储能力，并揭示了铈基材料中的掺杂效应。
