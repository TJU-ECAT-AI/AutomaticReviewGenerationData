[1] "Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations."
[2] "It was found that the formation of an O vacancy is decomposed into two steps: (i) removing an O while the structure is fixed; and (ii) relaxing the structure in the presence of the O vacancy."
[3] "The following striking features can be seen from the figure: (i) Ebond increases approximately linearly with the ZrO2 content, indicating that doping Zr does not weaken the bond strength of O in the system; and (ii) Erelax changes according to a parabola-like curve with the minimum at x = 0.5."
[4] "Using this model, we are able to explain why ceria with 50% ZrO2 exhibits the best OSC performance."

The study provides a model to understand the oxygen vacancy formation in Zr-doped CeO2, specifically focusing on how electrostatic interaction and structural relaxation affect the formation energy. The model decomposes the formation energy into two components: bond energy and relaxation energy. It is found that relaxation energy plays a vital role in determining the oxygen vacancy formation energy. This model helps explain why ceria with 50% ZrO2 exhibits the best oxygen storage capacity, shedding new light on the doping effects on ceria and potentially having implications for other systems.

The document discusses how doping Zr to form Ce1xZrxO2 solid solutions affects the oxygen vacancy formation energy, particularly focusing on the role of electrostatic interaction and structural relaxation. It proposes a model explaining the formation of oxygen vacancies in these materials, which helps in understanding the best oxygen storage capacity in ceria with 50% ZrO2 content. This model suggests that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is composed of two components: the bond energy (Ebond) and the relaxation energy (Erelax). The relaxation energy plays a vital role in affecting the oxygen vacancy formation energies and is determined by the local topological structures around the oxygen vacancy. This model can explain the high oxygen storage capacity of ceria with 50% ZrO2 content and shed light on the doping effects on ceria.

<p>Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations. The following fundamental questions still remain to be answered: (i) Why does Ce1xZrxO2 at x = 0.5 exhibit the best OSC performance? (ii) What is the physical origin of the Zr doping effect?</p>
<p>To tackle these questions, in this study, we carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate formation energies of O vacancy in Ce1xZrxO2 with x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1. We propose a simple model to understand the oxygen vacancy formation energy based on detailed analyses of DFT results.</p>
<p>We first calculated the O vacancy formation energy (EVf) as a function of ZrO2 content; the results are shown in Figure 2 (red curve). It can be seen that EVf first decreases and then increases when x changes from 0 to 1.0; at x = 0.5, Ce1xZrxO2 exhibits the lowest formation energy of O vacancy, 0.54 eV lower compared to pure CeO2, in agreement with experimental results.</p>
<p>On the basis of comprehensive analyses, we proposed a model to understand the O vacancy formation by decomposing it into two terms: the bond energy (Ebond) and relaxation energy (Erelax).</p>
<p>The determination of the crucial role of relaxation energy in our model can help us to understand a broader doping effect. Using GGA + U calculations, Andersson et al. (21) found that for dopants of M (M = Zr, Hf, Ti, and Th), there is a linear correlation between the formation energies of the O vacancy in doped ceria and the ionic radii of M4+.</p>
<p>We calculated the O vacancy formation energies and the corresponding relaxation energies for Ce0.75M0.25O2 (M = Zr, Hf, Ti, Th). It was found that the formation energies of O vacancies are, indeed, largely determined by the structural relaxation. More interestingly, the relaxation energies were found to correlate linearly with the ionic radius of the metal cation doped (R2 = 0.97), as shown in Figure 3c.</p>

The document explains how doping zirconium (Zr) into ceria (CeO2) affects the oxygen vacancy formation energy, specifically focusing on the role of electrostatic interaction and structural relaxation. The model suggests that at a certain concentration of Zr, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is minimized, which corresponds to the best oxygen storage capacity (OSC) observed experimentally. This optimal concentration is found to be around 50% ZrO2, where the structural relaxation plays a critical role in minimizing the oxygen vacancy formation energy. The model provides insights into why ceria with 50% ZrO2 usually exhibits the best OSC performance.

[3] "It was found that the relaxation of Ce and Zr cations is much smaller than that of O ions."
[4] "They are irreducible M4+ and are accommodated in the same local geometries. Thus, the ionic radii of these M4+ may affect the O vacancy formation in a similar way: the smaller the ionic radius, the larger the space in which O can move, leading to an increase in O displacement and structural relaxation."

The document explains that doping zirconium (Zr) into ceria (CeO2) affects the oxygen vacancy formation energy through two components: the bond energy (Ebond) and the relaxation energy (Erelax). The bond energy increases linearly with the concentration of ZrO2, suggesting that Zr doping does not weaken the O bond strength. In contrast, the relaxation energy changes in a parabolic curve, reaching a minimum at a ZrO2 concentration of 50%. This indicates that the highest structural relaxation occurs at this concentration, which is crucial for the best oxygen storage capacity. The relaxation energy is determined by the local topological structures around the oxygen vacancy, and the ionic radii of different dopants affect the relaxation energy linearly, influencing the oxygen vacancy formation.

文献解释说，将锆（Zr）掺杂到铈氧化物（CeO2）中通过两个方面影响氧空位形成能：键能（Ebond）和松弛能（Erelax）。键能随着ZrO2浓度的线性增加，表明Zr掺杂不会削弱O键强度。相反，松弛能在抛物线形状的曲线中变化，在ZrO2浓度为50%时达到最小值。这表明在这一浓度下，结构松弛最高，对最佳氧存储容量至关重要。松弛能由氧空位周围的局部拓扑结构决定，并且不同掺杂物的离子半径线性地影响松弛能，从而影响氧空位的形成。
