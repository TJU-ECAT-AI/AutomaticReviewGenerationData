[1] "Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations."
[2] "It was found that the formation of an O vacancy is decomposed into two steps: (i) removing an O while the structure is fixed; and (ii) relaxing the structure in the presence of the O vacancy."
[3] "The following striking features can be seen from the figure: (i) Ebond increases approximately linearly with the ZrO2 content, indicating that doping Zr does not weaken the bond strength of O in the system; and (ii) Erelax changes according to a parabola-like curve with the minimum at x = 0.5."
[4] "Using this model, we are able to explain why ceria with 50% ZrO2 exhibits the best OSC performance."

The study provides a model to understand the oxygen vacancy formation in Zr-doped CeO2, specifically focusing on how electrostatic interaction and structural relaxation affect the formation energy. The model decomposes the formation energy into two components: bond energy and relaxation energy. It is found that relaxation energy plays a vital role in determining the oxygen vacancy formation energy. This model helps explain why ceria with 50% ZrO2 exhibits the best oxygen storage capacity, shedding new light on the doping effects on ceria and potentially having implications for other systems.

该研究提出了一种模型来理解Zr掺杂的CeO2中氧空位的形成，特别关注静电相互作用和结构松弛如何影响形成能。该模型将形成能分解为两个部分：键能和松弛能。发现松弛能在决定氧空位形成能方面起着至关重要的作用。使用这个模型，我们能够解释为什么铈含量为50%的氧化锆具有最佳的氧储存性能。这一新的解释为我们对铈掺杂的基本理解提供了新的视角，并可能对其他体系产生重要影响。
