<p>Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations. The following fundamental questions still remain to be answered: (i) Why does Ce1xZrxO2 at x = 0.5 exhibit the best OSC performance? (ii) What is the physical origin of the Zr doping effect?</p>
<p>To tackle these questions, in this study, we carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate formation energies of O vacancy in Ce1xZrxO2 with x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1. We propose a simple model to understand the oxygen vacancy formation energy based on detailed analyses of DFT results.</p>
<p>We first calculated the O vacancy formation energy (EVf) as a function of ZrO2 content; the results are shown in Figure 2 (red curve). It can be seen that EVf first decreases and then increases when x changes from 0 to 1.0; at x = 0.5, Ce1xZrxO2 exhibits the lowest formation energy of O vacancy, 0.54 eV lower compared to pure CeO2, in agreement with experimental results.</p>
<p>On the basis of comprehensive analyses, we proposed a model to understand the O vacancy formation by decomposing it into two terms: the bond energy (Ebond) and relaxation energy (Erelax). The physical origins of the two terms are discussed. It is shown that Erelax is the dominating term and is determined by the local topological structures around the O vacancy.</p>

The document explains how doping zirconium (Zr) into ceria (CeO2) affects the oxygen vacancy formation energy, specifically focusing on the role of electrostatic interaction and structural relaxation. The model suggests that at a certain concentration of Zr, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is minimized, which corresponds to the best oxygen storage capacity (OSC) observed experimentally. This optimal concentration is found to be around 50% ZrO2, where the structural relaxation plays a critical role in minimizing the oxygen vacancy formation energy. The model provides insights into why ceria with 50% ZrO2 usually exhibits the best OSC performance.

文献解释了向铈氧化物（CeO2）掺杂锆（Zr）如何影响氧空位形成能，特别关注静电相互作用和结构松弛的作用。该模型表明，在一定的Zr浓度下，氧空位形成能最小化，这与实验中观察到的最佳氧化存储容量（OSC）相吻合。最优浓度被发现约为50%的ZrO2，其中结构松弛在最小化氧空位形成能方面起着关键作用。该模型为为什么含50%ZrO2的铈表现出最佳的OSC性能提供了新的见解。
