[1] "Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations."
[2] "The following striking features can be seen from the figure: (i) Ebond increases approximately linearly with the ZrO2 content, indicating that doping Zr does not weaken the bond strength of O in the system; and (ii) Erelax changes according to a parabola-like curve with the minimum at x = 0.5."
[3] "It was found that the relaxation of Ce and Zr cations is much smaller than that of O ions."
[4] "They are irreducible M4+ and are accommodated in the same local geometries. Thus, the ionic radii of these M4+ may affect the O vacancy formation in a similar way: the smaller the ionic radius, the larger the space in which O can move, leading to an increase in O displacement and structural relaxation."

The document explains that doping zirconium (Zr) into ceria (CeO2) affects the oxygen vacancy formation energy through two components: the bond energy (Ebond) and the relaxation energy (Erelax). The bond energy increases linearly with the concentration of ZrO2, suggesting that Zr doping does not weaken the O bond strength. In contrast, the relaxation energy changes in a parabolic curve, reaching a minimum at a ZrO2 concentration of 50%. This indicates that the highest structural relaxation occurs at this concentration, which is crucial for the best oxygen storage capacity. The relaxation energy is determined by the local topological structures around the oxygen vacancy, and the ionic radii of different dopants affect the relaxation energy linearly, influencing the oxygen vacancy formation.

文献解释说，将锆（Zr）掺杂到铈氧化物（CeO2）中通过两个方面影响氧空位形成能：键能（Ebond）和松弛能（Erelax）。键能随着ZrO2浓度的线性增加，表明Zr掺杂不会削弱O键强度。相反，松弛能在抛物线形状的曲线中变化，在ZrO2浓度为50%时达到最小值。这表明在这一浓度下，结构松弛最高，对最佳氧存储容量至关重要。松弛能由氧空位周围的局部拓扑结构决定，并且不同掺杂物的离子半径线性地影响松弛能，从而影响氧空位的形成。
