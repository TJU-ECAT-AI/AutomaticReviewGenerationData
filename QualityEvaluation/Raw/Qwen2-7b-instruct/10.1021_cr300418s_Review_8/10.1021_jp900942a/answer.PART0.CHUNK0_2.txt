<p>Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations. The following fundamental questions still remain to be answered: (i) Why does Ce1xZrxO2 at x = 0.5 exhibit the best OSC performance? (ii) What is the physical origin of the Zr doping effect?</p>
<p>To tackle these questions, in this study, we carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate formation energies of O vacancy in Ce1xZrxO2 with x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1. We propose a simple model to understand the oxygen vacancy formation energy based on detailed analyses of DFT results.</p>
<p>We first calculated the O vacancy formation energy (EVf) as a function of ZrO2 content; the results are shown in Figure 2 (red curve). It can be seen that EVf first decreases and then increases when x changes from 0 to 1.0; at x = 0.5, Ce1xZrxO2 exhibits the lowest formation energy of O vacancy, 0.54 eV lower compared to pure CeO2, in agreement with experimental results.</p>
<p>On the basis of comprehensive analyses, we proposed a model to understand the O vacancy formation by decomposing it into two terms: the bond energy (Ebond) and relaxation energy (Erelax).</p>
<p>The determination of the crucial role of relaxation energy in our model can help us to understand a broader doping effect. Using GGA + U calculations, Andersson et al. (21) found that for dopants of M (M = Zr, Hf, Ti, and Th), there is a linear correlation between the formation energies of the O vacancy in doped ceria and the ionic radii of M4+.</p>
<p>We calculated the O vacancy formation energies and the corresponding relaxation energies for Ce0.75M0.25O2 (M = Zr, Hf, Ti, Th). It was found that the formation energies of O vacancies are, indeed, largely determined by the structural relaxation. More interestingly, the relaxation energies were found to correlate linearly with the ionic radius of the metal cation doped (R2 = 0.97), as shown in Figure 3c.</p>

The study proposes a model to understand the oxygen vacancy formation energy in Ce1xZrxO2, focusing on the roles of bond energy (Ebonds) and relaxation energy (Erelaxes). It explains why Ce1xZrxO2 at x = 0.5 exhibits the best oxygen storage capacity and provides insights into the physical origin of the Zr doping effect. The model is also used to elucidate the linear correlation between the formation energies of O vacancies in doped ceria and the ionic radii of dopants, showing that structural relaxation plays a critical role in this correlation.

本研究提出了一种模型来理解Ce1xZrxO2中的氧空位形成能，重点关注键能（Ebonds）和结构松弛能（Erelaxes）的作用。它解释了为什么Ce1xZrxO2在x = 0.5时表现出最佳的氧气存储性能，并提供了Zr掺杂效果的物理起源的见解。该模型还用于阐明掺杂氧化铈中氧空位形成能与掺杂剂离子半径之间的线性相关性，显示结构松弛在这一相关性中起着关键作用。
