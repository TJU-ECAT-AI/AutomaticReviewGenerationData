The scientific literature focuses on the detailed examination of the thermodynamic, electronic, and structural characteristics of Cu/CeO₂ surfaces and interfaces utilizing first-principles DFT+U calculations. This research aims to elucidate how dopants, specifically same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs), impact the catalytic properties of various metal oxides. Insights from both computational and experimental analyses shed light on the significant role of dopant behavior in diverse catalytic applications. However, the literature acknowledges the ongoing challenges in developing universally applicable predictive guidelines for dopant behavior, which take into account factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible.

本文主要关注通过第一原理DFT+U计算方法，对Cu/CeO₂表面及界面的热力学、电子学和结构性质进行深入研究。研究旨在阐明同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能。从计算和实验分析中获得的见解强调了掺杂剂行为在各种催化应用中的重要性。然而，文献指出，在发展适用于各种情况的一般预测规则以指导掺杂剂行为时仍存在挑战，这些规则需要考虑Lewis酸-碱相互作用以及宿主氧化物的性质，无论是可还原的还是不可还原的。
