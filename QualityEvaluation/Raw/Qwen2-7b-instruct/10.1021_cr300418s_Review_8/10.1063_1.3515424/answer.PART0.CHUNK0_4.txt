<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The research examines how dopants, both of the same valence (SVDs) and high valence (HVDs), impact the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. It also discusses the challenges in formulating general rules for predicting dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the host oxide's reducibility. Insights are gained from computational and experimental studies on their roles in various catalytic applications.
