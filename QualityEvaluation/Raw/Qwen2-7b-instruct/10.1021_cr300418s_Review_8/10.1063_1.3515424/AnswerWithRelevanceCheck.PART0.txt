          The scientific literature focuses on the detailed examination of the thermodynamic, electronic, and structural characteristics of Cu/CeO₂ surfaces and interfaces utilizing first-principles DFT+U calculations. This research aims to elucidate how dopants, specifically same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs), impact the catalytic properties of various metal oxides. Insights from both computational and experimental analyses shed light on the significant role of dopant behavior in diverse catalytic applications. However, the literature acknowledges the ongoing challenges in developing universally applicable predictive guidelines for dopant behavior, which take into account factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide, whether reducible or irreducible.
