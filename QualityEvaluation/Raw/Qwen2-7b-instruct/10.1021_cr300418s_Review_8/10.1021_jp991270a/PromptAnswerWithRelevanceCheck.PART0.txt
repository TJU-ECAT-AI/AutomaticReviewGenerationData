[1] "In the case of mixed oxides, the total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at 600 C (3045 atoms nm-2) is important and much larger than the calculated number of surface oxygens (1017 atoms nm-2) (Figure 4B)."
[2] "The temperature at the maximum rate of exchange (Tmax) varies between 440 and 540 C. As zirconium content increases, Tmax is progressively moved to higher temperature and the maximum rate of exchange increases."
[3] "For all oxides the total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at 600 C (3045 atoms nm-2) is important and much larger than the calculated number of surface oxygens (1017 atoms nm-2)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The dopants significantly affect the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly influencing their reactivity and oxygen storage capacity. The same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can alter the surface properties, such as the number of oxygen atoms accessible for catalytic reactions. This impacts the rate of exchange and the number of oxygen atoms that can be exchanged at high temperatures, demonstrating the importance of dopants in enhancing the catalytic performance. For instance, the presence of HVDs can shift the temperature at which the maximum rate of exchange occurs, indicating a modification in the oxygen mobility and storage within the material. The total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at high temperatures is often significantly higher than the number of surface oxygen atoms, highlighting the contribution of bulk oxygen in the catalytic process.

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by altering their structure and electronic properties. This leads to changes in the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts in various catalytic applications. Insights from computational and experimental studies indicate that dopants can modulate Lewis acid-base interactions within the host oxide, affecting its ability to adsorb and activate substrates.

2. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior because the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) plays a significant role in determining the effectiveness of dopants. The reducibility of the host oxide affects how easily dopants can be incorporated and their impact on the overall catalytic performance. Factors such as the coordination environment around the dopant site, the electronic structure of the host oxide, and the thermodynamics of dopant incorporation must be considered to develop accurate predictive models.
