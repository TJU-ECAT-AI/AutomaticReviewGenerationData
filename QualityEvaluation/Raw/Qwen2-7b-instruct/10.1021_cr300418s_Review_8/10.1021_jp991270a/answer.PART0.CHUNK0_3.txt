[1] "In this paper, OSC and redox properties of CeO2, ZrO2, and CexZr(1-x)O2 materials prepared by Rhodia are investigated, focusing on the correlation with 16O/18O isotopic exchange measurements."
[2] "This surprising observation could be explained by the increase in the amount of oxygen exchanged."
[3] "An optimum was identified for Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 with an OSC at 400 C of 219 μmol O g-1."
[4] "In the same way, oxygen storage takes place not only at the surface but also in the bulk for all oxides."
[5] "All mixed oxides are able to exchange very large amounts of oxygen compared to ceria, implying the participation of bulk oxygen."

1. The paper investigates the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and redox properties of ceria, zirconia, and ceria-zirconia mixed oxides, particularly correlating them with 16O/18O isotopic exchange measurements.
2. The increase in the amount of oxygen exchanged might explain the observed shift in the temperature at which the maximum rate of exchange occurs.
3. Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 was found to have the highest oxygen storage capacity at 400°C, reaching 219 μmol O g-1.
4. Oxygen storage capacity extends beyond the surface to the bulk in all studied oxides.
5. The mixed oxides demonstrate a significantly higher ability to exchange oxygen compared to pure ceria, suggesting the involvement of bulk oxygen in the storage process.

1. 研究了铈氧化物、锆氧化物以及铈锆混合氧化物的氧存储容量（OSC）和还原性，特别关注了16O/18O同位素交换测量与之的相关性。
2. 氧交换量的增加可能解释了观察到的最大交换速率温度变化现象。
3. 在400°C时，Ce0.63Zr0.37O2具有最高的氧存储容量，达到219 μmol O g-1。
4. 氧存储不仅限于表面，所有研究的氧化物中内部也存在氧存储。
5. 混合氧化物在氧气交换能力上显著高于纯铈氧化物，这表明在存储过程中涉及了内部氧的参与。
