[2] "Three-way catalysts simultaneously have to oxidize CO and hydrocarbons (HC) to CO2 and reduce NOx to N2."
[3] "Ceriumzirconium mixed oxides (CexZr(1-x)O2), precalcined at 900 C in dry air, were supplied by Rhodia Terres Rares as monophasic solid solutions."
[4] "All mixed oxides are able to exchange very large amounts of oxygen compared to ceria, implying the participation of bulk oxygen."
[5] "Furthermore, on CexZr(1-x)O2 samples, oxygen is predominantly exchanged via a multiple heteroexchange mechanism involving surface dioxygen species as superoxides or peroxides."
[6] "Ceriumzirconium mixed oxides (CexZr(1-x)O2) are able to store and release oxygen."
[7] "The largest OSC is obtained for Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 with 219 μmol O g-1 (5.5 μmol O m-2)."
[8] "Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 is the most reactive sample toward O2, as already seen before from OSC measurements."
[9] "Mixed oxides were able to store 4 times more oxygen than pure ceria."
[10] "The total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at 600 C (3045 atoms nm-2) is important and much larger than the calculated number of surface oxygens (1017 atoms nm-2)."
[11] "For CeO2 and Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 oxides, surface oxygen atoms are already totally exchanged by 400 C."
[12] "This process also involves bulk oxygen atoms, with up to three oxygen layers exchanged."
[13] "The temperature at the maximum rate of exchange (Tmax) varies between 440 and 540 C."
[14] "In the case of pure ZrO2, 18O2 exchange only occurs at elevated temperature (Tmax = 570 C)."
[15] "As zirconium content increases, Tmax is progressively moved to higher temperature and the maximum rate of exchange increases."
[16] "The total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at 600 C (3045 atoms nm-2) is important and much larger than the calculated number of surface oxygens (1017 atoms nm-2)."
[17] "The variation in partial pressures, information on the rate of exchange (Re), the number of oxygen exchanged (Ne), and the type of exchange mechanism may be obtained."
[18] "In our case, simple and multiple heteroexchange mechanisms are differentiated at the beginning of the reaction by prior appearance in the gas phase of 18O16O or 16O2, respectively."

1. Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides by altering their structure and electronic properties. This leads to changes in the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts in various catalytic applications. Insights from computational and experimental studies indicate that dopants can modulate Lewis acid-base interactions within the host oxide, affecting its ability to adsorb and activate substrates.

2. Challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior because the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) plays a significant role in determining the effectiveness of dopants. The reducibility of the host oxide affects how easily dopants can be incorporated and their impact on the overall catalytic performance. Factors such as the coordination environment around the dopant site, the electronic structure of the host oxide, and the thermodynamics of dopant incorporation must be considered to develop accurate predictive models.

1. 同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）通过改变不同金属氧化物的结构和电子性质，影响它们的催化性能。在各种催化应用中，这导致催化剂反应性和选择性的变化。从计算和实验研究中获得的见解表明，掺杂物可以调节宿主氧化物内的Lewis酸碱相互作用，从而影响其吸附和激活底物的能力。

2. 在制定用于预测掺杂物行为的一般预测规则时，存在一些挑战。宿主氧化物的可还原性与不可还原性对掺杂物的影响方式有所不同，这影响了掺杂物的有效性以及整体催化性能。必须考虑掺杂物插入的热力学、宿主氧化物的电子结构以及掺杂物周围环境等因素，以开发准确的预测模型。
