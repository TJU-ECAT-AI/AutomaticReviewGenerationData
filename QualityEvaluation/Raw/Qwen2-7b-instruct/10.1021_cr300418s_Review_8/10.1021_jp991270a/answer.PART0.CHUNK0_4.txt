<p>In the case of mixed oxides, the total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at 600 C (3045 atoms nm-2) is important and much larger than the calculated number of surface oxygens (1017 atoms nm-2).</p>
<p>From Table 4 we can see that this process also involves bulk oxygen atoms, with up to three oxygen layers exchanged (Nl).</p>
<p>Ceriumzirconium mixed oxides are much more reducible than CeO2.</p>
<p>The largest OSC is obtained for Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 with 219 μmol O g-1 (5.5 μmol O m-2).</p>
<p>Oxygen storage takes place not only at the surface but also in the bulk for all oxides.</p>
<p>No change in the interpretations occurs when considering an average (100) + (110) + (111) surface instead of the (100) surface.</p>
<p>For pure CeO2, two peaks are observed around 600 and 800 C corresponding to the reduction of the surface and the bulk, respectively.</p>
<p>The absence of any features at elevated temperature, presented as indicative of crystalline defects, could be taken as additional proof for the high perfection of the fluorite type structure of our ceria sample.</p>
<p>The maximum O2 uptake was observed for solids with 0.6  x  0.8, with an OSCC at 377 C of approximately 185 μmol O2 g-1.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, the reduction of these oxides is much slower than their reoxidation.</p>
<p>For all mixed oxides the total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at 600 C (3045 atoms nm-2) is important and much larger than the calculated number of surface oxygens (1017 atoms nm-2).</p>
<p>On Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, the oxidation of C16O to C16O2 occurs much more quickly than on CeO2. Oxygen is then much more mobile in this mixed oxide than in ceria.</p>
<p>By substitution of Ce4+ by Zr4+, the reducibility of the solids is widely modified. Ceriumzirconium mixed oxides are much more reducible than CeO2.</p>
<p>The number of surface oxygen atoms is estimated to be 14.2 atoms nm-2 (cubic structure: a, b, c = 5.31 Å, (100) surface) with a theoretical OSC of 3.7 μmol O m-2 while OSC measurements gave 5.5 μmol O m-2.</p>
<p>The variation in partial pressures, information on the rate of exchange (Re), the number of oxygen exchanged (Ne), and the type of exchange mechanism may be obtained.</p>
<p>Simple and multiple heteroexchange mechanisms are differentiated at the beginning of the reaction by prior appearance in the gas phase of 18O16O or 16O2, respectively.</p>
<p>During OSCC measurements, CO uptake on an oxidized sample slowly decreases as the number of injected pulses increases.</p>
