[1] "In the case of mixed oxides, the total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at 600 C (3045 atoms nm-2) is important and much larger than the calculated number of surface oxygens (1017 atoms nm-2) (Figure 4B)."
[2] "The temperature at the maximum rate of exchange (Tmax) varies between 440 and 540 C. As zirconium content increases, Tmax is progressively moved to higher temperature and the maximum rate of exchange increases."
[3] "For all oxides the total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at 600 C (3045 atoms nm-2) is important and much larger than the calculated number of surface oxygens (1017 atoms nm-2)."

The dopants significantly affect the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly influencing their reactivity and oxygen storage capacity. The same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) can alter the surface properties, such as the number of oxygen atoms accessible for catalytic reactions. This impacts the rate of exchange and the number of oxygen atoms that can be exchanged at high temperatures, demonstrating the importance of dopants in enhancing the catalytic performance. For instance, the presence of HVDs can shift the temperature at which the maximum rate of exchange occurs, indicating a modification in the oxygen mobility and storage within the material. The total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at high temperatures is often significantly higher than the number of surface oxygen atoms, highlighting the contribution of bulk oxygen in the catalytic process.

掺杂剂对金属氧化物的催化性质有显著影响，特别是对它们的活性和氧存储能力的影响。同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）可以改变表面特性，如可进行催化反应的氧原子数量。这影响了交换速率和在高温下可交换的氧原子数量，表明掺杂剂在提高催化性能中的重要性。例如，高价掺杂剂的存在可以使最大交换速率发生的温度发生偏移，表明氧的移动性和存储在材料中发生了修改。高温下交换的总氧原子数量往往远高于表面氧原子的数量，强调了在催化过程中内部氧的贡献。
