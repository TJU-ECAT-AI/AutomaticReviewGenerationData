[1] "In this paper, OSC and redox properties of CeO2, ZrO2, and CexZr(1-x)O2 materials prepared by Rhodia are investigated, focusing on the correlation with 16O/18O isotopic exchange measurements."
[2] "Ceriumzirconium mixed oxides (CexZr(1-x)O2), precalcined at 900 C in dry air, were supplied by Rhodia Terres Rares as monophasic solid solutions."
[3] "All mixed oxides are able to exchange very large amounts of oxygen compared to ceria, implying the participation of bulk oxygen."
[4] "Furthermore, on CexZr(1-x)O2 samples, oxygen is predominantly exchanged via a multiple heteroexchange mechanism involving surface dioxygen species as superoxides or peroxides."

How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?
