[1] "Recently we demonstrated that, along with the low-frequency shifts, adsorption of hydrocarbons by cationic forms of zeolites also results in very unusual intensity distribution of the CH stretching bands."
[2] "Therefore, we proposed to use intensities of IR bands as an additional spectral criterion for activation of adsorbed paraffins."
[3] "In other words, intensities of the IR stretching bands are closely related to additional polarization of chemical bonds resulting from their vibrational excitation."
[4] "Indeed, if intensities of IR bands from different vibrational modes change upon adsorption in a different way, this indicates a different polarizability of chemical bonds involved in different vibrational modes."
[5] "Therefore, it is nothing surprising that, according to the DRIFT spectra shown in Figure 2, the stronger form of molecular adsorption is involved in subsequent heterolytic dissociation of ethane at elevated temperatures."
[6] "The occurrence of heterolytic dissociative adsorption already at room temperature implies a low activation barrier."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, involving four main steps: 
1. Activation of the substrate, leading to the formation of a transition state.  
2. Formation of a complex between the substrate and the catalyst.  
3. Breaking of the substrate's bonds, leading to the release of hydrogen.  
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface.  
Regarding the debate about the rate-limiting step, the consensus is that the activation step is usually considered the rate-limiting step. This is because the activation energy barrier is typically high, requiring substantial energy input to overcome. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the interactions between the substrate, catalyst, and hydrogen atoms. The mechanism's relevance to industrial processes and the potential for developing more efficient catalysts make it a critical area of research.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应，涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 催化剂对底物的活化，导致形成过渡态。
2. 底物与催化剂形成复合物。  
3. 断裂底物分子键，释放氢气。  
4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附。  
关于速率决定步骤的辩论，共识是活化步骤通常是决定性的。这是因为激活能垒通常很高，需要大量能量输入才能克服。尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学研究中的热点和争议话题，因为底物、催化剂和氢原子之间复杂的相互作用使其复杂。该机制对于工业过程的关联性和开发更高效的催化剂的可能性使其成为一个关键的研究领域。
