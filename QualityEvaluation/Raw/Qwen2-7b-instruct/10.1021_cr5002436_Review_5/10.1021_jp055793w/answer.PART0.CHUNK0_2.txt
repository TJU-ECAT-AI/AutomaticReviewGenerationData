[1] "Recently we demonstrated that, along with the low-frequency shifts, adsorption of hydrocarbons by cationic forms of zeolites also results in very unusual intensity distribution of the CH stretching bands."
[2] "Therefore, we proposed to use intensities of IR bands as an additional spectral criterion for activation of adsorbed paraffins."
[3] "Indeed, if intensities of IR bands from different vibrational modes change upon adsorption in a different way, this indicates a different polarizability of chemical bonds involved in different vibrational modes."
[4] "In addition, the intensities of IR stretching bands better reproduce the tendency of adsorbed molecules for their subsequent polarization and activation via vibrational excitation, while the shifts of IR bands to the lower frequencies are related to perturbation of the ground states of adsorbed molecules."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is hydrogen abstraction, where a hydrogen atom is removed from the substrate molecule. The second step is the formation of an intermediate complex, involving the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by the catalyst. The third step is the rearrangement of the intermediate complex, leading to the formation of a product and the regeneration of the catalyst. The fourth step is the desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it provides insights into the fundamental processes involved in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The controversy around the rate-limiting step highlights the complexity of these reactions and the challenges in understanding the precise sequence of events involved in the conversion of hydrocarbons to lighter hydrocarbons and other products. The ability to control and optimize these reactions is crucial for various industrial applications, including the production of petrochemicals and fuels. The mechanism's continued study helps in the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, which can lead to significant improvements in the energy efficiency and environmental impact of these processes.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。第一步是氢原子抽象，从基团分子中移除一个氢原子。第二步是形成中间复合物，通过催化剂移除基团分子上的氢原子形成中间复合物。第三步是中间复合物的重组，导致产物的形成和催化剂的再生。第四步是产物从催化剂表面的脱附。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性的持续辩论仍然是科学兴趣的话题和争议。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是一个科学兴趣的话题，因为它提供了理解催化脱氢反应基本过程的见解。围绕速率限制性步骤的争议凸显了这些反应的复杂性和理解涉及转换轻烃和其它产品的精确事件序列的挑战。控制和优化这些反应的能力对于各种工业应用至关重要，包括石油化学品和燃料的生产。对机制的持续研究有助于开发更高效和选择性的催化剂，这可以导致这些过程在能效和环境影响方面的显著改进。
