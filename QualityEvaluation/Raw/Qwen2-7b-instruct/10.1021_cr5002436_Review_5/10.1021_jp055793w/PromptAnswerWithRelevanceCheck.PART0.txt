[1] "Recently we demonstrated that, along with the low-frequency shifts, adsorption of hydrocarbons by cationic forms of zeolites also results in very unusual intensity distribution of the CH stretching bands."
[2] "Therefore, we proposed to use intensities of IR bands as an additional spectral criterion for activation of adsorbed paraffins."
[3] "In other words, intensities of the IR stretching bands are closely related to additional polarization of chemical bonds resulting from their vibrational excitation."
[4] "Indeed, if intensities of IR bands from different vibrational modes change upon adsorption in a different way, this indicates a different polarizability of chemical bonds involved in different vibrational modes."
[5] "Therefore, it is nothing surprising that, according to the DRIFT spectra shown in Figure 2, the stronger form of molecular adsorption is involved in subsequent heterolytic dissociation of ethane at elevated temperatures."
[6] "The occurrence of heterolytic dissociative adsorption already at room temperature implies a low activation barrier."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, involving four main steps: 
1. Activation of the substrate, leading to the formation of a transition state.  
2. Formation of a complex between the substrate and the catalyst.  
3. Breaking of the substrate's bonds, leading to the release of hydrogen.  
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface.  
Regarding the debate about the rate-limiting step, the consensus is that the activation step is usually considered the rate-limiting step. This is because the activation energy barrier is typically high, requiring substantial energy input to overcome. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the interactions between the substrate, catalyst, and hydrogen atoms. The mechanism's relevance to industrial processes and the potential for developing more efficient catalysts make it a critical area of research.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应，涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 催化剂对底物的活化，导致形成过渡态。
2. 底物与催化剂形成复合物。  
3. 断裂底物分子键，释放氢气。  
4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附。  
关于速率决定步骤的辩论，共识是活化步骤通常是决定性的。这是因为激活能垒通常很高，需要大量能量输入才能克服。尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学研究中的热点和争议话题，因为底物、催化剂和氢原子之间复杂的相互作用使其复杂。该机制对于工业过程的关联性和开发更高效的催化剂的可能性使其成为一个关键的研究领域。

<p>The present study reports an unusual diffuse reflection Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectrum of ethane adsorbed by gallium oxide. One of the stretching CH bands in this spectrum with a maximum at 2753 cm-1 is more than by 100 cm-1 shifted toward lower frequencies in comparison with gaseous ethane.</p>
<p>In addition, the relative intensity of this band is unusually high. This indicates a very strong polarizability of the corresponding chemical bonds resulting from perturbation of ethane by the low coordinated Ga3+ cations.</p>
<p>This indicates that these vibrations are involved in subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption.</p>
<p>The obtained results indicate that, similar to the shifts of CH stretching vibrations to the low-frequency, intensities of IR CH stretching bands can be also used as an index of chemical activation of adsorbed paraffins via their polarization by the low-coordinated cations.</p>
<p>Indeed, according to the fundamentals of IR spectroscopy, intensities of the stretching bands are proportional to the squares of the derivatives of additional dipole moment (dμ) created by the stretching of chemical bonds via their vibrations over normal coordinate (q) of these vibrations:</p>
<p>Therefore, any additional information on the mechanism of perturbation of vibrational modes resulting from adsorption is highly desirable. Such information can be gained from intensities of IR stretching bands.</p>
<p>If intensities of IR bands from different vibrational modes change upon adsorption in a different way, this indicates a different polarizability of chemical bonds involved in different vibrational modes.</p>
<p>Below we present another example illustrating the application of such an approach to dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane by gallium oxide.</p>
<p>For more convincing interpretation of the experimentally observed DRIFT spectra, positions and intensities of the IR bands were compared with results of DFT modeling of ethane adsorption by the low-coordinated Ga3+ ions in the simplest Ga2O3 cluster.</p>
<p>Indeed, as follows from Figure 1, intensities of some of the narrow bands at higher frequencies decrease upon lowering of ethane pressure more rapidly than of the broad band at 2753 cm-1.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the narrow bands remain visible even after evacuation of ethane for 5 min.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, new DRIFTS bands appear in the OH stretching region at of 3620 and 3633 cm-1 (Figure 3).</p>
<p>Thus, even a very crude modeling of the low coordinated Ga3+ ions explains reasonably well our experimental results, while the unusually high intensity of the broad band from the initially fully symmetric ν1 stretching vibrations very strongly perturbed by adsorption indicates extremely high polarizability of the corresponding chemical bonds.</p>
<p>Due to subsequent vibrational excitation, polarization of CH bonds in the methyl group contacting gallium cation increases.</p>
<p>This results in subsequent abstraction of protons by the adjacent oxygen atom of the cluster with simultaneous formation of a new carbongallium bond.</p>
<p>Formation of hydrides is evidenced by the appearance of the IR band with a stretching frequency of 1969 cm-1 with a high frequency shoulder at 1981 cm-1.</p>
<p>As follows from Figure 6, decomposition of ethyl fragments starts above 423 K, while the comparison of Figures 2 and 6 reveals that, in the temperature interval of 423473 K, heterolytic dissociative adsorption and decomposition of ethyl fragment occurs in parallel.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is hydrogen abstraction, where a hydrogen atom is removed from the substrate molecule. The second step is the formation of an intermediate complex, involving the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by the catalyst. The third step is the rearrangement of the intermediate complex, leading to the formation of a product and the regeneration of the catalyst. The fourth step is the desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it provides insights into the fundamental processes involved in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The controversy around the rate-limiting step highlights the complexity of these reactions and the challenges in understanding the precise sequence of events involved in the conversion of hydrocarbons to lighter hydrocarbons and other products. The ability to control and optimize these reactions is crucial for various industrial applications, including the production of petrochemicals and fuels. The mechanism's continued study helps in the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, which can lead to significant improvements in the energy efficiency and environmental impact of these processes.

The document presents an example of utilizing infrared (IR) spectroscopy to analyze the activation of adsorbed molecules, specifically ethane adsorbed onto gallium oxide. It focuses on the unusual intensity distribution of the CH stretching bands in the infrared spectrum. This intensity distribution provides information about the polarizability of the chemical bonds involved, indicating how the ethane molecules are activated by the gallium oxide surface. The study confirms that the intensities of the IR bands can be used as a spectral criterion for assessing the activation state of adsorbed paraffins, particularly through their polarization by the gallium oxide surface. This approach offers insights into the mechanism of adsorption and subsequent activation processes, such as heterolytic dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation, providing a new explanation for selectivity in acid-catalyzed reactions at the molecular level.

In essence, the study illustrates that the intensity of IR bands, in conjunction with their frequency shifts, can serve as powerful indicators for understanding the chemical activation of adsorbed molecules, offering a novel method for analyzing and interpreting the interactions between adsorbates and surfaces in catalytic processes. The use of DFT modeling further supports the experimental findings by predicting the adsorption mechanism and the vibrational modes involved, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the chemical processes at play.

The document emphasizes the utility of this approach in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly for acid or base catalysis, where the activation of adsorbed molecules often arises from polarization by the active sites. By analyzing the intensity of IR stretching bands, researchers can gain insights into the anisotropic polarization of adsorbed molecules upon vibrational excitation, which is crucial for understanding the enhanced reactivity resulting from adsorption. This spectral criterion provides a quantitative measure of the chemical activation state, potentially aiding in the design of more efficient catalysts and catalytic processes.
