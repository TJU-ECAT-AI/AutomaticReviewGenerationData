<p>The present study reports an unusual diffuse reflection Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectrum of ethane adsorbed by gallium oxide. One of the stretching CH bands in this spectrum with a maximum at 2753 cm-1 is more than by 100 cm-1 shifted toward lower frequencies in comparison with gaseous ethane.</p>
<p>In addition, the relative intensity of this band is unusually high. This indicates a very strong polarizability of the corresponding chemical bonds resulting from perturbation of ethane by the low coordinated Ga3+ cations.</p>
<p>This indicates that these vibrations are involved in subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption.</p>
<p>The obtained results indicate that, similar to the shifts of CH stretching vibrations to the low-frequency, intensities of IR CH stretching bands can be also used as an index of chemical activation of adsorbed paraffins via their polarization by the low-coordinated cations.</p>
<p>Indeed, according to the fundamentals of IR spectroscopy, intensities of the stretching bands are proportional to the squares of the derivatives of additional dipole moment (dμ) created by the stretching of chemical bonds via their vibrations over normal coordinate (q) of these vibrations:</p>
<p>Therefore, any additional information on the mechanism of perturbation of vibrational modes resulting from adsorption is highly desirable. Such information can be gained from intensities of IR stretching bands.</p>
<p>If intensities of IR bands from different vibrational modes change upon adsorption in a different way, this indicates a different polarizability of chemical bonds involved in different vibrational modes.</p>
<p>Below we present another example illustrating the application of such an approach to dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane by gallium oxide.</p>
<p>For more convincing interpretation of the experimentally observed DRIFT spectra, positions and intensities of the IR bands were compared with results of DFT modeling of ethane adsorption by the low-coordinated Ga3+ ions in the simplest Ga2O3 cluster.</p>
<p>Indeed, as follows from Figure 1, intensities of some of the narrow bands at higher frequencies decrease upon lowering of ethane pressure more rapidly than of the broad band at 2753 cm-1.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the narrow bands remain visible even after evacuation of ethane for 5 min.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, new DRIFTS bands appear in the OH stretching region at of 3620 and 3633 cm-1 (Figure 3).</p>
<p>Thus, even a very crude modeling of the low coordinated Ga3+ ions explains reasonably well our experimental results, while the unusually high intensity of the broad band from the initially fully symmetric ν1 stretching vibrations very strongly perturbed by adsorption indicates extremely high polarizability of the corresponding chemical bonds.</p>
<p>Due to subsequent vibrational excitation, polarization of CH bonds in the methyl group contacting gallium cation increases.</p>
<p>This results in subsequent abstraction of protons by the adjacent oxygen atom of the cluster with simultaneous formation of a new carbongallium bond.</p>
<p>Formation of hydrides is evidenced by the appearance of the IR band with a stretching frequency of 1969 cm-1 with a high frequency shoulder at 1981 cm-1.</p>
<p>As follows from Figure 6, decomposition of ethyl fragments starts above 423 K, while the comparison of Figures 2 and 6 reveals that, in the temperature interval of 423473 K, heterolytic dissociative adsorption and decomposition of ethyl fragment occurs in parallel.</p>

The study discusses the unusual infrared spectrum of ethane adsorbed onto gallium oxide, noting significant shifts and polarizability changes in the chemical bonds due to the interaction with the low-coordinated Ga3+ cations. The authors also explore the potential for dehydrogenation through heterolytic dissociative adsorption, involving the abstraction of protons by adjacent oxygen atoms. The research supports the use of infrared band intensities as indicators of chemical activation and polarization, providing insights into the mechanism of ethane adsorption and dissociation on gallium oxide surfaces. The DFT modeling complements the experimental findings, offering a theoretical understanding of the adsorption process. The study highlights the potential for utilizing intensities of IR stretching bands as additional criteria for assessing the chemical activation of adsorbed paraffins, indicating the ongoing interest and debate in this field despite its long history of investigation.
