[1] "Recently we demonstrated that, along with the low-frequency shifts, adsorption of hydrocarbons by cationic forms of zeolites also results in very unusual intensity distribution of the CH stretching bands."
[2] "Therefore, we proposed to use intensities of IR bands as an additional spectral criterion for activation of adsorbed paraffins."
[3] "Indeed, according to the fundamentals of IR spectroscopy, intensities of the stretching bands are proportional to the squares of the derivatives of additional dipole moment (dμ) created by the stretching of chemical bonds via their vibrations over normal coordinate (q) of these vibrations."
[4] "However, these shifts may arise from different mechanisms of chemical activation."
[5] "For instance, they may be connected with donor-acceptor bonding, with positive or negative charging of adsorbed molecules, with their polarization by the active sites, etc."
[6] "In this connection, any additional information on the mechanism of perturbation of vibrational modes resulting from adsorption is highly desirable."
[7] "Such information can be gained from intensities of IR stretching bands."
[8] "Indeed, if intensities of IR bands from different vibrational modes change upon adsorption in a different way, this indicates a different polarizability of chemical bonds involved in different vibrational modes."
[9] "Therefore, intensities of IR stretching bands can provide information on anisotropy of polarization of adsorbed molecules upon their vibrational excitation."
[10] "In refs 13, such new spectral approach was supported by our experimental results on adsorption of methane and ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Zn2+ cations."
[11] "In these studies we demonstrated that, at elevated temperatures, the most intense CH vibrations, which correspond to the stretching of the highly polarized CH bonds of molecules adsorbed by the coordinatively unsaturated zinc cations, are involved in subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption via abstraction of protons by the adjacent basic oxygen atoms."
[12] "Below we present another example illustrating the application of such an approach to dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane by gallium oxide."
[13] "For more convincing interpretation of the experimentally observed DRIFT spectra, positions and intensities of the IR bands were compared with results of DFT modeling of ethane adsorption by the low-coordinated Ga3+ ions in the simplest Ga2O3 cluster."
[14] "Indeed, as follows from Figure 1, intensities of some of the narrow bands at higher frequencies decrease upon lowering of ethane pressure more rapidly than of the broad band at 2753 cm-1."
[15] "Therefore, they belong to the weaker form, while the broad band to the stronger form of molecular adsorption."
[16] "On the other hand, some of the narrow bands remain visible even after evacuation of ethane for 5 min."
[17] "This indicates that they belong to the strongest form, which corresponds to dissociative adsorption."
[18] "To obtain the individual spectrum of the stronger molecular form, we subtracted spectrum (4) in Figure 1 from spectrum (3)."
[19] "The resulting spectrum of the stronger form of molecular adsorption is shown in Figure 4."
[20] "The very intense and very strongly shifted toward low-frequency broad CH stretching band in this spectrum is quite remarkable."
[21] "The large shift of this band toward low-frequency indicates a very strong perturbation of adsorbed ethane."
[22] "On the other hand, the very high relative intensity of this band in comparison with the other CH stretching bands indicates extremely high polarizability of the bonds involved in the corresponding vibration."
[23] "Obviously, the perturbation and polarization of the other CH bonds are much weaker."
[24] "These results are similar to those earlier reported in our study2 on ethane adsorption by Zn2+ ions in ZnZSM-5 zeolite, where it was also shown that polarization of adsorbed molecules was followed by heterolytic dissociative adsorption at elevated temperatures."
[25] "Therefore, it is nothing surprising that, according to the DRIFT spectra shown in Figure 2, the stronger form of molecular adsorption is involved in subsequent heterolytic dissociation of ethane at elevated temperatures."
[26] "As follows from spectrum (4) in Figure 1, the dissociative adsorption to a very low extent starts already at room temperature, whereas according to Figure 2 at higher temperatures the intensities of IR bands from the ethyl-gallium species become much stronger."
[27] "The mechanism of the unusually easy heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane could be most likely described in the following way."
[28] "Due to subsequent vibrational excitation, polarization of CH bonds in the methyl group contacting gallium cation increases."
[29] "This results in subsequent abstraction of protons by the adjacent oxygen atom of the cluster with simultaneous formation of a new carbongallium bond."
[30] "Formation of hydrides is evidenced by the appearance of the IR band with a stretching frequency of 1969 cm-1 with a high frequency shoulder at 1981 cm-1."
[31] "These frequencies are close to 1976 and 1993 cm-1 reported in ref 9 for Ga2H6 vapor."
[32] "As follows from Figure 6, decomposition of ethyl fragments starts above 423 K, while the comparison of Figures 2 and 6 reveals that, in the temperature interval of 423473 K, heterolytic dissociative adsorption and decomposition of ethyl fragment occurs in parallel."
[33] "This obviously indicates dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethyl species, which is also confirmed by appearance of the weak CH stretching band at 3046 cm-1 that should be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of CH2 groups in resulting ethylene (Figure 2)."
[34] "Thus, the above results present another example of utilization of intensities of IR stretching bands as an additional spectral criterion of chemical activation of adsorbed light paraffins via their polarization by Lewis acid active sites."

The document presents an example of utilizing infrared (IR) spectroscopy to analyze the activation of adsorbed molecules, specifically ethane adsorbed onto gallium oxide. It focuses on the unusual intensity distribution of the CH stretching bands in the infrared spectrum. This intensity distribution provides information about the polarizability of the chemical bonds involved, indicating how the ethane molecules are activated by the gallium oxide surface. The study confirms that the intensities of the IR bands can be used as a spectral criterion for assessing the activation state of adsorbed paraffins, particularly through their polarization by the gallium oxide surface. This approach offers insights into the mechanism of adsorption and subsequent activation processes, such as heterolytic dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation, providing a new explanation for selectivity in acid-catalyzed reactions at the molecular level.

In essence, the study illustrates that the intensity of IR bands, in conjunction with their frequency shifts, can serve as powerful indicators for understanding the chemical activation of adsorbed molecules, offering a novel method for analyzing and interpreting the interactions between adsorbates and surfaces in catalytic processes. The use of DFT modeling further supports the experimental findings by predicting the adsorption mechanism and the vibrational modes involved, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the chemical processes at play.

The document emphasizes the utility of this approach in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly for acid or base catalysis, where the activation of adsorbed molecules often arises from polarization by the active sites. By analyzing the intensity of IR stretching bands, researchers can gain insights into the anisotropic polarization of adsorbed molecules upon vibrational excitation, which is crucial for understanding the enhanced reactivity resulting from adsorption. This spectral criterion provides a quantitative measure of the chemical activation state, potentially aiding in the design of more efficient catalysts and catalytic processes.
