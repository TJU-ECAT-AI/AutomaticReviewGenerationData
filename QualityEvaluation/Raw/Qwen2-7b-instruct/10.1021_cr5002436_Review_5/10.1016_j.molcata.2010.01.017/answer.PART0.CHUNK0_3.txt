1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the molecule, (3) reaction on the surface, and (4) desorption of the product. Despite nearly a century of study, the debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting continues. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the catalytic process and the influence of various factors on the reaction kinetics.

2. The dehydrogenation of propane is a significant process in petrochemical industries for producing propylene, which plays a crucial role in the production of various olefin-based products. However, the process faces challenges such as coke formation and thermodynamic limitations, making alternative methods, like dehydrogenation oxidation (DHO), more favorable due to their ability to selectively oxidize hydrogen.

3. The dehydrogenation of propane leads to a series of side reactions, including deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, resulting in the formation of a range of fragments from C1 to C3 species adsorbed on the catalyst surface. These reactions are essential in understanding the complex behavior of propane during dehydrogenation.

4. Extensive experimental studies on hydrocarbon adsorption over transition metals have provided valuable insights into the adsorption processes and surface reactions, contributing significantly to the development of more efficient catalytic systems.

5. The modern theoretical surface science offers a unique opportunity to investigate the chemisorption and surface reactions at the atomic scale, enhancing our understanding of catalytic processes and potentially leading to the discovery of more effective catalysts.

6. The focus of the current study is on predicting the possible products of the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane through thermodynamic analysis, utilizing computational methods to understand the stability and energetics of different intermediates involved in the process.
