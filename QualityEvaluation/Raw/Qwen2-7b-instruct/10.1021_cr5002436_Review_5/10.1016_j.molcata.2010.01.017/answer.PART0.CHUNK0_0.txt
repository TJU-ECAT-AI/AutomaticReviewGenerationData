The study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the dehydrogenation and cleavage of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds based on the chemisorption of intermediates on a platinum (Pt) (1 1 1) surface. It specifically focuses on C3 intermediates to predict the possible products of propane's dehydrogenation and cracking from a thermodynamic perspective. The dehydrogenation of the methyl group distant from the Pt surface in the C3 species is not considered. The paper is structured into sections detailing computational methods, determining adsorption energies, favored binding sites, optimized configurations, and reaction heat changes. Section 4 discusses the chemisorption and stability of hydrocarbons to predict the preferred intermediate in the dehydrogenation process and the starting point for CC scission.

本研究采用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，基于Pt（1 1 1）表面的化学吸附，探究脱氢和碳-碳（CC）键断裂。特别关注C3中间体，从热力学角度预测丙烷脱氢和裂解的可能产物。不考虑远离Pt表面的甲基团在C3物种中的脱氢作用。论文分为几部分，详细描述计算方法，确定吸附能、最有利吸附位置、优化构型以及Pt（1 1 1）上的反应热变化。第四部分讨论了烃类的化学吸附和稳定性，以预测脱氢过程中的首选中间体和CC断裂的起始点。
