[1] "In the past three decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to improving a low energy consumption and inexpensive technology to feed the ever-increasing demand for olefins. Propylene plays a key role in petrochemical industry, and it is profitable to produce it from propane."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane involves a large number of side reactions including the deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of propane which lead to numerous fragments ranging from C1 to C3 species adsorbed on the catalyst surface."
[3] "The chemisorption of hydrocarbons on Pt surface has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally."
[4] "Much theoretical work has been conducted to explore the adsorption and reactions of hydrocarbons in the past decade, especially for the C1 and C2 species."
[5] "In the present study, DFT calculations are employed to investigate the dehydrogenation and CC cleavage based on the chemisorption of the intermediates on Pt(1 1 1)."

The study employs density functional theory (DFT) to analyze the chemisorption of various hydrocarbon intermediates on a platinum (Pt) surface. The focus is on understanding the dehydrogenation and carbon-carbon (CC) cleavage processes, particularly concerning the formation and stability of C1, C2, and C3 species derived from propane.

This research contributes to the broader field of catalysis, aiming to optimize the production of olefinic compounds like propylene from hydrocarbons such as propane. By examining the adsorption energetics, favored binding sites, and geometric configurations of these intermediates, the study seeks to predict the most likely pathways for dehydrogenation and CC scission reactions, thereby providing insights into enhancing the efficiency of petrochemical processes.
