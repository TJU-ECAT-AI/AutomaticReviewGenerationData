The study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the dehydrogenation and cleavage of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds based on the chemisorption of intermediates on a platinum (Pt) (1 1 1) surface. It specifically focuses on C3 intermediates to predict the possible products of propane's dehydrogenation and cracking from a thermodynamic perspective. The dehydrogenation of the methyl group distant from the Pt surface in the C3 species is not considered. The paper is structured into sections detailing computational methods, determining adsorption energies, favored binding sites, optimized configurations, and reaction heat changes. Section 4 discusses the chemisorption and stability of hydrocarbons to predict the preferred intermediate in the dehydrogenation process and the starting point for CC scission.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely discussed topic in the scientific community. It involves four main steps: 
1. Activation of the hydrogen molecule (H2) by the catalyst.
2. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface.
3. Formation of an activated complex through the breaking of the substrate molecule's bonds by the catalyst.
4. Release of the product molecules from the catalyst surface.

Regarding the ongoing debate about which step is considered rate-limiting, various studies and analyses have proposed different viewpoints. Some argue that the activation of hydrogen is the rate-determining step, while others suggest that the formation of the activated complex or the release of the product might be more critical depending on the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the substrate.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation processes. Understanding the rate-limiting step can guide the development of more effective catalysts and reaction conditions, leading to improvements in the performance of industrial processes, such as the production of olefins from hydrocarbons.

Despite nearly a century of study, the precise dynamics and mechanisms involved in the Horiuti-Polanyi pathway continue to evolve as new insights emerge from advanced computational simulations and experimental techniques. This ongoing exploration not only refines our understanding of catalytic dehydrogenation but also opens avenues for optimizing existing processes and developing novel catalytic systems for more sustainable chemical synthesis.

霍里图-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应是一个在科学界广泛讨论的话题。它涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 催化剂激活氢分子（H2）。
2. 将基质分子吸附到催化剂表面。
3. 在催化剂的作用下，通过断裂基质分子的键形成活化复合物。
4. 产品分子从催化剂表面释放。

关于哪一步被认为是速率限制性步骤的争论，各种研究和分析提出了不同的观点。一些人认为氢的激活是决定性的，而其他人则根据特定的反应条件和基质的性质认为复合物的形成或产品的释放可能更为关键。

由于它影响脱氢过程的效率和选择性，因此该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。理解速率限制步骤可以指导更有效的催化剂和反应条件的发展，从而改善工业过程的性能，如从烃类生产烯烃。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但霍里图-波兰尼路径的精确动态和机制仍然随着高级计算模拟和实验技术的新发现而不断演变。这一持续探索不仅细化了我们对催化脱氢的理解，也为优化现有过程和开发新型催化系统开辟了可持续化学合成的新途径。

1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the molecule, (3) reaction on the surface, and (4) desorption of the product. Despite nearly a century of study, the debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting continues. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the catalytic process and the influence of various factors on the reaction kinetics.

2. The dehydrogenation of propane is a significant process in petrochemical industries for producing propylene, which plays a crucial role in the production of various olefin-based products. However, the process faces challenges such as coke formation and thermodynamic limitations, making alternative methods, like dehydrogenation oxidation (DHO), more favorable due to their ability to selectively oxidize hydrogen.

3. The dehydrogenation of propane leads to a series of side reactions, including deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, resulting in the formation of a range of fragments from C1 to C3 species adsorbed on the catalyst surface. These reactions are essential in understanding the complex behavior of propane during dehydrogenation.
