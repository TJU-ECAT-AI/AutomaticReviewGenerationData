a b s t r a c t DFTGGA calculations have been used to study the chemisorption of CHx (x = 03), C2Hy (y = 35) and C3Hz (z = 38) on Pt(1 1 1) at the coverage of 1/9 ML. The adsorption energies, favored binding sites and geometric parameters of adsorption configurations are determined. All the carbonaceous species are found to be adsorbed on Pt(1 1 1) with C atoms sp3-hybridized. The geometries of adsorption configura- tions have been compared with published experimental data to evaluate the reliability of our calculation method. The calculated adsorption energies of C1 species, ranked in descending order, are as follows, C > CH > CH2 > CH3, and the similar trend has been observed with respect to the chemisorption of C2 species. As for the C3 species, propylene prefers binding to the surface in the di- mode and the adsorp- tion energy is calculated to be 0.93 eV. The stepwise dehydrogenation of propane to propynyl (CCCH3) is investigated by calculating the change of reaction heat, which suggests that propylidyne (CCH2CH3) is the most stable species on Pt(1 1 1). Based on the adsorption energies and BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) analysis, propyne is predicted to be the most likely starting point for the CC scission. 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
1. Introduction
In the past three decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to improving a low energy consumption and inexpensive tech- nology to feed the ever-increasing demand for olefins. Propylene plays a key role in petrochemical industry, and it is profitable to produce it from propane [13]. Currently, commercial process for propylene synthesis through direct dehydrogenation of propane is available. However, this process suffers from several problems such as coke formation and thermodynamic limitations [4]. Compared to the direct dehydrogenation process, the so-called dehydrogena- tion oxidation (DHO) is preferred because of the introduction of selective oxidation of H2.
In 1897, Sabatier discovered that transition metals were good catalysts for the hydrogenation of hydrocarbons, and extensive research was conducted to investigate the mechanism of such reac- tions. Pt and Pt-based alloys have long been known as important catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Pt-based catalyst can be used in many industry processes, including the hydrogenation of olefins,the dehydrogenation and cracking of paraffins, e.g., the conver- sion of propane to propylene [59]. Recently, the chemisorption of hydrocarbons on Pt surface has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally [1013].

The dehydrogenation of propane involves a large number of side reactions including the deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of propane which lead to numerous fragments ranging from C1 to C3 species adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Many experimental stud- ies on hydrocarbon adsorption over transition metals have received a great deal of attention in recent years. At 150 K, the dissociative adsorption of methyl could be identified by reflectionabsorption infrared spectrometry (RAIRS) [14]. Moreover, Fuhrmann et al. [15] employed the temperature-programmed XPS and molecular beam techniques to investigate the dissociation of methane and found that methyl was adsorbed on Pt(1 1 1) at 120 K, which was dehydro- genated to CH at 260 K and further dehydrogenated to carbon above 500 K. As for heavier hydrocarbons, Kao and Madix [16] performed both experimental and theoretical studies to verify that propane was physisorbed on the metal surface, and the trapping probabil- ity of propane on Pd(1 1 1) was higher than that on Pt(1 1 1). On Pt(6 5 5) and Pt(1 1 0)-(1 × 2), the corrugation of the metal surface played a key role in attracting the propane molecule [17]. At 200 K,the formation of propylene via -hydride elimination was identi- fied by isotopic labeling TPD experiments [18]. Using RAIRS, Zaera and Chrysostomou proposed that propylene interacted with the Pt(1 1 1) single-crystal surface via two  metalcarbon covalent bonds, and the rehybridization of C C double bond of propylene took place at low coverages [1,19]. This propylene adsorption con- figuration has been confirmed by Tsai et al. [12]. Furthermore,in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions, the di- binding propy- lene could be easily dehydrogenated to propylidyne just below the 1381-1169/$  see front matter  2010 Elsevier B.V.

43 room temperature and then to vinylmethylidyne (CCHCH2) at 450 K [20].
The modern theoretical surface science provides us an oppor- tunity to investigate the chemisorption and surface reaction on the atomic scale, and helps us to understand the catalysis process intuitively. Much theoretical work has been conducted to explore the adsorption and reactions of hydrocarbons in the past decade,especially for the C1 and C2 species. Jacob and Goddard [11] per- formed DFT calculations to investigate the chemisorption of CHx (x = 13) species and found that the adsorption energies of methyl,methylene and methylidyne on the Pt surface were 2.16, 4.13 and 6.35 eV, respectively. Their calculated results were in good agreement with the recent theoretical results [21]. Similar stud- ies have been performed on many other surfaces, such as Ni(1 1 1) [22], Ni(1 0 0) [23], Ru(1 1 2 0) [24], Pd(1 1 1) [25] and Cu(1 1 1) [26],etc. The comparative DFT study on the chemisorption of methyl and ethyl on Pt(1 1 1) [27] suggested that both these two species favor to be adsorbed at the Atop site owing to the strong agostic interactions between CH bonds and surface Pt. Furthermore, Jacob and Goddard [11] pointed out that the favored adsorption sites of ethylidene (CHCH3) and ethylidyne (CCH3) were the Bridge and Fcc sites, respectively. In addition, Valcrcel et al. [2830] conducted a theoretical study on the adsorption of propylene on Pt(1 1 1). They proposed that propylene preferred to be adsorbed on the surface in the di- mode and the adsorption energy was calculated to be
0.90 eV.
In the present study, DFT calculations are employed to inves- tigate the dehydrogenation and CC cleavage based on the chemisorption of the intermediates on Pt(1 1 1). We focus on the chemisorption of C3 intermediates, and thus to predict the possible products of the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane from the thermodynamic point of view. The dehydrogenation of the methyl group which is far away from the Pt surface in the C3 species is not taken into account. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,the details of computational methods are described. In Section 3,the adsorption energies, favored adsorption sites, optimized config- urations of the hydrocarbon fragments (C1C3) and the changes of reaction heat on Pt(1 1 1) are determined. In Section 4, we conclude by discussing the chemisorption and stability of the hydrocarbons to predict the preferred intermediate in the dehydrogenation pro- cess and the starting point for the CC scission.
2. Computational details
Density functional theory calculations are carried out with the VASP package [3133] using a plane wave basis set. Calculations are performed using the generalized gradient approximation func- tional proposed by Perdew et al. [34]. The interactions between valence electrons and ion cores are represented by Blchls all- electron-like projector augmented wave method (PAW)[35], which regards the 6s 5d states as the valence configuration for Pt, 2s 2p states for C and 1s state for H. A plane wave energy cut off of 400 eV is used in our calculations to achieve the tight convergence. Bril- louin zone sampling is performed using a Monkhorst-Pack grid with respect to the symmetry of the system and the electronic occupan- cies are determined according to a MethfesselPaxton scheme [36] with an energy smearing of 0.2 eV.
A four-layer slab with a p(3 × 3) supercell is used to represent the Pt(1 1 1) surface, achieving the coverage of adsorbates of 1/9
ML. The equilibrium PtPt interatomic distance is calculated to be
2.82 Å. The successive slabs are separated by a vacuum region as
thick as 12 Å in order to avoid periodic interactions. The bottom layer of the slab is kept fixed to its crystal lattice position. The first Brillouin zone of the p(3 × 3) supercell is sampled sufficiently with a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh.
