The literature discusses the effect of tin content and reduction temperature on the catalytic behavior of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The study found that tin was in an oxidized state when the catalysts were reduced at 473 K, while a portion was in a metallic state after reduction at 773 K. The amount of surface platinum decreased with higher tin loading and reduction temperatures. High temperature reduction led to improved catalytic activity and selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, with the best selectivity achieved for the catalyst with the lowest Pt/Sn ratio. The literature also mentions the promoter effect of tin, attributed to oxidized tin species interacting with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond to weaken the C-O bond and favor its hydrogenation. The presence of metallic tin could form Pt-Sn alloy phases, which would dilute the number of active sites, affecting the reaction rates. The strong metal-support interaction effect, involving the formation of special sites at the interface between metal and support, was also studied. The literature highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between tin, platinum, and the support in improving the selectivity and activity of the catalysts.

文献讨论了锡含量和还原温度对TiO2负载的PtSn催化剂在蒸气相氢化丙烯醛行为的影响。研究发现，当催化剂在473 K下还原时，锡处于氧化状态，而773 K下还原后，部分锡处于金属状态。随着锡载量和还原温度的增加，表面铂的数量减少。高温还原导致催化活性和选择性提高，特别是在氢化羰基键以生成不饱和醇方面，最佳选择性由最低的Pt/Sn比催化剂获得。文献还提到锡的促进效应，归因于氧化锡物种与羰基键上的氧原子相互作用来削弱C-O键并促进其氢化。金属锡的存在可能导致形成Pt-Sn合金相，这将稀释活性位点，影响反应速率。强金属支持交互作用效果也被研究，涉及在金属和支撑界面形成的特殊位点。文献强调了理解锡、铂和支撑物之间的相互作用对于改善催化剂的选择性和活性的重要性。

This study investigates the catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with varying Pt:Sn atomic ratios under vapor phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde at different reduction temperatures (473 K and 773 K). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results reveal that tin exists in an oxidized state when the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, while a portion is in a metallic state after reduction at 773 K. In situ infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO confirms the presence of Pt-Sn alloy in the catalysts after high temperature reduction, although some platinum remains in a non-alloyed state. The research finds that the catalyst activity in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde increases following high temperature reduction, and the same trend is observed with improved selectivity toward hydrogenating the carbonyl bond to produce the unsaturated alcohol. The best selectivity is achieved with the catalyst featuring the lowest Pt/Sn ratio. Bimetallic catalysts are demonstrated to exhibit higher activity and selectivity toward crotyl alcohol compared to monometallic Pt/TiO2 catalysts, highlighting the critical role of tin in this system.

本文研究了在不同还原温度（473 K和773 K）下，不同Pt:Sn原子比的双金属PtSn/TiO2催化剂在选择性氢化丙酮醛的气相过程中的催化行为。X射线光电子能谱(XPS)结果显示，当催化剂在473 K下还原时，锡处于氧化态，而在773 K下还原后，部分锡处于金属状态。原位红外光谱吸附CO证实，在高温还原后，催化剂中存在Pt-Sn合金，尽管仍有部分铂未形成合金。研究表明，铂在蒸汽相氢化丙酮醛中的活性随高温还原而增加，并且同样观察到氢化羰基键生成不饱和醇的选择性增强，最优选择性由最低的Pt/Sn比率催化剂获得。双金属催化剂被证明具有高于单金属Pt/TiO2催化剂的活性和选择性，向丙酮醛生成不饱和醇，这凸显了锡在此系统中的关键作用。

[2] "In some cases two values are given arising from a deconvolution of the main peak into two contributions,with the corresponding contribution to the overall signal in brackets."
[3] "The surface Pt/Ti atomic ratios are also presented (which can be used as an estimation of the platinum dispersion on the titania support), as well as the surface Pt/Sn atomic ratios."
[4] "The Pt 4f spectra for the unreduced and reduced catalysts are compared in Fig. 1."
[5] "For all catalysts, the spectra can be deconvoluted into two peaks, the one at lower binding energy corresponding to Pt 4f7/2 level and the second one, at higher binding energies, to the Pt 4f5/2 level."
[6] "The binding energy of the Pt 4f7/2 level for Pt(IV) coordinated to six chlorine atoms (as in the platinum precursor used for the preparation of the catalysts) is reported to be about 75.3 eV (for K2PtCl6), but it increases to 74.8 eV for PtO2 and further to 74.2 eV for Pt(OH)4."
[7] "After reduction treatments (at 473 and 773 K), a single peak appears for the level, which is centered at 71.4 and 71.1 eV for the catalyst reduced at 473 and 773 K, respectively."

[9] "The Sn 3d5/2 spectra for the unreduced and reduced catalysts are plotted in Fig. 2."
[10] "After reduction at 773 K, a second band appeared at lower binding energy (around 485 eV), which is characteristic of metallic tin."

[14] "The catalyst with an atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 3:1 has the highest activity (500 mmol s1 g Pt1), followed by the 4:1, 2:1 and 1:2 (435, 105 and 20 mmol s1 g Pt1, respectively)."
[15] "The tendency is quite similar for the catalysts with Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 4:1, 3:1 and 2:1."
[16] "In this case, the addition of tin stabilize the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol, although there is no direct relationship between the selectivity and the amount of tin loading."
[17] "On the other hand, the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol for the catalyst with an atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 1:2 increases quickly in the first minutes on stream, reaching a maximum of 45%, and then decreases until reaching a value of 25% at the end of the reaction (time on stream = 300 min)."
[18] "The catalyst with the lowest selectivity (34%) has the highest activity and a low tin content (Pt:Sn = 3:1), whereas the sample with the highest selectivity (60%) has the lowest activity and the highest tin content (Pt:Sn = 1:2)."
[19] "The formation of Pt-Sn alloy phases to a greater extent in the catalysts with the highest amount of tin could explain the high selectivity obtained, this correlating with a decrease in the activity due to the dilution of the platinum surface atoms by the formation of Pt-Sn alloy."

The XPS spectra were conducted using a VG-Microtech Multilab 3000 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and a Mg Ka source. The spectra showed a deconvolution into two peaks for the Pt 4f level, with one peak at lower binding energy corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 level and another at higher binding energy for the Pt 4f5/2 level. The Pt 4f7/2 level for Pt(IV) coordinated to six chlorine atoms was reported to be around 75.3 eV. After reduction, a single peak appeared for the Pt 4f level centered at 71.4 and 71.1 eV for catalysts reduced at 473 and 773 K, respectively. The Sn 3d5/2 spectra indicated a shift towards lower binding energy with increasing reduction temperature. The Pt/Ti atomic ratio decreased as the amount of tin increased when the catalysts were reduced at 473 K. The band corresponding to linearly adsorbed CO did not shift to higher wavenumbers when the coverage was increased. The catalyst with the highest amount of tin had the highest activity, while the catalyst with the highest selectivity towards crotyl alcohol had the lowest activity. The high selectivity was explained by the formation of Pt-Sn alloy phases, which correlated with a decrease in activity due to the dilution of platinum surface atoms by the formation of Pt-Sn alloy. The decoration of metallic particles by partially reduced titania and the formation of Pt-Sn alloy were suggested as the main factors influencing the behavior of the catalysts.

使用VG-Microtech Multilab 3000光电子能谱仪，配备半球形电子分析器和Mg Ka源，进行了XPS谱图的测量。谱图显示了Pt 4f能级的分解为两个峰，较低的峰值对应于Pt 4f7/2能级，而较高的峰值对应于Pt 4f5/2能级。配合六氯化铂的四价态，该能级的值约为75.3 eV。在还原后，Pt 4f能级出现了一个单峰，分别位于473 K和773 K还原的催化剂的中心位置为71.4和71.1 eV。Sn 3d5/2谱图表明随着还原温度的升高，其结合能向更低的值移动。当催化剂在473 K下还原时，Pt/Ti原子比随着锡含量的增加而降低。当覆盖度增加时，吸附在CO上的线性CO带并未向更高波数移动。具有最高锡含量的催化剂具有最高的活性，而具有最高异丙醇选择性的催化剂具有最低的活性。高选择性归因于Pt-Sn合金相的形成，这与由于Pt-Sn合金的形成导致铂表面原子稀释并导致活性下降相关联。金属颗粒的修饰由部分还原的二氧化钛和Pt-Sn合金的形成被认为是影响催化剂行为的主要因素。

The literature provides insights into the synthesis and characterization of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, particularly focusing on their behavior in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation of TiO2 (P25, from Degussa) with aqueous solutions of H2PtCl6 and SnCl22H2O. The Pt:Sn atomic ratios varied, and the catalysts were subjected to reduction at different temperatures. XPS analysis revealed that tin was predominantly in an oxidized state at lower reduction temperatures, while at higher temperatures, some tin was in a metallic state. The amount of surface platinum decreased with higher reduction temperatures and increased tin loading. The presence of Pt-Sn alloy was confirmed through in situ IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO. The reduction temperature influenced the catalytic activity and selectivity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. At high temperatures, the activity increased significantly, and the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol improved, especially for catalysts with a high tin content. The conversion ranged from 2 to 10%, but there were no significant changes in the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol with conversion.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions typically involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the substrate molecule, (3) dehydrogenation, and (4) desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting often hinges on factors such as the nature of the substrate, the catalyst, and the reaction conditions. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the reaction pathways, the dynamic interactions between the catalyst and the substrate, and the potential for multiple competing mechanisms. The interplay between kinetic and thermodynamic factors, as well as the role of catalyst structure and surface chemistry, continues to be explored in the field of catalysis research.

文献提供了关于PtSn/TiO2催化剂的合成与表征的见解，特别是它们在丙酮醛气相氢化反应中的行为。通过将水合溶液中的H2PtCl6和SnCl22H2O与Degussa公司的商业TiO2（P25）共浸渍制备了这些催化剂。Pt:Sn原子比不同，并且催化剂在不同温度下进行了还原。XPS分析表明，在较低还原温度下，锡主要以氧化态存在，而在较高温度下，部分锡处于金属状态。随着还原温度的升高和锡负载量增加，表面铂的数量减少。通过原位红外光谱吸附CO确认了铂-锡合金的存在，尽管仍有部分铂保持非合金状态。不同的还原温度影响了催化剂的活性和选择性。在高温下，活性显著提高，尤其是对于高锡含量的催化剂，选择性向丙二醇的提高。转化率范围从2到10%，但转化率对丙二醇的选择性没有明显变化。

霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制通常涉及催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤：（1）底物分子吸附至催化剂表面，（2）底物分子活化，（3）脱氢，（4）产物分子从催化剂表面脱附。关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的持续争议往往取决于底物的性质、催化剂和反应条件等因素。这一机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，尽管已经研究了一个世纪以上，因为反应途径的复杂性、催化剂与底物之间的动态相互作用以及可能存在的多个竞争机制。催化剂结构和表面化学之间的交互作用继续被催化研究领域探索。

该机制之所以成为研究热点，原因在于动力学和热力学因素的复杂交织，催化剂结构和表面化学的作用方式，以及可能存在的多个竞争机制。这一机制的持续争议反映了催化领域的复杂性和挑战。
