[1] "The presence of metallic tin in the catalysts reduced at 773 K opens up the possibility for the existence of Pt-Sn alloy phases after this treatment, although this cannot be readily assessed by XPS."
[2] "There is no displacement of the main IR bands to higher wavenumbers in the CO spectra of catalysts reduced at 473 K."
[3] "The effect of reduction at high temperature is a dramatic increase in catalytic activity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, and, in most cases, an increase in the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol."
[4] "The combined effects of the decoration of metallic particles by partially reduced titania and PtSn alloy formation are suggested as being the main factors of this behaviour."

1. When the catalysts are reduced at 773 K, the possibility exists for the formation of Pt-Sn alloy phases, though this is not easily assessed by XPS. 
2. The main IR bands in CO spectra do not shift to higher wavenumbers when the catalysts are reduced at 473 K.
3. Reduction at high temperature significantly enhances the catalytic activity for hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and often improves the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol.
4. The decoration of metal particles by partially reduced titania and the formation of Pt-Sn alloy are considered key factors influencing the behavior of the catalysts.

1. 当催化剂在773 K下进行还原时，存在形成Pt-Sn合金相的可能性，但这不易通过XPS评估。
2. 当催化剂在473 K下还原时，主要的CO谱中不会出现波数更高的红外光谱带。
3. 高温还原显著提高了丙酮醛氢化反应的催化活性，并且通常提高了对丙烯醇的选择性。
4. 金属颗粒表面部分还原的二氧化钛的装饰和形成Pt-Sn合金被认为是影响催化剂行为的关键因素。
