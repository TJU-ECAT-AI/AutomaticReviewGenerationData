[1] "In this work, the catalytic behaviour of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with different Pt:Sn atomic ratio is compared, after reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperature, for the vapour phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
[2] "XPS results show that tin is in oxidized state when the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, whereas a proportion is in the metallic state after reduction at 773 K."
[3] "The presence of Pt-Sn alloy in the catalysts after reduction at high temperature has been assessed by in situ IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, although a proportion of platinum remains in a non-alloyed state."
[4] "The catalytic activity in the vapour-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde increases after high temperature reduction, and the same behaviour is obtained with selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond to yield the unsaturated alcohol, the best selectivity being obtained for the catalyst with the lowest Pt/Sn ratio."
[5] "Taking into account previous studies with a Pt/TiO2 monometallic catalyst [15], bimetallic catalysts have a higher activity and selectivity towards crotyl alcohol, this proving the important role of the tin is this system."

This study investigates the catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with varying Pt:Sn atomic ratios under vapor phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde at different reduction temperatures (473 K and 773 K). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results reveal that tin exists in an oxidized state when the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, while a portion is in a metallic state after reduction at 773 K. In situ infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO confirms the presence of Pt-Sn alloy in the catalysts after high temperature reduction, although some platinum remains in a non-alloyed state. The research finds that the catalyst activity in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde increases following high temperature reduction, and the same trend is observed with improved selectivity toward hydrogenating the carbonyl bond to produce the unsaturated alcohol. The best selectivity is achieved with the catalyst featuring the lowest Pt/Sn ratio. Bimetallic catalysts are demonstrated to exhibit higher activity and selectivity toward crotyl alcohol compared to monometallic Pt/TiO2 catalysts, highlighting the critical role of tin in this system.

本文研究了在不同还原温度（473 K和773 K）下，不同Pt:Sn原子比的双金属PtSn/TiO2催化剂在选择性氢化丙酮醛的气相过程中的催化行为。X射线光电子能谱(XPS)结果显示，当催化剂在473 K下还原时，锡处于氧化态，而在773 K下还原后，部分锡处于金属状态。原位红外光谱吸附CO证实，在高温还原后，催化剂中存在Pt-Sn合金，尽管仍有部分铂未形成合金。研究表明，铂在蒸汽相氢化丙酮醛中的活性随高温还原而增加，并且同样观察到氢化羰基键生成不饱和醇的选择性增强，最优选择性由最低的Pt/Sn比率催化剂获得。双金属催化剂被证明具有高于单金属Pt/TiO2催化剂的活性和选择性，向丙酮醛生成不饱和醇，这凸显了锡在此系统中的关键作用。
