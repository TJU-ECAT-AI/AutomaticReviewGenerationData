[1] "The XPS spectra were acquired with a VG-Microtech Multilab 3000 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and a Mg Ka"
[2] "In some cases two values are given arising from a deconvolution of the main peak into two contributions,with the corresponding contribution to the overall signal in brackets."
[3] "The surface Pt/Ti atomic ratios are also presented (which can be used as an estimation of the platinum dispersion on the titania support), as well as the surface Pt/Sn atomic ratios."
[4] "The Pt 4f spectra for the unreduced and reduced catalysts are compared in Fig. 1."
[5] "For all catalysts, the spectra can be deconvoluted into two peaks, the one at lower binding energy corresponding to Pt 4f7/2 level and the second one, at higher binding energies, to the Pt 4f5/2 level."
[6] "The binding energy of the Pt 4f7/2 level for Pt(IV) coordinated to six chlorine atoms (as in the platinum precursor used for the preparation of the catalysts) is reported to be about 75.3 eV (for K2PtCl6), but it increases to 74.8 eV for PtO2 and further to 74.2 eV for Pt(OH)4."
[7] "After reduction treatments (at 473 and 773 K), a single peak appears for the level, which is centered at 71.4 and 71.1 eV for the catalyst reduced at 473 and 773 K, respectively."
[8] "For the unreduced catalyst, the peak corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 level is centered at 72.5 eV, and it is assigned to oxidized platinum species."
[9] "The Sn 3d5/2 spectra for the unreduced and reduced catalysts are plotted in Fig. 2."
[10] "After reduction at 773 K, a second band appeared at lower binding energy (around 485 eV), which is characteristic of metallic tin."
[11] "When the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, the Pt/Ti atomic ratio decreases as the amount of tin increases."
[12] "In the region of bridging carbonyls, there is only one small band (at 1850 cm1) at high coverage in the catalyst with Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 4:1."
[13] "On the other hand, the band of CO linearly adsorbed does not shift to higher wavenumbers when the coverage is increased."
[14] "The catalyst with an atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 3:1 has the highest activity (500 mmol s1 g Pt1), followed by the 4:1, 2:1 and 1:2 (435, 105 and 20 mmol s1 g Pt1, respectively)."
[15] "The tendency is quite similar for the catalysts with Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 4:1, 3:1 and 2:1."
[16] "In this case, the addition of tin stabilize the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol, although there is no direct relationship between the selectivity and the amount of tin loading."
[17] "On the other hand, the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol for the catalyst with an atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 1:2 increases quickly in the first minutes on stream, reaching a maximum of 45%, and then decreases until reaching a value of 25% at the end of the reaction (time on stream = 300 min)."
[18] "The catalyst with the lowest selectivity (34%) has the highest activity and a low tin content (Pt:Sn = 3:1), whereas the sample with the highest selectivity (60%) has the lowest activity and the highest tin content (Pt:Sn = 1:2)."
[19] "The formation of Pt-Sn alloy phases to a greater extent in the catalysts with the highest amount of tin could explain the high selectivity obtained, this correlating with a decrease in the activity due to the dilution of the platinum surface atoms by the formation of Pt-Sn alloy."
[20] "The combined effects of the decoration of metallic particles by partially reduced titania and PtSn alloy formation are suggested as being the main factors of this behaviour."

The XPS spectra were conducted using a VG-Microtech Multilab 3000 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and a Mg Ka source. The spectra showed a deconvolution into two peaks for the Pt 4f level, with one peak at lower binding energy corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 level and another at higher binding energy for the Pt 4f5/2 level. The Pt 4f7/2 level for Pt(IV) coordinated to six chlorine atoms was reported to be around 75.3 eV. After reduction, a single peak appeared for the Pt 4f level centered at 71.4 and 71.1 eV for catalysts reduced at 473 and 773 K, respectively. The Sn 3d5/2 spectra indicated a shift towards lower binding energy with increasing reduction temperature. The Pt/Ti atomic ratio decreased as the amount of tin increased when the catalysts were reduced at 473 K. The band corresponding to linearly adsorbed CO did not shift to higher wavenumbers when the coverage was increased. The catalyst with the highest amount of tin had the highest activity, while the catalyst with the highest selectivity towards crotyl alcohol had the lowest activity. The high selectivity was explained by the formation of Pt-Sn alloy phases, which correlated with a decrease in activity due to the dilution of platinum surface atoms by the formation of Pt-Sn alloy. The decoration of metallic particles by partially reduced titania and the formation of Pt-Sn alloy were suggested as the main factors influencing the behavior of the catalysts.

使用VG-Microtech Multilab 3000光电子能谱仪，配备半球形电子分析器和Mg Ka源，进行了XPS谱图的测量。谱图显示了Pt 4f能级的分解为两个峰，较低的峰值对应于Pt 4f7/2能级，而较高的峰值对应于Pt 4f5/2能级。配合六氯化铂的四价态，该能级的值约为75.3 eV。在还原后，Pt 4f能级出现了一个单峰，分别位于473 K和773 K还原的催化剂的中心位置为71.4和71.1 eV。Sn 3d5/2谱图表明随着还原温度的升高，其结合能向更低的值移动。当催化剂在473 K下还原时，Pt/Ti原子比随着锡含量的增加而降低。当覆盖度增加时，吸附在CO上的线性CO带并未向更高波数移动。具有最高锡含量的催化剂具有最高的活性，而具有最高异丙醇选择性的催化剂具有最低的活性。高选择性归因于Pt-Sn合金相的形成，这与由于Pt-Sn合金的形成导致铂表面原子稀释并导致活性下降相关联。金属颗粒的修饰由部分还原的二氧化钛和Pt-Sn合金的形成被认为是影响催化剂行为的主要因素。
