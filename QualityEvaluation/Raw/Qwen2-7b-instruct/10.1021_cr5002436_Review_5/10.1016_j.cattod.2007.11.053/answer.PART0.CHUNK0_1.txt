[1] "In the field of fine chemicals, the preparation of unsaturated alcohols by the selective hydrogenation of the corresponding a,b-unsaturated aldehydes has a great industrial importance in the synthesis of many products."
[2] "However, metallic tin has been also detected by XPS in these systems."
[3] "This loss in adsorption capacity can be associated with the migration of partially reduced titania species to the surface of the metallic particles (SMSI effect)."
[4] "It can be concluded that the addition of tin stabilize the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol, although there is no direct relationship between the selectivity and the amount of tin loading."
[5] "The combined effects of the decoration of metallic particles by partially reduced titania and PtSn alloy formation are suggested as being the main factors of this behavior."

The literature discusses the effect of tin content and reduction temperature on the catalytic behavior of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The study found that tin was in an oxidized state when the catalysts were reduced at 473 K, while a portion was in a metallic state after reduction at 773 K. The amount of surface platinum decreased with higher tin loading and reduction temperatures. High temperature reduction led to improved catalytic activity and selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, with the best selectivity achieved for the catalyst with the lowest Pt/Sn ratio. The literature also mentions the promoter effect of tin, attributed to oxidized tin species interacting with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond to weaken the C-O bond and favor its hydrogenation. The presence of metallic tin could form Pt-Sn alloy phases, which would dilute the number of active sites, affecting the reaction rates. The strong metal-support interaction effect, involving the formation of special sites at the interface between metal and support, was also studied. The literature highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between tin, platinum, and the support in improving the selectivity and activity of the catalysts.

文献讨论了锡含量和还原温度对TiO2负载的PtSn催化剂在蒸气相氢化丙烯醛行为的影响。研究发现，当催化剂在473 K下还原时，锡处于氧化状态，而773 K下还原后，部分锡处于金属状态。随着锡载量和还原温度的增加，表面铂的数量减少。高温还原导致催化活性和选择性提高，特别是在氢化羰基键以生成不饱和醇方面，最佳选择性由最低的Pt/Sn比催化剂获得。文献还提到锡的促进效应，归因于氧化锡物种与羰基键上的氧原子相互作用来削弱C-O键并促进其氢化。金属锡的存在可能导致形成Pt-Sn合金相，这将稀释活性位点，影响反应速率。强金属支持交互作用效果也被研究，涉及在金属和支撑界面形成的特殊位点。文献强调了理解锡、铂和支撑物之间的相互作用对于改善催化剂的选择性和活性的重要性。
