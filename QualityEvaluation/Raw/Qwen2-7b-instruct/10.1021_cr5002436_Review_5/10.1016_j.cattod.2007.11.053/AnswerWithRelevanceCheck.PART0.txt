          [1] "The presence of metallic tin in the catalysts reduced at 773 K opens up the possibility for the existence of Pt-Sn alloy phases after this treatment, although this cannot be readily assessed by XPS."
          [2] "There is no displacement of the main IR bands to higher wavenumbers in the CO spectra of catalysts reduced at 473 K."
          [3] "The effect of reduction at high temperature is a dramatic increase in catalytic activity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, and, in most cases, an increase in the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol."
          [4] "The combined effects of the decoration of metallic particles by partially reduced titania and PtSn alloy formation are suggested as being the main factors of this behaviour."

          1. When the catalysts are reduced at 773 K, the possibility exists for the formation of Pt-Sn alloy phases, though this is not easily evaluated by XPS.
          2. There is no shifting of the primary IR bands to higher wavenumbers in the CO spectra of catalysts reduced at 473 K.
          3. High temperature reduction leads to a significant increase in catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, and often an improvement in selectivity towards crotyl alcohol.
          4. The collective impacts of the decoration of metal particles by partially reduced titania and the formation of Pt-Sn alloys are proposed as the primary causes of this behavior.

          2. 当催化剂在473 K下还原时，CO谱中的主要IR光谱带不会向更高的波数偏移。
          3. 高温还原导致丙酮醛氢化反应的催化活性显著增加，并且大多数情况下提高了对丙烯醇的选择性。
          4. 金属颗粒表面部分还原的二氧化钛的装饰和形成Pt-Sn合金被认为是引起这种行为的主要因素。

          [1] "The literature discusses the effect of tin content and reduction temperature on the catalytic behavior of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
          [2] "XPS results show that tin is in oxidized state when the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, whereas a proportion is in the metallic state after reduction at 773 K."
          [3] "The presence of Pt-Sn alloy in the catalysts after reduction at high temperature has been assessed by in situ IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, although a proportion of platinum remains in a non-alloyed state."
          [4] "The combined effects of the decoration of metallic particles by partially reduced titania and PtSn alloy formation are suggested as being the main factors of this behavior."
          [5] "It can be concluded that the addition of tin stabilize the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol, although there is no direct relationship between the selectivity and the amount of tin loading."

          1. The literature examines how tin content and reduction temperature affect the catalytic properties of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde.
          2. XPS data indicates that tin is in an oxidized state during catalyst reduction at 473 K, whereas a part becomes metallic after 773 K reduction.
          3. The presence of Pt-Sn alloys in high-temperature-reduced catalysts has been confirmed via in situ IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, with some platinum remaining unalloyed.
          4. The collective effects of metal particle decoration by partially reduced titania and Pt-Sn alloy creation are deemed key factors in this behavior.
          5. It is deduced that adding tin stabilizes the selectivity for crotyl alcohol, yet there's no direct link between selectivity and tin loading quantity.

          1. 文献探讨了锡含量和还原温度对PtSn/TiO2催化剂在丙酮醛气相氢化反应中的催化性能的影响。
          2. XPS结果显示，当催化剂在473 K下还原时，锡处于氧化态；而在773 K下还原后，部分锡变为金属态。
          3. 高温还原后的催化剂中存在Pt-Sn合金，通过吸附CO的原位红外光谱分析验证了这一点，但仍有一部分铂未形成合金。
          4. 金属颗粒表面部分还原的二氧化钛的装饰和Pt-Sn合金的形成被认为是引起这种行为的主要因素。
          5. 可以得出结论，添加锡稳定了对丙烯醇的选择性，然而选择性与锡加载量之间并无直接联系。
