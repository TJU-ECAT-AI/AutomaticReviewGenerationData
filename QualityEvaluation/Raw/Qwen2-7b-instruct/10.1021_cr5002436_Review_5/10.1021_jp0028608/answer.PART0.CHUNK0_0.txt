<p>The thermal chemistry of allyl iodide and of allyl bromide adsorbed on Pt(111) was investigated by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflectionabsorption infrared (RAIRS) spectroscopies.</p>
<p>On the clean Pt(111) surface, both allyls were found to bond to the surface via the halogen atom in a gauche conformation and with the CCC plane close to parallel to the surface.</p>
<p>In the presence of surface hydrogen, allyl iodide was found to tilt backward such that the CCC plane adopts a more vertical orientation on the surface; in this more upright geometry, both cis and gauche isomers were identified.</p>
<p>A η 1 allylic moiety was identified by RAIRS in the high-exposure regime of allyl iodide after annealing to 200 K, and the formation of a second η3 allylic intermediate was inferred from TPD experiments with coadsorbed hydrogen and deuterium.</p>
<p>At low surface concentrations, allyl moieties mainly dehydrogenate, ultimately to H2(g) and Cads. At coverages approaching monolayer, on the other hand, some of the allyls hydrogenate to propene around 310 K via a process which relies on the decomposition of a few of the same surface allyl moieties as the source of hydrogen.</p>
<p>Hydrogenation to propene can be enhanced and induced at much lower temperatures by predosing hydrogen on the surface. This propene is seen to desorb in two temperature desorption peaks. The first, at 185 K, is likely to come from direct hydrogenation of the η1 allyl intermediate, and does not involve any appreciable HD exchange.</p>

The thermal chemistry of allyl iodide and allyl bromide adsorbed on Pt(111) was studied using TPD and RAIRS spectroscopies. The allyls bonded to the surface via the halogen atom in a gauche conformation, with the CCC plane close to parallel to the surface. Surface hydrogen caused allyl iodide to tilt backward, adopting a more vertical CCC plane. Both cis and gauche isomers were identified. A η1 allylic moiety was detected at 200 K after annealing, and a η3 allylic intermediate was inferred from TPD experiments with hydrogen and deuterium. At low concentrations, allyl moieties dehydrogenated to H2(g) and Cads. At coverages near monolayer, allyls hydrogenated to propene at 310 K, relying on the decomposition of surface allyl moieties as hydrogen sources. Hydrogenation could be enhanced by predosing hydrogen on the surface, resulting in propene desorption at two temperatures: 185 K from the η1 allyl intermediate without HD exchange, and 250 K involving extensive HD exchange. The overall chemistry on Pt(111) is illustrated in Figure 10.

对吸附在Pt(111)表面的碘代乙基和溴代乙基的热化学进行了研究，使用了温度程序脱附（TPD）和反射吸收红外（RAIRS）光谱技术。乙基通过卤素原子以扭褶构型与表面结合，且CC平面接近平行于表面。表面氢导致碘代乙基向后倾斜，使其CC平面垂直于表面，识别出两种构型：顺式和反式。检测到一个η1亚甲基基团在200 K的高温下，以及从氢和重氢共沉积的TPD实验中推断出一个η3亚甲基中间体。在低浓度下，乙基主要进行脱氢反应，最终产生H2(g)和Cads。在接近单层的覆盖度时，在310 K左右，一些乙基通过分解相同的表面乙基作为氢源进行氢化生成丙烯。通过在表面预沉积氢可以提高氢化速率并诱导在较低温度下发生氢化反应。生成的丙烯在两个温度下脱附：185 K来自于η1亚甲基中间体，不涉及HD交换；250 K涉及到大量的HD交换，通过丙烯-丙基-丙烯表面互转化机制。在Pt(111)上的整体化学反应模式见图10。
