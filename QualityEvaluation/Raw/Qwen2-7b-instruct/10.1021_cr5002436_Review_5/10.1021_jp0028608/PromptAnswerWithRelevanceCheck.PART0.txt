<p>The thermal chemistry of allyl iodide and of allyl bromide adsorbed on Pt(111) was investigated by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflectionabsorption infrared (RAIRS) spectroscopies.</p>
<p>On the clean Pt(111) surface, both allyls were found to bond to the surface via the halogen atom in a gauche conformation and with the CCC plane close to parallel to the surface.</p>
<p>In the presence of surface hydrogen, allyl iodide was found to tilt backward such that the CCC plane adopts a more vertical orientation on the surface; in this more upright geometry, both cis and gauche isomers were identified.</p>
<p>A η 1 allylic moiety was identified by RAIRS in the high-exposure regime of allyl iodide after annealing to 200 K, and the formation of a second η3 allylic intermediate was inferred from TPD experiments with coadsorbed hydrogen and deuterium.</p>
<p>At low surface concentrations, allyl moieties mainly dehydrogenate, ultimately to H2(g) and Cads. At coverages approaching monolayer, on the other hand, some of the allyls hydrogenate to propene around 310 K via a process which relies on the decomposition of a few of the same surface allyl moieties as the source of hydrogen.</p>
<p>Hydrogenation to propene can be enhanced and induced at much lower temperatures by predosing hydrogen on the surface. This propene is seen to desorb in two temperature desorption peaks. The first, at 185 K, is likely to come from direct hydrogenation of the η1 allyl intermediate, and does not involve any appreciable HD exchange.</p>
<p>The overall chemistry proposed here for allyl halides on Pt(111) is depicted schematically in Figure 10.</p>

The thermal chemistry of allyl iodide and allyl bromide adsorbed on Pt(111) was studied using TPD and RAIRS spectroscopies. The allyls bonded to the surface via the halogen atom in a gauche conformation, with the CCC plane close to parallel to the surface. Surface hydrogen caused allyl iodide to tilt backward, adopting a more vertical CCC plane. Both cis and gauche isomers were identified. A η1 allylic moiety was detected at 200 K after annealing, and a η3 allylic intermediate was inferred from TPD experiments with hydrogen and deuterium. At low concentrations, allyl moieties dehydrogenated to H2(g) and Cads. At coverages near monolayer, allyls hydrogenated to propene at 310 K, relying on the decomposition of surface allyl moieties as hydrogen sources. Hydrogenation could be enhanced by predosing hydrogen on the surface, resulting in propene desorption at two temperatures: 185 K from the η1 allyl intermediate without HD exchange, and 250 K involving extensive HD exchange. The overall chemistry on Pt(111) is illustrated in Figure 10.

对吸附在Pt(111)表面的碘代乙基和溴代乙基的热化学进行了研究，使用了温度程序脱附（TPD）和反射吸收红外（RAIRS）光谱技术。乙基通过卤素原子以扭褶构型与表面结合，且CC平面接近平行于表面。表面氢导致碘代乙基向后倾斜，使其CC平面垂直于表面，识别出两种构型：顺式和反式。检测到一个η1亚甲基基团在200 K的高温下，以及从氢和重氢共沉积的TPD实验中推断出一个η3亚甲基中间体。在低浓度下，乙基主要进行脱氢反应，最终产生H2(g)和Cads。在接近单层的覆盖度时，在310 K左右，一些乙基通过分解相同的表面乙基作为氢源进行氢化生成丙烯。通过在表面预沉积氢可以提高氢化速率并诱导在较低温度下发生氢化反应。生成的丙烯在两个温度下脱附：185 K来自于η1亚甲基中间体，不涉及HD交换；250 K涉及到大量的HD交换，通过丙烯-丙基-丙烯表面互转化机制。在Pt(111)上的整体化学反应模式见图10。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps:

1. Activation of the hydrogen molecule (H2) to form an active hydrogen species (H*).
2. Reaction of the active hydrogen species with the substrate to form an intermediate.
3. Rearrangement of the intermediate to a product and a reformed active hydrogen species.
4. Recycling of the active hydrogen species back to the surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study. The rate-limiting step is often debated between the activation of hydrogen and the subsequent reaction of the active hydrogen species with the substrate. Factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the type of substrate, and the conditions of the reaction can influence which step is rate-limiting.

Despite the extensive research, the precise mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions and the exact role of each step in the overall reaction kinetics remain subjects of scientific inquiry and debate. The complexity of these reactions and the interplay between different steps contribute to the persistence of this topic as a subject of interest in chemical research.

霍里图-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：

1. 活化氢分子（H2）形成活性氢物种（H*）。
2. 活性氢物种与底物反应形成中间体。
3. 中间体重组为产物和重新形成的活性氢物种。
4. 回收活性氢物种回到表面。

尽管进行了大量的研究，但脱氢反应的确切机制以及每个步骤在总体反应动力学中的确切作用仍是一些科学探索的主题。这些反应的复杂性和不同步骤之间的相互作用导致了这一主题作为化学研究领域持续的兴趣。

<p>Allyl iodide Thermal Chemistry on Pt(111)</p>
<p>The dissociation of allyl iodide on Pt(111) at low temperatures produces a surface allyl moiety capable of self-hydrogenation to propene.</p>
<p>After high exposures to allyl iodide, the 41 amu TPD also displays a peak at 160 K.</p>
<p>Because of the insignificant contribution of propene fragments to the 29 amu signal, propane desorption was primarily monitored with that mass, together with simultaneous monitoring of the 43 and 44 amu TPD traces.</p>
<p>Notice that while the propene desorption profiles are similar in both systems, the associated desorption temperatures do not show similar behavior.</p>
<p>When the Pt(111) surface is treated with hydrogen before dosing with allyl iodide, propane desorption begins at lower temperatures, at least 40 K lower than in its absence, and the yield of that alkane increases substantially.</p>
<p>The overall propene and propane yields are lower in this experiment, most likely because of the displacement of some of the iodide by the incoming hydrogen.</p>
<p>Propene yields at 310 K are approximately constant up to adsorption temperatures of 260 K.</p>
<p>The yields of both 305 and 430 K hydrogen desorption processes increase almost linearly with allyl iodide doses up to 2.5 L.</p>
<p>When hydrogen is made available on the surface (by predosing H2), the allyl hydrogenation process at 310 K is substantially suppressed in favor of a low-temperature hydrogenation step around 185 K.</p>
<p>It is suggested here that, in the absence of Hads, the allyl moieties form on the surface below 160 K but do not dissociate until about 270 K.</p>

1. Allyl iodide dissociation on Pt(111) at low temperatures creates a surface allyl moiety that can self-hydrogenate to propene.
2. High exposure to allyl iodide leads to a peak at 160 K in the 41 amu TPD data.
3. Propane desorption was mainly monitored through the 29 amu signal, alongside the 43 and 44 amu TPD traces.
4. Propene desorption profiles in both systems share similarities, yet their associated desorption temperatures differ.
5. Pre-dosing the surface with hydrogen reduces the temperature of propane desorption by at least 40 K and significantly increases its yield.
6. The experiment with pre-dosed hydrogen shows lower overall propene and propane yields due to iodide displacement.
7. Propene yields at 310 K remain constant until adsorption temperatures reach 260 K.
8. The 305 and 430 K hydrogen desorption processes' yields increase linearly with allyl iodide doses up to 2.5 L.
9. The allyl hydrogenation process at 310 K is suppressed when hydrogen is made available on the surface, favoring a low-temperature hydrogenation step around 185 K.
10. In the absence of hydrogen, allyl moieties form on the surface below 160 K but do not dissociate until around 270 K.

1. 在Pt(111)表面上，低温度下碘代丙烯的解离产生表面丙烯基，能够自我氢化生成丙烯。
2. 高剂量碘代丙烯导致160 K处的41 amu TPD数据中的峰值。
3. 碳链烷烃的脱氢主要通过29 amu信号监测，同时伴随43和44 amu TPD轨迹的同步监控。
4. 两个系统中，丙烯脱氢的模式相似，但其相关脱氢温度不一致。
5. 在表面预涂氢后，丙烷脱氢开始在比无氢时低至少40 K的温度下进行，并且其产量显著增加。
6. 含有预涂氢的实验显示，丙烯和丙烷的总体产量较低，这是由于碘离子被进来的氢置换。
7. 310 K处的丙烯产量在吸附温度达到260 K时保持不变。
8. 305和430 K氢气脱除过程的产量在碘代丙烯剂量达到2.5 L时线性增加。
9. 当表面提供氢时，310 K处的丙烯氢化过程被低至185 K的氢化步骤取代。

<p>It is interesting to speculate on the adsorption geometry of the allyl species that hydrogenate to propene. Both the 310 K propene TPD peak from allyl iodide adsorbed alone on clean Pt(111) and the 185 K feature that develops upon hydrogen or deuterium coadsorption incorporate only one H (D) surface atom, and are therefore likely to be bonded in a η1 configuration.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some allyl moieties do decompose on the surface (hence the availability of hydrogen at 300 K for propene desorption), and that requires more extensive coordination to the metal. Moreover, some of the propene produced below 200 K remains on the surface, and later decomposes to propylidyne or hydrogenates to propane. This argues for another allyl configuration, perhaps a η3 intermediate.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely discussed model that describes the process as a series of four main steps. These steps are:

1. **Adsorption**: The reactant molecules, such as alkanes, are adsorbed onto the surface of a catalyst, typically a metal surface. 

2. **Activation**: The adsorbed molecules are activated through the breaking of one or more chemical bonds, often through the use of heat or other energy inputs. This step is considered crucial as it prepares the molecules for the subsequent dehydrogenation.

3. **Dehydrogenation**: The activated molecules undergo a dehydrogenation reaction, typically resulting in the formation of alkynes, alkenes, or aromatic compounds. This is the central step in the mechanism.

4. **Desorption**: The newly formed products are then desorbed from the surface of the catalyst, ready for collection or further processing.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting varies based on the specific conditions, catalyst type, and reactants used. Each step can potentially act as the rate-limiting step under different circumstances, influencing the overall efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation reaction.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for several reasons:

- **Complexity of Surface Processes**: Surface chemistry is inherently complex, involving multiple interactions between reactants, catalysts, and products. This complexity can lead to variations in reaction pathways and kinetics that challenge the simplicity of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

- **Role of Surface Structure and Composition**: The structure and composition of the catalyst surface play a significant role in determining the efficiency of the dehydrogenation reaction. Different catalyst materials and surface modifications can alter the mechanism and kinetics, affecting the rate-limiting step.

- **Environmental Factors**: Temperature, pressure, and the presence of other gases can significantly impact the dehydrogenation process. Understanding how these factors affect the mechanism is crucial for optimizing industrial processes and developing more efficient catalysts.

- **Theoretical vs. Experimental Discrepancies**: Theoretical models of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism sometimes diverge from experimental observations. This discrepancy can arise from oversimplified assumptions or limitations in modeling complex surface phenomena.

- **Evolution of Catalyst Science**: Advances in materials science and nanotechnology have led to the development of novel catalysts with unique properties. These advancements require revisiting and refining the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism to account for the new insights and applications.

In conclusion, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a foundational concept in catalytic dehydrogenation studies, yet its complexities and evolving nature continue to drive research and innovation in the field.

<p>A η 1 allylic moiety was identified by RAIRS in the high-exposure regime of allyl iodide after annealing to 200 K, and the formation of a second η3 allylic intermediate was inferred from TPD experiments with coadsorbed hydrogen and deuterium.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, consisting of four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface. 
2. Activation, where the substrate undergoes a chemical change, often involving bond breaking.
3. Reaction, where the activated species reacts with another molecule to form a product.
4. Desorption of the product from the surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often depends on the specific substrate, catalyst, and conditions. While the mechanism has been widely accepted, there are still nuances and exceptions that researchers continue to explore.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its wide applicability across various industrial processes, including the production of chemicals, fuels, and materials. Despite nearly a century of study, new insights and applications are continuously being discovered, challenging the traditional understanding and leading to advancements in catalysis and reaction engineering.
