<p>Allyl iodide was found to tilt backward such that the CCC plane adopts a more vertical orientation on the surface; in this more upright geometry, both cis and gauche isomers were identified.</p>
<p>With both molecules the facile thermally activated cleavage of the carbonhalogen bond results in the formation of C3 allylic species on the surface.</p>
<p>A η 1 allylic moiety was identified by RAIRS in the high-exposure regime of allyl iodide after annealing to 200 K, and the formation of a second η3 allylic intermediate was inferred from TPD experiments with coadsorbed hydrogen and deuterium.</p>
<p>The hydrogenation reactions seen when allyl iodide is adsorbed on clean Pt(111) will be discussed first. In that case, the onset of the propene desorption process is centered at 310 K, occurs only for exposures in excess of 2.5 L (Figure 1), and is accompanied by a decrease in yield in the 305340 K hydrogen desorption (Figure 3).</p>
<p>When hydrogen is made available on the surface (by predosing H2), the allyl hydrogenation process at 310 K is substantially suppressed in favor of a low-temperature hydrogenation step around 185 K (Figure 2).</p>
<p>It is suggested here that, in the absence of Hads, the allyl moieties form on the surface below 160 K but do not dissociate until about 270 K.</p>
<p>The reaction mechanism for the low-temperature hydrogenation reactions of the surface allyl moiety proposed here is shown schematically in Figure 10.</p>
<p>Finally, additional information on the hydrogenation of allyl moieties at 310 K with surface hydrogen was obtained by TPD experiments with coadsorbed deuterium. In these experiments, the desorption of all the isotopomers of propene were followed, but desorption intensity was only detected for masses up to 43 amu, that is, for monodeuterated propene (C3H5D), the same as in the 185 K peak (Figure 5).</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, consisting of four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface. 
2. Activation, where the substrate undergoes a chemical change, often involving bond breaking.
3. Reaction, where the activated species reacts with another molecule to form a product.
4. Desorption of the product from the surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often depends on the specific substrate, catalyst, and conditions. While the mechanism has been widely accepted, there are still nuances and exceptions that researchers continue to explore.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its wide applicability across various industrial processes, including the production of chemicals, fuels, and materials. Despite nearly a century of study, new insights and applications are continuously being discovered, challenging the traditional understanding and leading to advancements in catalysis and reaction engineering.

霍里图-波拉尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应，包括四个主要步骤：
1. 基质在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 激活，基质经历化学变化，通常涉及键断裂。
3. 反应，激活的物种与另一分子反应形成产物。
4. 产物从表面脱附。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论通常取决于特定的基质、催化剂和条件。尽管机制已被广泛接受，但在某些情况下仍然存在细微差别和例外，这仍然是研究人员继续探索的问题。

该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它在各种工业过程中的广泛应用，包括化学品、燃料和材料的生产。尽管已经研究了一个世纪以上，但新的见解和应用仍在不断被发现，挑战传统的理解，并导致催化和反应工程的进步。
