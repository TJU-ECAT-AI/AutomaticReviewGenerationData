<p>The overall chemistry proposed here for allyl halides on Pt(111) is depicted schematically in Figure 10.</p>
<p>On the clean Pt(111) surface, both allyls were found to bond to the surface via the halogen atom in a gauche conformation and with the CCC plane close to parallel to the surface.</p>
<p>In the presence of surface hydrogen, allyl iodide was found to tilt backward such that the CCC plane adopts a more vertical orientation on the surface; in this more upright geometry, both cis and gauche isomers were identified.</p>
<p>A η 1 allylic moiety was identified by RAIRS in the high-exposure regime of allyl iodide after annealing to 200 K, and the formation of a second η3 allylic intermediate was inferred from TPD experiments with coadsorbed hydrogen and deuterium.</p>
<p>At low surface concentrations, allyl moieties mainly dehydrogenate, ultimately to H2(g) and Cads.</p>
<p>At coverages approaching monolayer, on the other hand, some of the allyls hydrogenate to propene around 310 K via a process which relies on the decomposition of a few of the same surface allyl moieties as the source of hydrogen.</p>
<p>Propene is seen to desorb in two temperature desorption peaks. The first, at 185 K, is likely to come from direct hydrogenation of the η1 allyl intermediate, and does not involve any appreciable HD exchange.</p>
<p>The fact that this decrease only occurs at coverages above a critical value can be explained by (1) a blocking of empty sites for dehydrogenation, which also makes hydrogenation of surface allyl moiety more viable; and (2) a geometrical rearrangement of the allyl moiety due to surface crowding which facilitates hydrogenation.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps:

1. Activation of the hydrogen molecule (H2) to form an active hydrogen species (H*).
2. Reaction of the active hydrogen species with the substrate to form an intermediate.
3. Rearrangement of the intermediate to a product and a reformed active hydrogen species.
4. Recycling of the active hydrogen species back to the surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study. The rate-limiting step is often debated between the activation of hydrogen and the subsequent reaction of the active hydrogen species with the substrate. Factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the type of substrate, and the conditions of the reaction can influence which step is rate-limiting.

Despite the extensive research, the precise mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions and the exact role of each step in the overall reaction kinetics remain subjects of scientific inquiry and debate. The complexity of these reactions and the interplay between different steps contribute to the persistence of this topic as a subject of interest in chemical research.

霍里图-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：

1. 活化氢分子（H2）形成活性氢物种（H*）。
2. 活性氢物种与底物反应形成中间体。
3. 中间体重组为产物和重新形成的活性氢物种。
4. 回收活性氢物种回到表面。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论仍然是科学研究的一个热点问题，尽管已经研究了一个世纪。争论的焦点通常是在氢分子活化和随后的活性氢物种与底物反应之间。催化剂的性质、底物的类型以及反应条件等因素可以影响哪一步是速率限制步骤。

尽管进行了大量的研究，但脱氢反应的确切机制以及每个步骤在总体反应动力学中的确切作用仍是一些科学探索的主题。这些反应的复杂性和不同步骤之间的相互作用导致了这一主题作为化学研究领域持续的兴趣。
