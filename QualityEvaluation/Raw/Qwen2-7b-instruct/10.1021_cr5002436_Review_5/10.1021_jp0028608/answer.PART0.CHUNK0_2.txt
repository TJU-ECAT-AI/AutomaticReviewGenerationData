<p>Allyl iodide Thermal Chemistry on Pt(111)</p>
<p>The dissociation of allyl iodide on Pt(111) at low temperatures produces a surface allyl moiety capable of self-hydrogenation to propene.</p>
<p>After high exposures to allyl iodide, the 41 amu TPD also displays a peak at 160 K.</p>
<p>Because of the insignificant contribution of propene fragments to the 29 amu signal, propane desorption was primarily monitored with that mass, together with simultaneous monitoring of the 43 and 44 amu TPD traces.</p>
<p>Notice that while the propene desorption profiles are similar in both systems, the associated desorption temperatures do not show similar behavior.</p>
<p>When the Pt(111) surface is treated with hydrogen before dosing with allyl iodide, propane desorption begins at lower temperatures, at least 40 K lower than in its absence, and the yield of that alkane increases substantially.</p>
<p>The overall propene and propane yields are lower in this experiment, most likely because of the displacement of some of the iodide by the incoming hydrogen.</p>
<p>Propene yields at 310 K are approximately constant up to adsorption temperatures of 260 K.</p>
<p>The yields of both 305 and 430 K hydrogen desorption processes increase almost linearly with allyl iodide doses up to 2.5 L.</p>
<p>When hydrogen is made available on the surface (by predosing H2), the allyl hydrogenation process at 310 K is substantially suppressed in favor of a low-temperature hydrogenation step around 185 K.</p>
<p>It is suggested here that, in the absence of Hads, the allyl moieties form on the surface below 160 K but do not dissociate until about 270 K.</p>

1. Allyl iodide dissociation on Pt(111) at low temperatures creates a surface allyl moiety that can self-hydrogenate to propene.
2. High exposure to allyl iodide leads to a peak at 160 K in the 41 amu TPD data.
3. Propane desorption was mainly monitored through the 29 amu signal, alongside the 43 and 44 amu TPD traces.
4. Propene desorption profiles in both systems share similarities, yet their associated desorption temperatures differ.
5. Pre-dosing the surface with hydrogen reduces the temperature of propane desorption by at least 40 K and significantly increases its yield.
6. The experiment with pre-dosed hydrogen shows lower overall propene and propane yields due to iodide displacement.
7. Propene yields at 310 K remain constant until adsorption temperatures reach 260 K.
8. The 305 and 430 K hydrogen desorption processes' yields increase linearly with allyl iodide doses up to 2.5 L.
9. The allyl hydrogenation process at 310 K is suppressed when hydrogen is made available on the surface, favoring a low-temperature hydrogenation step around 185 K.
10. In the absence of hydrogen, allyl moieties form on the surface below 160 K but do not dissociate until around 270 K.

1. 在Pt(111)表面上，低温度下碘代丙烯的解离产生表面丙烯基，能够自我氢化生成丙烯。
2. 高剂量碘代丙烯导致160 K处的41 amu TPD数据中的峰值。
3. 碳链烷烃的脱氢主要通过29 amu信号监测，同时伴随43和44 amu TPD轨迹的同步监控。
4. 两个系统中，丙烯脱氢的模式相似，但其相关脱氢温度不一致。
5. 在表面预涂氢后，丙烷脱氢开始在比无氢时低至少40 K的温度下进行，并且其产量显著增加。
6. 含有预涂氢的实验显示，丙烯和丙烷的总体产量较低，这是由于碘离子被进来的氢置换。
7. 310 K处的丙烯产量在吸附温度达到260 K时保持不变。
8. 305和430 K氢气脱除过程的产量在碘代丙烯剂量达到2.5 L时线性增加。
9. 当表面提供氢时，310 K处的丙烯氢化过程被低至185 K的氢化步骤取代。
10. 在没有氢的情况下，丙烯基在低于160 K的表面形成并直到大约270 K才解离。
