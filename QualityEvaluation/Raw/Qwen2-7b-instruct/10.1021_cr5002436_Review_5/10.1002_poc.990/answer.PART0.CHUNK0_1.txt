[1] "The three-bridge models do not seem to offer any stable ethylhydridochromium(V) complexes, hence oxidative addition of ethane is not likely to take place at such sites."
[2] "The importance of the choice of oxide carrier for the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction is the subject of a forthcoming publication."
[3] "The activation energy computed for this initial step is 160 kJ mol1. However, since the ethylhydridochromium complex is unstable with respect to reductive elimination, the subsequent step towards dehydrogenation must proceed immediately."
[4] "The computed enthalpy and free energy of activation are 220 and 347 kJ mol1, respectively."
[5] "The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is therefore fairly high and on a level with that of the -bond metathesis reaction on unstrained three-bridge species."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: oxidative addition, internal hydrogen shift, elimination of the hydrogen atom, and reformation of the catalyst. The ongoing debate centers around the first step, oxidative addition, versus the second step, internal hydrogen shift, regarding which is the rate-limiting step. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexities involved in the dehydrogenation process and the challenges in understanding the precise rates and mechanisms of each step.

The oxidative addition step involves the binding of hydrogen to the catalyst surface, typically through a formal oxidation of the metal center and a change in spin state. This process creates an intermediate that is unstable with respect to reductive elimination, necessitating the next step, internal hydrogen shift, to stabilize the system. The internal hydrogen shift involves the transfer of a hydrogen atom from the ligand to the metal center, often accompanied by a rearrangement of the molecular structure.

The reformation of the catalyst is the final step, in which the dehydrogenated product is released, allowing the catalyst to regenerate and participate in another round of the reaction. The reformation step often involves the breaking of a metal-ligand bond and the re-establishment of the original catalyst structure.

The debate regarding the rate-limiting step is driven by the complexity of the reaction pathway and the various factors that influence the rates of individual steps, including the stability of intermediates, the strength of metal-ligand bonds, and the energetic barriers between steps. The computational studies in the document suggest that the oxidative addition step, especially the transition state of the stereochemical rearrangement, is the kinetic bottleneck for dehydrogenation by oxidative addition. However, this conclusion is based on the specific conditions and models used in the study and may vary under different circumstances.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because dehydrogenation reactions are crucial in industrial processes, such as petrochemical refining, and understanding the mechanisms of these reactions can lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts. Despite the progress made in understanding the mechanism, many aspects of the reaction dynamics, particularly the relative rates of the individual steps and the role of surface properties in determining reactivity, remain areas of active research and discussion.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制中的催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：氧化加成、内部氢迁移、氢原子消除和催化剂的重新形成。关于哪个步骤是决定性的步骤，即氧化加成步骤还是内部氢迁移步骤，存在着持续的争议。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但该机制仍然是科学界的兴趣点和争议焦点，原因在于脱氢过程的复杂性以及理解每个步骤精确速率和机制的挑战。

氧化加成步骤涉及在催化剂表面与氢的结合，通常伴随着金属中心的正式氧化和自旋状态的变化。这个过程会生成一个不稳定的中间体，相对于还原消除而言不稳定，因此需要下一步骤，内部氢迁移来稳定系统。内部氢迁移涉及到从配体到金属中心转移氢原子，通常伴随着分子结构的重组。

催化剂的重新形成是最后一步，在该步骤中，脱氢产物被释放，使催化剂再生并参与另一轮反应。重新形成步骤往往涉及金属-配体键的断裂和原始催化剂结构的重建。

关于决定性的步骤的争论是由反应途径的复杂性和影响各个步骤速率的各种因素驱动的，包括中间体的稳定性、金属-配体键的强度以及步骤之间的能量壁垒。文档中的计算研究表明，氧化加成步骤，尤其是重排过渡态，是通过氧化加成进行脱氢的反应动力学瓶颈。然而，这一结论基于研究中使用的特定条件和模型，并且在不同情况下可能有所不同。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界感兴趣的话题，因为脱氢反应对于工业过程，如石油化学精炼至关重要。了解这些反应机制可以导致更高效和选择性催化剂的发展。尽管在理解机制方面取得了进展，但反应动力学的许多方面，特别是各个步骤的相对速率以及表面性质在确定反应活性中的作用，仍是一些活跃研究和讨论的领域。
