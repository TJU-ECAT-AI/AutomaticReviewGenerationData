[1] "The three-bridge models do not seem to offer any stable ethylhydridochromium(V) complexes, hence oxidative addition of ethane is not likely to take place at such sites."
[2] "The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is therefore fairly high and on a level with that of the -bond metathesis reaction on unstrained three-bridge species."
[3] "The computed enthalpy and free energy of activation are 220 and 347 kJ mol1, respectively."
[4] "On DeRossi-type species, CH activation by -bond metathesis, with transfer of hydrogen to the hydroxyl ligand, gives water which is likely to desorb."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: oxidative addition, reduction of the metal center, elimination of hydrogen, and regeneration of the catalyst. The ongoing debate in the scientific community centers around which of these steps is the rate-limiting step, with the reduction step often being considered the most critical. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, this mechanism remains a topic of interest due to its fundamental importance in understanding catalytic processes and its potential applications in industry. The controversy arises from the complexity of the reaction pathways and the influence of various factors such as catalyst structure, substrate properties, and reaction conditions on the relative rates of these steps.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：氧化加成、金属中心的还原、氢的消除以及催化剂的再生。科学界围绕哪一步是限制速率的步骤进行着持续的辩论，通常认为还原步骤最为关键。尽管该机制在近一个世纪的研究中仍是一个热点话题，其重要性在于理解催化过程并探索工业应用的可能性。争议源于反应途径的复杂性和催化剂结构、底物性质和反应条件等因素对这些步骤相对速率的影响。
