[1] "An attractive strategy is therefore to consider, systematically, the different CH activation mechanisms known from organometallic chemistry."
[2] "For reactions of FeO, spin cross-over probabilities as low as 10^-210^-3 have been obtained,43 and even if the probability for a transition metal-mediated two-state reaction may be significantly increased by the exact makeup of the complex,44 the actual probability of the present reaction is likely to be notably lower than unity."
[3] "The computed enthalpy and free energy of activation are 220 and 347 kJ mol1, respectively."
[4] "The kinetic bottleneck of this reaction mechanism is given by the first step, which is associated with CH activation but more precisely with the transition state of the rearrangement step."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study. It involves four main steps: oxidative addition, internal hydrogen shift, deprotonation, and reductive elimination. The ongoing debate centers around which step is considered rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the oxidative addition step is the rate-limiting step, while others suggest it's the internal hydrogen shift. The mechanism remains controversial because it involves a significant activation energy barrier and a complex series of reactions, making it difficult to conclusively determine the rate-limiting step. The mechanism's relevance and applicability continue to be debated among chemists.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制是催化脱氢反应的研究焦点，尽管已经研究了一个世纪。该机制包含四个主要步骤：氧化加成、内部氢转移、去质子化和还原消除。争论的核心在于哪个步骤是决定性步骤。一些研究人员认为氧化加成步骤是决定性的，而另一些人则认为是内部氢转移。由于涉及显著的活化能壁垒和复杂的反应序列，确定决定性步骤存在困难，这使得机制的争议持续存在。该机制的适用性和相关性在化学家中继续受到讨论。
