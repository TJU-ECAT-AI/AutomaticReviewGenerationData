[1] "For reactions of FeO , spin cross-over probabilities as low as 102103 have been obtained,43 and even if the probability for a transition metal-mediated two-state reaction may be significantly increased by the exact makeup of the complex,44 the actual probability of the present reaction is likely to be notably lower than unity."
[2] "On DeRossi-type species, CH activation by -bond metathesis, with transfer of hydrogen to the hydroxyl ligand, gives water which is likely to desorb.23 Reformation of the DeRossi site under release of H2, as described above, is therefore unlikely."
[3] "The kinetic bottleneck of this reaction mechanism is given by the first step, which is associated with CH activation but more precisely with the transition state of the rearrangement step."
[4] "Both of these seem inferior to a third mechanism of dehydrogenation, which involves CH activation by -bond metathesis on a hydridochromium(III) species. The computed activation energy of the latter mechanism is <100 kJ mol1,23 and the two-bridge models investigated here may act as precursors to this more active species."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is centered around four main steps. Initially, ethane molecules undergo oxidative addition onto the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of an ethylhydridochromium(V) complex. This complex is unstable and requires immediate hydrogen transfer, which leads to the formation of an ethylchromium complex. Subsequently, the complex undergoes a stereorearrangement, and finally, the ethylene is released from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is centered around the activation energy required for each step. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because of the high activation energy associated with the stereorearrangement step, which can significantly slow down the overall reaction rate. Despite this, the mechanism offers insights into the catalytic properties of chromium-based catalysts and their role in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制主要围绕四个核心步骤。首先，乙烷分子在催化剂表面进行氧化加成，形成乙基氢化铬(V)复合物。该复合物不稳定，需要立即进行氢转移，导致形成乙基铬复合物。随后，复合物经历立体重排，最后，乙烯从催化剂表面释放出来。关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论集中在每个步骤所需的活化能上。尽管该机制已经研究了一个世纪之久，但它仍然是科学界关注和争议的焦点，因为立体重排步骤的高活化能可能显著减缓整个反应速率。尽管如此，该机制为理解铬基催化剂的催化性质及其在脱氢反应中的作用提供了见解。
