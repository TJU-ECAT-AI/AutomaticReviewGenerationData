[1] "The origins of methane, the primary byproduct of ethane dehydrogenation were also investigated as a part of this study."
[2] "High-resolution TEM revealed the formation of a PtSn bimetallic phase upon introduction of Sn."
[3] "The activity of PtSn/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation at 873 K was highest for a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.3, whereas the ethene selectivity increased monotonically with increasing Sn/Pt ratio,reaching 100% for Sn/Pt = 0.4."
[4] "Sn promotion also significantly decreased the deposition of coke."
[5] "Addition of H2 to the feed enhanced the formation of ethene for H2/C2H6 ratios up to 0.58 for Pt/Mg(Al)O and 0.25 for PtSn/Mg(Al)O, but for higher ratios the product concentration of ethene decreased and approached that determined thermodynamically."
[6] "Coke formation was suppressed consider- ably by H2 addition to the feed, particularly for PtSn/Mg(Al)O."
[7] "Formation of methane resulted primarily from the readsorption of ethene."
[8] "It is notable that while much is known about the effects of Sn on the behavior of PtSn bimetallic catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane, there remain a number of issues not fully understood."
[9] "The elementary processes involved in ethane dehydrogenation to ethene, the formation of methane, and the deposition of coke can be described by the following sequence of reactions."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely accepted theory for the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It comprises four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface.  
2. Activation of the substrate molecule, often involving the breaking of a chemical bond.
3. Formation of an intermediate species.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting continues due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved and the dynamic interplay between various steps. 

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it has been studied for nearly a century, yet its intricacies continue to be explored and refined. The mechanism's validity is challenged by the need to account for various factors such as surface chemistry, kinetic barriers, and the influence of catalyst structure on reaction rates. Moreover, the precise conditions under which certain steps become rate-limiting can vary, contributing to ongoing research and debate.

霍里图-波兰尼机制是催化脱氢反应的广泛接受的理论，包括四个主要步骤：
1. 将底物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 激活底物分子，通常涉及断裂化学键。
3. 形成中间物种。
4. 产品分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪一步被认为是速率限制性的争论持续存在，这主要是由于反应机制的复杂性以及各种步骤之间动态相互作用的原因。

该机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为它已经研究了近一个世纪，但其细节仍在不断探索和改进。机制的有效性受到表面化学、动力学壁垒和催化剂结构对反应速率影响的需要解释的挑战。此外，在特定条件下某些步骤成为速率限制性的精确条件可能不同，这为持续的研究和辩论提供了空间。
