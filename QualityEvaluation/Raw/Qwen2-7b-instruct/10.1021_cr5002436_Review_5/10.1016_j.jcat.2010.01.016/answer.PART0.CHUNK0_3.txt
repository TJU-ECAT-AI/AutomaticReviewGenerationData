The study delves into the origins of methane, a common byproduct of ethane dehydrogenation. Despite extensive knowledge on how tin (Sn) influences the behavior of platinum (Pt) in bimetallic catalysts, many aspects of this process remain unclear. The research highlights that Sn, which can modify the Pt catalyst in various ways, has been subject to numerous studies aimed at understanding the spatial arrangement of Pt and Sn in the catalysts.
