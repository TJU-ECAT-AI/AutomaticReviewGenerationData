The origins of methane, the primary byproduct of ethane dehydrogenation were also investigated as a part of this study. 
The dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene on Sn-promoted Pt supported on calcined hydrotalcite, PtSn/Mg(Al)O, was investigated with the aim of understanding the effects of Sn on the local environment of the dispersed Pt, the catalyst activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation, and the formation of coke.
