[1] "The origins of methane, the primary byproduct of ethane dehydrogenation were also investigated as a part of this study."
[2] "It is notable that while much is known about the effects of Sn on the behavior of PtSn bimetallic catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane, there remain a number of issues not fully understood."
[3] "The dehydrogenation of ethane begins with the dissociative adsorption of C2H6 to form C2H5S species (Reaction 2), a reaction that has been observed to occur on Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 0) surfaces [4954]."
[4] "As noted earlier, the addition of Sn to Pt/Mg(Al)O increases C2H6 consumption and the product selectivity to C2H4, but diminishes the accumulation of coke."
[5] "Both Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O deactivate with time on stream at about the same rate due to the accumulation of coke; however, the amount of coke accumulated on PtSn/Mg(Al)O is significantly lower than that on Pt/Mg(Al)O."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps: (1) adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the substrate molecule by breaking a chemical bond, (3) formation of a reactive intermediate, and (4) desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the mechanism and the potential influence of various factors such as catalyst type, substrate concentration, and reaction conditions. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the exact details of each step and their relative rates can vary significantly depending on the specific reaction system. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is of scientific interest because it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the fundamental aspects of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, which can inform the design of more efficient catalysts and reaction conditions.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应包括四个主要步骤：（1）底物分子在催化剂表面吸附，（2）通过断裂化学键激活底物分子，（3）形成活性中间体，（4）产品分子从催化剂表面脱附。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论，是因为机制的复杂性和各种因素的影响，如催化剂类型、底物浓度和反应条件。尽管已经研究了一个世纪之久，但这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为每个步骤的具体细节及其相对速率在不同的反应系统中可能会有很大差异。Horiuti-Polanyi机制对科学研究具有重要意义，因为它为理解催化脱氢反应的基本方面提供了理论框架，这可以指导设计更高效的催化剂和反应条件。
