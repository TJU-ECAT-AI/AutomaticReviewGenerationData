[1] "In the case of relatively coke-insensitive reactions, the hydrogen pool on the catalyst surface and the strong hydrogenation component of the catalyst keep the surface relatively clean and active even when appreciable quantities of coke are already present on the surface."
[2] "In contrast to the above are the coke-sensitive reactions, in which the coke is deposited directly on the active sites on the catalyst. This coke is unreactive (because there is no hydrogen, or no sufficiently high partial pressure of hydrogen, or a strongly hydrogenating catalyst function in the system) and can be compared to typical catalyst poisoning, in which the activity falls rapidly with increasing quantity of coke on the catalyst."
[3] "Well-known examples for this are catalytic cracking and hydrogenolysis, where <l wt.% coke is enough to deactivate the catalyst almost completely."
[4] "This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface. The second step is the formation of an activated complex through hydrogen abstraction. The third step is the elimination of hydrogen to yield the product. The fourth step is the regeneration of the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the mechanism and the interplay between the steps. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the challenges in understanding the precise details of the mechanism and the difficulties in experimentally verifying the theoretical predictions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。第一步是底物在催化剂表面的吸附。第二步是通过氢抽象形成活化复合物。第三步是通过消除氢生成产物。第四步是催化剂表面的再生。关于哪一步被认为是速率决定步骤的争论，是因为机制的复杂性和步骤之间的相互作用。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为理解机制的精确细节的挑战以及在实验上验证理论预测的困难。
