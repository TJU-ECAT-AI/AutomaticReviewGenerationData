[1] "In catalytic reforming, catalysts such as Pt/alumina or the bimetallic Pt+Re/alumina are slowly and deliberately coked to about 0.5 wt.% of coke on the catalyst."
[2] "Without this controlled coking at the start of the run, the catalyst will induce excessive hydrogenolysis and uncontrolled coking."
[3] "In contrast to the above are the coke-sensitive reactions, in which the coke is deposited directly on the active sites on the catalyst."
[4] "The cause of deactivation in such a case has been investigated [Sl by a temperature-programmed combustion of the coke on the catalyst, where a very slow coke combustion lasting for several hours even at 720 C was observed."
[5] "The remarkable differences in the nature and location of coke on catalyst, depending on the way this coke is deposited, can be demonstrated as follows:"

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, focusing on the four main steps: (1) adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the molecule through interaction with the catalyst, (3) dehydrogenation of the molecule, and (4) desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate revolves around which of these steps is rate-limiting. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the influence of catalyst properties on the reaction kinetics.

The mechanism is significant because it provides insights into how the catalyst affects the dehydrogenation process, influencing the yield and selectivity of the products. The mechanism's applicability varies across different catalysts and reaction conditions, contributing to the ongoing research and development in catalysis. Despite extensive study, understanding the precise mechanisms involved in dehydrogenation reactions and optimizing catalysts for specific applications remains a challenge in chemical engineering and catalysis.

The rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a subject of debate among researchers. Factors such as the strength of the adsorption force, the activation energy required for dehydrogenation, and the stability of the intermediate species can influence which step controls the overall reaction rate. Different catalysts and reaction conditions may favor different steps, leading to discrepancies in the perceived rate-limiting step.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its complexity and the intricate relationship between catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism's versatility in explaining various dehydrogenation reactions across different industries highlights its importance in catalysis. Continued research aims to refine the mechanism, understand the role of catalysts in controlling the rate-limiting step, and optimize catalytic processes for improved efficiency and selectivity.

In summary, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps, but the debate around the rate-limiting step continues due to the mechanism's complexity and the influence of catalyst properties and reaction conditions. The mechanism's relevance in chemical engineering and catalysis underscores its enduring significance in the field.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述了催化脱氢反应，包括四个主要步骤：（1）反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附，（2）通过与催化剂的相互作用激活分子，（3）对分子进行脱氢，（4）产品分子从催化剂表面脱附。关于哪一步是决定性的争论围绕在这些步骤中。尽管该机制已研究了一个世纪，但它仍然是科学界关注和争议的焦点，原因在于反应途径的复杂性和催化剂性质对反应动力学的影响。

由于催化剂对脱氢过程的影响提供了有关产物产率和选择性的见解，因此该机制在化学工程和催化领域具有重要意义。不同催化剂和反应条件下的机制适用性表明，优化催化过程以提高效率和选择性仍面临挑战。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制的决定性步骤在研究人员之间存在争议。吸附力的强度、脱氢所需的活化能以及中间物种的稳定性等因素可能影响控制整体反应速率的步骤。不同的催化剂和反应条件可能会使不同步骤占优势，导致关于决定性步骤的分歧。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制在化学工程和催化领域的持续关注和争议源于其复杂性和催化剂属性、反应条件与脱氢过程之间的密切关系。机制的灵活性使其能够解释不同行业中的各种脱氢反应，凸显了其在催化领域的重要性。继续研究旨在细化机制、理解催化剂在控制决定性步骤方面的作用，并优化催化过程以提高效率和选择性。

简而言之，Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤，但关于决定性步骤的争论仍在继续，原因在于机制的复杂性和催化剂属性与反应条件之间的关系。机制在化学工程和催化领域的相关性强调了其在该领域的持久意义。

[1] "In the case of relatively coke-insensitive reactions, the hydrogen pool on the catalyst surface and the strong hydrogenation component of the catalyst keep the surface relatively clean and active even when appreciable quantities of coke are already present on the surface."
[2] "In contrast to the above are the coke-sensitive reactions, in which the coke is deposited directly on the active sites on the catalyst. This coke is unreactive (because there is no hydrogen, or no sufficiently high partial pressure of hydrogen, or a strongly hydrogenating catalyst function in the system) and can be compared to typical catalyst poisoning, in which the activity falls rapidly with increasing quantity of coke on the catalyst."
[3] "Well-known examples for this are catalytic cracking and hydrogenolysis, where <l wt.% coke is enough to deactivate the catalyst almost completely."
[4] "This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface. The second step is the formation of an activated complex through hydrogen abstraction. The third step is the elimination of hydrogen to yield the product. The fourth step is the regeneration of the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the mechanism and the interplay between the steps. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the challenges in understanding the precise details of the mechanism and the difficulties in experimentally verifying the theoretical predictions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。第一步是底物在催化剂表面的吸附。第二步是通过氢抽象形成活化复合物。第三步是通过消除氢生成产物。第四步是催化剂表面的再生。关于哪一步被认为是速率决定步骤的争论，是因为机制的复杂性和步骤之间的相互作用。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为理解机制的精确细节的挑战以及在实验上验证理论预测的困难。
