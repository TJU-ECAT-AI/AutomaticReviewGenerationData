<p>The adsorption of ethene on the three surfaces Pt(111), Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) was investigated experimentally by TPD and HREELS as well as theoretically by DFT calculations.</p>
<p>On the Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys ethene preferentially adsorbs in a di-r conformation occupying pure platinum bridge sites. However on all surfaces a coadsorbed p species has been identified, which is rather abundant on Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface because the difference in adsorption energy of the di-r and the p is small species on this surface (11.4 kJ/mol). This p species has formerly only been identified on Pt(111) at temperatures below 52 K [14,15].</p>
<p>Most importantly as in the case of cyclopentene [13] the vibration spectra of the adsorbed ethene are only weakly influenced despite the strong decrease of the adsorption energy on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111). This suggests a similar hybridization of the molecules on all three surfaces. This result is corroborated by the almost identical pr parameters for the ethene on the different surfaces.</p>
<p>Finally, the comparison of the calculated vibration spectra with the experimental ones allows us to perform a complete assignment of the vibration modes of the adsorbed ethene species.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the molecule by breaking bonds within the molecule, often facilitated by the surface's active sites.
3. Formation of an activated complex, which is a reactive intermediate formed by the interaction of the molecule and the catalyst surface.
4. Decomposition of the activated complex to produce the desired products, often accompanied by the release of heat or other byproducts.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The rate-limiting step typically depends on the specific catalyst, the reactant, and the reaction conditions. Catalysts can exhibit different behaviors depending on the nature of the reactants and the activation energies required for the individual steps.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it helps explain the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic processes. Understanding the detailed mechanisms involved in catalysis can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts and processes, which is crucial for many industrial applications, including petrochemical production and environmental remediation.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a fundamental concept in catalysis research, providing insights into how catalysts facilitate chemical reactions at the molecular level. The debate around the rate-limiting step adds complexity to this field, driving further investigation into the kinetics and dynamics of catalytic processes. The ongoing research aims to refine our understanding of catalytic mechanisms and optimize catalyst design for various applications.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 分子内部键的断裂，通常由表面的活性位点促进。
3. 形成活化复合物，即通过分子与催化剂表面相互作用形成的活性中间体。
4. 活化复合物分解生成所需产物，通常伴随热量或其他副产品的释放。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的持续辩论仍然是科学界的热点话题。速率决定步骤通常取决于特定的催化剂、反应物和反应条件。催化剂在不同性质的反应物和所需的激活能方面表现出不同的行为。

尽管已经研究了一个多世纪，这个机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为它有助于解释催化过程的效率和选择性。对催化机制的深入了解可以导致更高效的催化剂和过程的发展，这对于包括石油化学生产和环境修复在内的许多工业应用至关重要。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制是催化研究的基础概念，提供了理解催化剂如何在分子水平上促进化学反应的见解。关于速率决定步骤的辩论增加了这一领域的复杂性，推动了进一步调查催化过程的动力学和动态。正在进行的研究旨在细化我们对催化机制的理解，并优化催化剂设计以应用于各种应用。
