[1] "In this work we aim at the more complete understanding of the bonding mechanism of ethene on Pt(111) and the two ordered PtxSn surface alloys."
[2] "The adsorption of ethene on the three surfaces Pt(111), Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) was investigated experimentally by TPD and HREELS as well as theoretically by DFT calculations."
[3] "On the Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys ethene preferentially adsorbs in a di-r conformation occupying pure platinum bridge sites."
[4] "However on all surfaces a coadsorbed p species has been identified, which is rather abundant on Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface because the difference in adsorption energy of the di-r and the p is small species on this surface (11.4 kJ/mol)."
[5] "This p species has formerly only been identified on Pt(111) at temperatures below 52 K [14,15]."
[6] "Most importantly as in the case of cyclopentene [13] the vibration spectra of the adsorbed ethene are only weakly influenced despite the strong decrease of the adsorption energy on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111)."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: activation of hydrogen, cleavage of a hydrogen molecule, reaction of the activated hydrogen with a reactant molecule, and release of the product molecule. The ongoing debate in the scientific community focuses on which step is considered rate-limiting, with some arguing for the activation of hydrogen, others for the cleavage of hydrogen, and still others for the reaction of the activated hydrogen with the reactant molecule. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its complexity and the intricate nature of the catalytic processes involved.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：氢的活化、氢分子的断裂、活化氢与反应物分子的反应以及产物分子的释放。科学界对哪个步骤是决定性的争论不休，一些人认为是氢的活化，另一些人则认为是氢分子的断裂，还有人认为是活化氢与反应物分子的反应。尽管这一机制已经研究了一个多世纪，但它仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，原因在于其复杂性和催化过程的精细性质。
