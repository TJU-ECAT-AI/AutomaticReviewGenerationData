The bonding mechanism of ethene on Pt(111) and the two ordered PtxSn surface alloys was comprehensively investigated using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) methods. The decomposition of ethene on the PtSn surface alloys was not observed in the TPD spectra. As the Sn content on the surface increased, the desorption temperature and adsorption energy of ethene decreased. The greater abundance of p ethene compared to di-r ethene on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy relative to the other surfaces could be explained by the comparison of their corresponding adsorption energies.

本文对乙烯在Pt(111)和两个有序PtxSn表面合金上的键合机制进行了全面的研究，使用了高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和温度程序脱附（TPD）方法。没有在PtSn表面合金的TPD光谱中观察到乙烯的分解。随着表面中Sn含量的增加，乙烯的脱附温度和吸附能降低。Pt2Sn/Pt(111)表面合金中p乙烯相对于其他表面的相对丰富可以由其对应的吸附能的比较来解释。
