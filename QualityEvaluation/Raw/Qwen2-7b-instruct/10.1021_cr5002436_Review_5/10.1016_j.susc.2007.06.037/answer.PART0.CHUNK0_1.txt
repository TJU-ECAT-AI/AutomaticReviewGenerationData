<p>Good candidates for such as systematic investigation are the two ordered PtSn surface alloys first reported by Paffet and Windham [5]. These Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn surface alloys are well characterized by a variety of techniques [6] and can be easily prepared by annealing of a Sn-covered Pt(111) surface at high temperatures.</p>
<p>Extensive studies of the adsorption of hydrocarbons on PtxSn/Pt(111) show a suppressed dehydrogenation on these surface alloys compared to the pure Pt(111) surface [1013]. Investigations of ethene on these surfaces with temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) suggested that the absence of dehydrogenation is due to missing adjacent platinum 3-fold hollow sites, which are needed during the development of the decomposition product ethylidyne [10,11].</p>
<p>The p species has however been found to coexist with the di-r species under high pressure conditions [25] and its importance for the hydrogenation of ethene on Pt(111) was pointed out by O fner and Zaera [26,27] and Cremer et al. [28]. Above 240 K a conversion to ethylidyne occurs [16,18,19,29], which is accompanied by a self-hydrogena- tion of a minor fraction of the ethene [27].</p>
<p>In this work we aim at the more complete understanding of the bonding mechanism of ethene on Pt(111) and the two ordered PtxSn surface alloys. To this end, the adsorp- tion of ethene was investigated experimentally using HREELS and TPD, and these results are compared to the- oretical results from DFT calculations.</p>
<p>After discussing the main features of the ethene desorp- tion from Pt(111) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and the Pt2Sn/ Pt(111) surface, we now turn to the presentation of the HREELS results.</p>
<p>First of all the vibration features of the adsorbed ethene on the three surfaces Pt(111), Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/ Pt(111) will be compared. In Fig. 6 the corresponding HREELS spectra recorded after monolayer adsorption at 90 K are displayed.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The mechanism begins with the adsorption of a hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface. The next step is activation, where the molecule undergoes a change in structure, often involving breaking of bonds within the molecule. Following activation, a reaction occurs, typically involving the breaking of a bond between the molecule and the catalyst surface. Finally, the product is desorbed from the surface, often accompanied by the release of heat or another molecule, such as hydrogen. 

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism primarily revolves around the activation step. Some researchers argue that the activation step is the slowest and therefore rate-limiting, as it requires significant energy input to alter the structure of the molecule. Others suggest that the desorption step might be rate-limiting, particularly in cases where the product molecule needs to overcome a high activation barrier to leave the surface. This debate continues as researchers seek to understand the complex interplay between adsorption, activation, reaction, and desorption processes in catalytic systems.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of its fundamental role in many industrial processes, such as the production of olefins and aromatics from hydrocarbons. Understanding the rate-limiting step in this mechanism could lead to improvements in catalyst design, potentially increasing efficiency and reducing costs in these industries. Additionally, the mechanism's complexity, involving multiple steps and intricate interactions, makes it a rich area for further research into the fundamentals of catalysis.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。机制开始时，将烃类分子吸附到催化剂表面。接下来是激活步骤，在此步骤中，分子结构发生变化，通常涉及到分子内部键的断裂。随后发生反应，通常涉及到分子与催化剂表面之间的键的断裂。最后一步是产品从表面解吸，通常伴随着热量或其他分子（如氢气）的释放。

关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制中哪个步骤被认为是决定性的步骤的争论主要集中在激活步骤。一些研究人员认为，激活步骤是最慢的，因此是决定性的，因为它需要大量的能量输入来改变分子的结构。其他人则认为，解吸步骤可能是决定性的，尤其是在产物分子需要克服高激活势垒才能离开表面的情况下。这个争议仍在继续，因为研究人员正在努力理解催化体系中的吸附、激活、反应和解吸过程之间的复杂相互作用。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它在许多工业过程中起着基础作用，例如从烃类生产烯烃和芳烃。理解这个机制中的决定性步骤可以导致催化剂设计的改进，从而提高效率并降低这些行业的成本。此外，由于机制涉及多个步骤和复杂的相互作用，它是一个深入研究催化基本原理的丰富领域。
