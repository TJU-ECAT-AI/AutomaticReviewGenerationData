<p>On the Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys ethene preferentially adsorbs in a di-r conformation occupying pure platinum bridge sites. However on all surfaces a coadsorbed p species has been identified, which is rather abundant on Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface because the difference in adsorption energy of the di-r and the p is small species on this surface (11.4 kJ/mol).</p>
<p>This p species has formerly only been identified on Pt(111) at temperatures below 
52 K [14,15].</p>
<p>Most importantly  as in the case of cyclopentene [13] the vibration spectra of the adsorbed ethene are only weakly influenced despite the strong decrease of the adsorption energy on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111). This suggests a similar hybridization of the molecules on all three surfaces.</p>
<p>Finally, the comparison of the calculated vibration spectra with the experimental ones allows us to perform a complete assignment of the vibration modes of the adsorbed ethene species.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: activation, transition state formation, reaction, and product release. However, the literature does not provide details on this mechanism or discuss the ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of catalytic processes and the difficulty in accurately determining reaction rates and mechanisms.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：激活、过渡态形成、反应和产物释放。然而，文献没有提供有关此机制的详细信息或讨论关于速率限制步骤的争论。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的主题，原因是对催化过程的复杂性和准确确定反应速率和机制的困难。
