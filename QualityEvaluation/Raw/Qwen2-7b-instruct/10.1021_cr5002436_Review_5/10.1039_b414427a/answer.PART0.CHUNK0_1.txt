The research focuses on utilizing a combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR set-up to conduct quantitative Raman spectroscopy on supported metal oxide catalysts during their operation. The primary goal is to measure the amount of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface without the necessity of an internal standard. Coke formation was confirmed through TEOM, TGA, and Raman techniques. The methodology was compared with an approach involving an internal boron nitride standard. The researchers found that the diffuse reflectance correction factor G(RN) could be used to quantify the Raman spectra. They validated their technique by comparing it with TEOM data, showing that the Raman quantitation method accurately reflected the coke formation trends. The technique offers the potential for online process control in industrial reactors, particularly for monitoring coke deposition. The research highlights the importance of considering the catalyst's darkening during reactions and the role of the G(RN) correction factor in adjusting Raman intensities accordingly. Propene was identified as the precursor for coke formation, with initial coke benefiting the dehydrogenation process but leading to a decrease in activity once it became more graphitic. The developed method enables the quantification of coke amounts on the catalyst material over time and across different positions within the reactor bed, providing insights into the long-term deactivation phenomena associated with ruby formation.

这项研究专注于利用结合的在运行Raman/UV-Vis-NIR装置来进行催化剂操作期间的定量拉曼光谱分析。主要目标是无需内标即可测量催化剂表面上的碳质沉积物。通过TEOM、TGA和拉曼技术确认了焦炭的形成。该方法与添加到催化剂固体中的内部硼氮标准的方法进行了比较。研究者发现，可以通过G(RN)校正因子来量化拉曼光谱。他们通过与TEOM数据的比较验证了他们的技术，显示拉曼量化方法准确反映了焦炭形成趋势。该技术为工业反应器中的在线过程控制提供了可能性，特别是监测焦炭沉积。研究强调了在反应过程中考虑催化剂变暗的重要性，以及G(RN)校正因子调整拉曼强度的作用。丙烯被识别为形成焦炭的前体，初始焦炭对烷烃脱氢过程有益，但一旦变为石墨状，导致活性下降。所开发的方法能够量化催化剂材料上的焦炭量随时间变化并跨越不同的反应器床位置，提供了与长期失活现象相关的宝石形成相关的信息。
