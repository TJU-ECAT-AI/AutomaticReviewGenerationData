[3] "It was found that both approaches are suitable, but the use of a combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR set-up clearly has the advantage that no additional compounds have to be added to the catalytic system under investigation."

This study explores the use of quantitative Raman spectroscopy for monitoring the dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-like catalyst, focusing on the formation of coke. The authors compare two methods for quantifying the Raman spectra, one involving the use of an internal standard (boron nitride) and the other utilizing a diffuse reflectance correction factor. They conclude that the latter method offers several advantages, including the ability to quantitatively assess the amount of coke formed during the reaction, which is beneficial for propane dehydrogenation. The authors note that propene, the product of the dehydrogenation reaction, serves as the precursor for coke formation, with the initial coke being advantageous for the reaction but leading to a decrease in activity as the reaction progresses and the coke transforms into a more detrimental form.

The research focuses on utilizing a combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR set-up to conduct quantitative Raman spectroscopy on supported metal oxide catalysts during their operation. The primary goal is to measure the amount of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface without the necessity of an internal standard. Coke formation was confirmed through TEOM, TGA, and Raman techniques. The methodology was compared with an approach involving an internal boron nitride standard. The researchers found that the diffuse reflectance correction factor G(RN) could be used to quantify the Raman spectra. They validated their technique by comparing it with TEOM data, showing that the Raman quantitation method accurately reflected the coke formation trends. The technique offers the potential for online process control in industrial reactors, particularly for monitoring coke deposition. The research highlights the importance of considering the catalyst's darkening during reactions and the role of the G(RN) correction factor in adjusting Raman intensities accordingly. Propene was identified as the precursor for coke formation, with initial coke benefiting the dehydrogenation process but leading to a decrease in activity once it became more graphitic. The developed method enables the quantification of coke amounts on the catalyst material over time and across different positions within the reactor bed, providing insights into the long-term deactivation phenomena associated with ruby formation.

这项研究专注于利用结合的在运行Raman/UV-Vis-NIR装置来进行催化剂操作期间的定量拉曼光谱分析。主要目标是无需内标即可测量催化剂表面上的碳质沉积物。通过TEOM、TGA和拉曼技术确认了焦炭的形成。该方法与添加到催化剂固体中的内部硼氮标准的方法进行了比较。研究者发现，可以通过G(RN)校正因子来量化拉曼光谱。他们通过与TEOM数据的比较验证了他们的技术，显示拉曼量化方法准确反映了焦炭形成趋势。该技术为工业反应器中的在线过程控制提供了可能性，特别是监测焦炭沉积。研究强调了在反应过程中考虑催化剂变暗的重要性，以及G(RN)校正因子调整拉曼强度的作用。丙烯被识别为形成焦炭的前体，初始焦炭对烷烃脱氢过程有益，但一旦变为石墨状，导致活性下降。所开发的方法能够量化催化剂材料上的焦炭量随时间变化并跨越不同的反应器床位置，提供了与长期失活现象相关的宝石形成相关的信息。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant onto the catalyst surface. 
2. Activation, where the reactant undergoes a chemical transformation to form an intermediate species. 
3. Surface reaction, where the intermediate species reacts with another reactant to form a product. 
4. Desorption, where the product is released from the catalyst surface. 

Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the debate continues about which of these steps is rate-limiting. The ongoing scientific interest in this mechanism stems from its fundamental importance in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes, especially those involving dehydrogenation reactions. The precise identification of the rate-limiting step can significantly impact the design and efficiency of catalysts, which are crucial for various industrial applications, including petrochemical processing and energy production.

The use of combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopic techniques in this research validates the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism by providing quantitative insights into the dynamic processes occurring during the dehydrogenation reaction. The close agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions supports the relevance of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism in describing the catalytic dehydrogenation process. This method offers a powerful tool for monitoring and controlling the performance of catalysts in real-time, enabling more efficient and sustainable industrial processes.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物在催化剂表面的吸附。

Answer: This scientific literature discusses the exploration of quantitative Raman spectroscopy techniques for measuring the amount of carbonaceous deposits on catalyst surfaces during working conditions without requiring an internal standard. The dehydrogenation of propane over a 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst serves as a model system. The formation of coke is confirmed through multiple analytical methods including TEOM, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra can be used quantitatively to measure the amount of carbonaceous deposits at the catalyst surface if a correction factor G(RN) is applied. This methodology compares favorably to one involving an internal boron nitride standard and enables the measurement of carbonaceous deposits on a catalyst material as a function of reaction time and catalyst bed height. The relationship between diffuse reflectance RN and Raman intensity CN is crucial for this comparison. The proposed approach utilizes equations (1) and (2) to calculate the true Raman intensity under the assumption that the scattering coefficient s remains constant. The researchers believe their methodology can be broadly applied to the quantitative study of supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions.

这篇科学文献探讨了在无需内标的情况下，对工作条件下金属氧化物催化剂表面碳沉积量进行定量拉曼光谱测量的可能性。丙烷脱氢作为工业催化剂模型系统被使用。通过TEOM、TGA和拉曼光谱等多种方法证实了焦炭的形成。拉曼光谱可以用于量化催化剂表面的碳沉积量，前提是在应用校正因子G(RN)后。这种方法与添加内标（如硼氮化物）的方法相比，显示出较好的优势，并允许测量反应时间和催化剂床高度变化时催化剂材料上的碳沉积量。为了在不同时间点比较催化反应器内的拉曼强度，需要知道无限厚度催化固体的漫反射率（RN）与拉曼强度（CN）之间的关系。幸运的是，方程(1)和(2)允许在假设散射系数s保持不变的情况下计算特定物种的真实拉曼强度rI0。研究人员相信他们的方法可以广泛应用于工作条件下研究支持型金属氧化物催化剂的定量分析。
