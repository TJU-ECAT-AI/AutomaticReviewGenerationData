[1] "Recent technical developments have tremendously increased the popularity of Raman spectroscopy as a characterization tool to obtain physico-chemical information on heteroge- neously catalized reaction systems."
[2] "Furthermore, Raman intensities depend on the scattering and absorption properties of the catalytic solid."
[3] "As the dehydrogenation proceeds, the catalyst gradually darkens due to coke formation and consequently the UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance and Raman scattered signal progressively decrease in intensity."
[4] "This factor can be directly calculated from the corresponding UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra."
[5] "In order to compare Raman intensities at different times-on-stream inside a catalytic reactor, the relationship between the diffuse reflectance of the catalytic solid of infinite thickness (RN) and the Raman intensity (CN) must be known."
[6] "The main advantage of the developed method is that no additional compound is required to quantify the measured Raman spectra."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. However, the literature provided does not contain specific details about the mechanism itself or the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The focus of the document is on the application of Raman spectroscopy in studying catalysts during dehydrogenation reactions. It does not address the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism directly. Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be derived from the provided literature.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。然而，提供的文献中没有关于机制本身的详细信息或认为哪一步是限制性步骤的持续辩论。该文档的重点在于研究催化剂在脱氢反应期间应用拉曼光谱学。它没有直接涉及Horiuti-Polanyi机制。
