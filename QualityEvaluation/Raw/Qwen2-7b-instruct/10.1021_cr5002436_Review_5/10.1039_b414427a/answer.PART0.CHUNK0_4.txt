Answer: This scientific literature discusses the exploration of quantitative Raman spectroscopy techniques for measuring the amount of carbonaceous deposits on catalyst surfaces during working conditions without requiring an internal standard. The dehydrogenation of propane over a 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst serves as a model system. The formation of coke is confirmed through multiple analytical methods including TEOM, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra can be used quantitatively to measure the amount of carbonaceous deposits at the catalyst surface if a correction factor G(RN) is applied. This methodology compares favorably to one involving an internal boron nitride standard and enables the measurement of carbonaceous deposits on a catalyst material as a function of reaction time and catalyst bed height. The relationship between diffuse reflectance RN and Raman intensity CN is crucial for this comparison. The proposed approach utilizes equations (1) and (2) to calculate the true Raman intensity under the assumption that the scattering coefficient s remains constant. The researchers believe their methodology can be broadly applied to the quantitative study of supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions.

这篇科学文献探讨了在无需内标的情况下，对工作条件下金属氧化物催化剂表面碳沉积量进行定量拉曼光谱测量的可能性。丙烷脱氢作为工业催化剂模型系统被使用。通过TEOM、TGA和拉曼光谱等多种方法证实了焦炭的形成。拉曼光谱可以用于量化催化剂表面的碳沉积量，前提是在应用校正因子G(RN)后。这种方法与添加内标（如硼氮化物）的方法相比，显示出较好的优势，并允许测量反应时间和催化剂床高度变化时催化剂材料上的碳沉积量。为了在不同时间点比较催化反应器内的拉曼强度，需要知道无限厚度催化固体的漫反射率（RN）与拉曼强度（CN）之间的关系。幸运的是，方程(1)和(2)允许在假设散射系数s保持不变的情况下计算特定物种的真实拉曼强度rI0。研究人员相信他们的方法可以广泛应用于工作条件下研究支持型金属氧化物催化剂的定量分析。
