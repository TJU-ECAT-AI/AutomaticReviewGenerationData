[1] "The formation of coke was confirmed with TEOM, TGA and Raman."
[2] "The goal of this work is to explore the possibilities of the developed set-up for performing quantitative Raman spectroscopy taking the dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-like Cr/Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalyst as a case study."
[3] "It was found that both approaches are suitable, but the use of a combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR set-up clearly has the advantage that no additional compounds have to be added to the catalytic system under investigation."
[4] "It was also found that propene is the precursor for coke formation at the catalyst surface and the first coke made is beneficial for propane dehydrogenation."

This study explores the use of quantitative Raman spectroscopy for monitoring the dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-like catalyst, focusing on the formation of coke. The authors compare two methods for quantifying the Raman spectra, one involving the use of an internal standard (boron nitride) and the other utilizing a diffuse reflectance correction factor. They conclude that the latter method offers several advantages, including the ability to quantitatively assess the amount of coke formed during the reaction, which is beneficial for propane dehydrogenation. The authors note that propene, the product of the dehydrogenation reaction, serves as the precursor for coke formation, with the initial coke being advantageous for the reaction but leading to a decrease in activity as the reaction progresses and the coke transforms into a more detrimental form.

本文研究了在工业型催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢反应时，使用拉曼光谱定量技术监测焦炭生成的可能性。作者比较了两种定量拉曼光谱的方法：一种使用内部标准（硼氮化物），另一种使用散射反射校正因子。他们得出结论，后一种方法具有明显的优势，包括能够定量评估反应过程中形成的焦炭量，这对于丙烷脱氢是有益的。作者指出，作为脱氢反应产物的丙烯是焦炭形成的前体，最初的焦炭对于反应是有利的，但随着反应的进行并转化为更具破坏性的形式，焦炭的数量会降低活性。
