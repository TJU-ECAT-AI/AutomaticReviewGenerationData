The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant onto the catalyst surface. 
2. Activation, where the reactant undergoes a chemical transformation to form an intermediate species. 
3. Surface reaction, where the intermediate species reacts with another reactant to form a product. 
4. Desorption, where the product is released from the catalyst surface. 

Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the debate continues about which of these steps is rate-limiting. The ongoing scientific interest in this mechanism stems from its fundamental importance in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes, especially those involving dehydrogenation reactions. The precise identification of the rate-limiting step can significantly impact the design and efficiency of catalysts, which are crucial for various industrial applications, including petrochemical processing and energy production.

The use of combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopic techniques in this research validates the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism by providing quantitative insights into the dynamic processes occurring during the dehydrogenation reaction. The close agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions supports the relevance of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism in describing the catalytic dehydrogenation process. This method offers a powerful tool for monitoring and controlling the performance of catalysts in real-time, enabling more efficient and sustainable industrial processes.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 活化，反应物在此经历化学转变形成中间物种。
3. 表面反应，在中间物种与另一反应物反应生成产物。
4. 脱附，产物从催化剂表面释放。

尽管自近一个世纪以来进行了广泛的研究，但关于这些步骤中哪个是决定性的仍然存在争议。对这一机制的持续科学兴趣源自其理解并优化催化过程的基本重要性，尤其是涉及到脱氢反应的过程。准确识别决定性的步骤可以显著影响催化剂的设计和效率，这对于各种工业应用至关重要，包括石油化学加工和能源生产。

结合原位拉曼/紫外可见近红外光谱技术在这项研究中的应用验证了Horiuti-Polanyi机制，通过提供动态过程中定量的洞察来描述脱氢反应。实验数据与理论预测之间的良好一致性支持了Horiuti-Polanyi机制在描述催化脱氢过程的相关性。这种方法提供了一个强大的工具实时监测和控制催化剂性能，使工业过程更加高效和可持续。
