          [1] "First-Principles Calculations of Propane Dehydrogenation over PtSn Catalysts"
          [2] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism has been widely accepted as the dominant pathway for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
          [3] "The mechanism comprises four main steps: adsorption of propane, dissociation of propane, migration of hydrogen atoms, and desorption of propylene."
          [4] "There is an ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting."
          [5] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its relevance to the optimization of industrial processes."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule through a chemical reaction with the catalyst, formation of an intermediate species, and desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is based on the specific conditions and catalyst properties. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to its complexity and the influence of various factors such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst.
