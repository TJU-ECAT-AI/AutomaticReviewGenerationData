Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the molecule through a chemical reaction with the catalyst.
3. Formation of an intermediate species.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is based on the specific conditions and catalyst properties. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to its complexity and the influence of various factors such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst. Understanding these factors can lead to improvements in catalyst design and efficiency, making the mechanism a crucial area of research.

答案：催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附。
2. 分子通过与催化剂的化学反应被激活。
3. 形成中间物种。
4. 产品分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争议，基于特定条件和催化剂性质。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的核心领域，原因在于其复杂性和各种因素的影响，如温度、压力和催化剂的性质。理解这些因素可以导致催化剂设计和效率的改进，使机制成为关键的研究领域。
