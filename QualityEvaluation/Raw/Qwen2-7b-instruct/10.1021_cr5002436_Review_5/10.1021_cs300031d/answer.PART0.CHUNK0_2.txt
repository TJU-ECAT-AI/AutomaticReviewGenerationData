<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, widely recognized as the primary pathway for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, consists of four fundamental stages: propane adsorption, propane dissociation, hydrogen atom migration, and propylene desorption. The specific step deemed rate-limiting is still subject to scholarly contention. This mechanism continues to attract scientific interest and debate, primarily because of its importance in refining industrial processes.
