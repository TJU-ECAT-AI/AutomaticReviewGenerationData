[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely accepted model."
[2] "It consists of four main steps: adsorption of the reactant on the catalyst surface, activation of the reactant, dehydrogenation, and desorption of the product."
[3] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is an active area of research."
[4] "This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the reaction process and the need for further understanding of the catalytic activity at the atomic level."

1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four primary stages: reactant adsorption onto the catalyst surface, reactant activation, dehydrogenation, and product desorption. The discussion over which of these steps is the rate-determining factor continues to be an area of active investigation. Despite almost a century of study, this mechanism remains a subject of scientific interest and contention due to the intricate nature of the reaction process and the necessity for deeper insight into the catalytic activity at the atomic scale.
