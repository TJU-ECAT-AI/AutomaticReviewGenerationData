Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the reactant on the catalyst surface, activation of the bond, reaction of the activated species, and desorption of the product. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the catalytic process and the influence of various factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it provides insights into the fundamental aspects of catalysis and can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for industrial applications.

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the molecule through a chemical reaction with the catalyst.
3. Formation of an intermediate species.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is based on the specific conditions and catalyst properties. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to its complexity and the influence of various factors such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst. Understanding these factors can lead to improvements in catalyst design and efficiency, making the mechanism a crucial area of research.
