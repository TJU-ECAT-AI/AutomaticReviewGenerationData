          [1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely accepted theory that describes the process of converting a hydrocarbon to an alkene."
          [2] "The mechanism involves four main steps: adsorption of the hydrocarbon onto the catalyst surface, activation of the hydrocarbon by breaking a hydrogen-hydrocarbon bond, dehydrogenation of the hydrocarbon, and desorption of the alkene from the catalyst surface."
          [3] "There is ongoing debate among scientists regarding which step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is considered rate-limiting."
          [4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely accepted theory that explains the conversion of hydrocarbons to alkenes through four main steps: adsorption, activation, dehydrogenation, and desorption. There is ongoing debate about which step is the rate-limiting one, and the mechanism continues to be a subject of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

          霍里图-波拉尼机制是催化脱氢反应的广泛接受理论，它通过四个主要步骤解释了将烃转化为烯烃的过程：吸附、活化、脱氢和脱附。关于哪个步骤是速率决定步骤的问题仍在科学界争论不休，尽管该机制已被研究近一个世纪，但它仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题。
