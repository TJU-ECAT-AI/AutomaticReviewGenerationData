          Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been employed to investigate the adsorption characteristics of propane and propene on Pt(111) and PtSn alloy surfaces. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four primary stages: activation, hydrogen transfer, dehydrogenation, and product release. The debate over which stage acts as the rate-determining step in this mechanism has persisted for almost a century. This mechanism continues to attract scientific interest due to its significance in elucidating the chemistry of dehydrogenation reactions and its practical implications in sectors like petrochemical processing.
