          [1] "Periodic Density Functional Theory Study of Propane Dehydrogenation over Perfect Ga2O3(100) Surface"
          [2] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism has been widely accepted as the fundamental reaction pathway for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
          [3] "It involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the molecule, (3) migration of the activated species across the surface, and (4) desorption of the product molecule."
          [4] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still open, with arguments supporting different steps depending on the specific conditions of the reaction."
          [5] "This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because understanding its dynamics can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction pathways."

          [1] "The periodic density functional theory (DFT) study was conducted on propane dehydrogenation over a perfect Ga2O3(100) surface."
          [2] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely accepted model for the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
          [3] "This mechanism consists of four main steps: adsorption of propane molecules, activation of hydrogen atoms, breaking of the C-H bonds, and desorption of propylene."
          [4] "The debate regarding the rate-limiting step is still ongoing among researchers."
          [5] "Some studies suggest that the activation of hydrogen atoms might be the rate-determining step, while others propose that the breaking of C-H bonds could be the limiting factor."
          [6] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its complexity and potential for improving the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, widely accepted for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, includes four primary stages: adsorption of propane molecules, activation of hydrogen atoms, breaking of C-H bonds, and desorption of propylene. The argument over which stage acts as the rate-limiting step continues among researchers. This mechanism remains of scientific interest and controversy due to its intricacy and potential for enhancing the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes, even after nearly a century of investigation.
