          INTRODUCTION
          Rationale Reactions of hydrocarbons on metal catalysts (e.g., Pt) are of importance in the chemical and petrochemical industries (e.g., (1, 2)).
          In the present paper, we address possible reaction intermediates involved in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum. This reaction has been studied by various authors (e.g.,(912)), and the literature related to this reaction forms a foundation for studies involving microcalorimetric, kinetic, and quantum chemical studies of C2 species on platinum.

[1] "The literature discusses the effect of tin content and reduction temperature on the catalytic behavior of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
          [2] "XPS results show that tin is in oxidized state when the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, whereas a proportion is in the metallic state after reduction at 773 K."
          [3] "The presence of Pt-Sn alloy in the catalysts after reduction at high temperature has been assessed by in situ IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, although a proportion of platinum remains in a non-alloyed state."
          [4] "The combined effects of the decoration of metallic particles by partially reduced titania and PtSn alloy formation are suggested as being the main factors of this behavior."
          [5] "It can be concluded that the addition of tin stabilize the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol, although there is no direct relationship between the selectivity and the amount of tin loading."

[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism has been widely studied for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
          [2] "It comprises four main steps: adsorption of the reactant, activation of the catalyst, decomposition of the reactant, and desorption of the product."
          [3] "The debate over the rate-limiting step is ongoing, with various researchers supporting different steps as the bottleneck in the reaction process."
          [4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to be a topic of scientific interest due to its relevance in understanding catalytic processes and potential for optimization in industrial applications."

[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps."
          [2] "These steps include adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule, breaking of bonds within the molecule, and desorption of the product molecule."
          [3] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the complexity of the reaction pathway and the interplay between the different steps."
          [4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy."

[1] "In a related study of the adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethene on a catalyst with smaller metal particles (\2 nm) Pt/Al2O3 between 140 K and ambient temperature, the same conclusions were drawn by Mohsin et al.70 for the di-r to ethylidyne conversion on [111] facets, but the second set of di-r* bands at 2922, 2830 and 1428 cm1 were not observed."
          [2] "In that case only a single complex and a single di-r p-C2H4 species absorbing at 3073/3018/2998/2955/1498 cm1"
          [3] "Moreover, the lower wavenumber transmission also allowed identification of the Al2O3 other coupled mode of the complex l(CxC)/d(CH2) p-C2H4 at 1203 cm1, and of the totally symmetrical l(CwC) mode at 1128 cm1 of ethylidyne."
          [4] "The continuing occurrence of the di-r* (or ethylylidine) complex on our catalyst at ambient temperature possibly reflects the presence of more and larger crystalline facets with sections of non-[111] morphology on the larger platinum particles."

          [6] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting has been a topic of scientific interest and controversy for nearly a century."
          [7] "Despite extensive study, the precise role and kinetics of each step remain subjects of debate among researchers."

[1] "The results of our kinetics studies show that the addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 suppresses the isomeriza- tion and hydrogenolysis of isobutane, and enhances the dehydrogenation selectivity."
          [2] "Mssbauer spectroscopy has shown that Pt and Sn form alloy clusters in L-zeolite, but the majority of the Sn is present as Sn2+."
          [3] "The addition of tin to silica-supported platinum reduces the initial heat of ethylene adsorption."
          [4] "Similar to the silica-supported system, the hydrogenol- ysis and isomerization reaction rates decrease with in- creasing tin content of the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts, and the isobutane conversion is limited over these Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts by the equilibrium conver- sion of isobutane to isobutene."
          [5] "The combined results of these studies suggest that tin reduces the size of the surface Pt ensembles on Pt/Sn alloy particles, suppresses the isomerization and hy- drogenolysis reactions, and enhances the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."
          [6] "Furthermore, it has been shown that the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 increases the isobutane dehydrogenation rate, enhances the dehydrogenation selectivity, and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation."
          [7] "It has been shown that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydrogenation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst deactivation."
          [8] "The properties of this highly selective dehydrogenation catalyst may be attributed to the stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the L-zeolite pore in the presence of potassium."

          INTRODUCTION
          Rationale Reactions of hydrocarbons on metal catalysts (e.g., Pt) are of importance in the chemical and petrochemical industries (e.g., (1, 2)).
          In the present paper, we address possible reaction intermediates involved in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum. This reaction has been studied by various authors (e.g.,(912)), and the literature related to this reaction forms a foundation for studies involving microcalorimetric, kinetic, and quantum chemical studies of C2 species on platinum.

[1] "The literature discusses the effect of tin content and reduction temperature on the catalytic behavior of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
          [2] "XPS results show that tin is in oxidized state when the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, whereas a proportion is in the metallic state after reduction at 773 K."
          [3] "The presence of Pt-Sn alloy in the catalysts after reduction at high temperature has been assessed by in situ IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, although a proportion of platinum remains in a non-alloyed state."
          [4] "The combined effects of the decoration of metallic particles by partially reduced titania and PtSn alloy formation are suggested as being the main factors of this behavior."
          [5] "It can be concluded that the addition of tin stabilize the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol, although there is no direct relationship between the selectivity and the amount of tin loading."

[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism has been widely studied for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
          [2] "It comprises four main steps: adsorption of the reactant, activation of the catalyst, decomposition of the reactant, and desorption of the product."
          [3] "The debate over the rate-limiting step is ongoing, with various researchers supporting different steps as the bottleneck in the reaction process."
          [4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to be a topic of scientific interest due to its relevance in understanding catalytic processes and potential for optimization in industrial applications."
