Adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface.  \n          2. Activation, where the hydrogen atoms are removed from the molecule, often through breaking of a C-C bond.  \n          3. Migration of the resulting fragment across the surface.  \n          4. Desorption of the product molecule from the surface.\n          \n          Regarding which step is considered rate-limiting, the debate centers around the activation step. Some researchers argue that the slowest step is the removal of hydrogen atoms from the molecule, while others propose that the migration step might be the bottleneck.

Despite decades of research, the exact rate-determining step remains a topic of ongoing discussion and investigation.\n          \n          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a theoretical framework for understanding catalytic processes, especially in the context of hydrocarbon conversion.

Adding tin to silica-supported platinum reduces the initial heat of ethylene adsorption. Similar to the silica-supported system, the hydrogenolysis and isomerization reaction rates decrease with increasing tin content in the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts, and the conversion of isobutane is limited by the equilibrium conversion of isobutane to isobutene.

The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts are characterized by high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydrogenation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst deactivation.
