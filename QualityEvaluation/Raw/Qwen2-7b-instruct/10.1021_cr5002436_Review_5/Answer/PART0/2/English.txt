The first step of cleaving the first hydrogen bond in propane is identified as the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. This mechanism comprises four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, breaking of the first hydrogen bond, formation of an intermediate species, and finally desorption of the product molecule. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms and the variability of conditions under which the reactions are studied. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the intricate nature of dehydrogenation reactions and the influence of various factors on their rates, despite nearly a century of study.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been employed to investigate the adsorption characteristics of propane and propene on Pt(111) and PtSn alloy surfaces. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four primary stages: activation, hydrogen transfer, dehydrogenation, and product release. The debate over which stage acts as the rate-determining step in this mechanism has persisted for almost a century. This mechanism continues to attract scientific interest due to its significance in elucidating the chemistry of dehydrogenation reactions and its practical implications in sectors like petrochemical processing.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
          1. Adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface.  
          2. Activation, where the hydrogen atoms are removed from the molecule, often through breaking of a C-C bond.  
          3. Migration of the resulting fragment across the surface.  
          4. Desorption of the product molecule from the surface.
          
          Regarding which step is considered rate-limiting, the debate centers around the activation step. Some researchers argue that the slowest step is the removal of hydrogen atoms from the molecule, while others propose that the migration step might be the bottleneck. The complexity arises due to the variety of pathways and the influence of reaction conditions. Despite decades of research, the exact rate-determining step remains a topic of ongoing discussion and investigation.
          
          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a theoretical framework for understanding catalytic processes, especially in the context of hydrocarbon conversion. It helps in predicting reaction rates, identifying potential intermediates, and designing more efficient catalysts. The mechanism's applicability varies depending on the specific conditions and the nature of the catalyst, making it a subject of continuous exploration and refinement.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four key steps: adsorption of the reactant, activation of the catalyst, decomposition of the reactant, and desorption of the product.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four primary stages.

The results from our kinetics studies demonstrate that adding tin to Pt/SiO2 catalysts suppresses the isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions of isobutane, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity. Mssbauer spectroscopy reveals that Pt and Sn form alloy clusters in L-zeolite, with the majority of Sn being present as Sn2+. Adding tin to silica-supported platinum reduces the initial heat of ethylene adsorption. Similar to the silica-supported system, the hydrogenolysis and isomerization reaction rates decrease with increasing tin content in the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts, and the conversion of isobutane is limited by the equilibrium conversion of isobutane to isobutene. These findings suggest that tin reduces the size of surface Pt ensembles on Pt/Sn alloy particles, inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, and enhancing the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. Furthermore, adding potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalysts increases the isobutane dehydrogenation rate, improves dehydrogenation selectivity, and boosts the catalyst's resistance to deactivation. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts are characterized by high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydrogenation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst deactivation. The stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the L-zeolite pore structure, facilitated by potassium, is believed to contribute to the catalyst's properties.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four key steps: adsorption of the reactant, activation of the catalyst, decomposition of the reactant, and desorption of the product. There is an ongoing debate regarding which of these steps is rate-limiting, with differing views among researchers. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of its importance in elucidating catalytic processes and its potential for improvement in industrial applications, even after nearly a century of investigation.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four primary stages. These stages involve the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, the activation of the molecule, the disruption of bonds within the molecule, and the desorption of the product molecule. The persistent dispute about which stage is rate-limiting arises from the intricacy of the reaction pathway and the interactions between the various stages. Despite almost a century of investigation, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to be a subject of scientific interest and debate.

The results from our kinetics studies demonstrate that adding tin to Pt/SiO2 catalysts suppresses the isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions of isobutane, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity. Mssbauer spectroscopy reveals that Pt and Sn form alloy clusters in L-zeolite, with the majority of Sn being present as Sn2+. Adding tin to silica-supported platinum reduces the initial heat of ethylene adsorption. Similar to the silica-supported system, the hydrogenolysis and isomerization reaction rates decrease with increasing tin content in the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts, and the conversion of isobutane is limited by the equilibrium conversion of isobutane to isobutene. These findings suggest that tin reduces the size of surface Pt ensembles on Pt/Sn alloy particles, inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, and enhancing the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. Furthermore, adding potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalysts increases the isobutane dehydrogenation rate, improves dehydrogenation selectivity, and boosts the catalyst's resistance to deactivation. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts are characterized by high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydrogenation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst deactivation. The stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the L-zeolite pore structure, facilitated by potassium, is believed to contribute to the catalyst's properties.

The first step of cleaving the first hydrogen bond in propane is identified as the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. This mechanism comprises four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, breaking of the first hydrogen bond, formation of an intermediate species, and finally desorption of the product molecule. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms and the variability of conditions under which the reactions are studied. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the intricate nature of dehydrogenation reactions and the influence of various factors on their rates, despite nearly a century of study.
