Between 129 and 189 K, the spectra of the chemisorbed species were attributed to the presence of two closely related p- adsorbed ethene species with absorptions at 3022(medium)/1500(medium) and 3016(medium to weak)/1496(medium to weak) cm1, respectively; and to another pair of adsorbed species (M \ metal atom), designated di-r* and di-r, respectively, with absorptions at 2922(medium to strong)/2830(weak)/ca. 1428(medium to strong, broad) and 2906(medium to strong)/ ca. 2820/ca. 1419(medium to strong, broad) cm1. A strong shoulder to the 2922/2906 cm1 di-r*/di-r absorptions at ca. 2958 cm1 is tentatively attributed to another mode of the p-adsorbed species. A less-preferred alternative would be to an ethyl group. A shoulder to the di-r*/di-r absorptions at ca. 2958 cm1 is tentatively attributed to another mode of the p- l(CH2)-s adsorbed species. A less preferred assignment of this band would be to an ethyl surface group, which is l(CH3)-as formed from adsorbed ethene and hydrogen retained by the catalyst.
