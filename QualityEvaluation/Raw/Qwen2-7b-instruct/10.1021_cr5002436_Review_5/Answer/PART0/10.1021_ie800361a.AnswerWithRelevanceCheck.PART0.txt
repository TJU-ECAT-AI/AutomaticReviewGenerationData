          [1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts."
          [2] "For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are:"
          [3] "(1) Dissociative adsorption of ethane"
          [4] "(2) Adsorption of ethane"
          [5] "(3) Dehydrogenation of ethane"
          [6] "(4) Desorption of ethene"
          [7] "There is no agreement on the degree of dehydrogenation of the C2Hx surface species that are important in the CC bond scission."
          [8] "It has further been reported that the number of hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed C2Hx in which CC bond cleaves may differ from one surface to another."
          [9] "Interestingly, Cortright et al. (31) studied ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt by a combination of reaction kinetics, microcalorimetry, and spectroscopic and quantum chemical studies and concluded that the primary reaction pathways for cleavage of the CC bond take place through less stable ethyl (C2H5) and ethylidene (CHCH3) species not generally observed by spectroscopic methods, while the more abundant surface species usually observed during ethene adsorption (e.g., ethylidyne and di-σ-bonded ethene) are not directly involved in the primary reaction pathways, but affect the observed kinetic rates through blocking of sites."
          [10] "Alternative i seems not very likely since the reaction Gibbs energy (ΔrG) of Pt + O2  PtO2 is 163 kJ/mol at 623 C (calculated using thermodynamical data from ref 39), meaning that O2 pressures in the order of 105 bar are necessary to have a significant fraction of Pt in an oxidized state."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a foundational framework used to explain the dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. It comprises four key steps: dissociative adsorption of the alkane, followed by dehydrogenation, hydrogenation of the resulting alkene, and finally, desorption of the product. While there is general agreement on the overall mechanism, the specifics of the rate-limiting step are a subject of debate. The precise degree of dehydrogenation of C2Hx surface species, crucial for cleaving the CC bond, varies across different surfaces and lacks universal consensus. Moreover, the number of hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed C2Hx molecule that participate in CC bond cleavage can differ from one surface to another. Cortright et al.'s study (31) using a combination of reaction kinetics, calorimetry, spectroscopy, and quantum chemical methods revealed that the primary reaction pathways for CC bond cleavage occur through less stable ethyl (C2H5) and ethylidene (CHCH3) species, not typically observed by spectroscopic techniques. More prevalent surface species, such as ethylidyne and di-σ-bonded ethene, do not directly participate in the primary reaction pathways but impact the observed kinetic rates by blocking active sites. An alternative scenario involving the oxidation of platinum (Pt + O2 → PtO2) at 623°C requires oxygen pressures in the order of 105 bar to achieve a significant fraction of platinum in an oxidized state, suggesting that alternative mechanisms might exist under certain conditions.

          霍里图-波兰尼机制是用于描述在金属催化剂上烷烃脱氢和烯烃氢化的基础框架。该机制通常包含四个关键步骤：烷烃的离解吸附，随后的脱氢，烯烃的氢化，最后是产物的脱附。尽管对于机制的整体结构存在共识，但决定性步骤的具体细节仍然是争论的焦点。对于在CC键断裂中起关键作用的C2Hx表面物种的脱氢程度，因表面不同而异，并且缺乏普遍认可。此外，参与CC键断裂的吸附C2Hx分子中的氢原子数量在不同的表面上可能会有所不同。Cortright等人（31）通过结合反应动力学、热容量测量、光谱学和量子化学方法的研究发现，CC键断裂的主要反应途径发生在通常无法通过光谱技术观察到的较不稳定的乙基（C2H5）和乙基二烯（CHCH3）物种中。更常见的表面物种，如乙基炔和双-σ-键连乙烯，虽然它们不是直接参与主要反应途径，但通过阻塞活性位点影响了观察到的动力学速率。关于在623°C条件下，铂（Pt + O2 → PtO2）氧化需要氧压在105 bar左右才能达到一定比例的铂处于氧化状态的情况，这暗示在特定条件下可能存在其他机制。
