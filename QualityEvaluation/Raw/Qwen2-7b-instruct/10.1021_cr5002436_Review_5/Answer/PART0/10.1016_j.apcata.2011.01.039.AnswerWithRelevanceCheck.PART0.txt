          [1] "Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 are proposed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments."
          [2] "When taking into consideration the fitting accuracy, the number of fitting parameters and the rigor of the reaction mechanism, the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation based on the assumptions of step-wise dehydrogenation, the first step dehydrogenation as the rate-determining step, and low surface coverage of C3H7 outperforms other kinetic models."
          [3] "The change of catalyst activity with time-on-stream is related to the rate of coke formation that depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen."
          [4] "Finally a complete kinetic model, which includes propane dehydrogenation and cracking and catalyst deactivation because of coking, is developed, which is found to agree well with the changes of propane conversions with time-on-stream under different operating conditions."
          [5] "The first CH cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step."
          [6] "The underline reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the kinetic model agrees with experiments and quantum chemistry calculations."
          [7] "The model describes well the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, which is related to the rate of coke formation and takes into consideration the facts that propene promotes while hydrogen depresses coke formation, is proposed."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is described, consisting of four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation, reaction, and desorption. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting involves the first step of adsorption and the fourth step of desorption. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the fundamental aspects of catalytic reactions, helps in the design and optimization of catalytic processes, and understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for improving catalyst efficiency and stability. The mechanism is supported by experimental evidence and quantum chemistry calculations, and the model developed in the study accurately predicts the behavior of the dehydrogenation process under different operating conditions.

          [2] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions describes four main steps: the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, followed by the breaking of the first hydrogen bond, the formation of an intermediate species, and finally the desorption of the product molecule."
          [3] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting continues due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms and the varying conditions under which the reactions are studied."
          [4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the intricate nature of dehydrogenation reactions and the influence of various factors on their rates."

          The first step of cleaving the first hydrogen bond in propane is identified as the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. This mechanism comprises four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, breaking of the first hydrogen bond, formation of an intermediate species, and finally desorption of the product molecule. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms and the variability of conditions under which the reactions are studied.

          在催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制中，第一个氢键的断裂被确认为决定速率的步骤。该机制包含四个主要步骤：反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附、第一个氢键的断裂、中间物种的形成，以及最终产物分子的脱附。关于哪个步骤是决定速率的步骤的持续争议，归因于反应机制的复杂性和研究条件的多样性。尽管已经进行了一个多世纪的研究，但由于脱氢反应的复杂性和多种因素对它们速率的影响，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。
