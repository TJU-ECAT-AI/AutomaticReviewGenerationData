          [1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps."
          [2] "These steps are: (1) adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the substrate through interaction with the catalyst, (3) dehydrogenation or cleavage of the substrate, and (4) desorption of the product from the catalyst surface."
          [3] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy."
          [4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the precise role of each step in the mechanism remains unclear."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps: adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface, activation of the substrate through interaction with the catalyst, dehydrogenation or cleavage of the substrate, and desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The debate about which of these steps is rate-limiting continues to be a subject of scientific interest and controversy, even after almost a century of investigation. The exact role of each step in the mechanism is still uncertain.

          催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：底物吸附到催化剂表面，通过与催化剂相互作用激活底物，底物脱氢或断裂，以及产物从催化剂表面脱附。关于哪个步骤是速率限制性的争论仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，即使经过近一个世纪的研究。机制中每个步骤的确切作用仍然不确定。
