          [1] "In this work, which extends our earlier studies,8,9 we report in situ IR spectroscopic measurements of the adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethene on a silica-supported platinum catalyst under dynamic conditions of warming from 100 K to ambient temperature."
          [2] "It is deduced that the di-r species also occurs on facets of this type on the metal particles."
          [3] "The di-r to ethylidyne process occurs on triangular sites of [111]-like facets."
          [4] "Clearly more experimental work is necessary to identify reliably the surface species that gives rise to the 2958 cm1 feature, but at this stage we prefer the hypothesis that it represents a second absorption of the p-complex."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is ongoing. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The mechanism includes:
          1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
          2. Activation of the molecule, often involving breaking of a bond.
          3. Formation of an intermediate species.
          4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface.

          催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。关于哪个步骤是决定性的，争论仍然存在。尽管已经研究了一个多世纪，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。机制包括：
          1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附。
          2. 分子的活化，通常涉及键的断裂。
          3. 形成中间物种。
          4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附。

          [1] "In a related study of the adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethene on a catalyst with smaller metal particles (\2 nm) Pt/Al2O3 between 140 K and ambient temperature, the same conclusions were drawn by Mohsin et al.70 for the di-r to ethylidyne conversion on [111] facets, but the second set of di-r* bands at 2922, 2830 and 1428 cm1 were not observed."
          [2] "In that case only a single complex and a single di-r p-C2H4 species absorbing at 3073/3018/2998/2955/1498 cm1"
          [3] "Moreover, the lower wavenumber transmission also allowed identification of the Al2O3 other coupled mode of the complex l(CxC)/d(CH2) p-C2H4 at 1203 cm1, and of the totally symmetrical l(CwC) mode at 1128 cm1 of ethylidyne."
          [4] "The continuing occurrence of the di-r* (or ethylylidine) complex on our catalyst at ambient temperature possibly reflects the presence of more and larger crystalline facets with sections of non-[111] morphology on the larger platinum particles."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
          1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
          2. Activation of the molecule through breaking of bonds and formation of an intermediate species.
          3. Formation of the product molecule from the activated species.
          4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.
          The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often focuses on the activation step, as it requires significant energy input and thus affects the overall reaction rate. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the catalytic process, the influence of various reaction conditions, and the intricate interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and products.

          催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：
          1. 反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
          2. 分子通过断裂键和形成中间物种而被激活。
          3. 从激活物种形成产物分子。
          4. 产物分子从催化剂表面脱附。
          关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论通常集中在激活步骤上，因为它需要大量的能量输入，从而影响整个反应速率。尽管该机制在近一个世纪的研究中仍然是科学界关注和争议的焦点，原因在于催化过程的复杂性、各种反应条件的影响以及催化剂、反应物和产物之间的复杂相互作用。

          [1] "Between 129 and 189 K, the spectra of the chemisorbed species were attributed to the presence of two closely related p- adsorbed ethene species with absorptions at 3022(medium)/1500(medium) and 3016(medium to weak)/1496(medium to weak) cm1, respectively; and to another pair of adsorbed species (M \ metal atom), designated di-r* and di-r, respec- MCH2CH2M

          [4] "Adsorption of residual CO in the vacuum line caused strong negative absorptions at ca. 2087 cm1 and the much weaker positive absorptions at ca. 2060, 2040, 1880 and 1840 cm1 that appear in the dierence spectrum of Fig. 2 were brought about by adsorption of residual CO in the vacuum line."
