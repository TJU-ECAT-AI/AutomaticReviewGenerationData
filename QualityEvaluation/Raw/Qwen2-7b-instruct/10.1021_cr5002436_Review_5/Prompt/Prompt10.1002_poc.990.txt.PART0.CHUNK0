ABSTRACT: Models of Cr(III)silica were used to study CH activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a
possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation. This mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) was located on the seam between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). Subsequent to the change of spin state, the CH activation path passes through a transition state on the doublet potential surface, leading to the formation of an ethylhydridochromium(V) complex. This complex represents only a shallow minimum on the potential energy surface and -hydrogen transfer to complete the catalytic cycle must therefore take place in the extension of the CH activation step. The combination of a significant activation energy and a small pre-exponential factor in the rate constant makes CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system.

INTRODUCTION
A proven catalyst for the dehydrogenation of short alkanes, Croxide systems have been a topic of research since
1933.1 This effort has provided significant insight through
a variety of experimental designs.2 The dominant view in the modern literature is that chromium(III) is the oxidation state showing the highest activity for dehydrogenation,possibly with minor contributions from the II state.38 In situ diffuse-reflectance UVvisible spectroscopy (DRS) has been used to establish a semi-quantitative relationship between the number of pseudo-octahedral Cr(III) sites on mixed aluminasilica supports and dehydrogenation activ- ity.3 Combined reactivity and characterization studies of Crsilica4,9 led DeRossi et al.4 to propose the catalytically active chromium species to be bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges and with hydroxyl as the third ligand,cf. Fig. 1.4 From its spectroscopic signature, this species was dubbed CrIIIG.
Owing to the complexity of the catalyst surface, much about the active site and the reaction mechanism is still unknown. One crucial question concerns the mechanism of CH activation, for which the focus has been on activation through direct interaction with chromium.10 The mechanistic information available is scarce. An attractive strategy is therefore to consider, systematically,the different CH activation mechanisms known from organometallic chemistry. The two most relevant ones are oxidative and electrophilic addition.11 Electrophilic addition is also known as -bond metathesis,12 since metalligand and CH bonds are replaced by metal carbon and ligandhydrogen bonds. Conversely, in oxidative addition of ethane, carbon and hydrogen bind directly to the metal as the CH bond is broken. This involves a formal oxidation of the metal and a change of spin state. Owing to spinorbit coupling, the reaction may proceed on a single adiabatic potential energy surface corresponding to the full electronic Hamiltonian.
A reaction scheme involving spin flip in the course of the reaction is known as two-state reactivity (TSR).13 The role of TSR in CH activation and other transition metal-catalysed reactions, has recently been reviewed.14 In general, -bond metathesis is favoured on light,electron-deficient metals, whereas oxidative addition is favoured on the heavy and electron-rich late transition metals.1518 There are exceptions to this rule,12,19,20 and although chromium is a first-row transition metal, oxida- tive addition cannot be ruled out a priori. For instance,oxidative addition has been found feasible on O Cr

However, the computed activation energy exceeds 200 kJ mol1 and seems prohibitively high for catalytic activity. Significantly lower activation energy was found for an alternative mechanism in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium surface species.
The importance of the latter mechanism relies on the ability of the chromium site to stabilize the hydride, which is reactive with respect to formation of a CrO bond in the vicinity of hydroxyl species. Alternative routes to CH activation should therefore be explored.
Here, we investigated whether CH activation by oxidative addition may represent a viable route to alkane dehydrogenation. As in Ref. 23, we studied the Crsilica model catalyst, taking the CrIIIG structure in Fig. 1 as our starting point and exploring the more general, conceptual model of mononuclear Cr(III) complexes with three covalent ligands coordinating through oxygen. The im- portance of the choice of oxide carrier for the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction is the subject of a forthcoming publication [25].
COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
Models and methods The surface models used in the current study are detailed in Ref. 23. Cluster models were constructed either in an ad hoc manner, drawing on chemical intuition and experimental facts or systematically, starting from low- index surfaces of silica crystals.
The ad hoc models include a generic model of the CrIIIG species as proposed by DeRossi et al.4 The silica surface is represented by a disiloxy ether moiety and the model is denoted by gen-2bridge, cf. Fig. 2(A). To model a site completely void of surface constraints yet having a first coordination sphere similar to that of the CrIIIG species, the Cr(OH)3 molecule is used, Fig. 2(B).
Improved models taking into account larger parts of the amorphous oxide carrier have been generated from low-index surfaces of the high-T modifications of silica,- and -cristobalite.23 On each surface, a cluster region was defined that includes chromium and its local chemi- cal environment, with boundary bonds OclusterSihost severed and terminated by hydrogen atoms. In this work, the models have been applied only as isolated clusters, cf. the (100)-2bridge, (111)-3bridge and (101)- 3bridge models in Fig. 2(C), (D) and (E), respectively.
Mimicking the restoring forces of the extended struc- tures, atoms at the cluster boundaries have their positions fixed to those of the parent slab model. In the two-bridge models, this implies frozen position for all atoms but those of the (O)2CrOH moiety. In the three-bridge models, the terminating Si(OH)n groups were held in fixed positions.
Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations were per- formed using density functional theory as implemented in the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) set of programs.2628 For electron correlation the LDA func- tional of Vosko et al.29 augmented by the non-local 1986 corrections by Perdew30 were used. The exchange func- tional consists of the Slater term augmented by gradient corrections as specified by Becke.31 For details of basis sets and geometry optimisation, see Ref. 23.
In general, energy differences refer to electronic de- grees of freedom only, i.e. without zero-point vibrational energies or temperature effects. In order to take into account temperature and entropy effects, the full set of thermodynamic functions were computed in the harmo- nic and rigid-rotor approximation for simulations based on the gen-2bridge surface model. The numerical inte- gration schemes were used with the tightest accuracy request available. All stationary structures display an ultra-soft vibrational mode which consistently has been omitted from the harmonic analysis.
Minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) between spin potential energy surfaces were optimized using ADF, in Figure 1.

conjunction with the code developed by Harvey and co- workers.32,33 A set of shell scripts and Fortran programs were used to extract energies and gradients for the two spin states and to combine these to produce an effective gradient pointing toward the MECP and used to update the geome- try. The convergence criteria are energy difference <0.1 mhartree and a gradient at the seam of crossing within the normal ADF convergence criterion. Subsequent frequency analysis used the effective Hessian32 along the hyperline of equal energy of the two potential energy surfaces. The unix scripts and Fortran programs were adapted to ADF in the course of this work.Accuracy To compare the one- and two-state mechanisms of dehy- drogenation, initiated by -bond metathesis and oxidative addition, respectively, the accuracy of the applied density functional method should be considered, in particular with respect to the relative stability of the two spin states involved in the oxidative addition. Relative energies com- puted on a single potential surface are generally in agree- ment with more sophisticated methods,3437 whereas prediction of relative energies on different potential sur- faces is more problematic.38,39 Poli and Harvey38 reported that pure density functionals such as BP86 tend to exaggerate the stability of low-spin forms, whereas hybrid functionals such as B3LYP may overestimate the stability of high-spin species. Accordingly, in a study of the Cr OH bond dissociation energy (BDE) in oxohydroxylchro- mium complexes with oxidation states IVI, the pure BPW91 and hybrid B3LYP functionals reproduced the general trend of more sophisticated methods, but over- and underestimated, respectively, the BDE at higher oxida- tion states.40 Moreover, BPW91 systematically but mod- estly overestimated the stability of doublet states relative to quartet states in the insertion reaction of ethene in [H(NH3)CrIIIMe].41 BP86 as applied here might therefore be expected to underestimate the activation energy for the two-state mechanism involving oxidative addition re- lative to that of the one-state mechanism involving -bond metathesis. An indication of this was obtained using the Gaussian set of programs42 to compute the quartet/doublet energy difference of the Cr(OH)3 model. In line with the pattern described above, B3LYP puts the low-spin doublet 116 kJ mol1 above the high-spin quartet, while a differ- ence of 75 kJ mol1 was obtained using BP86 in both ADF and Gaussian. At any rate, differences <20 kJ mol1 in relative energies computed for different reaction paths are considered to be within the error bars of the method.
RESULTS
We start out by exploring CH activation by oxidative addition, followed by constructing a complete mechanism of dehydrogenation. For convenience, each chromium site is referred to by the ligands in the first coordination sphere of the metal. For instance, a general DeRossi-type site may be denoted by (O)2CrOH, where O represents a generic oxygen ligand singly bonded to chromium.
CH activation Ethane is found not to form any molecular complex with chromium on DeRossi-type Cr(III) sites.23 This implies that the initial encounter is reactive rather than physi- sorptive. The reaction path of oxidative addition (OA) is first presented as computed for the gen-2bridge cluster model [Fig. 2(A)]. In the unreacted cluster the coordina- tion geometry of chromium is trigonal planar. The ground state has quartet spin multiplicity, the doublet being higher in energy by 75 kJ mol1. A schematic representa- tion of the electronic energy profile of CH activation by oxidative addition is presented in Fig. 3, together with geometries of important stationary structures. As ethane approaches chromium, one of the CH bonds stretches and the energy increases on both spin surfaces. The gradient is larger on the quartet surface and the first step towards OA is thus crossing from the quartet to the doublet potential energy surface at an MECP. The MECP Figure 3.

was located at an activated CH bond length of rCH  1.36 A and with the active hydrogen atom starting to displace a bridging oxygen from the equatorial plane toward an axial position in the trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry, cf. Fig. 3.
Frequency analysis at the MECP gives an imaginary frequency in excess of 900i cm1 corresponding to the reaction coordinate orthogonal to the seam of crossing.
After removal of this component, an imaginary frequency of about 5i cm1 remains, probably due to numerical noise. At the MECP, the spin density on chromium drops from 2.8 in the quartet to 1.1 in the doublet state. The electronic effects of spin change are localized to chro- mium, leaving all Mulliken atomic charges essentially unaffected.
Past the MECP and now on the doublet potential surface, the CH bond continues to lengthen while the energy increases slowly, until a transition state (TS) is reached at rCH  1.56 A , cf. Fig. 3. The CrH distance remains essentially constant from the MECP through the transition state and to the product complex. The coordi- nation geometry of the resulting ethylhydridochro- mium(V) complex may be described as a pseudo- trigonal bipyramid, although the widest angle is only
140. Together with the fact that the energy changes only
slightly after the MECP (see Table 1), the geometry changes just described are consistent with a late transition state. Most of the CH activation and all of the CrH bond formation takes place in the quartet state. Past the MECP, the energy cost of completing the rupture of the CH bond seems to be compensated for by the formation of the CCr bond.
At 500 C, the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of CH activation are computed as 162 and 283 kJ mol1,respectively (cf. Table 1). The large contribution from entropy is due to the loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom when reducing the molecularity. The change in electronic energy agrees well with that of the enthalpy.
The corresponding reactions on the Cr(OH)3 and (100)-2bridge models proceed essentially as described for the gen-2bridge model, with an reaction energy profile parallel to and some 10 kJ mol1 below that found earlier (see Table 1). The three-bridge models are more rigid owing to the additional CrO ester linkage to the support and as a consequence, their potential energy surfaces do not possess local minima corresponding to any ethylhydridochromium(V) complexes. Hence oxidative addition of ethane is not likely to take place at such sites. This is further elaborated in the Discussion section. b-Hydrogen transfer Even for the two-bridge models, the primary products of CH activation are unstable with respect to the reverse reaction of reductive elimination. According to Table 1,for the gen-2bridge model the electronic energy barrier of reductive elimination is a mere 5 kJ mol1 and the enthalpic barrier actually vanishes. Completion of a dehydrogenation cycle therefore requires an immediate second reaction step. We have considered three candi- dates for this second step, all of which include removal of a -hydrogen (H) from the ethyl ligand: transfer of H to the metal itself, transfer to an oxygen atom bonded to the metal or transfer to the hydrogen atom ligated to the metal. -Hydrogen transfer to chromium results in a dihydri- dochromium(V) surface complex and the release of ethene to the gas phase. The reaction is computed to be highly endothermic (94 kJ mol1) and does not appear a viable alternative. The electronic energy is computed to be 255 kJ mol1 above that of the separated cluster and ethane.
Transfer of a -hydrogen to the hydroxyl ligand of the gen-2bridge model to form water passes over an energy barrier at 134 kJ mol1 above that of the reactant ethyl- chromium complex. We will see that the third alternative,-hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand, to form H2 and a di--bonded ethenechromium(V) complex, provides an easier route.
The primary product of the CH activation step and hence the reactant of the present reaction step displays ethyl and hydrido ligands in axial and equatorial posi- tions, respectively, in a pseudo-TBP structure. The ffHCrC angle is narrow and H may approach the hydrido ligand only if the ethyl moiety is twisted to one side, to make the CC bond become almost orthogonal to the Crhydrido bond. Although such a structure allows for close HH contact, the carbonchromium distance remains too long for bond formation between the -carbon and chromium. This picture has emerged from numerous attempts to obtain a reaction path using relaxed linear transit (LT) models as well as relaxed two-dimen- sional scans of the potential energy surface with respect to the CCr and Hhydrido distances. Simulta- neously scanning both of these critical distances, at r(HH) and r(CCr) distances around 1.2 and
2.2 A
, respectively, the complex undergoes a stereoche- mical rearrangement which leads both ethyl and hydrido Table 1.

ligands to occupy equatorial positions. The ffHCrC angle opens up from 63 in the reactant (see below) to 130.
Prior to the rearrangement, the electronic energy exceeds 140 kJ mol1 relative to the reactant ethylhy- drido complex and 300 kJ mol1 relative to the asymptote of the unreacted cluster and ethane. This is even more than the energy of the transition state of hydrogen transfer to the hydroxyl ligand. However, attempts to optimise a transition state for hydrogen transfer in this region have all failed, suggesting that the minimal energy path does not pass this way. Indeed, a route of notably lower energy was obtained as a two-segment reaction path, in which the steric rearrangement just described is a first and close- to-energy-neutral part, followed by the actual -hydrogen transfer to the hydride.
In the early stage of the rearrangement, the reaction coordinate is dominated by dihedral angles (SiOCrL, L  OH, H and Et). Approaching the transition state,the reaction coordinate becomes mainly the ffHCrC bond angle, which increases until the product configura- tion is reached (cf. Fig. 4). The reaction path does not comply with a Berry pseudo-rotation and the energy barrier is also higher than is commonly found for Berry transformations. According to Table 2, the activation enthalpy and free energy at the transition state of the stereochemical rearrangement amount to 220 and 347 kJ mol1, respectively, relative to the asymptote of separated cluster and ethane. The activation enthalpy of this reaction step (see below) is computed to 56 kJ mol1.
The most stable ethylhydridochromium complex dis- plays the ethyl ligand in a staggered configuration. The eclipsed conformation shown in Fig. 4 lies only 20 kJ mol1 higher in enthalpy. This structure accom- modates a -agostic interaction which makes it a natural starting point for the -hydrogen transfer step.
Assisted by the agostic interaction, a -hydrogen of the ethyl group may transfer to the hydrido ligand to form gaseous H2 and a chromium(V)cyclopropane surface complex in which ethylene is di- bonded to chromium.
According to Table 2, the enthalpy and free energy at the transition state are 184 and 298 kJ mol1, respectively,relative to the asymptote of separated cluster and ethane.
The activation enthalpy for the reaction, relative to the preceding non-agostic ethylhydrido complex,is 38 kJ mol1. The energy at the transition state of - hydrogen transfer is therefore 40 kJ mol1 lower than at the transition state of the preceding stereochemical rearrangement.
Dehydrogenation The catalytic site may be regenerated by desorbing ethene from the chromium(V)cyclopropane complex,thus completing the catalytic cycle. A complete mechan- ism of dehydrogenation is presented in Fig. 5 in terms of optimized stationary structures for the gen-2bridge model. The corresponding reaction enthalpy and free energy profiles are plotted in Fig. 6, with thermodynamic parameters for each of the elementary reaction steps given in Tables 1 and 2.
The four reaction steps shown in Fig. 5 include CH activation (1), stereochemical rearrangement (2), -hy- drogen transfer (3) and ethene desorption (4). The deso- rption step involves spin flip at chromium to transform the di--bonded ethenechromium complex into a quar- tet (O)2CrOH species with a -bonded ethene. The crossing point (MECP) of the reaction path from the doublet to the quartet potential energy surface has been determined at an average CrC bond length of 2.20 A
and a CC distance of 1.39 A . These values are much closer to the geometry of the di--bonded complex than that of the -bonded ethene complex and the energy of the MECP is also very similar to the former.
The coordination enthalpy of the resulting ethene -complex is only 33 kJ mol1, consistent with an almost unperturbed CC bond length in ethene of 1.35 A . Des- orption of ethene is therefore favoured by entropy, resulting in a free energy change of 68 kJ mol1 at 500 C.

From Fig. 6, the transition state of the stereochemical rearrangement step may be identified as the highest point on both the enthalpy and the free-energy reaction profiles for the overall dehydrogenation reaction.
The same mechanism of dehydrogenation has been examined for the (100)-2bridge and Cr(OH)3 models.
The electronic energies for all important stationary states are given in Table 3. The reaction energy profiles obtained for the (100)-2bridge and Cr(OH)3 models are similar to that obtained for the gen-2bridge model. On all three models, the favoured route to -hydrogen transfer was found to include stereochemical rearrangement. The electronic energies at the corresponding transition states are about 220 kJ mol1 for the 2bridge models, with a lower energy of 196 kJ mol1 for Cr(OH)3. This suggests that surface restraints contribute 20 kJ mol1 to the reaction barrier. Only for the -hydrogen transfer reac- tion is the barrier markedly higher for the (100)-2bridge than for the gen-2bridge model (see Fig. 7). This is probably a result of poor -agostic interaction with chromium,owing to the wider angle defined by the bridging oxygens and chromium. For both the Figure 5.

(100)-2bridge model and Cr(OH)3, the transition states of the stereochemical rearrangement and the -hydrogen transfer step are equally high in electronic energy. Ac- cording to Table 2, the entropy loss is larger in the first of these two elementary reactions and this makes the stereo- chemical rearrangement the bottleneck of the overall dehydrogenation reaction for all the three DeRossi-type models examined.
DISCUSSION
The three-bridge models do not seem to offer any stable ethylhydridochromium(V) complexes, hence oxidative addition of ethane is not likely to take place at such sites.
On the other hand, the models have previously been found to support CH activation by -bond metathesis.
This involves cleavage of a CrO bond and formation of a chromiumethyl bond and a silanol moiety. A mechan- ism of dehydrogenation based on such a reaction was proposed in the literature2,24 and studied theoretically in Ref. 23. In addition to the CH activation step, it involves formation of ethene through -hydrogen transfer to chromium,giving a hydridochromium complex and release of H2 under reformation of the CrO bond. Strain in the (111)-3bridge model resulted in a low CH activation energy of 80 kJ mol1, but also makes closure of the catalytic cycle a highly unlikely event. On the nearly unstrained (101)-3bridge model the CH activation energy increased to 160 kJ mol1, but now the dehydrogenation cycle appeared viable. -Hy- drogen transfer turns out to be the rate-determining step with the enthalpy and free energy of activation estimated as 240 and 350 kJ mol1, respectively, These values seem too high to sustain catalysis at 500 C.23 Based on the present computations, CH activation by oxidative addition appears possible on DeRossi-type species, i.e. on CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges. The activation energy computed for this initial step is 160 kJ mol1. However, since the ethylhydridochromium complex is unstable with respect to reductive elimination, the subsequent step towards dehydrogenation must proceed immediately. The bottle- neck of CH activation by oxidative addition is there- fore better represented by the transition state of the stereochemical rearrangement. Furthermore, as the free energy at this point represents the highest point along the reaction path of dehydrogenation, CH activation emerges as rate determining in the dehydrogenation process. The computed enthalpy and free energy of activation are 220 and 347 kJ mol1, respectively.
The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is therefore fairly high and on a level with that of the -bond metathesis reaction on unstrained three-bridge species. In addition, the reac- tion depends on two crossings between spin potential surfaces. For reactions of FeO , spin cross-over prob- abilities as low as 102103 have been obtained,43 and even if the probability for a transition metal-mediated two-state reaction may be significantly increased by the exact makeup of the complex,44 the actual probability of the present reaction is likely to be notably lower than unity. More importantly, the rotational segment of C H activation, i.e. the stereochemical rearrangement step, puts severe constraints on the angular momentum of the reacting alkane molecule. The steric factor in the reaction cross-section is therefore likely to be small,further reducing the pre-exponential factor in the rate constant.

ligand, gives water which is likely to desorb.23 Reformation of the DeRossi site under release of H2, as described above, is therefore unlikely. However, the surface site is stabilized as an ethylchromium complex and this species supports catalytic dehydrogenation through cyclic repeti- tion of (i) -hydrogen transfer to give a hydridochromium complex and (ii) CH activation and H2 release by - bond metathesis.23 The computed activation energy for this mechanism of dehydrogenation is <100kJ mol1,with respect to the combined energy of the hydridochro- mium complex and gaseous ethane.23 Moreover, the activation energy associated with forming the initial ethyl- chromium complex was computed as 130 kJ mol1,23 which is significantly lower than that computed here for the CH activation step according to oxidative addition.
CONCLUSIONS
Quantum chemical cluster models of Cr(III)silica sites have been used to study CH activation of ethane by oxidative addition. The reaction involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and whereas most of the actual activation of the CH bond takes place on the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III), the transition state and the ethylhydridochromium(V) product are lo- cated on the doublet energy surface. The product is unstable with respect to the back-reaction and completion of a dehydrogenation cycle requires that -hydrogen transfer must take place in the extension of the CH activation step. On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through two oxygen bridges, the preferred mode of -hydrogen transfer is via a stereochemical rearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) com- plex, followed by hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand with release of H2. This leaves the complex as chro- mium(V)cyclopropane.
On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through three oxygen bridges, we have not been able to optimize any ethylhydridochromium(V) structure and CH activation according to oxidative addition seems to be excluded.
The reactant two-bridge (DeRossi) site may be regen- erated from chromium(V)cyclopropane by desorption of ethene. This concludes a catalytic cycle for dehydrogena- tion, involving the following reaction steps: (i) oxidative addition of ethane followed by immediate stereochemical rearrangement, (ii) -hydrogen transfer to hydride with subsequent loss of H2 and (iii) reductive elimination of ethene from chromium(V)cyclopropane. The kinetic bottleneck of this reaction mechanism is given by the first step, which is associated with CH activation but more precisely with the transition state of the rearrange- ment step. The computed enthalpy and free energy of activation are high, ca 220 and 350 kJ mol1, respec- tively, and close to the activation energies previously computed for a different mechanism of CH activation,namely -bond metathesis, on specific three-bridge chromium sites.23 Both of these seem inferior to a third mechanism of dehydrogenation, which involves CH activation by -bond metathesis on a hydridochro- mium(III) species. The computed activation energy of the latter mechanism is <100 kJ mol1,23 and the two- bridge models investigated here may act as precursors to this more active species. CH activation by oxidative addition thus seems to be an unlikely route to catalytic dehydrogenation for Cr(III)silica catalysts.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.
