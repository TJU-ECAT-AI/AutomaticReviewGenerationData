<p>Several different mechanisms involving the formation of a variety of intermediates have been proposed in the literature. These intermediates include ethyl groups (CH3-CH2-), vinyl groups (CH2=CH-), ethylidene (-CH-CH3), and vinylidene (=C=CH2).</p>
<p>Although direct spectroscopic evidence has been lacking, some experimental and theoretical studies have pointed to the likelihood of a mechanism involving an ethylidene intermediate. Windham and Koel have shown spectroscopic evidence for ethylene formation on Pt(111) when ethylene is coadsorbed with 0.12 monolayers of potassium at 100 K and then annealed to 300 K.</p>
<p>Evidence for an ethylidene species in the potassium promoted system has been further supported by Zhou et al. using secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS).</p>
<p>Some theoretical evidence has also pointed to ethylidene as a possible reaction intermediate. Carter and Koel have made equilibrium thermodynamic estimates of the energetics of the transformation of di-o" bonded ethylene to ethylidyne. These estimates support a mechanism involving ethylidene.</p>
<p>In the present work, we utilize infrared-visible sum frequency generation to study the v(CH) portion of the vibrational spectrum (2700-3100 cm-1). SFG is a powerful technique for surface vibrational spectroscopy because it is both surface specific and capable of providing resolution on the order of 10 cm-1 or less.</p>
<p>The CH stretch portion of the vibrational spectrum shows a clear progression from di-o" bonded ethylene to ethylidyne with the appearance of a high frequency feature at 2957 cm-1 that is only present during the transition. This feature has been assigned to the CH3 asymmetric stretch of ethylidene and/or ethyl.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Hydrogenation of the reactant to form a primary or secondary alcohol.
2. Rearrangement of the alcohol to form an ether.
3. Dehydration of the ether to form a ketone or aldehyde.
4. Oxidation of the ketone or aldehyde to form a carboxylic acid.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction pathway and the potential for multiple competing pathways to occur simultaneously. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the reaction conditions can significantly influence the pathway and rate-limiting step. For instance, different catalysts or reaction temperatures can alter the relative rates of the individual steps, leading to different overall reaction outcomes.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：
1. 将反应物氢化形成醇。
2. 通过醇重排形成醚。
3. 通过脱水形成酮或醛。
4. 氧化酮或醛形成羧酸。

关于哪个步骤被认为是决定性的步骤的争论，是因为反应路径的复杂性以及可能同时发生多个竞争路径。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为反应条件可以显著影响各个步骤的速率和路径，导致不同的整体反应结果。例如，不同的催化剂或反应温度可以改变单个步骤的相对速率，从而导致不同的总体反应结果。
