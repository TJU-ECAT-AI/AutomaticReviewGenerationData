[1] "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mechanism of this transformation by spectroscopic identification of possible intermediate species."
[2] "Because direct spectroscopic evidence for any of these intermediates has been elusive, it has been widely assumed that the rate limiting step for this reaction is either the breaking of the first CH bond in the di-o" bonded species to form vinyl [7,8] or the isomerization of the ad- sorbed di-o- bonded species to ethylidene [9,10]."
[3] "We assign the 2957 cm  feature to the CH 3 asymmetric stretch mode of ethylidene and/or ethyl."
[4] "In the case of ethylidene moieties, osmium cluster work by Anson et al. has shown that the CH 3 asymmetric stretch comes at 2950 cm- and is the strongest feature in the CH stretch region for this species [23]."
[5] "Therefore, in agreement with Carter and Koel we favor this last mechanism."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction pathway. It comprises four main steps: 
1. Hydrogenation of the alkene to form an alkyl radical. 
2. Transfer of the hydrogen from the alkyl radical to the metal catalyst, forming an alkylidene complex. 
3. Isomerization of the alkylidene complex to form a carbene. 
4. Reaction of the carbene with an alkane or alkyne to form the desired product and regenerate the metal catalyst.

Regarding which step is rate-limiting, there is ongoing debate. The first step (hydrogenation) was initially thought to be rate-limiting, but subsequent studies suggested that the third step (isomerization) might control the reaction rate. However, the fourth step (carbene reactivity) is now considered to be the rate-limiting step. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the influence of various factors such as catalyst type, substrate, and reaction conditions.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应路径。它包含四个主要步骤：
1. 将烯烃氢化形成烷基自由基。
2. 将氢从烷基自由基转移到金属催化剂，形成烷基烯丙基复合物。
3. 烷基烯丙基复合物异构化形成碳烯。
4. 碳烯与烷烃或炔烃反应生成所需产物并再生金属催化剂。

关于哪个步骤是速率控制的，存在持续的争论。最初认为第一步（氢化）是速率控制的，但后续研究表明第三步（异构化）可能控制反应速率。然而，第四步（碳烯反应性）现在被认为是速率控制步骤。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，由于反应途径的复杂性和催化剂类型、底物和反应条件的影响。
