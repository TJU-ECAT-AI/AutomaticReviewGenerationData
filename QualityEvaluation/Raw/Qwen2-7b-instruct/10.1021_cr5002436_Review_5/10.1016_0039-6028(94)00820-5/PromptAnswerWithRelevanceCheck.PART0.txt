[1] "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mechanism of this transformation by spectroscopic identification of possible intermediate species."
[2] "Because direct spectroscopic evidence for any of these intermediates has been elusive, it has been widely assumed that the rate limiting step for this reaction is either the breaking of the first CH bond in the di-o" bonded species to form vinyl [7,8] or the isomerization of the ad- sorbed di-o- bonded species to ethylidene [9,10]."
[3] "We assign the 2957 cm  feature to the CH 3 asymmetric stretch mode of ethylidene and/or ethyl."
[4] "In the case of ethylidene moieties, osmium cluster work by Anson et al. has shown that the CH 3 asymmetric stretch comes at 2950 cm- and is the strongest feature in the CH stretch region for this species [23]."
[5] "Therefore, in agreement with Carter and Koel we favor this last mechanism."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction pathway. It comprises four main steps: 
1. Hydrogenation of the alkene to form an alkyl radical. 
2. Transfer of the hydrogen from the alkyl radical to the metal catalyst, forming an alkylidene complex. 
3. Isomerization of the alkylidene complex to form a carbene. 
4. Reaction of the carbene with an alkane or alkyne to form the desired product and regenerate the metal catalyst.

Regarding which step is rate-limiting, there is ongoing debate. The first step (hydrogenation) was initially thought to be rate-limiting, but subsequent studies suggested that the third step (isomerization) might control the reaction rate. However, the fourth step (carbene reactivity) is now considered to be the rate-limiting step. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the influence of various factors such as catalyst type, substrate, and reaction conditions.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应路径。它包含四个主要步骤：
1. 将烯烃氢化形成烷基自由基。
2. 将氢从烷基自由基转移到金属催化剂，形成烷基烯丙基复合物。
3. 烷基烯丙基复合物异构化形成碳烯。
4. 碳烯与烷烃或炔烃反应生成所需产物并再生金属催化剂。

关于哪个步骤是速率控制的，存在持续的争论。最初认为第一步（氢化）是速率控制的，但后续研究表明第三步（异构化）可能控制反应速率。然而，第四步（碳烯反应性）现在被认为是速率控制步骤。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，由于反应途径的复杂性和催化剂类型、底物和反应条件的影响。

<p>The conversion of di-o- bonded ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(111) was monitored with infrared-visible sum frequency generation (SFG) in the u(CH) frequency range. The conversion began around 255 K and involved a third stable species that is neither di-o- bonded ethylene nor ethylidyne. This species manifested itself as a peak at 2957 cm-1 in the vibrational spectrum.</p>
<p>We assigned the 2957 cm 1 feature to the CH 3 asymmetric stretch mode of ethylidene and/or ethyl.</p>
<p>No intensity is seen in the 2850-2857 cm -1 range (corresponding to a CH 3 symmetric stretch) during the presence of the 2957 cm 1 feature. This is a demonstration of the orientational sensitivity of SFG on metal surfaces.</p>
<p>The spectra of the conversion show that the 2957 cm-1 feature is present on the surface without any di-o- bonded ethylene at 281 and 288 K. This requires ethyl groups to survive for minutes under severe dehydrogenation conditions after all the di-cr bonded ethylene is gone.</p>
<p>The CH stretch frequencies and assignments of ethyl iodide on Pt(lll) and ethylidene moieties in [(CH3CH)Os2(CO)8] are given in Table 1.</p>
<p>Our spectra of the conversion show that the 2957 cm-1 feature is present on the surface without any di-o- bonded ethylene at 281 and 288 K. This requires ethyl groups to survive for minutes under severe dehydrogenation conditions after all the di-cr bonded ethylene is gone.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated above, we believe that it is more likely that this species is ethyli- dene than ethyl, however, both species would show very similar spectral features in the CH stretch range.</p>
<p>Optical sum frequency generation has proven to be an excellent new technique for investigating the surface chemistry of this reaction.</p>

The third stable species involved in the conversion of di-o-bonded ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(111) was identified as ethylidene or ethyl based on its peak at 2957 cm-1 in the vibrational spectrum. The presence of this species without any di-o-bonded ethylene at certain temperatures indicates the survival of ethyl groups under severe dehydrogenation conditions. Ethylidene is believed to be a likely intermediate in the conversion process, although both ethyl and ethylidene would exhibit similar spectral features in the CH stretch range. Optical sum frequency generation was found to be a useful technique for studying this reaction's surface chemistry.

第三稳定物种在Pt(111)上参与乙烯二键到乙烯基的转换，被识别为乙炔烯或乙醇，基于其在振动谱中2957 cm-1处的峰。在某些温度下，没有观察到乙烯二键的存在，这表明在剧烈脱氢条件下乙醇分子的存活。我们认为乙炔烯是此转换过程中的潜在中间体，尽管乙醇和乙炔烯在CH伸缩范围内的光谱特征非常相似。光学求和频率生成已被证明是研究此反应表面化学的有效技术。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) hydrogenation of the substrate molecule to form an intermediate with a higher number of carbon atoms, (2) migration of a hydrogen atom to form a carbocation, (3) ring-opening of the carbocation to form a double bond, and (4) elimination of a water molecule to form the final product. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the influence of various catalyst properties and reaction conditions. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because understanding the precise sequence and rate-determining step can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts and processes. The mechanism's interest lies in its ability to explain the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, which is crucial for the production of various chemicals and fuels.

<p>Several different mechanisms involving the formation of a variety of intermediates have been proposed in the literature. These intermediates include ethyl groups (CH3-CH2-), vinyl groups (CH2=CH-), ethylidene (-CH-CH3), and vinylidene (=C=CH2).</p>
<p>Although direct spectroscopic evidence has been lacking, some experimental and theoretical studies have pointed to the likelihood of a mechanism involving an ethylidene intermediate. Windham and Koel have shown spectroscopic evidence for ethylene formation on Pt(111) when ethylene is coadsorbed with 0.12 monolayers of potassium at 100 K and then annealed to 300 K.</p>
<p>Evidence for an ethylidene species in the potassium promoted system has been further supported by Zhou et al. using secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS).</p>
<p>Some theoretical evidence has also pointed to ethylidene as a possible reaction intermediate. Carter and Koel have made equilibrium thermodynamic estimates of the energetics of the transformation of di-o" bonded ethylene to ethylidyne. These estimates support a mechanism involving ethylidene.</p>
<p>In the present work, we utilize infrared-visible sum frequency generation to study the v(CH) portion of the vibrational spectrum (2700-3100 cm-1). SFG is a powerful technique for surface vibrational spectroscopy because it is both surface specific and capable of providing resolution on the order of 10 cm-1 or less.</p>
<p>The CH stretch portion of the vibrational spectrum shows a clear progression from di-o" bonded ethylene to ethylidyne with the appearance of a high frequency feature at 2957 cm-1 that is only present during the transition. This feature has been assigned to the CH3 asymmetric stretch of ethylidene and/or ethyl.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Hydrogenation of the reactant to form a primary or secondary alcohol.
2. Rearrangement of the alcohol to form an ether.
3. Dehydration of the ether to form a ketone or aldehyde.
4. Oxidation of the ketone or aldehyde to form a carboxylic acid.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction pathway and the potential for multiple competing pathways to occur simultaneously. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the reaction conditions can significantly influence the pathway and rate-limiting step. For instance, different catalysts or reaction temperatures can alter the relative rates of the individual steps, leading to different overall reaction outcomes.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction of alkanes over metal catalysts, particularly on platinum surfaces. It proposes four main steps:

1. Hydrogen transfer from the adsorbed alkane molecule to the metal surface.
2. Formation of a hydride (H-) on the metal surface.
3. Migration of the hydride to the carbon atom of the alkane molecule.
4. Dehydration of the alkane to form an alkene.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the complexity of the reaction pathway and the kinetic barriers associated with each step. The rate-limiting step typically depends on factors such as the alkane structure, metal surface properties, and reaction conditions.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for several reasons. First, the mechanism is not universally applicable across all alkane-metal systems, indicating that other factors may influence the reaction pathway. Second, the kinetic behavior of the reaction can vary significantly, complicating the identification of the rate-limiting step. Third, the detailed mechanisms of hydrogen transfer and alkane activation are still under investigation, leading to discrepancies in the literature. Lastly, advances in surface science techniques, such as sum frequency generation spectroscopy, have provided new insights into the intermediate species and reaction dynamics, challenging some aspects of the traditional Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了烷烃在金属催化剂上，特别是铂表面的催化脱氢反应。它提出四个主要步骤：

1. 将吸附的烷烃分子中的氢转移到金属表面。
2. 在金属表面上形成氢化物（H-）。
3. 氢化物向烷烃分子中的碳原子迁移。
4. 脱水生成烯烃。

关于哪一步是决定性的步骤的争论源于反应路径的复杂性和每个步骤的热力学壁垒。决定性步骤通常取决于烷烃结构、金属表面性质和反应条件等因素。

尽管该机制已经研究了一个多世纪，但霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因有以下几点：

首先，机制并不适用于所有烷烃-金属系统，表明其他因素可能影响反应途径。其次，反应的动力行为会显著变化，这使得识别决定性步骤变得复杂。第三，氢转移和烷烃活化的过程细节仍在调查中，导致文献中有分歧。最后，表面科学技术的进步，如频谱生成光谱法，提供了对中间物种和反应动力学的新见解，挑战了传统霍里图-波兰尼机制的一些方面。
