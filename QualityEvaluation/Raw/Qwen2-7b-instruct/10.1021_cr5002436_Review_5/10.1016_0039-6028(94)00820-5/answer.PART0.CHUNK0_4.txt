[1] "Several different mechanisms involving the formation of a variety of intermediates have been proposed in the literature."
[2] "Because direct spectroscopic evidence for any of these intermediates has been elusive, it has been widely assumed that the rate limiting step for this reaction is either the breaking of the first CH bond in the di-o" bonded species to form vinyl or the isomerization of the adsorbed di-o- bonded species to ethylidene."
[3] "Our results indicate the presence of a third species present on the Pt(lll) surface during the conversion of di-o" bonded ethylene to ethylidyne. This species gave rise to a vibrational feature which was observed only during the reaction and has been assigned to the CH 3 asymmetric stretch of ethylidene and/or ethyl."
[4] "In the case of ethylidene moieties, osmium cluster work by Anson et al. has shown that the CH 3 asymmetric stretch comes at 2950 cm- and is the strongest feature in the CH stretch region for this species."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction of alkanes over metal catalysts, particularly on platinum surfaces. It proposes four main steps:

1. Hydrogen transfer from the adsorbed alkane molecule to the metal surface.
2. Formation of a hydride (H-) on the metal surface.
3. Migration of the hydride to the carbon atom of the alkane molecule.
4. Dehydration of the alkane to form an alkene.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the complexity of the reaction pathway and the kinetic barriers associated with each step. The rate-limiting step typically depends on factors such as the alkane structure, metal surface properties, and reaction conditions.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for several reasons. First, the mechanism is not universally applicable across all alkane-metal systems, indicating that other factors may influence the reaction pathway. Second, the kinetic behavior of the reaction can vary significantly, complicating the identification of the rate-limiting step. Third, the detailed mechanisms of hydrogen transfer and alkane activation are still under investigation, leading to discrepancies in the literature. Lastly, advances in surface science techniques, such as sum frequency generation spectroscopy, have provided new insights into the intermediate species and reaction dynamics, challenging some aspects of the traditional Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了烷烃在金属催化剂上，特别是铂表面的催化脱氢反应。它提出四个主要步骤：

1. 将吸附的烷烃分子中的氢转移到金属表面。
2. 在金属表面上形成氢化物（H-）。
3. 氢化物向烷烃分子中的碳原子迁移。
4. 脱水生成烯烃。

关于哪一步是决定性的步骤的争论源于反应路径的复杂性和每个步骤的热力学壁垒。决定性步骤通常取决于烷烃结构、金属表面性质和反应条件等因素。

尽管该机制已经研究了一个多世纪，但霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因有以下几点：

首先，机制并不适用于所有烷烃-金属系统，表明其他因素可能影响反应途径。其次，反应的动力行为会显著变化，这使得识别决定性步骤变得复杂。第三，氢转移和烷烃活化的过程细节仍在调查中，导致文献中有分歧。最后，表面科学技术的进步，如频谱生成光谱法，提供了对中间物种和反应动力学的新见解，挑战了传统霍里图-波兰尼机制的一些方面。
