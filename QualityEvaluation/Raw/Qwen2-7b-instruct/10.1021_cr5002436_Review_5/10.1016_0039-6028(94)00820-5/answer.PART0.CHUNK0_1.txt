<p>The conversion of di-o- bonded ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(111) was monitored with infrared-visible sum frequency generation (SFG) in the u(CH) frequency range. The conversion began around 255 K and involved a third stable species that is neither di-o- bonded ethylene nor ethylidyne. This species manifested itself as a peak at 2957 cm-1 in the vibrational spectrum.</p>
<p>We assigned the 2957 cm 1 feature to the CH 3 asymmetric stretch mode of ethylidene and/or ethyl.</p>
<p>No intensity is seen in the 2850-2857 cm -1 range (corresponding to a CH 3 symmetric stretch) during the presence of the 2957 cm 1 feature. This is a demonstration of the orientational sensitivity of SFG on metal surfaces.</p>
<p>The spectra of the conversion show that the 2957 cm-1 feature is present on the surface without any di-o- bonded ethylene at 281 and 288 K. This requires ethyl groups to survive for minutes under severe dehydrogenation conditions after all the di-cr bonded ethylene is gone.</p>
<p>The CH stretch frequencies and assignments of ethyl iodide on Pt(lll) and ethylidene moieties in [(CH3CH)Os2(CO)8] are given in Table 1.</p>
<p>Our spectra of the conversion show that the 2957 cm-1 feature is present on the surface without any di-o- bonded ethylene at 281 and 288 K. This requires ethyl groups to survive for minutes under severe dehydrogenation conditions after all the di-cr bonded ethylene is gone.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated above, we believe that it is more likely that this species is ethyli- dene than ethyl, however, both species would show very similar spectral features in the CH stretch range.</p>
<p>Optical sum frequency generation has proven to be an excellent new technique for investigating the surface chemistry of this reaction.</p>

The third stable species involved in the conversion of di-o-bonded ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(111) was identified as ethylidene or ethyl based on its peak at 2957 cm-1 in the vibrational spectrum. The presence of this species without any di-o-bonded ethylene at certain temperatures indicates the survival of ethyl groups under severe dehydrogenation conditions. Ethylidene is believed to be a likely intermediate in the conversion process, although both ethyl and ethylidene would exhibit similar spectral features in the CH stretch range. Optical sum frequency generation was found to be a useful technique for studying this reaction's surface chemistry.

第三稳定物种在Pt(111)上参与乙烯二键到乙烯基的转换，被识别为乙炔烯或乙醇，基于其在振动谱中2957 cm-1处的峰。在某些温度下，没有观察到乙烯二键的存在，这表明在剧烈脱氢条件下乙醇分子的存活。我们认为乙炔烯是此转换过程中的潜在中间体，尽管乙醇和乙炔烯在CH伸缩范围内的光谱特征非常相似。光学求和频率生成已被证明是研究此反应表面化学的有效技术。
