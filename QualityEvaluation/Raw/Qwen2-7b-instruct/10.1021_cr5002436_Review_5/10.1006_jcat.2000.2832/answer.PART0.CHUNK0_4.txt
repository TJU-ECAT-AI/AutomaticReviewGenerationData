[1] "The reaction rates were measured using a gradientless batch reactor consisting of a shallow packed bed within a gas recirculation loop."
[2] "The chemical composition of the recirculating stream was determined by gas chromatography (Hewlett-Packard 6890), and the isotopic content by mass spectrometry/gas chromatography (Hewlett-Packard 5972)."
[3] "The value of k1 is determined from the initial rate of propene conversion (as t 0) and the value of k2 from the initial propene selectivity (S0)."
[4] "These results are consistent with those reported in the literatures (9, 10)."
[5] "Kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were measured on 10 wt% V2O5/ZrO2."
[6] "Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for propane primary dehydrogenation (2.8) and combustion (1.9) and for propene secondary combustion reactions (2.6) were obtained when CH3CH2CH3 and CD3CD2CD3 were used as reactants."

The document describes the measurement of kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on a vanadium oxide catalyst. The KIEs for primary dehydrogenation, combustion of propane, and secondary combustion of propene were obtained using CH3CH2CH3 and CD3CD2CD3 as reactants. The results suggest that CH bond dissociation is a kinetically relevant step in all these reactions. The study also confirms that the methylene CH bond is activated in the rate-determining steps for propane dehydrogenation and combustion, while the allylic CH bond is involved in secondary propene combustion. The KIE values for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (2.8) and propane combustion (1.9) are different, indicating that these reactions involve different lattice oxygen sites.

文档描述了在范德华氧化物催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢的动态同位素效应（KIE）的测量。使用CH3CH2CH3和CD3CD2CD3作为反应物，获得了丙烷主脱氢、丙烷燃烧和丙烯二次燃烧的KIE值。结果表明，在所有这些反应中，CH键解离是动力学相关的步骤。研究还证实，甲基CH键在丙烷脱氢和燃烧的速率决定步骤中被激活，而二级丙烯燃烧涉及激活的异丙基CH键。丙烷氧化脱氢（2.8）和丙烷燃烧（1.9）的KIE值不同，表明这两个反应涉及不同的氧位点。
