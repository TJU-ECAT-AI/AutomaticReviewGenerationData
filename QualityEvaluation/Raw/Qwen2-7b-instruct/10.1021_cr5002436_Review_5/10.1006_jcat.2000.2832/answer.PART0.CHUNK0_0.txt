[1] "The reaction involves Marsvan Krevelen redox pathways with lattice oxygen involved in rate-determining CH bond activation steps."
[2] "The measured propane oxidative dehydrogenation KIE values are consistent with those theoretically predicted."
[3] "The much smaller KIE for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (2.8) than the maximum KIE (6) expected for propane thermal dehydrogenation indicates the participation of lattice oxygen."
[4] "The different KIE values for propane primary dehydrogenation and combustion reactions suggest that these two reactions involve different lattice oxygen sites."

The literature explains the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, focusing on four main steps. However, it does not provide a detailed explanation of the mechanism itself. Instead, it discusses the ongoing debate regarding which of these steps is considered rate-limiting. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reactions and the intricate role of catalysts and reactants. The literature provides insights into the involvement of lattice oxygen in the activation steps and the differences in kinetic isotope effects between various dehydrogenation reactions, suggesting the mechanism's relevance in understanding the catalytic processes.

文献解释了催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，重点关注四个主要步骤。然而，它没有提供机制本身的详细解释。相反，它讨论了关于这些步骤中哪个被认为是决定速率的关键步骤的持续争议。尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，由于反应的复杂性和催化剂与反应物的精细作用。文献提供了有关在激活步骤中涉及晶格氧以及各种脱氢反应之间动力学同位素效应差异的信息，这表明机制在理解催化过程方面的相关性。
