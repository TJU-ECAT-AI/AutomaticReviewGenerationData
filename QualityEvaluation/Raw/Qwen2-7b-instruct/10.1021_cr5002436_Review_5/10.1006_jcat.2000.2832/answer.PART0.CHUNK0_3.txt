[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is thermodynamically favored over a wide temperature range and offers the potential for the synthesis of alkenes with significant savings in energy and feedstock costs (15)."
[2] "At relatively low conversions and low H2O concentrations, the rate of each reaction is well described by r1 = k1[C3H8] [1] r2 = k2[C3H8] [2] r3 = k3[C3H6],[3] where ki is the apparent first-order rate coefficient for reaction i."
[3] "The activation of both propane and propene involves the cleavage of CH bonds in kinetically relevant steps."
[4] "Previous results show that water can also exchange with H and D present on the catalyst surface during ODH (8)."
[5] "These elementary steps, together with pseudo-steady-state assumptions for all adsorbed intermediates and quasi-equilibrium assumptions for steps (II) and (IV), lead to a rate expression of the form r = kIIKI[C3H8]/1 + (KIV[H2O])0.5 × (kIIKI[C3H8]/2kV[O2])0.252,[5]"
[6] "The measured propane oxidative dehydrogenation KIE values are in agreement with theoretical estimates using a sequence of elementary steps,reaction rate expression, and transition state theory."
[7] "The smaller KIE for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (2.8) than the maximum KIE (6) expected for propane thermal dehydrogenation indicates the participation of lattice oxygen."
[8] "The different KIE values for propane primary dehydrogenation and combustion reactions suggest that these two reactions involve different lattice oxygen sites."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. First, a reactant molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface. Second, a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the molecule by a nearby catalyst atom, creating a carbocation intermediate. Third, the carbocation undergoes a rearrangement to form a new product molecule. Fourth, the catalyst regenerates itself to be ready for the next cycle. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to variations in reaction conditions and catalyst properties. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism's importance lies in its ability to explain the reaction dynamics and guide the development of more effective catalysts.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤。第一步，反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面。第二步，附近催化剂原子从分子中抽象出一个氢原子，形成一个碳正离子中间体。第三步，碳正离子经历重排形成一个新的产物分子。第四步，催化剂自我再生以准备下一个循环。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论，是因为在不同的反应条件和催化剂性质下存在差异。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它影响了脱氢过程的效率和选择性。该机制的重要性在于它能够解释反应动力学并指导更有效催化剂的发展。
