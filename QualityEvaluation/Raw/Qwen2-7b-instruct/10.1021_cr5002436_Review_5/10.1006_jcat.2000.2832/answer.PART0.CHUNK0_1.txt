[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is thermodynamically favored over a wide temperature range and offers the potential for the synthesis of alkenes with significant savings in energy and feedstock costs (15)."
[2] "The reaction involves Marsvan Krevelen redox pathways with lattice oxygen involved in rate-determining CH bond activation steps (2, 8)."
[3] "The KIE values for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (2.8) and propane combustion (1.9) are different, suggesting that these two reactions involve different lattice oxygen sites."
[4] "The much smaller KIE for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (2.8) than the maximum KIE (6) expected for propane thermal dehydrogenation indicates the participation of lattice oxygen."
[5] "Kinetic isotopic effects using undeuterated (CH3CH2CH3), perdeuterated (CD3CD2CD3), and selectively deuterated propane (CH3CD2CH3) molecules can be used to identify the kinetic significance of CH bond activation steps and the position of the CH involved in oxidative dehydrogenation."

This document provides insights into the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, specifically focusing on propane. The Marsvan Krevelen redox pathways play a crucial role, with lattice oxygen participating in the rate-determining steps of CH bond activation. The kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) for propane ODH and combustion reveal differences in the lattice oxygen sites involved, indicating distinct mechanisms. The KIE for propane ODH (2.8) being notably smaller than the theoretical maximum (6) for thermal dehydrogenation suggests the involvement of lattice oxygen. By using isotopically labeled propane molecules, researchers can identify the kinetic significance of CH bond activation steps and the position of the CH bond involved in oxidative dehydrogenation.

本文提供了关于烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的见解，特别是丙烷。Marsvan Krevelen 红氧化途径在确定性的 CH 键激活步骤中起着关键作用，其中晶格氧参与。丙烷 ODH 和燃烧的 KIE 显示了不同晶格氧位点的差异，表明存在不同的机制。丙烷 ODH 的 KIE（2.8）明显小于理论最大值（6）的热脱氢化，这表明晶格氧的存在。通过使用同位素标记的丙烷分子，研究人员可以识别氧化脱氢的动能异位效应（KIE）的亲键激活步骤的重要性以及涉及的 CH 键的位置。
