This document provides insights into the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, specifically focusing on propane. The Marsvan Krevelen redox pathways play a crucial role, with lattice oxygen participating in the rate-determining steps of CH bond activation. The kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) for propane ODH and combustion reveal differences in the lattice oxygen sites involved, indicating distinct mechanisms. The KIE for propane ODH (2.8) being notably smaller than the theoretical maximum (6) for thermal dehydrogenation suggests the involvement of lattice oxygen. By using isotopically labeled propane molecules, researchers can identify the kinetic significance of CH bond activation steps and the position of the CH bond involved in oxidative dehydrogenation.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions has been a subject of extensive study for nearly a century. It involves four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of a critical bond within the molecule, the formation of a reactive intermediate, and the subsequent desorption of the product. Despite this, the debate continues about which of these steps is rate-limiting. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its complexity and the significant implications for industrial processes such as the production of alkenes from alkanes.

The ongoing debate about the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is rooted in the intricate interplay between the various steps and the specific conditions under which the reactions occur. The adsorption step is crucial for bringing the reactant molecule close enough to the catalyst surface for further reactions. The activation step, where a critical bond is broken or weakened, often involves the participation of lattice oxygen species, which is confirmed by the kinetic isotope effects observed. This step is particularly significant in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, as indicated by the much smaller kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to its thermal counterpart. The KIE values suggest that lattice oxygen plays a role in the activation process.

The formation of a reactive intermediate, often involving the creation of CO and OH bonds along with the weakening of a CH bond, is another critical step. This process is hypothesized to be the rate-determining step in secondary propene combustion, as suggested by the preference for the allylic CH bond's dissociation during this reaction. The complexity of this mechanism, combined with the practical importance of understanding the rate-limiting step for optimizing catalytic processes, makes it a topic of continued scientific inquiry.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is thus a central concept in the field of catalytic dehydrogenation, but the precise role of each step and the identification of the rate-limiting step remain subjects of ongoing research and discussion. The insights gained from studying this mechanism contribute to advancements in the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应的研究已经进行了近一个世纪。它涉及四个主要步骤：反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附、分子内关键键的激活、形成活性中间体以及随后产品的脱附。尽管如此，关于哪个步骤是决定性的争论仍在继续。这个机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的焦点，原因在于其复杂性和对工业过程（如从烷烃生产烯烃）的重要影响。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制的持续争论源于各个步骤之间的复杂相互作用及其在特定条件下发生反应的情况。吸附步骤对于将反应物分子带到足够接近催化剂表面以进行后续反应至关重要。激活步骤，其中打破或削弱分子内的关键键，往往涉及到晶格氧物种的参与，这是通过观察到的热力学同位素效应证实的。这些效应表明，在氧化脱氢化反应中，晶格氧在激活过程中起着重要作用。

形成活性中间体的过程，通常伴随着CO和OH键的形成以及CH键的削弱，是另一个关键步骤。据推测，这是次级丙烯燃烧过程中决定性的步骤，因为根据推测，最弱的亚甲基CH键在燃烧过程中优先断裂。机制的复杂性与理解每个步骤的作用以及确定决定性步骤的重要性相结合，使得它成为持续研究的主题。

因此，Horiuti-Polanyi机制是催化脱氢化领域的核心概念，但每个步骤的确切作用以及确定决定性步骤仍然是正在进行的研究和讨论的主题。从研究这个机制中获得的见解促进了催化剂设计的改进，以提高效率和选择性。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. First, a reactant molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface. Second, a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the molecule by a nearby catalyst atom, creating a carbocation intermediate. Third, the carbocation undergoes a rearrangement to form a new product molecule. Fourth, the catalyst regenerates itself to be ready for the next cycle. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to variations in reaction conditions and catalyst properties. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism's importance lies in its ability to explain the reaction dynamics and guide the development of more effective catalysts.

The document describes the measurement of kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on a vanadium oxide catalyst. The KIEs for primary dehydrogenation, combustion of propane, and secondary combustion of propene were obtained using CH3CH2CH3 and CD3CD2CD3 as reactants. The results suggest that CH bond dissociation is a kinetically relevant step in all these reactions. The study also confirms that the methylene CH bond is activated in the rate-determining steps for propane dehydrogenation and combustion, while the allylic CH bond is involved in secondary propene combustion. The KIE values for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (2.8) and propane combustion (1.9) are different, indicating that these reactions involve different lattice oxygen sites.
