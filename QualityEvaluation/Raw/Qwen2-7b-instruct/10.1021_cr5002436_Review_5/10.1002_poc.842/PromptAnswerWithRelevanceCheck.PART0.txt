The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main reaction steps: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. An alternative mechanism is also explored, in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex.

The activation free energy of the (1,2,3) cycle as computed for the DeRossi-1 model and CH activation involving the hydroxyl ligand, is computed in the range 266-286 kJ mol1, depending on the point at which the entropy increases associated with desorption of ethene start to outweigh the losses in coordination energy.

However, the water formed in reaction (1) on DeRossi species is likely to desorb, thus preventing regeneration of the chromium species. Activity due to the (1,2,3) cycle is therefore more likely to involve CrO ester linkages to the surface, with formation of a silanol moiety during the initial CH activation step. In this case, weak coordination of silanol to the metal results in a higher electronic energy of the ethyl complex and consequently also of the rate-determining step of the cycle, which involves -hydrogen transfer and ethene desorption.

The increase in energy amounts to about 50 kJ mol1, which appears also in the overall enthalpy and free energy of activation. The lowest values of activation enthalpy and free energy of the (1,2,3) cycle are thus in the order of 200 and 300 kJ mol1, respectively.

An alternative mechanism is apparent from our calculations, in which H2 formation and CH activation take place in a second, concerted reaction between chromium and ethane. Since CH activation takes place at the reactive hydride complex rather than at a fairly stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands, the activation barrier for CH activation becomes markedly lower. Still, the entropy loss associated with chemisorp- tion of ethane contributes to make CH activation the rate determining step for the (4,2) cycle.

Using propane pressure of 5 kN m2 in flow experiments at 500 C, a turnover frequency in the order of 103 molecules s1 per surface Cr atom was observed on Cr silica. On the basis of our computed free energies of activation, turnover frequencies in the order of 101 molecules s1 per hydridochromium complex are obtained for the (4,2) cycle and 109 molecules s1 per (O)3Cr species for the (1,2,3) cycle.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is characterized by three primary steps:

1. **CH Activation**: This step involves the activation of a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond in the alkane molecule through a reaction with the metal catalyst, typically chromium. This process is facilitated by the breaking of the C-H bond and the formation of a new carbon-metal (C-M) bond and a hydrogen-oxygen (H-O) bond.

2. **Hydrogen Transfer**: In the second step, a hydrogen atom is transferred from the alkyl group (formed in the first step) to the metal, resulting in the formation of an alkene molecule and releasing ethene (ethylene) as a product.

3. **Regeneration of the Catalyst**: The final step involves the regeneration of the metal catalyst by reacting with hydrogen gas, releasing water and regenerating the metal to its active form.

An alternative mechanism has been proposed, suggesting that the initial CH activation occurs at a reactive hydridochromium complex rather than at a stable chromium species. This mechanism involves the formation of hydrogen-hydrogen (H-H) and carbon-metal (C-M) bonds through a -bond metathesis reaction, leading to a lower activation barrier for CH activation.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting involves the energy barriers associated with each step and the entropy changes during the reaction. The (1,2,3) cycle, which includes the three primary steps, has an activation energy in the range of 200-300 kJ/mol. The presence of water or silanol molecules during the first step can affect the stability of the catalyst and thus the rate of the reaction.

The (4,2) cycle, where hydrogen is formed and CH activation occurs at a reactive hydridochromium complex, has a lower activation energy of around 70 kJ/mol, making it the rate-determining step for this alternative mechanism.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reactions involved, the sensitivity of the mechanism to the local structure of the catalyst, and the ongoing debates about the rate-limiting steps and the role of different reaction pathways. The detailed analysis of reaction barriers, the influence of surface strain, and the role of surface species in catalytic activity continue to drive research in this area.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制主要包含三个关键步骤：

1. **碳氢键活化**：此步骤涉及烷烃分子中碳氢（C-H）键与催化剂金属（通常是铬）的活化，通过形成新的碳金属（C-M）键和氢氧（H-O）键来实现C-H键的断裂。

2. **氢转移**：第二步中，烷基团中的一个氢原子转移到金属上，形成烯烃分子并释放乙烯作为产物。

3. **催化剂再生**：最后一步涉及通过与氢气反应生成水，从而将金属催化剂再生为活性形式。

提出了一个替代机制，表明初始的C-H活化发生在活性氢化铬复合物上，而不是在稳定的铬物种上。这一机制通过-键互换反应形成了氢-氢（H-H）和碳金属（C-M）键，导致CH活化的激活壁垒降低。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的，争论主要围绕每个步骤的能垒以及反应过程中熵的变化。在包含三个主要步骤的（1,2,3）循环中，激活能量范围在200至300 kJ/mol之间。水或硅醇分子的存在可能会影响催化剂的稳定性，进而影响反应速率。

在（4,2）循环中，氢形成和CH活化发生在活性氢化铬复合物上，其激活能量约为70 kJ/mol，这使得它是替代机制的决定性步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，原因在于反应的复杂性、催化剂局部结构对机制的影响、关于速率限制步骤和不同反应途径作用的持续辩论。对反应壁垒的详细分析、表面张力的影响以及表面物种在催化活性中的作用继续推动该领域的研究。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely studied concept that has been a subject of scientific interest and debate for nearly a century. This mechanism is centered around the idea that ethane is activated through a series of three main steps: 
1. The activation of a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond, which is facilitated by the breaking of a chromium-oxygen (Cr-O) bond. This step leads to the formation of a hydroxyl (OH) group and a chromium-carbon (Cr-C) bond.
2. Subsequently, a hydrogen atom is transferred from the ethane molecule to the chromium atom, resulting in the release of ethene (ethylene) as a product. 
3. Lastly, the regeneration of the chromium site occurs through a bond metathesis reaction, where a hydrogen atom is again transferred to the chromium atom, releasing molecular hydrogen (H2) and regenerating the chromium site.

Regarding the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, there is ongoing debate among scientists. The first step, involving the activation of the C-H bond, is sometimes considered the rate-limiting step because it requires significant activation energy. However, other studies suggest that the second step, the hydrogen transfer from ethane to chromium, might be the rate-limiting step due to the high activation energy required for this process.

Despite nearly a century of research, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to be a topic of scientific interest and controversy. Researchers are still exploring the complexities of the mechanism, including the role of surface structure and the precise pathways of the reactions. This ongoing investigation aims to refine our understanding of the mechanism and potentially improve the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes in industrial applications.

脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制是近一个世纪以来科学界广泛关注的概念。该机制围绕以下三个主要步骤展开：
1. 通过断裂铬氧（Cr-O）键激活乙烷中的碳氢（C-H）键，形成羟基（OH）组和铬碳（Cr-C）键。
2. 随后，从乙烷分子转移一个氢原子到铬原子，导致乙烯（乙炔）的释放作为产物。
3. 最后，通过键交换反应再生铬位点，其中再次转移氢原子到铬原子，释放分子氢（H2），并再生铬位点。

关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制中哪一步被认为是速率限制性步骤，科学界存在持续的争论。有时，第一步被认为是最慢的步骤，因为它需要大量的活化能。然而，其他研究认为第二步，即从乙烷转移到铬的氢原子，可能是速率限制性步骤，因为这个过程需要很高的活化能。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题。研究人员仍在探索机制的复杂性，包括表面结构的作用以及反应路径的精确方式。这些持续的研究旨在进一步完善我们对机制的理解，并可能提高工业应用中脱氢过程的效率。

Reactions on molecular cluster models of DeRossi-type sites For simplicity, a chromium site will be referred to by the ligands in the first coordination sphere of the metal.
For instance, a general DeRossi-type site is denoted by (O)2CrOH, where O represents a generic oxygen ligand singly bonded to chromium. The reaction scheme of Fig. 2 is first presented and analyzed using the DeRossi-1 cluster model shown as Fig. 3A. For this model, the free energy profile of the catalytic reaction is computed and used to identify the rate-determining step. Subsequent models are then used to investigate the importance of the constraints imposed by the silica sur- face on the chromium site.
Reactions on the DeRossi-1 model. We have not been able to locate any molecular complexes between ethane and chromium on DeRossi-type Cr(III) sites. This implies that the initial encounter is reactive rather than physisorptive, contrary to the original proposal of Weckhuysen et al.3 The initial reactive collision between the (O)2CrOH site and ethane is henceforth assumed to follow a -bond metathesis mechanism, in which a CH bond in ethane and the CrOH bond of the DeRossi site are broken and new ethylCr and HOH bonds are formed.

Dehydrogenation activity due to the alternative (4,2) cycle relies entirely on the population of hydri- dochromium complexes on the surface. As the free energy change of reaction (1) to form the ethylchromium complex is computed to 178 kJ mol1, the population appears to be small. However, for temperatures above 0 C, the water molecule formed in reaction (1) is likely to desorb and to get flushed downstream. Under dry conditions, this means that the hydrido complex is stabilized for stoichiometric reasons, and the (4,2) cycle could become an important catalytic pathway of dehy- drogenation, see Fig. 7. The activation enthalpy of this cycle is computed to 74 or 69 kJ mol1, depending on the presence or absence of a Lewis donor.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Activation of the C-H bond by -bond metathesis.
2. Transfer of a hydrogen atom from the alkyl group to the chromium atom.
3. Release of the alkene.
4. Regeneration of the chromium site through the formation of hydrogen gas.

Regarding the debate about which step is rate-limiting, it varies based on the specific conditions and catalyst. The initial C-H activation step is considered the rate-limiting step in many cases, but there is ongoing discussion about the role of the hydridochromium complex and its ability to regenerate the chromium site efficiently.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it is fundamental to understanding how catalysts work in dehydrogenation processes. It continues to inspire new research aimed at improving catalyst efficiency, understanding reaction pathways, and optimizing reaction conditions. The complexity of the mechanism and the potential for different steps to become rate-limiting under varying conditions make it a rich area of investigation.

1. CH activation of ethane through -bond metathesis, accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds.
2. -H transfer to chromium, resulting in the subsequent loss of ethene.
3. Regeneration of the chromium site through -bond metathesis, leading to the loss of H2.

The regeneration of the chromium site depends on the initial CH activation step involving a CrO ester linkage to the surface. 

An alternative mechanism proposes that CH activation occurs at a reactive hydridochromium complex formed during the second step, rather than at more stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands. This alternative mechanism is significant because it allows for maintaining a reactive hydridochromium site, preventing the formation of more stable chromium-oxygen complexes.

The ability to maintain this reactive state is sensitive to the local structure around chromium. On DeRossi-type species, the water molecule formed in the initial step is likely to desorb, making the reformation of the CrO bond less likely. On species with three CrO ester linkages to the surface, a silanol moiety is formed instead of water during the initial CH/CrO activation. At strained surface sites, the silanol can relax away from chromium, hindering the reformation of the CrO bond. However, if the silanol remains loosely coordinated to chromium, regeneration of the CrO bond is facilitated.

It's possible that both mechanisms operate simultaneously in active catalysts. The presence of moisture in the feed can terminate the hydride-based mechanism.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the ongoing debate over which step is truly rate-limiting and the complexities introduced by different surface structures affecting the reactivity and stability of the chromium species. The intricate interplay between surface chemistry, catalyst design, and reaction kinetics continues to be a subject of intense research and discussion among scientists.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含三个主要步骤：
1. 通过-键重排激活乙烷中的CH，伴随形成OH和CrC键。
2. -H转移到铬上，随后丢失乙烯。
3. 通过-键重排再生铬位点，导致H2的丢失。

根据计算的能量，提出了一个替代机制，在第二个步骤中形成的活性氢化铬复合物作为CH激活的地点，而不是在具有三个氧配体的更稳定的铬物种上。这个替代机制的重要性在于它允许保持活性氢化铬位点，防止形成更稳定的铬-氧复合物。

保持这种活性状态的能力取决于铬周围局部结构的敏感性。在DeRossi类型物种上，初始步骤中形成的水分子很可能会脱附，使得CrO键的重新形成变得不太可能。在表面带有三个CrO酯链接的物种上，初始CH/CrO激活期间会形成一个硅醇基团，而不是水。在受压的表面站点上，硅醇可以远离铬放松，从而阻碍CrO键的重新形成。然而，如果硅醇基团仍然松散地与铬结合，CrO键的再生就会变得容易。

有可能这两种机制同时在活性催化剂中起作用。进料中的微量水分可以终止基于氢的机制。

由于争论哪一步真正决定速率以及不同表面结构对反应活性和稳定性的影响，该机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的热点。表面化学、催化剂设计和反应动力学之间的复杂相互作用继续是科学家们激烈研究和讨论的主题。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely discussed theoretical framework that aims to explain the process of dehydrogenation over metal catalysts. It is based on the idea that dehydrogenation occurs through a series of steps, each involving the breaking and reforming of chemical bonds. The four main steps of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism are as follows:

1. **Activation of the Alkane**: The alkane molecule is first adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, typically through physisorption or chemisorption. The activation step involves breaking a hydrogen-hydrogen bond within the alkane molecule, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This step is often rate-determining in dehydrogenation processes, especially when considering the initial encounter of the alkane with the catalyst surface.

2. **Formation of the Catalyst-Alkyl Complex**: Once the alkane is activated, it forms a complex with the catalyst. This complex often involves the formation of a metal-carbon bond and a metal-hydrogen bond, as well as the breaking of the alkane's carbon-hydrogen bond. This step involves the formation of a reactive intermediate that is capable of undergoing further transformations.

3. **Hydrogen Transfer**: In the next step, a hydrogen atom is transferred from the catalyst to the alkyl radical, leading to the formation of an alkene. This hydrogen transfer is often facilitated by the presence of a surface-bound hydrogen molecule or by the reorientation of hydrogen atoms within the catalyst structure. The formation of the alkene is typically a rapid process and is energetically favorable compared to the activation step.

4. **Regeneration of the Catalyst Surface**: The final step involves the regeneration of the catalyst surface, allowing it to return to its initial state and to continue catalyzing the dehydrogenation reaction. This regeneration process can occur through the breaking of the metal-hydrogen bond, the formation of a new metal-oxygen bond, or through a combination of these processes. The efficiency of this step determines the overall activity and stability of the catalyst.

Despite the comprehensive nature of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, there is ongoing debate regarding which step is truly rate-limiting in dehydrogenation reactions. The identification of the rate-limiting step depends on the specific catalyst, reaction conditions, and the nature of the alkane being dehydrogenated. Experimental data and theoretical studies have provided insights into the relative energies and rates of each step, but consensus has not been reached on the definitive rate-limiting step.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for several reasons:

- **Complexity of Catalyst Surfaces**: Metal catalyst surfaces are often complex, with multiple coordination sites and environments. This complexity makes it challenging to accurately predict the energetics and kinetics of each step in the dehydrogenation mechanism.

- **Role of Surface Effects**: The local environment around the catalyst surface can significantly influence the reaction pathways and the relative energies of the steps. Understanding how surface effects impact the mechanism is crucial but remains an area of ongoing research.

- **Variability in Catalyst Preparation**: Different preparation methods can lead to variations in catalyst morphology, composition, and surface properties. These variations can alter the catalytic activity and the mechanism of dehydrogenation, making it difficult to generalize the mechanism across different catalysts.

- **Experimental Challenges**: Direct observation of the intermediate species and the rates of individual steps in dehydrogenation reactions can be technically challenging. This lack of direct evidence contributes to the uncertainty in pinpointing the rate-limiting step.

- **Theoretical Limitations**: While computational methods have advanced significantly, accurately predicting the complex interactions between catalysts and reactants, as well as the subtle energy differences between competing pathways, remains a significant challenge.

The ongoing study of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to drive advancements in catalysis research, leading to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications. The controversies surrounding the mechanism highlight the need for interdisciplinary approaches that combine experimental techniques with computational modeling to gain a deeper understanding of catalytic processes.
