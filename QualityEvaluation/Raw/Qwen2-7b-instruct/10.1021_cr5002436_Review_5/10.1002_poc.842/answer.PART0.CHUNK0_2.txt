Reactions on molecular cluster models of DeRossi-type sites For simplicity, a chromium site will be referred to by the ligands in the first coordination sphere of the metal.
For instance, a general DeRossi-type site is denoted by (O)2CrOH, where O represents a generic oxygen ligand singly bonded to chromium. The reaction scheme of Fig. 2 is first presented and analyzed using the DeRossi-1 cluster model shown as Fig. 3A. For this model, the free energy profile of the catalytic reaction is computed and used to identify the rate-determining step. Subsequent models are then used to investigate the importance of the constraints imposed by the silica sur- face on the chromium site.
Reactions on the DeRossi-1 model. We have not been able to locate any molecular complexes between ethane and chromium on DeRossi-type Cr(III) sites. This implies that the initial encounter is reactive rather than physisorptive, contrary to the original proposal of Weckhuysen et al.3 The initial reactive collision between the (O)2CrOH site and ethane is henceforth assumed to follow a -bond metathesis mechanism, in which a CH bond in ethane and the CrOH bond of the DeRossi site are broken and new ethylCr and HOH bonds are formed.

Dehydrogenation activity due to the alternative (4,2) cycle relies entirely on the population of hydri- dochromium complexes on the surface. As the free energy change of reaction (1) to form the ethylchromium complex is computed to 178 kJ mol1, the population appears to be small. However, for temperatures above 0 C, the water molecule formed in reaction (1) is likely to desorb and to get flushed downstream. Under dry conditions, this means that the hydrido complex is stabilized for stoichiometric reasons, and the (4,2) cycle could become an important catalytic pathway of dehy- drogenation, see Fig. 7. The activation enthalpy of this cycle is computed to 74 or 69 kJ mol1, depending on the presence or absence of a Lewis donor.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Activation of the C-H bond by -bond metathesis.
2. Transfer of a hydrogen atom from the alkyl group to the chromium atom.
3. Release of the alkene.
4. Regeneration of the chromium site through the formation of hydrogen gas.

Regarding the debate about which step is rate-limiting, it varies based on the specific conditions and catalyst. The initial C-H activation step is considered the rate-limiting step in many cases, but there is ongoing discussion about the role of the hydridochromium complex and its ability to regenerate the chromium site efficiently.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it is fundamental to understanding how catalysts work in dehydrogenation processes. It continues to inspire new research aimed at improving catalyst efficiency, understanding reaction pathways, and optimizing reaction conditions. The complexity of the mechanism and the potential for different steps to become rate-limiting under varying conditions make it a rich area of investigation.

霍里图蒂-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤： 
1. 通过 -键互换激活C-H键。
2. 将烷基中的氢原子转移到铬原子上。
3. 释放烯烃。
4. 通过形成氢气再生铬位点。

关于哪一步是决定性的讨论，这取决于具体条件和催化剂。初始C-H激活步骤在许多情况下被认为是决定性的，但关于氢化铬复合物的作用及其再生铬位点的有效性存在持续的讨论。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，霍里图蒂-波兰尼机制仍然是科学研究的一个热点，因为它对理解催化剂如何在脱氢过程中工作至关重要。它继续激发新的研究，旨在提高催化剂效率、理解反应途径并优化反应条件。机制的复杂性和不同步骤在不同条件下成为决定性的可能性使它是一个丰富的研究领域。
