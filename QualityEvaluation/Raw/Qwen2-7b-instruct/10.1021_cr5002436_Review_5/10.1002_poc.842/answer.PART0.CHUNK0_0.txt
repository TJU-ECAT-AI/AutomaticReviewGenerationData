The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main reaction steps: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. An alternative mechanism is also explored, in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex.

The activation free energy of the (1,2,3) cycle as computed for the DeRossi-1 model and CH activation involving the hydroxyl ligand, is computed in the range 266-286 kJ mol1, depending on the point at which the entropy increases associated with desorption of ethene start to outweigh the losses in coordination energy.

However, the water formed in reaction (1) on DeRossi species is likely to desorb, thus preventing regeneration of the chromium species. Activity due to the (1,2,3) cycle is therefore more likely to involve CrO ester linkages to the surface, with formation of a silanol moiety during the initial CH activation step. In this case, weak coordination of silanol to the metal results in a higher electronic energy of the ethyl complex and consequently also of the rate-determining step of the cycle, which involves -hydrogen transfer and ethene desorption.

The increase in energy amounts to about 50 kJ mol1, which appears also in the overall enthalpy and free energy of activation. The lowest values of activation enthalpy and free energy of the (1,2,3) cycle are thus in the order of 200 and 300 kJ mol1, respectively.

An alternative mechanism is apparent from our calculations, in which H2 formation and CH activation take place in a second, concerted reaction between chromium and ethane. Since CH activation takes place at the reactive hydride complex rather than at a fairly stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands, the activation barrier for CH activation becomes markedly lower. Still, the entropy loss associated with chemisorp- tion of ethane contributes to make CH activation the rate determining step for the (4,2) cycle.

Using propane pressure of 5 kN m2 in flow experiments at 500 C, a turnover frequency in the order of 103 molecules s1 per surface Cr atom was observed on Cr silica. On the basis of our computed free energies of activation, turnover frequencies in the order of 101 molecules s1 per hydridochromium complex are obtained for the (4,2) cycle and 109 molecules s1 per (O)3Cr species for the (1,2,3) cycle.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is characterized by three primary steps:

1. **CH Activation**: This step involves the activation of a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond in the alkane molecule through a reaction with the metal catalyst, typically chromium. This process is facilitated by the breaking of the C-H bond and the formation of a new carbon-metal (C-M) bond and a hydrogen-oxygen (H-O) bond.

2. **Hydrogen Transfer**: In the second step, a hydrogen atom is transferred from the alkyl group (formed in the first step) to the metal, resulting in the formation of an alkene molecule and releasing ethene (ethylene) as a product.

3. **Regeneration of the Catalyst**: The final step involves the regeneration of the metal catalyst by reacting with hydrogen gas, releasing water and regenerating the metal to its active form.

An alternative mechanism has been proposed, suggesting that the initial CH activation occurs at a reactive hydridochromium complex rather than at a stable chromium species. This mechanism involves the formation of hydrogen-hydrogen (H-H) and carbon-metal (C-M) bonds through a -bond metathesis reaction, leading to a lower activation barrier for CH activation.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting involves the energy barriers associated with each step and the entropy changes during the reaction. The (1,2,3) cycle, which includes the three primary steps, has an activation energy in the range of 200-300 kJ/mol. The presence of water or silanol molecules during the first step can affect the stability of the catalyst and thus the rate of the reaction.

The (4,2) cycle, where hydrogen is formed and CH activation occurs at a reactive hydridochromium complex, has a lower activation energy of around 70 kJ/mol, making it the rate-determining step for this alternative mechanism.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reactions involved, the sensitivity of the mechanism to the local structure of the catalyst, and the ongoing debates about the rate-limiting steps and the role of different reaction pathways. The detailed analysis of reaction barriers, the influence of surface strain, and the role of surface species in catalytic activity continue to drive research in this area.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制主要包含三个关键步骤：

1. **碳氢键活化**：此步骤涉及烷烃分子中碳氢（C-H）键与催化剂金属（通常是铬）的活化，通过形成新的碳金属（C-M）键和氢氧（H-O）键来实现C-H键的断裂。

2. **氢转移**：第二步中，烷基团中的一个氢原子转移到金属上，形成烯烃分子并释放乙烯作为产物。

3. **催化剂再生**：最后一步涉及通过与氢气反应生成水，从而将金属催化剂再生为活性形式。

提出了一个替代机制，表明初始的C-H活化发生在活性氢化铬复合物上，而不是在稳定的铬物种上。这一机制通过-键互换反应形成了氢-氢（H-H）和碳金属（C-M）键，导致CH活化的激活壁垒降低。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的，争论主要围绕每个步骤的能垒以及反应过程中熵的变化。在包含三个主要步骤的（1,2,3）循环中，激活能量范围在200至300 kJ/mol之间。水或硅醇分子的存在可能会影响催化剂的稳定性，进而影响反应速率。

在（4,2）循环中，氢形成和CH活化发生在活性氢化铬复合物上，其激活能量约为70 kJ/mol，这使得它是替代机制的决定性步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，原因在于反应的复杂性、催化剂局部结构对机制的影响、关于速率限制步骤和不同反应途径作用的持续辩论。对反应壁垒的详细分析、表面张力的影响以及表面物种在催化活性中的作用继续推动该领域的研究。
