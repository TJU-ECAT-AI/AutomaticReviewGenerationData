[1] "A reaction mechanism consisting of the following three reaction steps is found to be viable: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis,accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds,(2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site by means of -bond metathesis with subsequent loss of H2."
[2] "Regeneration of the catalytic cite according to reaction (3) requires the initial CH activation step to involve a CrO ester linkage to the surface."
[3] "Based on the computed energies, an alternative me- chanism is formulated in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex formed in reaction (2) (above), rather than at more stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands."
[4] "The importance of this alternative mechanism relies on the ability to maintain a reactive hydridochromium site, i.e. to prevent formation of more stable species in which chromium is covalently bonded to three oxygen ligands."
[5] "This ability is a sensitive function of the local structure about chromium. On DeRossi-type species, the water molecule formed in reaction (1) is likely to desorb, thus making reformation of the CrO bond less likely."
[6] "On chromium species with three CrO ester linkages to the surface, a silanol moiety, rather than water, is made in the initial CH/ CrO activation."
[7] "At fairly strained surface sites, the silanol can relax away from chromium, and thus hinder reformation of the CrO bond."
[8] "If the silanol moiety remains loosely coordinated to chromium,one must expect facile regeneration of the CrO bond according to reaction (3) above."
[9] "It is conceivable that both mechanisms are at work in active catalysts."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves three main steps: 
1. CH activation of ethane through -bond metathesis, accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds.
2. -H transfer to chromium, resulting in the subsequent loss of ethene.
3. Regeneration of the chromium site through -bond metathesis, leading to the loss of H2.

The regeneration of the chromium site depends on the initial CH activation step involving a CrO ester linkage to the surface. 

An alternative mechanism proposes that CH activation occurs at a reactive hydridochromium complex formed during the second step, rather than at more stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands. This alternative mechanism is significant because it allows for maintaining a reactive hydridochromium site, preventing the formation of more stable chromium-oxygen complexes.

The ability to maintain this reactive state is sensitive to the local structure around chromium. On DeRossi-type species, the water molecule formed in the initial step is likely to desorb, making the reformation of the CrO bond less likely. On species with three CrO ester linkages to the surface, a silanol moiety is formed instead of water during the initial CH/CrO activation. At strained surface sites, the silanol can relax away from chromium, hindering the reformation of the CrO bond. However, if the silanol remains loosely coordinated to chromium, regeneration of the CrO bond is facilitated.

It's possible that both mechanisms operate simultaneously in active catalysts. The presence of moisture in the feed can terminate the hydride-based mechanism.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the ongoing debate over which step is truly rate-limiting and the complexities introduced by different surface structures affecting the reactivity and stability of the chromium species. The intricate interplay between surface chemistry, catalyst design, and reaction kinetics continues to be a subject of intense research and discussion among scientists.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含三个主要步骤：
1. 通过-键重排激活乙烷中的CH，伴随形成OH和CrC键。
2. -H转移到铬上，随后丢失乙烯。
3. 通过-键重排再生铬位点，导致H2的丢失。

根据计算的能量，提出了一个替代机制，在第二个步骤中形成的活性氢化铬复合物作为CH激活的地点，而不是在具有三个氧配体的更稳定的铬物种上。这个替代机制的重要性在于它允许保持活性氢化铬位点，防止形成更稳定的铬-氧复合物。

保持这种活性状态的能力取决于铬周围局部结构的敏感性。在DeRossi类型物种上，初始步骤中形成的水分子很可能会脱附，使得CrO键的重新形成变得不太可能。在表面带有三个CrO酯链接的物种上，初始CH/CrO激活期间会形成一个硅醇基团，而不是水。在受压的表面站点上，硅醇可以远离铬放松，从而阻碍CrO键的重新形成。然而，如果硅醇基团仍然松散地与铬结合，CrO键的再生就会变得容易。

有可能这两种机制同时在活性催化剂中起作用。进料中的微量水分可以终止基于氢的机制。

由于争论哪一步真正决定速率以及不同表面结构对反应活性和稳定性的影响，该机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的热点。表面化学、催化剂设计和反应动力学之间的复杂相互作用继续是科学家们激烈研究和讨论的主题。
