[1] "The calculations were carried out using a tetra- hedral Pt4 cluster to represent small Pt nanoparticles dispersed on a support."
[2] "Using this model we were also able to explore the impact of two substantial modifications on catalyst performance: (a) the partial coverage of the catalyst with H atoms derived from the adsorption of H2 introduced into the feed and (b) the replacement of a single Pt atom by Sn to model the effect of alloying with Sn on the nanoscale."
[3] "We draw the following conclusions:(1) Our studies show that for all alkanes investigated (ethane, propane, butane) and for both Pt4 and Pt3Sn the cleavage of the first CH bond is the rate-determining step."
[4] "The remarkable selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom in combination with low alkene binding energies which decrease even further with increasing temperature."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step, which is considered rate-limiting, involves the cleavage of the first C-H bond. This step determines the overall rate of the reaction. The second step involves the formation of an intermediate species. The third step entails the removal of a second hydrogen atom, and the fourth step is the desorption of the resulting alkene. Despite nearly a century of study, the debate over which step is truly rate-limiting continues. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the precise details of the reaction pathways and the factors influencing the rates of individual steps are still under scrutiny. Researchers continue to investigate how different catalysts and conditions affect the mechanism, aiming to optimize the dehydrogenation process for industrial applications. The findings from the document suggest that the cleavage of the first C-H bond is indeed the rate-limiting step, but the subsequent steps also play crucial roles in determining the overall selectivity and efficiency of the dehydrogenation reaction.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤。第一步被认为是决定性步骤，涉及第一个C-H键的断裂。这一步决定了反应的整体速率。第二步涉及中间物种的形成。第三步是去除第二个氢原子，而第四步是产物烯烃的脱附。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，关于哪个步骤真正是决定性步骤的争论仍然存在。这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为反应路径的具体细节以及影响各个步骤速率的因素仍在审查中。研究人员继续研究不同催化剂和条件对机制的影响，旨在优化脱氢过程以适应工业应用。文献中的发现表明，第一个C-H键的断裂确实是决定性步骤，但后续步骤也对整体选择性和效率具有关键作用。
