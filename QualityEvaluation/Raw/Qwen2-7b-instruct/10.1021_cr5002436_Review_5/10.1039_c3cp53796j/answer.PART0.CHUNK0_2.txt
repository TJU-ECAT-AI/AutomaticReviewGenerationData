[1] "Our studies show that for all alkanes investigated (ethane, propane, butane) and for both Pt4 and Pt3Sn the cleavage of the first CH bond is the rate-determining step."
[2] "The remarkable selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom in combination with low alkene binding energies which decrease even further with increasing temperature."
[3] "The co-feeding of hydrogen, to reduce coking, can be simulated with the Pt4 model. The cluster is stable upon hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without effects induced by changes in cluster geometry."
[4] "Replacement of a single Pt atom by Sn does not change the overall geometry of the model but has strong effects on the reaction pathway. Our results show substitution of a Pt atom by an Sn atom in Pt4 to produce a tetrahedral Pt3Sn cluster adds negative charge to the active Pt site, causing a downward shift in the potential energy surface for the reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely studied process involving four main steps. These steps include adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface, cleavage of the first C-H bond, migration of hydrogen atoms, and finally desorption of the alkene. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying which of these steps is the rate-limiting factor. Some researchers argue that the cleavage of the first C-H bond is the rate-limiting step due to its low activation energy, while others propose that the desorption of the alkene might control the overall reaction rate. The mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy despite extensive research over nearly a century, as understanding the precise details of these steps can lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。这些步骤包括烷烃在催化剂表面吸附、第一个C-H键断裂、氢原子迁移，最后是烯烃的脱附。科学界对哪一步是决定性步骤的争论仍在继续。一些研究人员认为第一个C-H键断裂是决定性步骤，因为它具有较低的活化能，而另一些则认为烯烃的脱附可能控制整个反应速率。尽管该机制在近一个世纪的研究中仍然是一个热点和争议话题，但深入了解这些步骤的细节可以引导我们开发出更高效和选择性的催化剂。
