[1] "Our studies show that for all alkanes investigated (ethane, propane, butane) and for both Pt4 and Pt3Sn the cleavage of the first CH bond is the rate-determining step."
[2] "The remarkable selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom in combination with low alkene binding energies which decrease even further with increasing temperature."
[3] "Replacement of a single Pt atom by Sn does not change the overall geometry of the model but has strong effects on the reaction pathway. Our results show substitution of a Pt atom by an Sn atom in Pt4 to produce a tetrahedral Pt3Sn cluster adds negative charge to the active Pt site, causing a downward shift in the potential energy surface for the reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface.  
2. Cleavage of the first C-H bond.  
3. Migration of the hydrogen atoms.  
4. Desorption of the alkene product. 

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting revolves around the energy barriers associated with each step. The first step of adsorption is often considered fast, and thus, not rate-limiting. The second step, cleavage of the first C-H bond, is typically found to be the rate-determining step due to its relatively low activation energy. The third step, hydrogen migration, can involve multiple possible pathways, some of which might require higher energy inputs. The fourth step, desorption of the alkene, is also influenced by the energy required to overcome the adsorption energy of the alkene on the catalyst. 

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the precise nature of the interactions between the alkane, hydrogen, and catalyst can vary significantly depending on factors such as the catalyst composition, temperature, and pressure. The exact roles of each step in determining the overall reaction kinetics and product selectivity continue to be explored and debated by researchers. The introduction of new catalyst materials, such as Pt-Sn alloys, provides new opportunities to modify the reaction pathway and potentially alter the rate-determining step. These studies help refine our understanding of the mechanisms underlying dehydrogenation reactions and inform the design of more efficient catalysts.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：
1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 第一个C-H键的断裂。
3. 氢原子的迁移。
4. 产物烯烃的脱附。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的持续辩论围绕着每个步骤的能量壁垒。吸附步骤通常被认为很快，因此不是速率限制步骤。第二步，第一个C-H键的断裂，由于其相对较低的活化能，经常被发现是决定速率的步骤。第三步，氢原子的迁移，可能涉及多个可能的途径，其中一些可能需要更高的能量输入。第四步，产物烯烃的脱附，也受到克服烯烃在催化剂上的吸附能所需能量的影响。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为烷烃、氢和催化剂之间的相互作用的性质可以因催化剂组成、温度和压力等因素而显著变化。确定整体反应动力学和产物选择性的确切作用仍然由研究人员探索和争论。引入新的催化剂材料，如Pt-Sn合金，提供了修改反应路径并可能改变决定性步骤的新机会。这些研究有助于细化我们对脱氢反应机制的理解，并指导更高效催化剂的设计。
