[1] "The reaction pathways for the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butane, over Pt are analyzed using density functional theory (DFT)."
[2] "The objectives of this work were to establish which step is rate limiting and which one controls the selectivity for forming alkenes as opposed to causing further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes to produce precursors responsible for catalyst deactivation due to coking."
[3] "Our studies show that for all alkanes investigated (ethane, propane, butane) and for both Pt4 and Pt3Sn the cleavage of the first CH bond is the rate-determining step."
[4] "The remarkable selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom in combination with low alkene binding energies which decrease even further with increasing temperature."
[5] "This comes at the cost of a slightly reduced activity as the presence of hydrogen shifts all transition states to some extent, including the rate-determining first CH cleavage step."
[6] "Replacement of a single Pt atom by Sn does not change the overall geometry of the model but has strong effects on the reaction pathway."
[7] "Our results show substitution of a Pt atom by an Sn atom in Pt4 to produce a tetrahedral Pt3Sn cluster adds negative charge to the active Pt site, causing a downward shift in the potential energy surface for the reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface, cleavage of the first C-H bond, migration of hydrogen atoms, and desorption of the alkene. The ongoing debate in the scientific community centers around whether the cleavage of the first C-H bond or the cleavage of the third C-H bond is considered the rate-limiting step. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy because of the intricate balance between the rates of these steps and their impact on the selectivity for alkene production versus further dehydrogenation leading to catalyst deactivation. The introduction of hydrogen into the feed stream can improve selectivity by shifting the third C-H cleavage step to higher energy, but this comes at the cost of a slightly reduced activity due to the overall shift of transition states caused by hydrogen adsorption. Alloying a Pt catalyst with Sn introduces negative charge to the active site, which causes a downward shift in the potential energy surface, enhancing the activity of the catalyst while maintaining selectivity.

脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：烷烃吸附至催化剂表面，第一个C-H键断裂，氢原子迁移，以及烯烃脱附。科学界对是否第一个C-H键断裂或第三个C-H键断裂是决定性步骤的争论持续存在，尽管已经研究了一个世纪之久。这个机制仍然吸引着研究兴趣和争议，因为这些步骤之间的速率平衡及其对烯烃生产选择性与进一步脱氢导致催化剂失活的影响。向原料中添加氢气可以提高选择性，通过使第三个C-H断裂步骤的能量升高，但这也伴随着活性略有降低，因为氢吸附导致过渡态整体移动。用Sn合金化Pt催化剂会在活性位点引入负电荷，从而导致反应势能表面向下移动，增强催化剂的活性同时保持选择性。
