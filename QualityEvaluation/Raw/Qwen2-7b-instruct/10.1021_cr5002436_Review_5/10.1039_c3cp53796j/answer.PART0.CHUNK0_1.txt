[1] "Our studies show that for all alkanes investigated (ethane, propane, butane) and for both Pt4 and Pt3Sn the cleavage of the first CH bond is the rate-determining step."
[2] "The remarkable selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom in combination with low alkene binding energies which decrease even further with increasing temperature."
[3] "At room temperature and above the desorption of the product alkene is more likely than further CH bond cleavage."
[4] "Replacement of a single Pt atom by Sn does not change the overall geometry of the model but has strong effects on the reaction pathway."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface.
2. Cleavage of the first CH bond, which is identified as the rate-limiting step in this study. 
3. Migration of hydrogen atoms across the surface.
4. Desorption of the alkene product. 

Despite nearly a century of study, the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting persists. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the rate-limiting step can vary depending on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. 

The cleavage of the first CH bond is crucial because it determines the overall speed of the reaction. The study highlights that the third hydrogen atom cleavage step is shifted to higher energy, enhancing selectivity towards alkene production. This comes at the cost of a slightly reduced activity due to the presence of hydrogen, which shifts all transition states to some extent.

Replacing a single Pt atom by Sn in the model does not alter the overall geometry but impacts the reaction pathway. The substitution of a Pt atom by an Sn atom in Pt4 to produce a tetrahedral Pt3Sn cluster adds negative charge to the active Pt site, causing a downward shift in the potential energy surface for the reaction. This results in a higher activity of the catalyst due to the lower net activation barrier for the rate-limiting step.

The reason this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest is due to its practical applications in the production of alkenes from alkanes, which is crucial for commodity and specialty chemical production. The detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism helps in optimizing catalysts and reaction conditions for better efficiency and selectivity.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 烷烃在催化剂表面吸附。
2. 第一个CH键的断裂，这是研究中确定的决定性步骤。  
3. 氢原子在表面的迁移。
4. 产物烯烃的脱附。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，关于哪个步骤被认为是决定性的仍然存在争议。这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为决定性的步骤可能根据特定的催化剂和反应条件而变化。

第一个CH键的断裂至关重要，因为它决定了反应的整体速度。研究强调了第三氢原子断裂步骤能量更高，从而增强了向烯烃生产的高选择性。这以牺牲活性为代价，因为存在氢，会将所有过渡态都转移到一定程度。

在模型中替换单个Pt原子为Sn不会改变整体几何形状，但会影响反应途径。在Pt4中通过将一个Pt原子替换为Sn原子来生成四面体Pt3Sn簇，在活化Pt位点添加负电荷，导致反应势能表面向下移动。这导致催化剂的活性更高，由于速率限制步骤的净激活能更低。

之所以这个机制仍然是科学兴趣的主题，是因为它对从烷烃生产烯烃的实践应用至关重要，这对于商品和特种化学品生产至关重要。深入了解反应机制有助于优化催化剂和反应条件以提高效率和选择性。
