[1] "The reaction pathways for the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butane, over Pt are analyzed using density functional theory (DFT)."
[2] "The objectives of this work were to establish which step is rate limiting and which one controls the selectivity for forming alkenes as opposed to causing further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes to produce precursors responsible for catalyst deactivation due to coking."
[3] "Our studies show that for all alkanes investigated (ethane, propane, butane) and for both Pt4 and Pt3Sn the cleavage of the first CH bond is the rate-determining step."
[4] "The remarkable selectivity towards alkene production is explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third hydrogen atom in combination with low alkene binding energies which decrease even further with increasing temperature."
[5] "This comes at the cost of a slightly reduced activity as the presence of hydrogen shifts all transition states to some extent, including the rate-determining first CH cleavage step."
[6] "Replacement of a single Pt atom by Sn does not change the overall geometry of the model but has strong effects on the reaction pathway."
[7] "Our results show substitution of a Pt atom by an Sn atom in Pt4 to produce a tetrahedral Pt3Sn cluster adds negative charge to the active Pt site, causing a downward shift in the potential energy surface for the reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface, cleavage of the first C-H bond, migration of hydrogen atoms, and desorption of the alkene. The ongoing debate in the scientific community centers around whether the cleavage of the first C-H bond or the cleavage of the third C-H bond is considered the rate-limiting step. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy because of the intricate balance between the rates of these steps and their impact on the selectivity for alkene production versus further dehydrogenation leading to catalyst deactivation. The introduction of hydrogen into the feed stream can improve selectivity by shifting the third C-H cleavage step to higher energy, but this comes at the cost of a slightly reduced activity due to the overall shift of transition states caused by hydrogen adsorption. Alloying a Pt catalyst with Sn introduces negative charge to the active site, which causes a downward shift in the potential energy surface, enhancing the activity of the catalyst while maintaining selectivity.

脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：烷烃吸附至催化剂表面，第一个C-H键断裂，氢原子迁移，以及烯烃脱附。科学界对是否第一个C-H键断裂或第三个C-H键断裂是决定性步骤的争论持续存在，尽管已经研究了一个世纪之久。这个机制仍然吸引着研究兴趣和争议，因为这些步骤之间的速率平衡及其对烯烃生产选择性与进一步脱氢导致催化剂失活的影响。向原料中添加氢气可以提高选择性，通过使第三个C-H断裂步骤的能量升高，但这也伴随着活性略有降低，因为氢吸附导致过渡态整体移动。用Sn合金化Pt催化剂会在活性位点引入负电荷，从而导致反应势能表面向下移动，增强催化剂的活性同时保持选择性。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface.
2. Cleavage of the first CH bond, which is identified as the rate-limiting step in this study. 
3. Migration of hydrogen atoms across the surface.
4. Desorption of the alkene product. 

Despite nearly a century of study, the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting persists. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the rate-limiting step can vary depending on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. 

The cleavage of the first CH bond is crucial because it determines the overall speed of the reaction. The study highlights that the third hydrogen atom cleavage step is shifted to higher energy, enhancing selectivity towards alkene production. This comes at the cost of a slightly reduced activity due to the presence of hydrogen, which shifts all transition states to some extent.

Replacing a single Pt atom by Sn in the model does not alter the overall geometry but impacts the reaction pathway. The substitution of a Pt atom by an Sn atom in Pt4 to produce a tetrahedral Pt3Sn cluster adds negative charge to the active Pt site, causing a downward shift in the potential energy surface for the reaction. This results in a higher activity of the catalyst due to the lower net activation barrier for the rate-limiting step.

The reason this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest is due to its practical applications in the production of alkenes from alkanes, which is crucial for commodity and specialty chemical production. The detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism helps in optimizing catalysts and reaction conditions for better efficiency and selectivity.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 烷烃在催化剂表面吸附。
2. 第一个CH键的断裂，这是研究中确定的决定性步骤。  
3. 氢原子在表面的迁移。
4. 产物烯烃的脱附。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，关于哪个步骤被认为是决定性的仍然存在争议。这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为决定性的步骤可能根据特定的催化剂和反应条件而变化。

第一个CH键的断裂至关重要，因为它决定了反应的整体速度。研究强调了第三氢原子断裂步骤能量更高，从而增强了向烯烃生产的高选择性。这以牺牲活性为代价，因为存在氢，会将所有过渡态都转移到一定程度。

在模型中替换单个Pt原子为Sn不会改变整体几何形状，但会影响反应途径。在Pt4中通过将一个Pt原子替换为Sn原子来生成四面体Pt3Sn簇，在活化Pt位点添加负电荷，导致反应势能表面向下移动。这导致催化剂的活性更高，由于速率限制步骤的净激活能更低。

之所以这个机制仍然是科学兴趣的主题，是因为它对从烷烃生产烯烃的实践应用至关重要，这对于商品和特种化学品生产至关重要。深入了解反应机制有助于优化催化剂和反应条件以提高效率和选择性。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely studied process involving four main steps. These steps include adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface, cleavage of the first C-H bond, migration of hydrogen atoms, and finally desorption of the alkene. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying which of these steps is the rate-limiting factor. Some researchers argue that the cleavage of the first C-H bond is the rate-limiting step due to its low activation energy, while others propose that the desorption of the alkene might control the overall reaction rate. The mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy despite extensive research over nearly a century, as understanding the precise details of these steps can lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface.  
2. Cleavage of the first C-H bond.  
3. Migration of the hydrogen atoms.  
4. Desorption of the alkene product. 

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting revolves around the energy barriers associated with each step. The first step of adsorption is often considered fast, and thus, not rate-limiting. The second step, cleavage of the first C-H bond, is typically found to be the rate-determining step due to its relatively low activation energy. The third step, hydrogen migration, can involve multiple possible pathways, some of which might require higher energy inputs. The fourth step, desorption of the alkene, is also influenced by the energy required to overcome the adsorption energy of the alkene on the catalyst. 

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the precise nature of the interactions between the alkane, hydrogen, and catalyst can vary significantly depending on factors such as the catalyst composition, temperature, and pressure. The exact roles of each step in determining the overall reaction kinetics and product selectivity continue to be explored and debated by researchers. The introduction of new catalyst materials, such as Pt-Sn alloys, provides new opportunities to modify the reaction pathway and potentially alter the rate-determining step. These studies help refine our understanding of the mechanisms underlying dehydrogenation reactions and inform the design of more efficient catalysts.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：
1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 第一个C-H键的断裂。
3. 氢原子的迁移。
4. 产物烯烃的脱附。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的持续辩论围绕着每个步骤的能量壁垒。吸附步骤通常被认为很快，因此不是速率限制步骤。第二步，第一个C-H键的断裂，由于其相对较低的活化能，经常被发现是决定速率的步骤。第三步，氢原子的迁移，可能涉及多个可能的途径，其中一些可能需要更高的能量输入。第四步，产物烯烃的脱附，也受到克服烯烃在催化剂上的吸附能所需能量的影响。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为烷烃、氢和催化剂之间的相互作用的性质可以因催化剂组成、温度和压力等因素而显著变化。确定整体反应动力学和产物选择性的确切作用仍然由研究人员探索和争论。引入新的催化剂材料，如Pt-Sn合金，提供了修改反应路径并可能改变决定性步骤的新机会。这些研究有助于细化我们对脱氢反应机制的理解，并指导更高效催化剂的设计。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step, which is considered rate-limiting, involves the cleavage of the first C-H bond. This step determines the overall rate of the reaction. The second step involves the formation of an intermediate species. The third step entails the removal of a second hydrogen atom, and the fourth step is the desorption of the resulting alkene. Despite nearly a century of study, the debate over which step is truly rate-limiting continues. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the precise details of the reaction pathways and the factors influencing the rates of individual steps are still under scrutiny. Researchers continue to investigate how different catalysts and conditions affect the mechanism, aiming to optimize the dehydrogenation process for industrial applications. The findings from the document suggest that the cleavage of the first C-H bond is indeed the rate-limiting step, but the subsequent steps also play crucial roles in determining the overall selectivity and efficiency of the dehydrogenation reaction.
