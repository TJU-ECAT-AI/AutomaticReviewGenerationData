[1] "Light alkane dehydrogenation was investigated over a series of mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts containing 215 wt.% chromia, synthesized via the supramolecular templating technique."
[2] "Depending on chromia loading, chromium was found to be present essentially as two surface species, each possessing one short terminal Cr O bond and polymeric species."
[3] "UVvis and XPS studies revealed that the surface chromium occurs in two chemical states as Cr(III) and Cr(VI) species."
[4] "Investigation of ethane and propane adsorption by in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (DRIFT) revealed the formation of adsorbed acetaldehyde, acetone, formate and acetate."
[5] "During the dehydrogenation reaction, acetate/carboxylate and hydrocarbon species were detected."
[6] "Under otherwise the same conditions, the alkane dehydrogenation activity increased with increasing chromia loading."
[7] "The activity of regenerated catalysts was found to be lower than the corresponding fresh catalysts, suggesting that the deactivation is partly permanent."
[8] "Detailed characterization studies of spent and regenerated catalysts indicated that the formation of subsurface Cr(III) species during dehydrogenation may be the reason for the permanently lost activity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the alkane by breaking the C-H bonds, (3) formation of an intermediate compound, and (4) desorption of the resulting product. The ongoing debate in the scientific community concerns which of these steps is rate-limiting. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because it is complex and influenced by multiple factors including catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and product inhibition. The mechanism's complexity and the interplay between these factors make it challenging to pinpoint the exact rate-limiting step.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：（1）烷烃在催化剂表面吸附，（2）通过断裂C-H键激活烷烃，（3）形成中间化合物，（4）产物从催化剂表面脱附。科学界对哪个步骤是速率限制步骤存在持续的争论。尽管该机制的研究已有近一个世纪的历史，但它仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的主题。由于机制的复杂性以及催化剂性质、反应条件和产物抑制等因素的影响，确定确切的速率限制步骤极具挑战性。
