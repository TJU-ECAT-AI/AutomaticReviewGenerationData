The document does not contain information related to the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, its four main steps, the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting, or why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study. Therefore, I am unable to provide answers to the questions based on the provided text.

文档中没有包含与催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制、其四个主要步骤、被认为速率限制步骤的争论，以及尽管该机制在近一个世纪的研究后仍是一个科学兴趣和争议话题的原因相关的信息。因此，我无法基于提供的文本回答这些问题。
