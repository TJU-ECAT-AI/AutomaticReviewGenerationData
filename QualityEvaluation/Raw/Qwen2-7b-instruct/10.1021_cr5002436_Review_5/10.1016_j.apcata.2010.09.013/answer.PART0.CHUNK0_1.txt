[1] "Light alkane dehydrogenation was investigated over a series of mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts containing 215 wt.% chromia, synthesized via the supramolecular templating technique."
[2] "Depending on chromia loading, chromium was found to be present essentially as two surface species, each possessing one short terminal Cr O bond and polymeric species."
[3] "UVvis and XPS studies revealed that the surface chromium occurs in two chemical states as Cr(III) and Cr(VI) species."
[4] "Investigation of ethane and propane adsorption by in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (DRIFT) revealed the formation of adsorbed acetaldehyde, acetone, formate and acetate."
[5] "Under otherwise the same conditions, the alkane dehydrogenation activity increased with increasing chromia loading."
[6] "Detailed characterization studies of spent and regenerated catalysts indicated that the formation of subsurface Cr(III) species during dehydrogenation may be the reason for the permanently lost activity."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. First, the activation of the substrate molecule by the catalyst. Second, the breaking of the substrate molecule's bonds by the catalyst. Third, the migration of the activated fragments across the catalyst surface. Fourth, the formation of the product molecules. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting has led to various interpretations of the mechanism. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the exact role of the catalyst in the activation and migration steps is still not fully understood. The mechanism's complexity and the difficulty in observing the intermediate states make it a challenging subject for researchers.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤。第一步，催化剂活化底物分子。第二步，催化剂破坏底物分子的化学键。第三步，激活片段在催化剂表面迁移。第四步，形成产物分子。关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论导致了对该机制的不同解释。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但该机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为催化剂在激活和迁移步骤中的确切作用仍然不完全清楚。由于机制的复杂性和观察中间态的困难性，这使得它对研究人员来说是一个具有挑战性的主题。
