The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane molecule, formation of an intermediate species, decomposition of the intermediate to form the desired product, and release of any byproducts. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still an area of scientific interest and controversy, as the kinetics of each step can vary significantly depending on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. Despite nearly a century of study, the precise rate-limiting step remains uncertain.

Regenerated catalysts, after being used for dehydrogenation reactions, showed lower activity compared to fresh catalysts. This indicates that some active sites have been deactivated during the dehydrogenation process. Detailed characterization studies revealed that during alkane dehydrogenation, a portion of the chromium species gets converted to inactive Cr(III) species, which cannot be fully converted back to higher oxidation states during the regeneration process. This is believed to contribute to the partial irreversible loss of activity in the catalysts.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：烷烃分子中氢原子的抽象，中间物种的形成，中间物种分解以形成所需产物，以及释放任何副产品。关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的争论仍然是科学兴趣和争议的领域，因为每个步骤的热力学在不同的催化剂和反应条件下可以变化很大。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但确切的速率限制步骤仍不确定。

再生催化剂，在用于脱氢反应后，其活性低于新鲜催化剂。这表明一些活性位点在脱氢过程中已经被失活。详细表征研究表明，在烷烃脱氢过程中，部分铬物种被转化为不可达的Cr(III)物种，这些物种无法在再生过程中完全转化为更高氧化状态。这被认为是催化剂活性部分不可逆损失的原因。
