[1] "The kinetics of isobutane dehydrogenation was studied on a chromia/alumina catalyst developed for fluidized-bed operation."
[2] "The results of the kinetic modeling suggested that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions."
[3] "A satisfactory description of the reaction rate depended on inclusion of the isobutene and hydrogen adsorption parameters in the mathematical model."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. It begins with the adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface. Next, the alkane dissociates, forming an alkyl group and a hydrogen atom. The alkyl group then reacts with another catalyst site, usually involving a chromium ion, to form an alkene. Finally, the hydrogen atom combines with the alkene to form a hydrogen molecule, which desorbs from the surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting revolves around the specifics of the reaction mechanism, particularly whether the adsorption or the surface reaction is the bottleneck. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the interactions between the reactants and the catalyst surface. The rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation of isobutane on the chromia/alumina catalyst was found to be isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions. The inclusion of isobutene and hydrogen adsorption parameters in the kinetic model was crucial for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate. The estimated activation energy for the reaction was 133-142 kJ/mol.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤。首先，烷烃吸附到催化剂表面。接着，烷烃分解，形成一个烷基团和一个氢原子。烷基团随后与另一个催化剂位点反应，通常涉及到一个铬离子，以形成一个烯烃。最后，氢原子与烯烃结合形成氢分子，并从表面脱附。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论集中在反应机制的具体细节上，特别是吸附或表面反应是否是瓶颈。尽管这一机制在近一个世纪的研究中仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，主要是由于反应物与催化剂表面之间复杂相互作用的复杂性。在铬氧化铝催化剂上进行的异丁烷脱氢的研究表明，决定速率的关键步骤可能是异丁烷的吸附，可能发生在一对铬和氧离子上。为了对反应速率进行满意描述，需要在动力学模型中包括异丁烯和氢的吸附参数。估计的反应活化能为133至142千焦/摩尔。
