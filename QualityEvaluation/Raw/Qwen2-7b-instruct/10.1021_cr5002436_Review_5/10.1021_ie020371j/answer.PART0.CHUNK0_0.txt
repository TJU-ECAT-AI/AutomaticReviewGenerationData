[1] "The kinetics of isobutane dehydrogenation was studied on a chromia/alumina catalyst developed for fluidized-bed operation."
[2] "The results of the kinetic modeling suggested that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions."
[3] "The activation energy of the dehydrogenation reaction was estimated to be 133142 kJ/mol."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule (often involving bond breaking), surface reaction leading to the formation of the desired product, and desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting depends on the specific reaction and catalyst system. In the context of the study discussed, the rate-determining step appears to be isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions. The activation energy for this rate-determining step is estimated to be 133142 kJ/mol. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the exact details of the reaction pathways and the role of different steps can vary widely depending on the reactants, catalyst, and operating conditions.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面，分子活化（通常涉及键断裂），表面反应导致目标产物形成，以及产物从催化剂表面脱附。关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的争论取决于特定的反应和催化剂系统。在讨论的研究中，速率决定步骤似乎为异丁烷吸附，可能在铬和氧离子对上。该速率决定步骤的活化能估计为133142 kJ/mol。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为不同步骤的确切细节以及它们的作用可以因反应物、催化剂和操作条件而变化。
