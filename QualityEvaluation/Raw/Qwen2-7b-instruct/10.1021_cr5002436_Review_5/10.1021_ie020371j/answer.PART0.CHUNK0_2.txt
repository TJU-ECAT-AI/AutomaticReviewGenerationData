[1] "The kinetics of isobutane dehydrogenation was studied on a chromia/alumina catalyst developed for fluidized-bed operation."
[2] "The results of the kinetic modeling suggested that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions."
[3] "The activation energy of the dehydrogenation reaction was estimated to be 133142 kJ/mol."
[4] "The lowest SSR value of 24 was obtained with models II-a, III-a, and III-b."
[5] "The finding that the isobutane adsorption term was not required in the equations for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate supports a model with adsorption of isobutane as the slow step."
[6] "The results suggest that the adsorption requires only one site because squaring the denominator did not improve the description."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface, activation of the substrate by breaking its chemical bonds, reaction of the activated substrate with other molecules or the catalyst itself, and desorption of the product. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is influenced by the specifics of the catalyst and the reaction conditions. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the interactions between the substrate, catalyst, and reactants. The study of the kinetic modeling suggests that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly involving dissociation on a CrO pair. The isobutene and hydrogen adsorption parameters are crucial for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate. The activation energy for the dehydrogenation reaction is estimated to be around 133-142 kJ/mol. The finding that the isobutane adsorption term was not required in the equations for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate supports a model with adsorption of isobutane as the slow step. This model requires only one site for adsorption, which aligns with the suggestion that dissociative adsorption of the alkane determines the rate of isobutane dehydrogenation on supported Pt/Sn catalysts and molecular adsorption of the alkane determines the rate of propane dehydrogenation on silicalite-supported zinc oxide.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：底物吸附至催化剂表面、底物化学键的激活、活性底物与其它分子或催化剂本身的反应，以及产物的脱附。关于哪个步骤是速率限制性步骤的争论受到催化剂和反应条件的具体影响。尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，由于底物、催化剂和反应物之间复杂相互作用的复杂性。动力学建模的结果表明，速率决定步骤可能是异丁烷吸附，可能在铬和氧离子对上进行。异丁烯和氢的吸附参数对于描述反应速率是必要的。异丁烷吸附项不在方程中被要求，以获得对反应速率的满意描述，支持了一个模型，该模型将异丁烷吸附作为缓慢步骤。该模型仅需要一个位点进行吸附，这与推测分子吸附确定异丁烷在支持的Pt/Sn催化剂上的脱氢速率以及分子吸附确定异丁烷在硅酸盐支持的锌氧化物上的脱氢速率一致。该研究估计脱氢反应的活化能约为133-142千焦/摩尔。发现异丁烷吸附项在方程中不需要，以对反应速率的描述提供满意的结果，支持了异丁烷吸附作为缓慢步骤的模型。该模型仅需要一个位点进行吸附，这与推测分子吸附确定异丁烷在支持的Pt/Sn催化剂上的脱氢速率以及分子吸附确定异丁烷在硅酸盐支持的锌氧化物上的脱氢速率一致。
