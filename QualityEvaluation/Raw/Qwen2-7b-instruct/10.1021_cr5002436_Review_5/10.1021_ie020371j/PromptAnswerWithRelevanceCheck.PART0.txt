[1] "The kinetics of isobutane dehydrogenation was studied on a chromia/alumina catalyst developed for fluidized-bed operation."
[2] "The results of the kinetic modeling suggested that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions."
[3] "The activation energy of the dehydrogenation reaction was estimated to be 133142 kJ/mol."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule (often involving bond breaking), surface reaction leading to the formation of the desired product, and desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting depends on the specific reaction and catalyst system. In the context of the study discussed, the rate-determining step appears to be isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions. The activation energy for this rate-determining step is estimated to be 133142 kJ/mol. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the exact details of the reaction pathways and the role of different steps can vary widely depending on the reactants, catalyst, and operating conditions.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面，分子活化（通常涉及键断裂），表面反应导致目标产物形成，以及产物从催化剂表面脱附。关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的争论取决于特定的反应和催化剂系统。在讨论的研究中，速率决定步骤似乎为异丁烷吸附，可能在铬和氧离子对上。该速率决定步骤的活化能估计为133142 kJ/mol。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为不同步骤的确切细节以及它们的作用可以因反应物、催化剂和操作条件而变化。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. It begins with the adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface. Next, the alkane dissociates, forming an alkyl group and a hydrogen atom. The alkyl group then reacts with another catalyst site, usually involving a chromium ion, to form an alkene. Finally, the hydrogen atom combines with the alkene to form a hydrogen molecule, which desorbs from the surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting revolves around the specifics of the reaction mechanism, particularly whether the adsorption or the surface reaction is the bottleneck. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the interactions between the reactants and the catalyst surface. The rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation of isobutane on the chromia/alumina catalyst was found to be isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions. The inclusion of isobutene and hydrogen adsorption parameters in the kinetic model was crucial for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate. The estimated activation energy for the reaction was 133-142 kJ/mol.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤。首先，烷烃吸附到催化剂表面。接着，烷烃分解，形成一个烷基团和一个氢原子。烷基团随后与另一个催化剂位点反应，通常涉及到一个铬离子，以形成一个烯烃。最后，氢原子与烯烃结合形成氢分子，并从表面脱附。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论集中在反应机制的具体细节上，特别是吸附或表面反应是否是瓶颈。尽管这一机制在近一个世纪的研究中仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，主要是由于反应物与催化剂表面之间复杂相互作用的复杂性。在铬氧化铝催化剂上进行的异丁烷脱氢的研究表明，决定速率的关键步骤可能是异丁烷的吸附，可能发生在一对铬和氧离子上。为了对反应速率进行满意描述，需要在动力学模型中包括异丁烯和氢的吸附参数。估计的反应活化能为133至142千焦/摩尔。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface, activation of the substrate by breaking its chemical bonds, reaction of the activated substrate with other molecules or the catalyst itself, and desorption of the product. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is influenced by the specifics of the catalyst and the reaction conditions. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the interactions between the substrate, catalyst, and reactants. The study of the kinetic modeling suggests that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly involving dissociation on a CrO pair. The isobutene and hydrogen adsorption parameters are crucial for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate. The activation energy for the dehydrogenation reaction is estimated to be around 133-142 kJ/mol. The finding that the isobutane adsorption term was not required in the equations for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate supports a model with adsorption of isobutane as the slow step. This model requires only one site for adsorption, which aligns with the suggestion that dissociative adsorption of the alkane determines the rate of isobutane dehydrogenation on supported Pt/Sn catalysts and molecular adsorption of the alkane determines the rate of propane dehydrogenation on silicalite-supported zinc oxide.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：底物吸附至催化剂表面、底物化学键的激活、活性底物与其它分子或催化剂本身的反应，以及产物的脱附。关于哪个步骤是速率限制性步骤的争论受到催化剂和反应条件的具体影响。尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，由于底物、催化剂和反应物之间复杂相互作用的复杂性。动力学建模的结果表明，速率决定步骤可能是异丁烷吸附，可能在铬和氧离子对上进行。异丁烯和氢的吸附参数对于描述反应速率是必要的。异丁烷吸附项不在方程中被要求，以获得对反应速率的满意描述，支持了一个模型，该模型将异丁烷吸附作为缓慢步骤。该模型仅需要一个位点进行吸附，这与推测分子吸附确定异丁烷在支持的Pt/Sn催化剂上的脱氢速率以及分子吸附确定异丁烷在硅酸盐支持的锌氧化物上的脱氢速率一致。该研究估计脱氢反应的活化能约为133-142千焦/摩尔。发现异丁烷吸附项在方程中不需要，以对反应速率的描述提供满意的结果，支持了异丁烷吸附作为缓慢步骤的模型。该模型仅需要一个位点进行吸附，这与推测分子吸附确定异丁烷在支持的Pt/Sn催化剂上的脱氢速率以及分子吸附确定异丁烷在硅酸盐支持的锌氧化物上的脱氢速率一致。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, also known as the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, describes catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It comprises four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecules onto the catalyst surface, surface reaction between the adsorbed molecules, desorption of the products from the catalyst surface, and diffusion of the products away from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often centers around the first step, adsorption, as it can vary significantly depending on the nature of the catalyst and the reactants. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it influences the overall efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. Understanding the specifics of each step can help optimize reaction conditions and catalyst design for improved performance in industrial applications.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. These steps include adsorption of the alkane molecule, subsequent dissociation, reaction of the alkyl group, and finally, desorption of the alkene and hydrogen products. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying which of these steps is the rate-limiting process. The kinetic modeling of the isobutane dehydrogenation process on a chromia/alumina catalyst, as described in the document, suggests that the rate-determining step is the adsorption of isobutane, potentially occurring on a CrO pair. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the potential for multiple steps to influence the overall rate of the reaction. The high activation energy estimated for the dehydrogenation process further highlights the importance of understanding the precise mechanism and identifying the rate-limiting step for optimizing catalytic performance.
