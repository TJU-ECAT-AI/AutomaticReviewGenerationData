[1] "The kinetics of isobutane dehydrogenation was studied on a chromia/alumina catalyst developed for fluidized-bed operation."
[2] "The results of the kinetic modeling suggested that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions."
[3] "A satisfactory description of the reaction rate depended on inclusion of the isobutene and hydrogen adsorption parameters in the mathematical model."
[4] "The activation energy of the dehydrogenation reaction was estimated to be 133142 kJ/mol."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. These steps include adsorption of the alkane molecule, subsequent dissociation, reaction of the alkyl group, and finally, desorption of the alkene and hydrogen products. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying which of these steps is the rate-limiting process. The kinetic modeling of the isobutane dehydrogenation process on a chromia/alumina catalyst, as described in the document, suggests that the rate-determining step is the adsorption of isobutane, potentially occurring on a CrO pair. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the potential for multiple steps to influence the overall rate of the reaction. The high activation energy estimated for the dehydrogenation process further highlights the importance of understanding the precise mechanism and identifying the rate-limiting step for optimizing catalytic performance.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，涉及四个主要步骤。这些步骤包括烷烃分子的吸附、随后的离解、烷基团的反应以及最终烯烃和氢产品的脱附。科学界围绕确定这些步骤中的哪一个是最关键的步骤而展开争论。文档中描述的在流化床操作设计的氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂上进行的异丁烷脱氢动力学研究结果表明，决定性步骤可能是异丁烷的吸附，可能发生在铬和氧离子对上。这一机制仍然是科学界的兴趣点和争议所在，因为反应路径的复杂性以及多个步骤可能影响反应总体速率。估计的脱氢过程高活化能进一步强调了理解精确机制并识别关键步骤对于优化催化剂性能的重要性。
