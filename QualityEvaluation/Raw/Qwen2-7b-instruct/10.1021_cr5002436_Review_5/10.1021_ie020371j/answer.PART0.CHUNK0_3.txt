[1] "The kinetics of isobutane dehydrogenation was studied on a chromia/alumina catalyst developed for fluidized-bed operation."
[2] "The results of the kinetic modeling suggested that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions."
[3] "The activation energy of the dehydrogenation reaction was estimated to be 133142 kJ/mol."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, also known as the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, describes catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It comprises four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecules onto the catalyst surface, surface reaction between the adsorbed molecules, desorption of the products from the catalyst surface, and diffusion of the products away from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often centers around the first step, adsorption, as it can vary significantly depending on the nature of the catalyst and the reactants. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it influences the overall efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. Understanding the specifics of each step can help optimize reaction conditions and catalyst design for improved performance in industrial applications.

霍里图-波兰尼机制，也被称为朗缪尔-希恩伍德机制，描述了催化脱氢反应。它包含四个主要步骤：反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面，吸附在催化剂表面之间的表面反应，产品从催化剂表面的脱附，以及产物从催化剂表面扩散。对于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的争论往往集中在第一步，吸附上，因为它会根据催化剂和反应物的性质而有很大变化。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但该机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为它影响了反应的整体效率和选择性。了解每个步骤的具体情况可以帮助优化反应条件和催化剂设计以提高性能。
