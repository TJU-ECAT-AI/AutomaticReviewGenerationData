          1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four primary stages: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule through bond breaking, formation of an intermediate compound, and desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface. The question of which of these steps acts as the rate-determining factor continues to be a subject of scientific discussion and contention for almost a century.
          
          2. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a point of scientific interest due to the ongoing debate over the precise roles and kinetics of each step. Despite considerable research efforts, the specific functions and mechanisms underlying these steps are still sources of debate among experts in the field.
