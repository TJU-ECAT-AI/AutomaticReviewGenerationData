Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. These steps are:
1. Adsorption of the reactant onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the adsorbed reactant through breaking of chemical bonds.
3. Formation of an intermediate species on the catalyst surface.
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface.

Despite nearly a century of study, the debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting continues. This is because the mechanism's kinetics can vary significantly depending on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the specific catalyst used. As a result, the relative rates of the individual steps can change, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact rate-limiting step.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its relevance in industrial processes and its complexity. Understanding the precise kinetics and mechanisms involved can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts and processes, which could have significant economic and environmental impacts. The ongoing research aims to clarify the role of each step in the mechanism and optimize reaction conditions for better performance.
