JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS 9,154-165 (1967)

The dehydrogenation reaction of n-butane over chromia-alumina has been kinetically investigated employing the differential reactor technique at temperatures ranging from 510 to 550C. The runs were performed on n-butane and on mixtures of n-butane + 1-butene or n-butane + hydrogen, in the presence of an inert gas (nitrogen), with complete analysis of reaction products. The reaction rate data fit satisfactorily the dual-site mechanism.

A set of runs have been made on 10% chromia catalyst, containing different amounts of Liz0 or NazO. The progressive addition of Liz0 gave a continuous deactivation of the catalyst, while the progressive addition of NazO gave a deactivation followed by an activation.

A general scheme of n-butane dehydrogenation can be written as follows: distribution of butenes is largely dominated by the equilibrium conditions and therefore it is difficult to establish if one of the butenes is preferentially formed from n-butane. On the other hand, from the data of Table 4 it appears that the experimental ratios (C/E) and (T/E) are generally smaller than the equilibrium ones. This fact seems to indicate that 2-butenes have a slightly higher dehydrogenation rate than 1-butene.

The kinetic mechanism for the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction was selected by analysis of the influence of the reactant partial pressure on reaction rate. The trend of the experimental data of Table 3, graphically reported in Fig. 4, suggests that the rate-determining step is the surface reaction,which involves two adjacent active centers (dual-site). 

The experimental reaction rate data confirm the validity of the Langmuir- Hinshelwood scheme for the description of the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction. The kinetic mechanism of the reaction reveals that the rate-determining step is the surface reaction with a dual-site mechanism.

For feeding mixtures of n-butane, nitrogen, and a component i (1-butene or hydrogen), Eq. (4), by taking into account that the partial pressure of n-butane was kept constant, can be written: (PB - PAPH/K) = (1 + bBPB + biPBRi)^2. This equation can be rearranged as follows: (PB - PAPH/K) / (1 + bBPB) = 1 + &Ri. Such plots are reported in Figs. 6 and 7 for the runs corresponding to mixtures of n-butane and 1-butene and mixtures of n-butane and hydrogen, respectively.

The application of the t test to their regression coefficients gave probability values less than 1%. Therefore it derives that also the runs performed with addition of a reaction product to the feeding mixture are consistent with the dual-site mechanism.

The adsorption equilibrium constants bA and ba were obtained from the parameters of the straight lines of Figs. 6 and 7 and from the values of k, and bg given in Table 5.

The proposed reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 10, where 8 and @ indicate the electrons and the holes on the catalyst surface, respectively.

At the equilibrium we have klPn = k-m4na+ + knnAne, ksna = k#.@Le = rE, and rn being the desorption rate of n-butane, that is the rate of the overall process.

The formation of divalent chromium ions on the catalyst can be due to a catalyst partial reduction. Measurements of electrical conductivity of chromia-alumina catalysts as a function of temperature showed that the catalyst is a semiconductor with amphoteric nature.

The proposed reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 10, where 8 and @ indicate the electrons and the holes on the catalyst surface, respectively.

If na indicates the surface concentration of the ith species, for low coverage, that is for ne >> nA, we obtain the following relations: dn.i/dt = klPB - k-lnAnH+ - kznAn@, dna/dt = kznAn@ - k3nR.

Both ne and nn+ depend on the position of the Fermi level pLF of the solid and therefore also the reaction rate is affected by the value of the Fermi level. Since ne increases by increasing PF, while it is possible to show that the concentration of a species bound to the catalyst surface with a strong donor bond (H-0) decreases by increasing PF, then globally the reaction rate should follow the variation of PF.

The previous analysis can be useful for the interpretation of the influence of the impurities added to the catalyst on its activity.

The relative concentration of impurities in reticular or interstitial position is largely dominated by the values of the impurity and host ion radii.

For the system under consideration, the values of ionic radii are as follows: A13+, 0.50; Cr3+, 0.69; Li+, 0.60; Na+, 0.95. From these values, it derives that Li+ ions can substitute both Cr3+ and A13+ ions in the lattice much better than Na+ ions.

The monovalent alkaline atom present in a reticular position acts as an electron acceptor, because it provides to the system only one electron, while the communal sharing system demands three @I). The indispensable two electrons will be extracted from the normal electronic distribution of the crystal, leaving two partially free positive holes able to wander in the neighborhood of the defect.

On the other hand, a monovalent largely electropositive atom in an interstitial position acts as an electron donor, giving to the system one electron.

The previous analysis seems to confirm the experimental results shown in Fig. 2; in fact, the addition of lithium, that acts as an electron acceptor and decreases PF, gives at every concentration a decrease of catalyst activity.

The addition of sodium gives a decrease of activity if its concentration is small and then it acts as an electron acceptor, followed by an increase of the activity at the higher concentrations, at which it acts as an electron donor.

The influence of the impurities added to the catalyst on its activity remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule, reaction with a catalyst surface site, desorption of the product molecule, and regeneration of the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around which of these steps is the rate-limiting step, with some researchers arguing for adsorption, others for reaction, and still others for desorption or regeneration. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reactions involved and the dynamic nature of the catalyst surface.

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four primary stages:吸附反应物分子，与催化剂表面位点反应，产物分子脱附，以及催化剂表面再生。科学界关于哪一步是决定速率的关键步骤存在争议，一些研究者认为是吸附阶段，另一些认为是反应阶段，还有人认为是脱附或再生阶段。尽管这一机制已被研究了近一个世纪，但其仍是一个科学兴趣和争议的焦点，原因在于反应的复杂性和催化剂表面的动态性质。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the substrate molecule, often involving the breaking of a chemical bond.
3. Formation of an intermediate species on the catalyst surface.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often centers around the activation step, as it requires the highest energy input and thus significantly influences the overall reaction rate. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the interactions between the substrate molecules, the catalyst surface, and the energy barriers involved in the activation and desorption processes. These factors contribute to the dynamic and multifaceted nature of catalytic reactions, leading to debates on the precise mechanisms and rate-limiting steps.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism itself is characterized by its dual-site nature, where the surface reaction involves two adjacent active centers on the catalyst. This dual-site mechanism explains the observed rate acceleration in dehydrogenation reactions, as it allows for the simultaneous processing of multiple substrate molecules, thereby increasing the overall reaction rate.

The progressive addition of lithium oxide (Liz0) to the catalyst leads to continuous deactivation, whereas the addition of sodium oxide (NazO) initially causes deactivation but subsequently results in activation. This observation supports the hypothesis that the electronic properties of the catalyst play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process. Changes in the Fermi level (PF) of the solid, influenced by the addition of impurities, affect the reaction rate by altering the availability of electrons and holes on the catalyst surface. This, in turn, impacts the adsorption and desorption processes of substrate and product molecules, influencing the rate-limiting step in the reaction.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：
1. 基质分子在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 基质分子的活化，通常涉及化学键的断裂。
3. 在催化剂表面上形成中间物种。
4. 产品分子从催化剂表面的脱附。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论往往集中在激活步骤上，因为它需要最高的能量输入，并且显著影响整体反应速率。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这个机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，原因在于基质分子、催化剂表面以及激活和脱附过程中涉及的能量壁垒之间的复杂相互作用。这些因素导致催化反应的动态和多面性质，从而引发有关精确机制和速率限制步骤的辩论。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制本身以其双站点特性而著称，其中表面反应涉及催化剂表面上的两个相邻活性中心。这种双站点机制解释了脱氢反应中观察到的速率加速现象，因为它允许同时处理多个基质分子，从而提高整体反应速率。

向催化剂中逐渐添加锂氧化物（Liz0）会导致连续失活，而添加钠氧化物（NazO）则最初导致失活，随后导致激活。这一观察结果支持了假设：催化剂的电子性质在脱氢过程中起着至关重要的作用。通过改变固体中的费米能级（PF），受杂质添加的影响，影响表面的电子和空穴，进而影响基质和产物分子的吸附和脱附过程，从而影响反应的速率限制步骤。
