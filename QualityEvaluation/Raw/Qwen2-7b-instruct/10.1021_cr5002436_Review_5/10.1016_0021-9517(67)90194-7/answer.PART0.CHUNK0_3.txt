[1] "The reaction rate data fit satisfactorily the dual-site mechanism."
[2] "The progressive addition of Liz0 gave a continuous deactivation of the catalyst, while the progressive addition of NazO gave a deactivation followed by an activation."
[3] "The trend of the experimental data of Table 3, graphically reported in Fig. 4, suggests that the rate-determining step is the surface reaction,which involves two adjacent active centers (dual-site)."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the substrate molecule, often involving the breaking of a chemical bond.
3. Formation of an intermediate species on the catalyst surface.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often centers around the activation step, as it requires the highest energy input and thus significantly influences the overall reaction rate. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the interactions between the substrate molecules, the catalyst surface, and the energy barriers involved in the activation and desorption processes. These factors contribute to the dynamic and multifaceted nature of catalytic reactions, leading to debates on the precise mechanisms and rate-limiting steps.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism itself is characterized by its dual-site nature, where the surface reaction involves two adjacent active centers on the catalyst. This dual-site mechanism explains the observed rate acceleration in dehydrogenation reactions, as it allows for the simultaneous processing of multiple substrate molecules, thereby increasing the overall reaction rate.

The progressive addition of lithium oxide (Liz0) to the catalyst leads to continuous deactivation, whereas the addition of sodium oxide (NazO) initially causes deactivation but subsequently results in activation. This observation supports the hypothesis that the electronic properties of the catalyst play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process. Changes in the Fermi level (PF) of the solid, influenced by the addition of impurities, affect the reaction rate by altering the availability of electrons and holes on the catalyst surface. This, in turn, impacts the adsorption and desorption processes of substrate and product molecules, influencing the rate-limiting step in the reaction.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：
1. 基质分子在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 基质分子的活化，通常涉及化学键的断裂。
3. 在催化剂表面上形成中间物种。
4. 产品分子从催化剂表面的脱附。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论往往集中在激活步骤上，因为它需要最高的能量输入，并且显著影响整体反应速率。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这个机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，原因在于基质分子、催化剂表面以及激活和脱附过程中涉及的能量壁垒之间的复杂相互作用。这些因素导致催化反应的动态和多面性质，从而引发有关精确机制和速率限制步骤的辩论。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制本身以其双站点特性而著称，其中表面反应涉及催化剂表面上的两个相邻活性中心。这种双站点机制解释了脱氢反应中观察到的速率加速现象，因为它允许同时处理多个基质分子，从而提高整体反应速率。

向催化剂中逐渐添加锂氧化物（Liz0）会导致连续失活，而添加钠氧化物（NazO）则最初导致失活，随后导致激活。这一观察结果支持了假设：催化剂的电子性质在脱氢过程中起着至关重要的作用。通过改变固体中的费米能级（PF），受杂质添加的影响，影响表面的电子和空穴，进而影响基质和产物分子的吸附和脱附过程，从而影响反应的速率限制步骤。
