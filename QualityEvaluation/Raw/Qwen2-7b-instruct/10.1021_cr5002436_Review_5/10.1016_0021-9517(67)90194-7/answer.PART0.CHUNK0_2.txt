[1] "The reaction rate data fit satisfactorily the dual-site mechanism."
[2] "The progressive addition of Liz0 gave a continuous deactivation of the catalyst, while the progressive addition of NazO gave a deactivation followed by an activation."
[3] "The kinetic mechanism for the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction was selected by analysis of the influence of the reactant partial pressure on reaction rate."
[4] "The trend of the experimental data of Table 3, graphically reported in Fig. 4, suggests that the rate-determining step is the surface reaction,which involves two adjacent active centers (dual-site)."
[5] "It is noteworthy that in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on the same catalysts the rate-determining step is the hydrocarbon chemisorption as it is substantiated by the absence of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene in the reaction products."
[6] "The proposed reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 10, where 8 and @ indicate the electrons and the holes on the catalyst surface, respectively."
[7] "As is known, foreign atoms added to a crystalline solid can replace the regular lattice atoms (substitutive solution) or can be thrown into interstitial positions or onto the surface of the crystal."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule, reaction with a catalyst surface site, desorption of the product molecule, and regeneration of the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around which of these steps is the rate-limiting step, with some researchers arguing for adsorption, others for reaction, and still others for desorption or regeneration. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reactions involved and the dynamic nature of the catalyst surface.

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four primary stages:吸附反应物分子，与催化剂表面位点反应，产物分子脱附，以及催化剂表面再生。科学界关于哪一步是决定速率的关键步骤存在争议，一些研究者认为是吸附阶段，另一些认为是反应阶段，还有人认为是脱附或再生阶段。尽管这一机制已被研究了近一个世纪，但其仍是一个科学兴趣和争议的焦点，原因在于反应的复杂性和催化剂表面的动态性质。
