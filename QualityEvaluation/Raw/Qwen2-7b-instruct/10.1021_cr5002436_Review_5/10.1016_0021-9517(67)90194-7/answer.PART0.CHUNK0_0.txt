The dehydrogenation reaction of n-butane over chromia-alumina has been kinetically investigated employing the differential reactor technique at temperatures ranging from 510 to 550C. The runs were performed on n-butane and on mixtures of n-butane + 1-butene or n-butane + hydrogen, in the presence of an inert gas (nitrogen), with complete analysis of reaction products. The reaction rate data fit satisfactorily the dual-site mechanism.

A set of runs have been made on 10% chromia catalyst, containing different amounts of Liz0 or NazO. The progressive addition of Liz0 gave a continuous deactivation of the catalyst, while the progressive addition of NazO gave a deactivation followed by an activation.

A general scheme of n-butane dehydrogenation can be written as follows: distribution of butenes is largely dominated by the equilibrium conditions and therefore it is difficult to establish if one of the butenes is preferentially formed from n-butane. On the other hand, from the data of Table 4 it appears that the experimental ratios (C/E) and (T/E) are generally smaller than the equilibrium ones. This fact seems to indicate that 2-butenes have a slightly higher dehydrogenation rate than 1-butene.

The kinetic mechanism for the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction was selected by analysis of the influence of the reactant partial pressure on reaction rate. The trend of the experimental data of Table 3, graphically reported in Fig. 4, suggests that the rate-determining step is the surface reaction,which involves two adjacent active centers (dual-site). 

The experimental reaction rate data confirm the validity of the Langmuir- Hinshelwood scheme for the description of the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction. The kinetic mechanism of the reaction reveals that the rate-determining step is the surface reaction with a dual-site mechanism.

For feeding mixtures of n-butane, nitrogen, and a component i (1-butene or hydrogen), Eq. (4), by taking into account that the partial pressure of n-butane was kept constant, can be written: (PB - PAPH/K) = (1 + bBPB + biPBRi)^2. This equation can be rearranged as follows: (PB - PAPH/K) / (1 + bBPB) = 1 + &Ri. Such plots are reported in Figs. 6 and 7 for the runs corresponding to mixtures of n-butane and 1-butene and mixtures of n-butane and hydrogen, respectively.

The application of the t test to their regression coefficients gave probability values less than 1%. Therefore it derives that also the runs performed with addition of a reaction product to the feeding mixture are consistent with the dual-site mechanism.

The adsorption equilibrium constants bA and ba were obtained from the parameters of the straight lines of Figs. 6 and 7 and from the values of k, and bg given in Table 5.

The proposed reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 10, where 8 and @ indicate the electrons and the holes on the catalyst surface, respectively.

At the equilibrium we have klPn = k-m4na+ + knnAne, ksna = k#.@Le = rE, and rn being the desorption rate of n-butane, that is the rate of the overall process.

The formation of divalent chromium ions on the catalyst can be due to a catalyst partial reduction. Measurements of electrical conductivity of chromia-alumina catalysts as a function of temperature showed that the catalyst is a semiconductor with amphoteric nature.

The proposed reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 10, where 8 and @ indicate the electrons and the holes on the catalyst surface, respectively.

If na indicates the surface concentration of the ith species, for low coverage, that is for ne >> nA, we obtain the following relations: dn.i/dt = klPB - k-lnAnH+ - kznAn@, dna/dt = kznAn@ - k3nR.

Both ne and nn+ depend on the position of the Fermi level pLF of the solid and therefore also the reaction rate is affected by the value of the Fermi level. Since ne increases by increasing PF, while it is possible to show that the concentration of a species bound to the catalyst surface with a strong donor bond (H-0) decreases by increasing PF, then globally the reaction rate should follow the variation of PF.

The previous analysis can be useful for the interpretation of the influence of the impurities added to the catalyst on its activity.

The relative concentration of impurities in reticular or interstitial position is largely dominated by the values of the impurity and host ion radii.

For the system under consideration, the values of ionic radii are as follows: A13+, 0.50; Cr3+, 0.69; Li+, 0.60; Na+, 0.95. From these values, it derives that Li+ ions can substitute both Cr3+ and A13+ ions in the lattice much better than Na+ ions.

The monovalent alkaline atom present in a reticular position acts as an electron acceptor, because it provides to the system only one electron, while the communal sharing system demands three @I). The indispensable two electrons will be extracted from the normal electronic distribution of the crystal, leaving two partially free positive holes able to wander in the neighborhood of the defect.

On the other hand, a monovalent largely electropositive atom in an interstitial position acts as an electron donor, giving to the system one electron.

The previous analysis seems to confirm the experimental results shown in Fig. 2; in fact, the addition of lithium, that acts as an electron acceptor and decreases PF, gives at every concentration a decrease of catalyst activity.

The addition of sodium gives a decrease of activity if its concentration is small and then it acts as an electron acceptor, followed by an increase of the activity at the higher concentrations, at which it acts as an electron donor.

The influence of the impurities added to the catalyst on its activity remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

2. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood scheme is confirmed as valid for the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction. The kinetic mechanism involves a surface reaction with a dual-site mechanism.

3. The addition of lithium to the catalyst leads to a decrease in activity, while the addition of sodium initially decreases activity but then increases it at higher concentrations. This behavior is explained by the ability of lithium to act as an electron acceptor and sodium as an electron donor.

4. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to the ongoing debate on which step is considered rate-limiting. The influence of impurities on catalyst activity continues to be a subject of study and controversy despite decades of research.
