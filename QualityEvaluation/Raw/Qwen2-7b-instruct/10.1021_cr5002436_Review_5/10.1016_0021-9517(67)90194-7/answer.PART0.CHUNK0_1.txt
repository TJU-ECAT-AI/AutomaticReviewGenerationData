[1] "The reaction rate data fit satisfactorily the dual-site mechanism."
[2] "The progressive addition of Liz0 gave a continuous deactivation of the catalyst, while the progressive addition of NazO gave a deactivation followed by an activation."
[3] "A set of runs have been made on 10% chromia catalyst, containing different amounts of Liz0 or NazO."
[4] "The kinetic mechanism for the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction was selected by analysis of the influence of the reactant partial pressure on reaction rate."
[5] "The trend of the experimental data of Table 3, graphically reported in Fig. 4, suggests that the rate-determining step is the surface reaction,which involves two adjacent active centers (dual-site)."
[6] "The experimental reaction rat,e data confirm the validity of the Langmuir- Hinshelwood scheme for the description of the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction."
[7] "The addition of sodium gives a decrease of activity if its concentration is small and then it acts as an electron accep- tor, followed by an increase of the activity at the higher concentrations,at which it acts as an electron donor."
[8] "The proposed reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 10, where 8 and @ indicate the electrons and the holes on the catalyst surface, respectively."

1. The reaction rate data align well with the dual-site mechanism.
2. Adding lithium oxide leads to continuous catalyst deactivation, whereas adding sodium oxide initially causes deactivation before activation.
3. Different amounts of lithium oxide (Liz0) and sodium oxide (NazO) were incorporated into a 10% chromia-alumina catalyst.
4. The kinetic mechanism was chosen based on the influence of reactant partial pressure on reaction rate.
5. The surface reaction involving two adjacent active centers was identified as the rate-determining step.
6. The experimental data confirm the applicability of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood scheme for describing n-butane dehydrogenation.
7. Sodium oxide's effect on catalyst activity varies: it starts as an electron acceptor at lower concentrations, then acts as an electron donor at higher concentrations.
8. A detailed reaction mechanism, including electron and hole interactions on the catalyst surface, is illustrated in Fig. 10.
