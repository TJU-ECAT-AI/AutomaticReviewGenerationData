[1] "The purpose of our study was to investigate the nature of the carbon-containing deposits formed during propane de- hydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium."
[2] "The reduction of Cr6+, present as chromates, and the formation of hydroxyl and carbon- containing species were studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). In situ Raman spectroscopy was used to study further the reduc- tion of chromates and the formation of carbon-containing deposits."
[3] "The formation of carbon-containing species during pro- pane dehydrogenation was studied for a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium."
[4] "Aside from the difference observed in the initial for- mation of acetates/carboxylates, the deposition of carbon- containing species was similar on the oxidised and on the hydrogen-prereduced catalyst."

The study aimed to explore the nature of carbon-containing deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with a 13.5 wt% chromium load. The research utilized in situ DRIFTS and Raman spectroscopy to examine the reduction of chromates and the creation of carbon-containing species. It was observed that the formation of carbon deposits was similar on both an oxidized catalyst and one that had undergone hydrogen pre-reduction, except for the initial formation of acetates/carboxylates. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite extensive study over nearly a century.

The study investigated the formation of carbon-containing substances during propane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium. The reduction of chromates by propane might occur through the creation of isopropoxide species, which then react to produce adsorbed acetone, followed by formates and acetates. Propane dehydrogenation led to the sequential formation of aliphatic, unsaturated/aromatic, and graphite-like hydrocarbon deposits, which contributed to the catalyst's deactivation. Hydrogen pre-reduction slowed the formation of the oxidized species but did not significantly impact the hydrocarbon deposits formed during dehydrogenation.

The study aimed to explore the characteristics of carbon-containing deposits generated during propane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium. The reduction of chromates, the creation of hydroxyl and carbon-containing substances, was examined using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). While the initial formation of acetates/carboxylates varied, the deposition patterns of carbon-containing materials were comparable on both oxidized and hydrogen-pre-reduced catalysts. The research focused on understanding the formation of carbon-containing species during propane dehydrogenation on a specific type of catalyst. The reduction of chromates by propane might occur through the formation of isopropoxide species, which then convert into acetone, formates, and acetates through subsequent reactions.

我们的研究目的是研究丙烷脱氢过程中在含13.5 wt%铬的氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂上形成的碳含量沉积物的性质。通过原位差分反射红外傅里叶变换光谱法（DRIFTS）研究了铬酸盐的还原以及羟基和碳化合物的形成。虽然初始形成醋酸盐/羧酸盐有所不同，但在氧化和氢预还原催化剂上的碳化合物沉积物的沉积模式相似。该研究关注于理解丙烷脱氢过程中特定类型的催化剂上形成碳化合物的机制。通过形成异丙醇基物种，然后进一步转化为吸附的乙酮、碳酸盐和乙酸盐，铬酸盐可能通过形成异丙醇基物种而被丙烷还原。

[5] "The room-temperature spectrum of the oxidised catalyst showed absorption bands at 3730, 3620, and 1600 cm1 due to AlOH [9], CrOH [3], and adsorbed water [10], respectively."
[6] "The bands at 1535 and 14401430 cm1 are due to acetates [12] or carboxylate species in general [14] (νas(COO), νs(COO), respectively)."
[7] "Similar TP-DRIFTS experiments were also carried out for bulk chromia and the alumina support."
[8] "The sample was flushed with inert gas before the Raman spectra were acquired, to enable better comparison with the DRIFTS results."
[9] "The oxidised catalyst showed Raman bands centered at about 1020 and 830 cm1,corresponding to the stretching modes of terminal Cr=O and bridging CrOCr units of surface chromate species,respectively [2,20]."
[10] "At 580 C, in addition to the bands of the graphite-like de- posits, a broad band was observed at 2890 cm1, where CH species typically appear [25]."
[11] "The regular occurrence of a drop in the signal is due to the nitrogen flushes."
[12] "Aside from the difference observed in the initial for- mation of acetates/carboxylates, the deposition of carbon- containing species was similar on the oxidised and on the hydrogen-prereduced catalyst."

This study aimed to investigate the carbon-containing deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium. The reduction of chromates and the formation of hydroxyl and carbon-containing species were studied using in situ DRIFTS combined with mass spectrometry (MS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with gas chromatography (GC). The reduction process involved the formation of isopropoxide species, which react further to produce acetone, formates, and acetates. Acetates/carboxylates might also form in other reactions, such as the reaction of propane with surface OH groups. Propane dehydrogenation led to the sequential formation of aliphatic, unsaturated/aromatic, and graphite-like hydrocarbon deposits, which deactivated the catalyst. Hydrogen prereduction slowed the formation of the oxidized species but had no significant impact on the hydrocarbon species formed during dehydrogenation.
