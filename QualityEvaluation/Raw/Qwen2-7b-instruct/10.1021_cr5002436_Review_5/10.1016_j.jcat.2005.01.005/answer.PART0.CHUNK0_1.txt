The study investigated the formation of carbon-containing substances during propane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium. The reduction of chromates by propane might occur through the creation of isopropoxide species, which then react to produce adsorbed acetone, followed by formates and acetates. Propane dehydrogenation led to the sequential formation of aliphatic, unsaturated/aromatic, and graphite-like hydrocarbon deposits, which contributed to the catalyst's deactivation. Hydrogen pre-reduction slowed the formation of the oxidized species but did not significantly impact the hydrocarbon deposits formed during dehydrogenation.

研究了在13.5 wt% 铬含量的氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂上丙烷脱氢过程中形成的碳化合物。通过形成异丙醇基物种，铬酸盐的减少可能进行，然后反应生成吸附的丙酮，随后是碳酸盐和丙酸盐。丙烷脱氢导致了直链、不饱和/芳香族以及石墨状碳氢化合物沉积物的依次形成，这使得催化剂失效。预还原氢降低了氧化物种的形成速度，但并未显著影响脱氢过程中形成的碳氢化合物沉积物。
