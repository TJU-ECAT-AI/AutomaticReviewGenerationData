[11] "The regular occurrence of a drop in the signal is due to the nitrogen flushes."
[12] "Aside from the difference observed in the initial for- mation of acetates/carboxylates, the deposition of carbon- containing species was similar on the oxidised and on the hydrogen-prereduced catalyst."

This study aimed to investigate the carbon-containing deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium. The reduction of chromates and the formation of hydroxyl and carbon-containing species were studied using in situ DRIFTS combined with mass spectrometry (MS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with gas chromatography (GC). The reduction process involved the formation of isopropoxide species, which react further to produce acetone, formates, and acetates. Acetates/carboxylates might also form in other reactions, such as the reaction of propane with surface OH groups. Propane dehydrogenation led to the sequential formation of aliphatic, unsaturated/aromatic, and graphite-like hydrocarbon deposits, which deactivated the catalyst. Hydrogen prereduction slowed the formation of the oxidized species but had no significant impact on the hydrocarbon species formed during dehydrogenation.

本研究旨在探究在含13.5 wt%铬的氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂上丙烷脱氢过程中形成的碳含量沉积物的性质。通过原位傅里叶变换红外光谱结合质谱（MS）和原位拉曼光谱结合气相色谱法（GC），研究了氧化铬和氧化铝的还原以及形成羟基和碳含量物种的过程。还原过程涉及形成异丙醇物种，进一步反应产生丙酮、碳酸盐和乙酸盐。碳酸盐或羧酸盐也可能在其他反应中形成，例如丙烷与表面OH基团的反应。丙烷脱氢导致了直链、不饱和/芳香型和石墨样烃类沉积物的顺序生成，这些沉积物使催化剂失活。氢预还原减缓了氧化物种的形成，但对脱氢过程中形成的碳氢化合物物种没有显著影响。
