The study investigated the formation of carbon-containing species during propane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium. The reduction of chromates by propane might involve the formation of isopropoxide species, which then react to produce acetone, formates, and acetates. Dehydrogenation of propane led to the sequential creation of aliphatic, unsaturated/aromatic, and graphite-like hydrocarbon deposits, which deactivated the catalyst. Hydrogen prereduction slowed the formation of the oxidized species but had no noticeable impact on the hydrocarbon deposits formed during the dehydrogenation process.

研究了在13.5 wt%铬含量的氧化铝/铬催化剂上丙烷脱氢过程中形成碳化合物物种的情况。铬酸盐通过丙烷的还原可能涉及异丙醇物种的形成，然后进一步反应生成丙酮、碳酸盐和乙酸盐。丙烷的脱氢导致了从直链、不饱和/芳香族到石墨状碳氢化合物沉积物的序列生成，这些沉积物使催化剂失效。氢预还原降低了氧化物种的生成，但对脱氢过程中形成的碳氢化合物沉积物没有明显影响。
