[1] "The purpose of our study was to investigate the nature of the carbon-containing deposits formed during propane de- hydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium."
[2] "The reduction of Cr6+, present as chromates, and the formation of hydroxyl and carbon- containing species were studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). In situ Raman spectroscopy was used to study further the reduc- tion of chromates and the formation of carbon-containing deposits."
[3] "The formation of carbon-containing species during pro- pane dehydrogenation was studied for a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium."
[4] "Aside from the difference observed in the initial for- mation of acetates/carboxylates, the deposition of carbon- containing species was similar on the oxidised and on the hydrogen-prereduced catalyst."

The study aimed to explore the nature of carbon-containing deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with a 13.5 wt% chromium load. The research utilized in situ DRIFTS and Raman spectroscopy to examine the reduction of chromates and the creation of carbon-containing species. It was observed that the formation of carbon deposits was similar on both an oxidized catalyst and one that had undergone hydrogen pre-reduction, except for the initial formation of acetates/carboxylates. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite extensive study over nearly a century.

研究旨在探究在13.5 wt% 铬负载的氧化铝/铬催化剂上丙烷脱氢形成碳含量沉积物的性质。研究利用原位DRIFTS和拉曼光谱法来研究铬酸盐的还原以及碳含量物种的形成。观察到在氧化态催化剂和经过氢预还原的催化剂上碳沉积的沉积相似，除了最初的形成乙酸酯/羧酸盐外。关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制中决定性步骤的持续争议仍然是科学界的兴趣点和争议焦点，尽管该领域在过去近一个世纪的研究中进行了广泛的探讨。
