The study aimed to explore the characteristics of carbon-containing deposits generated during propane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium. The reduction of chromates, the creation of hydroxyl and carbon-containing substances, was examined using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). While the initial formation of acetates/carboxylates varied, the deposition patterns of carbon-containing materials were comparable on both oxidized and hydrogen-pre-reduced catalysts. The research focused on understanding the formation of carbon-containing species during propane dehydrogenation on a specific type of catalyst. The reduction of chromates by propane might occur through the formation of isopropoxide species, which then convert into acetone, formates, and acetates through subsequent reactions.

我们的研究目的是研究丙烷脱氢过程中在含13.5 wt%铬的氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂上形成的碳含量沉积物的性质。通过原位差分反射红外傅里叶变换光谱法（DRIFTS）研究了铬酸盐的还原以及羟基和碳化合物的形成。虽然初始形成醋酸盐/羧酸盐有所不同，但在氧化和氢预还原催化剂上的碳化合物沉积物的沉积模式相似。该研究关注于理解丙烷脱氢过程中特定类型的催化剂上形成碳化合物的机制。通过形成异丙醇基物种，然后进一步转化为吸附的乙酮、碳酸盐和乙酸盐，铬酸盐可能通过形成异丙醇基物种而被丙烷还原。
