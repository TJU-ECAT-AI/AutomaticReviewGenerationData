[1] "The dehydrogenation reaction of -butane over a chromia-alumina catalyst (the Cr-20/f-Al-80 catalyst) was carried out,varying the partial pressure of n-butane."
[2] "These two experimental results imply that coke formation occurs consecutively to dehydrogenation of?z-butane as w-butanew-butene->coke."
[3] "The same reaction mechanism was reported by Otake et al.4)."
[4] "The values of k\ and KA were determined as
0.45x
104 mol/g-cat-sec-atm and
3.33
atm"1."
[5] "Though the rate of coke formation should be expressed as a sum of ra and r<?2, rCi is much smaller than rG\ at the beginning of the reaction,as is shown later.Thus,r% may be expressed by Eq. (2) with accuracy."
[6] "In Fig. 9, the calculated results of <fimfor the Cr-20/y-Al-8O and Cr-20/a-Al-80 catalysts are shown in solidlines,which seem to be in good agreement with the experimental data."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the substrate molecule, (3) formation of an intermediate species, and (4) desorption of the product molecule. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting depends on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst type. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the precise nature of the intermediates and the activation energies involved are still not fully understood. The mechanism's complexity and the challenges in accurately modeling the reaction kinetics contribute to the ongoing discussion and research in this field.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：（1）底物分子在催化剂表面吸附，（2）底物分子活化，（3）形成中间物种，和（4）产物分子脱附。关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的争论取决于特定的反应条件和催化剂类型。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为中间体的确切性质和激活能仍然不完全清楚。机制的复杂性和准确建模反应动力学的挑战是这个领域持续讨论和研究的原因。
