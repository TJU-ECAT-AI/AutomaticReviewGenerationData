[1] "The reaction experiments were carried out using three kinds of chromia-alumina catalysts of different compositions and it was clarified that dehydrogenation of n-butane was effective only on chromia, whereas coke formation occurred on alumina as well as on chromia."
[2] "The experimental results could be well explained by the dual active site model in which two kinds of active sites on the catalytic surface and a one-to-one correspondence between the numberof "molecules of coke" and the number of active sites were assumed."
[3] "It was observed in the dehydrogenation of n-butane over chromia-alumina catalysts that dehydrogenation occurred on chromia,whereas coke could be formed on -alumina as well as on chromia."
[4] "The experimental results could be well explained by the dual active site model under the assumptions that one-to-one correspondence exists between the number of "molecules of coke" deposited on a catalyst and the numberof catalytic sites,and that the effect of intraparticle diffusion within micro- pores can be ignored."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons on a surface. The mechanism consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the molecule, often involving breaking of a bond within the molecule.
3. Reaction of the activated molecule with another molecule, typically leading to the loss of hydrogen atoms.
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around which of these steps is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the adsorption step is the bottleneck, while others suggest that the activation step might be the rate-determining step. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the exact nature of the rate-limiting step remains a topic of contention.

This mechanism remains a subject of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a fundamental understanding of how hydrocarbons are transformed during catalytic processes. Understanding the details of this mechanism can lead to improvements in catalyst design, which is crucial for enhancing efficiency and reducing costs in industries that rely on these reactions, such as petrochemical processing and energy production. Moreover, insights gained from studying the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism can inform the development of new catalysts for emerging technologies, including renewable energy sources and sustainable chemical manufacturing processes.

霍里图-波拉尼机制描述了在表面催化脱氢化烃类的反应过程。该机制包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烃类分子吸附到催化剂表面上。
2. 分子激活，通常涉及分子内部键的断裂。
3. 激活的分子与另一个分子反应，通常导致氢原子的丢失。
4. 产物从催化剂表面解吸。

科学界围绕哪一步是决定性的争论不休。一些研究者认为吸附步骤是瓶颈，而另一些则认为激活步骤可能是决定性的步骤。尽管近一个世纪的研究，确定这个步骤的确切性质仍然是一个争议的话题。

这个机制之所以成为科学兴趣和争议的焦点，是因为它为理解催化过程中烃类转化提供了基本的理解。理解这一机制的细节可以促进催化剂设计的改进，这对于依赖这些反应的行业（如石油化工处理和能源生产）提高效率和降低成本至关重要。此外，从研究霍里图-波拉尼机制中获得的见解可以指导新型催化剂的发展，这适用于新兴技术，包括可再生能源和可持续化学制造过程。
