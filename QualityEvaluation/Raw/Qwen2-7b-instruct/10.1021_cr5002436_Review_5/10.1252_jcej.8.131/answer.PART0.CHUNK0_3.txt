[1] "Many heterogeneous reactions of industrial importance such as cracking, isomerization, and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons are accompanied by a gradual decrease of catalyst activity as the reaction proceeds."
[2] "This deactivation of the catalyst is in many cases caused by the deposition of carbonaceous substances, so-called 'coke' which is formed by side reaction."
[3] "Especially from the engineering point of view it is a quite important problem to express the degree of fouling quantitatively, and attempts have been made to relate the activity factor, which is defined as the ratio of the reaction rate at any time after the start of the reaction to that at the initial reaction time, with the process time or the coke content on the catalyst."
[4] "The object of the present study is to examine the physical meaning of the activity factor, and the rate of dehydrogenation of n-butane over chromia-alumina catalysts was studied."
[5] "The experimental results were well explained by the dual active site model with the assumptions that one-to-one correspondence exists between the number of 'molecules of coke' deposited on a catalyst and the number of active sites, and that the effect of intraparticle diffusion within micropores can be ignored."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface. 
2. Activation of the substrate molecule by interaction with the catalyst. 
3. Formation of an intermediate species that undergoes a chemical transformation. 
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting depends on the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the substrate and catalyst. In general, the adsorption and desorption steps often control the reaction rate because they involve the highest activation energy barriers. However, the activation step might also be rate-limiting in certain conditions, especially if it involves complex interactions that are difficult to overcome. The intermediate formation step can also be rate-limiting if it requires a substantial change in molecular structure that is energetically demanding.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the relative importance of each step can vary significantly depending on factors such as the reaction temperature, pressure, substrate concentration, and catalyst properties. Moreover, the complexity of real catalytic systems often leads to multiple pathways and competing mechanisms that can influence the overall reaction kinetics. This complexity makes it challenging to develop precise models that accurately predict reaction rates and selectivities, leading to ongoing research efforts aimed at refining our understanding of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and its implications for catalysis.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：
1. 基质分子在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 催化剂与基质分子之间的激活。  
3. 形成中间物种并进行化学转化。  
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面的脱附。

关于哪一步被认为是决定速率的关键，这取决于特定反应条件和底物及催化剂的性质。一般来说，吸附和脱附步骤往往控制着反应速率，因为它们涉及最高的活化能壁垒。然而，在某些情况下，激活步骤也可能是决定速率的关键，尤其是如果它涉及到难以克服的复杂相互作用的话。中间物种形成步骤也可能在需要显著改变分子结构的情况下成为决定速率的关键，这通常是一个耗能很高的过程。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，这种机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的焦点，因为每个步骤的重要性在不同条件下可能会有很大差异。此外，实际催化系统的复杂性往往导致多个途径和竞争机制，这些都可能影响整体反应动力学。这种复杂性使得精确建立能够准确预测反应速率和选择性的模型变得极具挑战性，因此持续的研究努力旨在细化我们对Horiuti-Polanyi机制及其对催化作用的理解。
