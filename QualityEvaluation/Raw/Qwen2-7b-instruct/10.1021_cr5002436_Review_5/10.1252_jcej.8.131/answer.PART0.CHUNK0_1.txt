[1] "The reaction experiments were carried out using three kinds of chromia-alumina catalysts of different compositions and it was clarified that dehydrogenation of -butane was effective only on chromia, whereas coke formation occurred on alumina as well as on chromia."
[2] "The experimental results could be well explained by the dual active site model in which two kinds of active sites on the catalytic surface and a one-to-one correspondence between the number of "molecules of coke" and the number of active sites were assumed."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule by breaking bonds, desorption of the activated molecule, and final reaction leading to the desired product. The ongoing debate in the scientific community concerns the identification of the rate-limiting step in this mechanism. While the exact step varies depending on the specific reaction and catalyst, the most commonly discussed candidates are the adsorption and desorption stages. These steps are often considered slow relative to the activation and reaction steps, making them potential rate-limiting factors. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because understanding and optimizing these steps can lead to improvements in catalytic efficiency and selectivity, which are crucial for industrial applications.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：分子吸附到催化剂表面，通过断开化学键激活分子，分子从活性位点去吸附，以及最终反应生成目标产物。科学界对于这一机制中速率限制步骤的讨论持续存在。根据特定反应和催化剂的不同，被认为可能为速率限制因素的主要候选步骤通常是吸附和去吸附阶段。这些步骤往往相对于活化和反应步骤较慢，因此可能是速率限制因素。由于理解并优化这些步骤可以提高催化效率和选择性，这对于工业应用至关重要，因此该机制仍然是科学研究的重要话题和争议焦点。
