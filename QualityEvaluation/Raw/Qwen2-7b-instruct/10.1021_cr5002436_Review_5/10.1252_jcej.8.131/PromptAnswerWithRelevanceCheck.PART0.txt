[1] "The reaction experiments were carried out using three kinds of chromia-alumina catalysts of different compositions and it was clarified that dehydrogenation of n-butane was effective only on chromia, whereas coke formation occurred on alumina as well as on chromia."
[2] "The experimental results could be well explained by the dual active site model in which two kinds of active sites on the catalytic surface and a one-to-one correspondence between the numberof "molecules of coke" and the number of active sites were assumed."
[3] "It was observed in the dehydrogenation of n-butane over chromia-alumina catalysts that dehydrogenation occurred on chromia,whereas coke could be formed on -alumina as well as on chromia."
[4] "The experimental results could be well explained by the dual active site model under the assumptions that one-to-one correspondence exists between the number of "molecules of coke" deposited on a catalyst and the numberof catalytic sites,and that the effect of intraparticle diffusion within micro- pores can be ignored."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons on a surface. The mechanism consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the molecule, often involving breaking of a bond within the molecule.
3. Reaction of the activated molecule with another molecule, typically leading to the loss of hydrogen atoms.
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around which of these steps is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the adsorption step is the bottleneck, while others suggest that the activation step might be the rate-determining step. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the exact nature of the rate-limiting step remains a topic of contention.

This mechanism remains a subject of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a fundamental understanding of how hydrocarbons are transformed during catalytic processes. Understanding the details of this mechanism can lead to improvements in catalyst design, which is crucial for enhancing efficiency and reducing costs in industries that rely on these reactions, such as petrochemical processing and energy production. Moreover, insights gained from studying the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism can inform the development of new catalysts for emerging technologies, including renewable energy sources and sustainable chemical manufacturing processes.

霍里图-波拉尼机制描述了在表面催化脱氢化烃类的反应过程。该机制包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烃类分子吸附到催化剂表面上。
2. 分子激活，通常涉及分子内部键的断裂。
3. 激活的分子与另一个分子反应，通常导致氢原子的丢失。
4. 产物从催化剂表面解吸。

科学界围绕哪一步是决定性的争论不休。一些研究者认为吸附步骤是瓶颈，而另一些则认为激活步骤可能是决定性的步骤。尽管近一个世纪的研究，确定这个步骤的确切性质仍然是一个争议的话题。

这个机制之所以成为科学兴趣和争议的焦点，是因为它为理解催化过程中烃类转化提供了基本的理解。理解这一机制的细节可以促进催化剂设计的改进，这对于依赖这些反应的行业（如石油化工处理和能源生产）提高效率和降低成本至关重要。此外，从研究霍里图-波拉尼机制中获得的见解可以指导新型催化剂的发展，这适用于新兴技术，包括可再生能源和可持续化学制造过程。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule by breaking bonds, desorption of the activated molecule, and final reaction leading to the desired product. The ongoing debate in the scientific community concerns the identification of the rate-limiting step in this mechanism. While the exact step varies depending on the specific reaction and catalyst, the most commonly discussed candidates are the adsorption and desorption stages. These steps are often considered slow relative to the activation and reaction steps, making them potential rate-limiting factors. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because understanding and optimizing these steps can lead to improvements in catalytic efficiency and selectivity, which are crucial for industrial applications.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：分子吸附到催化剂表面，通过断开化学键激活分子，分子从活性位点去吸附，以及最终反应生成目标产物。科学界对于这一机制中速率限制步骤的讨论持续存在。根据特定反应和催化剂的不同，被认为可能为速率限制因素的主要候选步骤通常是吸附和去吸附阶段。这些步骤往往相对于活化和反应步骤较慢，因此可能是速率限制因素。由于理解并优化这些步骤可以提高催化效率和选择性，这对于工业应用至关重要，因此该机制仍然是科学研究的重要话题和争议焦点。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the substrate molecule, (3) formation of an intermediate species, and (4) desorption of the product molecule. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting depends on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst type. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the precise nature of the intermediates and the activation energies involved are still not fully understood. The mechanism's complexity and the challenges in accurately modeling the reaction kinetics contribute to the ongoing discussion and research in this field.

[1] "Many heterogeneous reactions of industrial importance such as cracking, isomerization, and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons are accompanied by a gradual decrease of catalyst activity as the reaction proceeds."
[2] "This deactivation of the catalyst is in many cases caused by the deposition of carbonaceous substances, so-called 'coke' which is formed by side reaction."
[3] "Especially from the engineering point of view it is a quite important problem to express the degree of fouling quantitatively, and attempts have been made to relate the activity factor, which is defined as the ratio of the reaction rate at any time after the start of the reaction to that at the initial reaction time, with the process time or the coke content on the catalyst."
[4] "The object of the present study is to examine the physical meaning of the activity factor, and the rate of dehydrogenation of n-butane over chromia-alumina catalysts was studied."
[5] "The experimental results were well explained by the dual active site model with the assumptions that one-to-one correspondence exists between the number of 'molecules of coke' deposited on a catalyst and the number of active sites, and that the effect of intraparticle diffusion within micropores can be ignored."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface. 
2. Activation of the substrate molecule by interaction with the catalyst. 
3. Formation of an intermediate species that undergoes a chemical transformation. 
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting depends on the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the substrate and catalyst. In general, the adsorption and desorption steps often control the reaction rate because they involve the highest activation energy barriers. However, the activation step might also be rate-limiting in certain conditions, especially if it involves complex interactions that are difficult to overcome. The intermediate formation step can also be rate-limiting if it requires a substantial change in molecular structure that is energetically demanding.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the relative importance of each step can vary significantly depending on factors such as the reaction temperature, pressure, substrate concentration, and catalyst properties. Moreover, the complexity of real catalytic systems often leads to multiple pathways and competing mechanisms that can influence the overall reaction kinetics. This complexity makes it challenging to develop precise models that accurately predict reaction rates and selectivities, leading to ongoing research efforts aimed at refining our understanding of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and its implications for catalysis.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：
1. 基质分子在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 催化剂与基质分子之间的激活。  
3. 形成中间物种并进行化学转化。  
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面的脱附。

关于哪一步被认为是决定速率的关键，这取决于特定反应条件和底物及催化剂的性质。一般来说，吸附和脱附步骤往往控制着反应速率，因为它们涉及最高的活化能壁垒。然而，在某些情况下，激活步骤也可能是决定速率的关键，尤其是如果它涉及到难以克服的复杂相互作用的话。中间物种形成步骤也可能在需要显著改变分子结构的情况下成为决定速率的关键，这通常是一个耗能很高的过程。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，这种机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的焦点，因为每个步骤的重要性在不同条件下可能会有很大差异。此外，实际催化系统的复杂性往往导致多个途径和竞争机制，这些都可能影响整体反应动力学。这种复杂性使得精确建立能够准确预测反应速率和选择性的模型变得极具挑战性，因此持续的研究努力旨在细化我们对Horiuti-Polanyi机制及其对催化作用的理解。
