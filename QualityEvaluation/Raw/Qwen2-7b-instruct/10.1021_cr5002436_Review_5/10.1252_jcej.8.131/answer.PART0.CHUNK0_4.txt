[1] "The reaction experiments were carried out using three kinds of chromia-alumina catalysts of different compositions and it was clarified that dehydrogenation of n-butane was effective only on chromia, whereas coke formation occurred on alumina as well as on chromia."
[2] "The experimental results could be well explained by the dual active site model in which two kinds of active sites on the catalytic surface and a one-to-one correspondence between the numberof "molecules of coke" and the number of active sites were assumed."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface, activation of the substrate, dehydrogenation, and desorption of the product. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting centers around the activation and dehydrogenation stages. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the precise roles of each step in the overall reaction rate and the factors influencing their efficiencies are still being debated. The mechanism's complexity, influenced by the interaction between the substrate, catalyst, and reaction conditions, makes it challenging to fully understand and predict reaction kinetics.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：底物吸附到催化剂表面、底物活化、脱氢和产物从催化剂表面脱附。关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的争论集中在活化和脱氢阶段。尽管这一机制已经研究了一个世纪，但它仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为每个步骤在整体反应速率中的作用以及影响其效率的因素仍然存在争议。由于底物、催化剂和反应条件之间的相互作用的复杂性，理解并预测反应动力学仍然具有挑战性。
