The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. First, chemisorption (activated adsorption) of hydrogen produces adsorbed hydrogen atoms. Second, chemisorption (activated adsorption) of the double bond compound on the surface accompanied by an opening of the double bond and the formation of two new links with the catalyst. Third, transfer of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon, forming the half hydrogenated state. Fourth, either the removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon atom in the half hydrogenated state leading to replacement, or the subsequent attachment of a hydrogen atom to another carbon atom, giving rise to hydrogenation. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is addressed by the mechanism's claim that for it to hold, reactions I and II must be faster than reactions 4(a) and 4(b), where 4(a) leads to replacement and 4(b) to hydrogenation. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because it fits all relevant data and is justifiable from theoretical considerations.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is of continued scientific interest due to its ability to explain and predict the outcomes of various dehydrogenation reactions. The mechanism suggests that hydrogenation occurs as a side reaction to the main replacement reaction, with hydrogen atoms approaching the carbon atoms of unsaturated bonds independently. This leads to a successive replacement of hydrogen atoms on each carbon atom, with a possibility of forming a stable configuration corresponding to the hydrogenated compound if the approaches of the hydrogen atoms occur within a very short interval. The mechanism's prediction that hydrogenation will be a bimolecular process, while replacement is unimolecular with respect to hydrogen, aligns with experimental observations and supports its relevance in understanding dehydrogenation reactions. However, debates continue regarding the specific rates and mechanisms involved in each step, especially considering the balance between replacement and hydrogenation under different reaction conditions.

The mechanism's scientific interest lies in its ability to harmonize the hydrogenation process with the ideas of replacement, offering insights into the catalytic behavior of metals in dehydrogenation reactions. By distinguishing between replacement and hydrogenation as distinct processes, the mechanism contributes to a deeper understanding of the chemistry of catalytic surface interactions and the role of metal catalysts in facilitating these reactions. Despite the extensive research conducted over the past century, controversies and unanswered questions persist, particularly concerning the relative rates of different reaction steps and the influence of reaction conditions on the mechanism's applicability. These ongoing discussions highlight the complexity of dehydrogenation reactions and the need for further investigation to refine and expand the theoretical framework provided by the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤。首先，氢的化学吸附（活化吸附）产生吸附氢原子。其次，在表面上吸附不饱和化合物，并伴随双键打开和与催化剂形成两个新链接。第三，将一个氢原子转移到吸附烃类化合物的碳原子之一上，形成半氢化状态。第四，从半氢化状态的碳原子中移除一个氢原子导致取代，或者随后将一个氢原子附加到另一个碳原子上，产生氢化作用。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性的问题，机制声称为了它适用，反应I和II必须比反应4(a)和4(b)快，其中4(a)导致取代，4(b)导致氢化。尽管该机制自近一个世纪以来一直是研究的主题，但其仍受到科学界关注和争议，因为它符合所有相关数据并可以从理论考虑中得到解释。

霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制的科学兴趣在于其能够解释和预测各种脱氢反应的结果。机制建议氢化作用作为主取代反应的副反应发生，氢原子独立地接近不饱和键的碳原子。这导致每个碳原子上氢原子的连续取代，如果氢原子的接近发生在非常短的时间间隔内，则可以形成稳定对应于氢化化合物的配置。机制预测氢化作用为二分子过程，而取代相对于氢原子为单分子过程，与实验观察结果一致，支持其在理解脱氢反应中的相关性的价值。然而，关于每个步骤的具体速率和机制的争论仍在继续，特别是在不同反应条件下机制适用性的问题上。

机制的科学兴趣在于其能够将氢化作用过程与取代的概念相结合，提供对金属催化剂在脱氢反应中催化行为的深入理解。通过区分取代和氢化为独立的过程，机制为了解表面相互作用化学提供了洞见，并且有助于扩展对这些反应的理论框架。尽管过去一个世纪进行了大量研究，但仍然存在持续讨论和未解决的问题，特别是关于不同反应步骤相对速率的问题以及反应条件对机制适用性的影响。这些持续的讨论强调了脱氢反应的复杂性以及进一步研究以细化和完善霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制的必要性。
