[1] "The experiments which have led us to this conclusion are based on the following considerations."
[2] "If molecules A and B exchange their hydrogens in accordance with (I), then the velocity of exchange may be governed by the rate of dis- sociation either of A or of B, depending upon which dissociation process is the slower."
[3] "Experimental Method and Results."
[4] "The rate of hydrogen exchange between benzene and water is about 105  times slower * than that between hydrogen gas and benzene on nickel."
[5] "The first order rate of reaction for benzene and hydrogen is -
0.1
at 18" C. and for benzene and water -
IO-."
[6] "With regard to the second condition we can only say that so far as we are aware there is nothing to indicate that the water molecules have any material effect on the adsorption equilibrium or on the dissociation of these hydrocarbons."
[7] "It follows from the argument which we advanced in section (11) that, having regard to the greatly reduced rate when water is used in place of hydrogen, the hydrogen exchange between hydrogen gas and benzene or ethylene does not take place according to mechanism (I)."
[8] "The essential processes which we have postulated are :
1. The chemisorption (activated adsorption) of the hydrogen producing adsorbed hydrogen atoms."
[9] "Reaction 4(a) will be responsible for the replacement and 4 b )  for the hydrogena- tion reaction."
[10] "In those cases where the process we have discussed holds, it is necessary that reaction I and 2 should be faster than 4(a) and 4(b), and since 4(a) is unimolecular and 4(b) bimolecular with respect to the hydrogen, it is always possible to separate the two reactions by re- ducing the pressure, whereupon 4 a )  will proceed faster than 4 b )."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. The chemisorption (activated adsorption) of hydrogen producing adsorbed hydrogen atoms.  
2. The chemisorption (activated adsorption) of the double bond compound on the surface accompanied by an opening of the double bond and the formation of two new links with the catalyst.  
3. The transfer of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon thus forming the half hydrogenated state; a process which may be followed by 4(a) the removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon atom in the half hydrogenated state leading to replacement, or 4(b) the subsequent attachment of a hydrogen atom to another carbon atom, giving rise to hydrogenation.  
4(a) and 4(b) represent the replacement and hydrogenation reactions respectively.

Regarding which step is considered rate-limiting, the literature discusses that under certain conditions, it is necessary that step 1 and step 2 should be faster than steps 4(a) and 4(b). Since step 4(a) is unimolecular and step 4(b) bimolecular with respect to the hydrogen, it is possible to separate the two reactions by reducing the pressure, whereupon step 4(a) will proceed faster than step 4(b).

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it addresses fundamental aspects of catalytic reactions and the behavior of hydrogen atoms on metallic surfaces. Despite nearly a century of study, the precise details of the reaction pathways and the exact rates of individual steps remain areas of ongoing investigation and debate among chemists and materials scientists. The complexity of these reactions, especially considering the influence of various factors such as catalyst type, temperature, and pressure, contributes to the persistence of interest in this area of research.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 通过化学吸附（活化吸附）氢气产生吸附氢原子。
2. 在表面上吸附双键化合物，同时打开双键并形成与催化剂的两个新连接。
3. 将氢原子转移到吸附烃类分子的碳原子之一，形成半氢化状态；此过程可能随后是4(a)从半氢化状态下碳原子去除一个氢原子导致置换，或4(b)后续将氢原子附加到另一个碳原子上，引发氢化。  
4(a)和4(b)分别代表置换和氢化反应。

关于哪一步被认为是决定性的，文献讨论指出，在某些条件下，需要步骤1和步骤2比步骤4(a)和4(b)更快。由于步骤4(a)对氢原子是单分子的，而步骤4(b)是二分子的，因此可以通过降低压力来分离这两个反应，使得步骤4(a)比步骤4(b)更快进行。

这个机制仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它涉及到催化反应的基本方面和表面氢原子的行为。尽管近一个世纪的研究，个别步骤的确切细节以及反应路径仍属于化学家和材料科学家之间持续探讨的领域。这些反应的复杂性，特别是考虑到催化剂类型、温度和压力等各种因素的影响，导致这个研究领域的兴趣持续存在。
