[1] "The experiments which have led us to this conclusion are based on the following considerations."
[2] "If molecules A and B exchange their hydrogens in accordance with (I), then the velocity of exchange may be governed by the rate of dis- sociation either of A or of B, depending upon which dissociation process is the slower."
[3] "Experimental Method and Results."
[4] "At room temperatures the experiments were made in quartz vessels,about IOO C. C. volume, fitted with taps; at the higher temperatures,8oo-goo C., sealed vessels with breakable joints were employed and at the still higher temperature, 200' C., sealed tubes with thick walls similar to Carius tubes."
[5] "The results on the hydrogen exchange between water and benzene are given in Table I. We have included the results of the preliminary experiments, Nos. I to 5, which indicated that at ordinary temperatures there was no appreciable interchange."
[6] "The first order rate of reaction for benzene and hydrogen is - 0.1 at 18" C. and for benzene and water - IO-."
[7] "It follows from the argument which we advanced in section (11) that, having regard to the greatly reduced rate when water is used in place of hydrogen, the hydrogen exchange between hydrogen gas and benzene or ethylene does not take place according to mechanism (I)."

[9] "Another phenomenon suggesting a chemi-adsorption of the unsaturated compound is the wandering of the double bond caused by adsorption of the compoand on hydrogenating catalysts."

1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism suggests that hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbons exchange with catalysts through four main steps: chemisorption of hydrogen, chemisorption of double bond compounds, transfer of a hydrogen atom to a carbon atom of the adsorbed hydrocarbon, and the formation of a half-hydrogenated state. These steps are analyzed for their potential to be rate-limiting in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The ongoing debate around which step is rate-limiting centers on comparing the rates of reactions involving hydrogen and double bond compounds, considering the energy required for each step and the influence of catalyst properties on these reactions. 

3. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it explains various phenomena related to catalytic dehydrogenation, such as hydrogen conversion on metallic surfaces, cis-trans transformations, and the statistical independence of hydrogen atom approaches leading to bimolecular hydrogenation versus unimolecular replacement reactions. 

4. The mechanism also allows for the separation of hydrogenation and replacement reactions by adjusting pressure, as hydrogenation is typically a bimolecular process while replacement is unimolecular. This distinction helps in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes in industry.

1. Horiuti-Polanyi机制提出了氢原子在烃类与催化剂交换通过四个主要步骤：氢原子的化学吸附、双键化合物的化学吸附、氢原子转移到吸附烃类的碳原子以及形成半氢化状态。这些步骤被分析以确定催化脱氢反应中的哪一步可能成为速率限制因素。

2. 对哪一步成为速率限制因素的争论集中在比较涉及氢原子和双键化合物的反应速率，考虑每个步骤所需能量以及催化剂性质对这些反应的影响。

3. 这个机制仍然是一个科学兴趣的话题，因为它解释了催化脱氢相关的各种现象，如金属表面的氢转化、顺反异构体转变以及氢原子独立接近并附着到不同碳原子导致的分子的统计独立性，从而导致二分子氢化作用与单分子取代反应的区别。

4. 该机制还允许通过调整压力来分离氢化和取代反应，因为氢化通常是一个二分子过程而取代是单分子的。这种区分有助于理解并优化工业中的催化过程。
