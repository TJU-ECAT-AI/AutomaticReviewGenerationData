Completely analogous alternative mechanisms obviously suggest them- selves for the mechanism of the atomic exchange reaction between ethy- lene and hydrogen.2
2. Discrimination between Mechanism (I) and (11).
One of the objects of this communication is to discriminate between mechanisms (I) and (11) ; we are led to conclude that the atomic inter- change between benzene and hydrogen and between ethylene and hydro- gen takes place according to mechanism 1 1 .
The experiments which have led us to this conclusion are based on the following considerations.
If molecules A and B exchange their hydrogens in accordance with (I), then the velocity of exchange may be governed by the rate of dis- sociation either of A or of B, depending upon which dissociation process is the slower.
At a given temperature and on a given catalyst the rate of dissociation of a substance will be constant in the presence of other reactants, pro- vided that the adsorption and the rate of dissociation of the substance in the adsorbed state are not modified by the presence of the other reactants.
These considerations suggest the following means of deciding whether or not mechanism (I) is responsible for the interchange reaction. We allow (i) hydrogen to enter into atomic interchange with benzene on a platinum or nickel surface, as described in our first note and (ii) then Our own experi- ments on the exchange reaction on benzene have been stimulated by the discovery of the exchange with ethylene. 1164 1 Trans.

bring the same catalyst into contact with water and benzene; if, now,we find that the rate of replacement of hydrogen is much slower in the second experiment than in the first, we may conclude that mechanism (I) is not the one responsible for the reaction in the first case. This conclusion will, however, be valid only if the number of adsorbed hydrogen atoms formed per second from the chemisorption o f the water molecules,under the conditions o f the second experiment, is in excess of the number taken up by the benzene molecules (that is, if the rate of dissociation of the water molecules has not become a rate governing process), and if, moreover, the slower rate of atomic replacement is not due to changes in the adsorption or rate of dissociation of the molecules concerned. 3 .
Experimental Method and Results.
(a) Materials Used.
The heavy water employed in this work was obtained from the California Isotope Company and was distilled several times over potassium perman- ganate before use. The deuterium content, determined by measuring the density of the water by means of the micrpyknometer,was found to be 2-70 per cent.Kahlbaum's thiophene-free benzene was used directly without any further treatment.The ethylene was prepared from ethylene bromide and zinc and fractionated several times before use by distillation in vucuo.The catalysts used were platinum black and an active nickel catalyst.The platinum black was prepared, either by dropping potassium hydroxide solution into a mixture of platinum chloride solution and formaldehyde,or by evaporating down a solution of potassium chloride and potassium nitrate and heating the mixture to form the oxide which was reduced by hydrogen .The nickel catalyst was prepared from nickel carbonate which was heated to form the oxide, the oxide being reduced by hydrogen.The catalysts so prepared were introduced into the reaction vessels and brought into contact with the reacting substances without exposure to air. (b) General Experimental Procedure.At room temperatures the experiments were made in quartz vessels,about IOO C.C. volume, fitted with taps; at the higher temperatures,8oo-goo
C., sealed vessels with breakable joints were employed and at the
still higher temperature, 200' C., sealed tubes with thick walls similar to Carius tubes.In the experiments with ethylene the separation of the ethylene from the water at the conclusion of an experiment was achieved by passing the mixture through several traps cooled to - 80" C., while in the benzene experiments the phases were separated first by a fractional distillation.
The final purification of the benzene was achieved by drying with phos- phorus pentoxide. The water was freed from the last traces of benzene by passing it through the furnace used for the combustion of the benzene and the ethylene.
The benzene and ethylene were burned to water in an apparatus constructed on the lines of an ordinary organic combustion furnace for volatile compounds.

It is seen from these results that an exchange of hydrogen atoms was observed but that this was very much slower than that found under similar conditions between water and benzene.
The ethylene was found to contain only 0.27 per cent. of deuterium after twenty hours, while the equilibrium value, calculated from the equilibria between water and ethylene and water and benzene, would be 1.8 per cent. of deuterium in the ethylene.
We can state the general conclusions arising from these measurements.
The rate of hydrogen exchange between benzene and water is about 105  times slower * than that between hydrogen gas and benzene on nickel.
The first order rate of reaction for benzene and hydrogen is -

We can say, therefore, that the rate of ex- change with water and ethylene has been decreased in about the same ratio as for water and benzene.
The rate of exchange between ethylene and benzene is apparently fifty times slower than between water and benzene.
Discussion of Results.
It follows from the argument which we advanced in section (11) that, having regard to the greatly reduced rate when water is used in place of hydrogen, the hydrogen exchange between hydrogen gas and benzene or ethylene does not take place according to mechanism (I).
We emphasise again that this conclusion is subject to the conditions that (I) the adsorbed water molecules are able to produce more atomic hydrogen than can be taken up by the benzene or the ethylene and (2) that the effect is not due to a shift in the adsorption equilibrium or to a change in the dissociation rate o f the adsorbed hydrocarbon mole- cules.
With regard to the first condition we know, from the work on hydro- gen exchange between hydrogen gas and water in contact with a nickel or platinum catalyst, that water is able to exchange hydrogen atoms very rapidly. This fact, together with our knowledge of the rate of production of hydrogen in electrode processes (where water molecules on decomposition transfer their hydrogen to the metal electrode), seems to prove that the formation of adsorbed hydrogen atoms from water molecules is a much more rapid process than the simultaneous taking up of hydrogen atoms by the hydrocarbon present on the surface.
With regard to the second condition we can only say that so far as we are aware there is nothing to indicate that the water molecules have any material effect on the adsorption equilibrium or on the dissociation of these hydrocarbons.
We are therefore led to the conclusion that the experiments described in this section prove that the atomic exchange between benzene and hydrogen and between ethylene and hydrogen occurs according to mechanism I1 and not I.
Hydrogen Exchange between Ethylene and Benzene.
We can apply the arguments of paragraph I1 to this reaction and to the comparison of this reaction with those between the separate hydrocarbons and water.
First, however, it is necessary to state that the rate of this reaction may well be zero and that what has been measured is a successive exchange brought about by small traces of water or hydrogen present in the system; * this possibility does not, however,affect the main argument. Assuming for the moment that the rate of interchange is not really zero, then, if mechanism (I) is operative, the rate of the atomic exchange will be governed by that dissociation velocity of ethylene (into vinyl radicals and hydrogen atoms) or of benzene (into phenyl radicals and hydrogen atoms) which is the smaller.

In any case (whether the interchange is L L  real  or not), the smaller of these dissociation velocities must be smaller than the measured rate of interchange.
Since the water-benzene and the water-ethylene ex- change both proceed much more rapidly than the observed interchange between ethylene and benzene, we may further conclude that at least one of these two reactions (water-benzene or water-ethylene) follows mechanism (11).
Discrimination between Mechanism II(a) and II(b) .
We are now left with the two processes we classed together under mechanism 1 1 .
From the point of view of the quantum mechanical treatment of chemical reactions the difference between II(a) and II(b) can be shown to be that between a four-atom and a five-atom problem.
We can formulate them in the following way :- Mechanism II(b).

This can be treated on the lines of the quantum mechanical theory of heterogeneous catalysis which was advanced by one of u s 6  Here we assumed that two atoms of the catalyst which happened to be suit- ably situated to accommodate the atoms of the molecule were able,by virtue of their free valencies, to attack the atoms of the molecule along a straight line and from opposite sides, Ni-A-B-Ni.

It was shown in this paper that the energy of this transition state does not lie appreciably above the initial or final state, which implies that the transition from initial to final state can occur with little or no true activation energy.?
The formation of new bonds will follow the reverse 6 Polanyi, 2.

*The bonds between the adsorbed compounds and the surface have been represented as valence bonds. It is important to recognise that these bonds can be formed by bringing into play the conduction electrons of the metal as pointed out by one of us and also by Lennard Jones, Trans. Faraday Soc., 28,333,
1932. Thus it is not necessary to have the metal atoms exactly positioned.

For these processes to occur readily, it is necessary that the reaction energy should be small, that the energy content of the initial and the

Final replaced state.
We can only discuss these two cases qualitatively since we have not as yet carried out the calculations of the quantum mechanical problem.
One of the main differences between these two possibilities is that II(b) reduces to a four-atom problem while II(a) is a five-atom problem.* It is not possible to generalise concerning the activation energy of systems involving large numbers of atoms, but in an attempt to anticipate the results of these calculations we have come to the conclusion that mech- anism II(a) would possess an appreciable activation energy.
There are however arguments of a more definite character which favour II(b).
1. Farkas, Farkas and Rideal have shown that the atomic exchange
between hydrogen gas and ethane does not occur under conditions where the reaction between ethylene and hydrogen takes place rapidly,and in our experience hydrogen atoms are not replaced in ethyl alcohol under conditions which lead to a rapid exchange with benzene. It is seen from the schematic representations of II(a) and II(b) that since the double bond takes no part in the reaction mechanism II(a) an equally facile exchange is implied, whether the reactant is saturated or unsaturated. We are therefore led to assume that mechanism II(b) which takes advantage of the unsaturated nature of one of the reactants is responsible for the exchange. 2 .
From a review of the literature we have found that nascent hydro- gen, although a powerful reducing agent, does not hydrogenate double bonds. This is understandable from our previous discussions of mech- anism II(b), if we assume that the metals involved in the production of nascent hydrogen are unable to chemisorb the double bonded com- pounds. Fokin 7 has shown that when hydrogenation does occur in- cathodic reduction, the hydrogenating power of the metal can be corre- lated with the catalytic properties of the metal. 3 .
R. Kuhn t finds that platinum and palladium are good catalysts for
the conversion of fumaric acid into maleic acid and that the best prepara- tions of platinum for the isomerism catalysis were those which had been most effective for hydrogenation. It is clear that if mechanism II(b) holds, a hydrogenating catalyst must also catalyse the cis-trans inversion,whereas II(a) does not imply this consequence. 7 Fokin, 2.

4. Another phenomenon suggesting a chemi-adsorption of the
unsaturated compound is the wandering of the double bond caused by adsorption of the compoand on hydrogenating catalysts. Many such changes are known, some proceeding in the presence of the catalyst alone, while others require the presence of hydrogen on the catalyst.
In our opinion process II(b) accords with these observations, since, to explain the wandering of the double bond, it is necessary to postulate the opening of the double bond in the adsorption complex. Mechanism II(b) is still more directly applicable to the action of catalysts in the pre- sence of hydrogen. The diagrammatic representation of the four-atom problem given on page 1169 could also be used to describe the wandering process.
Hydrogenation In order to harmonize the hydrogenation process with the ideas we have expressed on replacement, we can best describe it as a side reaction to the main replacement reaction. The hydrogen atoms will approach the two carbon atoms of an unsaturated link or the neighbouring carbon atoms of a benzene molecule independently of one another, and we can assume that they will in general attach themselves to these two carbon atoms at different times.
This will generally result in a successive re- placement of a hydrogen atom on each carbon atom.
If, however, the separate approaches of the two hydrogen atoms occur within a very short interval of time (so that the attachment of the hydrogen to the second carbon atom occurs before the other carbon atom has lost a hydrogen atom), the configuration corresponding to the hydrogenated compound will become stable. We can express this in the same way as we have described our other scheme.

An essential feature of this point of view is that the hydrogenation process results from the statistically independent approach of two hydrogen atoms ; hence, hydrogenation will be a bimolecular process, whereas replacement is unimolecular with respect to the hydrogen.

172 REACTIONS OF HYDROGEN ON METALLIC CATALYSTS therefore that at low pressures the replacement reaction will predominate ;this conclusion is strikingly borne out by the experiments with water and ethylene and with water and benzene.
Under these conditions of low concentration of adsorbed hydrogen atoms the replacement of benzene is accompanied by no hydrogenation whatsoever. * To review our discussion-the essential processes which we have postulated are :
1. The chemisorption (activated adsorption) of the hydrogen pro-
ducing adsorbed hydrogen atoms.
2. The chernisorption (activated adsorption) of the double bond com-
pound on the surface accompanied by an opening of the double bond and the formation of two new links with the catalyst.
These ideas were presented by one of us in a discussion on catalysts,and it was pointed out by H. S. Taylor * that such processes may require comparatively high activation energies ; we are here, however, concerned with chemi-adsorption, which is not a rate determining step in the reaction sequence.
3. The transfer of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of
the adsorbed hydrocarbon thus forming the half hydrogenated state ;a process which may be followed by 4(a) the removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon atom in the half hydrogenated state leading to replacement, or 4 ( b ) the subsequent attachment of a hydrogen atom to another carbon atom, giving rise to hydrogenation.
The first reaction will be responsible for such changes as the ortho- para hydrogen conversion on metallic surfaces, while the second will be responsible for the cis-trans transformation on a catalyst. Reaction 4(a) will be responsible for the replacement and 4 b )  for the hydrogena- tion reaction.
In those cases where the process we have discussed holds, it is necessary that reaction I and 2 should be faster than 4(a) and 4(b), and since 4(a) is unimolecular and 4(b) bimolecular with respect to the hydrogen, it is always possible to separate the two reactions by re- ducing the pressure, whereupon 4 a )  will proceed faster than 4 b ) .
The mechanism we have advanced seems to fit all the relevant data,and moreover is justifiable from theoretical considerations.
Summary.
Mechanisms are advanced for the replacement of hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbons on catalytic surface and experiments are described which are able to lead to a discrimination between the processes advanced.
The experimental procedure is described and the results of the inter- change of hydrogen between water and benzene and water and ethylene and also between ethylene and benzene. The mechanism of hydrogenation is discussed in the light of these results and also in connection with other relevant reactions.
We wish to thank Mr. Ralph Gilson for his valuable assistance in the experiments.
