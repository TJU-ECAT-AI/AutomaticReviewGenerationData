[1] "One of the objects of this communication is to discriminate between mechanisms (I) and (11) ; we are led to conclude that the atomic inter- change between benzene and hydrogen and between ethylene and hydro- gen takes place according to mechanism 1 1 ."
[2] "If molecules A and B exchange their hydrogens in accordance with (I), then the velocity of exchange may be governed by the rate of dis- sociation either of A or of B, depending upon which dissociation process is the slower."
[3] "These considerations suggest the following means of deciding whether or not mechanism (I) is responsible for the reaction in the first case. We allow (i) hydrogen to enter into atomic interchange with benzene on a platinum or nickel surface, as described in our first note and (ii) then bring the same catalyst into contact with water and benzene; if, now,we find that the rate of replacement of hydrogen is much slower in the second experiment than in the first, we may conclude that mechanism (I) is not the one responsible for the reaction in the first case."
[4] "The essential processes which we have postulated are : 1. The chemisorption (activated adsorption) of the hydrogen producing adsorbed hydrogen atoms. 2. The chernisorption (activated adsorption) of the double bond compound on the surface accompanied by an opening of the double bond and the formation of two new links with the catalyst."
[5] "Reaction 4(a) will be responsible for the replacement and 4 b )  for the hydrogena- tion reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. Firstly, hydrogen is chemisorbed onto the surface, creating adsorbed hydrogen atoms. Secondly, the double bond compound is chemisorbed onto the surface, causing the double bond to open and forming two new bonds with the catalyst. Thirdly, a hydrogen atom is transferred to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon, leading to the half hydrogenated state. Finally, depending on the conditions, the reaction can proceed either to replacement or hydrogenation. The key points are that the hydrogenation process results from the independent approach of two hydrogen atoms, making it a bimolecular process, while the replacement reaction is unimolecular with respect to the hydrogen. The mechanism is considered rate-limiting when the rate of the hydrogenation reaction (reaction 4b) is faster than the rate of the replacement reaction (reaction 4a).

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the fundamental aspects of catalytic reactions, such as the role of surface chemistry and the energetics of bond formation and breaking. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, there are still debates regarding the precise details of the mechanism, particularly concerning the relative rates of the different steps and the specific conditions under which they dominate. These discussions continue to influence research in catalysis and chemical kinetics.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。首先，氢通过化学吸附被吸附到表面上，产生吸附氢原子。其次，双键化合物通过化学吸附被吸附到表面，导致双键打开，并与催化剂形成两个新的连接。第三步是，一个氢原子被转移到吸附烃类碳原子之一，导致半氢化状态。最后，根据条件，反应可以继续进行替换或氢化。关键点是，氢化过程源自两个氢原子的独立接近，使其成为二分子过程，而替换反应在氢的情况下是单分子的。当氢化反应（反应4b）的速度比替换反应（反应4a）快时，该机制被认为是决定性的。

尽管对这一机制的研究已经进行了近一个世纪，但科学界对此仍存在争议。因为它提供了关于催化反应基本方面的重要见解，如表面化学的作用和键形成与断裂的能动性。尽管进行了广泛的讨论，但关于机制中不同步骤的精确细节以及它们在特定条件下的主导作用仍然存在争论。这些讨论继续影响催化和化学动力学研究。
