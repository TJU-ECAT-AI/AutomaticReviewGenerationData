The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four primary steps: 
1. Chemisorption of hydrogen producing adsorbed hydrogen atoms. 
2. Chemisorption of the double bond compound on the surface accompanied by an opening of the double bond and the formation of two new links with the catalyst.  
3. Transfer of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon thus forming the half hydrogenated state. This can lead to either replacement or hydrogenation.
4. Removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon atom in the half hydrogenated state leading to replacement, or subsequent attachment of a hydrogen atom to another carbon atom, giving rise to hydrogenation.

Regarding the ongoing debate, the key contention revolves around which step is rate-limiting. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism suggests that for reactions to proceed efficiently, the energy barrier for the transition from initial to final state should be minimized. This implies that the activation energy associated with the rate-determining step should be low. 

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it provides a framework for understanding how hydrogen atoms are transferred on catalytic surfaces, influencing various industrial processes. Despite nearly a century of study, the specifics of which step is rate-limiting continue to be debated among researchers. This is because the activation energies of different steps can vary significantly, and factors such as the type of catalyst, reaction conditions, and nature of the reactants can influence the relative rates of these steps.

The mechanism also allows for the prediction of how changes in reaction conditions or catalyst properties might affect the efficiency of hydrogen transfer. For example, catalysts that favor mechanism II(b), which takes advantage of the unsaturated nature of one of the reactants, might exhibit different performance characteristics compared to catalysts that favor mechanism II(a).

Understanding the details of this mechanism helps in optimizing industrial processes that rely on dehydrogenation, such as the production of olefins from paraffins or the synthesis of alcohols from alkenes. The ability to control the rate of hydrogen transfer can lead to increased yields and product selectivity, making the mechanism a critical area of research in catalysis and chemical engineering.

该霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制对于催化脱氢反应包括四个主要步骤：
1. 化学吸附产生吸附氢原子。
2. 双键化合物在表面的化学吸附，伴随着双键的打开和与催化剂形成两个新的链接。
3. 将氢原子转移到吸附烃类分子的一个碳原子上，形成半氢化状态。这可能导致替换或氢化。
4. 从半氢化状态的碳原子上移除一个氢原子导致替换，或者随后将一个氢原子附加到另一个碳原子上，产生氢化作用。

关于持续争议的关键争论点在于哪一步是决定性的。霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制表明，为了使反应顺利进行，初始到最终状态的过渡的能量壁垒应该最小化。这意味着关联于决定性步骤的活化能应该较低。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，关于哪个步骤是决定性的仍然存在争议。这是因为不同步骤的活化能可以显著不同，并且反应条件、催化剂类型以及反应物的性质等因素可以影响这些步骤的相对速率。

理解这一机制有助于解释如何在催化表面上转移氢原子，影响各种工业过程。尽管进行了近一个世纪的研究，但关于哪个步骤是决定性的仍然存在争议。这是因为与决定性步骤相关的活化能可以变化很大。

了解这一机制的细节有助于优化依赖于脱氢的工业过程，如烷烃转化为烯烃或醇类合成。控制氢转移的速度可以提高产率和产品选择性，使得机制成为催化和化工工程领域的重要研究领域。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. First, chemisorption (activated adsorption) of hydrogen produces adsorbed hydrogen atoms. Second, chemisorption (activated adsorption) of the double bond compound on the surface accompanied by an opening of the double bond and the formation of two new links with the catalyst. Third, transfer of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon, forming the half hydrogenated state. Fourth, either the removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon atom in the half hydrogenated state leading to replacement, or the subsequent attachment of a hydrogen atom to another carbon atom, giving rise to hydrogenation. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is addressed by the mechanism's claim that for it to hold, reactions I and II must be faster than reactions 4(a) and 4(b), where 4(a) leads to replacement and 4(b) to hydrogenation. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because it fits all relevant data and is justifiable from theoretical considerations.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is of continued scientific interest due to its ability to explain and predict the outcomes of various dehydrogenation reactions. The mechanism suggests that hydrogenation occurs as a side reaction to the main replacement reaction, with hydrogen atoms approaching the carbon atoms of unsaturated bonds independently. This leads to a successive replacement of hydrogen atoms on each carbon atom, with a possibility of forming a stable configuration corresponding to the hydrogenated compound if the approaches of the hydrogen atoms occur within a very short interval. The mechanism's prediction that hydrogenation will be a bimolecular process, while replacement is unimolecular with respect to hydrogen, aligns with experimental observations and supports its relevance in understanding dehydrogenation reactions. However, debates continue regarding the specific rates and mechanisms involved in each step, especially considering the balance between replacement and hydrogenation under different reaction conditions.

The mechanism's scientific interest lies in its ability to harmonize the hydrogenation process with the ideas of replacement, offering insights into the catalytic behavior of metals in dehydrogenation reactions. By distinguishing between replacement and hydrogenation as distinct processes, the mechanism contributes to a deeper understanding of the chemistry of catalytic surface interactions and the role of metal catalysts in facilitating these reactions. Despite the extensive research conducted over the past century, controversies and unanswered questions persist, particularly concerning the relative rates of different reaction steps and the influence of reaction conditions on the mechanism's applicability. These ongoing discussions highlight the complexity of dehydrogenation reactions and the need for further investigation to refine and expand the theoretical framework provided by the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤。首先，氢的化学吸附（活化吸附）产生吸附氢原子。其次，在表面上吸附不饱和化合物，并伴随双键打开和与催化剂形成两个新链接。第三，将一个氢原子转移到吸附烃类化合物的碳原子之一上，形成半氢化状态。第四，从半氢化状态的碳原子中移除一个氢原子导致取代，或者随后将一个氢原子附加到另一个碳原子上，产生氢化作用。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性的问题，机制声称为了它适用，反应I和II必须比反应4(a)和4(b)快，其中4(a)导致取代，4(b)导致氢化。尽管该机制自近一个世纪以来一直是研究的主题，但其仍受到科学界关注和争议，因为它符合所有相关数据并可以从理论考虑中得到解释。

霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制的科学兴趣在于其能够解释和预测各种脱氢反应的结果。机制建议氢化作用作为主取代反应的副反应发生，氢原子独立地接近不饱和键的碳原子。这导致每个碳原子上氢原子的连续取代，如果氢原子的接近发生在非常短的时间间隔内，则可以形成稳定对应于氢化化合物的配置。机制预测氢化作用为二分子过程，而取代相对于氢原子为单分子过程，与实验观察结果一致，支持其在理解脱氢反应中的相关性的价值。然而，关于每个步骤的具体速率和机制的争论仍在继续，特别是在不同反应条件下机制适用性的问题上。

机制的科学兴趣在于其能够将氢化作用过程与取代的概念相结合，提供对金属催化剂在脱氢反应中催化行为的深入理解。通过区分取代和氢化为独立的过程，机制为了解表面相互作用化学提供了洞见，并且有助于扩展对这些反应的理论框架。尽管过去一个世纪进行了大量研究，但仍然存在持续讨论和未解决的问题，特别是关于不同反应步骤相对速率的问题以及反应条件对机制适用性的影响。这些持续的讨论强调了脱氢反应的复杂性以及进一步研究以细化和完善霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制的必要性。

1. The chemisorption (activated adsorption) of hydrogen producing adsorbed hydrogen atoms.  
2. The chemisorption (activated adsorption) of the double bond compound on the surface accompanied by an opening of the double bond and the formation of two new links with the catalyst.  
3. The transfer of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon thus forming the half hydrogenated state; a process which may be followed by 4(a) the removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon atom in the half hydrogenated state leading to replacement, or 4(b) the subsequent attachment of a hydrogen atom to another carbon atom, giving rise to hydrogenation.  
4(a) and 4(b) represent the replacement and hydrogenation reactions respectively.

Regarding which step is considered rate-limiting, the literature discusses that under certain conditions, it is necessary that step 1 and step 2 should be faster than steps 4(a) and 4(b). Since step 4(a) is unimolecular and step 4(b) bimolecular with respect to the hydrogen, it is possible to separate the two reactions by reducing the pressure, whereupon step 4(a) will proceed faster than step 4(b).

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it addresses fundamental aspects of catalytic reactions and the behavior of hydrogen atoms on metallic surfaces. Despite nearly a century of study, the precise details of the reaction pathways and the exact rates of individual steps remain areas of ongoing investigation and debate among chemists and materials scientists. The complexity of these reactions, especially considering the influence of various factors such as catalyst type, temperature, and pressure, contributes to the persistence of interest in this area of research.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 通过化学吸附（活化吸附）氢气产生吸附氢原子。
2. 在表面上吸附双键化合物，同时打开双键并形成与催化剂的两个新连接。
3. 将氢原子转移到吸附烃类分子的碳原子之一，形成半氢化状态；此过程可能随后是4(a)从半氢化状态下碳原子去除一个氢原子导致置换，或4(b)后续将氢原子附加到另一个碳原子上，引发氢化。  
4(a)和4(b)分别代表置换和氢化反应。

关于哪一步被认为是决定性的，文献讨论指出，在某些条件下，需要步骤1和步骤2比步骤4(a)和4(b)更快。由于步骤4(a)对氢原子是单分子的，而步骤4(b)是二分子的，因此可以通过降低压力来分离这两个反应，使得步骤4(a)比步骤4(b)更快进行。

这个机制仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它涉及到催化反应的基本方面和表面氢原子的行为。尽管近一个世纪的研究，个别步骤的确切细节以及反应路径仍属于化学家和材料科学家之间持续探讨的领域。这些反应的复杂性，特别是考虑到催化剂类型、温度和压力等各种因素的影响，导致这个研究领域的兴趣持续存在。

1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism suggests that hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbons exchange with catalysts through four main steps: chemisorption of hydrogen, chemisorption of double bond compounds, transfer of a hydrogen atom to a carbon atom of the adsorbed hydrocarbon, and the formation of a half-hydrogenated state. These steps are analyzed for their potential to be rate-limiting in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The ongoing debate around which step is rate-limiting centers on comparing the rates of reactions involving hydrogen and double bond compounds, considering the energy required for each step and the influence of catalyst properties on these reactions. 

3. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it explains various phenomena related to catalytic dehydrogenation, such as hydrogen conversion on metallic surfaces, cis-trans transformations, and the statistical independence of hydrogen atom approaches leading to bimolecular hydrogenation versus unimolecular replacement reactions. 

4. The mechanism also allows for the separation of hydrogenation and replacement reactions by adjusting pressure, as hydrogenation is typically a bimolecular process while replacement is unimolecular. This distinction helps in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes in industry.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. Firstly, hydrogen is chemisorbed onto the surface, creating adsorbed hydrogen atoms. Secondly, the double bond compound is chemisorbed onto the surface, causing the double bond to open and forming two new bonds with the catalyst. Thirdly, a hydrogen atom is transferred to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon, leading to the half hydrogenated state. Finally, depending on the conditions, the reaction can proceed either to replacement or hydrogenation. The key points are that the hydrogenation process results from the independent approach of two hydrogen atoms, making it a bimolecular process, while the replacement reaction is unimolecular with respect to the hydrogen. The mechanism is considered rate-limiting when the rate of the hydrogenation reaction (reaction 4b) is faster than the rate of the replacement reaction (reaction 4a).

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides insights into the fundamental aspects of catalytic reactions, such as the role of surface chemistry and the energetics of bond formation and breaking. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, there are still debates regarding the precise details of the mechanism, particularly concerning the relative rates of the different steps and the specific conditions under which they dominate. These discussions continue to influence research in catalysis and chemical kinetics.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。首先，氢通过化学吸附被吸附到表面上，产生吸附氢原子。其次，双键化合物通过化学吸附被吸附到表面，导致双键打开，并与催化剂形成两个新的连接。第三步是，一个氢原子被转移到吸附烃类碳原子之一，导致半氢化状态。最后，根据条件，反应可以继续进行替换或氢化。关键点是，氢化过程源自两个氢原子的独立接近，使其成为二分子过程，而替换反应在氢的情况下是单分子的。当氢化反应（反应4b）的速度比替换反应（反应4a）快时，该机制被认为是决定性的。

尽管对这一机制的研究已经进行了近一个世纪，但科学界对此仍存在争议。因为它提供了关于催化反应基本方面的重要见解，如表面化学的作用和键形成与断裂的能动性。尽管进行了广泛的讨论，但关于机制中不同步骤的精确细节以及它们在特定条件下的主导作用仍然存在争论。这些讨论继续影响催化和化学动力学研究。
