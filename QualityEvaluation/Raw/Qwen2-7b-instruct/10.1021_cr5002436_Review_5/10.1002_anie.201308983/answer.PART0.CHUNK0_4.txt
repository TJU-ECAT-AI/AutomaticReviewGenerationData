[1] "The ligand environment around the chromium center is critical for metal-silicate formation. We chose tri-tert-butoxysiloxy (OSi(OtBu)3) as a ligand for the coordination of chromium because these complexes are known to decompose at relatively low temperatures (ca. 200°C) into silica materials through the loss of isobutene, tert-butanol, and water."
[2] "Cr{N(SiMe3)2}22THF was treated with two equivalents of HOSi(OtBu)3 to give the blue crystalline CrII dimer [{Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)2}2] (1) in 60% yield."
[3] "Compound 1 contains two chromium atoms in distorted square-planar geometries, typical for high-spin CrII species."
[4] "The polymerization activity of [(SiO)4Cr2] was monitored at a low ethylene pressure (ca. 300 mbar) in a glass reactor equipped with an IR cell."
[5] "The results of the EXAFS analysis of 5 and [(SiO)6Cr2] are given in Table 1 and show similar environments between the molecular and the surface species."
[6] "From these results, we propose the following polymerization mechanism (Scheme 4): Polymerization is initiated through CH bond activation of ethylene across one of the CrO bonds in [(SiO)6Cr2] (4)."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed within the provided literature. The text focuses on the synthesis and characterization of chromium silicate catalysts for ethylene polymerization. It describes the formation of well-defined dinuclear CrII and CrIII sites on silica, where the CrIII sites are found to be highly active for ethylene polymerization. The mechanism for ethylene polymerization is proposed to involve heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on the CrIII silicate surface, leading to the formation of a chromium-vinyl species that can insert ethylene and continue polymer growth. This mechanism is distinct from traditional olefin-insertion polymerization catalysts and opens new avenues for manipulating these materials to produce a wider range of polymer properties.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应的机理没有在提供的文献中进行讨论。文本专注于铬硅酸盐催化剂的合成和表征，用于乙烯聚合。它描述了在硅胶上形成定义明确的二核CrII和CrIII位点，其中CrIII位点被发现对乙烯聚合非常有效。提出的乙烯聚合机制涉及通过CrIII硅酸盐表面异裂乙烯的CH键活化来启动乙烯聚合，导致形成含铬乙烯基物种，该物种可以插入乙烯并继续聚合增长。这一机制与传统的共轭烯烃插入聚合催化剂不同，并为这些材料提供了一条新途径，以生产更广泛的聚合物性质。
