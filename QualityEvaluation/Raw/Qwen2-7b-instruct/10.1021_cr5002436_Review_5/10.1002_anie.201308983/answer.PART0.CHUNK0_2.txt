[1] "The key step in this mechanism is the heterolytic CH activation of ethylene, a process that conserves the oxidation state of chromium and is consistent with the XANES spectrum of [(SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene."
[2] "Chain termination could be the microreverse of the initiation step, proton transfer from the coordinated silanol to the carbon atom bound to Cr, or through direct β-proton transfer to a coordinated ethylene to liberate a polymer chain containing olefinic and methyl end groups with regeneration of the neutral CrIII site."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction pathway, which involves four main steps. The ongoing debate in the scientific community concerns which of these steps is rate-limiting. The mechanism typically starts with the adsorption of a hydrogen molecule onto a metal surface. The second step involves the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule into individual hydrogen atoms. The third step is the activation of the hydrogen atoms, where they react with a substrate molecule to form an activated intermediate. Finally, the fourth step is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the intermediate to form the desired product and regenerate the metal surface. Despite a century of study, the precise sequence of events and the rate-determining step are still subjects of discussion among researchers.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction pathways involved and the difficulty in experimentally determining the rates of individual steps. Different metals and substrates may exhibit varying reaction kinetics, leading to diverse mechanisms and interpretations. Moreover, the role of surface defects, the presence of impurities, and the effect of temperature and pressure on the reaction rates are still being explored. This complexity and the lack of consensus on the exact mechanism contribute to the ongoing debate about the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应的途径，涉及四个主要步骤。科学界对这些步骤中哪一步是速率限制步骤存在持续的争论。机制通常从氢分子吸附到金属表面开始。第二步涉及氢分子的分解为单个氢原子。第三步是氢原子的活化，它们与一个基团反应形成活性中间体。最后一步是从中间体中移除一个氢原子，形成所需的产品和再生金属表面。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但事件序列的确切顺序和速率限制步骤仍然是研究人员讨论的话题。

霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因在于反应路径的复杂性以及确定个别步骤速率的难度。不同金属和基团可能表现出不同的反应动力学，导致不同的机制和解释。此外，表面缺陷、杂质的存在以及温度和压力对反应速率的影响仍在探索之中。这种复杂性和关于霍里图-波兰尼机制速率限制步骤的缺乏共识推动了这一持续的争论。
