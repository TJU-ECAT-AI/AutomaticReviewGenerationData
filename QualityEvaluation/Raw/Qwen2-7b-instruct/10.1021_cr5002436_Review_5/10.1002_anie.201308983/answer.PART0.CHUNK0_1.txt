<p>Coordination of ethylene forms the alkylethylene complex B, which undergoes olefin insertion to give C. Growth of the polymer chain is a repetition of this step until chain transfer occurs.</p>
<p>Chain transfer depends on the conditions and chosen catalyst, but generally takes place through β-hydride elimination, transmetalation to an alkyl aluminum species, hydrogenolysis, or through a direct β-proton transfer to a coordinated ethylene molecule.</p>
<p>The metal product then reenters the catalytic cycle.</p>
<p>Exploitation of this general mechanism has led to a large family of catalysts that can polymerize olefins with control of the polymer molecular-weight distribution, incorporate long-chain branches, and stereoselectively polymerize α-olefins.</p>
<p>The Phillips catalyst seemingly defies this mechanism. This catalyst, discovered in 1951, currently accounts for 40-50% of global linear high-density polyethylene (PE).</p>
<p>From spectroscopic studies, the major species observed in the reduced Phillips catalyst are isolated CrII sites, which are often interpreted as active species.</p>
<p>These complications limit the understanding of this catalyst.</p>
<p>We found that the CrIII silicates are highly active, in contrast to the CrII analogues, and we propose that ethylene polymerization initiates through the heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on a CrO bond.</p>
<p>This key step is the heterolytic CH activation of ethylene, a process that conserves the oxidation state of chromium and is consistent with the XANES spectrum of [(SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene.</p>
<p>The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, involving four main steps: coordination, olefin insertion, polymer chain growth, and chain transfer. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to nearly a century of study. The mechanism's key step is the heterolytic activation of a CH bond, which conserves the oxidation state of chromium and aligns with the XANES spectrum of the catalyst exposed to ethylene.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应，涉及四个主要步骤：配合、烯烃插入、聚合链增长和链转移。关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤的持续争议仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，尽管已经研究了一个世纪。该机制的关键步骤是异裂激活CH键，这保持了铬的氧化状态，并与催化剂暴露于乙烯时的XANES光谱相一致。
