[1] "The Phillips catalyst, CrO3 dispersed on silica, polymerizes ethylene without an activator."
[2] "Despite 60 years of intensive research, the active sites and the way the first CrC bond is formed remain unknown."
[3] "This study provides clues about the active sites and initiation mechanism of the industrial Phillips catalyst."
[4] "Poisoning studies showed that about 65% of the CrIII sites were active, a far higher proportion than typically observed for the Phillips catalyst."
[5] "Examination of the spent catalyst and isotope labeling experiments showed the formation of a Si(μ-OH)CrIII species, consistent with an initiation mechanism involving the heterolytic activation of ethylene at CrO bonds."
[6] "We propose the following polymerization mechanism (Scheme4): Polymerization is initiated through CH bond activation of ethylene across one of the CrO bonds in [(SiO)6Cr2] (4)."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. It is widely debated which step is the rate-limiting step. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the reactions involved and the variety of factors influencing their rates. The ongoing debate and the scientific interest in this mechanism stem from its importance in various industrial applications, such as petrochemical processes, and the potential for improving efficiency and selectivity in these processes. Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing the economic viability of dehydrogenation reactions.
