The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It consists of four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the substrate molecule by the catalyst, often involving the breaking of a hydrogen bond.
3. Formation of an activated complex where the substrate molecule is bonded to the catalyst in a way that facilitates dehydrogenation.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

Despite extensive study over nearly a century, there is ongoing debate about which of these steps is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the adsorption step is rate-limiting due to the high energy barrier required for substrate molecules to reach the active sites. Others suggest that the activation step is rate-limiting because of the energy required to break the hydrogen bond and create a reactive intermediate. Still, others believe the desorption step is rate-limiting because of the difficulty in removing the product molecules from the catalyst surface efficiently.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its complexity and the importance of understanding it for the development of more efficient catalysts. The mechanism's intricate nature and the dynamic interplay between the steps make it challenging to pinpoint the exact rate-limiting step. Further research is needed to clarify these aspects and improve the efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation processes.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应。它包含四个主要步骤：
1. 将基质分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 催化剂活化基质分子，通常涉及打破氢键。
3. 形成活性复合物，其中基质分子以促进脱氢的方式与催化剂结合。
4. 从催化剂表面脱附产物分子。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，关于哪一步是决定性的仍然存在争议。一些研究人员认为吸附步骤是决定性的，因为需要很高的能量壁垒才能使基质分子到达活性位点。其他人认为活化步骤是决定性的，因为需要能量来打破氢键并产生活性中间体。还有一些人认为脱附步骤是决定性的，因为很难有效地从催化剂表面去除产物分子。

由于其复杂的性质和步骤之间的动态相互作用，霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。为了提高脱氢过程的效率和选择性，需要进一步澄清这些方面和改进机制的理解。
