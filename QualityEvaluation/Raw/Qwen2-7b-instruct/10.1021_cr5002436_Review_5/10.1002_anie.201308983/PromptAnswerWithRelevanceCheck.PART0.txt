[1] "Coordination of ethylene forms the alkylethylene complex B, which undergoes olefin insertion to give C."
[2] "This study provides clues about the active sites and initiation mechanism of the industrial Phillips catalyst."
[3] "The formation of the first CrC bond, key to ethylene polymerization, occurs through heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on the CrIII silicates in [(SiO)6Cr2]."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It consists of four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the substrate molecule by the catalyst, often involving the breaking of a hydrogen bond.
3. Formation of an activated complex where the substrate molecule is bonded to the catalyst in a way that facilitates dehydrogenation.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

Despite extensive study over nearly a century, there is ongoing debate about which of these steps is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the adsorption step is rate-limiting due to the high energy barrier required for substrate molecules to reach the active sites. Others suggest that the activation step is rate-limiting because of the energy required to break the hydrogen bond and create a reactive intermediate. Still, others believe the desorption step is rate-limiting because of the difficulty in removing the product molecules from the catalyst surface efficiently.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its complexity and the importance of understanding it for the development of more efficient catalysts. The mechanism's intricate nature and the dynamic interplay between the steps make it challenging to pinpoint the exact rate-limiting step. Further research is needed to clarify these aspects and improve the efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation processes.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应。它包含四个主要步骤：
1. 将基质分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 催化剂活化基质分子，通常涉及打破氢键。
3. 形成活性复合物，其中基质分子以促进脱氢的方式与催化剂结合。
4. 从催化剂表面脱附产物分子。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，关于哪一步是决定性的仍然存在争议。一些研究人员认为吸附步骤是决定性的，因为需要很高的能量壁垒才能使基质分子到达活性位点。其他人认为活化步骤是决定性的，因为需要能量来打破氢键并产生活性中间体。还有一些人认为脱附步骤是决定性的，因为很难有效地从催化剂表面去除产物分子。

由于其复杂的性质和步骤之间的动态相互作用，霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。为了提高脱氢过程的效率和选择性，需要进一步澄清这些方面和改进机制的理解。

<p>Coordination of ethylene forms the alkylethylene complex B, which undergoes olefin insertion to give C. Growth of the polymer chain is a repetition of this step until chain transfer occurs.</p>
<p>Chain transfer depends on the conditions and chosen catalyst, but generally takes place through β-hydride elimination, transmetalation to an alkyl aluminum species, hydrogenolysis, or through a direct β-proton transfer to a coordinated ethylene molecule.</p>
<p>The metal product then reenters the catalytic cycle.</p>
<p>Exploitation of this general mechanism has led to a large family of catalysts that can polymerize olefins with control of the polymer molecular-weight distribution, incorporate long-chain branches, and stereoselectively polymerize α-olefins.</p>
<p>The Phillips catalyst seemingly defies this mechanism. This catalyst, discovered in 1951, currently accounts for 40-50% of global linear high-density polyethylene (PE).</p>
<p>From spectroscopic studies, the major species observed in the reduced Phillips catalyst are isolated CrII sites, which are often interpreted as active species.</p>
<p>These complications limit the understanding of this catalyst.</p>
<p>We found that the CrIII silicates are highly active, in contrast to the CrII analogues, and we propose that ethylene polymerization initiates through the heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on a CrO bond.</p>
<p>This key step is the heterolytic CH activation of ethylene, a process that conserves the oxidation state of chromium and is consistent with the XANES spectrum of [(SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene.</p>
<p>The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, involving four main steps: coordination, olefin insertion, polymer chain growth, and chain transfer. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to nearly a century of study. The mechanism's key step is the heterolytic activation of a CH bond, which conserves the oxidation state of chromium and aligns with the XANES spectrum of the catalyst exposed to ethylene.

[1] "The key step in this mechanism is the heterolytic CH activation of ethylene, a process that conserves the oxidation state of chromium and is consistent with the XANES spectrum of [(SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene."
[2] "Chain termination could be the microreverse of the initiation step, proton transfer from the coordinated silanol to the carbon atom bound to Cr, or through direct β-proton transfer to a coordinated ethylene to liberate a polymer chain containing olefinic and methyl end groups with regeneration of the neutral CrIII site."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction pathway, which involves four main steps. The ongoing debate in the scientific community concerns which of these steps is rate-limiting. The mechanism typically starts with the adsorption of a hydrogen molecule onto a metal surface. The second step involves the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule into individual hydrogen atoms. The third step is the activation of the hydrogen atoms, where they react with a substrate molecule to form an activated intermediate. Finally, the fourth step is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the intermediate to form the desired product and regenerate the metal surface. Despite a century of study, the precise sequence of events and the rate-determining step are still subjects of discussion among researchers.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction pathways involved and the difficulty in experimentally determining the rates of individual steps. Different metals and substrates may exhibit varying reaction kinetics, leading to diverse mechanisms and interpretations. Moreover, the role of surface defects, the presence of impurities, and the effect of temperature and pressure on the reaction rates are still being explored. This complexity and the lack of consensus on the exact mechanism contribute to the ongoing debate about the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应的途径，涉及四个主要步骤。科学界对这些步骤中哪一步是速率限制步骤存在持续的争论。机制通常从氢分子吸附到金属表面开始。第二步涉及氢分子的分解为单个氢原子。第三步是氢原子的活化，它们与一个基团反应形成活性中间体。最后一步是从中间体中移除一个氢原子，形成所需的产品和再生金属表面。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但事件序列的确切顺序和速率限制步骤仍然是研究人员讨论的话题。

霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因在于反应路径的复杂性以及确定个别步骤速率的难度。不同金属和基团可能表现出不同的反应动力学，导致不同的机制和解释。此外，表面缺陷、杂质的存在以及温度和压力对反应速率的影响仍在探索之中。这种复杂性和关于霍里图-波兰尼机制速率限制步骤的缺乏共识推动了这一持续的争论。

[1] "The ligand environment around the chromium center is critical for metal-silicate formation. We chose tri-tert-butoxysiloxy (OSi(OtBu)3) as a ligand for the coordination of chromium because these complexes are known to decompose at relatively low temperatures (ca. 200°C) into silica materials through the loss of isobutene, tert-butanol, and water."
[2] "Cr{N(SiMe3)2}22THF was treated with two equivalents of HOSi(OtBu)3 to give the blue crystalline CrII dimer [{Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)2}2] (1) in 60% yield."
[3] "Compound 1 contains two chromium atoms in distorted square-planar geometries, typical for high-spin CrII species."
[4] "The polymerization activity of [(SiO)4Cr2] was monitored at a low ethylene pressure (ca. 300 mbar) in a glass reactor equipped with an IR cell."
[5] "The results of the EXAFS analysis of 5 and [(SiO)6Cr2] are given in Table 1 and show similar environments between the molecular and the surface species."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed within the provided literature. The text focuses on the synthesis and characterization of chromium silicate catalysts for ethylene polymerization. It describes the formation of well-defined dinuclear CrII and CrIII sites on silica, where the CrIII sites are found to be highly active for ethylene polymerization. The mechanism for ethylene polymerization is proposed to involve heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on the CrIII silicate surface, leading to the formation of a chromium-vinyl species that can insert ethylene and continue polymer growth. This mechanism is distinct from traditional olefin-insertion polymerization catalysts and opens new avenues for manipulating these materials to produce a wider range of polymer properties.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应的机理没有在提供的文献中进行讨论。文本专注于铬硅酸盐催化剂的合成和表征，用于乙烯聚合。它描述了在硅胶上形成定义明确的二核CrII和CrIII位点，其中CrIII位点被发现对乙烯聚合非常有效。提出的乙烯聚合机制涉及通过CrIII硅酸盐表面异裂乙烯的CH键活化来启动乙烯聚合，导致形成含铬乙烯基物种，该物种可以插入乙烯并继续聚合增长。这一机制与传统的共轭烯烃插入聚合催化剂不同，并为这些材料提供了一条新途径，以生产更广泛的聚合物性质。
