[1] "Since its experimental isolation at the turn of the new millennium, graphene has fascinated physicists due to its unique electronic structure."
[2] "But more recently, the chemistry community has also realized its potential significance: During a typical heterogeneous catalytic cycle, the reaction of a carbon source (carbon oxides or hydrocarbons) at the surface of an active transition metal (TM) can lead to the formation of various condensed carbonaceous phases."
[3] "Understanding the formation and development of these various phases on the surfaces of relevant materials, and assessing their stability and reactivity, proves hence to be of utmost importance."
[4] "Graphene growth involves a series of complicated reactions, whereby dehydrogenation of the carbon source occurs at relatively low temperatures (<800 K), followed and/or paralleled by a transition from carbidic species into a graphitic film at higher temperatures (>900 K)."
[5] "Yet, many aspects of the growth mechanism(s) are not fully understood."
[6] "Although observed by several research groups, the fundamental carbidic building blocks have not been formally identified and little is known about their atomic-scale structure, thermal stability, and electronic properties."
[7] "Addressing these issues constitutes a pivotal requirement for our ability to create graphene in a well-controlled and reproducible manner, to tailor the physical and chemical properties of graphene-based nanoscale devices (as of interest to physicists), and to devise strategies either promoting the stability or suppressing the formation of the various carbon phases on TM-based catalysts (as of interest to chemists)."
[8] "The nucleation and growth mechanisms of graphene on Rh(111) via temperature-programmed growth of C2H4 are studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, and by density functional theory calculations."
[9] "By combining our experimental and first-principles approaches, we show that carbon nanoislands form in the initial stages of graphene growth, possessing an exclusive size of seven honeycomb carbon units (hereafter labeled as 7C6)."
[10] "These clusters adopt a domelike hexagonal shape indicating that bonding to the substrate is localized on the peripheral C atoms."
[11] "Smoluchowski ripening is identified as the dominant mechanism leading to the formation of graphene, with the size-selective carbon islands as precursors."
[12] "Control experiments and calculations, whereby coronene molecules, the hydrogenated analogues of 7C6, are deposited on Rh(111), provide an unambiguous structural and chemical identification of the 7C6 building blocks."
[13] "The results presented in Figure 1 indicate that thermal decomposition of ethene at temperatures below 770 K leads to the formation of surface carbon species."
[14] "This involves structural rearrangements of CC bonds and dehydrogenation (CH bond scission)."
[15] "But remarkably, the carbon species evolve toward a monodispersed structural entity that is randomly scattered across the entire surface, with no preferential attachment to defects such as step edges."
[16] "The pronounced decrease in particle density observed at 870 K further suggests that the monodispersed particles start to diffuse within the Rh(111) terraces and eventually coalesce to form well-ordered graphene structures, which are mostly (but not exclusively) found attached to step edges."
[17] "At 973 K (Figure 1d), the much stronger diffusion (hence higher mobility) of the carbon clusters is accompanied by further growth of graphene islands to almost completion."
[18] "As directly observed in Figure 1c (and confirmed by Figure 1e), one realizes that at high temperatures 7C6 is the only species present on the Rh(111) surface besides graphene flakes."
[19] "The morphology evolution observed in panels bd in Figure 1 can hence be described by Smoluchowski ripening (that is, the decline of island density through diffusion and coalescence of mobile islands upon contact), in line with previous conclusions drawn for other TM substrates such as Ru and Ir."
[20] "More specifically, the high diffusivity of the 1 nm carbon clusters accounts for their reduction in population observed above 870 K."
[21] "During their surface migration, the nanoislands encounter step edges where their attachment is enhanced and their mobility likely decreased, allowing for extended graphene islands to grow by coalescence and incorporation of further carbon nanoislands."
[22] "We can estimate the number of carbon atoms deposited on the Rh(111) surface upon saturation with ethene using STM images similar to Figure 1a."
[23] "Our statistical analysis yields 6.5 × 10^14 carbon atoms/cm^2 (with a Rh(111) lattice parameter of 2.69 Å)."
[24] "Furthermore, images such as Figure 1d allow us to estimate that the area of the Rh(111) surface covered by graphene at completion of the TPG is 18  2%."
[25] "Considering a CC bond distance of 1.42 Å for graphene (i.e., 3.83 × 10^15 carbon atoms/cm^2), we deduce that (6.9  0.7) × 10^14 carbon atoms/cm^2 are involved in our graphene islands."
[26] "From the height contrast in the STM image of 7C6 and from the measured height profile (Figure 2), one gets the visual impression (under these tunneling conditions) that the central benzene unit lies higher than its surrounding neighbors, evocative of a dome-like shaped configuration with a total height of about 2 Å."
[27] "In order to fully establish the structural and chemical identity of these carbon nanoclusters, and to discover the reasons of this lower size limit, we now proceed to further STM data, local spectroscopy measurements, and DFT calculations."
[28] "Our experimental and theoretical results on 7C6 will be compared to investigations we carried on coronene molecules (C24H12) adsorbed on Rh(111), the hydrogenated analogues of 7C6, allowing also for conclusions to be drawn on the effect of hybridization and hydrogen functionalization on the chemical bonding of nanographene molecules with the TM substrate."
[29] "In Figure 3, we put side by side topographic images of 7C6 (obtained by the thermal decomposition of ethene at high temperatures) and coronene (obtained by molecular evaporation at 300 K) on Rh(111)."
[30] "Direct comparison indicates that, irrespective of the tunneling bias applied (1 or +1 V), coronene molecules are imaged broader than 7C6 whereas the electronic height of the latter is larger by 0.5 Å (see height profiles in Figure 3e)."
[31] "At both positive and negative bias, 7C6 exhibits a slightly truncated hexagonal shape with a polarity-dependent orientation."
[32] "Indeed, the results presented in Figure 3 provide a first experimental indication that the carbon clusters evolving from ethene decomposition on Rh(111) are not comparable to coronene molecules and their likely molecular structure is hence the one we ascribed to 7C6, that is, a fully dehydrogenated and 3-fold symmetric carbon nanoisland of precisely 24 carbon atoms."
[33] "Let alone, however, this deduction does not explain the occurrence of size-selective carbon clusters during growth."
[34] "In order to shed more light, we theoretically investigated the adsorption of NC6 carbon clusters on the Rh(111) surface, where N indexes the number of honeycomb rings contained within each cluster."
[35] "Figure 5 reveals that the atoms at the periphery of the carbon species constitute the important structural parameter governing the interaction of NC6 with the Rh(111) substrate, in line with a recent theoretical report."
[36] "Indeed, we see that both ECM and ECC show a linear dependence (with opposite trend) with the ratio NP/NT."
[37] "In particular, ECM decreases with NP/NT indicating that the NC6 species bind to the Rh(111) substrate mainly through the peripheral atoms."
[38] "Interestingly, when comparing the variation of ETOT as a function of N with reference to the corresponding energy of the isolated carbon adatom in Figure 5, it becomes apparent that the aggregation of carbon into clusters equal or larger in size than 7C6 is energetically favored."
[39] "Since clusters larger than 7C6 have even lower energies, we conclude that the 7C6 species will eventually grow into larger graphene islands at high enough temperatures."
[40] "These theoretical conclusions remarkably support our STM observations of 7C6 clusters obtained by the dehydrogenation of ethene on Rh(111) and allow us to conclude that these monodispersed species are the fundamental precursors to the formation of graphene on a Rh(111) substrate."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a proposed sequence of steps in which hydrogen atoms are removed from a hydrocarbon molecule to produce a smaller hydrocarbon or an alkene. The mechanism typically involves four main steps:

1. Activation: The catalyst surface binds a molecule of hydrogen (H2) to form a surface complex.
2. Proton Transfer: A hydrogen atom from the H2 molecule is transferred to the molecule being dehydrogenated, forming a hydrogenated complex.
3. Bond Breaking: The H2 molecule is released, and the hydrogen atom from the hydrogenated complex is transferred to another molecule, breaking a bond in the original molecule.
4. Product Formation: The molecule undergoes a rearrangement to form the product, often releasing heat.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often depends on the specific conditions and the type of catalyst used. Some researchers argue that the activation step is the slowest, while others believe that the bond-breaking step might control the reaction rate.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the reactions involved and the difficulty in accurately modeling them. Researchers continue to explore the mechanism's intricacies to better understand the factors that influence the efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions and to develop more effective catalysts.

The mechanism's relevance extends beyond academia, as it impacts industrial processes such as refining crude oil and producing petrochemicals. Understanding the mechanism helps in optimizing these processes to enhance yield and reduce costs.

The scientific interest in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is driven by its practical applications and the potential for technological advancements. Continued research aims to refine the mechanism, uncover new insights, and improve existing catalysts for a wide range of applications, from energy production to materials science.

In summary, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism provides a framework for understanding dehydrogenation reactions, but its complexities and the evolving nature of catalysis research mean that it remains a subject of active investigation and debate. This mechanism's continued relevance underscores the importance of studying catalytic processes to advance technology and industry.
