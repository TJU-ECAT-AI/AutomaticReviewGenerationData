[1] "Our statistical analysis yields 6.5 × 1014 carbon atoms/cm2 (with a Rh(111) lattice parameter of 2.69 Å)."
[2] "Considering a CC bond distance of 1.42 Å for graphene (i.e., 3.83 × 1015 carbon atoms/cm2), we deduce that (6.9  0.7) × 1014 carbon atoms/cm2 are involved in our graphene islands."
[3] "From the height contrast in the STM image of 7C6 and from the measured height profile, one gets the visual impression (under these tunneling conditions) that the central benzene unit lies higher than its surrounding neighbors, evocative of a dome-like shaped configuration with a total height of about 2 Å."
[4] "At positive polarity, coronene is imaged as hexagonal, whereas at negative polarity, it is imaged with a richer contrast whereby the molecule is resolved as a slightly distorted hexagon but, surprisingly, with two intense and broad lobes on two opposite sides."
[5] "The topographic contrast obtained over coronene is markedly different to the one obtained over 7C6. At positive polarity, coronene is imaged as hexagonal, whereas at negative polarity, it is imaged with a richer contrast whereby the molecule is resolved as a slightly distorted hexagon but, surprisingly, with two intense and broad lobes on two opposite sides."
[6] "For the adsorption of carbon adatoms, we studied by DFT six different coverages: 1/9 ML, 1/6 ML, 1/4 ML, 1/2 ML, 3/4 ML, and 1 ML."
[7] "Note that the energy values of the adsorbed carbon monomer or clusters reported here correspond to the preferred adsorption geometries (see discussion below)."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its four main steps and the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The mechanism involves:

1. Activation of the molecule (e.g., ethane) by a catalyst, leading to the formation of an activated complex.
2. Intramolecular rearrangement of the activated complex, typically involving the breaking of a hydrogen bond or a C-H bond.
3. Formation of a product (e.g., ethylene) and the release of heat or another molecule (e.g., water).
4. Decomposition of the product to regenerate the catalyst and prepare it for the next cycle.

Despite nearly a century of study, the specific step that determines the rate of the reaction remains a topic of debate. Some researchers argue that the activation step is rate-limiting, while others propose that the intramolecular rearrangement or the decomposition of the product might be the rate-determining step.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it provides insight into the complex interplay between the catalyst, the substrate, and the reaction pathway. The mechanism's intricacies can help in designing more efficient catalysts and reaction conditions, which is crucial for industries that rely on dehydrogenation reactions for the production of various chemicals and fuels.

In summary, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is significant due to its potential to enhance the efficiency of industrial processes. However, the ongoing debate regarding the rate-determining step underscores the complexity of these reactions and the need for continued research to optimize catalysts and reaction conditions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制是一个科学兴趣和争议的焦点，因为它涉及四个主要步骤以及关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的持续辩论。机制包括：

1. 在催化剂作用下激活分子（例如乙烷），导致形成活性复合物。
2. 活性复合物内的分子重排，通常涉及氢键或C-H键的断裂。
3. 形成产物（例如乙烯）并释放热量或其他分子（例如水）。
4. 分解产物以再生催化剂并为下一个循环做准备。

尽管已经研究了一个世纪之久，确定反应速率的具体步骤仍然是一个争论的话题。一些研究人员认为激活步骤是速率决定性的，而其他人则提出产物分解可能是速率决定性的。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制之所以具有科学兴趣，是因为它提供了催化剂、基质和反应途径之间复杂相互作用的见解。该机制的细微差别可以帮助设计更高效的催化剂和反应条件，这对于依赖脱氢反应生产各种化学品和燃料的工业来说至关重要。

总之，Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应的重要性在于其提高工业过程效率的潜力。然而，关于速率决定步骤的持续辩论突显了这些反应的复杂性，以及继续研究以优化催化剂和反应条件的必要性。
