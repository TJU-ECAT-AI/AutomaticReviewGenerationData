The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon molecule, followed by a concerted rearrangement of the remaining atoms. This process is considered rapid due to the low activation energy barrier. However, the exact rate-limiting step in the mechanism is a subject of ongoing debate among scientists. Some argue that the abstraction step is the most significant, while others suggest the rearrangement step might have a higher activation energy. Despite these discussions, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a crucial concept in the field of catalytic dehydrogenation, offering insights into the process's dynamics.

霍里图-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：从烃分子中提取一个氢原子，随后是剩余原子的协同重排。这一过程被认为由于激活能壁垒较低而迅速。然而，该机制的精确限速步骤仍然是科学界持续讨论的话题。一些人认为提取步骤最为关键，而其他人则认为重组步骤可能具有更高的激活能。尽管这些讨论，霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是催化脱氢理解的关键概念，为过程的动力学提供见解。
