Answer: The growth of graphene on Rh(111) via temperature-programmed growth of C2H4 is studied using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, along with density functional theory calculations. In the initial stages of graphene growth, carbon nanoislands form, characterized by an exclusive size of seven honeycomb carbon units (7C6). These clusters exhibit a domelike hexagonal shape, with bonding localized on the peripheral carbon atoms. Smoluchowski ripening is recognized as the primary mechanism facilitating graphene formation, with the 7C6 carbon islands serving as precursors. Control experiments and calculations involving the deposition of coronene molecules, the hydrogenated analogues of 7C6, confirm the structural and chemical identity of the 7C6 building blocks.

研究了通过程序升温法生长C2H4在Rh(111)上的石墨烯的成核和生长机制，使用扫描隧道显微镜和光谱学以及密度泛函理论计算。在石墨烯生长的初期阶段，形成碳纳米岛，其大小为七个六角碳单元（7C6）。这些簇呈现类似穹顶的六边形形状，其中的结合主要集中在边缘的碳原子上。Smoluchowski凝聚被识别为形成石墨烯的主要机制，而具有选择性的碳岛屿是前体。控制实验和涉及在Rh(111)上沉积冠烯分子（7C6的氢化衍生物）的计算确认了7C6构建块的结构和化学身份。
