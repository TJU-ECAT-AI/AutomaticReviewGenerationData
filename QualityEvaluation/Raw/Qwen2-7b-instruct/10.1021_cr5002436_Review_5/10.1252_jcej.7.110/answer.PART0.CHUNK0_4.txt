[1] "In isopentane dehydrogenation over chromia-alumina catalyst, the conversion of isopentane and the yield of isopentenes decreased rapidly with process time while that of isoprene did so very slowly."
[2] "Coke deposition on catalyst and catalyst fouling occurred in an integral catalytic reactor, and coke distribution was observed along the axial direction of the reactor."
[3] "For isopentane dehydrogenation a kinetic model in which the main reaction was consecutive and the sub-reaction was parallel is proposed."
[4] "For estimating distributed kinetic parameters with catalyst fouling, an algorithm that involves two calculating steps is introduced."
[5] "Applying an activity factor which accounts for catalyst fouling and which is a linear function of coke content, the kinetic parameters were estimated."
[6] "Using these parameters, the changes of the concentration and the distribution of coke content with process time were simulated fairly well."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. These steps are:
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the surface of the catalyst.
2. Formation of an intermediate species by breaking the reactant molecule into smaller fragments.
3. Transformation of the intermediate species into the desired product through a series of chemical reactions.
4. Desorption of the product molecules from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The reason for this is that the rate-limiting step can vary depending on the specific reactant, catalyst, and conditions being used. Some studies suggest that the adsorption step is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the desorption step plays this role. Additionally, the rate of the intermediate species formation and transformation can also significantly impact the overall reaction rate.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to be a topic of interest due to its widespread application in various industrial processes, such as refining, petrochemical production, and the synthesis of various chemicals. Understanding the rate-limiting step in this mechanism helps in optimizing the reaction conditions and improving the efficiency of the processes involved.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。这些步骤是：
1. 将反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 通过将反应物分子分解成更小的碎片形成中间物种。
3. 中间物种通过一系列化学反应转化为所需产物。
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面解吸。

关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制中哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的争论仍然是科学研究的一个热点问题。原因在于，速率限制步骤可能根据所使用的特定反应物、催化剂和条件而变化。一些研究认为吸附步骤是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则提出这一角色由解吸步骤扮演。此外，中间物种的形成和转化的速度也可能显著影响整体反应速率。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是一个感兴趣的话题，因为它在炼油、石油化工生产和各种化学品合成等领域有着广泛的应用。理解该机制中的速率限制步骤有助于优化反应条件并提高过程效率。
