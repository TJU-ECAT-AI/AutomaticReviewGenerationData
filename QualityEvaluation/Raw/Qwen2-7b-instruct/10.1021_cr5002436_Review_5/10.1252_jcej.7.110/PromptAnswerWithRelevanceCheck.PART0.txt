1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
   1. Adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface.
   2. Formation of an activated complex by breaking the substrate's bonds.
   3. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface.
   4. Activation of the catalyst, allowing the cycle to repeat. 
   
   The ongoing debate centers around which step is considered rate-limiting, with some arguing that it's the adsorption step, others the desorption step, and yet others claim it's the formation of the activated complex. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the interactions involved.

2. To estimate distributed kinetic parameters with catalyst fouling, an algorithm involving two calculating steps is introduced. This approach helps in accounting for the changes in reaction rates due to the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface over time.

3. The variations in the carbon-to-hydrogen ratios (G/H) among different researchers could be attributed to the intricate nature of the coke formation mechanisms specific to each reaction. Different reactions might involve different pathways leading to coke formation, influencing the resulting G/H ratios.

4. An internal-recycle catalytic reactor, which allows for perfect mixing conditions, is described for evaluating the effects of intraparticle mass transfer on reaction rates and yields in consecutive hydrogenation reactions. This type of reactor offers advantages over integral tubular reactors, providing simpler mathematical formulations and direct evaluations of reaction rates.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is based on four primary steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface.  
2. Activation of the substrate molecule by breaking one or more bonds through a high-energy transition state. 
3. Formation of an intermediate species on the catalyst surface.  
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. 

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting depends on the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the catalyst. The activation step is often identified as the rate-determining step due to the high energy barrier involved. However, the efficiency of the adsorption and desorption processes can also significantly impact the reaction rate.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it helps in understanding the fundamental processes occurring at the catalyst surface, which can lead to improvements in catalytic performance. Researchers continue to investigate how modifying the catalyst properties, such as its surface area, porosity, and composition, can alter the rates of these steps and enhance the overall reaction efficiency.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to evolve as new insights are gained into the dynamics of catalytic reactions. This ongoing research contributes to advancements in catalysis, which plays a crucial role in numerous industrial processes, including petrochemical production, energy conversion, and environmental remediation.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制基于四个主要步骤：
1. 原子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 通过高能过渡态断裂一个或多个分子键，激活底物分子。
3. 在催化剂表面上形成中间物种。
4. 产物从催化剂表面解吸。

关于哪个步骤被认为是决定性的，这取决于特定的反应条件和催化剂的性质。通常认为激活步骤是决定性的，因为它涉及较高的能量壁垒。然而，吸附和解吸过程的效率也可能显著影响反应速率。

由于它有助于理解发生在催化剂表面的基本过程，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。研究人员继续研究如何通过改变催化剂的性质，如表面积、孔隙率和组成，来改变这些步骤的速率和提高整体反应效率。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍在不断发展，新的见解正在不断获得对催化反应动态的理解。这一持续的研究为催化技术的发展做出了贡献，催化技术在石油化学生产、能源转换和环境修复等多个工业过程中起着至关重要的作用。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions describes the following four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the substrate molecule by breaking a bond, usually involving the assistance of a catalyst species.
3. Formation of a reactive intermediate, which often involves the participation of the catalyst.
4. Release of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in dehydrogenation reactions primarily revolves around the activation step (step 2). Some researchers argue that the activation barrier for breaking a bond in the substrate molecule is high, making it the rate-determining step. Others propose that the subsequent steps, particularly the formation of the reactive intermediate (step 3), might be more challenging and thus rate-limiting. The specific role of each step depends on the nature of the catalyst, the substrate, and the reaction conditions.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its complexity and the variability of factors influencing the reaction kinetics. The mechanism's applicability to different types of dehydrogenation reactions and the identification of the true rate-limiting step continue to attract research efforts. The development of kinetic models, such as the one discussed in the literature, aims to better understand and predict the behavior of dehydrogenation reactions under various conditions, thereby providing insights into optimizing industrial processes and catalyst design.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述了以下四个主要步骤：

1. 将底物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 通过催化剂物种的帮助，活化底物分子并断裂一个键。
3. 形成活性中间体，这通常涉及催化剂的参与。
4. 从催化剂表面释放产物分子。

关于哪一步被认为是决定速率的争议主要集中在激活步骤（步骤2）。一些研究人员认为，断裂底物分子中键的活化壁垒很高，因此是决定速率的关键步骤。其他人则认为随后的步骤，特别是形成活性中间体（步骤3），可能更具挑战性，从而成为决定速率的关键步骤。具体作用取决于催化剂、底物和反应条件的性质。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这一机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它具有复杂性和在不同条件下影响反应动力学的各种因素的变异性。机制对不同类型脱氢反应的适用性以及确定真正决定速率的步骤继续吸引研究努力。开发动力学模型旨在更好地理解并预测不同条件下的脱氢反应行为，从而提供优化工业过程和催化剂设计的见解。

1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps: isopentane transforms into isopentenes, isopentenes further transforms into isoprene, and the process is accompanied by coke formation. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting depends on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst properties. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the influence of various factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst type.

2. The values of the carbon-to-hydrogen ratio (G/H) for coke components vary among researchers because of the complexity involved in the coke formation mechanism for each reaction. This complexity includes factors such as polymerization and adsorption processes that contribute to the formation of coke.

3. Various functions representing the relationship between coke content and catalyst activity have been proposed by Anderson and Whitehouse to express catalyst fouling. These functions are crucial for understanding how the catalyst's performance changes over time due to the accumulation of coke.

4. Recently, lumped activity factors as functions of process time have been developed for reactor design and optimization. These factors are used to model the distribution of catalyst activity through the reactor, providing insights into how the catalyst's efficiency evolves over time.

5. The dehydrogenation process is accompanied by coke formation, which affects the catalyst's performance and efficiency.

6. In the context of the current work, the activation energy for coke formation via isopentenes is determined to be 12.6 kcal/g-mol, while the activation energy via isoprene is -10.6 kcal/g-mol. These values reflect the energy required for the respective pathways of coke formation.

7. At lower temperatures and with less coke content, it is sufficient to use the simplified activity factor (Eq. 16-2) for modeling the changes in concentration and coke content distributions. Moreover, the reaction orders (p, q) might be (1,1) based on the graphical representation provided in Fig. 10, indicating a first-order reaction in terms of both reactant and product concentrations.

[2] "Coke deposition on catalyst and catalyst fouling occurred in an integral catalytic reactor, and coke distribution was observed along the axial direction of the reactor."
[3] "For isopentane dehydrogenation a kinetic model in which the main reaction was consecutive and the sub-reaction was parallel is proposed."
[4] "For estimating distributed kinetic parameters with catalyst fouling, an algorithm that involves two calculating steps is introduced."
[5] "Applying an activity factor which accounts for catalyst fouling and which is a linear function of coke content, the kinetic parameters were estimated."
[6] "Using these parameters, the changes of the concentration and the distribution of coke content with process time were simulated fairly well."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. These steps are:
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the surface of the catalyst.
2. Formation of an intermediate species by breaking the reactant molecule into smaller fragments.
3. Transformation of the intermediate species into the desired product through a series of chemical reactions.
4. Desorption of the product molecules from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The reason for this is that the rate-limiting step can vary depending on the specific reactant, catalyst, and conditions being used. Some studies suggest that the adsorption step is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the desorption step plays this role. Additionally, the rate of the intermediate species formation and transformation can also significantly impact the overall reaction rate.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to be a topic of interest due to its widespread application in various industrial processes, such as refining, petrochemical production, and the synthesis of various chemicals. Understanding the rate-limiting step in this mechanism helps in optimizing the reaction conditions and improving the efficiency of the processes involved.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。这些步骤是：
1. 将反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 通过将反应物分子分解成更小的碎片形成中间物种。
3. 中间物种通过一系列化学反应转化为所需产物。
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面解吸。

关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制中哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的争论仍然是科学研究的一个热点问题。原因在于，速率限制步骤可能根据所使用的特定反应物、催化剂和条件而变化。一些研究认为吸附步骤是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则提出这一角色由解吸步骤扮演。此外，中间物种的形成和转化的速度也可能显著影响整体反应速率。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是一个感兴趣的话题，因为它在炼油、石油化工生产和各种化学品合成等领域有着广泛的应用。理解该机制中的速率限制步骤有助于优化反应条件并提高过程效率。
