The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions describes the following four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the substrate molecule by breaking a bond, usually involving the assistance of a catalyst species.
3. Formation of a reactive intermediate, which often involves the participation of the catalyst.
4. Release of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in dehydrogenation reactions primarily revolves around the activation step (step 2). Some researchers argue that the activation barrier for breaking a bond in the substrate molecule is high, making it the rate-determining step. Others propose that the subsequent steps, particularly the formation of the reactive intermediate (step 3), might be more challenging and thus rate-limiting. The specific role of each step depends on the nature of the catalyst, the substrate, and the reaction conditions.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its complexity and the variability of factors influencing the reaction kinetics. The mechanism's applicability to different types of dehydrogenation reactions and the identification of the true rate-limiting step continue to attract research efforts. The development of kinetic models, such as the one discussed in the literature, aims to better understand and predict the behavior of dehydrogenation reactions under various conditions, thereby providing insights into optimizing industrial processes and catalyst design.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述了以下四个主要步骤：

1. 将底物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 通过催化剂物种的帮助，活化底物分子并断裂一个键。
3. 形成活性中间体，这通常涉及催化剂的参与。
4. 从催化剂表面释放产物分子。

关于哪一步被认为是决定速率的争议主要集中在激活步骤（步骤2）。一些研究人员认为，断裂底物分子中键的活化壁垒很高，因此是决定速率的关键步骤。其他人则认为随后的步骤，特别是形成活性中间体（步骤3），可能更具挑战性，从而成为决定速率的关键步骤。具体作用取决于催化剂、底物和反应条件的性质。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这一机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它具有复杂性和在不同条件下影响反应动力学的各种因素的变异性。机制对不同类型脱氢反应的适用性以及确定真正决定速率的步骤继续吸引研究努力。开发动力学模型旨在更好地理解并预测不同条件下的脱氢反应行为，从而提供优化工业过程和催化剂设计的见解。
