1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
   1. Adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface.
   2. Formation of an activated complex by breaking the substrate's bonds.
   3. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface.
   4. Activation of the catalyst, allowing the cycle to repeat. 
   
   The ongoing debate centers around which step is considered rate-limiting, with some arguing that it's the adsorption step, others the desorption step, and yet others claim it's the formation of the activated complex. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the interactions involved.

2. To estimate distributed kinetic parameters with catalyst fouling, an algorithm involving two calculating steps is introduced. This approach helps in accounting for the changes in reaction rates due to the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface over time.

3. The variations in the carbon-to-hydrogen ratios (G/H) among different researchers could be attributed to the intricate nature of the coke formation mechanisms specific to each reaction. Different reactions might involve different pathways leading to coke formation, influencing the resulting G/H ratios.

4. An internal-recycle catalytic reactor, which allows for perfect mixing conditions, is described for evaluating the effects of intraparticle mass transfer on reaction rates and yields in consecutive hydrogenation reactions. This type of reactor offers advantages over integral tubular reactors, providing simpler mathematical formulations and direct evaluations of reaction rates.

1. 催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：
   1. 底物在催化剂表面的吸附。
   2. 通过断裂底物分子键形成活性复合物。
   3. 产物从催化剂表面脱附。
   4. 激活催化剂，使其循环重复。  
   
   对于哪个步骤是决定性步骤的争论仍在继续，一些人认为是吸附步骤，另一些人则认为是脱附步骤，还有人主张是形成活性复合物的步骤。尽管该机制的研究已有近一个世纪的历史，但其仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因在于所涉及的相互作用的复杂性。

2. 为了估计催化失活时的分布式动力学参数，引入了一个包含两个计算步骤的算法。这种方法有助于考虑到催化剂表面积炭累积对反应速率的变化。

3. 不同研究人员之间碳/氢比（G/H）的差异可能是由于每种反应中积炭形成机制的复杂性质造成的。不同的反应可能涉及不同的路径导致积炭形成，影响最终的G/H比值。

4. 描述了一种内部循环催化反应器，它可以在完美的混合条件下运行，用于评估连续氢化反应中粒子内质量传递对反应速率和产率的影响。这种类型的反应器相对于整定管式反应器提供了更简单的数学模型，并可以直接评估反应速率。
