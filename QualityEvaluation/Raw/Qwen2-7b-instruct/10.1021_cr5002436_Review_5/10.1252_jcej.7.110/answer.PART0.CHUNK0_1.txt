[1] "For estimating distributed kinetic parameters with catalyst fouling,an algorithm that involves two calculating steps is introduced."
[2] "The dehydrogenation ofisopentane was studied in an integral packed reactor at various levels of temperature and contact time, and the distribution of coke content was measured."
[3] "The conversion of isopentane and the yields of isopentenes decreased rapidly with process time while that of isoprene did so very slowly."
[4] "The reason why the values of G/H (carbon/hydrogen) were different among investigators might be due to the complexity of the coke formation mechanism for each reaction."
[5] "In the case of both lower temperature and less coke content,it is sufficient to use Eq.(16-2) and,also,it may be permissible that the reaction orders,(p,q),are (1,1) according to Fig.10."
[6] "The reactor has the advantages that accurate reaction rates are directly obtained,and that mathematical formulation is simpler than with an integral reactor."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is based on four primary steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface.  
2. Activation of the substrate molecule by breaking one or more bonds through a high-energy transition state. 
3. Formation of an intermediate species on the catalyst surface.  
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. 

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting depends on the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the catalyst. The activation step is often identified as the rate-determining step due to the high energy barrier involved. However, the efficiency of the adsorption and desorption processes can also significantly impact the reaction rate.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it helps in understanding the fundamental processes occurring at the catalyst surface, which can lead to improvements in catalytic performance. Researchers continue to investigate how modifying the catalyst properties, such as its surface area, porosity, and composition, can alter the rates of these steps and enhance the overall reaction efficiency.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to evolve as new insights are gained into the dynamics of catalytic reactions. This ongoing research contributes to advancements in catalysis, which plays a crucial role in numerous industrial processes, including petrochemical production, energy conversion, and environmental remediation.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制基于四个主要步骤：
1. 原子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 通过高能过渡态断裂一个或多个分子键，激活底物分子。
3. 在催化剂表面上形成中间物种。
4. 产物从催化剂表面解吸。

关于哪个步骤被认为是决定性的，这取决于特定的反应条件和催化剂的性质。通常认为激活步骤是决定性的，因为它涉及较高的能量壁垒。然而，吸附和解吸过程的效率也可能显著影响反应速率。

由于它有助于理解发生在催化剂表面的基本过程，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。研究人员继续研究如何通过改变催化剂的性质，如表面积、孔隙率和组成，来改变这些步骤的速率和提高整体反应效率。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍在不断发展，新的见解正在不断获得对催化反应动态的理解。这一持续的研究为催化技术的发展做出了贡献，催化技术在石油化学生产、能源转换和环境修复等多个工业过程中起着至关重要的作用。
