The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in the early 20th century, describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction of hydrocarbons over metal surfaces. It involves four main steps: activation, migration, reaction, and regeneration. There is ongoing debate within the scientific community regarding which step of this mechanism is rate-limiting. Despite extensive research over the past century, the mechanism remains a topic of interest due to its relevance in catalysis and its potential applications in industrial processes.
