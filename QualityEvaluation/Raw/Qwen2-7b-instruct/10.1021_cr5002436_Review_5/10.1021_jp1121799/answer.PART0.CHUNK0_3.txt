Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been employed to investigate the adsorption characteristics of propane and propene on Pt(111) and PtSn alloy surfaces. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four primary stages: activation, hydrogen transfer, dehydrogenation, and product release. The debate over which stage acts as the rate-determining step in this mechanism has persisted for almost a century. This mechanism continues to attract scientific interest due to its significance in elucidating the chemistry of dehydrogenation reactions and its practical implications in sectors like petrochemical processing.

密度泛函理论（DFT）已被广泛用于研究丙烷和丙烯在Pt(111)和PtSn合金表面的吸附性质。霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：激活、氢转移、脱氢和产物释放。关于该机制中哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的争论已经持续了近一个世纪。由于其对理解脱氢反应化学的实质及其在石油化学加工等行业的实际应用的重要性，这一机制仍然是科学界关注的焦点。
