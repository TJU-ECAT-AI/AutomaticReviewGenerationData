<p>The band at 3,745 cm1 is consistent with isolated silanols, which are also present before ethylene treatment in the pristine CO-reduced Phillips material.</p>
<p>After polymerization, the band is shifted to 3,692 cm1 and corresponds to silanols interacting with alkyl chains.</p>
<p>Noteworthy are the two red-shifted OH vibrations in Fig. 2 at 3,646 and 3,605 cm1, at positions nearly identical to what is observed on well-defined Cr(III) silicate [15], and assigned to silanols interacting with a nearby Lewis-acidic chromium center [18].</p>
<p>Contacting the CO-reduced Phillips catalyst with ethylene-d4 gives an IR spectrum that lacks signals at 3,646 and 3,605 cm1, but does contain new OD vibrations at 2,607 and 2,580 cm1 as expected from the harmonic oscillator approximation (2,604 and 2,575 cm1).</p>

The study reveals that upon contact with ethylene, the CO-reduced Phillips catalyst displays specific infrared (IR) bands at 3,646 and 3,605 cm−1, which are attributed to silanols interacting with a nearby Lewis-acidic chromium center. These bands are consistent with the heterolytic activation of ethylene over a CrO bond in the material, forming a chromium-vinyl species capable of inserting ethylene to grow the polymer chain. This mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond in ethylene over a chromium oxide (CrO) bond, leading to the formation of a chromium-vinyl species that can initiate the polymerization process.

研究表明，当与乙烯接触时，CO还原的菲尔斯催化剂显示出特定的红外（IR）波长在3,646和3,605 cm−1，这些波长归因于与附近Lewis酸性铬中心相互作用的硅醇。这些波长与材料中CrO键上乙烯的异裂激活一致，形成能够插入乙烯以增长聚合链的铬-乙烯物种。这一机制涉及乙烯CH键在铬氧化物（CrO）键上的异裂激活，导致形成可以启动聚合过程的铬-乙烯物种。
