<p>The band at 3,745 cm1 is consistent with isolated silanols, which are also present before ethylene treatment in the pristine CO-reduced Phillips material.</p>
<p>After polymerization, the band is shifted to 3,692 cm1 and corresponds to silanols interacting with alkyl chains.</p>
<p>Noteworthy are the two red-shifted OH vibrations in Fig. 2 at 3,646 and 3,605 cm1, at positions nearly identical to what is observed on well-defined Cr(III) silicate [15], and assigned to silanols interacting with a nearby Lewis-acidic chromium center [18].</p>
<p>Contacting the CO-reduced Phillips catalyst with ethylene-d4 gives an IR spectrum that lacks signals at 3,646 and 3,605 cm1, but does contain new OD vibrations at 2,607 and 2,580 cm1 as expected from the harmonic oscillator approximation (2,604 and 2,575 cm1).</p>

The study reveals that upon contact with ethylene, the CO-reduced Phillips catalyst displays specific infrared (IR) bands at 3,646 and 3,605 cm−1, which are attributed to silanols interacting with a nearby Lewis-acidic chromium center. These bands are consistent with the heterolytic activation of ethylene over a CrO bond in the material, forming a chromium-vinyl species capable of inserting ethylene to grow the polymer chain. This mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond in ethylene over a chromium oxide (CrO) bond, leading to the formation of a chromium-vinyl species that can initiate the polymerization process.

研究表明，当与乙烯接触时，CO还原的菲尔斯催化剂显示出特定的红外（IR）波长在3,646和3,605 cm−1，这些波长归因于与附近Lewis酸性铬中心相互作用的硅醇。这些波长与材料中CrO键上乙烯的异裂激活一致，形成能够插入乙烯以增长聚合链的铬-乙烯物种。这一机制涉及乙烯CH键在铬氧化物（CrO）键上的异裂激活，导致形成可以启动聚合过程的铬-乙烯物种。

[1] "In general, polymerization catalysts are activated with reagents to form species containing metal-alkyl groups that are capable of coordinating and inserting ethylene to propagate the polymer."
[2] "The initiation processes (iiv) involve oxidation of Cr(II) to Cr(IV) to generate a Cr-vinyl-hydride by CH activation of ethylene (path i) [16], a Cr-hydride by OH activation of a nearby silanol (path ii) [17, 18], a Cr-alkylidene generated from ethylene (path iii) [1922], or a Cr-metallacyclopentane from oxidative cyclization of two ethylenes (path iv) [23, 24]."
[3] "Here we show that the Phillips catalyst exposed to ethylene displays an IR signature consistent with the formation of Si(μ-OH)Cr and the heterolytic activation of ethylene on a CrO bond (Scheme 1a)."
[4] "Though heterolytic CH activation is common on supported metal species, and is probably a key step in alkane dehydrogenation using Cr(III)/Al2O3 catalysts [31], CH activation on alumina surfaces [3234], hydrogenation reactions involving supported chromium species [35], and in ethylene polymerization on well-defined Cr(III)-silicates [15]."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction process, which involves four main steps. The mechanism explains how hydrogen is removed from hydrocarbons to form alkanes. The ongoing debate within the scientific community focuses on identifying which of these steps is rate-limiting. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the reactions involved and the intricate nature of the catalysts. The presence of Cr(III) sites in the catalysts, as detected by EPR spectroscopy, and the striking similarity of infrared spectral features in the Phillips catalyst that indicate heterolytic CH activation, support the idea that initiation takes place via the CH bond activation of ethylene on a CrO bond. This insight could potentially lead to new methods for manipulating the active site in Cr-silicates to produce polymers with novel architectures and properties.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应的过程，包括四个主要步骤。科学界内部对这些步骤中哪一步是速率限制步骤存在持续的争论。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学领域的一个热点和争议话题，原因在于反应的复杂性和催化剂的精妙性质。通过电子顺磁共振光谱检测到催化剂中的Cr(III)位点以及在菲尔斯催化剂中观察到的红外光谱特征表明，异裂性CH激活可能是乙烯聚合的关键步骤。这可能为操纵Cr-silicate活性位点提供新的途径，以产生具有新型结构和属性的聚合物。

<p>In Phillips catalysts, several proposals for ethylene polymerization initiation from isolated Cr(II) sites are shown in Fig. 1b. The initiation processes (iiv) involve oxidation of Cr(II) to Cr(IV) to generate a Cr-vinyl-hydride by CH activation of ethylene (path i) [16], a Cr-hydride by OH activation of a nearby silanol (path ii) [17, 18], a Cr-alkylidene generated from ethylene (path iii) [1922], or a Cr-metallacyclopentane from oxidative cyclization of two ethylenes (path iv) [23, 24].</p>

This study elucidates the mechanism of ethylene polymerization on CO-reduced Phillips catalysts, showing that the process initiates through the heterolytic activation of the CH bond on ethylene over a CrO bond. This results in the formation of a chromium-vinyl species, which can then insert ethylene to grow the polymer chain, maintaining the Cr oxidation state throughout the reaction. This finding provides insights into the active site and initiation mechanism of Phillips catalysts, potentially offering new opportunities to manipulate the active site for the synthesis of polymers with novel architectures and properties.

[2] "We recently showed that well-defined dimeric Cr(III) species are far more active in ethylene polymerization than the analogous Cr(II) materials."

Answer: The study presented in this literature focuses on the polymerization of ethylene on a CO-reduced Phillips catalyst. It reveals that the activation of ethylene involves a heterolytic CH bond activation over a CrO bond, leading to the formation of a chromium-vinyl species. This mechanism conserves the chromium oxidation state during catalysis. The active site in Phillips catalysts is suggested to be chromium(III), rather than chromium(II), based on the similarities between the infrared signatures observed in these materials and those previously seen on well-defined chromium(III) silicates. This mechanistic insight could offer new opportunities to manipulate the active site in chromium silicates to produce polymers with diverse architectural properties and enhanced characteristics.

该文献讨论的研究主要集中在乙烯在CO还原菲利普催化剂上的聚合。研究表明，乙烯的激活涉及CrO键上的异裂CH键激活，形成一个铬-乙烯物种。这一机制保持了催化过程中的铬氧化状态。研究人员认为菲利普催化剂的活性中心可能是铬(III)，而非铬(II)，基于这些材料中观察到的红外谱线与之前在定义明确的铬(III)硅酸盐上观察到的谱线相似性。这一机制洞察可能为调整铬硅酸盐活性中心提供新机会，以生产具有不同结构特性和增强性能的聚合物。
