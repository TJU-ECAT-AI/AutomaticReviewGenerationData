[1] "In general, polymerization catalysts are activated with reagents to form species containing metal-alkyl groups that are capable of coordinating and inserting ethylene to propagate the polymer."
[2] "The initiation processes (iiv) involve oxidation of Cr(II) to Cr(IV) to generate a Cr-vinyl-hydride by CH activation of ethylene (path i) [16], a Cr-hydride by OH activation of a nearby silanol (path ii) [17, 18], a Cr-alkylidene generated from ethylene (path iii) [1922], or a Cr-metallacyclopentane from oxidative cyclization of two ethylenes (path iv) [23, 24]."
[3] "Here we show that the Phillips catalyst exposed to ethylene displays an IR signature consistent with the formation of Si(μ-OH)Cr and the heterolytic activation of ethylene on a CrO bond (Scheme 1a)."
[4] "Though heterolytic CH activation is common on supported metal species, and is probably a key step in alkane dehydrogenation using Cr(III)/Al2O3 catalysts [31], CH activation on alumina surfaces [3234], hydrogenation reactions involving supported chromium species [35], and in ethylene polymerization on well-defined Cr(III)-silicates [15]."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction process, which involves four main steps. The mechanism explains how hydrogen is removed from hydrocarbons to form alkanes. The ongoing debate within the scientific community focuses on identifying which of these steps is rate-limiting. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the reactions involved and the intricate nature of the catalysts. The presence of Cr(III) sites in the catalysts, as detected by EPR spectroscopy, and the striking similarity of infrared spectral features in the Phillips catalyst that indicate heterolytic CH activation, support the idea that initiation takes place via the CH bond activation of ethylene on a CrO bond. This insight could potentially lead to new methods for manipulating the active site in Cr-silicates to produce polymers with novel architectures and properties.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应的过程，包括四个主要步骤。科学界内部对这些步骤中哪一步是速率限制步骤存在持续的争论。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学领域的一个热点和争议话题，原因在于反应的复杂性和催化剂的精妙性质。通过电子顺磁共振光谱检测到催化剂中的Cr(III)位点以及在菲尔斯催化剂中观察到的红外光谱特征表明，异裂性CH激活可能是乙烯聚合的关键步骤。这可能为操纵Cr-silicate活性位点提供新的途径，以产生具有新型结构和属性的聚合物。
