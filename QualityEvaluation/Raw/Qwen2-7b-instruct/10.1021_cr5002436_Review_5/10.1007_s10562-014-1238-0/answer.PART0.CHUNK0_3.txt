<p>In Phillips catalysts, several proposals for ethylene polymerization initiation from isolated Cr(II) sites are shown in Fig. 1b. The initiation processes (iiv) involve oxidation of Cr(II) to Cr(IV) to generate a Cr-vinyl-hydride by CH activation of ethylene (path i) [16], a Cr-hydride by OH activation of a nearby silanol (path ii) [17, 18], a Cr-alkylidene generated from ethylene (path iii) [1922], or a Cr-metallacyclopentane from oxidative cyclization of two ethylenes (path iv) [23, 24].</p>
<p>Here we show that the Phillips catalyst exposed to ethylene displays an IR signature consistent with the formation of Si(μ-OH)Cr and the heterolytic activation of ethylene on a CrO bond (Scheme 1a).</p>
<p>The IR spectrum of the ethylene contacted CO-reduced Phillips catalyst contains intense υCH and δCH bands at 3,000–2,800 and 1,470 cm−1, respectively, after contacting the material with ethylene that are indicative of PE on the silica surface.</p>
<p>The band at 3,646 cm−1 and 3,605 cm−1 are assigned to silanols interacting with a nearby Lewis-acidic chromium center.</p>
<p>Contacting the CO-reduced Phillips catalyst with ethylene-d4 gives an IR spectrum that lacks signals at 3,646 and 3,605 cm−1, but does contain new OD vibrations at 2,607 and 2,580 cm−1.</p>
<p>This study shows that heterolytic CH activation of ethylene is likely a key step in ethylene polymerization, a mechanism that conserves the Cr-oxidation state during catalysis.</p>

This study elucidates the mechanism of ethylene polymerization on CO-reduced Phillips catalysts, showing that the process initiates through the heterolytic activation of the CH bond on ethylene over a CrO bond. This results in the formation of a chromium-vinyl species, which can then insert ethylene to grow the polymer chain, maintaining the Cr oxidation state throughout the reaction. This finding provides insights into the active site and initiation mechanism of Phillips catalysts, potentially offering new opportunities to manipulate the active site for the synthesis of polymers with novel architectures and properties.

本研究揭示了CO还原菲利普催化剂上乙烯聚合的机制，表明该过程通过乙烯上CrO键的异裂激活开始。这导致形成一个铬-乙烯基物种，然后可以插入乙烯来生长聚合物链，同时保持铬的氧化状态。这一发现为理解菲利普催化剂的活性位点和启动机制提供了见解，并可能为合成具有新型架构和特性的聚合物提供新的机会。
