The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions typically consists of four main steps:

1. Activation of the hydrogen molecule (H2) by the catalyst, leading to the formation of hydrogen atoms (H).

2. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.

3. Formation of a reactive complex by the interaction of the activated hydrogen atoms with the reactant molecule.

4. Release of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often focuses on the efficiency of the hydrogen activation step versus the subsequent steps. Some studies suggest that the hydrogen activation barrier might be high, making this step rate-limiting. Other research indicates that the surface reaction steps, particularly the formation of the reactive complex, could be the rate-determining step.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the catalytic surface interactions, the dynamic nature of the catalytic process, and the influence of various factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties. Understanding the rate-limiting step can guide the development of more efficient catalysts and catalytic processes.

The literature provides insights into the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne on Pt(111). The calculations indicate that the dehydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne is thermodynamically favorable. The formation of propynyl is energetically unfavorable, suggesting that this species may not be involved in the direct reaction of dehydrogenation.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制通常包含四个主要步骤：

1. 催化剂激活氢分子（H2），形成氢原子（H）。

2. 反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附。

3. 通过激活的氢原子与反应物分子的相互作用形成活性复合物。

4. 产物分子从催化剂表面释放。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论往往集中在氢激活步骤的效率与后续步骤之间。一些研究表明，氢激活壁垒可能很高，这使得该步骤成为速率限制步骤。其他研究则表明，表面反应步骤，特别是活性复合物的形成，可能是决定速率的步骤。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这一机制仍然是科学界的兴趣点和争议点，因为催化表面相互作用的复杂性、催化过程的动态性质以及温度、压力和催化剂性质的影响。理解速率限制步骤可以指导更高效催化剂和催化过程的发展。

文献提供了丙烯在Pt(111)表面上脱氢生成丙基炔的热力学信息。计算结果表明，丙烯脱氢生成丙基炔是热力学有利的。丙炔的形成是能量不利的，这表明该物种可能不会直接参与脱氢反应。
