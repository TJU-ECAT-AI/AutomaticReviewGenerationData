[1] "We have investigated the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne on Pt(111) for a 0.25 ML coverage."
[2] "The combination of energy and vibrational frequency calculations allowed us to propose some species as possible intermediates of the decomposition processpropylidene and 1-propenyl."
[3] "Our calculations clearly indicate that the de- hydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne is thermodynamically favourable."
[4] "It is noteworthy that these two intermediates are not the thermodynamically most stable."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a topic of scientific interest and controversy. It involves four main steps: 
1. Hydrogen abstraction from a hydrogenated compound.
2. Formation of a carbocation intermediate.
3. Rearrangement of the carbocation to form an alkene.
4. Elimination of a proton to yield the desired alkene product.

Regarding which step is rate-limiting, the ongoing debate suggests that the abstraction step is often considered the rate-limiting step, followed by the rearrangement step. However, the exact rate-limiting step can vary depending on the specific conditions and compounds involved. 

Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy because the precise details and kinetics of each step can be complex and influenced by many factors, including the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and substrate properties. The exact roles of intermediates and the precise sequence of steps can also differ based on the specific reaction being studied. This complexity contributes to the ongoing research and discussion in the field.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，这是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题。它涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 从氢化化合物中提取氢。
2. 形成一个碳正离子中间体。
3. 碳正离子的重排形成烯烃。
4. 去除一个质子以产生所需的烯烃产物。

关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤的争论表明，抽象步骤通常被认为是速率限制步骤，其次是重排步骤。然而，具体取决于特定条件和化合物的精确细节和动力学，每个步骤都可能不同。几十年的研究后，该机制仍然是一个研究和讨论的话题，因为每个步骤的精确细节可以非常复杂，并受到许多因素的影响，包括催化剂类型、反应条件和底物性质。中间体的确切作用以及步骤的精确顺序也可能基于正在研究的具体反应而有所不同。这种复杂性为该领域提供了持续的研究和讨论。

[1] "The details of this surface process have been subject of intense debate. Several simple mechanisms have been proposed with ethyl (CH3CH· 2), vinyl (CH2CH·), ethylidene (CH3CH·),and/or vinylidene (CH2C·) intermediates."
[2] "The formation of an intermediate during the transformation from propylene to propylidyne seems evident according to the new feature at 2890 cm1 observed in the 256 and 268 K RAIRS spectra."
[3] "Unfortunately, the CH stretching region (28003100 cm1) is not well described with the harmonic model. Moreover, all of the features lie within a small range, and the differences are sufficient to be conclusive. Hence we focused our attention on the deformation region."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The ongoing debate centers on which step is rate-limiting, with some arguing for the activation of the C-H bond, others for the subsequent formation of a reactive intermediate, and yet others for the departure of the hydrogen atom. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the reactions and the difficulty in precisely determining the rates and mechanisms of each step.

[1] "We used the adsorption energies to compute the overall reaction energies for a total of 18 elementary CH bond activation and isomerisation reactions that are likely to be involved in the dehydrogenation of propylene."
[2] "Our calculations clearly indicate that the de- hydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne is thermodynam- ically favourable."
[3] "Unfortunately, the experimental data available for the reaction intermediate is not sufficient to enable an unequivocal identification. Our best guesses are propylidene and 1-propenyl. It is noteworthy that these two intermediates are not the thermody- namically most stable."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Activation of the hydrogen bond.
2. Transfer of hydrogen from the activated bond to the catalyst.
3. Formation of an intermediate compound.
4. Release of the product from the catalyst. 

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting centers on the activation of the hydrogen bond, as it requires high energy input and is therefore a potential bottleneck in the reaction sequence. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reactions involved and the challenges in accurately modeling them computationally. The availability of experimental data and the ability to identify the reaction intermediates are crucial factors that contribute to the ongoing discussions.

[1] "We have investigated the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne on Pt(111) for a 0.25 ML coverage."
[2] "We computed the reaction energies for 18 elementary steps that possibly may be involved in the propylene-to-propylidyne transformation."
[3] "Our calculations clearly indicate that the de- hydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne is thermodynamically favourable."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions typically consists of four main steps:

1. Activation of the hydrogen molecule (H2) by the catalyst, leading to the formation of hydrogen atoms (H).

2. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.

3. Formation of a reactive complex by the interaction of the activated hydrogen atoms with the reactant molecule.

4. Release of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often focuses on the efficiency of the hydrogen activation step versus the subsequent steps. Some studies suggest that the hydrogen activation barrier might be high, making this step rate-limiting. Other research indicates that the surface reaction steps, particularly the formation of the reactive complex, could be the rate-determining step.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the catalytic surface interactions, the dynamic nature of the catalytic process, and the influence of various factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties. Understanding the rate-limiting step can guide the development of more efficient catalysts and catalytic processes.

The literature provides insights into the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne on Pt(111). The calculations indicate that the dehydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne is thermodynamically favorable. The formation of propynyl is energetically unfavorable, suggesting that this species may not be involved in the direct reaction of dehydrogenation.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制通常包含四个主要步骤：

1. 催化剂激活氢分子（H2），形成氢原子（H）。

2. 反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附。

3. 通过激活的氢原子与反应物分子的相互作用形成活性复合物。

4. 产物分子从催化剂表面释放。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论往往集中在氢激活步骤的效率与后续步骤之间。一些研究表明，氢激活壁垒可能很高，这使得该步骤成为速率限制步骤。其他研究则表明，表面反应步骤，特别是活性复合物的形成，可能是决定速率的步骤。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这一机制仍然是科学界的兴趣点和争议点，因为催化表面相互作用的复杂性、催化过程的动态性质以及温度、压力和催化剂性质的影响。理解速率限制步骤可以指导更高效催化剂和催化过程的发展。

文献提供了丙烯在Pt(111)表面上脱氢生成丙基炔的热力学信息。计算结果表明，丙烯脱氢生成丙基炔是热力学有利的。丙炔的形成是能量不利的，这表明该物种可能不会直接参与脱氢反应。
