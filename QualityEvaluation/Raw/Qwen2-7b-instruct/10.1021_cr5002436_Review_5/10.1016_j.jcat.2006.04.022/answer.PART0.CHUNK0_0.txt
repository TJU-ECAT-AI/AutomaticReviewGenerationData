[1] "We have investigated the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne on Pt(111) for a 0.25 ML coverage."
[2] "The combination of energy and vibrational frequency calculations allowed us to propose some species as possible intermediates of the decomposition processpropylidene and 1-propenyl."
[3] "Our calculations clearly indicate that the de- hydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne is thermodynamically favourable."
[4] "It is noteworthy that these two intermediates are not the thermodynamically most stable."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a topic of scientific interest and controversy. It involves four main steps: 
1. Hydrogen abstraction from a hydrogenated compound.
2. Formation of a carbocation intermediate.
3. Rearrangement of the carbocation to form an alkene.
4. Elimination of a proton to yield the desired alkene product.

Regarding which step is rate-limiting, the ongoing debate suggests that the abstraction step is often considered the rate-limiting step, followed by the rearrangement step. However, the exact rate-limiting step can vary depending on the specific conditions and compounds involved. 

Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy because the precise details and kinetics of each step can be complex and influenced by many factors, including the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and substrate properties. The exact roles of intermediates and the precise sequence of steps can also differ based on the specific reaction being studied. This complexity contributes to the ongoing research and discussion in the field.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，这是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题。它涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 从氢化化合物中提取氢。
2. 形成一个碳正离子中间体。
3. 碳正离子的重排形成烯烃。
4. 去除一个质子以产生所需的烯烃产物。

关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤的争论表明，抽象步骤通常被认为是速率限制步骤，其次是重排步骤。然而，具体取决于特定条件和化合物的精确细节和动力学，每个步骤都可能不同。几十年的研究后，该机制仍然是一个研究和讨论的话题，因为每个步骤的精确细节可以非常复杂，并受到许多因素的影响，包括催化剂类型、反应条件和底物性质。中间体的确切作用以及步骤的精确顺序也可能基于正在研究的具体反应而有所不同。这种复杂性为该领域提供了持续的研究和讨论。
