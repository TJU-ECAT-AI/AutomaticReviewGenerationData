[1] "We used the adsorption energies to compute the overall reaction energies for a total of 18 elementary CH bond activation and isomerisation reactions that are likely to be involved in the dehydrogenation of propylene."
[2] "Our calculations clearly indicate that the de- hydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne is thermodynam- ically favourable."
[3] "Unfortunately, the experimental data available for the reaction intermediate is not sufficient to enable an unequivocal identification. Our best guesses are propylidene and 1-propenyl. It is noteworthy that these two intermediates are not the thermody- namically most stable."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Activation of the hydrogen bond.
2. Transfer of hydrogen from the activated bond to the catalyst.
3. Formation of an intermediate compound.
4. Release of the product from the catalyst. 

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting centers on the activation of the hydrogen bond, as it requires high energy input and is therefore a potential bottleneck in the reaction sequence. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reactions involved and the challenges in accurately modeling them computationally. The availability of experimental data and the ability to identify the reaction intermediates are crucial factors that contribute to the ongoing discussions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：
1. 活化氢键。
2. 将氢从活化键转移到催化剂上。
3. 形成中间化合物。
4. 产物从催化剂释放。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性步骤的争论集中在激活氢键这一环节，因为它需要高能量输入，因此可能是反应序列中的潜在瓶颈。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因在于反应的复杂性和通过计算准确建模的挑战。可用的实验数据以及识别中间体的能力是推动持续讨论的关键因素。
