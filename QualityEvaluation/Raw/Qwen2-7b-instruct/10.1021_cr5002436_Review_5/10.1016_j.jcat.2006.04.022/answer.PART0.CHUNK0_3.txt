[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps."
[2] "These steps are: (1) adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the adsorbed molecule, (3) formation of an activated complex, and (4) desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface."
[3] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the catalytic process and the interactions between the reactants, catalyst, and products."
[4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the precise mechanisms and rate-determining steps of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions remain topics of scientific interest and controversy."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four primary stages: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the adsorbed molecule, formation of an activated complex, and desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface. The debate over which step is the rate-limiting factor is ongoing due to the intricate interactions involved in the catalytic process. Despite extensive research spanning nearly a century, the precise mechanisms and rate-determining steps in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions continue to be areas of scientific interest and controversy.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面，吸附分子的活化，形成活化复合物，以及产品分子从催化剂表面脱附。关于哪个步骤是速率限制因素的争论持续存在，这是由于催化过程中的复杂交互作用所致。尽管该领域的研究已持续近一个世纪，但催化脱氢反应的确切机制和速率决定步骤仍然是科学界关注和争议的焦点。
