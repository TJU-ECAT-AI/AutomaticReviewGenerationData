[1] "The details of this surface process have been subject of intense debate. Several simple mechanisms have been proposed with ethyl (CH3CH· 2), vinyl (CH2CH·), ethylidene (CH3CH·),and/or vinylidene (CH2C·) intermediates."
[2] "The formation of an intermediate during the transformation from propylene to propylidyne seems evident according to the new feature at 2890 cm1 observed in the 256 and 268 K RAIRS spectra."
[3] "Unfortunately, the CH stretching region (28003100 cm1) is not well described with the harmonic model. Moreover, all of the features lie within a small range, and the differences are sufficient to be conclusive. Hence we focused our attention on the deformation region."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The ongoing debate centers on which step is rate-limiting, with some arguing for the activation of the C-H bond, others for the subsequent formation of a reactive intermediate, and yet others for the departure of the hydrogen atom. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the reactions and the difficulty in precisely determining the rates and mechanisms of each step.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，涉及四个主要步骤。关于哪一步是决定性的步骤，存在争议，一些人认为是C-H键的活化，另一些人则认为是后续形成活性中间体，还有人认为是氢原子的离开。尽管这一机制已经研究了一个多世纪，但它仍然是科学界关注和争论的焦点，原因在于反应的复杂性和精确确定每一步的速度和机制的困难。
