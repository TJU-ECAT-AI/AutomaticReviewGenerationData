[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."
[2] "It now seems reasonable to suppose that the weakly adsorbed species in equilibration with gaseous molecules plays a significant role during the catalytic reactions, although the issue of which specific species determines the rate of hydrogenation is still debatable."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions posits that the rate-limiting step involves the activation of hydrogen or the hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate. This mechanism was initially proposed to explain the dehydrogenation process over supported metal catalysts. However, it remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the ongoing debate about which specific step is truly rate-limiting. Despite extensive study spanning nearly a century, the exact role of various species involved in the catalytic reactions and their impact on the reaction rate continues to be a subject of discussion within the scientific community.

Horiuti和Polanyi提出的脱氢反应机理指出，决定性步骤可能涉及氢的活化或乙基中间体的氢化。这一机制最初被用来解释在支持金属催化剂上进行的脱氢过程。然而，这仍然是科学界关注的焦点和争议的热点，因为关于哪一步骤真正决定了反应速率的争论仍在继续。尽管这一过程的研究已经持续了一个世纪，但参与催化反应的各种物种的作用及其对反应速率的影响仍然是科学界讨论的话题。

1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions proposes that the activation of hydrogen or the hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate is the rate-limiting step. This mechanism is considered a foundational concept in the field of catalysis.

2. Despite the extensive study of this mechanism over nearly a century, there is ongoing debate about which specific step is rate-limiting. The presence of weakly adsorbed species that are in equilibrium with gaseous molecules is thought to play a significant role in catalytic reactions, but determining which species ultimately controls the reaction rate remains a topic of scientific discussion.

3. The hydrogenation rate over a Pt(111) surface does not depend on the coverage of any ethylene species. This finding challenges the traditional understanding of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and suggests that other factors might be influencing the reaction rate.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 原由Horiuti和Polanyi提出的脱氢反应机理认为，氢的活化或乙基中间体的氢化是决定性步骤。这一机制在催化领域被认为是基础概念。

2. 尽管这一机制自近一个世纪以来被广泛研究，但关于哪一步骤是决定性的仍然存在争议。被认为在催化反应中起重要作用的是吸附较弱、与气体分子平衡的物种，但确定哪些物种最终控制反应速率仍然是科学讨论的主题。

3. 在Pt(111)表面进行的氢化反应速率并不依赖于任何乙烯物种的覆盖度。这一发现挑战了传统的Horiuti-Polanyi机理解释，并暗示可能有其他因素影响反应速率。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions posits that the rate-limiting step involves the activation of hydrogen or the hydrogenation of an ethyl intermediate. This mechanism is based on the idea that the ethyl intermediate is in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene. However, the nature of the adsorbed ethylene and the role of specific species in determining the reaction rate remain topics of scientific debate.

In the present study, in-situ infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) was employed to observe surface species on a Pt(111) surface during the hydrogenation of ethylene at pressures of 1.3 × 102 Pa for ethylene and 6.5 × 103 Pa for hydrogen. The researchers found that ethane formation occurred, confirming steady-state hydrogenation. They noted that while the weakly adsorbed species plays a significant role in catalytic reactions, the specific species responsible for determining the reaction rate is still uncertain.

The discrepancy in detecting π-bonded ethylene by sum-frequency generation (SFG) versus IRAS under similar conditions is likely due to the observation of different species. The π-bonded ethylene is characterized by a specific out-of-plane bending mode, while the ethylene molecule with a complete CC double bond and molecular plane parallel to the surface is detected by IRAS. This difference in observed species explains the disparity in detection methods.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to be of scientific interest and controversy because the precise role of various intermediates and the rate-determining step in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions are not fully understood. The ongoing debate and exploration of these mechanisms contribute to our broader knowledge of heterogeneous catalysis.

霍里图和波拉尼提出的脱氢反应机制认为，速率决定步骤涉及氢的激活或乙基中间体的氢化。这一机制基于乙基中间体与吸附乙烯处于平衡状态的假设。然而，吸附乙烯的性质以及特定物种在确定反应速率中的作用仍然是科学争论的焦点。

本研究中，通过原位红外反射吸收光谱法（IRAS）观察了在1.3 × 102帕斯卡的乙烯压力和6.5 × 103帕斯卡的氢气压力下Pt(111)表面的表面物种在乙烯氢化过程中的行为。研究人员发现，乙烷形成，证实了稳态氢化。他们指出，在催化反应中，弱吸附物种起着重要作用，但确定反应速率的具体物种仍然不确定。

在类似条件下，通过SFG检测到π-键乙烯，而IRAS未检测到，这可能是因为观察到了不同物种。π-键乙烯具有特定的平面外弯曲模式，而具有完全CC双键和平行于表面的分子平面的乙烯分子则由IRAS检测。这种在检测方法中观察到的不同物种解释了差异性。

霍里图和波拉尼机制之所以持续引起科学兴趣和争议，是因为在催化脱氢反应中各种中间体的作用及其速率决定步骤尚未完全了解。这些持续的辩论和对这些机制的研究有助于我们更全面地了解异相催化。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions proposes that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate is the rate-limiting step. This mechanism assumes that the ethyl intermediate is in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene, a focus that has received considerable attention. However, the identity of the specific species that determines the reaction rate remains a subject of debate, suggesting that the weakly adsorbed species in equilibrium with gas-phase molecules might play a significant role in catalytic reactions. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism continues to be a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to ongoing uncertainty about the rate-limiting step.
