[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."
[2] "It now seems reasonable to suppose that the weakly adsorbed species in equilibration with gaseous molecules plays a significant role during the catalytic reactions, although the issue of which specific species determines the rate of hydrogenation is still debatable."
[3] "The rate of hydrogenation over Pt(111) is not related to the coverage of any ethylene species on the mechanism."

1. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions proposes that the activation of hydrogen or the hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate is the rate-limiting step. This mechanism is considered a foundational concept in the field of catalysis.

2. Despite the extensive study of this mechanism over nearly a century, there is ongoing debate about which specific step is rate-limiting. The presence of weakly adsorbed species that are in equilibrium with gaseous molecules is thought to play a significant role in catalytic reactions, but determining which species ultimately controls the reaction rate remains a topic of scientific discussion.

3. The hydrogenation rate over a Pt(111) surface does not depend on the coverage of any ethylene species. This finding challenges the traditional understanding of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and suggests that other factors might be influencing the reaction rate.

1. 原由Horiuti和Polanyi提出的脱氢反应机理认为，氢的活化或乙基中间体的氢化是决定性步骤。这一机制在催化领域被认为是基础概念。

2. 尽管这一机制自近一个世纪以来被广泛研究，但关于哪一步骤是决定性的仍然存在争议。被认为在催化反应中起重要作用的是吸附较弱、与气体分子平衡的物种，但确定哪些物种最终控制反应速率仍然是科学讨论的主题。

3. 在Pt(111)表面进行的氢化反应速率并不依赖于任何乙烯物种的覆盖度。这一发现挑战了传统的Horiuti-Polanyi机理解释，并暗示可能有其他因素影响反应速率。
