[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."
[2] "It now seems reasonable to suppose that the weakly adsorbed species in equilibration with gaseous molecules plays a significant role during the catalytic reactions, although the issue of which specific species determines the rate of hydrogenation is still debatable."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions posits that the rate-limiting step involves the activation of hydrogen or the hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate. This mechanism was initially proposed to explain the dehydrogenation process over supported metal catalysts. However, it remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the ongoing debate about which specific step is truly rate-limiting. Despite extensive study spanning nearly a century, the exact role of various species involved in the catalytic reactions and their impact on the reaction rate continues to be a subject of discussion within the scientific community.

Horiuti和Polanyi提出的脱氢反应机理指出，决定性步骤可能涉及氢的活化或乙基中间体的氢化。这一机制最初被用来解释在支持金属催化剂上进行的脱氢过程。然而，这仍然是科学界关注的焦点和争议的热点，因为关于哪一步骤真正决定了反应速率的争论仍在继续。尽管这一过程的研究已经持续了一个世纪，但参与催化反应的各种物种的作用及其对反应速率的影响仍然是科学界讨论的话题。
