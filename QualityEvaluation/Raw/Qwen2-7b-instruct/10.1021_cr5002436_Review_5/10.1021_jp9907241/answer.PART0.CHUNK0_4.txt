[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."
[2] "An ethyl intermediate is considered to be in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene,3 and great attention has been given to the nature of adsorbed ethylene."
[3] "It now seems reasonable to suppose that the weakly adsorbed species in equilibration with gaseous molecules plays a significant role during the catalytic reactions, although the issue of which specific species determines the rate of hydrogenation is still debatable."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions proposes that the activation of hydrogen and/or the hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate is the rate-limiting step. Ethyl is assumed to be in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene. There is ongoing debate about which specific step determines the reaction rate. The weakly adsorbed species, in balance with gaseous molecules, is believed to play a significant role in catalytic reactions, but the exact determining factor remains uncertain.

Horiuti和Polanyi提出的催化脱氢反应机制认为，氢的活化或乙基中间体的氢化是决定性步骤。乙基被认为与吸附的乙烯处于平衡状态。关于哪个具体步骤决定了反应速率的问题仍在争论中。吸附较弱的物种，在与气体分子平衡时，被认为在催化反应中扮演着重要角色，但确定这一因素的确切作用仍存在疑问。
