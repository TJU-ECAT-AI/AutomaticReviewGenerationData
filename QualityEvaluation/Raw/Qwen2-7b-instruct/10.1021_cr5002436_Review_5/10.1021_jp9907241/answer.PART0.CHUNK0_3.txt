[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."
[2] "An ethyl intermediate is considered to be in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene,3 and great attention has been given to the nature of adsorbed ethylene."
[3] "It now seems reasonable to suppose that the weakly adsorbed species in equilibration with gaseous molecules plays a significant role during the catalytic reactions, although the issue of which specific species determines the rate of hydrogenation is still debatable."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions proposes that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate is the rate-limiting step. This mechanism assumes that the ethyl intermediate is in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene, a focus that has received considerable attention. However, the identity of the specific species that determines the reaction rate remains a subject of debate, suggesting that the weakly adsorbed species in equilibrium with gas-phase molecules might play a significant role in catalytic reactions. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism continues to be a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to ongoing uncertainty about the rate-limiting step.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horiuti和Polanyi提出的机制认为氢化氢或乙基中间体的活化是决定性步骤。该机制假设乙基中间体与吸附的乙烯处于平衡状态，这一直是研究的重点。然而，决定反应速率的具体物种仍存在争议，暗示弱吸附的物种在与气相分子平衡时可能发挥重要作用。尽管已经研究了一个世纪之久，由于关于决定性步骤的持续不确定性，这一机制仍然是科学界关注的热点和争议话题。
