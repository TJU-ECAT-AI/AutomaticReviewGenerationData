[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane is important because of growing demand for isobutene as a precursor for the production of oxygenates required in reformulated gasoline."
[2] "Recently, it was shown that supporting tin and platinum in the potassium form of L-zeolite produces a unique material that exhibits high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Fundamental investigations of silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts show that tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles, which reduces the size of surface Pt ensembles and inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species required for the competing isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coking reactions."
[4] "Similarly, the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 increases the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation by further reducing the size of surface Pt ensembles."
[5] "The properties of this highly selective dehydrogenation catalyst may be attributed to the stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the L-zeolite pore in the presence of potassium."
[6] "Results from deactivation studies show that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit tolerance to deposited carbon, and the predominate modes of deactivation are enrichment of the Pt/Sn alloy particle surface with tin and/or sintering of the metal particles under reducing conditions and high temperatures."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of isobutane onto the surface of the catalyst. The second step involves the conversion of isobutane to isobutene by the removal of two hydrogen atoms. The third step entails the rearrangement of the isobutene molecule into a more stable configuration. The final step is the desorption of the newly formed isobutene molecule from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around which of these steps is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the adsorption of isobutane is the rate-determining step due to the high energy barrier involved. Others propose that the desorption of isobutene could be rate-limiting because of the difficulty in achieving sufficient surface coverage for efficient reaction. Despite a century of study, the precise nature of the rate-limiting step remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy, with various factors influencing the overall reaction rate. This mechanism is of continued interest due to its implications for improving catalyst design and efficiency in industrial processes.

The addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 catalysts suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, enhancing the dehydrogenation selectivity. This is because tin interacts with platinum to form a Pt/Sn alloy, which reduces the size of the surface platinum ensembles and inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species required for competing reactions. The addition of potassium further reduces the size of the surface platinum ensembles, thereby suppressing isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, and enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation due to the stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the zeolite pore in the presence of potassium. The catalysts' properties are attributed to their ability to resist deposited carbon and undergo deactivation primarily through the enrichment of the Pt/Sn alloy particle surface with tin or sintering of the metal particles under reducing conditions and high temperatures.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤。第一步涉及异丁烷在催化剂表面的离解吸附。第二步涉及通过移除两个氢原子将异丁烷转化为异丁烯。第三步是异丁烯分子的重新排列，形成更稳定的结构。最后一步是从催化剂表面脱附新形成的异丁烯分子。科学界关于哪一步是决定性步骤的争论仍在继续。一些研究人员认为吸附异丁烷是决定性步骤，因为涉及到较高的能量壁垒。其他人则认为脱附异丁烯可能是决定性步骤，因为需要足够的表面覆盖以实现高效的反应。尽管已经进行了一个世纪的研究，但决定性步骤的确切性质仍然是科学界的兴趣和争议的话题，各种因素影响着整体反应速率。这个机制对于改进催化剂设计和工业过程的效率具有重要意义。

向Pt/SiO2催化剂中添加锡可以抑制氢化和异构化反应，增强脱氢选择性。这是因为锡与铂结合形成Pt/Sn合金，从而减小表面铂簇的尺寸并抑制需要进行竞争反应的高脱氢表面物种的形成。向Pt/Sn/SiO2中添加钾进一步减小了表面铂簇的尺寸，从而抑制了异构化和氢化反应，并增强了脱氢选择性。Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂由于在钾的存在下能够稳定小的Pt/Sn颗粒而在沸石孔中表现出高活性、选择性和抗失活能力。催化剂的特性归因于它们抵抗沉积碳的能力以及在还原条件和高温下的主要失活方式是Pt/Sn合金颗粒表面富集锡或金属颗粒的烧结。
