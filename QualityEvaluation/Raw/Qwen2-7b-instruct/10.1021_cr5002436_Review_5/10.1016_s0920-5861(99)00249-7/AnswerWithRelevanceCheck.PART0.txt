          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: dissociative adsorption of isobutane, conversion of the adsorbed isobutane into a pair of isobutenes, desorption of the isobutenes, and release of hydrogen. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting focuses on the adsorption of isobutane and the subsequent transformation steps. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the precise rate-determining step remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. This mechanism is of continued interest due to its relevance in understanding the dynamics of dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the context of isobutane-to-isobutene conversion. It helps researchers understand how modifying catalyst components, such as tin and potassium, can influence reaction pathways and enhance selectivity.

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is of ongoing scientific interest due to its application in catalytic conversion processes. By studying the rates and mechanisms of dehydrogenation, scientists can optimize catalyst design for industrial applications, such as producing oxygenates for reformulated gasoline. The mechanism explains how the addition of tin to platinum catalysts can suppress hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, thereby improving dehydrogenation selectivity. Additionally, the inclusion of potassium further reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles, suppressing isomerization and hydrogenolysis, and enhancing catalyst stability. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts, characterized by their high dehydrogenation activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation, exemplify the practical application of this mechanism in achieving efficient and stable catalytic conversion processes. The stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the zeolite pore structure, facilitated by potassium, plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst performance under reaction conditions conducive to dehydrogenation.

          脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：异丁烷的离解吸附、吸附的异丁烷转化为一对异丁烯、异丁烯的脱附以及氢的释放。关于哪个步骤是决定性的步骤的争论集中在异丁烷的吸附及其后续转化步骤上。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但决定性的步骤的确切性质仍然是科学界的兴趣和争议的话题。这一机制在理解脱氢化反应动力学方面具有持续的科学兴趣，尤其是在异丁烷转化为异丁烯的背景下。它帮助研究人员理解如何通过修改催化剂成分（如锡和钾）来影响反应路径并提高选择性。

          脱氢化反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制在催化转换过程中具有持续的科学兴趣。通过研究脱氢化过程的速率和机制，科学家可以优化催化剂设计以应用于工业应用，例如生产用于改性汽油的氧源。该机制解释了将锡添加到铂催化剂中如何抑制氢解和异构化反应，从而提高脱氢选择性。此外，钾的加入进一步减小了表面铂团簇的尺寸，抑制了异构化和氢解反应，提高了催化剂稳定性。Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂以其高脱氢活性、高选择性和对失活的抵抗性而著称，体现了这一机制在实现高效稳定催化转换过程中的实际应用。在有利于脱氢的条件下，钾在沸石孔结构中稳定小的Pt/Sn颗粒，对于维持催化剂性能至关重要。

          The results from our kinetics studies demonstrate that adding tin to Pt/SiO2 catalysts suppresses the isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions of isobutane, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity. Mssbauer spectroscopy reveals that Pt and Sn form alloy clusters in L-zeolite, with the majority of Sn being present as Sn2+. Adding tin to silica-supported platinum reduces the initial heat of ethylene adsorption. Similar to the silica-supported system, the hydrogenolysis and isomerization reaction rates decrease with increasing tin content in the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts, and the conversion of isobutane is limited by the equilibrium conversion of isobutane to isobutene. These findings suggest that tin reduces the size of surface Pt ensembles on Pt/Sn alloy particles, inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, and enhancing the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. Furthermore, adding potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalysts increases the isobutane dehydrogenation rate, improves dehydrogenation selectivity, and boosts the catalyst's resistance to deactivation. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts are characterized by high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydrogenation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst deactivation. The stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the L-zeolite pore structure, facilitated by potassium, is believed to contribute to the catalyst's properties.

          我们的研究结果显示，向Pt/SiO2催化剂中添加锡可以抑制异丁烷的异构化和氢解反应，从而提高脱氢选择性。Mssbauer光谱显示，在L-沸石中，Pt和Sn形成了合金簇，其中大多数Sn以Sn2+形式存在。向二氧化硅支持的铂中添加锡可以降低乙烯吸附的初始热。与二氧化硅支持的系统相似，随着Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂中锡含量的增加，氢解和异构化反应速率下降，并且异丁烷的转化受限于异丁烷向异丁烯的平衡转化。这些发现表明，锡减少了Pt/Sn合金粒子表面的铂团簇大小，抑制了异构化和氢解反应，并提高了异丁烷脱氢转化为异丁烯的选择性。此外，向Pt/Sn/SiO2催化剂中添加钾可以提高异丁烷脱氢速率，增强脱氢选择性，并提高催化剂的抗失活性能。Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂以其高脱氢活性、高脱氢选择性和对催化剂失活的高抵抗力而著称。在钾的促进下，L-沸石孔结构中小的Pt/Sn颗粒的稳定被认为促进了催化剂的特性。
