[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane is important because of growing demand for isobutene as a precursor for the production of oxygenates required in reformulated gasoline."
[2] "Recently, it was shown that supporting tin and platinum in the potassium form of L-zeolite produces a unique material that exhibits high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Fundamental investigations of silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts show that tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles, which reduces the size of surface Pt ensembles and inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species required for the competing isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coking reactions."
[4] "Similarly, the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 increases the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation by further reducing the size of surface Pt ensembles."
[5] "The properties of this highly selective dehydrogenation catalyst may be attributed to the stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the L-zeolite pore in the presence of potassium."
[6] "Results from deactivation studies show that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit tolerance to deposited carbon, and the predominate modes of deactivation are enrichment of the Pt/Sn alloy particle surface with tin and/or sintering of the metal particles under reducing conditions and high temperatures."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of isobutane onto the surface of the catalyst. The second step involves the conversion of isobutane to isobutene by the removal of two hydrogen atoms. The third step entails the rearrangement of the isobutene molecule into a more stable configuration. The final step is the desorption of the newly formed isobutene molecule from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around which of these steps is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the adsorption of isobutane is the rate-determining step due to the high energy barrier involved. Others propose that the desorption of isobutene could be rate-limiting because of the difficulty in achieving sufficient surface coverage for efficient reaction. Despite a century of study, the precise nature of the rate-limiting step remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy, with various factors influencing the overall reaction rate. This mechanism is of continued interest due to its implications for improving catalyst design and efficiency in industrial processes.

The addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 catalysts suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, enhancing the dehydrogenation selectivity. This is because tin interacts with platinum to form a Pt/Sn alloy, which reduces the size of the surface platinum ensembles and inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species required for competing reactions. The addition of potassium further reduces the size of the surface platinum ensembles, thereby suppressing isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, and enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation due to the stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the zeolite pore in the presence of potassium. The catalysts' properties are attributed to their ability to resist deposited carbon and undergo deactivation primarily through the enrichment of the Pt/Sn alloy particle surface with tin or sintering of the metal particles under reducing conditions and high temperatures.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤。第一步涉及异丁烷在催化剂表面的离解吸附。第二步涉及通过移除两个氢原子将异丁烷转化为异丁烯。第三步是异丁烯分子的重新排列，形成更稳定的结构。最后一步是从催化剂表面脱附新形成的异丁烯分子。科学界关于哪一步是决定性步骤的争论仍在继续。一些研究人员认为吸附异丁烷是决定性步骤，因为涉及到较高的能量壁垒。其他人则认为脱附异丁烯可能是决定性步骤，因为需要足够的表面覆盖以实现高效的反应。尽管已经进行了一个世纪的研究，但决定性步骤的确切性质仍然是科学界的兴趣和争议的话题，各种因素影响着整体反应速率。这个机制对于改进催化剂设计和工业过程的效率具有重要意义。

向Pt/SiO2催化剂中添加锡可以抑制氢化和异构化反应，增强脱氢选择性。这是因为锡与铂结合形成Pt/Sn合金，从而减小表面铂簇的尺寸并抑制需要进行竞争反应的高脱氢表面物种的形成。向Pt/Sn/SiO2中添加钾进一步减小了表面铂簇的尺寸，从而抑制了异构化和氢化反应，并增强了脱氢选择性。Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂由于在钾的存在下能够稳定小的Pt/Sn颗粒而在沸石孔中表现出高活性、选择性和抗失活能力。催化剂的特性归因于它们抵抗沉积碳的能力以及在还原条件和高温下的主要失活方式是Pt/Sn合金颗粒表面富集锡或金属颗粒的烧结。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is described in the document as having four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of isobutane. The second step is the conversion of the adsorbed isobutane into a pair of isobutenes. The third step is the desorption of the isobutenes. The fourth step is the release of hydrogen gas. The controversy regarding which step is rate-limiting continues due to the complex nature of the reactions involved and the dynamic interplay between the various steps. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the precise rate-determining step remains a topic of scientific interest and debate.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the dissociative adsorption of isobutane. The second and third steps are quasi-equilibrated reactions that transform isobutane intermediates into isobutene. The final step is the desorption of hydrogen and isobutene products. The debate regarding which step is rate-limiting centers on the adsorption of isobutane and the subsequent transformation steps. Some studies suggest that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slowest step, implying that the formation of the activation complex for this step is rate-determining. However, other research indicates that the equilibrium constants for the transformation steps might be more influential. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its relevance in understanding the dynamics of dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the context of isobutane-to-isobutene conversion. This mechanism helps researchers understand how modifying catalyst components, such as tin and potassium, can influence reaction pathways and enhance selectivity.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is of continued scientific interest because it provides insights into the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons. By understanding the rates and mechanisms of dehydrogenation, scientists can optimize catalyst design for industrial applications, such as producing oxygenates for reformulated gasoline. The mechanism explains how the addition of tin to platinum catalysts can suppress isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, thereby enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. Additionally, the inclusion of potassium further reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles, suppressing isomerization and hydrogenolysis, and improving catalyst stability. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts, characterized by their high dehydrogenation activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation, offer a practical example of the application of this mechanism in achieving efficient and stable catalytic conversion processes. The stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the zeolite pore structure, facilitated by potassium, plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst performance under reaction conditions conducive to dehydrogenation.

脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤。第一步是异丁烷的离解吸附。第二和第三步是接近平衡的反应，将异丁烷中间体转化为异丁烯。最后一步是氢和异丁烯产品的脱附。关于哪个步骤是速率决定性的争论集中在异丁烷的吸附及其后续转化步骤上。一些研究表明，异丁烷的离解吸附是最慢的步骤，暗示形成该步骤的激活复合物是速率决定性的。然而，其他研究指出，转化步骤的平衡常数可能更有影响力。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界的热点话题，因为它有助于理解脱氢反应的动力学，特别是在异丁烷转化为异丁烯的背景下。这一机制为研究人员提供了一个理解如何通过修改催化剂成分（如锡和钾）来影响反应路径并增强选择性的视角。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制在科学界持续受到关注，因为它为了解催化转化提供了洞察。通过理解脱氢化反应的速率和机制，科学家可以优化催化剂设计以应用于工业应用，例如生产用于改性汽油的氧源。该机制解释了将锡添加到铂催化剂中如何抑制异构化和氢解反应，从而提高脱氢选择性。此外，钾的加入进一步减小了表面铂团簇的尺寸，抑制了异构化和氢解反应，并提高了催化剂稳定性。Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂以其高脱氢活性、高选择性和对失活的抵抗性而闻名，为这一机制在实现高效稳定催化转化过程中的应用提供了实际示例。在有利于脱氢的条件下，钾在沸石孔结构中稳定小的Pt/Sn颗粒，对于维持催化剂性能至关重要。

Catalysts are named according to the atomic ratios of Pt, Sn and K (i.e. a 1 : 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 catalyst has atomic ratios of Pt : Sn : K of 1 : 1 : 2.5 and a 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/L catalyst has an atomic ratio of Pt : Sn of 1 : 2.5). All of the catalysts used in these studies had between 0.5 and 2.5 wt.% Pt.

The addition of Sn to Pt/SiO2 suppresses the hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, and the turnover frequencies for the production of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane decrease with increasing tin content (e.g., the propane production turnover frequency decreases from 0.026 to 0.00045 s−1 as the Pt/Sn ratio changes from 1 : 0 to 1 : 3). 

It can be seen in Table 1 that a Pt/L-zeolite catalyst exhibits significantly higher activity for isobutane conversion compared to the Pt/SiO2 catalyst. Specifically, the Pt/L-zeolite catalyst exhibits turnover frequencies for conversion of isobutane and for production of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane that are an order of magnitude higher than the Pt/SiO2 catalyst.

The addition of tin to L-zeolite-supported platinum significantly lowers turnover frequencies for the conversion of isobutane and for production of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1 shows that the addition of potassium to 1 : 1 Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst further decreases the rates for production of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane.

The hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics studies show that the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 nearly doubles the dehydrogenation rate, and the dehydrogenation rates are more than an order of magnitude higher over Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite compared to Pt/Sn/SiO2 or Pt/Sn/K/SiO2.

The combined results of these studies suggest that tin reduces the size of the surface Pt ensembles on Pt/Sn alloy particles, suppresses the isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, and enhances the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene.

It has been shown that the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 increases the isobutane dehydrogenation rate, enhances the dehydrogenation selectivity, and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions includes four main steps: dissociative adsorption of isobutane, subsequent isobutane reactions, hydrogenation of the resulting species, and release of hydrogen. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is influenced by factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the specific reaction conditions, and the chemical properties of the reactants.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to its relevance in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes for the production of valuable chemicals and fuels. Understanding the rate-determining step is crucial for developing more efficient and selective catalysts, which can lead to improvements in energy efficiency and environmental impact in industries such as petrochemicals and refining.

[1] "The combined results from hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can be explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below [11,13]:"
[2] "Based on the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process [13]."
[3] "Therefore, we may assume that Steps 2, 3, and 4 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study,leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions:rDH = k1θ2 Pi-C4H10 Pi-C4H8PH2 Keq (1)"
[4] "The equilibrium constants may be described in terms of standard entropy changes (1S3 and 1S4) and enthalpy changes (1H3 and 1H4) for the adsorption of isobutene and hydrogen."
[5] "Furthermore, results from analyses of the kinetic data show that the free energy change to form the activation complex for Step 1 at 723 K decreases in the following order: Pt/Sn/SiO2 > Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 > Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite (167 kJ/mol) (160 kJ/mol) (136 kJ/mol)"
[6] "There-fore, the higher reactions rates over Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 may be attributed to stabilization of the transition-state for the dissociative adsorption of isobutane by the presence of potassium as well as by the zeolite micropores [9,13]."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism explains catalytic dehydrogenation reactions through four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of isobutane, which is identified as the rate-limiting step based on deuterium tracing results. The second and third steps represent the conversion of the adsorbed isobutane to isobutene, while the fourth step involves the release of hydrogen. The equilibrium constants for these reactions can be described in terms of standard entropy and enthalpy changes for the adsorption of isobutene and hydrogen. Analysis of kinetic data suggests that the free energy change to form the activation complex for the first step decreases with the addition of potassium and zeolite micropores, leading to stabilization of the transition state for the dissociative adsorption of isobutane. This stabilization contributes to higher reaction rates over Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 catalysts compared to Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalysts.
