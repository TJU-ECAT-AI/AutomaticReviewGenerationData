[1] "The combined results from hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can be explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below [11,13]:"
[2] "Based on the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process [13]."
[3] "Therefore, we may assume that Steps 2, 3, and 4 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study,leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions:rDH = k1θ2 Pi-C4H10 Pi-C4H8PH2 Keq (1)"
[4] "The equilibrium constants may be described in terms of standard entropy changes (1S3 and 1S4) and enthalpy changes (1H3 and 1H4) for the adsorption of isobutene and hydrogen."
[5] "Furthermore, results from analyses of the kinetic data show that the free energy change to form the activation complex for Step 1 at 723 K decreases in the following order: Pt/Sn/SiO2 > Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 > Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite (167 kJ/mol) (160 kJ/mol) (136 kJ/mol)"
[6] "There-fore, the higher reactions rates over Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 may be attributed to stabilization of the transition-state for the dissociative adsorption of isobutane by the presence of potassium as well as by the zeolite micropores [9,13]."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism explains catalytic dehydrogenation reactions through four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of isobutane, which is identified as the rate-limiting step based on deuterium tracing results. The second and third steps represent the conversion of the adsorbed isobutane to isobutene, while the fourth step involves the release of hydrogen. The equilibrium constants for these reactions can be described in terms of standard entropy and enthalpy changes for the adsorption of isobutene and hydrogen. Analysis of kinetic data suggests that the free energy change to form the activation complex for the first step decreases with the addition of potassium and zeolite micropores, leading to stabilization of the transition state for the dissociative adsorption of isobutane. This stabilization contributes to higher reaction rates over Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 catalysts compared to Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalysts.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制通过四个主要步骤解释催化脱氢反应。第一步涉及异丁烷的离解吸附，根据同位素追踪结果，这是确定速率限制的步骤。第二和第三步代表吸附异丁烷向异丁烯的转化，而第四步涉及氢的释放。这些反应的平衡常数可以用异丁烯和氢吸附的标准熵和焓变来描述。对动力学数据的分析表明，形成第一步骤活性复合物的自由能变化随着钾的添加和沸石微孔的出现而减少，导致异丁烷离解吸附的过渡态稳定化。这稳定性导致Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite和Pt/Sn/K/SiO2催化剂相对于Pt/Sn/SiO2催化剂具有更高的反应速率。
