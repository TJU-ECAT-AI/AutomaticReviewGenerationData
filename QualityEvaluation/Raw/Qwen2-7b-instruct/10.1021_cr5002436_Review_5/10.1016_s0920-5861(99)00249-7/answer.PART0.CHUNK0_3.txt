Catalysts are named according to the atomic ratios of Pt, Sn and K (i.e. a 1 : 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 catalyst has atomic ratios of Pt : Sn : K of 1 : 1 : 2.5 and a 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/L catalyst has an atomic ratio of Pt : Sn of 1 : 2.5). All of the catalysts used in these studies had between 0.5 and 2.5 wt.% Pt.

The addition of Sn to Pt/SiO2 suppresses the hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, and the turnover frequencies for the production of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane decrease with increasing tin content (e.g., the propane production turnover frequency decreases from 0.026 to 0.00045 s−1 as the Pt/Sn ratio changes from 1 : 0 to 1 : 3). 

It can be seen in Table 1 that a Pt/L-zeolite catalyst exhibits significantly higher activity for isobutane conversion compared to the Pt/SiO2 catalyst. Specifically, the Pt/L-zeolite catalyst exhibits turnover frequencies for conversion of isobutane and for production of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane that are an order of magnitude higher than the Pt/SiO2 catalyst.

The addition of tin to L-zeolite-supported platinum significantly lowers turnover frequencies for the conversion of isobutane and for production of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1 shows that the addition of potassium to 1 : 1 Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst further decreases the rates for production of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane.

The hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics studies show that the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 nearly doubles the dehydrogenation rate, and the dehydrogenation rates are more than an order of magnitude higher over Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite compared to Pt/Sn/SiO2 or Pt/Sn/K/SiO2.

The combined results of these studies suggest that tin reduces the size of the surface Pt ensembles on Pt/Sn alloy particles, suppresses the isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, and enhances the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene.

It has been shown that the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 increases the isobutane dehydrogenation rate, enhances the dehydrogenation selectivity, and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions includes four main steps: dissociative adsorption of isobutane, subsequent isobutane reactions, hydrogenation of the resulting species, and release of hydrogen. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is influenced by factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the specific reaction conditions, and the chemical properties of the reactants.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to its relevance in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes for the production of valuable chemicals and fuels. Understanding the rate-determining step is crucial for developing more efficient and selective catalysts, which can lead to improvements in energy efficiency and environmental impact in industries such as petrochemicals and refining.

1. 催化剂的原子比按照Pt、Sn和K的比例命名（例如，1 : 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K/SiO2催化剂的原子比为Pt：Sn：K为1：1：2.5，而1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/L催化剂的Pt：Sn比例为1：2.5）。研究中使用的催化剂的铂含量在0.5至2.5 wt.%之间。
