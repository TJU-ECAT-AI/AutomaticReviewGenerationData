[1] "Results from previous reaction kinetics studies of isobutane conversion showed that hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions are suppressed over small platinum particles."
[2] "It is generally accepted that hy- drogenolysis requires the alkane molecule to undergo successive dehydrogenation processes prior to the rate-limiting CC bond breaking step."
[3] "In addition, the bond-shift mechanism for metal-catalyzed isomerization requires that the alkane molecule un- dergo successive dehydrogenation processes before the rate-limiting bond-shift step."
[4] "For example, Anderson and Avery [34] suggested a bond-shift mechanism involving a aag-tri-adsorbed intermediate bonded to two adjacent metal atoms."
[5] "In short, hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions require surface ensem- bles containing at least several Pt atoms, and these reactions are inhibited over small metal particles that lack these surface ensembles."
[6] "Analogous to the hydrogenolysis reaction, a fairly large ensemble of surface Pt atoms is required for reactions leading to coke formation."
[7] "In contrast, kinetic results suggest that dehydrogenation reactions can proceed on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms."
[8] "The results of our kinetics studies show that the addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 suppresses the isomeriza- tion and hydrogenolysis of isobutane, and enhances the dehydrogenation selectivity."
[9] "Mssbauer spectro- scopic results show that tin interacts with supported platinum to produce a Pt/Sn alloy."
[10] "Microcalorimetric results show that the addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 inhibits ethylidyne formation from the adsorption of ethylene."
[11] "The combined results of these studies suggest that tin reduces the size of the surface Pt ensembles on Pt/Sn alloy particles, suppresses the isomerization and hy- drogenolysis reactions, and enhances the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."
[12] "Furthermore, it has been shown that the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 increases the isobutane dehydrogenation rate, enhances the dehydrogenation selectivity, and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation."
[13] "It has been shown that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydrogenation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst deactivation."
[14] "The properties of this highly selective dehydrogenation catalyst may be attributed to the stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the L-zeolite pore in the presence of potassium."
[15] "Results from deactivation studies show that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit tolerance to deposited carbon, and the predominate modes of deactivation are enrich- ment of the Pt/Sn alloy particle surface with tin and/or sintering of the metal particles under reduc- ing conditions and high temperatures."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is described in the document as having four main steps. The first step involves the dissociative adsorption of isobutane. The second step is the conversion of the adsorbed isobutane into a pair of isobutenes. The third step is the desorption of the isobutenes. The fourth step is the release of hydrogen gas. The controversy regarding which step is rate-limiting continues due to the complex nature of the reactions involved and the dynamic interplay between the various steps. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the precise rate-determining step remains a topic of scientific interest and debate.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述了催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤。第一步涉及异丁烷的离解吸附。第二步是将吸附的异丁烷转化为一对异丁烯。第三步是异丁烯的脱附。第四步是释放氢气。关于哪一步是决定性的步骤的争议持续存在，这是由于所涉及反应的复杂性以及各个步骤之间的动态相互作用。尽管近一个世纪的研究，精确的速率决定步骤仍然是科学兴趣和辩论的主题。
