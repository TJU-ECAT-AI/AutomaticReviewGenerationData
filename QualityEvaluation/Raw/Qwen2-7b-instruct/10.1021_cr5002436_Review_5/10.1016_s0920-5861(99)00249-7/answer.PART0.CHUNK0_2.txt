The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the dissociative adsorption of isobutane. The second and third steps are quasi-equilibrated reactions that transform isobutane intermediates into isobutene. The final step is the desorption of hydrogen and isobutene products. The debate regarding which step is rate-limiting centers on the adsorption of isobutane and the subsequent transformation steps. Some studies suggest that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slowest step, implying that the formation of the activation complex for this step is rate-determining. However, other research indicates that the equilibrium constants for the transformation steps might be more influential. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its relevance in understanding the dynamics of dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the context of isobutane-to-isobutene conversion. This mechanism helps researchers understand how modifying catalyst components, such as tin and potassium, can influence reaction pathways and enhance selectivity.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is of continued scientific interest because it provides insights into the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons. By understanding the rates and mechanisms of dehydrogenation, scientists can optimize catalyst design for industrial applications, such as producing oxygenates for reformulated gasoline. The mechanism explains how the addition of tin to platinum catalysts can suppress isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, thereby enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. Additionally, the inclusion of potassium further reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles, suppressing isomerization and hydrogenolysis, and improving catalyst stability. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts, characterized by their high dehydrogenation activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation, offer a practical example of the application of this mechanism in achieving efficient and stable catalytic conversion processes. The stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the zeolite pore structure, facilitated by potassium, plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst performance under reaction conditions conducive to dehydrogenation.

脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤。第一步是异丁烷的离解吸附。第二和第三步是接近平衡的反应，将异丁烷中间体转化为异丁烯。最后一步是氢和异丁烯产品的脱附。关于哪个步骤是速率决定性的争论集中在异丁烷的吸附及其后续转化步骤上。一些研究表明，异丁烷的离解吸附是最慢的步骤，暗示形成该步骤的激活复合物是速率决定性的。然而，其他研究指出，转化步骤的平衡常数可能更有影响力。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界的热点话题，因为它有助于理解脱氢反应的动力学，特别是在异丁烷转化为异丁烯的背景下。这一机制为研究人员提供了一个理解如何通过修改催化剂成分（如锡和钾）来影响反应路径并增强选择性的视角。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制在科学界持续受到关注，因为它为了解催化转化提供了洞察。通过理解脱氢化反应的速率和机制，科学家可以优化催化剂设计以应用于工业应用，例如生产用于改性汽油的氧源。该机制解释了将锡添加到铂催化剂中如何抑制异构化和氢解反应，从而提高脱氢选择性。此外，钾的加入进一步减小了表面铂团簇的尺寸，抑制了异构化和氢解反应，并提高了催化剂稳定性。Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂以其高脱氢活性、高选择性和对失活的抵抗性而闻名，为这一机制在实现高效稳定催化转化过程中的应用提供了实际示例。在有利于脱氢的条件下，钾在沸石孔结构中稳定小的Pt/Sn颗粒，对于维持催化剂性能至关重要。
