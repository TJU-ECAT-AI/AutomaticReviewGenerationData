<p>Propane conversion rates, aromatics site-time yields, propene selectivity, aromatic selectivities, and hydrogen (H2) selectivity increase with increasing Zn content in H-ZSM5.</p>
<p>The data in Fig. 1 show that hydrogen desorption site-yields increase with increasing Zn content in H-ZSM5.</p>
<p>Previous structural characterization of the metal and acid density in Zn/H-ZSM5 has suggested that Zn resides at cation exchange sites as O-Zn+2-O species and interacts with two framework aluminum atoms.</p>
<p>Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation. When Zn is present, k3 becomes the dominant term in the denominator and β-scission rates decrease when Zn is added.</p>
<p>Relative rates of propene hydrogenation (r1) and propene aromatization (r2) can be measured from the rate of isotopic scrambling between propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene and from the isotopic content of the other reaction products.</p>
<p>The (r2/r1) ratios on these catalysts are almost independent of contact time (and conversion), but they are higher on Zn/H-ZSM5 than on H-ZSM5; these values (after extrapolation to zero conversion) are about 2 on H-ZSM5 and 6 on Zn/H-ZSM5.</p>
<p>The presence of Zn increases the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibration and the rate of deuterium incorporation into the products of C3H8/D2 reactions.</p>
<p>On Zn/H-ZSM5, propane conversion turnover rates and aromatic selectivities decrease as H2 pressure increases (0
26.6kPaH2), because adsorption-desorption sites provided by Zn cations allow gas phase hydrogen pressures to influence surface hydrogen concentrations and the rate of hydrogenation-dehydrogenation steps.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Activation of a C-H bond by a catalyst.  
2. Removal of a hydrogen atom (dehydrogenation).
3. Formation of a carbocation intermediate.
4. Rearrangement or cyclization to form a product.

Despite extensive study, the debate around which step is rate-limiting continues. Some argue that the dehydrogenation step (step 2) is rate-limiting, while others propose that the formation of the carbocation (step 3) is the rate-limiting step. This is due to the complex interactions between the catalyst and substrate, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetics of each step. 

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because understanding the rate-limiting step can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. Different catalysts or conditions might favor different steps, affecting the overall reaction rate and product selectivity. 

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is crucial because it explains how dehydrogenation reactions proceed, influencing various industrial processes such as petrochemical production and biofuel conversion. The ongoing debate highlights the complexity of catalytic chemistry and the need for further research to elucidate the specific factors controlling reaction rates and selectivities.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：
1. 催化剂活化C-H键。
2. 脱氢，移除氢原子。
3. 形成碳阳离子中间体。
4. 重排或环化形成产物。

尽管进行了广泛的实验研究，关于哪一步是速率限制性步骤的争论仍在继续。有人认为脱氢步骤（步骤2）是速率限制性步骤，而另一些人则认为形成碳阳离子（步骤3）是速率限制性步骤。这是由于催化剂和底物之间的复杂相互作用，以及每个步骤的动力学和热力学特性。

这个机制之所以引人关注并引发争议，是因为理解速率限制性步骤可以指导更高效的催化剂设计。不同的催化剂或条件可能会优先考虑不同的步骤，影响整体反应速率和产物选择性。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于理解脱氢反应如何进行至关重要，这影响着石油化学生产和生物燃料转化等工业过程。持续的争论凸显了催化化学的复杂性，以及进一步研究以阐明控制反应速率和选择性的特定因素的重要性。
