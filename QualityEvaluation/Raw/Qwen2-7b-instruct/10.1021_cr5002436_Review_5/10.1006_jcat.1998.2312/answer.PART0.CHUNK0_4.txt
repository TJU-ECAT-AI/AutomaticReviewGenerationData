[1] "Reactions of ethane and propane on H-ZSM5 lead primarily to undesired products of β-scission reactions."
[2] "Turnover rates, aro- matic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during alkane conversion increase as the density of exchanged Zn cations increases in H-ZSM5."
[3] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles,leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aro- matic products."
[4] "Reactions of propene/2-13C propane mixtures show that initial dehydrogenation steps become increasingly irreversible as Zn cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms and H2."
[5] "This process depletes the surface hydrogen pool available for the reverse hydrogenation reactions and it increases the overall rate of propene conversion to aromatics."
[6] "Zn cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation, but also the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated intermediates required in cyclization steps."
[7] "C3H8/C3D8 isotopic exchange rates are much higher than propane conversion rates."
[8] "Exchange rates are similar on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5, but negligible on Na-ZSM5, consistent with the involvement of Bronsted acid sites in isotopic scrambling within alkanes and with a predominant role of Zn in the recom- binative desorption of H-atoms."
[9] "This proposal is consistent with the effects of Zn cations on the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibra- tion, with the role of added H2 on alkane reaction rates, and with the rate of incorporation of D-atoms into reaction products formed from C3H8/D2 mixtures."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions describes four main steps: (1) adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of a C-H bond by the catalyst, (3) desorption of the hydrogen molecule from the surface, and (4) the remaining carbon skeleton undergoing further reactions, often leading to the formation of unsaturated compounds. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting stems from the complexity of these reactions, where each step can be influenced by various factors such as the catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the nature of the hydrocarbon substrate. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the intricate interplay between the different steps and the potential for multiple pathways to exist under varying conditions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述了四个主要步骤：（1）将烃分子吸附到催化剂表面，（2）催化剂激活C-H键，（3）从表面脱氢分子，（4）剩余的碳骨架进一步反应，通常导致形成不饱和化合物。关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤的争论源于这些反应的复杂性，其中每个步骤都可能受到各种因素的影响，如催化剂性质、反应条件和烃基质的性质。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为不同步骤之间的复杂相互作用以及在不同条件下可能存在多种途径。
