<p>The presence of Zn increases the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibration and the rate of deuterium incorporation into the products of C3H8/D2 reactions. These data suggest that Zn increases the rate of communication between gas phase and surface hydrogen pools.</p>
<p>In view of this, we have examined the effect of H2 concentration on propane conversion turnover rates and selectivities on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5.</p>
<p>Propane aromatization rates and selectivities are independent of H2 pressure (026.6 kPa H2) on H-ZSM5, as also reported by others (24, 31, 42, 46, 52).</p>
<p>The presence of Zn species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissociatively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatics selectivity.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface. The second step involves the activation of the C-H bond, often facilitated by a Bronsted acid site. The third step is the actual dehydrogenation, where the hydrogen atom is removed. The final step is the desorption of the resulting product from the catalyst surface. 

The ongoing debate revolves around which of these steps is considered rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the activation step is rate-limiting due to its unfavorable reaction affinity. Others propose that the dehydrogenation step is rate-limiting because of the high energy barrier. The desorption step is also a subject of debate, as it can be influenced by the structure of the catalyst and the properties of the product. 

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. This is because the specific conditions and catalyst properties can alter the relative rates of these steps, leading to variations in the mechanism's applicability and efficiency. Understanding these variations is crucial for optimizing dehydrogenation processes in various industrial applications, such as petrochemical refining and polymer production.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。第一步是反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附。第二步是激活C-H键，通常由Bronsted酸性位点促进。第三步是实际脱氢，氢原子被去除。最后一步是从催化剂表面脱附产物。 

围绕哪个步骤是决定性的展开了争论。一些研究人员认为活化步骤是决定性的，因为它具有不利的反应倾向。其他人则提出脱氢步骤是决定性的，因为存在较高的能量壁垒。脱附步骤也是讨论的主题，因为它受催化剂结构和产物性质的影响。 

尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点。这是因为特定条件和催化剂性质可以改变这些步骤的相对速率，导致机制的应用性和效率出现变化。理解这些变化对于优化各种工业应用中的脱氢过程（如石油精炼和聚合物生产）至关重要。
