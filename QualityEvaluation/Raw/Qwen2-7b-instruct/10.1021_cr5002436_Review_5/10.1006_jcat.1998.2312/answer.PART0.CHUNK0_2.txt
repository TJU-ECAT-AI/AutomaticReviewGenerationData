[1] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromatisation by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."
[2] "This proposal is consistent with the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibration and with the predominant presence of protium among adsorbed species and reaction products of C3H8/D2 mixtures on all catalysts."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions through four main steps. The steps involve activation of a hydrogen bond, breaking of the C-H bond, formation of a transition state, and release of the dehydrogenated product. The ongoing debate revolves around which of these steps is considered rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the rate-limiting step might be the formation of the transition state, while others suggest it could be the breaking of the C-H bond. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the dynamic interactions between the reactants and the catalyst.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应通过四个主要步骤。这些步骤包括氢键的活化、C-H键的断裂、过渡态的形成以及脱氢产物的释放。围绕哪一步是限制速率的争论仍在继续。一些研究人员认为，限制速率的步骤可能是过渡态的形成，而另一些人则认为可能是C-H键的断裂。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因是对反应路径的复杂性和反应物与催化剂之间动态相互作用的理解仍然存在挑战。
