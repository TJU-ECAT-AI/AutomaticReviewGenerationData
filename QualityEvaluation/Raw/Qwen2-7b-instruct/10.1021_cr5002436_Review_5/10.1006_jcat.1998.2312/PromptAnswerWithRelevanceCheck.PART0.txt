<p>The presence of Zn increases the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibration and the rate of deuterium incorporation into the products of C3H8/D2 reactions. These data suggest that Zn increases the rate of communication between gas phase and surface hydrogen pools.</p>
<p>In view of this, we have examined the effect of H2 concentration on propane conversion turnover rates and selectivities on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5.</p>
<p>Propane aromatization rates and selectivities are independent of H2 pressure (026.6 kPa H2) on H-ZSM5, as also reported by others (24, 31, 42, 46, 52).</p>
<p>The presence of Zn species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissociatively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatics selectivity.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface. The second step involves the activation of the C-H bond, often facilitated by a Bronsted acid site. The third step is the actual dehydrogenation, where the hydrogen atom is removed. The final step is the desorption of the resulting product from the catalyst surface. 

The ongoing debate revolves around which of these steps is considered rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the activation step is rate-limiting due to its unfavorable reaction affinity. Others propose that the dehydrogenation step is rate-limiting because of the high energy barrier. The desorption step is also a subject of debate, as it can be influenced by the structure of the catalyst and the properties of the product. 

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. This is because the specific conditions and catalyst properties can alter the relative rates of these steps, leading to variations in the mechanism's applicability and efficiency. Understanding these variations is crucial for optimizing dehydrogenation processes in various industrial applications, such as petrochemical refining and polymer production.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。第一步是反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附。第二步是激活C-H键，通常由Bronsted酸性位点促进。第三步是实际脱氢，氢原子被去除。最后一步是从催化剂表面脱附产物。 

围绕哪个步骤是决定性的展开了争论。一些研究人员认为活化步骤是决定性的，因为它具有不利的反应倾向。其他人则提出脱氢步骤是决定性的，因为存在较高的能量壁垒。脱附步骤也是讨论的主题，因为它受催化剂结构和产物性质的影响。 

尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点。这是因为特定条件和催化剂性质可以改变这些步骤的相对速率，导致机制的应用性和效率出现变化。理解这些变化对于优化各种工业应用中的脱氢过程（如石油精炼和聚合物生产）至关重要。

[1] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromatisation by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."
[2] "This proposal is consistent with the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibration and with the predominant presence of protium among adsorbed species and reaction products of C3H8/D2 mixtures on all catalysts."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions through four main steps. The steps involve activation of a hydrogen bond, breaking of the C-H bond, formation of a transition state, and release of the dehydrogenated product. The ongoing debate revolves around which of these steps is considered rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the rate-limiting step might be the formation of the transition state, while others suggest it could be the breaking of the C-H bond. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the dynamic interactions between the reactants and the catalyst.

<p>Propane conversion rates, aromatics site-time yields, propene selectivity, aromatic selectivities, and hydrogen (H2) selectivity increase with increasing Zn content in H-ZSM5.</p>
<p>The data in Fig. 1 show that hydrogen desorption site-yields increase with increasing Zn content in H-ZSM5.</p>
<p>Previous structural characterization of the metal and acid density in Zn/H-ZSM5 has suggested that Zn resides at cation exchange sites as O-Zn+2-O species and interacts with two framework aluminum atoms.</p>
<p>Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation. When Zn is present, k3 becomes the dominant term in the denominator and β-scission rates decrease when Zn is added.</p>
<p>Relative rates of propene hydrogenation (r1) and propene aromatization (r2) can be measured from the rate of isotopic scrambling between propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene and from the isotopic content of the other reaction products.</p>
<p>The (r2/r1) ratios on these catalysts are almost independent of contact time (and conversion), but they are higher on Zn/H-ZSM5 than on H-ZSM5; these values (after extrapolation to zero conversion) are about 2 on H-ZSM5 and 6 on Zn/H-ZSM5.</p>
<p>The presence of Zn increases the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibration and the rate of deuterium incorporation into the products of C3H8/D2 reactions.</p>
<p>On Zn/H-ZSM5, propane conversion turnover rates and aromatic selectivities decrease as H2 pressure increases (0
26.6kPaH2), because adsorption-desorption sites provided by Zn cations allow gas phase hydrogen pressures to influence surface hydrogen concentrations and the rate of hydrogenation-dehydrogenation steps.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Activation of a C-H bond by a catalyst.  
2. Removal of a hydrogen atom (dehydrogenation).
3. Formation of a carbocation intermediate.
4. Rearrangement or cyclization to form a product.

Despite extensive study, the debate around which step is rate-limiting continues. Some argue that the dehydrogenation step (step 2) is rate-limiting, while others propose that the formation of the carbocation (step 3) is the rate-limiting step. This is due to the complex interactions between the catalyst and substrate, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetics of each step. 

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because understanding the rate-limiting step can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. Different catalysts or conditions might favor different steps, affecting the overall reaction rate and product selectivity. 

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is crucial because it explains how dehydrogenation reactions proceed, influencing various industrial processes such as petrochemical production and biofuel conversion. The ongoing debate highlights the complexity of catalytic chemistry and the need for further research to elucidate the specific factors controlling reaction rates and selectivities.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：
1. 催化剂活化C-H键。
2. 脱氢，移除氢原子。
3. 形成碳阳离子中间体。
4. 重排或环化形成产物。

尽管进行了广泛的实验研究，关于哪一步是速率限制性步骤的争论仍在继续。有人认为脱氢步骤（步骤2）是速率限制性步骤，而另一些人则认为形成碳阳离子（步骤3）是速率限制性步骤。这是由于催化剂和底物之间的复杂相互作用，以及每个步骤的动力学和热力学特性。

这个机制之所以引人关注并引发争议，是因为理解速率限制性步骤可以指导更高效的催化剂设计。不同的催化剂或条件可能会优先考虑不同的步骤，影响整体反应速率和产物选择性。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于理解脱氢反应如何进行至关重要，这影响着石油化学生产和生物燃料转化等工业过程。持续的争论凸显了催化化学的复杂性，以及进一步研究以阐明控制反应速率和选择性的特定因素的重要性。

[1] "Reactions of ethane and propane on H-ZSM5 lead primarily to undesired products of β-scission reactions."
[2] "Turnover rates, aro- matic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during alkane conversion increase as the density of exchanged Zn cations increases in H-ZSM5."
[3] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles,leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aro- matic products."
[4] "Reactions of propene/2-13C propane mixtures show that initial dehydrogenation steps become increasingly irreversible as Zn cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms and H2."
[5] "This process depletes the surface hydrogen pool available for the reverse hydrogenation reactions and it increases the overall rate of propene conversion to aromatics."
[6] "Zn cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation, but also the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated intermediates required in cyclization steps."
[7] "C3H8/C3D8 isotopic exchange rates are much higher than propane conversion rates."
[8] "Exchange rates are similar on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5, but negligible on Na-ZSM5, consistent with the involvement of Bronsted acid sites in isotopic scrambling within alkanes and with a predominant role of Zn in the recom- binative desorption of H-atoms."
[9] "This proposal is consistent with the effects of Zn cations on the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibra- tion, with the role of added H2 on alkane reaction rates, and with the rate of incorporation of D-atoms into reaction products formed from C3H8/D2 mixtures."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions describes four main steps: (1) adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of a C-H bond by the catalyst, (3) desorption of the hydrogen molecule from the surface, and (4) the remaining carbon skeleton undergoing further reactions, often leading to the formation of unsaturated compounds. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting stems from the complexity of these reactions, where each step can be influenced by various factors such as the catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the nature of the hydrocarbon substrate. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the intricate interplay between the different steps and the potential for multiple pathways to exist under varying conditions.
