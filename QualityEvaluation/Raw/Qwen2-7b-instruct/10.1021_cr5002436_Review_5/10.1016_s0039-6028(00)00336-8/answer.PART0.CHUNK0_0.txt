[1] "In the case of platinum, where extensive rehybridization of double bonds is normally seen, a p-bonding can still be detected under special circumstances."
[2] "The catalytic hydrogenation of olefins has a long history, spanning more than a century; it was in 1897 that Sabatier and Senderens proved that in fact, transition metals are good catalysts for such processes."
[3] "Two extremes have been identified in connection with the bonding of molecularly adsorbed species on clean transition metal surfaces, namely, di-s metallacyclic, and p-bonded olefinic."
[4] "In the case of ethylene, in particular, a system that has been used as a benchmark to understand the adsorption characteristics of olefins on surfaces, it has been determined that on most transition metals, adsorption leads to significant rehybridization towards a single-bond character."
[5] "The transition from p- to di-s-bonding takes place only after heating above 52 K."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely discussed theory in the field of chemistry. This mechanism explains the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes on transition metal surfaces. The four main steps of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism are as follows:

1. **Adsorption**: Hydrogen molecules (H2) adsorb onto the surface of the metal catalyst. This step is usually the rate-limiting step because it involves the highest energy barrier.

2. **Hydrogenation**: Adsorbed hydrogen molecules react with the metal surface to form hydride ions (H-).

3. **Dehydrogenation**: The adsorbed alkane molecules react with the hydride ions to form alkenes.

4. **Desorption**: The newly formed alkenes then desorb from the metal surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy. While the adsorption step is typically seen as the rate-limiting step due to the high energy barrier involved, some researchers argue that the desorption step might also play a crucial role in controlling the overall reaction rate, especially in systems where the desorption barrier is relatively low.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy. This is because the actual reaction pathways can vary significantly depending on factors such as the type of metal catalyst, the surface conditions, and the specific reactants involved. Moreover, the exact mechanisms by which hydrogen is activated, adsorbed, and desorbed from the metal surface are still not fully understood, leading to ongoing debates and research efforts to refine our understanding of these processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制是描述催化脱氢反应的理论，广泛应用于化学领域。该机制解释了在过渡金属表面上脱氢烷烃生成烯烃的过程。Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：

1. **吸附**：氢分子(H2)吸附至金属催化剂表面。这是通常被认为是速率决定步骤的步骤，因为涉及到最高的能量壁垒。

2. **氢化**：吸附的氢分子与金属表面反应形成氢离子（H-）。

3. **脱氢**：吸附的烷烃分子与氢离子反应生成烯烃。

4. **脱附**：新生成的烯烃从金属表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤是速率决定步骤的争论仍然是科学界关注的焦点。虽然吸附步骤通常被视为速率决定步骤，因为它涉及最高能量壁垒，但有些研究者认为脱附步骤也可能在控制整体反应速率中起关键作用，特别是在脱附壁垒相对较低的情况下。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是一个感兴趣和争议的话题。这是因为根据金属催化剂的类型、表面条件以及具体反应物的不同，实际的反应路径会有所不同。此外，氢如何被激活、吸附以及从金属表面脱附的具体机制仍然不完全清楚，导致对这些过程的理解仍在不断改进中。
