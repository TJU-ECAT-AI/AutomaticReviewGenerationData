The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely studied and debated concept in the field of catalysis. It describes the four main steps of the reaction process. The mechanism begins with hydrogenation, where hydrogen molecules attach to the surface of a metal catalyst. The next step involves the formation of an intermediate complex, where hydrogen atoms are transferred to the substrate molecule. The third step is the breaking of the substrate's bonds, leading to the formation of a radical. Finally, the last step involves the recombination of radicals to form the desired product.

The ongoing debate revolves around which of these steps is considered the rate-limiting step in the reaction. The rate-limiting step is crucial as it determines the overall efficiency and speed of the catalytic process. Different researchers have proposed various perspectives on this issue, with some arguing for the hydrogenation step, others for the formation of the intermediate complex, and yet others for the breaking of the substrate's bonds or the recombination of radicals.

Despite decades of research, the exact identity of the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains uncertain. This uncertainty contributes to the continued interest and controversy surrounding the mechanism. The complexity of the reaction pathways, the influence of reaction conditions, and the intricate dynamics of the catalytic surface make it challenging to pinpoint the rate-limiting step definitively.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制是催化领域长期以来研究和争论的一个概念。它描述了反应过程的四个主要步骤。机制从氢化开始，氢分子附着在金属催化剂的表面上。接下来的步骤涉及形成中间复合物，其中氢原子转移到基团分子上。第三步是断裂基团的键，导致自由基的形成。最后一步涉及自由基的再组合以形成所需的产品。

持续的辩论围绕着这些步骤中哪一步被认为是反应的速率限制步骤。速率限制步骤对于确定催化过程的整体效率和速度至关重要。不同的研究人员提出了不同的观点，有人认为是氢化步骤，有人认为是形成中间复合物，还有人认为是断裂基团的键或自由基的再组合。

尽管几十年的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制中速率限制步骤的确切身份仍然不确定。这种不确定性使得该机制继续受到关注并引起争议。反应路径的复杂性、反应条件的影响以及催化表面的复杂动态使得很难明确地指出速率限制步骤。
