[1] "In the case of platinum, where extensive rehybridization of double bonds is normally seen, a p-bonding can still be detected under special circumstances."
[2] "The catalytic hydrogenation of olefins has a long history, spanning more than a century; it was in 1897 that Sabatier and Senderens proved that in fact, transition metals are good catalysts for such processes."
[3] "Two extremes have been identified in connection with the bonding of molecularly adsorbed species on clean transition metal surfaces, namely, di-s metallacyclic, and p-bonded olefinic."
[4] "In the case of ethylene, in particular, a system that has been used as a benchmark to understand the adsorption characteristics of olefins on surfaces, it has been determined that on most transition metals, adsorption leads to significant rehybridization towards a single-bond character."
[5] "The transition from p- to di-s-bonding takes place only after heating above 52 K."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely discussed theory in the field of chemistry. This mechanism explains the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes on transition metal surfaces. The four main steps of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism are as follows:

1. **Adsorption**: Hydrogen molecules (H2) adsorb onto the surface of the metal catalyst. This step is usually the rate-limiting step because it involves the highest energy barrier.

2. **Hydrogenation**: Adsorbed hydrogen molecules react with the metal surface to form hydride ions (H-).

3. **Dehydrogenation**: The adsorbed alkane molecules react with the hydride ions to form alkenes.

4. **Desorption**: The newly formed alkenes then desorb from the metal surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy. While the adsorption step is typically seen as the rate-limiting step due to the high energy barrier involved, some researchers argue that the desorption step might also play a crucial role in controlling the overall reaction rate, especially in systems where the desorption barrier is relatively low.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy. This is because the actual reaction pathways can vary significantly depending on factors such as the type of metal catalyst, the surface conditions, and the specific reactants involved. Moreover, the exact mechanisms by which hydrogen is activated, adsorbed, and desorbed from the metal surface are still not fully understood, leading to ongoing debates and research efforts to refine our understanding of these processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制是描述催化脱氢反应的理论，广泛应用于化学领域。该机制解释了在过渡金属表面上脱氢烷烃生成烯烃的过程。Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：

1. **吸附**：氢分子(H2)吸附至金属催化剂表面。这是通常被认为是速率决定步骤的步骤，因为涉及到最高的能量壁垒。

2. **氢化**：吸附的氢分子与金属表面反应形成氢离子（H-）。

3. **脱氢**：吸附的烷烃分子与氢离子反应生成烯烃。

4. **脱附**：新生成的烯烃从金属表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤是速率决定步骤的争论仍然是科学界关注的焦点。虽然吸附步骤通常被视为速率决定步骤，因为它涉及最高能量壁垒，但有些研究者认为脱附步骤也可能在控制整体反应速率中起关键作用，特别是在脱附壁垒相对较低的情况下。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是一个感兴趣和争议的话题。这是因为根据金属催化剂的类型、表面条件以及具体反应物的不同，实际的反应路径会有所不同。此外，氢如何被激活、吸附以及从金属表面脱附的具体机制仍然不完全清楚，导致对这些过程的理解仍在不断改进中。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely studied and debated concept in the field of catalysis. It describes the four main steps of the reaction process. The mechanism begins with hydrogenation, where hydrogen molecules attach to the surface of a metal catalyst. The next step involves the formation of an intermediate complex, where hydrogen atoms are transferred to the substrate molecule. The third step is the breaking of the substrate's bonds, leading to the formation of a radical. Finally, the last step involves the recombination of radicals to form the desired product.

The ongoing debate revolves around which of these steps is considered the rate-limiting step in the reaction. The rate-limiting step is crucial as it determines the overall efficiency and speed of the catalytic process. Different researchers have proposed various perspectives on this issue, with some arguing for the hydrogenation step, others for the formation of the intermediate complex, and yet others for the breaking of the substrate's bonds or the recombination of radicals.

Despite decades of research, the exact identity of the rate-limiting step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains uncertain. This uncertainty contributes to the continued interest and controversy surrounding the mechanism. The complexity of the reaction pathways, the influence of reaction conditions, and the intricate dynamics of the catalytic surface make it challenging to pinpoint the rate-limiting step definitively.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制是催化领域长期以来研究和争论的一个概念。它描述了反应过程的四个主要步骤。机制从氢化开始，氢分子附着在金属催化剂的表面上。接下来的步骤涉及形成中间复合物，其中氢原子转移到基团分子上。第三步是断裂基团的键，导致自由基的形成。最后一步涉及自由基的再组合以形成所需的产品。

持续的辩论围绕着这些步骤中哪一步被认为是反应的速率限制步骤。速率限制步骤对于确定催化过程的整体效率和速度至关重要。不同的研究人员提出了不同的观点，有人认为是氢化步骤，有人认为是形成中间复合物，还有人认为是断裂基团的键或自由基的再组合。

尽管几十年的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制中速率限制步骤的确切身份仍然不确定。这种不确定性使得该机制继续受到关注并引起争议。反应路径的复杂性、反应条件的影响以及催化表面的复杂动态使得很难明确地指出速率限制步骤。
