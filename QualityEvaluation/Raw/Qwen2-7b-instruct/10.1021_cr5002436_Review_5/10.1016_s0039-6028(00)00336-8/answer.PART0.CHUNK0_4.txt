[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of olefins has a long history, spanning more than a century; it was in 1897 that Sabatier and Senderens proved that catalysts made of transition metals are effective for such processes."
[2] "A number of mechanisms have been proposed over the years, but limited direct evidence has been gathered to prove the validity of the main proposals from the old catalytic reports."
[3] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is the one most commonly discussed in the literature. It describes the four main steps of the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "The mechanism proposes that hydrogen is initially adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst."
[5] "In the second step, hydrogen atoms are transferred to the adsorbed olefin, leading to the formation of a hydrogenated olefin species."
[6] "The third step involves the breaking of the olefin's double bond, leading to the formation of an alkene intermediate."
[7] "The final step is the removal of the hydrogenated olefin species, releasing the alkene product and regenerating the catalyst."
[8] "Regarding the rate-limiting step, the debate is ongoing, with some researchers arguing that it is the adsorption of hydrogen, others pointing to the hydrogen transfer, and still others considering the breaking of the double bond as the most rate-determining step."
[9] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy."
[10] "This is partly due to the complexity of the reactions involved and the difficulty in controlling and observing the various steps under industrial conditions."
[11] "The mechanism's simplicity and its ability to explain a wide range of catalytic behaviors make it appealing to researchers."
[12] "However, the lack of consensus on the rate-limiting step and the need for further experimental evidence to confirm its validity continue to fuel debates in the field."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the four main steps of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. These steps include the adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface, the transfer of hydrogen to the adsorbed olefin, the breaking of the olefin's double bond, and the removal of the hydrogenated olefin species. The debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is ongoing. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reactions and the need for further experimental evidence. The mechanism's simplicity and its ability to explain a wide range of catalytic behaviors make it appealing to researchers.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤。这些步骤包括催化剂表面吸附氢气、将氢转移到吸附的烯烃、烯烃双键断裂以及移除氢化烯烃物种。关于哪一步是决定性的，争论仍在继续。尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，部分原因在于反应的复杂性和在工业条件下控制和观察各个步骤的难度。机制的简单性和它对广泛催化行为的解释使其对研究人员具有吸引力。然而，对决定性步骤的缺乏共识和进一步实验证据确认其有效性的需要继续激发领域内的辩论。
