[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of olefins has a long history, spanning more than a century; it was in 1897 that Sabatier and Senderens proved that catalysts made of transition metals are effective for such processes."
[2] "A number of mechanisms have been proposed over the years, but limited direct evidence has been gathered to prove the validity of the main proposals from the old catalytic reports."
[3] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, which is widely discussed, consists of four main steps: (1) hydrogenation of the substrate to an alkyl group, (2) migration of the alkyl group to the surface, (3) desorption of the alkyl group, and (4) recombination with a hydrogen atom to form a product."
[4] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting revolves around the efficiency of alkyl group migration to the surface and the recombination step."
[5] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the surface chemistry involved and the difficulty in isolating intermediates for direct observation."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four primary stages: hydrogenation of the substrate to an alkyl group, migration of the alkyl group to the surface, desorption of the alkyl group, and recombination with a hydrogen atom to form a product. The debate surrounding the rate-limiting step centers on the efficiency of alkyl group migration to the surface and the recombination step. This mechanism continues to be a focus of scientific inquiry due to the intricate surface chemistry involved and the challenges in directly observing intermediates.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：将底物氢化为烷基团，烷基团迁移到表面，烷基团脱附，以及与氢原子重新组合形成产物。关于哪一步是决定性的步骤的辩论集中在烷基团向表面迁移的效率和重新组合步骤上。尽管已经研究了一个多世纪，但该机制仍然是科学界关注的焦点，原因是对表面化学的复杂性以及直接观察中间体的困难。
