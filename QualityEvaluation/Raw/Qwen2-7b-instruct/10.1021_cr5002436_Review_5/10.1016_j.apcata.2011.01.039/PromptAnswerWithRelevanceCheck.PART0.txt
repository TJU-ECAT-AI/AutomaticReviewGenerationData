The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is described in the literature. It consists of four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface. 
2. Activation of the molecule, often involving breaking of bonds within the molecule.
3. Reaction between the activated molecule and another species, such as hydrogen.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

Regarding the ongoing debate over which step is considered rate-limiting, the literature does not provide a clear consensus. However, the first step, adsorption, is often debated due to its dependence on various factors such as surface properties and interactions between the molecule and the catalyst.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the interactions involved and the variability in experimental conditions. The literature indicates that the mechanism is supported by experimental evidence and quantum chemistry calculations, which suggests that it provides a reasonable description of the dehydrogenation process. 

The kinetic model developed in the study integrates the coking formation kinetic model into the deactivation model, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the process. This model accounts for the effects of propene and hydrogen on the rate of coke formation and deactivation, proposing that propene promotes coke formation while hydrogen depresses it. The model predicts the changes in propane conversion with time-on-stream under different operating conditions, providing insights into the kinetics of the process.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a subject of interest due to its fundamental role in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. Despite the advancements in understanding and modeling, there is still room for further research to refine the mechanism and improve predictive capabilities, especially concerning the rate-limiting steps and the influence of various parameters on the reaction kinetics.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制进行了描述。它包含四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 分子的活化，通常涉及分子内部键的断裂。
3. 活化分子与另一种物种（如氢）之间的反应。
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面的脱附。

关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争议，文献中没有明确的共识。然而，第一步，吸附，经常被争论，因为它依赖于各种因素，如表面性质和分子与催化剂之间的相互作用。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为涉及到的相互作用的复杂性和实验条件的变化性。文献表明，该机制得到了实验证据和量子化学计算的支持，这表明它为脱氢过程提供了一个合理的描述。

研究中开发的热力学模型将焦炭形成热力学模型整合到失活模型中，允许对过程进行更全面的理解。这个模型考虑了丙烷、氢对焦炭形成速率的影响，并提出丙烯促进焦炭形成而氢抑制其形成。该模型预测了不同操作条件下丙烷转化率随时间变化的情况，提供了过程动力学的见解。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制由于其在催化脱氢反应中的基本作用，仍然是一个感兴趣的话题。尽管在理解和建模方面取得了进展，但仍需要进一步研究来细化机制并提高预测能力，尤其是在确定速率限制步骤以及各种参数对反应动力学影响方面的研究。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, also known as the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, describes the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene. It consists of four main steps:

1. **Adsorption of Propane**: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface.
2. **Desorption of Hydrogen**: Hydrogen atoms desorb from the surface.
3. **Formation of Propyl Radical**: A propyl radical is formed by the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule.
4. **Conversion of Propyl Radical**: The propyl radical undergoes a chemical reaction to form propene.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting involves the first step of adsorption and the fourth step of propyl radical conversion. Some studies argue that the adsorption of propane is the rate-limiting step, while others suggest that the conversion of the propyl radical is the rate-determining step. This debate remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because it impacts the understanding of reaction kinetics and the development of more efficient catalysts.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because:

- It provides insights into the fundamental aspects of catalytic reactions.
- It helps in the design and optimization of catalytic processes.
- Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for improving catalyst efficiency and stability.

Despite extensive research, the exact role of each step in the mechanism still eludes clear consensus, contributing to ongoing debates within the scientific community. The development of kinetic models that accurately predict the behavior of the dehydrogenation process, as presented in this literature, offers a promising direction for resolving some of these debates and advancing the field.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and its variants continue to be a focus of research due to their relevance in understanding the kinetics of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The integration of kinetic models with considerations of coke formation and catalyst deactivation provides a comprehensive framework for predicting and optimizing the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts under various operating conditions.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is centered around four main steps. The first step involves the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface. The second step is the breaking of a bond within the adsorbed molecule, often involving the removal of a hydrogen atom. The third step is the desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface. The fourth step is the release of any remaining hydrogen atoms that were not removed during the second step. 

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the complexity of the reaction pathway and the potential for multiple pathways to exist depending on the specific catalyst and conditions. The first step of adsorption is often considered a rate-limiting step because it requires the reactant molecule to overcome an energy barrier to attach to the catalyst surface. However, the actual rate-limiting step can shift depending on factors such as temperature, the nature of the catalyst, and the concentration of reactants.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the intricate details that govern the rates of individual steps and their contributions to the overall reaction. Understanding these details is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and reaction conditions, which is why research continues to focus on refining kinetic models and elucidating the precise mechanisms at play in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制主要围绕四个主要步骤。第一步涉及反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附。第二步是吸附分子内键的断裂，通常涉及到氢原子的去除。第三步是从催化剂表面的产物分子脱附。第四步是释放在第二步中未去除的任何剩余氢原子。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论源于反应途径的复杂性和可能存在多种路径，这取决于具体的催化剂和条件。吸附步骤的第一步往往被认为是速率限制步骤，因为它需要反应物分子克服能量壁垒才能附着到催化剂表面。然而，实际的速率限制步骤可能会根据温度、催化剂的性质以及反应物浓度等因素而改变。

尽管已经研究了一个多世纪，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为控制单个步骤速率的细节以及它们对整体反应的贡献仍然很复杂。理解这些细节对于优化催化剂设计和反应条件至关重要，这就是为什么研究继续集中在细化动力学模型并阐明脱氢反应中精确机制的原因。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely discussed concept in chemical engineering. It proposes four main steps:

1. **Adsorption**: The reactant molecule (such as propane) is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface.
2. **Activation**: The adsorbed molecule undergoes activation, which involves breaking of bonds within the molecule.
3. **Reactor**: The activated molecule then undergoes a reaction, typically involving the removal of a hydrogen atom or a group of hydrogen atoms.
4. **Desorption**: The product of the reaction is then desorbed from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting centers around the activation and reactor steps. Some studies argue that the rate-determining step is the activation process, where the molecule's bonds are broken. Others propose that the reaction itself, where hydrogen is removed, is the rate-limiting step. This debate persists because the efficiency of these steps can vary depending on factors like catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the nature of the molecule being dehydrogenated.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for a few reasons:

- **Complexity of Catalytic Surfaces**: Catalysts often consist of complex surfaces with multiple sites and orientations, each potentially having different reactivity.
- **Dynamic Nature of Surface Chemistry**: The surface chemistry of catalysts can change rapidly during a reaction, affecting the rates of various steps.
- **Experimental Challenges**: Accurately measuring the rates of each step in a catalytic reaction is challenging, especially given the ultrafast timescales involved.
- **Theoretical Limitations**: Theoretical models struggle to fully capture the intricate dynamics of catalytic surfaces and molecular interactions.

This mechanism continues to be of interest because understanding and optimizing it can lead to improvements in catalyst design, leading to more efficient processes for producing valuable chemicals and fuels.

The model discussed in the document identifies the first CH cleavage in propane as the rate-determining step. It aligns with experimental findings and quantum chemistry calculations, suggesting a robust understanding of the mechanism. The model also considers the role of propene in coke formation, noting that hydrogen inhibits this process. The model effectively predicts how catalyst deactivation occurs, relating it to the rate of coke formation. It takes into account the opposing effects of propene and hydrogen on coke formation, providing insights into catalyst longevity and operational strategies.

In conclusion, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its relevance in understanding catalytic processes. Despite advancements in technology and theory, the complexity of catalysis and the need for efficient, sustainable chemical production processes continue to drive research into refining and applying this fundamental mechanism.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，这是一个在化学工程中广泛讨论的概念。它提出了四个主要步骤：

1. **吸附**：反应分子（如丙烷）被吸附到催化剂表面。
2. **激活**：吸附的分子经历活化，涉及分子内键的断裂。
3. **反应器**：激活后的分子随后进行反应，通常涉及去除一个或一组氢原子。
4. **脱附**：反应产物从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的争论集中在激活和反应步骤上。一些研究表明，决定性的步骤可能是激活过程，其中分子内的键被打破。另一些则认为，氢的去除是决定性的步骤。这种争论持续存在，因为这些步骤的效率会因催化剂类型、反应条件以及所处理的分子性质的不同而变化。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，这一机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题有几个原因：

- **催化剂表面的复杂性**：催化剂往往由复杂的表面组成，包含多种位点和取向，每个可能具有不同的活性。
- **表面化学的动态性**：催化剂的表面化学可以在反应过程中快速变化，影响各个步骤的速率。
- **实验挑战**：准确测量催化反应中每个步骤的速率极具挑战性，尤其是在涉及超快时间尺度的情况下。
- **理论限制**：理论模型难以完全捕捉催化剂表面和分子相互作用的复杂性。

由于理解并优化这一机制可以导致催化剂设计的改进，从而提高生产有价值的化学品和燃料的效率，因此这一机制仍然受到关注。

文档中讨论的模型将丙烷的第一个CH裂解识别为决定性的步骤，并与实验发现和量子化学计算相吻合，表明对机制有坚实的理解。该模型还考虑了丙烯在焦炭形成中的作用，指出氢抑制了这一过程。模型有效地预测了催化剂失活的情况，考虑到焦炭形成的速度，并考虑到丙烯促进而氢抑制焦炭形成的事实。它考虑了丙烯和氢在焦炭形成中的相对作用，提供了关于催化剂寿命和操作策略的见解。

总之，Horiuti-Polanyi机制之所以受到科学界的持续关注，是因为它对理解催化过程的重要性。尽管在技术进步和理论发展方面取得了进展，但催化的复杂性和对更高效、可持续化学生产过程的需求继续推动着对这一基本机制进行研究和应用。
