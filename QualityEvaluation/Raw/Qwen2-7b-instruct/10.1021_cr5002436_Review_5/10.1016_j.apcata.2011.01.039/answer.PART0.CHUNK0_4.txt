The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four primary steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, cleavage of the first hydrogen bond, formation of an intermediate species, and desorption of the product molecule. The first step, cleavage of the first hydrogen bond, is identified as the rate-limiting step. The debate over which step is rate-limiting persists due to the complexity of reaction mechanisms and the variability of conditions. Despite over a century of study, this mechanism remains a subject of scientific interest and contention because of the intricate nature of dehydrogenation reactions and the impact of multiple factors on their rates.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附，第一个氢键的断裂，中间物种的形成，以及最终产物分子的脱附。第一个步骤，即第一个氢键的断裂，被确认为决定速率的步骤。关于哪一步是决定速率的步骤的争论继续存在，这归因于反应机制的复杂性和研究条件的多样性。尽管已经进行了一个多世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为脱氢反应的复杂性以及多个因素对它们速率的影响。
