The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely discussed concept in chemical engineering. It proposes four main steps:

1. **Adsorption**: The reactant molecule (such as propane) is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface.
2. **Activation**: The adsorbed molecule undergoes activation, which involves breaking of bonds within the molecule.
3. **Reactor**: The activated molecule then undergoes a reaction, typically involving the removal of a hydrogen atom or a group of hydrogen atoms.
4. **Desorption**: The product of the reaction is then desorbed from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting centers around the activation and reactor steps. Some studies argue that the rate-determining step is the activation process, where the molecule's bonds are broken. Others propose that the reaction itself, where hydrogen is removed, is the rate-limiting step. This debate persists because the efficiency of these steps can vary depending on factors like catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the nature of the molecule being dehydrogenated.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for a few reasons:

- **Complexity of Catalytic Surfaces**: Catalysts often consist of complex surfaces with multiple sites and orientations, each potentially having different reactivity.
- **Dynamic Nature of Surface Chemistry**: The surface chemistry of catalysts can change rapidly during a reaction, affecting the rates of various steps.
- **Experimental Challenges**: Accurately measuring the rates of each step in a catalytic reaction is challenging, especially given the ultrafast timescales involved.
- **Theoretical Limitations**: Theoretical models struggle to fully capture the intricate dynamics of catalytic surfaces and molecular interactions.

This mechanism continues to be of interest because understanding and optimizing it can lead to improvements in catalyst design, leading to more efficient processes for producing valuable chemicals and fuels.

The model discussed in the document identifies the first CH cleavage in propane as the rate-determining step. It aligns with experimental findings and quantum chemistry calculations, suggesting a robust understanding of the mechanism. The model also considers the role of propene in coke formation, noting that hydrogen inhibits this process. The model effectively predicts how catalyst deactivation occurs, relating it to the rate of coke formation. It takes into account the opposing effects of propene and hydrogen on coke formation, providing insights into catalyst longevity and operational strategies.

In conclusion, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its relevance in understanding catalytic processes. Despite advancements in technology and theory, the complexity of catalysis and the need for efficient, sustainable chemical production processes continue to drive research into refining and applying this fundamental mechanism.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，这是一个在化学工程中广泛讨论的概念。它提出了四个主要步骤：

1. **吸附**：反应分子（如丙烷）被吸附到催化剂表面。
2. **激活**：吸附的分子经历活化，涉及分子内键的断裂。
3. **反应器**：激活后的分子随后进行反应，通常涉及去除一个或一组氢原子。
4. **脱附**：反应产物从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的争论集中在激活和反应步骤上。一些研究表明，决定性的步骤可能是激活过程，其中分子内的键被打破。另一些则认为，氢的去除是决定性的步骤。这种争论持续存在，因为这些步骤的效率会因催化剂类型、反应条件以及所处理的分子性质的不同而变化。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，这一机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题有几个原因：

- **催化剂表面的复杂性**：催化剂往往由复杂的表面组成，包含多种位点和取向，每个可能具有不同的活性。
- **表面化学的动态性**：催化剂的表面化学可以在反应过程中快速变化，影响各个步骤的速率。
- **实验挑战**：准确测量催化反应中每个步骤的速率极具挑战性，尤其是在涉及超快时间尺度的情况下。
- **理论限制**：理论模型难以完全捕捉催化剂表面和分子相互作用的复杂性。

由于理解并优化这一机制可以导致催化剂设计的改进，从而提高生产有价值的化学品和燃料的效率，因此这一机制仍然受到关注。

文档中讨论的模型将丙烷的第一个CH裂解识别为决定性的步骤，并与实验发现和量子化学计算相吻合，表明对机制有坚实的理解。该模型还考虑了丙烯在焦炭形成中的作用，指出氢抑制了这一过程。模型有效地预测了催化剂失活的情况，考虑到焦炭形成的速度，并考虑到丙烯促进而氢抑制焦炭形成的事实。它考虑了丙烯和氢在焦炭形成中的相对作用，提供了关于催化剂寿命和操作策略的见解。

总之，Horiuti-Polanyi机制之所以受到科学界的持续关注，是因为它对理解催化过程的重要性。尽管在技术进步和理论发展方面取得了进展，但催化的复杂性和对更高效、可持续化学生产过程的需求继续推动着对这一基本机制进行研究和应用。
