The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is described in the literature. It consists of four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface. 
2. Activation of the molecule, often involving breaking of bonds within the molecule.
3. Reaction between the activated molecule and another species, such as hydrogen.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

Regarding the ongoing debate over which step is considered rate-limiting, the literature does not provide a clear consensus. However, the first step, adsorption, is often debated due to its dependence on various factors such as surface properties and interactions between the molecule and the catalyst.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the interactions involved and the variability in experimental conditions. The literature indicates that the mechanism is supported by experimental evidence and quantum chemistry calculations, which suggests that it provides a reasonable description of the dehydrogenation process. 

The kinetic model developed in the study integrates the coking formation kinetic model into the deactivation model, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the process. This model accounts for the effects of propene and hydrogen on the rate of coke formation and deactivation, proposing that propene promotes coke formation while hydrogen depresses it. The model predicts the changes in propane conversion with time-on-stream under different operating conditions, providing insights into the kinetics of the process.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a subject of interest due to its fundamental role in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. Despite the advancements in understanding and modeling, there is still room for further research to refine the mechanism and improve predictive capabilities, especially concerning the rate-limiting steps and the influence of various parameters on the reaction kinetics.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制进行了描述。它包含四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 分子的活化，通常涉及分子内部键的断裂。
3. 活化分子与另一种物种（如氢）之间的反应。
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面的脱附。

关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争议，文献中没有明确的共识。然而，第一步，吸附，经常被争论，因为它依赖于各种因素，如表面性质和分子与催化剂之间的相互作用。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为涉及到的相互作用的复杂性和实验条件的变化性。文献表明，该机制得到了实验证据和量子化学计算的支持，这表明它为脱氢过程提供了一个合理的描述。

研究中开发的热力学模型将焦炭形成热力学模型整合到失活模型中，允许对过程进行更全面的理解。这个模型考虑了丙烷、氢对焦炭形成速率的影响，并提出丙烯促进焦炭形成而氢抑制其形成。该模型预测了不同操作条件下丙烷转化率随时间变化的情况，提供了过程动力学的见解。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制由于其在催化脱氢反应中的基本作用，仍然是一个感兴趣的话题。尽管在理解和建模方面取得了进展，但仍需要进一步研究来细化机制并提高预测能力，尤其是在确定速率限制步骤以及各种参数对反应动力学影响方面的研究。
