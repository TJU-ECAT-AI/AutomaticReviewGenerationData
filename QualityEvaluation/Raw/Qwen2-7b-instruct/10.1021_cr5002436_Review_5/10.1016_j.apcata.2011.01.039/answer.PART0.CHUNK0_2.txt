[1] "Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 are proposed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments."
[2] "When taking into consideration the fitting accuracy, the number of fitting parameters and the rigor of the reaction mechanism, the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation based on the assumptions of step-wise dehydrogenation, the first step dehydrogenation as the rate-determining step, and low surface coverage of C3H7 outperforms other kinetic models."
[3] "The model (M2-1) has a fitting residual slightly higher than (M2) and (M1), it is considered as the best kinetic model for propane dehydrogenation because the underlying reaction mechanism is reliable, the rate equations are simple, and the predictions are acceptable."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is centered around four main steps. The first step involves the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface. The second step is the breaking of a bond within the adsorbed molecule, often involving the removal of a hydrogen atom. The third step is the desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface. The fourth step is the release of any remaining hydrogen atoms that were not removed during the second step. 

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the complexity of the reaction pathway and the potential for multiple pathways to exist depending on the specific catalyst and conditions. The first step of adsorption is often considered a rate-limiting step because it requires the reactant molecule to overcome an energy barrier to attach to the catalyst surface. However, the actual rate-limiting step can shift depending on factors such as temperature, the nature of the catalyst, and the concentration of reactants.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the intricate details that govern the rates of individual steps and their contributions to the overall reaction. Understanding these details is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and reaction conditions, which is why research continues to focus on refining kinetic models and elucidating the precise mechanisms at play in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制主要围绕四个主要步骤。第一步涉及反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附。第二步是吸附分子内键的断裂，通常涉及到氢原子的去除。第三步是从催化剂表面的产物分子脱附。第四步是释放在第二步中未去除的任何剩余氢原子。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论源于反应途径的复杂性和可能存在多种路径，这取决于具体的催化剂和条件。吸附步骤的第一步往往被认为是速率限制步骤，因为它需要反应物分子克服能量壁垒才能附着到催化剂表面。然而，实际的速率限制步骤可能会根据温度、催化剂的性质以及反应物浓度等因素而改变。

尽管已经研究了一个多世纪，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为控制单个步骤速率的细节以及它们对整体反应的贡献仍然很复杂。理解这些细节对于优化催化剂设计和反应条件至关重要，这就是为什么研究继续集中在细化动力学模型并阐明脱氢反应中精确机制的原因。
