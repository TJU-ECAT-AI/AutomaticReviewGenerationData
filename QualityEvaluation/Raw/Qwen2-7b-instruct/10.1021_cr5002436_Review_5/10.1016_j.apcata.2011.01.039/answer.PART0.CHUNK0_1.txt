[1] "Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt -Sn/Al2O3 are proposed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments."
[2] "When taking into consideration the fitting accuracy, the number of fitting parameters and the rigor of the reaction mechanism, the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation based on the assumptions of step-wise dehydrogenation, the first step dehydrogenation as the rate-determining step, and low surface coverage of C3H7 outperforms other kinetic models."
[3] "The first CH cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step."
[4] "The underlying reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the kinetic model agrees with experiments and quantum chemistry calculations."
[5] "The model describes well the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, which is related to the rate of coke formation and takes into consideration the facts that propene promotes while hydrogen depresses coke formation, is proposed."
[6] "The changes of propane conversion with time-on-stream under different operating conditions are well predicted by the deactivation model."
[7] "The strategy for kinetic modeling employed in the present work is to directly integrate the coking formation kinetic model into the deactivation model, making it possible to avoid measurement of coke content in situ."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, also known as the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, describes the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene. It consists of four main steps:

1. **Adsorption of Propane**: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface.
2. **Desorption of Hydrogen**: Hydrogen atoms desorb from the surface.
3. **Formation of Propyl Radical**: A propyl radical is formed by the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule.
4. **Conversion of Propyl Radical**: The propyl radical undergoes a chemical reaction to form propene.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting involves the first step of adsorption and the fourth step of propyl radical conversion. Some studies argue that the adsorption of propane is the rate-limiting step, while others suggest that the conversion of the propyl radical is the rate-determining step. This debate remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because it impacts the understanding of reaction kinetics and the development of more efficient catalysts.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because:

- It provides insights into the fundamental aspects of catalytic reactions.
- It helps in the design and optimization of catalytic processes.
- Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for improving catalyst efficiency and stability.

Despite extensive research, the exact role of each step in the mechanism still eludes clear consensus, contributing to ongoing debates within the scientific community. The development of kinetic models that accurately predict the behavior of the dehydrogenation process, as presented in this literature, offers a promising direction for resolving some of these debates and advancing the field.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and its variants continue to be a focus of research due to their relevance in understanding the kinetics of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The integration of kinetic models with considerations of coke formation and catalyst deactivation provides a comprehensive framework for predicting and optimizing the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts under various operating conditions.

霍里图-波兰尼机制，又称朗缪尔-汉希尔伍德机制，描述了丙烷催化脱氢为丙烯的过程。它包含四个主要步骤：

1. **丙烷吸附**：丙烷分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. **氢原子脱附**：氢原子从表面脱附。
3. **丙基自由基形成**：通过移除吸附在丙烷分子上的氢原子，形成丙基自由基。
4. **丙基自由基的化学反应**：丙基自由基进行化学反应生成丙烯。

关于哪一步是速率决定步骤的争论涉及吸附步骤和丙基自由基转换步骤。一些研究认为吸附步骤是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则认为丙基自由基转换是速率决定步骤。尽管这一机制已经被研究了近一个世纪，争论仍在继续，因为它影响着反应动力学的理解以及更高效催化剂的发展。

霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

- 它提供了催化反应基本方面的洞察。
- 它有助于设计和优化催化过程。
- 理解速率决定步骤对于提高催化剂效率和稳定性至关重要。

尽管进行了大量研究，但对机制中每个步骤的确切作用仍然缺乏明确共识，这导致了科学界内部的持续争论。所提出的动力学模型能够准确预测脱氢过程的行为，为解决部分争议并推动该领域发展提供了一种有希望的方向。

霍里图-波兰尼机制及其变体继续成为研究的重点，因为它们与理解催化脱氢反应动力学相关。将动力学模型与焦油形成和催化剂失活考虑相结合，提供了一个全面框架，用于预测和优化不同操作条件下的脱氢催化剂性能。
