<p>The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. (13-15, 17-20)</p>
<p>For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are:</p>
<p>(1) (2) (3) (4)</p>
<p>At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step (rds) over a range of metal catalysts, (13, 14) and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts. (18-20) However, this reaction mechanism does not take side reactions into account.</p>
<p>The reaction orders of ethane dehydrogenation with respect to hydrogen, ethene, and ethane could be estimated to 0.4, 0.9, and 0.95, respectively. Negative dependence of the reaction rate on ethene and hydrogen could be explained either by increased reverse reaction or by increased occupation of active surface sites by species of ethene and hydrogen adsorption.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism explains catalytic dehydrogenation reactions of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. It involves four main steps, with dissociative adsorption of ethane being identified as the rate-limiting step at elevated temperatures on Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts. The mechanism doesn't account for side reactions. The reaction order of ethane dehydrogenation is close to first order, but deviations occur due to partial occupation of active surface sites by ethene and hydrogen adsorption.

霍里图-波兰尼机制解释了烷烃在金属催化剂上的脱氢反应和烯烃的氢化反应。它涉及四个主要步骤，其中在铂和铂锡催化剂上，解离吸附的乙烷被确定为升高温度下的限速步骤。该机制不考虑副反应。乙烷脱氢反应的反应级数接近一级，但由于活性表面位点部分被乙烯和氢吸附，会出现偏差。
