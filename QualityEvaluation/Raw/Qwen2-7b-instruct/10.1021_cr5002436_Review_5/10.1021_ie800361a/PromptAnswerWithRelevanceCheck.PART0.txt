### Explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi Mechanism

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism explains the process of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, specifically detailing the four main steps:

1. **Dissociative adsorption of ethane** - The first step involves the breaking of the ethane molecule upon contact with the catalyst surface, releasing individual atoms or radicals.
2. **Adsorption of ethane** - Following dissociation, the resulting species are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface.
3. **Dehydrogenation of ethane** - This step involves the removal of hydrogen atoms from the adsorbed ethane species, leading to the formation of ethene.
4. **Desorption of ethene** - The final product, ethene, is released from the catalyst surface after the dehydrogenation process.

The ongoing debate around the mechanism focuses on the nature and extent of dehydrogenation of the C2Hx surface species involved in cleaving the CC bond. There is no consensus on how many hydrogen atoms are removed, and this can vary across different surfaces. Some studies suggest that less stable ethyl (C2H5) and ethylidene (CHCH3) species play key roles in CC bond cleavage, while more abundant surface species like ethylidyne and di-σ-bonded ethene do not directly participate in the primary reaction pathways but impact the observed rates by blocking sites.

Despite extensive research over nearly a century, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to these unresolved aspects.

### Analysis of Rate-Limiting Steps

Regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, there is no definitive answer. The rate of dehydrogenation can depend on factors such as the surface chemistry of the catalyst, the specific species involved in the reaction, and the conditions under which the reaction occurs.

For ethane dehydrogenation, dissociative adsorption of ethane is often identified as the rate-determining step. However, the mechanism's complexity and the interplay between different surface species make it challenging to pinpoint a single rate-limiting step.

### Controversy and Future Directions

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to attract scientific attention because of its fundamental importance in understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions. Despite the progress made in recent decades, including the identification of less stable species like ethyl and ethylidene that play critical roles in CC bond cleavage, there are still significant gaps in our understanding.

Further research could focus on developing more precise models that account for the dynamics of surface species and their interactions, aiming to clarify the rate-limiting steps and the underlying mechanisms. This would not only enhance our theoretical understanding but also pave the way for the design of more efficient catalysts for industrial applications.

### Summary

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism provides a foundational framework for understanding the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes over metal catalysts. Its ongoing relevance lies in the unresolved debates about the specifics of the dehydrogenation step, particularly concerning the nature of surface species involved and the rate-limiting steps. Continued investigation in this area promises insights that could significantly impact the development of catalytic technologies.

### 对霍里图-波兰尼机制的解释

霍里图-波兰尼机制通常用于描述烷烃的脱氢和烯烃的氢化过程中的催化剂作用。其四个主要步骤如下：

1. **乙烷的解离吸附** - 首先，乙烷分子在接触催化剂表面时分解，释放出原子或自由基。
2. **乙烷的吸附** - 在此之后，产生的物种被吸附到催化剂表面上。
3. **乙烷的脱氢** - 这一步涉及从吸附的乙烷物种中去除氢原子，导致乙烯的形成。
4. **乙烯的脱附** - 经过脱氢过程后，最终产物乙烯从催化剂表面释放出来。

对于CC键断裂的关键步骤，关于表面物种的脱氢程度存在争议。不同的表面可能有不同的结果。一些研究表明，更不稳定的乙基（C2H5）和乙基二烯（CHCH3）物种在CC键断裂中起关键作用，而通常在乙稀吸附期间观察到的更丰富的表面物种（例如乙基二烯和σ键联合乙稀）并不直接参与主要反应途径，而是通过阻塞位点影响观测到的速率。

尽管该机制在近一个世纪的研究中仍是一个科学关注的焦点，但其复杂性及其对不同表面物种的依赖使得确定单一的决定速率步骤变得困难。

### 决定速率步骤的分析

霍里图-波兰尼机制中哪个步骤被认为是决定速率的步骤没有明确的答案。脱氢速率可以取决于催化剂的表面化学、反应涉及的具体物种以及反应发生的条件。

对于乙烷脱氢，解离吸附的乙烷常常被认为是决定速率的步骤。然而，由于机制的复杂性和表面物种之间的相互作用，确定单一决定速率步骤仍然具有挑战性。

### 争议与未来方向

霍里图-波兰尼机制继续吸引科学研究的关注，因为它在理解脱氢和氢化反应的基本原理方面具有基础性的重要性。尽管近年来在这一领域取得了进展，包括识别出参与CC键断裂的关键较不稳定物种如乙基和乙基二烯，但仍存在重要的知识空白。

进一步的研究可以集中在开发更精确的模型上，这些模型能够考虑表面物种的动力学及其相互作用，以澄清决定速率的步骤和底层机制。这不仅会增强我们的理论理解，而且将为工业应用设计更高效的催化剂铺平道路。

### 总结

霍里图-波兰尼机制提供了一个基础框架，用于理解金属催化剂上的脱氢和氢化过程。其持续的相关性在于对脱氢步骤具体细节的争议，特别是关于表面物种的性质和决定速率步骤的问题。对这一领域的持续研究有望带来重要见解，从而显著影响催化技术的发展。

### Explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi Mechanism

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is commonly applied to describe the dehydrogenation of alkanes and the hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. It comprises four main steps:
1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane.
2. Formation of an adsorbed intermediate.
3. Transformation of the intermediate.
4. Desorption of the product.

Controversy surrounds which step is rate-limiting. While dissociative adsorption is often identified as the rate-determining step, this mechanism neglects side reactions. Studies on ethane hydrogenolysis suggest that C2Hx or C1Hy adsorbed species undergo further reactions, leading to the cleavage of the CC bond. The nature of the adsorbed species involved in the primary reaction pathways is debated, with some suggesting less stable ethyl (C2H5) and ethylidene (CHCH3) species are more directly involved than typically observed through spectroscopic methods.

### Reasons for Scientific Interest and Controversy

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its limitations in accounting for side reactions and the ongoing debate over which step governs the reaction rate. The mechanism's simplification of the complex surface chemistry occurring during dehydrogenation reactions leads to discrepancies with observed kinetic behaviors, particularly concerning the role of adsorbed species in the reaction pathway.

### Practical Implications

Understanding the mechanism's limitations and the precise roles of various adsorbed species can inform the development of more efficient catalysts and processes. The mechanism's relevance extends beyond theoretical interest, influencing the design of industrial catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions to enhance yield and efficiency.

### Alternative Interpretations

Alternative explanations for the observed behavior in catalyst deactivation and product formation involve the influence of hydrogen on maintaining the catalyst's reduced state, preventing the formation of coke precursors, and facilitating the rehydrogenation of strongly dehydrogenated species. The role of carbon dioxide in reducing deactivation rates and promoting methane formation suggests its impact on altering the surface properties and acid-base characteristics of the catalyst.

### Conclusion

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism provides a foundational understanding of dehydrogenation reactions, yet its limitations highlight the need for further research into the complex surface chemistry and reaction dynamics involved. The ongoing debate and exploration of alternative interpretations underscore the mechanism's continued relevance and the potential for innovation in catalysis and chemical processing technologies.

### 解释霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制

霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制通常被用来描述烷烃的脱氢和烯烃的氢化过程。其主要步骤包括：
1. 烷烃的离解吸附。
2. 形成吸附中间体。
3. 转换中间体。
4. 产品脱附。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的，存在争议。虽然离解吸附经常被认为是决定性步骤，但该机制忽略了副反应。对乙烷氢化研究发现，C2Hx或C1Hy吸附物种经历进一步反应，导致CC键断裂。参与初级反应途径的具体吸附物种的性质存在争议，一些研究表明，更不稳定的乙基（C2H5）和乙基二烯（CHCH3）物种可能比通过光谱方法通常观察到的那样直接参与反应路径。

### 科学兴趣与争议的原因

尽管近一个世纪的研究，霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣的焦点，原因在于其在描述表面化学的复杂性方面存在局限性以及关于哪一步是决定性步骤的争论。机制简化了脱氢反应过程中发生的复杂表面化学，导致与观察到的动态行为之间的矛盾，特别是关于吸附物种在反应路径中的作用的讨论。

### 实际影响

理解机制的局限性和各种吸附物种的确切作用可以指导催化剂的发展和过程优化。机制的理论意义超越了纯粹的兴趣，影响了催化剂设计和反应条件优化以提高产率和效率的技术开发。

### 替代解释

对于催化剂失活和产物形成观察到的行为的替代解释涉及氢维持催化剂还原状态的作用、防止形成焦炭前体，并促进强脱氢物种的再氢化。二氧化碳在降低失活速率和促进甲烷形成的角色表明它对催化剂表面特性和酸碱特性的影响。

### 结论

霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制为脱氢反应提供了一个基础理解，但其局限性强调了需要进一步研究复杂的表面化学和反应动力学的重要性。持续的争论和对替代解释的探索强调了机制的持续相关性和催化和化学加工技术创新的可能性。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism serves as a fundamental framework for understanding dehydrogenation reactions of alkanes and hydrogenation reactions of alkenes over metal catalysts. This mechanism typically comprises four key steps that involve dissociative adsorption of the alkane, subsequent dehydrogenation, hydrogenation of the resulting alkene, and finally, the desorption of the product. There is a consensus around the mechanism's overall structure, but the specific details of the rate-limiting step remain a subject of debate. The precise degree of dehydrogenation of C2Hx surface species, which play a crucial role in cleaving the CC bond, varies across different surfaces and is not universally agreed upon. Moreover, the number of hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed C2Hx molecule that participate in CC bond cleavage can differ from one surface to another. Cortright et al.'s research (31) using a combination of reaction kinetics, calorimetry, spectroscopy, and quantum chemical methods provides insights into the primary reaction pathways for CC bond cleavage.
