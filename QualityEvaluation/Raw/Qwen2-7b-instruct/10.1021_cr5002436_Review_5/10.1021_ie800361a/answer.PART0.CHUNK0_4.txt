[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts."
[2] "For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are:(1) (2) (3) (4)"
[3] "Although there is general agreement about the overall mechanism of ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt and other transition metals, there is no agreement on the degree of dehydrogenation of the C2Hx surface species that are important in the CC bond scission."
[4] "It has further been reported that the number of hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed C2Hx in which CC bond cleaves may differ from one surface to another."
[5] "Interestingly, Cortright et al. (31) studied ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt by a combination of reaction kinetics, microcalorimetry, and spectroscopic and quantum chemical studies and concluded that the primary reaction pathways for cleavage of the CC bond take place through less stable ethyl (C2H5) and ethylidene (CHCH3) species not generally observed by spectroscopic methods, while the more abundant surface species usually observed during ethene adsorption (e.g., ethylidyne and di-σ-bonded ethene) are not directly involved in the primary reaction pathways, but affect the observed kinetic rates through blocking of sites."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism serves as a fundamental framework for understanding dehydrogenation reactions of alkanes and hydrogenation reactions of alkenes over metal catalysts. This mechanism typically comprises four key steps that involve dissociative adsorption of the alkane, subsequent dehydrogenation, hydrogenation of the resulting alkene, and finally, the desorption of the product. There is a consensus around the mechanism's overall structure, but the specific details of the rate-limiting step remain a subject of debate. The precise degree of dehydrogenation of C2Hx surface species, which play a crucial role in cleaving the CC bond, varies across different surfaces and is not universally agreed upon. Moreover, the number of hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed C2Hx molecule that participate in CC bond cleavage can differ from one surface to another. Cortright et al.'s research (31) using a combination of reaction kinetics, calorimetry, spectroscopy, and quantum chemical methods provides insights into the primary reaction pathways for CC bond cleavage. These pathways occur through less stable ethyl (C2H5) and ethylidene (CHCH3) species, which are not typically observed by spectroscopic techniques. More common surface species, such as ethylidyne and di-σ-bonded ethene, do not directly participate in the primary reaction pathways but impact the observed kinetic rates by blocking active sites.

霍里图-波兰尼机制通常被用来描述在金属催化剂上烷烃脱氢和烯烃加氢的反应。这个机制通常包括四个关键步骤，涉及烷烃的离解吸附、随后的脱氢、烯烃的氢化以及最终产物的脱附。尽管关于机制的整体结构存在共识，但决定性步骤的具体细节仍然是争论的焦点。C2Hx表面物种进行CC键断裂的确切程度因表面不同而异，并且没有得到普遍认可。此外，参与CC键断裂的吸附C2Hx分子中的氢原子数量可能在不同的表面上有所不同。Cortright等人的研究（31）通过结合反应动力学、热容量测量、光谱学和量子化学方法，提供了关于CC键断裂的主要反应途径的见解。这些途径发生在通常无法通过光谱技术观察到的较不稳定的乙基（C2H5）和乙基二烯（CHCH3）物种中。更常见的表面物种，如乙基炔和双-σ-键连乙烯，虽然它们不是直接参与主要反应途径，但通过阻塞活性位点影响了观察到的动力学速率。
