The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism explains catalytic dehydrogenation reactions and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. It involves four main steps. Dissociative adsorption of ethane is considered the rate-limiting step at high temperatures. However, the mechanism does not consider side reactions. There is a debate over which step is truly rate-limiting, with differing reports on the level of dehydrogenation of C2Hx surface species involved in CC bond scission. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

霍里图-波兰尼机制解释了烷烃的脱氢反应和烯烃的氢化反应在金属催化剂上的催化作用。它涉及四个主要步骤。在高温下，解离吸附乙烷被认为是决定性的步骤。然而，该机制并未考虑副反应。关于参与CC键断裂的C2Hx表面物种的脱氢程度存在争议，不同报告对这一过程的看法不一。尽管这一机制已经经过近一个世纪的研究，但它仍然是科学界关注和争论的热点。
