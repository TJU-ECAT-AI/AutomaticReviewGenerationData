[5] "At room temperature, ethylidyne species were essentially the only species observed on the surface of Pt/SiO2, corresponding to an adsorption heat of 157 kJ/mol."
[6] "The addition of tin to platinum decreases the extent of formation of ethylidyne species and thereby promotes the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species on Pt at room temperature."
[7] "Quantum calculations employing DFT indicate that there is electron transfer from tin to platinum. These calculations show that the interaction of ethylidyne species with 3-fold hollow sites composed of three adjacent Pt atoms is significantly weakened by the presence of neighboring Sn atoms, while the interaction of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species with atop sites and bridge sites composed of adjacent Pt atoms are only slightly weakened by the presence of neighboring Sn atoms."

Answer:

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a theoretical framework that explains the process of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. This mechanism is characterized by four primary steps:

1. **Adsorption**: Hydrogen molecules (H2) attach to the surface of a catalyst, often involving a complex interplay between the hydrogen and the metal surface.

2. **Activation**: Once adsorbed, the hydrogen molecules undergo activation, which involves breaking the hydrogen-hydrogen bonds to form a reactive intermediate, typically a hydrogen atom (H) and a hydrogen radical (H*).

3. **Recombination**: The hydrogen atom and hydrogen radical then recombine to form a hydrogen molecule again, but this time it is more reactive due to the activation process.

4. **Desorption**: The newly formed hydrogen molecule then desorbs from the catalyst surface, leaving behind the original substrate molecule with a reduced number of hydrogen atoms.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism revolves around the adsorption and activation stages. Some researchers argue that the rate-limiting step is the adsorption of hydrogen molecules, as this process determines how quickly the substrate molecules can come into contact with the catalyst. Others believe that the activation stage is the bottleneck, as the transformation of hydrogen molecules into reactive intermediates can be a slow process.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for several reasons:

- **Complexity of Catalytic Surfaces**: The nature of metal surfaces and their interactions with molecules can be highly complex, leading to a multitude of possible pathways and mechanisms that are not yet fully understood.

- **Variability of Catalysts**: Different catalyst materials and compositions can significantly influence the kinetics and efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions, making it challenging to generalize the mechanism across various systems.

- **Technological Applications**: Understanding the mechanism can lead to improvements in industrial processes, such as refining crude oil and producing ammonia, which are critical to global energy and agricultural needs.

- **Environmental Relevance**: The ability to control dehydrogenation reactions could have implications for sustainable energy production, including the conversion of biomass to biofuels and the synthesis of hydrogen as a clean energy source.

- **Fundamental Science**: The mechanism provides insights into the fundamental principles of catalysis, which can inform the development of new catalysts and reaction pathways.

In conclusion, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to be a subject of scientific inquiry due to its relevance in both practical applications and fundamental understanding of catalytic processes.

回答：

霍里图-波兰尼机制是解释催化脱氢反应过程的理论框架。该机制由四个主要步骤组成：

1. **吸附**：氢分子（H2）附着在催化剂表面，涉及氢和金属表面之间的复杂相互作用。

2. **激活**：吸附后，氢分子经历激活，即断裂氢-氢键形成活性中间体，通常是氢原子（H）和氢自由基（H*）。

3. **再组合**：氢原子和氢自由基然后重新结合形成一个更活泼的氢分子，但这一次它是经过激活的。

4. **脱附**：新形成的氢分子随后从催化剂表面脱附，留下原始的基质分子，其氢原子数量减少。

关于霍里图-波兰尼机制中哪一步被认为是速率限制性步骤的争论，集中在吸附和激活阶段。一些研究人员认为，速率限制性步骤是氢分子的吸附，因为这个过程决定了基质分子与催化剂接触的速度。其他人则认为是激活阶段，因为将氢分子转化为活性中间体的过程可能非常缓慢。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学界关注的热点和争议点，原因如下：

- **催化剂表面的复杂性**：金属表面及其与分子的相互作用可以非常复杂，导致可能的路径和机制的多种可能性，这些尚未完全理解。

- **催化剂的多样性**：不同的催化剂材料和组成可以显著影响脱氢反应的速率和效率，使得在各种系统中一般化机制变得具有挑战性。

- **技术应用**：理解机制可以提高工业过程，如原油精炼和氨生产，这些对于全球能源和农业需求至关重要。

- **环境相关性**：控制脱氢反应的能力可能对可持续能源生产有影响，包括生物质到生物燃料的转换和氢气作为清洁能源来源的合成。

- **基础科学**：该机制提供了理解催化过程的基本原则的见解，这可以指导新型催化剂和反应途径的发展。

总之，由于其在实际应用和基本理解催化过程方面的重要性，霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学探究的对象。

[1] "The nature of the adsorbed species that form on Pt after exposure to ethylene is dependent on the temperature and the structure of the surface.24,33 On our 6 wt % Pt/SiO2 catalyst, π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species were formed upon exposure to ethylene at temperatures below 233 K, and ethylidyne species began to form at temperatures near 263 K (see Figure 7)."

In particular, it is well established that the surface of Pt/Sn alloy particles can be enriched with Sn, and so it is possible that our 3Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst on which the formation of ethylidyne species is suppressed at room temperature has few adjacent 3-fold Pt sites."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, which explains catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, comprises four main steps. First, the substrate molecule binds to the active site of the catalyst, often involving a hydrogen atom being removed (dehydrogenation). Second, the activated substrate undergoes a rearrangement step, where the remaining atoms are reorganized to form a more reactive intermediate. Third, the intermediate undergoes a cleavage step, breaking down into products. Lastly, the products are released from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is primarily centered on the first step of dehydrogenation. Some researchers argue that the dehydrogenation step is the slowest, while others believe that the activation of the substrate for dehydrogenation might be the rate-limiting step. This uncertainty stems from the complexity of the catalytic process and the various factors influencing reaction kinetics.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it continues to evolve with advancements in catalysis research. New insights into the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions could lead to the development of more efficient catalysts for industrial applications, such as the production of alcohols from hydrocarbons. The mechanism's dynamic nature and the interplay between the various steps involved in dehydrogenation reactions make it a subject of ongoing investigation in the field of chemical engineering and catalysis.

关于哪一步是决定性的争论主要集中在第一步的脱氢上。一些研究人员认为脱氢步骤是缓慢的，而其他人则认为激活基质以进行脱氢可能是决定性的步骤。这种不确定性源于催化过程的复杂性以及影响反应动力学的各种因素。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但霍里图-波拉尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它在催化研究中不断演变。对脱氢反应机制的新洞察可能导致开发更高效的催化剂用于工业应用，例如从烃类生产醇。机制的动态性质及其涉及的各个步骤之间的相互作用使它成为化学工程和催化领域持续调查的主题。

Answer: 

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the molecule, involving breaking of chemical bonds.
3. Reaction between activated molecules or between an activated molecule and another reactant.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

Regarding the ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting, it varies depending on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst properties. The adsorption step is often considered the rate-limiting step due to the need for reactants to effectively attach to the catalyst surface. However, the activation step, which requires energy input to break chemical bonds, is also crucial and can limit the reaction rate. The reaction step itself can be rate-limiting if the catalyst activity is low or the reaction is slow. Lastly, the desorption step can be rate-limiting if products hinder the release from the surface, potentially forming a blocking layer.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because it helps explain the complex interplay between adsorption, activation, and reaction kinetics on catalyst surfaces. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and improving reaction efficiency in industrial applications. Despite advances in computational methods and experimental techniques, there is still much to learn about how catalysts interact with reactants and products, especially under various operating conditions. This knowledge gap fuels ongoing research to refine and innovate catalytic processes.
