[1] "The addition of tin to platinum decreases the extent of formation of ethylidyne species and thereby promotes the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species on Pt at room temperature."
[2] "Adsorption of ethylene at temperatures from 173 to 233 K leads to the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species on the surface of the Pt/SiO2 catalyst."
[3] "At room temperature, ethylidyne species were essentially the only species observed on the surface of Pt/SiO2, corresponding to an adsorption heat of 157 kJ/mol."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the molecule by breaking bonds, (3) migration of activated species to a reaction site, and (4) decomposition of the activated molecule into products. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often centers on the activation step, as it involves the highest energy barrier and requires substantial activation energy. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the exact nature of the intermediates, the precise pathway of activation, and the dynamics of the reaction process are still not fully understood. The mechanism's complexity and the challenges in experimental observation contribute to its continued relevance in catalysis research.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：（1）反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附，（2）通过断裂化学键激活分子，（3）活化物种迁移到反应位点，（4）活化分子分解为产物。关于哪个步骤被认为是决定性的，争论往往集中在激活步骤上，因为它涉及最高的能量壁垒，并需要大量的活化能。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但机制仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为中间体的确切性质、激活过程的精确路径以及反应过程的动力学仍不完全清楚。机制的复杂性和实验观察的挑战继续使其在催化研究中保持相关性。
