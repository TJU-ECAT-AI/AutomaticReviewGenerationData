[1] "The nature of the adsorbed species that form on Pt after exposure to ethylene is dependent on the temperature and the structure of the surface.24,33"
[2] "On our 6 wt % Pt/SiO2 catalyst, π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species were formed upon exposure to ethylene at temperatures below 233 K, and ethylidyne species began to form at temperatures near 263 K (see Figure 7)."
[3] "Quantum calculations employing DFT indicate that there is electron transfer from tin to platinum. These calculations show that the interaction of ethylidyne species with 3-fold hollow sites composed of three adjacent Pt atoms is significantly weakened by the presence of neighboring Sn atoms, while the interaction of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species with atop sites and bridge sites composed of adjacent Pt atoms are only slightly weakened by the presence of neighboring Sn atoms."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a complex process involving four main steps. It begins with the adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule on the catalyst surface, followed by the activation of the molecule through the breaking of a bond, typically a hydrogen-hydrocarbon bond. The next step is the migration of the activated molecule to a location where it can react further, often facilitated by the catalyst's structure. Finally, the reaction proceeds with the formation of products and the release of heat. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the intricate interplay between the steps and the influence of various factors such as catalyst composition, temperature, and pressure. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the reactions and the dynamic nature of the catalyst surface. The presence of tin on platinum surfaces affects the electronic structure of the platinum, leading to weakened interactions with ethylidyne species but only slightly weakened interactions with π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species. This phenomenon adds to the complexity of understanding the mechanism and highlights the need for further research to clarify the precise roles of each step and the factors influencing their rates.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应是一个复杂的过程，涉及四个主要步骤。首先是在催化剂表面吸附烃分子，随后通过断开键，通常是氢-烃键的断裂，实现分子的活化。接着是活化后的分子在催化剂结构的协助下迁移至可以进一步反应的位置。最后，反应继续进行，形成产物并释放热量。关于哪个步骤被认为是决定性的，争论源于步骤之间的复杂交互以及各种因素的影响，如催化剂组成、温度和压力等。尽管研究已经持续了一个世纪，但该机制仍然受到科学界的兴趣和争议，原因在于反应的复杂性和催化剂表面的动态性。锡在铂表面上的存在影响了铂的电子结构，导致与乙炔基物种的相互作用显著减弱，而对π键和双σ键乙烯物种的相互作用仅轻微减弱。这一现象增加了理解机制的复杂性，并强调了进一步研究以澄清每个步骤的确切作用及其速率影响的重要性。
