Abstract 
The conversion of di-tr bonded ethylene (-CHz-CH2-) to ethylidyne (=CCH 3) on the Pt(lll) crystal surface was 
monitored with infrared-visible sum frequency generation (SFG) in the u(CH) frequency range. The conversion began 
around 255 K and involved a third stable species that is neither di-o- bonded ethylene nor ethylidyne. This species 
manifested itself as a peak at 2957 cm- l in the vibrational spectrum. Furthermore, we found the same species present during 
the conversion of vinyl iodide to ethylidyne on Pt(lll). The 2957 cm -1 feature has been assigned to the CH 3 asymmetric 
stretch of ethylidene and/or ethyl.

I. Introduction 
When ethylene is chemisorbed on the (111) crys- 
tal face of platinum at temperatures in the range of 
120-240 K, di-o- bonded ethylene (-CH2CH2-) 
forms [1-3]. Annealing this species above 280 K 
causes ethylidyne (=---CCH 
3) to form [4]. Ethylidyne 
is adsorbed in an fcc threefold hollow site with its

C-C axis perpendicular to the surface. Its structure 
and the relocation of platinum atoms around the site 
have been reliably determined by tensor LEED sur- 
face crystallography [5]. The transformation of di-o- 
bonded ethylene to ethylidyne is shown schemati- 
cally in Fig. 1. The purpose of this paper is to 
investigate the mechanism of this transformation by 
spectroscopic identification of possible intermediate 
species. To this end we carried out vibrational spec- 
troscopy studies, using the technique of optical sum 
frequency generation (SFG) on the (111) crystal face 
of platinum in the temperature range of 202-352 K.

mation of a variety of intermediates have been pro-

posed in the literature. These intermediates include 
ethyl 
groups 
(CH3-CH2-) 
[6], 
vinyl 
groups 
(CH2=CH-) [7,8], ethylidene (-CH-CH 3) [9,10], 
and vinylidene (=C=CH2) [11,12]. Because direct 
spectroscopic evidence for any of these intermediates 
has been elusive, it has been widely assumed that the 
rate limiting step for this reaction is either the break- 
ing of the first CH bond in the di-o" bonded species 
to form vinyl [7,8] or the isomerization of the ad- 
sorbed di-o- bonded species to ethylidene [9,10]. 
Although direct spectroscopic evidence has been 
lacking, some experimental and theoretical studies 
have pointed to the likelihood of a mechanism in- 
volving an ethylidene intermediate. Windham and 
Koel have shown spectroscopic evidence for ethyli- 
dene formation on Pt(lll) when ethylene is coad- 
sorbed with 0.12 monolayers of potassium at 100 K 
and then annealed to 300 K [10]. Evidence for an 
ethylidene species in the potassium promoted system 
has been further supported by Zhou et al. using 
secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) [13]. Some 
theoretical evidence has also pointed to ethylidene as 
a possible reaction intermediate. Carter and Koel 
have made equilibrium thermodynamic estimates of 
the energetics of the transformation of di-o" bonded 
ethylene to ethylidyne [9]. These estimates support a 
mechanism involving ethylidene. However, it should 
be noted that other theoretical studies did not support 
this conclusion [12,14]. In fact some experimental 
evidence points to vinyl intermediates [7,8]. 
In the present work we utilize infrared-visible 
sum frequency generation to study the v(CH) por- 
tion of the vibrational spectrum (2700-3100 cm-1). 
SFG is a powerful technique for surface vibrational 
spectroscopy because it is both surface specific and 
capable of providing resolution on the order of 10 
cm 1 or less. The u(CH) portion of the vibrational 
spectrum is extremely valuable because of the fre- 
quent difficulty in interpreting the complex structure 
often found in the 900-1500 cm ~ region of the 
spectrum. 
SFG has been described in great detail in the 
literature [15-17]. Briefly, it is a second-order non- 
linear optical process in which an infrared beam is 
combined with a visible beam to generate a sum- 
frequency output. The process is only allowed (in the 
dipole approximation) in a medium without inver- 
sion symmetry. The fcc lattice in the bulk of plat- 
inum is centrosymmetric and, therefore, in the case 
of an organic monolayer adsorbed on Pt(lll) the 
SFG signal may be dominated by the contribution 
from the interface between the metal and vacuum. 
As the IR beam is tuned through vibrational reso- 
nances of surface species the effective surface non- 
linear susceptibility Xs 
~2) is resonantly enhanced. The 
SFG signal is proportional to the absolute square of 
Xs 
~2) and, hence, a vibrational spectrum of the surface 
species is detected. Formally we can write:

nonresonant nonlinear susceptibility, resonant non- 
linear susceptibility, strength of the qth vibrational 
mode, qth vibrational mode, infrared laser fre- 
quency, and the damping constant of the qth vibra- 
tional mode respectively. 
Our results indicate the presence of a third species 
present on the Pt(lll) surface during the conversion 
of di-o" bonded ethylene to ethylidyne. This species 
gave rise to a vibrational feature which was observed 
only during the reaction and has been assigned to the 
CH 3 asymmetric stretch of ethylidene and/or ethyl. 
2. Experimental 
All experiments were carried out in an ultra high 
vacuum chamber pumped with a turbo pump and an 
ion pump, The chamber had a base pressure of less 
than 1 X 10 10 Torr and was equipped with a Varian 
retarding field analyzer (RFA) for Auger and LEED, 
a high resolution electron energy loss spectrometer 
(HREELS), a VG SX300 mass spectrometer, and 
CaF 
2 windows to allow the passage of infrared and 
visible laser beams. The Pt(l11) crystal used in this 
experiment was spot welded onto the manipulator

with platinum wires and was capable of being resis- 
tively heated to above 1200 K and cooled with liquid 
N 2 to 115 K. Temperature was measured with a 
chromel-alumel thermocouple which was positioned 
on the edge of the crystal. The sample itself was cut, 
polished, and then cleaned in UHV following the 
standard procedures. 
A 20 picosecond passive, active mode-locked 
Nd : YAG laser with a maximum output energy of 50 
mJ/pulse at 1064 nm was used to perform the SFG. 
A portion of the beam was frequency doubled to 532 
nm and used as the visible portion of this spec- 
troscopy. The rest of the light was sent to a LiNbO 3 
optical parametric generator/amplifier arm where it 
could be frequency tuned from 2650-3900 cm -1. 
The two beams were then focused concentrically 
onto the Pt(lll) sample. Both the green and IR light 
used in this experiment were p-polarized such that 
their electric fields had components perpendicular to 
the surface of the platinum crystal. The sum fre- 
quency photons generated from the crystal surface 
were detected via a photomultiplier tube and the 
signal was stored on a microcomputer. Fig. 2 is a 
schematic diagram of the instrumentation. 
In this experiment 4 L of ethylene (Matheson, 
C.P. grade) were dosed onto clean Pt(lll) at 202 K. 
The crystal was cooled to 120 K at which point an 
SFG spectrum was taken. The crystal was then an- 
nealed to successively higher temperatures for peri- 
ods of 60 s after which the crystal was allowed to 
cool to 120 K. At the conclusion of each such 
process an SFG scan was taken at 120 K. Additional 
spectra of di-cr bonded ethylene on Pt(lll), ethyli- 
dyne on Pt(lll), and vinyl iodide (99% pure, Pfaltz 
and Bauer) on Pt(lll) were taken for comparison. 
All spectra presented in this study represent raw 
data.

K, a procedure which completely decomposes 
chemisorbed ethylene to ethylidyne. The spectrum 
shows only one major feature at 2885 cm ~ (unfitted 
value) representing the CH 3 symmetric stretch of 
ethylidyne. A second much smaller feature just under 
2800 cm -~ has been assigned to a Fermi resonance 
with an asymmetric bending mode [18]. The nonres- 
onant background signal immediately beyond the 
peak frequency falls below its base line and then 
returns. This is the interference pattern formed from 
the interplay between the nonresonant background 
signal (in this case due primarily to the platinum 
surface) and the resonant signal from the ethylidyne 
species. Because of this interaction, the peak of the 
resonant feature comes at a slightly lower frequency 
than would otherwise be expected. Signal in a sum 
frequency experiment is proportional to the square of 
Eq. (1); therefore, fitting the data by I X (2) 12 yields 
the actual resonant frequency of the main peak in 
Fig. 3a at 2886 cm-1. All further peaks in this paper 
have been identified by their fitted value for the 
resonant frequency. 
Fig. 3b is a scan of di-o" bonded ethylene that has 
been adsorbed on Pt(lll) at 202 K and then cooled 
to 120 K before taking the spectrum. The singular 
feature in this spectrum is at 2904 cm -~ and has 
been assigned to a CH 2 symmetric stretch [1-3]. 
From reflection-adsorption infrared spectroscopy 
(RAIRS) studies, Hoffman et al. have concluded that 
the CH 2 asymmetric stretch is also incorporated 
under this peak [19]. 
Fig. 4 shows a series of eight spectra of di-o" 
bonded ethylene annealed to successively higher 
temperature. During the annealing process di-o" 
bonded ethylene is converted to ethylidyne. Upon 
annealing di-o" bonded ethylene to 243 K for 60 s 
the CHe symmetric stretch peak shifts to 2906 cm-1 
and sharpens up, but the spectrum remains otherwise 
unchanged from the spectrum in Fig. 3b. The first 
sign of significant change begins as the sample is 
annealed to 257 K. There is a definite decrease in 
intensity of the CH 2 symmetric stretch peak and a 
new feature begins to grow in around 2953 cm -~. 
Further, a shoulder which is assigned to the CH 3 
symmetric stretch of ethylidyne develops on the low 
frequency side of the CH2 peak. 
The ethylidyne shoulder feature increases slightly 
as the sample is annealed to 265 K. The drop off in 
intensity of the CH 2 peak continues as its frequency 
shifts to 2916 cm -a 
The high frequency feature 
shifts to 2957 cm -~ and continues to grow. Anneal- 
ing to 273 K for 60 s makes the CH 3 symmetric 
stretch at 2889 cm ~ of the growing ethylidyne 
resonance clearly visible. The CH 2 symmetric stretch 
peak which has now shifted to 2918 cm ~ has 
decayed substantially while the high frequency fea- 
ture continues to grow. At 281 K the CH 2 symmetric 
stretch has almost completely disappeared. The CH 3 
symmetric stretch peak of ethylidyne continues to 
increase in intensity and the 2957 cm 1 stretch peak 
starts to decrease. 
Annealing to 288 K shows continued growth of 
the ethylidyne peak while the high frequency feature 
has nearly disappeared. Further annealing to 296 K 
and then 352 K leaves only the CH 3 symmetric 
stretch of ethylidyne.

4. Discussion 
The CH stretch portion of the vibrational spec- 
trum shows a clear progression from di-cr bonded 
ethylene to ethylidyne with the appearance of a high 
frequency feature at 2957 cm-~ that is only present 
during the transition (Fig. 4). The primary objective 
of this discussion is to identify this feature. There are 
several candidates for this species, including ethyl, 
ethylidene, vinyl, and vinylidene. A possible asym- 
metric stretch mode and a Fermi resonance of both 
di-o- bonded ethylene and ethylidyne must also be 
considered. 
The possibility that the high frequency feature is a 
Fermi resonance can be discounted because its signal 
would have to grow and attenuate in concert with 
either the CH 2 or CH3 symmetric stretch resonance. 
This is not the case for either the CH 2 or CH 3 mode. 
The 2957 cm -~ peak remains until after the CH 2 
symmetric stretch intensity is completely gone and 
actually attenuates as the CH 3 symmetric stretch 
grows. Further, neither the di-o" bonded ethylene nor 
the ethylidyne species when present alone on the 
surface have Fermi resonances in the 2957 cm -1 
range. 
The high frequency feature in Fig. 4 is also 
unlikely to be from an asymmetric stretch mode. 
Although asymmetric stretches of CH 3 species on 
Pt(111) are found in this region of the spectrum, they 
are mostly forbidden in the ethylidyne geometry 
because of the surface dipole selection rule, which 
requires the dynamic dipole moment of the species 
to have some component normal to the surface. In 
this case (with the C-C bond axis normal to the 
surface) the asymmetric stretch would be in plane 
with the surface and would not appear in this spec- 
troscopy. In fact the asymmetric stretch feature is not 
observed in the pure ethylidyne spectrum (Fig. 3a). 
It also cannot be argued that the high frequency 
feature is from the CH 2 asymmetric stretch of di-o" 
bonded ethylene. This is because the high frequency 
peak is clearly still present after the CH 2 symmetric 
stretch signal has completely vanished. For this fea- 
ture to be the CH 2 asymmetric stretch, there would 
have to be a conformation of di-o- bonded ethylene 
that would only allow the asymmetric stretch to be 
observed, but not the symmetric one. It is extremely 
difficult to envision such a conformation of di-o- 
bonded ethylene on Pt(111). This leads to the con- 
clusion that the high frequency stretch seen during 
the conversion is due to a species that is neither di-o" 
bonded ethylene nor ethylidyne, but rather a third 
species that is only present on the surface during the 
conversion of the former into the latter. 
Both a vinyl group (-CH=CH 2) and vinylidene 
group (=C=CH 2) can be ruled out as a candidate 
for the 2957 cm -1 feature. Infrared and Raman 
spectra of vinyl and vinylidene moieties in osmium 
clusters show that the CH 2 symmetric and asymmet- 
ric stretches of these moieties occur too high (2998, 
3052 cm -1 for vinyl and 2990, 3052 cm -1 for 
vinylidene) to account for this feature and the very 
weak CH stretch of vinyl is too low (2920 cm -1) 
[20]. Further, a recent RAIRS study by Zaera et al. 
has shown that vinyl moieties decompose to acety- 
lene and vinylidene by 140 K instead of directly 
converting to ethylidyne [21]. In the RAIRS study 
heating above 200 K caused all spectroscopic fea- 
tures to disappear. This led Zaera to conclude that 
T-bonded ethylene must be formed around this tem- 
perature. The T-bonded ethylene would have its 
dynamic dipole parallel to the surface and would 
therefore not be seen by infrared spectroscopy. Zaera 
accounted for the change in C/H stoichiometry from 
C2H 3 tO C2H 4 by proposing either adsorption of H 2 
from the background or the evolution of surface 
hydrogen from the formation of a minor decomposi- 
tion product. Upon heating this system above 300 K 
ethylidyne features were observed. 
We have also investigated the thermal evolution 
of the vinyl iodide on Pt(lll) system and the spectra 
are shown in Fig. 5. The bottom spectrum shows 10 
L of vinyl iodide dosed on Pt(lll) at 132 K. At this 
temperature some of the C-I bonds are broken and 
vinyl moieties are direCtly adsorbed on the platinum 
surface [8]. There are three peaks (2995, 3033, and 
3068 cm -1 ) observed for vinyl iodide adsorbed on 
Pt(lll) at 132 K. The 2995 cm -1 resonance can be 
assigned to the CH 2 symmetric stretch of a mixed 
sp2/sp 3 hybridized species of either vinyl or vinyli- 
dene [20]. The 3068 cm-1 peak may be due to the 
CH 2 asymmetric stretch of intact vinyl iodide [8]. 
The 3033 cm 1 feature, however, is harder to iden- 
tify because it does not correspond well with any 
frequency from the inorganic cluster models of 
vinylidene, vinyl, or acetylene [20,22]. Because there

is significant dehydrogenation just above 132 K [21], 
an additional surface species or a Fermi resonance 
may already be present at this temperature. At any 
rate all of the peaks in this spectrum come at too 
high of a frequency to account for the 2957 cm 
feature seen in the di-o" bonded ethylene to ethyli- 
dyne transition. 
Upon annealing the vinyl iodide/Pt(lll) system 
to 285 and 295 K (middle spectra in Fig. 5) there is 
only one peak present which is nearly at the same 
position as the high frequency feature seen during 
the transition of di-o" bonded ethylene to ethylidyne 
in Fig. 4. Upon further heating to 406 K the CH 3 
symmetric stretch resonance of ethylidyne is seen at 
2878 cm ] (top spectra in Fig. 5). This seems to 
suggest that while vinyl is not the species responsi- 
ble for the high frequency feature observed in the 
di-o- bonded ethylene to ethylidyne conversion, vinyl 
decomposes through the same 
intermediate(s) in its 
transformation to ethylidyne as is found by directly 
dosing and then annealing ethylene. This is quite 
reasonable in light of the finding by Zaera that vinyl 
converts to "n-bonded ethylene before converting to 
ethylidyne [21]. 
We assign the 2957 cm ~ feature to the CH 3 
asymmetric stretch mode of ethylidene and/or ethyl. 
There is a preponderance of evidence which supports 
this assignment. In a RAIRS study of deuterated and 
nondeuterated ethyl iodide on Pt(11 l) Hoffman et al. 
have shown that ethyl groups give rise to three 
features in the CH stretch region at 2857, 2914, and 
2952 cm -1. The highest frequency feature has been 
assigned to the CH 3 asymmetric stretch of the termi- 
nal methyl group [19]. We have repeated this work 
using our SFG system and obtained the same results. 
Hoffman et al. have shown that ethyl groups may 
adopt either an upright or flat geometry on the (111) 
surface of platinum. It is in the latter case that the 
CH 3 asymmetric stretch is most prominent in their 
vibrational spectra (dipole selection rule). The orien- 
tation was shown to be coverage dependent with flat 
lying species predominant at low surface coverages. 
In the case of ethylidene moieties, osmium cluster 
work by Anson et al. has shown that the CH 3 
asymmetric stretch comes at 2950 cm-~ and is the 
strongest feature in the CH stretch region for this 
species [23]. Further, in the case of K promoted 
Pt(lll), where ethylidene has been identified as the 
stable intermediate in ethylene decomposition to eth- 
ylidyne, a peak in the CH stretch portion of the 
HREELS spectrum was seen at 2955 cm ~ [10]. The 
CH stretch frequencies and assignments of ethyl 
iodide on Pt(lll) (from Ref. [19]) and ethylidene 
moieties in [(CH3CH)Os2(CO)8] (from Ref. [23]) are 
given in Table 1. 
It is significant that no intensity is seen in the

symmetric stretch) during the presence of the 2957 
cm 1 feature. This is a demonstration of the orienta- 
tional sensitivity of SFG on metal surfaces. The 
signal intensity of a vibrational mode in our SFG 
experiments scales as cos60 [24], where 0 is the 
angle between the surface normal and the direction

of the dynamic dipole moment of the surface species. 
In the case of upright ethylidene moieties the CH 3 
symmetric stretch mode would make a 55 
° angle 
with respect to the surface normal, whereas the CH 3 
asymmetric stretch mode would make a 35 
° angle 
with respect to the normal. This difference in angle 
would lead to nearly an order of magnitude greater 
signal intensity for the CH3 asymmetric mode in an 
SFG experiment. For ethyl groups, low coverages 
(flat lying) showed little or no intensity in the 2857 
cm -~ region even in RAIRS experiments where 
signal intensity scales only as cos20 [19]. Therefore, 
it would be expected that flat lying ethyl groups 
would not give rise to a peak in the 2857 cm 1 
region of an SFG spectrum where the orientational 
sensitivity is even more extreme. 
Another significant observation from Fig. 4 is the 
blue shift of the 2906 cm-I feature. One possible 
explanation is that the changing surface coverage of 
di-cr bonded ethylene causes this phenomenon. We 
have carried out experiments on the coverage depen- 
dence of the CH 2 symmetric stretch frequency which 
show that there is indeed a shift from 2924 cm-1 at 
low coverage up to 2904 cm ~ at saturation. An- 
other possibility is that the shift is due to intensity 
from another vibrational mode of the intermediate 
species. This would be easiest to explain in terms of 
an ethylidene intermediate. For an ethylidene moiety 
that has its methyl group tilted close to the surface 
and its hydrogen pointing nearly straight up, one 
might expect to see some intensity from the weak 
CH stretch mode. This would also explain the lack of 
intensity near 2850 cm -~, because the CH 3 symmet- 
ric stretch would be nearly parallel to the Pt surface. 
It would, however, be more difficult to explain the 
blue shift of the 2906 cm 1 peak in terms of an 
ethyl group. This is because an additional feature at 
2857 cm-~ is not seen. The 2857 cm -~ intensity 
would be from a Fermi resonance of the 2914 cm- 
feature and should scale with it. 
Because small amounts of ethane have been de- 
tected to desorb from the surface during ethylidyne 
formation [25,26], we postulate that some ethyl 
species may exist during the conversion of di-o- 
bonded ethylene to ethylidyne. However, studies of 
ethyl moieties have shown that ethyl groups decom- 
pose to form di-cr bonded ethylene and ethane at 
temperatures above 250 K on the Pt(111) surface

[27,28]. Our spectra of the conversion show that the 
2957 cm-1 feature is present on the surface without 
any di-o- bonded ethylene at 281 and 288 K (Fig. 4). 
This requires ethyl groups to survive for minutes 
under severe dehydrogenation conditions after all the 
di-cr bonded ethylene is gone. Further, our vinyl 
iodide spectra show that the same CH 3 asymmetric 
stretch signal occurs even under the condition of 
25% less initial surface hydrogen. For these reasons 
we favor an ethylidene interpretation of the 2957 
cm 1 feature. 
An ethylidene interpretation of the 2957 cm -1 
stretch leads to two important conclusions. Ethyli- 
dene would be a likely intermediate in the conver- 
sion of di-cr bonded ethylene to ethylidyne and the 
breaking of the CH bond on the c~-carbon of ethyli- 
dene would be the rate limiting step in this reaction. 
The mechanisms in Fig. 6 illustrate three possible 
pathways for ethylene decomposition to ethylidyne 
that involve an ethylidene intermediate. In the first 
mechanism di-cr bonded ethylene is hydrogenated to 
an ethyl group followed by stepwise dehydrogena- 
tion of the o~-carbon. We reject this mechanism 
because work on ethyl chloride by Lloyd et al. has 
shown that ethyl groups first dehydrogenate on 
Pt(lll) to yield di-o" bonded ethylene rather than 
dehydrogenate directly to ethylidyne [28,29]. 
In the second mechanism a CH bond on the di-cr 
bonded ethylene breaks to form a vinyl group. This 
118 
P. Cremer et al. / Surface Science 328 (1995) 111-118 
vinyl group undergoes hydrogenation at the CH: 
carbon to form ethylidene. Ethylidene then dehydro- 
genates to form ethylidyne. This too can be ruled out 
on the basis of the vinyl iodide work by Zaera et al. 
which shows that vinyl decomposes readily to vinyli- 
dene and acetylene at temperatures around 140 K 
[21]. 
The last mechanism involves only two steps. First, 
a hydrogen atom undergoes a 1, 2 shift to form 
ethylidene. This is followed by a dehydrogenation 
step to form ethylidyne. Such a mechanism is consis- 
tent with experimental data and indeed involves the 
least number of steps. Therefore, in agreement with 
Carter and Koel we favor this last mechanism. 
Clearly there is a third species present on Pt(111) 
during the dehydrogenation of di-cr bonded ethylene 
to ethylidyne. For the reasons stated above we be- 
lieve that it is more likely that this species is ethyli- 
dene than ethyl, however, both species would show 
very similar spectral features in the CH stretch range. 
In addition, optical sum frequency generation has 
proven to be an excellent new technique for investi- 
gating the surface chemistry of this reaction. 
5. Conclusion 
Surface vibrational spectra of the transformation 
of di-o- bonded ethylene to ethylidyne have been 
recorded after each of eight annealing steps. The 
spectra show that in addition to the CH 3 and CH 2 
symmetric stretch features from ethylidyne and di-cr 
bonded ethylene (respectively) there is a high fre- 
quency feature around 2957 cm -1 during the trans- 
formation process. We have assigned this feature to 
the CH 3 asymmetric stretch of ethylidene and/or 
ethyl. Therefore, there is a third stable species pre- 
sent on the surface during the conversion of di-o- 
bonded ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(lll).
