The rates of dehydrogenation 
of propane to propene over platinum 
and very dilute platinum- 
in-gold alloys have been measured. In the composition 
range of 0.5-14.0 atomTo platinum, 
the 
rates per unit surface area of the alloy powders vary linearly with the bulk platinum 
concen- 
tration in the alloys. From this it is concluded that only one platinum 
atom is involved in the 
rate-determining 
step. 
For both platinum 
and the alloys, activation 
energies of some 29 f 2 kcal/mole 
were mea- 
sured. The reaction rate order in hydrogen, however, is different. It is proposed that propane 
dehydrogenation 
over platinum 
and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, 
namely, dissociative chemisorption 
of propane on a single platinum 
atom to which two adsorp- 
tion sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen at.om. The subsequent conversion of the 
propyl radical into r-bonded 
propene via,!?-hydrogen elimination 
appears to be rate det.ermining. 
The last step, desorption of r-bonded 
propene, has a comparat,ively low activation 
energy. The 
difference in negative reaction order, with respect’ to hydrogen, between platinum 
and its diluted 
alloys reflects a lower steady-state en on Pt atoms surrounded 
by Au atoms vis-a-vis Pt atoms 
on a Pt surface. 
INTRODUCTION 
The mechanism of the catalytic dehydro- 
genation of paraffins over transition metals 
such as platinum is still a matter of contro- 
versy. This also applies to related reactions 
on which much more fundamental work 
has been done, such as paraffin/deuterium 
exchange, olefin hydrogenation, 
and isom- 
erization of double bonds in olefins. In 
the older literature 
the emphasis was on 
a,&diadsorbed alkyl 
radicals, supposedly 
bonded to two adjacent metal atoms of the 
catalyst 
(1). Later, the emphasis shifted 
to ?r-olefinic and ?r-allylic intermediates, 
which may coordinate to one single atom 
on the surface of the metal catalyst (2). 
For the hydrogenation 
of olefins it has 
recently 
been suggested that the actual 
hydrogen transfer takes place between an 
adsorbed species C,H, 
and adsorbate 
olefin, thus linking 
hydrogenation 
with 
self-hydrogenation (3). 
Information about the number of catalyst 
atoms involved 
in the rate-determining 
step of a given reaction may come from 
experiments in which 
the catalytically 
active metal is diluted in a catalytically 
inactive one. Provided that the two metals 
mix, the average size of surface-exposed 
“ensembles” of contiguous active atoms 
will decrease 
upon dilution. When reactions 
differ from one another with regard to the 
number of contiguous active atoms engaged 
simultaneously 
in the 
rate-determining 
step, dilution may lead to a change in 
catalytic selectivity. This is what has been 
observed in a number of recent studies of 
hydrocarbon conversions over group VIII

transition 
metals diluted in a group Ib 
matrix [Refs. (4, 5) and, for reviews, Ref. 
(s)]. 
The information 
is qualitative 
in 
nature as long as the data are confined to 
selectivities, but when reaction rates per 
unit alloy surface area can be mcasurcd, 
quantitative 
information 
may also result. 
Thus, in a recent study of ethane hydrogen- 
olysis over Cu-Ni alloys it was concluded 
that the pre-exponential factor in the rate 
of hydrogenolysis (per unit alloy surface 
area) decreases quadratically 
with 
de- 
creasing nickel concentration. 
This indi- 
cates that ensembles of two contiguous 
nickel atoms participate in the rate-deter- 
mining step (7). Although some 
restrictions 
and assumptions are involved 
[cf. 
the 
discussion in Ref. (7) and in the present 
paper], the overall approach seems 
to be 
sound. Therefore, we selected the “quanti- 
tative dilution method” for studying the 
catalytic 
dehydrogenation of paraffins. 
In order to minimize collective 
phe- 
nomena we chose 
a series 
of alloys in which 
not only the surface concentration, 
but 
also the bulk concentration, of the active 
metal is low. Furthermore, 
we aimed to 
collect rate data pertaining to alloy surfaces

that are substantially 
free of irreversibly 
adsorbed carbonaceous residues. To this 
end we used an appreciable hydrogen 
pressure and a high hydrogen-to-hydro- 
carbon ratio. With these precautions we 
measured initial rates of propane dehydro- 
genation over a series of highly diluted 
platinum-in-gold 
alloys. In order to be 
able to interpret the results we subjected 
the same alloys to additional catalytic tests 
including n-hexane isomerization, hexene-1 
double-bond isomerization, and hydrogen 
and CO chemisorption. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Catalyst Preparation and Characterization 
Platinum-gold 
alloy powders were pre- 
pared following the method of Kulifay 
(B), 
i.e., platinum and gold present in aqua reyia 
solutions were reduced by hydrazinc dis- 
solved in water. In the Kulifay 
(8) syn- 
thesis, which also has a purifying 
effect, 
since noble metals are preferentially 
re- 
duced/precipitated, 
we used metals of 
99.99% purity 
(Drijfhout) 
and reagents of 
a.r. grade (Merck). After filtering, washing, 
and drying, the precipitates were sintered 
in hydrogen for 16 hr at 420°C and, then, 
were characterized by BET-N2 adsorption, 
X-ray 
diffraction 
analysis 
(XRD), 
and 
electron microprobe analysis (Table 1). 
Sintering temperatures well above 420°C 
resulted in an unacceptable loss of (BET) 
surface area, especially with the prepara- 
tions 
containing 
< 7% Pt. The temperature 
during the activity test runs, therefore, was 
limited to T < 410°C. The absence of 
appreciable sintering during the catalytic 
test was verified with BET measurements 
on the spent catalysts. 
Electron 
microprobe analyses revealed 
that 
the spatial variation 
in platinum 
content of the alloy powders is well below 
10% (spatial resolution = lo4 A). According 
to XRD 
[ (111) and (422) diffractions], 
the 
-18% 
Pt-Au 
alloy contains a platinum- 
rich phase (97y0 Pt) in addition to a gold-

rich one (14ye Pt). This is in agreement 
with the existence of a miscibility gap in the 
Pt-Au 
system, extending at 300°C from 
approximately 14 to 97ye Pt by wzight (9). 
Actually, 
the overall 
composition, 
i.e., 
-lS% 
Pt, resulted from an error during 
the preparation which was aimed at pro- 
ducing a 14y0 alloy. 
The other alloys 
show-cd only one phase in XDR. 
Lattice 
constants were obscrvcd to be approxi- 
matcly 0.1% below the value calculated 
from the linear interpolation bctwwn the 
values for pure platinum and pure gold 
[ (422) diffractions). 
Test Procedures 
The catalyst powders were tested in a 
microflow reactor system as particles of 
0.05-0.08 mm. The (variable) amount of 
catalyst 
powder was supplemented with 
sufficient 
inert 
diluent, 
either 
SIC or 
cr-AlzOs to obtain a catalyst bed with an 
approximately constant volume (y 1 cm3). 
All 
experiments wrc 
conducted 
under 
plug-flow conditions. Neither the compari- 
sons of the catalytic 
activity 
of highly 
porous platinum 
powder with 
that 
of 
massive wire nor the experiments in \vhich 
both the amount of catalyst and the gas 
flow were varied proportionally 
disclosed 
any evidence of distortion of the kinetic 
data 
by 
either 
intra- 
or interparticle 
diffusion. 
The reactor used in the catalytic 
tests 
was made of gold-coated stainlrss steel. 
Conditions could be monitored and rcgu- 
lated with an accuracy well within 0.2”C 
(temperature) and 5% (pressure and flow). 
Feedstocks included n-hexane as well as 
propane and hexene-1. The n-hexane was 
purified by distillation and percolation over 
SiOz and was deoxygenated prior to use. 
Propane was purified in situ by passing 
it in 
succession 
through a high- and a low-tem- 
pcrature 
Pt/SiOz 
catalyst 
bed located 
upstream of the microreactor. 
Hydrogen 
was purified by diffusion through a pal- 
ladium thimble.

Prior to catalytic 
testing the catalysts 
were subjected to an in situ cleaning 
procedure, comprising oxidation (1 bar 02, 
T = 22O”C, t = 1 hr) and reduction (2 bar 
Hz, T = 4OO”C, t > 6 hr). To obtain a 
constant initial activity it sometimes 
proved 
necessary to repeat the oxidation/reduction 
cycle several times. During the oxidation 
step the temperature had to be limited 
to 22O”C, because, at higher temperatures, 
oxygen induced dehydrogenation activity 
of the reactor walls. The catalytic 
tests 
wrc 
carried out at higher temperatures 
(T = 360-390°C) 
and, therefore 
might 
give rise to further 
segregation of bulk 
impurities. However, when we subjected 
a few selected samples to an external 
burn-off with oxygen (1 bar 02, T = 42O”C, 
t=24 
hr), 
no significant 
increase in 
catalytic 
activity 
was observed. 
The first product 
analysis by on-line 
glc was usually made 120 see after cut-in 
of hydrocarbon into the hydrogen feed, and 
subsequent analyses were performed with 
15-min time intervals. From the resultant 
activity 
decline curves, the initial activity 
was determined by extrapolation 
toward 
t = 0. All numbers for catalyst activities 
in this paper (turnover numbers) pertain 
to these initial activities. In all experiments, 
the decline in catalyst activity 
was found 
to bc very smooth, from which we conclude

pertain to catalytic 
dehydrogenations 
mea- 
sured in the kinetic 
region. However, when 
we compare 
experiments 
with 
different 
reactor fillings, the data on initial 
activities 
are found to scatter considerably 
(a = 50%). 
The precision of the data obtained 
with one 
particular 
reactor filling is better than 10%. 
To our mind, the relatively 
large scatter 
of 
data with different reactor fillings may well 
be due to a varying degree of initial 
surface 
cleanliness 
of the catalyst. 
Consequently, 
our values for the activation 
energies and 
reaction rate orders (stemming 
from experi- 
ments on one reactor loading) 
are probably 
accurate within 
10% (Table 4), but values 
for turnover

Table 3 and Fig. 1. They are presented as 
turnover 
numbers, i.e., moles of propene 
produced per second per square meter of 
catalyst surface. As discussed 
in the experi- 
mental section, the turnover numbers are 
inaccurate up to at least 50% relative. 
Nevertheless, the relation between them 
and the bulk platinum content, xb, is found 
to be close to linear. When fitting a power 
curve, R(xb) = (Yxb’ moles per second per 
square meter of alloy surface area, to the 
data in Table 3 (Fig. I), we obtain a 
least-squares regression coefficient 
of p 
= 0.99 for 0 < xb < 0.15. 
Table 
4 summarizes the 
activation 
energies and the orders of the reaction 
rates in propane and hydrogen. Because 
the variations in these values within the 
alloy series are insignificant relative to the 
measurement precision (lo%), 
the data 
obtained on the individual alloys have been 
averaged.

of unalloyed platinum on the surface of

rather expect a linear relation between rate

tion of a platinum 
phase seems to be 
absent in our alloy powders. 
Hydrogenation and Double-Bond Isomeriza- 
tion of Hexene-1 
For an olefin such as hexene-1 the 
kinetics change rapidly in the temperature 
range of lOO-200°C. The activation energies 
drop sharply with increasing temperature 
(Table

The

Chemisorption Experiments 
When 
alloying 
platinum 
with gold we 
observe a decrease in hydrogen 
chemisorp- 
tion, which is much more pronounced 
than 
the decrease in CO chemisorption 
(Table 
7). Irreversible 
chemisorption 
of hydrogen 
on 14yo Pt-Au 
is nondetectable, 
even when 
the temperature 
during hydrogen 
exposure 
is raised from 273 to 400 K. This indicates 
that “dilution” 
of surface-exposed platinum 
atoms with gold substantially 
reduces their 
ability 
to 
dissociate 
and/or 
chemisorb 
hydrogen. 
Surprisingly, 
Pt-Au 
films do not 
show this behavior 
(IS), but Pt-Sn powders 
do (14). 
Surface Composition 
CO 
chemisorption 
indicates 
that 
the 
surface 
of the 
Pt-Au 
alloy 
powders 
is 
substantially 
enriched 
in gold 
(Table

ment 
in the component 
with the lowest 
heat of sublimation 
has also been observed 
for Ni-Au 
and Pd-Au

DISCUSSION 
Catalytic 
Dehydrogenation: Intrinsic 
Ac- 
tivity of Platinum Ensembles 
of Di’eren,t 
size 
Dilution 
of catalytically 
active platinum 
atoms in a matrix 
of catalytically 
inactive 
gold atoms has been employed 
as a means 
of studying 
the intrinsic 
activity 
of en- 
sembles of contiguous 
platinum 
atoms 
of 
different size. To what extent the resultant 
rates per unit 
surface area can be inter- 
preted depends on two conditions. 
(i) The 
intrinsic 
activity 
of ensembles of any given 
size must be sufficiently 
constant 
despite 
the variation 
in alloy composition 
; and (ii) 
the 
variation 
in 
distribution 
of active 
atoms over ensembles of different size with 
the variation 
in alloy composition 
must be 
sufficiently 
large. 
Before interpreting 
the 
rate data for the dilution 
series 0.5-14y0 
Pt in gold, we will discuss to what extent 
these conditions 
have been met. 
The intrinsic 
activity 
of an ensemble of a 
given size or geometry 
will depend on its 
coordination 
in both the surface and sub- 
surface planes. 
It 
may, 
in addition, 
be 
influenced 
by collective 
(band 
structure) 
phenomena. 
As a result, intrinsic 
activities 
may 
well 
vary 
with 
the 
overall 
alloy 
composition. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
platinum 
in the present alloy series occurs 
in a highly 
dilute 
form. 
With 
increasing 
dilution, 
the individual 
platinum 
ensembles 
will become more and more isolated 
from 
each other, and, therefore, 
we know that 
in the limit 
of very high 
dilution, 
their

OVER Pt AND Pt-Au 
83 
intrinsic activity 
must become constant. 
Thus, in view of the highly diluted nature 
of the present alloys, the assumption of 
approximately constant intrinsic activity 
is 
probably justified. 
The variation 
in distribution 
of active 
atoms over ensembles 
of different size with 
the alloy composition can be calculated 
from elementary statistics, when we assume 
the atoms to be noninteracting. The results 
depend on the coordination number; for 
systems exhibiting 
six coordinations the 
results have been listed in Table 8. It 
follows that, 
for a concentration 
of the 
minority 
component in the range 0.5-14 
atom?& the fraction 
of minority 
atoms 
present in clusters, i.e., 6F>l, varies drasti- 
cally (Table 8) : 
Q = (6F>1’4% 
)/(GF>P%) 
> 20. 
In an estimate of the value of Q for plati- 
num-gold alloys, three effects are relevant : 
(i) the occurrence of four coordination 
besides 
six coordination; (ii) surface enrich- 
ment of the alloy in gold ; and (iii) clustering 
of platinum (and gold) due to the endo- 
thermicity 
of the alloy. 
Effects i and ii increase Q further toward 
its limiting value (i.e., 28), whereas effect 
iii decreases the value of Q. When we 
calculate a dimerization constant at 360°C 
corresponding to an endothermicity 
of 
some 0.4 kcal/mole (9) and neglect effects 
i and ii, we obtain a lower limit for Q: 
Q E 
(j’>1’4% 
P”-“U)/(F>10.5% 
=-Au) 
> 
12. 
Thus, when we decrease the bulk platinum 
concentration from 14% down to 0.5% Pt, 
we decrease the fraction of surface-exposed 
platinum 
atoms having 
at 
least one 
platinum atom as nearest neighbor, i.e., 
F >I, by at least one order of magnitude. 
If the dehydrogenation 
reaction requires 
two or more contiguous platinum atoms, 
and if the intrinsic activity 
of these en- 
sembles dots not increase by at least one 
order of magnitude, a decrease in dc- 
hydrogenation rate (turnover number) per

a sF(,,i - Fraction 
of all surface-exposed 
atoms 
of the solute present in the surface in an atomic 
fraction zr., in a cluster of size (>)i. 
platinum atom surface exposed upon dilu- 
tion must be expected. 
The rate of dehydrogenation of propane 
over the alloys can be represented by (cf. 
Fig. 1 and Table 3) 
R = a (.~t,) 
l .O 
mol/sec/mz, 
in which 
l’b corresponds to the bulk 
platinum concentration 
in the alloy. For 
our highly 
diluted alloys the extent 
of 
surface enrichment, i.e., ?,,/.I.,, will hardly 
depend on the bulk platinum content, .l’b; 
thus, it follows that 
R = b 
(.rS) 
* 
.O 
mol/sec/m2, 
in which .rS corresponds to the surface 
platinum 
concentration 
in the alloy. As 
the rates are expressed per unit (BET) 
surface area of the alloys, this means that 
the turnover numbers per surface-exposed 
platinum atom (TON) 
vary 
with R/x,, 
and, thus, 
TON = C(0.5y0 6 &lk 
6 140/,), 
i.e., the turnover 
numbers per platinum 
atom exposed at the surface are inde- 
pendent of both R‘~ 
and R’b. 
Whereas the turnover 
numbers (and 
activation 
energies!) appear to be in- 
dependent of alloy composition, the fraction 
of platinum atoms present in ensembles, 
84 
BILOEN, 
DAUTZENBERG, 
AND 
SACHTLER 
i.e., F,l, varies significantly. Therefore, we 
conclude that 
ensembles and isolated 
platinum atoms have, within the measure- 
ment precision, the same intrinsic activity 
per platinum atom. This important outcome 
shows that the rate-determining step in the 
catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over 
platinum-gold 
alloys involves one platinum 
atom only. 
Reaction Mechanism 
Five results derived from the present 
work are of possible relevance to the 
reaction mechanism. (A) The activation 
energies for propene dehydrogenation over 
Pt and dilute Pt-Au alloys are equal within 
the experimental error. (B) The order in 
hydrogen of the dehydrogenation rate is 
- 1.0 over Pt and -0.5 
over the dilute 
Pt-Au 
alloys. (C) The rate-determining 
step with the dilute alloys involves one Pt 
atom only. (D) The activation energy for 
propane dehydrogenation 
(29 kcal/mole) 
is distinctly 
higher than that for hexene-1 
double-bond isomerization in the region of 
zero reaction order (19 kcal/mole). (E) The 
steady-state coverage, with hydrogen (at 
P = 0.1 
Torr 
Hz and T > 120°C), 
of 
platinum atoms on platinum-gold surfaces 
is very low and considerably below that of 
platinum atoms on platinum surfaces. 
On the analogy of the numerous reaction 
mechanisms proposed so far for, inter aZia, 
olefin- and alkane-deuterium exchange and 
olefin hydrogenation 
(17, 18), the overall 
dehydrogenation reaction probably involves 
three major steps: (i) cleavage of the first 
C-H bond in a dissociative adsorption step, 
resulting in an adsorbed alkyl group; (ii) 
cleavage of the second C-H bond, resulting 
in a ?r- or a-bonded olefin ; (iii) desorption 
of the olefin. 
In regard to the question which is the 
rate-determining 
step, step iii has to be 
discarded in view of our result D, and (i), 
in view of the general observation that the 
activation 
energy for alkane-deuterium 
exchange over group VIII 
transition metals 
is low [lo kcal/mole for platinum (17)]. 
For the further discussion we thus assume 
that step ii is the rate-determining 
step, 
namely, conversion of the adsorbed alkyl 
species 
into adsorbed olefin. 
According 
to 
the 
classical Horiuti- 
Polanyi mechanism (I), several sites are 
required for the conversion of adsorbed 
alkyl species into adsorbed olefin, and at 
least two of these sites are associated with 
a pair of adjacent metal atoms.

For the dilute alloys this can be either a 
Pt-Au 
atom pair of a Pt-Pt 
pair. The 
former possibility would be very difficult 
to reconcile with our result A. Other reasons 
to reject it are found in results obtained by 
Van Schaik et al. (19) and de Jongste et al. 
(20) on Pt-Au 
and Pt-Cu 
alloys. These 
authors conclude that Pt-Au 
pairs, unlike 
Pt-Cu 
pairs, are unable to act as dual 
ensembles for paraffin chemisorption. The 
possibility 
that 
a pair of adjacent Pt 
atoms is required obviously conflicts with 
our result C. Therefore, we propose that 
the two sites required for the conversion 
of the adsorbed alkyl species 
into adsorbed 
olefin are located on one and the same Pt 
atom. The utilization 
of two ligand sites 
on the same transition metal atom is not 
unusual in 
homogeneous catalysis ; in 
heterogeneous catalysis, it has been pro- 
posed by Cossee ($I), for Ziegler-Natta 
polymerization, and by Takeuchi et al. (22), 
for olefin hydrogenation 
and exchange of 
isotopes between protonated 
and deu- 
terated paraffins over sulfided nickel cata- 
lysts with perfectly isolated nickel atoms 
in the surface. 
Three possible reaction modes can be 
visualized to account for the role played 
by such geminal-site pairs in the dchydro- 
genation of a paraffin such as propane.

The third of these modes adapts a recent 
suggestion by Thomson and Webb (5) for 
the mechanism of olefin hydrogenation to 
the present case 
of paraffin dehydrogenation. 
A further distinction between these three 
modes can be made on the basis of the 
observed reaction 
orders in 
hydrogen 
(-O.Ti for the alloys; -1.0 
for platinum; 
cf. Table 4), i.e., result B. When we assume 
all the adsorption/desorption 
equilibria 
preceding the rate-determining 
step to be 
established, we calculate for rate cy

the following values of 1~.

From our results E and B, we then conclude 
that for the alloys mechanism Bl is to be 
preferred to the two other mechanisms 
discussed. 
As far as platinum itself is concerned, 
we cannot exclude the possibility that our 
results have been distorted by the rapid 
formation of a carbonaceous overlayer in 
the period preceding the first measurement 
of catalytic 
performance. The chances of 
such distortion arc slim, however, considcr- 
ing the measurement conditions 
(high 
hydrogen pressure, low hydrocarbon pres- 
sure) and the observation that the dehydro- 
genation rate is first order in propane over 
a propane pressure range as wide as 
4 X 1O-3 bar < PC, < 0.5 bar (PHI = C 
= 2 bar). 
From the combined results 
(E, B) and A, therefore, we conclude that 
mechanism Bl is also the preferred one for 
platinum 
itself. 
The 
finding 
that 
the 
turnover number per surface-exposed plati- 
num is higher for platinum itself than for 
the alloys (by a factor of 227; cf. Table 3 
and the data on surface composition of the 
alloys) is consistent with this conclusion, 
because with 
as the catalytic 
site, a higher surface 
coverage with adsorbed hydrogen implies a 
higher turnover 
number. 
Apart 
from 
result E, which is the 
outcome of chemisorption measurements, 
there is also evidence from alkane-deu- 
terium exchange (~9) and from calculations 
(24) suggesting that alloy surfaces might 
well be comparatively deficient in hydrogen. 
CONCLUSIONS 
(i) Considering the dehydrogenation re- 
action, the intrinsic activity of the platinum 
atoms forming part of the surface of a 
dilute platinum-in-gold 
alloy is essentially 
independent of the extent of dilution (0.5 
atom% < xbPt < 14 atom?&). 
(ii) All rate data, i.e., those obtained on 
the alloys and on platinum itself, can be 
accounted for by the same mechanism. 
This mechanism has as 
the rate-determining 
step the conversion of propyl radicals to 
r-bonded propene, using two adsorption 
sites located on one 
platinum atom. The 
differences between platinum itself and its 
alloys, manifest in the turnover 
numbers 
and the order of the reaction rate in 
hydrogen, derive according to the proposed 
mechanism from a difference in surface

coverage 
with 
hydrogen, 
the alloy surfaces 
being comparatively 
deficient 
in hydrogen. 
Evidence 
to 
this 
effect 
is provided 
by 
chemisorption 
experiments.
