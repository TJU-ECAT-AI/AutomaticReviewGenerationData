Abstract
We have investigated the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne on Pt(111) for a 0.25 ML coverage. We have
also determined the adsorption energies and most favourable adsorption sites for propylene, propylidyne, and all of the C3Hx (x = 3–7) interme-
diates (1-propyl, 2-propyl, propylidene, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, propenylidene, and propynyl). All surface species are more stable than gas-phase
propylene. Propylidyne is found to be the most stable species at the surface, in agreement with previous experiments. All surface moieties adsorb
on sites where the metal atoms replace the missing hydrogen, thereby preserving a sp3 hybridisation of the C atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon.
We used the adsorption energies to compute the overall reaction energies for a total of 18 elementary C–H bond activation and isomerisation
reactions that are likely to be involved in the dehydrogenation of propylene. The combination of energy and vibrational frequency calculations
allowed us to propose some species as possible intermediates of the decomposition process—propylidene and 1-propenyl.

1. Introduction
Fundamental studies of alkene chemistry over catalytically
active transition metal surfaces play a key role in guiding sub-
sequent efforts to understand and improve diverse catalytic
processes ranking from pollution control to ﬁne chemical syn-
thesis. Consequently, the chemisorption of oleﬁns has been
extensively investigated with a view toward determining ad-
sorption geometries and the nature and stability of reaction
intermediates and products [1]. A ﬁrst approach to the study
of the hydrocarbon surface chemistry is achieved by single-
crystal model surfaces [2–5], thus avoiding the complexities of

the actual catalysts. The interaction of ethylene (CH2=CH2)
with Pt(111) has been extensively used as a model system to
understand alkene hydrogenation–dehydrogenation processes.
At low temperatures, ethylene adsorbs on the Pt(111) surface
in a di-σ mode, forming a (2 × 2) pattern. On heating to above
300 K, it transforms into a new, more stable species, ethyli-
dyne [6–8]. A (2 × 2) structure is revealed after exposure to
the electron beam of a LEED gun. This molecule is stable at
the surface roughly between 300 and 420 K. The ethylene-
to-ethylidyne transition represents a whole class of reactions,
namely the dehydrogenation of alkenes to alkylidynes. This
reaction is believed to be involved in catalytic hydrogenation
and dehydrogenation processes. To obtain ethylidyne, one H
atom must migrate from one C atom to another, and a second
H atom must be removed from the molecule. Then it is rea-
sonable to assume that the mechanism comprises at least two
steps and involves the formation of one or more intermediates.

The details of this surface process have been subject of in-
tense debate. Several simple mechanisms have been proposed
with ethyl (CH3CH·
2), vinyl (CH2CH·), ethylidene (CH3CH·),
and/or vinylidene (CH2C·) intermediates [9–15].
The attempt to extend the preceding conclusions to other
oleﬁns has been unsuccessful, because much less information
is available for heavier alkenes. It has been also proposed that
heavier alkenes decompose via the corresponding alkylidyne
intermediates. After ethylene, propylene (CH3CH=CH2) is the
most important raw material used in the production of organic
chemicals. Early in 1982, Salmerón and Somorjai showed that
propylene adsorbs easily on Pt(111) and remains stable with no
chemical decomposition up to around 280 K [16]. Using ther-
mal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), these authors estimated an
adsorption energy of −51 kJ mol−1 at low coverage. Koestner
et al. [8], using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), pro-
posed that propylene binds to two surface Pt atoms through
its unsaturated C=C unit (di-σ-bond) and forms a disordered
monolayer. Their results are in agreement with more recent
experimental works [17,18] and with the results derived from
qualitative molecular orbital calculations [19]. In addition, Koel
et al. also investigated the adsorption and decomposition of
propylene on Pt(111) [20] and determined an adsorption energy
of ∼−70 kJ mol−1. However, this rather simple picture of the
interaction of propylene with Pt(111) contrasts with the com-
plexity that emerges from the complete reﬂection–absorption
(RAIRS) studies of Zaera and Chrysostomou [21]. Those au-
thors proposed that at least four species derive from adsorbed
propylene, depending on coverage and temperature. For the
sake of clarity, we created a schematic representation of these
surface structures (Scheme 1). At temperatures below 230 K,
this molecule adsorbs undissociated on Pt(111) analogously
to ethylene [22]. Below half-saturation, propylene binds pref-
erentially to the metal surface in a di-σ fashion through its
central C bond (V-shape; Scheme 1a). As the coverage in-
creases up to saturation, the molecule rearranges, the C=C
bond becomes more parallel to the surface, and the methyl
group tilts away from the surface toward a more vertical ori-
entation (Scheme 1b). Comparing infrared data from propylene
ligands in osmium organometallic complexes with electron en-
ergy loss spectrometry (EELS) and RAIRS data for propylene
on Pt(111) and on Ni(111) [23] corroborates the di-σ adsorp-
tion mode with signiﬁcant rehybridisation of the C atoms to-
ward sp3. However, this comparison does not provide further

information on the structure of the adsorbed molecule. Above
saturation coverage, a second layer of weakly adsorbed mole-
cules grows (π-bonded; Scheme 1c), and a clear transformation
between about 230 and 270 K has been observed [23]. Actually,
the 275 K RAIRS spectrum is consistent with the formation
of propylidyne (CH3CH2C·; Scheme 1d), an alkylidyne moi-
ety. The formation of an intermediate during the transformation
from propylene to propylidyne seems evident according to the
new feature at 2890 cm−1 observed in the 256 and 268 K
RAIRS spectra [23]. This signal cannot be associated with
propylene or with propylidyne, but may be related to 2-propyl
(CH3(CH3)CH·) or propylidene (CH3CH2CH·) species. Koest-
ner et al. [8] also detected formation of the propylidyne species
and found that the LEED-IV spectra of ethylene and propylene
are roughly identical between 280 and 400 K. This seems to
indicate that the room temperature propylene has a structure
similar to that of room temperature ethylene. The data are con-
sistent with the presence of an alkylidyne species. In contrast to
the nonspontaneous ordering of ethylidyne, propylidyne forms
spontaneously a 2 × 2 pattern due to steric considerations.
Clearly, deriving accurate descriptions of the structures of
propylene, propylidyne, and the possible reaction intermediates
(see Table 1) is a necessary step in understanding the subse-
quent surface processes. Toward this end, we used periodic
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine the
geometry, adsorption site preference, and adsorption energy for
these species. We also carried out an analysis of vibrational
spectra. Here we focus our discussion on the comparison with
available experimental data.
2. Computational details
We obtained the geometries and energies of the relevant
species adsorbed on Pt(111) from DFT calculations on a two-
dimensional four-layer slab model of Pt(111) generated in a
three-dimensional periodic supercell by introducing a vacuum
width in the direction perpendicular to the surface (∼12 Å).
We carried out the DFT calculations using the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation potential
of Perdew and Wang [24]. The Kohn–Sham equations of the
DFT were solved in a plane wave basis set, with the effect of
core electrons in the one-electron functions taken into account
through the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [25].
Tight convergence of the plane-wave expansion was achieved

with a cutoff of 400 eV. For our purposes, we considered a
2×2 unit cell associated with a molecular coverage of 0.25 ML.
This corresponds to the experimentally determined structure for
propylidyne on Pt(111) [8]. The 2D Brillouin integrations were
performed on a 7 × 7 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid.
We obtained the geometry of the different adsorbed species
by total energy minimisation with respect to the degrees of
freedom of the adsorbates and of the two uppermost atomic
metal layers; the rest of metal planes were kept ﬁxed at the
calculated bulk geometry with a Pt–Pt interatomic distance
of 2.82 Å. The adsorption energies (Eads) were obtained us-
ing
Eads = (EC3Hx/surface −Esurface −EC3H6(g))
(1)
−(x −6)(EH/surface −Esurface),
where a negative value indicates an exothermic chemisorption
process. Eq. (1) allowed us to obtain adsorption energies of the
different surface intermediates, which can be directly compared
with the propylene adsorption energy.
We computed the vibrational frequencies and the corre-
sponding normal modes within the harmonic approach, ne-
glecting the coupling between molecular vibrations and surface
phonons. This allowed us to rely on the block of the Hessian
matrix involving adsorbate atomic displacements only. The har-
monic molecular frequencies and the associated normal modes
were directly obtained by diagonalisation of the corresponding
block of the mass-pondered Hessian matrix. The energy second
derivatives were obtained from numerical differences of the an-
alytical gradients. We calculated the IR intensities through the
following equation:

where μz is the z-component of the dipole moment and
Pki/√mi is the mass weighted coordinate matrix of the nor-
mal mode. We performed the numerical calculation of the ﬁrst
derivative of the dipole moment in the Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem (ri). We carried out all calculations using the Vienna Ab
Initio Simulation Program (VASP) [26–28].
3. Results
3.1. Adsorption of propylene, propylidyne, and C3Hx
(x = 3–7) intermediates on Pt(111)
In a previous paper [29], we showed that propylene ad-
sorbs preferentially on Pt(111) in a di-σ mode [η1η1(C1,C2)-
adsorption mode; Fig. 1]. Our calculations were in good agree-
ment with the results of Zaera and Chrysostomou [21] (see
Scheme 1b). In the earlier work, we did not consider the ef-
fect of surface relaxation and used US-PP pseudopotentials. In
this paper we reexamine the propylene–surface interaction, tak-
ing surface relaxation explicitly into account and using PAW.
As expected, the changes on the substrate were rather small;
the relaxation of the surface metal atoms involved mainly a
small outward displacement of the Pt atoms directly interact-
ing with the C atoms. This produced a small corrugation of
the surface (<4%) with the simultaneous change in the Pt–Pt
bond distances (<0.16 Å). However, the adsorption energy
changed signiﬁcantly, from −39 kJ mol−1 [29] (nonrelaxed sur-
face, US-PP) and −66 kJ mol−1 (nonrelaxed surface, PAW) to
−87 kJ mol−1 (relaxed surface, PAW). The computed adsorp-
tion energy was noticeably larger than the value estimated by
TDS experiments: −50 kJ mol−1 [16] and −70 kJ mol−1 [20].
This is not surprising, because the tendency of PW91 to overes-
timate adsorption energies is well established [30]. Moreover, it
is difﬁcult to compare the calculated value with the experimen-
tal adsorption energy from TDS curves, because propylene de-
composition may occur before desorption takes place at around
270–280 K [21]. Zaera and Chrysostomou [21] proposed that
below saturation coverage, the hydrogen atom released in the
dehydrogenation reaction at 230–250 K remains on the surface
and weakens the adsorption of propylene. We computed the ad-
sorption energy of the system propylene plus H atom at inﬁnite
distance (the sum of Eads of the hydrocarbon and of H) and
coadsorbed on the same 2 × 2 unit cell. Our calculations pre-
dict a decrease in the adsorption energy of 33 kJ mol−1 when
both species are coadsorbed, in agreement with the suggestion
of Zaera and Chrysostomou [21]. The energy difference arises
primarily from the surface-mediated repulsion between reac-
tants sharing bonding with a metal atom [31].

Fig. 1 (side view) summarizes the distortion of propylene
and the changes in the Pt–Pt bond distances on adsorption.
Gas-phase propylene has a calculated C1–C2 bond distance of
1.33 Å and a C2–C1H2 angle (deﬁned as the angle between
the C1–C2 bond and the C1H2 plane) of 180◦. On adsorption,
the C1–C2 distance increases signiﬁcantly (1.49 Å). Interest-
ingly, this bond distance is close to that obtained for ethylene
adsorbed on Pt(111) in a di-σ conﬁguration using a similar
computational approach [32,33]. This represents an elongation
of 0.15 Å with respect to the gas-phase propylene, thus ap-
proaching a single C–C bond length as in propane (1.54 Å) with
concomitant reduction of the double-bond character. On ad-
sorption on Pt(111), similar elongations of the C=C bond have
also been reported for different alkene molecules [34,35]. An-
other indicator of the degree of rehybridisation of the C atoms is
the C2–C1H2 angle. On Pt(111), propylene loses its “planarity”
as the CH bonds bend away from the surface plane. The angle
between the H–C1–H plane and the C1–C2 bond (parallel to the
surface) is ∼130◦.
Scheme 2 displays the elementary paths for the dehydro-
genation of di-σ bonded propylene to propylidyne. We did not
consider C–C bond cleavage, and we also neglected the dehy-
drogenation of the methyl group. We determined the adsorption
modes and the corresponding adsorption energies for all C3Hx
(x = 3–7) species using a 2 × 2 unit cell. The possible reaction
intermediates are listed in Table 1. As for propylene [29], we
explored different adsorption sites (top, bridge, hollow). Here
we show only the most stable identiﬁed conﬁguration for each

intermediate. The relative stabilities (Eads) for each of the sur-
face species are also shown in Fig. 2.
All of the surface intermediates are stable with respect to
gas-phase propylene and the clean surface. However, only four
moieties are more stable than adsorbed propylene: 1-propenyl,
propylidyne, propenylidene, and propyne (see Fig. 2). Among
these, the most stable is the propylidyne species. Indeed, propy-
lidyne is 59 kJ mol−1 more stable than adsorbed propylene plus

three adsorbed hydrogen atoms. In agreement with the experi-
mental evidence [8,21,23], our calculations conﬁrm that propy-
lene dehydrogenation to propylidyne and surface hydrogen is
thermodynamically favourable. Adsorbed 2-propenyl is almost
isoenergetic with propylene, with an energy difference of only
2 kJ mol−1. On the other hand, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, propylidene,
and propynyl are less stable than adsorbed propylene by 18, 31,
19, and 47 kJ mol−1, respectively.
We investigated the coverage effects for propylene, propy-
lidyne, and two of the possible reaction intermediates (propy-
lidene and 1-propenyl). We increased the size of the unit cell
to 3 × 3 (1/9 ML). In all of the cases, the adsorption energy
increased by ∼10 kJ mol−1, indicative of a slight repulsion be-
tween the hydrocarbon molecules at 1/4 ML coverage (2 × 2
unit cell). Because the energy difference between the 2 × 2 and
3 × 3 systems was roughly the same for all cases, the relative
stabilities did not change.
The calculated optimized structural parameters are illus-
trated in Figs. 3a–3i. For the sake of clarity, only the Pt atoms
directly below the hydrocarbon fragment are shown. The 1-pro-
pyl (Fig. 3a) and 2-propyl (Fig. 3b) prefer the top adsorption site
where the surface metal atom essentially replaces the missing
hydrogen atom to form a “propane-like” surface intermediate
that preserves its sp3 symmetry. This is consistent with concepts
derived from the orbital integration scheme of Hoffmann [36]
and Shustorovich and Baetzold [37]. The balance between the
Pauli repulsion and the orbital overlap dictates the adsorption
site preference. For metals in the rightmost part of the periodic
table, Pauli repulsion dominates [38] and favours the top ad-
sorption site. Neurock and van Santen [39] have rationalized
the adsorption site preference of ethyl groups on Pd(111) us-
ing these arguments. With respect to propylene, propylidene
(Fig. 3c) has two missing hydrogen atoms in C1 and thus is bet-
ter adsorbed at a bridge site or η2(C1)-adsorption mode. (Here
η2 denotes the number of Pt atoms bind to a C atom.) The C3H5

intermediates adsorb preferentially on hollow fcc sites. Propyli-
dyne (Fig. 3d), with three missing hydrogen atoms in C1, pref-
erentially binds to three Pt atoms in an η3(C1) coordination. Our
results are in good agreement with the experimental results of
Koestner et al. [8]. The 1-propenyl moiety (Fig. 3e) is missing
two H atoms in C1 and one H atom in C2, and thus it prefers the
120

η2η1(C1,C2)-adsorption mode. The adsorption geometry of 2-
propenyl (Fig. 3f) is equivalent to that obtained for 1-propenyl.
There appears to be a general trend of Pt(111) preferring sp3-
bound intermediates of adsorbed hydrocarbons. Actually, all of
the C–C bond distances are within the range of 1.48–1.54 Å.
The pictures for propenylidene (Fig. 3g), propyne (Fig. 3h),
and propynyl (Fig. 3i) are quite different. Similar to the C3H5
species, these surface intermediates adsorb preferentially on
threefold hollow sites (fcc). Three H atoms from C1 and one
atom from C2 are missing in the propenylidene moiety, and thus
this moiety prefers to sit on η3η1(C1,C2) coordination. How-
ever, the C1–C2 bond distance (1.41 Å) is rather short compared
with the C3Hx (x = 5–7) hydrocarbon fragments (see above).
Dumesic et al. obtained the same adsorption site and geom-
etry for vinylidene (CH2=C·) on Pt(111) [40]. Propyne [41]
adsorbs on Pt(111) in a η2η2(C1,C2) adsorption mode, with the
C1–C2 (1.39 Å) bond almost parallel to the metal surface. How-
ever, propynyl binds in clearly a sp2 fashion. In this molecule,
three H atoms from C1 and two H atoms from C2 are miss-
ing, which favours the formation of a surface intermediate of
sp3 symmetry; however, it binds to the Pt(111) surface in a
η3η1(C1,C2) adsorption mode, with the C2 forming a bond only
with a metal atom. Moreover, the C1–C2 distance (1.31 Å) is
obviously closer to a double bond than to a simple bond. Our
results are well in line with those of Jacob and Goddard [42],
who investigated the adsorption of the C2Hy (y = 1–5) inter-
mediates on Pt(111) by means of DFT and found that the struc-
ture of C2Hy molecules achieves a saturated conﬁguration in
which each C atom is almost tetrahedral. The only exceptions
are CCH· (ethynyl) and CHCH (acetylene). Moreover, these au-
thors determined that the alkylidyne moiety is the most strongly
bound C2Hy species.
Table 2 summarizes the reaction energies for the various
elementary steps depicted in Scheme 2. We computed the re-
action energy (Ereac) by subtracting the initial energies from
the energies of the ﬁnal state. For example, we calculated the
energy for the propylene dehydrogenation to propylidyne by
subtracting the energy of the adsorbed propylene from the en-
ergy of the adsorbed propylidyne plus adsorbed H with no in-
teraction between them. We assumed low hydrogen coverage
and also that the H atoms attached/released in the hydrogena-
tion/dehydrogenation reactions come from/go to far surface
sites.
Most of the elementary steps listed in Table 2 are either
slightly endothermic or exothermic and thus will still play a
role in propylene decomposition. The most exothermic steps
correspond to formation of the propylidyne intermediate. This
reaction can occur via hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, or iso-
merisation. The most favourable way of obtaining this species
is from propylidene (−77 kJ mol−1). Moreover, the reaction
energies suggest that formation of propynyl is unlikely at this
coverage. The formation of this species by dehydrogenation of
propyne is uphill by 64 kJ mol−1. Moreover, its hydrogenation
to propenylidene is highly exothermic (−84 kJ mol−1). There-
fore, we suggest that propynyl is unlikely to be involved in the
direct decomposition of propylene to propylidyne. Among all
of the possible mechanisms, the two-step reaction pathways

3.2. Analysis of vibrational spectra
To shed some more light on the nature of the surface inter-
mediate of the propylene dehydrogenation to propylidyne, we
computed the RAIRS spectrum for propylene (Table 3), propy-
lidyne (Table 4), and all of the possible reaction intermedi-
ates (1-propyl, 2-propyl, propylidene, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl,
propenylidene, propyne, and propynyl; Fig. 4) on Pt(111) at
1/4 ML coverage. Table 3 gives the frequencies along with the

intensities for the di-σ propylene on Pt(111). Almost all of the
normal modes are coupled. This makes the description of the
vibrations somewhat arduous; in some cases, the assignment
may be ambiguous. However, our aim is not to analyze in de-
tail the normal modes, but rather to establish the differences
among the surface species spectra that can help identify the pos-
sible reaction intermediates. Thus, the theoretical assignment
accounts for the main vibrations for each feature. The experi-
mental spectrum [21] presents four bands in the C–H stretching
region (two of them quite intense), four medium or weak peaks
in the 1500–1200 cm−1 region, and three intense features in the
1000–1100 cm−1 region. Despite some differences in intensi-
ties and band assignment, our results are quite consistent with
the experimental observations. The differences in the 2800–
3100 cm−1 region arise from the poor description of the C–H
stretching modes, because these modes are strongly affected
by anharmonicity. Moreover, both the experimental coverage
and the experimental periodicity are not fully reproduced by
the present models. The arrangement of the molecules on the
surface changes the orientation of the methyl groups and its en-
vironment. Zaera and Chrysostomou [21] have pointed out that
these changes strongly inﬂuence the band intensities.
Table 4 presents the calculated frequencies and intensities
for propylidyne on Pt(111). For the sake of comparison, the ta-
ble also summarizes the corresponding features in the RAIRS
[21,43] and EELS spectra [17] of propylene at ∼300 K and sat-
uration coverage. By analogy with the case of ethylene, these
studies have determined that these spectra arise from the propy-
lidyne species. Our results fully conﬁrm the experimental as-
signment (see Table 4). The agreement between the experimen-
tal and simulated spectra is fairly good; the main difference
appears in the region around 900–1100 cm−1. We assign the
features at 1033, 1026, and 921 cm−1 to CH3_ro, CH3_twi, and
C2–C3_st, respectively. (For deﬁnitions of the normal modes,
see the footnotes of Tables 3 and 4.) Only the peaks at 1033
and 920 cm−1 are intense. In the experimental RAIRS spec-
trum, three intense peaks appear in this region. The bands at
1055 [43] (or 1079 [21]), 1039 [43] (or 1041 [21]), and 920
[43] cm−1 have been assigned to CH3_ro, CH3_ro, and C–C_st,
respectively. These differences may arise from the orientations
of the neighbouring methyl groups. In our calculations, all of
the methyl groups are oriented in the same direction; however,
Koestner et al. [8] suggested that the methyl groups tend to
minimize the steric repulsions, and thus the steric effect makes
some orientations impossible. Obviously, that reproduced with
the 2 × 2 unit cell is not the most favoured.
The spectroscopic information available for the possible in-
termediates of the propylene-to-propylidyne transformation is
scarce. Zaera and Chrysostomou [21] investigated changes in
the RAIRS spectrum of propylene on Pt(111) as a function
of the temperature (230–300 K) and found indications of the
formation of an intermediate. They found that the spectrum
at ∼260 K included a new signal at 2890 cm−1 and had no
new peaks in the C–H deformation IR region. Actually, in the
1000–1500 cm−1 region, all of the bands could be assigned to
either propylene or propylidyne. These authors proposed that
these features may belong to the 2-propyl or to the propyli-
dene species. We simulated and analysed the RAIRS spectra
for all of the proposed surface intermediates (Fig. 4). Unfor-
tunately, the C–H stretching region (2800–3100 cm−1) is not
well described with the harmonic model. Moreover, all of the
features lie within a small range, and the differences are sufﬁ-
cient to be conclusive. Hence we focused our attention on the
deformation region. More speciﬁcally, the features not present
for either propylene or propylidine can help rule out some
intermediate species (Fig. 4). The 1-propyl species has two
signals at 1125 and 1350 cm−1 that are not visible in either
the propylene spectrum or the propylidyne spectrum. These
features can be assigned to CH3_s_df and CH2_wag, respec-
tively. 2-propyl has a quite strong feature at 1162 cm−1 (CH_b
mixed with CH3_ro). The propyne molecule and the 2-propenyl
and the propenylidene moieties have some important peaks
at around 1350 cm−1 associated with CH3_s_df. The propy-
nyl intermediate has a strong feature at 1599 cm−1 that can
be assigned to C=C_st. However, the experimental spectrum
matches the spectrum from propylidene or 1-propenyl, because
these species have no important signals in the 1100–1400 cm−1
region. Unfortunately, unequivocally identifying the intermedi-
ate is impossible.
4. Conclusions
We investigated the adsorption of propylene on Pt(111) at
a surface coverage of 0.25 ML using DFT periodic calcula-
tions. Moreover, we examined the adsorption modes and en-
ergies for various dehydrogenated species: 1-propyl, 2-propyl,
propylidene, propylidyne, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, propenyli-
dene, propyne, and propynyl. Propylene adsorbs in a bridge
adsorption mode with an adsorption energy of −87 kJ mol−1.
We determined the relative stabilities and the most favourable
adsorption site for propylidyne and all of the possible reaction
intermediates. For the C3Hx (x = 3–7) fragments, there ap-
pears to be a general trend of Pt(111) preferentially binding to
sp3 carbon intermediates. The relative stabilities of 1-propyl,
2-propyl, propylidene, propylidyne, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl,
propyne, propenylidene, and propynyl are −69, −56, −68,
−145, −93, −89, −104, −123, and −40 kJ mol−1, respec-

tively. Propylidyne is the most stable surface species on Pt(111),
well in line with the experimental evidence.
We computed the reaction energies for 18 elementary steps
that possibly may be involved in the propylene-to-propylidyne
transformation. Our calculations clearly indicate that the de-
hydrogenation of propylene to propylidyne is thermodynam-
ically favourable. The formation of propynyl is energetically
unfavourable, and we conclude that this species may not be in-
volved in the direct reaction of dehydrogenation.
In addition, we simulated the vibrational spectra for propy-
lene, propylidyne, and the possible reaction intermediates. Un-
fortunately, the experimental data available for the reaction
intermediate is not sufﬁcient to enable an unequivocal identi-
ﬁcation. Our best guesses are propylidene and 1-propenyl. It is
noteworthy that these two intermediates are not the thermody-
namically most stable.
