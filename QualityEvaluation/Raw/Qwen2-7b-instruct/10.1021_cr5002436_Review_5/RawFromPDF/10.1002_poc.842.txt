ABSTRACT: Mononuclear Cr(III)–silica models have been studied by quantum chemical methods with respect to
catalytic activity toward dehydrogenation of ethane. Both cluster and slab models have been developed and used to
explore the conceptual model of mononuclear Cr(III) with three covalent ligands that coordinate through oxygen. The
study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main reaction steps: (1) C—H activation of ethane
according to -bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of O—H and Cr—C bonds, (2) -H transfer to
chromium with subsequent loss of ethene and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. An
alternative mechanism is also explored, in which C—H activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium
complex. Stationary points pertaining to these reactions have been optimized, and free energy calculations are used to
identify the rate-determining steps. The inﬂuence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites is explored by
means of a number of idealized surface models and electronic energy proﬁles for the reactions. Copyright # 2004

INTRODUCTION
Dehydrogenation has become an increasingly topical
method for chemical upgrading of liquid natural gas.1,2
Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems
have been developed, and some 7 million metric tons of
C3—C4 oleﬁns are anually produced this way.2 Finely
dispersed platinum and oxide-supported chromium2,3
appear as the most interesting catalysts from an industrial
point of view. Chromium shows interesting catalytic
activity on alumina, which was the original4 and still is
the most commonly used support, but also on silica,
zirconia and titania.3
Speciﬁc aspects of the preparation of the catalyst affect
the activity of chromium in these systems. Chromium is
added in the form of a precursor compound, and only
after drying, calcination and reduction is the catalyst
active.3 After calcination, chromium is believed to be
anchored via oxygen bridges to the substrate.5–7 At low
chromium load on silica, mononuclear Cr(VI)6,8,9 dom-
inates, although dichromium species have also been
reported.10,11 At higher chromium load, -Cr2O3 parti-
cles start to appear.8,11,12 The mononuclear Cr(VI) spe-
cies
have
been
characterized
by
IR
and
Raman
spectroscopy to have distorted tetrahedral structure and
to possess two doubly-bonded terminal oxo ligands.6,9 In
the reduction phase, both the nature of the surface, the
reducing agent and the temperature inﬂuence the ﬁnal
composition. On silica, CO reduces Cr(VI) to Cr(II)10,13
whereas H2 and alkanes favors reduction to Cr(III).13 Re-
heating under humid conditions leads to re-oxidation of
Cr(II) to Cr(III).14–16
There is some controversy concerning the oxidation
state of chromium active for dehydrogenation of alkanes.
Both Cr(II)14,17 and Cr(III)18–20 were proposed as the
active state quite early on. The dominating view in the
modern literature is that þIII is the most active oxidation
state for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contribu-
tions from þII.13,21–25
Concerning the dispersion of active chromium, below
mono-layer coverage and on both alumina, silica and
zirconia, a linear relationship is found between the
number of mononuclear Cr(VI)/Cr(V) species after cal-
cination, and catalytic activity after reduction.13,26–29 On
this basis, DeRossi and co-workers13,26,27 concluded that
the
reaction
requires
only
mononuclear
chromium
species. This does not imply that CrOCr linkages are

detrimental,13 polynuclear species are in fact reported to
be highly active.21,29,30
In agreement with the cited observations, redox Cr(III)
species, i.e. Cr(III) species resulting from reduction of
Cr(VI)/Cr(V), have been identiﬁed as very likely being
active for dehydrogenation.13,22,23,27,31–33 On the other
hand, in a recent contribution by Puurunen et al.34 it was
concluded that the activity of a Cr(III) ion is determined
by its environment rather than its redox history.
On alumina, in situ diffuse-reﬂectance UV–vis spectro-
scopy (DRS) was used to establish a semi-quantitative
relationship between the number of pseudooctahedral
Cr(III) sites and dehydrogenation activity.22 Infrared
spectroscopy studies of CO and NO adsorbed onto
reduced Cr species on silica13 and zirconia35 provide
further clues. Together with measurements of dehydro-
genation activity, these experiments lead to the conclu-
sion that the most active Cr(III) has two coordinative
vacancies. From its spectroscopic signature, this species
was dubbed Cr(III)G, and DeRossi et al.13 went on to
propose a possible structure: chromium bonded to the
surface through two oxygen bridges and with hydroxyl as
the third ligand, cf. Fig. 1.
Only scattered information about the mechanism of
dehydrogenation is available for chromium on alumina
and none at all for silica. Starting with various ideas about
the nature of the active site, a number of reaction
mechanisms have been proposed, see Ref. 36 and refer-
ences cited therein. A recurrent idea is that C—H
activation could involve a Cr—O pair.3,13,26,36,37 In
agreement with the conclusions of DeRossi and co-
workers concerning the activity of mononuclear chro-
mium species,13,26,27 Burwell et al.37 and later Weckhuy-
sen and Schoonheydt3 proposed that dehydrogenation is
initiated by physisorption of the alkane on coordinatively
unsaturated Cr(III) centers. A C—H bond is subse-
quently activated and new O—H and Cr—alkyl bonds
are being formed, cf. reaction (1) in Fig. 2. According to
this mechanism, the alkene is formed as a result of
hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to chromium, whereas
regeneration of the catalytic site and formation of H2
concludes the catalytic cycle, cf. reaction (3) in the ﬁgure.
At this point it appears fruitful to complement the
many experimental studies of these systems by theore-
tical modeling of possible routes for dehydrogenation of
ethane over Cr–oxide surface sites. In the present paper,
we use gradient-corrected density functional theory in
conjunction with cluster models of Cr(III)–silica surface
sites to explore dehydrogenation of ethane. We focus on
reaction mechanisms that largely follow the proposal by
Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt3 as outlined above, where
C—H activation of the alkane takes place through direct
interaction with chromium.
A number of mechanisms for C—H activation are
known from organometallic chemistry, the two most
relevant to the present system being oxidative and elec-
trophilic addition, respectively.38 During oxidative addi-
tion, both carbon and hydrogen bind directly to the metal
as the C—H bond is broken. Electrophilic addition can
also be described as a -bond metathesis reaction,39 as a
metal—ligand bond and a C—H bond are replaced by
a metal—C bond and a ligand—H bond. Alternatively a
metal—H and a ligand—C bond could be formed.40,41 In
general, -bond metathesis is favored on light electron-
deﬁcient metals, whereas oxidative addition is favored on
the heavy and electron-rich late transition metals.42–45
For chromium, -bond metathesis would be expected and
is explored in this work. However, the possibility that
dehydrogenation takes place by means of oxidative
addition of the alkane can not be ruled out and will be
investigated in subsequent work.
A major challenge in computational studies of any of
the Cr–oxide systems is to develop realistic models of the
chromium surface sites. We have extensive experience
from modeling surface sites of Cr–silica in the context of
ethylene polymerization and spectroscopy,46 and also
transition metal ions in siliceous structures.47–51 In order
to build on this, we chose silica as the initial substrate for
our investigations of Cr–oxide catalysts for dehydrogena-
tion, to be extended to the industrially more interesting
Cr–alumina systems at a later stage. Taking the Cr(III)G
structure proposed by DeRossi et al.13 as our starting
point, we have chosen to explore the more general,
conceptual model of mononuclear Cr(III) with three
covalent ligands that coordinate through oxygen. Cluster
models are constructed either ad hoc by identifying likely
coordination sites of chromium on low-index surfaces of

silicalite, or systematically by simulated annealing of
chromium on low-index surfaces of low cristobalite. In
order to validate the performance of the simple cluster
models and to establish effects of an extended support,
combined quantum mechanical–molecular mechanical
(QM–MM) methods have been applied in conjunction
with slab models.
The aim of the work is two-fold. Firstly, we want to
explore whether the sequence of reaction steps suggested
in Ref. 3 provides a viable route to alkane dehydrogena-
tion on Cr(III) surface sites. Secondly, we aim to establish
structural constraints on potentially active sites of dehy-
drogenation. This includes a study of how constraints
imposed
by
the
substrate
inﬂuence
the
energy
requirements of the various elementary steps during
dehydrogenation.
MODELS
In this work, surface cluster models have been con-
structed either in an ad hoc manner, drawing on chemical
intuition and what is known from experiment, or system-
atically, starting from low-index surfaces of silica crys-
tals. With the ad hoc approach, speciﬁc characteristics of
a surface site can be examined using relatively small and
simple clusters, yet at the cost of neglecting potentially
important surface effects. For instance, the essence of a
Cr(III)G species as proposed by DeRossi et al.13 is
maintained in the hydroxychromium disiloxyether mole-
cule shown in Fig. 3A, later referred to as the DeRossi-1
model. Here, chromium is bonded to two silicon atoms in
the silica surface via two oxygen bridges, with the more
distant parts of the silica being neglected and the dangling
bonds terminated by hydrogen. The ﬁrst coordination
sphere of chromium is even reproduced by the Cr(OH)3
molecule, see Fig. 3B, which deﬁnes a site completely
void of surface constraints.
Improved models taking into account larger parts of the
amorphous substrate can be generated from low index
surfaces of the high-T modiﬁcations of silica; - and -
cristobalite.52–54 Molecular dynamics in conjunction with
shell-model potentials are used to obtain structurally
relaxed slab models of Cr-doped silica surfaces, see
Plate 1 and e.g. Ref. 55 for a broader introduction. The
steps of this procedure as applied here, are described in
Computational Details.
Our approach is less than straightforward, in that the
molecular dynamics simulation may take the system to
structures outside the validity range of the shell-model
potentials. As a result, artifacts such as three- and ﬁve-
coordinated silicon atoms are frequent, as observed also
by others.56–59 Moreover, the potential used for Hþ, used
to neutralize the surface, is not optimal for describing
hydrogen in silanol groups.60 This implies that some
amount of user intervention was required in order to
generate realistic models, such as trying out different
initial positions of the ions that were added to the surface
and relocating O2 or Hþ ions during the simulations.
The ﬁnal surface models that were used to study the
dehydrogenation reaction, were chosen on the basis that a
cluster region could be deﬁned in which all silicon atoms
were four-coordinated and there were no interstitial
hydrogen atoms.
In each case, the cluster region includes chromium and
its local chemical environment, with boundary bonds
Ocluster—Sihost severed and terminating by hydrogen
atoms. These clusters were used separate from the bulk
in pure quantum mechanical (QM) cluster calculations,
and as the QM region in QM–MM periodic boundary
calculations. When used as isolated clusters, in resem-
blance of the restoring forces of the extended structures,
atoms at the cluster boundaries have their positions ﬁxed
to those of the parent slab model. In the two-bridged
models, this implies frozen positions for all atoms except
those of the (—O)2CrOH moiety. In the three-bridged
models, the terminating Si(OH)n groups were held in
ﬁxed positions. The accuracy of this approach is exam-
ined in QM–MM optimization of slab models. An in-
dication of the level of strain in each model is found by
comparing the (—O)3Cr geometry with that of the
fully relaxed Cr(OH)3, cf. Table 1. Apparently, the

(100)- and (101)- based models are geometrically fairly
relaxed, whereas the (111)-based Cr–silica model is more
strained.
From the (100) surface of -cristobalite, a DeRossi-
type two-bridged Cr(III) species was generated, cf.
Fig. 3C. This is later referred to as the (100)-DeRossi
model. Simulated annealing was performed with a [1,2,5]
super unit cell, with the cell parameter in the c-direction
increased to 48.7 A
˚ . To center the super unit cell about the
cluster region, the super cell was further expanded to
[2,4,5].
A three-bridged Cr(III) model was generated from the
(101) surface and denoted by (101)-3bridge, cf. Fig. 3D.
It was annealed using a [2,3,5] super unit cell, with a cell
parameter in the c-direction of 36.4 A
˚ .
A third systematic model was generated using a slab
model of the (111) surface of -cristobalite. The super
unit cell was taken as [2,2,5], and the cell parameter in the
c-direction was extended to 32.5 A
˚ . The three-bridge
chromium species results with chromium taking part in
rings containing 4, 5 and 6 silicon atoms, respectively. In
the cluster model, only the 6-ring is included, cf. Fig. 3E,
and the model is referred to by (111)-3bridge. The (111)-
3bridge site undergoes extensive relaxation when en-
gaged in reactions, giving rise to the modiﬁed site mod-
(111)- 3bridge shown in Fig. 3F.
At various points it will be instructive to consider these
models with a precoordinated Lewis donor, for simplicity
represented by a water molecule. The resulting models
are denoted by the labels deﬁned for each cluster,
preﬁxed by w.
COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
The quantum mechanical (QM) calculations have been
performed using density functional theory as implemen-
ted in the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) set of
programs.61,62 For electron correlation the LDA func-
tional of Vosko et al.63 augmented by the nonlocal 1986
corrections by Perdew64 were used. The exchange func-
tional consisted of the Slater term augmented by gradient
corrections as speciﬁed by Becke.65
Closed- and open-shell systems were described within
spin-restricted and -unrestricted formalisms, respectively.
The frozen-core approximation was used. Atomic cores
were deﬁned as the K-shell for ﬁrst-row atoms and K- and
L-shells for second- and third-row atoms. The number of
basis functions used to describe the valence atomic
orbitals were as follows: H 1s, 2; C 2s and 2p, 2; O 2s
and 2p, 3; Si 3s and 3p, 2; Cr 3s and 3p, 2; Cr 3d and 4s, 3;
and Cr 4p, 1. Polarization functions were added to all
atoms but chromium. A single set of d-type polarization
functions were added to C, O and Si, and a set of p
functions were added to H. A set of auxiliary atom-
centered s, p, d, f and g STO functions were used to ﬁt the
electron density as well as Coulomb and exchange
potentials.
Molecular geometries were converged to a gradient
below 0.001 EH (A
˚ )1 with the accuracy of the numerical
integration schemes adjusted accordingly. The transition-
state searches were typically conducted in two steps: a
linear transit scan followed by transition-state optimiza-
tion. The optimization was started from the highest point
on the linear-transit energy curve, using a Hessian matrix
calculated66 at the B3LYP67,68 level of theory in con-
junction with 3-21G atomic bases.
In general, energy differences refer to electronic de-
grees of freedom only, i.e. without zero-point vibrational
energies or temperature effects. For the dehydrogenation
reaction, C2H6 ! C2H4 þ H2, the change in electronic
energy is computed to 158 kJ mol1. However, in order
to take into account temperature and entropy effects, the
full set of thermodynamic functions were computed in
the harmonic and rigid-rotor approximation for simula-
tions based on the DeRossi-1 surface model. Maximal
accuracy of the numerical integration schemes was used.
All stationary structures display an ultrasoft vibrational
mode that has been consistently omitted from the har-
monic analysis. Tunneling corrections to the reaction
barriers pertaining to hydrogen transfer has been esti-
mated69 and found to be negligible.
Molecular mechanics computations were performed
using the General Utility Lattice Program (GULP).70,71
The shell model was used, but with shells only on
oxygen. H, Si, Cr(III) and Cr(II) were described as core
only. The Si and O potentials were parameterized for
silica structures by two of us.60 The H potential was
parameterized for link hydrogens in the QM-Pot QM–
MM program.60 Parameters for Cr(III) and Cr(II) are
taken from Binks.72
Molecular dynamics in conjunction with shell-model
potentials is used to obtain structurally relaxed slab
models of Cr-doped silica surfaces, see Plate 1 and e.g.
Ref. 55 for a broader introduction. The steps of the
procedure as applied here, are as follows. (i) Slab models
that expose low-index planes of crystalline low-cristoba-
lite crystal are prepared by the Cerius program.73 A super
unit cell is deﬁned to allow for relaxation at a larger
length scale as detailed below. (ii) To generate chromium

species with three oxygen linkages to the surface, one
Cr3þ ion is manually added per super unit cell in the
vicinity of (—O)3Si—O1 surface groups, with O2 and
Hþ ions added as needed to maintain neutrality. Simi-
larly, Cr2þ was used to generate chromium species with
two oxygen linkages to the surface. DeRossi-type Cr(III)
species were formed by adding a hydroxyl ligand to the
two-bridged chromium species. (iii) Each model is sub-
jected to simulated annealing in terms of NVT dy-
namics,59 i.e. the number of particles and the volume
are kept constant while the energy is allowed to ﬂuctuate
in equilibrium with a thermostated bath. The process
starts at 1500 K and the temperature is then lowered in
steps of 150 K until 0 K is reached. At each temperature,
NVT molecular dynamics is performed for 0.4 ps with
time steps of 0.0005 ps. (iv) Finally, the structure is
optimized under constant pressure conditions.
QM–MM geometry optimizations were performed
using the QM-Pot mechanical embedding program of
Sauer and Sierka.74 In this implementation, the total
energy to be minimized is given by Eqn (1).

The link atoms, i.e. the hydrogen atoms used to terminate
the dangling covalent bonds of the cluster, were placed
along the direction of the Ocluster—Sihost bond as
Ocluster—H—Sihost, at a ﬁxed distance of 0.9666 A
˚
from Ocluster. This is enforced during the QM–MM
geometry optimization. As a result the gradients on the
Ocluster—Sihost bonds are due only to the host MM
gradients.75
Shell-model potentials for the interaction between
transition metals and hydrocarbon ligands are not easily
constructed. In this work, ethane and fragments thereof
have been omitted from the MM potential expression.
Moreover, the long range electrostatic ﬁeld from the
region external to the cluster, is omitted from the QM
Hamiltonian. Ideally, at the center of the cluster, gradient
terms of the short-range MM potential cancel between
the host and cluster regions. The gradients close to the
center of the cluster are therefore mainly due to the
cluster QM term and the host MM long-range electro-
static term, and for atoms originating from ethane, only
QM gradient terms are taken into account.
To reduce the gradients as much as possible in the
cluster region, the QM–MM optimizations were per-
formed in the following sequence of steps. (i) The cluster
geometry is optimized at the QM level of theory, with
frozen coordinates of the boundary atoms. (ii) The full
slab model is optimized at the QM–MM level of theory,
until maximum and RMS gradients of the QM-Pot
gradient become of the order of 102 and 103 EH A
˚ 1,
respectively, at which point numerical noise leads to
oscillatory behavior. (iii) Atomic coordinates of substrate
atoms external to the cluster were kept frozen except for
silicon atoms neighboring the cluster, and the geometry
was further reﬁned until maximum and RMS gradients
drop below 2  103 and 2  104EH A
˚ 1, respectively.
RESULTS
Reactions on molecular cluster models
of DeRossi-type sites
For simplicity, a chromium site will be referred to by the
ligands in the ﬁrst coordination sphere of the metal.
For instance, a general DeRossi-type site is denoted by
(—O)2CrOH, where —O represents a generic oxygen
ligand singly bonded to chromium. The reaction scheme
of Fig. 2 is ﬁrst presented and analyzed using the
DeRossi-1 cluster model shown as Fig. 3A. For this
model, the free energy proﬁle of the catalytic reaction
is computed and used to identify the rate-determining
step. Subsequent models are then used to investigate the
importance of the constraints imposed by the silica sur-
face on the chromium site.
Reactions on the DeRossi-1 model. We have not
been able to locate any molecular complexes between
ethane and chromium on DeRossi-type Cr(III) sites. This
implies that the initial encounter is reactive rather than
physisorptive, contrary to the original proposal of
Weckhuysen et al.3 The initial reactive collision between
the (—O)2CrOH site and ethane is henceforth assumed to
follow a -bond metathesis mechanism, in which a C—H
bond in ethane and the Cr—OH bond of the DeRossi site
are broken and new ethyl—Cr and H—OH bonds are
formed.
On the DeRossi-1 model, the concerted breaking of
C—H and Cr—OH bonds and forming of ethyl—Cr
and H—OH bonds proceeds in a single elementary
reaction. The optimized structures of the stationary points
of the reaction are shown in Fig. 4. The transition state of
this ﬁrst reaction step has a well-deﬁned four-center
character, where chromium assists the transfer of hydro-
gen from ethane to the hydroxyl oxygen. The electronic
activation energy is computed to 138 kJ mol1, cf.
Table 2, only slightly higher than the enthalpy of activa-
tion (135 kJ mol1). According to Table 2, the entropic
contribution adds another 118 kJ mol1 at 500 C to the
free energy of activation, mainly due to loss of transla-
tional degrees of freedom. The newly formed water
molecule remains coordinated to the metal in the primary
product, and the free energy of reaction is þ178 kJ mol1.
Changes in free energy and enthalpy along the catalytic
cycle are shown graphically in Fig. 5, where the various
reaction steps are numbered according to Fig. 4.
The second reaction step involves transfer of a hydro-
gen atom to chromium from the -carbon, i.e. the methyl
end of the ethyl ligand, accompanied by release of
ethene, cf reaction 2 in Fig. 4. The reaction is found to

proceed uphill in energy almost all the way to the primary
product, in which ethene remains weakly bound. In terms
of electronic energies, the transition state of this reaction
step lies 79 kJ mol1 above that of the reactant ethylchro-
mium complex, and only 4 kJ mol1 higher in energy
than the product. At 500 C the difference in enthalpy
between transition state and product vanishes. This im-
plies that decoordination of ethene is essential to prevent
the hydrogen transfer reaction from running backwards.
The coordination enthalpy of ethene is computed to be
37 kJ mol1 cf. Table 2. However, there is an important
entropic driving force for desorption of ethylene, amount-
ing to 114 kJ mol1 at 500 C and decreasing with
temperature. The net change in free energy of step (2)
in Fig. 4 including release of ethene, thus becomes
slightly negative, at 6 kJ mol1. The position of the
activated complex is difﬁcult to ascertain in this case,
since it is given by the maximum in free energy which
most likely occurs somewhere along the path of deso-
rption of ethene. If the entropy increases signiﬁcantly
only after passing the transition state, the enthalpy of
activation may be estimated to 100 kJ mol1, by adding
the coordination energy of ethylene to the computed
barrier of -hydrogen transfer. This estimate is shown
as a dotted line in Fig. 5. In order to quantify the amount
by which the activation energy is lowered by entropic
effects, variational transition state theory (VTST)76 is
needed, which is considered outside to be the scope of
this work.
Once formed, the hydridochromium(III) complex is
highly reactive and can react with surface oxygen species
(XOH) under the release of molecular hydrogen, cf
Figure 4. Optimized stationary structures for the dehydrogenation reaction of ethane over the DeRossi-1 model catalyst. The
reaction steps are (1) C—H activation of ethane, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, (3) Cr—O

reaction (3) in Fig. 4. Potential reactants are water
(X ¼ H) or a vicinal surface silanol (X ¼ Si). The reaction
is energetically favorable, and in the case of a coordi-
nated water molecule, shown at the lower left of Fig. 4,
the enthalpy of reaction (3) is 58 kJ mol1. The activa-
tion enthalpy is computed to be 48 kJ mol1, which is low
compared with reaction barriers for the two preceding
steps.
From Fig. 5 it is evident that the second reaction step
represents the highest point on the free-energy proﬁle of
the (1,2,3) cycle and it is therefore rate determining. If, as
discussed above, the entropy increases signiﬁcantly only
after passing the transition state, the free energy of this
point is approximately given by the free energy of the
hydridochromium complex with ethene coordinated, plus
the enthalpy of desorption. This implies that the overall
kinetics of the catalytic cycle are determined by a free
energy of activation of 286 kJ mol1, and an overall
enthalpy of activation of 183 kJ mol1.
Alternatively, at a high pressure of ethane, the hydri-
dochromium complex formed in reaction (2) by -H
transfer to the metal, can conceivably engage in a
bimolecular -bond metathesis reaction with a second
molecule of ethane. This leads to the release of molecular
hydrogen, accompanied by the formation of an ethyl-
chromium(III) complex. Stationary points for this ele-
mentary reaction is shown as reaction (4) in Fig. 4. The
enthalpy of activation for this step is computed to be
74 kJ mol1 at the hydridochromium DeRossi-1 site. The
reaction enthalpy is 26 kJ mol1. Loss of translational
freedom as ethane chemisorbs leads to a high free energy
of activation of 201 kJ mol1. However, since H2 shows
no afﬁnity toward chromium and is released to the gas-
phase, the reaction is roughly isentropic.
At this point it seems that a bimolecular reaction
between a short-lived hydridochromium species and
ethane could form a viable route for C—H activation.
In turn, an alternative reaction mechanism to the one
shown in Fig. 2 could be postulated as a cyclic repetition
of reactions (2) and (4) in Fig. 4. The free energy and
enthalpy proﬁles of this cycle is shown in Fig. 6. The
highest point on the free-energy proﬁle is represented by
reaction (4), chemisorption of ethane is thus rate-deter-
mining. The activation free energy and enthalpy are,
respectively, 201 and 74 kJ mol1, which is considerably
lower than those of the (1,2,3) cycle. In this perspective,
reaction
(1)
describes
activation
of
a
dormant
(—O)2CrOH site and reaction (3) describes deactivation.
Dehydrogenation activity due to the alternative (4,2)
cycle
relies
entirely
on
the
population
of
hydri-
dochromium complexes on the surface. As the free
energy change of reaction (1) to form the ethylchromium
complex is computed to 178 kJ mol1, the population
appears to be small. However, for temperatures above
0 C, the water molecule formed in reaction (1) is likely
to desorb and to get ﬂushed downstream. Under dry
conditions, this means that the hydrido complex is
stabilized for stoichiometric reasons, and the (4,2) cycle
could become an important catalytic pathway of dehy-
drogenation, see Fig. 7. The activation enthalpy of this
cycle is computed to 74 or 69 kJ mol1, depending on the
presence or absence of a Lewis donor.

During the initial C—H activation step (1), the metath-
esis reaction may involve a Cr—O ester linkage to silica
rather than the hydroxyl oxygen. This would lead to the
formation of a surface silanol moiety instead of water.
Relative to the energy of the unreacted cluster and free
ethane, the electronic activation energy increases only by
some 10 kJ mol1, cf. Tables 4 and 5, and Fig. 8. The
silanol moiety coordinates only weakly to chromium, and
the electronic energy barrier toward the subsequent -
hydrogen transfer is 78 kJ mol1, essentially the same as
is discussed above. A notable difference, though, lies in
that the silanol is likely to remain in the vicinity of
chromium, yet less able than a water molecule to assume
an optimal coordination to chromium. The energy of the
ethyl- and hydridochromium complexes are elevated
about 50 kJ mol1 compared with the case when water
is formed in reaction (1), and coordinates to chromium.
This could lend additional importance to reaction (3), i.e.
regeneration of the chromium site with three covalent
oxygen ligands, both due to increased collision fre-
quency,
a
decrease
in
the
activation
energy
by
45 kJ mol1, and a large and negative entropic contribu-
tion to the free energy associated with release of H2 to the
gas phase. Turning to the alternative (4,2) catalytic cycle,
C—H activation according to reaction (4) at the hydri-
dochromium(III)(siloxy)(hydroxy) complex is found to
proceed with a modest electronic activation energy of
89 kJ mol1. However, taking into account the low
activation energy found for reaction (3), the (4,2) cycle
seems likely to be less important if the initial C—H
activation involves hydrogen transfer to an oxygen link-
age to silica.

The silica surface offers several types of oxygen
species that could act as Lewis bases to chromium,
including siloxanes, silanols and adsorbed water. To
identify any qualitative effect such a donor could have
on the dehydrogenation activity, a water molecule was
coordinated to chromium prior to the initial C—H
activation reaction (1). The labels of the resulting models
are preﬁxed by w. In the w-DeRossi-1 model, the Cr—
OH2 bond length is 2.69 A
˚ and water is bound by an
electronic coordination energy of 50 kJ mol1. The
Mulliken atomic charge on oxygen in the coordinated
water molecule is initially 0.53 e and remains between
0.44 and 0.47 e throughout the catalytic reaction. This
indicates that electrons are being donated to the
(—O)2CrR moiety. In terms of energies, the transition
states of reactions (1), (2) and (3) are all found to be sli-
ghtly stabilized relative to the ethyl and hydridochromium
complexes. This is also reﬂected in shorter Cr—OH2
bonds in the transition states than in the unreacted
clusters and reaction intermediates, indicating stronger
dative bonds. Thus it appears that the presence of Lewis
donors is likely to favor the dehydrogenation activity
rather than retard it. However, given the fairly low
coordination energy, only silanol groups are likely to
maintain a stable presence, in which case the lack of
structural ﬂexibility is likely to limit any stabilizing
effects on the reaction energy barriers.
Comparison between DeRossi-type models. As
detailed under models, we have examined three realiza-
tions of the Cr(III)G type surface site: DeRossi-1, (100)-
DeRossi and Cr(OH)3, cf. Fig. 3. They differ in sophis-
tication and ability to include constraints imposed by the
surface. The generic reaction scheme described above has
been explored and the results are summarized in terms of
reaction energy proﬁles in Figs. 8 and 9 and in Table 4.
The simple Cr(OH)3 model and the systematic (100)-
DeRossi model give about the same electronic energy
barrier for the C—H activation step (1) as already
reported for DeRossi-1. There is a trend of decreasing
coordination energy of the water molecule formed with
increasing O—Cr—O angle. This makes desorption of
water even more likely on the (100)-DeRossi model and
hence on DeRossi-type surface sites than discussed above.
Turning to -hydrogen transfer (2), the electronic
energy barrier is computed to 111 and 116 kJ mol1 on
the (100)-DeRossi and Cr(OH)3 models, respectively, to
be compared with 86 kJ mol1 on the DeRossi-1 model.
However, these barriers reﬂect the coordination energy of
ethene. Since loss of ethene is a prerequisite to stabilize the
product, it is more instructive to compare the sum of the
electronic activation energy and the energy of desorbing

ethene. The resulting values are 134kJ mol1 on DeRossi-
1 and (100)-DeRossi, and 125 kJ mol1 on Cr(OH)3. For
reaction (3), both activation energies and reaction energies
agree between the three models, cf. the entries in Table 4
that are superscripted by d.
Somewhat larger differences between the models were
computed for C—H activation of ethane over the hydri-
dochromium complexes according to reaction (4) in
Fig. 4. The electronic energy barriers were obtained as
71, 90 and 107 kJ mol1 respectively on the DeRossi-1,
(100)-DeRossi and Cr(OH)3 models without any specta-
tor water. The barrier decreases with increase in the
angular strain in the linkage of chromium to the substrate.
For the hydridochromium complex of the DeRossi-1,
(100)-DeRossi and Cr(OH)3 clusters, ﬀOCrO assumes
values of 111, 124 and 131, respectively, to be com-
pared with the corresponding values at the transitions
states, of 105, 115 and 105. Since the Cr(OH)3 model
displays completely relaxed bond angles, it is evident that
the decrease in reaction barrier with narrower ﬀOCrO is
due to destabilization of the reactant rather than stabiliza-
tion of the transition state.
Reactions over three-bridged Cr(III) surface sites
A second class of chromium surface sites related to the
DeRossi-type of sites is obtained by allowing three
oxygen atoms, rather than two, to form ester likages
between chromium and the silica surface. This class of
chromium species will be referred to as three-bridged
species. We have studied the same reaction mechanisms
as for the DeRossi-type models. A novel feature is that
during the initial C—H activation, reaction (1) in Fig. 10
and Fig. 12, a surface silanol rather than water is formed.
Depending on the strain in the Cr—O bond that is

away from chromium.
Three-bridged surface site on the (101) surface of
cristobalite. Our results are ﬁrst presented for the (101)
model of Fig. 3D. Energies are summarized in Table 5.
The energy proﬁle of the (1,2,3) cycle is shown in Fig. 11
as obtained for the (101)-3bridge site as well as the
DeRossi-1 model with the initial C—H activation step
involving a Cr—O ester linkage.
Activation of the three-bridged site according to (1) in
Fig.
10
takes
place
with
a
reaction
barrier
of
161 kJ mol1. The thus formed ethylchromium complex
has three stable conformations at energies of 109 to
120 kJ mol1 above that of the reactants. The energetics
of this reaction is similar to that computed for the
DeRossi-1 model when hydrogen is transferred to a
Cr—O ester linkage instead of to the hydroxyl ligand.
In two out of three conformations, the ethyl moiety
assumes a staggared conformation and the conformations
differ mainly with respect to how strongly the silanol is
coordinated to chromium. This is evident from Cr—
O(silanol) distances of 2.06 and 2.50 A
˚ , respectively. In
the third conformation, the ethyl ligand forms a second-
ary -agostic bond to the metal, and the r(Cr—O)
distance is 2.12 A
˚ .
The transition state of the subsequent -hydrogen
transfer, reaction (2), is 100 kJ mol1 higher in energy
than that of the most stable of the ethylchromium con-
formations. As for the DeRossi models, the transfer
reaction is instantly reversed unless ethene desorbs to
the gas phase. Moreover, in this particular case, the
optimized hydridochromium complex with weakly co-
ordinating ethene is slightly higher in energy than the
transiton state of the -hydrogen transfer, probably due to
minor conformational changes.
Addition of the decoordination energy of ethene places
the top point of the electronic energy proﬁle of reaction
(2) in Fig. 10 at 136 kJ mol1, about the same as for the
DeRossi models. The thus formed hydridochromium
complex displays a conformational equilibrium similar
to what was described for the ethyl complex. The pre-
sence of conformations with long Cr—silanol distances
could act to decrease the rate of deactivation of the
hydridochromium complex according to reaction (3) as
a result of decreased collision frequency. If the hydrido-
chromium complex lives sufﬁciently long, it could react
with ethane in a bimolecular -bond metathesis step, to
release molecular hydrogen to the gas phase and to
produce an ethylchromium site according to reaction
(4) in Fig. 10. The electronic energy barrier to C—H
activation is a low 67 kJ mol1 and the electronic energy
of the reaction is 21 kJ mol1, both numbers computed
relative to the reactants of reaction (4). However, the

electronic barrier of the unimolecular reaction (3) invol-
ving the silanol moiety formed in (1) is even lower, at a
mere 33 kJ mol1, cf. Table 5. The (101)-3bridge site is
then reproduced in a strongly exothermic reaction both in
terms of electronic energy and even more so in terms of
free energy.
Results presented thus far were based on cluster
models in which positions of the outer Si(OH)n groups
were frozen. Clearly, the rigidity of this model is ex-
aggerated. To improve our model, we include a mechan-
ical embedding of the cluster, thus allowing for relaxation
of the surface through optimization of all atomic posi-
tions. Some relaxation of the substrate is found to take
place, in particular when forming the chromiumethyl site
according to reaction (1). Here, surface relaxation stabi-
lizes the product by about 20 kJ mol1 relative to the
reactants. Importantly, the structures and relative energies
of the different conformations change only little, cf.
Table 5.
Three-bridged surface site on the (111) surface of
cristobalite. Starting from the (111)-surface of cristo-
balite, we prepared a three-bridged Cr(III) surface site
that is considerably more strained than what was found
for the (101) surface, cf. under Models. Noteworthy
features of this model are that chromium is stabilized
by donation from a siloxane moiety from beneath the
surface, and that one of the silicon atoms linked to
chromium, also takes part in a two-membered ring, see
Fig. 3E.
Unlike the (101)-model, inclusion of mechanical em-
bedding leads to results that are qualitatively different
from those obtained for the naked cluster. For instance,
starting from the cluster-optimized structure of the pro-
duct of reaction (1), i.e. an ethylchromium complex with
a nearby surface silanol, optimization at the QM–MM
level of theory makes the Cr-silanol distance increase to
more than 5 A
˚ as the surface relaxes, see Fig. 13. The
optimization then breaks down as the double siloxane
bridge is ruptured in favor of single siloxane bridges,
leaving the cluster termination invalid. Evidently, at
strained surface sites such as modelled here, chemical
activation of bonds linking chromium to the substrate can
lead to irreversible surface relaxation.
In order to estimate reaction barriers, we have used
several cluster models, each based on reactant structures
that have been relaxed at the QM–MM level of theory.
These models are likely to provide an upper estimate of
the activation energies. For reaction (1) in Fig. 12, the
barrier to C—H activation is found to be 80 kJ mol1.
This number can be compared with 161 kJ mol1 for the
(101) three-bridge site, and 120–150 kJ mol1 for various
DeRossi-type sites, and it is apparently very low. A
possible reason could be extra stabilization of the transi-
tion state by the sub-surface siloxane coordinating to
chromium. This hypothesis was explored using a cluster
model in which the coordinating siloxane was removed,
see
Fig.
3F.
The
activation
energy
increases
to
100 kJ mol1 on this modiﬁed model, which points to a
stabilization of the transition state by 20 kJ mol1, similar
to what was found for Lewis donors on DeRossi-type
sites. The low activation energy of the initial -bond
metathesis step is therefore mainly ascribed to the
strained geometry of the reactant chromium site.
As the Cr—O bond is broken, the thus-formed silanol
group relaxes into a position removed from Cr, see
Fig. 12. The remaining ethylchromium surface complex
resembles that of DeRossi-type models after desorption
of water. To study subsequent steps in the reaction cycle,
a new cluster model was deﬁned from the QM–MM-
relaxed structure, see Fig. 3F. The remote silanol group is
not included.
Relative to the ethylchromium complex of the modi-
ﬁed cluster model, the electronic energy barrier of the -
hydrogen transfer step (2) is computed to 103 kJ mol1.
Throughout the reaction, the sub-surface siloxane donor
has a dynamic behavior and assumes a position farthest to
chromium at the transition state. Again, there is only a
very shallow minimum for the hydridochromium com-
plex as long as ethene remains coordinated, and a better

measure of the energy requirement of this step is obtained
by
adding
the

energy
of
ethene
(40 kJ mol1) to the electronic energy barrier. The
energy barrier toward C—H activation at the hydrido-
chromium complex is computed to 85 kJ mol1 relative
to the energies of the reactants. Thus, apart from the ease
with which the initial C—H activation reaction (1) takes
place, the energy changes associated with dehydrogena-
tion at the (111)-3bridge site are similar to those asso-
ciated with the more relaxed (101)-3bridge and (100)-
DeRossi models, cf. Fig. 13.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this work is to obtain an understanding of the
relationship between the structure of Cr–silica surface
sites and their ability to dehydrogenate ethane. Since our
results rely on the validity of the adopted models of Cr–
silica surface species, the models are ﬁrst discussed on the
basis of what is known from other studies of amorphous
silica in general and the Cr-silica surface in particular.
We have applied both ad hoc cluster models and cluster
and slab models based on the cristobalite structure. The
simpler models have been validated by comparison with
slab models for reactant and product structures, but not
for transition states. At the transition state of reaction (1),
i.e. C—H activation according to -bond metathesis, the
Cr—O distances are close to their equilibrium values and
little relaxation is expected on the silica part. This means
that the forward barrier of this reaction step is expected to
be fairly insensitive to surface relaxation, whereas the
barrier to reforging a Cr—OSi bond could be under-
estimated by 10–20 kJ mol1. For elementary steps not
involving breaking of oxygen bridges, i.e. -hydrogen
transfer and C—H activation at the hydridochromium
species, surface and bulk relaxation is small.
Gibbs free energies have been computed only for
reactions on the DeRossi-1 model and used to locate
the
rate-determining
steps.
For
the
other
models,
comparisons have been made on the basis of electronic
energies. Entropic and temperature contributions to free
energies are dominated by translational and rotational
contributions, which are independent of the surface
model. When comparing different surface sites, the
differential contribution from zero-point vibrational en-
ergies is expected to be small relative to the differences in
electronic energies.
The use of cristobalite to model amorphous silica is
well precedented.52–54,77 This structure consists of six-
membered rings of silicon tetrahedra. Following simu-
lated annealing, the six-membered rings still dominate in
the bulk, although there are some occurrences of three-
membered rings. The surfaces consist of six-, four-,
three- and even two-membered rings, counting only the
silicon atoms. The existence of two-membered rings on
amorphous silica surfaces is controversial but also ob-
served in other simulation studies.53,54,78,79 It has been
suggested that the absorption at 450 cm1 observed in the
Raman spectrum of vitreous silica could be due to two-
membered rings.53,78 Two-membered rings are also
claimed to have been observed by 29Si NMR.80,81 Bulk
amorphous silica shows no long-range regularity,82 in
contrast to our slab models, which show translational
symmetry by way of construction. Owing to the localized
character of the chemical interaction, we do not believe
that this is an important limitation in the applied models.
As outlined in the Introduction, chromium is believed
to be anchored to the silica surface through one or more
oxygen bridges, formed in a reaction with surface sila-
nols.5–7 Hakuli et al.24 observed a decrease in the number
of isolated silanol groups during the calcination step of
catalyst preparation. This might indicate that the chro-
mium precursor reacts with isolated silanol groups.
Alternatively, under wet conditions vicinal silanol groups
could be formed through hydration of surface Si—O
bonds.54,83 Two-membered rings are the more reactive,54
and hydration followed by anchoring of chromium would
result in surface species similar to that of the DeRossi-1
and model, cf. Fig. 3. The analogous reaction sequence
on a three-membered ring would lead to a two-bridged
chromium species similar to that of the (101)-DeRossi
model.
On defects of crystalline silicalite, most notably those
missing silicon atoms, nests of hydroxyl groups are
formed.84 With several silanol groups in close vicinity,
formation of triply-bridged chromium species becomes a
distinct possibility, corresponding to our (101)-3bridge

ethane over the (100)-DeRossi model without a spectator
water (dashed), the (101)-3bridge model (dashed, open
circles) and the mod- (111)-3bridge model (dotted, squares).
The reaction steps are (4) C—H activation of ethane with
subsequent loss of H2 and (2) -H transfer to chromium with
subsequent loss of ethene. The energies are given in
kJ mol1 relative to that of separated ethane and hydrido-

model. Strained three-bridged species as in the (111)-
3bridge model, are less likely for enthalpic reasons, as
they would be unstable toward surface reorganization. On
the other hand, it is a well-known aspect of catalysis that
minority species associated with defects could be respon-
sible for the observed activity.
Reports on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of
alkanes over Cr–oxide catalysts pertain mainly to
alumina, and no reports have been found for the case of
silica. However, differences in activity as observed be-
tween the various substrates are often discussed in view
of their capability to stabilize similar active species25
rather than to open radically different reaction paths. We
are presently extending our work to the Cr–alumina
system, which in time will allow us to address this
conjecture. At present, we will discuss our results on
the background of observations made for different Cr–
oxide systems, most notably Cr–alumina.
DeRossi et al.13,26,27 concluded that only mononuclear
chromium species are required for the reaction. On this
basis we have studied the mechanism put forth by
Burwell et al.37 and Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt.3
The proposal involves the following four steps: (0)
physisorption of ethane on coordinatively unsaturated
Cr(III)-centers; (1) activation of a C—H bond, accom-
panied by formation of O—H and Cr—C bonds; (2)
alkene formation through -hydrogen transfer; (3) regen-
eration of the catalytic surface through the formation of
H2. Apart from the initial physisorption of ethane on Cr,
this mechanism amounts to steps 1–3 in Fig. 2.
Our calculations show that the coordination energy of
ethane to chromium is negligible, and that the same
applies to H2. Even at the more polar alumina surface,
taking into account the elevated temperatures at which
the reaction takes place, it appears that adsorption would
require a reactive collision of ethane on the chromium
site, making the C—H activation step follow Eley–
Rideal kinetics. With this modiﬁcation, our results show
that a cycle consisting of the three last steps does indeed
constitute a viable mechanism.
C—H activation is energetically costly with a reaction
barrier in the range 120–160 kJ mol1. Unless surface
strain acts to weaken the Cr—O bond, the strengths of the
involved bonds are such that the reaction becomes highly
endothermic. Furthermore, at high temperatures, surface-
catalyzed reactions are partially driven by increase in
entropy upon desorption of product molecules. The
(1,2,3) cycle involves two elementary reactions before
ethene desorbs as the ﬁrst product molecule. The free
energy increases until this happens, which makes reaction
(2) rate determining. The overall free energy and en-
thalpy of activation are correspondingly relatively high.
The activation free energy of the (1,2,3) cycle as
computed for the DeRossi-1 model and C—H activation
involving the hydroxyl ligand, is computed in the range
266–286 kJ mol1, depending on the point at which the
entropy increases associated with desorption of ethene
start to outweigh the losses in coordination energy.
However, the water formed in reaction (1) on DeRossi
species is likely to desorb, thus preventing regeneration
of the chromium species. Activity due to the (1,2,3) cycle
is therefore more likely to involve Cr—O ester linkages
to the surface, with formation of a silanol moiety during
the initial C—H activation step. In this case, weak
coordination of silanol to the metal results in a higher
electronic energy of the ethyl complex and consequently
also of the rate-determining step of the cycle, which
involves -hydrogen transfer and ethene desorption.
The increase in energy amounts to about 50 kJ mol1,
which appears also in the overall enthalpy and free
energy of activation. The lowest values of activation
enthalpy and free energy of the (1,2,3) cycle are thus in
the order of 200 and 300 kJ mol1, respectively. This
gives
a
reaction
rate
constant
in
the
order
of
5:5  109 mol1 m3 s1 per (—O)3Cr species at 500 C.
An alternative mechanism is apparent from our calcu-
lations, in which H2 formation and C—H activation take
place in a second, concerted reaction between chromium
and ethane. Since C—H activation takes place at the
reactive hydride complex rather than at a fairly stable
chromium species with three oxygen ligands, the activa-
tion barrier for C—H activation becomes markedly
lower. Still, the entropy loss associated with chemisorp-
tion of ethane contributes to make C—H activation the
rate determining step for the (4,2) cycle. On the DeRossi-
1 model and in the absence of a spectator water ligand,
the
activation
free
energy
of
the
(4,2)
cycle
is
181 kJ mol1, corresponding to a rate constant at 500 C
of 0.6 mol1 m3 s1 per hydridochromium complex. The
second of the two steps in this mechanism is -hydrogen
transfer to the metal, to form ethene and to regenerate
the hydride. The same reaction step in reverse has
previously been proposed for the initiation
phase
during Phillips polymerization.85 Considering the simi-
larity of the preparation of these systems it is not
unlikely that the same elementary step is present in
both reactions, with the direction governed by the stoi-
chiometry of the feed.
Using propane pressure of 5 kN m2 in ﬂow experi-
ments at 500 C, a turnover frequency in the order of 103
molecules s1 per surface Cr atom was observed on Cr–
silica.13 On the basis of our computed free energies of
activation, turnover frequencies in the order of 101
molecules
s1
per
hydridochromium
complex
are
obtained for the (4,2) cycle and 109 molecules s1 per
(—O)3Cr species for the (1,2,3) cycle.
Converting to overall activation enthalpies, we have
found the activation energy to be in excess of 200 and
70 kJ mol1, respectively for the (1,2,3) and (4,2) cycles.
For comparison, activation energies of 88  10 kJ mol1
on Cr–silica, 67  10 kJ mol1 on Cr–alumina, 76 
10 kJ mol1 on -chromia have been reported for the
dehydrogenation of propane.13 All are comparable to
that of the (4,2) cycle. However, an activation energy of

about 140 kJ mol1 is reported for dehydrogenation of
isobutane on Cr–alumina.86
The mechanism of C—H activation is a crucial ques-
tion in the dehydrogenation mechanism. Several workers
have proposed C—H activation to involve a Cr—O
pair.3,13,26,36,37 An indication that this could be the case is
that hydridochromium and surface hydroxy groups were
detected by IR upon dosage of hydrogen over chromia.87
In another study, the Cr–zirconia catalyst has been found
to be poisoned by Kþ, possibly due to coordination to
oxygen atoms near Cr to the extent that C—H activation
is prevented.88 On the Cr–alumina system, rearrangement
of the surface is observed upon exposure to dehydrogena-
tion conditions.13 This could indicate irreversible loss of
Cr—O bonds, preventing reaction (3) in Figs. 2 and 10.
Puurunen et al.34 performed dehydrogenation experi-
ments with chromium deposited on alumina surfaced
by aluminum nitride. While the replacement of oxygen
by the more basic nitrogen was expected to increase the
probability of dissociation of the alkane, and thereby the
rate of dehydrogenation, the opposite was found. These
workers concluded that nearby oxygen may be required
to obtain chromium sites with high activity. An alter-
native explanation could be that in the dominant catalytic
cycle of elementary reactions, C—H activation does not
involve a structural anionic ligand, but rather a hydride.
In this case the vicinity to chromium of the ligand—H
group formed in reaction (1) will determine the activity as
the hydride is easily consumed in reaction (3) unless the
ligand—H group is removed from chromium. In turn,
this may lend support to the (4,2) cycle.
In kinetic modeling of the dehydrogenation reaction of
isobutane on Cr–alumina, it was found that adsorption
parameters of both isobutane and H2 had to be included to
describe the reaction rate satisfactorily.36 It was proposed
that adsorption might include a Cr—O pair, as shown in
steps (1) and (3) of Figs. 2 and 10. Moreover, adsorption
of the alkane was found to be rate determining. In our
computations the surface reaction (2) of -hydrogen
transfer appears rate-determining for the (1,2,3) cycle.
This could suggest that on the more polar alumina sur-
face, the hydridochromium( ethene) species is consider-
ably stabilized as compared with Cr–silica. Alternatively,
activity is largely due to the (4,2) cycle, of which
C—H activation is found to be rate determining.
Although activation at a hydridochromium complex
was not considered in the study of Airaksinen et al.,36
the necessity to include adsorption parameters of both
isobutane and H2 to describe satisfactorily the reaction
rate, is consistent with the reversibility of reaction (4),
C—H activation at a hydridochromium complex.
Prevention of reaction (3), reforging of the Cr—O
bond, is a prerequisite for anything but sporadic activity
of the (4,2) cycle and appears to be very sensitive to the
local surrounding of chromium. DeRossi-type species are
favorable in the sense that any water molecule formed in
the initial C—H/Cr—O activation step, is likely to
desorb and thereby render regeneration of the Cr—OH
bond and thus termination of the (4,2) cycle unlikely, see
Fig. 7. On the three-bridged surface species, a silanol
group is made in the initial C—H/Cr—O activation.
Depending on the geometric constraints on the chromium
site, reformation of the Cr—O bond could be facile or
difﬁcult. For a fairly relaxed surface species, the silanol
group is likely to stay coordinated to chromium. The
average number of turns of the (4,2) cycle before deac-
tivation according to reaction (3) is probably higher for
strained (—O)3Cr species where the silanol group re-
laxes away from chromium, see Fig. 12.
Small amounts of water on the surface have been found
to be detrimental to the dehydrogenation activity.88 This
has been ascribed to competing coordination on chro-
mium or rearrangement of the surface following hydra-
tion of oxygen bridges linking chromium to the surface.86
The observation is also consistent with the (4,2) cycle of
Fig. 4 being more active than the (1,2,3) cycle, since
addition of water would remove any hydridochromium
sites. Since both hydrogen atoms are predicted to origi-
nate from the same ethane according to the (1,2,3) cycle
and from two different ethane molecules in the (4,2)
cycle, these mechanisms can be distinguished in isotopic
labeling experiments.
CONCLUSIONS
Mechanistic aspects of dehydrogenation of ethane over
mononuclear Cr(III)–silica have been studied by means
of quantum chemistry. A family of cluster models have
been generated based on the conceptual idea of mono-
nuclear Cr(III) with three covalent ligands that coordinate
through oxygen, as exempliﬁed by the Cr(III)G structure
earlier proposed by DeRossi et al.,13 cf. Fig. 1. For the
main reaction steps investigated, the various models
provide consistent reaction energy proﬁles.
A reaction mechanism consisting of the following
three reaction steps is found to be viable: (1) C—H
activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis,
accompanied by formation of O—H and Cr—C bonds,
(2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of
ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site by
means of -bond metathesis with subsequent loss of H2.
Apart from the absence of molecular adsorption of
ethane, the cycle consisting of reactions (1–3) agrees
with earlier proposals.3,37 Regeneration of the catalytic
cite according to reaction (3) requires the initial C—H
activation step to involve a Cr—O ester linkage to the
surface. Based on free-energy calculations, the second
reaction step, involving -hydrogen transfer to the metal,
is found to be rate determining. Activation free energy
and enthalpy are computed in excess of 300 and
200 kJ mol1, respectively.
Based on the computed energies, an alternative me-
chanism is formulated in which C—H activation takes

place at a reactive hydridochromium complex formed in
reaction (2) (above), rather than at more stable chromium
species with three oxygen ligands. Key features of this
mechanism are the formation of H—H and Cr—C bonds
by means of -bond metathesis and that C—H activation
becomes rate determining. The computed activation
enthalpy
is
approximately
70 kJ mol1,
i.e.
some
130 kJ mol1 less than computed for the mechanism
proposed in Refs. 3 and 37. The importance of this
alternative mechanism relies on the ability to maintain
a reactive hydridochromium site, i.e. to prevent formation
of more stable species in which chromium is covalently
bonded to three oxygen ligands. This ability is a sensitive
function of the local structure about chromium. On
DeRossi-type species, the water molecule formed in
reaction (1) is likely to desorb, thus making reformation
of the Cr—O bond less likely. On chromium species with
three Cr—O ester linkages to the surface, a silanol
moiety, rather than water, is made in the initial C—H/
Cr—O activation. At fairly strained surface sites, the
silanol can relax away from chromium, and thus hinder
reformation of the Cr—O bond. On the other hand, if the
silanol moiety remains loosely coordinated to chromium,
one must expect facile regeneration of the Cr—O bond
according to reaction (3) above.
It is conceivable that both mechanisms are at work in
active catalysts. The presence of traces of moisture in the
feed will terminate the hydride-based mechanism. Spe-
ciﬁc details in the drying and calcination procedures may
inﬂuence the geometrical strain of mononuclear Cr(III)
sites and thereby also the effective mechanism for
dehydrogenation.
