A Cr/Al2O3 alkane dehydrogenation catalyst exhibits a maximum in ethylene yield during an ethane dehydrogenation cycle.
Isotopic labelling experiments with monolabelled 13C-ethane and deuterium were used to elucidate whether the initial activity
increase could be due to formation of an active, larger hydrocarbon intermediate on the surface. The results strongly indicate that
this is not the case, and instead point to a traditional reaction cycle involving adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species,
followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step
of reaction.

1. Introduction
The catalytic production of light alkenes is of key
importance to the development of chemical industries
since it provides an opportunity to high-purity pro-
pylene, which is of direct use in the production of
polypropylene. High-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have
shown to be very active and selective in this reaction
and are industrially used at dehydrogenation plants all
over the world [1–3]. The increasing demand for pro-
pene due to the growing polypropylene market, the
related use of this catalytic system as well as the cata-
lyst complexity have initiated many research activities
in both academia and chemical industries. In the last
decade a signiﬁcant amount of knowledge has been
gathered regarding the molecular structure of sup-
ported chromium oxides, the nature of the active
chromium oxide site and the possible short- and long-
term deactivation routes [4–10].
Surprisingly, not much studies have been devoted to
the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this
industrially important catalytic system. The group of
Burwell did seminal work in the 1960s on Cr2O3 by
using
D-labelled
hydrocarbons
and
deuterium
D2
[11,12]. Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, there are
no similar studies for supported chromium oxide cata-
lysts. Indeed, only scattered information about the
alkane dehydrogenation mechanism is available for
chromium-on-alumina and chromium-on-zirconia sys-
tems, and none at all for silica-supported chromium
oxide catalysts. In all these catalyst systems, a Cr–O
moiety with chromium in its tri- or divalent state is
envisaged as the active site for C–H activation. Figure 1
shows the dehydrogenation mechanism based on such
mononuclear Cr3+-O site supported on a high-surface
oxide, as recently discussed by Lillehaug et al. [13]. The
activation of the C–H bond starts with the reaction of
the alkane with a coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+
centre leading to the formation of a new O–H group and
a Cr-alkyl bond. The alkene is then formed as a result
from a hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to Cr, and this
reaction is thought to be rate determining. The reaction
cycle is completed by the formation of H2 and the
regeneration of the Cr3+-O active site. A possible, par-
allel mechanism involves addition of ethane to a hydri-
dochromium site, formed in the ﬁrst cycle, leading to the
formation of Cr-Ethyl and molecular H2. The reaction
cycle is completed by b-H transfer to Cr and ethene
desorption.
In recent years, it has been suggested that coke
deposits could also be active in alkane dehydrogenation
reactions. More speciﬁcally, it has been shown by the
group of Schlogl that carbon nanomaterials are very
active catalyst materials in the oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of ethylbenzene to styrene [14,15]. This observation
is further supported by our own ﬁndings that with a Cr/
Al2O3 catalyst, a maximum in propene yield during a
propane dehydrogenation cycle is achieved after about
20 min-on-stream [16–18]. This observation could be
explained by initial formation of carbon deposits by the
supported chromium oxide species. The formed coke
could then possess activity in the dehydrogenation of
propane. However, another plausible explanation for
this phenomenon could be the enhanced adsorption of
propane near the active site once small amounts of coke

are formed at the catalyst surface. Once too much coke
is formed, the active dehydrogenation site is less acces-
sible and as a consequence the propylene yield decreases.
The goal of this paper is twofold. First of all, we
would like to elucidate if carbon deposits are indeed
active in the dehydrogenation of ethane. For this pur-
pose, we have conducted isotopic labelling experiments
for an ethane dehydrogenating Cr/Al2O3 catalyst mak-
ing use of labelled 13C-ethane and deuterium. Secondly,
the data obtained allow us to extend the work of Burwell
[11,12] to alumina-supported chromium oxide catalysts
and discuss the obtained insights in relation with the
recently published theoretical study by Lillehaug et al.
on the same reaction system [13].
2. Experimental
Catalytic tests were carried out in a tubular ﬁxed bed
quartz reactor with inner diameter 7 mm. The temper-
ature in the catalyst bed was measured by a thermo-
couple contained in a quartz thermocouple well (outer
diameter 3 mm), which was placed directly under the
catalyst bed. The alumina-supported chromium oxide
catalyst
(13 wt%
Cr/Al2O3,
200 mg,
0.25–0.42 mm
particle size) was pretreated by heating to 580 C in He
stream and exposure to 20% O2/He for 30 min at
580 C before ﬂushing with He. Details of the catalyst
system can be found elsewhere [16–18]. Unless otherwise
speciﬁed, the reaction mixture was composed of 2 Nml/
min C2H6 and 20 Nml/min He. Catalyst regeneration
was performed by exposure to a 20% O2/He stream for
30 min at 580 C. Using Brooks mass ﬂow meters the
composition of the feed gas was controlled. Transient
experiments were performed by switching a 4-way,
He-actuated valve (Valco Inc.) between two sets of
feed lines, before the reactor. Feed and product gas
composition was analyzed by using an on-line HP Quad
Micro-Gas
Chromatograph
(GC)
with
3
separate
channels
containing
Molsieve-5A
˚ ,
PoraPlot-U
and
AluminaPlot columns, respectively, and thermal con-
ductivity detectors. The mass spectrum of the reactor
eﬄuent was continuously monitored by using an on-line
Pfeiﬀer Omnistar Mass Spectrometer. The isotopic
composition of each gas component was determined by
using an oﬀ-line HP 6890 GC with a GS GasPro column
and a HP 5973 Mass Selective Detector.
Isotopic labeling experiments were performed after
pretreatment and exposure to the standard reactant
mixture for 10–20 min at 580 C, followed by ﬂushing in
He. D2 gas (99.8%) was obtained from Linde Gas AG.
Monolabelled ethane (1)13C, 99%) was obtained from
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. Simulated mass
fragmentation spectra were calculated by assuming a
statistical distribution of corresponding fragments (such
as C2H3
+ versus C2H2D+), not taking into account
kinetic isotope eﬀects.
Used Cr/Al2O3 catalyst was studied in a JEOL 2010F
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) with a ﬁeld
emission gun operated at 200 kV. The microscope
was ﬁtted with a Noran Vantage DI+ energy dipersive
X-ray system. Samples were prepared by crushing in
ethanol in an agate mortar and deposited on a carbon
ﬁlm suspended on a copper mesh.

Major
by-products are methane and C4
+ hydrocarbons. CO2
formation (1% selectivity) is observed initially, but
decreases to undetectable values after 5 min on stream.
This can be explained by the reduction of surface Cr6+
by ethane resulting in the initial formation of CO2.
Mass fragmentation spectra from a D2 addition
experiment
(C2H6:D2:He=2:1:20 Nml/min,
580 C,
15% ethane conversion) are shown in ﬁgure 3. The
spectra for unlabelled compounds are included for
comparison. Simulated mass fragmentation spectra are
also shown. The results indicate that only a minor
fraction of ethane (4%) experiences H–D exchange, and
that only one H is exchanged for D in each of the
labelled molecules (ﬁgure 3a). For ethene, a larger
fraction of the molecules contains D. The simulated
spectrum indicates that the abundances of ethene are:
89% C2H4, 10% C2H3D, 1% C2H2D2 (ﬁgure 3b).
Results from a transient experiment in which the
Ethane/He+Ar feed was switched to He+Ne, are
shown in ﬁgure 4. A rapid decline in all masses is
observed.
Mass fragmentation spectra from an experiment in
which the catalyst was ﬁrst exposed to 12C-ethane under
standard conditions, then ﬂushed with He until no 28
peak was observed in the mass spectrometer, and ﬁnally

ethane,
13CH3
12CH3
(C2H6:He=2:20 Nml/min, 580 C, 20% ethane con-
version), are shown in ﬁgure 5. The mass fragments of
ethane (ﬁgure 5a) and ethene (ﬁgure 5b) are both shifted
one mass unit higher after introduction of 1)13C ethane
compared to 12C ethane. No change in the fragmenta-
tion pattern is observed with time (30–180 s after on-set
of the 1)13C ethane feed).
A representative TEM image of the used Cr/Al2O3
catalyst is shown in ﬁgure 6. Cr is observed in small
crystallites with average diameter around 10 nm. This
corresponds to a Cr dispersion of 14%, assuming that
the crystallites are composed of Cr2O3. Formation of a
Cr–O monolayer on the alumina surface, as proposed by
Hakuli et al. [16] would further increase the dispersion.
EDS analysis could not conﬁrm whether such a layer is
present on our catalyst sample.
4. Discussion
Recent work on propane dehydrogenation over sup-
ported chromium oxide catalysts has indicated that, in
addition to Cr6+ reduction, formation of hydrocarbon
species on the catalyst surface may contribute to the
initial activity increase observed [17–19]. The catalytic
test results reported in ﬁgure 1 are in line with the pre-
vious results, since the activity increase continues after
the COx formation has vanished. One of the aims of this
work is to elucidate whether the observed activity
increase may be related to the formation of active
intermediates on the catalyst surface, or whether the
mechanism of ﬁgure 1 prevails. The results of the tran-
sient experiment (ﬁgure 4) show that the residence time
of any ethene-forming intermediate on the catalyst sur-
face is very short. If an oligomer or aromatic compound
were an intermediate in ethene formation, isotopic
scrambling of ethene would be expected to occur within
the order of seconds during the 1)13C ethane experi-
ment (ﬁgure 5). No indication of isotopic scrambling is
observed during the ﬁrst 180 s after onset of the 1)13C
ethane feed. This is most readily seen from the absence
of any 13C2H4 (m/z 30) or 13C2H6 formation (m/z 32)
(The small peaks observed for m/z 30 and m/z 32,
respectively, correspond to the 1.1% natural abundance
of 13C in carbon). This result strongly suggests that such
intermediates are not part of the reaction cycle leading
to ethene formation.
The results observed during the ethane-D2 experi-
ments show that only one H is exchanged for D in
ethane. This observation points to an end-on, dissocia-
tive adsorption of ethane on the catalyst surface. This
observation is in line with results reported by Burwell

et al. for higher alkanes on Cr2O3 [12] and the recent
theoretical work of Lillehaug et al. [13]. The absence of
bi-deuterated ethane, as would be expected for ethene
hydrogenation in the presence of D2 [12], further indi-
cates that there is little back formation of ethane from
ethene under the applied reaction conditions. Ethene
experiences more H–D exchange than ethane, and
signiﬁcantly more mono- than bi-deuterated ethene
molecules are observed. This observation may indicate
that ethene is adsorbed end-on as an ethyl entity on a
Cr3+-O moiety, which may either be further hydroge-
nated to ethane, or, preferably, dehydrogenated back to
ethene. Another explanation may be that ethene is
deuterated, and subsequently deprotonated, on Brøns-
ted-acid sites on the Al2O3 support, as has been
observed by Amenomiya [20].
The short residence times for surface intermediates,
as indicated by the transient experiment (ﬁgure 4), are of
interest also for a discussion of the rate-determining step
of reaction. 20% ethane conversion, as is typically
observed in our experiments, corresponds to a reaction
rate of 0.3 lmol ethene/s. The catalyst loading (200 mg)
and calculated Cr dispersion (14%) correspond to
exposure of 70 lmol Cr atoms. The apparent turn-over
frequency (TOF) is thus 0.004 s)1 at 580 C. If an ele-
mentary

intermediate (b-H transfer or ethene desorption) were
the rate-determining step, the intermediate would have a
residence time of nearly 4 min on the surface. This is far
from the observed situation, where no signiﬁcant dif-
ference is observed between the tailing of the m/e 27 and
m/e 28 fragments. (As evidenced by the fragmentation
patterns shown in ﬁgure 3, the presence of ethene-
forming intermediates on the surface would lead to a
delay in the tailing of the m/e 27 fragment compared to
the m/e 28 fragment during the transient.) Repeating the
experiment at 500 C gave the same result. In conclu-
sion, the transient experiments indicate that neither b-H
transfer of an ethyl species, nor ethene desorption, is the
rate-limiting step of reaction. This result is diﬀerent
from that reported by Kao et al. for isobutane dehy-
drogenation over pure Cr2O3, where b-H transfer was
concluded to be the rate-determining step [21]. In fact,
since the rate constant of desorption may be expressed
as: k=m*exp ()Ed/RT), where m, the frequency factor of
surface intermediates, is normally in the order of
1013 s)1, the observed TOF would necessitate an acti-
vation energy of 251 kJ/mol in order for desorption of
any surface species to be the rate-limiting step. This
number is signiﬁcantly higher than that reported for
ethane dehydrogenation over a similar Cr/SiO2 catalyst,
i.e., 117 kJ/mol [22]. Together, when assuming that all
surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this
work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting
step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. Turning again
to the recent theoretical work of Lillehaug et al. [13], this
conclusion would favour the hydridocomplex route, in
which ethane is adsorbed onto a Cr–H site, leading to
the formation of Cr–C2H5 and a hydrogen molecule,
with subsequent reformation of Cr–H and release of
ethene.
5. Conclusions
The following conclusions can be drawn from this
work:
(1) Ethane dehydrogenation of supported chromium
oxide catalysts proceeds via an end-on, dissociative
adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+–O active site at the
catalyst surface. This experimental ﬁnding conﬁrms
the results reported by Burwell et al. for higher
