[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. It involves four main steps: activation of hydrogen by the catalyst, breaking of the C-H bond, formation of an intermediate, and final product formation."
[2] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is primarily focused on the activation of hydrogen and the breaking of the C-H bond. Some researchers argue that the activation of hydrogen is the rate-limiting step, while others believe the breaking of the C-H bond is more critical."
[3] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the detailed mechanisms involved in each step are not fully understood, and the relative importance of each step varies depending on the specific conditions of the reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps: hydrogen activation by the catalyst, C-H bond cleavage, intermediate formation, and product formation. There is an ongoing scientific debate about which of these steps is rate-limiting, particularly concerning hydrogen activation and C-H bond cleavage. The mechanism continues to be a subject of interest and controversy due to the incomplete understanding of the detailed mechanisms within each step and the varying importance of each step based on the specific reaction conditions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：氢气激活、C-H键断裂、中间体形成和产物形成。关于哪个步骤是决定速率的关键，科学界存在着持续的争议，特别是关于氢气激活和C-H键断裂的重要性。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但该机制仍是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为对每个步骤的详细机制了解不充分，并且每个步骤的重要性根据反应的具体条件而变化。
