<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four primary stages. These stages involve the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, the activation of the molecule, the disruption of bonds within the molecule, and the desorption of the product molecule. The persistent dispute about which stage is rate-limiting arises from the intricacy of the reaction pathway and the interactions between the various stages. Despite almost a century of investigation, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to be a subject of scientific interest and debate.

[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. It involves four main steps: activation of hydrogen by the catalyst, breaking of the C-H bond, formation of an intermediate, and final product formation."
[2] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is primarily focused on the activation of hydrogen and the breaking of the C-H bond. Some researchers argue that the activation of hydrogen is the rate-limiting step, while others believe the breaking of the C-H bond is more critical."
[3] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the detailed mechanisms involved in each step are not fully understood, and the relative importance of each step varies depending on the specific conditions of the reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps: hydrogen activation by the catalyst, C-H bond cleavage, intermediate formation, and product formation. There is an ongoing scientific debate about which of these steps is rate-limiting, particularly concerning hydrogen activation and C-H bond cleavage. The mechanism continues to be a subject of interest and controversy due to the incomplete understanding of the detailed mechanisms within each step and the varying importance of each step based on the specific reaction conditions.

[1] "The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene."
[2] "Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."
[3] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with tem- perature and propane partial pressure."
[4] "A model is discussed where a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst."
[5] "The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased."
[6] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Activation of the substrate by the catalyst.
2. Bond cleavage, breaking the bonds in the substrate molecule.
3. Diffusion of the activated species towards the surface of the catalyst.
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The literature does not specify a consensus view on the rate-limiting step, but rather discusses the mechanism's four steps individually.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of interest because it provides insight into the complex processes involved in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The mechanism explains how substrates are activated, how bonds are broken, and how products are formed, offering a framework for understanding the efficiency and selectivity of these reactions. Moreover, the mechanism's simplicity and generality make it applicable to a wide range of chemical systems, contributing to its enduring relevance in the field of catalysis.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，包含四个主要步骤：
1. 催化剂活化底物。
2. 破坏底物分子中的键。
3. 活化物种向催化剂表面扩散。
4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤是决定性步骤的争论是科学界关注的话题。文献没有明确共识的观点，而是分别讨论了机制的四个步骤。

尽管这一机制已经研究了近一个世纪，但它仍然是一个研究话题，因为它为理解催化脱氢反应的复杂过程提供了见解。机制解释了如何活化底物，如何断开键以及如何形成产物，为理解这些反应的效率和选择性提供框架。此外，机制的简单性和普适性使其适用于各种化学系统，从而增加了其持久的相关性。
