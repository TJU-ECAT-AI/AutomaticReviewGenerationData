[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps."
[2] "These steps include adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule, breaking of bonds within the molecule, and desorption of the product molecule."
[3] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the complexity of the reaction pathway and the interplay between the different steps."
[4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four primary stages. These stages involve the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, the activation of the molecule, the disruption of bonds within the molecule, and the desorption of the product molecule. The persistent dispute about which stage is rate-limiting arises from the intricacy of the reaction pathway and the interactions between the various stages. Despite almost a century of investigation, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continues to be a subject of scientific interest and debate.
