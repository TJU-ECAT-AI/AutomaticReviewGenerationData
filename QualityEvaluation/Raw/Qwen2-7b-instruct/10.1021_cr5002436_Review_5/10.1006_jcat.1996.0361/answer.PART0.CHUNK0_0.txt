[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely accepted model."
[2] "It comprises four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule, dehydrogenation, and desorption of the product."
[3] "The ongoing debate centers around which of these steps is the rate-limiting step."
[4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, comprising adsorption, activation, dehydrogenation, and desorption steps, is a commonly acknowledged model for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The central debate revolves around identifying the rate-limiting step among these four stages. Despite extensive research over nearly a century, the mechanism continues to attract scientific curiosity and disagreement.
