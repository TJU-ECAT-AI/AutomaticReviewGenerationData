[1] "The details of these competing surface processes are still the source of some debate."
[2] "Interestingly,almost no HD-exchanged propylene was detected in those studies."
[3] "In the case of ethylene,although the temperatures involved in that case were higher than with propylene."
[4] "The yield for hydrogen increases almost linearly with propylene dose up to 0.75 L, at which point it levels off, an indication of saturation of the first adsorbed layer."
[5] "The presence of hydrogen on the surface not only increases the amount of propylene produced (to about 0.001 ML in the case of the 7.5 L H2 pre-dose), but also lowers the desorption temperature of the C2H8."
[6] "Notice that this is a very small feature,representing less than 0.1% of the total propylene adsorbed on the first layer."
[7] "Specifically,that feature displays significantly stronger intensities in the 41 and 42 amu fragments than those expected for the cracking pattern of propane in our mass spectrometer."
[8] "Indeed, the same peak is seen in experiments with propylidyne layers prepared by propylene adsorption at temperatures above 300 K."
[9] "A peak at 205 K dominates the top spectrum in Fig. 4a, and the total propane yield in that case amounts to 0.002 50 ML, ten times that seen in the absence of hydrogen."
[10] "This behavior is particularly noticeable for the light propanes."
[11] "The average number of deuterium atoms incorporated in each propane molecule is slightly higher than one."
[12] "A clear normal kinetic isotope effect was manifested by the shift in desorption temperature with increasing number of deuterium substitutions in both propylenes and propanes."
[13] "This is not unreasonable, given that ethylene has been shown for propylene HD exchange to follow the same process at temperatures much lower than those needed for any other reaction, including its hydrogenation to ethane."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps. These steps are as follows:

1. Activation of the hydrogen bond between the metal surface and the hydrogen molecule.
2. Insertion of the hydrogen molecule into the substrate-metal bond.
3. Elimination of hydrogen from the substrate, forming a surface compound.
4. Hydrogenation of the surface compound to produce the desired product.

The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around which of these steps is the rate-limiting step. Some researchers argue that the hydrogen molecule insertion is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the hydrogen elimination step might control the reaction rate.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for several reasons. Firstly, the precise mechanism of hydrogen molecule insertion into the substrate-metal bond is not fully understood. Secondly, the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst, can significantly influence the mechanism and the rate-limiting step. Lastly, the mechanism's applicability to various substrates and reaction conditions is still being explored, leading to ongoing debates and research.

In summary, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: hydrogen molecule activation, insertion into the substrate-metal bond, hydrogen elimination, and hydrogenation of the resulting surface compound. The rate-limiting step remains a subject of debate, and the mechanism continues to be a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction steps, the influence of reaction conditions, and the need for its broad applicability across various substrates and conditions.

霍里图-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应包含四个主要步骤。这些步骤如下：

1. 激活金属表面与氢分子之间的氢键。
2. 将氢分子插入到基质-金属键中。
3. 从基质中除去氢，形成表面化合物。
4. 对表面化合物进行氢化以产生所需产物。

科学界持续辩论的问题是哪一步是控制反应速率的关键步骤。一些研究人员认为氢分子插入是关键步骤，而其他研究者则认为氢气去除步骤可能控制反应速率。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，原因有以下几点：首先，氢分子插入到基质-金属键中的精确机制尚不完全清楚；其次，反应条件，如温度、压力和催化剂的性质，可以显著影响机制和控制速率的步骤；最后，机制在各种基质和条件下适用性的探索导致了持续的争论和研究。

简而言之，霍里图-波兰尼机制涉及四个主要步骤：氢分子激活、插入到基质-金属键中、氢气去除以及对形成的表面化合物进行氢化以产生所需产物。控制反应速率的关键步骤仍然是争论的焦点，由于反应步骤的复杂性、反应条件的影响以及需要其广泛适用于各种基质和条件，该机制仍然成为科学兴趣和争议的焦点。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the adsorption of a hydrocarbon onto a metal surface. The second step is the activation of the adsorbed hydrocarbon by interaction with surface-bound hydrogen. The third step is the dehydrogenation of the activated hydrocarbon, leading to the formation of an intermediate compound. The fourth step is the desorption of the product from the surface. Despite nearly a century of study, the debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting continues. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it explains the efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation reactions on metal surfaces. However, the actual process of dehydrogenation is complex and involves various competing pathways, making it challenging to pinpoint the rate-limiting step definitively.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤。第一步是将烃吸附到金属表面。第二步是通过与表面氢相互作用活化吸附的烃。第三步是脱氢活化的烃，形成中间产物。第四步是从表面上脱吸附产物。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论仍然存在。这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它解释了金属表面脱氢反应的效率和选择性。然而，脱氢过程复杂，涉及各种竞争途径，这使得确定速率限制步骤的具体位置变得具有挑战性。
