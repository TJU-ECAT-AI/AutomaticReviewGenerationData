[1] "Several conclusions have already been reached from those investigations. First, thermal activation of ethylene adsorbed on Pt(111) leads to the production of ethane."
[2] "It was concluded that deuterium addition proceeds via the activation of the weak allylic CMH bond."
[3] "Interestingly,almost no HD-exchanged propylene was detected in the studies with platinum catalysts."
[4] "A few conclusions have already been reached from the investigations. First, thermal activation of ethylene leads to the production of ethane."
[5] "A clear distinction was made between the formation of ethylidyne and the subsequent hydrogenation to ethane."
[6] "The formation of detectable quantities of propylene-d6 and propane-d8 rules out any mechanism relying solely on allylic intermediates."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps. These steps are as follows:

1. Activation of the hydrogen bond between the metal surface and the hydrogen molecule.
2. Insertion of the hydrogen molecule into the substrate-metal bond.
3. Elimination of hydrogen from the substrate, forming a surface compound.
4. Hydrogenation of the surface compound to produce the desired product.

The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around which of these steps is the rate-limiting step. Some researchers argue that the hydrogen molecule insertion is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the hydrogen elimination step might control the reaction rate.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for several reasons. Firstly, the precise mechanism of hydrogen molecule insertion into the substrate-metal bond is not fully understood. Secondly, the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst, can significantly influence the mechanism and the rate-limiting step. Lastly, the mechanism's applicability to various substrates and reaction conditions is still being explored, leading to ongoing debates and research.

In summary, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: hydrogen molecule activation, insertion into the substrate-metal bond, hydrogen elimination, and hydrogenation of the resulting surface compound. The rate-limiting step remains a subject of debate, and the mechanism continues to be a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of the reaction steps, the influence of reaction conditions, and the need for its broad applicability across various substrates and conditions.

霍里图-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应包含四个主要步骤。这些步骤如下：

1. 激活金属表面与氢分子之间的氢键。
2. 将氢分子插入到基质-金属键中。
3. 从基质中除去氢，形成表面化合物。
4. 对表面化合物进行氢化以产生所需产物。

科学界持续辩论的问题是哪一步是控制反应速率的关键步骤。一些研究人员认为氢分子插入是关键步骤，而其他研究者则认为氢气去除步骤可能控制反应速率。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，原因有以下几点：首先，氢分子插入到基质-金属键中的精确机制尚不完全清楚；其次，反应条件，如温度、压力和催化剂的性质，可以显著影响机制和控制速率的步骤；最后，机制在各种基质和条件下适用性的探索导致了持续的争论和研究。

简而言之，霍里图-波兰尼机制涉及四个主要步骤：氢分子激活、插入到基质-金属键中、氢气去除以及对形成的表面化合物进行氢化以产生所需产物。控制反应速率的关键步骤仍然是争论的焦点，由于反应步骤的复杂性、反应条件的影响以及需要其广泛适用于各种基质和条件，该机制仍然成为科学兴趣和争议的焦点。
