[1] "Several conclusions have already been reached from those investigations. First, thermal activation of ethylene adsorbed on Pt(111) leads to the production of ethane, ethylidyne, and other C2 compounds."
[2] "The mechanistic studies on hydrocarbon conversion mechanisms at the atomic level are still the source of some debate."
[3] "Interestingly,almost no HD-exchanged propylene was detected in those studies."
[4] "More recent temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments with propylene coadsorbed with deuterium on Pt(111) [15] reported no hydrogenation at all, and exchange of up to three deuterium atoms."
[5] "It was concluded that deuterium addition proceeds atomically (it involves surface D, not D2), and that the further hydrogenation of a half-hydrogenated (propyl) intermediate to the alkane is the rate-limiting step of the whole process."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the adsorption of a hydrocarbon onto a metal surface. The second step is the activation of the adsorbed hydrocarbon by interaction with surface-bound hydrogen. The third step is the dehydrogenation of the activated hydrocarbon, leading to the formation of an intermediate compound. The fourth step is the desorption of the product from the surface. Despite nearly a century of study, the debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting continues. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it explains the efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation reactions on metal surfaces. However, the actual process of dehydrogenation is complex and involves various competing pathways, making it challenging to pinpoint the rate-limiting step definitively.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤。第一步是将烃吸附到金属表面。第二步是通过与表面氢相互作用活化吸附的烃。第三步是脱氢活化的烃，形成中间产物。第四步是从表面上脱吸附产物。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论仍然存在。这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它解释了金属表面脱氢反应的效率和选择性。然而，脱氢过程复杂，涉及各种竞争途径，这使得确定速率限制步骤的具体位置变得具有挑战性。
