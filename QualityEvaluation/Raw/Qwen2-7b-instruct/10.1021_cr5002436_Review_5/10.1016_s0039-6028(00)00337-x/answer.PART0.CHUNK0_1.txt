[1] "The details of these competing surface processes are still the source of some debate."
[2] "Interestingly,almost no HD-exchanged propylene was detected in those studies."
[3] "In the case of ethylene,although the temperatures involved in that case were higher than with propylene."
[4] "The yield for hydrogen increases almost linearly with propylene dose up to 0.75 L, at which point it levels off, an indication of saturation of the first adsorbed layer."
[5] "The presence of hydrogen on the surface not only increases the amount of propylene produced (to about 0.001 ML in the case of the 7.5 L H2 pre-dose), but also lowers the desorption temperature of the C2H8."
[6] "Notice that this is a very small feature,representing less than 0.1% of the total propylene adsorbed on the first layer."
[7] "Specifically,that feature displays significantly stronger intensities in the 41 and 42 amu fragments than those expected for the cracking pattern of propane in our mass spectrometer."
[8] "Indeed, the same peak is seen in experiments with propylidyne layers prepared by propylene adsorption at temperatures above 300 K."
[9] "A peak at 205 K dominates the top spectrum in Fig. 4a, and the total propane yield in that case amounts to 0.002 50 ML, ten times that seen in the absence of hydrogen."
[10] "This behavior is particularly noticeable for the light propanes."
[11] "The average number of deuterium atoms incorporated in each propane molecule is slightly higher than one."
[12] "A clear normal kinetic isotope effect was manifested by the shift in desorption temperature with increasing number of deuterium substitutions in both propylenes and propanes."
[13] "This is not unreasonable, given that ethylene has been shown for propylene HD exchange to follow the same process at temperatures much lower than those needed for any other reaction, including its hydrogenation to ethane."

1. The specific mechanisms of competing surface processes are still subjects of debate among scientists.
2. No significant amounts of HD-exchanged propylene were found in previous studies.
3. In comparison to propylene, ethylene undergoes similar reactions but at higher temperatures.
4. The hydrogen yield increases almost linearly with propylene dose up to 0.75 L, reaching a plateau indicative of the saturation of the first layer of adsorbed molecules.
5. The presence of hydrogen on the surface boosts propylene production and decreases the desorption temperature of propane (C2H8).
6. The small propane feature represents a minor fraction of the total propylene adsorbed on the surface.
7. The observed intensities in the 41 and 42 amu fragments exceed expectations for the typical cracking pattern of propane.
8. The same peak is detectable in experiments conducted with propylidyne layers synthesized at temperatures above 300 K.
9. The top spectrum in Fig. 4a shows a dominant peak at 205 K, with a total propane yield 10 times higher than in scenarios without hydrogen.
10. The behavior is more pronounced in lighter propane molecules.
11. The average number of deuterium atoms per propane molecule is slightly greater than one.
12. A clear normal kinetic isotope effect is evident from the temperature shift associated with the increase in deuterium substitutions in both propylenes and propanes.
13. This behavior aligns with the observation that propylene HD exchange follows a similar process at lower temperatures compared to other reactions, such as the hydrogenation of ethane.

1. 这些竞争表面过程的具体机制仍然是科学家争论的话题。
2. 在先前的研究中，没有发现显著的HD交换丙烯。
3. 相对于丙烯而言，乙烯在更高的温度下进行类似的反应。
4. 氢产量几乎线性增加至0.75升丙烯剂量，达到饱和层吸附分子的峰值，指示饱和。
5. 表面氢的存在增加了丙烯的产量，并降低了脱附温度。
6. 小型丙烷特征代表总吸附丙烯的小比例。
7. 观察到的41和42amu片段的强度超过了丙烷典型裂解模式的预期。
8. 在300K以上温度合成的丙基炔层实验中也观察到了相同的峰值。
9. 图4a的顶部光谱显示了一个主导的205K峰，总丙烷产量是无氢情况下的十倍。
10. 在较轻的丙烷分子中，这种行为更为明显。
11. 每个丙烷分子平均包含的氘原子略多于一个。
12. 从丙烯和丙烷中增加的氘代数与温度变化的清晰正常同位素效应中可以看出这一点。
13. 这种行为与观察到丙烯HD交换在比其他反应（如乙烷的氢化）更低的温度下遵循相同过程相一致。
