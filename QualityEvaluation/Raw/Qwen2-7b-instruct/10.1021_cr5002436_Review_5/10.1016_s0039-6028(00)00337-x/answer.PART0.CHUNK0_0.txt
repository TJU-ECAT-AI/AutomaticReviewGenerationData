1. The incorporation of hydrogen into olefins through atomic or molecular sources, from the surface or gas phase, involves debates on the sequence or concerted addition of hydrogen atoms to the double bond, as well as competition with other reactions like disproportionations and displacements.
2. The mechanistic studies on the conversion of hydrocarbons are still subjects of debate among scientists.
3. The specific details of competing surface processes in hydrocarbon conversion are a point of contention in scientific discourse.
4. Arguments presented in the literature suggest that the formation of an allylic intermediate is unlikely in the described process.
5. The coadsorption of deuterium with propylene leads to extensive hydrogen/deuterium exchange on the adsorbed hydrocarbon.
6. Surface hydrogen enhances propane production, causing a significant increase in yield (up to tenfold) and a shift in the initial desorption temperature to 255 K.
7. The average number of deuterium atoms that can be incorporated into a propylene molecule does not exceed two, even with increased deuterium predose.
8. The data presented here support a mechanism involving a slow half-hydrogenation step leading to propyl intermediates for both hydrogenation and hydrogen/deuterium exchange processes in propylene.
