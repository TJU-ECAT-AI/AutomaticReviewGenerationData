[1] "Several conclusions have already been reached from those investigations. First, thermal activation of ethylene adsorbed on Pt(111) leads to the production of ethylidyne (Pt3OCMCH2MCH3)."
[2] "The hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane has been proposed to take place via the rate-limiting insertion of the olefin into a platinumhydrogen bond followed by fast hydrogenation of the resulting ethyl groups."
[3] "A similar mechanism is likely to apply for propylene."
[4] "Hydrogenation of propyl (the half-hydrogenated intermediate from ethylene insertion) to propane is expected to compete with b-hydride elimination back to propylene."
[5] "TBD"
[6] "The details of the chemistry of dehydrogenated species on Pt(111) surfaces is currently under investigation in our laboratory."

1. The thermal activation of ethylene on Pt(111) results in the formation of ethylidyne.
2. The hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane might occur through the insertion of the olefin into a platinumhydrogen bond, followed by swift hydrogenation of the resulting ethyl groups.
3. A similar process is anticipated for propylene.
4. The hydrogenation of propyl, the half-hydrogenated intermediate from ethylene insertion, is expected to compete with b-hydride elimination returning to propylene.
5. The specifics of the reaction mechanism for dehydrogenation are still being explored in our research lab.

1. 热激活下，乙烷在铂(111)表面上会产生乙烯基。
2. 乙烯转化为乙烷的过程可能涉及烯烃插入到铂氢键中，然后快速对生成的乙基进行氢化。
3. 这一过程对于丙烯同样适用。
4. 丙基（乙烯插入生成的半氢化中间体）的氢化预计会与b-氢消除竞争，返回为丙烯。
5. 我们实验室正在研究铂(111)表面脱氢物种的详细反应机制。
