[1] "Catalyst deactivation is an important issue in the petroleum refining and chemical industries. It plays an important part in process design and operation."
[2] "The five main causes of deactivation are: poisoning, fouling, thermal degradation (sintering, evaporation) initiated by the often high temperature, mechanical damage and corrosion/leaching by the reaction mixture."
[3] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[4] "Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy."
