[1] "The five main causes of deactivation are: poisoning,fouling, thermal degradation (sintering, evaporation) initiated by the often high temperature, mechanical damage and corrosion/leaching by the reaction mixture."
[2] "Dehydrogenation involves the breaking of a C-H bond to produce hydrogen and an alkene."
[3] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism suggests that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate."
[4] "The mechanism includes four main steps: abstraction of a hydrogen atom, formation of a carbocation, ring opening, and finally hydrogen elimination."
[5] "The debate around which step is rate-limiting continues, with some arguing for the abstraction step, others for the ring opening step."
[6] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: abstraction of a hydrogen atom, formation of a carbocation, ring opening, and finally hydrogen elimination. The mechanism suggests that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate. There is ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting, with arguments for both the abstraction step and the ring opening step. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：氢原子的抽象、形成碳正离子、环裂开以及最后的氢消除。该机制认为脱氢过程通过碳正离子中间体进行。关于哪个步骤是决定性的，存在争议，有人支持抽象步骤，也有人支持环裂开步骤。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。
