[1] "The five main causes of deactivation are: poisoning, fouling, thermal degradation (sintering, evaporation) initiated by the often high temperature, mechanical damage and corrosion/leaching by the reaction mixture."
[2] "Dehydrogenation is used as an example to demonstrate the variety of engineering solutions possible."
[3] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: hydrogen abstraction, migration, dissociation, and recombination."
[4] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: hydrogen abstraction, migration, dissociation, and recombination. The ongoing debate about which step is considered rate-limiting remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.
