[1] "Catalyst deactivation is usually inevitable, although the rate at which it occurs varies greatly."
[2] "The time scale of deactivation has profound consequences for process design."
[3] "Deactivation is a complex phenomenon. Feed molecules might poison active sites, the catalyst might produce intermediates and products that are lethal poisons for the catalyst, the catalyst might not withstand the high temperature applied, etc."
[4] "In the case of egg-shell poisoning, the most accessible sites are poisoned and, as a consequence, the observed deactivation behaviour is the same as in selective poisoning."

Catalyst deactivation is an inevitable phenomenon that occurs at varying rates across different processes. This has significant implications for process design. Deactivation can arise from various causes, including poisoning, fouling, thermal degradation (such as sintering and evaporation), mechanical damage, and corrosion/leaching by the reaction medium. The complexity of deactivation stems from the diverse mechanisms that can lead to catalyst failure. Poisoning can occur through strong adsorption of impurities, leading to both temporary and permanent deactivation. Some poisoning can even enhance selectivity, albeit at the cost of activity, acting as a promoter. Fouling involves the deposition of substances on the catalyst surface, often causing physical blockage. Thermal degradation, particularly sintering, involves the growth of catalyst particles, reducing surface area and activity. Mechanical deactivation is linked to the strength and durability of the catalyst against physical stress. Corrosion/leaching is a result of the reaction medium's corrosiveness. Catalyst activity is directly proportional to the number of active sites. To mitigate deactivation, understanding its causes allows for targeted improvements in catalyst design and process optimization. Feed purification is essential to prevent poisoning and certain types of fouling. For cases where initial measures are insufficient, advanced reactor designs and strategies, such as catalyst regeneration cycles, can be employed to maintain activity levels.

催化剂失活是不可避免的现象，其发生速率在不同过程中有很大差异。这对过程设计有深远影响。失活的原因包括中毒、污染、热降解（如烧结和蒸发）、机械损坏以及反应介质的腐蚀/流失。失活的复杂性源于导致催化剂失效的多种机制。中毒可以通过强烈吸附杂质发生，导致临时或永久失活。有些中毒甚至可以提高选择性，尽管以牺牲活性为代价，充当促进剂。污染涉及在催化剂表面沉积物质，通常导致物理堵塞。热降解，特别是烧结，涉及到催化剂颗粒的增长，减少了表面积和活性。机械失活与催化剂抵抗物理应力的强度和耐用性有关。腐蚀/流失是反应介质腐蚀性的结果。催化剂活性直接与活性位点的数量成正比。为了减轻失活的影响，理解其原因允许对催化剂设计和过程优化进行有针对性的改进。通过净化原料流可以防止中毒和某些类型的污染。对于初始措施不足以解决问题的情况，先进的反应器设计和策略，如催化剂再生周期，可以被采用以维持活性水平。
