[1] "Typical for graphene on transition metal surfaces is the development of Moire patterns exhibiting large surface unit supercells with periodicities of about 23 nm."
[2] "We have found that low formation temperatures (9001000 K) and the use of large polycyclic aromatic precursors, such as C60H30 [13] or C60 fullerenes, instead of the standard ethylene, strongly favor the amount of the ffiffiffi 3 p ffiffiffi 3 p R30 areas with respect to Moire structures."
[3] "The formation of this reconstruction is enhanced if low temperatures and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are used as molecular precursors for epitaxial growth of the graphene layers."

[5] "The main change is an important increase in the DOS at the Fermi level for  bands, which could enhance the local catalytic properties of these reconstructed regions."

In the context of graphene growth on transition metal surfaces, the literature discusses the formation of Moire patterns, which exhibit large surface unit supercells with periodicities around 23 nm. The study focuses on the formation of regions with a periodicity of ffiffiffi 3 p ffiffiffi 3 p R30, which are influenced by low formation temperatures and the use of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as molecular precursors. This approach enhances the formation of these specific graphene regions compared to Moire structures. The literature also notes that the presence of vacancies in the outermost Pt layer of the substrate leads to an energetically stable structure that aligns with the STM images. This model, involving the formation of a vacancy network, significantly contributes to the overall reconstruction of the Pt surface. Additionally, the text acknowledges various sources of financial support for the research project. Lastly, the literature highlights that the DOS at the Fermi level for  bands increases due to the formation of covalent bonds between graphene and the substrate, which could potentially enhance the local catalytic properties of the reconstructed regions.

在过渡金属表面的石墨烯生长背景下，文献探讨了莫尔图案的形成，这些图案表现出大约23nm的大型表面单元超晶格。研究重点在于形成具有ffiffiffi 3 p ffiffiffi 3 p R30周期性的特定石墨烯区域，这受到较低生长温度和大环芳香烃分子前体的使用的影响。这种方法提高了这些特定石墨烯区域相对于莫尔结构的形成比例。文献还指出，在基底上形成的空位网络的存在增强了这种结构的稳定性，并与扫描隧道显微镜图像相匹配。此外，文本认可了项目研究的多个资金来源。最后，文献指出，由于石墨烯与基底形成共价键，费米能级附近带的电子密度增加，这可能增强重构区域的局部催化性质。
