The literature discusses the formation and structure of graphene on a Pt(111) substrate, specifically focusing on the formation of a reconstruction characterized by an ordered vacancy network in the outermost Pt layer and a graphene layer covalently bound to the Pt substrate. The reconstruction is favored by low formation temperatures and the use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as molecular precursors. The structure of the reconstruction includes a missing Pt atom per unit cell, with the rest of the Pt atoms in alternating top or hollow positions relative to the graphene layer. This leads to significant buckling in the graphene layer, with a maximum buckling of z 0.2 A. The binding energy of C atoms in the graphene layer differs depending on their position relative to the Pt vacancy or surface Pt atoms. The literature also mentions the use of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the chemical composition of the graphene layer, showing that the peak corresponding to graphene grown with C60 precursors exhibits additional components compared to graphene grown with ethylene precursors, suggesting the presence of covalently bonded structures.

文献讨论了在Pt(111)基底上生长的石墨烯的形成和结构，特别是关注了一种重构，其特征在于外层Pt层中的有序空位网络和与Pt基底共价结合的石墨烯层。该重构在低温和使用多环芳香烃分子作为层状生长石墨烯的前体时得到促进。重构结构包括每个单元格中缺少一个Pt原子，其余的Pt原子分别位于相对于石墨烯层的顶部或空位位置。这导致石墨烯层产生显著的弯曲，最大弯曲量为z 0.2 A。石墨烯层中碳原子的结合能根据它们相对于Pt空位或表面Pt原子的位置而不同。文献还提到了使用x射线光电子能谱（XPS）来分析石墨烯层的化学组成，显示使用C60前体生长的石墨烯峰与使用乙炔前体生长的石墨烯峰相比，具有额外的成分，这表明存在共价结合的结构。
