[4] "Graphene layers can be efficiently grown by thermal decomposition of small organic molecules, usually ethylene, on transition metals, such as Ru(0001) [3,4], Ir (111) [5], Rh(111) [6], and Pt(111) [7,8]."

[11] "DFT calculations show that graphene binds more strongly to the platinum surface in the presence of vacancies. The interaction becomes 3 times larger (  0:60 eV per unit cell),and the bond length between the C near a top Pt shortens to 2.28 A (see Fig. 2, side view)."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps, which are still a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study. However, the provided literature does not contain direct information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. It discusses the growth of epitaxial graphene on various metal surfaces and the formation of Moire patterns, but does not delve into catalytic dehydrogenation reactions specifically.

The literature highlights that the formation of graphene on metal surfaces, particularly through the decomposition of organic molecules, is an active area of research due to its fundamental and practical implications. The structure of the graphene layers, their interaction with the metal substrate, and the resulting electronic properties are discussed, but the mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not addressed.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism typically refers to a series of steps involved in the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons to olefins, but the specific details and the debate about the rate-limiting step are not elaborated upon in the provided text.

As such, without more specific information related to the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, it is not possible to provide a detailed explanation or analysis based on the given literature. The literature focuses on the growth and structure of graphene layers on metal surfaces rather than catalytic processes.

霍里图蒂-波拉尼机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤，尽管这一机制及其争议性步骤的确定已经研究了一个世纪之久，但它仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的课题。然而，提供的文献没有直接提供关于霍里图蒂-波拉尼机制或哪个步骤被认为是决定性的信息。

文献强调了在各种金属表面生长石墨烯及其形成的莫雷模式，这是一项活跃的研究领域，由于其基础和实际意义。讨论了石墨烯层的结构、它们与金属基板的相互作用以及由此产生的电子性质，但没有具体探讨催化脱氢反应机制。

霍里图蒂-波拉尼机制通常指的是将烃类转化为烯烃的一系列步骤，但关于决定性的步骤的具体细节和争议性并没有在这段文本中得到详细阐述。

因此，在没有更多与霍里图蒂-波拉尼机制相关的信息的情况下，基于给定的文献，无法提供详细的解释或分析。文献的重点是关注金属表面石墨烯层的生长和结构，而不是催化过程。
