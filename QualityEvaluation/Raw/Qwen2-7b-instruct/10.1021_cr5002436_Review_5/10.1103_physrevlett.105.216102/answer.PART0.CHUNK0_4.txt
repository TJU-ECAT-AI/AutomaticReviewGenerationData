[1] "Typical for graphene on transition metal surfaces is the development of Moire patterns exhibiting large surface unit supercells with periodicities of about 23 nm."
[2] "The formation of this reconstruction is enhanced if low temperatures and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are used as molecular precursors for epitaxial growth of the graphene layers."
[3] "These regions,presenting smaller crystallographic ratios than the Moire counterpart, make the system amenable to be explored by ab initio calculations, an important tool to accurately interpret the chemistry and physics of epitaxial graphene."
[4] "We have found that low formation temperatures (9001000 K) and the use of large polycyclic aromatic precursors, such as C60H30 [13] or C60 fullerenes, instead of the standard ethylene, strongly favor the amount of the ffiffiffi 3 p ffiffiffi 3 p R30 areas with respect to Moire structures."
[5] "At or above the monolayer coverage, the ffiffiffi 3 p ffiffiffi 3 p R30 areas could extend to the whole Pt-terrace length (up to 100 nm) as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)."
[6] "Since electronic effects are important in the image appearance, the atomic assignment of the STM features shown in Fig. 1(c) is not trivial and requires the use of first-principles calculations."
[7] "This model one surface Pt atom is missing per ffiffiffi 3 p ffiffiffi 3 p unit cell, and the rest of the Pt atoms are alternatively in top or hollow positions with respect to the graphene layer."
[8] "In this structural model graphene binds more strongly to the platinum surface in the presence of vacancies."
[9] "The interaction becomes 3 times larger (  0:60 eV per unit cell), and the bond length between the C near a top Pt shortens to 2.28 A ."
[10] "The outermost Pt layer goes from expansion to 8:1% contraction."
[11] "To accurately relate this structural model with the experimental STM images we have performed theoretical simulations using a non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function formalism in which multiple scattering events have been considered."
[12] "The total corrugation of the theoretical model for different tip distances range from 0.1 to 0.3 A , in good agreement with the experimental values."
[13] "The peak corresponding to the ethylene preparation shows a single component centered at 284.0 eV, whereas the lower peak corresponding to graphene grown with C60 shows extra components at both sides of the main peak (284.3 and 283.7 eV)."
[14] "The core level peak of C atoms interacting with transition metal substrate is shifted towards higher binding energies."
[15] "The main change is an important increase in the DOS at the Fermi level for  bands, which could enhance the local catalytic properties of these reconstructed regions."
[16] "Upon annealing the molecular precursor, a Pt atom per ffiffiffi 3 p ffiffiffi 3 p unit cell is removed from the surface and diffuses towards the step edges, leaving a vacancy behind."
[17] "The same mechanism has been proposed for C60 on Pd (110) [20], and more recently for Ag(111) [21] and Pt(110) [22]."

1. The literature discusses the formation of graphene on a Pt(111) substrate, focusing on the development of Moire patterns and the formation of an ordered vacancy network in the outermost Pt layer, which is covalently bound to the graphene layer. Low temperatures and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are mentioned as factors that favor the formation of graphene with a specific crystallographic ratio (ffiffiffi 3 p ffiffiffi 3 p R30).

2. The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze which step is considered rate-limiting. It also does not discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

3. The literature describes the use of first-principles calculations and theoretical simulations to relate the structural model of the graphene reconstruction with experimental scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images. The simulations reproduce important features observed in the STM images, such as the bright spots and depressions surrounded by a tiny halo.

4. The literature mentions that the interaction between graphene and the Pt surface becomes stronger in the presence of vacancies. This leads to a reduction in the bond length between carbon atoms near a top Pt atom to 2.28 Å, and the outermost Pt layer contracts by 8.1%.

5. The literature explains that the total corrugation of the theoretical model, which represents the graphene reconstruction, ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 Å, in good agreement with experimental STM images. This indicates that the theoretical model accurately describes the atomic features of the graphene reconstruction.

6. The literature provides insights into the chemical bonding between graphene and the Pt substrate by discussing the core level spectra of C atoms. It suggests that the core level peak of C atoms interacting with the Pt substrate is shifted towards higher binding energies due to the formation of covalent bonds.

7. The literature does not delve into the specifics of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its rate-limiting step. Instead, it focuses on the growth and structure of graphene on a Pt(111) substrate, particularly the formation of a specific crystallographic ratio and the role of vacancies in strengthening the interaction between graphene and the substrate.

8. The literature acknowledges that the mechanism of vacancy formation in Pt(111) upon annealing involves the removal of a Pt atom per unit cell, which diffuses towards the step edges, leaving a vacancy behind. This mechanism is also discussed for other transition metals, such as Pd, Ag, and Pt.

9. The literature does not provide an in-depth analysis of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its rate-limiting step. It focuses on the growth and structure of graphene on a Pt(111) substrate, highlighting the importance of vacancies in strengthening the interaction between graphene and the substrate.

10. The literature emphasizes the role of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in enhancing the formation of graphene with a specific crystallographic ratio on a Pt(111) substrate. It also discusses the importance of low temperatures in facilitating the growth process.
