          [1] "The results from the DFT calculations of the present study provide information about the energetics for vari-  ous hydrocarbon fragments that may be involved in ethane hydrogenolysis on platinum."
          [2] "Importantly, this energetic information can be used to constrain the parameters that are used in kinetic models, based on elementary steps, to fit reaction kinetics data."
          [3] "For example, di-σ/π-adsorbed vinylidene species, CCH2, are predicted to be the most abundant surface species on Pt at typical reaction conditions for ethane hydrogenolysis, e.g., a temperature of 623 K for ethane and hydrogen pressures of 0.02 and 0.2 atm, respectively."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: activation of the substrate molecule, cleavage of the substrate molecule, migration of the product molecule, and release of the activated substrate. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study. The reason for this debate is the complexity and interdependence of the steps in the mechanism, making it difficult to isolate and determine the rate-limiting step. The mechanism remains a topic of interest due to its fundamental importance in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes, particularly in the field of chemical engineering and materials science.

          霍里图-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：底物分子的活化、底物分子的断裂、产物分子的迁移以及激活的底物分子的释放。关于哪一步被认为是速率限制性步骤的持续争论仍然是科学界的兴趣点和争议话题，尽管该机制的研究已有近一个世纪的历史。争论的原因在于机制中各步骤的复杂性和相互依赖性，使得很难孤立地确定决定性步骤。该机制之所以保持研究兴趣，是因为它在理解并优化催化过程的基本重要性，特别是在化学工程和材料科学领域。

          INTRODUCTION
          Rationale Reactions of hydrocarbons on metal catalysts (e.g., Pt) are of importance in the chemical and petrochemical industries (e.g., (1, 2)).
          In the present paper, we address possible reaction intermediates involved in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum. This reaction has been studied by various authors (e.g.,(912)), and the literature related to this reaction forms a foundation for studies involving microcalorimetric, kinetic, and quantum chemical studies of C2 species on platinum.

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
          1. Adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface.  
          2. Activation, where the hydrogen atoms are removed from the molecule, often through breaking of a C-C bond.  
          3. Migration of the resulting fragment across the surface.  
          4. Desorption of the product molecule from the surface.
          
          Regarding which step is considered rate-limiting, the debate centers around the activation step. Some researchers argue that the slowest step is the removal of hydrogen atoms from the molecule, while others propose that the migration step might be the bottleneck. The complexity arises due to the variety of pathways and the influence of reaction conditions. Despite decades of research, the exact rate-determining step remains a topic of ongoing discussion and investigation.
          
          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a theoretical framework for understanding catalytic processes, especially in the context of hydrocarbon conversion. It helps in predicting reaction rates, identifying potential intermediates, and designing more efficient catalysts. The mechanism's applicability varies depending on the specific conditions and the nature of the catalyst, making it a subject of continuous exploration and refinement.

          霍里图-波兰尼机制是催化脱氢反应的基本概念。它涉及四个主要步骤：
          1. 将烃分子吸附到催化剂表面。
          2. 激活，其中从分子中移除氢原子，通常通过断裂C-C键。
          3. 片段在表面的迁移。
          4. 从表面释放产物分子。
          
          关于哪个步骤被认为是决定性的，争论集中在激活步骤。一些研究人员认为最慢的步骤是将氢原子从分子中移除，而其他人则认为迁移步骤可能是瓶颈。复杂性来源于路径的多样性以及反应条件的影响。尽管几十年的研究，确定的速率决定步骤仍然是一个持续讨论和调查的主题。
          
          霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它为理解催化过程提供了一个理论框架，尤其是在烃转化的背景下。它有助于预测反应速率、识别潜在中间体，并设计更高效的催化剂。该机制的应用取决于特定条件和催化剂的性质，使其成为不断探索和改进的主题。
