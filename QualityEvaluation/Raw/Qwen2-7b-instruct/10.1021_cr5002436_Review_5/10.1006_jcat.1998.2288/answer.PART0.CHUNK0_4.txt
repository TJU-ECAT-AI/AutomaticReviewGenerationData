[1] "Importantly, these intermediates are difficult to examine by common experimental techniques, and one has to rely on theoretical calculations to predict the structures and energetics of these species."
[2] "In the present paper, we address possible reaction intermediates involved in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum. This reaction has been studied by various authors (e.g.,(912)), and the literature related to this reaction forms a foundation for studies involving microcalorimetric, kinetic, and quantum chemical studies of C2 species on platinum."
[3] "The existing literature has guided our search for the adsorption sites and the orientation of the adsorbate on these sites."
[4] "The results from the DFT calculations of the present study provide information about the energetics for various hydrocarbon fragments that may be involved in ethane hydrogenolysis on platinum. Importantly, this energetic information can be used to constrain the parameters that are used in kinetic models, based on elementary steps, to fit reaction kinetics data."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. However, the exact identification of which step is the rate-limiting one remains a subject of scientific debate. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the mechanism continues to attract attention due to its relevance in various industrial processes, particularly in the petrochemical industry. The ongoing discussion centers around the specific mechanisms involved in each step, the energetics of these processes, and the conditions under which certain steps might dominate over others. This controversy highlights the complexity of catalytic reactions and the need for further research to refine our understanding of these mechanisms.

In summary, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps, but determining the rate-limiting step is still a topic of scientific interest and debate. The mechanism's continued relevance and the ongoing scientific discourse underscore the intricate nature of catalytic processes and the quest for improved catalysts and reaction conditions.
