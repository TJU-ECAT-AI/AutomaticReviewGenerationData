[1] "Importantly, the observed heat of 120 kJ/mol suggests that adsorption of ethylene on platinum at 173 K is a nonequilibrated process."
[2] "The calculated heats of adsorption at higher temperature facilitate comparison with the experimentally measured values and also can be used for estimation of kinetic parameters for ethane hydrogenolysis on platinum catalysts."
[3] "These comparisons have been made for di-σ-adsorbed ethylene, π-adsorbed ethylene, ethylidyne species (CCH3), di-σ/π-adsorbed vinylidene species (CCH2), and di-σ/π-adsorbed acetylene species."
[4] "This information is critical for estimating the surface coverages by different hydrocarbon species during the ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum, as shown elsewhere (13)."
[5] "This ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface. The second step is the activation of the molecule, typically involving breaking a bond and forming a more reactive intermediate. The third step is the dehydrogenation reaction itself, where the activation leads to the breaking of a hydrogen-hydrogen bond. The final step is the desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate about which of these steps is rate-limiting continues to be a topic of scientific interest due to its implications on reaction kinetics and efficiency. Despite decades of study, understanding which step controls the reaction rate remains elusive.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤。第一步是反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附。第二步是分子的活化，通常涉及断裂一个键并形成更活泼的中间体。第三步是脱氢反应本身，其中活化导致氢-氢键的断裂。最后一步是从催化剂表面脱附产物。关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论仍然是科学兴趣的话题。尽管已经研究了数十年，但了解哪个步骤控制反应速率仍然是个谜。
