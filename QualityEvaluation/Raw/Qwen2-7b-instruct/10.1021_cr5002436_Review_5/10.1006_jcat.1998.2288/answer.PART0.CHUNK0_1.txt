INTRODUCTION

Rationale Reactions of hydrocarbons on metal catalysts (e.g., Pt) are of importance in the chemical and petrochemical industries (e.g., (1, 2)). Accordingly, significant experimental efforts have been made in the catalysis and surface science communities to study the interactions of small hydrocarbons with various metal surfaces (e.g., (3, 4)).

In the present paper, we address possible reaction intermediates involved in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum. This reaction has been studied by various authors (e.g.,(912)), and the literature related to this reaction forms a foundation for studies involving microcalorimetric, kinetic, and quantum chemical studies of C2 species on platinum.

We begin our studies with the adsorption of ethylene and acetylene on platinum. We will show that the experimentally measured heats of interaction of these molecules with platinum at various temperatures can be explained using quantum chemical calculations, employing density functional theory (DFT) for Pt10 clusters. These Pt10 clusters are then used to estimate the energetics of various hydrocarbon fragments postulated to be intermediates in the hydrogenolysis of ethane over platinum.

Carter and Koel (14) published a table of energetics for gas-phase C1 and C2 hydrocarbon species and the interaction of these species with Pt(111). Similar to this present paper, these investigators presented energetics of species which could be determined experimentally (e.g., from TPD results and data compiled by Benson (15)), and they presented an approximation scheme to estimate the energetics of the species that have not been observed experimentally.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a fundamental concept in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface.  
2. Activation, where the hydrogen atoms are removed from the molecule, often through breaking of a C-C bond.  
3. Migration of the resulting fragment across the surface.  
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the surface.

Regarding which step is considered rate-limiting, the debate centers around the activation step. Some researchers argue that the slowest step is the removal of hydrogen atoms from the molecule, while others propose that the migration step might be the bottleneck. The complexity arises due to the variety of pathways and the influence of reaction conditions. Despite decades of research, the exact rate-determining step remains a topic of ongoing discussion and investigation.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it provides a theoretical framework for understanding catalytic processes, especially in the context of hydrocarbon conversion. It helps in predicting reaction rates, identifying potential intermediates, and designing more efficient catalysts. The mechanism's applicability varies depending on the specific conditions and the nature of the catalyst, making it a subject of continuous exploration and refinement.

霍里图-波兰尼机制是催化脱氢反应的基本概念。它涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 将烃分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 激活，其中从分子中移除氢原子，通常通过断裂C-C键。
3. 片段在表面的迁移。
4. 从表面释放产物分子。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的，争论集中在激活步骤。一些研究人员认为最慢的步骤是将氢原子从分子中移除，而其他人则认为迁移步骤可能是瓶颈。复杂性来源于路径的多样性以及反应条件的影响。尽管几十年的研究，确定的速率决定步骤仍然是一个持续讨论和调查的主题。

霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它为理解催化过程提供了一个理论框架，尤其是在烃转化的背景下。它有助于预测反应速率、识别潜在中间体，并设计更高效的催化剂。该机制的应用取决于特定条件和催化剂的性质，使其成为不断探索和改进的主题。
