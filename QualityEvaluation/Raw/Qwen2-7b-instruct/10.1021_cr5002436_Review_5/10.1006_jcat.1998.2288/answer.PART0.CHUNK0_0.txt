[1] "The results from the DFT calculations of the present study provide information about the energetics for vari- ous hydrocarbon fragments that may be involved in ethane hydrogenolysis on platinum."
[2] "Importantly, this energetic information can be used to constrain the parameters that are used in kinetic models, based on elementary steps, to fit reaction kinetics data."
[3] "For example, di-σ/π-adsorbed vinylidene species, CCH2, are predicted to be the most abundant surface species on Pt at typical reaction conditions for ethane hydrogenolysis, e.g., a temperature of 623 K for ethane and hydrogen pressures of 0.02 and 0.2 atm, respectively."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: activation of the substrate molecule, cleavage of the substrate molecule, migration of the product molecule, and release of the activated substrate. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study. The reason for this debate is the complexity and interdependence of the steps in the mechanism, making it difficult to isolate and determine the rate-limiting step. The mechanism remains a topic of interest due to its fundamental importance in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes, particularly in the field of chemical engineering and materials science.

霍里图-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤：底物分子的活化、底物分子的断裂、产物分子的迁移以及激活的底物分子的释放。关于哪一步被认为是速率限制性步骤的持续争论仍然是科学界的兴趣点和争议话题，尽管该机制的研究已有近一个世纪的历史。争论的原因在于机制中各步骤的复杂性和相互依赖性，使得很难孤立地确定决定性步骤。该机制之所以保持研究兴趣，是因为它在理解并优化催化过程的基本重要性，尤其是在化学工程和材料科学领域。
