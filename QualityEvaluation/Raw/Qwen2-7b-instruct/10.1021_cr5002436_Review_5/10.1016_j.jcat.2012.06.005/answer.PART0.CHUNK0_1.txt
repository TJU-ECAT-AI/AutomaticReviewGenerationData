[1] "The results obtained are summarized in Table 1."
[2] "The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for DH of propane in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on a long-term stability."
[3] "It should be stressed, however,that even the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst formed less than 2 wt.% of carbon deposits related to the total amount of propene formed."
[4] "The following discussion is aimed to elucidate the role of re- duced and oxidized MeOx species in the DH reaction."
[5] "However, this may be not the only difference in the nature of carbon deposits on these two catalysts."
[6] "In contrast to PtSn/Al2O3, VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 showed stronger resistance to deactivation in four consecutive DH/regeneration cycles."

The aim of the study was to investigate the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for propane dehydrogenation (DH) in the absence of gas-phase O2, with a focus on long-term stability. The results showed that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst formed less than 2 wt.% of carbon deposits, indicating its strong resistance to deactivation. The discussion also highlighted differences in the nature of carbon deposits on various catalysts and the role of reduced and oxidized metal oxides in the DH reaction.

本研究的目标是探索在没有气相氧的情况下，高度分散的VOx物种支持在介孔SiO2（MCM-41）上进行丙烷脱氢（DH），特别关注长期稳定性。结果显示，VOx/MCM-41催化剂形成的碳沉积物少于2 wt.%，表明其对失活具有很强的抵抗力。讨论还强调了各种催化剂中碳沉积物性质的不同以及还原和氧化金属氧化物在DH反应中的作用。
