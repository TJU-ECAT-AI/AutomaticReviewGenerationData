1. To verify if catalyst reduction is essential for olefin production and on-stream stability, tests were conducted with both oxidized and reduced catalysts (Section 2.3).

2. Figure 2 illustrates the initial space-time yield (STY) and selectivity (S) to propene obtained within the first hour at 823 K over various materials.

3. To explore catalyst stability over the long term, four consecutive dehydrogenation runs lasting 24 hours each were performed, alternating with regeneration stages that included oxidation or oxidation/reduction for oxidized or reduced catalysts, respectively.

4. The decrease in propene yield in the 1st dehydrogenation cycle was attributed to catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition, which will be detailed in Section 3.3.

5. Figure 5 juxtaposes the COx profiles generated for VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3.

6. Notably, the most stable VOx/MCM-41 produced the highest quantity of carbon deposits (Table 1).

7. Our key findings are as follows: (i) Both oxidized and reduced MeOx species can act as active sites for propane dehydrogenation, with the former being more active; (ii) Catalyst deactivation is caused by carbon deposits blocking active sites and the gradual transformation of MeOx species structures due to heat and atmosphere composition; (iii) VOx species resist structural changes under the utilized reaction conditions, enabling full restoration of VOx/MCM-41 activity via oxidative regeneration in a series of dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles.

1. 为了验证催化剂还原是否对于烯烃生产和在线稳定性是必要的，进行了氧化态和还原态催化剂的测试（第2.3节）。

2. 图2展示了在823 K下，第一小时内在线流中获得的初始空间时间产率（STY）和丙烯选择性（S）。

3. 为了研究催化剂的长期稳定性，进行了四次连续的脱氢反应，每次持续24小时，并且交替进行再生阶段，包括氧化或氧化/还原处理，具体取决于催化剂的状态。

4. 第1个脱氢周期中产量的降低归因于催化剂由于焦炭沉积导致的失活，这将在第3.3节中详细说明。

5. 图5比较了VOx/MCM-41、CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3的COx轮廓图。

6. 值得注意的是，最稳定的VOx/MCM-41产生了最高量的碳沉积物（表1）。

7. 我们的主要发现是：（i）无论是氧化态还是还原态的MeOx物种都可以作为丙烷脱氢的活性位点，前者更活跃；（ii）催化剂失活是由活性位点被碳沉积物堵塞以及MeOx物种结构在热和气氛组成的影响下逐渐变化引起的；（iii）VOx物种在本研究使用的条件下不易发生结构变化，因此在一系列脱氢/再生周期中通过氧化再生完全恢复了VOx/MCM-41的活性。
