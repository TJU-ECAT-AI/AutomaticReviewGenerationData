1. "The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for DH of propane in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on a long-term stability."
2. "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature."
3. "Recently, stable and selective iso-butane DH to iso-butene was reported over highly dispersed VOx species on SiO2 supports when operating under oxygen-lean conditions (ratio of iso-C4H10/O2 > 10)."
4. "It should be stressed, however,that even the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst formed less than 2 wt.% of carbon deposits related to the total amount of propene formed."
5. "The following discussion is aimed to elucidate the role of re- duced and oxidized MeOx species in the DH reaction."
6. "As evident from Fig. 3,both reduced and oxidized catalysts lose their activity with time on-stream."
7. "However, the catalysts differ strongly in the rate of deactivation and the amount of deposits formed."
8. "The oxidation state of MeOx species also determines the deacti- vation behavior."
9. "In contrast to PtSn/Al2O3, VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 showed stronger resistance to deactivation in four consecutive DH/regeneration cycles."
10. "UV/Vis spectra recorded at different times on-stream during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd DH cycles are compared in Fig. S4."

The study aimed to investigate the use of dispersed VOx species on MCM-41 for propane dehydrogenation without gas-phase oxygen, with a focus on long-term stability. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is thermodynamically favorable due to its exothermic nature, allowing for higher conversion at lower temperatures. Recent research has shown stable and selective iso-butane to iso-butene conversion under oxygen-lean conditions. VOx/MCM-41 catalysts formed less than 2% carbon deposits relative to propene production. The study explored the role of reduced and oxidized metal oxide species in the dehydrogenation process. Catalysts lost activity over time, but the rate and amount of carbon deposition varied between catalyst types. The oxidation state of metal oxide species influenced deactivation behavior. VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 exhibited greater resistance to deactivation over multiple dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles. The study included UV/Vis spectra comparisons at different times during the first, second, and third dehydrogenation cycles.

本研究旨在探索在没有气相氧的情况下，高度分散的VOx物种在MCM-41上用于丙烷脱氢的潜力，特别是长期稳定性。氧化脱氢（ODH）从热力学角度看更吸引人，因为它的放热性允许在较低温度下实现更高的转化率。最近的研究表明，在氧气贫乏条件下（异丁烷/氧比>10），高度分散的VOx物种在SiO2支持上的异丁烷转化为异丁烯具有稳定性和选择性。VOx/MCM-41催化剂仅形成了小于2%的碳沉积物，与丙烯产量有关。研究探讨了还原和氧化金属氧化物物种在脱氢过程中的作用。催化剂随时间失去活性，但不同催化剂的降解速率和沉积碳量差异显著。金属氧化物物种的氧化状态决定了降解行为。VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41在多个脱氢/再生循环中表现出更大的抗降解能力。研究包括了在第一个、第二个和第三个脱氢周期的不同时间点记录的紫外可见光谱的比较。
