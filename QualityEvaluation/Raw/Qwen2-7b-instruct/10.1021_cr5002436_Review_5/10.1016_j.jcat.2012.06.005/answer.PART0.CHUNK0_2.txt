1. "The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts DH properties was also investigated."
2. "In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled us to elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation."
3. "In contrast to these two catalysts, the structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for stable performance of the latter catalyst."
4. "The remarkable ability of VOx/MCM-41 to completely recover its DH activity and selectivity upon oxidative regeneration is explained by the fact that the nature of highly dispersed active VOx species was not changed under the reaction conditions and/or during the regener- ation."

1. The impact of hydrogen reduction on the catalytic properties of the materials was also explored.
2. In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation techniques were utilized to uncover the reasons behind catalyst deactivation.
3. The structure of the active VOx species remained unchanged on MCM-41 throughout the dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, leading to consistent performance.
4. The capacity of VOx/MCM-41 to fully restore its dehydrogenation activity and selectivity after oxidative regeneration is attributed to the unaltered nature of the highly dispersed active VOx species under the reaction conditions and during the regeneration process.

1. 氢气还原对催化剂性质的影响也进行了研究。
2. 利用原位时间分辨UV/Vis光谱和温度程序氧化方法，我们揭示了催化剂失活的原因。
3. MCM-41上的活性VOx物种在脱氢和再生周期中没有发生变化，这导致了其性能的一致性。
4. VOx/MCM-41在完全恢复其脱氢活性和选择性之后，经过氧化再生的能力，归因于在反应条件和再生过程中活性VOx物种的性质未变。
