1. "The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for DH of propane in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on a long-term stability."
2. "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature."
3. "Recently, stable and selective iso-butane DH to iso-butene was reported over highly dispersed VOx species on SiO2 supports when operating under oxygen-lean conditions (ratio of iso-C4H10/O2 > 10)."
4. "It should be stressed, however,that even the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst formed less than 2 wt.% of carbon deposits related to the total amount of propene formed."
5. "The following discussion is aimed to elucidate the role of re- duced and oxidized MeOx species in the DH reaction."
6. "As evident from Fig. 3,both reduced and oxidized catalysts lose their activity with time on-stream."
7. "However, the catalysts differ strongly in the rate of deactivation and the amount of deposits formed."
8. "The oxidation state of MeOx species also determines the deacti- vation behavior."
9. "In contrast to PtSn/Al2O3, VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 showed stronger resistance to deactivation in four consecutive DH/regeneration cycles."
10. "UV/Vis spectra recorded at different times on-stream during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd DH cycles are compared in Fig. S4."

The study aimed to investigate the use of dispersed VOx species on MCM-41 for propane dehydrogenation without gas-phase oxygen, with a focus on long-term stability. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is thermodynamically favorable due to its exothermic nature, allowing for higher conversion at lower temperatures. Recent research has shown stable and selective iso-butane to iso-butene conversion under oxygen-lean conditions. VOx/MCM-41 catalysts formed less than 2% carbon deposits relative to propene production. The study explored the role of reduced and oxidized metal oxide species in the dehydrogenation process. Catalysts lost activity over time, but the rate and amount of carbon deposition varied between catalyst types. The oxidation state of metal oxide species influenced deactivation behavior. VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 exhibited greater resistance to deactivation over multiple dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles. The study included UV/Vis spectra comparisons at different times during the first, second, and third dehydrogenation cycles.

本研究旨在探索在没有气相氧的情况下，高度分散的VOx物种在MCM-41上用于丙烷脱氢的潜力，特别是长期稳定性。氧化脱氢（ODH）从热力学角度看更吸引人，因为它的放热性允许在较低温度下实现更高的转化率。最近的研究表明，在氧气贫乏条件下（异丁烷/氧比>10），高度分散的VOx物种在SiO2支持上的异丁烷转化为异丁烯具有稳定性和选择性。VOx/MCM-41催化剂仅形成了小于2%的碳沉积物，与丙烯产量有关。研究探讨了还原和氧化金属氧化物物种在脱氢过程中的作用。催化剂随时间失去活性，但不同催化剂的降解速率和沉积碳量差异显著。金属氧化物物种的氧化状态决定了降解行为。VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41在多个脱氢/再生循环中表现出更大的抗降解能力。研究包括了在第一个、第二个和第三个脱氢周期的不同时间点记录的紫外可见光谱的比较。

[1] "In order to prove if catalyst reduction is mandatory for olefin production and for on-stream stability, catalytic tests were performed both with oxidized and reduced catalysts (Section 2.3)."
[2] "Fig. 2 compares initial spacetime yield (STY) and selectivity (S) to propene obtained within the first hour on-stream at 823 K over these materials."
[3] "In order to gain insights into long-term catalysts stability, we performed four successive dehydrogenation runs (each 24 h long) interlaid with regeneration stages the latter consisting of oxidation or oxidation/reduction for oxidized or reduced catalysts, respectively."
[4] "The propene yield in the 1st DH cycle decreased with time due to catalyst deactivation by coke deposition as will be demonstrated in Section 3.3."
[5] "Fig. 5 compares the COx profiles obtained over VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3."
[6] "It is noteworthy that the most stable VOx/MCM-41 also produced the highest amount of carbon deposits (Table 1)."
[7] "Summarizing our main findings, we shall highlight that (i) both oxidized and reduced MeOx species can function as active sites for propane dehydrogenation with the former being more active; (ii) deactivation of the catalysts results from blocking of active sites with carbonaceous deposits and gradual transformation of the structure of MeOx species caused by heat and atmosphere composition; (iii) VOx species are resistant to structural changes under the reaction conditions used in this study, which is the reason why VOx/MCM-41 activity could be fully restored by oxidative regeneration in a series of DH/regeneration cycles."

1. To verify if catalyst reduction is essential for olefin production and on-stream stability, tests were conducted with both oxidized and reduced catalysts (Section 2.3).

2. Figure 2 illustrates the initial space-time yield (STY) and selectivity (S) to propene obtained within the first hour at 823 K over various materials.

3. To explore catalyst stability over the long term, four consecutive dehydrogenation runs lasting 24 hours each were performed, alternating with regeneration stages that included oxidation or oxidation/reduction for oxidized or reduced catalysts, respectively.

4. The decrease in propene yield in the 1st dehydrogenation cycle was attributed to catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition, which will be detailed in Section 3.3.

5. Figure 5 juxtaposes the COx profiles generated for VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3.

6. Notably, the most stable VOx/MCM-41 produced the highest quantity of carbon deposits (Table 1).

7. Our key findings are as follows: (i) Both oxidized and reduced MeOx species can act as active sites for propane dehydrogenation, with the former being more active; (ii) Catalyst deactivation is caused by carbon deposits blocking active sites and the gradual transformation of MeOx species structures due to heat and atmosphere composition; (iii) VOx species resist structural changes under the utilized reaction conditions, enabling full restoration of VOx/MCM-41 activity via oxidative regeneration in a series of dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles.

1. 为了验证催化剂还原是否对于烯烃生产和在线稳定性是必要的，进行了氧化态和还原态催化剂的测试（第2.3节）。

2. 图2展示了在823 K下，第一小时内在线流中获得的初始空间时间产率（STY）和丙烯选择性（S）。

3. 为了研究催化剂的长期稳定性，进行了四次连续的脱氢反应，每次持续24小时，并且交替进行再生阶段，包括氧化或氧化/还原处理，具体取决于催化剂的状态。

4. 第1个脱氢周期中产量的降低归因于催化剂由于焦炭沉积导致的失活，这将在第3.3节中详细说明。

5. 图5比较了VOx/MCM-41、CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3的COx轮廓图。

6. 值得注意的是，最稳定的VOx/MCM-41产生了最高量的碳沉积物（表1）。

7. 我们的主要发现是：（i）无论是氧化态还是还原态的MeOx物种都可以作为丙烷脱氢的活性位点，前者更活跃；（ii）催化剂失活是由活性位点被碳沉积物堵塞以及MeOx物种结构在热和气氛组成的影响下逐渐变化引起的；（iii）VOx物种在本研究使用的条件下不易发生结构变化，因此在一系列脱氢/再生周期中通过氧化再生完全恢复了VOx/MCM-41的活性。
