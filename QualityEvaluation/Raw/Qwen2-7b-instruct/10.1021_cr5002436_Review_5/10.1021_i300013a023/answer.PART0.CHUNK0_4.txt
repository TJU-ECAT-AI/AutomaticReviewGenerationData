The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. These steps are:

1. Activation of the molecule to form a complex with the catalyst.
2. Rearrangement of the molecule within the complex.
3. Deprotonation of the complex.
4. Release of the dehydrogenated product.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The exact rate-determining step can depend on factors such as the specific reaction conditions, the nature of the catalyst, and the substrate being used.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a subject of interest due to its fundamental importance in understanding dehydrogenation reactions, which are crucial in many industrial processes including petrochemical refining and organic synthesis. The mechanism provides insights into how molecules interact with catalyst surfaces and undergo chemical transformations, which can guide the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction conditions.

The paper discusses the impact of hydrogenation on pyrolysis yields. Hydrogenation not only removes sulfur but also significantly alters product yields upon pyrolysis. The process leads to increased olefin, fuel gas, and aromatic yields while drastically reducing fuel oil yields. This has implications for improving the efficiency of cracking processes and reducing environmental impacts associated with pyrolysis.

Four gas oils were used in the study: Coastal B-1 Mix (CB-l), West Texas Sour, Nigerian Forcados, and Kuwait crude oils. These oils were hydrogenated to investigate the effects on cracking yields.

The study notes that the spread in ethylene yields between hydrogenated and nonhydrogenated gas oils falls within a narrow range for each feedstock at each severity. The differences in ethylene yields vary between 1.5 and 2.7% across all cases. This indicates that the incremental increases in observed ethylene yields tend to decrease as the level of feedstock aromatic saturation increases.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。这些步骤是：

1. 分子被激活形成与催化剂的复合物。
2. 复合物内的分子进行重排。
3. 复合物去质子化。
4. 释放脱氢产物。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的争论仍然是科学界关注的话题。确切的速率决定步骤可能取决于反应条件、催化剂的性质以及所使用的基团等因素。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是一个研究的主题，因为它对于理解脱氢反应的基本原理至关重要，这对于包括石油精炼和有机合成在内的许多工业过程非常重要。该机制提供了分子如何与催化剂表面相互作用并经历化学变化的见解，这可以指导开发更高效的催化剂和反应条件。

论文讨论了氢化对裂解产物产率的影响。氢化不仅去除硫，而且显著改变裂解产物的产率。该过程导致增加烯烃、燃料气体和芳烃的产率，同时大大减少燃料油的产率。这对提高裂解过程效率和降低与裂解相关的环境影响有重要意义。

研究使用了四种汽油油：Coastal B-1 Mix（CB-l）、West Texas Sour、Nigerian Forcados和Kuwait原油。这些油被氢化以研究其对裂解产率的影响。

研究指出，氢化和非氢化汽油油之间乙烯产率的差异在每种原料和每个严重程度上都保持在一个狭窄的范围内。乙烯产量的变化范围为所有情况下的1.5%至2.7%。这意味着观察到的乙烯产量的增量倾向于随着原料芳香饱和度的增加而减少。
