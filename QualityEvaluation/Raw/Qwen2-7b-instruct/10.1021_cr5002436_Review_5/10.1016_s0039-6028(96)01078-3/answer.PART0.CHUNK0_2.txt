The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. These steps are:

1. **Adsorption**: The reactant molecule is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface.
2. **Activation**: The adsorbed molecule undergoes activation, often involving the breaking of a bond and the creation of an activated species.
3. **Reaction**: The activated species undergoes a reaction to form products.
4. **Desorption**: The products are desorbed from the surface.

Regarding the ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting, the specific details vary depending on the reaction and catalyst involved. However, in the context of the document, the conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne is mentioned as being complex and possibly not involving an ethyl intermediate, but rather an ethylidene moiety. This indicates that the conversion step itself might be rate-limiting. The exact nature of the debate depends on the specifics of the reaction mechanism, catalyst properties, and reaction conditions.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of catalytic reactions, the influence of various factors such as catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the intricate nature of surface chemistry. The detailed mechanisms, including the identification of intermediates and the precise sequence of steps, continue to evolve with new findings and theoretical developments. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes and developing more efficient catalysts.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤。这些步骤是：

1. **吸附**：反应物分子被吸附到催化剂表面上。
2. **激活**：吸附的分子经历激活，通常涉及键的断裂和活性物种的产生。
3. **反应**：激活的物种经历反应形成产物。
4. **脱附**：产物从表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的，具体细节取决于反应和催化剂的类型。然而，在文档的上下文中，乙烯转化为乙基炔的过程被描述为复杂且可能不涉及乙基中间体，而是涉及乙基二烯体。这表明转化步骤本身可能是决定性的。争论的具体性质取决于反应机制、催化剂特性和反应条件的特定细节。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的主题，因为催化反应的复杂性、各种因素的影响（如催化剂类型、反应条件和表面化学的细微差别）以及反应机制的详细信息继续发展。理解这些机制对于优化催化过程和开发更高效的催化剂至关重要。
