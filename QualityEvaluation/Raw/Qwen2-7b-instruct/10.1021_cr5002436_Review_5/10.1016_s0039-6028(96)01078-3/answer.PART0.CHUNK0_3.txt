[1] "The present paper summarizes the results from some of our most recent studies on the chemistry of ethylene on platinum surfaces."
[2] "It is apparent from the brief review provided here that even though some progress has been made on the understanding of this chemistry at a molecular level, most of the key questions still remain unan- swered."
[3] "This reaction is inhibited considerably by the competitive formation of ethylidyne, since this last species is particu- larly stable and hard to rehydrogenate."
[4] "All these ideas are illustrated schematically in Fig. 4."
[5] "The other important observation to keep in mind from this work is the fact that the kinetics of the relevant surface reactions are greatly affected by both the coverages of the different surface species and the availability of surface free sites."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, such as ethane, to produce alkynes. It consists of four main steps:

1. **Activation of the alkane molecule**: The alkane molecule is activated by a catalyst, typically a metal surface, forming an adsorbed alkyl intermediate.
2. **Hydrogen atom migration**: A hydrogen atom migrates from the alkane molecule to the adsorbed alkyl group, creating a carbocation-like intermediate.
3. **Formation of a double bond**: The carbocation-like intermediate rearranges to form a carbon-carbon double bond, releasing energy and producing an alkyne.
4. **Desorption of the alkyne**: The newly formed alkyne molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is mainly centered on the activation of the alkane molecule and the hydrogen atom migration steps. Some researchers propose that the activation step is rate-limiting due to the difficulty in adsorbing the alkane molecule efficiently, especially at lower temperatures. Others argue that the hydrogen atom migration step might be rate-limiting because of the stability of the carbocation-like intermediate and the energy barriers involved in its rearrangement to form the double bond.

Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. This is primarily because the actual conditions under which the mechanism operates can vary widely depending on factors such as the specific catalyst used, the temperature, and the pressure. These variations can lead to differences in the relative rates of the steps, influencing which step might be considered rate-limiting under different circumstances.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了烷烃，如乙烷，催化脱氢生成烯烃的过程。它包含四个主要步骤：

1. **烷烃分子的活化**：烷烃分子在催化剂（通常是金属表面）的作用下被活化，形成吸附的烷基中间体。
2. **氢原子迁移**：一个氢原子从烷烃分子迁移到吸附的烷基上，形成类似于碳正离子的中间体。
3. **双键的形成**：碳正离子样中间体重新排列形成碳-碳双键，释放能量并产生一种烯烃。
4. **烯烃的脱附**：新形成的烯烃分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于霍里图-波兰尼机制中哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的争论主要集中在烷烃分子的活化和氢原子迁移步骤。一些研究人员认为活化步骤是速率限制步骤，因为低温下有效地吸附烷烃分子可能很困难。其他人则认为氢原子迁移步骤可能是速率限制步骤，因为碳正离子样中间体的稳定性以及形成双键时涉及的能量壁垒。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。这主要是因为实际条件下机制的操作条件可以大不相同，取决于所使用的具体催化剂、温度和压力等因素。这些变化可能导致不同步骤的相对速率不同，影响在不同情况下哪一步可能被认为是速率限制步骤。
