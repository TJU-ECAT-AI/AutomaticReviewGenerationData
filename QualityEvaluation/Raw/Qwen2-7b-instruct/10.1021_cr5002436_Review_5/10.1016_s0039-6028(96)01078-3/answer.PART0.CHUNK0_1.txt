[1] "The chemistry of ethylene on platinum surfaces has proven quite complex because it involves the simultaneous occurrence of several reactions, namely molecular desorption, dehydrogenation to ethylidyne, H-D exchange within the adsorbed molecules, and hydrogenation to ethane."
[2] "The conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne is most likely a complex reaction, but it probably does not involve an ethyl intermediate, as the hydrogenation and H-D exchange processes, but an ethylidene moiety instead."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, which explains the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, involves four main steps: the adsorption of the substrate molecule, activation by a catalyst, the formation of an unstable intermediate, and the desorption of the product. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying which step is rate-limiting in these reactions. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy because of the complexity of the reactions and the difficulty in pinpointing the exact rate-determining step. The mechanism's relevance lies in its application to industrial processes, such as the cracking of hydrocarbons, where understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of dehydrogenation is crucial for optimizing efficiency and yield.
