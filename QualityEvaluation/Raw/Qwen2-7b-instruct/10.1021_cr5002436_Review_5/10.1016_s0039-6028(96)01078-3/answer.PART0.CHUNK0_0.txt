[1] "The chemistry of ethylene on platinum surfaces has proven quite complex because it involves the simultaneous occurrence of several reactions, namely molecular desorption, dehydrogenation to ethylidyne, H-D exchange within the adsorbed molecules, and hydrogenation to ethane."
[2] "The conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne is most likely a complex reaction, but it probably does not involve an ethyl intermediate, as the hydrogenation and H-D exchange processes, but an ethylidene moiety instead."
[3] "The conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne is accompanied by exchange of hydrogen for deuterium atoms."
[4] "The reaction which perhaps has received the most attention in relation to the thermal reactivity of ethylene chemisorbed on transition metal surfaces is its conversion to ethylidyne."
[5] "The kinetics of the relevant surface reactions are greatly affected by both the coverages of the different surface species and the availability of surface free sites."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions typically involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface. 
2. Activation of the substrate molecule, often involving breaking of one or more bonds.
3. Formation of an intermediate compound on the surface.
4. Desorption of the product from the surface. 

Regarding which step is considered rate-limiting, there is ongoing debate. Some argue that the adsorption step is rate-limiting, while others suggest it might be the desorption step. The choice depends on the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the substrate and catalyst.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the catalytic process, the influence of various factors such as temperature, pressure, and substrate concentration, and the difficulty in precisely controlling and observing these processes at the surface level.

The complex nature of ethylene reactions on platinum surfaces, including dehydrogenation, H-D exchange, and hydrogenation, adds to the intrigue and challenges in understanding and applying catalytic mechanisms. The availability of surface free sites and the coverages of different surface species play crucial roles in determining the rates of these reactions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制通常包含四个主要步骤：
1. 将底物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 激活底物分子，往往涉及断裂一个或多个键。
3. 在表面上形成中间化合物。
4. 产物从表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的，存在争议。一些人认为吸附步骤是决定性的，而其他人则认为可能是脱附步骤。选择取决于特定的反应条件和底物及催化剂的性质。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，这个机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，原因在于催化过程的复杂性，各种因素如温度、压力和底物浓度的影响，以及在表面水平上精确控制和观察这些过程的困难。

铂表面的乙烷反应的复杂性，包括脱氢、H-D交换和氢化，增加了理解和应用催化机制的吸引力和挑战。表面自由位点的可用性和不同表面物种的覆盖度在确定这些反应速率方面起着关键作用。
