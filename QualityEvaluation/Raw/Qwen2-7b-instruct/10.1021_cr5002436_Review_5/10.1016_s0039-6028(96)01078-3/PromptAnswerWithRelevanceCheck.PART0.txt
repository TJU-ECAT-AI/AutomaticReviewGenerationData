[1] "The chemistry of ethylene on platinum surfaces has proven quite complex because it involves the simultaneous occurrence of several reactions, namely molecular desorption, dehydrogenation to ethylidyne, H-D exchange within the adsorbed molecules, and hydrogenation to ethane."
[2] "The conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne is most likely a complex reaction, but it probably does not involve an ethyl intermediate, as the hydrogenation and H-D exchange processes, but an ethylidene moiety instead."
[3] "The conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne is accompanied by exchange of hydrogen for deuterium atoms."
[4] "The reaction which perhaps has received the most attention in relation to the thermal reactivity of ethylene chemisorbed on transition metal surfaces is its conversion to ethylidyne."
[5] "The kinetics of the relevant surface reactions are greatly affected by both the coverages of the different surface species and the availability of surface free sites."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions typically involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface. 
2. Activation of the substrate molecule, often involving breaking of one or more bonds.
3. Formation of an intermediate compound on the surface.
4. Desorption of the product from the surface. 

Regarding which step is considered rate-limiting, there is ongoing debate. Some argue that the adsorption step is rate-limiting, while others suggest it might be the desorption step. The choice depends on the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the substrate and catalyst.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the catalytic process, the influence of various factors such as temperature, pressure, and substrate concentration, and the difficulty in precisely controlling and observing these processes at the surface level.

The complex nature of ethylene reactions on platinum surfaces, including dehydrogenation, H-D exchange, and hydrogenation, adds to the intrigue and challenges in understanding and applying catalytic mechanisms. The availability of surface free sites and the coverages of different surface species play crucial roles in determining the rates of these reactions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制通常包含四个主要步骤：
1. 将底物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 激活底物分子，往往涉及断裂一个或多个键。
3. 在表面上形成中间化合物。
4. 产物从表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的，存在争议。一些人认为吸附步骤是决定性的，而其他人则认为可能是脱附步骤。选择取决于特定的反应条件和底物及催化剂的性质。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，这个机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，原因在于催化过程的复杂性，各种因素如温度、压力和底物浓度的影响，以及在表面水平上精确控制和观察这些过程的困难。

铂表面的乙烷反应的复杂性，包括脱氢、H-D交换和氢化，增加了理解和应用催化机制的吸引力和挑战。表面自由位点的可用性和不同表面物种的覆盖度在确定这些反应速率方面起着关键作用。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, which explains the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, involves four main steps: the adsorption of the substrate molecule, activation by a catalyst, the formation of an unstable intermediate, and the desorption of the product. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying which step is rate-limiting in these reactions. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy because of the complexity of the reactions and the difficulty in pinpointing the exact rate-determining step. The mechanism's relevance lies in its application to industrial processes, such as the cracking of hydrocarbons, where understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of dehydrogenation is crucial for optimizing efficiency and yield.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. These steps are:

1. **Adsorption**: The reactant molecule is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface.
2. **Activation**: The adsorbed molecule undergoes activation, often involving the breaking of a bond and the creation of an activated species.
3. **Reaction**: The activated species undergoes a reaction to form products.
4. **Desorption**: The products are desorbed from the surface.

Regarding the ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting, the specific details vary depending on the reaction and catalyst involved. However, in the context of the document, the conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne is mentioned as being complex and possibly not involving an ethyl intermediate, but rather an ethylidene moiety. This indicates that the conversion step itself might be rate-limiting. The exact nature of the debate depends on the specifics of the reaction mechanism, catalyst properties, and reaction conditions.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of catalytic reactions, the influence of various factors such as catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the intricate nature of surface chemistry. The detailed mechanisms, including the identification of intermediates and the precise sequence of steps, continue to evolve with new findings and theoretical developments. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes and developing more efficient catalysts.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤。这些步骤是：

1. **吸附**：反应物分子被吸附到催化剂表面上。
2. **激活**：吸附的分子经历激活，通常涉及键的断裂和活性物种的产生。
3. **反应**：激活的物种经历反应形成产物。
4. **脱附**：产物从表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的，具体细节取决于反应和催化剂的类型。然而，在文档的上下文中，乙烯转化为乙基炔的过程被描述为复杂且可能不涉及乙基中间体，而是涉及乙基二烯体。这表明转化步骤本身可能是决定性的。争论的具体性质取决于反应机制、催化剂特性和反应条件的特定细节。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的主题，因为催化反应的复杂性、各种因素的影响（如催化剂类型、反应条件和表面化学的细微差别）以及反应机制的详细信息继续发展。理解这些机制对于优化催化过程和开发更高效的催化剂至关重要。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, such as ethane, to produce alkynes. It consists of four main steps:

1. **Activation of the alkane molecule**: The alkane molecule is activated by a catalyst, typically a metal surface, forming an adsorbed alkyl intermediate.
2. **Hydrogen atom migration**: A hydrogen atom migrates from the alkane molecule to the adsorbed alkyl group, creating a carbocation-like intermediate.
3. **Formation of a double bond**: The carbocation-like intermediate rearranges to form a carbon-carbon double bond, releasing energy and producing an alkyne.
4. **Desorption of the alkyne**: The newly formed alkyne molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is mainly centered on the activation of the alkane molecule and the hydrogen atom migration steps. Some researchers propose that the activation step is rate-limiting due to the difficulty in adsorbing the alkane molecule efficiently, especially at lower temperatures. Others argue that the hydrogen atom migration step might be rate-limiting because of the stability of the carbocation-like intermediate and the energy barriers involved in its rearrangement to form the double bond.

Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. This is primarily because the actual conditions under which the mechanism operates can vary widely depending on factors such as the specific catalyst used, the temperature, and the pressure. These variations can lead to differences in the relative rates of the steps, influencing which step might be considered rate-limiting under different circumstances.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了烷烃，如乙烷，催化脱氢生成烯烃的过程。它包含四个主要步骤：

1. **烷烃分子的活化**：烷烃分子在催化剂（通常是金属表面）的作用下被活化，形成吸附的烷基中间体。
2. **氢原子迁移**：一个氢原子从烷烃分子迁移到吸附的烷基上，形成类似于碳正离子的中间体。
3. **双键的形成**：碳正离子样中间体重新排列形成碳-碳双键，释放能量并产生一种烯烃。
4. **烯烃的脱附**：新形成的烯烃分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于霍里图-波兰尼机制中哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的争论主要集中在烷烃分子的活化和氢原子迁移步骤。一些研究人员认为活化步骤是速率限制步骤，因为低温下有效地吸附烷烃分子可能很困难。其他人则认为氢原子迁移步骤可能是速率限制步骤，因为碳正离子样中间体的稳定性以及形成双键时涉及的能量壁垒。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。这主要是因为实际条件下机制的操作条件可以大不相同，取决于所使用的具体催化剂、温度和压力等因素。这些变化可能导致不同步骤的相对速率不同，影响在不同情况下哪一步可能被认为是速率限制步骤。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study. The mechanism consists of four main steps: activation of the hydrogen molecule, cleavage of the hydrogen-hydrogen bond, migration of the hydrogen atom to the surface, and finally, the formation of the product molecule. The ongoing debate revolves around which of these steps is considered rate-limiting. While there is consensus on the first three steps, the fourth step, product formation, often raises controversy. Some researchers argue that the rate-limiting step might actually be the migration of the hydrogen atom, as it requires overcoming an energy barrier. However, others suggest that the product formation step could be rate-limiting, especially if the product formation is not as straightforward as initially thought. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it plays a crucial role in various industrial processes, such as the production of ethylene from ethane, and understanding the details of the mechanism could lead to improvements in efficiency and selectivity.
