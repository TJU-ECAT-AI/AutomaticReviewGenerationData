[1] "The conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne is most likely a complex reaction, but it probably does not involve an ethyl intermediate, as the hydrogenation and H-D exchange processes, but an ethylidene moiety instead."
[2] "This reaction is inhibited considerably by the competitive formation of ethylidyne, since this last species is particularly stable and hard to rehydrogenate."
[3] "The conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne is most likely a complex reaction, but it probably does not involve an ethyl intermediate, as the hydrogenation and H-D exchange processes, but an ethylidene moiety instead."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study. The mechanism consists of four main steps: activation of the hydrogen molecule, cleavage of the hydrogen-hydrogen bond, migration of the hydrogen atom to the surface, and finally, the formation of the product molecule. The ongoing debate revolves around which of these steps is considered rate-limiting. While there is consensus on the first three steps, the fourth step, product formation, often raises controversy. Some researchers argue that the rate-limiting step might actually be the migration of the hydrogen atom, as it requires overcoming an energy barrier. However, others suggest that the product formation step could be rate-limiting, especially if the product formation is not as straightforward as initially thought. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it plays a crucial role in various industrial processes, such as the production of ethylene from ethane, and understanding the details of the mechanism could lead to improvements in efficiency and selectivity.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，仍然是科学界的一个兴趣点和争议焦点。该机制包括四个主要步骤：氢分子的活化、氢-氢键的断裂、氢原子向表面的迁移，最后是产品的形成。围绕哪一步是决定性的步骤的争论持续存在。虽然对前三个步骤有共识，但第四步，即产物的形成，经常引发争议。一些研究人员认为，决定性步骤可能是氢原子的迁移，因为它需要克服能量障碍。然而，其他人则认为，如果产物形成不像最初想象的那样简单，那么产物形成步骤可能是决定性的。这个机制仍然是科学界关注的焦点，因为它在各种工业过程中起着关键作用，如将乙烷转化为乙烯。理解机制的细节可能有助于提高效率和选择性。
