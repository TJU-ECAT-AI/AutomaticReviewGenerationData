Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<quotes>
[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps."
[2] "These steps are: (1) adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the substrate through interaction with the catalyst, (3) dehydrogenation or cleavage of the substrate, and (4) desorption of the product from the catalyst surface."
[3] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest and controversy."
[4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the precise role of each step in the mechanism remains unclear."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps: adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface, activation of the substrate through interaction with the catalyst, dehydrogenation or cleavage of the substrate, and desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The debate about which of these steps is rate-limiting continues to be a subject of scientific interest and controversy, even after almost a century of investigation. The exact role of each step in the mechanism is still uncertain.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：底物吸附到催化剂表面，通过与催化剂相互作用激活底物，底物脱氢或断裂，以及产物从催化剂表面脱附。关于哪个步骤是速率限制性的争论仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，即使经过近一个世纪的研究。机制中每个步骤的确切作用仍然不确定。
