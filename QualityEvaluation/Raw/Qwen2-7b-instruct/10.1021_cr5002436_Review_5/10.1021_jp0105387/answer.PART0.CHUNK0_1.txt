[1] "The thermal decomposition of halide derivatives of hydrocarbons on solid surfaces has become a well-established method for the preparation of unstable adsorbates of interest in catalytic reactions."
[2] "There are already a few reports available on the surface chemistry of metallacycles on transition metals. In those, a number of different thermally induced reaction pathways have been identified, including metallacycle decomposition to hydrogen and surface carbon, isomerization to propene, hydrogenation to propane, and CC coupling to cyclopropane."
[3] "It was concluded that, when in the presence of coadsorbed hydrogen (or deuterium), propylene hydrogenates easily to form 1- and 2-propyl surface species, and that it otherwise dehydrogenates to propylidyne."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions in which hydrogen is removed from an organic molecule, typically forming an alkene. The mechanism comprises four main steps: (1) hydrogen abstraction from the α-C of an alkyl group, (2) migration of the hydrogen to the β-C, (3) breaking of the C-C bond, and (4) formation of the alkene. The ongoing debate surrounds which of these steps is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the rate-limiting step is the hydrogen abstraction from the α-C, while others suggest it might be the hydrogen migration or the C-C bond cleavage. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to its fundamental role in various industrial processes, including petrochemical refining and the production of olefins. Understanding the precise rate-limiting step can aid in optimizing catalysts and improving reaction efficiency.

霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化剂下有机分子脱氢形成烯烃的过程。该机制包含四个主要步骤：（1）从α-C摘取氢原子，（2）氢原子迁移到β-C，（3）断裂C-C键，（4）形成烯烃。关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤的争论持续存在。一些研究人员认为限制步骤是α-C摘取氢原子，而其他人则认为可能是氢迁移或C-C键断裂。尽管该机制已经研究了近一个世纪，但其仍然是科学领域的一个兴趣点和争议话题，因为其在各种工业过程中的关键作用，包括石油精炼和烯烃生产。理解精确的速率限制步骤有助于优化催化剂并提高反应效率。
