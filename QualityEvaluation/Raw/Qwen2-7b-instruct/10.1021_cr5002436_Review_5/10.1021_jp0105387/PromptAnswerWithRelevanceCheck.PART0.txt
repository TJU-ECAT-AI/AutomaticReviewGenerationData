The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions in which hydrogen is removed from an organic molecule, typically forming an alkene. The mechanism comprises four main steps: (1) hydrogen abstraction from the α-C of an alkyl group, (2) migration of the hydrogen to the β-C, (3) breaking of the C-C bond, and (4) formation of the alkene. The ongoing debate surrounds which of these steps is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the rate-limiting step is the hydrogen abstraction from the α-C, while others suggest it might be the hydrogen migration or the C-C bond cleavage. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to its fundamental role in various industrial processes, including petrochemical refining and the production of olefins. Understanding the precise rate-limiting step can aid in optimizing catalysts and improving reaction efficiency.

[1] "The formation of propene and propane from the C3 metallacycle is limited by the availability of surface hydrogen. In fact, a significant increase in propane yield is observed when the TPD experiments are carried out in the presence of (predosed) surface hydrogen. This is due not only to an enhancement of the hydrogenation of the allyl, propene, and propyl surface intermediates, but also to the opening of a more direct hydrogenation mechanism."
[2] "Last, it is worth saying a few words about the effect of the coadsorbed halogen deposited during the preparation of metallacyclic intermediates on the platinum surface by using dihaloalkanes. This is an issue of some importance, since coadsorbed species are known to modify the electronic properties of metal catalysts."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity and interplay between these steps. The mechanism typically starts with the adsorption of an alkyl group onto the catalyst surface. Next, hydrogen atoms from the alkyl group are removed via β-hydride elimination, forming an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical then reacts with molecular oxygen to form an alkylperoxide. Finally, the alkylperoxide decomposes, releasing the alkene product. The exact step that limits the reaction rate varies depending on the alkyl group, the catalyst, and the reaction conditions.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The reason for this is the intricate nature of the reactions involved, which can be influenced by numerous factors such as surface chemistry, kinetic barriers, and the presence of competing pathways. Understanding which step is rate-limiting is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and developing more efficient dehydrogenation processes.

The presence of coadsorbed halogen species during the preparation of metallacyclic intermediates on the catalyst surface is an important consideration. These species can modify the electronic properties of the metal catalyst, potentially affecting the catalytic activity and selectivity of the dehydrogenation reaction. Investigating the impact of coadsorbed halogens on the mechanism and kinetics of dehydrogenation reactions is critical for improving catalyst design and understanding the underlying chemistry.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性的问题仍在争论中，这归因于这些步骤之间的复杂性和相互作用。机制通常从吸附在催化剂表面的烷基团开始。接下来，从烷基团中去除氢原子通过β-氢消除形成烷基自由基。烷基自由基随后与分子氧反应形成烷基过氧化物。最后，烷基过氧化物分解，释放烯烃产品。决定反应速率的具体步骤取决于烷基团、催化剂和反应条件而变化。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。原因在于反应涉及到的复杂性质，这些性质可能受到多种因素的影响，如表面化学、动力学壁垒和竞争途径的存在。理解哪个步骤是速率限制性的对于优化催化剂性能和开发更高效的脱氢过程至关重要。

催化剂表面上制备金属环状中间体时共吸附卤素物种的存在是一个重要考虑因素。这些物种可以改变金属催化剂的电子性质，可能影响脱氢反应的活性和选择性。研究共吸附卤素对脱氢反应机制和动力学的影响对于改进催化剂设计和理解基础化学至关重要。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a well-studied concept in chemical kinetics that describes the process of breaking a hydrogen bond in the presence of a catalyst. The mechanism is divided into four main steps:

1. **Activation**: The substrate molecule approaches the catalyst and adsorbs onto its surface. This is often facilitated by hydrogen molecules or atoms present on the catalyst surface.

2. **Bond Formation**: A hydrogen molecule or atom from the catalyst surface binds to the substrate, forming a new hydrogen-substrate bond. This step is rate-limiting and often involves a concerted mechanism.

3. **Deactivation**: The hydrogen-substrate bond is broken, releasing the dehydrogenated product and regenerating the catalyst surface. This is typically a fast step.

4. **Product Release**: The dehydrogenated product desorbs from the catalyst surface, completing the cycle.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting primarily revolves around the bond formation and deactivation steps. The bond formation step is often thought to be the rate-limiting step due to the high energy barrier involved in breaking the hydrogen-hydrogen bond. However, the deactivation step can also be rate-limiting if it involves a slow regeneration process of the catalyst surface.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The complexity of catalytic processes, the influence of various reaction conditions, and the diversity of catalysts and substrates contribute to the ongoing debate. Researchers continue to refine the understanding of these mechanisms, aiming to optimize catalyst design and reaction conditions for more efficient dehydrogenation processes.

霍里图-波拉尼机制是催化脱氢反应的一个广泛研究的概念，描述了在催化剂存在的条件下断裂氢键的过程。该机制分为四个主要步骤：

1. **激活**：底物分子接近催化剂并吸附到其表面。这通常得益于催化剂表面上存在的氢分子或原子的促进作用。

2. **键形成**：催化剂表面的一个氢分子或原子与底物结合，形成一个新的氢-底物键。这个步骤通常是速率决定性的，并且通常涉及一个协同机制。

3. **去活化**：氢-底物键被断裂，释放出脱氢产物并再生催化剂表面。这是一个通常较快的步骤。

4. **产物释放**：脱氢产物从催化剂表面释放出来，完成循环。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定性的，主要围绕结合和去活化步骤进行争论。结合步骤通常被认为是最慢的步骤，因为需要克服氢-氢键断裂的高能量壁垒。然而，如果去活化过程涉及缓慢的催化剂表面再生过程，它也可能成为速率决定性的。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这种机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。催化过程的复杂性、各种反应条件的影响以及催化剂和底物的多样性共同推动了这一持续的争论。研究人员继续细化对这些机制的理解，旨在优化催化剂设计和反应条件以实现更高效的脱氢过程。

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes on transition metal surfaces, primarily focusing on the sequential steps of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. It comprises four main steps:

1. **Initial adsorption**: Alkane molecules adsorb onto the metal surface.
2. **Hydrogenation**: Hydrogen atoms are added to the alkane molecule, forming an alkyl intermediate.
3. **Dehydrogenation**: The alkyl intermediate undergoes dehydrogenation, often via β-hydride elimination, to form an alkene.
4. **Olefin interconversion**: Rapid interconversion of olefins to alkanes occurs through hydrogenation.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is due to the complex interplay between hydrogenation and dehydrogenation rates. While hydrogenation is generally favored by the abundance of surface hydrogen, dehydrogenation can proceed via β-hydride elimination, which is a faster step. The balance between these reactions determines the efficiency of dehydrogenation.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because:

- The actual rate-determining step can vary depending on the alkane structure, metal surface, and reaction conditions.
- The mechanism's applicability extends beyond simple alkanes to include more complex molecules and reactions.
- The role of surface chemistry and electronic effects on the mechanism is not yet fully understood.
- The mechanism's limitations in explaining certain phenomena, such as the preference for γ- versus α-hydride elimination on different metal surfaces, highlight the need for further research.

In summary, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it captures the essence of alkane dehydrogenation on metal surfaces but requires refinement to account for the complexities and variations observed in real-world catalytic systems.

回答：霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了过渡金属表面上烷烃的催化脱氢，主要关注四个主要步骤：

1. **初始吸附**：烷烃分子吸附到金属表面。
2. **加氢**：氢原子添加到烷烃分子上，形成烷基中间体。
3. **脱氢**：烷基中间体通过β氢消除等途径进行脱氢，形成烯烃。
4. **烯烃互变**：通过氢化作用快速将烯烃转化为烷烃。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的，争论在于氢化和脱氢过程之间的复杂相互作用。虽然氢化通常由表面氢的丰富性所促进，但脱氢通过β氢消除等途径进行，这通常是一个更快的步骤。这些反应之间的平衡决定了脱氢的效率。

尽管研究已经持续了近一个世纪，但霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为：

- 实际上决定性的步骤可能因烷烃结构、金属表面和反应条件的不同而变化。
- 该机制适用于简单烷烃之外的更复杂分子和反应。
- 表面化学和电子效应对机制的影响尚未完全理解。
- 机制无法解释某些现象，如不同金属表面上γ-与α-脱氢的偏好，这强调了进一步研究的必要性。

简而言之，霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它捕捉了金属表面烷烃脱氢的本质，但需要进一步完善以适应实际催化系统中观察到的复杂性和差异。
