[1] "The thermal chemistry of platinacyclobutane surface moieties is mainly defined by a competition between hydrogenation and decomposition reactions."
[2] "Moreover, because hydrogenation steps are limited by the availability of surface hydrogen, the conversion of C3 intermediates to propyl and propane on clean platinum is controlled by the decomposition of the surface species."
[3] "As a consequence of all this, there is a wealth of chemistry that occurs simultaneously on the surface."
[4] "Such complexity can nevertheless be minimized by facilitating hydrogenation reaction pathways via the prior provision of hydrogen to the system."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a well-studied concept in chemical kinetics that describes the process of breaking a hydrogen bond in the presence of a catalyst. The mechanism is divided into four main steps:

1. **Activation**: The substrate molecule approaches the catalyst and adsorbs onto its surface. This is often facilitated by hydrogen molecules or atoms present on the catalyst surface.

2. **Bond Formation**: A hydrogen molecule or atom from the catalyst surface binds to the substrate, forming a new hydrogen-substrate bond. This step is rate-limiting and often involves a concerted mechanism.

3. **Deactivation**: The hydrogen-substrate bond is broken, releasing the dehydrogenated product and regenerating the catalyst surface. This is typically a fast step.

4. **Product Release**: The dehydrogenated product desorbs from the catalyst surface, completing the cycle.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting primarily revolves around the bond formation and deactivation steps. The bond formation step is often thought to be the rate-limiting step due to the high energy barrier involved in breaking the hydrogen-hydrogen bond. However, the deactivation step can also be rate-limiting if it involves a slow regeneration process of the catalyst surface.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The complexity of catalytic processes, the influence of various reaction conditions, and the diversity of catalysts and substrates contribute to the ongoing debate. Researchers continue to refine the understanding of these mechanisms, aiming to optimize catalyst design and reaction conditions for more efficient dehydrogenation processes.

霍里图-波拉尼机制是催化脱氢反应的一个广泛研究的概念，描述了在催化剂存在的条件下断裂氢键的过程。该机制分为四个主要步骤：

1. **激活**：底物分子接近催化剂并吸附到其表面。这通常得益于催化剂表面上存在的氢分子或原子的促进作用。

2. **键形成**：催化剂表面的一个氢分子或原子与底物结合，形成一个新的氢-底物键。这个步骤通常是速率决定性的，并且通常涉及一个协同机制。

3. **去活化**：氢-底物键被断裂，释放出脱氢产物并再生催化剂表面。这是一个通常较快的步骤。

4. **产物释放**：脱氢产物从催化剂表面释放出来，完成循环。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定性的，主要围绕结合和去活化步骤进行争论。结合步骤通常被认为是最慢的步骤，因为需要克服氢-氢键断裂的高能量壁垒。然而，如果去活化过程涉及缓慢的催化剂表面再生过程，它也可能成为速率决定性的。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这种机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。催化过程的复杂性、各种反应条件的影响以及催化剂和底物的多样性共同推动了这一持续的争论。研究人员继续细化对这些机制的理解，旨在优化催化剂设计和反应条件以实现更高效的脱氢过程。
