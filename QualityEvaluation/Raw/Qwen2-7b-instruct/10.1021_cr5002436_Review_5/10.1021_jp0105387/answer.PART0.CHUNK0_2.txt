[1] "The formation of propene and propane from the C3 metallacycle is limited by the availability of surface hydrogen. In fact, a significant increase in propane yield is observed when the TPD experiments are carried out in the presence of (predosed) surface hydrogen. This is due not only to an enhancement of the hydrogenation of the allyl, propene, and propyl surface intermediates, but also to the opening of a more direct hydrogenation mechanism."
[2] "Last, it is worth saying a few words about the effect of the coadsorbed halogen deposited during the preparation of metallacyclic intermediates on the platinum surface by using dihaloalkanes. This is an issue of some importance, since coadsorbed species are known to modify the electronic properties of metal catalysts."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity and interplay between these steps. The mechanism typically starts with the adsorption of an alkyl group onto the catalyst surface. Next, hydrogen atoms from the alkyl group are removed via β-hydride elimination, forming an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical then reacts with molecular oxygen to form an alkylperoxide. Finally, the alkylperoxide decomposes, releasing the alkene product. The exact step that limits the reaction rate varies depending on the alkyl group, the catalyst, and the reaction conditions.

Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The reason for this is the intricate nature of the reactions involved, which can be influenced by numerous factors such as surface chemistry, kinetic barriers, and the presence of competing pathways. Understanding which step is rate-limiting is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and developing more efficient dehydrogenation processes.

The presence of coadsorbed halogen species during the preparation of metallacyclic intermediates on the catalyst surface is an important consideration. These species can modify the electronic properties of the metal catalyst, potentially affecting the catalytic activity and selectivity of the dehydrogenation reaction. Investigating the impact of coadsorbed halogens on the mechanism and kinetics of dehydrogenation reactions is critical for improving catalyst design and understanding the underlying chemistry.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性的问题仍在争论中，这归因于这些步骤之间的复杂性和相互作用。机制通常从吸附在催化剂表面的烷基团开始。接下来，从烷基团中去除氢原子通过β-氢消除形成烷基自由基。烷基自由基随后与分子氧反应形成烷基过氧化物。最后，烷基过氧化物分解，释放烯烃产品。决定反应速率的具体步骤取决于烷基团、催化剂和反应条件而变化。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但该机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。原因在于反应涉及到的复杂性质，这些性质可能受到多种因素的影响，如表面化学、动力学壁垒和竞争途径的存在。理解哪个步骤是速率限制性的对于优化催化剂性能和开发更高效的脱氢过程至关重要。

催化剂表面上制备金属环状中间体时共吸附卤素物种的存在是一个重要考虑因素。这些物种可以改变金属催化剂的电子性质，可能影响脱氢反应的活性和选择性。研究共吸附卤素对脱氢反应机制和动力学的影响对于改进催化剂设计和理解基础化学至关重要。
