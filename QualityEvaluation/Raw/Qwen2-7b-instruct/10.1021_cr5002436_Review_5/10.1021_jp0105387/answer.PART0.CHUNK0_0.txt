[1] "In this section, we analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is based on four main steps."
[3] "The mechanism proceeds through a series of transformations."
[4] "The first step involves the adsorption of the substrate onto the catalyst surface."
[5] "The second step is the formation of an adsorbed intermediate."
[6] "The third step is the dehydrogenation of the intermediate to form a product."
[7] "The final step is the desorption of the product from the surface."
[8] "The ongoing debate is whether the adsorption step, the dehydrogenation step, or the intermediate formation step is the rate-limiting step."
[9] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four primary stages: substrate adsorption, intermediate formation, dehydrogenation, and product desorption. The mechanism is currently the subject of ongoing scientific debate over which of these steps—adsorption, dehydrogenation, or intermediate formation—is the rate-limiting process. Despite over a century of investigation, this mechanism continues to intrigue and divide researchers in the field of catalysis science.
