[1] "The effect of zirconia deposition on alumina was studied for chromia dehydrogenation catalysts by activity measurements and by in situ DRIFTS and in situ Raman spectroscopic measurements."
[2] "The results were compared with the perfor- mance of chromia/zirconia and chromia/alumina catalysts all containing chromium below 2 atCr/nm2."
[3] "Hydrogen prereduction sup- pressed the formation of all surface species and dehydrogena- tion products for the alumina-containing catalysts, whereas the zirconia-supported one was less affected."
[4] "The performance of the bare supports was influenced by the Lewis acidity of the material."
[5] "The addition of chromia on the supports increased the dehydrogenation activity of all materials, but the chromia/ alumina catalyst was more active than the chromia/zirconia/ alumina catalysts."
[6] "The highest dehydrogenation activity was observed for the chromia/zirconia catalyst."
[7] "In contrast to the supports, the coke deposition rate for the chromia catalysts followed the activity of the catalysts."
[8] "For the dehydrogenation activity of the chromia catalysts it seems that the Lewis acidity of the support is not the only influential factor, but that the phase of the zirconia is also important."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Formation of a surface complex involving the adsorbed reactant and the catalyst metal.
3. Activation of the complex, often involving a change in oxidation state of the metal.
4. Release of the product molecule from the surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the mechanisms involved in dehydrogenation reactions. While some studies suggest that the adsorption step is the rate-limiting step, others indicate that the activation step might be more critical. The phase of the zirconia support plays a significant role in the dehydrogenation activity and coke deposition rate of the catalysts. The addition of chromium on the supports enhances the dehydrogenation activity, but the chromia/alumina catalyst is more active than the chromia/zirconia/alumina catalysts. The phase of zirconia seems to be a crucial factor affecting the performance of the catalysts. The Lewis acidity of the support influences the cracking activity and the coke deposition rate of the bare supports. The study highlights the importance of considering both the support material and the phase of zirconia in understanding the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the exact sequence of steps and the relative importance of each step can vary depending on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. The phase of zirconia and the Lewis acidity of the support significantly affect the dehydrogenation activity and the coke deposition rate, making the mechanism a complex interplay of factors that researchers continue to explore and refine.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附。
2. 形成表面复合物，涉及吸附的反应物和催化剂金属。
3. 复合物的活化，通常涉及金属氧化态的变化。
4. 产物从表面释放。

关于哪个步骤是决定性步骤的争论，主要是由于脱氢反应机制的复杂性。一些研究表明吸附步骤是决定性的，而其他研究则表明激活步骤可能更重要。氧化锆基质的相态对催化剂的脱氢活性和焦炭沉积速率具有重要影响。在支持上添加铬可以增强脱氢活性，但氧化铝支持的催化剂比氧化锆/氧化铝支持的催化剂更活跃。氧化锆的相态似乎对催化剂性能至关重要。支持材料的Lewis酸度影响裸催化剂的裂解活性和焦炭沉积速率。研究强调了考虑支持材料和氧化锆相态在理解脱氢反应机制中的重要性。

尽管经过近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，因为每个步骤的确切顺序以及各步骤的重要性可以根据特定的催化剂和反应条件而变化。氧化锆的相态和支持的Lewis酸度显著影响脱氢活性和焦炭沉积速率，使得机制是一个复杂的因素交互，研究人员继续探索和完善这一机制。

The dehydrogenation reaction on chromia/alumina and chromia/zirconia are catalyzed by the Cr3+ species available to the alkane molecules [1,3,6,7,9].

On alumina the high oxidation state species reduce in the presence of alkanes, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide to produce Cr3+ and possibly some Cr2+ [1,6,7]. 

According to De Rossi et al. [9] on zirconia the Cr6+ and Cr5+ species reduce under carbon monoxide to Cr2+ and Cr3+ species, respectively.

The catalytically active species in the dehydrogenation reaction on chromia/alumina and chromia/zirconia are the Cr3+ species available to the alkane molecules [1,3,6,7,9].

Answer: 
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Formation of a reactive intermediate species on the surface.
3. Activation of the molecule by the catalyst, often involving breaking of a bond.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms and the interplay between the steps. Some researchers argue that the rate-limiting step is the adsorption/desorption process, while others suggest that the activation step is rate-limiting. The specific conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reactant concentration, can influence which step dominates. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact sequence and relative rates of these steps remain subjects of active research and debate in the field of catalysis.

在催化脱氢反应中，Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 在表面上形成活性中间物种。
3. 通过催化剂激活分子，通常涉及键的断裂。
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的争论，是因为反应机制的复杂性和步骤之间的相互作用。一些研究人员认为速率决定步骤是吸附/脱附过程，而其他人则认为活化步骤是速率决定步骤。特定条件，如温度、压力和反应物浓度，可以影响哪些步骤占主导地位。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，这些步骤的确切顺序和相对速率仍然是催化领域中的活跃研究和辩论的主题。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation process, which involves four primary steps. It is a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the exact rate-limiting step is debated among researchers. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the mechanism continues to evolve and refine. The mechanism typically includes hydrogen migration, deprotonation, reaction, and protonation steps. Each step involves specific intermediates and transition states, which contribute to the overall reaction kinetics. The ongoing debate surrounds which of these steps is most critical for the reaction rate, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.

The mechanism remains a subject of interest due to its relevance in various industrial processes, such as the production of alkenes from alkanes, ammonia synthesis, and other petrochemical transformations. Understanding the mechanism helps in designing more efficient catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions. The controversy around the rate-limiting step adds complexity to the field, driving further research into kinetic studies and theoretical modeling.

In the context of the provided literature, the study focuses on the role of support materials in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. It examines how the properties of zirconia, alumina, and their combinations affect the catalytic activity and coke formation. The investigation uses activity measurements and spectroscopic techniques to understand the surface chemistry changes during the reaction. The findings suggest that the Lewis acidity of the support material alone is not sufficient to determine the catalytic activity, and the phase of zirconia plays a crucial role.

The study contributes to the understanding of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism by providing insights into how the choice of support affects the dehydrogenation process. This knowledge can inform the development of more effective catalysts for industrial applications, enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of chemical manufacturing processes.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation process in four main steps. The first step involves the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface. The second step is the activation of the molecule, often involving the breaking of a bond and the formation of an activated intermediate. The third step is the dehydrogenation reaction itself, where hydrogen is removed from the molecule, leading to the formation of a product. The final step is the desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying which of these steps is rate-limiting, impacting the overall efficiency of the reaction. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because understanding the precise kinetics and mechanisms involved can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts and processes. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing industrial processes, reducing energy consumption, and minimizing environmental impact.
