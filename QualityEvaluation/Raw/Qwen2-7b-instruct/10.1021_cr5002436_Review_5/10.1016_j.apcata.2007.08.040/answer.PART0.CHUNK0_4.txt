[1] "The effect of zirconia deposition on alumina was studied for chromia dehydrogenation catalysts by activity measurements and by in situ DRIFTS and in situ Raman spectroscopic measurements."
[2] "The results were compared with the perfor- mance of chromia/zirconia and chromia/alumina catalysts all containing chromium below 2 atCr/nm2."
[3] "The in situ DRIFTS measurements revealed the formation of spectator species (acetone, formates, and carboxylate-type species) and coke (aliphatic and unsaturated/aromatic hydrocarbon species) from isobutane."
[4] "By in situ Raman measurements the formation of pregraphitic deposits was observed for zirconia- and zirconia/alumina-supported catalysts."
[5] "Hydrogen prereduction suppressed the formation of all surface species and dehydrogenation products for the alumina-containing catalysts, whereas the zirconia-supported one was less affected."
[6] "The performance of the bare supports was influenced by the Lewis acidity of the material. The zirconia deposition decreased the Lewis acidity of alumina decreasing the rate of coke deposition for zirconia/alumina compared with alumina."
[7] "The addition of chromia on the supports increased the dehydrogenation activity of all materials, but the chromia/alumina catalyst was more active than the chromia/zirconia/alumina catalysts."
[8] "The highest dehydrogenation activity was observed for the chromia/zirconia catalyst. In contrast to the supports, the coke deposition rate for the chromia catalysts followed the activity of the catalysts."
[9] "For the dehydrogenation activity of the chromia catalysts it seems that the Lewis acidity of the support is not the only influential factor, but that the phase of the zirconia is also important."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation process in four main steps. The first step involves the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface. The second step is the activation of the molecule, often involving the breaking of a bond and the formation of an activated intermediate. The third step is the dehydrogenation reaction itself, where hydrogen is removed from the molecule, leading to the formation of a product. The final step is the desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying which of these steps is rate-limiting, impacting the overall efficiency of the reaction. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because understanding the precise kinetics and mechanisms involved can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts and processes. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing industrial processes, reducing energy consumption, and minimizing environmental impact.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述了催化脱氢过程的四个主要步骤。第一步是反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附。第二步是分子的活化，通常涉及键的断裂和活性中间体的形成。第三步是脱氢反应本身，从分子中移除氢，导致产物的形成。最后一步是从催化剂表面脱附产物。科学界围绕这些步骤中哪个是速率限制性步骤的争论持续存在，影响着反应的整体效率。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这一机制仍然是科学界的热点问题和争议话题，因为理解精确的热力学和机制可以引导我们开发更高效的催化剂和过程。这种知识对于优化工业过程、减少能耗并减少环境影响至关重要。
