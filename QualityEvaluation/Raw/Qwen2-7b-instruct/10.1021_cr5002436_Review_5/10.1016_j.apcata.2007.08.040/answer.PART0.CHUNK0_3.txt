<quotes>
The addition of chromium on the supports increased the dehydrogenation activity of all materials, but the chromia/alumina catalyst was more active than the chromia/zirconia/alumina catalysts. The highest dehydrogenation activity was observed for the chromia/zirconia catalyst.
</quotes>

Answer: Adding chromium to the supports increased the dehydrogenation activity across all materials. Among them, the chromia/alumina catalyst exhibited higher activity compared to the chromia/zirconia/alumina catalysts. The most active catalyst was the chromia/zirconia type.

The in situ DRIFTS measurements revealed the formation of spectator species (acetone, formates, and carboxylate-type species) and coke (aliphatic and unsaturated/aromatic hydrocarbon species) from isobutane.
</quotes>

Answer: In situ DRIFTS measurements uncovered the creation of spectator species including acetone, formates, and carboxylate-type species, along with coke composed of aliphatic and unsaturated/aromatic hydrocarbon species, derived from isobutane.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
原位DRIFTS测量揭示了异丁烷生成的陪衬物种（如丙酮、碳酸盐和羧酸类物种）以及由异丁烷产生的焦炭（含脂肪族和不饱和/芳香族烃类）。

The results suggested that the Lewis acidity alone is not important for the activity of the chromia-containing catalysts, but the phase of zirconia might have an influence.
</quotes>

Answer: The findings indicated that the Lewis acidity alone doesn't determine the activity of chromia-containing catalysts; instead, the phase of zirconia appears to play a role.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
结果表明，仅Lewis酸性并不能决定含铬氧化物催化剂的活性；相反，锆石的相态似乎起到作用。
