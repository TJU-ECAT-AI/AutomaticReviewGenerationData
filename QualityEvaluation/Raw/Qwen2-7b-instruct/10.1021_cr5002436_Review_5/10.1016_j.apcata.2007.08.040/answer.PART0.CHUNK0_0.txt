[1] "The effect of zirconia deposition on alumina was studied for chromia dehydrogenation catalysts by activity measurements and by in situ DRIFTS and in situ Raman spectroscopic measurements."
[2] "The results were compared with the perfor- mance of chromia/zirconia and chromia/alumina catalysts all containing chromium below 2 atCr/nm2."
[3] "Hydrogen prereduction sup- pressed the formation of all surface species and dehydrogena- tion products for the alumina-containing catalysts, whereas the zirconia-supported one was less affected."
[4] "The performance of the bare supports was influenced by the Lewis acidity of the material."
[5] "The addition of chromia on the supports increased the dehydrogenation activity of all materials, but the chromia/ alumina catalyst was more active than the chromia/zirconia/ alumina catalysts."
[6] "The highest dehydrogenation activity was observed for the chromia/zirconia catalyst."
[7] "In contrast to the supports, the coke deposition rate for the chromia catalysts followed the activity of the catalysts."
[8] "For the dehydrogenation activity of the chromia catalysts it seems that the Lewis acidity of the support is not the only influential factor, but that the phase of the zirconia is also important."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Formation of a surface complex involving the adsorbed reactant and the catalyst metal.
3. Activation of the complex, often involving a change in oxidation state of the metal.
4. Release of the product molecule from the surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the mechanisms involved in dehydrogenation reactions. While some studies suggest that the adsorption step is the rate-limiting step, others indicate that the activation step might be more critical. The phase of the zirconia support plays a significant role in the dehydrogenation activity and coke deposition rate of the catalysts. The addition of chromium on the supports enhances the dehydrogenation activity, but the chromia/alumina catalyst is more active than the chromia/zirconia/alumina catalysts. The phase of zirconia seems to be a crucial factor affecting the performance of the catalysts. The Lewis acidity of the support influences the cracking activity and the coke deposition rate of the bare supports. The study highlights the importance of considering both the support material and the phase of zirconia in understanding the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the exact sequence of steps and the relative importance of each step can vary depending on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. The phase of zirconia and the Lewis acidity of the support significantly affect the dehydrogenation activity and the coke deposition rate, making the mechanism a complex interplay of factors that researchers continue to explore and refine.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附。
2. 形成表面复合物，涉及吸附的反应物和催化剂金属。
3. 复合物的活化，通常涉及金属氧化态的变化。
4. 产物从表面释放。

关于哪个步骤是决定性步骤的争论，主要是由于脱氢反应机制的复杂性。一些研究表明吸附步骤是决定性的，而其他研究则表明激活步骤可能更重要。氧化锆基质的相态对催化剂的脱氢活性和焦炭沉积速率具有重要影响。在支持上添加铬可以增强脱氢活性，但氧化铝支持的催化剂比氧化锆/氧化铝支持的催化剂更活跃。氧化锆的相态似乎对催化剂性能至关重要。支持材料的Lewis酸度影响裸催化剂的裂解活性和焦炭沉积速率。研究强调了考虑支持材料和氧化锆相态在理解脱氢反应机制中的重要性。

尽管经过近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，因为每个步骤的确切顺序以及各步骤的重要性可以根据特定的催化剂和反应条件而变化。氧化锆的相态和支持的Lewis酸度显著影响脱氢活性和焦炭沉积速率，使得机制是一个复杂的因素交互，研究人员继续探索和完善这一机制。
