[1] "In this work, we present a novel experimental set-up, which combines two operando time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, namely UV-VIS and Raman, directly coupled to a regular fixed-bed catalytic reactor via optical fiber technology."
[2] "Fast product analysis is performed by on-line mass spectrometry."
[3] "It is clear that no major peak intensity changes can be observed. On the other hand, the overall absorbance of the sample increases and this is related to the formation of coke."
[4] "Both the UV-VIS and Raman spectra at the end of the regenerative cycle are identical to those at the beginning of the dehydrogenation cycle."
[5] "Since in industrial processes the alkane dehydrogenation is often carried out with some excess catalyst to obtain the equilibrium conversion of the reaction, this loss in catalyst activity cannot be determined immediately from the conversion of the reactor."

The document discusses a novel experimental setup for characterizing supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions. This setup combines UV-VIS and Raman spectroscopy with online mass spectrometry. It is used to study the propane dehydrogenation over a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst. The study demonstrates that these spectroscopic techniques provide valuable information on the catalyst's performance during successive operating cycles. The setup allows for the identification of active sites, reaction intermediates, and coke formation. The document also highlights the importance of using multiple time-resolved spectroscopic techniques simultaneously for more efficient operation of catalytic processes.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. This mechanism involves four main steps: cleavage of the C-H bond, formation of a carbocation intermediate, migration of the positive charge, and formation of the product molecule. The ongoing debate centers around which of these steps is rate-limiting. The mechanism remains of interest because it helps explain the kinetics and thermodynamics of dehydrogenation reactions, guiding the design of more efficient catalysts and processes.

该文档讨论了一种用于在工作条件下表征支持的金属氧化物催化剂的新型实验设置。此设置结合了紫外-可见光谱和拉曼光谱与在线质谱，用于研究丙烷脱氢过铬氧化铝催化剂。研究表明，这些光谱技术提供了有关催化剂性能在连续运行周期中的信息。此设置允许识别活性位点、反应中间体和焦炭形成。文档还强调了同时使用多种时间分辨光谱技术对于更高效操作催化过程的重要性。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机制仍然是科学界的兴趣和争议话题。该机制涉及四个主要步骤：C-H键断裂、形成碳正离子中间体、正电荷迁移以及产物分子的形成。争论的焦点在于哪个步骤是速率限制性。该机制之所以引人关注，是因为它有助于解释脱氢反应的动力学和热力学，指导设计更高效的催化剂和工艺。
