[1] "The aim of this study is to demonstrate the advantage of the multi-technique approach in catalytic testing and analysis. It will be shown that the information collected has good potential to be used as a tool to more efficiently operate a propane dehydrogenation process."
[2] "Probing events taking place on a supported metal oxide catalyst under reaction conditions has attracted considerable attention in recent years.13 It requires the development of time-resolved characterization techniques and the construction of in-situ spectroscopic-reaction cells, which allow the identification of active sites, reaction intermediates and/or coke formation."
[3] "In this work, we present a novel experimental set-up, which combines two operando time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, namely UV-VIS and Raman, directly coupled to a regular fixed-bed catalytic reactor via optical fiber technology."
[4] "UV-VIS together with Raman spectroscopy is a very useful combination of in-situ techniques. The first technique provides electronic information on the catalyst system and the latter vibrational information. Both techniques can be conveniently applied to a catalytic reactor system, since they both are non-contact measurements."
[5] "The newly developed system (Fig. 1) consists of a 6 mm diameter quartz reactor tube with a special square section in which the tube wall is made of optical grade quartz windows. Typically, 300 mg of catalyst is placed in the reactor as a packed bed supported on a sintered glass grid just below the optical windows."
[6] "The catalyst performance does not change from one cycle to the next one, but changes significantly within one dehydrogenation cycle."
[7] "Coke formation, as observed by both Raman and UV-VIS, is the most likely cause of the decrease in catalyst activity over time."
[8] "The capability of operando UV-VIS measurements to determine long-term deactivation was verified by performing a propane dehydrogenation experiment in which the catalyst was purposefully deactivated."
[9] "Since in industrial processes the alkane dehydrogenation is often carried out with some excess catalyst to obtain the equilibrium conversion of the reaction, this loss in catalyst activity cannot be determined immediately from the conversion of the reactor."

This study aims to showcase the benefits of using multiple analytical techniques in catalytic testing and analysis, particularly for optimizing propane dehydrogenation processes. It highlights the importance of developing time-resolved characterization methods and in-situ spectroscopic cells for identifying active sites, reaction intermediates, and coke formation. The experimental setup combines UV-VIS and Raman spectroscopy, enabling non-contact measurements that can provide comprehensive insights into catalyst behavior under reaction conditions. The system includes a quartz reactor tube with optical windows, where the catalyst is placed as a packed bed. The study demonstrates that the catalyst performance varies significantly within a single dehydrogenation cycle, indicating the importance of monitoring catalyst activity over time. Coke formation, detected through both Raman and UV-VIS spectroscopy, is identified as a key factor affecting catalyst activity. The study also verifies the ability of operando UV-VIS measurements to assess long-term catalyst deactivation, which is crucial for maintaining optimal dehydrogenation efficiency in industrial settings. Despite the challenges of determining catalyst activity loss from reactor conversion alone, especially when using excess catalyst, the findings suggest that operando UV-VIS measurements offer valuable tools for managing the deactivation process and enhancing process control.
