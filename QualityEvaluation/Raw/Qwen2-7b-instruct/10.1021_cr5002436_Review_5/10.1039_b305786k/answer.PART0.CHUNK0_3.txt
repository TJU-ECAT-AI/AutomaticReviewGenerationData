[1] "The aim of this study is to demonstrate the advantage of the multi-technique approach in catalytic testing and analysis. It will be shown that the information collected has good potential to be used as a tool to more efficiently operate a propane dehydrogenation process."
[2] "This study provides operando spectroscopic information on the short- and long-term deactivation process of the catalyst."
[3] "The capability of operando UV-VIS measurements to determine long-term deactivation was verified by performing a propane dehydrogenation experiment in which the catalyst was purposefully deactivated."
[4] "Conclusions A novel operando spectroscopic reactor system has been developed. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the value of combining fast time-resolved operando spectroscopic measurements using UV-VIS and Raman with quantitative fast product analysis using mass spectrometry."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely discussed theory in the field of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It proposes that the process involves four main steps: (1) Adsorption of the reactant onto the catalyst surface, (2) Activation of the reactant through a series of electron transfer reactions, (3) Formation of the product, and (4) Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate among scientists revolves around identifying which of these steps is the rate-limiting step in the mechanism. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the precise details of each step and their relative rates of occurrence are still being debated. The importance of understanding this mechanism lies in its potential to guide the design of more efficient catalysts and improve the overall efficiency of dehydrogenation processes.

霍里图-波兰尼机制是催化脱氢反应领域广泛讨论的理论。它提出过程涉及四个主要步骤：（1）将反应物吸附到催化剂表面，（2）通过一系列电子转移反应激活反应物，（3）形成产物，（4）产物从催化剂表面脱附。科学家们围绕确定这些步骤中的哪个是速率限制步骤进行争论。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这一机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为每个步骤的确切细节及其发生速率仍然在辩论中。理解这一机制的重要性在于指导设计更高效的催化剂并提高脱氢过程的整体效率。
