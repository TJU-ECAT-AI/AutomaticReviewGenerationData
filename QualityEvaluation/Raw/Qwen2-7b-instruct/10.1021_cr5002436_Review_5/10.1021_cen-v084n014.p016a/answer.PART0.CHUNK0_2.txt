[1] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[2] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[3] "The procedure was inspired by the rules of promotion and relegation (downgrading) that are used to rank teams in European soccer leagues, such as La Liga in Spain."
[4] "Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs."
[5] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."
[6] "Billinge explains that the procedure was inspired by the rules of promotion and relegation that are used to rank teams in European soccer leagues, such as La Liga in Spain."

The document describes a new computational method developed for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles and other materials without long-range order. This method utilizes atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) data obtained from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of noncrystalline samples. Inspired by the promotion and relegation system in soccer, the algorithm positions a small number of atoms in a cluster, compares the derived distance list with experimental data, and ranks theoretical clusters according to their closeness to the experimental results. This method was successfully applied to deduce the structure of C60 buckyballs using neutron-scattering data. Despite noise in the data and experimental limitations, the calculated structure matched the experimental results closely but showed slight deviations from the ideal structure of C60.

该文档描述了一种用于确定无序材料（如纳米颗粒和其他缺乏长程有序的材料）原子结构的新计算方法。这种方法利用了来自非晶样品X射线和中子衍射研究的原子对分布函数（PDFs）数据。受欧洲足球联赛（如西班牙西甲联赛）升降级规则的启发，算法将一小部分原子定位在一个簇中，比较生成的距离列表与实验数据，并根据与实验结果的接近程度对理论簇进行排名。该方法成功应用于使用单质球状碳60的中子散射数据推导其结构。尽管存在数据噪声和实验限制，计算结构与实验结果的匹配度很高，但与理想的C60结构略有偏差。
