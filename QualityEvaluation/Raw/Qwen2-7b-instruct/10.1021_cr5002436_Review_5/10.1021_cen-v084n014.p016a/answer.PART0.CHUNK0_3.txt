[3] "To build up structures, the algorithm 'positions' a small number of atoms in a cluster and then compares the distance list derived from the computer-generated cluster with an experimentally measured list."
[4] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."

Numerical methods have been developed to determine the atomic structures of aperiodic materials, utilizing data from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples. These methods rely on atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), which consist of interatomic spacing lists and histograms indicating the frequency of specific spacing pairs. An algorithm positions atoms within a cluster, comparing the distances in the generated cluster with experimental data. Despite slight deviations from the ideal structure of C60, the calculated data closely matches the experimental results, attributed to noise and experimental limitations.

已经开发出了数值方法来确定无序材料的原子结构，利用粉末和其他非晶样品的X射线和中子衍射研究数据。这些方法依赖于原子对分布函数（PDFs），包含原子间距离列表和表示特定间距对频率的直方图。算法在簇中定位原子，并将生成簇的距离与实验数据进行比较。尽管与C60的理想结构略有偏差，但计算数据与实验结果非常接近，这归因于噪声和实验限制。
