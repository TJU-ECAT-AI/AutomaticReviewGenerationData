[1] "A new computational method, though, is poised to help with the problem. Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[2] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[3] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."

Numerical methods are being developed to determine the atomic structures of aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles, by using atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. These functions provide lists of interatomic spacings and the frequency of atom pairs sharing specific spacings. The method has been successfully applied to deduce the structure of C60 buckyballs, matching experimental data closely but showing slight deviations due to measurement noise and limitations.

已经开发出数值方法来确定无序材料的原子结构，如纳米颗粒，通过从X射线和中子衍射研究粉末和其他非晶态样品得到的原子对分布函数（PDF）。这些函数提供了一系列的原子间距离列表和表示共享特定距离的原子对数量的直方图。该方法已被成功应用于推导出C60巴基球的结构，与实验数据高度吻合，但显示轻微偏差，这是由于测量噪声和实验限制导致的。
