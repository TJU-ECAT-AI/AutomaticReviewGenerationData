The numerical method described in the literature involves utilizing atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of noncrystalline materials. These functions consist of interatomic spacing lists and histograms indicating the frequency of specific spacings. The method employs an algorithm that iteratively compares computer-generated clusters with experimental PDF data, promoting the cluster that most closely matches the experimental data to the next level. This technique was successfully applied to deduce the structure of C60 buckyballs, demonstrating its potential for solving the structures of aperiodic materials with high resolution. The approach holds promise for broader applicability in the field of materials science.

Numerical methods are being developed to solve the atomic structures of materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles. These methods utilize atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) obtained from X-ray and neutron diffraction studies. By comparing the distance lists from computer-generated clusters with experimental data, algorithms can iteratively position atoms to build up structures. This process, inspired by soccer league ranking systems, aims to accurately determine the structures of aperiodic materials, potentially achieving subangstrom resolution even when traditional crystallographic methods fail.

The document describes a new computational method developed for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles and other materials without long-range order. This method utilizes atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) data obtained from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of noncrystalline samples. Inspired by the promotion and relegation system in soccer, the algorithm positions a small number of atoms in a cluster, compares the derived distance list with experimental data, and ranks theoretical clusters according to their closeness to the experimental results. This method was successfully applied to deduce the structure of C60 buckyballs using neutron-scattering data. Despite noise in the data and experimental limitations, the calculated structure matched the experimental results closely but showed slight deviations from the ideal structure of C60.
