The numerical method described in the literature involves utilizing atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of noncrystalline materials. These functions consist of interatomic spacing lists and histograms indicating the frequency of specific spacings. The method employs an algorithm that iteratively compares computer-generated clusters with experimental PDF data, promoting the cluster that most closely matches the experimental data to the next level. This technique was successfully applied to deduce the structure of C60 buckyballs, demonstrating its potential for solving the structures of aperiodic materials with high resolution. The approach holds promise for broader applicability in the field of materials science.
