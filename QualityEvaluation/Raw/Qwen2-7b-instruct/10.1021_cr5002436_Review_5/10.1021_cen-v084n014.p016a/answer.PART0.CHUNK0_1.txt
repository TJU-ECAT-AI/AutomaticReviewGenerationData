[1] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[2] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[3] "To build up structures, the algorithm 'positions' a small number of atoms in a cluster and then compares the distance list derived from the computer-generated cluster with an experimentally measured list."
[4] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."
[5] "Billinge explains that the procedure was inspired by the rules of promotion and relegation (downgrading) that are used to rank teams in European soccer leagues, such as La Liga in Spain. Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60."
[6] "The new approach to solving these materials' structures could be widely applicable."

Numerical methods are being developed to solve the atomic structures of materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles. These methods utilize atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) obtained from X-ray and neutron diffraction studies. By comparing the distance lists from computer-generated clusters with experimental data, algorithms can iteratively position atoms to build up structures. This process, inspired by soccer league ranking systems, aims to accurately determine the structures of aperiodic materials, potentially achieving subangstrom resolution even when traditional crystallographic methods fail.

为了解决缺乏长程有序的材料（如纳米颗粒）的原子结构，正在开发数值方法。这些方法利用自X射线和中子衍射研究获得的原子对分布函数（PDF）。通过将计算机生成簇的距离列表与实验数据进行比较，算法可以逐级定位原子来构建结构。这一过程受到欧洲足球联赛排名规则的启发，旨在准确确定无序材料的结构，甚至在传统晶体学方法失败时也能实现亚埃分辨率。
