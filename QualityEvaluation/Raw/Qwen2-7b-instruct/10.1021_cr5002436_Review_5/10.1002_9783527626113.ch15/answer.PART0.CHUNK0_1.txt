[1] "A comprehensive review of the pre - 1954 literature can be found in Emmett's book on catalysis."
[2] "The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes,due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known."
[3] "Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and by oxidation."
[4] "These steps are followed by an evacuation and reduction and then another cycle is begun."
[5] "The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene of greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is > 86%."
[6] "Chromium can exist in the (II), (III), (V) and (VI) oxidation states; however, in an as - prepared catalyst the (III) and (VI) oxidation states are the predominant species."
[7] "Typically catalysts are prepared by impregnation of alumina, although zirconia is also used, from a variety of chromium - containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid and chromium nitrate."
[8] "Given the number of publications we will not review them all but will summarize the main conclusions from this body of work."
[9] "The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers."
[10] "However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site."
[11] "Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair."
[12] "In general spectroscopic analyses favor Cr(III), but quantification of the reduction and re-adsorption/absorption of oxygen suggests that hydrogen reduction reduces Cr 2 O 3 to CrO."
[13] "The presence of residual hydrogen retained by a chromia catalyst after reduction was shown by pulsing aliquots of deutero - propane (C 3 D 8 or [ 2 H]C 3 H 8 ) over a hydrogen - reduced catalyst and aliquots of propane over a deuterium - reduced ( 2 H 2 or D 2 ) catalyst."
[14] "The rate determining step for propane dehydrogenation over chromia was found to be the loss of the second hydrogen: C H ads C H ads H ads 3 7 3 6 ( ) ( ) + ( )."
[15] "For butane dehydrogenation, 1 - butene is the primary product."
[16] "Studies using isotopically labeled propane [30] have shown that the route to the coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation goes through a C 1 species, probably CH(a)."
[17] "Clearly carbonaceous material retained by the catalyst was being desorbed into the pulse as methane."
[18] "The reason lies in the strong electronic absorptions in the UV and visible wavelength regions exhibited by most transition metal oxides, which make it possible to measure resonance-enhanced Raman spectra."
[19] "By measuring the Raman spectra at several wavelengths,more information can be obtained about the various VO x species in the distribution."
[20] "Moreover, when UV excitation is employed, even Raman spectra from supported VO x at low loadings (< 1 wt%) on oxides having strong fluorescence are possible because of the avoidance of fluorescence and enhanced sensitivity."
[21] "However, several recent investigations on supported transition metal oxides [55-58], including vanadium oxides [55, 56] under ambient conditions, using both UV and visible wavelength Raman excitations suggest that more complete and sometimes new structural information of supported metal oxides can be achieved by using multiple excitation wavelengths."
[22] "Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed [63, 64] that isolated VO x species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm 2 ; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2 - 4.4 V/nm 2 ; and V 2 O 5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm 2 ."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions describes four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the alkane molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the alkane molecule by breaking one of its hydrogen bonds.
3. Formation of an intermediate compound by removing one hydrogen atom.
4. Release of the alkene product from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting revolves around the efficiency of each step and how they interact with each other. The mechanism is considered a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the precise details of the interactions between the alkane molecules, the catalyst surface, and the formation of the intermediate compound are still not fully understood. The mechanism's complexity and the dynamic nature of the reactions involved contribute to the ongoing research and debate in the field.

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for several reasons:

2. The efficiency of each step in the mechanism and how they interact with each other are subjects of ongoing debate.
3. The dynamic nature of the reactions involved contributes to the complexity and challenges in understanding the mechanism.
4. The mechanism's applicability and optimization for specific industrial processes require a deeper understanding of its underlying principles.

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to several factors:

1. The lack of complete understanding of the interactions between the alkane molecules, the catalyst surface, and the formation of the intermediate compound.
2. The need for further research to determine the efficiency of each step in the mechanism and how they interact with each other.
3. The complexity of the reactions and their dynamic nature, which presents challenges in comprehensively understanding the mechanism.
4. The requirement for improved optimization of the mechanism for specific industrial applications, necessitating a deeper insight into its underlying principles.
