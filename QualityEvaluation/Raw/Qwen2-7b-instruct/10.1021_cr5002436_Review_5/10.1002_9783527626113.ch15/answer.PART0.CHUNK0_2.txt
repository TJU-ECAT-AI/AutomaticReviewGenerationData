[1] "The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known."
[2] "Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and by oxidation."

[4] "Typically catalysts are prepared by impregnation of alumina, although zirconia is also used, from a variety of chromium-containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid and chromium nitrate."
[5] "After calcination in air at 823 K, UV visible analysis of a 6% w/w chrome oxide/ γ - alumina revealed the presence of Cr(III) with bands at 280 nm ( 4 A 2g 4 T 1g [P]), 354 nm ( 4 A 2g 4 T 1g [F]), 454 nm ( 4 A 2g 2 T 2g ), 590 nm ( 4 A 2g 4 T 2g ) and 706 nm ( 4 A 2g 2 E g ,2 T 1g )."

[9] "However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site."
[10] "The presence of residual hydrogen retained by a chromia catalyst after reduction was shown by pulsing aliquots of deutero-propane (C 3 D 8 or [ 2 H]C 3 H 8 ) over a hydrogen-reduced catalyst and aliquots of propane over a deuterium-reduced ( 2 H 2 or D 2 ) catalyst."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of the alkane molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) dissociation of the alkane molecule into alkyl and hydrogen species, (3) migration of the alkyl species to the active site, and (4) desorption of the resulting alkene molecule. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting primarily centers on the second step, the dissociation process, as it affects the overall efficiency of the reaction. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the precise details of how the alkane molecule dissociates and the factors influencing this step are still not fully understood. This uncertainty impacts the design and optimization of catalysts for dehydrogenation processes, leading to ongoing research efforts aimed at elucidating the mechanisms involved.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：（1）烷烃分子在催化剂表面的吸附，（2）烷烃分子分解为烷基和氢物种，（3）烷基物种向活性位点的迁移，（4）生成的烯烃分子的脱附。关于哪个步骤被认为是决定性的争论主要集中在第二步，即分解过程，因为它影响整个反应的效率。尽管已经研究了一个多世纪，但该机制仍是一个科学兴趣和争议的焦点，因为关于烷烃分子如何分解以及影响这一步骤的因素的具体细节仍然不清楚。这种不确定性影响了脱氢过程催化剂的设计和优化，导致正在进行的研究努力旨在阐明涉及的机制。
