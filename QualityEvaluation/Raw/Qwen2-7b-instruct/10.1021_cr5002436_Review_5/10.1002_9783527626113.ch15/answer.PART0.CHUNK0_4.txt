[18] "The situation with butane is similar but with significant differences. The formation of coke on the surface is very similar to that found with propane; however, Edussuriya and coworkers (unpublished results) found that although the majority of the catalyst deactivation was due to polynuclear aromatics or other forms of coke strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates were also detected."
[19] "This desorption process can be viewed as an oxidative displacement, resulting in recombination of reaction intermediates (hydrogen and alkyl, alkenyl and alkadienyl) from the surface of reduced CrOx species."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the alkane molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of hydrogen molecules into atomic hydrogen on the catalyst surface.
3. Reaction of the alkane molecule with the activated hydrogen to form an alkene and hydrogen gas.
4. Desorption of the alkene product from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting depends on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst properties. The fourth step, desorption, is often considered the rate-limiting step due to the strong interaction between the alkene and the catalyst surface. However, the first step, adsorption, can also be rate-limiting under certain conditions.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The precise details of how the alkane molecule interacts with the catalyst surface, the role of hydrogen activation, and the mechanisms behind the desorption step are still being investigated. The complexity of the interactions between the alkane, hydrogen, and catalyst surface makes it difficult to conclusively determine the rate-limiting step. Furthermore, advances in experimental techniques and theoretical models continue to shed light on the intricate details of the dehydrogenation process, leading to ongoing debates and discussions in the scientific community.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：
1. 烷烃分子在催化剂表面吸附。
2. 活化氢分子形成原子氢在催化剂表面。
3. 烷烃分子与激活的氢反应生成烯烃和氢气。
4. 从催化剂表面脱附烯烃产物。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性步骤的争论取决于特定的反应条件和催化剂性质。第四步，脱附，通常被认为是最慢的步骤，因为烷烃与催化剂表面之间的强相互作用。然而，在某些条件下，第一步，吸附，也可能成为速率限制性步骤。

尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。烷烃、氢和催化剂表面之间交互作用的精确细节、氢激活的作用以及脱附步骤的机制仍然在被研究。由于烷烃、氢和催化剂表面之间的复杂相互作用，确定速率限制性步骤仍然很困难。此外，实验技术的进步和理论模型的发展继续揭示脱氢过程的细节，导致科学社区中的持续辩论和讨论。
