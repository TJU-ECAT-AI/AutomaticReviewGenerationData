[1] "The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known."
[2] "Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and by oxidation."
[3] "Typically catalysts are prepared by impregnation of alumina, although zirconia is also used, from a variety of chromium-containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid and chromium nitrate."
[4] "As loading increases the surface species change from monochromate to polychromate to α-Cr2O3."
[5] "The presence of residual hydrogen retained by a chromia catalyst after reduction was shown by pulsing aliquots of deutero-propane (C3D8 or [2H]C3H8) over a hydrogen-reduced catalyst and aliquots of propane over a deuterium-reduced (2H2 or D2) catalyst."
[6] "The rate determining step for propane dehydrogenation over chromia was found to be the loss of the second hydrogen: CHadsCHadsHads3736(+) (+)(+)with an activation energy for propene formation of 727kJ mol−1."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the substrate molecule, often involving breaking of bonds.
3. Formation of an intermediate species that is involved in the reaction.
4. Release of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact nature of the intermediates and the precise sequence of steps in the mechanism are still not fully understood. The mechanism's complexity arises from the fact that dehydrogenation reactions involve multiple pathways, and the specific pathway depends on factors such as the catalyst composition, temperature, and substrate concentration.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of interest because it provides insights into the fundamental chemistry of dehydrogenation reactions. Understanding this mechanism can lead to improvements in the design of catalysts and reaction conditions for various industrial applications, such as the production of alkenes from alkanes. Additionally, the mechanism helps researchers understand the role of catalysts in promoting reactions and how to optimize their performance for better efficiency and selectivity.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：

1. 将底物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 激活底物分子，通常涉及断裂化学键。
3. 形成参与反应的中间物种。
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面释放。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论仍然是科学研究的一个热点。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但中间体的确切性质和反应步骤的精确顺序仍然不完全清楚。机制的复杂性源于脱氢反应涉及多个途径，特定途径取决于催化剂组成、温度和底物浓度等因素。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是一个研究热点，因为它为理解脱氢反应的基本化学提供了见解。了解这个机制可以导致催化剂设计和反应条件的改进，应用于各种工业应用，如从烷烃生产烯烃。此外，该机制帮助研究人员理解催化剂在促进反应中的作用，并如何优化其性能以提高效率和选择性。
