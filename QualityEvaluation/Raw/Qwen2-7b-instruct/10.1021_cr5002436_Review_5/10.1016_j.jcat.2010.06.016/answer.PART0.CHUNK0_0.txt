<p>Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.</p>
<p>The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane.</p>

1. The study found that most of the coke formed during the dehydrogenation of both ethane and propane resides on the support rather than on the Pt particles. The amount of coke deposited exceeds the amount of exposed Pt, suggesting that coke forms predominantly on the support.

2. The deactivation of catalysts was observed to be more pronounced during the dehydrogenation of propane compared to ethane. This is attributed to a greater coverage of the Pt particles by coke precursors derived from propane than from ethane.

1. 研究发现，生成的焦炭大部分位于支撑体上，而不是位于铂颗粒上。沉积的焦炭量超过暴露的铂量，表明焦炭主要在支撑体上形成。

2. 观察到催化剂的失活程度在丙烷脱氢过程中比在乙烷脱氢过程中更为明显。这归因于从丙烷产生的焦炭前驱体在铂粒子上的覆盖面积大于来自乙烷的焦炭前驱体。
