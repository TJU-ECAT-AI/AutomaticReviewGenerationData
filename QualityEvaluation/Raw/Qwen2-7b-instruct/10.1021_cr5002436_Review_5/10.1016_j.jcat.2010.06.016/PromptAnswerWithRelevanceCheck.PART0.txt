<p>Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.</p>
<p>The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane.</p>

1. The study found that most of the coke formed during the dehydrogenation of both ethane and propane resides on the support rather than on the Pt particles. The amount of coke deposited exceeds the amount of exposed Pt, suggesting that coke forms predominantly on the support.

2. The deactivation of catalysts was observed to be more pronounced during the dehydrogenation of propane compared to ethane. This is attributed to a greater coverage of the Pt particles by coke precursors derived from propane than from ethane.

1. 研究发现，生成的焦炭大部分位于支撑体上，而不是位于铂颗粒上。沉积的焦炭量超过暴露的铂量，表明焦炭主要在支撑体上形成。

2. 观察到催化剂的失活程度在丙烷脱氢过程中比在乙烷脱氢过程中更为明显。这归因于从丙烷产生的焦炭前驱体在铂粒子上的覆盖面积大于来自乙烷的焦炭前驱体。

<p>The dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a Pt catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support was investigated. Catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support,a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4, and selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4.</p>
<p>Adding H2 to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane.</p>
<p>Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydroge- nation. Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%.</p>
<p>The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane.</p>
<p>Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.</p>
<p>The effects of H2/C3H8 ratio on the rate of propene formation and the propene selectivity. The addition of H2 to the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25.</p>
<p>The ratio of hydrogen to ethane partial pressure in the feed was varied from 0 to 2.5, while maintaining the total flow constant by appropriate addition of He.</p>

The investigation focused on using a Pt catalyst supported on a Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide to dehydrogenate ethane and propane. The performance of the catalyst depends on the Ga content in the support, with peaks in activity occurring at specific Ga/Pt ratios for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The selectivity increases monotonically with Ga/Pt, reaching almost 100% at a certain ratio. Adding H2 to the feed enhances the dehydrogenation rate, attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon the dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. Beyond a certain H2 addition, the increase in H2 concentration promotes alkene hydrogenation, reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation. However, hydrogen addition has little impact on alkene selectivity, which remains close to 100%. The presence of Ga suppresses coke formation, with less coke being formed during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane. The higher deactivation rate during propane dehydrogenation is due to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors from propane. Most of the deposited coke is found on the support, with only a small amount on the Pt particles. The addition of H2 to the feed increases the rate of propene formation up to a specific ratio. The H2/C3H8 ratio was varied within a range of 0 to 2.5 while maintaining a constant total flow by adjusting He accordingly.

研究重点是使用Pt催化剂支持在Mg(Ga)(Al)O混合氧化物上进行乙烷和丙烷的脱氢。催化剂性能依赖于支持物中的Ga含量，在特定的Ga/Pt比下，对于乙烷和丙烷脱氢出现峰值活性。随着Ga/Pt的增加，选择性呈单调增加趋势，达到接近100%的比率。向流体中添加H2可以增强脱氢速率，归因于H-原子辅助脱氢作用于形成的烷基物种，该物种是通过反应烷烃的离散吸附形成的。超过一定H2添加量后，H2浓度的进一步增加促进烯烃氢化，从而降低净脱氢速率。然而，向流体添加H2对烯烃选择性影响较小，其保持接近100%的水平。Ga的存在抑制焦炭形成，丙烷脱氢产生的焦炭少于乙烷。丙烷脱氢过程中较高的催化剂失活率是由于从丙烷产生的焦炭前体覆盖Pt表面的比例较高。大多数沉积的焦炭位于支撑物上，只有少量位于Pt颗粒上。向流体中添加H2会增加丙烯生成速率，直到特定比例。H2/C3H8比例在0到2.5之间变化，同时通过调整He维持恒定总流量。

Coke formation during alkane dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts supported on Mg(Ga)(Al)O is influenced by several factors. The amount of coke deposited exceeds the amount of exposed Pt, indicating that most coke resides on the support rather than on the Pt particles. There is less coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation, and no direct correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Adding Ga to the catalyst support helps suppress coke formation. The reason for the higher deactivation during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than from ethane.

在使用Mg(Ga)(Al)O支持的Pt催化剂进行烷烃脱氢时，焦炭形成受到几个因素的影响。沉积的焦炭量超过暴露的Pt量，表明大部分焦炭位于支撑体上，而不是位于Pt颗粒上。与乙烷脱氢相比，丙烷脱氢产生的焦炭较少，并且没有发现焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间的直接关联。添加Ga到催化剂支撑中有助于抑制焦炭形成。丙烷脱氢过程中Pt表面覆盖更多焦炭前体的原因是丙烷产生的焦炭前体比乙烷多，这是导致丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂失活程度更高的原因。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. These steps are:

1. Adsorption of the alkane molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Dissociation of the alkane molecule, breaking the C-H bonds.
3. Formation of an alkyl radical and hydrogen on the catalyst surface.
4. Migration of the alkyl radical to the surface of the catalyst where it combines with another alkyl radical to form an alkene molecule.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting centers around the dissociation of the alkane molecule and the formation of an alkyl radical. Some researchers argue that the rate-limiting step is the adsorption of the alkane molecule onto the catalyst surface, while others believe it is the dissociation of the alkane molecule.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the precise rate-determining step is still debated. The mechanism is complex, involving multiple steps, and understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of each step is challenging. This complexity makes it difficult to definitively identify the rate-limiting step. Moreover, experimental conditions and the specific catalyst used can influence the mechanism, leading to variations in the results and interpretations.

The coke formation during dehydrogenation reactions is also a topic of interest. The literature indicates that the type of alkane (ethane vs. propane) affects the coke formation, with propane dehydrogenation leading to less coke formation than ethane dehydrogenation. This is attributed to the ease of hydrogenation of propylene compared to ethylene, affecting the distribution of coke species on the active metal particles. The study of coke formation helps in understanding the deactivation mechanisms and improving catalyst design for more efficient dehydrogenation processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制是催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤：

1. 将烷烃分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 破裂烷烃分子中的C-H键。
3. 在催化剂表面上形成烷基自由基和氢原子。
4. 将烷基自由基迁移到催化剂表面，与另一个烷基自由基结合形成烯烃分子。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性步骤的争论集中在烷烃分子的分解和烷基自由基的形成。一些研究人员认为，速率限制性步骤是烷烃分子在催化剂表面的吸附，而其他人则认为是烷烃分子的分解。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为确定速率限制性步骤的具体步骤仍然存在争议。该机制非常复杂，涉及多个步骤，理解每个步骤的热力学和机制具有挑战性。这种复杂性使得明确识别速率限制性步骤变得困难。此外，实验条件和所使用的具体催化剂可以影响机制，导致结果和解释的变化。

研究焦炭形成也是感兴趣的话题。文献表明，不同类型的烷烃（乙烷与丙烷）对焦炭形成的影响不同，丙烷脱氢产生的焦炭比乙烷少。这归因于丙烯相对于乙烯的氢化更容易，影响活性金属颗粒上焦炭物种的分布。研究焦炭形成有助于理解失活机制并改进脱氢过程的催化剂设计。

The literature discusses the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts are influenced by the bulk Ga/Pt ratio, with a peak activity occurring around Ga/Pt = 1.45.4 for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species. However, beyond a certain hydrogen concentration, alkene hydrogenation occurs, reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation. The presence of Ga suppresses coke formation, and the extent of deactivation is lower for propane than for ethane dehydrogenation. The amount of coke deposited is higher in ethane dehydrogenation than in propane dehydrogenation, but the deactivation is greater in propane dehydrogenation. The literature also discusses the formation of PtGa alloys upon reduction of the catalyst at 873 K, which is attributed to the dilution of Pt ensembles by Ga, enhancing alkane adsorption and inhibiting alkene adsorption. The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The literature does not explicitly state why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

文献讨论了使用Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂对乙烷和丙烷进行催化脱氢。催化剂的活性和选择性受到Ga/Pt比率的影响，在Ga/Pt约为1.45.4时，乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活性达到峰值。向原料中添加氢气可以提高烯烃形成速率，由于氢辅助脱氢作用于表面烷基物种。然而，在氢浓度超过一定值后，烯烃氢化作用开始发生，降低净脱氢速率。镓的存在可以抑制焦炭形成，并且在丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂失活程度低于乙烷脱氢。焦炭沉积量在乙烷脱氢中高于丙烷脱氢，但丙烷脱氢过程中的催化剂失活程度更高。文献还讨论了在873 K下还原催化剂时形成的PtGa合金，这归因于Ga对Pt簇的稀释作用，增强烷烃吸附并抑制烯烃吸附。文献没有提供关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制的详细解释，也没有分析持续辩论中认为哪个步骤是决定性的。文献也没有明确说明为什么这个机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的主题，尽管已经研究了一个世纪。
