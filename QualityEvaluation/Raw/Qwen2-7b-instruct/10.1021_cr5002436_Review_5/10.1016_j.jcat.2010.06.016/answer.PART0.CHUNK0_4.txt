<p>Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.</p>
<p>The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane.</p>
<p>What is not known, however, is the Ga/Pt ratio at the surface of the bimetallic particles and, hence, it is not possible to relate the effects of surface Ga/Pt ratio to catalyst activity and selectivity.</p>
<p>Studies on Pt(1 1 1) and Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces have shown that the energies of adsorption for ethene and propene on Pt(1 1 1) differ negligibly.</p>
<p>In the present work, it was found that the loss in activity for ethane dehydrogenation after 2 h on stream was minimal (3%) in the case of Pt, PtSn, and PtGa supported on Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Ga)(A- l)O but much more significant in the case of propane dehydrogena- tion (2545%).</p>
<p>While the final loss in activity for propane dehy- drogenation after three cycles was 14.8%, the loss in initial activity after each cycle was minimal (Fig. 11).</p>

The literature discusses the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts are influenced by the bulk Ga/Pt ratio, with a peak activity occurring around Ga/Pt = 1.45.4 for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species. However, beyond a certain hydrogen concentration, alkene hydrogenation occurs, reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation. The presence of Ga suppresses coke formation, and the extent of deactivation is lower for propane than for ethane dehydrogenation. The amount of coke deposited is higher in ethane dehydrogenation than in propane dehydrogenation, but the deactivation is greater in propane dehydrogenation. The literature also discusses the formation of PtGa alloys upon reduction of the catalyst at 873 K, which is attributed to the dilution of Pt ensembles by Ga, enhancing alkane adsorption and inhibiting alkene adsorption. The literature does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it analyze the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The literature does not explicitly state why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

文献讨论了使用Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂对乙烷和丙烷进行催化脱氢。催化剂的活性和选择性受到Ga/Pt比率的影响，在Ga/Pt约为1.45.4时，乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活性达到峰值。向原料中添加氢气可以提高烯烃形成速率，由于氢辅助脱氢作用于表面烷基物种。然而，在氢浓度超过一定值后，烯烃氢化作用开始发生，降低净脱氢速率。镓的存在可以抑制焦炭形成，并且在丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂失活程度低于乙烷脱氢。焦炭沉积量在乙烷脱氢中高于丙烷脱氢，但丙烷脱氢过程中的催化剂失活程度更高。文献还讨论了在873 K下还原催化剂时形成的PtGa合金，这归因于Ga对Pt簇的稀释作用，增强烷烃吸附并抑制烯烃吸附。文献没有提供关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制的详细解释，也没有分析持续辩论中认为哪个步骤是决定性的。文献也没有明确说明为什么这个机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的主题，尽管已经研究了一个世纪。
