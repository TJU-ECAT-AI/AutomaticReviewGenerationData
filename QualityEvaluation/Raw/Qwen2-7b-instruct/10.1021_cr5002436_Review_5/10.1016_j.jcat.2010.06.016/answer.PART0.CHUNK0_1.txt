<p>The dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a Pt catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support was investigated. Catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support,a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4, and selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4.</p>
<p>Adding H2 to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane.</p>
<p>Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydroge- nation. Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%.</p>
<p>The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane.</p>
<p>Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.</p>
<p>The effects of H2/C3H8 ratio on the rate of propene formation and the propene selectivity. The addition of H2 to the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25.</p>
<p>The ratio of hydrogen to ethane partial pressure in the feed was varied from 0 to 2.5, while maintaining the total flow constant by appropriate addition of He.</p>

The investigation focused on using a Pt catalyst supported on a Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide to dehydrogenate ethane and propane. The performance of the catalyst depends on the Ga content in the support, with peaks in activity occurring at specific Ga/Pt ratios for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The selectivity increases monotonically with Ga/Pt, reaching almost 100% at a certain ratio. Adding H2 to the feed enhances the dehydrogenation rate, attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon the dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. Beyond a certain H2 addition, the increase in H2 concentration promotes alkene hydrogenation, reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation. However, hydrogen addition has little impact on alkene selectivity, which remains close to 100%. The presence of Ga suppresses coke formation, with less coke being formed during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane. The higher deactivation rate during propane dehydrogenation is due to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors from propane. Most of the deposited coke is found on the support, with only a small amount on the Pt particles. The addition of H2 to the feed increases the rate of propene formation up to a specific ratio. The H2/C3H8 ratio was varied within a range of 0 to 2.5 while maintaining a constant total flow by adjusting He accordingly.

研究重点是使用Pt催化剂支持在Mg(Ga)(Al)O混合氧化物上进行乙烷和丙烷的脱氢。催化剂性能依赖于支持物中的Ga含量，在特定的Ga/Pt比下，对于乙烷和丙烷脱氢出现峰值活性。随着Ga/Pt的增加，选择性呈单调增加趋势，达到接近100%的比率。向流体中添加H2可以增强脱氢速率，归因于H-原子辅助脱氢作用于形成的烷基物种，该物种是通过反应烷烃的离散吸附形成的。超过一定H2添加量后，H2浓度的进一步增加促进烯烃氢化，从而降低净脱氢速率。然而，向流体添加H2对烯烃选择性影响较小，其保持接近100%的水平。Ga的存在抑制焦炭形成，丙烷脱氢产生的焦炭少于乙烷。丙烷脱氢过程中较高的催化剂失活率是由于从丙烷产生的焦炭前体覆盖Pt表面的比例较高。大多数沉积的焦炭位于支撑物上，只有少量位于Pt颗粒上。向流体中添加H2会增加丙烯生成速率，直到特定比例。H2/C3H8比例在0到2.5之间变化，同时通过调整He维持恒定总流量。
