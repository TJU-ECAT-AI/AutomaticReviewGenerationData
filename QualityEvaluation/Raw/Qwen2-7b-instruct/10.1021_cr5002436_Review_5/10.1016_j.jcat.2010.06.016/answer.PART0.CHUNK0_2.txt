[1] "Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."
[2] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."
[4] "The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane."

Coke formation during alkane dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts supported on Mg(Ga)(Al)O is influenced by several factors. The amount of coke deposited exceeds the amount of exposed Pt, indicating that most coke resides on the support rather than on the Pt particles. There is less coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation, and no direct correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Adding Ga to the catalyst support helps suppress coke formation. The reason for the higher deactivation during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than from ethane.

在使用Mg(Ga)(Al)O支持的Pt催化剂进行烷烃脱氢时，焦炭形成受到几个因素的影响。沉积的焦炭量超过暴露的Pt量，表明大部分焦炭位于支撑体上，而不是位于Pt颗粒上。与乙烷脱氢相比，丙烷脱氢产生的焦炭较少，并且没有发现焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间的直接关联。添加Ga到催化剂支撑中有助于抑制焦炭形成。丙烷脱氢过程中Pt表面覆盖更多焦炭前体的原因是丙烷产生的焦炭前体比乙烷多，这是导致丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂失活程度更高的原因。
