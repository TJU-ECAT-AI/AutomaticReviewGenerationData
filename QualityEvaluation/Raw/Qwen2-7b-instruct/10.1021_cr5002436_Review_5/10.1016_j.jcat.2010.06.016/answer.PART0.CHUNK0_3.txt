[1] "Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."
[2] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "We hypothesize that less mobile coke species derived from propane are responsible for a larger coke buildup on the active metal particles, and hence a larger deactivation."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. These steps are:

1. Adsorption of the alkane molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Dissociation of the alkane molecule, breaking the C-H bonds.
3. Formation of an alkyl radical and hydrogen on the catalyst surface.
4. Migration of the alkyl radical to the surface of the catalyst where it combines with another alkyl radical to form an alkene molecule.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting centers around the dissociation of the alkane molecule and the formation of an alkyl radical. Some researchers argue that the rate-limiting step is the adsorption of the alkane molecule onto the catalyst surface, while others believe it is the dissociation of the alkane molecule.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because the precise rate-determining step is still debated. The mechanism is complex, involving multiple steps, and understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of each step is challenging. This complexity makes it difficult to definitively identify the rate-limiting step. Moreover, experimental conditions and the specific catalyst used can influence the mechanism, leading to variations in the results and interpretations.

The coke formation during dehydrogenation reactions is also a topic of interest. The literature indicates that the type of alkane (ethane vs. propane) affects the coke formation, with propane dehydrogenation leading to less coke formation than ethane dehydrogenation. This is attributed to the ease of hydrogenation of propylene compared to ethylene, affecting the distribution of coke species on the active metal particles. The study of coke formation helps in understanding the deactivation mechanisms and improving catalyst design for more efficient dehydrogenation processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制是催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤：

1. 将烷烃分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 破裂烷烃分子中的C-H键。
3. 在催化剂表面上形成烷基自由基和氢原子。
4. 将烷基自由基迁移到催化剂表面，与另一个烷基自由基结合形成烯烃分子。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性步骤的争论集中在烷烃分子的分解和烷基自由基的形成。一些研究人员认为，速率限制性步骤是烷烃分子在催化剂表面的吸附，而其他人则认为是烷烃分子的分解。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为确定速率限制性步骤的具体步骤仍然存在争议。该机制非常复杂，涉及多个步骤，理解每个步骤的热力学和机制具有挑战性。这种复杂性使得明确识别速率限制性步骤变得困难。此外，实验条件和所使用的具体催化剂可以影响机制，导致结果和解释的变化。

研究焦炭形成也是感兴趣的话题。文献表明，不同类型的烷烃（乙烷与丙烷）对焦炭形成的影响不同，丙烷脱氢产生的焦炭比乙烷少。这归因于丙烯相对于乙烯的氢化更容易，影响活性金属颗粒上焦炭物种的分布。研究焦炭形成有助于理解失活机制并改进脱氢过程的催化剂设计。
