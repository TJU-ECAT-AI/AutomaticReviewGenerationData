[1] "The intrinsic activity of an ensemble of a given size or geometry will depend on its coordination in both the surface and sub- surface planes."
[2] "In regard to the question which is the rate-determining step, step iii has to be discarded in view of our result D, and (i),in view of the general observation that the activation energy for alkane-deuterium exchange over group VIII transition metals is low [lo kcal/mole for platinum (17)]."
[3] "For the dilute alloys this can be either a Pt-Au atom pair of a Pt-Pt pair."
[4] "The chances of such distortion arc slim, however, considering the measurement conditions (high hydrogen pressure, low hydrocarbon pres- sure) and the observation that the dehydrogenation rate is first order in propane over a propane pressure range as wide as 4 X 1O-3 bar < PC, < 0.5 bar (PHI = C = 2 bar)."
[5] "From the combined results (E, B), therefore, we conclude that mechanism Bl is also the preferred one for platinum itself."

(i) The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four primary stages: (i) cleavage of the first C-H bond through a dissociative adsorption process, leading to an adsorbed alkyl group; (ii) cleavage of the second C-H bond, resulting in a ?r- or a-bonded olefin; (iii) desorption of the olefin. Concerning the debate over the rate-limiting step, step iii is excluded due to the high activation energy for alkane-deuterium exchange. Step (i) is ruled out because the activation energy for alkane-deuterium exchange over group VIII transition metals is generally low. The rate-determining step is thus hypothesized to be step (ii), the conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin.

(ii) The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it elucidates the fundamental processes involved in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the precise details of the reaction mechanism, particularly the roles of different catalyst components and the specific steps that occur, continue to be debated. This mechanism provides a framework for understanding how and why certain catalysts are effective in dehydrogenation reactions, but the complexities of the reaction pathways and the interactions between reactants, products, and catalyst surfaces lead to ongoing discussions and refinements in the field.

(i) 哈里蒂-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应包含四个主要步骤：（i）通过离解吸附过程断裂第一个C-H键，产生吸附烷基；（ii）断裂第二个C-H键，形成α或β键烯烃；（iii）烯烃的脱附。关于哪个步骤是决定性的速率步骤的辩论，步骤（iii）被排除，因为丙烷脱氢化时的氢压力范围为4×10^-3巴<PC,<0.5巴（PHI=C=2巴），其率是一阶的。步骤（i）被排除，因为铂族金属上的烷基氘交换的活化能通常较低。因此，决定性的步骤被认为是步骤（ii），即吸附烷基物种转化为吸附烯烃。

(ii) 哈里蒂-波兰尼机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为它揭示了催化脱氢反应的基本过程。尽管近一个世纪的研究，反应机制的具体细节，特别是不同催化剂成分的作用以及发生的具体步骤，仍然存在争论。这个机制为理解为什么某些催化剂在脱氢反应中有效提供了框架，但反应路径的复杂性和反应物、产物与催化剂表面之间的相互作用导致了该领域持续的讨论和改进。
