[1] "The intrinsic activity of an ensemble of a given size or geometry will depend on its coordination in both the surface and sub- surface planes."
[2] "In regard to the question which is the rate-determining step, step iii has to be discarded in view of our result D, and (i),in view of the general observation that the activation energy for alkane-deuterium exchange over group VIII transition metals is low [lo kcal/mole for platinum (17)]."
[3] "For the dilute alloys this can be either a Pt-Au atom pair of a Pt-Pt pair."
[4] "The chances of such distortion arc slim, however, considering the measurement conditions (high hydrogen pressure, low hydrocarbon pres- sure) and the observation that the dehydrogenation rate is first order in propane over a propane pressure range as wide as 4 X 1O-3 bar < PC, < 0.5 bar (PHI = C = 2 bar)."
[5] "From the combined results (E, B), therefore, we conclude that mechanism Bl is also the preferred one for platinum itself."

(i) The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four primary stages: (i) cleavage of the first C-H bond through a dissociative adsorption process, leading to an adsorbed alkyl group; (ii) cleavage of the second C-H bond, resulting in a ?r- or a-bonded olefin; (iii) desorption of the olefin. Concerning the debate over the rate-limiting step, step iii is excluded due to the high activation energy for alkane-deuterium exchange. Step (i) is ruled out because the activation energy for alkane-deuterium exchange over group VIII transition metals is generally low. The rate-determining step is thus hypothesized to be step (ii), the conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin.

(ii) The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it elucidates the fundamental processes involved in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the precise details of the reaction mechanism, particularly the roles of different catalyst components and the specific steps that occur, continue to be debated. This mechanism provides a framework for understanding how and why certain catalysts are effective in dehydrogenation reactions, but the complexities of the reaction pathways and the interactions between reactants, products, and catalyst surfaces lead to ongoing discussions and refinements in the field.

(i) 哈里蒂-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应包含四个主要步骤：（i）通过离解吸附过程断裂第一个C-H键，产生吸附烷基；（ii）断裂第二个C-H键，形成α或β键烯烃；（iii）烯烃的脱附。关于哪个步骤是决定性的速率步骤的辩论，步骤（iii）被排除，因为丙烷脱氢化时的氢压力范围为4×10^-3巴<PC,<0.5巴（PHI=C=2巴），其率是一阶的。步骤（i）被排除，因为铂族金属上的烷基氘交换的活化能通常较低。因此，决定性的步骤被认为是步骤（ii），即吸附烷基物种转化为吸附烯烃。

(ii) 哈里蒂-波兰尼机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为它揭示了催化脱氢反应的基本过程。尽管近一个世纪的研究，反应机制的具体细节，特别是不同催化剂成分的作用以及发生的具体步骤，仍然存在争论。这个机制为理解为什么某些催化剂在脱氢反应中有效提供了框架，但反应路径的复杂性和反应物、产物与催化剂表面之间的相互作用导致了该领域持续的讨论和改进。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps. These steps include the cleavage of the first C-H bond in a dissociative adsorption step, resulting in an adsorbed alkyl group. The second step involves the cleavage of the second C-H bond, leading to the formation of a ?- or ?-bonded olefin. The third step is the desorption of the olefin. The fourth step is the hydrogen transfer. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting has persisted due to the complexity of these reactions and the multitude of factors that influence their kinetics. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it elucidates the intricate process of how catalytic reactions occur at the molecular level.

The intrinsic activity of the platinum atoms forming part of the surface of a dilute platinum-in-gold alloy is essentially independent of the extent of dilution. All rate data obtained on the alloys and on platinum itself can be explained by the same mechanism. This mechanism has as its rate-determining step the conversion of propyl radicals to r-bonded propene, utilizing two adsorption sites located on one platinum atom. The differences in the turnover numbers and the order of the reaction rate in hydrogen between platinum itself and its alloys can be attributed to a difference in surface coverage with hydrogen, with alloy surfaces being comparatively deficient in hydrogen.

铂合金表面部分由稀释铂金构成的铂原子的固有活性与稀释程度无关。获得的合金和铂本身的全部速率数据可以用相同的机制来解释。该机制将丙基自由基转化为乙烯基丙烯作为其速率决定步骤，利用位于一个铂原子上的两个吸附位点。铂本身和其合金之间的周转数差异以及氢反应速率的顺序可以归因于氢覆盖表面的差异，合金表面在氢方面较为匮乏。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. First, cleavage of the first C-H bond occurs in a dissociative adsorption step, resulting in an adsorbed alkyl group. Second, cleavage of the second C-H bond leads to a ?r- or ?-bonded olefin. Third, desorption of the olefin takes place. Fourth, hydrogen transfer from the adsorbed alkyl group to the adsorbed olefin forms the final product. The ongoing debate revolves around identifying which of these steps is the rate-limiting step. 

The first two steps involve the platinum surface, while the last two steps involve the adsorbed alkyl and olefin species. The intrinsic activity of the platinum atoms in dilute platinum-in-gold alloys is found to be independent of the extent of dilution. All rate data obtained on the alloys and on platinum itself can be explained by the same mechanism. This mechanism proposes that the rate-determining step involves conversion of propyl radicals to r-bonded propene, utilizing two adsorption sites on a single platinum atom. The differences in turnover numbers and the order of the reaction rate in hydrogen between platinum and its alloys are attributed to differences in hydrogen coverage on the surface, with alloy surfaces being comparatively deficient in hydrogen. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its implications on the nature of the catalytic sites and the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting continues due to the complexity of the reactions and the presence of multiple pathways. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the intricate nature of the interactions between the catalyst, substrate, and reactants. The findings from the literature suggest that the rate-determining step for the dilute Pt-Au alloys involves one Pt atom only, while the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation is higher compared to hexene-1 double-bond isomerization. The steady-state coverage of hydrogen on Pt-gold surfaces is notably lower than on pure platinum surfaces, providing insights into the comparative efficiency of these materials in catalytic processes.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely studied and debated topic in the field of chemistry. It is centered around the idea of a multi-step process involving the adsorption of a molecule onto a surface, followed by a series of reactions that transform the molecule, and finally its desorption. The mechanism is divided into four main steps:

1. **Adsorption**: The molecule binds to a surface.
2. **Activation**: The molecule undergoes a transformation, often involving the breaking of bonds.
3. **Conversion**: The activated molecule is transformed into a different chemical entity.
4. **Desorption**: The final product is released from the surface.

Regarding the debate about which step is rate-limiting, it is crucial to understand that the specific step that determines the overall reaction rate can vary depending on the conditions and the molecules involved. In the context of dehydrogenation reactions, the conversion step (step 3) often plays a critical role due to the energetics involved in breaking and reforming bonds.

Despite extensive research over nearly a century, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy for several reasons. First, the complexity of the surface chemistry involved makes it challenging to precisely define the roles of different sites on the surface. Second, the mechanism can adapt to various types of molecules and conditions, leading to diverse interpretations. Third, experimental conditions can influence which step becomes rate-limiting, adding layers of complexity to the understanding of the mechanism.

The ongoing debate underscores the importance of continued investigation into the details of catalytic processes. Researchers strive to refine the mechanism to better predict reaction outcomes and optimize catalytic materials for specific applications. The insights gained from these studies not only deepen our understanding of fundamental chemical processes but also drive technological advancements in areas such as energy conversion and material synthesis.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of interest because it encapsulates the essence of catalysis—the acceleration of chemical reactions through the provision of an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. By understanding how and why this mechanism works, scientists can develop more efficient catalysts, improve existing technologies, and potentially discover new ones that can address global challenges, such as the need for sustainable energy sources and cleaner manufacturing processes.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horwuti-Polanyi机制是一个在化学领域广泛研究和争论的话题。它围绕一个包含四个主要步骤的过程展开：吸附、激活、转换和脱附。

关于哪一步是决定性步骤的争论，关键在于理解在不同条件和分子下，决定整体反应速率的具体步骤可能不同。在脱氢反应的背景下，转换步骤（第三步）往往起着关键作用，因为涉及到断裂和重新形成键的能量差异。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horwuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，原因有以下几点：

1. 表面化学的复杂性使得精确定义表面不同位点的作用变得困难。
2. 机制能够适应各种类型的分子和条件，导致不同的解释。
3. 实验条件可以影响哪个步骤成为决定性步骤，为理解机制增添复杂性。

持续的争论强调了深入研究催化过程细节的重要性。研究人员努力细化机制，以更准确地预测反应结果，并优化催化剂材料用于特定应用。这些研究不仅加深了我们对基本化学过程的理解，也推动了能源转换和材料合成等领域的技术进步。

由于Horwuti-Polanyi机制概括了催化的基本原理——通过提供较低活化能的替代反应途径来加速化学反应，理解其工作原理有助于科学家开发更高效的催化剂、改进现有技术，并可能发现解决全球挑战（如可持续能源需求和清洁制造过程）的新方法。
