[1] "Considering the dehydrogenation reaction, the intrinsic activity of the platinum atoms forming part of the surface of a dilute platinum-in-gold alloy is essentially independent of the extent of dilution (0.5 atom% < xbPt < 14 atom%)."
[2] "All rate data, i.e., those obtained on the alloys and on platinum itself, can be accounted for by the same mechanism."
[3] "This mechanism has as the rate-determining step the conversion of propyl radicals to r-bonded propene, using two adsorption sites located on one platinum atom."
[4] "The differences between platinum itself and its alloys, manifest in the turnover numbers and the order of the reaction rate in hydrogen, derive according to the proposed mechanism from a difference in surface coverage with hydrogen, the alloy surfaces being comparatively deficient in hydrogen."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. First, cleavage of the first C-H bond occurs in a dissociative adsorption step, resulting in an adsorbed alkyl group. Second, cleavage of the second C-H bond leads to a ?r- or ?-bonded olefin. Third, desorption of the olefin takes place. Fourth, hydrogen transfer from the adsorbed alkyl group to the adsorbed olefin forms the final product. The ongoing debate revolves around identifying which of these steps is the rate-limiting step. 

The first two steps involve the platinum surface, while the last two steps involve the adsorbed alkyl and olefin species. The intrinsic activity of the platinum atoms in dilute platinum-in-gold alloys is found to be independent of the extent of dilution. All rate data obtained on the alloys and on platinum itself can be explained by the same mechanism. This mechanism proposes that the rate-determining step involves conversion of propyl radicals to r-bonded propene, utilizing two adsorption sites on a single platinum atom. The differences in turnover numbers and the order of the reaction rate in hydrogen between platinum and its alloys are attributed to differences in hydrogen coverage on the surface, with alloy surfaces being comparatively deficient in hydrogen. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its implications on the nature of the catalytic sites and the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化脱氢反应涉及四个主要步骤。首先，在解离吸附步骤中，第一个C-H键断裂，形成吸附烷基团。其次，第二个C-H键的断裂产生一个？或？-键化的烯烃。第三步是烯烃的脱附。第四步是吸附烷基团中的氢向吸附烯烃的转移，形成最终产物。关于这些步骤中哪一步是决定性的步骤的争论持续存在。

前两步涉及铂表面，而最后两步涉及吸附的烷基和烯烃物种。稀释的铂-金合金表面的铂原子的固有活性发现与稀释程度无关。获得的合金和纯铂的所有速率数据可以用相同的机制解释。该机制提出，决定性步骤是将丙基自由基转化为r键化的丙烯，利用单个铂原子上的两个吸附位点。铂及其合金之间的周转数差异和氢反应速率的顺序可以归因于表面氢覆盖的差异，合金表面的氢含量较低。由于该机制对催化位点的性质和脱氢过程效率的影响，因此它仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题。
