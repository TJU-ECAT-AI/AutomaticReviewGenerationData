[1] "Considering the dehydrogenation reaction, the intrinsic activity of the platinum atoms forming part of the surface of a dilute platinum-in-gold alloy is essentially independent of the extent of dilution (0.5 atom% < xbPt < 14 atom%)."
[2] "All rate data, i.e., those obtained on the alloys and on platinum itself, can be accounted for by the same mechanism."
[3] "This mechanism has as the rate-determining step the conversion of propyl radicals to r-bonded propene, using two adsorption sites located on one platinum atom."
[4] "The differences between platinum itself and its alloys, manifest in the turnover numbers and the order of the reaction rate in hydrogen, derive according to the proposed mechanism from a difference in surface coverage with hydrogen, the alloy surfaces being comparatively deficient in hydrogen."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps. These steps include the cleavage of the first C-H bond in a dissociative adsorption step, resulting in an adsorbed alkyl group. The second step involves the cleavage of the second C-H bond, leading to the formation of a ?- or ?-bonded olefin. The third step is the desorption of the olefin. The fourth step is the hydrogen transfer. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting has persisted due to the complexity of these reactions and the multitude of factors that influence their kinetics. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it elucidates the intricate process of how catalytic reactions occur at the molecular level.

The intrinsic activity of the platinum atoms forming part of the surface of a dilute platinum-in-gold alloy is essentially independent of the extent of dilution. All rate data obtained on the alloys and on platinum itself can be explained by the same mechanism. This mechanism has as its rate-determining step the conversion of propyl radicals to r-bonded propene, utilizing two adsorption sites located on one platinum atom. The differences in the turnover numbers and the order of the reaction rate in hydrogen between platinum itself and its alloys can be attributed to a difference in surface coverage with hydrogen, with alloy surfaces being comparatively deficient in hydrogen.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤。这些步骤包括在解离吸附步骤中断裂第一个C-H键，产生一个吸附的烷基团。第二步涉及断裂第二个C-H键，形成?-或?-键化的烯烃。第三步是烯烃的脱附。第四步是氢转移。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论一直存在，这主要是由于这些反应的复杂性和影响它们动力学的众多因素。尽管已经研究了一个多世纪，但这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它揭示了分子水平上催化反应发生的过程的复杂性。

铂合金表面部分由稀释铂金构成的铂原子的固有活性与稀释程度无关。获得的合金和铂本身的全部速率数据可以用相同的机制来解释。该机制将丙基自由基转化为乙烯基丙烯作为其速率决定步骤，利用位于一个铂原子上的两个吸附位点。铂本身和其合金之间的周转数差异以及氢反应速率的顺序可以归因于氢覆盖表面的差异，合金表面在氢方面较为匮乏。
