[1] "The activation energies for propene dehydrogenation over Pt and dilute Pt-Au alloys are equal within the experimental error."
[2] "The order in hydrogen of the dehydrogenation rate is - 1.0 over Pt and -0.5 over the dilute Pt-Au alloys."
[3] "The rate-determining step with the dilute alloys involves one Pt atom only."
[4] "The activation energy for propane dehydrogenation (29 kcal/mole) is distinctly higher than that for hexene-1 double-bond isomerization in the region of zero reaction order (19 kcal/mole)."
[5] "The steady-state coverage, with hydrogen (at P = 0.1 Torr Hz and T > 120C), of platinum atoms on platinum-gold surfaces is very low and considerably below that of platinum atoms on platinum surfaces."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: cleavage of the first C-H bond in a dissociative adsorption step, leading to an adsorbed alkyl group; cleavage of the second C-H bond, resulting in a ?r- or a-bonded olefin; and desorption of the olefin. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting continues due to the complexity of the reactions and the presence of multiple pathways. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the intricate nature of the interactions between the catalyst, substrate, and reactants. The findings from the literature suggest that the rate-determining step for the dilute Pt-Au alloys involves one Pt atom only, while the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation is higher compared to hexene-1 double-bond isomerization. The steady-state coverage of hydrogen on Pt-gold surfaces is notably lower than on pure platinum surfaces, providing insights into the comparative efficiency of these materials in catalytic processes.

该文献中关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：首先断裂C-H键的解离吸附步骤，导致吸附的烷基团；其次断裂第二个C-H键，产生?-或?-键烯烃；最后是烯烃的脱附。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的争论仍在继续，这是由于反应的复杂性和存在的多个途径。尽管近一个世纪的研究，这个机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为催化剂、底物和反应物之间相互作用的复杂性。文献中的发现表明，稀释的Pt-Au合金中的速率决定步骤仅涉及一个Pt原子，而丙烷脱氢的活化能高于己烯-1双键异构化的活化能。Pt-gold表面的氢稳定状态覆盖明显低于纯铂表面，为这些材料在催化过程中的相对效率提供了见解。
