The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface. The second step is the dehydrogenation reaction, where hydrogen atoms are removed from the hydrocarbon molecule. The third step is the activation of the resulting species, often involving the formation of an intermediate with a higher energy state. The fourth step is the desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. 

Regarding the ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting, there is no clear consensus. The dehydrogenation reaction itself is typically considered to be rate-limiting at lower temperatures. However, the rate-limiting step might shift to the activation step at higher temperatures, where the formation of the intermediate requires more energy. This can depend on the specific catalyst, the temperature, and the conditions of the reaction.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of dehydrogenation reactions and the influence of various factors such as temperature, catalyst properties, and reaction conditions. Understanding the precise mechanisms and rate-limiting steps is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes and developing more efficient catalysts.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is particularly relevant in the context of ethane hydrogenolysis, which is a key process in petrochemical industries. The comprehensive DFT study presented in the paper investigates the reaction intermediates, reaction barriers, and pathways involved in ethane hydrogenolysis on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces. The study reveals that on Pt(211), CH2CH2 and CH3CH can be formed very rapidly, whereas on Pt(111), CH3CH can be dehydrogenated rapidly to form CH3C. The barriers for CC bond breaking are also discussed, indicating that it occurs most probably through CH3CH2, CH3CH, and CHCH intermediates. The lack of isomerization reactions and the preference for certain pathways over others contribute to the ongoing interest and debate in the field.

At low temperatures, the dehydrogenation of CH3CH3 to CH2CH2 is the primary process. As the temperature increases, C2H4 can further dehydrogenate to form more highly dehydrogenated C2Hx species, and CC bond cleavage can also occur. This dual process is influenced by the kinetic parameters and thermodynamics of the reaction, making it a dynamic and complex phenomenon that continues to attract attention from researchers.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，其包含四个主要步骤。第一步是烃分子在催化剂表面的吸附。第二步是脱氢反应，其中从烃分子中去除氢原子。第三步是对形成的物种进行活化，通常涉及形成更高能量状态的中间体。第四步是从催化剂表面释放产物。

关于哪一步是决定性的争论，目前没有明确的共识。在较低温度下，脱氢反应本身通常被认为是决定性的。然而，在较高温度下，形成中间体所需的能量更多，因此激活步骤可能会成为决定性的步骤。这可能取决于催化剂的具体特性、温度和反应条件。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，原因在于脱氢反应的复杂性以及温度、催化剂特性和反应条件的影响。理解精确的机制和决定性步骤对于优化催化过程和开发更高效的催化剂至关重要。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制特别适用于乙烷脱氢化，这是石油化工行业中的关键过程。论文中进行了全面的第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）研究，探讨了乙烷脱氢化在Pt(111)和Pt(211)表面上的反应中间体、反应势垒和途径。研究表明，在Pt(211)表面上，CH2CH2和CH3CH可以非常快速地形成，而在Pt(111)表面上，CH3CH可以快速脱氢形成CH3C。CC键断裂的势垒也得到了讨论，表明它主要通过CH3CH2、CH3CH和CHCH中间体发生。缺乏异构化反应以及对某些途径的偏好继续吸引研究人员的关注。

低温下，将CH3CH3脱氢化为CH2CH2是主要过程。随着温度升高，C2H4可以进一步脱氢形成更高度脱氢化的C2Hx物种，并同时发生CC键断裂。这个双重过程受到动力学参数和反应热力学的影响，是一个动态且复杂的现象，继续吸引着研究者的关注。
