The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the adsorption of the hydrocarbon molecule onto the catalyst surface. The second step is the dehydrogenation reaction, where hydrogen atoms are removed from the hydrocarbon molecule. The third step is the activation of the resulting species, often involving the formation of an intermediate with a higher energy state. The fourth step is the desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. 

Regarding the ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting, there is no clear consensus. The dehydrogenation reaction itself is typically considered to be rate-limiting at lower temperatures. However, the rate-limiting step might shift to the activation step at higher temperatures, where the formation of the intermediate requires more energy. This can depend on the specific catalyst, the temperature, and the conditions of the reaction.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the complexity of dehydrogenation reactions and the influence of various factors such as temperature, catalyst properties, and reaction conditions. Understanding the precise mechanisms and rate-limiting steps is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes and developing more efficient catalysts.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is particularly relevant in the context of ethane hydrogenolysis, which is a key process in petrochemical industries. The comprehensive DFT study presented in the paper investigates the reaction intermediates, reaction barriers, and pathways involved in ethane hydrogenolysis on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces. The study reveals that on Pt(211), CH2CH2 and CH3CH can be formed very rapidly, whereas on Pt(111), CH3CH can be dehydrogenated rapidly to form CH3C. The barriers for CC bond breaking are also discussed, indicating that it occurs most probably through CH3CH2, CH3CH, and CHCH intermediates. The lack of isomerization reactions and the preference for certain pathways over others contribute to the ongoing interest and debate in the field.

At low temperatures, the dehydrogenation of CH3CH3 to CH2CH2 is the primary process. As the temperature increases, C2H4 can further dehydrogenate to form more highly dehydrogenated C2Hx species, and CC bond cleavage can also occur. This dual process is influenced by the kinetic parameters and thermodynamics of the reaction, making it a dynamic and complex phenomenon that continues to attract attention from researchers.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，其包含四个主要步骤。第一步是烃分子在催化剂表面的吸附。第二步是脱氢反应，其中从烃分子中去除氢原子。第三步是对形成的物种进行活化，通常涉及形成更高能量状态的中间体。第四步是从催化剂表面释放产物。

关于哪一步是决定性的争论，目前没有明确的共识。在较低温度下，脱氢反应本身通常被认为是决定性的。然而，在较高温度下，形成中间体所需的能量更多，因此激活步骤可能会成为决定性的步骤。这可能取决于催化剂的具体特性、温度和反应条件。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的焦点，原因在于脱氢反应的复杂性以及温度、催化剂特性和反应条件的影响。理解精确的机制和决定性步骤对于优化催化过程和开发更高效的催化剂至关重要。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制特别适用于乙烷脱氢化，这是石油化工行业中的关键过程。论文中进行了全面的第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）研究，探讨了乙烷脱氢化在Pt(111)和Pt(211)表面上的反应中间体、反应势垒和途径。研究表明，在Pt(211)表面上，CH2CH2和CH3CH可以非常快速地形成，而在Pt(111)表面上，CH3CH可以快速脱氢形成CH3C。CC键断裂的势垒也得到了讨论，表明它主要通过CH3CH2、CH3CH和CHCH中间体发生。缺乏异构化反应以及对某些途径的偏好继续吸引研究人员的关注。

低温下，将CH3CH3脱氢化为CH2CH2是主要过程。随着温度升高，C2H4可以进一步脱氢形成更高度脱氢化的C2Hx物种，并同时发生CC键断裂。这个双重过程受到动力学参数和反应热力学的影响，是一个动态且复杂的现象，继续吸引着研究者的关注。

The most stable C2 species on Pt(111) and Pt(211) is ethylidyne (CH3C). There is a strong linear relationship between the final states and transition states' energies relative to the initial states' energies, as demonstrated by Alcala et al.'s method, with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99). In ethane hydrogenolysis on Pt, isomerization reactions are not favored. At low temperatures, CH3CH3 readily dehydrogenates to form CH2CH2. At higher temperatures, C2H4 further dehydrogenates to create highly dehydrogenated C2Hx species, alongside CC bond cleavage.

在Pt(111)和Pt(211)上，最稳定的C2物种是乙基炔（CH3C）。Alcala等人提出的方法证明了最终状态和过渡态的能量与初始态能量之间的良好线性关系，具有高相关系数（R2 = 0.99）。在Pt上的乙烷氢解中，异构化反应不受青睐。低温下，CH3CH3容易脱氢形成CH2CH2。高温时，C2H4进一步脱氢生成高度脱氢化的C2Hx物种，并同时发生CC键断裂。

<p>While several computational studies have been performed, there is still not a comprehensive DFT study for all reactions on multiple surfaces. For example, Dumesic and co-workers (12, 13) only reported reaction barriers for cleavage of the CC bond in CH3CH2, CH3CH, and CH2CH on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces and did not calculate any isomerization reaction between C2 species, despite proposing these to be important. On Pt(110), King and co-workers (14) studied all the elementary steps for dehydrogenation of ethane, but they only computed CC bond scission in CHC and 1,2-H shift between CH3CH and CH2CH2.</p>
<p>In this paper, we perform a comprehensive DFT study of the reaction intermediates and reaction barriers of elementary like reaction steps in both hydrogenation of ethylene and its reverse (ethane dehydrogenation) and hydrogenolysis of ethane on Pt(111) and Pt(211). This is the first attempt to examine all elementary relevant steps for CC cleavage in C2 species and isomerization reactions between C2 species on both surfaces.</p>
<p>We found that most of the species on Pt(211) are more stable than those on Pt(111) and CH3C is the most stable C2 species on Pt(111) and Pt(211).</p>
<p>Key conclusions include the following: (i) On Pt(211), CH2CH2 and CH3CH can be formed very rapidly from ethane with low reaction barriers. (ii) On Pt(111), CH3CH can be dehydrogenated rapidly to form CH3C. (iii) The barriers of CHC formation are very high. (iv) Isomerization reactions do not appear to be energetically favored on Pt. (v) CC bond breaking takes place most probably through CH3CH2, CH3CH, and CHCH.</p>
<p>Microkinetic analysis using these DFT results and comparison to data will be valuable future steps to provide quantitative insights into these complex processes.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions typically involves four main steps. These steps are as follows:

1. **Hydrogenation**: Hydrogen molecules (H2) react with a substrate molecule, usually involving the formation of a hydrogen-atom (H) attached to the substrate.

2. **Bond-breaking**: The hydrogen-atom (H) is then abstracted from the substrate, breaking the bond between the two atoms that were previously bonded together.

3. **Isomerization**: The newly formed species may undergo isomerization, which involves a rearrangement of atoms within the molecule to form a different isomer.

4. **Decomposition**: The final step involves the decomposition of the newly formed species, often resulting in the production of smaller molecules.

Regarding the ongoing debate on which step is considered rate-limiting, the answer varies depending on the specific conditions and substrates involved. The rate-limiting step can shift based on factors such as the temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the precise rate-determining step can depend on subtle changes in reaction conditions, making it challenging to universally determine the rate-limiting step.

Despite extensive research, the mechanism is still evolving, with new insights continually emerging from experimental and computational studies. The complexity arises from the interplay of various factors, including the kinetics of each step, the stability of intermediates, and the influence of the catalyst surface. As such, understanding the mechanism requires a nuanced approach that considers the dynamic interplay between these factors.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制通常涉及四个主要步骤。这些步骤如下：

1. **加氢反应**：氢分子（H2）与基质分子反应，通常形成一个附着在基质上的氢原子（H）。

2. **键断裂**：然后从基质抽象氢原子，断裂之前连接在一起的两个原子之间的键。

3. **异构化**：新形成的物种可能会经历异构化，即通过重新排列分子内的原子来形成不同的异构体。

4. **分解**：最后一步涉及分解新形成的物种，通常导致生成较小的分子。

关于哪一步被认为是速率决定步骤的持续争议，答案取决于特定条件和所涉及的底物。速率决定步骤可以根据温度、压力以及催化剂的性质等因素而变化。尽管研究了近一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为精确的速率决定步骤取决于微妙的变化反应条件，这使得很难普遍确定速率决定步骤。

尽管进行了广泛的研究，机制仍在不断发展，新的见解不断涌现，来自于实验和计算研究。复杂性源自各个步骤的动态相互作用因素，包括各步的速率、中间体的稳定性以及催化剂表面的影响。因此，理解机制需要一种细致的方法，考虑这些因素之间的动态互动。
