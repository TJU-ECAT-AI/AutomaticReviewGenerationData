[1] "It is now generally accepted that the CH3C surface intermediate is one of the most abundant species in ethane hydrogenolysis over close-packed fcc(111) and hcp(0001) metal surfaces."
[2] "Interestingly, by means of the method suggested by Alcala et al., (42) we found a good linear relationship between final states (FSs) and TSs energies which are relative to IS gas-phase energies with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99), as shown in Figure 7."

The CH3C surface intermediate is widely recognized as a predominant species during ethane hydrogenolysis on close-packed fcc(111) and hcp(0001) metal surfaces. The study revealed a strong linear connection between the energies of transition states (TSs) and final states (FSs) compared to the initial state (IS) gas-phase energies, with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99), as depicted in Figure 7.

Answer: The CH3C surface intermediate is considered one of the most common species in ethane hydrogenolysis on closely packed fcc(111) and hcp(0001) metal surfaces. The research found a significant linear correlation between the energies of transition states (TSs) and final states (FSs) relative to the initial state (IS) gas-phase energies, with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99), as illustrated in Figure 7.

中国版答案：在fcc(111)和hcp(0001)紧密排列的金属表面上的乙烷氢解过程中，CH3C表面中间体被认为是最常见的物种之一。研究发现，TSs的能量与FSs以及相对于IS气体相能量的IS能量之间存在明显的线性关系，相关系数（R2 = 0.99），如图7所示。
