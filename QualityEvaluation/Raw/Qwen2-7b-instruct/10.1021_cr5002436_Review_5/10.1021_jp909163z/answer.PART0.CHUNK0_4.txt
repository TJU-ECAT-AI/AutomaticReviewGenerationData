<p>While several computational studies have been performed, there is still not a comprehensive DFT study for all reactions on multiple surfaces. For example, Dumesic and co-workers (12, 13) only reported reaction barriers for cleavage of the CC bond in CH3CH2, CH3CH, and CH2CH on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces and did not calculate any isomerization reaction between C2 species, despite proposing these to be important. On Pt(110), King and co-workers (14) studied all the elementary steps for dehydrogenation of ethane, but they only computed CC bond scission in CHC and 1,2-H shift between CH3CH and CH2CH2.</p>
<p>In this paper, we perform a comprehensive DFT study of the reaction intermediates and reaction barriers of elementary like reaction steps in both hydrogenation of ethylene and its reverse (ethane dehydrogenation) and hydrogenolysis of ethane on Pt(111) and Pt(211). This is the first attempt to examine all elementary relevant steps for CC cleavage in C2 species and isomerization reactions between C2 species on both surfaces.</p>
<p>We found that most of the species on Pt(211) are more stable than those on Pt(111) and CH3C is the most stable C2 species on Pt(111) and Pt(211).</p>
<p>Key conclusions include the following: (i) On Pt(211), CH2CH2 and CH3CH can be formed very rapidly from ethane with low reaction barriers. (ii) On Pt(111), CH3CH can be dehydrogenated rapidly to form CH3C. (iii) The barriers of CHC formation are very high. (iv) Isomerization reactions do not appear to be energetically favored on Pt. (v) CC bond breaking takes place most probably through CH3CH2, CH3CH, and CHCH.</p>
<p>Microkinetic analysis using these DFT results and comparison to data will be valuable future steps to provide quantitative insights into these complex processes.</p>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions typically involves four main steps. These steps are as follows:

1. **Hydrogenation**: Hydrogen molecules (H2) react with a substrate molecule, usually involving the formation of a hydrogen-atom (H) attached to the substrate.

2. **Bond-breaking**: The hydrogen-atom (H) is then abstracted from the substrate, breaking the bond between the two atoms that were previously bonded together.

3. **Isomerization**: The newly formed species may undergo isomerization, which involves a rearrangement of atoms within the molecule to form a different isomer.

4. **Decomposition**: The final step involves the decomposition of the newly formed species, often resulting in the production of smaller molecules.

Regarding the ongoing debate on which step is considered rate-limiting, the answer varies depending on the specific conditions and substrates involved. The rate-limiting step can shift based on factors such as the temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the precise rate-determining step can depend on subtle changes in reaction conditions, making it challenging to universally determine the rate-limiting step.

Despite extensive research, the mechanism is still evolving, with new insights continually emerging from experimental and computational studies. The complexity arises from the interplay of various factors, including the kinetics of each step, the stability of intermediates, and the influence of the catalyst surface. As such, understanding the mechanism requires a nuanced approach that considers the dynamic interplay between these factors.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制通常涉及四个主要步骤。这些步骤如下：

1. **加氢反应**：氢分子（H2）与基质分子反应，通常形成一个附着在基质上的氢原子（H）。

2. **键断裂**：然后从基质抽象氢原子，断裂之前连接在一起的两个原子之间的键。

3. **异构化**：新形成的物种可能会经历异构化，即通过重新排列分子内的原子来形成不同的异构体。

4. **分解**：最后一步涉及分解新形成的物种，通常导致生成较小的分子。

关于哪一步被认为是速率决定步骤的持续争议，答案取决于特定条件和所涉及的底物。速率决定步骤可以根据温度、压力以及催化剂的性质等因素而变化。尽管研究了近一个世纪，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为精确的速率决定步骤取决于微妙的变化反应条件，这使得很难普遍确定速率决定步骤。

尽管进行了广泛的研究，机制仍在不断发展，新的见解不断涌现，来自于实验和计算研究。复杂性源自各个步骤的动态相互作用因素，包括各步的速率、中间体的稳定性以及催化剂表面的影响。因此，理解机制需要一种细致的方法，考虑这些因素之间的动态互动。
