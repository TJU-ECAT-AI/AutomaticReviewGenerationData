The most stable C2 species on Pt(111) and Pt(211) is ethylidyne (CH3C). There is a strong linear relationship between the final states and transition states' energies relative to the initial states' energies, as demonstrated by Alcala et al.'s method, with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99). In ethane hydrogenolysis on Pt, isomerization reactions are not favored. At low temperatures, CH3CH3 readily dehydrogenates to form CH2CH2. At higher temperatures, C2H4 further dehydrogenates to create highly dehydrogenated C2Hx species, alongside CC bond cleavage.

在Pt(111)和Pt(211)上，最稳定的C2物种是乙基炔（CH3C）。Alcala等人提出的方法证明了最终状态和过渡态的能量与初始态能量之间的良好线性关系，具有高相关系数（R2 = 0.99）。在Pt上的乙烷氢解中，异构化反应不受青睐。低温下，CH3CH3容易脱氢形成CH2CH2。高温时，C2H4进一步脱氢生成高度脱氢化的C2Hx物种，并同时发生CC键断裂。
