1. Catalytic reactions, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, cracking, and isomerization, play crucial roles in the petrochemical industry. For example, a pioneering study by Dodd and Watson explored the dehydrogenation of butane and butene over chromia-alumina catalysts. It was concluded that the rate-determining step in these reactions was specific.

2. The methodology involved outlining potential elementary steps logically and deriving rate equations to demonstrate alignment with the observed reaction mechanisms.

3. The study focused on the kinetic analysis of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of propane and propylene over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts.

4. The initial reaction rates were calculated from the initial slopes of the pressure-time curves.

5. The experimental data for the dehydrogenation of propane showed a higher linearity compared to the hydrogenation of propylene.

6. Adsorption equilibrium constants were obtained from figures 3 and 4 and listed in table 2.

7. The adsorption equilibrium constants for K1, Kz, and Kt matched within experimental errors, confirming the consistency between dehydrogenation of propane and hydrogenation of propylene.

1. 在石油化工行业中，催化反应，包括脱氢、加氢、裂解和异构化等过程非常重要。例如，Dodd 和 Watson 对正丁烷和正丁烯在氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂上的脱氢进行了先驱研究。研究表明，这些反应中的速率决定步骤具有特定性。

2. 研究方法涉及逻辑地列出可能的基本步骤，并推导出速率方程，以展示实验结果与这种反应机制的一致性。

3. 研究关注了在氧化铬-氧化铝-钾氧化物催化剂上丙烷和丙烯的脱氢和加氢的动态分析。

4. 初始反应速率是从压力-时间曲线的初始斜率中获得的。

5. 丙烷脱氢实验数据的线性度高于丙烯加氢。

6. 从图3和图4中获得了吸附平衡常数，并列在表2中。

7. 从丙烷脱氢和丙烯加氢独立得到的吸附平衡常数K1、Kz和Kt在实验误差范围内一致，这证实了两者之间的一致性。
