The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps. First, a hydrogen molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface. Second, the hydrogen molecule dissociates, releasing hydrogen atoms. Third, these hydrogen atoms react with the adsorbed hydrocarbon molecule, leading to the formation of a double bond. Lastly, the product molecule desorbs from the surface. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its ability to explain various aspects of dehydrogenation reactions, including the selectivity towards certain products. The ongoing debate concerns which of these steps is considered rate-limiting. Some studies suggest that the adsorption of the hydrogen molecule might be the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule or the reaction of hydrogen atoms with the hydrocarbon is more crucial. Despite nearly a century of study, the precise details of the rate-determining step in dehydrogenation reactions continue to be a subject of scientific inquiry.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤。首先，氢分子吸附到催化剂表面。第二步，氢分子发生解离，释放氢原子。第三步，这些氢原子与吸附在表面的烃分子反应，导致形成双键。最后一步是产物分子从表面脱离。该机制之所以引起科学界的持续关注，是因为它能够解释脱氢反应的各种方面，包括对某些产品的选择性。关于哪一步是决定性的步骤，存在持续的争论。一些研究认为，氢分子的吸附可能是决定性的步骤，而其他研究则提出氢原子与烃分子的反应更为关键。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但脱氢反应中精确的决定性步骤仍然是一门科学领域的研究重点。
