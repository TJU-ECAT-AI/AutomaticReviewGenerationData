Department of Chenuktrq, Faculty of Education, Utsunomiya University, Minmzachi,rtsunotniyn, Jnpnn Received March 19, 1076; revised October 7, 1076 The dehydrogenation of propane and the hydrogenat,ion of propylene were kinetically investigated over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts. The reactions were carried out in conventional closed static reactor at temperatures ranging from 443 to 505C. The rmls were performed on propane, propane + propylene, propane + hydrogen and propylene + hydrogen. The rates were obtained from the initial slope of the pressure-t,ime curves. The lea&on rate data were described satisfactorily with the rate equation such as r = (&IKIPcH - IIKIIIKPHPcH)/( + KIvPH) (1 + KIPc$H + KIIIPcH).

INTRODUCTION
Catalytic reactions involving dehydro- genation, hydrogenation,cracking and iso- merization are important processes in the petrochemical industry.
Among these the dehydrogenation of butane over chromia- alumina catalysts is one of the most im- portant processes for obtaining butenes and butadine.
Besides being of commercial interest,both dehydrogenation and hydro- genation of Ck hydrocarbons occur in a temperature range convenient for kinetic investigation.
Both reactions have been extensively investigated from industrial and scientific points of view.
Dodd and Watson (1) made a pioneer study of butane and butene dehydrogena- tion over chromia-alumina catalyst.
They set the pattern for much of the later work of the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydro- carbons. The kinetic data were treated by the rate equations developed by Hougen and Watson (,2), and indicated the dual- site mechanism. In contrast with the results of Dodd and Watson
(I),
Balandin (3) described the rates of a large body of catalytic dehydrogenation using a single- site mechanism.
Carra et al. (4) described butane dehydrogenation over chromia- alumina,catalysts with allowance of the reversibility of the reaction and proposed a dual-site mechanism.
Happel et al. (5) indicated that neither the dual-site mecha- nism nor the single-site mechanism was able to afford satisfactory description for butane dehydrogenation over chromia-alumina catalyst.
Thereafter,they (6) determined both the forward and the reverse reaction rates in butane dehydrogenation with a mixture of ?l-butane, I-butene and hydro- gen in which one of the hydrocarbons was radioactively tagged.
The study of the reaction rate occurring in the dehydrogenation of butane involves many difficulties associated wit,h the com- plexity of the system such as the formation of the butene isomers and the isomeriza- tion of the isomers. In this investigation,239 Copyright 0 1977 by Academic Press, Inc.

a Initial rate of dehydrogenation of propane at 443C in units of 1Or0 molecules/set cm2. Initial pressure of propane : 10 Tow. we performed a study of the kinetics of Ca hydrocarbons because both the dehydro- genation and the hydrogenation of Cs hydrocarbons occur in conventional tem- perature ranges and no isomers were formed in the reaction.
In this paper, we describe the mechanism of the dehydrogenation of propane over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide in some detail. The approach adopted was to set down logically many of the possible ele- mentary steps and to derive rate equations to show that the experimental results con- form to such a reaction mechanism.
EXPERIMENTAL
METHODS
Catalyst Alumina was used as a carrier and was prepared from alumina sol (Alumina Sol
200: Nissan Chemical Co. Ltd.) as follows.
The alumina sol was dried to alumina gel over a water bath, then dried in a drying furnace overnight at 110C. Then, the gel was crushed, sieved and sizes between 16-32 mesh were separated. The alumina gel was immersed in calculated amounts of mixed aqueous solutions of chromic nitrate at 70C for 3 hr. The water was evaporated and calcined at 600C. The weight percent of Crz03 and I&O and the BET surface areas determined by adsorption of nitrogen are summarized in Table 1. The catalyst thus obtained was calcined under vacuum at 500C for 2 hr and heated under 200 Torr of hydrogen for a certain number of hours at the same temperature. Then, the ca.talyst was calcined under vacuum at 500C for 2 hr and used for the first run. The sub- sequent runs were performed after 2-hr evacuation at reaction temperature after the former runs.
Reactants Hydrogen was supplied from Takachiho Chem. Ind.
Co. Ltd. and purified by passage through copper powder heated at 400C and through a liquid nitrogen trap.
Propane and propylene were supplied from Takachiho Chem. Ind. Co. Ltd. and puri- fied by repeated distillations.
No impurities were detected by gas- solid chromatography (GSC) analyses.
Gas Analyses Analyses of hydrocarbons were per- formed by GSC with a 60-cm column of silica gel at 60C. Helium was used as a carrier gas and its flow rate was about 40 ml/min.
Apparatus The apparatus consists of 3OOO:ml Pyrex bulb equipped with a cavity for catalyst

241 bed, a preheater, an oil manometer and a gas handling device for GSC. The bulb,except for the cavity, was surrounded with a metal jacket filled with water maintained at a constant temperature as described previously (7).
RESULTS
AND DISCUSSION
Preliminary Run No products other than propylene and hydrogen were detected by gas chromato- graphic analyses in the initialstage at 443C.Formation of methane and ethane (crack- ing),however, was observed with gas chromatographic analyses as the reaction proceeded and the propylene formed. Initial rate, therefore, was estimated from the initial slope of the pressure-time curve as described previously (7). The initial pres- sure of propane was obtained from a graphical extrapolation to zero time on the pressure-time curve. The initial dehydro- genation rates changed with increasing potassium content of the Cr203-A120rKz0 catalysts and are tabulated in Table 1.
Table 1 shows that No. 4 Crz03-A1203- KzO catalyst is the most active of our catalysts and No. 4 catalyst was used in the following runs. The rate of dehydro- genation of propane changed also with the time of the hydrogen treatment. The maxi- mum activity in the dehydrogenation was $

The color of the catalyst changed to deep green from deep brown with the hydrogen treatment.
The BET surface area determined with nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature did not change. The change in the activity of the dehydrogenation may,therefore, be attributed to the change in the oxidation state of the chromium. In the following experiments, we used as catalyst No. 4 Crz03-A120rK20 catalyst which was treated with 200 Torr of hydrogen for 1 hr at 500C.
Dehydrogenation of Propane The catalytic activity decreased grad- ually with every run and reached a settled one. The settled initial rates of dehydro- genation of propane thus obtained were plotted against the initial pressures of propane as shown in Fig. 1. This behavior can be expressed with the Langmuir-type kinetic equation such as k,K&xHs FoO = 1 +

(1) where kl and KI are constants, ?$ and PcHO are initial rate of the dehydrogena- tion and the initial pressure of propane,respectively. Equation (1) can be written as follows :(pW,/ioo)

l/T,the apparent activation energy 33.9 kcal/mole and the adsorption enthalpy

were obtained.
Reaction Mechanism and Rate Equation Twenty-two possible reaction paths were considered which were constituted from several elementary reaction steps. In these reaction paths,we have considered an associative mechanism, dissociative mecha- nism, Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, Eley-Rideal mechanism, single-site mecha- nsim and dual-site mechanism (8). Rate equations can be derived on condition that one of the elementary steps is the rate determining one in each reaction path.
One hundred and three of the possible rate equations were derived from 103 cor- responding mechanisms.
Ninty-three of these rate equations could not interpret the dependency of the initial rate of the de- hydrogenation on the initial propane pres- sure described in Eq.
(l),and these 93 rate equations were eliminated.
The de- pendency of the initial rate on the initial pressure [Eq.
(l)] seemingly could be interpreted with the other 10 rate equations described below.

The initial rate of hydrogenation of propylene was, therefore,obtained by calculation from the difference between the initial slope of the pressure-time curve and the initial rate of cracking.
The initial rates thus obtained at constant pressures of propylene (15.5 Torr) were plotted against the initial pressures of hydrogen as shown in Fig. 7.

The adsorption equilibrium constants ob- tained from Figs. 8 and 9 are tabulated in Table 2. The adsorption equilibrium con- stants K1 = KI, Kz = KIV and Kz = KIII obtained independently from the dehydro- genation of propane or the hydrogenation of propylene agree within experimental error as shown in Table 2. This agreement shows that the dehydrogenation of propane over the Crz03-A120r&O catalyst pro- ceeds in reaction path E and the second step (II) of the path is the rate determining one.
The reaction mechanism proposed in- volves the adsorption of hydrogen molecule but not hydrogen atom. This mechanism may agree with the experimental results obtained by Burwell et al. (9) that the deuteration of cis- and trans-Zbutene over chromium oxide gel produced meso- and dl-butane-2,3-c&, respectively.
