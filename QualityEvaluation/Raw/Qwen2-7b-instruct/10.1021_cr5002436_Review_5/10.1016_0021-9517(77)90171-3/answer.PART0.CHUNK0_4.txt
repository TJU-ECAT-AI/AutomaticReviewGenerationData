The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions comprises four main steps: adsorption of a reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, subsequent activation or transformation of the molecule, reaction with another species (usually a hydrogen molecule), and desorption of the product. This mechanism has been widely studied for nearly a century due to its importance in petrochemical industries, particularly in processes like the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.

Regarding the ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting, studies have suggested that the adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface might be the rate-determining step. However, the specific step considered rate-limiting can vary based on factors like temperature, catalyst composition, and the nature of the reactant. 

The mechanism's continued interest and controversy stem from the complexity of dehydrogenation reactions, including the formation of various isomers and the reversibility of the process. Understanding the rate-determining step is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst design. Despite extensive research, the precise role of each step in controlling the reaction rate remains a subject of scientific inquiry.

The proposed mechanism suggests that hydrogen molecules play a key role in the reaction rather than hydrogen atoms. This aligns with experimental findings by Burwell et al., who observed deuteration patterns consistent with this mechanism when studying the dehydrogenation of butene over chromium oxide gel.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤：反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面，随后分子激活或转化，与另一种物种（通常为氢分子）反应，最后产物从表面脱附。由于其在石油化工行业中的重要性，特别是对于如烃类脱氢等过程，该机制自近一个世纪以来一直受到广泛研究。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的步骤的争论，研究表明，吸附反应物分子至催化剂表面可能是决定性的步骤。然而，被认定为决定性的步骤可能会根据温度、催化剂组成和反应物性质等因素而变化。

该机制持续吸引关注和争议的原因在于脱氢反应的复杂性，包括产物异构体的形成以及反应的可逆性。理解决定反应速率的步骤对于优化反应条件和催化剂设计至关重要。尽管进行了大量研究，但每个步骤在控制反应速率中的具体作用仍然是科学探究的主题。

提出的机制表明，氢分子在反应中扮演关键角色，而非氢原子。这与Burwell等人在研究铬氧化物凝胶上丁二烯脱氢实验时观察到的脱氘化模式一致。
