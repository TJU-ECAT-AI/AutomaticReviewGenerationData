The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a subject of scientific interest and controversy. It involves four main steps: adsorption of a molecule onto the catalyst surface, subsequent activation, decomposition of the molecule, and desorption of the resulting products. The mechanism has been widely studied for nearly a century. The ongoing debate revolves around identifying which of these steps is the rate-limiting one. Some researchers propose that the adsorption step might be the rate-determining step, while others suggest the decomposition step is more critical.

Despite extensive study, the mechanism remains a topic of interest due to its fundamental importance in petrochemical processes, particularly in the production of valuable hydrocarbon derivatives. The controversy over the rate-limiting step is crucial because it influences the efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation reactions. Understanding which step controls the reaction rate can guide the development of more effective catalysts and reaction conditions.

The agreement between the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and experimental results, such as those obtained by Burwell et al., provides evidence for the validity of this mechanism. Their findings support the hypothesis that the mechanism involves hydrogen molecule adsorption rather than hydrogen atom adsorption, aligning with the proposed mechanism.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，这是一个科学兴趣和争议的主题。它涉及四个主要步骤：分子吸附到催化剂表面、随后的活化、分子分解以及产物从表面脱附。该机制已被广泛研究近一个世纪。关于哪一步是决定速率的关键点的争论持续存在。一些研究人员提出吸附步骤可能是决定速率的关键点，而其他人则认为分解步骤更为关键。

尽管进行了大量研究，但该机制仍然是一个感兴趣的话题，因为它对石油化学过程中的重要性至关重要，特别是在生产有价值的烃衍生物方面。决定速率的关键步骤的争议影响了脱氢反应的效率和选择性。理解哪个步骤控制反应速率可以指导更有效的催化剂和反应条件的发展。

与Burwell等人的实验结果的一致性为这一机制的有效性提供了证据。他们的发现支持了这一假设，即机制涉及氢分子吸附而非氢原子吸附，与提出的机制相一致。
