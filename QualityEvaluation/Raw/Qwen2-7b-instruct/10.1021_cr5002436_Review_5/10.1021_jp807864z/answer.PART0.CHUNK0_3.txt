The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: activation, adsorption of reactants, reaction, and desorption of products. The debate over which step is rate-limiting remains unresolved. This mechanism is of significant scientific interest because it provides fundamental insights into catalysis. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the exact details of the mechanism continue to be refined.
