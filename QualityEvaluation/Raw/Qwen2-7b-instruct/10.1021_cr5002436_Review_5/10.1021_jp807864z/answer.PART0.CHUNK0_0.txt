[2] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism has been widely accepted as the fundamental reaction pathway for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[3] "It involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, (2) activation of the molecule, (3) migration of the activated species across the surface, and (4) desorption of the product molecule."
[4] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still open, with arguments supporting different steps depending on the specific conditions of the reaction."
[5] "This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because understanding its dynamics can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction pathways."
