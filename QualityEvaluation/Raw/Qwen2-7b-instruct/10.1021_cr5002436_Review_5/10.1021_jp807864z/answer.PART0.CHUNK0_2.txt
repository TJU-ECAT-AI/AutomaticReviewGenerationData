The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, which is a commonly recognized model for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, comprises four principal stages: the adsorption of propane molecules, the activation of hydrogen atoms, the cleavage of C-H bonds, and the subsequent desorption of propylene. The determination of the rate-limiting step within this mechanism is a subject of ongoing debate among researchers, with some proposing that the activation of hydrogen atoms might be the key factor, whereas others argue that the breaking of C-H bonds could be the deciding step. This mechanism continues to be of significant scientific interest due to its intricate nature and potential for enhancing the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes, even after nearly a century of investigation.

霍里图-波兰尼机制是一个广泛接受的模型，用于催化脱氢反应。该机制包括四个主要步骤：丙烷分子的吸附、氢原子的活化、C-H键的断裂以及随后丙烯的脱附。关于该机制中的决定性步骤的确定，研究人员之间仍存在争议，一些研究认为氢原子的活化可能是关键因素，而另一些研究则认为C-H键的断裂可能是决定性的。尽管经过近一个世纪的研究，霍里图-波兰尼机制仍然是科学界感兴趣的话题，其复杂性和提高脱氢过程效率的潜力使其继续受到关注。
