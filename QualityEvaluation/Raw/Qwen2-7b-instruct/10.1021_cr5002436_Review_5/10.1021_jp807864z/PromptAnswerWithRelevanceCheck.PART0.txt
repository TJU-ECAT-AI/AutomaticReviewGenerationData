[1] "The periodic density functional theory (DFT) study was conducted on propane dehydrogenation over a perfect Ga2O3(100) surface."
[2] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely accepted model for the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[3] "This mechanism consists of four main steps: adsorption of propane molecules, activation of hydrogen atoms, breaking of the C-H bonds, and desorption of propylene."
[4] "The debate regarding the rate-limiting step is still ongoing among researchers."
[5] "Some studies suggest that the activation of hydrogen atoms might be the rate-determining step, while others propose that the breaking of C-H bonds could be the limiting factor."
[6] "Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its complexity and potential for improving the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, which is a commonly recognized model for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, comprises four principal stages: the adsorption of propane molecules, the activation of hydrogen atoms, the cleavage of C-H bonds, and the subsequent desorption of propylene. The determination of the rate-limiting step within this mechanism is a subject of ongoing debate among researchers, with some proposing that the activation of hydrogen atoms might be the key factor, whereas others argue that the breaking of C-H bonds could be the deciding step. This mechanism continues to be of significant scientific interest due to its intricate nature and potential for enhancing the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes, even after nearly a century of investigation.
