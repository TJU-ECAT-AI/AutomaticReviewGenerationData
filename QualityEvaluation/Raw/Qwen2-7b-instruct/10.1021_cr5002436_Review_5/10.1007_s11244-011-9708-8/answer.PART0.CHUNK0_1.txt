<p>Propane promotes while hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke.</p>
<p>The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure.</p>
<p>The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces.</p>

1. The literature states that hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke, while propane promotes it. 
2. The rate of coke formation on the metal surface is influenced by propane pressure, not propylene or hydrogen pressures. The rate on the support is affected by both propane and propylene pressures, but decreases with hydrogen pressure. 
3. The literature proposes that the reaction between two strongly adsorbed C3H6*, formed by the dehydrogenation of propane, is the rate-limiting step in coke formation on the Pt surfaces.

1. 文献表明，氢抑制了芳香焦炭的形成，而丙烷则促进其形成。
2. 金属表面的焦炭生成速率受丙烷压力影响，而不受丙烯或氢气压力的影响。在支撑上，焦炭生成速率受丙烷和丙烯压力影响，但随着氢气压力的降低而减少。
3. 文献提出，在铂表面焦炭形成过程中，由丙烷脱氢形成的两个强烈吸附的C3H6*之间的反应是关键的速率限制步骤。
