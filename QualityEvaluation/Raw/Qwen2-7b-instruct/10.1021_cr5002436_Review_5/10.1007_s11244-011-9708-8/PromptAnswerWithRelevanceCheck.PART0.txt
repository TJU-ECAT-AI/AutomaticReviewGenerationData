[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."
[2] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces."

This study examines the influence of gas compositions on the rates of coke formation over a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst during propane dehydrogenation. The coke formed on the catalyst is characterized using thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Two types of coke are identified from the TPO profiles, with one attributed to the coke on the metal and the other to the coke on the support. The coke on the metal is found to contain more hydrogen than the coke on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases with propane pressure. Conversely, the rate of coke formation on the support increases with propane and propylene pressures and decreases with hydrogen pressure. A kinetic mechanism for coke formation is proposed, identifying the dimerization of adsorbed C3H6 as the kinetic relevant step for coke formation on the metal.

这项研究探讨了丙烷脱氢过程中PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上焦炭形成速率受气体组成的影响。通过热重分析、红外光谱、拉曼光谱和元素分析对催化剂上的焦炭进行了表征。从TPO图谱中识别出两种类型的焦炭，一种归因于金属上的焦炭，另一种归因于支持物上的焦炭。金属上的焦炭含氢量高于支持物上的焦炭。金属上焦炭的形成速率弱依赖于丙烯和氢的压力，但随着丙烷压力的增加而增加。相反，支持物上的焦炭形成速率随着丙烷和丙烯压力的增加而增加，并且随着氢气压力的降低而减少。提出了一个焦炭形成的动力学机制，将吸附的C3H6的二聚化识别为在铂表面焦炭形成的关键步骤。

1. The literature states that hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke, while propane promotes it. 
2. The rate of coke formation on the metal surface is influenced by propane pressure, not propylene or hydrogen pressures. The rate on the support is affected by both propane and propylene pressures, but decreases with hydrogen pressure. 
3. The literature proposes that the reaction between two strongly adsorbed C3H6*, formed by the dehydrogenation of propane, is the rate-limiting step in coke formation on the Pt surfaces.

The rate of coke formation on the metal is found dependent on the propane pressure (Fig. 9). The apparent reaction order is about 1.7 with respect to propane and zero reaction order with respect to hydrogen and propylene.
The rate of coke formation on the support increases with the propylene or propane pressures, while Fig. 8 shows that it decreases with the hydrogen pressure.
An apparent reaction order of 1.4 with respect to propane can not explain that propylene is the main precursor for coke formation, since the reaction order to propane is about one for propylene formation, and the reaction order to propylene is about one for coke formation.
</quotes>

Answer: The rate of coke formation on the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is influenced by the gas compositions, particularly propane, propylene, and hydrogen. The coke formed on the metal surface shows a weak dependence on hydrogen and propylene pressures, but increases significantly with the propane pressure. On the other hand, the coke formation rate on the support is enhanced by propylene and propane pressures but reduced by hydrogen pressure. The reaction order of 1.7 for coke formation on the metal with respect to propane suggests that two C3 intermediates are involved in the carbon formation process. However, the high H/C ratio of the coke indicates that the formation of C6H12* from two C3H6* intermediates is the kinetic relevant step. The presence of hydrogen affects the coke formation differently on the metal and support, with hydrogen reducing the rate of coke formation on the metal but having a negligible effect on the rate of coke formation on the support.

催化剂上铂锡/氧化铝上的焦炭形成速率受气体组成的影响，特别是丙烷、丙烯和氢气。金属表面形成的焦炭对氢气和丙烯压力的依赖性较弱，但随着丙烷压力的增加显著增加。另一方面，支持物上的焦炭形成速率在丙烯和丙烷压力下增加，但在氢气压力下减少。丙烷与金属表面上焦炭形成反应的1.7级表明涉及两个C3中间体的碳形成过程。然而，焦炭的高H/C比率表明从两个C3H6*中间体形成C6H12*是关键步骤。氢的存在以不同的方式影响金属和支持物上的焦炭形成，氢气减少了金属上的焦炭形成速率，但在支持物上对焦炭形成速率几乎没有影响。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule by breaking chemical bonds, deactivation of the activated molecule, and desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction pathway and the interplay between various kinetic processes. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact sequence and relative importance of these steps remain subjects of scientific interest and controversy. This is because the mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions is influenced by numerous factors, including the nature of the catalyst, the properties of the reactants, and the operating conditions. As a result, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest, as researchers continue to refine their understanding of the detailed kinetics and mechanisms of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面、通过断裂化学键激活分子、激活分子去活化以及产物分子从催化剂表面解吸。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论，是由于反应路径的复杂性和各种动力学过程之间的相互作用。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这些步骤的确切顺序和相对重要性仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。这是因为在催化剂的性质、反应物的属性和操作条件的影响下，脱氢反应机制变得复杂。因此，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是一个科学兴趣的话题，因为研究人员继续完善对催化脱氢反应详细动力学和机制的理解。

[1] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
[2] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
[3] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
[4] "The influences of reaction conditions, especially gas compositions, during propane dehydrogenation are seldom reported."
</quotes>

Answer: The literature focuses on the mechanism of coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation. It highlights the significance of understanding this mechanism, as it enables optimizing reaction conditions to minimize the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby enhancing propylene productivity. Moreover, knowledge of the mechanism aids in the rational design of catalysts that can reduce coke formation rates while preserving the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The study emphasizes the scarcity of research on how different gas compositions influence coke formation during propane dehydrogenation.

文献主要研究了丙烷裂解过程中铂或改性铂催化剂上焦炭形成的机制。它强调理解这种机制的重要性，因为它使我们能够优化反应条件，减少脱氢和再生周期的频率，从而提高丙烯产量。此外，了解该机制有助于合理设计催化剂，以降低焦炭形成速率的同时保持催化剂的活性和选择性。研究强调了在丙烷裂解过程中很少有关于不同气体组成如何影响焦炭形成的报道。
