[1] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces."
[2] "An apparent reaction order of 1.4 with respect to propane can not explain that propylene is the main precursor for coke formation, since the reaction order to propane is about one for propylene formation, and the reaction order to propylene is about one for coke formation."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface, activation of the molecule by breaking chemical bonds, deactivation of the activated molecule, and desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction pathway and the interplay between various kinetic processes. Despite nearly a century of study, the exact sequence and relative importance of these steps remain subjects of scientific interest and controversy. This is because the mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions is influenced by numerous factors, including the nature of the catalyst, the properties of the reactants, and the operating conditions. As a result, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest, as researchers continue to refine their understanding of the detailed kinetics and mechanisms of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括四个主要步骤：反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面、通过断裂化学键激活分子、激活分子去活化以及产物分子从催化剂表面解吸。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论，是由于反应路径的复杂性和各种动力学过程之间的相互作用。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这些步骤的确切顺序和相对重要性仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。这是因为在催化剂的性质、反应物的属性和操作条件的影响下，脱氢反应机制变得复杂。因此，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是一个科学兴趣的话题，因为研究人员继续完善对催化脱氢反应详细动力学和机制的理解。
