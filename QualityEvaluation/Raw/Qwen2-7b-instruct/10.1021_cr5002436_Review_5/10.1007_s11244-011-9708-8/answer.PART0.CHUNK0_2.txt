The rate of coke formation on the metal is found dependent on the propane pressure (Fig. 9). The apparent reaction order is about 1.7 with respect to propane and zero reaction order with respect to hydrogen and propylene.
The rate of coke formation on the support increases with the propylene or propane pressures, while Fig. 8 shows that it decreases with the hydrogen pressure.
An apparent reaction order of 1.4 with respect to propane can not explain that propylene is the main precursor for coke formation, since the reaction order to propane is about one for propylene formation, and the reaction order to propylene is about one for coke formation.

Answer: The rate of coke formation on the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is influenced by the gas compositions, particularly propane, propylene, and hydrogen. The coke formed on the metal surface shows a weak dependence on hydrogen and propylene pressures, but increases significantly with the propane pressure. On the other hand, the coke formation rate on the support is enhanced by propylene and propane pressures but reduced by hydrogen pressure. The reaction order of 1.7 for coke formation on the metal with respect to propane suggests that two C3 intermediates are involved in the carbon formation process. However, the high H/C ratio of the coke indicates that the formation of C6H12* from two C3H6* intermediates is the kinetic relevant step. The presence of hydrogen affects the coke formation differently on the metal and support, with hydrogen reducing the rate of coke formation on the metal but having a negligible effect on the rate of coke formation on the support.

催化剂上铂锡/氧化铝上的焦炭形成速率受气体组成的影响，特别是丙烷、丙烯和氢气。金属表面形成的焦炭对氢气和丙烯压力的依赖性较弱，但随着丙烷压力的增加显著增加。另一方面，支持物上的焦炭形成速率在丙烯和丙烷压力下增加，但在氢气压力下减少。丙烷与金属表面上焦炭形成反应的1.7级表明涉及两个C3中间体的碳形成过程。然而，焦炭的高H/C比率表明从两个C3H6*中间体形成C6H12*是关键步骤。氢的存在以不同的方式影响金属和支持物上的焦炭形成，氢气减少了金属上的焦炭形成速率，但在支持物上对焦炭形成速率几乎没有影响。
