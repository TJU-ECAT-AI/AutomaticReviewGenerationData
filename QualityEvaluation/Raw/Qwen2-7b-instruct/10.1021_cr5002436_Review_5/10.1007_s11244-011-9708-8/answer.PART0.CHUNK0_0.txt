[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."
[2] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces."

This study examines the influence of gas compositions on the rates of coke formation over a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst during propane dehydrogenation. The coke formed on the catalyst is characterized using thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Two types of coke are identified from the TPO profiles, with one attributed to the coke on the metal and the other to the coke on the support. The coke on the metal is found to contain more hydrogen than the coke on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases with propane pressure. Conversely, the rate of coke formation on the support increases with propane and propylene pressures and decreases with hydrogen pressure. A kinetic mechanism for coke formation is proposed, identifying the dimerization of adsorbed C3H6 as the kinetic relevant step for coke formation on the metal.

这项研究探讨了丙烷脱氢过程中PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上焦炭形成速率受气体组成的影响。通过热重分析、红外光谱、拉曼光谱和元素分析对催化剂上的焦炭进行了表征。从TPO图谱中识别出两种类型的焦炭，一种归因于金属上的焦炭，另一种归因于支持物上的焦炭。金属上的焦炭含氢量高于支持物上的焦炭。金属上焦炭的形成速率弱依赖于丙烯和氢的压力，但随着丙烷压力的增加而增加。相反，支持物上的焦炭形成速率随着丙烷和丙烯压力的增加而增加，并且随着氢气压力的降低而减少。提出了一个焦炭形成的动力学机制，将吸附的C3H6的二聚化识别为在铂表面焦炭形成的关键步骤。
