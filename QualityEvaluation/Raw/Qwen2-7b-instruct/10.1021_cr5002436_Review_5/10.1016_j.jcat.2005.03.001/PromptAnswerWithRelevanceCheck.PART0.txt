[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium and iron oxides, in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism [26,27]."
[2] "Since gallium oxide is hardly reduced and the redox cycle is irreverible under the reaction temperature according to the experimental results in this work, the redox mechanism is probably inapplicable for the reaction."
[3] "H2-TPR studies of the polymorphs of gallium oxide show that small reduction peaks appear in the TPR profiles of all of the samples above 200 C, indicating that small parts of the gallium oxides can be reduced by H2 at rather low temperature."
[4] "TPR and XPS results show that about 15 mol% of the fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C, but this part of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after reaction and O2 regeneration."
[5] "Dehydrogenation of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide in the presence or absence of CO2 was studied. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity, in both the presence and absence of CO2."
[6] "H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced (< 5 mol%) below 600 C, and the reduced gallium oxide is not restored after O2 regeneration."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the alkane substrate onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the alkane by breaking a hydrogen bond or other intermolecular interaction.
3. Formation of a reactive intermediate on the catalyst surface, often involving the abstraction of a hydrogen atom.
4. Conversion of the reactive intermediate to the desired product.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because of debates over which step is considered rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the activation step or the formation of the reactive intermediate is more critical. The exact nature of the rate-limiting step depends on factors such as the structure of the catalyst, the properties of the alkane, and the conditions of the reaction.

The mechanism continues to be of interest because it helps explain the selectivity and efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions, which are crucial for applications in the petrochemical industry. Understanding the details of the mechanism allows chemists to design more effective catalysts and optimize reaction conditions to achieve higher yields of desired products.

The debate about which step is rate-limiting is ongoing because different catalysts and reaction conditions can affect the relative rates of these steps. The mechanism also influences the development of new catalysts, as researchers seek to modify catalyst surfaces to enhance specific steps of the reaction pathway. This knowledge can lead to more efficient and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：
1. 将烷烃底物吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 通过破坏氢键或其他分子间相互作用激活烷烃。
3. 在催化剂表面上形成活性中间体，通常涉及抽取一个氢原子。
4. 将活性中间体转化为所需的产物。

由于近一个世纪的研究，这一机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的焦点，原因在于关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤存在争议。一些研究人员认为吸附步骤是速率限制步骤，而其他人则认为活化步骤或形成活性中间体更为关键。特定步骤的速率取决于催化剂结构、烷烃性质以及反应条件等因素。

该机制继续吸引关注，因为它有助于解释脱氢反应的选择性和效率，这对石油化工行业的应用至关重要。理解机制细节有助于化学家设计更有效的催化剂并优化反应条件以实现更高产率的产品。

关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤的辩论仍在进行，因为不同的催化剂和反应条件会影响这些步骤的相对速率。机制还影响新催化剂的开发，因为研究人员寻求修改催化剂表面以增强反应途径中的特定步骤。这方面的知识可以导致更高效和选择性更强的催化剂用于脱氢过程。

The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.
</quotes>

Answer: The dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes, including the process of converting propane to propene, is crucial due to the increasing demand for alkenes. Propene is vital for producing materials like polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. This reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat, necessitating a high temperature to achieve a high yield of propene. The elevated temperature tends to favor cracking reactions that produce coke and lighter alkanes, which reduces the product yield and accelerates catalyst deactivation.

催化脱氢将烷烃转化为相应的烯烃的过程越来越重要，这是由于对烯烃需求的增长。丙烯是生产聚丙烯、聚丙烯腈、丙烯酸和丙烯酸的重要原料。脱氢反应是吸热反应，需要较高的温度以获得较高的丙烯产率。高温有利于裂解反应产生焦炭和轻质烷烃，这导致产品产率下降并加速催化剂的失效。

Dehydrogenation of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide in the presence or absence of CO2 was studied. β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2. H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C. The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction.
