[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence or absence of CO2 over four polymorphs of gallium oxide was investigated."
[2] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."
[3] "The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."
[4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) activation of the substrate, (2) formation of an activated complex, (3) rearrangement of the activated complex, and (4) release of the product. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reactions and the interplay between different pathways. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the intricate nature of the reactions involved. The mechanism's relevance persists as researchers continue to explore the conditions under which different steps dominate, aiming to optimize catalytic processes for various applications.

对于催化脱氢反应，Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：（1）底物的活化，（2）形成活化复合物，（3）活化复合物的重排，以及（4）产物的释放。关于哪一步是决定性的步骤的争论，是因为反应的复杂性和不同途径之间的相互作用。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题，因为涉及的反应极其复杂。这一机制的适用性持续存在，因为研究人员继续探索在何种条件下不同的步骤占主导地位，旨在优化各种应用中的催化过程。

[1] "Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity, in both the presence and absence of CO2."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide in the absence of CO2 was studied at 500 C; the results are given in Table 1 and Fig. 2."
[3] "The propane dehydrogenation reaction was run on chromium oxide catalyst under the same conditions; the data are listed in Table 1 for comparison."

In the context of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, β-Ga2O3 displays the highest activity, both when CO2 is present or absent. This was observed at 500°C in the absence of CO2, as demonstrated in Tables 1 and Figure 2. When compared to chromium oxide catalysts under the same conditions, the specific activity of β-Ga2O3 was higher, as shown in Table 1.

在催化脱氢反应的背景下，β-Ga2O3表现出最高的活性，在CO2的存在与否下均如此。这在500°C下没有CO2的情况下被表1和图2所示结果证实。当与在相同条件下使用铬氧化物催化剂进行比较时，表1显示β-Ga2O3的特定活性更高。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The investigation focused on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over four polymorphs of gallium oxide, considering the presence or absence of CO2. The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 can likely be attributed to a significant number of surface medium-strong acid sites connected to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions and the interaction between protons and oxides.

研究集中在四种镓氧化物的四种多晶型上，考察丙烷在CO2的存在或不存在下转化为丙烯的催化脱氢作用。β-Ga2O3的高催化活性可能与表面大量中等强度酸性位点有关，这些位点与配合不饱和Ga3+离子相关联，并且介于质子和氧化物之间存在相互作用。
