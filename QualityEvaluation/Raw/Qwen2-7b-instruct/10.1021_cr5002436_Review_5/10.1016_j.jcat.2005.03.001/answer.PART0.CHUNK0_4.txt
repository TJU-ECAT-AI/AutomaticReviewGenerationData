[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium and iron oxides, in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism."
[2] "Since gallium oxide is hardly reduced and the redox cycle is irreverible under the reaction temperature according to the experimental results in this work, the redox mechanism is probably inapplicable for the reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: (1) the adsorption of the substrate molecule, (2) the activation of the substrate molecule through a chemical transformation, (3) the formation of the reactive intermediate, and (4) the desorption of the product. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting centers on whether it is the adsorption, activation, or the subsequent chemical transformations. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its complex nature and the difficulty in precisely identifying the rate-limiting step. This complexity arises from the interplay between kinetic and thermodynamic factors that influence the efficiency of each step in the reaction pathway.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：（1）底物分子的吸附，（2）通过化学转化激活底物分子，（3）形成活性中间体，和（4）产物的脱附。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的争论集中在吸附、活化或后续化学转化上。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但这一机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为它具有复杂性，并且难以精确识别反应途径中每个步骤的速率决定步骤。这种复杂性源自影响每个步骤效率的动力学和热力学因素之间的相互作用。

[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 occurs on gallium oxide, probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism."
[2] "The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions continues to be a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its intricate nature and the challenges in precisely determining the rate-limiting step. This mechanism involves four main steps: substrate molecule adsorption, activation of the substrate molecule through a chemical transformation, formation of the reactive intermediate, and desorption of the product. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting revolves around whether it is the adsorption, activation, or the subsequent chemical transformations. Despite extensive research, the mechanism remains uncertain due to the complex interplay between kinetic and thermodynamic factors influencing the efficiency of each step in the reaction pathway.

Regarding the high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3, it is likely associated with a surplus of surface medium-strong acid sites related to coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of protons and oxide. These features facilitate a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway for the dehydrogenation of propane, rather than following a redox mechanism.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制之所以仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，是因为它的复杂性以及确定速率决定步骤的挑战。该机制包括四个主要步骤：底物分子的吸附、通过化学转化激活底物分子、形成活性中间体，以及产物的脱附。关于哪个步骤是速率决定步骤的争论围绕吸附、活化或后续化学转化展开。尽管进行了大量研究，但由于动力学和热力学因素之间复杂的相互作用影响着反应途径中每个步骤的效率，因此机制仍然不确定。

对于β-Ga2O3的高催化活性，它很可能与表面中等强度酸位的过剩有关，这些酸位与配位不饱和Ga3+离子和质子与氧化物的共轭效应相关。这些特征促进了丙烷的异裂解反应途径，而不是遵循还原机制。
