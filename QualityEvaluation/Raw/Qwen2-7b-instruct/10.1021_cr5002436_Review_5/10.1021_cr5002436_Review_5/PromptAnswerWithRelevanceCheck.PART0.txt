[1] "The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is the most common explanation for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It follows Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, assuming all surface sites of the catalyst are identical. The mechanism comprises four steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both hydrogen and olefin. Both CH cleavage steps and dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been considered as potential rate-limiting steps. The debate around which step is truly rate-limiting continues due to the diverse materials that can act as catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

1.1934年提出的霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制是描述催化脱氢反应最常用的解释。它遵循兰缪尔-亨希尔伍德动力学，假设催化剂的所有表面位点都是相同的。该机制包含四个步骤：烷基的离解吸附、第二个氢原子的断裂、氢分子的形成，以及随后将氢和烯烃从催化剂表面释放。两个CH断裂步骤和烷基的离解吸附都被认为可能是脱氢反应的限速步骤。由于催化脱氢反应涉及不同类型的材料（如贵金属和过渡金属氧化物），关于哪一步真正是限速步骤的争论仍在继续。

[1] "Deactivation Pathway"
[2] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[3] "Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones."
[4] "For example, it would be beneficial to gain a fundamental understanding on the steps proposed in Schemes 4 and 5 to develop strategies to prevent coke formation through these routes."
</quotes>

Answer: The deactivation pathway of dehydrogenation catalysts is primarily caused by coke buildup. Coke accumulates on the catalyst surface, blocking both pores and active sites, which leads to a decline in catalytic activity. Coke can grow from aromatic rings through Diels-Alder addition, propylene addition to a radical, or by fusing smaller domains into larger ones. Understanding the steps outlined in Schemes 4 and 5 would be advantageous in devising strategies to prevent coke formation and mitigate its impact on catalyst performance.

1.催化剂失活的主要途径是由焦炭积聚引起的。焦炭在催化剂表面上积累，阻塞孔隙和活性位点，导致催化活性下降。焦炭可以从芳香环生长，通过迪尔斯-阿尔德添加、丙烯添加到自由基或通过将较小的区域融合成较大的区域。理解方案4和5中提出的过程步骤对开发防止焦炭形成并减轻其对催化剂性能影响的策略是有益的。

Dehydrogenation reactions are catalyzed by various materials, and the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is widely used to describe these reactions. This mechanism adheres to Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, assuming all catalyst surface sites are equivalent. It comprises four key stages: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, hydrogen molecule formation, and subsequent desorption of both hydrogen and olefin. Both CH cleavage steps and paraffin dissociative adsorption have been identified as potential rate-limiting steps. Isotopic labeling experiments help determine reaction intermediates, yet the reversible nature of the reaction complicates the interpretation of results due to isotopic scrambling.

脱氢反应由各种材料催化，霍里图-波兰尼机制在1934年被提出，广泛用于描述这些反应。该机制遵循兰缪尔-亨希尔伍德动力学，假设催化剂表面的所有位点都是等效的。它包含四个关键步骤：烷基的离解吸附、第二个氢原子的断裂、氢分子的形成，以及随后氢和烯烃的释放。两个CH断裂步骤和烷基的离解吸附被认为是脱氢反应的潜在限速步骤。同位素标记实验有助于确定反应中间体，但由于反应的平衡控制特性，导致同位素乱序，这使得结果的解释变得复杂。

This mechanism is based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, assuming identical surface sites on the catalyst. The debate around which step is rate-limiting continues, with both CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin being considered potential candidates. The equilibrium-controlled nature of the reaction complicates the identification of the rate-limiting step due to the reversible nature of the processes involved.

[3] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[4] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
</quotes>

Answer: The ongoing debate regarding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism centers on the identification of the rate-limiting step, with both the CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin being considered. The complexity and lack of complete understanding of the process of coke formation contribute to the scientific interest in this field. Coke buildup obstructs reactant diffusion to the catalyst surface, leading to a decline in catalytic efficiency.

详细解释了霍里图-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应的使用，该机制涉及四个关键步骤：烷基的离解吸附、第二个氢原子的CH断裂、氢分子的形成，以及随后氢和烯烃的释放。这一机制基于兰缪尔-希肖伍德动力学，假设催化剂表面的所有位点都是相同的。关于哪一步是速率决定步骤的争论仍在继续，因为CH断裂步骤和烷基的离解吸附都被认为可能是脱氢反应的速率决定步骤。由于脱氢反应是一个平衡控制的反应，化合物可以来回反应导致同位素乱序，这使实验结果的解释变得复杂。

值得注意的是，该机制在1934年由Horiuti和Polanyi提出，并且通常用来描述催化脱氢反应。它遵循兰缪尔-希肖伍德动力学，假设催化剂表面的所有位点相同。关于哪一步是速率决定步骤的争论仍在继续，因为CH断裂步骤和烷基的离解吸附都被认为可能是脱氢反应的速率决定步骤。由于脱氢反应是一个平衡控制的反应，化合物可以来回反应导致同位素乱序，这使实验结果的解释变得复杂。

脱氢反应过程的复杂性和难以完全理解导致了对这个领域的科学兴趣。焦炭的积累有效地阻碍了反应物向催化剂表面的扩散，阻塞了孔隙和活性位点，从而导致催化活性下降。
