[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
[2] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[3] "Several studies have been performed on Pt and PtSn catalysts to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "The exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides."
[5] "This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four primary steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both hydrogen and olefin. Both CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been proposed as potential rate-limiting steps. The mechanism's debate continues due to the reaction being catalyzed by diverse materials, including noble metals and transition metal oxides. Despite a century of research, the exact mechanism remains an area of scientific interest and controversy.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：烷烃的离散吸附、第二个氢原子的断裂、氢分子的形成，以及随后氢和烯烃的脱附。两个CH断裂步骤和烷烃的离散吸附被提议作为脱氢反应的限速步骤。由于该反应由不同材料（如贵金属和过渡金属氧化物）催化，其机制一直是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但确切的机制仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题。
