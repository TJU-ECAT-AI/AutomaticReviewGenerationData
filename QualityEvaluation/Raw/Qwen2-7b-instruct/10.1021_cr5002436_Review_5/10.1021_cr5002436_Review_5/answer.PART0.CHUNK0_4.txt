[1] "The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin."
[4] "Both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Several studies have been performed on Pt and PtSn catalysts to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, describes catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It follows Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, assuming identical surface sites on the catalyst. The mechanism comprises four steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both hydrogen and olefin. Both CH cleavage steps and dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been debated as potential rate-limiting steps. Studies on Pt and PtSn catalysts aim to elucidate the detailed mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions.

霍里图-波拉尼机制，提出于1934年，用于描述催化脱氢反应。它遵循兰缪尔-希肖伍德动力学，假设催化剂表面的所有位点都是相同的。该机制包含四个步骤：烷烃的离解吸附、第二个氢原子的断裂、氢分子的形成，以及随后同时释放氢和烯烃。两个CH断裂步骤和烷烃的离解吸附都被认为是脱氢反应速率决定步骤的候选者。对Pt和PtSn催化剂的研究旨在深入了解脱氢反应的详细机制。

[1] "The presence of Sn reduces the amount of highly active Pt step sites, on which reaction intermediates adsorb strongly."
[2] "The latter observation is rendered particularly noteworthy by the fact that isotopic labeling experiments, performed by Galvita et al. during ethane dehydrogenation, have revealed that ethylene can form methane and coke through cracking, the conversion proceeding via an ethylidyne intermediate."
[3] "Indeed, while heating Ga2O3 in an ethane atmosphere, the evolution of Ga-ethyl and hydroxyl surface species was observed by DRIFTS at 150 C."
[4] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[5] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."

Adding tin to the Pt catalyst decreases the quantity of highly active Pt step sites, where reaction intermediates strongly adhere. Galvita等人在乙烷脱氢过程中进行的同位素标记实验揭示，乙烯可以通过裂解形成甲烷和焦炭，转化过程通过乙基炔中间体进行。加热Ga2O3在乙烷气氛中，150°C时通过DRIFTS观察到Ga-乙基和羟基表面物种的产生。焦炭形成的机制非常复杂且不完全清楚。

添加锡到Pt催化剂中会减少高度活性的Pt步面位点的数量，反应中间体在这些位点上牢固吸附。Galvita等人在乙烷脱氢过程中进行的同位素标记实验显示，乙烯可以通过裂解形成甲烷和焦炭，转化过程通过乙基炔中间体进行。加热Ga2O3在乙烷气氛中，在150°C时通过DRIFTS观察到Ga-乙基和羟基表面物种的生成。焦炭形成的机制非常复杂且不完全清楚。
