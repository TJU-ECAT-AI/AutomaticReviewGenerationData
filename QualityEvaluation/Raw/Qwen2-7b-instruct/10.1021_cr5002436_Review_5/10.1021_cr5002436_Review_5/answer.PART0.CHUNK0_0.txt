[1] "The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
[4] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "The exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalized by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is the most common explanation for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It follows Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, assuming all surface sites of the catalyst are identical. The mechanism comprises four steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both hydrogen and olefin. Both CH cleavage steps and dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been considered as potential rate-limiting steps. The debate around which step is truly rate-limiting continues due to the diverse materials that can act as catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

1.1934年提出的霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制是描述催化脱氢反应最常用的解释。它遵循兰缪尔-亨希尔伍德动力学，假设催化剂的所有表面位点都是相同的。该机制包含四个步骤：烷基的离解吸附、第二个氢原子的断裂、氢分子的形成，以及随后将氢和烯烃从催化剂表面释放。两个CH断裂步骤和烷基的离解吸附都被认为可能是脱氢反应的限速步骤。由于催化脱氢反应涉及不同类型的材料（如贵金属和过渡金属氧化物），关于哪一步真正是限速步骤的争论仍在继续。

[1] "Deactivation Pathway"
[2] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[3] "Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones."
[4] "For example, it would be beneficial to gain a fundamental understanding on the steps proposed in Schemes 4 and 5 to develop strategies to prevent coke formation through these routes."

Answer: The deactivation pathway of dehydrogenation catalysts is primarily caused by coke buildup. Coke accumulates on the catalyst surface, blocking both pores and active sites, which leads to a decline in catalytic activity. Coke can grow from aromatic rings through Diels-Alder addition, propylene addition to a radical, or by fusing smaller domains into larger ones. Understanding the steps outlined in Schemes 4 and 5 would be advantageous in devising strategies to prevent coke formation and mitigate its impact on catalyst performance.

1.催化剂失活的主要途径是由焦炭积聚引起的。焦炭在催化剂表面上积累，阻塞孔隙和活性位点，导致催化活性下降。焦炭可以从芳香环生长，通过迪尔斯-阿尔德添加、丙烯添加到自由基或通过将较小的区域融合成较大的区域。理解方案4和5中提出的过程步骤对开发防止焦炭形成并减轻其对催化剂性能影响的策略是有益的。
