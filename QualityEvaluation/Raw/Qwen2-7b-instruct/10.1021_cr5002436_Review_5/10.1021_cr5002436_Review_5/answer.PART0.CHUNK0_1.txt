[1] "The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
[4] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Isotopic labeling experiments have been used to identify the reaction intermediates."
[6] "Because the dehydrogenation reaction is an equilibrium-controlled reaction, compounds can react back and forth leading to isotopic scrambling, which complicates the interpretation of experimental results."

Dehydrogenation reactions are catalyzed by various materials, and the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is widely used to describe these reactions. This mechanism adheres to Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, assuming all catalyst surface sites are equivalent. It comprises four key stages: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, hydrogen molecule formation, and subsequent desorption of both hydrogen and olefin. Both CH cleavage steps and paraffin dissociative adsorption have been identified as potential rate-limiting steps. Isotopic labeling experiments help determine reaction intermediates, yet the reversible nature of the reaction complicates the interpretation of results due to isotopic scrambling.

脱氢反应由各种材料催化，霍里图-波兰尼机制在1934年被提出，广泛用于描述这些反应。该机制遵循兰缪尔-亨希尔伍德动力学，假设催化剂表面的所有位点都是等效的。它包含四个关键步骤：烷基的离解吸附、第二个氢原子的断裂、氢分子的形成，以及随后氢和烯烃的释放。两个CH断裂步骤和烷基的离解吸附被认为是脱氢反应的潜在限速步骤。同位素标记实验有助于确定反应中间体，但由于反应的平衡控制特性，导致同位素乱序，这使得结果的解释变得复杂。
