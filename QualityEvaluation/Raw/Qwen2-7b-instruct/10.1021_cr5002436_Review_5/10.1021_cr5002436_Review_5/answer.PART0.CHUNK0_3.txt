[1] "The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin."
[4] "Both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Because the dehydrogenation reaction is an equilibrium-controlled reaction, compounds can react back and forth leading to isotopic scrambling, which complicates the interpretation of experimental results."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, proposed in 1934, involves four key steps: the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both hydrogen and olefin. This mechanism is based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, assuming identical surface sites on the catalyst. The debate around which step is rate-limiting continues, with both CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin being considered potential candidates. The equilibrium-controlled nature of the reaction complicates the identification of the rate-limiting step due to the reversible nature of the processes involved.

[3] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[4] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."

Answer: The ongoing debate regarding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism centers on the identification of the rate-limiting step, with both the CH cleavage steps and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin being considered. The complexity and lack of complete understanding of the process of coke formation contribute to the scientific interest in this field. Coke buildup obstructs reactant diffusion to the catalyst surface, leading to a decline in catalytic efficiency.

详细解释了霍里图-波兰尼机制对于催化脱氢反应的使用，该机制涉及四个关键步骤：烷基的离解吸附、第二个氢原子的CH断裂、氢分子的形成，以及随后氢和烯烃的释放。这一机制基于兰缪尔-希肖伍德动力学，假设催化剂表面的所有位点都是相同的。关于哪一步是速率决定步骤的争论仍在继续，因为CH断裂步骤和烷基的离解吸附都被认为可能是脱氢反应的速率决定步骤。由于脱氢反应是一个平衡控制的反应，化合物可以来回反应导致同位素乱序，这使实验结果的解释变得复杂。

值得注意的是，该机制在1934年由Horiuti和Polanyi提出，并且通常用来描述催化脱氢反应。它遵循兰缪尔-希肖伍德动力学，假设催化剂表面的所有位点相同。关于哪一步是速率决定步骤的争论仍在继续，因为CH断裂步骤和烷基的离解吸附都被认为可能是脱氢反应的速率决定步骤。由于脱氢反应是一个平衡控制的反应，化合物可以来回反应导致同位素乱序，这使实验结果的解释变得复杂。

脱氢反应过程的复杂性和难以完全理解导致了对这个领域的科学兴趣。焦炭的积累有效地阻碍了反应物向催化剂表面的扩散，阻塞了孔隙和活性位点，从而导致催化活性下降。
