1. Two closely related p-adsorbed ethene species were identified with absorptions at 3022 and 3016 cm1, respectively. Another pair of adsorbed species, designated di-r* and di-r, were detected with absorptions at 2922, 2830, and 1428 cm1, respectively.

2. A shoulder to the 2922/2906 cm1 di-r*/di-r absorptions at ca. 2958 cm1 was tentatively attributed to another mode of the p-adsorbed species. This could also be attributed to an ethyl group.

3. The 2958 cm1 shoulder was tentatively attributed to another mode of the p-adsorbed species. A less-preferred alternative was an ethyl surface group formed from adsorbed ethene and hydrogen retained by the catalyst.

4. Adsorption of residual CO in the vacuum line caused strong negative absorptions at ca. 2087 cm1 and weaker absorptions at ca. 2060, 2040, 1880, and 1840 cm1.

5. The di-r species was gradually replaced by new absorptions at 2883, 2795, and 1342 cm1 between 206 and 294 K, attributed to the ethylidyne species on triangular adsorption sites of [111] faces.

1. 两种紧密相关的p-吸附乙烯物种被识别，其吸收峰分别位于3022和3016 cm1。另外一对吸附物种，标记为di-r*和di-r，被检测到具有吸收峰在2922、2830和1428 cm1，分别。

2. 2922/2906 cm1 di-r*/di-r吸收峰在约2958 cm1处的肩峰被初步归因于p-吸附物种的另一个模式。这也可以归因于乙基团。

3. 2958 cm1肩峰被初步归因于p-吸附物种的另一个模式。一个不太可能的替代解释是形成自吸附乙烯和催化剂保留的氢的乙基表面组。

4. 在真空线中残留的CO吸附导致强烈的负吸收在约2087 cm1，并且较弱的吸收在2060、2040、1880和1840 cm1。

5. 在206至294 K之间，di-r物种逐渐被新吸收峰取代，这些吸收峰位于2883、2795和1342 cm1，归因于位于[111]面三角吸附位点上的乙炔物种。
