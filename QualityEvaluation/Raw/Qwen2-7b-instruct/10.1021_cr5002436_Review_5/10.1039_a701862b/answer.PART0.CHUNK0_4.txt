[1] "In a related study of the adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethene on a catalyst with smaller metal particles (\2 nm) Pt/Al2O3 between 140 K and ambient temperature, the same conclusions were drawn by Mohsin et al.70 for the di-r to ethylidyne conversion on [111] facets, but the second set of di-r* bands at 2922, 2830 and 1428 cm1 were not observed."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the substrate molecule by breaking a bond through the influence of the catalyst.
3. Formation of a reactive intermediate species.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The ongoing debate centers around which step is considered rate-limiting. The specific details of the mechanism, including the intermediates involved and the precise bond-breaking and formation processes, continue to be refined and debated by researchers. This mechanism is particularly important in the field of catalysis as it provides insights into the fundamental chemical transformations that occur during dehydrogenation reactions.

In the context of the document, the di-r*/di-r species refers to adsorbed ethene complexes on the catalyst surface. The conversion of these species to ethylidyne species is observed at elevated temperatures. The document notes that the presence of a shoulder at approximately 2958 cm^-1 in the IR spectrum suggests an additional mode of the p-adsorbed ethene species. This mode is tentatively attributed to a surface group that is formed from adsorbed ethene and hydrogen retained by the catalyst. However, there are spectroscopic reasons that prevent this absorption from being attributed to an ethylidene species, despite its close similarity in band position. The document also discusses the possibility of the di-r* species arising from ethylylidyne, but this is considered less likely.

The interest in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism stems from its relevance to understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The detailed study of these reactions can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts and processes for industrial applications, such as the production of fuels and chemicals. The continued research and refinement of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism contribute to advancements in the field of catalysis and chemical engineering.

在相关研究中，Mohsin等人对尺寸较小的铂/氧化铝催化剂（\2 nm）上乙烯脱氢反应的吸附和脱氢化过程进行了研究，在140 K至环境温度之间，他们得出了与111晶面相关的二r到乙基烯的转换相同的结论，但观察到了第二组二r*带（2922、2830和1428 cm1）。指定为二r*谱的起源不太可能是乙基二烯物种。

文档指出，尽管存在肩峰（大约2958 cm1），其归因于p-吸附乙烯物种的另一个模式。这个波段较不优先的分配可能是由形成自吸附乙烯和由催化剂保留的氢的表面组分。然而，存在光谱学原因，阻止将这种吸收归因于乙基二烯物种，尽管其波长位置相近。文档还讨论了二r*物种可能起源于乙基二烯，但这种情况的可能性较低。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于理解催化脱氢反应的基本化学转化具有重要意义。它提供了关于这些反应中发生的特定中间体和精确的键断裂和形成过程的见解。该机制对于催化领域尤为重要，因为它为工业应用的发展（如燃料和化学品生产）提供了更高效催化剂和过程的机会。对Horiuti-Polanyi机制的持续研究和细化促进了催化和化学工程领域的进步。

文档中的兴趣点在于Horiuti-Polanyi机制如何解释催化脱氢化反应的四个主要步骤：1. 物质分子在催化剂表面的吸附；2. 在催化剂的影响下，通过打破键激活物质分子；3. 形成活性中间物种；4. 产品分子从催化剂表面脱附。尽管近一个世纪的研究，Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界的热点和争议话题。争论的核心集中在哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤。机制的具体细节，包括涉及的中间体以及精确的键断裂和形成过程，仍在研究人员之间进行辩论和改进。

文档讨论了在低温下观察到的二r*/二r物种转化为乙基烯物种的现象。这些物种在高温下被观察到。文档指出，在红外光谱中存在一个肩峰（大约2958 cm^-1），建议该模式是p-吸附乙烯物种的额外模式。这一模式被暂时归因于由吸附乙烯和由催化剂保留的氢形成的表面组分。然而，存在光谱学原因，阻止将这种吸收归因于乙基二烯物种，尽管其波长位置相近。文档还讨论了二r*物种可能起源于乙基二烯的可能性，但这种情况的可能性较低。
