[1] "In a related study of the adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethene on a catalyst with smaller metal particles (\2 nm) Pt/Al2O3 between 140 K and ambient temperature, the same conclusions were drawn by Mohsin et al.70 for the di-r to ethylidyne conversion on [111] facets, but the second set of di-r* bands at 2922, 2830 and 1428 cm1 were not observed."
[2] "In that case only a single complex and a single di-r p-C2H4 species absorbing at 3073/3018/2998/2955/1498 cm1"
[3] "Moreover, the lower wavenumber transmission also allowed identification of the Al2O3 other coupled mode of the complex l(CxC)/d(CH2) p-C2H4 at 1203 cm1, and of the totally symmetrical l(CwC) mode at 1128 cm1 of ethylidyne."
[4] "The continuing occurrence of the di-r* (or ethylylidine) complex on our catalyst at ambient temperature possibly reflects the presence of more and larger crystalline facets with sections of non-[111] morphology on the larger platinum particles."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the molecule by breaking the hydrogen-hydrogen bond through interaction with the catalyst.
3. Formation of an intermediate species, often involving the creation of a carbocation or a similar reactive intermediate.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often focuses on the activation step, as it requires significant energy input and can thus slow down the overall reaction rate. However, the entire sequence of steps contributes to the overall reaction kinetics and efficiency. 

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because it provides a framework for understanding how catalytic dehydrogenation reactions proceed. The specifics of the mechanism, including the role of intermediates and the precise nature of the catalytic site, continue to be refined and debated. Additionally, the mechanism helps explain why certain catalyst materials and conditions lead to more efficient dehydrogenation processes, which is crucial for applications in industries such as petrochemical production and fuel processing. The mechanism's complexity and the influence of various factors like temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties make it a rich area of research that continues to evolve with advances in theoretical chemistry and experimental techniques.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 通过与催化剂的相互作用，打破氢-氢键来激活分子。
3. 形成中间物种，通常涉及创建碳正离子或类似反应性中间体。
4. 从催化剂表面释放产物分子。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性的，争论往往集中在激活步骤上，因为它需要大量的能量输入，并可能导致整个反应速率减慢。然而，整个序列的步骤对整体反应动力学和效率都有贡献。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制之所以仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的主题，尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，是因为它为理解催化脱氢反应的进行方式提供了一个框架。机制的具体细节，包括中间体的作用和催化位点的性质，仍在不断细化和辩论中。此外，机制帮助解释了为什么某些催化剂材料和条件导致更高效的脱氢过程，这对于石油化学生产和燃料加工等行业至关重要。机制的复杂性和各种因素（如温度、压力和催化剂性质）的影响使它是一个不断发展的研究领域，随着理论化学和实验技术的进步而不断演变。
