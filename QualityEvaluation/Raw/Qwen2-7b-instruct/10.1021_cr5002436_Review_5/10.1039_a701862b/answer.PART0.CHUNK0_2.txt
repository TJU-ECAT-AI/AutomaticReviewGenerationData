[1] "In a related study of the adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethene on a catalyst with smaller metal particles (\2 nm) Pt/Al2O3 between 140 K and ambient temperature, the same conclusions were drawn by Mohsin et al.70 for the di-r to ethylidyne conversion on [111] facets, but the second set of di-r* bands at 2922, 2830 and 1428 cm1 were not observed."
[2] "The continuing occurrence of the di-r* (or ethylylidine) complex on our catalyst at ambient temperature possibly reflects the presence of more and larger crystalline facets with sections of non-[111] morphology on the larger platinum particles."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: 
1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the molecule through breaking of bonds and formation of an intermediate species.
3. Formation of the product molecule from the activated species.
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting often centers around the activation step, as it requires significant energy input and thus affects the overall reaction rate. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of the catalytic process, the influence of various reaction conditions, and the intricate interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and products.

The presence of di-r* bands at 2922, 2830, and 1428 cm1 in the IR spectra suggests the existence of a di-r complex on the catalyst surface. At ambient temperature, these di-r complexes convert into ethylidyne species, which are known to occur on [111] surface facets. The continued presence of the di-r* complex implies the existence of more and larger crystalline facets with non-[111] morphology on the larger platinum particles.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤：
1. 反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面。
2. 分子通过断裂键和形成中间物种而被激活。
3. 从激活物种形成产物分子。
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论通常集中在激活步骤上，因为它需要大量的能量输入，从而影响整个反应速率。尽管该机制在近一个世纪的研究中仍然是科学界关注和争议的焦点，原因在于催化过程的复杂性、各种反应条件的影响以及催化剂、反应物和产物之间复杂的相互作用。

在红外光谱中检测到的2922、2830和1428 cm1的di-r谱带表明存在一个di-r复合物在催化剂表面上。在室温下，这些di-r复合物转化为已知在[111]表面特征上发生的乙基烯类物种。继续存在di-r*复合物意味着存在更多和更大的具有非[111]形态的结晶面的大铂颗粒上的复合物。
