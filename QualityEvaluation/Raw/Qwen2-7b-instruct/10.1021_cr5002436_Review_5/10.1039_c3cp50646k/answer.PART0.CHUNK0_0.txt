[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely accepted theory that describes the process of converting a hydrocarbon to an alkene."
[2] "The mechanism involves four main steps: adsorption of the hydrocarbon onto the catalyst surface, activation of the hydrocarbon by breaking a hydrogen-hydrocarbon bond, dehydrogenation of the hydrocarbon, and desorption of the alkene from the catalyst surface."
[3] "There is ongoing debate among scientists regarding which step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is considered rate-limiting."
[4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy."
