[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely accepted theory that describes the process of converting a hydrocarbon to an alkene."
[2] "The mechanism involves four main steps: adsorption of the hydrocarbon onto the catalyst surface, activation of the hydrocarbon by breaking a hydrogen-hydrocarbon bond, dehydrogenation of the hydrocarbon, and desorption of the alkene from the catalyst surface."
[3] "There is ongoing debate among scientists regarding which step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is considered rate-limiting."
[4] "Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism explains the catalytic dehydrogenation process, involving four steps: adsorption, activation, dehydrogenation, and desorption. The rate-limiting step is debated among researchers, and the mechanism continues to intrigue scientists despite extensive study over almost a century.

[1] "The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the catalyst performance and decreases the formation of coke deposits, as was revealed by 10 thermogravimetrical analysis."
[2] "It was found that the addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the conversion of propane."
[3] "The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles."
[4] "For the tenth cycle, the selectivity to propene is 43% for the 100% propane feed and 73% for the feed containing 50% propane."
[5] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability, meaning it decreases the drop in conversion between cycles."
[6] "The corresponding intensity, band position and bandwidth of the different Raman features, it was determined that smaller graphite crystallites, which have less defects, are formed when the partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed was increased."
[7] "First of all, the presence of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane."
[8] "Secondly, the Raman bands become narrower, which suggest a more ordered system with less defects."
[9] "Finally, the D1/G ratio increases as the H2 concentration in the feed increases."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a widely accepted explanation for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It comprises four primary steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface.
2. Activation of the molecule through breaking of chemical bonds by the catalyst.
3. Diffusion of the activated molecule across the catalyst surface to a reaction site.
4. Reaction at the active site to produce the desired product, followed by desorption of the product from the catalyst surface.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and debate due to the lack of consensus on which of these steps is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the adsorption step is rate-limiting, while others propose that it is the diffusion of the activated molecule or the reaction itself. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the precise details and rate-determining step of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continue to be areas of active research and discussion in the field of catalysis.

霍里图-波拉尼机制是催化脱氢反应的广泛接受解释。它包含四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附。
2. 催化剂通过断裂化学键激活分子。
3. 激活分子在催化剂表面上扩散至反应位点。
4. 在活性位点进行反应生成所需产物，随后产物从催化剂表面脱附。

霍里图-波拉尼机制仍然是科学研究领域中的一个热点问题和争议话题，因为关于这些步骤中哪个是速率决定步骤没有共识。一些研究人员认为吸附步骤是速率决定步骤，而其他人则提出可能是激活分子的扩散或反应本身。尽管在过去近一个世纪的研究中，霍里图-波拉尼机制的精确细节和速率决定步骤仍然是催化领域中的活跃研究和讨论焦点。
