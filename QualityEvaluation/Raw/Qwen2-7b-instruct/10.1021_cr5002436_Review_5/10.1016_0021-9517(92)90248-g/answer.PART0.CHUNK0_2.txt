The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is a topic of scientific interest and controversy. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a subject of discussion. The mechanism includes the conversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species i-C4H9I to chemisorbed isobutene i-C4H8/and the reverse. This process is believed to be the rate-controlling step. The reaction can be modeled using transient isotopic tracing with 13C marking for the system isobutane-isobutene-hydrogen over a chromia catalyst. The mechanism provides insights into the catalytic properties of chromia and helps predict the performance of the catalyst.

The main purpose of the present study is to demonstrate that a reversible reaction can be well modeled using transient tracing regardless of how overall kinetics may be correlated. The study uses several different types of experiments as well as an improved statistical treatment of the data. Evidence is presented for the existence of a dual-site mechanism for isobutane dehydrogenation with a single rate-controlling step involving interconversion of i-C4H9l and i-C4H8/.

The results provide further corroboration of the theory and offer evidence that the system was operating at isothermal conditions. The study also highlights the importance of using transient isotopic tracing for understanding complex reversible heterogeneous catalytic reactions. The findings contribute to the development of improved catalysts based on knowledge of factors controlling slow steps and the construction of kinetic rate equations with more than an empirical basis.

The scientific interest in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism stems from its ability to explain the relative reactivity of terminal and secondary hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbons over chromia catalysts. The mechanism considers the activation energy required to change the tetrahedral (i-C4Hgl) structure to the planar (i-C4H91) form as an important factor in the rate of the step. The controversy regarding the rate-limiting step arises from the complexity of the reaction pathways and the influence of various factors such as surface concentrations of adsorbed species and the shapes of the hydrocarbon molecules.

The precise determination of parameters through the use of transient isotopic tracing offers valuable insights into the catalytic properties of chromia and supports the development of improved catalysts. The small estimated standard deviations reported in Tables 5 and 6 indicate that the parameters are determined with a high degree of precision, contributing to the reliability of the model. The findings support the use of transient tracing as a powerful tool for accessing fundamental parameters in heterogeneous catalytic systems and provide a clearer understanding of the complex reversible catalytic reactions.

该论文中，Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是一个讨论的主题。该机制包括将半氢化化学吸附物种i-C4H9I转换为化学吸附异丁烯i-C4H8/以及反向过程。认为这是控制速率的步骤。通过使用13C标记的瞬态同位素追踪技术，可以对异丁烷-异丁烯-氢系统在氧化铝催化剂上的反应进行建模。

研究的主要目的是证明，无论整体动力学如何相关联，可逆反应都可以通过瞬态追踪很好地建模。使用几种不同的实验类型以及对数据的改进统计处理方法。提出了异丁烷脱氢化存在双位点机制的证据，其中单个控制速率的步骤涉及i-C4H9l和i-C4H8/之间的互换。

结果提供了进一步验证理论的证据，并提供了系统在等温条件下运行的证据。研究还强调了使用瞬态同位素追踪理解复杂可逆异相催化反应的重要性。这些发现有助于基于控制缓慢步骤的知识开发改进的催化剂，并构建具有超过经验基础的反应速率方程。

该机制对氢原子在铬酸盐催化剂上不同活性的相对反应性的解释引起了科学界的兴趣。机制考虑了将四面体（i-C4Hgl）结构转变为平面（i-C4H91）形式所需的激活能作为影响速率步骤的重要因素。速率限制步骤的争议源自反应途径的复杂性和各种因素的影响，如吸附物种表面浓度和碳氢化合物分子的形状。

通过使用瞬态同位素追踪精确确定参数提供有价值的见解，支持铬氧化物的催化性质，并支持改进催化剂的发展。表5和6中报告的参数的极小估计标准偏差表明，参数的确定具有高度的精度，从而增强了模型的可靠性。这些发现支持瞬态追踪作为一种强大工具的作用，用于访问异相催化系统的基本参数，并提供了对复杂可逆催化反应的更清晰理解。
