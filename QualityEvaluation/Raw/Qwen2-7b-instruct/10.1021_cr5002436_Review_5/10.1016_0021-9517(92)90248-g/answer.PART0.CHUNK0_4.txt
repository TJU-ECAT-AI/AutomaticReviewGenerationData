The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation process of isobutane. It comprises four key steps:

1. **Conversion of i-C4H10**: This involves the addition of hydrogen to isobutane to form the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species, i-C4H9/.

2. **Formation of i-C4H9**/**i-C4H8**: The half-hydrogenated species then undergoes a reaction with another hydrogen molecule to produce the fully hydrogenated isobutene, i-C4H8.

3. **Decomposition of i-C4H8**: The fully hydrogenated isobutene then decomposes back into hydrogen and the isobutene molecule.

4. **Reverse Reaction**: There is also a reverse process where hydrogen combines with isobutene to regenerate the half-hydrogenated species.

The mechanism suggests that a single rate-limiting step exists in this reversible catalytic process, involving the interconversion between the half-hydrogenated species i-C4H9 and the fully hydrogenated isobutene i-C4H8. This finding supports the use of transient isotopic tracing techniques in elucidating the dynamics and identifying the rate-limiting step in complex heterogeneous reactions, thereby providing insights for catalyst design and performance prediction.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its implications on understanding the kinetics of reversible catalytic reactions, especially when dealing with non-metallic catalysts. The identification of a single rate-limiting step is crucial for optimizing catalyst efficiency and enhancing reaction rates, which is essential for various industrial applications such as petrochemical processing and organic synthesis. Despite decades of study, the precise role of each step in the mechanism and the specific conditions under which they operate as rate-limiting steps continue to be subjects of ongoing research and debate.

该霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了异丁烷的催化脱氢过程。它包括四个关键步骤：

1. **i-C4H10的转化**：涉及将异丁烷与氢分子结合形成半氢化吸附物种i-C4H9。

2. **i-C4H9/i-C4H8的形成**：半氢化物种随后与另一个氢分子反应生成完全氢化的异丁烯，i-C4H8。

3. **i-C4H8的分解**：完全氢化的异丁烯随后分解回氢和异丁烯分子。

4. **逆反应**：氢与异丁烯结合以再生半氢化物种。

机制表明，在这种可逆催化过程中存在单一的速率控制步骤，涉及半氢化物种i-C4H9与完全氢化异丁烯i-C4H8之间的相互转换。这一发现支持使用瞬态同位素追踪技术来阐明复杂异质反应的动力学，并识别出速率控制步骤，从而为催化剂设计和性能预测提供了见解。

这一机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它对理解可逆催化反应的机理具有重要意义，尤其是在处理非金属催化剂时。确定单一的速率限制步骤对于优化催化剂效率和提高反应速率至关重要，这对于诸如石油化学加工和有机合成等工业应用来说非常重要。尽管已经进行了数十年的研究，但每一步在机制中的确切作用以及它们作为速率限制步骤的具体条件仍然是正在进行研究和辩论的主题。
