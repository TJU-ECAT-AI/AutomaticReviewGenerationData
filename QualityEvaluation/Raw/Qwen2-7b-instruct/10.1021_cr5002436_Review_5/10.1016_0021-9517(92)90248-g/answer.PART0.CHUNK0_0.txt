[1] "A statistical approach is employed for modeling the simultaneous occurrence of traced isobutane and isobutene in the product stream using the Horiuti-Polanyi, mechanism."
[2] "The overall re- action is i-C4Hr0 = i-C4H8 + H2."
[3] "It consists of the following elementary steps:i-C4H10 + 2l - i-C4H9/+ HI (9) i-C4H91 + l - i-C4H8/+ HI (10) i-C4H81 --- i-C4H 8 + l (11)"
[4] "Such information should be useful for catalyst design and prediction of performance."
[5] "Whether a single rate-controlling step exists in complex reversible heterogeneous catalytic reac- tions is difficult to establish, especially with non-metallic catalysts, which often possess fewer active sites than supported metals."
[6] "In our study we assumed the well-known Horiuti-Polanyi (10) mechanism involving the half-hydrogenated state."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a model used to explain the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane. It consists of four main steps. Initially, isobutane (i-C4H10) reacts with two hydrogen atoms (HI) to form a half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9+). Then, one of these hydrogen atoms migrates to form another half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9-). Afterward, the remaining hydrogen atom migrates to produce a fully hydrogenated species (i-C4H8+). Finally, this species loses a hydrogen atom to form isobutene (i-C4H8). The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still a topic of scientific interest. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a focus of research because it helps in understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions, which is crucial for catalyst design and improving performance predictions.

霍里图-波兰尼机制用于解释异丁烷的催化脱氢。它包含四个主要步骤。首先，异丁烷（i-C4H10）与两个氢原子（HI）反应形成半氢化物种（i-C4H9+）。然后，一个氢原子迁移形成另一个半氢化物种（i-C4H9-）。之后，剩余的氢原子迁移产生一个完全氢化的物种（i-C4H8+）。最后，这个物种失去一个氢原子形成异丁烯（i-C4H8）。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的争论仍然是科学研究的主题。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但该机制仍然是研究的重点，因为它有助于理解脱氢反应的动力学和机制，这对于催化剂设计和提高性能预测至关重要。
