          [1] "The reactions studied are reversible."
          [2] "Whether a single rate-controlling step exists in complex reversible heterogeneous catalytic reac- tions is difficult to establish, especially with non-metallic catalysts, which often possess fewer active sites than supported metals."
          [3] "We find that a single rate-controlling step that consists of the conversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species i-C4H9I to chemisorbed isobutene i-C4H8/and the reverse exists."
          [4] "Such information should be useful for catalyst design and prediction of performance."
          [5] "The overall re- action is i-C4Hr0 = i-C4H8 + H2."
          [6] "It consists of the following elementary steps:i-C4H10 + 2l - i-C4H9/+ HI (9) i-C4H91 + l - i-C4H8/+ HI (10) i-C4H81 --- i-C4H 8 + l (11)"
          [7] "The molecular species involved when 13C is used as a tracer are i- C4Hlo, i-C4H9/,i-C4H8/,and i-C4H 8 ."
          [8] "For this reaction both hydrogenation and dehy- drogenation may be conveniently con- ducted at a temperature near 623 K over chromia gel catalyst."
          [9] "This was one of the main purposes of the present study."
          [10] "The high rates of interaction of terminal species with the catalyst."
          [11] "The procedure used in this study avoids these problems."
          [12] "Perhaps the most important result from this study is the demonstration that a reversible reaction can be well modeled using transient tracing regardless of how overall kinetics may be correlated."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps, including the conversion of i-C4H10 to i-C4H9/, the formation of i-C4H8 from i-C4H9/, the decomposition of i-C4H8 into hydrogen and isobutene, and the reverse reaction. A single rate-controlling step exists, which is the interconversion between i-C4H9 and i-C4H8. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its application in understanding the kinetics of reversible catalytic reactions, particularly with non-metallic catalysts. The use of transient isotopic tracing provides insights into the dynamics of the reaction and the identification of the rate-limiting step, which is crucial for catalyst design and performance prediction. Despite extensive study, the precise role of each step and the conditions under which they operate as rate-limiting steps continue to be subjects of ongoing research and debate.

          霍里图-波兰尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤，包括将i-C4H10转化为i-C4H9/、从i-C4H9/形成i-C4H8、i-C4H8分解为氢和异丁烯，以及逆反应。存在一个单一的速率控制步骤，即i-C4H9和i-C4H8之间的相互转化。由于该机制在理解可逆催化反应动力学方面的作用，特别是在非金属催化剂的情况下，它仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题。使用瞬态同位素追踪提供了反应动力学的洞察，并识别出了速率控制步骤，这对于催化剂设计和性能预测至关重要。尽管进行了大量的研究，但每一步的确切作用以及它们作为速率控制步骤的具体条件仍然是正在进行研究和辩论的主题。
