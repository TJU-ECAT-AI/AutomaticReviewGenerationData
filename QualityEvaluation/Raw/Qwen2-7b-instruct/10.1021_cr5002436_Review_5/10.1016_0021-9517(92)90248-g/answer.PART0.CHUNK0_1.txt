The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps, where the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species i-C4H9I converts to chemisorbed isobutene i-C4H8 and vice versa. This mechanism suggests that a single rate-controlling step exists for isobutane dehydrogenation. The reaction proceeds via intermediate species i-C4Hlo, i-C4H9/, i-C4H8/, and i-C4H 8. Both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation can be carried out at around 623 K over a chromia gel catalyst. The rate-determining step and the concentrations of intermediates are crucial in predicting catalyst performance. The overall reaction is i-C4Hr0 transforming to i-C4H8 plus H2. Transition state theory and thermodynamics predict the ratio V+/V_ based on the Gibbs free-energy change and reaction temperature.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含四个主要步骤，其中半氢化化学吸附物种i-C4H9I转化为化学吸附异丁烯i-C4H8及其逆过程。该机制表明，存在一个控制速率的单一步骤来控制异丁烷的脱氢。反应涉及中间物种i-C4Hlo、i-C4H9/、i-C4H8/和i-C4H 8。在约623 K时，这两种反应均可以在铬酸盐凝胶催化剂上进行。决定性步骤和中间体的浓度对于预测催化剂性能至关重要。总体反应是i-C4Hr0转化为i-C4H8加上H2。过渡态理论和热力学根据吉布斯自由能变化和反应温度预测V+/V_的比例。
