The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the addition of hydrogen (H) to the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species (i-C4H9). The second step is the subsequent addition of another hydrogen molecule, converting the half-hydrogenated species into the fully hydrogenated chemisorbed species (i-C4H8). The third step involves the removal of a hydrogen molecule from the fully hydrogenated species, reverting it back to the half-hydrogenated state. The final step is the conversion of the half-hydrogenated species back to the original molecule (i-C4H10). Despite extensive study over nearly a century, there is ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the process. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it helps understand the complex dynamics of reversible reactions, and its insights are crucial for catalyst design and predicting reaction performance.

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions includes four steps: the addition of hydrogen to the half-hydrogenated species, followed by the addition of another hydrogen molecule to convert it to the fully hydrogenated species. Subsequently, a hydrogen molecule is removed from the fully hydrogenated species, reverting it back to the half-hydrogenated state. The final step is the conversion of the half-hydrogenated species back to the original molecule. The rate-limiting step in this process is a subject of debate, and the mechanism continues to attract scientific interest due to its implications for catalyst design and predicting reaction outcomes.

该霍里图-波兰尼机制涉及催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤。第一步是向半氢化吸附物种（i-C4H9）添加氢（H）。第二步是随后添加另一个氢分子，将半氢化物种转化为完全氢化吸附物种（i-C4H8）。第三步涉及从完全氢化物种中去除一个氢分子，将其还原回半氢化状态。最后一步是将半氢化物种转化为原始分子（i-C4H10）。尽管近一个世纪的研究，关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制性过程中的争论仍然存在。这个机制继续吸引科学兴趣，因为它有助于理解可逆反应的复杂动态，并且其见解对于催化剂设计和预测反应性能至关重要。
