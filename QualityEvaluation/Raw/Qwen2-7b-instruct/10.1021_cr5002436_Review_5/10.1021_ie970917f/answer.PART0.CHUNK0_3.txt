[1] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."
[2] "The higher rates observed over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite may be attributed to stabilization of the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, a four-step process, explains the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. It includes rate-limiting dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The mechanism highlights the stabilization of the activated complex for isobutane dissociation on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure and/or by the presence of potassium as reasons for the enhanced reaction rates observed over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite compared to silica-supported catalysts.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制，一个四步过程，解释了催化脱氢反应。它包括限制性的异丁烷离解吸附和氢和异丁烯的准平衡吸附。机制指出，Pt/Sn簇在沸石孔结构中的异丁烷吸附/脱附激活复合物的稳定化以及钾的存在是导致与二氧化硅支持催化剂相比，Pt/Sn/K/SiO2和Pt/Sn/KL-沸石催化剂上观察到的反应速率更高的原因。
