[1] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."
[2] "The higher rates observed over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite may be attributed to stabilization of the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The rate-limiting step is considered to be the dissociative adsorption of isobutane, followed by quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is based on the kinetic data suggesting that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slowest process, thus limiting the overall reaction rate. However, the presence of potassium and the zeolite pore structure can stabilize the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane, contributing to higher reaction rates. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its ability to explain the observed reaction kinetics and the role of various factors in influencing the reaction rates.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。决定性的步骤被认为是异丁烷的解离吸附，随后是氢和异丁烯的准平衡吸附。关于哪个步骤是决定性步骤的争论基于动力学数据，表明解离吸附异丁烷是最缓慢的过程，因此限制了整个反应速率。然而，钾的存在和沸石孔结构可以稳定参与异丁烷解离吸附/脱附的活化复合物，从而导致较高的反应速率。由于该机制能够解释观察到的反应动力学以及各种因素对反应速率的影响，因此它仍然是科学界感兴趣并存在争议的话题。
