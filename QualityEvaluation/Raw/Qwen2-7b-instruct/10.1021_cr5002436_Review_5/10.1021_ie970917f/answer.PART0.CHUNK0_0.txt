[1] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."
[2] "The higher rates observed over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite may be attributed to stabilization of the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium."
[3] "The parameters of Table 2 suggest that the higher reaction rates over Pt/Sn/KL and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 may be attributed to the stabilization of adsorbed species on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores."
[4] "The successful application of the proposed rate expression based on the four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is attributed to the relatively clean surface at the reaction conditions investigated (0.45 < θ* < 0.75)."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a four-step process that explains catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The four main steps involve the dissociative adsorption of the reactant molecule (isobutane), the quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene, and subsequent reactions leading to product formation. Dissociative adsorption of isobutane is considered the rate-limiting step. The presence of potassium stabilizes the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure. The mechanism remains a topic of interest due to its successful application in describing reaction rates under certain conditions, particularly when considering the influence of zeolite pore structure and potassium on adsorption rates. The stabilization of adsorbed species on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores contributes to the enhanced reaction rates observed over Pt/Sn/KL and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 catalysts.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制是一个四步过程，用于解释催化脱氢反应。四个主要步骤涉及异丁烷的离解吸附、氢和异丁烯的准平衡吸附以及后续反应导致产物形成。离解吸附异丁烷被认为是速率限制步骤。钾的存在稳定了参与离解吸附/脱附异丁烷在沸石微孔结构内的Pt/Sn簇上的活性复合物。该机制仍然是一个研究话题，因为它成功地描述了在某些条件下反应速率，特别是考虑了沸石孔结构和钾对吸附速率的影响。在沸石微孔中的小Pt/Sn簇上稳定吸附物种导致Pt/Sn/KL和Pt/Sn/K/SiO2催化剂观察到的增强反应速率。
