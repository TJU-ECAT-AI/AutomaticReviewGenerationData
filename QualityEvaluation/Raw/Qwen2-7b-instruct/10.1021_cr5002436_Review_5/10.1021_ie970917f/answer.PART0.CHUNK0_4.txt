[1] "We have reported elsewhere the development of a kinetic model that describes the essential surface chemistry involved in isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over Pt/Sn-based materials (Cortright et al., 1996). This model, based on a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, incorporated results of microcalorimetric measurements for hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, steady-state kinetics investigations for isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation, and deuterium-tracing investigations for the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation."
[2] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."
[3] "The parameters of Table 2 suggest that the higher reaction rates over Pt/Sn/KL and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 may be attributed to the stabilization of adsorbed species on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the reactant, quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene, and subsequent activation and reaction. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around which of these steps is considered rate-limiting. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy due to its complexity and the influence of various factors such as catalyst composition and structure on the reaction rates. The stabilization of adsorbed species on the surface of the catalyst, particularly on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores, is suggested as a reason for the enhanced reaction rates observed over Pt/Sn/KL and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 catalysts.

对于催化脱氢反应，霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制涉及四个主要步骤：反应物的解离吸附、氢和异丁烯的准平衡吸附以及随后的活化和反应。科学界围绕哪一步是决定性的争论不休。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但该机制仍然是一个研究热点和争议话题，原因在于其复杂性以及催化剂组成和结构对反应速率的影响。催化活性Pt/Sn/KL和Pt/Sn/K/SiO2催化剂上表面物种的稳定化被建议为增强反应速率的原因。
