[1] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."
[2] "In the present paper, we focus on that portion of the analysis dealing with data from the steady-state kinetic studies of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over three Pt/Sn-based materials."
[3] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below (Cortright et al., 1996)."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the dissociative adsorption of the substrate, typically isobutane, onto the surface of the catalyst. This step is considered rate-limiting, meaning it determines the overall speed of the reaction. The second and third steps involve the quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene, respectively. The final step represents the desorption of the products from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms and the influence of various factors, such as temperature, substrate concentration, and catalyst properties. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it helps to elucidate the fundamental surface chemistry and kinetic aspects of dehydrogenation reactions, which are crucial for the optimization of industrial processes and catalyst design.

详细解释了催化脱氢反应的霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制，涉及四个主要步骤。第一步是脱氢物，通常是异丁烷，在催化剂表面的离解吸附。这一步被认为是速率决定步骤，决定了整个反应的速度。第二和第三步涉及氢和异丁烯的准平衡吸附。最后一步代表产物从催化剂表面的脱附。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的争论，是因为反应机制的复杂性和各种因素的影响，如温度、底物浓度和催化剂性质。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为它有助于阐明脱氢反应的基本表面化学和动力学特性，这对于优化工业过程和催化剂设计至关重要。
