[1] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."
[2] "The higher rates observed over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite may be attributed to stabilization of the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium."
[3] "The parameters of Table 2 suggest that the higher reaction rates over Pt/Sn/KL and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 may be attributed to the stabilization of adsorbed species on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores."
[4] "The successful application of the proposed rate expression based on the four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is attributed to the relatively clean surface at the reaction conditions investigated (0.45 < θ* < 0.75)."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a four-step process that explains catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The four main steps involve the dissociative adsorption of the reactant molecule (isobutane), the quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene, and subsequent reactions leading to product formation. Dissociative adsorption of isobutane is considered the rate-limiting step. The presence of potassium stabilizes the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure. The mechanism remains a topic of interest due to its successful application in describing reaction rates under certain conditions, particularly when considering the influence of zeolite pore structure and potassium on adsorption rates. The stabilization of adsorbed species on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores contributes to the enhanced reaction rates observed over Pt/Sn/KL and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 catalysts.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制是一个四步过程，用于解释催化脱氢反应。四个主要步骤涉及异丁烷的离解吸附、氢和异丁烯的准平衡吸附以及后续反应导致产物形成。离解吸附异丁烷被认为是速率限制步骤。钾的存在稳定了参与离解吸附/脱附异丁烷在沸石微孔结构内的Pt/Sn簇上的活性复合物。该机制仍然是一个研究话题，因为它成功地描述了在某些条件下反应速率，特别是考虑了沸石孔结构和钾对吸附速率的影响。在沸石微孔中的小Pt/Sn簇上稳定吸附物种导致Pt/Sn/KL和Pt/Sn/K/SiO2催化剂观察到的增强反应速率。

[2] "In the present paper, we focus on that portion of the analysis dealing with data from the steady-state kinetic studies of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over three Pt/Sn-based materials."
[3] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below (Cortright et al., 1996)."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is the dissociative adsorption of the substrate, typically isobutane, onto the surface of the catalyst. This step is considered rate-limiting, meaning it determines the overall speed of the reaction. The second and third steps involve the quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene, respectively. The final step represents the desorption of the products from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms and the influence of various factors, such as temperature, substrate concentration, and catalyst properties. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it helps to elucidate the fundamental surface chemistry and kinetic aspects of dehydrogenation reactions, which are crucial for the optimization of industrial processes and catalyst design.

详细解释了催化脱氢反应的霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制，涉及四个主要步骤。第一步是脱氢物，通常是异丁烷，在催化剂表面的离解吸附。这一步被认为是速率决定步骤，决定了整个反应的速度。第二和第三步涉及氢和异丁烯的准平衡吸附。最后一步代表产物从催化剂表面的脱附。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的争论，是因为反应机制的复杂性和各种因素的影响，如温度、底物浓度和催化剂性质。尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但该机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为它有助于阐明脱氢反应的基本表面化学和动力学特性，这对于优化工业过程和催化剂设计至关重要。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The rate-limiting step is considered to be the dissociative adsorption of isobutane, followed by quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is based on the kinetic data suggesting that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slowest process, thus limiting the overall reaction rate. However, the presence of potassium and the zeolite pore structure can stabilize the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane, contributing to higher reaction rates. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to its ability to explain the observed reaction kinetics and the role of various factors in influencing the reaction rates.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。决定性的步骤被认为是异丁烷的解离吸附，随后是氢和异丁烯的准平衡吸附。关于哪个步骤是决定性步骤的争论基于动力学数据，表明解离吸附异丁烷是最缓慢的过程，因此限制了整个反应速率。然而，钾的存在和沸石孔结构可以稳定参与异丁烷解离吸附/脱附的活化复合物，从而导致较高的反应速率。由于该机制能够解释观察到的反应动力学以及各种因素对反应速率的影响，因此它仍然是科学界感兴趣并存在争议的话题。
