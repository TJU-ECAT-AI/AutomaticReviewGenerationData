[1] "Graphite has been the subject of many studies in the field of surface science."
[2] "The study of graphite formation on Pt is of great importance in catalytic reactions and, its formation from hy- drocarbon decomposition has been studied by a wide variety of surface science techniques [1,21."
[3] "It is known that a graphite covered Pt surface has a very low activity for catalytic hydrocarbon decomposition compared to that of clean Pt [1,2]."
[4] "It is therefore important to understand the mechanism of graphite formation,nucleation and growth on the Pt surface."
[5] "In our studies we have used the knowledge about graphite obtained from many surface science techniques including scanning tunneling mi- croscopy (STM) studies on the surface of bulk graphite to try and understand details of graphite formation on the Pt surface."
[6] "From this investigation we have been able to gain insight into the the transition from carbidic to graphitic carbon and about the nucle- ation, growth and nature of the graphite layer formation on PtClll)."
[7] "It is observed that even for this single layer of graphite, only three of the six carbon atoms in the graphite lattice are seen and this cannot be accounted for by the usual expla- nation given for bulk graphite [6-131."
[8] "Quantitative and qualitative arguments obtained by STM measurements have enabled us to deter- mine that hydrocarbon decomposition on Pt(ll1) results in formation of a single layer of graphite on the surface."
[9] "In high resolution images of the graphite layer we observe only three of the six carbon atoms in the graphite lattice."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. The first step is hydrogen adsorption onto the catalyst surface. The second step is hydrogen dissociation, releasing hydrogen atoms. The third step is the reaction of these hydrogen atoms with the feed molecule to form a product. The fourth step is the desorption of the product from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the complexity of the reactions and the interplay between these steps. Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the intricate nature of the catalytic processes involved and the potential for multiple pathways and intermediates.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及四个主要步骤。第一步是氢在催化剂表面吸附。第二步是氢解离，释放氢原子。第三步是这些氢原子与原料分子反应形成产物。第四步是从催化剂表面脱附产物。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的争论源于反应的复杂性和这些步骤之间的相互作用。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，但这个机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为催化过程的复杂性和可能存在的多种途径和中间体。
