[1] "Experi- ments which involve sample temperatures above 450 K require that the STM be lifted from the sample. This is accomplished in a quite facile manner and images can be obtained within 10 min of a flash anneal to as high as 1200 K."
[2] "With annealing to higher temperature we observe the formation of larger structures with few of the smaller structures seen in the early stages of graphite growth remaining."
[3] "Quantitative and qualitative arguments obtained by STM measurements have enabled us to determine that hydrocarbon decomposition on Pt(ll1) results in formation of a single layer of graphite on the surface."
[4] "The observed modulat@n of the graphite lattice in the range of 0.25 A is consistent with the corrugation predicted by theory [6-9,131 and, with the corrugation observed in measurements made by AFM [9,25,26] and by He scattering [27]."
[5] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study."

1. The STM requires being lifted from the sample when dealing with temperatures above 450 K, but it can quickly be readied for imaging after a flash anneal to temperatures up to 1200 K.
2. Higher annealing temperatures lead to the formation of larger graphite structures, with the smaller, early-stage structures diminishing.
3. STM measurements have helped establish that hydrocarbon decomposition on Pt(111) results in the formation of a single layer of graphite on the surface.
4. The observed corrugation of the graphite lattice aligns with theoretical predictions and measurements from other techniques like AFM and He scattering.
5. The debate around which step in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is rate-limiting continues to be a subject of scientific inquiry and contention, even after nearly a century of research.

1. 当样本温度高于450 K时，需要将STM从样本上移开。但是，在进行快速退火至1200 K后，可以在10分钟内获得图像。
2. 更高的退火温度导致形成更大的结构，早期阶段看到的小结构逐渐减少。
3. STM测量帮助确定了在Pt(111)表面上通过氢化物分解形成的是一层单层石墨。
4. 观察到的石墨晶格的波纹与理论预测和AFM、He散射等其他技术的测量结果一致。
5. 在近一个世纪的研究后，关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制中哪个步骤是速率限制性的争论仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的焦点。
