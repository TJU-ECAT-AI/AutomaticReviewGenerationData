[1] "Experi- ments which involve sample temperatures above 450 K require that the STM be lifted from the sample. This is accomplished in a quite facile manner and images can be obtained within 10 min of a flash anneal to as high as 1200 K."
[2] "It is known that a graphite covered Pt surface has a very low activity for catalytic hydrocarbon decomposition compared to that of clean Pt."
[3] "In our studies we have used the knowledge about graphite obtained from many surface science techniques including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies on the surface of bulk graphite to try and understand details of graphite formation on the Pt surface."
[4] "The fact that a single layer of graphite is formed on the Pt surface is very important in discussing the effects seen in the STM images."
[5] "The superstructures seen in the images can be generated by placing a graphite lattice on top of a Pt lattice."
[6] "The sides of the hexagonal graphite islands follow the Pt substrate (1 IO) directions."
[7] "The observed modulat@n of the graphite lattice in the range of 0.25 A is consistent with the corrugation predicted by theory [6-9,131 and, with the corrugation observed in measurements made by AFM [9,25,26] and by He scattering [27]."

The document discusses the formation of a single layer of graphite on a Pt surface through hydrocarbon decomposition. STM techniques have been utilized to gain insight into the nucleation, growth, and nature of the graphite layer. It is found that the graphite layer forms as islands initially, which then accumulate and form a continuous band at the lower step edges and large, regularly shaped islands on the terraces. The document also mentions that only three of the six carbon atoms in the graphite lattice are visible in STM images, which contrasts with the usual explanation of inequivalent carbon atoms in the bulk graphite surface. The formation of superstructures with periodicities up to 22 Å is attributed to the higher order commensurability of the graphite and Pt lattices at different relative rotations. The document does not delve into the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, ongoing debates regarding which step is rate-limiting, or why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

文档讨论了通过烃类分解在Pt表面形成单层石墨的过程。使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）技术，研究人员获得了关于石墨层形成细节的新见解。研究发现，石墨层首先以岛屿形式形成，随后积累并在台阶边缘形成连续带状结构，在台阶上形成大型、规则形状的岛屿。文档还指出，STM图像中仅能看到石墨晶格中的三个碳原子，这与常规对石墨表面不等效碳原子的解释相矛盾。文档提到，观察到的周期性超级结构是由石墨和Pt晶格不同相对旋转时的更高层次相容性产生的。文档没有详细讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制、哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的持续争论，以及为什么这一机制在近一个世纪的研究后仍是一个科学关注点和争议焦点。
