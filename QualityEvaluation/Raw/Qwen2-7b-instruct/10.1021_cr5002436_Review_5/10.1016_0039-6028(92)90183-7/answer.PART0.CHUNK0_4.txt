[1] "Experi- ments which involve sample temperatures above 450 K require that the STM be lifted from the sample."
[2] "The capability to heat and cool the sample while tunneling allows us to carry out STM measurements over a wide, controlled temperature range from 150 to 450 K."
[3] "Following a saturation exposure of ethylene at 300 K the sample was annealed in stages to 800 K resulting in the formation of graphite on the Pt surface which produced the characteristic graphite rings observed with LEED."
[4] "In fig. 4, obtained after annealing to 1230 K, one sees that most of the graphite is now at the lower step edges with a few large, regularly shaped islands remaining on the terraces."
[5] "It is possible to generate the other superstructures observed in the images by placing the graphite lattice on top of the Pt lattice at different relative rotations."
[6] "For example, looking at the step edge area in fig. 4, one notes several interesting aspects about the shapes: (1) Some islands appear as regular hexagons (see fig. 4) with sixfold symmetry."
[7] "Formation of a single layer of graphite is also supported by qualitative observations made from graphite formation by decomposition of ethylene."
[8] "The fact that all of the graphite areas seen in an image (up to 4000 A x 4000 A) appear to be the same height relative to the Pt step height of 2.26 A supports the idea of a single layer of graphite."
[9] "Looking at the model with the two lattices in fig. 6 one realizes that there are many types of carbon/Pt interactions."

1. The STM experiment requires lifting the probe from the sample when heating it above 450 K. However, the instrument can perform measurements over a wide, controlled temperature range from 150 to 450 K by heating and cooling the sample simultaneously.
2. The sample was annealed from 300 K to 800 K in stages following the saturation exposure of ethylene, leading to the formation of graphite on the Pt surface.
3. At 1230 K, most of the graphite is observed at the lower step edges, with a few large, regularly shaped islands remaining on the terraces.
4. The superstructures in the STM images can be generated by placing the graphite lattice on top of the Pt lattice at various relative rotations.
5. Some islands in the STM images appear as regular hexagons with sixfold symmetry.
6. The observation of the same height for all graphite areas in an image up to 4000 A x 4000 A supports the idea of a single layer of graphite.
7. The height of the graphite areas is consistently lower than the height of the Pt step, regardless of initial hydrocarbon coverage or multiple hydrocarbon exposures at high temperatures.
8. The STM images reveal that there are numerous types of carbon/Pt interactions, contributing to the observed superstructures.

1. 当将样品加热至450 K以上时，需要将扫描隧道显微镜（STM）从样品中提起。然而，通过同时加热和冷却样品，仪器可以在150至450 K的广泛可控温度范围内执行测量。
2. 在300 K的饱和乙烯暴露后，将样品分阶段加热至800 K，从而在Pt表面形成石墨。这导致了与LEED观察到的特征性石墨环的形成。
3. 在1230 K时，大部分石墨位于较低的台阶边缘，有几个大的、规则形状的岛屿仍留在台面上。
4. STM图像中的超结构可以通过将石墨晶格放置在Pt晶格上的不同相对旋转来生成。
5. STM图像中的一些岛屿呈现出具有六边对称性的规则六边形形状。
6. 观察图像中所有区域的高度均一致，支持单层石墨的存在。
7. 石墨区域的高度始终低于Pt台阶的高度，无论初始的烃类覆盖度或多次高温下不同的烃类暴露情况如何。
8. STM图像揭示了碳/Pt相互作用的多种类型，这些贡献了观察到的超结构。
