[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."
[2] "The mechanism involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of ethylene on the surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds, forming a species that forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate; (2) hydrogenation through an ethyl intermediate; (3) further hydrogenation to form ethane; and (4) the ethyl group leaving the surface."
[3] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still open. While the first step (adsorption) is generally thought to be slow, the second step (hydrogenation through an ethyl intermediate) is often believed to be rate-determining."
[4] "Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the surface chemistry involved, the dynamic nature of the adsorbates, and the challenges in accurately modeling the reaction pathways and intermediates."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions describes the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface. It consists of four main steps: (1) adsorption of ethylene on the surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds, forming a species that forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate; (2) hydrogenation through an ethyl intermediate; (3) further hydrogenation to form ethane; and (4) the ethyl group leaving the surface. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still open. While the first step (adsorption) is generally thought to be slow, the second step (hydrogenation through an ethyl intermediate) is often believed to be rate-determining.

氢化反应机制由Horiuti和Polanyi在20世纪30年代提出，用于铂表面的乙烯氢化。它包括四个主要步骤：（1）通过断裂双键之一，在表面上吸附乙烯，形成与底层金属基体形成两个σ键的物种；（2）通过乙基中间体进行氢化；（3）进一步氢化形成乙烷；和（4）乙基团离开表面。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的争论仍然存在。虽然第一步（吸附）通常被认为较慢，但第二步（通过乙基中间体进行氢化）经常被认为是速率决定性步骤。尽管近一个世纪的研究，这一机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为表面化学的复杂性，吸附物的动态性质以及准确建模反应途径和中间体的挑战。
