[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."
[2] "Evidence for an ethyl intermediate was found in the 1950's by Kemball et al. using deuterium labeling that showed ethylene molecules readily exchange hydrogen atoms during the hydrogenation process."
[3] "The reaction has been observed to vary between half order and first order in hydrogen (depending upon temperature) and to be zero or slightly negative order in ethylene."
[4] "Ethylene adsorbed on Pt(111) in the absence of hydrogen was monitored with a variety of techniques that revealed the presence of several distinct surface species."
[5] "Ethylidyne, a spectator species during hydrogenation, competed directly for sites with di-σ-bonded ethylene and its surface concentration could be shown to be completely uncorrelated with the rate of hydrogenation."
[6] "In contrast, π-bonded ethylene did not compete for sites with the ethylidyne overlayer and was observed on the surface regardless of the surface concentration of ethylidyne."
[7] "Evidence points to the π-bonded species as being the primary intermediate in ethylene hydrogenation."
[8] "The surface concentration of this species is about 0.04 ML (ML = monolayer) during reaction."
[9] "Thus, the turnover rate per reaction intermediate is 25 times faster than the turnover rate if measured per surface platinum atom."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions proposes that ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds, forming a species that forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate. This species is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting centers around the ethyl intermediate. While it is clear that the ethylidyne, a spectator species, competes directly for sites with di-σ-bonded ethylene and its surface concentration is uncorrelated with the rate of hydrogenation, π-bonded ethylene does not compete for sites with the ethylidyne overlayer. Instead, it is observed on the surface regardless of the surface concentration of ethylidyne. Evidence points to the π-bonded species as being the primary intermediate in ethylene hydrogenation, with a surface concentration of about 0.04 ML during reaction. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the exact sequence of steps and the role of intermediates are still being debated. The relative hydrogenation rates of the species adsorbed on the surface during ethylene hydrogenation are as follows: π-bonded ethylene > di-σ bonded ethylene > ethylidyne.

机制提出，乙烯在铂表面吸附并断裂双键形成与基底金属原子形成两个σ键的物种。该物种随后通过乙基中间体逐步氢化生成乙烷。关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤的争论集中在乙基中间体上。虽然已知乙基炔作为旁观物种直接竞争与二σ键乙烯的位点，并且其表面浓度与氢化速率无关，π-键乙烯不会与乙基炔覆盖层上的位点竞争。相反，它无论表面乙基炔浓度如何都在表面存在。证据表明，π-键物种可能是乙烯氢化的首要中间体，其表面浓度约为反应期间的0.04 ML。尽管该机制已经研究了一个世纪，但序列步骤和中间体的作用仍在辩论中，因为它们的具体顺序仍然存在争议。乙烯氢化过程中吸附于表面的物种相对氢化速率如下：π-键乙烯 > 二σ键乙烯 > 乙基炔。
