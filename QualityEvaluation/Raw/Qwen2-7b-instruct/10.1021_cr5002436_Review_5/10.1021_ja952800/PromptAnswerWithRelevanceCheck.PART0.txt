[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."
[2] "The mechanism involves four main steps: (1) adsorption of ethylene on the surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds, forming a species that forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate; (2) hydrogenation through an ethyl intermediate; (3) further hydrogenation to form ethane; and (4) the ethyl group leaving the surface."
[3] "The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting is still open. While the first step (adsorption) is generally thought to be slow, the second step (hydrogenation through an ethyl intermediate) is often believed to be rate-determining."
[4] "Despite nearly a century of study, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because of the complexity of the surface chemistry involved, the dynamic nature of the adsorbates, and the challenges in accurately modeling the reaction pathways and intermediates."

氢化反应机制由Horiuti和Polanyi在20世纪30年代提出，用于铂表面的乙烯氢化。它包括四个主要步骤：（1）通过断裂双键之一，在表面上吸附乙烯，形成与底层金属基体形成两个σ键的物种；（2）通过乙基中间体进行氢化；（3）进一步氢化形成乙烷；和（4）乙基团离开表面。关于哪个步骤被认为是速率决定步骤的争论仍然存在。虽然第一步（吸附）通常被认为较慢，但第二步（通过乙基中间体进行氢化）经常被认为是速率决定性步骤。尽管近一个世纪的研究，这一机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，因为表面化学的复杂性，吸附物的动态性质以及准确建模反应途径和中间体的挑战。

[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."
[2] "According to their model, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds."
[3] "This species, which forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate, is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane."
[4] "Evidence for an ethyl intermediate was found in the 1950's by Kemball et al. using deuterium labeling that showed ethylene molecules readily exchange hydrogen atoms during the hydrogenation process."
[5] "Kinetic studies showed that the rate at which ethylene hydrogenates is independent of the structure of the underlying metal atoms and therefore it is called a structure-insensitive reaction."
[6] "The reaction has been observed to vary between half order and first order in hydrogen (depending upon temperature) and to be zero or slightly negative order in ethylene."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. First, ethylene chemisorbs on the platinum surface by breaking one of its carbon-carbon double bonds. This forms a species that creates two sigma bonds with the underlying metal substrate. Next, this species is stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to form ethane. In the 1950s, evidence for an ethyl intermediate was found using deuterium labeling, showing that ethylene molecules easily exchange hydrogen atoms during the process. Studies have shown that the rate of ethylene hydrogenation is independent of the structure of the metal atoms, making it a structure-insensitive reaction. The reaction order varies between half order and first order in hydrogen and is zero or slightly negative in ethylene. Despite nearly a century of study, the debate continues regarding which step is the rate-limiting step in the mechanism.

[6] "In contrast, π-bonded ethylene did not compete for sites with the ethylidyne overlayer and was observed on the surface regardless of the surface concentration of ethylidyne."
[7] "Evidence points to the π-bonded species as being the primary intermediate in ethylene hydrogenation."
[8] "The surface concentration of this species is about 0.04 ML (ML = monolayer) during reaction."
[9] "Thus, the turnover rate per reaction intermediate is 25 times faster than the turnover rate if measured per surface platinum atom."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions proposes that ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds, forming a species that forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate. This species is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting centers around the ethyl intermediate. While it is clear that the ethylidyne, a spectator species, competes directly for sites with di-σ-bonded ethylene and its surface concentration is uncorrelated with the rate of hydrogenation, π-bonded ethylene does not compete for sites with the ethylidyne overlayer. Instead, it is observed on the surface regardless of the surface concentration of ethylidyne. Evidence points to the π-bonded species as being the primary intermediate in ethylene hydrogenation, with a surface concentration of about 0.04 ML during reaction. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study because the exact sequence of steps and the role of intermediates are still being debated. The relative hydrogenation rates of the species adsorbed on the surface during ethylene hydrogenation are as follows: π-bonded ethylene > di-σ bonded ethylene > ethylidyne.

机制提出，乙烯在铂表面吸附并断裂双键形成与基底金属原子形成两个σ键的物种。该物种随后通过乙基中间体逐步氢化生成乙烷。关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤的争论集中在乙基中间体上。虽然已知乙基炔作为旁观物种直接竞争与二σ键乙烯的位点，并且其表面浓度与氢化速率无关，π-键乙烯不会与乙基炔覆盖层上的位点竞争。相反，它无论表面乙基炔浓度如何都在表面存在。证据表明，π-键物种可能是乙烯氢化的首要中间体，其表面浓度约为反应期间的0.04 ML。尽管该机制已经研究了一个世纪，但序列步骤和中间体的作用仍在辩论中，因为它们的具体顺序仍然存在争议。乙烯氢化过程中吸附于表面的物种相对氢化速率如下：π-键乙烯 > 二σ键乙烯 > 乙基炔。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, specifically for the hydrogenation of ethylene over a platinum surface, proposes four main steps. Initially, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds. This results in a species that forms two sigma (σ) bonds with the underlying metal substrate. This step is followed by the stepwise hydrogenation of the species through an ethyl intermediate to form ethane. Kinetic studies have shown that the rate of ethylene hydrogenation is independent of the structure of the underlying metal atoms, indicating that the reaction is structure-insensitive. The reaction's order varies between half order and first order in hydrogen, depending on temperature, and is zero or slightly negative order in ethylene. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting persists despite nearly a century of study. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because understanding the precise steps and rates of the reaction provides insights into the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic processes, which are crucial for industrial applications.
