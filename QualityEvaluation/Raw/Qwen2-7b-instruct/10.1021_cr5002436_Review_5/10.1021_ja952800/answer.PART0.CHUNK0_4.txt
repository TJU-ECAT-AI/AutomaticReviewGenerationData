[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."
[2] "According to their model, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carboncarbon double bonds. This species, which forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate, is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane."
[3] "Kinetic studies showed that the rate at which ethylene hydrogenates is independent of the structure of the underlying metal atoms and therefore it is called a structure-insensitive reaction."
[4] "The reaction has been observed to vary between half order and first order in hydrogen (depending upon temperature) and to be zero or slightly negative order in ethylene."

Answer: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions involves four main steps. Initially, ethylene chemisorbs on the platinum surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds, forming a species that forms two sigma (σ) bonds with the underlying metal substrate. This species is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane. Kinetic studies have shown that the rate of ethylene hydrogenation is independent of the structure of the underlying metal atoms, indicating that it is a structure-insensitive reaction. The reaction rate varies between half order and first order in hydrogen and is zero or slightly negative order in ethylene. The presence of an ethyl intermediate was confirmed in the 1950s using deuterium labeling, demonstrating that ethylene molecules readily exchange hydrogen atoms during the hydrogenation process. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy due to the ongoing debate about which step is considered rate-limiting. Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanism continues to evolve as researchers seek to understand the precise details of each step and the factors influencing reaction rates.

回答：霍里图-波拉尼机制涉及四个主要步骤。首先，乙烷在铂表面化学吸附，通过断裂碳-碳双键中的一个，形成与基底金属原子形成两个σ键的物种。然后，这个物种逐步氢化为一个乙基中间体，最终转化为乙烷。动力学研究表明，乙烷氢化的速率与底层金属原子结构无关，因此被称为结构不敏感反应。反应速率在氢气中表现为半级数到一级数，在乙烷中为零或轻微负级数。20世纪50年代，Kemball等人通过使用脱氘标记证实了乙基中间体的存在，证明了乙烷分子在氢化过程中容易交换氢原子。这一机制仍然是科学界关注和争议的话题，因为人们一直在争论哪个步骤是决定性的。尽管已经研究了一个多世纪，但随着研究人员试图了解每个步骤的精确细节以及影响反应速率的因素，该机制仍在不断发展。
