[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."
[2] "According to their model, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds. This species, which forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate, is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane."
[3] "Kinetic studies showed that the rate at which ethylene hydrogenates is independent of the structure of the underlying metal atoms and therefore it is called a structure-insensitive reaction."
[4] "The reaction has been observed to vary between half order and first order in hydrogen (depending upon temperature) and to be zero or slightly negative order in ethylene."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, specifically for the hydrogenation of ethylene over a platinum surface, proposes four main steps. Initially, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds. This results in a species that forms two sigma (σ) bonds with the underlying metal substrate. This step is followed by the stepwise hydrogenation of the species through an ethyl intermediate to form ethane. Kinetic studies have shown that the rate of ethylene hydrogenation is independent of the structure of the underlying metal atoms, indicating that the reaction is structure-insensitive. The reaction's order varies between half order and first order in hydrogen, depending on temperature, and is zero or slightly negative order in ethylene. The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting persists despite nearly a century of study. The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because understanding the precise steps and rates of the reaction provides insights into the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic processes, which are crucial for industrial applications.

氢化反应的霍里图-波拉尼机制首先在20世纪30年代由霍里图和波拉尼提出，针对铂表面的乙烷氢化。该机制包含四个主要步骤。最初，乙烷通过断裂碳-碳双键在清洁金属表面上化学吸附。这形成了一种物种，它与底层金属基质形成了两个σ键。接着，通过乙基中间体逐步氢化该物种以形成乙烷。动力学研究表明，乙烯氢化的速率与底层金属原子结构无关，因此被称为结构不敏感反应。该反应的顺序在氢气上表现为半级数到一级数之间（取决于温度），而在乙烯上为零或略负级数。目前关于哪个步骤被认为是限速步骤的争论仍在继续，尽管研究已经进行了近一个世纪。这一机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题，因为理解反应的确切步骤和速率提供了对催化过程效率和选择性的洞察，这对于工业应用至关重要。
