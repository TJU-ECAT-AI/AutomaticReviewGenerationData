[1] "Recent work on propane dehydrogenation over supported chromium oxide catalysts has indicated that, in addition to Cr6+ reduction, formation of hydrocarbon species on the catalyst surface may contribute to the initial activity increase observed."
[2] "The results observed during the ethane-D2 experiments show that only one H is exchanged for D in ethane. This observation points to an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on the catalyst surface."
[3] "Ethene experiences more HD exchange than ethane, and significantly more mono- than bi-deuterated ethene molecules are observed. This observation may indicate that ethene is adsorbed end-on as an ethyl entity on a Cr3+-O moiety, which may either be further hydrogenated to ethane, or, preferably, dehydrogenated back to ethene."
[4] "The transient experiments indicate that neither b-H transfer of an ethyl species, nor ethene desorption, is the rate-limiting step of reaction."
[5] "Together, when assuming that all surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism describes the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, which involve four main steps: adsorption of the substrate molecule, activation of the molecule, formation of a reactive intermediate, and desorption of the product. Despite nearly a century of study, the debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting remains. Some researchers argue that the adsorption step is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that it is the desorption step. This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because understanding the specific rate-limiting step can help in optimizing catalyst design and improving reaction efficiency.

霍里图-波拉尼机制描述了催化脱氢反应，涉及四个主要步骤：底物分子的吸附、分子活化、形成活性中间体和产物的脱附。尽管已经研究了一个世纪，关于哪个步骤是决定性步骤的争论仍然存在。一些研究人员认为吸附步骤是决定性步骤，而另一些人则提出脱附步骤是决定性步骤。这个机制仍然是科学界的热点问题，因为理解特定的决定性步骤可以帮助优化催化剂设计并提高反应效率。
