[1] "Recent work on propane dehydrogenation over supported chromium oxide catalysts has indicated that, in addition to Cr6+ reduction, formation of hydrocarbon species on the catalyst surface may contribute to the initial activity increase observed."
[2] "The results observed during the ethane-D2 experiments show that only one H is exchanged for D in ethane. This observation points to an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on the catalyst surface."
[3] "Ethene experiences more HD exchange than ethane, and significantly more mono- than bi-deuterated ethene molecules are observed."
[4] "Together, when assuming that all surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a widely debated topic in the scientific community. It involves four main steps:

1. **Adsorption**: The reactant molecule, such as ethane, is adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst.

2. **Activation**: The adsorbed molecule undergoes activation, often involving breaking of a bond, such as the C-H bond in ethane.

3. **Desorption**: The activated molecule is then desorbed from the surface, often in a transformed state, such as ethene.

4. **Reformation**: The catalyst reforms itself, allowing for the next cycle of reaction.

The ongoing debate revolves around which of these steps is considered rate-limiting. Some studies suggest that the rate-limiting step might be the adsorption process, as seen in this research where ethane adsorption was identified as the rate-limiting step. Others propose that the desorption step could be rate-limiting, depending on factors like the catalyst's surface area and the stability of the activated species.

Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of various industrial processes, including petrochemical refining. Understanding which step is truly rate-limiting helps in optimizing catalyst design and improving reaction yields, which is crucial for economic and environmental reasons.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制是科学界广泛讨论的话题。它包含四个主要步骤：

1. **吸附**：反应分子，如乙烷，被吸附到催化剂表面。

2. **活化**：吸附的分子经历活化，通常涉及打破一个键，例如乙烷中的C-H键。

3. **脱附**：激活的分子然后从表面脱附，通常以转换状态，例如乙烯。

4. **再形成**：催化剂重新形成自身，允许下一个反应循环。

争论围绕着这些步骤中哪一步被认为是决定性的。一些研究表明，决定性的步骤可能是吸附过程，正如这项研究中发现的那样，乙烷吸附被识别为决定性的步骤。其他人则提出，脱附步骤可能是决定性的，这取决于催化剂的表面积和激活物种的稳定性等因素。

尽管已经进行了近一个世纪的研究，但Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，因为它影响各种工业过程（包括石油化学精炼）的效率和选择性。理解哪个步骤真正是决定性的有助于优化催化剂设计并提高反应产率，这对于经济和环境原因至关重要。
