[1] "The catalytic test results reported in figure 1 are in line with the previous results, since the activity increase continues after the COx formation has vanished."
[2] "This result strongly suggests that such intermediates are not part of the reaction cycle leading to ethene formation."
[3] "The absence of bi-deuterated ethane, as would be expected for ethene hydrogenation in the presence of D2 [12], further indicates that there is little back formation of ethane from ethene under the applied reaction conditions."
[4] "This result is different from that reported by Kao et al. for isobutane dehydrogenation over pure Cr2O3, where b-H transfer was concluded to be the rate-determining step [21]."
[5] "Together, when assuming that all surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "Turning again to the recent theoretical work of Lillehaug et al. [13], this conclusion would favour the hydridocomplex route, in which ethane is adsorbed onto a CrH site, leading to the formation of CrC2H5 and a hydrogen molecule, with subsequent reformation of CrH and release of ethene."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is a topic of scientific interest and controversy. It describes the process through four main steps:

1. **Adsorption**: The substrate molecule binds to the active site of the catalyst surface.
2. **Activation**: The substrate molecule undergoes a chemical transformation at the active site.
3. **Desorption**: The transformed product is released from the catalyst surface.
4. **Re-catalysis**: The catalyst regenerates itself, ready for the next cycle.

Regarding the debate over which step is rate-limiting, the literature does not provide a clear consensus. The ongoing discussion stems from the complex nature of catalytic reactions, where multiple steps can influence the overall reaction rate. Factors such as temperature, catalyst type, and substrate concentration play crucial roles in determining which step controls the reaction speed.

The mechanism remains a topic of interest because understanding the precise details of how catalysts interact with substrates can lead to improvements in catalyst design and efficiency. These advancements are crucial for industries relying on catalytic processes, such as petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and environmental remediation.

Despite nearly a century of study, the specific mechanisms governing catalytic dehydrogenation reactions continue to evolve. New insights and theoretical models, such as those presented by Lillehaug et al., contribute to refining our understanding of these complex processes. These contributions are essential for optimizing industrial catalysts and enhancing their performance in various applications.

对于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制，这是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题。它通过四个主要步骤描述了这一过程：

1. **吸附**：底物分子与催化剂表面的活性位点结合。
2. **激活**：在活性位点上对底物分子进行化学转化。
3. **脱附**：转化后的产物从催化剂表面释放。
4. **再生**：催化剂自我再生，准备下一个循环。

关于哪一步是决定性的争论，文献没有提供明确的一致意见。这场辩论源于催化反应的复杂性，其中多个步骤可能影响整体反应速率。温度、催化剂类型和底物浓度等因素在确定哪些步骤控制反应速度方面起着关键作用。

机制仍然是一个感兴趣的话题，因为理解催化剂与底物相互作用的具体细节可以导致催化剂设计和效率的改进。这些进步对于依赖催化过程的行业，如石油化工、制药和环境修复至关重要。

尽管近一个世纪的研究，催化脱氢反应的具体机制仍在不断发展。新洞察和理论模型，如Lillehaug等人提出的，有助于深化我们对这些复杂过程的理解。这些贡献对于优化工业催化剂并提高其在各种应用中的性能至关重要。
