[1] "Surprisingly, not much studies have been devoted to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system."
[2] "The activation of the CH bond starts with the reaction of the alkane with a coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ centre leading to the formation of a new OH group and a Cr-alkyl bond."
[3] "The results observed during the ethane-D2 experiments show that only one H is exchanged for D in ethane."
[4] "Together, when assuming that all surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."
[5] "The following conclusions can be drawn from this work:(1) Ethane dehydrogenation of supported chromium oxide catalysts proceeds via an end-on, dissociative adsorption of ethane on a Cr3+O active site at the catalyst surface."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions describes the process as consisting of four main steps: (1) Adsorption of the substrate molecule onto the catalyst surface; (2) Activation of the substrate molecule through the formation of a transition state; (3) Desorption of the activated product molecule from the catalyst surface; (4) Release of the product molecule into the gas phase. Despite extensive study over nearly a century, the debate regarding which of these steps is considered the rate-limiting step remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. The mechanism itself remains relevant because it provides a foundational understanding of how dehydrogenation reactions proceed at the molecular level, which is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and performance in industrial applications.

The ongoing debate about the rate-limiting step is rooted in the complexities of surface chemistry and the dynamic nature of catalytic reactions. Different experimental conditions, catalyst properties, and substrate compositions can influence the relative rates of these steps, making it challenging to establish a definitive rate-limiting step across all scenarios. Moreover, the interplay between these steps is not always linear, and the system may exhibit complex kinetics that depend on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the specific catalyst used. Understanding the rate-limiting step is critical for improving catalyst efficiency, as it directly impacts the overall reaction rate and product yield.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because it offers a theoretical framework for predicting and explaining the behavior of dehydrogenation reactions. This knowledge is essential for advancing the field of catalysis, enabling researchers to design more effective catalysts and optimize existing processes. As such, continued investigation into the details of this mechanism, including the identification of the rate-limiting step, will likely contribute to significant advancements in the synthesis of valuable chemical products and the improvement of industrial processes.

催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述了过程，包括四个主要步骤：（1）底物分子在催化剂表面吸附；（2）通过形成过渡态激活底物分子；（3）从催化剂表面脱附激活产物分子；（4）释放产品分子进入气相。尽管自近一个世纪以来进行了广泛的研究，关于这些步骤中哪一个被认为是速率决定步骤的争论仍然是科学界的兴趣点和争议焦点。

机制本身之所以仍然相关，是因为它为理解脱氢反应在分子水平上的进行方式提供了基础，这对于优化催化剂设计和性能在工业应用中至关重要。

关于速率决定步骤的持续辩论源于表面化学的复杂性和催化反应的动态性质。不同的实验条件、催化剂特性和底物组成可以影响这些步骤的相对速率，使得确定所有情况下的速率决定步骤变得具有挑战性。此外，这些步骤之间的相互作用并不总是线性的，系统的动力学可能依赖于诸如温度、压力和所用催化剂等因素而变得复杂。了解速率决定步骤对于提高催化剂效率至关重要，因为它直接影响整体反应速率和产品产率。

Horiuti-Polanyi机制仍然是科学界感兴趣的话题，因为它提供了一个理论框架来预测和解释脱氢反应的行为。这种知识对于推进催化领域的发展至关重要，使研究人员能够设计更有效的催化剂并优化现有过程。因此，对这一机制细节的持续调查，包括识别速率决定步骤，可能会导致在合成有价值化学产品和改进工业过程方面取得重大进展。
