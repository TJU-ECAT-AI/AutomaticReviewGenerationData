[1] "The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts."
[2] "The ethene yield increased with Ga loading up to about 10 wt %. The molar CO2/C2H6 ratio in the feed, reaction temperature, and space velocity were decisive parameters for achieving maximum ethene yield."
[3] "Severe coking on the catalyst surface is the major reason for its deactivation, requiring further investigation."
[4] "Both commercial Ga2O3 and the 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts showed very high initial conversion (around 90%); however, the activity also declined with time on stream (Figure 14b), but less rapidly."
[5] "The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles."

1. The Ga loading and reaction conditions, including the CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, and space velocity, significantly impact the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of the catalysts.
2. The ethene yield increases with the Ga loading up to approximately 10 wt%. The CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, and space velocity are critical factors for achieving the highest ethene yield.
3. Carbon deposition on the catalyst surface is the primary cause of catalyst deactivation.
4. The initial conversion of both commercial Ga2O3 and the 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts is around 90%. However, the activity declines over time on stream, but at a slower rate compared to regeneration.
5. The efficient catalyst regeneration process suggests the potential for developing dynamic processes involving alternating reaction and regeneration cycles.
