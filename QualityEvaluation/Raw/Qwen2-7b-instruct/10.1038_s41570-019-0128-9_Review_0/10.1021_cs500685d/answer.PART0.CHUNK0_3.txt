[1] "In order to gain information about the surface acidic and basic sites, we applied NH3- and CO2-TPD measurements. In their pure form both oxide constituents, TiO2 and Ga2O3, are amphoteric, possessing acidic and basic sites."
[2] "The population of basic sites changed relatively little with the gallium loading."
[3] "The Raman spectra of as-prepared TiO2 showed typical bands belonging to anatase at about 144, 400, 515, and 636 cm1, whereas no bands due to rutile were identified."
[4] "The presence of Ga, however, mitigated that loss of surface area."
[5] "The intensity of the D band of carbon deposits on pure TiO2 (not shown) was smaller in comparison to that of the G band; however, with higher Ga loading the intensities of both bands became similar."
[6] "Both commercial Ga2O3 and the 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts showed very high initial conversion (around 90%); however, the activity also declined with time on stream."
[7] "The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles."

1. The surface acidic and basic sites of TiO2 and Ga2O3 are amphoteric, possessing both acidic and basic sites. 
2. The population of basic sites does not significantly change with the addition of gallium.
3. The as-prepared TiO2 Raman spectra showed typical bands of anatase, but no bands corresponding to rutile were identified.
4. The presence of gallium mitigated the loss of surface area observed in the catalysts.
5. The intensity of the D band of carbon deposits on pure TiO2 was lower than that of the G band, but this similarity increased with higher gallium loading.
6. Both commercial Ga2O3 and the 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts exhibited high initial conversion rates, but their activities decreased over time on stream.
7. The regeneration of the catalysts, especially the 10% Ga/TiO2, can lead to the development of dynamic processes with alternating reaction and regeneration cycles.

1. TiO2和Ga2O3的表面酸性和碱性位点是两性的，都具有酸性和碱性位点。
2. 催化剂中镓的添加对基本位点的数量影响不大。
3. 未处理的TiO2的拉曼光谱显示典型的金红石带，但没有发现对应锐钛矿的带。
4. 镓的存在减少了催化剂表面积的损失。
5. 纯TiO2上D带的强度低于G带，但随着镓含量的增加，这两种带的强度变得相似。
6. 商业Ga2O3和10% Ga/TiO2催化剂在初期显示出很高的转化率，但随时间流速逐渐下降。
7. 催化剂的再生，尤其是10% Ga/TiO2，为开发动态反应/再生循环过程提供了基础。
