[1] "The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts."
[2] "Ethane conversion and ethene selectivity showed a clear interdependence, higher ethane conversion resulting in lower ethene selectivity."
[3] "Carbon deposition on the catalyst surface increased with increasing Ga loading, as indicated by the thermoanalytical results shown in Figure 7b."
[4] "The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles."

1. The study focused on the impact of gallium (Ga) loading and reaction conditions, including the CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, and space velocity, on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of the catalysts. 
2. There was a clear interdependency between ethane conversion and ethene selectivity, with higher ethane conversion leading to lower ethene selectivity.
3. As the Ga loading increased, the carbon deposition on the catalyst surface also increased, as evidenced by the thermoeanalytical results.
4. The successful regeneration of the catalyst provided a foundation for the development of a dynamic process involving alternating reaction and regeneration cycles.

1. 研究重点是考察不同镓（Ga）负载和反应条件，如CO2/C2H6进料比、温度和空间速度，对催化剂性能、失活和再生行为的影响。
2. 乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性之间存在明显的相互依赖关系，更高的乙烷转化率导致乙烯选择性降低。
3. 随着Ga负载量的增加，催化剂表面的碳沉积量也相应增加，这是由热分析结果证明的。
4. 催化剂的再生成功为开发交替反应与再生周期的动态过程提供了基础。
