[1] "The catalyst regenerability experiments were performed using two different oxidants, CO2 and synthetic air (O2  20% balance N2), keeping the aforementioned reaction conditions constant."
[2] "The regeneration of the flame-made 10% Ga/TiO2 catalyst was accomplished by oxidizing (gasifying) the carbon deposits using synthetic air after each cycle (90 min time on stream)."
[3] "The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles."

1. Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenges involve optimizing these factors for maximum performance, considering trade-offs in terms of cost, stability, and efficiency. 

2. The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the support materials used and the reaction conditions. Different materials offer varying properties that can enhance or limit the catalytic performance. The CO2 partial pressure plays a critical role in the reaction kinetics and the formation of products.

3. The regeneration of the catalysts involves oxidizing the carbon deposits left on the catalyst surface. Synthetic air is used as the oxidant, which facilitates the removal of carbon, restoring the catalyst's activity. This process enables the development of dynamic processes that alternate between reaction and regeneration cycles, aiming for optimized performance and efficiency.
