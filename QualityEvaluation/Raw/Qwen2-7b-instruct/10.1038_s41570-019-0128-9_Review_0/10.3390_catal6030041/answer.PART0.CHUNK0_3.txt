1. MSU-1 was synthesized at room temperature using sodium silicate as the silicon source. VOx was loaded onto MSU-1 via a wet impregnation method to create VOx/MSU-1 catalysts. These catalysts were characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-TPR techniques. The catalysts were tested for isobutane dehydrogenation with or without CO2.

2. Without VOx doping, undoped MSU-1 showed low catalytic activity with 11.8% conversion of isobutane and 52.5% selectivity of isobutene. With VOx doping, the conversion of isobutane increased and reached a maximum of 58.8% at a VOx loading of 12 wt.%. Further increasing the VOx loading to 17.5 wt.% caused the conversion of isobutane to decrease.

3. CO2 presence in the reaction stream significantly enhanced the isobutane dehydrogenation efficiency. 

4. After extensive testing, 873 K was identified as the optimal reaction temperature for achieving 58.8% conversion of isobutane and 78.5% selectivity of isobutene.

5. The presence of CO2 led to a faster drop in isobutane conversion compared to the absence of CO2, with conversions dropping to 44.2% and 40.5% respectively after 3 hours of reaction.

1. 在室温下，使用硅酸钠作为硅源合成MSU-1。通过湿浸渍法在MSU-1上加载VOx以制备VOx/MSU-1催化剂。这些催化剂通过XRD、N2吸附脱附和H2温度程序还原（H2-TPR）技术进行了表征。对含有或不含CO2的异丁烷进行脱氢反应进行了测试。

2. 未掺杂的MSU-1表现出较低的催化活性，异丁烷转化率为11.8%，异丁烯选择性为52.5%。随着VOx掺杂量的增加，异丁烷转化率逐渐提高，并在12 wt.%的VOx负载时达到最大值58.8%。进一步增加VOx负载至17.5 wt.%后，异丁烷转化率开始下降。

3. 反应流中CO2的存在显著提高了异丁烷脱氢效率。

4. 经过广泛测试，确定873 K为最佳反应温度，可实现异丁烷转化率58.8%和异丁烯选择性78.5%。

5. 相对于没有CO2的情况，CO2的存在导致异丁烷转化率更快下降，分别在3小时反应后降至44.2%和40.5%。
