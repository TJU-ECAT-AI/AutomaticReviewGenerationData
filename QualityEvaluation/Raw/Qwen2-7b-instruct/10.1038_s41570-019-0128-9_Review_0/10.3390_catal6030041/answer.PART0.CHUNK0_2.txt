[1] "Vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1, with VOx loading ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 wt. %,was developed as a highly active catalyst in dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2."
[2] "The obtained catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption,and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) methods and the results showed that the large surface area of MSU-1 was favorable for the dispersion of VOx species and the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. %."
[3] "Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of VOx/MSU-1 was investigated, and VOx/MSU-1 with 12.0 wt. % VOx content was found to be the best one, with the conversion of isobutane (58.8%) and the selectivity of isobutene (78.5%) under the optimal reaction conditions."
[4] "In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could obviously enhance the isobutane dehydrogenation, which raised the conversion of reaction and the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

1.Vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1 was developed as a highly active catalyst for dehydrogenating isobutane with CO2.
2.XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-TPR methods were used to characterize the catalysts, showing that the large surface area of MSU-1 was beneficial for the dispersion of VOx species and the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. %
3.VOX/MSU-1 with 12.0 wt. % VOx content was found to be the most active catalyst, achieving a 58.8% conversion of isobutane and a 78.5% selectivity of isobutene under optimal conditions.
4.CO2 in the reaction stream significantly enhanced the isobutane dehydrogenation, increasing the conversion and stability of VOX/MSU-1 compared to reactions without CO2.

1.MSU-1支持的五氧化二钒被开发用于在二氧化碳存在下异丁烷脱氢的高效催化剂。
2.X射线衍射（XRD）、N2吸附-脱附和H2温度程序还原（H2-TPR）方法被用来表征催化剂，表明MSU-1的大表面积有利于VOx物种的分散，最佳的VOx负载为12.0 wt. %
3.VOX/MSU-1中12.0 wt. %的VOx含量被发现是最活跃的催化剂，在最佳条件下实现了异丁烷58.8%的转化率和异丁烯78.5%的选择性。
4.反应流中二氧化碳的存在显著增强了异丁烷脱氢，提高了VOX/MSU-1的转化率和稳定性，与不含二氧化碳的反应相比。
