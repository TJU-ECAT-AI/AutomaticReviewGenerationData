[1] "Vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1, with VOx loading ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 wt. %,was developed as a highly active catalyst in dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2."
[2] "Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of VOx/MSU-1 was investigated, and VOx/MSU-1 with 12.0 wt. % VOx content was found to be the best one, with the conversion of isobutane (58.8%) and the selectivity of isobutene (78.5%) under the optimal reaction conditions."
[3] "In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could obviously enhance the isobutane dehydrogenation, which raised the conversion of reaction and the stability of VOx/MSU-1."
[4] "Moreover, CO2 can eliminate coke deposited over the catalysts, to some extent, and improve the stability of catalysts."

Answer:
The vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1 catalysts show high activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The optimal VOx loading for this catalyst is 12.0 wt.%, leading to a conversion of 58.8% of isobutane and a selectivity of 78.5% of isobutene under optimal conditions. The presence of CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of isobutane and improves the stability of the catalyst. Additionally, CO2 helps to eliminate coke deposits on the catalysts, thereby improving their stability.

范德华氧化物支持在MSU-1上的催化剂在异丁烷与CO2的脱氢反应中表现出高活性。该催化剂的最佳VOx负载为12.0 wt.%，在最佳条件下，异丁烷转化率为58.8%，异丁烯选择性为78.5%。CO2的存在明显提高了异丁烷的脱氢效率，并提升了催化剂的稳定性。此外，CO2有助于清除催化剂上的焦炭沉积，从而改善催化剂的稳定性。
