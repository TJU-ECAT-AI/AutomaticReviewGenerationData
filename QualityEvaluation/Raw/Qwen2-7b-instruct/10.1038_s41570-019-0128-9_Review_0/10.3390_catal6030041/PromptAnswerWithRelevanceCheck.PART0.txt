[1] "Vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1, with VOx loading ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 wt. %,was developed as a highly active catalyst in dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2."
[2] "Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of VOx/MSU-1 was investigated, and VOx/MSU-1 with 12.0 wt. % VOx content was found to be the best one, with the conversion of isobutane (58.8%) and the selectivity of isobutene (78.5%) under the optimal reaction conditions."
[3] "In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could obviously enhance the isobutane dehydrogenation, which raised the conversion of reaction and the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

Answer:
The vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1 catalysts show high activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The optimal VOx loading for this catalyst is 12.0 wt.%, leading to a conversion of 58.8% of isobutane and a selectivity of 78.5% of isobutene under optimal conditions. The presence of CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of isobutane and improves the stability of the catalyst. Additionally, CO2 helps to eliminate coke deposits on the catalysts, thereby improving their stability.

[1] "The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, prepared by loading VOx over MSU-1, were active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. Their catalytic properties were related to the VOx loading and high surface area of MSU-1."
[2] "XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface area and pore volume."
[3] "As a result, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity,with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5% at 873 K."
[4] "In the feed of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane, which not only could remove H2 produced in the reaction through RWGS reaction but also suppress the formation of coke deposits and improve the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

1. The VOx/MSU-1 catalysts were effective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2, with their activity and selectivity influenced by the vanadium oxide (VOx) loading and the large surface area of the MSU-1 support.
2. XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-TPR analyses revealed that the ideal VOx loading was 12.0 wt. %, which resulted in larger bulk-like VOx crystals, reducing the surface area and pore volume.
3. Consequently, the catalyst with 12.0 wt. % VOx loading demonstrated the highest catalytic efficiency, achieving 58.8% isobutane conversion and 78.5% isobutene selectivity at 873 K.
4. The addition of CO2 in the reaction mixture significantly enhanced the isobutane dehydrogenation process. CO2 helped remove hydrogen produced via the RWGS reaction, prevented the formation of coke deposits, and improved the stability of the VOx/MSU-1 catalyst.

1. MSU-1 was synthesized at room temperature using sodium silicate as the silicon source. VOx was loaded onto MSU-1 via a wet impregnation method to create VOx/MSU-1 catalysts. These catalysts were characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-TPR techniques. The catalysts were tested for isobutane dehydrogenation with or without CO2.

2. Without VOx doping, undoped MSU-1 showed low catalytic activity with 11.8% conversion of isobutane and 52.5% selectivity of isobutene. With VOx doping, the conversion of isobutane increased and reached a maximum of 58.8% at a VOx loading of 12 wt.%. Further increasing the VOx loading to 17.5 wt.% caused the conversion of isobutane to decrease.

3. CO2 presence in the reaction stream significantly enhanced the isobutane dehydrogenation efficiency. 

4. After extensive testing, 873 K was identified as the optimal reaction temperature for achieving 58.8% conversion of isobutane and 78.5% selectivity of isobutene.

5. The presence of CO2 led to a faster drop in isobutane conversion compared to the absence of CO2, with conversions dropping to 44.2% and 40.5% respectively after 3 hours of reaction.

<p>With the use of downstream products of isobutene increasing [5,6], the demand of isobutene is rapidly growing, so the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene is becoming one of the important ways to produce isobutene.</p>
<p>In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could obviously enhance the isobutane dehydrogenation, which raised the conversion of reaction and the stability of VOx/MSU-1.</p>
<p>The presence of CO2 as a weak oxidant could eliminate hydrogen produced during the dehydrogenation through RWGS reaction [18,36]. Coupling of RWGS reaction with the dehydrogenation reaction therefore improved the equilibrium conversion of reaction toward isobutene production.</p>
<p>However, the selectivity of isobutene did not exhibit obvious change in a certain extent with the increase of VOx loading, basically keeping at 79% or so.</p>
<p>The conversion of isobutane gradually increased as the reaction temperature was raised, whereas the selectivity of isobutene, the object product, decreased on the contrary.</p>
<p>The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could suppress the formation of coke deposited over VOx/MSU-1 [17,37,38].</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene is a crucial method for producing isobutene due to the increasing demand for isobutene products. The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream enhances the dehydrogenation of isobutane, increasing the conversion and stability of the catalyst. CO2 acts as a weak oxidant, eliminating hydrogen through the RWGS reaction, which improves the equilibrium conversion towards isobutene production. The selectivity of isobutene does not significantly change with the increase of VOx loading. The conversion of isobutane increases with higher reaction temperatures, while the selectivity of isobutene decreases. CO2 also inhibits the formation of coke deposits on the catalyst. The selectivity to isobutene slightly increases with the progression of the reaction, particularly in the presence of CO2.

由于异丁烯产品需求的增长，异丁烷脱氢制异丁烯成为生产异丁烯的重要方式。在反应流中加入CO2可以明显提高异丁烷脱氢效率，增加反应转化率和催化剂稳定性。CO2作为弱氧化剂，通过水煤气变换反应消除生成的氢气，促进向异丁烯转化的平衡转化率。异丁烯的选择性随着VOx负载量的增加并不明显变化，基本保持在79%左右。随着反应温度的升高，异丁烷的转化率逐渐增加，而异丁烯的选择性则呈现相反的趋势。CO2还可以抑制催化剂表面焦炭的沉积。反应的进行过程中，异丁烯的选择性略微增加，特别是在有CO2的情况下。
