[1] "The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, prepared by loading VOx over MSU-1, were active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. Their catalytic properties were related to the VOx loading and high surface area of MSU-1."
[2] "XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface area and pore volume."
[3] "As a result, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity,with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5% at 873 K."
[4] "In the feed of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane, which not only could remove H2 produced in the reaction through RWGS reaction but also suppress the formation of coke deposits and improve the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

1. The VOx/MSU-1 catalysts were effective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2, with their activity and selectivity influenced by the vanadium oxide (VOx) loading and the large surface area of the MSU-1 support.
2. XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-TPR analyses revealed that the ideal VOx loading was 12.0 wt. %, which resulted in larger bulk-like VOx crystals, reducing the surface area and pore volume.
3. Consequently, the catalyst with 12.0 wt. % VOx loading demonstrated the highest catalytic efficiency, achieving 58.8% isobutane conversion and 78.5% isobutene selectivity at 873 K.
4. The addition of CO2 in the reaction mixture significantly enhanced the isobutane dehydrogenation process. CO2 helped remove hydrogen produced via the RWGS reaction, prevented the formation of coke deposits, and improved the stability of the VOx/MSU-1 catalyst.

1. VOx/MSU-1催化剂在使用CO2氧化脱氢异丁烷中表现出高效选择性，其活性和选择性受到VOx负载和MSU-1支持体大表面积的影响。
2. XRD、N2吸附-解吸附和H2-TPR分析显示，理想的VOx负载为12.0 wt. %，这导致了更大块状的VOx晶体形成，降低了表面面积和孔体积。
3. 因此，负载12.0 wt. % VOx的催化剂表现出最高的催化效率，在873 K时实现了58.8%的异丁烷转化率和78.5%的异丁烯选择性。
4. 反应混合物中的CO2显著提高了异丁烷脱氢过程。CO2有助于通过RWGS反应去除产生的氢气，防止焦炭沉积的形成，并改善了VOx/MSU-1催化剂的稳定性。
