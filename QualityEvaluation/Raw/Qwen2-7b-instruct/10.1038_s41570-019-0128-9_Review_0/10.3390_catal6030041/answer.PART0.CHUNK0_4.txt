<p>With the use of downstream products of isobutene increasing [5,6], the demand of isobutene is rapidly growing, so the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene is becoming one of the important ways to produce isobutene.</p>
<p>In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could obviously enhance the isobutane dehydrogenation, which raised the conversion of reaction and the stability of VOx/MSU-1.</p>
<p>The presence of CO2 as a weak oxidant could eliminate hydrogen produced during the dehydrogenation through RWGS reaction [18,36]. Coupling of RWGS reaction with the dehydrogenation reaction therefore improved the equilibrium conversion of reaction toward isobutene production.</p>
<p>However, the selectivity of isobutene did not exhibit obvious change in a certain extent with the increase of VOx loading, basically keeping at 79% or so.</p>
<p>The conversion of isobutane gradually increased as the reaction temperature was raised, whereas the selectivity of isobutene, the object product, decreased on the contrary.</p>
<p>The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could suppress the formation of coke deposited over VOx/MSU-1 [17,37,38].</p>
<p>Moreover, from Figure 5, it could also be seen that the selectivity to isobutene gave a slight increase with proceeding reaction, especially with CO2.</p>

The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene is a crucial method for producing isobutene due to the increasing demand for isobutene products. The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream enhances the dehydrogenation of isobutane, increasing the conversion and stability of the catalyst. CO2 acts as a weak oxidant, eliminating hydrogen through the RWGS reaction, which improves the equilibrium conversion towards isobutene production. The selectivity of isobutene does not significantly change with the increase of VOx loading. The conversion of isobutane increases with higher reaction temperatures, while the selectivity of isobutene decreases. CO2 also inhibits the formation of coke deposits on the catalyst. The selectivity to isobutene slightly increases with the progression of the reaction, particularly in the presence of CO2.

由于异丁烯产品需求的增长，异丁烷脱氢制异丁烯成为生产异丁烯的重要方式。在反应流中加入CO2可以明显提高异丁烷脱氢效率，增加反应转化率和催化剂稳定性。CO2作为弱氧化剂，通过水煤气变换反应消除生成的氢气，促进向异丁烯转化的平衡转化率。异丁烯的选择性随着VOx负载量的增加并不明显变化，基本保持在79%左右。随着反应温度的升高，异丁烷的转化率逐渐增加，而异丁烯的选择性则呈现相反的趋势。CO2还可以抑制催化剂表面焦炭的沉积。反应的进行过程中，异丁烯的选择性略微增加，特别是在有CO2的情况下。
