[1] "TiO2ZrO2 supports with different compositions ranging from 0 to 100 wt.% of ZrO2 were prepared by co- precipitation method and impregnated with 5 wt.% of Cr2O3."
[2] "The synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET and FTIR techniques."
[3] "Characterization studies revealed that the combination of different amounts of TiO2 and ZrO2 in the supports had obvious effect on the crystal structure, texture characteristic, and catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."
[4] "The highest catalytic activity and yield (C2H4 yield of 46% as well as 95% ethylene selectivity at 700 C) were acquired when 75 wt.% TiO2 and 25 wt.% ZrO2 were used as the support."

These studies show that the use of TiO2ZrO2 supports with varying proportions of ZrO2, when combined with 5 wt.% of Cr2O3, significantly affects the crystal structure, textural characteristics, and catalytic activity of the catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The best catalytic performance, with a 46% yield of ethylene and 95% selectivity, was achieved when the support contained 75 wt.% TiO2 and 25 wt.% ZrO2.

这些研究显示，使用不同比例ZrO2的TiO2ZrO2载体，与5 wt.%的Cr2O3结合，在使用CO2作为软氧化剂的乙烷氧化脱氢反应中，对催化剂的晶体结构、纹理特性和催化活性有显著影响。在75 wt.% TiO2和25 wt.% ZrO2的支撑下获得最佳催化性能，乙烯产率为46%，选择性为95%。
