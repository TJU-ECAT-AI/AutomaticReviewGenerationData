[1] "The inherent obstacles of the ethane dehydrogenation process are equilibrium limitations regarding ethane conversion, large energy consumption due to endothermic reaction and rapid catalyst deactivation owing to coke formation [3,12]."
[2] "Alternatively, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane by oxygen is free from thermodynamic constraints and can be operated at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction."
[3] "CO2 is now considered as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its role as a diluent in achieving high equilibrium conversion, enhancing the selectivity to ethylene, and maintaining longer catalyst life time [16,17]."
[4] "It has been indicated that CO2 increases the yield of ethylene via a redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction by ethane and re-oxidation (by CO2) cycles or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of ethane and the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[5] "However, due to using the CO2 as an oxidant in the ODH reactions, more carbonaceous deposits are formed and resulted in the fast deactivation of catalysts [21]."

1. The obstacles in the ethane dehydrogenation process include equilibrium limitations on ethane conversion, high energy consumption due to endothermic reactions, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane by oxygen avoids thermodynamic constraints and operates at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction. Carbon dioxide is considered a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane because it enhances the selectivity to ethylene and maintains longer catalyst lifetime. CO2 increases the yield of ethylene through a redox mechanism involving cycles of catalyst reduction by ethane and re-oxidation by CO2. However, using CO2 as an oxidant leads to faster catalyst deactivation due to increased carbonaceous deposit formation. Chromium oxide-based catalysts are noted for their high catalytic activity, and mixed oxide nanocomposites show enhanced acid-base bifunctional behavior. TiO2ZrO2 combined support has not been explored in dehydrogenating ethane with CO2 as a soft oxidant. There is a need to design better catalyst systems to overcome deactivation. Using TiO2ZrO2 as a combined support can improve ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity. ZrO2 addition to TiO2 helps prevent phase transformations, enhancing thermal stability. TiO2ZrO2 mixed oxides are active and selective for various reactions. The catalysts were synthesized using precipitation and co-precipitation methods, with Cr2O3 deposition by impregnation. The catalysts' structure was evaluated using XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET, and FTIR. The catalysts were tested for ethylene dehydrogenation under atmospheric pressure with CO2 as the oxidant.

1. 乙烷脱氢过程中的障碍包括乙烯转化的平衡限制、由于吸热反应导致的巨大能量消耗以及由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂快速失活。氧气进行的氧化脱氢可以避免热力学约束，在较低温度下以放热反应运行。二氧化碳现在被视为脱氢乙烷的软氧化剂，因为它在实现高平衡转化率、增强乙烯选择性和保持催化剂寿命方面发挥作用。二氧化碳通过催化剂由乙烷还原和通过二氧化碳重新氧化的循环或乙烷脱氢与水煤气转换反应逆向耦合机制增加了乙烯产量。然而，使用二氧化碳作为脱氢反应的氧化剂会导致更多碳质沉积物的形成，并导致催化剂快速失活。铬氧化物基催化剂因其高催化活性而被记录为最有可能的催化剂类型。混合氧化物纳米复合催化剂在酸碱双功能行为增强的情况下显示出了优越的氧化脱氢活性。添加ZrO2可以防止TiO2在高温下从锐钛矿相转变为金红石相，从而促进催化剂的热稳定性。TiO2ZrO2混合氧化物已被证明是多种反应（如环己烷氧化物异构化、羧酸氢化为醇、甲醇脱水为二甲醚、氧化和非氧化性乙苯和环己烷脱氢）的高效和选择性催化剂。催化剂通过沉淀和共沉淀方法合成，Cr2O3通过浸渍法沉积。催化剂结构通过XRD、FESEM、PSD、EDX、BET和FTIR等物理化学技术进行了彻底研究。在大气压力下使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂对乙烷进行氧化脱氢进行了评价。图1示意性地说明了通过共沉淀法制备不同负载量的TiO2ZrO2支持的方法。图3展示了二氧化碳氧化脱氢乙烷到乙烯的实验设置。
