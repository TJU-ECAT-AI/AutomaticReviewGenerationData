[1] "The inherent obstacles of the ethane dehydrogenation process are equilibrium limitations regarding ethane conversion, large energy consumption due to endothermic reaction and rapid catalyst deactivation owing to coke formation."
[2] "Alternatively, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane by oxygen is free from thermodynamic constraints and can be operated at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction."
[3] "CO2 is now considered as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its role as a diluent in achieving high equilibrium conversion, enhancing the selectivity to ethylene, and maintaining longer catalyst life time."
[4] "However, due to using the CO2 as an oxidant in the ODH reactions, more carbonaceous deposits are formed and resulted in the fast deactivation of catalysts."
[5] "Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
[6] "Also, the acid-base and textural properties of the supports strongly affect the catalytic performance."
[7] "The mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts also displayed superior ODH activity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement in the acid-base bifunctional behavior."
[8] "However, TiO2ZrO2 combined support was not been investigated for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene by CO2 as a soft oxidant."
[9] "The desired TiO2, ZrO2 and TiO2ZrO2 supports were synthesized by precipitation and co-precipitation methods, respectively."

The document discusses how various support materials, including TiO2, ZrO2, and their combinations, impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges include the formation of carbonaceous deposits leading to catalyst deactivation, especially when using CO2 as an oxidant. Trade-offs involve optimizing the balance between catalyst activity, selectivity, and lifetime under different conditions. The text highlights the importance of support materials' acid-base and textural properties, as well as the potential benefits of using mixed oxide nanocomposites. The study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of TiO2-ZrO2 supports and chromium oxide catalysts, evaluating their performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using CO2. The document provides insights into the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and catalytic activities under various conditions, aiming to improve catalyst efficiency for ethylene production.
