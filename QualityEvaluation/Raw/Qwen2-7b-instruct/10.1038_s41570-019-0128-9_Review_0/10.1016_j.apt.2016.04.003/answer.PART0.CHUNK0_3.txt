[1] "The inherent obstacles of the ethane dehydrogenation process are equilibrium limitations regarding ethane conversion, large energy consumption due to endothermic reaction and rapid catalyst deactivation owing to coke formation."
[2] "Alternatively, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane by oxygen is free from thermodynamic constraints and can be operated at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction."
[3] "CO2 is now considered as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its role as a diluent in achieving high equilibrium conversion, enhancing the selectivity to ethylene, and maintaining longer catalyst life time."
[4] "It could be attributed to the smaller particles, higher surface area, better dispersion of active phase, and uniform morphology of CrT75Z25."
[5] "As the percentage of ZrO2 content increases, most of the peaks match with monoclinic and tetragonal structure of ZrO2 and as the percentage of ZrO2 content decreases, most of the peaks match with anatase phase of TiO2."

The synthesis and characterization of TiO2ZrO2 supports with varying proportions of zirconia were aimed at enhancing the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The study focused on how the composition of the support influenced the catalytic properties of the Cr/TiO2ZrO2 nanocatalysts. The characterization involved XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET, and FTIR techniques. The results showed that the combination of different amounts of TiO2 and ZrO2 in the supports significantly affected the crystal structure, texture characteristics, and catalytic activity. The XRD analysis confirmed the presence of crystalline TiO2 and/or ZrO2 in the samples. FESEM and EDX images depicted the formation of homogeneous spherical agglomerates with a nanoscale size and even dispersion across the surface. BET results indicated high surface areas for the nanocatalysts. The highest catalytic activity and ethylene yield were observed when 75 wt.% TiO2 and 25 wt.% ZrO2 were utilized as the support, attributing to smaller particle size, higher surface area, better dispersion of the active phase, and uniform morphology. The optimization of the support composition was crucial for achieving improved catalytic performance.
