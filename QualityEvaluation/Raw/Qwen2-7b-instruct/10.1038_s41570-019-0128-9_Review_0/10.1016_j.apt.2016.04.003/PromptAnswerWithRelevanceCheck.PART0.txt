1. The obstacles in the ethane dehydrogenation process include equilibrium limitations on ethane conversion, high energy consumption due to endothermic reactions, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane by oxygen avoids thermodynamic constraints and operates at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction. Carbon dioxide is considered a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane because it enhances the selectivity to ethylene and maintains longer catalyst lifetime. CO2 increases the yield of ethylene through a redox mechanism involving cycles of catalyst reduction by ethane and re-oxidation by CO2. However, using CO2 as an oxidant leads to faster catalyst deactivation due to increased carbonaceous deposit formation. Chromium oxide-based catalysts are noted for their high catalytic activity, and mixed oxide nanocomposites show enhanced acid-base bifunctional behavior. TiO2ZrO2 combined support has not been explored in dehydrogenating ethane with CO2 as a soft oxidant. There is a need to design better catalyst systems to overcome deactivation. Using TiO2ZrO2 as a combined support can improve ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity. ZrO2 addition to TiO2 helps prevent phase transformations, enhancing thermal stability. TiO2ZrO2 mixed oxides are active and selective for various reactions. The catalysts were synthesized using precipitation and co-precipitation methods, with Cr2O3 deposition by impregnation. The catalysts' structure was evaluated using XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET, and FTIR. The catalysts were tested for ethylene dehydrogenation under atmospheric pressure with CO2 as the oxidant.

1. 乙烷脱氢过程中的障碍包括乙烯转化的平衡限制、由于吸热反应导致的巨大能量消耗以及由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂快速失活。氧气进行的氧化脱氢可以避免热力学约束，在较低温度下以放热反应运行。二氧化碳现在被视为脱氢乙烷的软氧化剂，因为它在实现高平衡转化率、增强乙烯选择性和保持催化剂寿命方面发挥作用。二氧化碳通过催化剂由乙烷还原和通过二氧化碳重新氧化的循环或乙烷脱氢与水煤气转换反应逆向耦合机制增加了乙烯产量。然而，使用二氧化碳作为脱氢反应的氧化剂会导致更多碳质沉积物的形成，并导致催化剂快速失活。铬氧化物基催化剂因其高催化活性而被记录为最有可能的催化剂类型。混合氧化物纳米复合催化剂在酸碱双功能行为增强的情况下显示出了优越的氧化脱氢活性。添加ZrO2可以防止TiO2在高温下从锐钛矿相转变为金红石相，从而促进催化剂的热稳定性。TiO2ZrO2混合氧化物已被证明是多种反应（如环己烷氧化物异构化、羧酸氢化为醇、甲醇脱水为二甲醚、氧化和非氧化性乙苯和环己烷脱氢）的高效和选择性催化剂。催化剂通过沉淀和共沉淀方法合成，Cr2O3通过浸渍法沉积。催化剂结构通过XRD、FESEM、PSD、EDX、BET和FTIR等物理化学技术进行了彻底研究。在大气压力下使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂对乙烷进行氧化脱氢进行了评价。图1示意性地说明了通过共沉淀法制备不同负载量的TiO2ZrO2支持的方法。图3展示了二氧化碳氧化脱氢乙烷到乙烯的实验设置。

The synthesis and characterization of TiO2ZrO2 supports with varying proportions of zirconia were aimed at enhancing the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The study focused on how the composition of the support influenced the catalytic properties of the Cr/TiO2ZrO2 nanocatalysts. The characterization involved XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET, and FTIR techniques. The results showed that the combination of different amounts of TiO2 and ZrO2 in the supports significantly affected the crystal structure, texture characteristics, and catalytic activity. The XRD analysis confirmed the presence of crystalline TiO2 and/or ZrO2 in the samples. FESEM and EDX images depicted the formation of homogeneous spherical agglomerates with a nanoscale size and even dispersion across the surface. BET results indicated high surface areas for the nanocatalysts. The highest catalytic activity and ethylene yield were observed when 75 wt.% TiO2 and 25 wt.% ZrO2 were utilized as the support, attributing to smaller particle size, higher surface area, better dispersion of the active phase, and uniform morphology. The optimization of the support composition was crucial for achieving improved catalytic performance.

[1] "TiO2ZrO2 combined supports were named as T(100  x)Zx, where x represents the nominal weight percentage of ZrO2 (x: 0, 25, 50, 75,100 wt.)."
[2] "The desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate corresponding to 5 wt.% Cr2O3 in the final product was dissolved in deionized water and then the powdered supports were added under continuous stirring at the same temperature."
[3] "As the percentage of ZrO2 content increases, most of the peaks match with monoclinic and tetragonal structure of ZrO2 and as the percentage of ZrO2 content decreases, most of the peaks match with anatase phase of TiO2."
[4] "By decreasing the ZrO2 content, the intensity of TiO2 peaks increases indicating that the introduction of titania into the zirconia lattice has been occurred which changes the structure of zirconia."
[5] "It is observed that some of the TiO2, ZrO2 and Cr2O3 peaks have overlap. For example, the peak of Cr2O3 at 2h = 24.5 is severely covered by the peaks of TiO2 at 2h = 25.3 and ZrO2 at 2h = 24.1."

The synthesis of the TiO2ZrO2 supports involves the coprecipitation of titanium (IV) chloride and zirconyl (IV) nitrate hydrate in deionized water, followed by aging hydrothermally, filtration, washing, drying, and calcination. Chromium (III) nitrate is then impregnated onto the supports through a wet impregnation method. The addition of ZrO2 to the TiO2 lattice leads to changes in the structure, with higher ZrO2 content resulting in a stronger presence of the monoclinic and tetragonal phases of ZrO2. Decreasing the ZrO2 content causes the intensity of TiO2 peaks to increase, suggesting the incorporation of titania into the zirconia lattice. The overlapping of TiO2, ZrO2, and Cr2O3 peaks indicates the small crystallite sizes and high dispersion of the components.

The XRD patterns show the crystalline phases of the synthesized materials, with peaks corresponding to TiO2 (anatase and tetragonal), ZrO2 (monoclinic and tetragonal), and Cr2O3 (rhombohedral). The addition of ZrO2 to the TiO2 lattice affects the structure of the zirconia, leading to changes in the crystalline phases. The presence of overlapping peaks suggests the small size and high dispersion of the components.
