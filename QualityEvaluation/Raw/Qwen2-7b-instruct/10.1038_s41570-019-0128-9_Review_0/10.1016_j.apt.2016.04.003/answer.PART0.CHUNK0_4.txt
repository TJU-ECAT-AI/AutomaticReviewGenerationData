[1] "TiO2ZrO2 combined supports were named as T(100  x)Zx, where x represents the nominal weight percentage of ZrO2 (x: 0, 25, 50, 75,100 wt.)."
[2] "The desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate corresponding to 5 wt.% Cr2O3 in the final product was dissolved in deionized water and then the powdered supports were added under continuous stirring at the same temperature."
[3] "As the percentage of ZrO2 content increases, most of the peaks match with monoclinic and tetragonal structure of ZrO2 and as the percentage of ZrO2 content decreases, most of the peaks match with anatase phase of TiO2."
[4] "By decreasing the ZrO2 content, the intensity of TiO2 peaks increases indicating that the introduction of titania into the zirconia lattice has been occurred which changes the structure of zirconia."
[5] "It is observed that some of the TiO2, ZrO2 and Cr2O3 peaks have overlap. For example, the peak of Cr2O3 at 2h = 24.5 is severely covered by the peaks of TiO2 at 2h = 25.3 and ZrO2 at 2h = 24.1."

The synthesis of the TiO2ZrO2 supports involves the coprecipitation of titanium (IV) chloride and zirconyl (IV) nitrate hydrate in deionized water, followed by aging hydrothermally, filtration, washing, drying, and calcination. Chromium (III) nitrate is then impregnated onto the supports through a wet impregnation method. The addition of ZrO2 to the TiO2 lattice leads to changes in the structure, with higher ZrO2 content resulting in a stronger presence of the monoclinic and tetragonal phases of ZrO2. Decreasing the ZrO2 content causes the intensity of TiO2 peaks to increase, suggesting the incorporation of titania into the zirconia lattice. The overlapping of TiO2, ZrO2, and Cr2O3 peaks indicates the small crystallite sizes and high dispersion of the components.

The XRD patterns show the crystalline phases of the synthesized materials, with peaks corresponding to TiO2 (anatase and tetragonal), ZrO2 (monoclinic and tetragonal), and Cr2O3 (rhombohedral). The addition of ZrO2 to the TiO2 lattice affects the structure of the zirconia, leading to changes in the crystalline phases. The presence of overlapping peaks suggests the small size and high dispersion of the components.

合成TiO2ZrO2支持涉及将四氯化钛和四硝酸锆在去离子水中共沉淀，然后进行水热老化、过滤、清洗、干燥和煅烧。随后，通过湿浸渍方法将三氧化铬施加到支撑材料上。向TiO2晶格中添加ZrO2导致结构变化，随着ZrO2含量的增加，主要检测到ZrO2的单斜相和四方相。降低ZrO2含量导致TiO2峰的强度增加，这表明在二氧化锆晶格中引入了二氧化钛。TiO2、ZrO2和Cr2O3峰的重叠表明这些成分的小晶体尺寸和高分散性。
