1. Manganese oxides are the most active and stable catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. They also exhibit similar general trends in conversion with carbon dioxide as compared to lower alkanes.

2. The catalyst with the best selectivity for propane conversion with CO2 is 1.5% K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2.

3. The rate of selective transformation of propane (C3H8) with CO2 into ethylene is described by an equation similar to the one for ethane, indicating a similar mechanism.

4. The general trends of propane conversion with CO2 are comparable to those of ethane transformation.

5. The rate of selective transformation of propane (C3H8) with CO2 into ethylene is described by an equation analogous to equation (10) in the document.
