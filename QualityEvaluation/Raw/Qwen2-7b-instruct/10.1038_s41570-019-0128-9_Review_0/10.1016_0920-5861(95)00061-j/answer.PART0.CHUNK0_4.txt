1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts were identified as the most active, selective, and stable for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. They also showed effectiveness in the conversion of heavier alkanes such as heptane.

2. The catalyst with the highest selectivity for propane conversion with CO2 is 1.5% K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2. It achieved a propane conversion of 96% at 800°C, 3600 hour-1, with a CO/ (C2H4+C3H6) ratio of 4.

3. On a 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst, at 800°C, 3600 hour-1, 73.1% of ethane was converted, along with 49.0% of CO2, with a CO/ (C2H4+C3H6) ratio of 1.5.

4. The rate of selective propane conversion to ethylene through CO2 was described by an equation similar to that for ethane conversion, involving redox processes.

5. The redox mechanism of manganese carbonate decomposition on the interface between MnO and CrO plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

6. The rate of CO formation during CO2 interaction with reduced Cr- or Mn-O/SiO2 catalysts was significantly lower (10 times) than in steady-state conditions.

1. 锰氧化物基催化剂被确认为乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢的最活跃、选择性和稳定的催化剂。它们在庚烷等更重的烷烃的转化中也表现出有效性。

2. 对于丙烷与CO2的选择性转化，活性最高的催化剂是1.5% K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2。在800°C、3600小时条件下，它实现了96%的丙烷转化，CO/（C2H4+C3H6）比例为4。

3. 在17%MnO/SiO2催化剂上，800°C、3600小时下，73.1%的乙烷被转化为49.0%的CO2，CO/（C2H4+C3H6）比率为1.5。

4. 丙烷通过CO2选择性转化为乙烯的速率由类似于乙烷转化的方程描述，涉及还原-氧化过程。

5. 锰碳酸盐分解的红ox机制在MnO和CrO界面处起着关键作用，在丙烷的氧化脱氢过程中。

6. 在还原的Cr-或Mn-O/SiO2催化剂上，CO2相互作用时的CO形成速率明显低于稳态条件下的10倍。
