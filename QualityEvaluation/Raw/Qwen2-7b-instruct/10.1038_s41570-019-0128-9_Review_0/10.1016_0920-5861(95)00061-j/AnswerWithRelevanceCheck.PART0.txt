          Various support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include balancing activity, selectivity, and stability. The choice of support materials and reaction conditions is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic performance, and careful consideration of these factors is essential for developing efficient and sustainable CO2 utilization processes.

          The most active and stable catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, as well as heavier alkanes like heptane, are manganese oxide-based catalysts. The 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst achieved a high C2H6 conversion rate of 73.1% and CO2 conversion rate of 49.0% at 800°C, with a CO:C:H6 ratio of 1.5. For propane conversion with CO2, the best catalyst is 1.5% K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2, which shows high selectivity. The redox mechanism of manganese carbonate decomposition on the MnO-CrO phase boundary is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The conversion rates for propane with CO2 are comparable to those for ethane transformation, indicating a similar mechanism. The rate of selective transformation of propane into ethylene is described by an equation akin to equation (10).
