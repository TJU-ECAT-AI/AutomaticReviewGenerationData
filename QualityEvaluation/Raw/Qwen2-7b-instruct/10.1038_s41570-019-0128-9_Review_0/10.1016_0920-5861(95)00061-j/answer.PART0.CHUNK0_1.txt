The various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst demonstrated a high C2H6 conversion rate of 73.1% and CO2 conversion rate of 49.0% at 800°C, with a CO:C:H6 ratio of 1.5. Additionally, the 1.5%K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2 catalyst showed high selectivity for propane conversion to C2-C3 olefins. However, the presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture significantly affected the conversion rates and product distribution. The redox mechanism of manganese carbonate decomposition on the phase boundary MnO-CrO plays an important role in the process. The general trends of propane conversion with CO2 are similar to those for ethane transformation, indicating a parallel mechanistic pathway. The rate of selective transformation of C3H8 with CO2 into ethylene follows a specific kinetic equation, K1KredPc3nsKoxPco2 FCzH4-. On the nickel catalyst, while CO2 conversion reached 80-85% at 750°C, propane underwent dehydrogenation to CO and H2, leading to quick coking. The kinetic equation of the propane conversion process is similar to the Mars-Van Krevelen equation. The degree of C4Hlo dehydrogenation into C4H8 is 19% at 665°C, but CO2 is not involved in the reaction, highlighting the distinct behavior of heavier alkanes.

各种支持材料如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2以及反应条件，包括CO2分压，影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径。例如，在800°C时，17%MnO/SiO2催化剂显示出73.1%的C2H6转化率和49.0%的CO2转化率，并且具有CO:C:H6比率为1.5的特性。此外，1.5%K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2催化剂显示了高选择性，用于丙烷转化为C2-C3烯烃。然而，在反应混合物中存在CO2显著影响了转化率和产物分布。锰碳酸盐分解的还原氧化机制在MnO-CrO相边界上起着重要作用。丙烷转化与乙烷转化的一般趋势相似，表明了一个平行的机制路径。C3H8与CO2选择性转换为乙烯的速率遵循特定的动力学方程，K1KredPc3nsKoxPco2 FCzH4-。在镍催化剂上，尽管在750°C时CO2转化率达到80-85%，但丙烷经历了脱氢反应生成CO和H2，导致快速结焦。丙烷转化过程的动力学方程类似于马斯-范克里夫伦方程。C4Hlo脱氢为C4H8的百分比在665°C时为19%，但CO2未参与反应，突出了较重烷烃的独特行为。
