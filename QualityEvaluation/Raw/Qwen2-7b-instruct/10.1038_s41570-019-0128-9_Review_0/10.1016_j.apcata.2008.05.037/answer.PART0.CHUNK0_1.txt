[1] "Several basic insights on the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures have been obtained by using such catalysts, but,because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual interest for industrial processes (i.e. conversion  50% and total olefin selectivity  90%)."

1. The use of various support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 along with chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions has been studied. However, the operational conditions in previous studies often differed significantly from those of real-world industrial processes, which typically require conversion rates of at least 50% and total olefin selectivities of at least 90%.

2. Among the tested materials, alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides have been examined for their use as catalysts in the presence of CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes. However, the best performance has been achieved with chromium-supported catalysts on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond.

3. Among the supported systems, the most promising outcomes were observed with SiO2, particularly in a mesoporous form, and diamond, both loaded with chromium at a weight percentage ranging from 1.7 to 8.0%.

4. The process of oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins in the presence of CO2 has been modeled based on the chemical reaction CnH2n2 → CO2 + CnH2n + CO + H2O.

5. Various reaction pathways and equilibrium yields have been documented in the literature for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

6. The thermodynamic evaluation of the process has been carried out using the model reaction: CnH2n2 → CO2 + CnH2n + CO + H2O.

7. The equilibrium constants (Kp) at different temperatures have been calculated through an equation derived from the van't Hoff isotherm integration between T0 and T.

8. The characteristics of the supported chromium species have been analyzed using diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (DR UVvis) to gain insights into their structure-function relationships.

1. 对于CO2氧化脱氢反应，使用诸如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2等不同支持材料以及铬氧化物催化剂进行了研究。然而，在先前的研究中，操作条件往往与实际工业过程有显著差异，通常需要至少50%的转化率和至少90%的总烯烃选择性。

2. 在测试的材料中，碱土金属、过渡金属和稀有地球金属氧化物被用于在CO2存在下进行C2C4烷烃的氧化脱氢。然而，最佳性能是在各种氧化物、沸石、活性碳和钻石上负载的铬催化剂实现的。
