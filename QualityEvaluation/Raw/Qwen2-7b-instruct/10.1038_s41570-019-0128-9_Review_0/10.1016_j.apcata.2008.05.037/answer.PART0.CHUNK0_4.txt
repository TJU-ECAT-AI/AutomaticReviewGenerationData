Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane has been investigated over CrOx/silica catalysts prepared by wet impregnation (Cr loading: from 0.5 to 7.5 wt%) using carbon dioxide as oxidant.
The highest activity, selectivity, and stability were exhibited by a catalyst with a Cr loading of 5.0 wt%.
The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates.
Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability.
Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased.
Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond.
Several basic insights on the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures have been obtained by using such catalysts, but, because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual interest for industrial processes (i.e., conversion ≥ 50% and total olefin selectivity ≥ 90%).

Various support materials, including SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, were tested as catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Chromium oxide catalysts showed the best performance on SiO2, especially when loaded at 5.0 wt%. The activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts were influenced by the chromium loading, with more dispersed chromates correlating to higher activity. Oxygen addition to the reaction mixture increased the catalyst's activity and stability, although it led to a slight decrease in the selectivity for propene and isobutene. The operational conditions for these studies often did not align with industrial process requirements, particularly concerning conversion levels and olefin selectivity.

各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，被测试用于CO2氧化脱氢反应。铬氧化物催化剂在SiO2上的性能最佳，尤其是当负载为5.0 wt%时。催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性受到铬负载的影响，更分散的铬化合物与更高的活性相关。向反应混合物中添加氧气增加了催化剂的活性和稳定性，尽管这导致丙烯和异丁烯的选择性略有下降。这些研究的运行条件往往不符合工业过程的要求，特别是在转化率和烯烃选择性方面。
