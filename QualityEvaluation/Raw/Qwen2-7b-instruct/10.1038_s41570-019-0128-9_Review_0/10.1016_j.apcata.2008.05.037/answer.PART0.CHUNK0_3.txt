2. "Several basic insights on the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures have been obtained by using such catalysts, but,because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual interest for industrial processes (i.e. conversion  50% and total olefin selectivity  90%)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document highlights that previous studies on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes using CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures have provided valuable insights. However, the operational conditions used in these studies were tailored to specific research objectives rather than aiming for industrial relevance. Industrial processes typically require conversion rates greater than 50% and total olefin selectivities above 90%.

4. "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Diffuse Reflectance UVvis spectroscopy (DR UVvis) studies revealed that all catalysts contained chromium ions in the form of monochromates, dichromates, and polychromates. Chromium(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was only identified in catalysts with a chromium loading exceeding 3.0 wt%.
