[1] "Several basic insights on the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures have been obtained by using such catalysts, but,because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual interest for industrial processes (i.e. conversion  50% and total olefin selectivity  90%)."
[2] "As an aspect of novelty, herein we report a study of the catalytic performance of a series of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts,tested in the ODH of propane and isobutane at high conversions."
[3] "The highest activity, selectivity and stability were exhibited by a catalyst with a Cr loading of 5.0 wt%."
[4] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."
[5] "The tests has been carried out by using as oxidant both CO2 only and CO2/O2 mixture."

Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, along with reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The optimization of overall performance involves balancing factors like catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and pressure to achieve high conversions and olefin selectivities. Challenges include avoiding excessive cracking and coke formation, maintaining catalyst stability, and ensuring efficient adsorption and reactivity of reactants. Trade-offs often involve choosing between high activity and selectivity, which may require careful tuning of the catalyst composition and operating conditions. Key findings suggest that chromium supported on different oxide supports can exhibit improved performance compared to other metals, especially at high conversion levels. Using CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures as oxidants allows for overcoming thermodynamic restrictions and enhancing catalyst efficiency.
