<quotes>
[1] "Because of such composition natural gas is one of the cleanest of all primary fossil fuels for both the production of energy and the production of other valuable molecules, like olefins."
[2] "Unfortunately, direct dehydrogenation (DD) of alkanes is a highly endothermic reaction (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +124.2 kJ/mol) and to reach high conversions the shift of the equilibrium, by decreasing the pressure or increasing the temperature, is required."
[3] "A way to overcome thermodynamic restrictions is the removal of hydrogen from the reaction system by adding a suitable oxidant."
[4] "Hence, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes by using O2 has become the object of many investigations as an alternative process."
[5] "However, ODH of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +166.6 kJ/mol),thus the addition of a small amount of oxygen decreases the energy demand."
[6] "Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7 21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent [17,2229]."
[7] "As an aspect of novelty, herein we report a study of the catalytic performance of a series of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts,tested in the ODH of propane and isobutane at high conversions."
[8] "The tests has been carried out by using as oxidant both CO2 only and CO2/O2 mixture."
[9] "Diffuse Reflectance UVvis spectroscopy (DR UVvis) measure- ments were performed with a PerkinElmer Lambda19 instrument equipped with an integrating sphere with the internal surface covered with BaSO4."
[10] "The composition of the reaction feed was CnH2n+2:CO2:N2 = 1:2:3.7 or CnH2n+2:CO2:O2:N2 = 1:2:0.3:3.4."
[11] "In the present case the thermodynamic estimation of the process has been modelled on the reaction: CnH2n2  CO2  CnH2n  CO  H2O (1)"
[12] "The values of the equilibrium constant (Kp) at various temperatures were calculated by using the following equation,resulting from the integration of the vant Hoff isochore between T0 and T:ln KT p"

1. Various support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, play a crucial role in optimizing their overall performance. Challenges include finding the right balance between high activity, high selectivity, and stability, while minimizing unwanted side reactions such as cracking and over-oxidation.

2. The activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts seem to be correlated with the dispersion of the chromium species. The introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts' activity and stability. However, this led to some decrease in the selectivity of propene and isobutene, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased.

3. The thermodynamic feasibility of oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins in the presence of CO2 is influenced by the equilibrium constant (Kp) and Gibbs free energy (DG) at different temperatures. Calculations of these values help in assessing the process's feasibility under various conditions.

1. 不同的支撑材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，影响铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性以及反应机理途径。反应条件，尤其是二氧化碳分压，对于优化其整体性能至关重要。挑战包括找到高活性、高选择性与稳定性的平衡点，同时尽量减少不希望发生的副反应，如裂解和过氧化。

2. 催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性似乎与铬物种的分散程度有关。氧气在反应混合物中至5.0体积%的引入导致了催化剂活性和稳定性的显著增加。然而，这导致丙烯和异丁烯的选择性略有下降，但由于增加了轻烯烃的选择性，总烯烃的选择性却有所提高。

3. 在存在二氧化碳的情况下，氧化脱氢烷烃的热力学可行性受平衡常数（Kp）和吉布斯自由能（DG）在不同温度下的值的影响。这些值的计算有助于评估在各种条件下过程的可行性。

Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, along with reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The optimization of overall performance involves balancing factors like catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and pressure to achieve high conversions and olefin selectivities. Challenges include avoiding excessive cracking and coke formation, maintaining catalyst stability, and ensuring efficient adsorption and reactivity of reactants. Trade-offs often involve choosing between high activity and selectivity, which may require careful tuning of the catalyst composition and operating conditions. Key findings suggest that chromium supported on different oxide supports can exhibit improved performance compared to other metals, especially at high conversion levels. Using CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures as oxidants allows for overcoming thermodynamic restrictions and enhancing catalyst efficiency.
