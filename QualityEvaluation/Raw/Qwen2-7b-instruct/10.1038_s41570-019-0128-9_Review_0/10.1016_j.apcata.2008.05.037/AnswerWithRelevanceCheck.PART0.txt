          [1] "Because of such composition natural gas is one of the cleanest of all primary fossil fuels for both the production of energy and the production of other valuable molecules, like olefins."
          [2] "Unfortunately, direct dehydrogenation (DD) of alkanes is a highly endothermic reaction (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +124.2 kJ/mol) and to reach high conversions the shift of the equilibrium, by decreasing the pressure or increasing the temperature, is required."
          [3] "A way to overcome thermodynamic restrictions is the removal of hydrogen from the reaction system by adding a suitable oxidant."
          [4] "Hence, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes by using O2 has become the object of many investigations as an alternative process."
          [5] "However, ODH of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +166.6 kJ/mol),thus the addition of a small amount of oxygen decreases the energy demand."
          [6] "Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7 21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent [17,2229]."
          [7] "As an aspect of novelty, herein we report a study of the catalytic performance of a series of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts,tested in the ODH of propane and isobutane at high conversions."
          [8] "The tests has been carried out by using as oxidant both CO2 only and CO2/O2 mixture."
          [9] "Diffuse Reflectance UVvis spectroscopy (DR UVvis) measure- ments were performed with a PerkinElmer Lambda19 instrument equipped with an integrating sphere with the internal surface covered with BaSO4."
          [10] "The composition of the reaction feed was CnH2n+2:CO2:N2 = 1:2:3.7 or CnH2n+2:CO2:O2:N2 = 1:2:0.3:3.4."
          [11] "In the present case the thermodynamic estimation of the process has been modelled on the reaction: CnH2n2  CO2  CnH2n  CO  H2O (1)"

          Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, along with reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The optimization of overall performance involves balancing factors like catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and pressure to achieve high conversions and olefin selectivities. Challenges include avoiding excessive cracking and coke formation, maintaining catalyst stability, and ensuring efficient adsorption and reactivity of reactants. Trade-offs often involve choosing between high activity and selectivity, which may require careful tuning of the catalyst composition and operating conditions. Key findings suggest that chromium supported on different oxide supports can exhibit improved performance compared to other metals, especially at high conversion levels. Using CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures as oxidants allows for overcoming thermodynamic restrictions and enhancing catalyst efficiency.

          不同的支撑材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，以及反应条件包括CO2分压，对CO2氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径有显著影响。优化整体性能需要平衡催化剂负载、反应温度和压力等因素，以实现高转化率和烯烃选择性。挑战包括避免过度裂解和焦炭形成，保持催化剂稳定性，并确保反应物的有效吸附和反应性。需要权衡的因素包括高活性和选择性的平衡，这可能要求精细调整催化剂组成和操作条件。关键发现表明，不同氧化物支持的铬可以表现出与其它金属相比的改善性能，尤其是在高转化水平下。使用CO2或CO2/O2混合物作为氧化剂能够克服热力学限制并提高催化剂效率。

          [1] "Several basic insights on the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures have been obtained by using such catalysts, but,because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual interest for industrial processes (i.e. conversion  50% and total olefin selectivity  90%)."
          [2] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."
          [3] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

          The document highlights that previous studies on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes using CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures have provided valuable insights. However, the operational conditions used in these studies were tailored to specific research objectives rather than aiming for industrial relevance. Industrial processes typically require conversion rates greater than 50% and total olefin selectivities above 90%. Various alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 in CO2 presence, but the most effective performance was achieved with chromium supported on different types of oxides, zeolites, activated carbon, and diamond. Among the supported systems, the most promising results were observed for SiO2, particularly in a mesoporous form, and diamond, both loaded with chromium at a weight percentage range of 1.7 to 8.0%. The thermodynamic estimation of the process has been carried out based on the reaction CnH2n2 → CO2 + CnH2n + CO + H2O. Different reaction pathways and equilibrium yields have been reported in the literature for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The equilibrium constants (Kp) at various temperatures were calculated through an equation derived from the van't Hoff isotherm integration between T0 and T. The features of supported chromium species have been evaluated using diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (DR UVvis) to understand their structure-function relationships.

          文献表明，对轻烷烃使用CO2或CO2/O2混合物进行氧化脱氢的研究提供了有价值的知识。然而，在这些研究中使用的操作条件是为了特定的研究目标而设定的，而不是为了追求工业应用的相关性。工业过程通常需要大于50%的转化率和超过90%的总烯烃选择性。各种碱土金属、过渡金属和稀有金属氧化物被测试用作CO2存在下C2C4的氧化脱氢催化剂，但在各种氧化物、沸石、活性炭和钻石上负载的铬显示出最佳性能。在所有支持系统中，对于SiO2，特别是在其多孔形式，以及钻石，都显示出加载有铬（重量百分比范围为1.7至8.0%）的最令人鼓舞的结果。过程的热力学估计基于化学反应CnH2n2 → CO2 + CnH2n + CO + H2O。文献中报道了轻烷烃氧化脱氢的不同反应途径和平衡产率。各种温度下的平衡常数（Kp）是通过从van't Hoff等温线在T0和T之间的积分得出的方程来计算的。使用漫反射紫外可见光谱（DR UVvis）评估了支持的铬物种的特性，以了解它们的结构-功能关系。
