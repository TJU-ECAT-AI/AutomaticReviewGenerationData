[1] "Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
[2] "In the latter case CO2 removes hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation, and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propylene formation."
[3] "It has been proposed that Cr(VI) species are responsible for the high catalytic activities of supported chromium oxide catalysts in the light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant, and Cr(VI) monochromate is more active than Cr(III) polychromate."
[4] "The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is also responsible for the catalyst deactivation."
[5] "This study demonstrates that chromium oxide supported on Na-type ZSM-5 with smaller crystal size (ca. 400 nm) is a new attractive catalyst applicable for propane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2."

1. 铬氧化物基材料在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中表现出高催化活性，是最有前景的催化剂。
2. 二氧化碳从丙烷脱氢过程中移除氢气，将脱氢平衡向丙烯形成方向转移。
3. 在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的轻烷烃脱氢反应中，铬(VI)物种是支持的铬氧化物催化剂的高活性原因，且铬(VI)单重铬酸盐比铬(III)多重铬酸盐更活跃。
4. 铬(VI)转化为铬(III)也是催化剂失活的原因之一。
5. 纳型ZSM-5负载的铬氧化物，具有较小晶粒尺寸，是一种适用于丙烷脱氢为丙烯与二氧化碳反应的新颖有吸引力的催化剂。
