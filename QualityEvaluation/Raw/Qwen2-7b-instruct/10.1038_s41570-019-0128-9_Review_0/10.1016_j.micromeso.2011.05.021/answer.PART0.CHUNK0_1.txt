1. In the CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, the selectivity of propylene production is notably high. 
2. The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation include equilibrium limitations on propane conversion, substantial energy consumption due to the endothermic nature of the reaction, and rapid catalyst deactivation caused by carbon deposit formation.
3. Utilizing CO2 in the feed for the reaction is environmentally beneficial since it transforms CO2, a significant greenhouse gas, into CO, which holds higher value in chemical industry applications.
4. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been extensively studied in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 
5. The size of the ZSM-5 support has a significant impact on the catalytic activity of the system.
