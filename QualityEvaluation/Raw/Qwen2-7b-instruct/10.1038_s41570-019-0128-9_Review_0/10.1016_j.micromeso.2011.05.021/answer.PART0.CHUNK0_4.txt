The various support materials and reaction conditions significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Chromium oxide supported on Na-type ZSM-5 with smaller crystal size exhibits higher activity compared to that supported on ZSM-5 with larger crystal size. The higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species on the former catalyst leads to superior catalytic performance. Challenges in optimizing overall performance include coke formation and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), which contribute to catalyst deactivation. Trade-offs involve selecting materials that balance high activity, selectivity, and stability while minimizing byproduct formation.

各种支持材料和反应条件对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径产生了显著影响。与较大晶粒尺寸的ZSM-5相比，Na型ZSM-5上具有更小晶粒尺寸的铬氧化物催化剂显示出更高的活性。前者的表面Cr(VI)物种浓度更高，这是其优越催化性能的原因。优化整体性能面临的挑战包括焦炭形成和Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)，这导致催化剂失活。需要权衡高活性、选择性和稳定性的同时，减少副产物形成，以平衡这些因素。
