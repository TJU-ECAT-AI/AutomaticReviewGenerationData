[1] "Over the last decade, the utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has gained increasing interest."
[2] "It has been shown that in this new process propylene can be obtained with a rather high selectivity."
[3] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the propane dehydrogenation reaction was observed on silica-supported Cr2O3 [13], rare earth vanadates [15], Ga2O3 and TiO2-supported Ga2O3 [1618], and In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide [19]."
[4] "In the latter case CO2 removes hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation, and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propylene formation."
[5] "Moreover, the use of CO2 in the feed is also ecological, because in this new process CO2, one of the major greenhouse gases, is reduced to CO which is more valuable in chemical industry."
[6] "Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium 1387-1811/$ - see front matter  2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
[7] "It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propylene via a redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction (by propane) and reoxidation (by CO2) cycles [13,14,20,21]."
[8] "Our results have shown that the crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound effect on the catalytic activity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
These studies highlight the importance of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Carbon dioxide promotes the reaction and shifts the equilibrium towards propylene formation. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those on ZSM-5 with smaller crystallite sizes, exhibit high catalytic activity and selectivity. The redox mechanism involving propane reduction and CO2 reoxidation is key to the process's efficiency. The size of the ZSM-5 support significantly affects the catalytic performance, indicating that optimizing the support's crystallite size can enhance the catalyst's overall activity and selectivity.

[1] "Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium 1387-1811/$ - see front matter  2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
[2] "It has been proposed that Cr(VI) species are responsible for the high catalytic activities of supported chro- mia catalysts in the light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant, and Cr(VI) monochromate is more active than Cr(III) polychromate [44,52]."
[3] "The much higher amount of Cr(VI) species observed on the Cr/ZSM-5- S catalyst than Cr/ZSM-5-L could be related to a much greater external surface area of the former catalyst (Table 1) and a higher concentration of terminal silanol on the external surface of ZSM-5 zeolite with smaller crystal size [33]."
[4] "The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is also responsible for the deactivation of Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst."
[5] "In addition to the coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is also responsible for the catalyst deactivation."

The various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the dispersion and accessibility of chromium species on the support. Higher activity and selectivity are often associated with materials that provide better dispersion and controlled pore structures. The reaction conditions, particularly the CO2 partial pressure, impact the redox cycle and the balance between the reduction and re-oxidation of chromium species, influencing the catalyst's performance. The trade-offs include maintaining the stability of the support under high temperature and reducing conditions while ensuring the accessibility of the active sites. Challenges in optimizing overall performance include finding the right balance between the support's physical properties and the catalytic activity of chromium species.

The key challenges and trade-offs involve:
1. Dispersion of chromium species on the support material to ensure efficient contact with reactants and maximize activity.
2. Maintaining the stability of the support and the chromium species under reaction conditions, including high temperatures and oxidative environments.
3. Optimizing the redox cycle of chromium species to enhance selectivity towards desired products while minimizing byproducts.
4. Balancing the pore size and structure of the support material to accommodate the active sites of chromium species effectively.
5. Ensuring adequate access to the active sites of chromium species while preventing agglomeration and deactivation due to coke formation and reduction of chromium species.

These factors collectively determine the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, necessitating careful selection and optimization of both the support material and reaction conditions.
