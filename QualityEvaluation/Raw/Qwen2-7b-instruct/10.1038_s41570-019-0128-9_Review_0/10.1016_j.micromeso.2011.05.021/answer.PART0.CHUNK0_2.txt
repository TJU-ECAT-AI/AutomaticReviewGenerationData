[2] "It has been proposed that Cr(VI) species are responsible for the high catalytic activities of supported chro- mia catalysts in the light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant, and Cr(VI) monochromate is more active than Cr(III) polychromate [44,52]."
[3] "The much higher amount of Cr(VI) species observed on the Cr/ZSM-5- S catalyst than Cr/ZSM-5-L could be related to a much greater external surface area of the former catalyst (Table 1) and a higher concentration of terminal silanol on the external surface of ZSM-5 zeolite with smaller crystal size [33]."
[4] "The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is also responsible for the deactivation of Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst."
[5] "In addition to the coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is also responsible for the catalyst deactivation."

The various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the dispersion and accessibility of chromium species on the support. Higher activity and selectivity are often associated with materials that provide better dispersion and controlled pore structures. The reaction conditions, particularly the CO2 partial pressure, impact the redox cycle and the balance between the reduction and re-oxidation of chromium species, influencing the catalyst's performance. The trade-offs include maintaining the stability of the support under high temperature and reducing conditions while ensuring the accessibility of the active sites. Challenges in optimizing overall performance include finding the right balance between the support's physical properties and the catalytic activity of chromium species.

The key challenges and trade-offs involve:
1. Dispersion of chromium species on the support material to ensure efficient contact with reactants and maximize activity.
2. Maintaining the stability of the support and the chromium species under reaction conditions, including high temperatures and oxidative environments.
3. Optimizing the redox cycle of chromium species to enhance selectivity towards desired products while minimizing byproducts.
4. Balancing the pore size and structure of the support material to accommodate the active sites of chromium species effectively.
5. Ensuring adequate access to the active sites of chromium species while preventing agglomeration and deactivation due to coke formation and reduction of chromium species.

These factors collectively determine the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, necessitating careful selection and optimization of both the support material and reaction conditions.

各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，通过影响铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的分散性和活性位点的可及性，从而影响其活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理。更高的活性和选择性通常与提供更好分散性和控制孔结构的材料相关联。反应条件，尤其是二氧化碳分压，影响铬物种的还原和再氧化循环，从而影响催化剂的性能。挑战在于在高温和氧化环境中保持支持材料和铬物种的稳定性，同时确保活性位点的高效接触。优化整体性能的关键挑战包括：
1. 在支持材料上均匀分散铬物种以确保与反应物的有效接触并最大化活性。
2. 在反应条件下（如高温和氧化环境）保持支持材料和铬物种的稳定性。
3. 优化铬物种的氧化还原循环，以增强目标产物的选择性并减少副产品的生成。
4. 平衡支持材料的孔径和结构以容纳铬物种的活性位点。
5. 确保活性位点的有效访问同时防止由于焦炭形成和铬物种还原导致的催化剂失活。

这些因素共同决定了二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的整体性能，需要仔细选择和支持材料以及反应条件的优化。
