[1] "Over the last decade, the utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has gained increasing interest."
[2] "It has been shown that in this new process propylene can be obtained with a rather high selectivity."
[3] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the propane dehydrogenation reaction was observed on silica-supported Cr2O3 [13], rare earth vanadates [15], Ga2O3 and TiO2-supported Ga2O3 [1618], and In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide [19]."
[4] "In the latter case CO2 removes hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation, and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propylene formation."
[5] "Moreover, the use of CO2 in the feed is also ecological, because in this new process CO2, one of the major greenhouse gases, is reduced to CO which is more valuable in chemical industry."

[7] "It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propylene via a redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction (by propane) and reoxidation (by CO2) cycles [13,14,20,21]."
[8] "Our results have shown that the crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound effect on the catalytic activity."

These studies highlight the importance of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Carbon dioxide promotes the reaction and shifts the equilibrium towards propylene formation. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those on ZSM-5 with smaller crystallite sizes, exhibit high catalytic activity and selectivity. The redox mechanism involving propane reduction and CO2 reoxidation is key to the process's efficiency. The size of the ZSM-5 support significantly affects the catalytic performance, indicating that optimizing the support's crystallite size can enhance the catalyst's overall activity and selectivity.

这些研究强调了二氧化碳作为选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯过程中的温和氧化剂的重要性。二氧化碳促进了反应并推动了平衡向丙烯形成的方向移动。特别是那些在ZSM-5上支持的铬氧化物催化剂，尤其是具有更小晶粒尺寸的，显示出高催化活性和选择性。通过丙烷还原和二氧化碳再氧化的红氧化机制是该过程效率的关键。支持物的晶粒尺寸显著影响催化性能，表明优化支持物的晶粒尺寸可以增强催化剂的整体活性和选择性。
