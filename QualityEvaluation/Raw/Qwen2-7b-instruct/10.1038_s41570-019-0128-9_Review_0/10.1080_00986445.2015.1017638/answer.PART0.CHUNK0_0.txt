[1] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[2] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[3] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The main cause is rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation rendering precise conversion measurements impossible."

1. Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, can influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance include achieving high activity and selectivity, maintaining stability over time, and controlling the formation of coke, which can deactivate the catalyst. Higher CO2 partial pressures tend to enhance the conversion of propane, but also increase the likelihood of coke formation and reduction of propylene selectivity. The trade-off here is balancing the benefits of higher CO2 conversion against the drawbacks of coke formation and decreased propylene yield.

2. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are superior to those in the presence of inert gases or hydrogen. Specifically, two-step reactions yield higher conversions compared to one-step reactions. This is due to the thermodynamic favorability of the reactions in the presence of CO2.

3. Experimental reports of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 have shown conversion levels significantly lower than those predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium models. This discrepancy suggests rapid catalyst deactivation, particularly by coke formation, which affects the precision of conversion measurements.

4. The main challenge in CO2-based dehydrogenation processes is the rapid deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation. This makes precise measurement of conversion levels difficult, as coke formation can cover and modify active sites on the catalyst surface, leading to decreased activity and selectivity.

1. 各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，以及反应条件，包括CO2分压，可以影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径。优化整体性能的关键挑战和权衡包括实现高活性和选择性、维持长时间稳定性，并控制焦炭形成，焦炭会破坏催化剂活性。较高的CO2分压倾向于提高丙烷的转化率，但也会增加焦炭形成和丙烯产率降低的可能性。这里的权衡是在提高CO2转化率的同时避免焦炭形成和丙烯产率降低。

2. 热力学分析表明，在CO2存在下的丙烷平衡转化率高于在惰性气体或氢气存在的转化率。具体来说，两步反应的转化率高于一步反应。这是由于CO2存在下反应的热力学优势。

3. 使用CO2进行丙烷脱氢的实验报告显示，转化率远低于热力学平衡模型预测的水平。这表明催化剂快速失活，特别是由焦炭形成导致，这使得精确测量转化率变得困难，因为焦炭形成会覆盖并改变催化剂表面的活性位点，导致活性和选择性降低。

4. CO2基脱氢过程中主要的挑战是催化剂快速失活，尤其是由于焦炭形成导致。这使得精确测量转化率变得困难，因为焦炭形成会覆盖并改变催化剂表面的活性位点，导致活性和选择性降低。
