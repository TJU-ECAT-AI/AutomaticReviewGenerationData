[1] "CO2 is a weaker coke removing agents when compared to steam."
[2] "Carbon dioxide is a weaker coke removing agents when compared to steam."
[3] "Unfortunately, depending on the system conditions, many undesired side reactions can occur including dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
[5] "Any combination of reactions 13 and 69 could be favored according to the catalyst formulation and operating conditions and, accordingly, different sets of equilibria could be approached."
[6] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."

The use of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is influenced by various factors including the type of support materials, reaction conditions, and CO2 partial pressure. The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of these catalysts are optimized through careful selection and adjustment of these factors. Key challenges in optimizing their overall performance include achieving a balance between enhancing activity and selectivity, managing the risk of coke formation, and controlling the reaction pathway to maximize propylene yield. Higher temperatures tend to increase the selectivity for CO and hydrogen, facilitating propane dry reforming. Higher CO2/C3H8 ratios and temperatures can reduce the tendency for coke formation and propylene yield, but this is contingent on the kinetic control of undesired side reactions by the catalyst formulation. Further research and development are needed to create more efficient catalysts that can fully exploit the environmental benefits of using CO2 in the commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，铬氧化物催化剂的使用受到多种因素的影响，包括支持材料的类型、反应条件和二氧化碳分压。通过精心选择和调整这些因素，可以优化催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径。在整体性能优化方面的主要挑战包括在提高活性和选择性的同时平衡风险，管理焦炭形成的风险，并控制反应路径以最大化丙烯产量。较高的温度倾向于增加CO和氢的选择性，促进丙烷干重整。较高的CO2/C3H8比例和温度可以降低焦炭形成和丙烯产量的趋势，但这取决于催化剂配方对不可控副反应的动态控制。需要进一步的研究和发展来创建更高效的催化剂，充分利用使用二氧化碳在轻烷烃商业脱氢中的环境优势。
