[1] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[2] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[3] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

The various support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. High CO2 partial pressure promotes the desired dehydrogenation, while lower pressures favor side reactions. Silicon dioxide, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, and ceria offer distinct catalytic properties. Higher temperatures increase the selectivity towards carbon monoxide and hydrogen, enhancing propane dry reforming. Optimizing the overall performance involves balancing these factors, addressing the challenges of coke formation, and selecting catalysts that can control undesired side reactions kinetically. Key trade-offs include maximizing the conversion of propane while minimizing coke formation and maintaining selectivity for propylene production.
