[1] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[2] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[3] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[5] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

The support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, play crucial roles in influencing the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit different performances based on the type of support material and the reaction conditions. Higher CO2 partial pressure generally leads to increased activity and selectivity due to enhanced interaction between CO2 and the catalyst surface. However, the selection of the support material is critical, as it affects the dispersion of chromium oxide, the accessibility of the active sites, and the resistance to coke formation. The trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts involve balancing the activity, selectivity, stability, and the ability to control coke formation and undesired side reactions. The challenges in achieving optimal performance include finding the right balance between catalyst reactivity and stability, minimizing coke deposition, and maintaining high propylene selectivity. To overcome these challenges, researchers need to focus on developing advanced catalyst formulations, improving the catalyst preparation techniques, and employing sophisticated reaction engineering strategies to control the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics effectively.

支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，以及反应条件，包括CO2分压，在影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和动力学途径方面起着关键作用。铬氧化物催化剂在不同类型的支撑材料和反应条件下表现出不同的性能。较高的CO2分压通常会导致活性和选择性的增加，由于催化剂表面与CO2之间的增强相互作用。然而，选择合适的支撑材料至关重要，因为它影响铬氧化物的分散、活性位点的可接近性和对焦油形成的抵抗力。优化铬氧化物催化剂整体性能的权衡涉及平衡活性、选择性、稳定性和控制焦油形成和不希望的副反应的能力。实现最佳性能面临的挑战包括找到催化剂反应性和稳定性之间的平衡，最小化焦油沉积，并保持高丙烯选择性。为了克服这些挑战，研究人员需要专注于开发先进的催化剂配方、改进催化剂制备技术，并采用复杂的反应工程策略来有效控制反应热力学和动力学。
