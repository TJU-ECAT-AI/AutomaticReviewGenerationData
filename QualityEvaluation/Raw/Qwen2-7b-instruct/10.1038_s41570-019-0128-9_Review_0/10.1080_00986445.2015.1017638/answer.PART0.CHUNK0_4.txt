[1] "The inclusion of different side reactions such as propane reforming and coke formation which corresponds to different catalysts and operating conditions in the reaction network results in dramatic changes in equilibrium compositions."
[2] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[3] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[5] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

The support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 used in chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions exhibit varying activities, selectivities, stabilities, and mechanistic pathways. Higher CO2 partial pressures generally lead to increased activity and selectivity. However, there are significant challenges in optimizing their performance, primarily due to the trade-offs between activity and selectivity. High temperatures tend to favor the formation of CO and hydrogen, enhancing propane dry reforming. Increasing the CO2/C3H8 ratio can reduce coke formation and propylene yield, except in cases where catalysts effectively control undesired side reactions. The stability of the catalysts against coke formation is crucial for maintaining their efficiency. Further research and development are necessary to create more effective catalysts for this environmentally beneficial process.

在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，用于铬氧化物催化剂的支撑材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）表现出不同的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理。较高的CO2分压通常导致活性和选择性的增加。然而，在优化其性能时存在重大挑战，主要是由于活性与选择性之间的权衡。高温倾向于促进CO和氢的形成，增强丙烷干重整。提高CO2/C3H8比可以减少结焦倾向和丙烯产率，除非催化剂有效控制不希望的副反应。催化剂对结焦的稳定性对于保持其效率至关重要。需要进一步的研究和发展来创造更有效的催化剂以实现这一环境友好过程。
