<p>Ca-doping of ThO2 strongly improved the ethene yield.</p>
<p>We have observed that dehydrogenation of ethane occurs in absence of catalyst at 725 C reaching a selectivity of about 83%.</p>
<p>In the presence of Th1x Ca x O2 afforded a selectivity of 97%, although conversion remained almost unchanged in both cases.</p>
<p>Preliminary EPR measurements on the Th0.75Ca0.25O2 sample showed the genesis of paramagnetic oxygen species in the range of 32003600 Gauss after exposure to CO2 at 725 C.</p>
<p>These species could be removed after subsequent exposure to ethane.</p>
<p>The loss of paramagnetic species due to ethane exposure hints towards a surface-bound radical oxygen species.</p>

1. Ca doping in ThO2 catalysts significantly enhanced ethene yield in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. Without a catalyst, ethane dehydrogenation at 725°C achieved a selectivity of around 83%.
3. In the presence of the catalyst, ethane dehydrogenation at 725°C reached a selectivity of 97%, with little change in conversion.
4. Paramagnetic oxygen species were detected in the Th0.75Ca0.25O2 catalyst upon exposure to CO2 at 725°C.
5. These species were eliminated after ethane exposure, suggesting they are surface-bound radical oxygen species.

1. 在ThO2催化剂中掺杂Ca显著提高了CO2氧化脱氢过程中乙烷转化为乙烯的产率。
2. 在没有催化剂的情况下，725°C下乙烷脱氢的选择性约为83%。
3. 在催化剂存在下，725°C下乙烷脱氢的选择性达到97%，转化率基本不变。
4. 在725°C下，向Th0.75Ca0.25O2催化剂暴露于CO2时检测到了顺磁性氧物种。
5. 这些物种在乙烷暴露后消失，表明它们是表面结合的顺磁性氧物种。
