How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

<quotes>
<p>The use of N2O as alternative oxidation agent is troubled by the fact that selectivity can be deteriorated at higher conversion due to the formation of reactive \({\rm O}{. - } \) radical species from N2O.</p>
<p>Furthermore, N2O also faces the drawback of limited availability for any mass production of ethene.</p>
<p>Recently, attempts have been made to utilize less reactive carbon dioxide as an oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane to yield ethene.</p>
<p>The advantage of utilization of the green house gas CO2 as oxidant is that it might lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures because it is less prone to supply oxygen species for reaction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, syngas can be obtained as a by-product of this process.</p>
<p>To our knowledge application of non-redox oxide materials for this reaction with CO2 has not been reported in the literature, probably because of their low propensity for dissociating CO2.</p>
<p>We have observed in an earlier study that Ca-doped ThO2 is capable of producing oxygen radicals, probably by virtue of p-type conductivity.</p>
<p>These radicals could be beneficial for partial oxidation of ethane.</p>
<p>A mild oxidizing compound such as CO2 could also dissociate at these oxide ion vacancy sites, producing oxide ion radicals at elevated temperature.</p>
<p>Th1x Ca x O2 solid solution catalysts were synthesized using the solution combustion method and the presence of oxide ion vacancies was indicated by Raman spectroscopy.</p>
<p>The catalysts were applied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 in the temperature range 600750 C and afforded 97% selectivity to ethene at 46% ethane conversion.</p>
<p>Ca-doping of ThO2 strongly improved the ethene yield.</p>
<p>Based on the results of experimental runs without catalyst and in the presence and absence of CO2 as well as preliminary EPR results we propose that the oxidative dehydrogenation occurs via both thermal dehydrogenation as well as a more selective radical pathway.</p>
<p>The latter process seems to be dominant over Th0.75Ca0.25O2 under the applied conditions.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an alternative oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane, particularly in comparison to nitrogen dioxide (N2O). CO2 offers advantages such as higher selectivity at elevated temperatures and the potential to produce syngas as a by-product. However, its limited availability poses a challenge for mass production of ethene. The literature explores the application of non-redox oxide materials, like calcium-doped thorium oxide (Ca-doped ThO2), which can produce oxygen radicals and facilitate selective dehydrogenation of ethane. The presence of oxide ion vacancies in these materials enables CO2 to dissociate, generating oxide ion radicals. The study focuses on Ca-doped ThO2 catalysts, which exhibit high selectivity and yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. The mechanism involves both thermal dehydrogenation and a selective radical pathway, with the latter being predominant under the tested conditions.

文献讨论了二氧化碳（CO2）作为乙烷脱氢反应替代氧化剂的应用，特别是在与氮氧化物（N2O）比较时。CO2的优势包括在较高温度下具有更高选择性，并且有可能产生合成气作为副产品。然而，其有限的可获得性为大规模生产乙烯带来了挑战。文献研究了非红氧化物材料的应用，如钙掺杂钍氧化物（钙掺杂ThO2），这些材料能够产生氧气自由基并促进乙烷的选择性脱氢。这些材料中的氧离子空位使CO2能够分解，产生氧离子自由基。研究重点是钙掺杂ThO2催化剂，在使用CO2进行乙烷氧化脱氢时显示出高选择性和产率。机制涉及热脱氢和选择性自由基途径，其中后一种在测试条件下占主导地位。

<p>Ca-doping of ThO2 strongly improved the ethene yield.</p>
<p>We have observed that dehydrogenation of ethane occurs in absence of catalyst at 725 C reaching a selectivity of about 83%.</p>
<p>In the presence of Th1x Ca x O2 afforded a selectivity of 97%, although conversion remained almost unchanged in both cases.</p>
<p>Preliminary EPR measurements on the Th0.75Ca0.25O2 sample showed the genesis of paramagnetic oxygen species in the range of 32003600 Gauss after exposure to CO2 at 725 C.</p>
<p>These species could be removed after subsequent exposure to ethane.</p>
<p>The loss of paramagnetic species due to ethane exposure hints towards a surface-bound radical oxygen species.</p>

Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of oxide ion vacancies in the Th1x Ca x O2 catalysts enhances the selectivity and activity of the catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethene. The use of Ca-doping in ThO2 leads to improved ethene yield, suggesting that the catalyst's performance can be optimized by adjusting the doping level and reaction conditions. The key challenges in optimizing overall performance involve balancing the trade-offs between selectivity and activity, ensuring catalyst stability over time, and elucidating the precise mechanistic pathways involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Preliminary EPR results suggest that the oxidative dehydrogenation occurs via both thermal dehydrogenation and a more selective radical pathway, with the latter being dominant under the applied conditions.
