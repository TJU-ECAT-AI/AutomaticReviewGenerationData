<p>The use of N2O as alternative oxidation agent is troubled by the fact that selectivity can be deteriorated at higher conversion due to the formation of reactive \({\rm O}{. - } \) radical species from N2O.</p>
<p>Furthermore, syngas can be obtained as a by-product of this process.</p>
<p>The main problem encountered in this reaction is catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition and thus termination of syngas production.</p>
<p>Up to date, Mo2C/SiO2 [17], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [18, 19], Cr/TS-1[20], Cr/SiO2 [15], Ga/TiO2 [21], and CeO2-based oxides [22] have been used in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant.</p>
<p>Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most active for this reaction. Chromium based catalysts supported on TS-1 or Cr/H-ZSM-5 show best performance, but their reaction temperature is limited to about 650 C, since at higher temperatures selectivity decreases significantly [20].</p>
<p>To our knowledge application of non-redox oxide materials for this reaction with CO2 has not been reported in the literature, probably because of their low propensity for dissociating CO2.</p>
<p>We have observed in an earlier study that Ca-doped ThO2 is capable of producing oxygen radicals [23], probably by virtue of p-type conductivity.</p>
<p>These radicals could be beneficial for partial oxidation of ethane.</p>
<p>A mild oxidizing compound such as CO2 could also dissociate at these oxide ion vacancy sites, producing oxide ion radicals at elevated temperature.</p>
<p>Thus, these materials may afford a more selective process than the strong oxidant Cr(VI).</p>
<p>With this in mind, we have explored Ca-doped ThO2 as a catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2.</p>
<p>Th1x Ca x O2 solid solution catalysts were synthesized using the solution combustion method and the presence of oxide ion vacancies was indicated by Raman spectroscopy.</p>
<p>The catalysts were applied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 in the temperature range 600750 C and afforded 97% selectivity to ethene at 46% ethane conversion.</p>
<p>Ca-doping of ThO2 strongly improved the ethene yield.</p>
<p>Based on the results of experimental runs without catalyst and in the presence and absence of CO2 as well as preliminary EPR results we propose that the oxidative dehydrogenation occurs via both thermal dehydrogenation as well as a more selective radical pathway.</p>

1. The use of N2O as an oxidation agent for ethane dehydrogenation leads to a decrease in selectivity due to the formation of reactive \({\rm O}{. - } \) radical species. Syngas can be produced as a by-product of this process.
2. Catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition is a major issue in ethane dehydrogenation reactions, leading to the termination of syngas production.
3. Various materials such as Mo2C/SiO2, Cr/H-ZSM-5, Cr/TS-1, Cr/SiO2, Ga/TiO2, and CeO2-based oxides have been utilized for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 as an oxidant.
4. Chromium-based catalysts, particularly those supported on TS-1 or Cr/H-ZSM-5, demonstrate superior performance but face limitations in selectivity at higher temperatures.
5. The application of non-redox oxide materials in ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 has not been extensively explored due to their low propensity for dissociating CO2.
6. Ca-doped ThO2 is capable of producing oxygen radicals, which could benefit ethane partial oxidation.
