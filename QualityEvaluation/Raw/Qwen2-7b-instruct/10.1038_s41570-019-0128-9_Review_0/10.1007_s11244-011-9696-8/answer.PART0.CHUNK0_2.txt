<p>Th1x Ca x O2 solid solution catalysts were synthesized using the solution combustion method and the presence of oxide ion vacancies was indicated by Raman spectroscopy. The catalysts were applied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 in the temperature range 600750 C and afforded 97% selectivity to ethene at 46% ethane conversion. Ca-doping of ThO2 strongly improved the ethene yield.</p>
<p>Based on the results of experimental runs without catalyst and in the presence and absence of CO2 as well as preliminary EPR results we propose that the oxidative dehydrogenation occurs via both thermal dehydrogenation as well as a more selective radical pathway. The latter process seems to be dominant over Th0.75Ca0.25O2 under the applied conditions.</p>

Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of oxide ion vacancies in the Th1x Ca x O2 catalysts enhances the selectivity and activity of the catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethene. The use of Ca-doping in ThO2 leads to improved ethene yield, suggesting that the catalyst's performance can be optimized by adjusting the doping level and reaction conditions. The key challenges in optimizing overall performance involve balancing the trade-offs between selectivity and activity, ensuring catalyst stability over time, and elucidating the precise mechanistic pathways involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Preliminary EPR results suggest that the oxidative dehydrogenation occurs via both thermal dehydrogenation and a more selective radical pathway, with the latter being dominant under the applied conditions.

各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，以及反应条件，包括CO2分压，影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径。Th1x Ca x O2催化剂中氧化离子空位的存在增强了催化剂对乙烷氧化脱氢至乙烯的选择性和活性。通过在ThO2中进行Ca掺杂可以提高乙烯产率，这表明可以通过调整掺杂水平和反应条件来优化催化剂性能。优化整体性能的关键挑战在于平衡选择性和活性之间的权衡、确保催化剂长时间稳定、并阐明氧化脱氢过程的确切机制路径。初步的EPR结果表明，氧化脱氢过程涉及热脱氢和更选择性的自由基途径，后者在应用条件下占主导地位。
