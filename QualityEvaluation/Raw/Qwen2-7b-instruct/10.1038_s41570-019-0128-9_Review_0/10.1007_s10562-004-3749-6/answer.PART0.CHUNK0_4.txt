[1] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation."
[2] "The effect of temperature on propene yield and selectivity is shown in figure 2. In all cases the yield of propene increased with temperature, but the detailed behavior varied with a type of support and the feed composition."
[3] "The introduction of CO2 to the feed decreased the selectivity and yield of propene."
[4] "The acidic nature as well as redox one is an important property of CO2."
[5] "Over the (3.4)CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."
[6] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

Various support materials, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 supports demonstrate a promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield, enhancing the reaction efficiency. Conversely, Al2O3 supports exhibit an inhibitory effect, reducing both the yield and selectivity of propene when CO2 is present. Reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, also play a crucial role in determining the overall performance of these catalysts. High CO2 levels can alter the acidity/basicity of the catalyst surface, influencing the reaction mechanisms and product distribution. Optimizing the catalyst's performance involves balancing factors such as chromium content, support material, and reaction conditions to achieve the desired product yield and selectivity. Key challenges include minimizing the detrimental effects of CO2 and steam, which can lead to catalyst deactivation or poisoning. The trade-offs in optimizing catalyst performance often involve finding the right balance between reactivity, stability, and selectivity, considering the complex interplay between the catalyst, support, and reaction environment.
