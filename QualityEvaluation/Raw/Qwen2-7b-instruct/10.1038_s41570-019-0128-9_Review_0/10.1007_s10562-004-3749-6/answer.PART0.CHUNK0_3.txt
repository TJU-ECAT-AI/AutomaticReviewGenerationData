[1] "In the present work, we have studied the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 over chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on two very different oxide supports (SiO2 and Al2O3)."
[2] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2."
[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."
[4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[5] "CO2 does not promote dehydrogenation of propane over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "Moreover, the yield and selectivity of propene markedly decreased in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[7] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."
[8] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."
[9] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

The study investigated the impact of various support materials, including silica (SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3), on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It was found that the nature of the support significantly influenced the catalytic performance. For instance, silica-supported catalysts exhibited a promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield, whereas aluminum oxide-supported catalysts showed a decrease in propene yield and selectivity when CO2 was present. The study suggests that the acidic/basic properties of the support play a crucial role in determining the reaction pathways and overall performance of the catalysts. Additionally, the results indicate that increasing the chromium loading level affects the poisoning/promoting effect of CO2 differently on silica and aluminum oxide-supported catalysts.

本研究探讨了不同支持材料（如二氧化硅（SiO2）和氧化铝（Al2O3））对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理的影响。研究发现，支持材料的性质显著影响催化性能。例如，二氧化硅支持的催化剂表现出二氧化碳促进丙烯产率的效果，而氧化铝支持的催化剂在二氧化碳存在下丙烯产率和选择性明显降低。研究表明，支持物的酸碱性质在确定催化剂的反应路径和整体性能方面起着关键作用。此外，结果表明，增加铬负载水平对二氧化硅和氧化铝支持的催化剂的二氧化碳中毒/促进效果产生不同的影响。
