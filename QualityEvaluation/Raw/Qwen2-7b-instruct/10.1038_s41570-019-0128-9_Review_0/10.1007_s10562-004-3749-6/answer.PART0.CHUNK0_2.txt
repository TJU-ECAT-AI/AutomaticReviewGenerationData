[1] "In all cases the yield of propene increased with temperature, but the detailed behavior varied with a type of support and the feed composition."
[2] "Over the (3.4)CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."
[3] "It is proposed that poisonous effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is due to the basicity of Al2O3."
[4] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

1. The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are significantly influenced by the support materials and reaction conditions. The nature of the support material, such as silica (SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3), affects how CO2 interacts with the catalyst, impacting the yield and selectivity of propene production. For instance, silica supports enhance propene yield in the presence of CO2, while aluminum oxide supports reduce it.

2. CO2 has a promoting effect on propene yield when supported on silica, but it negatively impacts the yield and selectivity of propene when supported on aluminum oxide. This suggests that the basicity of aluminum oxide might contribute to the detrimental effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst.

3. Increasing the chromium loading on the silica-supported catalyst increases the ratio of propene yield in pure hydrogen to the yield in the presence of CO2. Conversely, on the aluminum oxide-supported catalyst, the poisoning effect of CO2 decreases with increased chromium loading. This indicates that the relationship between chromium content and CO2's impact varies between different support materials.

4. Optimizing the overall performance of these catalysts involves balancing the effects of different support materials and chromium loadings. The choice of support material can significantly influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenge lies in finding the optimal combination that maximizes propene yield while maintaining selectivity and catalyst longevity.

1. 在不同支持材料（如硅酸盐和氧化铝）和反应条件的影响下，铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径有显著差异。例如，硅酸盐支持可以增强二氧化碳存在的丙烯产量，而氧化铝支持会显著降低丙烯产量及其选择性。

2. 二氧化碳对丙烯产量有促进作用，但这种作用仅限于硅酸盐支持的催化剂。相反，它会降低氧化铝支持催化剂中丙烯的产量和选择性。这表明氧化铝的碱性可能是二氧化碳对催化剂脱氢活性产生负面影响的原因。

3. 随着铬负载量的增加，在硅酸盐支持的催化剂上，纯氢气中丙烯的产率与二氧化碳存在的产率之比会增加。相比之下，氧化铝支持的催化剂中，随着铬负载量的增加，二氧化碳的毒害作用会减弱。这说明不同支持材料之间铬含量与二氧化碳影响之间的关系存在差异。

4. 要优化这些催化剂的整体性能，需要平衡不同的支持材料和铬负载量的选择。选择合适的支持材料可以显著影响催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。关键挑战在于找到能够最大化丙烯产率同时保持选择性和催化剂寿命的最佳组合。
