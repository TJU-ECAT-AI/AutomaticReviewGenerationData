1. Technological advancements in fracking have led to a significant increase in methane supply and a drop in its price since 2008. Shale gas has become a cost-effective and competitive feedstock due to these factors. The abundance of cheap ethane from shale gas has facilitated low-cost olefin production through steam cracking (SC).

2. The shift towards utilizing lighter feedstocks in SC processes has reduced the production of co-products. Ethane-based crackers have become prevalent, and existing liquid crackers have been retrofitted to handle lighter gaseous feeds, offering economic advantages.

3. The decrease in co-product production as a result of using lighter feedstocks in SC processes has had a profound impact on the local US olefin market. This shift has enabled the expansion of ethylene production capacity, particularly in the United States.

4. Shale gas exploitation has enabled the shipping and transport of ethane via pipelines, allowing US-based ethylene producers to exploit the low ethane prices in international markets.

5. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is a well-established method for producing olefins. Improvements in this process can focus on enhancing energy efficiency and reducing catalyst deactivation.

6. The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) processes are proven technologies with operational plants worldwide. However, they are inherently less efficient due to the syngas production step.

7. The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) requires significant advancements in catalyst design and reactor technology to manage the high exothermicity of the reaction before it can be considered a viable alternative to SC for olefin production.

1. 自2008年以来，由于压裂技术的进步，甲烷供应量大幅增加，价格显著下降。这使得页岩气成为一种具有竞争力的低成本原料。页岩气开采后产生的廉价乙烷使通过蒸汽裂解（SC）生产烯烃成为可能，并对美国当地的烯烃市场产生了深远影响。

2. 在SC过程中采用更轻的原料导致副产品的产量减少。基于乙烷的裂解器变得普遍，许多现有的液态裂解器也被改装以处理更轻的气体原料，这些原料在可获得时提供了经济优势。

3. 使用更轻原料的SC过程的转变，导致了美国当地烯烃市场的重大变化。这种转变使得乙烷生产能力的扩大成为可能，特别是在美国。

4. 页岩气开采使通过管道运输乙烷成为可能，从而使美国以外的乙烯生产商能够利用较低的乙烷价格。

5. 轻质烷烃的催化脱氢是一种成熟的生产烯烃的方法。对于这一过程的改进可以集中在提高能源效率和减少催化剂失活上。

6. 烯烃合成（Fischer-Tropsch synthesis，FTS）和甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程是成熟的技术，全球有运营的工厂。然而，它们的效率较低，原因是需要生产合成气的步骤。

7. 直接将甲烷转化为更高价值产品的方法，如氧化甲烷耦合（OCM），在催化剂设计和技术开发方面仍需做出重大努力，以应对该反应的高放热性，才能将其视为蒸汽裂解（SC）的替代方法用于生产乙烯和其他烯烃。
