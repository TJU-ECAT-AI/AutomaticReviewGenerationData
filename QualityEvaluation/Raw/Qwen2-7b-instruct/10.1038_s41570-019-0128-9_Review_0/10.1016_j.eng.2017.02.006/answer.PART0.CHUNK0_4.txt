<p>Despite the abundance of methane, the conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons or chemicals remains one of the most challenging topics facing the catalysis community today.</p>
<p>Although the benefits of OCM have been known for over 30 years, the issue of finding a viable catalyst with the necessary performance for the commercialization of the process is still crucial among researchers.</p>
<p>The low yields of ethylene and the strong exothermicity of this reaction need to be addressed in an appropriate reactor technology before OCM can be used as an alternative to SC for the production of ethylene and higher olefins.</p>
<p>It was found that not only does the metal composition have an influence on catalyst activity, but the particle size and morphology do as well.</p>
<p>Specifically, by using nanostructured catalysts (nanofibers, nanowire, and nano-rods), methane can be activated at lower temperatures and a better OCM performance can be obtained compared with the powder-form catalysts.</p>
<p>Although Siluria's patent application reveals that the single-pass C2 yield does not meet the target of 25%, the catalysts are durable over long periods of operation at low process temperatures.</p>
<p>Based on the abovementioned considerations, it is clear that some effort is still required before OCM can be considered as an alternative to SC for the production of ethylene and other olefins.</p>
<p>The shift from naphtha toward light feeds that are derived from tight oil, for the production of ethylene in steam crackers, has impacted the global propylene and crude C4 production capacity.</p>
<p>Catalytic dehydrogenation provides the possibility of high selectivity to a single olefin product much higher than can be expected from SC alone.</p>
<p>Although the process has been successfully commercialized, there is room for improvement. Further advances with respect to catalyst design, such as lower noble metal loading and increased stability, are essential.</p>
<p>Thermal control of the reactor is an important issue in OCM. Most laboratory-scale experimental setups use small-diameter tubes and run with very dilute mixtures and low methane conversions.</p>

The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a promising route for converting methane into ethylene and higher hydrocarbons. However, the low yields of ethylene and the strong exothermicity of the reaction need to be addressed in an appropriate reactor technology before OCM can be considered as an alternative to steam cracking (SC) for the production of ethylene and other olefins. Recent research has focused on developing nanostructured catalysts to activate methane at lower temperatures and improve OCM performance. Despite the potential of OCM, the technology is still in development and faces challenges such as catalyst durability, low ethylene selectivity, and the need for efficient thermal control in the reactor. Additionally, the dehydrogenation of light alkanes provides high selectivity to a single olefin product, but improvements in catalyst design, such as reducing noble metal loading and enhancing stability, are necessary to further optimize the process.

催化甲烷氧化耦合（OCM）是将甲烷转化为乙烯和更高烃类的一种有前景的方法。然而，乙烯的低产率和反应的强放热性需要在合适的反应器技术中得到解决，才能将OCM视为蒸汽裂解（SC）生产乙烯和其他烯烃的替代方案。近期的研究集中在开发纳米结构催化剂上，以在较低温度下激活甲烷并提高OCM性能。尽管OCM具有潜力，但该技术仍处于发展阶段，面临挑战，如催化剂耐久性、低乙烯选择性和反应器的高效热控制。此外，轻烷基的脱氢提供了单种烯烃产品的高选择性，但为了进一步优化过程，需要对催化剂设计进行改进，如降低贵金属负载量和增强稳定性。
