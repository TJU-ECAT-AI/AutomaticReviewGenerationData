<p>Steam crackers are not standalone units but are highly integrated with downstream production units and the downstream demand for a range of cracker products.</p>
<p>Completely switching the feed will lead to a different reactor effluent, whose effect will put pressure on different downstream units such as, for example, the methane refrigerant cycle, the performances of the columns, and the cracked gas compressor.</p>
<p>The driving force is production cost savings. In this way, the refinery costs are omitted and the cost savings have been estimated to be as high as $200 USD·t<sup>-1</sup> of ethylene.</p>
<p>In addition, efforts toward reducing CO2 emissions are performed globally, the trend of the large-scale development of coal-based olefin production under favorable governmental policies is highly questionable.</p>
<p>The main challenges for OCM to be economically successful are hence twofold, with catalyst development on the one hand and a novel reactor design on the other.</p>

1. Steam crackers are interconnected with downstream production units and are affected by the demand for various cracker products. Switching the feedstock can lead to a different reactor effluent that impacts downstream processes like the methane refrigerant cycle, column performance, and cracked gas compressor.

2. The shift towards ethane cracking is driven by cost savings. By eliminating refinery costs, the estimated cost savings can reach up to $200 USD per ton of ethylene.

3. Global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions have made large-scale coal-based olefin production questionable under favorable governmental policies.

4. The OCM technology faces challenges in catalyst development and reactor design to achieve economic success.

1. 蒸汽裂解器与下游生产单元紧密相连，并且受到各种裂解器产品的市场需求影响。改变燃料供应会导致不同的反应器产物，这会对下游过程产生压力，例如甲烷制冷循环、塔性能和裂解气体压缩机。

2. 乙烷裂解的转向是出于成本节约的目的。通过消除炼油成本，每吨乙烯的估计成本节省可达200美元。

3. 全球减排努力已经使在有利政府政策下大规模发展基于煤炭的烯烃生产变得可疑。

4. OCM技术面临催化剂开发和新型反应器设计的挑战以实现经济成功。
