[1] "The class of materials on which such catalytic processes are based are the reducible oxides."
[2] "Catalysis for renewable energy processes as,for instance,the production of solar fuels is attracting increased attention nowadays."
[3] "The reactivity of the oxygen atoms varies.They can be proton acceptors and generate Brnsted acidity,can assist heterolytic or radical type C H bond activation or when electrophilic will insert into hydrocarbon double bonds."
[4] "The paper will conclude with a discussion of trends in catalytic activity."
[5] "We will see that generally an increase in valence electron count as well as of charge on the reactive cation will decrease the strength of MO bonds."
[6] "The question is addressed of the observation of double volcano plots in the catalytic as well as electrocatalytic reactivity of the first row oxides when this is plotted as a function of the position of the metal along a row of the periodic system."

The document does not contain specific information about how various support materials and reaction conditions influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it discuss the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance. The focus is on the theory of surface chemistry and reactivity of reducible oxides, particularly the role of chemical bonding and reactivity in determining catalytic activity.
