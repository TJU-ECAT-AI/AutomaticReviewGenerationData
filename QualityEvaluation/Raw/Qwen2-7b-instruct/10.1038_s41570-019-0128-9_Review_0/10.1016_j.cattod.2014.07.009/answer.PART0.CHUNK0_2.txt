The paper aims to identify the reactivity parameters determining the activity and selectivity of materials. It focuses on reducible oxides, which are the basis for catalytic processes. The chemical bonding and reactivity of these materials are discussed, particularly in relation to electronic features. The paper emphasizes chemical concepts and insights derived from recent quantum-chemical computational data. It highlights the differences in electronic correlation effects between reducible oxides and other materials. The balance of covalent and ionic bonding interactions in reducible oxides is considered. Specific reactivity aspects like reducibility and water activation are explored. The paper discusses how the covalent bond in the oxide resembles ligand field bonding in coordination complexes. The catalytic reactivity of methane activation is used to illustrate the reactivity of PdO. Trends in chemical bonding and reactivity of the reducible oxide surface as a function of the reactive cation's position in the periodic system are analyzed. The paper concludes with a discussion of trends in catalytic activity, including the observation of double volcano plots in catalytic and electrocatalytic reactivity of the first row oxides when plotted against the metal's position along a row of the periodic system.
