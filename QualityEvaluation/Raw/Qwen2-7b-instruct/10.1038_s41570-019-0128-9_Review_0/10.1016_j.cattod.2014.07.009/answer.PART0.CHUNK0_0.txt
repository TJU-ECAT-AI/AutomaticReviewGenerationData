The various support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include the type of support material (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2), CO2 partial pressure, and the specific conditions under which the reactions are carried out. Challenges in optimizing overall performance often involve balancing these factors to achieve desired outcomes. For example, the selectivity might improve with certain support materials, while the activity could be enhanced with others. Stability is crucial for long-term operation, and the choice of material can affect how well the catalyst maintains its performance over time. The trade-offs typically involve selecting materials that offer the best compromise between activity, selectivity, and stability under the intended reaction conditions. These considerations are essential in tailoring the catalyst for efficient CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation, aiming to optimize the conversion and selectivity towards desired products.
