1. The covalent bond in the oxide shares similarities with ligand field type bonding found in coordination complexes.
2. Different activation modes are illustrated in Figure 1 and will be explored further in subsequent sections.
3. Two distinct types of elementary reaction stages are identified.
4. In the second reaction scenario, the oxygen anion that inserts into a reacting molecule transfers electrons to the surface cations, resulting in a reduction of the formal valence of the surface cation(s) by 2 charge equivalents.
5. Generally, an increase in valence electron count and charge on the reactive cation leads to a decrease in the strength of MO bonds.
6. The conclusion of the paper discusses patterns in catalytic activity.
7. The paper addresses the observation of double volcano plots in catalytic and electrocatalytic reactivity of first-row oxides when plotted as a function of metal position along the periodic system.
