[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
[4] "Not only gaseous oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."
[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."

1. Chromium-MCM-41 catalysts synthesized through direct hydrothermal method demonstrated high efficiency in the CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane, yielding propene with a conversion rate of 30% and a selectivity exceeding 90%.

2. It is hypothesized that during the reaction, chromium(VI) ions exist in a tetrahedral coordination, acting as an active monochromate species. These ions are reduced to chromium(III) ions in an octahedral coordination, which is considered a less active form.

3. An active catalyst can be revived through an oxygen treatment process, where the chromium(III) species is oxidized back to the chromium(VI) species.

4. Carbon dioxide, apart from oxygen, can also regenerate chromium(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced chromium(III)O6 octahedra, albeit with a lower efficiency compared to oxygen.

5. It is concluded that during the reaction, propane undergoes dehydrogenation to produce propene, with the reaction occurring via chromium(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which simultaneously gets reduced to chromium(III)O6 octahedra.

1. 直接水热合成方法制备的铬-MCM-41催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下对丙烷脱氢表现出高效率，生成丙烯的转化率达到30%，选择性超过90%。

2. 假设在反应过程中，六价铬离子以四面体配位形式存在，作为活性单重铬酸盐物种。这些离子被还原为三价铬离子，在八面体配位中，被认为是较不活跃的形式。

3. 通过氧气处理过程，可以重新激活催化剂，其中三价铬物种被氧化回六价铬物种。

4. 除了氧气之外，二氧化碳也可以从还原的三价铬六面体中再生铬(VI)O4四面体，尽管其效率低于氧气。

5. 结论是在反应过程中，丙烷经历脱氢生成丙烯，反应通过四面体铬(IV)O4进行，同时被还原为八面体铬(III)O6。
