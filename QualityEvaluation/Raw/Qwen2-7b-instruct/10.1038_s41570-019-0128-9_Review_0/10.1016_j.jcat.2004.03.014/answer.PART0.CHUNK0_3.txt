[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
[4] "Not only gaseous oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

1. Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenges involve finding the right balance between these factors to optimize overall performance.

2. In the context of CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, chromium oxide catalysts show high activity when supported on MCM-41 via direct hydrothermal synthesis. This process results in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%.

3. The activity of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is influenced by the coordination environment of the chromium species. During the reaction, Cr(VI) forms as an active monochromate species in tetrahedral coordination. This species is then reduced to less active Cr(III) in octahedral coordination.

4. The regeneration of the deactivated catalyst involves treatment with gaseous oxygen. This leads to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to the Cr(VI) species, which is crucial for the recovery of catalyst activity.

1. 各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2以及反应条件，包括CO2分压，对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理产生显著影响。优化整体性能的关键挑战在于找到这些因素之间的平衡。

2. 在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，通过直接水热合成在MCM-41上制备的铬氧化物催化剂显示出高活性。这一过程导致丙烯的生成，转化率为30%，选择性超过90%。

3. 在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，铬氧化物催化剂的活性受铬物种协调环境的影响。在反应过程中，Cr(VI)形成作为活性单铬酸盐物种，在四面体协调下。然后，这种物种被还原为较不活跃的Cr(III)在八面体协调下。

4. 催化剂失活的再生涉及用气体氧气处理。这导致Cr(III)物种的重新氧化回Cr(VI)物种，这对于催化剂活性的恢复至关重要。
