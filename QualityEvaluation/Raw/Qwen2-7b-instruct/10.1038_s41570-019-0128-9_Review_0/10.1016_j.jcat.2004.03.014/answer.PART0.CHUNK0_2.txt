[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
[4] "Not only gaseous oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

The dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis exhibits high activity, with a propene yield of 30% and selectivity exceeding 90%. The active chromium species are hypothesized to transition from a tetrahedral coordination of Cr(VI) to an octahedral coordination of Cr(III) during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated through treatment with gaseous oxygen, leading to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI). Carbon dioxide can also facilitate regeneration, albeit with lower efficiency compared to oxygen.

直接水热合成法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂在丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢反应中表现出高活性，丙烯产率为30%，选择性超过90%。推测，反应过程中，活性铬物种从四面体配合的Cr(VI)转化为八面体配合的Cr(III)。失活的催化剂可以通过氧气处理再生，导致Cr(III)物种氧化回Cr(VI)。二氧化碳也可以促进再生，但效率低于氧气。
