[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
[4] "Not only gaseous oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."
[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
[6] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

1. Chromium MCM-41 catalysts synthesized through direct hydrothermal process exhibited high efficiency in the CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane, producing propene with a conversion of 30% and selectivity over 90%.

2. The active chromium species in the tetrahedral coordination form monochromate ions, which get reduced to less active polychromate ions in octahedral coordination during the reaction.

3. Deactivated catalysts regain their activity through oxygen treatment, where the reduction of Cr(III) ions back to Cr(VI) ions occurs.

4. Both oxygen and CO2 can regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, albeit with CO2 being less efficient.

5. Propane is converted to propene through the action of Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which simultaneously gets reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra.

6. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be oxidized back to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by CO2, highlighting the role of the reduction-oxidation cycle in the CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41.

1. 直接水热合成的铬MCM-41催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下催化丙烷脱氢表现出高效率，产生丙烯，转化率为30%，选择性超过90%。

2. 在四面体配合物中形成的活性铬物种形成单铬酸根离子，然后在反应中被还原为在八面体配合物中形成的较不活跃的多铬酸根离子。

3. 通过氧气处理使失活的催化剂恢复活性，在此过程中Cr(III)离子被氧化回Cr(VI)离子。

4. 氧气和二氧化碳都能从还原的Cr(III)O6八面体再生Cr(VI)O4四面体，但二氧化碳的效率较低。

5. 通过Cr(IV)O4四面体的作用，丙烷转化为丙烯，同时被还原为Cr(III)O6八面体。

6. 减少的Cr(III)O6八面体可以通过二氧化碳氧化回Cr(VI)O4四面体，突显了Cr(IV)O4四面体与Cr(III)O6八面体之间的还原-氧化循环在使用Cr-MCM-41进行二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢中的重要角色。
