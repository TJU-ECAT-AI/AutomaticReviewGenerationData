[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."

[4] "Not only gaseous oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."

[6] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

1.Cr-MCM-41 catalysts exhibited high activity in the CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, yielding propene with 30% conversion and 90% selectivity.

2.During the reaction, Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination acted as an active monochromate, reducing to less active Cr(III) species in octahedral coordination.

3.Deactivated catalysts could be regenerated by treatment with oxygen, leading to the reoxidation of Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI).

4.Besides oxygen, carbon dioxide also played a role in regenerating Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, albeit with lower efficiency.

5.Propane undergoes dehydrogenation to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra.

6.Reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized by carbon dioxide to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra, highlighting the importance of the reductionoxidation cycle in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41.

1.CR-MCM-41催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢丙烷中表现出高活性，产生丙烯，转化率高达30%，选择性超过90%。

2.在反应过程中，六价铬在四面体配合物中形成作为活性单铬酸盐，随后还原为较不活跃的三价铬在八面体配合物中的多铬酸盐。

3.失活的催化剂可以通过氧气处理再生，导致三价铬物种被重新氧化回六价。

4.除了氧气，二氧化碳也能在较低效率下从还原的六价铬八面体氧化成四面体六价铬四面体。

5.丙烷通过四面体四价铬进行脱氢化，同时被还原为六价铬六面体。

6.还原的六价铬六面体可以通过二氧化碳被氧化回四面体六价铬四面体，强调了CR-MCM-41上二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中的还原氧化循环的重要性。
