[6] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

The dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis exhibits high activity, with a propene yield of 30% and selectivity exceeding 90%. The active chromium species are hypothesized to transition from a tetrahedral coordination of Cr(VI) to an octahedral coordination of Cr(III) during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated through treatment with gaseous oxygen, leading to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI). Carbon dioxide can also facilitate regeneration, albeit with lower efficiency compared to oxygen.

1. Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenges involve finding the right balance between these factors to optimize overall performance.

2. In the context of CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, chromium oxide catalysts show high activity when supported on MCM-41 via direct hydrothermal synthesis. This process results in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%.

3. The activity of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is influenced by the coordination environment of the chromium species. During the reaction, Cr(VI) forms as an active monochromate species in tetrahedral coordination. This species is then reduced to less active Cr(III) in octahedral coordination.

4. The regeneration of the deactivated catalyst involves treatment with gaseous oxygen. This leads to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to the Cr(VI) species, which is crucial for the recovery of catalyst activity.
