          [1] "The role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in various reactions, including methane coupling, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, and propane dehydrogenation, is not well understood."
          [2] "In order to reduce energy consumption of ethene production, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is proposed [eqn. (1)]."
          [3] "Recently, a great variety of catalysts have been developed and tested for this reaction."
          [4] "The activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was twice that in the absence of CO2."

          Various studies suggest that the role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in reactions such as methane coupling, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, and propane dehydrogenation is not yet fully understood. To decrease the energy consumption of ethylene production, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is proposed as a method. A wide range of catalysts have been created and evaluated for these reactions. Notably, the presence of CO2 significantly increased the activity of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts, enhancing the yield of ethene by approximately 100%. However, the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene was inhibited when Ga2O3 was loaded onto basic oxides like MgO or La2O3.

          各种研究显示，二氧化碳（CO2）在甲烷耦合、乙苯脱氢和丙烷脱氢等反应中的作用尚未完全明了。为了降低乙烯生产的能耗，提出采用乙烯氧化脱氢法。已经开发并测试了多种催化剂用于这些反应。值得注意的是，二氧化碳的存在显著提高了镓氧化物（Ga2O3）催化剂的活性，使乙烯产率增加了约100%。然而，当将Ga2O3负载到MgO或La2O3等碱性氧化物上时，乙苯脱氢作用被显著抑制。

          [1] "Ethene is predominantly produced by steam cracking of naphtha, ethane or liquid petroleum gas at high temperatures at short residence time."

          Ethene is commonly produced through steam cracking of naphtha, ethane, or liquid petroleum gas at high temperatures with a short residence time. Efforts to minimize energy consumption in ethene production have led to the proposal of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane as an alternative method. Various catalysts have been designed and evaluated for this purpose. It was found that the presence of CO2 doubled the activity of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts, significantly boosting the yield of ethene. Conversely, the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene was markedly hindered when Ga2O3 was incorporated onto basic oxides like MgO or La2O3.

          乙烯通常通过在高温短停留时间下裂解石脑油、乙烷或液化石油气生产。为了减少乙烯生产的能耗，提出了使用乙烯氧化脱氢法作为替代方法。已经设计并测试了多种催化剂用于这一目的。研究发现，二氧化碳的存在将镓氧化物（Ga2O3）催化剂的活性翻倍，显著提升了乙烯产率。相反，当将Ga2O3负载到MgO或La2O3等碱性氧化物上时，乙苯脱氢作用受到了显著抑制。

          [1] "Dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over gallium oxide in the presence of carbon dioxide gives 18.6% ethene yield with a selectivity of 94.5%."
          [2] "Ethene is predominantly produced by steam cracking of naphtha, ethane or liquid petroleum gas at high temperatures at short residence time."
          [3] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, Burch and Crabb pointed out that thermal non-catalytic oxidative cracking of propane proceeded to give propene in the same yield as compared to catalyzed runs which were operated about 50 C lower than that of non-catalyzed runs."
          [4] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for coupling of methane, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene or propane."
          [5] "The activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was twice that in the absence of CO2."

          The dehydrogenation of ethane over gallium oxide in the presence of carbon dioxide yields 18.6% ethene with a selectivity of 94.5%. This process contrasts with traditional methods of producing ethene through steam cracking of naphtha, ethane, or liquid petroleum gas at high temperatures with a short residence time. Burch and Crabb noted that thermal non-catalytic oxidative cracking of propane achieved the same yield as catalyzed runs, which were conducted at approximately 50°C lower than non-catalyzed runs. Recent efforts have explored the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for methane coupling, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, or propane dehydrogenation. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts, when exposed to CO2, exhibited twice the activity compared to those without CO2.

          在二氧化碳存在的条件下，镓氧化物上乙烷脱氢得到的乙烯产率为18.6%，选择性为94.5%。这一过程与通过高温短停留时间裂解石脑油、乙烷或液化石油气生产乙烯的传统方法有所不同。Burch和Crabb指出，非催化热氧化裂解丙烷所得到的丙烯产率与催化运行相同，后者比非催化运行低约50°C。近期的研究尝试将二氧化碳用作甲烷耦合、乙苯脱氢或丙烷脱氢的氧化剂。当镓氧化物（Ga2O3）催化剂暴露于CO2时，其活性是无CO2条件下的两倍。
