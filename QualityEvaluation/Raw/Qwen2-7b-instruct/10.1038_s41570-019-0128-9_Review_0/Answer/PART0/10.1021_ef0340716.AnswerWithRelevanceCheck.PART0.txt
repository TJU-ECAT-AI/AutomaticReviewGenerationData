          [1] "Zhang et al. recently reported using pulse corona plasma as an activation method and applied it for the reaction of CH4 and CO2 over some catalysts. The products were C2 hydrocarbons and the byproducts were CO and molecular hydrogen (H2)."
          [2] "CH4 conversion and the yield of C2 hydrocarbons were affected by the CO2 concentration in the feed. The conversion of CH4 increased as the CO2 concentration in the feed increased, while the yield of C2 hydrocarbons decreased."
          [3] "The synergism of La2O3/ γ-Al2O3 and plasma gave a CH4 conversion of 24.9% and C2 hydrocarbons yield of 18.1% were obtained at a plasma power input of 30 W."
          [4] "The distribution of C2 hydrocarbons was changed through the use of a Pd- La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, and the major C2 product was C2H4."

          The use of pulse corona plasma as an activation method in the reaction of CH4 and CO2 over certain catalysts leads to the formation of C2 hydrocarbons as primary products, along with CO and molecular hydrogen (H2) as byproducts. An increase in the CO2 concentration in the feed enhances the conversion of CH4, whereas the yield of C2 hydrocarbons decreases. A combination of La2O3/ γ-Al2O3 and plasma achieves a CH4 conversion rate of 24.9% and a C2 hydrocarbons yield of 18.1% at a plasma power input of 30 W. The application of a Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst alters the distribution of C2 hydrocarbons, with C2H4 being the predominant product.

          脉冲等离子体作为激活方法，在某些催化剂上进行的CH4和CO2反应中，可产生C2烃类作为主要产物，同时副产品为CO和分子氢（H2）。随着进料中二氧化碳浓度的增加，甲烷的转化率提高，但C2烃类的产率下降。La2O3/ γ-Al2O3和等离子体的结合在30瓦的功率输入下实现了24.9%的甲烷转化率和18.1%的C2烃类产率。应用Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3催化剂改变了C2烃类的分布，主要产物为C2H4。

          [1] "The utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the main contributors to the greenhouse effect, has been a topic of global interest, from both fundamental and practical viewpoints."
          [2] "It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
          [3] "It is generally accepted that the active sites for the activation of CH4 can be ascribed to O-(s) or O2-(s) via the reactions"
          [4] "In the presence of O2, CH3- can convert to the CH3 radicals required for dimerization to C2H6 via reaction with molecular oxygen (O2)."

          The use of carbon dioxide (CO2), a significant contributor to the greenhouse effect, has garnered global attention due to its relevance from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Recognizing that natural gas in various regions contains a substantial amount of CO2, along with CH4 and other lower alkanes, it would be highly beneficial to harness this low-value natural gas without CO2 emissions through the simultaneous conversion of CH4 and other lower alkanes into valuable chemicals or fuels. It is widely acknowledged that the active sites for the activation of CH4 can be attributed to O-(s) or O2-(s) through specific reactions. Furthermore, in the presence of oxygen (O2), CH3- can transform into the necessary CH3 radicals for the dimerization to C2H6 through a reaction with molecular oxygen (O2).

          二氧化碳（CO2），作为温室效应的主要贡献者之一，因其理论和实际意义在全球范围内引起了广泛关注。鉴于不同地区的天然气中含有大量CO2，以及CH4和其他低烷烃，通过将CH4和其他低烷烃同时转化为有价值的化学品或燃料来利用这种低价值的天然气而不排放CO2，将是极具益处的。普遍认为，CH4的活化活性位点可以通过特定反应归因于O-(s)或O2-(s)。此外，在氧气（O2）的存在下，CH3-可以通过与分子氧（O2）的反应转化为用于二聚形成C2H6所需的CH3自由基。
