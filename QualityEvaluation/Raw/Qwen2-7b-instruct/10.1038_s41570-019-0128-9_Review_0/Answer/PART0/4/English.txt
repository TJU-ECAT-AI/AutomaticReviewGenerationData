The mechanism of C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves the primary activation of C3H8 on the catalyst surface, with CO2 contributing to the reaction equilibrium shift by oxidizing H2 produced from the C3H8 dehydrogenation (through the reverse water gas shift reaction). The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) calculations for the reactions in the modelled system indicate that further cracking of C3H6 will impact the final products' yield and selectivity. The thermodynamic analysis conducted across a comprehensive reaction system encompasses all possible by-products, including the generation of carbon, to provide a detailed view of the dehydrogenation process. In reality, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is a complex process involving multiple reactions, as detailed in Table 2.
