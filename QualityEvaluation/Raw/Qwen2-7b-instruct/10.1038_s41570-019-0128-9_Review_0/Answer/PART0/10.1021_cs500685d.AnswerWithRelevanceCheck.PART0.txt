          [1] "The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts."
          [2] "Ethane conversion and ethene selectivity showed a clear interdependence, higher ethane conversion resulting in lower ethene selectivity."
          [3] "Carbon deposition on the catalyst surface increased with increasing Ga loading, as indicated by the thermoanalytical results shown in Figure 7b."
          [4] "The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles."
          [5] "The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts."
          [6] "The ethene yield increased with Ga loading up to about 10 wt %. The molar CO2/C2H6 ratio in the feed, reaction temperature, and space velocity were decisive parameters for achieving maximum ethene yield."
          [7] "Severe coking on the catalyst surface is the major reason for its deactivation, requiring further investigation."
          [8] "Both commercial Ga2O3 and the 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts showed very high initial conversion (around 90%); however, the activity also declined with time on stream (Figure 14b), but less rapidly."

          The influence of gallium (Ga) loading and reaction conditions, including the CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, and space velocity, on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of the catalysts was a central focus. Ethane conversion and ethene selectivity demonstrated a clear interdependency, with higher ethane conversion leading to lower ethene selectivity. Carbon deposition on the catalyst surface increased with increasing Ga loading, as indicated by the thermoeanalytical results. The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration process suggested the potential for developing dynamic processes involving alternating reaction and regeneration cycles. The molar CO2/C2H6 ratio, temperature, and space velocity were critical factors for achieving the highest ethene yield. Severe coking on the catalyst surface was identified as the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. Both commercial Ga2O3 and the 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts exhibited high initial conversion rates, with activity declining over time on stream, albeit at a slower rate compared to regeneration.

          研究重点是考察不同镓（Ga）负载和反应条件，如CO2/C2H6进料比、温度和空速，对催化剂性能、失活和再生行为的影响。乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性之间存在明显的相互依赖关系，乙烷转化率越高，乙烯选择性越低。随着Ga负载量的增加，催化剂表面的碳沉积量也相应增加，这是由热分析结果证明的。催化剂再生过程的简便性和效率为开发涉及交替反应和再生循环的动态过程提供了基础。CO2/C2H6进料比、温度和空速是实现最高乙烯产率的关键因素。催化剂表面严重的焦炭沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因，需要进一步研究。商业Ga2O3和10% Ga/TiO2催化剂的初始转化率均很高，但在时间上流过程中活性逐渐下降，但再生过程的速率较慢。

          [1] "The catalyst regenerability experiments were performed using two different oxidants, CO2 and synthetic air (O2  20% balance N2), keeping the aforementioned reaction conditions constant."
          [2] "The regeneration of the flame-made 10% Ga/TiO2 catalyst was accomplished by oxidizing (gasifying) the carbon deposits using synthetic air after each cycle (90 min time on stream)."
          [3] "The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles."

          Catalyst regeneration experiments were conducted using two different oxidants: CO2 and synthetic air (with O2 at 20% balance N2), with the reaction conditions kept constant. The regeneration of the flame-made 10% Ga/TiO2 catalyst involved oxidizing (gasifying) the carbon deposits with synthetic air after each cycle, lasting 90 minutes. The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration process could serve as a foundation for developing dynamic processes that alternate between reaction and regeneration cycles.

          催化剂再生实验使用了两种不同的氧化剂：CO2和合成空气（氧气占20%平衡N2），保持反应条件不变。火焰制备的10% Ga/TiO2催化剂的再生过程是在每次循环后使用合成空气氧化（气化）碳沉积物，持续90分钟。催化剂再生过程的简便性和效率可作为开发涉及交替反应和再生循环动态过程的基础。
