          Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 significantly affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Different reaction conditions, especially CO2 partial pressure, greatly impact the overall performance of these catalysts. Optimizing the performance of these catalysts involves striking a balance between activity, selectivity, and stability, and dealing with trade-offs between these properties often necessitates careful selection of conditions and materials.
