Ethene is commonly produced through steam cracking of naphtha, ethane, or liquid petroleum gas at high temperatures with a short residence time. Efforts to minimize energy consumption in ethene production have led to the proposal of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane as an alternative method. Various catalysts have been designed and evaluated for this purpose. It was found that the presence of CO2 doubled the activity of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts, significantly boosting the yield of ethene. Conversely, the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene was markedly hindered when Ga2O3 was incorporated onto basic oxides like MgO or La2O3.

Different support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 have been assessed for their impact on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanism of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The effect of CO2 partial pressure on the overall performance of these catalysts was also explored.

The most active and stable catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, as well as heavier alkanes like heptane, are manganese oxide-based catalysts. The 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst achieved a high C2H6 conversion rate of 73.1% and CO2 conversion rate of 49.0% at 800°C, with a CO:C:H6 ratio of 1.5. For propane conversion with CO2, the best catalyst is 1.5% K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2, which shows high selectivity. The redox mechanism of manganese carbonate decomposition on the MnO-CrO phase boundary is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The conversion rates for propane with CO2 are comparable to those for ethane transformation, indicating a similar mechanism. The rate of selective transformation of propane into ethylene is described by an equation akin to equation (10).

The use of carbon dioxide (CO2), a significant contributor to the greenhouse effect, has garnered global attention due to its relevance from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Recognizing that natural gas in various regions contains a substantial amount of CO2, along with CH4 and other lower alkanes, it would be highly beneficial to harness this low-value natural gas without CO2 emissions through the simultaneous conversion of CH4 and other lower alkanes into valuable chemicals or fuels. It is widely acknowledged that the active sites for the activation of CH4 can be attributed to O-(s) or O2-(s) through specific reactions. Furthermore, in the presence of oxygen (O2), CH3- can transform into the necessary CH3 radicals for the dimerization to C2H6 through a reaction with molecular oxygen (O2).

Various support materials such as SiO2, Al2O3, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, along with different reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Among these, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed unique promoting effects from CO2, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance involve balancing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability while navigating the complex interactions between the support material, reactants, and reaction conditions. Further research is needed to understand the detailed mechanisms and to develop more efficient catalysts for CO2 utilization.

The dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an attractive process for producing propylene (C3H6). Thermodynamic calculations suggest that further cracking of propylene might affect the yield and selectivity of the final products. Increasing the propane partial pressure leads to a reduction in its conversion rate, but this also results in a notable enhancement of propylene selectivity. The shift of the equilibrium state towards the products in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been confirmed through thermodynamic analysis. The thermodynamic analysis conducted across a comprehensive reaction system covers all possible by-products, including the generation of carbon, to provide a more accurate picture of the dehydrogenation process. In reality, the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 is a complex process involving multiple reactions, as detailed in Table 2.

Catalyst regeneration experiments were conducted using two different oxidants: CO2 and synthetic air (with O2 at 20% balance N2), with the reaction conditions kept constant. The regeneration of the flame-made 10% Ga/TiO2 catalyst involved oxidizing (gasifying) the carbon deposits with synthetic air after each cycle, lasting 90 minutes. The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration process could serve as a foundation for developing dynamic processes that alternate between reaction and regeneration cycles.

The document highlights that previous studies on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes using CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures have provided valuable insights. However, the operational conditions used in these studies were tailored to specific research objectives rather than aiming for industrial relevance. Industrial processes typically require conversion rates greater than 50% and total olefin selectivities above 90%. Various alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 in CO2 presence, but the most effective performance was achieved with chromium supported on different types of oxides, zeolites, activated carbon, and diamond. Among the supported systems, the most promising results were observed for SiO2, particularly in a mesoporous form, and diamond, both loaded with chromium at a weight percentage range of 1.7 to 8.0%. The thermodynamic estimation of the process has been carried out based on the reaction CnH2n2 → CO2 + CnH2n + CO + H2O. Different reaction pathways and equilibrium yields have been reported in the literature for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The equilibrium constants (Kp) at various temperatures were calculated through an equation derived from the van't Hoff isotherm integration between T0 and T. The features of supported chromium species have been evaluated using diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (DR UVvis) to understand their structure-function relationships.

With both catalysts present, the conversion of ethene increases, highlighting that the CO2 dissociation reaction follows Equation (1), with its conversion equal to or exceeding that of ethane. On pure ceria, the formation rate of CO surpasses that of ethene. The introduction of calcium ions in the cubic structure of CeO2 significantly boosts the selectivity for olefin formation. This reaction exhibits a high degree of selectivity towards C2H4 formation in the heterogeneous reaction, which can exceed 90% under appropriate catalyst composition and reaction conditions, with CO being the exclusive non-selective product besides water.

It is widely acknowledged that the active sites for the activation of CH4 can be attributed to O-(s) or O2-(s) through specific reactions. Furthermore, in the presence of oxygen (O2), CH3- can transform into the necessary CH3 radicals for the dimerization to C2H6 through a reaction with molecular oxygen (O2).

Various support materials such as SiO2, Al2O3, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, along with different reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Among these, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed unique promoting effects from CO2, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance involve balancing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability while navigating the complex interactions between the support material, reactants, and reaction conditions. Further research is needed to understand the detailed mechanisms and to develop more efficient catalysts for CO2 utilization.

The dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an attractive process for producing propylene (C3H6). Thermodynamic calculations suggest that further cracking of propylene might affect the yield and selectivity of the final products. Increasing the propane partial pressure leads to a reduction in its conversion rate, but this also results in a notable enhancement of propylene selectivity. The shift of the equilibrium state towards the products in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been confirmed through thermodynamic analysis. The thermodynamic analysis conducted across a comprehensive reaction system covers all possible by-products, including the generation of carbon, to provide a more accurate picture of the dehydrogenation process. In reality, the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 is a complex process involving multiple reactions, as detailed in Table 2.

Catalyst regeneration experiments were conducted using two different oxidants: CO2 and synthetic air (with O2 at 20% balance N2), with the reaction conditions kept constant. The regeneration of the flame-made 10% Ga/TiO2 catalyst involved oxidizing (gasifying) the carbon deposits with synthetic air after each cycle, lasting 90 minutes. The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration process could serve as a foundation for developing dynamic processes that alternate between reaction and regeneration cycles.

The document highlights that previous studies on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes using CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures have provided valuable insights. However, the operational conditions used in these studies were tailored to specific research objectives rather than aiming for industrial relevance. Industrial processes typically require conversion rates greater than 50% and total olefin selectivities above 90%. Various alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 in CO2 presence, but the most effective performance was achieved with chromium supported on different types of oxides, zeolites, activated carbon, and diamond. Among the supported systems, the most promising results were observed for SiO2, particularly in a mesoporous form, and diamond, both loaded with chromium at a weight percentage range of 1.7 to 8.0%. The thermodynamic estimation of the process has been carried out based on the reaction CnH2n2 → CO2 + CnH2n + CO + H2O. Different reaction pathways and equilibrium yields have been reported in the literature for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The equilibrium constants (Kp) at various temperatures were calculated through an equation derived from the van't Hoff isotherm integration between T0 and T. The features of supported chromium species have been evaluated using diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (DR UVvis) to understand their structure-function relationships.

With both catalysts present, the conversion of ethene increases, highlighting that the CO2 dissociation reaction follows Equation (1), with its conversion equal to or exceeding that of ethane. On pure ceria, the formation rate of CO surpasses that of ethene. The introduction of calcium ions in the cubic structure of CeO2 significantly boosts the selectivity for olefin formation. This reaction exhibits a high degree of selectivity towards C2H4 formation in the heterogeneous reaction, which can exceed 90% under appropriate catalyst composition and reaction conditions, with CO being the exclusive non-selective product besides water.

Ethene is commonly produced through steam cracking of naphtha, ethane, or liquid petroleum gas at high temperatures with a short residence time. Efforts to minimize energy consumption in ethene production have led to the proposal of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane as an alternative method. Various catalysts have been designed and evaluated for this purpose. It was found that the presence of CO2 doubled the activity of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts, significantly boosting the yield of ethene. Conversely, the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene was markedly hindered when Ga2O3 was incorporated onto basic oxides like MgO or La2O3.

Different support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 have been assessed for their impact on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanism of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The effect of CO2 partial pressure on the overall performance of these catalysts was also explored.

The most active and stable catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, as well as heavier alkanes like heptane, are manganese oxide-based catalysts. The 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst achieved a high C2H6 conversion rate of 73.1% and CO2 conversion rate of 49.0% at 800°C, with a CO:C:H6 ratio of 1.5. For propane conversion with CO2, the best catalyst is 1.5% K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2, which shows high selectivity. The redox mechanism of manganese carbonate decomposition on the MnO-CrO phase boundary is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The conversion rates for propane with CO2 are comparable to those for ethane transformation, indicating a similar mechanism. The rate of selective transformation of propane into ethylene is described by an equation akin to equation (10).
