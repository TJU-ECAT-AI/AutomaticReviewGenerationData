The dehydrogenation of ethane over gallium oxide in the presence of carbon dioxide yields 18.6% ethene with a selectivity of 94.5%. This process contrasts with traditional methods of producing ethene through steam cracking of naphtha, ethane, or liquid petroleum gas at high temperatures with a short residence time. Burch and Crabb noted that thermal non-catalytic oxidative cracking of propane achieved the same yield as catalyzed runs, which were conducted at approximately 50°C lower than non-catalyzed runs. Recent efforts have explored the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for methane coupling, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, or propane dehydrogenation. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts, when exposed to CO2, exhibited twice the activity compared to those without CO2.

Increasing the partial pressure of C3H8 led to a decrease in its conversion rate, but importantly, it significantly improved the selectivity of C3H6 production. From a thermodynamic analysis, it has been identified that the equilibrium state shifts in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 due to the presence of CO2. The high stability of C3H8 conversion in each test confirmed the robustness and longevity of the catalyst. The peak at 2θ=36.18 corresponds to the (1-1-0) phase of Cr2O3 with rhombohedral crystal structure. The weight loss starting from 200°C is attributed to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air.

The document highlights that previous studies on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes using CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures have provided valuable insights. However, the operational conditions used in these studies were tailored to specific research objectives rather than aiming for industrial relevance. Industrial processes typically require conversion rates greater than 50% and total olefin selectivities above 90%. Among the tested materials, alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 in CO2 presence. The best performance was achieved with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond. A study was conducted on a series of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, tested for their catalytic performance in the ODH of propane and isobutane at high conversions. The highest activity, selectivity, and stability were demonstrated by a catalyst with a chromium loading of 5.0 wt%. The tests were carried out using both CO2 only and CO2/O2 mixtures as oxidants.
