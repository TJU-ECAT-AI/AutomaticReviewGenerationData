            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/0920-5861(95)00061-j\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\], \[10.1021/ef0340716\], and \[10.1039/a800184g\]. The influence of support materials (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2) and CO2 partial pressure significantly influences chromium oxide catalysts' activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation. Key challenges in optimization involve balancing these factors. MnO-based catalysts demonstrate high efficiency, as exemplified by 73.1% C2H6 conversion and 49.0% CO2 conversion at 800°C, 3600 hour⁻¹, and CO:C2H6 = 1.5. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing efficient CO2 utilization processes. The choice of support materials and conditions is pivotal for achieving optimal catalytic performance.

            The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

            Research focused on preparing chromium oxide catalysts on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. Various supports (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2) and CO2 partial pressure influenced catalyst activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways. Challenges in optimizing overall performance were acknowledged, highlighting the importance of these factors in enhancing CO2-ODH reaction efficiency.

            Insights into the nature of catalytically active Chromium sites were provided. Preparation of highly dispersed Chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 was detailed. Reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure influenced the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways.

            The role of carbon dioxide in various reactions, including methane coupling, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, and propane dehydrogenation, is not well understood. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is proposed to reduce ethylene production's energy consumption. A broad spectrum of catalysts has been developed for these reactions. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts' activity doubles in CO2 presence, boosting ethene yield by 100%. However, CO2 inhibits ethylbenzene dehydrogenation when loaded onto basic oxides like MgO or La2O3.

            Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953-993 K. The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significantly the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as an oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction. Ceria plays the role of a redox catalyst and its redox properties and ability to store and release oxygen are seen when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE. 

            The state of chromium depends on the nature of support used. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the highest ethylene formation rates compared to CrOx/CeO2. The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 showed the highest ethylene formation rates. The catalyst's state depends on the nature of the support, particularly its acid-base and red-ox properties, influencing the reaction pathway and stability.

            The results described above obtained during the investigation of the reaction of C1-C7 alkanes with CO2 on oxide catalysts show different mechanisms for lower and higher alkanes. The acidic properties of CO2 necessitate the choice of a catalyst with basic properties.

            The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts. Ethane conversion and ethene selectivity showed a clear interdependence, higher ethane conversion resulting in lower ethene selectivity. Carbon deposition on the catalyst surface increased with increasing Ga loading, as indicated by the thermoanalytical results shown in Figure 7b. The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles. Both commercial Ga2O3 and the 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts showed very high initial conversion (around 90%); however, the activity also declined with time on stream (Figure 14b), but less rapidly.

            The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts. The tests has been carried out by using as oxidant both CO2 only and CO2/O2 mixture. Diffuse Reflectance UVvis spectroscopy (DR UVvis) measurements were performed with a PerkinElmer Lambda19 instrument equipped with an integrating sphere with the internal surface covered with BaSO4. The composition of the reaction feed was CnH2n+2:CO2:N2 = 1:2:3.7 or CnH2n+2:CO2:O2:N2 = 1:2:0.3:3.4. In the present case the thermodynamic estimation of the process has been modelled on the reaction: CnH2n2 → CO2 → CnH2n → CO → H2O (1). The values of the equilibrium constant (Kp) at various temperatures were calculated by using the following equation, resulting from the integration of the vant Hoff isochore between T0 and T: ln KT p.

Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

Different reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, have a significant impact on the overall performance of the catalysts. Key challenges in optimizing the performance of these catalysts include finding the right balance between activity, selectivity, and stability. Trade-offs between these properties often arise, requiring careful selection of conditions and materials.
