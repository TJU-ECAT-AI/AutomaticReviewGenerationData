The influence of support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, along with CO2 partial pressure, on chromium oxide catalysts' activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions was explored. Key findings include the interdependence between ethane conversion and ethene selectivity, where higher ethane conversion leads to lower ethene selectivity. Increased Ga loading results in enhanced carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, impacting its deactivation. The ease of catalyst regeneration suggests potential for dynamic processes. Critical parameters for achieving maximum ethene yield include the molar CO2/C2H6 ratio, temperature, and space velocity. Severe coking on the catalyst surface is the main cause of deactivation, requiring further investigation. Commercial Ga2O3 and 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts show high initial conversion but decline in activity over time, indicating the need for efficient regeneration strategies.

            The study focused on preparing chromium oxide catalysts on mesoporous silica for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, examining various support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2. CO2 partial pressure influenced catalyst activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing performance were identified, with insights into active chromium sites and the preparation of highly dispersed catalysts.

            The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the highest ethylene formation rates. The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 showed the highest ethylene formation rates. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst contains amorphous chromium oxide in both CrV/VI and CrII/III states. CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst is characterized by formation of ethylene during the selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) accompanied by RWGS. CrOx/CeO2 catalyst possesses the lowest rate of ethylene formation. CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalyst is characterized by slightly faster deactivation than CrOx/CeO2. The state of chromium depends on the nature of support used. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is characterized by formation of ethylene during the direct dehydrogenation (DDH) accompanied by RWGS. CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst is characterized by selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is characterized by difficulties of surface re-oxidation by CO2. CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalyst contains chromium mainly in a high valence state. CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is characterized by the formation of α-Cr2O3 phase. CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalyst contains chromium mainly in a high valence state.

            Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 were investigated for their influence on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts were found to be significantly influenced by the type of support material used. Influence of CO2 partial pressure on the performance of chromium oxide catalysts was also studied. Different reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, have a significant impact on the overall performance of the catalysts. Key challenges in optimizing the performance of these catalysts include finding the right balance between activity, selectivity, and stability. Trade-offs between these properties often arise, requiring careful selection of conditions and materials.

            An important outcome is the great potential of propane as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range. The results revealed effective propane conversions at each specified condition while the C3H6 selectivity drops at the beginning of reactions. The high stability of the propane conversion, as shown in Figure 7. The peak at 2θ=36.18 corresponds to the 1-1-0 phase of Cr2O3 with rhombohedral crystal symmetry. The weight loss starting from 200 we attribute to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air.

            Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K. The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significatively the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as an oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction. In the ODE with CO2 over CeO2 catalyst, CeO2 plays the role of a redox catalyst. The redox properties and the ability to store and release oxygen of CeO2 are also seen when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE. The selectivity to C2H4 of the heterogeneous reaction can be higher than 90% under a proper catalyst composition and reaction condition, and that in addition to H2O, CO is the only non-selective product. Ceria-based catalysts are able to activate CO2 and to use it as a selective oxidant for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane.

            Because of such composition natural gas is one of the cleanest of all primary fossil fuels for both the production of energy and the production of other valuable molecules, like olefins. Unfortunately, direct dehydrogenation (DD) of alkanes is a highly endothermic reaction (e.g., for propane DH298 K = +124.2 kJ/mol) and to reach high conversions the shift of the equilibrium, by decreasing the pressure or increasing the temperature, is required. A way to overcome thermodynamic restrictions is the removal of hydrogen from the reaction system by adding a suitable oxidant. Hence, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes by using O2 has become the object of many investigations as an alternative process. However, ODH of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (e.g., for propane DH298 K = +166.6 kJ/mol), thus the addition of a small amount of oxygen decreases the energy demand. Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7 21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent [17,2229].

            The tests has been carried out by using as oxidant both CO2 only and CO2/O2 mixture. Diffuse Reflectance UVvis spectroscopy (DR UVvis) measurements were performed with a PerkinElmer Lambda19 instrument equipped with an integrating sphere with the internal surface covered with BaSO4. The composition of the reaction feed was CnH2n+2:CO2:N2 = 1:2:3.7 or CnH2n+2:CO2:O2:N2 = 1:2:0.3:3.4. In the present case the thermodynamic estimation of the process has been modelled on the reaction: CnH2n2  CO2  CnH2n  CO  H2O (1) The values of the equilibrium constant (Kp) at various temperatures were calculated by using the following equation, resulting from the integration of the vant Hoff isochore between T0 and T: ln KT p

            The integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on leveraging the synergies between different catalyst components and reaction conditions to optimize the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation. Potential areas for exploration could include the development of new support materials that enhance stability and activity, the optimization of reaction conditions for maximizing product selectivity and yield, and the integration of advanced spectroscopic techniques for real-time monitoring and control. Additionally, there is a need for more systematic studies on the mechanistic pathways involved in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation, which could provide deeper insights into the fundamental chemistry and guide the design of more efficient catalyst systems.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/cs500685d\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/ef0340716\] and \[10.3389/fenrg.2015.00013\]. The influence of support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is significant. Higher Ga loading leads to increased carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, affecting deactivation. The ease and efficiency of catalyst regeneration suggest potential for dynamic processes involving alternating reaction and regeneration cycles. The molar CO2/C2H6 ratio, temperature, and space velocity are crucial for achieving the highest ethene yield. Severe coking on the catalyst surface is the primary cause of deactivation, requiring further investigation. Commercial Ga2O3 and 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts exhibit high initial conversion but decline in activity over time, with regeneration efficiency offering a base for developing dynamic processes.

            The role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in various reactions, including methane coupling, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, and propane dehydrogenation, is not well understood. In order to reduce energy consumption of ethene production, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is proposed. Recently, a great variety of catalysts have been developed and tested for this reaction. The activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was twice that in the absence of CO2. Dehydrogenation of C2H6 was strongly inhibited when Ga2O3 was impregnated onto a basic oxide such as MgO or La2O3.

            The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation.

            The study examines the preparation of chromium oxide catalysts on mesoporous silica for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 were studied. Reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure influenced the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance were identified.

            An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range. The results revealed effective C3H8 conversions at each specified condition while the C3H6 selectivity drops at the beginning of reactions. The high stability of the C3H8 conversion, as shown in Figure 7.

            In CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation, pulse corona plasma activates CH4 and CO2 reactions, yielding C2 hydrocarbons, CO, and H2. Increasing CO2 concentration boosts CH4 conversion but reduces C2 hydrocarbon yield. Combining La2O3/γ-Al2O3 with plasma achieves a 24.9% CH4 conversion and 18.1% C2 hydrocarbon yield at 30 W. A Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shifts C2 product distribution, favoring C2H4.

            The redox properties and the ability to store and release oxygen of CeO2 are also seen when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE. Ceria-based catalysts are able to activate CO2 and to use it as a selective oxidant for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane. Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K. The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significatively the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction.

            The acidic properties of CO2 necessitate the choice of a catalyst with basic properties. Manganese oxides containing catalysts are effective both for methane transformation into synthesis gas and for C2-C7 alkanes dehydrogenation and oxidative cracking. The most active and stable catalysts for the reactions were also manganese oxides based catalysts. On the 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst, C2H6 conversion of 73.1% and CO2 conversion of 49.0% were observed at 800°C, V = 3600 hour-1 and CO:C:H6 = 1.5.

            The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the highest ethylene formation rates. The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 showed the highest ethylene formation rates. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity, and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst contains amorphous chromium oxide in both CrV/VI and CrII/III states. CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst is characterized by formation of ethylene during the selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) accompanied by RWGS.

            The CO2 molecule can be used as a non-traditional oxidant. Manganese oxides containing catalysts are effective both for methane transformation into synthesis gas and for C2-C7 alkanes dehydrogenation and oxidative cracking. The acidic properties of CO2 necessitate the choice of a catalyst with basic properties. The study highlights the potential of C3H8 in terms of CO2 activation and coking resistance, as well as the observed conversion and selectivity trends.

            Insight into the nature of catalytically active Chromium sites. Preparation of highly dispersed Chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. The most active and stable catalysts for the reactions were also manganese oxides based catalysts.

            The state of chromium depends on the nature of support used. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is characterized by formation of ethylene during the direct dehydrogenation (DDH) accompanied by RWGS. CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst is characterized by selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is characterized by difficulties of surface re-oxidation by CO2. CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalyst contains chromium mainly in a high valence state.

            The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the interplay between support materials, reaction conditions, and catalyst properties in optimizing the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Challenges in this area include balancing activity, selectivity, and stability, and finding the right balance between these factors often requires careful selection of conditions and materials. Future research efforts might focus on exploring new support materials and catalyst designs, as well as developing more efficient and selective reaction conditions to improve the overall performance of these catalysts.

The influence of support materials (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2) and CO2 partial pressure significantly influences chromium oxide catalysts' activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation. Key challenges in optimization involve balancing these factors. MnO-based catalysts demonstrate high efficiency, as exemplified by 73.1% C2H6 conversion and 49.0% CO2 conversion at 800°C, 3600 hour⁻¹, and CO:C2H6 = 1.5. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing efficient CO2 utilization processes. The choice of support materials and conditions is pivotal for achieving optimal catalytic performance.

            The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

            Research focused on preparing chromium oxide catalysts on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. Various supports (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2) and CO2 partial pressure influenced catalyst activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways. Challenges in optimizing overall performance were acknowledged, highlighting the importance of these factors in enhancing CO2-ODH reaction efficiency.

            Insights into the nature of catalytically active Chromium sites were provided. Preparation of highly dispersed Chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 was detailed. Reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure influenced the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways.

            The role of carbon dioxide in various reactions, including methane coupling, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, and propane dehydrogenation, is not well understood. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is proposed to reduce ethylene production's energy consumption. A broad spectrum of catalysts has been developed for these reactions. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts' activity doubles in CO2 presence, boosting ethene yield by 100%. However, CO2 inhibits ethylbenzene dehydrogenation when loaded onto basic oxides like MgO or La2O3.

            Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953-993 K. The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significantly the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as an oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction. Ceria plays the role of a redox catalyst and its redox properties and ability to store and release oxygen are seen when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE. 

            The state of chromium depends on the nature of support used. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the highest ethylene formation rates compared to CrOx/CeO2. The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 showed the highest ethylene formation rates. The catalyst's state depends on the nature of the support, particularly its acid-base and red-ox properties, influencing the reaction pathway and stability.

            The results described above obtained during the investigation of the reaction of C1-C7 alkanes with CO2 on oxide catalysts show different mechanisms for lower and higher alkanes. The acidic properties of CO2 necessitate the choice of a catalyst with basic properties.

            The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts. Ethane conversion and ethene selectivity showed a clear interdependence, higher ethane conversion resulting in lower ethene selectivity. Carbon deposition on the catalyst surface increased with increasing Ga loading, as indicated by the thermoanalytical results shown in Figure 7b. The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles. Both commercial Ga2O3 and the 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts showed very high initial conversion (around 90%); however, the activity also declined with time on stream (Figure 14b), but less rapidly.

            The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts. The tests has been carried out by using as oxidant both CO2 only and CO2/O2 mixture. Diffuse Reflectance UVvis spectroscopy (DR UVvis) measurements were performed with a PerkinElmer Lambda19 instrument equipped with an integrating sphere with the internal surface covered with BaSO4. The composition of the reaction feed was CnH2n+2:CO2:N2 = 1:2:3.7 or CnH2n+2:CO2:O2:N2 = 1:2:0.3:3.4. In the present case the thermodynamic estimation of the process has been modelled on the reaction: CnH2n2 → CO2 → CnH2n → CO → H2O (1). The values of the equilibrium constant (Kp) at various temperatures were calculated by using the following equation, resulting from the integration of the vant Hoff isochore between T0 and T: ln KT p.

This study highlighted the critical role of these factors in optimizing the overall performance of the catalysts. Specifically, the use of specific support materials and precise CO2 partial pressures led to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability, as evidenced by the high conversion of propane to propylene and the effective suppression of coke formation, as confirmed in reference \[10.1039/c5fd00062a\].

            The comprehensive understanding of how support materials and reaction conditions impact the performance, stability, and mechanistic behavior of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions was provided by the study in reference \[10.1021/cs300198u\]. The research demonstrated that the preparation of highly dispersed chromium oxide catalysts on mesoporous silica could effectively facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with the CO2 partial pressure playing a pivotal role in influencing the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of the catalysts.

            The study in reference \[10.1021/cs500685d\] focused on the effect of gallium (Ga) loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of chromium oxide catalysts. It was observed that higher Ga loading led to increased carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, affecting its efficiency. However, the study also emphasized the importance of understanding the active Chromium sites for the design and optimization of these catalysts, which is essential for improving their performance in CO2-ODH reactions.

Ceria catalysts were found to be highly active and selective for the ODE process with CO2, with the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis reaching up to 7555%. The presence of calcium ions in the ceria network was noted to significantly increase the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as an oxidant.

            The role of CO2 in various reactions, including propane dehydrogenation, was explored in reference \[10.1039/a800184g\]. The study revealed that the use of CO2 as a non-traditional oxidant in CO2-ODH reactions can significantly enhance the activity of catalysts like gallium oxide (Ga2O3), leading to doubled activity compared to reactions without CO2. This highlights the potential of CO2 in catalytic reactions, particularly in overcoming thermodynamic limitations associated with endothermic processes.

            In summary, the influence of support materials and reaction conditions on the performance, stability, and mechanistic behavior of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions is a multifaceted topic. The literature indicates that careful selection of support materials and optimization of reaction conditions can lead to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability, making these catalysts more effective for CO2 utilization in various dehydrogenation processes.
