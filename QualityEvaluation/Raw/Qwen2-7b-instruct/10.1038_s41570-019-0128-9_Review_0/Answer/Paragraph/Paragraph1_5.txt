            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/cs500685d\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/ef0340716\] and \[10.3389/fenrg.2015.00013\]. The influence of support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is significant. Higher Ga loading leads to increased carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, affecting deactivation. The ease and efficiency of catalyst regeneration suggest potential for dynamic processes involving alternating reaction and regeneration cycles. The molar CO2/C2H6 ratio, temperature, and space velocity are crucial for achieving the highest ethene yield. Severe coking on the catalyst surface is the primary cause of deactivation, requiring further investigation. Commercial Ga2O3 and 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts exhibit high initial conversion but decline in activity over time, with regeneration efficiency offering a base for developing dynamic processes.

            The role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in various reactions, including methane coupling, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, and propane dehydrogenation, is not well understood. In order to reduce energy consumption of ethene production, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is proposed. Recently, a great variety of catalysts have been developed and tested for this reaction. The activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was twice that in the absence of CO2. Dehydrogenation of C2H6 was strongly inhibited when Ga2O3 was impregnated onto a basic oxide such as MgO or La2O3.

            The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation.

            The study examines the preparation of chromium oxide catalysts on mesoporous silica for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 were studied. Reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure influenced the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance were identified.

            An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range. The results revealed effective C3H8 conversions at each specified condition while the C3H6 selectivity drops at the beginning of reactions. The high stability of the C3H8 conversion, as shown in Figure 7.

            In CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation, pulse corona plasma activates CH4 and CO2 reactions, yielding C2 hydrocarbons, CO, and H2. Increasing CO2 concentration boosts CH4 conversion but reduces C2 hydrocarbon yield. Combining La2O3/γ-Al2O3 with plasma achieves a 24.9% CH4 conversion and 18.1% C2 hydrocarbon yield at 30 W. A Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shifts C2 product distribution, favoring C2H4.

            The redox properties and the ability to store and release oxygen of CeO2 are also seen when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE. Ceria-based catalysts are able to activate CO2 and to use it as a selective oxidant for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane. Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K. The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significatively the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction.

            The acidic properties of CO2 necessitate the choice of a catalyst with basic properties. Manganese oxides containing catalysts are effective both for methane transformation into synthesis gas and for C2-C7 alkanes dehydrogenation and oxidative cracking. The most active and stable catalysts for the reactions were also manganese oxides based catalysts. On the 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst, C2H6 conversion of 73.1% and CO2 conversion of 49.0% were observed at 800°C, V = 3600 hour-1 and CO:C:H6 = 1.5.

            The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the highest ethylene formation rates. The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 showed the highest ethylene formation rates. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity, and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst contains amorphous chromium oxide in both CrV/VI and CrII/III states. CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst is characterized by formation of ethylene during the selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) accompanied by RWGS.

            The CO2 molecule can be used as a non-traditional oxidant. Manganese oxides containing catalysts are effective both for methane transformation into synthesis gas and for C2-C7 alkanes dehydrogenation and oxidative cracking. The acidic properties of CO2 necessitate the choice of a catalyst with basic properties. The study highlights the potential of C3H8 in terms of CO2 activation and coking resistance, as well as the observed conversion and selectivity trends.

            Insight into the nature of catalytically active Chromium sites. Preparation of highly dispersed Chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. The most active and stable catalysts for the reactions were also manganese oxides based catalysts. On the 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst, C2H6 conversion of 73.1% and CO2 conversion of 49.0% were observed at 800°C, V = 3600 hour-1 and CO:C:H6 = 1.5.

            The state of chromium depends on the nature of support used. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is characterized by formation of ethylene during the direct dehydrogenation (DDH) accompanied by RWGS. CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst is characterized by selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is characterized by difficulties of surface re-oxidation by CO2. CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalyst contains chromium mainly in a high valence state.

            The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the interplay between support materials, reaction conditions, and catalyst properties in optimizing the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Challenges in this area include balancing activity, selectivity, and stability, and finding the right balance between these factors often requires careful selection of conditions and materials. Future research efforts might focus on exploring new support materials and catalyst designs, as well as developing more efficient and selective reaction conditions to improve the overall performance of these catalysts.
