Catalytic Conversion of Alkanes to Olefins by Carbon Dioxide Oxidative DehydrogenationsA Review Shaobin Wang* and Z. H. Zhu Department of Chemical Engineering, Curtin University of Technology, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia Received October 16, 2003. Revised Manuscript Received April 15, 2004 The utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the main contributors to the greenhouse effect, has been a topic of global interest, from both fundamental and practical viewpoints. In addition to be the sources of carbon, CO2 might also be utilized as an oxygen source or oxidant,because it can be considered to be a nontraditional (mild) oxidant and oxygen transfer agent. In this paper, CO2 as an oxidant for the selective oxidative conversions of alkanes to alkenes has been reviewed, including methane coupling to ethylene, C2-C4 alkanes dehydrogenation to their corresponding olefins, dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene, and dehydroge- nation of ethylbenzene to styrene. It has been shown that CO2 has the potential to offer a promising alternative to oxygen for selective oxidation, whereas the catalyst development is the key to the applications.
1. Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most important greenhouse gases. Mitigation of CO2 emission from various sources has been a worldwide objective. It has been recognized that enhanced capacities in the area of chemical catalysis could have a significant role in addressing the global atmospheric CO2 problem. Con- version and utilization of CO2 (as well as methane, CH4) are important subjects in the field of C1 chemistry.
Several technologies have been proposed for improving the efficiency of energy conversion and utilization of
CO2. Generally, CO2 recovered from flue stacks or
atmosphere can be sequestered in oceans or spent gas and oil wells. Alternatively, recovered CO2 can be used to produce chemicals, fuels, and other useful products.
There are several motivations for producing chemicals from CO2 whenever possible:(1) CO2 is an inexpensive, nontoxic feedstock that can frequently replace toxic chemicals such as phosgene or isocyanates.
(2) CO2 is a renewable feedstock compared to oil or coal.
(3) The production of chemicals from CO2 can lead to new materials such as polymers.
(4) New routes to existing chemical intermediates and products could be more efficient and economical than current methods.
(5) The production of chemicals from CO2 could have a small but significant positive impact on the global carbon balance.1 In the past decades, for catalytic chemistry, most efforts have been concentrated on the utilization of CO2 as a source of carbon. Only recently it has been proposed that CO2 might also be utilized as an oxygen source or oxidant, because it can be considered to be a nontradi- tional (mild) oxidant and oxygen transfer agent. The use of CO2 as an oxidant for the partial oxidation of lower alkanes may become an important route for the utiliza- tion of natural gas. It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels.
The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest. A notable example of the utilization of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocar- bons, because the present-day chemical industry is heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting materials.
In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alterna- tive to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogena- tion processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control.
However, because of the exothermic characteristic of these reactions, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides to * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail address: wangshao@vesta.curtin.edu.au.

2004 American Chemical Society Published on Web 06/24/2004 give high selectivity toward olefins. Therefore, it is expected that the use of the weak oxidant CO2, replacing oxygen in the reactions, will suppress the deep oxida- tion. In this paper, we will review the progress of the conversion of various alkanes to olefins in ODH in the presence of CO2. These reactions include CH4 coupling to ethylene (C2H4), C2-C4 alkanes dehydroge- nation to their corresponding olefins, dehydroaromer- ization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene (C6H6), and dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene. It is shown that the use of CO2 instead of oxygen provides an effective method of CO2 utilization in selective oxidation.
2. Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) with
Carbon Dioxide to Ethane and Ethylene Methane (CH4) is an important natural resource in the world, with an abundance of C2-C4 hydrocarbons.
Basically, there are three routes for the chemical use of CH4: (i) an indirect route, through conversion to syngas; (ii) direct coupling in the presence of O2 or H2;and (iii) direct conversion to oxygenates. In the past two decades, a great number of papers have been published on the direct conversion of CH4, particu- larly on the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons (ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4)) by O2.2-5 The reactions involved are listed as follows: The inevitable formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 from the reactant (CH4) and products (C2H4 and C2H6) (reactions 3-5), however, seems to be one of the most serious problems, from a practical point of view.
CO2, as an oxidant, has several advantages over O2.First, CO will be the only byproduct in this case (see reactions 7 and 8 later in this work). Second, unlike O2, CO2 will not induce gas-phase radical reactions. In other words, the reactions of CH4 and CO2 to produce C2 hydrocarbons will mainly be controlled by heteroge- neous catalysis. It is thus expected that the development of active catalysts achieve high selectivity to C2 hydro- carbons.
2.1. Thermodynamics. The overall reactions for CH4
coupling to C2H6 and C2H4 under CO2 can be expressed as follows: At the same time, the following side reactions that produce CO are possible: Equilibrium conversions of CH4 to C2H6 (reaction 7) and C2H4 (reaction 8) from thermodynamic calculations are shown in Figure 1. Conversion increases as the tem- perature and CO2:CH4 ratio each increase. An enhance- ment in the CO2:CH4 ratio increases the CH4 conver- sions to C2H6 and C2H4 and their yields exceed 15% and 25%, respectively, at 800 C for the reactant with a CO2: CH4 ratio of 2. These values, if achieved, would meet the target C2 yield (ca. 30%) estimated from economic evaluations.6 The key point for the realization is to develop an efficient catalyst that is capable not only of activating both CH4 and CO2 but also of producing C2 hydrocarbons selectively. Some investigations have been conducted in the past few years, and progress is being achieved in catalyst development.
2.2. Catalyst System. Enhancement of C2 formation
by CO2 was first observed in the oxidative coupling of CH4 over a PbO/MgO catalyst,7 but it could not be sustained in the absence of O2.8 Asami et al. systemati- cally investigated the catalytic activities of more than 30 metal oxides for the conversion of CH4 by CO2 in the absence of O2 and found that lanthanide oxides gener- ally showed higher activities (Figure 2). Among them,praseodymium oxide or terbium oxide exhibited rela- tively good catalytic performance; a C2 yield of 1.5% with (2) Lunsford, J. H. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 34, 970-

A binary oxide (La2O3-ZnO) was observed to have high C2 selectivity and good stability, giving a C2 yield of 2.8%.13 Although this yield is better than that of any monoxide system reported previously, it is still quite low. Wang et al. investigated ceria that had been modified with alkali-metal and alkaline-earth-metal oxides for the reaction and reported that CaO-CeO2 systems are effective and that the C2 yield could reach 6.1% at 900
C.14,15 Characterization of the system indicated that the
redox of Ce4+/Ce3+ relates to the activation of CO2, i.e.,the dissociation to CO and oxygen species, which ac- counts for CH4 conversion, and the basic Ca2+ ion in the catalyst greatly enhances the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons.15 In the meantime, they also reported that CaO-Cr2O3 catalysts are effective for this reac- tion.16 A binary catalyst of CaO-ZnO was also tested by the same group for the reaction. A C2 selectivity approaching 80% with a C2 yield of 4.3% was achieved over the catalyst with a Ca:Zn ratio of 0.5 at 875 C.
The lattice oxygen of the CaO-ZnO could convert CH4 mainly to H2 and CO. The presence of CO2 formed a new oxygen species, which was active and selective for the conversion of CH4 to C2 hydrocarbons. The CaO component in the catalyst enhanced the adsorption of CO2 and thus suppressed the reaction involving the lattice oxygen. The reduced Zn site was suggested to activate CO2.17 Recently, Wang et al. further reported their investi- gations of catalytic performance and kinetics over other binary oxides, mainly CaO-MnO2, SrO-MnO2, and BaO-MnO2, for the CO2 coupling of CH4 to C2H6 and
C2H4. At temperatures of g840 C, the CaO-MnO2
catalyst exhibited performance similar to that of other calcium-containing binary oxide catalysts (CaO-CeO2, CaO-Cr2O3, and CaO-ZnO); C2 selectivity and yield at 850 C increased remarkably with increasing partial pressure of CO2, and apparent activation energies observed over these catalysts were approximately the same (190-220 kJ/mol). When the temperature was decreased from 840 C to 825 C, CH4 conversion and C2 selectivity over the CaO-MnO2 catalyst abruptly (9) Asami, K.; Fujita, T.; Kusakabe, K.; Nishiyama, Y.; Ohtsuka, Y.

1128 Energy & Fuels, Vol. 18, No. 4, 2004 Wang and Zhu decreased and a discontinuous change was also observed in the Arrhenius plots. On the other hand, the SrO- MnO2 and BaO-MnO2 catalysts exhibited kinetic fea- tures that were different from the CaO-MnO2 system; C2 selectivity at 850 C changed only slightly with the partial pressure of CO2, and the activation energies were constant over the entire temperature range ex- amined and notably lower. Characterizations revealed that a solid solution of Ca0.48Mn0.52O was the main phase for the CaO-MnO2 catalyst after reaction at 850 C, whereas, at 800 C, some Ca2+ ions were separated from the solid solution to form CaCO3, which covered the catalyst surface. Such a difference accounted for the discontinuous change in the catalytic behavior with temperature. With the SrO-MnO2 and BaO-MnO2 catalysts, SrCO3 and BaCO3 were formed, along with MnO2, after reaction, and the carbonates were suggested to react with MnO2 to form SrMnO2.5 and BaMnO2.5 in the conversion process of CH4 with CO2.18 Cai et al. further investigated the system of Mn/SrCO3 for the selective conversion of CH4 to C2 hydrocarbons, using CO2 as an oxidant and achieved C2 selectivities of 88% and 79.1%, with a C2 yield of 4.3% and 4.5% over catalysts with an Mn:Sr ratio of 0.1 and 0.2, respec- tively.19 Zhou and his colleagues investigated a series of lead/ calcium catalysts, promoted with lithium, potassium,and lanthanum, for OCM and found that CO2 added to the feed resulted in a decreased CH4 conversion and an increased C2 selectivity for the lithium/lead/calcium catalyst.20 Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2, which is a better catalyst for the oxidative coupling of CH4 with O2, was further investigated in the conversion of CH4 with CO2 to C2 hydrocarbons. A CH4 yield of 5% and a selectivity to C2 of 95% were obtained at 820 C. The reaction temperature was observed to favor CH4 conversion but not the selectivity to C2. This is due to surface lattice oxygen, which is responsible for the selective oxidation of CH4 to C2, whereas the bulk lattice oxygen is responsible for deep oxidation.21 Table 1 presents a summary of the catalytic activity of the various catalysts that have been investigated. The MnO2- and ZnO-based catalysts are observed to exhibit higher C2 yield. A strong basic oxide (e.g., BaO) will not favor the activation of CH4. It is also observed that the results reported previously still show a low C2 yield,compared to the thermodynamic calculations. The high- est CH4 conversion is 6%, at 850 C, which suggests that these catalyst systems are not effective in activat- ing CH4. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new catalyst systems or to find a new method for the activation of CH4, thus improving CH4 conversion.
Zhang et al. recently reported using pulse corona plasma as an activation method and applied it for the reaction of CH4 and CO2 over some catalysts. The products were C2 hydrocarbons and the byproducts were CO and molecular hydrogen (H2). CH4 conversion and the yield of C2 hydrocarbons were affected by the CO2 concentra- tion in the feed. The conversion of CH4 increased as the CO2 concentration in the feed increased, while the yield of C2 hydrocarbons decreased. The synergism of La2O3/ γ-Al2O3 and plasma gave a CH4 conversion of 24.9% and C2 hydrocarbons yield of 18.1% were obtained at a plasma power input of 30 W. The distribution of C2 hydrocarbons was changed through the use of a Pd- La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, and the major C2 product was
C2H4.22
2.3. The Role of Carbon Dioxide and the Reac-
tion Mechanism. In the reaction of CH4 coupling, it is generally believed that the activation of CH4 is the most important step. The activation of CH4 involves cleavage of the C-H bond; however, it is not clear whether that cleavage is (i) heterolytic, resulting in the formation of methyl ions (CH3+) or CH3•, or (ii) homolytic, leading to the direct formation of a methyl radical released into the gas phase.3 Currently, it is generally accepted that the active sites for the activation of CH4 can be ascribed to O-(s) or O2-(s) via the reactions In the presence of O2, CH3- can convert to the CH3 radicals required for dimerization to C2H6 via reaction with molecular oxygen (O2).
