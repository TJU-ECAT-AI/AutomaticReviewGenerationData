[1] "Increasing demand for ethene derivatives such as polyethene, ethene oxide, ethylene benzene and many more has made ethene one of the main chemical feedstocks in the chemical industry."
[2] "Conventionally, ethene is made by naphtha and ethane cracking, both energy-intensive processes that promote high rate of coke deposition, a continuous operation hurdle, apart from high CO2 emission."
[3] "Recently, ethane cracking has significantly picked up the pace, due to current growth in discoveries of natural gas, especially shale gas in the US, making it a cheap feed for ethene production."
[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) takes place at lower temperatures where oxidants such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide are utilized."
[5] "Studies on ODHE employing CO2 have been reported over Cr2O3- and Ga2O3-based catalysts, where the former showed superior activity."
[6] "However, the use of Cr2O3 is problematic due to toxicity issues while Ga2O3 is relatively expensive and shows severe sintering and coking."
[7] "One of the issues that crippled the performance of Ga3O3-based catalyst is high rate of coke deposition resulting in gradual and early deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration."
[8] "By tuning the acidity and basicity of the catalyst, to some extent, the coke deposition has been minimized, however, the necessity of catalyst regeneration seemed to be inevitable."
[9] "The reported initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over Ga2O3-based catalysts are in the range of 20-30% and 80-90%, respectively, which gradually decrease, primarily ethane conversion, with time."
[10] "In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g., Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2)."
[11] "The observed high activity was attributed to the redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2."
[12] "Some improvement on the Cr2O3/SiO2 activity has been achieved by addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters."
[13] "Cobalt oxide-based catalysts are attractive for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutene using O2 and also for dry reforming of methane."
[14] "Li et al. used 3%Co-MCM-41 with CO2 as oxidant and reported ethane conversion of about 40% with a selectivity of 99%."
[15] "Zhang et al. found 7% Co loading on BaCO3 to be optimal with a very stable (>5 h) ethane conversion of 48% at a C2H4 selectivity of 92%."
[16] "The high activity and stable performance was attributed to the redox property of CoOx as well as synergism between BaCO3 and BaCoO3."
[17] "The support characteristics have major influence on the performance in ODHE, as has been shown for Cr2O3- and Ga2O3-based catalysts."
[18] "To our knowledge, there exists no systematic study of the catalytic performance of single and mixed oxide supported cobalt catalysts on CO2-assisted ODHE."
[19] "With this in mind, we investigated the influence of single and mixed-oxide supports on the performance of Co-based ODHE catalysts."
[20] "A scalable single-step flame spray pyrolysis method was used for their preparation."
[21] "In this comparative study, we report the physicochemical properties of flame-made single and mixed-oxide supported Co catalysts and their performance in ODHE using CO2 as a mild oxidant."

The various support materials, including silica (SiO2), molecular sieves (MCM-41, H-ZSM-5), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), zirconium oxide (ZrO2), and cerium oxide (CeO2), play a significant role in influencing the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Chromium oxide catalysts typically show superior activity when supported on silica (SiO2) or mixed oxide supports like SiO2-Al2O3, SiO2-TiO2, SiO2-ZrO2, and TiO2-ZrO2. The choice of support affects the reducibility of the chromium species, with chromium supported on alumina (Al2O3) and SiO2-Al2O3 showing minimal hydrogen consumption up to 840°C, while ZrO2-supported chromium was already reduced at temperatures below 500°C. Silica-supported catalysts display a broad reduction peak at 780°C, indicative of well-dispersed chromium oxide embedded in the silica matrix, forming chromium silicate, as confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), UV-visible spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy analyses. Among all catalysts, silica-supported chromium demonstrated the best catalytic performance under the tested conditions (700°C with CO2/C2H6 ratio = 2.5). The addition of aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, and zirconium oxide to silica did not lead to improved catalytic performance, possibly due to differences in the reducibility of the chromium species and the strength and surface density of acidic sites, which are critical for optimal ethene yield. Controlling the surface acidity appears crucial to avoid unwanted side reactions like cracking and coking, which can impair activity and selectivity. Parametric sensitivity studies of the silica-supported chromium catalyst, including reaction temperature, CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, and space velocity, revealed the importance of CO2. Without CO2, only low ethane conversion was observed, and changing the oxidant to oxygen resulted in poorer catalytic performance. This highlights the importance of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.

各种支持材料，如二氧化硅（SiO2）、分子筛（MCM-41、H-ZSM-5）、氧化铝（Al2O3）、氧化锆（ZrO2）和氧化铈（CeO2），在影响铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理方面起着重要作用。当以二氧化硅或混合氧化物支持（如SiO2-Al2O3、SiO2-TiO2、SiO2-ZrO2、TiO2-ZrO2）支持时，铬氧化物催化剂通常显示出更高的活性。不同支持材料对铬物种的可还原性有显著影响：以氧化铝（Al2O3）和SiO2-Al2O3支持的铬，在840°C以下几乎没有氢消耗；而ZrO2支持的铬在温度低于500°C时就开始被还原。以二氧化硅为支持的催化剂在780°C显示一个广泛的还原峰，这表明在二氧化硅矩阵中嵌入了分散良好的铬氧化物，形成了铬硅酸盐，这一结果通过高分辨率透射电子显微镜（HR-TEM）、能量色散X射线光谱（EDXS）、紫外可见光谱和拉曼光谱分析得到了证实。所有催化剂中，以二氧化硅为支持的铬表现出最佳的催化性能，在测试条件下（700°C，CO2/C2H6比例=2.5）。将铝氧化物、钛氧化物和氧化锆添加到二氧化硅中并未导致催化性能的改善，这可能是因为铬物种的可还原性以及酸性和碱性表面密度的不同，这些是实现最佳乙烷选择性的关键因素。控制表面酸度似乎对于避免裂解和结焦等副作用至关重要，这些副作用会损害活性和选择性。参数敏感性研究显示，以二氧化硅为支持的铬催化剂的性能，包括反应温度、CO2/C2H6进料比和空间速度，表明CO2的重要性。没有CO2时，仅观察到较低的乙烷转化率，而将氧化剂改为氧气则导致催化性能下降。这突出了二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的重要性。
