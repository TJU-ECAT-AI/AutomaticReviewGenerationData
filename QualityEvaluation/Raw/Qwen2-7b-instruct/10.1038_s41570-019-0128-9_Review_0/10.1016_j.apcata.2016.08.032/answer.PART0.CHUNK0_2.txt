The various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) can significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts show superior activity in comparison to gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts, although Ga2O3 is more expensive and prone to sintering and coking. When supported on generic supports like Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, the observed activity shifts, often favoring Cr-based catalysts. Ga2O3 catalysts typically exhibit an ethane conversion range of 20-30% and ethene selectivity of 80-90%, which decreases over time, primarily affecting ethane conversion. In contrast, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts achieve high and stable ethane conversion rates around 50% and ethene selectivity exceeding 90%. These improvements in activity can be attributed to the redox properties and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. Adding acidic and basic oxide promoters further enhances the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst activity. Cobalt oxide-based catalysts demonstrate attractiveness for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutene, as well as for dry reforming of methane. Using 3%Co-MCM-41 with CO2 as an oxidant, Li et al. reported an ethane conversion of approximately 40% with a high selectivity of 99%. Zhang et al. found that a 7% Co loading on BaCO3 resulted in a stable ethane conversion of 48% over 5 hours, with a C2H4 selectivity of 92%. The high activity and stable performance of these catalysts can be attributed to the redox property of CoOx and the synergistic effect between BaCO3 and BaCoO3. The support characteristics play a significant role in ODHE performance, as demonstrated for Cr2O3- and Ga2O3-based catalysts. The study focused on investigating the influence of single and mixed-oxide supports on the performance of cobalt-based ODHE catalysts.

各种支持材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）以及反应条件（包括CO2分压）对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径有显著影响。例如，铬氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂的活性通常优于镓氧化物（Ga2O3）催化剂，尽管Ga2O3较为昂贵且易发生结焦。当支持在通用支撑体如Al2O3、SiO2、TiO2和ZrO2上时，观察到的活性会发生变化，通常Cr基催化剂表现更优。Ga2O3催化剂的乙烷转化率通常在20-30%之间，乙烯选择性为80-90%，随着时间推移，主要影响乙烷转化率逐渐降低。相比之下，以SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂可以实现约50%的高乙烷转化率和超过90%的乙烯选择性。通过添加酸性和碱性氧化物促进剂，进一步提高了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的活性。钴氧化物基催化剂对于使用O2进行乙烷、丙烷和异丁烯的氧化脱氢，以及甲烷重整显示出吸引力。利用3%Co-MCM-41作为氧化剂，Li等人报告了约40%的乙烷转化率和99%的选择性。Zhang等人发现，在BaCO3上负载7%的Co，可以获得稳定的乙烷转化率高达48%，持续时间超过5小时，C2H4选择性为92%。这些催化剂的高活性和稳定性能可归因于CoOx的还原性质和BaCO3与BaCoO3之间的协同作用。支撑特性在ODHE性能中扮演重要角色，这是基于Cr2O3-和Ga2O3基催化剂的观察结果。研究重点在于探索单氧化物和混合氧化物支持对钴基ODHE催化剂性能的影响。
