[1] "Increasing demand for ethene derivatives such as polyethene, ethene oxide, ethylbenzene and many more has made ethene one of the main chemical feedstocks in the chemical industry [1,2]."

1. The demand for ethene derivatives such as polyethene, ethene oxide, ethylbenzene, and others has made ethene a primary chemical feedstock in the chemical industry. Conventional methods of producing ethene involve cracking naphtha and ethane, which are energy-intensive processes that lead to coke deposition, a challenge in continuous operations, and high CO2 emissions.

2. Recently, the pace of ethane cracking has accelerated due to the growth in natural gas discoveries, particularly in the US, making ethane a cost-effective feedstock for ethene production.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) occurs at lower temperatures, utilizing oxidants like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide. Studies have shown that chromium (Cr2O3) and gallium (Ga2O3) based catalysts are effective in this process.

4. Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) is problematic due to its toxicity, while gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is relatively expensive and prone to sintering and coking. However, the former often exhibits superior activity compared to the latter when used alone.

5. When gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is supported on generic supports like alumina (Al2O3) or silica (SiO2), the observed activity reverses, with the chromium-based catalyst being superior.

6. Controlling the surface acidity of the catalyst is crucial to prevent undesirable side reactions such as cracking and coking, which can reduce activity and selectivity.

7. Without carbon dioxide (CO2), only low conversion of ethane (C2H6) is observed, and changing the oxidant from CO2 to oxygen (O2) results in poorer catalytic performance.

1. 对于乙烯衍生物如聚乙烯、乙烯氧化物、乙苯等的需求，使得乙烯成为了化学工业的主要化工原料。传统的乙烯生产方法包括裂解石脑油和乙烷，这些过程能耗高，易于形成焦炭沉积，构成连续操作的障碍，并产生大量的二氧化碳排放。

2. 近年来，由于北美天然气发现的增长，特别是页岩气的开采，使得乙烷作为乙烯生产的廉价原料得到了快速发展。

3. 乙烯氧化脱氢（ODHE）在较低温度下进行，利用氧、二氧化碳和一氧化二氮等氧化剂。研究表明，铬（Cr2O3）和镓（Ga2O3）基催化剂在这类反应中表现出良好的活性。

4. 铬氧化物（Cr2O3）的问题在于其毒性，而镓氧化物（Ga2O3）相对昂贵且易发生聚集和结焦现象。然而，前者往往比后者在单独使用时具有更高的活性。

5. 当镓氧化物（Ga2O3）被支持在通用载体如氧化铝（Al2O3）或二氧化硅（SiO2）上时，观察到的活性逆转，铬基催化剂表现得更为优越。

6. 控制催化剂表面的酸度对于避免影响活性和选择性的不利副反应（如裂解和结焦）至关重要。

7. 在没有二氧化碳（CO2）的情况下，只有低的乙烯（C2H6）转化率被观察到，将氧化剂从CO2更改为氧气（O2）会导致催化性能下降。
