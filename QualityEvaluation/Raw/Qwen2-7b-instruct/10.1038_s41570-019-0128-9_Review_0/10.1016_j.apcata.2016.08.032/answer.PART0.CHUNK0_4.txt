The use of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions shows varying activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways depending on the support materials and reaction conditions. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on SiO2 show superior activity, stability, and selectivity for ethane conversion and ethene production compared to catalysts supported on Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2. The redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 system contribute to this enhanced performance. However, the use of chromium oxide catalysts is problematic due to toxicity issues. Adding acidic and basic oxide promoters can improve the activity of chromium oxide catalysts. Cobalt oxide catalysts demonstrate potential for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutene, as well as for dry reforming of methane. The high activity and stable performance of cobalt oxide catalysts is attributed to the redox property of CoOx and the synergism between BaCO3 and BaCoO3. The support characteristics play a critical role in the performance of these catalysts, as evidenced by studies on chromium oxide and gallium oxide-based catalysts. Minimizing coke deposition by tuning the acidity and basicity of the catalyst reduces the necessity for frequent regeneration. However, catalyst regeneration remains inevitable. The ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over gallium oxide-based catalysts typically range from 20-30% and 80-90%, respectively, and degrade over time. Without CO2, low ethane conversion is observed, and changing the oxidant to O2 results in poorer catalytic performance.

在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，使用铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径依赖于支持材料和反应条件。与铝氧化物、钛氧化物和锆氧化物支持的催化剂相比，铬氧化物在硅氧烷上支持的催化剂显示出更优的活性、稳定性和乙烷转化率及乙烯产率。铬氧化物/硅氧烷系统的还原性质和酸碱性是这种增强性能的关键因素。然而，使用铬氧化物催化剂的问题在于其毒性问题。通过添加酸性和碱性氧化物促进剂可以改善铬氧化物催化剂的活性。钴氧化物催化剂在使用氧气进行乙烷、丙烷和异丁烯的氧化脱氢以及甲烷干重整中显示出吸引力。高活性和稳定的性能归因于CoOx的还原性质和BaCO3与BaCoO3之间的协同作用。支持特性对这些催化剂的性能至关重要，这在铬氧化物和镓氧化物基催化剂的研究中得到了证明。通过调整催化剂的酸碱性来减少焦炭沉积可以降低催化剂再生的必要性，但催化剂再生仍然是不可避免的。乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性在镓氧化物基催化剂上通常在20-30%和80-90%之间，并随时间逐渐下降，主要是乙烷转化率的下降。没有二氧化碳，低的乙烷转化率被观察到，将氧化剂改变为氧气导致催化性能变差。
