[1] "Studies on ODHE employing CO2 have been reported over Cr2O3- [11,12] and Ga2O3-based [1315] catalysts,where the former showed superior activity."
[2] "However, the use of Cr2O3 is problematic due to toxicity issues while Ga2O3 is relatively expensive and shows severe sintering and coking."
[3] "The latter metal oxide has been reported to exhibit higher activity compared to that of the former [16]."
[4] "In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) [8]."
[5] "The observed high activity was attributed to the redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2."
[6] "Some improvement on the Cr2O3/SiO2 activity has been achieved by addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters [19]."
[7] "Cobalt oxide based catalysts are attractive for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [2022], propane [23,24] and isobutene [25] using O2 and also for dry reforming of methane [26,27]."
[8] "By tuning the acidity and basicity of the catalyst, to some extent, the coke deposition has been minimized [15], however, the necessity of catalyst regeneration seemed to be inevitable."
[9] "The support characteristics have major influence on the performance in ODHE, as has been shown for Cr2O3- [8] and Ga2O3-based [17] catalysts."

The various support materials, including SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance involve balancing the redox properties, acidity, and basicity of the catalyst. For instance, chromium oxide supported on SiO2 shows high activity, stability, and selectivity, making it preferable compared to other supports. However, the toxicity of chromium poses a significant challenge, necessitating the use of promoters to enhance the catalyst's performance without compromising safety. Cobalt oxide-based catalysts are also attractive alternatives for oxidative dehydrogenation, offering competitive activity and selectivity. The support's ability to tune the acidity and basicity of the catalyst helps minimize coke deposition, although catalyst regeneration may still be required over time. The choice of support material plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
