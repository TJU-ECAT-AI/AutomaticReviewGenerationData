[1] "Increasing demand for ethene derivatives such as polyethene, ethene oxide, ethylene benzene and many more has made ethene one of the main chemical feedstocks in the chemical industry."
[2] "Conventionally, ethene is made by naphtha and ethane cracking, both energy-intensive processes that promote high rate of coke deposition, a continuous operation hurdle, apart from high CO2 emission."
[3] "Recently, ethane cracking has significantly picked up the pace, due to current growth in discoveries of natural gas, especially shale gas in the US, making it a cheap feed for ethene production."
[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) takes place at lower temperatures where oxidants such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide are utilized."

[6] "However, the use of Cr2O3 is problematic due to toxicity issues while Ga2O3 is relatively expensive and shows severe sintering and coking."
[7] "One of the issues that crippled the performance of Ga3O3-based catalyst is high rate of coke deposition resulting in gradual and early deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration."
[8] "By tuning the acidity and basicity of the catalyst, to some extent, the coke deposition has been minimized, however, the necessity of catalyst regeneration seemed to be inevitable."
[9] "The reported initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over Ga2O3-based catalysts are in the range of 20-30% and 80-90%, respectively, which gradually decrease, primarily ethane conversion, with time."
[10] "In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g., Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2)."

The various support materials, including silica (SiO2), molecular sieves (MCM-41, H-ZSM-5), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), zirconium oxide (ZrO2), and cerium oxide (CeO2), play a significant role in influencing the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Chromium oxide catalysts typically show superior activity when supported on silica (SiO2) or mixed oxide supports like SiO2-Al2O3, SiO2-TiO2, SiO2-ZrO2, and TiO2-ZrO2. The choice of support affects the reducibility of the chromium species, with chromium supported on alumina (Al2O3) and SiO2-Al2O3 showing minimal hydrogen consumption up to 840°C, while ZrO2-supported chromium was already reduced at temperatures below 500°C. Silica-supported catalysts display a broad reduction peak at 780°C, indicative of well-dispersed chromium oxide embedded in the silica matrix, forming chromium silicate, as confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), UV-visible spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy analyses. Among all catalysts, silica-supported chromium demonstrated the best catalytic performance under the tested conditions (700°C with CO2/C2H6 ratio = 2.5). The addition of aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, and zirconium oxide to silica did not lead to improved catalytic performance, possibly due to differences in the reducibility of the chromium species and the strength and surface density of acidic sites, which are critical for optimal ethene yield. Controlling the surface acidity appears crucial to avoid unwanted side reactions like cracking and coking, which can impair activity and selectivity. Parametric sensitivity studies of the silica-supported chromium catalyst, including reaction temperature, CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, and space velocity, revealed the importance of CO2. Without CO2, only low ethane conversion was observed, and changing the oxidant to oxygen resulted in poorer catalytic performance. This highlights the importance of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.

各种支持材料，如二氧化硅（SiO2）、分子筛（MCM-41、H-ZSM-5）、氧化铝（Al2O3）、氧化锆（ZrO2）和氧化铈（CeO2），在影响铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理方面起着重要作用。当以二氧化硅或混合氧化物支持（如SiO2-Al2O3、SiO2-TiO2、SiO2-ZrO2、TiO2-ZrO2）支持时，铬氧化物催化剂通常显示出更高的活性。不同支持材料对铬物种的可还原性有显著影响：以氧化铝（Al2O3）和SiO2-Al2O3支持的铬，在840°C以下几乎没有氢消耗；而ZrO2支持的铬在温度低于500°C时就开始被还原。以二氧化硅为支持的催化剂在780°C显示一个广泛的还原峰，这表明在二氧化硅矩阵中嵌入了分散良好的铬氧化物，形成了铬硅酸盐，这一结果通过高分辨率透射电子显微镜（HR-TEM）、能量色散X射线光谱（EDXS）、紫外可见光谱和拉曼光谱分析得到了证实。所有催化剂中，以二氧化硅为支持的铬表现出最佳的催化性能，在测试条件下（700°C，CO2/C2H6比例=2.5）。将铝氧化物、钛氧化物和氧化锆添加到二氧化硅中并未导致催化性能的改善，这可能是因为铬物种的可还原性以及酸性和碱性表面密度的不同，这些是实现最佳乙烷选择性的关键因素。控制表面酸度似乎对于避免裂解和结焦等副作用至关重要，这些副作用会损害活性和选择性。参数敏感性研究显示，以二氧化硅为支持的铬催化剂的性能，包括反应温度、CO2/C2H6进料比和空间速度，表明CO2的重要性。没有CO2时，仅观察到较低的乙烷转化率，而将氧化剂改为氧气则导致催化性能下降。这突出了二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的重要性。

1. The demand for ethene derivatives such as polyethene, ethene oxide, ethylbenzene, and others has made ethene a primary chemical feedstock in the chemical industry. Conventional methods of producing ethene involve cracking naphtha and ethane, which are energy-intensive processes that lead to coke deposition, a challenge in continuous operations, and high CO2 emissions.

2. Recently, the pace of ethane cracking has accelerated due to the growth in natural gas discoveries, particularly in the US, making ethane a cost-effective feedstock for ethene production.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) occurs at lower temperatures, utilizing oxidants like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide. Studies have shown that chromium (Cr2O3) and gallium (Ga2O3) based catalysts are effective in this process.

4. Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) is problematic due to its toxicity, while gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is relatively expensive and prone to sintering and coking. However, the former often exhibits superior activity compared to the latter when used alone.

5. When gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is supported on generic supports like alumina (Al2O3) or silica (SiO2), the observed activity reverses, with the chromium-based catalyst being superior.

6. Controlling the surface acidity of the catalyst is crucial to prevent undesirable side reactions such as cracking and coking, which can reduce activity and selectivity.

7. Without carbon dioxide (CO2), only low conversion of ethane (C2H6) is observed, and changing the oxidant from CO2 to oxygen (O2) results in poorer catalytic performance.

1. 对于乙烯衍生物如聚乙烯、乙烯氧化物、乙苯等的需求，使得乙烯成为了化学工业的主要化工原料。传统的乙烯生产方法包括裂解石脑油和乙烷，这些过程能耗高，易于形成焦炭沉积，构成连续操作的障碍，并产生大量的二氧化碳排放。

2. 近年来，由于北美天然气发现的增长，特别是页岩气的开采，使得乙烷作为乙烯生产的廉价原料得到了快速发展。

3. 乙烯氧化脱氢（ODHE）在较低温度下进行，利用氧、二氧化碳和一氧化二氮等氧化剂。研究表明，铬（Cr2O3）和镓（Ga2O3）基催化剂在这类反应中表现出良好的活性。

4. 铬氧化物（Cr2O3）的问题在于其毒性，而镓氧化物（Ga2O3）相对昂贵且易发生聚集和结焦现象。然而，前者往往比后者在单独使用时具有更高的活性。

5. 当镓氧化物（Ga2O3）被支持在通用载体如氧化铝（Al2O3）或二氧化硅（SiO2）上时，观察到的活性逆转，铬基催化剂表现得更为优越。

6. 控制催化剂表面的酸度对于避免影响活性和选择性的不利副反应（如裂解和结焦）至关重要。

7. 在没有二氧化碳（CO2）的情况下，只有低的乙烯（C2H6）转化率被观察到，将氧化剂从CO2更改为氧气（O2）会导致催化性能下降。

The various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) can significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts show superior activity in comparison to gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts, although Ga2O3 is more expensive and prone to sintering and coking. When supported on generic supports like Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, the observed activity shifts, often favoring Cr-based catalysts. Ga2O3 catalysts typically exhibit an ethane conversion range of 20-30% and ethene selectivity of 80-90%, which decreases over time, primarily affecting ethane conversion. In contrast, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts achieve high and stable ethane conversion rates around 50% and ethene selectivity exceeding 90%. These improvements in activity can be attributed to the redox properties and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. Adding acidic and basic oxide promoters further enhances the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst activity. Cobalt oxide-based catalysts demonstrate attractiveness for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutene, as well as for dry reforming of methane. Using 3%Co-MCM-41 with CO2 as an oxidant, Li et al. reported an ethane conversion of approximately 40% with a high selectivity of 99%. Zhang et al. found that a 7% Co loading on BaCO3 resulted in a stable ethane conversion of 48% over 5 hours, with a C2H4 selectivity of 92%. The high activity and stable performance of these catalysts can be attributed to the redox property of CoOx and the synergistic effect between BaCO3 and BaCoO3. The support characteristics play a significant role in ODHE performance, as demonstrated for Cr2O3- and Ga2O3-based catalysts. The study focused on investigating the influence of single and mixed-oxide supports on the performance of cobalt-based ODHE catalysts.

各种支持材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）以及反应条件（包括CO2分压）对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径有显著影响。例如，铬氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂的活性通常优于镓氧化物（Ga2O3）催化剂，尽管Ga2O3较为昂贵且易发生结焦。当支持在通用支撑体如Al2O3、SiO2、TiO2和ZrO2上时，观察到的活性会发生变化，通常Cr基催化剂表现更优。Ga2O3催化剂的乙烷转化率通常在20-30%之间，乙烯选择性为80-90%，随着时间推移，主要影响乙烷转化率逐渐降低。相比之下，以SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂可以实现约50%的高乙烷转化率和超过90%的乙烯选择性。通过添加酸性和碱性氧化物促进剂，进一步提高了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的活性。钴氧化物基催化剂对于使用O2进行乙烷、丙烷和异丁烯的氧化脱氢，以及甲烷重整显示出吸引力。利用3%Co-MCM-41作为氧化剂，Li等人报告了约40%的乙烷转化率和99%的选择性。Zhang等人发现，在BaCO3上负载7%的Co，可以获得稳定的乙烷转化率高达48%，持续时间超过5小时，C2H4选择性为92%。这些催化剂的高活性和稳定性能可归因于CoOx的还原性质和BaCO3与BaCoO3之间的协同作用。支撑特性在ODHE性能中扮演重要角色，这是基于Cr2O3-和Ga2O3基催化剂的观察结果。研究重点在于探索单氧化物和混合氧化物支持对钴基ODHE催化剂性能的影响。

The various support materials, including SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance involve balancing the redox properties, acidity, and basicity of the catalyst. For instance, chromium oxide supported on SiO2 shows high activity, stability, and selectivity, making it preferable compared to other supports. However, the toxicity of chromium poses a significant challenge, necessitating the use of promoters to enhance the catalyst's performance without compromising safety. Cobalt oxide-based catalysts are also attractive alternatives for oxidative dehydrogenation, offering competitive activity and selectivity. The support's ability to tune the acidity and basicity of the catalyst helps minimize coke deposition, although catalyst regeneration may still be required over time. The choice of support material plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The use of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions shows varying activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways depending on the support materials and reaction conditions. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on SiO2 show superior activity, stability, and selectivity for ethane conversion and ethene production compared to catalysts supported on Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2. The redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 system contribute to this enhanced performance. However, the use of chromium oxide catalysts is problematic due to toxicity issues. Adding acidic and basic oxide promoters can improve the activity of chromium oxide catalysts. Cobalt oxide catalysts demonstrate potential for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutene, as well as for dry reforming of methane. The high activity and stable performance of cobalt oxide catalysts is attributed to the redox property of CoOx and the synergism between BaCO3 and BaCoO3. The support characteristics play a critical role in the performance of these catalysts, as evidenced by studies on chromium oxide and gallium oxide-based catalysts. Minimizing coke deposition by tuning the acidity and basicity of the catalyst reduces the necessity for frequent regeneration. However, catalyst regeneration remains inevitable. The ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over gallium oxide-based catalysts typically range from 20-30% and 80-90%, respectively, and degrade over time. Without CO2, low ethane conversion is observed, and changing the oxidant to O2 results in poorer catalytic performance.

在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，使用铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径依赖于支持材料和反应条件。与铝氧化物、钛氧化物和锆氧化物支持的催化剂相比，铬氧化物在硅氧烷上支持的催化剂显示出更优的活性、稳定性和乙烷转化率及乙烯产率。铬氧化物/硅氧烷系统的还原性质和酸碱性是这种增强性能的关键因素。然而，使用铬氧化物催化剂的问题在于其毒性问题。通过添加酸性和碱性氧化物促进剂可以改善铬氧化物催化剂的活性。钴氧化物催化剂在使用氧气进行乙烷、丙烷和异丁烯的氧化脱氢以及甲烷干重整中显示出吸引力。高活性和稳定的性能归因于CoOx的还原性质和BaCO3与BaCoO3之间的协同作用。支持特性对这些催化剂的性能至关重要，这在铬氧化物和镓氧化物基催化剂的研究中得到了证明。通过调整催化剂的酸碱性来减少焦炭沉积可以降低催化剂再生的必要性，但催化剂再生仍然是不可避免的。乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性在镓氧化物基催化剂上通常在20-30%和80-90%之间，并随时间逐渐下降，主要是乙烷转化率的下降。没有二氧化碳，低的乙烷转化率被观察到，将氧化剂改变为氧气导致催化性能变差。
