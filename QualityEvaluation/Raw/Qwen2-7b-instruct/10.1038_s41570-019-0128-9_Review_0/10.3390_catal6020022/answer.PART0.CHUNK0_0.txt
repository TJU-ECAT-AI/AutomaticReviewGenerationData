1. Carbon dioxide can serve as an alternative oxidant to molecular oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

2. Metal oxides with chromium or cerium elements showed high ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity, reaching over 60% and 90%, respectively.

3. Various oxidants other than molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide have been explored, such as sulfur oxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, hypochlorite, bromine, and iodine compounds.

4. In 1993, lithium/magnesium oxide catalysts were reported to improve catalytic conversion and selectivity in methane oxidative coupling and ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

5. CO2 is suitable as a selective oxidant for ethane activation, requiring high temperatures for the reaction.
