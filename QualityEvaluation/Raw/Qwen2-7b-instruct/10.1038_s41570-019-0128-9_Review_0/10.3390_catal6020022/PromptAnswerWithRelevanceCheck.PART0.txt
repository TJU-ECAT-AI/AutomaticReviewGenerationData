In the case of propane dehydrogenation, propene is formed as the main product. The drawback is that the dehydrogenation equilibrium favours propene only at high temperatures or low pressure, increasing the overall cost of the process. The need for cryogenic separation of the unconverted propane and produced propene also increases the process costs.
</citation>
<citation>
Improvements of the dehydrogenation process to make it commercially more attractive can be done by shifting the equilibrium by removal of one of the reaction products. This can be done either physically by means of a membrane, or chemically by in-situ catalytic oxidation using for instance a transition metal oxide.
</citation>
<citation>
This approach has the advantage of an exothermic oxidation which facilitates the dehydrogenation.
</citation>
<citation>
However, mixing H2, O2 and hydrocarbons at high temperatures creates a highly dangerous mixture and a high level of risk of explosion, which can be reduced by using oxygen-selective membranes.
</citation>

To improve the commercial viability of propane dehydrogenation processes, several strategies can be employed. One approach involves shifting the equilibrium of the reaction to favor the formation of propene. This can be achieved through physical means, such as utilizing a membrane to remove one of the reaction products, or through in-situ catalytic oxidation using a transition metal oxide. The latter method benefits from an exothermic oxidation that aids in facilitating the dehydrogenation process. However, handling hydrogen, oxygen, and hydrocarbons at high temperatures poses significant safety risks due to the potential for explosive mixtures. To mitigate these risks, the use of oxygen-selective membranes can be implemented to control the feed rates of oxygen and organic compounds, thereby increasing the organic compound concentration and enhancing production rates without compromising safety.

为了使丙烷脱氢过程更具商业吸引力，可以采取几种策略。一种方法是通过调整反应平衡，使丙烯的形成成为主要产物。这可以通过物理方法实现，例如使用膜来去除一个反应产物，或者通过原位催化氧化使用过渡金属氧化物。后一种方法得益于一个放热氧化作用，有助于促进脱氢过程。然而，在高温下混合氢气、氧气和碳氢化合物会引发高度危险的混合物和爆炸风险。为降低这些风险，可以采用氧选择性膜来控制氧气和有机化合物的进料速率，从而增加有机化合物的浓度，提高生产率而不影响安全性。

1. Carbon dioxide can be used as an alternative oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, offering benefits such as recovering hydrogen fuel capacity and reducing the likelihood of secondary reactions. However, it poses challenges due to its low chemical reactivity, requiring higher reaction temperatures for activation.

2. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation can recover some of the fuel capacity lost during the process, making it a viable alternative to traditional oxygen sources. It also reduces the risk of secondary reactions, which might occur when oxygen is used. Yet, the low reactivity of carbon dioxide necessitates higher temperatures for effective activation, which aligns well with the high temperatures needed for ethane activation in oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. The low chemical reactivity of carbon dioxide leads to difficulties in its activation, resulting in higher reaction temperatures. This characteristic makes it suitable for the activation of ethane, which also requires high temperatures for oxidative dehydrogenation. Utilizing carbon dioxide as an oxidant can serve as an alternative to traditional oxygen sources and valorize it by transforming it into useful products such as CO and water.

2. 使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂在氧化脱氢化过程中可以回收部分在过程中丢失的燃料容量，并且减少了当使用氧气时可能发生的二次反应的风险。然而，二氧化碳的低活性特性导致其激活困难，通常需要更高的反应温度。这与乙烷激活所需的高温度相匹配，使其适合用于乙烷的氧化脱氢化过程。

3. 二氧化碳的低化学活性导致其激活困难，需要更高的反应温度。这种特性使其适用于乙烷的激活，因为氧化脱氢化也需要高温。将二氧化碳用作氧化剂可以作为一种传统氧源的替代品，并通过将其转化为有用的产物（如CO和水）来实现其增值。

<p>For the case of ethane oxidation, it was surprisingly shown that NiO presents high catalytic activity for ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity [93] and that the method of preparation of the catalysts governs its catalytic activity [94,95].</p>
</citation>
<citation>
<p>NiO prepared by the sol-gel method [67] starts converting ethane at 275 C, and the conversion increases up to 350 C (23% conversion and 47% selectivity in ethylene), while with NiO prepared by the precipitation method [67], the yield decreases to 8% and to 3% with the NiO prepared by a microemulsion method.</p>
</citation>
<citation>
<p>When Nb was deposited on NiO, the catalytic activity for ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity were improved. This phenomenon was assigned to electron transfer enhancement played by Nb, leading to easier activation of the C-H bond of ethane (see above Section 4.2 & Figure 11 from [67]).</p>
</citation>
<citation>
<p>Other promoters such as Zr, which acts as a Lewis acid, but also Mg, Li, Ga, Ti, Ta, or alumina have also been proposed for NiO catalyst to increase ethylene yield.</p>
</citation>
<citation>
<p>However, ethane oxidation was also found to give acetic acid in addition to ethylene. The main processes for synthesis of acetic acid include methanol carbonylation on Rh or Ir-based catalysts (originally by Monsanto, now also by Celanes, BP-Cativa, etc.), liquid phase oxidation of acetaldehyde, n-butane, and naphta, and, more recently, ethylene oxidation in gas phase (Showa Denko), butene liquid phase oxidation (Wacker), and gas phase ethane oxidation.</p>
</citation>
<citation>
<p>The later reaction C2H6 + (3/2) O2 → CH3COOH + H2O is only viable if ethane is easily available on the industrial platform and cheap. Different classes of catalysts have been proposed but the highest performing one is a mixed (VNbMo)5O14 based oxide described by Thorsteinson et al. [50] with a d-spacing close to 0.40 nm The best composition was claimed to be Mo0.73V0.18Nb0.09Ox with 10% ethane conversion at 286 C and almost total selectivity to ethylene.</p>

1. NiO exhibits high catalytic activity for ethane conversion and high ethylene selectivity. The method of preparation significantly affects its activity, with sol-gel method yielding better results compared to precipitation and microemulsion methods.

2. Depositing Nb on NiO enhances its catalytic activity for ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity through electron transfer, facilitating easier activation of the C-H bond of ethane.

3. Promoters like Zr, Mg, Li, Ga, Ti, Ta, and alumina have been used to increase ethylene yield in NiO catalysts.

4. Ethane oxidation also results in acetic acid production, alongside ethylene. Acetic acid synthesis can be achieved through various methods such as methanol carbonylation, liquid phase oxidation of acetaldehyde, n-butane, and naphtha, as well as ethylene and butene oxidation.

5. A mixed (VNbMo)5O14 oxide is the most effective catalyst for ethane oxidation, achieving 10% conversion at 286 C with near-total selectivity for ethylene.
