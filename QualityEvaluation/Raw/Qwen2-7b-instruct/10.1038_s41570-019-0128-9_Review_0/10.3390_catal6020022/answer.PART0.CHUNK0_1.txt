In the case of propane dehydrogenation, propene is formed as the main product. The drawback is that the dehydrogenation equilibrium favours propene only at high temperatures or low pressure, increasing the overall cost of the process. The need for cryogenic separation of the unconverted propane and produced propene also increases the process costs.

Improvements of the dehydrogenation process to make it commercially more attractive can be done by shifting the equilibrium by removal of one of the reaction products. This can be done either physically by means of a membrane, or chemically by in-situ catalytic oxidation using for instance a transition metal oxide.

This approach has the advantage of an exothermic oxidation which facilitates the dehydrogenation.

However, mixing H2, O2 and hydrocarbons at high temperatures creates a highly dangerous mixture and a high level of risk of explosion, which can be reduced by using oxygen-selective membranes.

To improve the commercial viability of propane dehydrogenation processes, several strategies can be employed. One approach involves shifting the equilibrium of the reaction to favor the formation of propene. This can be achieved through physical means, such as utilizing a membrane to remove one of the reaction products, or through in-situ catalytic oxidation using a transition metal oxide. The latter method benefits from an exothermic oxidation that aids in facilitating the dehydrogenation process. However, handling hydrogen, oxygen, and hydrocarbons at high temperatures poses significant safety risks due to the potential for explosive mixtures. To mitigate these risks, the use of oxygen-selective membranes can be implemented to control the feed rates of oxygen and organic compounds, thereby increasing the organic compound concentration and enhancing production rates without compromising safety.

为了使丙烷脱氢过程更具商业吸引力，可以采取几种策略。一种方法是通过调整反应平衡，使丙烯的形成成为主要产物。这可以通过物理方法实现，例如使用膜来去除一个反应产物，或者通过原位催化氧化使用过渡金属氧化物。后一种方法得益于一个放热氧化作用，有助于促进脱氢过程。然而，在高温下混合氢气、氧气和碳氢化合物会引发高度危险的混合物和爆炸风险。为降低这些风险，可以采用氧选择性膜来控制氧气和有机化合物的进料速率，从而增加有机化合物的浓度，提高生产率而不影响安全性。
