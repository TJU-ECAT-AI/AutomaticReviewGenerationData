<p>For the case of ethane oxidation, it was surprisingly shown that NiO presents high catalytic activity for ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity [93] and that the method of preparation of the catalysts governs its catalytic activity [94,95].</p>
</citation>
<citation>
<p>NiO prepared by the sol-gel method [67] starts converting ethane at 275 C, and the conversion increases up to 350 C (23% conversion and 47% selectivity in ethylene), while with NiO prepared by the precipitation method [67], the yield decreases to 8% and to 3% with the NiO prepared by a microemulsion method.</p>

<p>When Nb was deposited on NiO, the catalytic activity for ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity were improved. This phenomenon was assigned to electron transfer enhancement played by Nb, leading to easier activation of the C-H bond of ethane (see above Section 4.2 & Figure 11 from [67]).</p>

<p>Other promoters such as Zr, which acts as a Lewis acid, but also Mg, Li, Ga, Ti, Ta, or alumina have also been proposed for NiO catalyst to increase ethylene yield.</p>

<p>However, ethane oxidation was also found to give acetic acid in addition to ethylene. The main processes for synthesis of acetic acid include methanol carbonylation on Rh or Ir-based catalysts (originally by Monsanto, now also by Celanes, BP-Cativa, etc.), liquid phase oxidation of acetaldehyde, n-butane, and naphta, and, more recently, ethylene oxidation in gas phase (Showa Denko), butene liquid phase oxidation (Wacker), and gas phase ethane oxidation.</p>

<p>The later reaction C2H6 + (3/2) O2 → CH3COOH + H2O is only viable if ethane is easily available on the industrial platform and cheap. Different classes of catalysts have been proposed but the highest performing one is a mixed (VNbMo)5O14 based oxide described by Thorsteinson et al. [50] with a d-spacing close to 0.40 nm The best composition was claimed to be Mo0.73V0.18Nb0.09Ox with 10% ethane conversion at 286 C and almost total selectivity to ethylene.</p>

1. NiO exhibits high catalytic activity for ethane conversion and high ethylene selectivity. The method of preparation significantly affects its activity, with sol-gel method yielding better results compared to precipitation and microemulsion methods.

2. Depositing Nb on NiO enhances its catalytic activity for ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity through electron transfer, facilitating easier activation of the C-H bond of ethane.

3. Promoters like Zr, Mg, Li, Ga, Ti, Ta, and alumina have been used to increase ethylene yield in NiO catalysts.

4. Ethane oxidation also results in acetic acid production, alongside ethylene. Acetic acid synthesis can be achieved through various methods such as methanol carbonylation, liquid phase oxidation of acetaldehyde, n-butane, and naphtha, as well as ethylene and butene oxidation.

5. A mixed (VNbMo)5O14 oxide is the most effective catalyst for ethane oxidation, achieving 10% conversion at 286 C with near-total selectivity for ethylene.

1. NiO显示了对乙烷转化和高乙烯选择性的高催化活性。制备方法显著影响其活性，溶胶凝胶法相对于沉淀法和微乳液法制得的效果更好。

2. 将Nb沉积在NiO上可以增强其对于乙烷转化和乙烯选择性的催化活性，通过电子转移，更容易激活乙烷的C-H键。

3. Zr、Mg、Li、Ga、Ti、Ta以及氧化铝等促进剂被用于提高NiO催化剂中的乙烯产率。

4. 乙烷氧化还产生乙酸，除了乙烯。可以通过多种方法合成乙酸，如甲醇羰基化、乙醛、n-丁烷和n-萘的液相氧化，以及乙烯和丁烯氧化。

5.VNbMo)5O14混合氧化物是最有效的乙烷氧化催化剂，在286 C下实现10%的转化率，并且几乎完全选择性地生成乙烯。
