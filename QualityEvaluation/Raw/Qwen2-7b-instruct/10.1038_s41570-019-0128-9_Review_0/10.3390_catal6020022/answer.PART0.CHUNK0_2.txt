<citation>Instead of molecular oxygen as the oxidant, carbon dioxide can also be used as a non-traditional oxygen source or oxidant, for instance, according to:
CH3  CH3  CO2  CH2  CH2  CO  H2O</citation>
<citation>However, in addition to ethylene, CO and water, propane and methane can be formed as a function of the catalysts used.</citation>
<citation>The use of CO2 has the advantage of producing CO and thus recovering some of the fuel capacity of the disappearing hydrogen while O2 produces water.</citation>
<citation>In addition, utilisation of CO2 should be an alternative to their valorisation.</citation>
<citation>CO2 is less aggressive than oxygen, and it is less likely to favour secondary reactions by reacting with the ethylene produced by dehydrogenation.</citation>
<citation>However, the low chemical reactivity of CO2 leads to a difficult activation, which usually results in higher reaction temperatures.</citation>
<citation>This drawback makes the use of CO2 as a selective oxidant well suited for the activation of ethane, which also requires high temperatures.</citation>

1. Carbon dioxide can be used as an alternative oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, offering benefits such as recovering hydrogen fuel capacity and reducing the likelihood of secondary reactions. However, it poses challenges due to its low chemical reactivity, requiring higher reaction temperatures for activation.

2. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation can recover some of the fuel capacity lost during the process, making it a viable alternative to traditional oxygen sources. It also reduces the risk of secondary reactions, which might occur when oxygen is used. Yet, the low reactivity of carbon dioxide necessitates higher temperatures for effective activation, which aligns well with the high temperatures needed for ethane activation in oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. The low chemical reactivity of carbon dioxide leads to difficulties in its activation, resulting in higher reaction temperatures. This characteristic makes it suitable for the activation of ethane, which also requires high temperatures for oxidative dehydrogenation. Utilizing carbon dioxide as an oxidant can serve as an alternative to traditional oxygen sources and valorize it by transforming it into useful products such as CO and water.

1. 在氧化脱氢化过程中，二氧化碳可以作为替代氧化剂使用，提供如恢复氢燃料容量和减少二次反应发生概率等优势。然而，它存在挑战，由于其低化学活性，需要更高的反应温度进行激活。

2. 使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂在氧化脱氢化过程中可以回收部分在过程中丢失的燃料容量，并且减少了当使用氧气时可能发生的二次反应的风险。然而，二氧化碳的低活性特性导致其激活困难，通常需要更高的反应温度。这与乙烷激活所需的高温度相匹配，使其适合用于乙烷的氧化脱氢化过程。

3. 二氧化碳的低化学活性导致其激活困难，需要更高的反应温度。这种特性使其适用于乙烷的激活，因为氧化脱氢化也需要高温。将二氧化碳用作氧化剂可以作为一种传统氧源的替代品，并通过将其转化为有用的产物（如CO和水）来实现其增值。
