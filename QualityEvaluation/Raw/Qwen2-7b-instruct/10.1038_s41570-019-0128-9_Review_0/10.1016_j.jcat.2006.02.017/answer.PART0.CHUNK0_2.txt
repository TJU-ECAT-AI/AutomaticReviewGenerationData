[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over five supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated, and distinct behaviors were observed."
[2] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 are better catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, because they contain many more acid sites of medium to strong and strong strength on the surface."
[3] "CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."
[4] "These different support effects may derive from the catalysts differing H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support."
[5] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."
[6] "Dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism, similar to that on pure gallium oxide."

1. The investigation focused on the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence or presence of CO2 over five supported gallium oxide catalysts, observing distinct behaviors.

2. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts showed superior dehydrogenation activity compared to Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO due to the presence of numerous medium to strong and strong acid sites on their surfaces.

3. Carbon dioxide promotes dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2, while having a negative impact on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.

4. The varied support effects can be attributed to differences in H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, resulting from the distinct interactions between gallium oxide and the support materials.

5. Pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction results with varying CO2 partial pressures demonstrate that CO2 plays dual roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role in removing absorbed H2 through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role in displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites.

6. Dehydrogenation occurs on the supported gallium oxide catalysts through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, akin to the process on pure gallium oxide.

1. 对于五种支持的镓氧化物催化剂，研究了丙烷在无二氧化碳或存在二氧化碳条件下的脱氢反应，并观察到了不同的行为。

2. Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂在脱氢活性方面优于Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO，因为它们表面含有更多的中强至强酸性位点。

3. 二氧化碳对Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂的脱氢活性有促进作用，而对于Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3催化剂则有负面影响。

4. 这些不同的支持效果可能源自催化剂的H2吸附能力差异以及酸碱性质的差异，这些差异是由镓氧化物与支持材料之间的不同相互作用引起的。

5. 脉冲反应和不同二氧化碳分压下脱氢反应的结果表明，二氧化碳在脱氢反应中扮演着双重角色：通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的H2的积极作用，以及通过置换催化剂上碱性位点吸附的丙烷的消极作用。

6. 在支持的镓氧化物催化剂上，脱氢过程可能通过异裂解反应途径发生，类似于纯镓氧化物上的过程。
