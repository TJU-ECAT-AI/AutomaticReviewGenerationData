Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated.

Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane.

The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface.

Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

The conversion of propane becomes 32, 26, and 30% in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts,respectively.

Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst.

XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species.

The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

The dehydrogenation of propane over various supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 shows distinct behaviors. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 exhibit high activity while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO are ineffective catalysts. The presence of CO2 promotes the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppresses those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The conversion of propane increases in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2. CO2 plays dual roles in the reaction: a positive role by removing adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. XPS studies reveal that the different behaviors of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts might be due to the varying interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species. The dehydrogenation reaction proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

在不同支持的镓氧化物催化剂上，丙烷在二氧化碳的存在下进行脱氢显示不同的行为。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2表现出高活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO是无效的催化剂。二氧化碳促进Ga2O3/TiO2的催化脱氢活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3。在存在二氧化碳时，丙烷的转化率在Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2上增加。二氧化碳在反应中扮演着双重角色：通过逆水-煤气转换反应移除催化剂表面吸附的H2的积极作用，以及通过将丙烷从催化剂的基本位点置换出去的消极作用。XPS研究揭示了五种支持的Ga2O3催化剂的不同行为可能是由于支持物与Ga2O3物种之间不同的相互作用造成的。脱氢反应通过异裂解反应途径进行。
