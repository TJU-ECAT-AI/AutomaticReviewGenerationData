[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated."
[2] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[4] "Dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism, similar to that on pure gallium oxide."

1. The dehydrogenation of propane to propene was studied over various supported gallium oxide catalysts, including Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2, and Ga2O3/MgO. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 showed high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for this reaction. Carbon dioxide can enhance or suppress the catalytic activity depending on the specific catalyst.

2. The promotion effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reaction varies across different supported gallium oxide catalysts. It can remove dissociatively adsorbed hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which is beneficial, but it can also displace propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites, leading to a negative impact on the reaction.

3. The dehydrogenation reaction on supported gallium oxide catalysts likely follows a heterolytic dissociation pathway, rather than a redox mechanism, which is similar to the reaction on pure gallium oxide.

1. 对不同支持的镓氧化物催化剂（包括Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3、Ga2O3/ZrO2、Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO）进行了丙烷脱氢制丙烯的研究。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂显示出高活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO对于丙烷脱氢反应无效。二氧化碳对反应的影响各不相同，既可以促进也可以抑制催化活性。

2. 二氧化碳在反应中的作用具有两面性：一方面可以去除催化剂表面吸附的离解态氢通过逆水煤气变换反应，这有益于反应；另一方面它可以置换催化剂基本位点上的丙烷，导致反应负向影响。 

3. 支持的镓氧化物催化剂上的脱氢反应可能遵循异裂解反应途径，而不是还原氧化机制，这与纯镓氧化物的反应相似。
