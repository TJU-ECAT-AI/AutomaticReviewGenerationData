The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane to propene using different supported gallium oxide catalysts in the absence or presence of CO2. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts showed high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective. High activity was linked to the abundance of medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surfaces. CO2 promoted dehydrogenation activity on Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed it on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. Pulse reaction and chemisorption results indicated that CO2 played dual roles: removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 through the reverse watergas shift reaction and displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites. XPS studies suggested that the different behaviors of the catalysts might be due to varying interactions between the support and Ga2O3 species. The dehydrogenation reaction was proposed to occur through a heterolytic dissociation pathway.

研究考察了不同支持镓氧化物催化剂在无CO2或存在CO2条件下丙烷脱氢制丙烯的情况。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂显示出高活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO则无效。高活性与催化剂表面中等强酸位点的丰富有关。CO2促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的脱氢活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。脉冲反应和化学吸附结果表明，CO2在反应中扮演了双重角色：通过逆水煤气变换反应移除催化剂表面吸附的H2以及置换基本位点上的丙烷。XPS研究表明，催化剂的不同行为可能归因于支撑体与Ga2O3物种之间不同的相互作用。提出的脱氢反应途径是通过异裂解反应。
