The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane to propene using different supported gallium oxide catalysts in the absence or presence of CO2. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts showed high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective. High activity was linked to the abundance of medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surfaces. CO2 promoted dehydrogenation activity on Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed it on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. Pulse reaction and chemisorption results indicated that CO2 played dual roles: removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 through the reverse watergas shift reaction and displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites. XPS studies suggested that the different behaviors of the catalysts might be due to varying interactions between the support and Ga2O3 species. The dehydrogenation reaction was proposed to occur through a heterolytic dissociation pathway.

研究考察了不同支持镓氧化物催化剂在无CO2或存在CO2条件下丙烷脱氢制丙烯的情况。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂显示出高活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO则无效。高活性与催化剂表面中等强酸位点的丰富有关。CO2促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的脱氢活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。脉冲反应和化学吸附结果表明，CO2在反应中扮演了双重角色：通过逆水煤气变换反应移除催化剂表面吸附的H2以及置换基本位点上的丙烷。XPS研究表明，催化剂的不同行为可能归因于支撑体与Ga2O3物种之间不同的相互作用。提出的脱氢反应途径是通过异裂解反应。

1. The dehydrogenation of propane to propene was studied over various supported gallium oxide catalysts, including Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2, and Ga2O3/MgO. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 showed high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for this reaction. Carbon dioxide can enhance or suppress the catalytic activity depending on the specific catalyst.

2. The promotion effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reaction varies across different supported gallium oxide catalysts. It can remove dissociatively adsorbed hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which is beneficial, but it can also displace propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites, leading to a negative impact on the reaction.

3. The dehydrogenation reaction on supported gallium oxide catalysts likely follows a heterolytic dissociation pathway, rather than a redox mechanism, which is similar to the reaction on pure gallium oxide.

1. 对不同支持的镓氧化物催化剂（包括Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3、Ga2O3/ZrO2、Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO）进行了丙烷脱氢制丙烯的研究。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂显示出高活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO对于丙烷脱氢反应无效。二氧化碳对反应的影响各不相同，既可以促进也可以抑制催化活性。

2. 二氧化碳在反应中的作用具有两面性：一方面可以去除催化剂表面吸附的离解态氢通过逆水煤气变换反应，这有益于反应；另一方面它可以置换催化剂基本位点上的丙烷，导致反应负向影响。 

3. 支持的镓氧化物催化剂上的脱氢反应可能遵循异裂解反应途径，而不是还原氧化机制，这与纯镓氧化物的反应相似。

1. The investigation focused on the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence or presence of CO2 over five supported gallium oxide catalysts, observing distinct behaviors.

2. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts showed superior dehydrogenation activity compared to Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO due to the presence of numerous medium to strong and strong acid sites on their surfaces.

3. Carbon dioxide promotes dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2, while having a negative impact on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.

4. The varied support effects can be attributed to differences in H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, resulting from the distinct interactions between gallium oxide and the support materials.

5. Pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction results with varying CO2 partial pressures demonstrate that CO2 plays dual roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role in removing absorbed H2 through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role in displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites.

6. Dehydrogenation occurs on the supported gallium oxide catalysts through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, akin to the process on pure gallium oxide.

1. 对于五种支持的镓氧化物催化剂，研究了丙烷在无二氧化碳或存在二氧化碳条件下的脱氢反应，并观察到了不同的行为。

2. Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂在脱氢活性方面优于Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO，因为它们表面含有更多的中强至强酸性位点。

3. 二氧化碳对Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂的脱氢活性有促进作用，而对于Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3催化剂则有负面影响。

4. 这些不同的支持效果可能源自催化剂的H2吸附能力差异以及酸碱性质的差异，这些差异是由镓氧化物与支持材料之间的不同相互作用引起的。

5. 脉冲反应和不同二氧化碳分压下脱氢反应的结果表明，二氧化碳在脱氢反应中扮演着双重角色：通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的H2的积极作用，以及通过置换催化剂上碱性位点吸附的丙烷的消极作用。

6. 在支持的镓氧化物催化剂上，脱氢过程可能通过异裂解反应途径发生，类似于纯镓氧化物上的过程。

Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated.

Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane.

The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface.

Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

The conversion of propane becomes 32, 26, and 30% in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts,respectively.

Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst.

XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species.

The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.
