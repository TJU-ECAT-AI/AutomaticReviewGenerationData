Various support materials and reaction conditions influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The study focuses on the effects of CO2 partial pressure, different support materials like TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO, and the behavior of CO2 in the reaction. The key challenges include optimizing the overall performance of the catalysts. Trade-offs involve balancing the promotional effect of CO2 on activity with its negative impact on selectivity and stability.
