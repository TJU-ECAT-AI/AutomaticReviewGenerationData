1. The activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are significantly influenced by the support materials used. Among the materials tested, silica (SiO2) supports demonstrated the highest conversion, ethylene selectivity, and stability. The type of support impacts the distribution of chromium oxide on the support surface and its redox properties, thereby affecting the overall catalytic behavior.

2. The performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation is highly dependent on the interaction between chromium oxide (Cr2O3) and the support material. Different support materials lead to variations in the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. For instance, silica (SiO2) supports tend to exhibit superior performance compared to others like zirconia (ZrO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and titanium oxide (TiO2) in terms of conversion, ethylene selectivity, and stability. The specific properties of each support, including its acidity/basicity and redox characteristics, play crucial roles in determining the catalytic efficiency of the Cr2O3-based catalysts.

1. 在本研究中制备的催化剂中，Cr2O3/SiO2展现出更高的转化率、乙烯选择性和稳定性。不同支持材料对铬氧化物的分布和还原性产生影响，进而决定了负载型Cr2O3催化剂的催化行为。

2. 铬氧化物在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的性能高度依赖于铬氧化物与支持材料之间的相互作用。不同的支持材料导致催化剂性能的显著差异。例如，与锆氧（ZrO2）、铝氧（Al2O3）和钛氧（TiO2）相比，硅氧（SiO2）支持表现出更优的性能，在转化率、乙烯选择性和稳定性方面。每种支持材料的具体性质，包括其酸碱性及其还原性，对Cr2O3基催化剂的催化效率起到关键作用。
