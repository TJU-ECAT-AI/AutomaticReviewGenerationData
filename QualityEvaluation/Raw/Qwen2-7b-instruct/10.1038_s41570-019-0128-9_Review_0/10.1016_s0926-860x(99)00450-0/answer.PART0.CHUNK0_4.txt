[1] "Among catalysts prepared in this investigation, Cr2O3/SiO2 exhibits higher conversion, ethylene selectivity and stability."
[2] "Cr2O3/SiO2 shows the highest ethane conversion, while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrates the lowest activity, even lower than that of the unsupported Cr2O3 catalyst."
[3] "Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher methane selectivity, suggesting that it favors the cracking of ethane."
[4] "The nature of the support exerts an influence upon chromium species and redox properties, which in return determine the catalytic behavior of the supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

How do various support materials and reaction conditions influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

Various support materials, including SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, Cr2O3/SiO2 exhibits higher conversion, ethylene selectivity, and stability compared to other catalysts. The nature of the support affects the distribution of chromium oxide on the support and the surface chromium species structure, impacting the catalytic behavior. Challenges and trade-offs include optimizing the redox properties of the catalysts, balancing the selectivity towards ethylene versus other products, and maintaining stability over multiple reaction cycles. The key lies in understanding how the support influences the chromium species and redox properties, which ultimately dictate the catalytic performance.
