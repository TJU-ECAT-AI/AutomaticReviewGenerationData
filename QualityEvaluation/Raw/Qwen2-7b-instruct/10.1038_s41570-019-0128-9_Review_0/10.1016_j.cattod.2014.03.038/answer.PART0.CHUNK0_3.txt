[1] "SAPO-34 has high catalytic activity for the MTO reaction because it can form a catalytic hydrocarbon pool that is trapped in its cages, but the hydrocarbon species can also cause fast deactivation by causing coke formation."
[2] "The slower coke deposit rate on TS-H would be due to its lower acidity, since coke has to be formed by oligomerization, which needs a high density of acid sites."
[3] "The effect on propene is larger than on ethene which would be because propene is larger and would be more liable to suffer diffusion limitation than ethene, that is, this explanation is consistent with the higher selectivity to propene on TS-H."
[4] "Both the hierarchical structure and moderate acidity contributed to significantly improve TS-Hs catalytic performance in MTO."

1.SAPO-34 exhibits high catalytic activity in the MTO process because it can trap hydrocarbon pools within its cages. However, the hydrocarbon molecules can lead to rapid deactivation by causing coke formation.
2.The slower rate of coke deposition on TS-H can be attributed to its lower acidity, as coke formation necessitates a high density of acid sites, and TS-H has fewer of these sites.
3.Propene experiences a greater impact than ethene due to its larger size, making it more susceptible to diffusion limitations. This is in line with the higher selectivity of propene on TS-H.
4.Both the hierarchical structure and moderate acidity have significantly enhanced the catalytic performance of TS-H in the MTO process.

1.SAPO-34在MTO过程中表现出高的催化活性，因为它可以在其笼子中捕获催化烃池。然而，烃分子可能会因导致焦炭形成而快速失效。
2.TS-H的焦炭沉积速率较慢可以归因于其较低的酸性，因为焦炭的形成需要高密度的酸性位点，而TS-H具有较少的这些位点。
3.丙烯受到的影响大于乙烷，因为丙烯的尺寸更大，更容易受到扩散限制。这与TS-H上丙烯的选择性更高一致。
4.层级结构和适中的酸性共同显著提高了TS-H在MTO过程中的催化性能。
