3.1. "In the gas adsorption curves in Fig. 3a, the Ar adsorption at low P/P0 was due to micropores, and these data showed that the micropore size and amount were the same for the two samples. However, in the region near P/P0 = 1, there was Ar adsorption on TS-H but not on TS-C, which indicated that TS-H also has large pores but TS-C does not."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of large pores in TS-H but not in TS-C was identified through Ar adsorption data. These large pores were confirmed by mercury penetration measurements, showing an average diameter of 200 nm in TS-H, which corresponds to the macropores found in the SEM results.

3.2. "Curve fitting of the response curves with the diffusion equation gave the apparent diffusion coefficient of propene in TS-H as 1.1 × 10^(-13) m^2/s (Table 1) and showed that it was one order of magnitude larger than that in TS-C."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The diffusion coefficient of propene in TS-H, calculated by fitting the response curves, was 1.1 × 10^(-13) m^2/s, which was one order of magnitude greater than that in TS-C.

3.3. "As shown in Fig. 6, at the beginning of reaction, the activity of TS-C was slightly higher than that of TS-H. However, after 5 min, the conversion of TS-C had dropped rapidly to be below 10%, while that of TS-H was maintained at 15% up to 40 min reaction time."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
As depicted in Figure 6, at the start of the reaction, the activity of TS-C was slightly greater than that of TS-H. Yet, after 5 minutes, the conversion of TS-C sharply declined to under 10%, whereas the conversion of TS-H stayed at around 15% until the 40-minute mark.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
如图6所示，在反应开始时，TS-C的活性略高于TS-H。然而，在5分钟后，TS-C的转化率迅速下降至低于10%，而TS-H的转化率保持在大约15%直到40分钟。

3.4. "The selectivity to propane was stable at 22% on TS-H, which was 5% higher than the highest value on TS-C."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
On TS-H, the selectivity to propane was steady at 22%, which was 5% higher than the maximum value observed on TS-C.

3.5. "The selectivity to butene was stable at 22% on TS-H, which was 5% higher than the highest value on TS-C."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
On TS-H, the selectivity to butene remained constant at 22%, which was 5% higher than the highest value found on TS-C.

3.6. "The methane selectivity confirmed the quite different deactivation rates of the two catalysts as on TS-C, it increased remarkably after 20 min; but on TS-H, it was always quite low."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The methane selectivity corroborated the markedly differing deactivation rates of the two catalysts, with a significant increase in TS-C after 20 minutes, whereas it remained rather low on TS-H.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
甲烷选择性证实了两种催化剂不同的失活速率，TS-C在20分钟后显著增加；而在TS-H上，它始终相当低。

3.7. "The explanation that the lower value for TS-H was due to the fewer acid sites on TS-H assumed that propane was produced by olefin oligomerization and then beta scission of the oligomer, and that oligomerization is promoted by a high density of acid sites."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The rationale behind the lower propane selectivity on TS-H was attributed to the lesser number of acid sites on TS-H. It was hypothesized that propane formation occurred via olefin oligomerization followed by beta scission of the oligomer, with oligomerization being facilitated by a high concentration of acid sites.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
TS-H上较低的丙烷选择性归因于TS-H上酸位点的数量较少。推测丙烷形成是通过烯烃聚合物化然后分解聚合物的β裂解过程实现的，且聚合物化过程是由大量酸位点促进的。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
3.8. "Consistent with this explanation is the result that the effect on propene is larger than on ethene which would be because propene is larger and would be more liable to suffer diffusion limitation than ethene, that is, this explanation is consistent with the higher selectivity to propene on TS-H."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This explanation aligns with the observation that the impact on propene is more pronounced than on ethene, given propene's larger size making it more prone to diffusion limitations compared to ethene, which is consistent with the greater propene selectivity on TS-H.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
这一解释与以下观察结果一致：丙烯的影响大于乙烷，因为丙烯较大，更易遭受扩散限制，这与TS-H上较高的丙烯选择性一致。

3.9. "Thus, both the hierarchical structure and moderate acidity contributed to significantly improve TS-Hs catalytic performance in MTO process."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Consequently, both the hierarchical structure and moderate acidity played a pivotal role in substantially enhancing TS-H’s catalytic performance in the MTO process.
