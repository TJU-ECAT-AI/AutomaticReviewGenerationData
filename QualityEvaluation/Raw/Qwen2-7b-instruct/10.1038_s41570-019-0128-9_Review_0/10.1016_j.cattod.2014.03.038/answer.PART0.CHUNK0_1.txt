[1] "The production of the hierarchical morphological structure did not need an extra template or demetallation procedure."
[2] "In addition, it fortuitously had milder acidity due to the lower Si/Al ratio."
[3] "The hierarchical structure resulted in a shorter diffusion distance for the gaseous products because the macropores separated the solid phase into small zeolitic phase crystallites."
[4] "The shorter diffusion distance and lower acidity resulted in higher selectivities to propene (44%) and butenes (22%), and lower selectivities to propane (0.5%) and coke (14%), which preserved a longer lifetime for the catalyst and a higher yield of alkenes in the MTO process."

The hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite was synthesized with a decreased Si content in the gel mixture, which resulted in a lower Si/Al ratio and a milder acidity. The well-ordered macropores separated the solid phase into small zeolitic phase crystallites, leading to a shorter diffusion distance for gaseous products. This, combined with the lower acidity, improved the selectivities to propene and butenes while reducing the selectivities to propane and coke. As a result, the catalyst preserved a longer lifetime and provided a higher yield of alkenes in the MTO process.

合成的层级SAPO-34/18沸石使用了胶液混合物中Si含量的减少，导致Si/Al比降低和酸性减弱。有序的大孔将固体相分成了小的沸石晶体，使得气体产物的扩散距离更短。结合较低的酸性，提高了丙烯（44%）和丁二烯（22%）的选择性，同时降低了丙烷（0.5%）和焦炭（14%）的选择性。因此，催化剂保持了更长的使用寿命，并在MTO过程中提供了更高的烯烃产率。
