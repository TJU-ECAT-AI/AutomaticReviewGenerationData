[1] "SAPO-34 has high catalytic activity for the MTO reaction because it can form a catalytic hydrocarbon pool that is trapped in its cages, but the hydrocarbon species can also cause fast deactivation by causing coke formation."
[2] "Our results above are in good agreement with these strategies. The slower coke deposit rate on TS-H would be due to its lower acidity, since coke has to be formed by oligomerization, which needs a high density of acid sites."
[3] "The slower coke deposit rate on TS-H would be due to its lower acidity [5], since coke has to be formed by oligomerization, which needs a high density of acid sites and the very low propane selectivity of TS-H verified that its oligomerization reaction rate was slow."
[4] "The second factor of the diffusion rates makes use of the consideration that when the diffusion distance of alkenes inside the particle is long, this can result in the further conversion of these molecules into coke."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions can be influenced by various factors such as support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure). For instance, SiO2 can affect the activity and selectivity by altering the surface area and pore structure, while MCM-41 can influence the stability and mechanistic pathways through its ordered mesoporous structure. H-ZSM-5, with its high acidity, can enhance the activity but may reduce selectivity. Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 can act as promoters, improving the overall performance by tuning acidity or enhancing thermal stability. Reaction conditions such as CO2 partial pressure can also impact the reaction kinetics and selectivity, affecting the formation of desired products like alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of these catalysts involve balancing high activity with high selectivity, maintaining stability over multiple reaction cycles, and controlling the formation of byproducts like coke. For example, increasing acidity can enhance the activity but may lead to faster coke formation, which can deplete the active sites and reduce the overall efficiency of the catalyst. Similarly, increasing the reaction temperature to promote faster reactions might also increase coke formation, necessitating careful control of operating conditions.

In summary, optimizing the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions requires a comprehensive understanding of how various factors interact and influence the catalytic process. Careful selection of support materials, precise tuning of reaction conditions, and strategic design of catalyst structures are crucial for achieving high activity, selectivity, and stability, while minimizing unwanted side reactions and byproducts.

[1] "The production of the hierarchical morphological structure did not need an extra template or demetallation procedure."
[2] "In addition, it fortuitously had milder acidity due to the lower Si/Al ratio."
[3] "The hierarchical structure resulted in a shorter diffusion distance for the gaseous products because the macropores separated the solid phase into small zeolitic phase crystallites."
[4] "The shorter diffusion distance and lower acidity resulted in higher selectivities to propene (44%) and butenes (22%), and lower selectivities to propane (0.5%) and coke (14%), which preserved a longer lifetime for the catalyst and a higher yield of alkenes in the MTO process."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite was synthesized with a decreased Si content in the gel mixture, which resulted in a lower Si/Al ratio and a milder acidity. The well-ordered macropores separated the solid phase into small zeolitic phase crystallites, leading to a shorter diffusion distance for gaseous products. This, combined with the lower acidity, improved the selectivities to propene and butenes while reducing the selectivities to propane and coke. As a result, the catalyst preserved a longer lifetime and provided a higher yield of alkenes in the MTO process.

合成的层级SAPO-34/18沸石使用了胶液混合物中Si含量的减少，导致Si/Al比降低和酸性减弱。有序的大孔将固体相分成了小的沸石晶体，使得气体产物的扩散距离更短。结合较低的酸性，提高了丙烯（44%）和丁二烯（22%）的选择性，同时降低了丙烷（0.5%）和焦炭（14%）的选择性。因此，催化剂保持了更长的使用寿命，并在MTO过程中提供了更高的烯烃产率。

[1] "The method did not need to use extra template or demetallation procedures to produce the hierarchical structure."
[2] "The advantage of having macropores in the particle is that they separate the solid zeolitic phase into patches so that the particle is virtually comprised of many much smaller crystallites, which results in much short diffusion distances inside these small inter- nal zeolitic crystallites as compared to the diffusion distance in a solid particle of the same size without macropores."
[3] "The catalyst development of the SAPO-34 catalyst have focused on getting better stability and meeting the industrial needs for a higher selectivity to olefins, especially propene."
[4] "Concerning the acidity, Mees et al. [5] reported that the coking of a SAPO-34 catalyst decreased linearly with acidity, and that with the decreased coking, the ethene/ethane and propene/propane ratios increased."
[5] "The selectivity to propene of TS-H increased slightly from 42% to 44% with TOS, which is a slightly higher selectivity than that reported for a nanosized SAPO-34 catalyst [7] and a low-silica AlPO-34 [13]."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite was synthesized by simply changing the gel composition without needing an additional template or demetallation process.
2. Macropores in the particle structure break the solid zeolitic phase into smaller crystallites, resulting in shorter diffusion distances within these crystallites compared to a solid particle of the same size without macropores.
3. Catalyst development for SAPO-34 has aimed at enhancing stability and achieving higher olefin selectivity, particularly for propene.
4. Decreasing the acidity of the SAPO-34 catalyst leads to a linear decrease in coke formation, and consequently increases the ethene/ethane and propene/propane ratios.
5. The selectivity to propene on TS-H slightly increased from 42% to 44% with time on stream (TOS), offering a higher selectivity compared to a nanosized SAPO-34 catalyst and a low-silica AlPO-34.

2. 颗粒结构中的大孔将固体沸石相分成多个小晶粒，导致这些晶粒内部的扩散距离远短于相同大小但无大孔的固体颗粒。
3. SAPO-34催化剂的开发旨在提高稳定性并实现更高的烯烃选择性，尤其是丙烯。
4. 减少SAPO-34催化剂的酸度会导致焦炭形成线性减少，并且相应地增加了乙烯/乙烷和丙烯/丙烷的比例。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1.SAPO-34 exhibits high catalytic activity in the MTO process because it can trap hydrocarbon pools within its cages. However, the hydrocarbon molecules can lead to rapid deactivation by causing coke formation.
2.The slower rate of coke deposition on TS-H can be attributed to its lower acidity, as coke formation necessitates a high density of acid sites, and TS-H has fewer of these sites.
3.Propene experiences a greater impact than ethene due to its larger size, making it more susceptible to diffusion limitations. This is in line with the higher selectivity of propene on TS-H.
4.Both the hierarchical structure and moderate acidity have significantly enhanced the catalytic performance of TS-H in the MTO process.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1.SAPO-34在MTO过程中表现出高的催化活性，因为它可以在其笼子中捕获催化烃池。然而，烃分子可能会因导致焦炭形成而快速失效。
2.TS-H的焦炭沉积速率较慢可以归因于其较低的酸性，因为焦炭的形成需要高密度的酸性位点，而TS-H具有较少的这些位点。
3.丙烯受到的影响大于乙烷，因为丙烯的尺寸更大，更容易受到扩散限制。这与TS-H上丙烯的选择性更高一致。
4.层级结构和适中的酸性共同显著提高了TS-H在MTO过程中的催化性能。

3.1. "In the gas adsorption curves in Fig. 3a, the Ar adsorption at low P/P0 was due to micropores, and these data showed that the micropore size and amount were the same for the two samples. However, in the region near P/P0 = 1, there was Ar adsorption on TS-H but not on TS-C, which indicated that TS-H also has large pores but TS-C does not."

3.3. "As shown in Fig. 6, at the beginning of reaction, the activity of TS-C was slightly higher than that of TS-H. However, after 5 min, the conversion of TS-C had dropped rapidly to be below 10%, while that of TS-H was maintained at 15% up to 40 min reaction time."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
As depicted in Figure 6, at the start of the reaction, the activity of TS-C was slightly greater than that of TS-H. Yet, after 5 minutes, the conversion of TS-C sharply declined to under 10%, whereas the conversion of TS-H stayed at around 15% until the 40-minute mark.

<quotes>
3.7. "The explanation that the lower value for TS-H was due to the fewer acid sites on TS-H assumed that propane was produced by olefin oligomerization and then beta scission of the oligomer, and that oligomerization is promoted by a high density of acid sites."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The rationale behind the lower propane selectivity on TS-H was attributed to the lesser number of acid sites on TS-H. It was hypothesized that propane formation occurred via olefin oligomerization followed by beta scission of the oligomer, with oligomerization being facilitated by a high concentration of acid sites.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
TS-H上较低的丙烷选择性归因于TS-H上酸位点的数量较少。推测丙烷形成是通过烯烃聚合物化然后分解聚合物的β裂解过程实现的，且聚合物化过程是由大量酸位点促进的。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
3.8. "Consistent with this explanation is the result that the effect on propene is larger than on ethene which would be because propene is larger and would be more liable to suffer diffusion limitation than ethene, that is, this explanation is consistent with the higher selectivity to propene on TS-H."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This explanation aligns with the observation that the impact on propene is more pronounced than on ethene, given propene's larger size making it more prone to diffusion limitations compared to ethene, which is consistent with the greater propene selectivity on TS-H.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
这一解释与以下观察结果一致：丙烯的影响大于乙烷，因为丙烯较大，更易遭受扩散限制，这与TS-H上较高的丙烯选择性一致。
