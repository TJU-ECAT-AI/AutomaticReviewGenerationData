Introduction
SAPO-34
zeolite is of interest for the methanol-to-olefins
(MTO)
process because its large cages,small windows and milder acid- ity compared to
ZSM-5
give it higher selectivities to alkenes [1].
However,while its small window size gives it shape selectivity to light alkenes,it also leads to diffusion limitation of the reac- tion because this causes large hydrocarbon molecules and coke to remain in the cages [24].
Thus,catalyst development of the
SAPO-
34 catalyst have focused on getting better stability and meeting the industrial needs for a higher selectivity to olefins,especially propene.
There have been two main strategies for these:(1) use
SAPO-34
that has only mild acidity [5,6],and (2) use tiny zeolite crystallites,either as nanosized particles or as large particles with a hierarchical structure [712].
Concerning the acidity, Mees et al.
[5] reported that the coking of a
SAPO-34
catalyst decreased linearly with acidity,and that with the decreased coking,the ethene/ethane and propene/propane ratios increased.
A
SAPO-34
catalyst with very low density acid sites,described as an AlPO-34 zeolite by the authors [13],was reported to give a high selectivity to alkenes in Corresponding author.

MTO
reaction.
Concerning the second strategy,very fine zeo- lite crystals are difficult to use and would give high operational costs,and so hierarchically structured crystals are considered more practical [14].
Although there are many methods to prepare hierarchical zeolites,including the use of special template [11,15,16] and demetallation procedures [1719],these suffered from one or more of the following problems:complicated synthesis procedure,high cost of template,difficult to scale up or the possibility of contam- ination because more templates or more procedures are involved.
Here,we reported a simple method to prepare a hierarchical
SAPO-
34/18 zeolite with well-ordered macropores and low acidity which was obtained by simply changing the ratio of silica sol to pseu- doboehmite,orthophosphoric acid and triethylamine
(TEA)
used in the starting gel.
The method did not need to use extra template or demetallation procedures to produce the hierarchical structure.
The advantage of having macropores in the particle is that they separate the solid zeolitic phase into patches so that the particle is virtually comprised of many much smaller crystallites,which results in much short diffusion distances inside these small inter- nal zeolitic crystallites as compared to the diffusion distance in a solid particle of the same size without macropores.
Fortuitously,the composition of the raw materials used for the zeolite synthesis also gave the zeolite a lower acidity,which was further advantageous http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2014.03.038 0920-5861/ 2014 Elsevier

Experimental
2.1.
Preparation of hierarchical
SAPO-34/18
zeolite The catalysts were synthesized by the hydrothermal method.
The reagents used were silica sol (40 wt% SiO2),pseudoboehmite (73 wt% Al2O3),orthophosphoric acid (85 wt%
H3PO4)
and triethyl- amine
(TEA).
Samples with two different morphological structures were synthesized hydrothermally by changing the gel composi- tion of Al2O3:xSiO2:1.15P2O5:2.7TEA:114H2O (x =
0.050.5).
Just by changing the value of x,two kinds of
SAPO-34/18
particles were obtained:particles with a conventional solid structure with a high framework Si/Al ratio (named
TS-C,
x =
0.5)
and particles with a hierarchical structure with a low framework Si/Al ratio (named
TS-H,
x =
0.05).
In the synthesis,the gel mixture was put into a stainless steel autoclave lined with Teflon where it was first aged for 24 h and then heated at
200 C
for 20 h.
After cooling the product to room temperature,the zeolite was recovered by centrifuging and washed thoroughly with deionized water.
Then the sample was dried at
110 C
for 8 h and calcined in air at
600 C
for 4 h to remove the
TEA
template.
2.2.
Characterization Scanning electron microscope
(SEM)
images were obtained with a high resolution scanning electron microscope
(JEOL,
JSM-7401)
operated at 23 kV.
Elemental analysis was performed by energy dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS;
JSM
7401F)
and by inductively cou- pled plasma-mass spectrometry
(ICP-MAS).
X-ray diffraction
(XRD)
spectra were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max-RB diffractometer using Cu
K
radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA.
NH3-TPD
analysis was car- ried out on an automated chemisorption analyzer (Quantachrome ChemBETPlusar) from 100 to
600 C
with a temperature increase of 10 C/min.
Ar adsorption isotherms at 87
K
were obtained with an automated physisorption analyzer (Quantachrome Autosorb iQ2).
Mercury penetration measurements were conducted on a Micromeritics AutoPore
IV
9500.
Laser particle size analysis was used to get the sample size using a Master Sizer 3000,for which the sample was placed in a wet dispersion.
2.3.
Diffusion rate measurements Diffusion coefficient measurements were made with the sam- ple placed as a fixed bed in an apparatus designed to perform the chromatographic method [20].
Before the measurement,the sam- ple was dehydrated at
500 C
for 2 h in argon flow.
After the catalyst had cooled to the measurement temperature
(40 C
for propene and
100 C
for propane),which was chosen using preliminary experi- ments to determine the conditions where the adsorbates did not react,a carrier gas containing 10 mol% propene (or propane) was passed through the zeolite bed for 1 h to saturate the sample.
A
step change in the adsorbate concentration was then introduced by fast response mass flow controllers that were used to stop the adsorbate flow and increase the carrier gas flow rate to keep the total flow rate constant.
The adsorbate concentration at the exit of the zeolite bed versus time (response curve) was recorded with a mass spectrometer
(MS,
Stanford Research Systems
RGA-200).
The diffusion coefficients were obtained by curve fitting the response curves to the parameters in an axial dispersion chromatographic model that included internal diffusion in the zeolite.
2.4.
TGGC
catalyst activity testing The coke accumulated in the catalysts were analyzed using a thermogravimetry
(TG)
and gas chromatography
(GC)
combina- tion equipment.
TG
and
GC
were used,respectively,to detect the solid and gas phase products.
The
TG
apparatus (Mettler Toledo,
TGA/DSC-1/1500)
functioned as a reactor that was used to measure the sample weight online,which gave the accumulated coke mass in the sample as a function of reaction time.
The
MTO
reaction in the
TGGC
equipment was carried out at
400 C
and atmospheric pres- sure with a feed concentration of
10.0
mol% methanol and
3.7
mg catalyst.
The feed was Ar as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 40 cm3/min
(STP)
which was saturated with methanol by flowing it through a bottle containing methanol placed in a thermostatic bath.
The composition of the gaseous product at the outlet of the
TGGC
equipment was determined as a function of reaction time by col- lecting gas samples at specified times in an automated
GC
sampling valve with 10 sample loops,which collected gaseous product data from the same experiment that was used to get the coking rate data.
The gas samples were analyzed offline by a
GC
(Agilent
7890A)
with a capillary
PLOT
Q
column (60 m,
0.53
mm i.d.,
70 C
to
220 C
at 4 C/min and kept for 20 min) and a
FID
detector.

Results
3.1.
Catalyst characterization The
SEM
images in Fig. 1 showed that there were large morpho- logical differences between
TS-C
and
TS-H.
TS-C
comprised solid cubic particles with smooth surfaces (Fig. 1a),which is a morphol- ogy that is commonly reported for particles of
SAPO-34.
In contrast,the surfaces of
TS-H
(Fig. 1b and c) had plentiful 50 to 500 nm macropore openings.
From a large number of observations using
SEM,
it was observed that the pore distribution on the
TS-H
sur- face had regularity,that is,they were observed to be well-ordered macropores with a unique structure which differed from those pre- viously reported for mesoporous [21] and layered [8]
SAPO-34.
The
3D
MAX
software was used with the images of the cross-section (e.g., Fig. 1c) to deduce the morphological structure of the obviously hierarchical nature of
TS-H
(Fig. 1d).
The result indicated that the hierarchical cubic catalyst particle was composed of four pyra- mids and two frustums,which were,respectively,about 2 m high and 400 nm thick.
The macropores at the crisscross intersection of the four pyramids were directed straight inwards to form a three dimensional well-ordered channel network,which was seen clearly in the cutaway view of the
TS-H
zeolites.
The macropore channels also passed through the two opposing frustums.
The
EDS
analysis of the elemental compositions of the molec- ular sieves gave the framework Si/Al atomic ratio of
TS-H
as
0.11
and that of
TS-C
as
0.21.
The Si/Al ratios of
TS-H
and
TS-C
measured by
ICP-MS
were
0.12
and
0.23,
in agreement with the measure- ment by
EDS.
The peaks in the
XRD
patterns of the samples were assigned by comparing them with those of standard
CHA
and
AEI
structures.
In the
XRD
pattern of
TS-H
(Fig. 2),the peaks at
16.9,
19.6,
21.3,
24.1
and
26.3indicated
the existence of the
AEI
structure,in addition to the standard
CHA
structure of
SAPO-34.
In addi- tion,the absence of a peak at
10.6indicated
that the
CHA
and
AEI
structures were not just physically mixed particles.
The
XRD
pattern of the catalyst was simulated using DIFFaX [10],a special- ized computer program for studying crystals with stacking faults,which indicated the sample was an intergrowth structure with the
CHA/AEI
structures,namely,a
SAPO-34
and
SAPO-18
intergrowth crystal with a
CHA
and
AEI
structure ratio of
8:2.
The
XRD
pattern of
TS-C
was almost the same as that of
TS-H.

CHA/AEI
intergrowth zeolites,and these were called
SAPO-34/18
in this paper.
Fig. 3 shows the pore size distribution curves for the zeolites.
In the gas adsorption curves in Fig. 3a,the Ar adsorption at low
P/P0
was due to micropores,and these data showed that the micropore size and amount were the same for the two samples.
However,in the region near
P/P0 =
1,there was Ar adsorption on
TS-H
but not on
TS-C,
which indicated that
TS-H
also has large pores but
TS-C
does not.
Mercury penetration was also used to characterize these macropores,and the data are shown in Fig. 3b.
The impor- tant data are the first peak of
TS-H
with an average diameter of 200 nm,which was due to the macropores inside the powder par- ticles.
These macropores correspond to the macropores shown in the
SEM
result in Fig. 1c,and these data verified the
SEM
result of the presence of macropores in
TS-H
but none in
TS-C,
while it was discussed above that the
SEM
result further indicated that these macropores were well-ordered.
Concerning the other features in the mercury penetration data in Fig. 3b,the particle size of the two samples suggested that the peak for
TS-C
at 600 nm and the peak for
TS-H
at 1200 nm should be attributed to the void spaces between particles since these were at about the size of the parti- cles.
It is discussed below that the presence of macropores in the zeolite was important because of its effect,which was to divide 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5

This is a result that is consistent with that of Liu et al.

In our work,this advantage was attributed to the shorter diffusion distance in the zeolitic phase in the hierarchical structure which resulted in much less intracrystalline diffusion resistance,that is,the presence of the macropores in
TS-H
benefited catalytic performance by making the solid phase comprised of small crys- tallites that have a short mass transfer distance.
The Ar adsorption isotherms of
TS-C
and
TS-H
also showed no obvious hysteresis loop,which indicated that there was no mesoporous structure in both samples.
The specific surface areas and total pore volumes of the two samples,shown in Table 1,were very close to each other.
The
NH3-TPD
curves in Fig. 4 showed NH3 desorption peaks at
200 C
and
425 C.
The peak areas of
TS-C
were twice those of
TS-
H,
which was consistent with the elemental analysis data on the ratio of the Si/Al ratios of the two samples (2).
The Si/Al ratio and the higher temperature NH3 peak both gave the acid site density of
TS-H
as
1.0
mmol/g.
3.2.
Diffusion rates Typical response curves of propene diffusing out from
TS-C
and
TS-H
at
40 C
are shown in Fig. 5,which showed that there was a large difference in the diffusion rates inside the two samples.
The gas diffusion out from
TS-H
was clearly much faster than from
TS-C.
Curve fitting of the response curves with the diffusion equa- tion gave the apparent diffusion coefficient of propene in
TS-H
as
1.1
× 1013 m2/s (Table 1) and showed that it was one order of mag- nitude larger than that in
TS-C.
The measured smaller diffusion coefficient of propene in
TS-C
was in fair agreement with the value reported in Ref.
[22].
The apparent diffusion coefficients of propane for the two samples also showed a similar trend,that is,the appar- ent diffusion coefficient in
TS-H
was much larger than that in
TS-C.
Since the particle size of
TS-H
was about the same as that of
TS-
C,
and since their crystalline phases were the same (which would mean that the diffusion rates were the same inside the crystalline phases),these data indicated that the effective diffusion path in
TS-
H
was significantly reduced by the presence of macropores in the 100 200 300 400 500 600

Since

MTO
reaction The conversion of methanol over the two catalysts and their selectivities to the products of the
MTO
reaction,including coke and gaseous products,measured by
TGGC
are shown in Figs. 6 and

In the experiment,the conversion was kept low in order to approx- imate a differential reactor so that the conversion can be used to give a quantitative comparison of the activities of the two sam- ples.

the inlet).
Dimethyl ether in the product was treated as unreacted methanol because experimental observations obtained with it as a feed showed that it reacts via its conversion to methanol [23].
As shown in Fig. 6,at the beginning of reaction,the activity of
TS-
C
was slightly higher than that of
TS-H.
However,after 5 min,the conversion of
TS-C
had dropped rapidly to be below 10%,while that of
TS-H
was maintained at 15% up to 40 min reaction time.
SAPO-
34 has high catalytic activity for the
MTO
reaction because it can form a catalytic hydrocarbon pool that is trapped in its cages,but the hydrocarbon species can also cause fast deactivation by caus- ing coke formation [9,24].
Thus,it is of interest to understand more about the coke formation,which was shown by the weight of coke on the sample versus time on stream
(TOS).
These data are shown in Fig. 6,which showed that as a function of
TOS,
the amount of coke accumulated on the two samples were different.
With
TS-C,
the rate of coking in the initial stage of reaction was fast,but after 15 min,the weight ratio of coke in the catalyst was stabilized at 14%,which is a similar result with Chen et al.
[24].
After that,it only increased slightly with
TOS.
The trend was quite different with
TS-H,
on which the coke accumulated slowly and almost linearly with
TOS,
and the amount was always lower than that in
TS-C.
This difference with
TS-H
as the catalyst would be due to its low acidity and hierarchical structure.
Many data sets of catalyst activity reported in the literature use only the gaseous products to calculate reaction rates because there was no online collection of coke data.
This would underestimate the activity and overestimate the selectivity of gaseous products if the coking rate was not negligible.
When the coke selectivity is not low enough to be ignored,the conversions to all products includ- ing coke should be used to get the accurate measure of catalyst activity and product selectivities.
Fig. 7 gives the selectivities to the main gaseous products and coke on the two catalysts determined by
TGGC.
The selectivity to propene of
TS-H
increased slightly from 42% to 44% with
TOS,
which is a slightly higher selectivity than that reported for a nanosized
SAPO-34
catalyst [7] and a low-silica AlPO- 34 [13].
However,on
TS-C,
it decreased from 41% to 25% under the same conditions (Fig. 7a and b).
The selectivity to butene was stable at 22% on
TS-H,
which was 5% higher than the highest value on
TS-C.
TS-H
gave a lower selectivity to ethene,but this was not due to a slower rate of production of ethene.
It was due to the production of more propene and butene,which was because of the faster diffusion of propene (and presumably butene) out from
TS-H,
which gave it higher propene and butene selectivities as described in the above paragraph.
This would be due to its hierarchical structure which gave it a behavior similar to that of a particle composed of small crystallites with short diffusion distances,which was verified by the propene diffusivity data discussed earlier.
In addition,
TS-H
gave a lower selectivity to propane,which is also desirable,and which was possibly due to its milder acidity.
That is,its fewer acid sites was the reason why the selectivity to propane over
TS-H
was only
0.5%,
which was one order of magnitude lower than that on
TS-
C,
which has more acid sites,where this selectivity was 5%.
These data are shown in Fig. 7c and d.
The value of 5% for
TS-C
is similar to the values reported in Yang et al.
[7] and Hereijgers et al.
[4] for a more acidic
SAPO-34.
The explanation that the lower value for
TS-H
was due to the fewer acid sites on
TS-H
assumed that propane was produced by olefin oligomerization and then beta scission of the oligomer,and that oligomerization is promoted by a high density of acid sites.
The selectivity to coke on
TS-C
was almost 10% at the beginning of the reaction,which became much reduced after 10 min proba- bly due to the lowered activity,and then it increased a little again at the end.
On the other hand,on the better
TS-H
catalyst,there was only 4% coke selectivity at the beginning of the reaction,which then decreased slowly with
TOS
to 1%.
The methane selectivity con- firmed the quite different deactivation rates of the two catalysts as on
TS-C,
it increased remarkably after 20 min;but on
TS-H,
it was always quite low.
This association of methane selectivity with deactivation rate assumes that methane was produced by a path- way that was parallel to that of the hydrocarbon pool
(HC)
pathway,and that the methane pathway was insignificant when it was dom- inated by the
HC
pathway when the zeolite was very active but it becomes significant when the
HC
pathway was deactivated.

Discussion In general,the size of the window of the cages in the three dimensional pore system of
SAPO-34
is the bottleneck for the dif- fusion of molecules in the zeolite [25,26].
In a simplified picture of
SAPO-34
shape selectivity,its window size only allows ethene,propene and n-butene to escape from the cages,while it prevents other larger molecules from leaving the cages,which explains well its attraction as a catalyst for making light olefins.
Further cata- lyst development and reactor engineering requires more details to this picture,which have been considered from the aspects of changes in the density of acid sites and diffusion rates.
Thus,cata- lyst development has focused on two strategies:(1) use
SAPO-34
with milder acidity [5],and (2) use a zeolite particle morphol- ogy that promotes faster diffusion [712].
Our results above are in good agreement with these strategies.
The slower coke deposit rate on
TS-H
would be due to its lower acidity [5],since coke has to be formed by oligomerization,which needs a high density of acid sites and the very low propane selectivity of
TS-H
verified that its oligomerization reaction rate was slow.
The second factor of the diffusion rates makes use of the con- sideration that when the diffusion distance of alkenes inside the particle is long,this can result in the further conversion of these molecules into coke.
The apparent diffusivity in
TS-H
was much larger than in
TS-C,
which indicated that the hierarchical struc- ture effectively decreased the diffusion distance,and the alkene products thus remained in the catalyst for a shorter time.
Thus,the plentiful macropores in
TS-H
had the important contribution that they shortened the diffusion path lengths of the alkene inter- mediate products.
Consistent with this explanation is the result that the effect on propene is larger than on ethene which would be because propene is larger and would be more liable to suffer diffu- sion limitation than ethene,that is,this explanation is consistent with the higher selectivity to propene on
TS-H.
Thus,both the hier- archical structure and moderate acidity contributed to significantly improve TS-Hs catalytic performance in
MTO.

Conclusion
A
hierarchical
SAPO-34/18
zeolite with an intergrowth
CHA/AEI
crystal structure and a particle morphology comprising small zeolitic phase crystallites separated by well-ordered macropores was synthesized by using a decreased Si content in the gel mix- ture.
The production of the hierarchical morphological structure did not need an extra template or demetallation procedure.
In addition,it fortuitously had milder acidity due to the lower Si/Al ratio.
The hierarchical structure resulted in a shorter diffusion dis- tance for the gaseous products because the macropores separated the solid phase into small zeolitic phase crystallites.
The shorter diffusion distance and lower acidity resulted in higher selectivi- ties to propene (44%) and butenes (22%),and lower selectivities to propane (0.5%) and coke (14%),which preserved a longer lifetime for the catalyst and a higher yield of alkenes in the
MTO
process.
