[1] "The method did not need to use extra template or demetallation procedures to produce the hierarchical structure."
[2] "The advantage of having macropores in the particle is that they separate the solid zeolitic phase into patches so that the particle is virtually comprised of many much smaller crystallites, which results in much short diffusion distances inside these small inter- nal zeolitic crystallites as compared to the diffusion distance in a solid particle of the same size without macropores."
[3] "The catalyst development of the SAPO-34 catalyst have focused on getting better stability and meeting the industrial needs for a higher selectivity to olefins, especially propene."
[4] "Concerning the acidity, Mees et al. [5] reported that the coking of a SAPO-34 catalyst decreased linearly with acidity, and that with the decreased coking, the ethene/ethane and propene/propane ratios increased."
[5] "The selectivity to propene of TS-H increased slightly from 42% to 44% with TOS, which is a slightly higher selectivity than that reported for a nanosized SAPO-34 catalyst [7] and a low-silica AlPO-34 [13]."

1. The hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite was synthesized by simply changing the gel composition without needing an additional template or demetallation process.
2. Macropores in the particle structure break the solid zeolitic phase into smaller crystallites, resulting in shorter diffusion distances within these crystallites compared to a solid particle of the same size without macropores.
3. Catalyst development for SAPO-34 has aimed at enhancing stability and achieving higher olefin selectivity, particularly for propene.
4. Decreasing the acidity of the SAPO-34 catalyst leads to a linear decrease in coke formation, and consequently increases the ethene/ethane and propene/propane ratios.
5. The selectivity to propene on TS-H slightly increased from 42% to 44% with time on stream (TOS), offering a higher selectivity compared to a nanosized SAPO-34 catalyst and a low-silica AlPO-34.

1. 级联SAPO-34/18沸石通过仅改变凝胶组成而无需额外模板或脱金属化步骤进行合成。
2. 颗粒结构中的大孔将固体沸石相分成多个小晶粒，导致这些晶粒内部的扩散距离远短于相同大小但无大孔的固体颗粒。
3. SAPO-34催化剂的开发旨在提高稳定性并实现更高的烯烃选择性，尤其是丙烯。
4. 减少SAPO-34催化剂的酸度会导致焦炭形成线性减少，并且相应地增加了乙烯/乙烷和丙烯/丙烷的比例。
5. 在TS-H上，随着时间的推移（TOS）丙烯的选择性从42%略微增加到44%，与纳米级SAPO-34催化剂和低硅铝磷酸盐相比，提供了一个较高的选择性。
