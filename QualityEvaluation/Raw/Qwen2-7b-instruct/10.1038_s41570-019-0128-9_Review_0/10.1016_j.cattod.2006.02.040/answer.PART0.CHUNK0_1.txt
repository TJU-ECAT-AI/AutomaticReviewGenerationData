[1] "Chromium supported Cr/MSU-1 prepared by impregnation showed higher activity than Cr-MSU-1 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with carbon dioxide."
[2] "Cr(VI) acted as active species in the catalysts for initial high activity and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction resulted in deactivation of catalyst."
[3] "Both catalysts could be regenerated partially by treated with oxygen."

Various support materials, including MSU-1, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, impact the overall performance. The key challenges involve optimizing the balance between activity, selectivity, and stability, while minimizing side reactions. Trade-offs often exist between improving one aspect and potentially compromising another. For instance, increasing CO2 partial pressure may boost activity but could lead to reduced selectivity or increased deactivation rates. Optimizing the support material can enhance selectivity and stability, but this may come at the cost of slightly reduced activity. Regeneration methods, such as treating the catalyst with oxygen, offer a way to restore some of the lost activity post-reaction. However, the extent of regeneration varies depending on the catalyst type and the reaction conditions used.

各种支持材料，如MSU-1、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中影响铬氧化催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径。反应条件，特别是二氧化碳分压，影响整体性能。关键挑战在于优化活动性、选择性、稳定性的平衡，同时尽量减少副反应。在提升一个方面的同时，可能需要牺牲另一个方面。例如，增加二氧化碳分压可能会提高活性，但可能会导致选择性降低或降解速率增加。优化支持材料可以增强选择性和稳定性，但这可能会以稍微降低活性为代价。再生方法，如将催化剂与氧气处理，提供了一种恢复部分失去活性的方法。然而，不同催化剂类型和反应条件下的再生程度各不相同。
