[1] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes into corresponding alkenes is becoming important because of the growing requirement for alkenes."
[2] "They both showed high activities, providing 58.0 and 68.1% ethane conversion and 53.4 and 55.6% ethylene yield at 700 8C, respectively."
[3] "Cr/VMSU-1 gave the highest activity at this condition."
[4] "The reduction of Cr(VI) was also observed during reaction."
[5] "It was proposed that these high-valent Cr species were responsible for the high activities of catalysts."

1. The utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes into corresponding alkenes is gaining importance due to the increasing demand for alkenes.
2. The Cr-based mesoporous materials demonstrated high activities, achieving 58.0% ethane conversion and 53.4% ethylene yield at 700°C.
3. Among the samples tested, Cr/VMSU-1 showed the highest catalytic activity.
4. The reduction of Cr(VI) species was observed during the reaction, potentially contributing to the deactivation of the catalysts.
5. It was hypothesized that high-valence Cr species played a crucial role in the high activities of the catalysts.

1. 将二氧化碳（CO2）用作氧化剂进行较低烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），以形成相应的烯烃，由于对烯烃的需求日益增加而变得重要。
2. Cr基介孔材料表现出高活性，实现了700°C时58.0%的乙烷转化率和53.4%的乙烯产率。
3. 在测试的样品中，Cr/VMSU-1显示出最高的催化活性。
4. 反应期间观察到了Cr(VI)物种的还原，这可能与催化剂的失活有关。
5. 假设高价态Cr物种在催化剂的高活性中起着关键作用。
