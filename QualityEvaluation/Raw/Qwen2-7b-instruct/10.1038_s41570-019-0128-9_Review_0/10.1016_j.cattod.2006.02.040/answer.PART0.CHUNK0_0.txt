[1] "The promoting effect of CO2 in the ODH of ethane was first reported by Wang et al. [7]."
[2] "They both showed high activities, providing 58.0 and 68.1% ethane conversion and 53.4 and 55.6% ethylene yield at 700 8C, respectively."
[3] "Both Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 exhibited higher activities at the beginning of reaction. As the reactions proceeded, conversions of ethane and CO2 gave a visible drop, suggesting catalysts were deactivated to some degree."
[4] "This is confirmed from FT-IR and UVvis data showing the presence of Cr(VI) in CrO4 in two fresh catalysts."
[5] "Combined with the foregoing supposition,these more active Cr(VI) species are related to surface polychromate which are more readily reducible than monochromate."

1. The CO2 promotes the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, as reported by Wang et al. This effect was first noted in the field.
2. The Cr-based catalysts demonstrated high activities, achieving 58.0% ethane conversion and 53.4% ethylene yield at 700°C.
3. During the reaction, the catalysts' activities decreased, indicating a degree of deactivation.
4. The presence of Cr(VI) species, as confirmed by FT-IR and UVvis data, is associated with the initial high activity of the catalysts.
5. The Cr(VI) species, which are more readily reducible than monochromate, are linked to the surface polychromate responsible for the catalysts' high activity.

1. CO2在乙烷的氧化脱氢反应中具有促进作用，这一现象最早由Wang等人报道。
2. Cr基催化剂表现出高活性，在700°C时提供58.0%的乙烷转化率和53.4%的乙烯产率。
3. 随着反应进行，催化剂的活性逐渐下降，表明催化剂存在一定程度的失活。
4. 通过FT-IR和UVvis数据证实，两种新鲜催化剂中存在Cr(VI)物种，这与催化剂的初始高活性相关联。
5. 表面聚铬酸中的可还原性更强的Cr(VI)物种与催化剂的高活性有关，这些物种比单铬酸更容易被还原。
