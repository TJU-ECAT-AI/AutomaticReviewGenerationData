[1] "Two kinds of Cr-based mesoporous materials, Cr incorporated and supported silicate MSU-1, were synthesized at room temperature and characterized with XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, FT-IR, DR UVvis and H2-TPR techniques."
[2] "Both Cr-based catalysts exhibited similar mesoporous channels and textural properties."
[3] "They both showed high activities, providing 58.0 and 68.1% ethane conversion and 53.4 and 55.6% ethylene yield at 700 °C, respectively."
[4] "Cr species formed in high oxidation state were reduced during the reaction."
[5] "Cr(VI) acted as active species in the catalysts for initial high activity and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction resulted in deactivation of catalyst."
[6] "Both catalysts could be regenerated partially by treated with oxygen."

The document discusses the synthesis and characterization of chromium-based mesoporous materials for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The Cr-based catalysts exhibit similar mesoporous structures and show high activities, converting ethane to ethylene efficiently. The active species are chromium in high oxidation state, which gets reduced during the reaction leading to deactivation. However, the catalysts can be partially regenerated by oxygen treatment.

文档讨论了用于乙烷与二氧化碳氧化脱氢的铬基介孔材料的合成和表征。这些Cr催化剂具有相似的微孔结构，并表现出高活性，有效地将乙烷转化为乙烯。活性物种是高氧化态的铬，反应过程中会被还原导致催化剂失效。然而，通过氧气处理可以部分再生催化剂。
