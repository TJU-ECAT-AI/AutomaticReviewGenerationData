[1] "Currently, isobutene is mainly used as a chemical building block to produce polyisobutene,methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), butyl rubber, and methyl acrylates."
[2] "Although the process of direct isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene was applied commercially [2],there are still some problems, such as it being limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, high energy consumption, and serious deactivation of the catalyst."
[3] "The utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for the selective dehydrogenation of small alkanes to their respective alkenes has gained much interest in recent years and is believed to be an attractive alternative to the traditional dehydrogenation [815]."
[4] "Attempts have been made for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene in the presence of CO2. It is less extensively studied in comparison to the CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[5] "The objective of the present study is to prepare mesoporous silica supported vanadia catalysts with superior catalytic performance. A vanadia catalyst supported on a mesoporous silica such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 exhibited good performance for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 [2023]."
[6] "The textural properties of SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts are listed in Table 1. As the V content increases, the surface area and pore volume of the V/SBA-15 samples decrease gradually."
[7] "The results, shown in Figure 8, point to a marked composition effect on the catalytic performance of the V/SBA catalysts. Isobutane conversion initially increases with the increment of V content from 1% to 7%. A further increase in the V content results in a decline in conversion."
[8] "The higher catalytic activity observed for 7% V/SBA than for that of 7% V/MCM can be attributed to the enhanced reducibility and more dispersed vanadium species on the former catalyst."
[9] "The higher isobutene selectivity achieved on 7% V/SBA than for that on 7% V/MCM is due to the lower amount of acid sites on the former catalyst."
[10] "The regeneration treatment of the 7% V/SBA catalyst after 250 min of reaction at 570 C in the presence of CO2 was attempted."

The document discusses the preparation and application of vanadia catalysts supported on mesoporous silica, specifically focusing on their use in the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene in the presence of carbon dioxide. The catalysts' activity, selectivity, and stability are influenced by factors including vanadium content, support material, and reaction conditions. The study highlights the importance of vanadium dispersion and reducibility for catalytic performance, as well as the impact of acid site density on product selectivity. The document also mentions the regeneration of the catalyst, suggesting that coke formation limits catalyst life and that some level of regeneration can restore activity. 

In terms of how various support materials and reaction conditions affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the document does not provide detailed comparisons or specific outcomes for chromium oxide catalysts. It focuses primarily on vanadia catalysts and their performance in isobutane dehydrogenation. The key challenges in optimizing overall performance likely involve balancing factors such as catalyst stability, activity, and selectivity, while managing the trade-offs between these attributes. The trade-offs might include selecting a support material that maximizes surface area and dispersion of active sites without compromising stability or selectivity towards desired products.

The document suggests that carbon dioxide can act as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation reactions, offering a potentially attractive alternative to traditional methods. The use of carbon dioxide reduces the risk of deep oxidation and avoids the generation of heat, which can lead to product degradation. However, the efficiency and selectivity of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation processes are still being explored, and optimization efforts aim to enhance catalyst performance while maintaining high conversion and selectivity.

本文讨论了在碳二酸存在下，二氧化钒催化剂在乙基苯中表现出优异催化性能。催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性受到多种因素的影响，包括钒含量、支持材料和反应条件。研究强调了分散性和还原性对于催化活性的重要性，以及酸位密度对产物选择性的影响。文档还提到了催化剂的再生，表明焦炭形成限制了催化剂寿命，并且一定程度的再生可以恢复活性。

关于不同支持材料和反应条件如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理，文档并未提供详细的比较或特定结果。它主要关注于二氧化钒催化剂及其在异丁烷脱氢过程中的性能。优化整体性能的关键挑战可能涉及平衡催化稳定性、活性和选择性等属性，同时管理这些属性之间的权衡。可能的权衡包括选择最大化活性位点表面面积和支持材料而不损害稳定性或对所需产品的选择性。

文档表明，二氧化碳可以作为温和的氧化剂用于脱氢反应，为传统的脱氢方法提供了一种潜在有吸引力的替代方案。使用二氧化碳减少了深度氧化的风险，避免了热量生成，从而避免了产品降解。然而，二氧化碳辅助脱氢过程的效率和选择性仍然在探索中，优化努力旨在提高催化剂性能的同时保持高转化率和选择性。

文档指出，催化剂的再生尝试在570°C下，在二氧化碳存在的条件下进行250分钟后。这表明焦炭沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因，并且一定程度的再生可以部分恢复活性。

<cite>Dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over SBA-15-supported vanadium oxide catalysts</cite> 
<p>
The SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts (V/SBA) were prepared by the wet impregnation method. Textural and XRD results suggest that the ordered hexagonal mesostructure of the SBA-15 support is preserved after vanadium loading at least up to 7% V, and, therefore, high surface areas were obtained for the final catalysts. The V/SBA catalysts exhibit high activity for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with CO2, and the catalytic activity is correlated with the amount of dispersed vanadium species on the SBA-15 support. The 7% V/SBA catalyst shows the highest activity. An isobutane conversion of 40.8% with an isobutene selectivity of 84.8% was achieved using this catalyst at 570 C and after reaction for 10 min. The higher catalytic activity observed for 7% V/SBA than for that of 7% V/MCM can be attributed to the enhanced reducibility and more dispersed vanadium species on the former catalyst. The higher isobutene selectivity achieved on 7% V/SBA than for that on 7% V/MCM is due to the lower amount of acid sites on the former catalyst.
