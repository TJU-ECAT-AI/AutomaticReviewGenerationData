[1] "The SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts (V/SBA) were prepared by the wet impregnation method."
[2] "The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."
[3] "It was found that these catalysts were effective for the dehydrogenation reaction, and the catalytic activity is correlated with the amount of dispersed vanadium species on the SBA-15 support."
[4] "The 7% V/SBA catalyst shows the highest activity, which gives 40.8% isobutane conversion and 84.8% isobutene selectivity."
[5] "The SBA-15-supported vanadia exhibits higher isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity than the MCM-41-supported one."
[6] "The redox behavior of vanadium oxide plays a key role in the dehydrogenation reaction using CO2 as a mild oxidant over the vanadia-based catalysts."
[7] "The higher catalytic activity of 7% V/SBA than 7% V/MCM is due to the fact that the former catalyst exhibits enhanced reducibility, as evidenced by the lower reduction temperature of peak I."
[8] "The higher isobutene selectivity achieved on 7% V/SBA than for that on 7% V/MCM is due to the lower amount of acid sites on the former catalyst."

1. The vanadia catalysts were prepared using a wet impregnation method and characterized through N2 adsorption, XRD, SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and TPR.

2. The catalytic activity of the catalysts is linked to the amount of dispersed vanadium species on the SBA-15 support.

3. The 7% V/SBA catalyst displayed the highest activity, achieving 40.8% isobutane conversion and 84.8% isobutene selectivity.

4. The SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts showed better performance than the MCM-41-supported ones.

5. The redox behavior of vanadium oxide is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction using CO2 as a mild oxidant.

6. The enhanced reducibility of the 7% V/SBA catalyst, evidenced by the lower reduction temperature of peak I, contributed to its higher catalytic activity.

7. The lower amount of acid sites on the 7% V/SBA catalyst resulted in higher isobutene selectivity compared to the 7% V/MCM catalyst.

1. 这些催化剂是通过湿浸渍法制备的，并通过氮气吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）、扫描电子显微镜（SEM）、拉曼光谱和温度程序化还原（TPR）进行了表征。

2. 催化剂的活性与SBA-15支持上的分散钒物种的数量有关。

3. 7% V/SBA催化剂显示出了最高的活性，实现了40.8%的异丁烷转化率和84.8%的异丁烯选择性。

4. SBA-15支持的氧化钒催化剂的表现优于MCM-41支持的催化剂。

5. 钒氧化物的可逆氧化还原行为对于使用CO2作为温和氧化剂进行脱氢反应至关重要。

6. 由于前者的还原性增强，即峰值I的较低还原温度，7% V/SBA催化剂的高催化活性得到了提升。

7. 7% V/SBA催化剂上酸中心数量较少，导致了更高的异丁烯选择性，与7% V/MCM催化剂相比。
