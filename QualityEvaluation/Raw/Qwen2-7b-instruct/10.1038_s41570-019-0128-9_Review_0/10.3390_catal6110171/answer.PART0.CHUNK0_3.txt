[1] "Although the process of direct isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene was applied commercially [2], there are still some problems, such as it being limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, high energy consumption, and serious deactivation of the catalyst."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane using O2 has attracted much attention [37] because it is not limited by thermodynamic equilibrium and the energy consumption is relatively low."
[3] "The catalysts reported for this reaction mainly consist of iron oxide [16], vanadium magnesium oxide [17], V2O5 [18], LaBaSm oxide [19], and NiO [15]."
[4] "There is still a challenge in enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity."
[5] "The objective of the present study is to prepare mesoporous silica supported vanadia catalysts with superior catalytic performance."
[6] "A vanadia catalyst supported on a mesoporous silica such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 exhibited good performance for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 [2023]."
[7] "The 7% V/SBA catalyst shows the highest activity, which gives 40.8% isobutane conversion and 84.8% isobutene selectivity."
[8] "The 7% V/SBA catalyst is the most active, which can be ascribed to the fact that this catalyst exhibits the highest reducibility and possesses the most dispersed vanadium species (Figure 6 and Table 1)."
[9] "Moreover, the former catalyst has more dispersed vanadium species than the latter one."
[10] "The 7% V/SBA catalyst is the most active, which can be ascribed to the fact that this catalyst exhibits the highest reducibility and possesses the most dispersed vanadium species (Figure 6 and Table 1)."
