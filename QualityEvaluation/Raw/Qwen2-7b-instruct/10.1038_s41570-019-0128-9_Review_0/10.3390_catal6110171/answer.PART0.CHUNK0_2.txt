[1] "The objective of the present study is to prepare mesoporous silica supported vanadia catalysts with superior catalytic performance."
[2] "A series of vanadia catalysts supported on SBA-15 (V/SBA) with a vanadia (V) content ranging from 1% to 11% were prepared by an incipient wetness method."
[3] "The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."
[4] "The 7% V/SBA catalyst shows the highest activity, which gives 40.8% isobutane conversion and 84.8% isobutene selectivity."
[5] "The SBA-15-supported vanadia exhibits higher isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity than the MCM-41-supported one."
[6] "The 7% V/SBA catalyst is the most active, which can be ascribed to the fact that this catalyst exhibits the highest reducibility and possesses the most dispersed vanadium species."
[7] "Compared to isobutane conversion, the isobutene yield of V/SBA catalysts follows the same variation trend with V content, as shown in Table 2."
[8] "The regeneration treatment of the 7% V/SBA catalyst after 250 min of reaction at 570 C in the presence of CO2 was attempted."

1. The aim of the current research is to create mesoporous silica-supported vanadia catalysts that demonstrate exceptional catalytic efficiency.
2. Vanadia catalysts with a varying vanadium content (from 1% to 11%) were synthesized on SBA-15 using the incipient wetness technique.
3. The catalysts' characteristics were evaluated through N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR).
4. The 7% V/SBA catalyst demonstrated the greatest activity, achieving a 40.8% conversion of isobutane and an 84.8% selectivity towards isobutene.
5. The SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts outperform MCM-41-supported ones in terms of isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity.
6. The 7% V/SBA catalyst is the most reactive, primarily due to its high reducibility and extensive dispersion of vanadium species.
7. The isobutene yield of vanadia catalysts, relative to isobutane conversion, correlates similarly with vanadium content, as illustrated in Table 2.
8. A regeneration procedure was attempted for the 7% V/SBA catalyst after 250 minutes of reaction at 570 C in the presence of CO2.

1. 当前研究的目标是制备具有优异催化性能的介孔二氧化硅支持的氧化钒催化剂。
2. 利用浸渍法在SBA-15上合成含范德华（V）含量从1%到11%的一系列氧化钒催化剂。
3. 通过氮气吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）、扫描电子显微镜（SEM）、拉曼光谱和温度程序化还原（TPR）对催化剂进行了表征。
4. 含量为7%的V/SBA催化剂表现出最高的活性，实现了40.8%的异丁烷转化率和84.8%的异丁烯选择性。
5. SBA-15支持的氧化钒催化剂在异丁烷转化率和异丁烯选择性方面优于MCM-41支持的催化剂。
6. 7% V/SBA催化剂是最活跃的，主要归因于其高可还原性和广泛的分散钒物种。
7. 相对于异丁烷转化率，异丁烯产率与钒含量的关联趋势在表2中得以体现。
8. 在570°C且存在CO2的情况下，尝试了7% V/SBA催化剂在反应250分钟后进行的再生处理。
