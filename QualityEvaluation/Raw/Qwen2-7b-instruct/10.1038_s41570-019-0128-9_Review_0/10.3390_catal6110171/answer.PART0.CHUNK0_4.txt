<cite>Dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over SBA-15-supported vanadium oxide catalysts</cite> 
<p>
The SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts (V/SBA) were prepared by the wet impregnation method. Textural and XRD results suggest that the ordered hexagonal mesostructure of the SBA-15 support is preserved after vanadium loading at least up to 7% V, and, therefore, high surface areas were obtained for the final catalysts. The V/SBA catalysts exhibit high activity for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with CO2, and the catalytic activity is correlated with the amount of dispersed vanadium species on the SBA-15 support. The 7% V/SBA catalyst shows the highest activity. An isobutane conversion of 40.8% with an isobutene selectivity of 84.8% was achieved using this catalyst at 570 C and after reaction for 10 min. The higher catalytic activity observed for 7% V/SBA than for that of 7% V/MCM can be attributed to the enhanced reducibility and more dispersed vanadium species on the former catalyst. The higher isobutene selectivity achieved on 7% V/SBA than for that on 7% V/MCM is due to the lower amount of acid sites on the former catalyst.

SBA-15支持的钒氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳存在的条件下，表现出对异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯的高活性。催化活性与SBA-15支撑上的分散钒物种的数量相关。7% V/SBA催化剂显示出了最高的活性，在570°C下反应10分钟后，实现了40.8%的异丁烷转化率和84.8%的异丁烯选择性。增强的可还原性和更多的分散的钒物种使得7% V/SBA的催化活性高于7% V/MCM。7% V/SBA上较少的酸中心导致了更高的异丁烯选择性。
