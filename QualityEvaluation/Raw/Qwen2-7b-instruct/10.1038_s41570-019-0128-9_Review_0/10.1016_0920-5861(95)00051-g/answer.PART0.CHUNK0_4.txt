[1] "Commercial processes for the synthesis of light olefins through paraffins dehydrogenation are available, even though their main application is for isobutene synthesis."
[2] "In other cases, entirely new catalytic systems have been developed."
[3] "Generally, we can classify the catalysts into:a) Catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, which are also active for meth"
[4] "The per- formances of catalysts reported in literature is summarized in Figs. 1 and 2, which report the highest achieved yields in a selectivity vs. conversion plot, and the levels of maximum productivity obtained at the average operative temperature for each system."

The document discusses various catalysts used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. It mentions that commercial processes exist for the synthesis of light olefins through paraffin dehydrogenation, primarily for isobutene synthesis. New catalytic systems have been developed specifically for ethane oxydehydrogenation. The catalysts can generally be classified into two categories: those based on Group IA and IIA metals' ions and oxides, and transition metal oxides. The document provides figures summarizing the highest achieved yields in terms of selectivity versus conversion and the maximum productivity at average operating temperatures for each system.
