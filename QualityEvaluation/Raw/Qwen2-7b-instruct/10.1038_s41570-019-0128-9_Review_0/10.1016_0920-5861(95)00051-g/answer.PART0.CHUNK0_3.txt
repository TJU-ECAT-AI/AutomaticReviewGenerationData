[1] "In the case of ethane, a couple of catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals have been developed. These activate ethane at temperatures usually higher than 600°C to form ethyl radicals."
[2] "The most successful catalyst is the Li/Mg/O one. The mechanism does not involve a classical redox-type cycle; thus, no furnishing of bulk oxygen occurs, and the catalyst only is involved in C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation."
[3] "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides."
[4] "Other systems that are active at temperatures higher than 600°C are Li2O/TiO2, LiCl/NiO, LiCl/MnO2 and LiCl/Sm203."
[5] "Doping Sm203 with alkali metals gives the best performances. These systems are believed to operate with a mechanism similar to that of Li/Mg/O catalysts."
[6] "In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon, through a classical redox cycle."
[7] "Mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb were shown to be active in ethane oxidation at temperatures as low as 250°C, with selectivity to ethylene higher than 80%."
[8] "Alumina-Cr2O3 catalysts have been reported to be active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[9] "The role of the generation of Li+-O- centers capable of abstracting a H. and forming the ethyl radical."
[10] "At lower temperatures the formation of a surface ethoxy species is preferred, precursor of COx formation."

1. Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The CO2 partial pressure also plays a significant role. For instance, alumina-Cr2O3 catalysts have been reported to be active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The Li/Mg/O catalyst system is particularly successful, involving C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation without requiring a redox-type cycle. The presence of chlorine-containing compounds or halide doping can enhance the catalyst's performance, leading to high selectivities and yields to ethylene. Other catalysts based on transition metal oxides show promise, especially those doped with alkali metals, which operate similarly to the Li/Mg/O catalyst system. Vanadium oxide-based systems can activate ethane at lower temperatures, demonstrating a significant reduction mechanism. Mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb exhibit high selectivity to ethylene at temperatures as low as 250°C. However, the reported experimental conditions often result in low ethylene productivity, posing a challenge to practical application.

1. 各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中对铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径产生影响。二氧化碳分压也起着重要作用。例如，已报告了用作乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢催化剂的Al2O3-Cr2O3催化剂。Li/Mg/O催化剂系统尤其成功，涉及C-H异裂断裂与自由基形成，无需进行红ox型循环。氯化物化合物的存在或卤素掺杂可以增强催化剂的性能，导致高选择性和乙烯产率。基于过渡金属氧化物的其他催化剂显示出希望，特别是掺杂有碱金属的系统，其操作类似于Li/Mg/O催化剂系统。钒氧化物基系统可以在250°C以下的温度激活乙烷，显示显著的还原机制。Mo/V/Nb的混合氧化物在250°C的温度下表现出高的乙二醇选择性。然而，报告的实验条件往往导致低乙烯产量，对实际应用构成挑战。
