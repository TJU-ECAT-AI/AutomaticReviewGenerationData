[1] "The performance of the various catalysts described in the literature has been compared."
[2] "Generally, we can classify the catalysts into:a) Catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, which are also active for meth- ethylene selectivity, %"
[3] "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides [9,10]; the promoter effect is maintained by continuous feeding of the chlorine, which modifies the catalyst surface [ 11 ]; chlorine radicals are thought to favour the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene."
[4] "In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon,through a classical redox cycle [ 18-23]. These systems can activate ethane at temperatures as low as 400C, and the entire reaction is heterogeneous,hence controlled by the catalyst; the contribution of homogeneous reactions only occurs at the highest temperatures."

The document discusses how various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It states that high selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved when chlorine-containing compounds are fed to the reactor or when the catalyst is doped with halides. The promoter effect is maintained by continuous feeding of chlorine, modifying the catalyst surface. The document also mentions that in vanadium oxide-based systems, the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon through a classical redox cycle, activating ethane at temperatures as low as 400C. The entire reaction is heterogeneous, controlled by the catalyst, with the contribution of homogeneous reactions only occurring at the highest temperatures.

文献讨论了不同支持材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）以及反应条件（包括CO2分压）如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径。它指出，在向反应器添加氯化物或对催化剂进行卤素掺杂时，可以实现高乙稀选择性和产率。通过连续提供氯来维持促进剂效应，修改催化剂表面。文献还提到，在钒氧化物基系统中，催化剂通过经典的氧化还原循环与碳氢化合物相互作用而被还原，可以在400°C以下激活乙烷。整个反应是异相的，受催化剂控制；仅在最高温度下，才会出现均相反应的贡献。
