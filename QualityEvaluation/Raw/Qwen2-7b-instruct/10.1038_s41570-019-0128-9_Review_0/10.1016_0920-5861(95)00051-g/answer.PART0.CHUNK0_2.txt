[1] "Catalysts for coupling operate at 700- 800C, and the hot outlet stream could be fed to a downstream catalytic or thermal oxydehydrogenation reactor."
[2] "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides [9,10]."
[3] "The selectivity to ethylene is increased with temperature; this is due to the fact that the formed ethyl radical at high temperature (600-700C;above 700C homogeneous overoxidation of ethylene decreases the selectivity)."
[4] "At lower temperatures the formation of a surface ethoxy species is preferred, precursor of COx formation."
[5] "H2 can be formed either via thermal or catalyzed dehydorgenation; also, a contribution was proposed due to water gas shift equilibrium (over rare earth oxides) or of intermediate ethoxy species decomposition to CO, C and H2."
[6] "Recently [ 13 ], it was found that catalysts like Ca/Ni/K/O and Li/Mg/ O are active in the water gas shift at the temperatures at which ethane oxydehydrogenation occurs."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane is discussed in the literature, focusing on the performance of various catalysts and their ability to produce light olefins. Catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, such as Li/Mg/O, are active in ethane oxydehydrogenation, forming ethyl radicals which then react to form ethylene. High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, especially when chlorine-containing compounds are fed to the reactor or when the catalyst is doped with halides. The selectivity to ethylene increases with temperature, as the ethyl radical at high temperatures desorbs and forms ethylene in the gas phase via reaction with molecular oxygen. At lower temperatures, a surface ethoxy species is preferred, which is a precursor of COx formation. H2 can be formed via thermal or catalyzed dehydrogenation, or through the water gas shift equilibrium over rare earth oxides or the decomposition of intermediate ethoxy species to CO, C, and H2. Catalysts like Ca/Ni/K/O and Li/Mg/O are also found to be active in the water gas shift at the temperatures at which ethane oxydehydrogenation occurs.

文献中讨论了乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢，重点关注各种催化剂的性能及其生产轻烯烃的能力。基于IA族和IIA族金属离子和氧化物的催化剂，如Li/Mg/O，在乙烷氧化脱氢中表现出活性，形成乙基自由基，进而反应生成乙烯。在该催化系统中，尤其是当向反应器添加氯化物化合物或催化剂掺杂卤素时，可以实现高选择性和乙烯产率。随着温度的升高，选择性增加，因为高温下的乙基自由基脱附并以分子氧反应生成乙烯。在较低温度下，表面乙氧基物种是首选，它是COx形成的前体。可以通过热或催化脱氢或通过水煤气转移平衡（在稀土氧化物上）或中间乙氧基物种分解到CO、C和H2来形成H2。Ca/Ni/K/O和Li/Mg/O等催化剂也被发现能在乙烷氧化脱氢发生的温度下在水煤气转移中表现活跃。
