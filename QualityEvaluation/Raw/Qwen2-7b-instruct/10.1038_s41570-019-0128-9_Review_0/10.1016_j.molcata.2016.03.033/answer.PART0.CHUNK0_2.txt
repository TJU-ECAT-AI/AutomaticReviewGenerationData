Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, have significant impacts on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The choice of support material and reaction conditions affects the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts. By optimizing specific conditions, activity, selectivity, and stability can be improved, leading to enhanced overall performance. However, trade-offs exist between these factors, necessitating careful consideration during optimization. Key challenges in optimizing the performance of these catalysts involve achieving high activity while preserving selectivity and stability.
