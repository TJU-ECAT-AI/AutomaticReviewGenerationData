The activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and the reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure. The study highlights that the choice of support material and the optimization of reaction conditions are essential for achieving high catalytic performance. However, there are trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability that must be considered when selecting the optimal catalyst.
