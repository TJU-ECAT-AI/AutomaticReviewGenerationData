[1] "Several technologies have been proposed for improving the efficiency of energy conversion and utilization of CO2. Generally, CO2 recovered from flue stacks or atmosphere can be sequestered in oceans or spent gas and oil wells. Alternatively, recovered CO2 can be used to produce chemicals, fuels, and other useful products."
[2] "There are several motivations for producing chemicals from CO2 whenever possible: (1) CO2 is an inexpensive, nontoxic feedstock that can frequently replace toxic chemicals such as phosgene or isocyanates. (2) CO2 is a renewable feedstock compared to oil or coal. (3) The production of chemicals from CO2 can lead to new materials such as polymers. (4) New routes to existing chemical intermediates and products could be more efficient and economical than current methods. (5) The production of chemicals from CO2 could have a small but significant positive impact on the global carbon balance."
[3] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest."
[4] "In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control."
[5] "It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
[6] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant for the partial oxidation of lower alkanes may become an important route for the utilization of natural gas. It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes."
[7] "Conversion and utilization of CO2 (as well as methane, CH4) are important subjects in the field of C1 chemistry."
[8] "Generally, CO2 recovered from flue stacks or atmosphere can be sequestered in oceans or spent gas and oil wells. Alternatively, recovered CO2 can be used to produce chemicals, fuels, and other useful products."
[9] "It has been shown that CO2 has the potential to offer a promising alternative to oxygen for selective oxidation, whereas the catalyst development is the key to the applications."
[10] "The inevitable formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 from the reactant (CH4) and products (C2H4 and C2H6) (reactions 3-5), however, seems to be one of the most serious problems, from a practical point of view."
[11] "CO2, as an oxidant, has several advantages over O2. First, CO will be the only byproduct in this case (see reactions 7 and 8 later in this work). Second, unlike O2, CO2 will not induce gas-phase radical reactions."
[12] "The key point for the realization is to develop an efficient catalyst that is capable not only of activating both CH4 and CO2 but also of producing C2 hydrocarbons selectively."
[13] "Some investigations have been conducted in the past few years, and progress is being achieved in catalyst development."
[14] "The lattice oxygen of the CaO-ZnO could convert CH4 mainly to H2 and CO. The presence of CO2 formed a new oxygen species, which was active and selective for the conversion of CH4 to C2 hydrocarbons. The CaO component in the catalyst enhanced the adsorption of CO2 and thus suppressed the reaction involving the lattice oxygen."
[15] "On the other hand, the SrO-MnO2 and BaO-MnO2 catalysts exhibited kinetic features that were different from the CaO-MnO2 system; C2 selectivity at 850 C changed only slightly with the partial pressure of CO2, and the activation energies were constant over the entire temperature range examined and notably lower."
[16] "The highest CH4 conversion is 6%, at 850 C, which suggests that these catalyst systems are not effective in activating CH4."
[17] "The distribution of C2 hydrocarbons was changed through the use of a Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, and the major C2 product was C2H4."

1. Various support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions such as CO2 partial pressure, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The choice of support material affects the surface area and acidity of the catalyst, which in turn impacts the interaction between the catalyst and the reactants. The CO2 partial pressure controls the reaction rate and the extent of dehydrogenation, affecting the selectivity towards olefin formation. The key challenges and trade-offs involve balancing the need for high activity and selectivity with the stability of the catalyst over multiple reaction cycles. Optimizing the overall performance requires careful selection of the support material, adjustment of the CO2 partial pressure, and development of catalysts with active sites that can efficiently activate CO2 and alkanes while minimizing side reactions.

2. The role of carbon dioxide (CO2) and the reaction mechanism in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions primarily involve the activation of CO2, which can occur through the formation of CO2- or O-(s) species. The activation step is crucial as it leads to the formation of active sites that can facilitate the dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins. The reaction pathway typically involves the cleavage of C-H bonds in the alkane, followed by the transfer of oxygen from CO2 to form olefins. Key challenges include the development of catalysts that can efficiently activate CO2 and alkanes, minimize side reactions, and maintain stability over time. Trade-offs exist between catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability, necessitating the optimization of catalyst composition and reaction conditions to achieve desired outcomes.
