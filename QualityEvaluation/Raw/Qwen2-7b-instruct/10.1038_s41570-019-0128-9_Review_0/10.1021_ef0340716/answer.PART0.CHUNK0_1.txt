[1] "Zhang et al. recently reported using pulse corona plasma as an activation method and applied it for the reaction of CH4 and CO2 over some catalysts. The products were C2 hydrocarbons and the byproducts were CO and molecular hydrogen (H2)."
[2] "The conversion of CH4 increased as the CO2 concentration in the feed increased, while the yield of C2 hydrocarbons decreased."
[3] "The synergism of La2O3/ γ-Al2O3 and plasma gave a CH4 conversion of 24.9% and C2 hydrocarbons yield of 18.1% were obtained at a plasma power input of 30 W."
[4] "The distribution of C2 hydrocarbons was changed through the use of a Pd- La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, and the major C2 product was C2H4."

The study by Zhang et al. demonstrates the use of pulse corona plasma as an activation method for the reaction of CH4 and CO2 over certain catalysts. The plasma technique enabled the production of C2 hydrocarbons as primary products, with CO and molecular hydrogen (H2) as byproducts. The conversion rate of CH4 increased as the CO2 concentration in the feed was augmented, but concurrently, the yield of C2 hydrocarbons decreased. By employing a combination of La2O3/ γ-Al2O3 and plasma, a CH4 conversion rate of 24.9% and a C2 hydrocarbon yield of 18.1% were achieved at a plasma power input of 30 W. The application of a Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst altered the distribution of C2 hydrocarbons, with C2H4 emerging as the predominant product.

张等人最近报道了使用脉冲电晕放电作为激活方法，并将其应用于某些催化剂上的甲烷和二氧化碳反应。放电技术使C2烃作为主要产品产生，副产品为CO和分子氢（H2）。随着进料中二氧化碳浓度的增加，甲烷的转化率提高，但同时C2烃的产率下降。通过结合La2O3/ γ-Al2O3和放电，获得了在30瓦放电功率输入下24.9%的甲烷转化率和18.1%的C2烃产率。通过应用Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3催化剂改变了C2烃的分布，主要产物为C2H4。
