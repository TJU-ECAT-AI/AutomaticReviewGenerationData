The use of pulse corona plasma as an activation method in the reaction of CH4 and CO2 can lead to the formation of C2 hydrocarbons, with CO and H2 as byproducts. Increasing the CO2 concentration in the feed enhances CH4 conversion, but decreases the yield of C2 hydrocarbons. The combination of La2O3/γ-Al2O3 and plasma achieves a CH4 conversion rate of 24.9% and a C2 hydrocarbons yield of 18.1% at a plasma power input of 30 W. The application of a Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst alters the distribution of C2 hydrocarbons, with C2H4 being the major product.

The study by Zhang et al. demonstrates the use of pulse corona plasma as an activation method for the reaction of CH4 and CO2 over certain catalysts. The plasma technique enabled the production of C2 hydrocarbons as primary products, with CO and molecular hydrogen (H2) as byproducts. The conversion rate of CH4 increased as the CO2 concentration in the feed was augmented, but concurrently, the yield of C2 hydrocarbons decreased. By employing a combination of La2O3/ γ-Al2O3 and plasma, a CH4 conversion rate of 24.9% and a C2 hydrocarbon yield of 18.1% were achieved at a plasma power input of 30 W. The application of a Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst altered the distribution of C2 hydrocarbons, with C2H4 emerging as the predominant product.

The role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in catalytic conversion processes, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, is highlighted in this literature. CO2 serves as an oxidant and offers a potential alternative to oxygen for selective oxidation. However, the utilization of CO2 in these reactions depends on the development of suitable catalysts. Various factors, including the choice of support materials and reaction conditions, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature emphasizes the importance of creating catalysts that effectively activate both CO2 and alkanes while producing olefins selectively. Moreover, the literature acknowledges that the activation of methane (CH4) is a critical step in these reactions, and its mechanism is still under investigation. The presence of CO2 is crucial for the activation of CH4, as it facilitates the conversion of CH3- to CH3 radicals, which are essential for the dimerization to form C2H6.

The challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of these catalysts include finding the right balance between high activity, selectivity, and stability. Factors such as the type of support material, the reaction conditions, and the CO2 partial pressure play pivotal roles in achieving these objectives. For instance, the literature mentions that the use of a strong basic oxide like barium oxide (BaO) does not favor the activation of CH4. Similarly, the role of carbon dioxide in the activation of CH4 is highlighted, indicating its importance in the catalytic process. The literature also discusses the synergistic effects of using specific catalysts in combination with corona plasma, which can enhance the conversion of CH4 and yield of C2 hydrocarbons.

In summary, the literature underscores the significance of CO2 as an oxidant in catalytic conversions, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins. The development of efficient catalysts tailored to optimize the interaction between CO2 and alkanes is crucial for realizing the potential of CO2 utilization in selective oxidation. The literature provides insights into the mechanistic aspects of these reactions and identifies key challenges and opportunities in enhancing the performance of catalysts for CO2-based catalytic conversions.

[1] "Several technologies have been proposed for improving the efficiency of energy conversion and utilization of CO2. Generally, CO2 recovered from flue stacks or atmosphere can be sequestered in oceans or spent gas and oil wells. Alternatively, recovered CO2 can be used to produce chemicals, fuels, and other useful products."
[2] "There are several motivations for producing chemicals from CO2 whenever possible: (1) CO2 is an inexpensive, nontoxic feedstock that can frequently replace toxic chemicals such as phosgene or isocyanates. (2) CO2 is a renewable feedstock compared to oil or coal. (3) The production of chemicals from CO2 can lead to new materials such as polymers. (4) New routes to existing chemical intermediates and products could be more efficient and economical than current methods. (5) The production of chemicals from CO2 could have a small but significant positive impact on the global carbon balance."
[3] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest."
[4] "In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control."
[5] "It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
[6] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant for the partial oxidation of lower alkanes may become an important route for the utilization of natural gas. It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes."
[7] "Conversion and utilization of CO2 (as well as methane, CH4) are important subjects in the field of C1 chemistry."
[8] "Generally, CO2 recovered from flue stacks or atmosphere can be sequestered in oceans or spent gas and oil wells. Alternatively, recovered CO2 can be used to produce chemicals, fuels, and other useful products."
[9] "It has been shown that CO2 has the potential to offer a promising alternative to oxygen for selective oxidation, whereas the catalyst development is the key to the applications."
[10] "The inevitable formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 from the reactant (CH4) and products (C2H4 and C2H6) (reactions 3-5), however, seems to be one of the most serious problems, from a practical point of view."
[11] "CO2, as an oxidant, has several advantages over O2. First, CO will be the only byproduct in this case (see reactions 7 and 8 later in this work). Second, unlike O2, CO2 will not induce gas-phase radical reactions."
[12] "The key point for the realization is to develop an efficient catalyst that is capable not only of activating both CH4 and CO2 but also of producing C2 hydrocarbons selectively."
[13] "Some investigations have been conducted in the past few years, and progress is being achieved in catalyst development."
[14] "The lattice oxygen of the CaO-ZnO could convert CH4 mainly to H2 and CO. The presence of CO2 formed a new oxygen species, which was active and selective for the conversion of CH4 to C2 hydrocarbons. The CaO component in the catalyst enhanced the adsorption of CO2 and thus suppressed the reaction involving the lattice oxygen."
[15] "On the other hand, the SrO-MnO2 and BaO-MnO2 catalysts exhibited kinetic features that were different from the CaO-MnO2 system; C2 selectivity at 850 C changed only slightly with the partial pressure of CO2, and the activation energies were constant over the entire temperature range examined and notably lower."
[16] "The highest CH4 conversion is 6%, at 850 C, which suggests that these catalyst systems are not effective in activating CH4."
[17] "The distribution of C2 hydrocarbons was changed through the use of a Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, and the major C2 product was C2H4."
