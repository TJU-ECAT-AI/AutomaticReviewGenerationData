[1] "The utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the main contributors to the greenhouse effect, has been a topic of global interest, from both fundamental and practical viewpoints."
[2] "It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
[3] "It is generally accepted that the active sites for the activation of CH4 can be ascribed to O-(s) or O2-(s) via the reactions"
[4] "In the presence of O2, CH3- can convert to the CH3 radicals required for dimerization to C2H6 via reaction with molecular oxygen (O2)."

The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by various support materials and reaction conditions. The key challenges in optimizing their overall performance involve balancing factors such as the type of support material (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2), CO2 partial pressure, and the ability to efficiently activate methane (CH4). Challenges include achieving high CH4 conversion rates while maintaining high selectivity towards olefin products, managing the stability of the catalyst over multiple reaction cycles, and understanding the detailed reaction mechanisms that govern the conversion of CH4 and CO2 to desired olefin products. Trade-offs often exist between these factors, requiring careful optimization of the catalyst composition and operating conditions to achieve the best performance.
