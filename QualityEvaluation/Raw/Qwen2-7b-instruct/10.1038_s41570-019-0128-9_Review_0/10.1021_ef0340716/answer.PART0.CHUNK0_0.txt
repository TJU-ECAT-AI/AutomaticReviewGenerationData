[1] "Zhang et al. recently reported using pulse corona plasma as an activation method and applied it for the reaction of CH4 and CO2 over some catalysts. The products were C2 hydrocarbons and the byproducts were CO and molecular hydrogen (H2)."
[2] "CH4 conversion and the yield of C2 hydrocarbons were affected by the CO2 concentration in the feed. The conversion of CH4 increased as the CO2 concentration in the feed increased, while the yield of C2 hydrocarbons decreased."
[3] "The synergism of La2O3/ γ-Al2O3 and plasma gave a CH4 conversion of 24.9% and C2 hydrocarbons yield of 18.1% were obtained at a plasma power input of 30 W."
[4] "The distribution of C2 hydrocarbons was changed through the use of a Pd- La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, and the major C2 product was C2H4."

The use of pulse corona plasma as an activation method in the reaction of CH4 and CO2 can lead to the formation of C2 hydrocarbons, with CO and H2 as byproducts. Increasing the CO2 concentration in the feed enhances CH4 conversion, but decreases the yield of C2 hydrocarbons. The combination of La2O3/γ-Al2O3 and plasma achieves a CH4 conversion rate of 24.9% and a C2 hydrocarbons yield of 18.1% at a plasma power input of 30 W. The application of a Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst alters the distribution of C2 hydrocarbons, with C2H4 being the major product.

脉冲等离子体作为激活方法，在CH4和CO2反应中可以产生C2烃类，副产品为CO和H2。增加进料中的CO2浓度能提高CH4的转化率，但降低了C2烃类的产率。La2O3/γ-Al2O3和等离子体的组合在30 W的功率输入下实现了24.9%的CH4转化率和18.1%的C2烃类产率。应用Pd-La2O3/γ-Al2O3催化剂改变了C2烃类的分布，主要产物为C2H4。
