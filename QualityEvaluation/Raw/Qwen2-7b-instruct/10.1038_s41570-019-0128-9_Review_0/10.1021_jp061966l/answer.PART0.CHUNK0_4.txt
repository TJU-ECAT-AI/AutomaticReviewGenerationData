[1] "Recent studies on the subject include Wang et al.5 who studied Cr2O3 supported on various supports for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 and found the following order of activity (Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2)."
[2] "The CO2 serves as a medium for supplying heat for the endothermic dehy- drogenation reaction, as a diluent for enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and as an agent for the removal of coke formed on the catalyst."
[3] "In contrast, little Cr6+ (or Cr5+) was detected in the less-active catalysts."
[4] "In the active catalysts, Cr/H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/ Al2O3 > 190), Cr6+ ) O, or possibly Cr5+ ) O was the catalytic species on the zeolite support."
[5] "The TPR peak probably arises from the reaction of H2 with the CrdO species."
[6] "These results indicate that the average oxidation state of the Cr species at the reaction condition is reduced slightly."
[7] "The Cr6+ ) O species was reduced to Cr3+ by ethane treatment, and CO2 treatment led to reoxidation to Cr6+ ) O."
[8] "Moreover, because the Cr species exist as Cr3+ species on the Al rich H-ZSM-5 zeolite, a suitable zeolite support should have high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (>190)."
[9] "An important role of CO2 is removing carbon by oxidation from the surface of the Cr/H-ZSM-5."

1. Various studies have explored the use of chromium oxide catalysts supported on different materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of these catalysts. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include balancing the interaction between the chromium species and the support material, ensuring efficient carbon removal, and maintaining catalyst stability over time.

2. The CO2 plays multiple roles in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, serving as a heat source, enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes, and facilitating the removal of coke formed on the catalyst surface.

3. The activity of catalysts varies based on the support material used. For instance, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 shows higher activity compared to other materials like Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/Al2O3, and Cr2O3/TiO2.

4. In less-active catalysts, little to no Cr6+ (or Cr5+) is detected, indicating that the active species differs from those in more active catalysts.

5. In active catalysts, the catalytic species is Cr/H-ZSM-5 with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, suggesting that the presence of chromium in higher oxidation states (Cr6+ or possibly Cr5+) is crucial for the dehydrogenation process.

6. The reduction of the Cr species to Cr3+ occurs upon ethane treatment, while CO2 treatment leads to reoxidation back to Cr6+ or possibly Cr5+. This redox cycle is essential for achieving a high dehydrogenation rate.

7. A suitable zeolite support for chromium oxide catalysts should have a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio to facilitate the incorporation of chromium species and enhance catalytic activity.

8. The role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation is primarily to remove carbon by oxidation from the catalyst surface, contributing to enhanced stability and efficiency of the catalyst.

1. 不同的研究已经探索了在不同的材料上如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2等，用于CO2氧化脱氢反应的铬氧化物催化剂。反应条件，包括CO2分压，对这些催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径有重大影响。优化整体性能的关键挑战和权衡包括平衡铬物种与支持材料之间的相互作用，确保有效去除碳，并保持催化剂的稳定性。

2. CO2在氧化脱氢过程中扮演多种角色，作为热源、增强轻烷烃的平衡转化率以及促进催化剂表面碳的氧化去除。

3. 催化剂的活性取决于所使用的支撑材料。例如，SiO2上的Cr2O3显示出比其他材料如ZrO2、Al2O3和TiO2更高的活性。

4. 在活性较低的催化剂中，检测到的Cr6+（或Cr5+）很少，表明活跃物种与活性较高的催化剂中的不同。

5. 在活性催化剂中，催化物种是具有高SiO2/Al2O3比率的Cr/H-ZSM-5，这表明在较高氧化状态（Cr6+或可能为Cr5+）下的铬存在对于脱氢过程至关重要。

6. 烯烃处理会将铬物种还原为Cr3+，而CO2处理导致重新氧化回Cr6+或可能为Cr5+。这个氧化还原循环对于实现高脱氢速率至关重要。

7. 对于铬氧化物催化剂来说，合适的分子筛支持应具有高SiO2/Al2O3比率，以促进铬物种的整合并增强催化活性。

8. CO2在氧化脱氢过程中的主要作用是通过氧化从催化剂表面去除碳，从而提高催化剂的稳定性和效率。
