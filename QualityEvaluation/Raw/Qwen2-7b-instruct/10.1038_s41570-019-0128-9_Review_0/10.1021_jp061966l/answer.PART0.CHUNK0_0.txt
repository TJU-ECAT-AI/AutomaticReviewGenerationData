1. Recent research on chromium catalysts focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation, often utilizing oxygen or air as oxidants. Carbon dioxide is considered a potential unconventional oxidant for dehydrogenation processes, such as converting ethylbenzene to styrene and light alkanes (C2-C4) to alkenes.

2. Using carbon dioxide as a co-feed gas resulted in a conversion rate of 32% that remained stable for 6.5 hours.

3. The colors of the catalysts varied based on the type of zeolite used. Zeolites with higher silica-to-alumina ratios (SiO2/Al2O3 > 190) showed distinct color changes after pretreatment in air, indicating differences in their chemical properties.

4. The peak at 925 cm-1 in the infrared spectra of the most active catalysts is attributed to the stretching vibrations of the CrdO double bond, highlighting the presence of this specific chromium compound in the active catalysts.

5. At 985 and 1000 cm-1, small peaks in the infrared spectra of the catalysts might indicate the presence of mononuclear Cr5+ oxide species, further supporting the identification of chromium compounds in the catalysts.

6. The absence of Cr5+ oxide reference materials for spectral comparison adds to the uncertainty in identifying the chromium species accurately.

7. The reduced Cr species on the H-ZSM-5 (29) catalyst is exceptionally stable against hydrogen treatment, not being oxidized to a higher oxidation state upon air calcination at 1023 K.

8. The agreement between experimental results, reaction tests, and spectroscopic studies provides a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's behavior during the dehydrogenation process.

9. These findings align with previous research conducted by the authors, reinforcing the effectiveness of chromium-based catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 近期对铬基催化剂的研究主要集中在氧气或空气作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢反应。二氧化碳被认为是乙苯转化为苯乙烯和轻质烷烃（C2-C4）转化为烯烃的潜在非传统氧化剂。

2. 使用二氧化碳作为共反应气体的结果表明，转化率为32%，在6.5小时内保持稳定。

3. 不同类型沸石的催化剂颜色变化，特别是那些硅铝比大于190的高硅沸石，表明它们在空气预处理后的化学性质存在差异。

4. 最活跃催化剂的红外光谱中925 cm-1的峰归因于CrdO双键的伸缩振动，这表明特定的铬化合物存在于活性催化剂中。

5. 在催化剂的红外光谱中，位于985和1000 cm-1的小峰可能表明单核Cr5+氧化物物种的存在，进一步证实了催化剂中存在的铬化合物。

6. 缺乏Cr5+氧化物参考材料进行光谱比较增加了准确识别铬物种的不确定性。

7. H-ZSM-5（29）催化剂上的还原Cr物种在氢处理中非常稳定，即使在1023 K的空气中煅烧也不会被氧化到更高的氧化状态。

8. 实验结果、反应测试和光谱研究的一致性为理解催化剂在脱氢过程中的行为提供了全面的理解。

9. 这些发现与作者之前的研究结果相吻合，强化了铬基催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的有效性。
