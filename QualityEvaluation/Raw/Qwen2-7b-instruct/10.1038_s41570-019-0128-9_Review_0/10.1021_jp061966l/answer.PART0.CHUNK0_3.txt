[1] "Recently, the use of natural gas as a raw material for chemicals has increased in importance. Natural gas typically contains ca. 10% ethane, and the ethane concentration depends on the particular oil field or coal field source. Ethane is typically converted by thermal cracking into ethylene, one of the most important intermediates in the chemical industry."
[2] "From an energy-savings standpoint, catalytic dehydrogenation is superior to thermal dehydrogenation. There are two types of dehydrogenation: simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation."
[3] "Highly active catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 were characterized by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) analysis."
[4] "Cr catalysts supported on a high-silica H-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 > 190 could be prepared easily by impregnation and exhibited high performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2."
[5] "Studies by Amin and Anggoro28 indicate that Cr occupies aluminum positions in ZSM-5 zeolites. The H-ZSM-5(29) and H-ZSM-5(90) zeolites with high levels of Al might block the incorporation of the Cr in the zeolite framework."
[6] "The Cr species seem to be different, and their properties were influenced by the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in the H-ZSM-5 supports."
[7] "In the TPR profiles of the four Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, a sharp and clear reduction peak was observed in the more active catalysts [H-ZSM-5(190), H-ZSM-5(1900)], but no peaks or only very small peaks were detected in the less active catalysts [H-ZSM-5(29), H-ZSM-5(90)]."
[8] "In the active catalysts, Cr/H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/ Al2O3 > 190), Cr6+ ) O, or possibly Cr5+ ) O was the catalytic species on the zeolite support."
[9] "The Cr6+ (or Cr5+) species was reduced to an octahedral Cr3+ species by treatment with ethane at 773 K, and the reduced Cr species was reoxidized to the Cr6+ (or Cr5+) species by treatment with CO2 at 673-773 K."
[10] "The Cr redox cycle played an important role in the catalysts high activity."
[11] "The color of the catalysts (green) indicate that the Cr species in the Cr/H-beta catalyst is similar to that in Cr/H-Y."
[12] "In the reaction over H-ZSM-5(1900), a Cr6+ ) O species was reduced to Cr3+ by ethane treatment, and CO2 treatment led to reoxidation to Cr6+ ) O."
[13] "The reason is that the reduced Cr species on the H-ZSM-5 (29) catalyst is very stable against hydrogen treatment (TPR analysis) and is not oxidized to a higher oxidation state by calcination in air at 1023 K."
[14] "These results indicate that the reduced Cr species is easily reoxidized by CO2 to a highly active initial state."
[15] "Indeed, the reduction of that species to Cr3+ was demonstrated by TPR analysis."
[16] "Spectroscopic analysis revealed that the high-oxidation-state species was likely Cr6+ (possibly Cr5+)."
[17] "Thermo-gravimetric analysis indicated that the formula of the chromium species on H-ZSM-5(1900) support was CrO2.35."
[18] "The FTIR and XAFS results indicate that the reduced Cr species was reoxygenated by CO2 treatment and that the CrdO double bond on the Cr species was completely regenerated."
[19] "The oxidation state of Cr in a working atmosphere is near a Cr3+ state."
[20] "A Cr redox cycle (Scheme 1) may occur during the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2."

1. Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance include selecting the right support material with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio for enhanced activity, ensuring the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions, and balancing the selectivity for the desired product while minimizing byproducts. The redox cycle of the Cr species plays a crucial role in the high dehydrogenation rate. CO2 acts as an effective oxidant for removing carbon from the catalyst surface, enhancing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

2. The key factors influencing the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are the choice of support material, the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, the presence of specific chromium oxidation states (Cr6+ or Cr5+), and the redox cycle involving these species. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio significantly affects the activity and stability of the catalyst, with higher ratios leading to improved performance. The presence of Cr6+ or Cr5+ species is essential for the catalytic activity, and the redox cycle facilitates the efficient conversion of ethane to ethylene. CO2 is a critical component as it acts as an oxidant, assisting in the removal of carbon deposits and maintaining the catalyst's activity.

3. The role of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane lies primarily in its function as an oxidant, which helps to remove carbon deposits from the catalyst surface. This not only prevents deactivation but also enhances the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Additionally, CO2 assists in suppressing the formation of coke, a common byproduct in catalytic processes, thus preserving the catalyst's performance over time. The ability of CO2 to facilitate the redox cycle involving chromium species further optimizes the catalytic activity, making it an indispensable component in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
