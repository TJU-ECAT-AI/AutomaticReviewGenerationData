[1] "Recently, the use of natural gas as a raw material for chem-  ical production has increased in importance. Natural gas typically contains ca. 10% ethane, and the ethane concentration depends on the particular oil field or coal field source. Ethane is typically converted by thermal cracking into ethylene, one of the most important intermediates in the chemical industry."
[2] "There are two types of dehydrogenation: simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation. Recently, research on chromium-based catalysts has tended to be directed toward oxidative dehydrogenation using oxygen or air as an oxidant."
[3] "Carbon dioxide is a promising nonconventional oxidant (or co-feed gas) for catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene and light alkanes (C2-C4) to alkenes."
[4] "In the active catalysts, Cr/H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/ Al2O3 > 190), Cr6+ ) O, or possibly Cr5+ ) O was the catalytic species on the zeolite support."
[5] "The Cr6+ (or Cr5+) species was reduced to an octahedral Cr3+ species by treatment with ethane at 773 K, and the reduced Cr species was reoxidized to the Cr6+ (or Cr5+) species by treatment with CO2 at 673-773 K. The Cr redox cycle played an important role in the catalysts high activity."
[6] "Studies by Amin and Anggoro28 indicate that Cr occupies aluminum positions in ZSM-5 zeolites. The H-ZSM-5(29) and H-ZSM-5(90) zeolites with high levels of Al might block the incorporation of the Cr in the zeolite framework."
[7] "No peak was detected with pure Cr2O3, where the oxidation state of the Cr is Cr3+ and is already low. On the zeolite samples that undergo reduction the Cr species is in higher oxidation states (e.g., Cr5+ and Cr6+), according to the color of the catalysts, and the samples exhibit a reduction peak."
[8] "The peak for the CrdO double bond was observed even in the 2% Cr content sample. The spectra of the 5% and 10% samples exhibited very small peaks at 985 and 1000 cm-1, which may be assigned to the stretching vibrations of the Cr-O bond in mononuclear Cr5+ oxide species."
[9] "These results indicate that the average oxidation state of the Cr species at the reaction condition is reduced slightly. Probably, the rate of oxidative dehydrogenation by the CrdO species is higher than the rate of reoxidation of the reduced Cr species by CO2."
[10] "The XANES results indicate that the Cr3+ species formed by ethane treatment was reoxidized to tetrahedral Cr6+ ) O by treatment with CO2 at 823 K."

1. The use of natural gas, particularly ethane, as a raw material for chemical production has become increasingly important. Ethane is typically converted to ethylene via thermal cracking, a common industrial process. Oxidative dehydrogenation offers an alternative approach, utilizing catalysts such as chromium oxide.

2. Chromium-based catalysts, especially those using oxygen or air as oxidants, have been focused on for oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

3. Carbon dioxide acts as a non-traditional oxidant for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene and light alkanes to alkenes.

4. In the most active catalysts, chromium (Cr) is identified as the catalytic species, existing in states such as Cr6+ or possibly Cr5+ on the zeolite support.

5. The redox cycle of Cr species plays a crucial role in the catalyst's high activity, with Cr6+ or Cr5+ being reduced to Cr3+ by ethane and then reoxidized to their original state by carbon dioxide at specific temperatures.

6. Zeolites with higher silicon-to-aluminum ratios (SiO2/Al2O3 > 190) facilitate the incorporation of chromium, while those with higher aluminum content may hinder its integration within the zeolite framework.

7. In contrast to pure chromium oxide, which has a low oxidation state, chromium on zeolite samples that undergo reduction exhibits higher oxidation states (Cr5+ and Cr6+) indicative of a more active catalyst.

8. Even at low chromium concentrations, a CrdO double bond is observed, suggesting the presence of chromium species with specific bonding configurations.

9. The reaction conditions lead to a slight reduction in the average oxidation state of chromium species, potentially enhancing the oxidative dehydrogenation rate compared to the reoxidation rate.

10. Treatment with carbon dioxide facilitates the reoxidation of the reduced Cr species to its original state of tetrahedral Cr6+ or Cr5+.

1. 天然气，尤其是乙烷，作为化工原料的使用变得越来越重要。乙烷通常通过热裂解转化为乙烯，这是化工行业中的常见过程。氧化脱氢提供了另一种方法，利用诸如铬氧化物的催化剂。

2. 铬基催化剂，特别是使用氧气或空气作为氧化剂，已集中于氧化脱氢过程中。

3. 二氧化碳作为非传统氧化剂用于乙苯到苯乙烯和轻烃（C2-C4）到烯烃的脱氢反应。

4. 在活性催化剂中，铬（Cr）被识别为催化物种，在沸石支持上以Cr6+或可能Cr5+的形式存在。

5. 铬的氧化还原循环在催化剂的高活性中扮演着重要角色，Cr6+或Cr5+通过乙烷被还原至Cr3+，然后通过二氧化碳在特定温度下被重新氧化至其原始状态。

6. 具有更高硅铝比（SiO2/Al2O3 > 190）的沸石有利于铬的整合，而含有较高铝含量的沸石可能会阻碍其进入框架。

7. 相对于纯铬氧化物（氧化态较低），经过还原处理的沸石样品中的铬物种显示出了更高的氧化态（Cr5+和Cr6+），这表明催化剂更活跃。

8. 即使在低铬浓度下，也观察到了CrdO双键的存在，这表明存在具有特定配位结构的铬物种。

9. 反应条件导致铬物种的平均氧化态略有降低，这可能增加了氧化脱氢速率与还原速率相比。

10. 二氧化碳处理促进了还原的铬物种的重新氧化至其原始状态的四面体Cr6+或Cr5+。
