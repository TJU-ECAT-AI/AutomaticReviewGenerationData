The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340C (Table1). Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%). The difference is clearer when we compare the mass-specific activity (Figure1b). The stable activity of Fe-1.2Na is around 0.72molCOgFe1h1, while that of Fe-Zn-0.81Na is 2.4molCOgFe1h1, which is three times higher than the former. Therefore, in line with XRD and CO adsorption results, this means that Zn works as a structural promoter, the addition of which leads to smaller Fe crystals and therefore more exposed surface sites. Consequently, the mass-specific activity is dramatically increased.

The use of zinc and sodium-modulated iron carbide catalysts exhibits exceptional activity and high selectivity for alkenes, reaching up to 79% selectivity, while maintaining modest CO2 selectivity. This is crucial for achieving a full spectrum of alkene production with relatively low CO2 selectivity.

The introduction of sodium to the catalyst system significantly reduces the selectivity towards CO2, allowing for a larger proportion of the available carbon resource in syngas to be converted into hydrocarbons. Additionally, it effectively suppresses the formation of saturated hydrocarbons and methane.
