[1] "The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340C (Table1). Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
[2] "The stable activity of Fe-1.2Na is around 0.72molCOgFe1h1, while that of Fe-Zn-0.81Na is 2.4molCOgFe1h1, which is three times higher than the former."
[3] "Therefore, in line with XRD and CO adsorption results, this means that Zn works as a structural promoter, the addition of which leads to smaller Fe crystals and therefore more exposed surface sites."
[4] "Indeed, a small amount of Na may act as an electronic donator to Fe or iron carbide, which facilitates the activation of CO and leads to a higher FTS activity."
[5] "Most importantly, there was an obvious correlation between selectivity of products and Na concentration (Figure1e)."
[6] "This result indicates that Na not only accelerates alkene desorption on the surface, but also suppresses the secondary hydrogenation of alkenes."

The use of zinc (Zn) and sodium (Na) in modulating iron carbide catalysts enhances their activity and selectivity in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) process. Specifically, Zn changes the size of the coprecipitated iron species, acting as a structural promoter that increases the surface area of the catalyst. The presence of Na on the surface of the Fe catalyst alters the electronic structure, promoting CO activation and desorption of products while suppressing hydrogenation of double bonds. This results in an unexpected selectivity for alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms. The introduction of Na into the catalyst system also suppresses the formation of unwanted products, improving the overall carbon efficiency and selectivity for alkenes.

The addition of Na into the Fe-Zn catalyst system enhances its ability to facilitate the activation of CO, which boosts the FTS activity. There is a clear correlation between the Na concentration and the selectivity of the products. Increasing the Na content leads to better alkene desorption from the surface, preventing the secondary hydrogenation of alkenes. This results in a higher selectivity for alkenes, especially those with more than five carbon atoms. The catalyst system also shows a relatively low selectivity towards CO2, which is advantageous for efficient use of the carbon resource in the FTS process.

在铁碳催化剂中加入锌（Zn）和钠（Na）显著提高了Fischer-Tropsch合成（FTS）过程中的活性和选择性。具体来说，Zn改变了共沉淀铁物种的大小，作为结构促进剂，增加了催化剂的表面积。表面的Na的存在改变了电子结构，促进了CO的激活和产品的脱附，同时抑制了双键的氢化。这导致了意想不到的烯烃选择性，特别是那些含有五个或更多碳原子的烯烃。通过向催化剂系统中引入Na，可以抑制形成不希望得到的产品，从而提高整体碳效率和烯烃选择性。

向Fe-Zn催化剂体系中添加Na增强了其促进CO活化的能力，从而提升了FTS活性。Na含量与产物选择性之间存在明显的相关性。增加Na含量能够更好地促进烯烃从表面的脱附，防止烯烃的二次氢化。这导致了更高的烯烃选择性，尤其是那些含有五个或更多碳原子的烯烃。该催化剂体系还显示了相对较低的CO2选择性，这对于有效利用FTS过程中的碳资源非常有利。
