[1] "Fe-Zn-xNa catalysts were synthesized by a coprecipitation/washing method."
[2] "Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
[3] "Therefore, in line with XRD and CO adsorption results, this means that Zn works as a structural promoter, the addition of which leads to smaller Fe crystals and therefore more exposed surface sites."
[4] "The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340C (Table1)."
[5] "Most of the Fe-based catalysts for alkene production have a strong tendency to produce a large amount of CO2,20 and the CO2 selectivity of Fe catalyst for alkene production in previous reports is normally above 36% at high temperature.21 Therefore, the suppression of CO2 formation is a major task for FTS research at high temperature."
[6] "We used STEM/EDX to study the distributions of different elements in Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst after 3h of reaction, which already reached the best performance in steady-state FTS (Figure2)."
[7] "Indeed, from the plotted charge density difference based on DFT calculations (Supporting Information, FiguresS6 and S7), it can be seen that delocalized electrons are transferred from Na to the interface of iron when the Na ion is distributed on the surface of Fe5C2, making the surface iron carbide species electron rich."
[8] "Clearly, a much narrower pulse width of propene was observed on the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst than that for Fe-Zn (half width: 7s vs. 13s), demonstrating the weaker adsorption, and thus the faster desorption, of alkenes on the surface of the Na-modified iron carbide catalyst."
[9] "However, the desorption of C3H6 cannot occur on the clean surface of Fe5C2 (111) because its hydrogenation barrier is lower than the desorption barrier (0.67<0.82eV)."
[10] "From a frontier orbital point of view, the adsorption of olefins (C=C) corresponds to a major interaction between the surface z2 band and the πσ/πσ* state, as shown in Figure4b. The doping Na breaks the symmetry of such a z2 band on the surface, leading to weakening of the adsorption of olefins."

The synthesis of Fe-Zn-xNa catalysts involved a coprecipitation/washing method. The addition of zinc in the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst led to a significant increase in CO conversion from 48.7% to 77.2% compared to the Fe-1.2Na catalyst. Zinc acts as a structural promoter, resulting in smaller iron crystals and more exposed surface sites. The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340°C, and it was found that most of the Fe-based catalysts tend to produce a large amount of CO2, making the suppression of CO2 formation a major challenge in FTS research at high temperatures. The study utilized STEM/EDX to analyze the element distributions in the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst after reaching steady-state FTS performance. DFT calculations revealed that sodium ions distribute delocalized electrons to the iron surface when present on the surface of Fe5C2, making the surface iron carbide species electron rich. The presence of sodium on the catalyst surface also resulted in the faster desorption of alkenes, inhibiting their hydrogenation. This is due to the weakening of olefin adsorption caused by the breaking of symmetry of the z2 band on the surface by sodium doping. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using sodium-modulated Fe catalysts for the selective production of alkenes in the FT synthesis process.

Fe-Zn-xNa 催化剂通过共沉淀/洗涤方法合成。在Fe-Zn-0.81Na 催化剂中添加锌导致CO 转化率从48.7%显著增加到77.2%，与Fe-1.2Na 催化剂相比。锌作为结构促进剂，导致铁晶体更小，暴露更多表面位点。在340°C 下对催化剂进行了催化性能评估，发现大多数Fe 基催化剂倾向于产生大量CO2，因此在高温下抑制CO2 形成是FTS 研究的主要挑战。研究利用STEM/EDX 分析了Fe-Zn-0.81Na 催化剂在达到稳定态FTS 性能后的元素分布情况。DFT 计算表明，当钠离子存在于Fe5C2 表面时，钠离子在铁表面分布了离域电子，使得表面铁碳物种的电子丰富。催化剂表面的钠存在不仅加速了烯烃的脱附，还抑制了它们的氢化反应。这是由于钠掺杂破坏了表面z2 带的对称性，导致烯烃吸附减弱。研究表明，使用钠调节的Fe 催化剂对于FT 合成过程中选择性生产烯烃的有效性。
