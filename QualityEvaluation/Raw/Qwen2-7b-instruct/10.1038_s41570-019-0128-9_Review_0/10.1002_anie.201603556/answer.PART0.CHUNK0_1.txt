[1] "Significantly, deJong etal. reported that lower olefins can be selectively produced on S- and Na-modified Fe catalyst."
[2] "Alkali metals are typically added to Fe-based catalyst as promoters to improve the catalytic performance by increasing the selectivity for lower olefins."
[3] "Moreover, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface suppresses the hydrogenation of double bonds and promotes desorption of products, which renders the catalyst unexpectedly reactive toward alkenesespecially C5+ alkenes (with more than 50% selectivity in hydrocarbons) while lowering the selectivity for undesired products."
[4] "By combining various insitu characterization approaches with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a rationale for the structural modulation provided by Zn and the electronic modulation given by Na ions has been clearly revealed, which is vital for understanding complicated multicomponent FTS catalytic systems and contributes toward the development of highly selective FTS processes."
[5] "Indeed, from the plotted charge density difference based on DFT calculations (Supporting Information, FiguresS6 and S7), it can be seen that delocalized electrons are transferred from Na to the interface of iron when the Na ion is distributed on the surface of Fe5C2, making the surface iron carbide species electron rich."
[6] "Clearly, a much narrower pulse width of propene was observed on the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst than that for Fe-Zn (half width: 7s vs. 13s), demonstrating the weaker adsorption, and thus the faster desorption, of alkenes on the surface of the Na-modified iron carbide catalyst."

This study demonstrates that the use of sodium (Na)-modulated iron carbide catalysts can significantly enhance the selectivity for alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms (C5+ alkenes), in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) process. The introduction of sodium ions onto the surface of the catalyst alters the electronic structure, promoting the activation of carbon monoxide (CO) and facilitating the desorption of products, while simultaneously suppressing the hydrogenation of double bonds. This results in unexpected reactivity towards alkenes, with selectivities exceeding 50% in hydrocarbon products. The study highlights the importance of both structural modulation provided by zinc (Zn) and electronic modulation given by sodium ions in achieving highly selective catalysts for the production of high-value chemicals from syngas-derived alkenes.

本研究证明，使用钠（Na）修饰的铁碳催化剂可以在费希尔-特罗普斯合成（FTS）过程中显著提高烯烃的选择性，特别是五碳及以上的烯烃（C5+烯烃）。在催化剂表面引入钠离子改变了电子结构，促进了二氧化碳的激活并促进产品的脱附，同时抑制了双键的氢化。这导致了对烯烃的异常反应性，其中烃类产品的选择性超过50%。研究表明，在从合成气衍生烯烃生产高价值化学品过程中，锌（Zn）的结构修饰和钠离子提供的电子修饰对于实现高度选择性的催化剂至关重要。
