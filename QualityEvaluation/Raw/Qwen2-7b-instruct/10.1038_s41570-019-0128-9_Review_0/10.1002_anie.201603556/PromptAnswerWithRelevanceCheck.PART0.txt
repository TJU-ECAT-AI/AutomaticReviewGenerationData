[1] "Fe-Zn-xNa catalysts were synthesized by a coprecipitation/washing method."
[2] "Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
[3] "Therefore, in line with XRD and CO adsorption results, this means that Zn works as a structural promoter, the addition of which leads to smaller Fe crystals and therefore more exposed surface sites."
[4] "The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340C (Table1)."
[5] "Most of the Fe-based catalysts for alkene production have a strong tendency to produce a large amount of CO2,20 and the CO2 selectivity of Fe catalyst for alkene production in previous reports is normally above 36% at high temperature.21 Therefore, the suppression of CO2 formation is a major task for FTS research at high temperature."
[6] "We used STEM/EDX to study the distributions of different elements in Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst after 3h of reaction, which already reached the best performance in steady-state FTS (Figure2)."
[7] "Indeed, from the plotted charge density difference based on DFT calculations (Supporting Information, FiguresS6 and S7), it can be seen that delocalized electrons are transferred from Na to the interface of iron when the Na ion is distributed on the surface of Fe5C2, making the surface iron carbide species electron rich."
[8] "Clearly, a much narrower pulse width of propene was observed on the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst than that for Fe-Zn (half width: 7s vs. 13s), demonstrating the weaker adsorption, and thus the faster desorption, of alkenes on the surface of the Na-modified iron carbide catalyst."
[9] "However, the desorption of C3H6 cannot occur on the clean surface of Fe5C2 (111) because its hydrogenation barrier is lower than the desorption barrier (0.67<0.82eV)."
[10] "From a frontier orbital point of view, the adsorption of olefins (C=C) corresponds to a major interaction between the surface z2 band and the πσ/πσ* state, as shown in Figure4b. The doping Na breaks the symmetry of such a z2 band on the surface, leading to weakening of the adsorption of olefins."

The synthesis of Fe-Zn-xNa catalysts involved a coprecipitation/washing method. The addition of zinc in the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst led to a significant increase in CO conversion from 48.7% to 77.2% compared to the Fe-1.2Na catalyst. Zinc acts as a structural promoter, resulting in smaller iron crystals and more exposed surface sites. The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340°C, and it was found that most of the Fe-based catalysts tend to produce a large amount of CO2, making the suppression of CO2 formation a major challenge in FTS research at high temperatures. The study utilized STEM/EDX to analyze the element distributions in the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst after reaching steady-state FTS performance. DFT calculations revealed that sodium ions distribute delocalized electrons to the iron surface when present on the surface of Fe5C2, making the surface iron carbide species electron rich. The presence of sodium on the catalyst surface also resulted in the faster desorption of alkenes, inhibiting their hydrogenation. This is due to the weakening of olefin adsorption caused by the breaking of symmetry of the z2 band on the surface by sodium doping. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using sodium-modulated Fe catalysts for the selective production of alkenes in the FT synthesis process.

Fe-Zn-xNa 催化剂通过共沉淀/洗涤方法合成。在Fe-Zn-0.81Na 催化剂中添加锌导致CO 转化率从48.7%显著增加到77.2%，与Fe-1.2Na 催化剂相比。锌作为结构促进剂，导致铁晶体更小，暴露更多表面位点。在340°C 下对催化剂进行了催化性能评估，发现大多数Fe 基催化剂倾向于产生大量CO2，因此在高温下抑制CO2 形成是FTS 研究的主要挑战。研究利用STEM/EDX 分析了Fe-Zn-0.81Na 催化剂在达到稳定态FTS 性能后的元素分布情况。DFT 计算表明，当钠离子存在于Fe5C2 表面时，钠离子在铁表面分布了离域电子，使得表面铁碳物种的电子丰富。催化剂表面的钠存在不仅加速了烯烃的脱附，还抑制了它们的氢化反应。这是由于钠掺杂破坏了表面z2 带的对称性，导致烯烃吸附减弱。研究表明，使用钠调节的Fe 催化剂对于FT 合成过程中选择性生产烯烃的有效性。

[1] "Significantly, deJong etal. reported that lower olefins can be selectively produced on S- and Na-modified Fe catalyst."
[2] "Alkali metals are typically added to Fe-based catalyst as promoters to improve the catalytic performance by increasing the selectivity for lower olefins."
[3] "Moreover, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface suppresses the hydrogenation of double bonds and promotes desorption of products, which renders the catalyst unexpectedly reactive toward alkenesespecially C5+ alkenes (with more than 50% selectivity in hydrocarbons) while lowering the selectivity for undesired products."
[4] "By combining various insitu characterization approaches with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a rationale for the structural modulation provided by Zn and the electronic modulation given by Na ions has been clearly revealed, which is vital for understanding complicated multicomponent FTS catalytic systems and contributes toward the development of highly selective FTS processes."
[5] "Indeed, from the plotted charge density difference based on DFT calculations (Supporting Information, FiguresS6 and S7), it can be seen that delocalized electrons are transferred from Na to the interface of iron when the Na ion is distributed on the surface of Fe5C2, making the surface iron carbide species electron rich."

This study demonstrates that the use of sodium (Na)-modulated iron carbide catalysts can significantly enhance the selectivity for alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms (C5+ alkenes), in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) process. The introduction of sodium ions onto the surface of the catalyst alters the electronic structure, promoting the activation of carbon monoxide (CO) and facilitating the desorption of products, while simultaneously suppressing the hydrogenation of double bonds. This results in unexpected reactivity towards alkenes, with selectivities exceeding 50% in hydrocarbon products. The study highlights the importance of both structural modulation provided by zinc (Zn) and electronic modulation given by sodium ions in achieving highly selective catalysts for the production of high-value chemicals from syngas-derived alkenes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The use of zinc (Zn) and sodium (Na) in modulating iron carbide catalysts enhances their activity and selectivity in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) process. Specifically, Zn changes the size of the coprecipitated iron species, acting as a structural promoter that increases the surface area of the catalyst. The presence of Na on the surface of the Fe catalyst alters the electronic structure, promoting CO activation and desorption of products while suppressing hydrogenation of double bonds. This results in an unexpected selectivity for alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms. The introduction of Na into the catalyst system also suppresses the formation of unwanted products, improving the overall carbon efficiency and selectivity for alkenes.

The addition of Na into the Fe-Zn catalyst system enhances its ability to facilitate the activation of CO, which boosts the FTS activity. There is a clear correlation between the Na concentration and the selectivity of the products. Increasing the Na content leads to better alkene desorption from the surface, preventing the secondary hydrogenation of alkenes. This results in a higher selectivity for alkenes, especially those with more than five carbon atoms. The catalyst system also shows a relatively low selectivity towards CO2, which is advantageous for efficient use of the carbon resource in the FTS process.

在铁碳催化剂中加入锌（Zn）和钠（Na）显著提高了Fischer-Tropsch合成（FTS）过程中的活性和选择性。具体来说，Zn改变了共沉淀铁物种的大小，作为结构促进剂，增加了催化剂的表面积。表面的Na的存在改变了电子结构，促进了CO的激活和产品的脱附，同时抑制了双键的氢化。这导致了意想不到的烯烃选择性，特别是那些含有五个或更多碳原子的烯烃。通过向催化剂系统中引入Na，可以抑制形成不希望得到的产品，从而提高整体碳效率和烯烃选择性。

向Fe-Zn催化剂体系中添加Na增强了其促进CO活化的能力，从而提升了FTS活性。Na含量与产物选择性之间存在明显的相关性。增加Na含量能够更好地促进烯烃从表面的脱附，防止烯烃的二次氢化。这导致了更高的烯烃选择性，尤其是那些含有五个或更多碳原子的烯烃。该催化剂体系还显示了相对较低的CO2选择性，这对于有效利用FTS过程中的碳资源非常有利。
