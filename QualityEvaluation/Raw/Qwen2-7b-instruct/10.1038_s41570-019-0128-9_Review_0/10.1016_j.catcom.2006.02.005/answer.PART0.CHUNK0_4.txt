[1] "A series of chromium catalysts supported on titanosilicate-1 (TS-1) molecular sieves with different nSi/nTi ratios prepared by impregnation method have been tested for the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide between 450 and 650 C."
[2] "The results showed that Cr/TS-1 (nSi/nTi = 30) catalyst effectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide at 650 C, giving 47.4% ethylene yield with a selectivity of 90.0%."
[3] "Catalytic stability and regeneration performance of the Cr/TS-1 (nSi/ nTi = 30) catalyst were also investigated."
[4] "It was seen that the conversion of ethane gradually decreased with the increase of reaction time, indicating a deactivation of the catalyst."
[5] "After the reaction for 3 h, the gas flow of the mixture of ethane and carbon dioxide was stopped and replaced by the gas flow of O2 at a rate of 50 mlmin−1. After the treatment with O2 for 3 h, replacing the gas flow with a mixture of ethane and carbon dioxide, then the reaction was again started. The activity of Cr/TS-1(30) was recovered as seen by the fact that ethane conversion returned to the original value."

1. Various support materials including TS-1 molecular sieves with different nSi/nTi ratios were tested for the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The Cr/TS-1 (nSi/nTi = 30) catalyst effectively converted ethane to ethylene at 650°C with a high yield and selectivity.
2. The stability and regeneration performance of the Cr/TS-1 (nSi/nTi = 30) catalyst were evaluated. The catalyst's activity decreased over time during the reaction.
3. After treating the catalyst with oxygen, its activity was recovered, as evidenced by the return of ethane conversion to its initial level.

1. 不同nSi/nTi比率的TS-1分子筛支持的多种铬催化剂被测试用于乙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢反应。Cr/TS-1 (nSi/nTi = 30) 催化剂在650°C时有效将乙烷转化为乙烯，产率高，选择性好。
2. 对Cr/TS-1 (nSi/nTi = 30) 催化剂的稳定性和再生性能进行了评估。催化剂的活性随反应时间的增加而降低。
3. 在对催化剂进行氧气处理后，其活性得到恢复，表现为乙烷转化率回到初始水平。
