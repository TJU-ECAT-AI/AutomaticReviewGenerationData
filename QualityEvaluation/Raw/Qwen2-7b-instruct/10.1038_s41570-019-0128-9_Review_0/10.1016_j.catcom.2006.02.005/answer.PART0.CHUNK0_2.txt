[1] "Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts showed excellent performances for this reaction,especially Cr/SiO2 catalyst."
[2] "Cr/TS-1 (nSi/nTi = 30) catalyst effectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide at 650 C, giving 47.4% ethylene yield with a selectivity of 90.0%."
[3] "In our case, TPR results showed that the interaction of high-valence chromium species with the supports over Cr/TS-1(60) and Cr/TS-1(150) catalysts was relatively weaker compared to that of Cr/TS-1(15) and Cr/TS-1(30) catalysts, which can well account for their different initial catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of ethane."

The use of various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 affects the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. In particular, Cr/SiO2 catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in dehydrogenating ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide. The presence of reducible chromium species in the Cr/TS-1 catalysts (with nSi/nTi ratios of 30, 60, 150) enabled high activity at temperatures up to 650°C, with the Cr/TS-1(30) catalyst showing the highest ethylene yield (47.4%) and selectivity (90.0%). The TPR results suggest that the interaction of high-valence chromium species with the supports was weaker for the Cr/TS-1(60) and Cr/TS-1(150) catalysts compared to the Cr/TS-1(15) and Cr/TS-1(30) catalysts, which explains their differing catalytic activities. The order of activities was Cr/TS-1(150) > Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) > Cr/TS-1(15), while the order of ethylene selectivity was opposite to that of activities. The Cr/TS-1(30) catalyst, while highly selective and active, deactivates quickly during the reaction. Optimization of the overall performance involves modifying the supports and active phases to enhance stability and selectivity.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，各种支持材料如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2对铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径产生了影响。特别是Cr/SiO2催化剂在二氧化碳存在下高效地将乙烷脱氢为乙烯。Cr/TS-1催化剂（nSi/nTi比分别为30、60、150）在650°C时表现出高活性，其中Cr/TS-1(30)催化剂显示出最高的乙烯产率（47.4%）和选择性（90.0%）。TPR结果表明，与Cr/TS-1(15)和Cr/TS-1(30)催化剂相比，Cr/TS-1(60)和Cr/TS-1(150)催化剂中的高电荷铬物种与支撑物之间的相互作用较弱，这解释了它们在乙烷脱氢反应中的不同催化活性。活动顺序为Cr/TS-1(150) > Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) > Cr/TS-1(15)，而乙烯选择性顺序与活性相反。Cr/TS-1(30)催化剂虽然具有高选择性和活性，但在反应过程中快速失活。优化整体性能涉及修改支撑体和活性相以增强稳定性与选择性。
