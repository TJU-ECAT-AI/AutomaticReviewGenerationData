The catalytic activity, observed at temperatures as low as 450 C can be well explained on the basis of the existence of reducible chromium species.
Moreover, the catalytic stability and regeneration performance of the Cr/TS-1 (nSi/ nTi = 30) catalyst were also investigated.
The order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS-1(150)  Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30)  Cr/TS-1(15).
The order of ethylene selectivity was in opposition to that of activities.
Cr/TS-1(30) showed 47.4% ethylene yield with a selectivity of 90.0% among these catalysts, whereas, this catalyst deactivated quickly during this reaction.
In order to improve the catalytic stability of this family of materials new experiments are being carried out to modify the sup- ports and the active phase.
