The catalytic activity, observed at temperatures as low as 450 C can be well explained on the basis of the existence of reducible chromium species.
Moreover, the catalytic stability and regeneration performance of the Cr/TS-1 (nSi/ nTi = 30) catalyst were also investigated.
The order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS-1(150)  Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30)  Cr/TS-1(15).
The order of ethylene selectivity was in opposition to that of activities.
Cr/TS-1(30) showed 47.4% ethylene yield with a selectivity of 90.0% among these catalysts, whereas, this catalyst deactivated quickly during this reaction.
In order to improve the catalytic stability of this family of materials new experiments are being carried out to modify the sup- ports and the active phase.

The use of various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 affects the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. In particular, Cr/SiO2 catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in dehydrogenating ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide. The presence of reducible chromium species in the Cr/TS-1 catalysts (with nSi/nTi ratios of 30, 60, 150) enabled high activity at temperatures up to 650°C, with the Cr/TS-1(30) catalyst showing the highest ethylene yield (47.4%) and selectivity (90.0%). The TPR results suggest that the interaction of high-valence chromium species with the supports was weaker for the Cr/TS-1(60) and Cr/TS-1(150) catalysts compared to the Cr/TS-1(15) and Cr/TS-1(30) catalysts, which explains their differing catalytic activities. The order of activities was Cr/TS-1(150) > Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) > Cr/TS-1(15), while the order of ethylene selectivity was opposite to that of activities. The Cr/TS-1(30) catalyst, while highly selective and active, deactivates quickly during the reaction. Optimization of the overall performance involves modifying the supports and active phases to enhance stability and selectivity.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，各种支持材料如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2对铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径产生了影响。特别是Cr/SiO2催化剂在二氧化碳存在下高效地将乙烷脱氢为乙烯。Cr/TS-1催化剂（nSi/nTi比分别为30、60、150）在650°C时表现出高活性，其中Cr/TS-1(30)催化剂显示出最高的乙烯产率（47.4%）和选择性（90.0%）。TPR结果表明，与Cr/TS-1(15)和Cr/TS-1(30)催化剂相比，Cr/TS-1(60)和Cr/TS-1(150)催化剂中的高电荷铬物种与支撑物之间的相互作用较弱，这解释了它们在乙烷脱氢反应中的不同催化活性。活动顺序为Cr/TS-1(150) > Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) > Cr/TS-1(15)，而乙烯选择性顺序与活性相反。Cr/TS-1(30)催化剂虽然具有高选择性和活性，但在反应过程中快速失活。优化整体性能涉及修改支撑体和活性相以增强稳定性与选择性。

[5] "After the reaction for 3 h, the gas flow of the mixture of ethane and carbon dioxide was stopped and replaced by the gas flow of O2 at a rate of 50 mlmin−1. After the treatment with O2 for 3 h, replacing the gas flow with a mixture of ethane and carbon dioxide, then the reaction was again started. The activity of Cr/TS-1(30) was recovered as seen by the fact that ethane conversion returned to the original value."
