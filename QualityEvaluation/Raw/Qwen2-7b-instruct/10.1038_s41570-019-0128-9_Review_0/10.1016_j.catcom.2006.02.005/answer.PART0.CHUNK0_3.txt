[1] "A series of chromium catalysts supported on titanosilicate-1 (TS-1) molecular sieves with different nSi/nTi ratios prepared by impreg- nation method have been tested for the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide between 450 and 650 C."
[2] "The results showed that Cr/TS-1 (nSi/nTi = 30) catalyst effectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide at 650 C, giving 47.4% ethylene yield with a selectivity of 90.0%."
[3] "Moreover, the catalytic stability and regeneration performance of the Cr/TS-1 (nSi/ nTi = 30) catalyst were also investigated."
[4] "The order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS- 1(150) > Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) > Cr/TS-1(15)."
[5] "This behavior was a consequence of the exis- tence of reducible chromium species."
[6] "Cr/TS-1(30) showed 47.4% ethylene yield with a selectivity of 90.0% among these catalysts, whereas, this cat- alyst deactivated quickly during this reaction."
[7] "In order to improve the catalytic stability of this family of materials new experiments are being carried out to modify the sup- ports and the active phase."

1. Chromium catalysts supported on TS-1 molecular sieves with different nSi/nTi ratios were tested for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 between 450 and 650°C. The Cr/TS-1 catalyst with nSi/nTi = 30 showed effective dehydrogenation at 650°C, yielding 47.4% ethylene with a selectivity of 90.0%.

2. The catalytic stability and regeneration performance of the Cr/TS-1 catalyst with nSi/nTi = 30 were also evaluated. This catalyst demonstrated high activity for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

3. The order of activities of the catalysts was Cr/TS-1(150) > Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) > Cr/TS-1(15), indicating that the presence of reducible chromium species was crucial for their activity in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation.

4. The catalyst with nSi/nTi = 30 had the highest activity among the tested catalysts, showing a 47.4% ethylene yield with 90.0% selectivity. However, it deactivated quickly during the reaction.

5. Efforts to improve the stability of the catalyst family are ongoing, focusing on modifying the supports and the active phase.

1. 不同nSi/nTi比例的TS-1分子筛支持的铬催化剂在450至650°C范围内用于乙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢测试。nSi/nTi为30的Cr/TS-1催化剂在650°C下表现出有效的脱氢，产生47.4%的乙烯和90.0%的选择性。

2. 对于nSi/nTi为30的Cr/TS-1催化剂，其催化稳定性和再生性能也进行了评估。该催化剂在二氧化碳存在下的乙烷脱氢显示出高活性。

3. 催化剂的活性顺序为Cr/TS-1(150) > Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) > Cr/TS-1(15)，表明可还原的铬物种的存在对于它们在二氧化碳氧化脱氢中的活性至关重要。

4. 具有nSi/nTi为30的催化剂在所有测试催化剂中具有最高的活性，显示47.4%的乙烯产率和90.0%的选择性。然而，它在反应过程中迅速失效。

5. 努力提高催化剂家族的稳定性正在进行中，重点是修改支撑和活性相。
