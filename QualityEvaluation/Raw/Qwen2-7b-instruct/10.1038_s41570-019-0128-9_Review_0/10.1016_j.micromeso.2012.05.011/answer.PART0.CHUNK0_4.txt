[1] "The results of the in situ UVvis DR measurements obtained during the first 10 min on-stream led to a conclusion that in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the Cr6+ species play a similar role as in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation, i.e. they are the precursors of dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit high activity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[2] "The observed partial deactivation of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by excessive coke formation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. In the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly at the beginning of the process. The resultant Cr2+ and Cr3+ species trigger redox cycles that are responsible for the high catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials.
2. The primary reason for the partial deactivation of the catalysts during the propane dehydrogenation reaction is indeed coke formation. Irreversible deactivation caused by either pore structure destruction and/or inactive species formation has a smaller impact.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 在存在CO2的丙烷脱氢反应中，Cr6+物种在过程开始时被快速还原。产生的Cr2+和Cr3+物种触发了负责高催化剂活性的氧化还原循环。
2. 催化剂部分失活的主要原因是焦炭形成。由孔结构破坏或不活性物种形成的不可逆失活对的影响较小。
