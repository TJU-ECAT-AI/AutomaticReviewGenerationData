[1] "In the calcined catalysts chromium species are stabilized as Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+ species."
[2] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."
[3] "The observed partial deactivation of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by excessive coke formation."

1. Various support materials, including SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. CO2 partial pressure also plays a crucial role in determining the performance of these catalysts. The challenge lies in optimizing their overall performance considering factors like support choice and reaction conditions.

2. Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, significantly affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts. The key trade-offs involve balancing CO2 incorporation with maintaining high catalytic activity and selectivity towards desired products.

3. Challenges in optimizing the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions include controlling the formation of coke, managing the distribution of chromium species, and enhancing stability over multiple reaction cycles. Trade-offs often arise between maximizing activity and selectivity while minimizing deactivation mechanisms such as coke formation.
