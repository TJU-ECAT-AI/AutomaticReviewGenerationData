[2] "In the presence of CO2 an additional oxidative pathway of propene formation is activated."
[3] "In the RWGS reaction the CO formation rate rises together with the concentration of Cr redox species in CrOx/SBA-1 catalysts similar as in the case of DHPCO2."

1. The various support materials and reaction conditions influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the presence of CO2 activates an additional oxidative pathway for propene formation. The CO formation rate in the RWGS reaction increases with the concentration of redox chromium species in the catalyst. The primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation during the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

2. The challenges in optimizing the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts include balancing the activity, selectivity, and stability across different support materials and reaction conditions. Trade-offs exist between maximizing the activity for propene production and maintaining stability over multiple cycles, especially in the presence of CO2 which can lead to coke formation and deactivation.

3. The stability of the catalysts is influenced by the pore structure of the support materials. For example, mesoporous materials like SBA-1 exhibit good stability for dehydrogenation reactions, even in the presence of CO2. However, the pore structure can undergo minor changes, such as slight decreases in specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter, indicating some structural degradation.

4. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts are enhanced by the presence of high-valent chromium species. These species are stabilized as Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+. The in situ UVvis DR results show that Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly to Cr3+ and Cr2+ states at the beginning of the process, contributing to the high catalytic activity. The key challenge is to maintain a high dispersion of these species while avoiding the formation of inactive Cr species or pore structure collapse.

1. 不同的支撑材料和反应条件影响了在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性以及机制途径。例如，二氧化碳的存在激活了丙烯形成的一个额外的氧化路径。在重整反应中，二氧化碳的形成速率随着催化剂中可还原铬物种浓度的增加而上升。催化剂失活的主要原因是丙烷脱氢反应过程中焦炭的形成。

2. 在优化铬氧化物催化剂整体性能时面临的挑战包括平衡不同支撑材料和反应条件下活性、选择性和稳定性的平衡。需要权衡最大化丙烯生产活性与维持多个周期内的稳定性，尤其是在存在二氧化碳时可能导致焦炭形成并导致催化剂失活的情况。

3. 催化剂的稳定性受到支持材料孔结构的影响。例如，像SBA-1这样的多孔材料在存在二氧化碳的情况下表现出良好的稳定性。然而，孔结构可能会经历轻微的变化，如特定表面积、孔体积和平均孔直径的小幅下降，表明存在一定程度的结构降解。

4. 提高催化剂活性和选择性的关键在于存在高电荷的铬物种。这些物种被稳定为Cr6+、分散的Cr5+和聚集的Cr3+。原位UVvis DR结果表明，在过程初期Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+状态，这促进了高催化活性。关键挑战是保持这些物种的高分散性，同时避免形成无活性的Cr物种或孔结构塌陷。

1. The various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance involve balancing factors such as the dispersion of chromium species, the presence of high-valent chromium species, and the ability to reduce these species effectively. The trade-off often involves finding the optimal balance between the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst.

2. The activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the support materials and reaction conditions. For instance, the dispersion of chromium species on the support surface affects the reactivity of the catalyst. High-valent chromium species, like Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+, play crucial roles in the catalytic activity. The stability of the catalyst is affected by the formation of coke, which can lead to irreversible deactivation. Optimizing these factors requires careful selection of support materials and adjustment of reaction conditions to maintain high activity and selectivity while ensuring the stability of the catalyst.

3. The activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials increases with the increasing number of high-valent chromium species. This is because high-valent chromium species, such as Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+, are involved in the redox cycles that drive the catalytic activity. These species facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, especially in the presence of CO2.

4. The partial deactivation of the catalysts is primarily due to the excessive formation of coke. This results in a decrease in the catalytic activity over time. The coke formation leads to a loss of active sites and a reduction in the overall efficiency of the catalyst. Understanding and controlling coke formation is crucial for maintaining the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 不同的支撑材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2以及反应条件，包括CO2分压，影响了在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性以及其机制路径。优化这些催化剂整体性能的关键挑战和权衡因素涉及平衡诸如铬物种的分散性、高电荷铬物种的存在以及有效还原这些物种的能力。需要权衡的因素通常包括维持催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性的最佳平衡。

2. 在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性受到支撑材料和反应条件的影响。例如，支持表面上的铬物种的分散性影响了催化剂的反应性。高电荷的铬物种，如Cr6+、分散的Cr5+和聚集的Cr3+，在催化活性中起着关键作用。催化剂的稳定性受到焦炭形成的负面影响，这会导致不可逆失活。通过仔细选择支撑材料并调整反应条件来保持高活性和选择性的同时确保催化剂的稳定性是优化这些催化剂性能的关键。

3. Crx/SBA-1材料的活性随着高电荷铬物种数量的增加而提高。这是因为高电荷铬物种，如Cr6+、分散的Cr5+和聚集的Cr3+，参与了驱动催化活性的红ox循环。这些物种促进了轻烷烃的氧化脱氢，尤其是在存在二氧化碳的情况下。

4. 催化剂的部分失活主要是由于过量形成焦炭导致的。这导致催化剂活性随时间逐渐下降。焦炭的形成导致活性位点的损失，并减少了催化剂的整体效率。理解并控制焦炭的形成对于维持二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的性能至关重要。

[1] "The results of the in situ UVvis DR measurements obtained during the first 10 min on-stream led to a conclusion that in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the Cr6+ species play a similar role as in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation, i.e. they are the precursors of dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit high activity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
