[1] "Mesoporous cubic Crx/SBA-1 catalysts containing well-dispersed chromium species in a wide range of Cr loadings were prepared by simple incipient wetness impregnation."
[2] "In the calcined catalysts chromium species are stabilized as Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+ species."
[3] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."
[4] "As a result, the catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials rises together with the increasing number of high-valent Cr species."
[5] "The observed partial deactivation of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by excessive coke formation."

1. Various support materials and reaction conditions affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Factors like CO2 partial pressure, temperature, and catalyst loading can optimize these aspects. Challenges include balancing activity and selectivity, managing coke formation, and maintaining catalyst stability over multiple cycles.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions typically exhibit Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+. Below 7 wt.% of Cr, Cr6+ species dominate. Above 7 wt.%, both Cr6+ and agglomerated Cr3+ species, often in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist.

3. The catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials increases with the number of high-valent Cr species. The activity is primarily driven by the presence of Cr6+ species, which reduce to Cr2+ and Cr3+ species during the process.

4. Partial deactivation of the catalysts is attributed to excessive coke formation. Coke formation can be quantified and managed through optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst design.

5. The activity of chromium oxide catalysts is influenced by the support material's properties, such as surface area, porosity, and the dispersion of chromium species. Reaction conditions, including temperature, CO2 partial pressure, and feed composition, also play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance. Trade-offs exist between activity, selectivity, and stability, requiring careful optimization of these factors for optimal performance.

1. 不同的支持材料和反应条件会影响铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径。因素如二氧化碳分压、温度和催化剂负载可以优化这些方面。挑战包括平衡活性和选择性，管理焦炭形成，并在多个周期内保持催化剂稳定性。

2. 在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，铬氧化物催化剂通常包含Cr6+物种、分散的Cr5+和聚集的Cr3+。在低于7 wt.%的Cr下，Cr6+物种占据主导地位。超过7 wt.%，Cr6+和聚集的Cr3+物种，常以结晶态a-Cr2O3的形式存在，同时共存。

3. 铬x/SBA-1材料的催化活性随高电荷Cr物种的数量增加而提高。活性主要由Cr6+物种驱动，在过程中，Cr6+物种还原为Cr2+和Cr3+物种。

4. 催化剂的部分失活归因于过量的焦炭形成。可以通过优化反应条件和催化剂设计来量化和管理焦炭形成。

5. 铬氧化物催化剂的活性受到支持材料性质的影响，如表面面积、孔隙率和铬物种的分散度。反应条件，包括温度、二氧化碳分压和进料组成，也对催化剂性能起着关键作用。需要仔细优化这些因素以达到最佳性能之间的平衡。
