[1] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for coupling of methane,5 dehydrogena- tion of ethylbenzene6 or propane.7 However, the role of CO2 in these reactions is still not clear."
[2] "The activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was twice that in the absence of CO2."
[3] "Dehydrogenation of C2H6 was strongly inhibited when Ga2O3 was impregnated onto a basic oxide such as MgO or La2O3."
[4] "With CO2 considerable amounts of CO and H2O were formed during the reaction, indicating reaction of CO2 with H2."
[5] "Dehydrogenation of ethane would be catalyzed by acid sites on Ga2O3."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in various reactions, including methane coupling, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, and propane dehydrogenation, is not well understood. In the case of Ga2O3 catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation, the presence of CO2 significantly enhances activity, increasing the yield of ethene by approximately 100%. The dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3 is inhibited when the catalyst is loaded onto basic oxides like MgO or La2O3. CO2 reacts with hydrogen (H2) during the reaction, forming CO and water (H2O). The dehydrogenation of ethane is catalyzed by acidic sites present on Ga2O3.

在甲烷耦合、乙苯脱氢和丙烷脱氢等反应中，二氧化碳（CO2）的作用尚不明确。对于以Ga2O3为催化剂的乙烷脱氢过程，CO2的存在显著提高了活性，使乙烯产率增加了约100%。当Ga2O3负载到MgO或La2O3等碱性氧化物上时，乙烷脱氢作用受到抑制。CO2与氢（H2）反应形成CO和水（H2O）。乙烷的脱氢作用是由Ga2O3上的酸性位点催化完成的。
