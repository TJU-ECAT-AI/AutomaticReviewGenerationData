1. Various support materials such as MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, TiO2, V2O5, Cr2O3, Mn3O4, Fe3O4, ZnO, Ga2O3, Y2O3, ZrO2, Nb2O5, MoO3, In2O3, SnO2, La2O3, CeO2, Ta2O5, and Tl2O3 were used as catalysts. The order of their activity at a reaction temperature of 650°C was: Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO > La2O3. Reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure influenced the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance involved balancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts under different conditions.

2. Dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3 catalysts in the presence of CO2 primarily produced ethene (C2H4), along with CO, H2, and H2O. The CO2 had a pronounced promoting effect on the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3 catalysts. In comparison, the effect of CO2 on the yield of ethane with V2O5 was slightly detrimental. The role of CO2 in dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3 catalysts was unclear, but it was noted that considerable amounts of CO and H2O were formed, suggesting that CO2 might react with H2 and enhance the acidity of the Ga2O3 surface.

1.X公司使用了包括MgO、Al2O3、SiO2、CaO、TiO2、V2O5、Cr2O3、Mn3O4、Fe3O4、ZnO、Ga2O3、Y2O3、ZrO2、Nb2O5、MoO3、In2O3、SnO2、La2O3、CeO2、Ta2O5和Tl2O3在内的各种支持材料作为催化剂。在650°C的反应温度下，它们的活性顺序为：Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO > La2O3。反应条件，包括CO2的分压，影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。优化其整体性能的关键挑战和权衡涉及在不同条件下平衡催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。

2. 在Ga2O3催化剂的存在下，乙烷在CO2的环境中主要生成乙烯（C2H4），同时还会产生CO、H2和H2O。CO2对Ga2O3催化剂上的乙烷脱氢作用有显著促进效果。相比之下，CO2对V2O5中乙烷的产量略有负面影响。CO2在Ga2O3催化剂上的脱氢作用机制尚不明确，但已知在反应过程中会产生大量的CO和H2O，这表明CO2可能与H2反应并增强Ga2O3表面的酸性。
