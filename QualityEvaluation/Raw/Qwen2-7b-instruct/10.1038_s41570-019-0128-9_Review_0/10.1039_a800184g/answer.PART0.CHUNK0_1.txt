[1] "Ethene is predominantly produced by steam cracking of naphtha, ethane or liquid petroleum gas at high temperatures at short residence time."
[2] "In order to reduce energy consumption of ethene production, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is proposed [eqn. (1)]."
[3] "Recently, a great variety of catalysts have been developed and tested for this reaction."
[4] "Here, we study the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over several metal oxide catalysts, and we have found that CO2 markedly promoted dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3 catalyst."
[5] "The catalysts used were commercially available MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, TiO2, V2O5, Cr2O3, Mn3O4, Fe3O4, ZnO, Ga2O3, Y2O3, ZrO2, Nb2O5, MoO3, In2O3, SnO2, La2O3, CeO2, Ta2O5 and Tl2O3."
[6] "The C2H4 selectivities in all the metal oxide catalysts were > 85% in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2."
[7] "Dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3 catalyst produced mainly C2H4, CO, H2 and H2O."
[8] "The promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 on Cr2O3/SiO2 has been reported,5 but the increase in the propene yield was only 2.6% at 550 C."
[9] "With CO2 considerable amounts of CO and H2O were formed during the reaction, indicating reaction of CO2 with H2."
[10] "Dehydrogenation of ethane would be catalyzed by acid sites on Ga2O3."

1. The document discusses the use of various metal oxide catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene, with a focus on the role of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant. It highlights the effectiveness of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) in this process, yielding 18.6% ethene with a selectivity of 94.5%.

2. The study involved testing a range of catalysts, including MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, TiO2, V2O5, Cr2O3, Mn3O4, Fe3O4, ZnO, Ga2O3, Y2O3, ZrO2, Nb2O5, MoO3, In2O3, SnO2, La2O3, CeO2, Ta2O5, and Tl2O3, in the dehydrogenation of ethane under CO2 conditions.

3. The presence of CO2 significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3 catalyst, resulting in a higher yield of ethene compared to the absence of CO2.

4. The selectivity for ethene production was greater than 85% across all metal oxide catalysts when ethane was dehydrogenated in the presence of CO2.

5. When CO2 was present, the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3 catalyst led to the formation of primarily ethene, along with CO, H2, and H2O.

6. The study reports that the effect of CO2 on the yield of ethene in the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) on Cr2O3/SiO2 resulted in a 2.6% increase in propene yield at 550°C, demonstrating a lesser impact compared to its role in enhancing the ethene yield from ethane.

7. CO2 reacted with hydrogen (H2) during the reaction, producing CO and H2O, which influenced the dehydrogenation process.

8. The document suggests that the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3 is catalyzed by acid sites on the catalyst surface, indicating the importance of acidic sites in the conversion process.

9. The study was supported by the Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research (C) from the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture in Japan, highlighting the governmental funding behind the research.

10. The researchers are grateful for their research assistantship from the High Technology Research Center, Kansai University, acknowledging the institutional support.
