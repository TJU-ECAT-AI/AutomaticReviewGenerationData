[1] "Dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over gallium oxide in the presence of carbon dioxide gives 18.6% ethene yield with a selectivity of 94.5%."
[2] "Ethene is predominantly produced by steam cracking of naphtha, ethane or liquid petroleum gas at high temperatures at short residence time."
[3] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, Burch and Crabb pointed out that thermal non-catalytic oxidative cracking of propane proceeded to give propene in the same yield as compared to catalyzed runs which were operated about 50 C lower than that of non-catalyzed runs."
[4] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for coupling of methane, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene or propane."
[5] "Fig. 1 shows ethene yields on the various metal oxide catalysts."
[6] "Table 1 lists ethene yields on Ga2O3, Cr2O3, and V2O5 catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2."
[7] "The activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was twice that in the absence of CO2."
[8] "To our knowledge, such a marked promotion effect of CO2 in a hydrocarbon conversion process has never been previously observed."

The various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 do not significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, based on the provided document. The reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, play a crucial role in affecting these properties. For instance, the presence of CO2 markedly promotes the dehydrogenation of ethane over gallium oxide catalysts. However, the specific impact of different support materials on chromium oxide catalysts is not clearly discussed in the document. The key challenge in optimizing the overall performance of these catalysts lies in finding the right balance between activity, selectivity, stability, and cost-effectiveness. The trade-off often involves selecting the appropriate catalyst material and optimizing its preparation conditions to achieve optimal performance under given reaction conditions.

提供的文档中并未明确讨论各种支持材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径的影响。反应条件，尤其是二氧化碳分压，对这些性质有重要影响。例如，二氧化碳的存在显著促进了镓氧化物催化剂上乙烷的脱氢反应。然而，不同支持材料对铬氧化物催化剂的具体影响并未在文档中清晰阐述。优化这些催化剂整体性能的关键挑战在于找到活动性、选择性、稳定性和成本效益之间的平衡。这一过程往往涉及选择合适的催化剂材料并优化其制备条件，以在给定反应条件下实现最佳性能。
