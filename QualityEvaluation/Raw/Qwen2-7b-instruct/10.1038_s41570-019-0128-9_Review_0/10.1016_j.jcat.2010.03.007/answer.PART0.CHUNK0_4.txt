[1] "In continuation of our interest in exploring the applications of mixed oxides containing group III elements (Al, Ga and In) in propane dehydrogenation [25,26], herein, we report for the first time the use of InAl mixed oxide as a new efficient catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene."
[2] "In2O3 Al2O3 mixed oxides, previously established as an excellent system for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx owing to its unique low-temperature redox properties [3438], have shown to be particularly efficient for PDH in the presence of CO2."
[3] "Our results have shown that the creation and maintenance of the catalytically active metallic indium species in optimal surface concentration is indispensable for an efficient dehydrogenation of propane."

The use of InAl mixed oxide as a catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been explored. The In2O3 Al2O3 mixed oxides, known for their unique low-temperature redox properties in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx, exhibit high efficiency in propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. Maintaining the optimal surface concentration of catalytically active metallic indium species is crucial for an efficient dehydrogenation process.
