[1] "The superior performance of the Ga2O3Al2O3 system has been attributed to the formation of gallia-alumina solid solution between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 [26], which allows the favorable creation of a high abundance of coordinatively unsaturated surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity."
[2] "Our results have shown that the creation and maintenance of the catalytically active metallic indium species in optimal surface concentration is indispensable for an efficient dehydrogenation of propane."
