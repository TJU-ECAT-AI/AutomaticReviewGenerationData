The study investigates the use of In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in the presence of CO2. The research highlights the synergistic effect of different compositions on the catalytic performance. Through X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is found that the combination of In2O3 and Al2O3 components leads to modifications in the surface properties and bulk dispersion of the In2O3 phase, enhancing the reducibility of the InAlO composite. The creation of surface metallic indium species during the reaction is crucial for achieving high dehydrogenation performance. CO2 is shown to facilitate simple dehydrogenation by coupling with the reverse water gas shift reaction, contributing to the promotion of propylene yield.
