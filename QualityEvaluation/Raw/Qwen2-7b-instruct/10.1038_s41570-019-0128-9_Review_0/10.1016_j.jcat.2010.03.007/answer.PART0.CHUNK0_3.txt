[1] "Among all the studied catalysts, supported gallium oxides have recently been recognized as one of the most promising materials due to their excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to conventional Cr2O3- or Pt-based systems [7,2833]."
[2] "Very recently, we have demonstrated that Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides are highly active and stable catalysts for PDH in the presence of CO2 [25,26]."
[3] "Our results have shown that the creation and maintenance of the catalytically active metallic indium species in optimal surface concentration is indispensable for an efficient dehydrogenation of propane."
