[1] "Among them catalysis offers specific sites to activate CO2 for its chemical transformation."
[2] "This is a consequence of the modern life of mankind largely relying on burning or utilising carbon-based fossil fuels, which also causes their depletion."
[3] "There are several activation methods over catalyst surface reported to date and each method generally leads characteristic reactivity of CO2 and products due to the unique form of activated CO2 during transformation."
[4] "Going through the different activation methods and reaction intermediates and products, commonly observed reaction paths can be summarised (Figure5)."

Various support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 alter the surface properties and electronic structure of the catalysts, affecting their reactivity towards CO2. CO2 partial pressure, as a reaction condition, controls the extent of activation and the formation of intermediate species, impacting the selectivity towards target products. The key challenges in optimizing their overall performance include achieving a balance between high activity and selectivity, maintaining catalyst stability over multiple cycles, and enhancing the efficiency of CO2 conversion. Trade-offs might involve sacrificing selectivity for increased activity or vice versa, depending on the specific application requirements.
