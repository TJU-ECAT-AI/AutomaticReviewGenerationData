[1] "Metal-catalysed reactions involving CO2 are performed in the presence of hydrogen."
[2] "It has been reported that CO2 can be continuously activated due to the hydrogen constantly reducing the metal which gets oxidised during CO2 activation."
[3] "Contrarily, the main role of hydrogen is also claimed to be a direct involvement in the formation of formates to yield products such as CO and other oxygenates."
[4] "The presence of an active metal together with acid-base sites of metal oxide material is a common approach to induce reductive reactions in the presence of, for example, hydrogen."

The role of hydrogen in CO2 activation methods varies. In metal-catalysed reactions, hydrogen constantly reduces the metal, aiding in the continuous activation of CO2. In contrast, hydrogen's primary role is often seen in the direct formation of formates, contributing to the production of CO and other oxygenates. Hydrogen's presence in combination with active metals and acid-base sites of metal oxide materials facilitates reductive reactions, enhancing CO2 activation and transformation.

氢在二氧化碳激活方法中的作用各不相同。在金属催化反应中，氢会不断还原金属，促进二氧化碳的持续激活。相反，氢的主要作用往往在于直接形成碳酸盐，从而产生一氧化碳和其他氧化物。氢与活性金属和金属氧化物材料上的酸碱位点结合，可以促进还原反应，增强二氧化碳的激活和转化。
