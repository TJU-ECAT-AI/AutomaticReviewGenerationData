[1] "The reaction is mediated by a photocatalyst that harvests light and transforms the energy into a reactive form activating CO2 and other reactant(s)."
[2] "The surface properties and the number of electrons and protons that can be transferred will determine the product selectivity."
[3] "The most common referrals to the notion of acidity and basicity of solid materials are Brnsted (acid: proton donor, base: proton acceptor) and Lewis (acid: electron acceptor, base: electron donor) sites."
[4] "When CO2 is at the catalyst surface (e.g. adsorption), it can be activated via electron transfer (point 3), forming more reactive radical CO2, which can be further reacted with proton and other chemical species in vicinity."
[5] "Regardless of all the knowledge gained over the last years, CO2 photoconversion efficiency remains low. A suitable photocatalyst design is required to maximise light utilisation, retard electronhole recombination, and facilitate charge separation and migration."
