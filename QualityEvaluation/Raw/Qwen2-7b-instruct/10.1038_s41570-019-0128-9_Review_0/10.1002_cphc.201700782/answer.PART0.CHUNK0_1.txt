[1] "The presence of an active metal together with acid-base sites of metal oxide material is a common approach to induce reductive reactions in the presence of, for example, hydrogen."
[2] "The vast majority of the mechanistic studies have been performed on TiO2 with various co-catalysts, and several pathways have been proposed for the formation of CO, methanol and methane."
[3] "Regardless of all the knowledge gained over the last years, CO2 photoconversion efficiency remains low. A suitable photocatalyst design is required to maximise light utilisation, retard electronhole recombination, and facilitate charge separation and migration."
[4] "The metal type used as cathode (the electrode where reduction reaction takes place) has been known to define the specific path where CO2 reduction is driven."
[5] "Plasma-activated CO2 conversion is still in its infancy, much younger than other methods described in this article and requires greater efforts for its full exploitation."

How do various support materials and reaction conditions influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

The document discusses various aspects influencing the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Different support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, can alter the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of these catalysts. Reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, also play a crucial role. The presence of an active metal with acid-base sites in metal oxide materials facilitates reductive reactions when hydrogen is present. Mechanistic studies on TiO2 with co-catalysts have proposed pathways for CO, methanol, and methane formation. Improving photocatalyst design to maximize light utilization, retard electron-hole recombination, and facilitate charge separation and migration is essential for enhancing CO2 photoconversion efficiency. The choice of the metal type used as the cathode defines the specific path for CO2 reduction. Plasma activation, though promising, is in its early stages and requires further exploration. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing catalyst performance include balancing activity and selectivity, enhancing stability under reaction conditions, and finding efficient activation methods.
