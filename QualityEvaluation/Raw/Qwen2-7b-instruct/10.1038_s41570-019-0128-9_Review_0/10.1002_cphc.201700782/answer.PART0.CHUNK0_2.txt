[1] "CO2 is acknowledged as a mildly acidic molecule and it is attracted by the basic sites of solid surfaces, as evidenced by the intensive use of CO2 to probe the number and strength of basic sites by temperature programmed desorption of CO2 from a surface."
[2] "Increased degree of surface acidity can promote the linear configuration, whereas more basic metal oxides promote the formation of a bent and reactive CO2 on the surface due to the electron-donating character of the surface."
[3] "The forms (1) and (2) can be considered as the products through such activation over basic sites mainly consisting of surface oxygen atoms."
[4] "General understanding on how the reaction is driven towards a desired product is still in its infancy."

Regarding the influence of support materials and reaction conditions on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the literature provides insights into the role of various support materials and CO2 partial pressure. Silicon dioxide (SiO2), MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, aluminum oxide (Al2O3), zirconium oxide (ZrO2), and ceria (CeO2) are mentioned as support materials that can alter the catalyst's properties. The activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts are influenced by the support's surface area, acidity, and basicity. For instance, the acidity of the support can affect the formation of linear and bent configurations of CO2, impacting the reaction pathway. CO2 partial pressure, on the other hand, affects the rate of the reaction and the extent of CO2 conversion. However, the literature acknowledges that understanding the precise relationship between these factors and the catalyst's performance is still in its infancy. Key challenges include optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity, enhancing stability under reaction conditions, and developing a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the conversion pathways.
