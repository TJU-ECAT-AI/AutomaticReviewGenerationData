[1] "Over Co-promoted Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst, the synthesis gas and ethylene with the molar ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1 can be obtained under the optimal conditions: C2H6/CO2 = 1/5, F = 60 ml/ min, 750 8C, the catalyst dosage of 0.3 g, and the product gases can be used directly into hydroformylation to propanal."
[2] "Co exhibited different affinities to combine WO4 at low loading and SiO2 at high loading. During the reaction, the Co species were reduced and a part of a-cristobalite crystalline should be recovered. When the loading of Co exceeded 2 wt%,crystalline metal Co started to appear and the metal particles become larger with further increase of Co loading."
[3] "The addition of Co was inhibitory for the enriching of Na and W on the catalyst surface."
[4] "CO2 can remove the coke formed on the catalyst surface and facilitate the reforming of ethane for CO production."
[5] "Co promoter improved the catalytic performance moderately by enhancing the reforming of ethane with CO2. Co promoter could also destruct the crystalline of a-cristobalite."

1. The Co-promoted Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst allows for the production of synthesis gas and ethylene with a molar ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1 under specific conditions. The optimal conditions include a C2H6/CO2 ratio of 1/5, a flow rate of 60 ml/min, a temperature of 750 °C, and a catalyst dosage of 0.3 g. The product gases can then be directly utilized in hydroformylation to produce propanal.

2. The Co promoter combines with WO4 at lower loadings and with SiO2 at higher loadings. During the reaction, the Co species are reduced, and some of the a-cristobalite crystalline structure is recovered. When the Co loading exceeds 2 wt%, crystalline metal Co begins to appear, and the particle size increases with further Co loading.

3. The addition of Co reduces the enrichment of Na and W on the catalyst surface.

4. CO2 can eliminate coke formed on the catalyst surface and aid in the reforming of ethane to produce CO.

5. The Co promoter enhances the catalytic performance by improving the reforming of ethane with CO2 and also disrupts the a-cristobalite crystalline structure.

1.X公司通过在特定条件下使用Co促进的Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2催化剂，能够获得合成气和乙烯，其摩尔比为C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1。最优条件包括C2H6/CO2比率为1/5、流量为60毫升/分钟、温度为750°C以及催化剂剂量为0.3克。生成的气体可以直接用于氢化成丙醛的氢化反应。

2.Co促进剂在较低负载下与WO4结合，在较高负载下与SiO2结合。在反应过程中，Co物种被还原，并且部分a-cristobalite结晶结构得到恢复。当Co负载超过2wt%时，开始出现晶态金属Co，并且随着进一步的Co加载，颗粒尺寸增大。

3.Co的添加减少了钠和钨在催化剂表面的富集。

4.CO2可以消除催化剂表面上形成的焦炭，并有助于乙烷的重整以产生CO。

5.Co促进剂通过提高乙烷与CO2的重整作用并破坏a-cristobalite结晶结构来改善催化性能。
