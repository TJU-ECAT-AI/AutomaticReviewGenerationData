[1] "The catalytic conversions of light alkanes to corresponding alkenes are investigated extensively for its energy-saving character."
[2] "Ethylene, as an important intermediate, is mainly produced by steam cracking of hydrocarbons. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) is a promising route for ethylene production."
[3] "Many researches [17] proved that several metal oxides, such as gallium oxide, chromium oxide, vanadium oxide, molybdenum oxide and nickel oxide were effective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[4] "Compared to O2, CO2 possesses several advantages, because CO2 can act as a medium for heat supplying and maintain the catalyst life by removing coke formed on the catalyst surface [8]."
[5] "We proposed a new strategy to convert ethane and CO2 to synthesis gas and ethylene in desired relative molar ratios (C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1)."

[8] "The conversions of C2H6 and CO2 were 50.5 and 9.0%, respectively, and the selectivity of C2H4 was 94.2%."
[9] "When the loading of Co exceeded 4 wt%, the surface concentration of Co increased."
[10] "Over Co(12) catalyst, as compared to other catalysts, the conver- sions of C2H6 and CO2 were much higher, which reached 69.2 and 32.5%, respectively, while the selectivity and corresponding yield of C2H4 decreased to 56.6 and 39.2%, respectively."
[11] "It was found that the conversion of CO2 was relatively low. It might be attributed to the fact that CO2 was much more excessive than C2H6 under the above reaction condition (C2H6/CO2 = 1/5)."
[12] "The conversion of C2H6 increased from 55.6% (C2H6/CO2 = 1/5) and reached the maximum of 62.8% (C2H6/CO2 = 1/1) in the range of 1/5 to 1/1, and then decreased with further increase of C2H6/CO2."
[13] "Over Co(12) catalyst, the yield of C2H4 varied from 68.0% at the beginning to 54.0% in about 3 h and then kept almost the constant value of 52.0%."
