[1] "The catalytic conversions of light alkanes to corresponding alkenes are investigated extensively for its energy-saving character."
[2] "Ethylene, as an important intermediate, is mainly produced by steam cracking of hydrocarbons. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) is a promising route for ethylene production."
[3] "Carbon dioxide, as a greenhouse gas, is a promising and mild oxidant for the dehydrogenation of ethane."
[4] "Compared to O2, CO2 possesses several advantages, because CO2 can act as a medium for heat supplying and maintain the catalyst life by removing coke formed on the catalyst surface."
[5] "In this paper, we proposed a new strategy to convert ethane and CO2 to synthesis gas and ethylene in desired relative molar ratios (C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1)."
[6] "Co-promoted Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalysts were prepared and used in the reaction of C2H6 with CO2."
[7] "The conversion of C2H6 (57.5%) and the selectivity of C2H4 (98.2%) in the blank experiment suggested that both the thermal cracking of C2H6 and the oxidative dehydrogenation by CO2 may occur readily in the absence of catalyst."
[8] "It was found that the conversion of C2H6 increased from 55.6% (C2H6/CO2 = 1/5) and reached the maximum of 62.8% (C2H6/CO2 = 1/1) in the range of 1/5 to 1/1, and then decreased with further increase of C2H6/CO2."
[9] "This might be due to that the increase of flow rate resulted in the decline of the contact time on the catalyst surface."
[10] "Over Co-promoted Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst, the synthesis gas and ethylene with the molar ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1 can be obtained under the optimal conditions: C2H6/CO2 = 1/5, F = 60 ml/ min, 750 °C, the catalyst dosage of 0.3 g, and the product gases can be used directly into hydroformylation to propanal."

The document discusses the use of a Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with carbon dioxide (CO2) as the oxidant. The catalyst system is effective in converting ethane and CO2 to synthesis gas and ethylene in desired molar ratios, specifically C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1. The CO2 is used as a mild oxidant due to its ability to supply heat and remove coke formed on the catalyst surface. The addition of cobalt (Co) to the Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst improves the catalytic activity, particularly in the reforming of ethane by CO2, leading to enhanced CO production. The conversion of ethane and CO2 increases with the addition of Co, and the optimal conditions for achieving the desired molar ratio of products are determined through experimentation. The catalyst system is suitable for direct use in hydroformylation processes to produce propanal.

本文讨论了使用Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2催化剂系统对乙烷（ODE）进行氧化脱氢，以二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂。该催化剂系统能够有效地将乙烷和CO2转化为所需摩尔比的合成气和乙烯，即C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1。由于CO2能够提供热量并清除催化剂表面形成的焦炭，因此将其用作温和的氧化剂。通过添加钴（Co）到Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2催化剂中，可以改善催化剂活性，特别是在CO2参与下裂解乙烷，从而增加CO的生成。随着Co的添加，乙烷和CO2的转化率提高，并通过实验确定了获得目标产物摩尔比的最佳条件。该催化剂系统适用于直接用于羟基化过程以生产丙醛。
