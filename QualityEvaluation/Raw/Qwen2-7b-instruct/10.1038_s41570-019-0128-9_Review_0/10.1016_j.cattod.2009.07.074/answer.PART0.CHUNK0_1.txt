[1] "Over Co-promoted Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst, the synthesis gas and ethylene with the molar ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1 can be obtained under the optimal conditions: C2H6/CO2 = 1/5, F = 60 ml/ min, 750 °C, the catalyst dosage of 0.3 g, and the product gases can be used directly into hydroformylation to propanal."
[2] "CO2 can remove the coke formed on the catalyst surface and facilitate the reforming of ethane for CO production."
[3] "During the reaction, the Co species were reduced and a part of a-cristobalite crystalline should be recovered."
[4] "The addition of Co was inhibitory for the enriching of Na and W on the catalyst surface."
[5] "Especially, when the loading exceeded 4 wt%, the peak intensity corresponding to metal Co increased obviously."

The Co-promoted Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst allows for the production of synthesis gas and ethylene with a molar ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1 under specific conditions: a C2H6/CO2 ratio of 1/5, a flow rate of 60 ml/min, a reaction temperature of 750 °C, and a catalyst dosage of 0.3 g. The CO2 can remove coke from the catalyst surface and promote ethane reforming for CO production. The Co species reduce and recover part of the a-cristobalite crystalline. Adding Co reduces the enrichment of Na and W on the catalyst surface. When the loading exceeds 4 wt%, the intensity of the metal Co peak increases significantly.

Co促进的Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2催化剂在特定条件下可以生成摩尔比为C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1的合成气和乙烯：C2H6与CO2的比例为1/5，流速为60ml/min，反应温度为750°C，催化剂剂量为0.3g。CO2可以去除催化剂表面的焦炭并促进乙烷的改性以生产CO。Co物种减少并恢复部分a-cristobalite结晶体。添加Co会抑制Na和W在催化剂表面的富集。当加载超过4 wt%时，金属Co对应的峰强度显著增加。
