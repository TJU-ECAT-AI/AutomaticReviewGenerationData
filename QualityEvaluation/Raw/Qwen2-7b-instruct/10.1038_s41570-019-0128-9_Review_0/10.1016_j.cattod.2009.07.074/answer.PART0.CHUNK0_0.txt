[1] "Over Co-promoted Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst, the synthesis gas and ethylene with the molar ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1 can be obtained under the optimal conditions: C2H6/CO2 = 1/5, F = 60 ml/ min, 750 °C, the catalyst dosage of 0.3 g, and the product gases can be used directly into hydroformylation to propanal."
[2] "Especially, when the loading of Co exceeded 2 wt%, crystalline metal Co started to appear and the metal particles become larger with further increase of Co loading."
[3] "The addition of Co was inhibitory for the enriching of Na and W on the catalyst surface."
[4] "CO2 can remove the coke formed on the catalyst surface and facilitate the reforming of ethane for CO production."
[5] "During the reaction, the Co species were reduced and a part of a-cristobalite crystalline should be recovered."
[6] "The addition of Co promoter improved the catalytic performance moderately by enhancing the reforming of ethane with CO2."

1. Under specific conditions (C2H6/CO2 = 1/5, F = 60 ml/ min, 750 °C, catalyst dosage of 0.3 g), the Co-promoted Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst enables the production of synthesis gas and ethylene with a molar ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1, which can be directly utilized in hydroformylation to propanal.
2. When the loading of Co exceeds 2 wt%, crystalline metal Co starts to appear, and the size of metal particles increases with further Co loading.
3. The addition of Co reduces the enrichment of Na and W on the catalyst surface.
4. CO2 assists in removing coke formed on the catalyst surface and promoting the reforming of ethane to produce CO.
5. During the reaction, the Co species are reduced, and part of the a-cristobalite crystalline is recovered.
6. The inclusion of Co promoter moderately enhances the catalytic performance by improving the reforming of ethane with CO2.

1. 在特定条件下（C2H6/CO2 = 1/5，F = 60 ml/ min，750 °C，催化剂剂量为0.3 g），Co促进的Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2催化剂可以生成C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1的合成气和乙烯，并可以直接用于丙酮的氢化形成。
2. 当Co的负载超过2 wt%时，结晶态金属Co开始出现，并且随着进一步的Co加载，金属颗粒增大。
3. 添加Co减少了表面Na和W的富集。
4. CO2有助于清除催化剂表面上形成的焦炭并促进乙烷的改性以产生CO。
5. 反应过程中，Co物种被还原，并且部分a-cristobalite结晶逐渐恢复。
6. Co促进剂的添加通过增强乙烷与CO2的改性而适度提高了催化性能。
