<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Co-promoted Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst allows for the production of synthesis gas and ethylene with a molar ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1 under specific conditions: a C2H6/CO2 ratio of 1/5, a flow rate of 60 ml/min, a reaction temperature of 750 °C, and a catalyst dosage of 0.3 g. The CO2 can remove coke from the catalyst surface and promote ethane reforming for CO production. The Co species reduce and recover part of the a-cristobalite crystalline. Adding Co reduces the enrichment of Na and W on the catalyst surface. When the loading exceeds 4 wt%, the intensity of the metal Co peak increases significantly.

The document discusses the use of a Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with carbon dioxide (CO2) as the oxidant. The catalyst system is effective in converting ethane and CO2 to synthesis gas and ethylene in desired molar ratios, specifically C2H4/CO/H2 = 1/1/1. The CO2 is used as a mild oxidant due to its ability to supply heat and remove coke formed on the catalyst surface. The addition of cobalt (Co) to the Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst improves the catalytic activity, particularly in the reforming of ethane by CO2, leading to enhanced CO production. The conversion of ethane and CO2 increases with the addition of Co, and the optimal conditions for achieving the desired molar ratio of products are determined through experimentation. The catalyst system is suitable for direct use in hydroformylation processes to produce propanal.
