The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation.

Various support materials such as SiO2, Al2O3, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Among these, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed specific promoting effects when exposed to CO2. These effects led to an enhancement in the yield of C3H6 and suppression of catalyst deactivation. However, the document does not provide comprehensive details on how different materials and conditions specifically impact the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it discuss the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance.

各种支持材料，如SiO2、Al2O3、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2以及反应条件，包括CO2分压，影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径。其中，SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂在暴露于CO2时表现出特定的促进效果。这些效应导致了C3H6产率的提高和催化剂失活的抑制。然而，该文献没有详细说明不同材料和条件如何具体影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的性能，也没有讨论优化其整体性能的关键挑战和权衡。
