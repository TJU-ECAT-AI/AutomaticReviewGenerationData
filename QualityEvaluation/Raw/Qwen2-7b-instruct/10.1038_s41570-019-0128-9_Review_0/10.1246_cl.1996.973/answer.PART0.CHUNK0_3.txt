"The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."
"Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."
"The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

Various support materials such as SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, along with different reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Among these, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed unique promoting effects from CO2, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance involve balancing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability while navigating the complex interactions between the support material, reactants, and reaction conditions. Further research is needed to understand the detailed mechanisms and to develop more efficient catalysts for CO2 utilization.
