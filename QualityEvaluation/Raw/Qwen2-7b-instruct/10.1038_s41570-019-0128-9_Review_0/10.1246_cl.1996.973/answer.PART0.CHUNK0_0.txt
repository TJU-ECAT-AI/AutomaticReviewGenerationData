[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."
[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

The study investigates the impact of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propene over various chromium oxide catalysts supported on different materials. The results show that carbon dioxide has a promoting effect only on SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts. This effect enhances the yield of propene and reduces catalyst deactivation.
