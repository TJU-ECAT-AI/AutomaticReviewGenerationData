[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."
[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

Various support materials, including SiO2, Al2O3, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions differently. Specifically, carbon dioxide showed a promoting effect only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The trade-off lies in optimizing these properties for better overall performance, which requires careful selection of materials and conditions.

各种支持材料，如SiO2、Al2O3、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2，在CO2氧化脱氢反应中对铬氧化催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径有不同的影响。具体而言，二氧化碳仅在SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂上表现出促进作用，提高了C3H6的产率并抑制了催化剂的失活。优化这些性能以获得更好的整体性能需要仔细选择材料和条件。存在的权衡在于平衡这些特性，以实现最佳的整体表现。
