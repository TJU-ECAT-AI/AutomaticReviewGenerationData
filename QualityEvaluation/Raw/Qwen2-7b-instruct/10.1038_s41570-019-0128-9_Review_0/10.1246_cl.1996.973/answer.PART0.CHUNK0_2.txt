The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation.
Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst.

The study found that carbon dioxide had a promoting effect on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation. However, this effect was not observed on other types of catalyst supports such as Al2O3, active carbon, and Cr2O3 alone.
