[1] "The most active catalyst tested was Cr/H-ZSM-5 SiO2=Al2O3  1900 (No. 1)."
[2] "The order of activity (conversion of ethane and yield of ethylene) of the H-ZSM-5 support was Cr=H-ZSM-51900 > Cr=H-ZSM-5190 Cr=H-ZSM-590 > Cr=H-ZSM-529."
[3] "Smaller W =F ratios gave lower yields and higher selectivities, and the rate of formation of ethylene increased with decreasing W =F ."
[4] "The maximum rate of formation of ethylene was 0:516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1 at 923 K, which is 2.54 times faster than the rates previously reported for the Cr=SiO2 [2] and Ga=TiO2 [4] catalysts."
[5] "When Ar co-feed gas is used, the main reason for the deactivation is assumed to be coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
[6] "The H2 consumption peak between 623 and 873 K can be assigned not to a Cr(III) species but to a high oxidation state Cr species, such as Cr(VI) [7], which may be the key to the higher dehydrogenation activity."

The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by various factors including the type of support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure). The key findings from the literature suggest that:

1. Different support materials significantly impact the catalyst's performance. For instance, the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 190 in Cr/H-ZSM-5 was found to be particularly effective in accelerating the dehydrogenation process compared to other catalysts with different ratios. The H-ZSM-5 support showed varying levels of activity depending on its SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, indicating that the structure of the support plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's efficiency.

2. Reaction conditions, particularly the partial pressure of CO2, influence the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Lowering the weight-to-flow rate (W/F) ratio resulted in lower yields but higher selectivities, suggesting that controlling the reaction conditions can optimize the catalyst's performance.

3. The maximum rate of ethylene formation was observed to be 0.516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1 at 923 K, demonstrating that the Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are highly efficient in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation. This rate is notably faster than previously reported for other catalysts, highlighting the effectiveness of the Cr/H-ZSM-5 system.

4. The presence of coke deposition on the catalyst surface was identified as the main cause of deactivation when using Ar as a co-feed gas, whereas CO2 co-feed gas was found to accelerate the dehydrogenation process and maintain catalyst activity by removing coke from the surface.

5. TPR profiles indicated the presence of high oxidation state Cr species, possibly Cr(VI), which likely contribute to the higher dehydrogenation activity. These species may play a critical role in the catalytic mechanism.

These findings reveal the complex interplay between support materials, reaction conditions, and mechanistic pathways that affect the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Optimizing these factors requires careful consideration to achieve desired levels of activity, selectivity, and stability.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，铬氧化催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和催化机制途径受到多种因素的影响，包括支持材料类型（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）和反应条件（包括CO2分压）。文献中的关键发现表明：

1. 不同的支持材料显著影响催化剂的性能。例如，Cr/H-ZSM-5的SiO2/Al2O3比为190的催化剂在加速脱氢过程方面特别有效，与具有不同比例的其他催化剂相比。H-ZSM-5支持的活性根据其SiO2/Al2O3比变化，表明支持结构对催化剂效率起着关键作用。

2. 反应条件，特别是CO2分压，影响催化剂的活性和选择性。降低重量与流率比（W/F）导致较低的产率但更高的选择性，表明通过控制反应条件可以优化催化剂的性能。

3. 观察到的最大乙烯形成速率是0.516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1在923 K下，这证明了Cr/H-ZSM-5催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢中的高效性。该速率明显快于之前报道的其他催化剂，突显出Cr/H-ZSM-5系统的有效性。

4. 当使用Ar作为共流气体时，观察到的主要原因是催化剂表面沉积焦炭导致催化剂失活，而CO2共流气体被发现在加速脱氢过程并维持催化剂活性，通过从表面去除焦炭来实现这一点。

5. TPR谱图表明存在高氧化态Cr物种，可能为Cr(VI)，这可能有助于较高的脱氢活性。这些物种可能在催化机制中发挥关键作用。

这些发现揭示了支持材料、反应条件和催化机制之间错综复杂的相互作用，影响铬氧化催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能。为了达到所需的活性、选择性和稳定性水平，需要仔细考虑这些因素进行优化。
