Various support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. High activity was observed with Cr/H-ZSM-5 SiO2=Al2O3 P 190 catalyst. CO2 co-feed gas accelerates dehydrogenation and maintains catalyst activity by removing coke. TPR profiles indicate that high oxidation state Cr species are key factors in catalyst performance. Challenges and trade-offs involve balancing catalyst stability, selectivity, and activity under different conditions. Optimization requires careful consideration of these parameters.
