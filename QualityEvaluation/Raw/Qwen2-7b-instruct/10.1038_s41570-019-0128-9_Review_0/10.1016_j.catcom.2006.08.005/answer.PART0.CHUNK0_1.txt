Mesoporous silica-supported chromium catalyst: Characterization and excellent performance in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide Licheng Liu a,b, Huiquan Li a,*, Yi Zhang a a Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O. Box 353, Beijing 100080, PR China b Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China Received 27 April 2006; received in revised form 4 August 2006; accepted 4 August 2006 Available online 12 August 2006

The experimental section describes the synthesis of the MSU-x support and the preparation of Cr/MSU-x catalysts. The synthesis involves mixing sodium silicate with fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether under vigorous stirring, followed by adjusting the pH with hydrochloric acid. The as-synthesized MSU-x is then calcined to remove the template, and the catalyst is prepared by impregnating Cr(NO3)3 aqueous solution onto the support. The characterization section discusses the use of X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopy, and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) techniques to study the structure and active sites of the catalysts.

The results and discussion section presents the catalytic behavior of the Cr/MSU-x catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide. It includes the conversion of propane, selectivity of propylene, and yield of propylene as a function of temperature, as well as the effects of chromium loading on these parameters. The comparison of the Cr/MSU-x catalyst with other typical catalysts in the literature is also provided.

Various support materials, such as mesoporous silica (MSU-x), influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The choice of support material affects the surface area, pore size distribution, and the ability to host the active metal species. In this study, mesoporous silica was found to be effective in supporting chromium oxide for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide. The activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst were optimized through careful control of the chromium loading and synthesis conditions. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include balancing the degree of chromium oxidation state, the extent of mesopore preservation, and the catalyst's resistance to deactivation over time. The results highlight the potential of mesoporous silica-supported chromium catalysts for efficient CO2 utilization in the production of propylene and other valuable chemicals.
