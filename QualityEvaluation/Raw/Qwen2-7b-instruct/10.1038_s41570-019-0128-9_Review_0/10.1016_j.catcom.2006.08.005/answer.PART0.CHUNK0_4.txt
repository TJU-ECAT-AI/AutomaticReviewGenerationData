[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques."
[2] "Excellent results in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selectivity, were obtained."
[3] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."
[4] "The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed."

The use of nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x as a support for chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) showed significant improvements in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide. These catalysts demonstrated high activity, achieving 36.8% propane conversion with 89.1% propylene selectivity. The formation of chromium species with higher oxidation states upon lower chromium loading and the presence of bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystals at higher loading were noted. The active sites of the catalysts and the role of mesoporous MSU-x in enhancing their performance were also explored.
