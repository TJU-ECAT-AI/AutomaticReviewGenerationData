Mesoporous silica-supported chromium catalyst: Characterization and excellent performance in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide Licheng Liu a,b, Huiquan Li a,*, Yi Zhang a a Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O. Box 353, Beijing 100080, PR China b Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China Received 27 April 2006; received in revised form 4 August 2006; accepted 4 August 2006 Available online 12 August 2006 Abstract Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques. Excellent results in dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec- tivity, were obtained. Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the important and basic chemicals used in industrial processes, such as synthesis of polypro- pylene, crylic acid, acrylonitrile, and cumene. Recently,the demand for propylene has increased significantly; how- ever, to this day, most propylene (>90%) is produced as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes in refinery in industries worldwide. Many efforts have been made to catalyze oxidehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using oxygen; unfortunately, no break- through has been made [14]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen. The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages. First, thermody- namic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 !
CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxi- dant. Many researchers have investigated the dehydrogena- tion of propane in the presence of CO2, suggesting that chromium and gallium oxide are active components for this reaction [511].
Mesoporous silicate materials, which possess unparal- leled high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels,are expected to be new promising catalyst support [12]. In this paper, mesoporous silica supported chromium catalyst was prepared and designated as Cr/MSU-x. MSU-x is an important family of mesoporous material, which holds 3D wormlike channels favoring diffusion of molecular objects [13]. Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited good activity in the ODH of ethane with CO2 according to our previous study [14]. The catalysts exhibit excellent activity in the dehydro- genation of propane with CO2.

2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis
The MSU-x support was synthesized as follows: 110 g/L Na2SiO3  9H2O aqueous solution was mixed with 0.1 mol/ L fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (A(EO)9) aqueous solution with molar ratio 1Si:0.1 A(EO)9 under vigorous stirring. The silicate polycondensation to a white precipi- tate occurred by adding 1 mol/L aqueous HCl to adjust pH value of the mixed solution from 1213 to 23. After being stirred for 24 h, the resulting solid gel was separated by filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 C overnight. The as-synthesized MSU-x was calcined under static air at 600 C for 4 h to remove template. The calcined MSU-x was impregnated with desired Cr(NO3)3 aqueous solution to prepare Cr/MSU-x catalysts. Cr/ MSU-x catalyst was also calcined at 600 C for 4 h before reaction. Four catalysts with different Cr loading (calcu- lated by Cr2O3) of 1 wt%, 5 wt%, 12 wt%, and 20 wt%,respectively, were prepared.
2.2. Characterizations
The reaction of CO2 and C3H8 was performed at atmo- spheric pressure in a fixed bed quartz reactor (5.0 mm i.d.,
44.0 cm long). The reactants consisted of V(CO2) = 9 ml/
min and V(C3H8) = 3 ml/min. Catalyst loading was 0.2 g.
The products were analyzed online by a gas chromatograph equipped with paropark-QS column (3 m, U1/4) and a ther- mal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC 14B). The pro- pane conversion and products selectivity were calculated based on Eqs. (1) and (2) [6]. The conversion of propane to coke was neglected because the instantaneous formation of coke is time dependent and difficult to estimate.

10.075 s for regions at 0.56.0, scanning step size 0.017
and step time 5.08 s for regions at 1090. Diffuse reflec- tance UVvis spectroscopic measurements were recorded on a UV2100 spectrometer. The spectra were collected at 230700 nm referenced to BaSO4. H2-TPR of catalysts was performed on CHEMBET3000 chemical adsorption apparatus from Quantachrome by using a mixture of 5 vol% H2/Ar as reducing gas with a total flow rate 20 ml/min. A 50 mg sample was heated from room temper- ature to 700 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min after pre- treatment at 300 C for 30 min in helium gas flow. The reduction signal was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The reducing gas was cooled by mixture of n-octane and liquid nitrogen to condense the water gen- erated from reduction of the catalyst.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Meso-structure and activities of catalysts
The blank MSU-x gives one broad peak at low angle region corresponding to d1 0 0 reflection in XRD pattern (Fig.1a), indicating that the presence of uniform mesopor- ous channels [15]. Chromium supported Cr/MSU-x show one similar
XRD
peak as blank MSU-x at about 2h = 2. Moreover, the surface area and pore diameter of blank MSU-x and 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x that have been mea- sured though N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms as
963.6, 964.6 m2/g and 2.57, 2.64 nm in our previous study
show no obvious difference [14]. These results suggest that meso-structure of MSU-x is preserved after loading of chromium oxide (Cr2O3). It is noticed that the reflection intensity of Cr/MSU-x reduces with the increasing of Cr2O3 loading (Fig. 1be). More Cr2O3 introduction into the material results in losing integrity and order of meso- structure. Similar result was observed on Co-MCM-41 by Li et al. [16].
The catalytic behaviors of 5 wt% Cr2O3/MSU-x in pro- pane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2 are shown in Table 1. Reaction network of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 is very complicated. However, due to the higher selectivity of C3H6 in product, the following reactions are considered as main reactions [5,6,11]:
C3H8 ! C3H6  H2

CO2  H2 ! CO  H2O

Propylene comes from two ways by reactions (3) and (5).
Several side reactions include reforming and hydrocracking of propane:
C3H8  3CO2 ! 6CO  4H2

7
C3H8  2H2 ! 3CH4
8 The dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2 is similar as the results of propane and will not be discussed.
Conversion of propane increased as the reaction tempera- ture was raised, whereas selectivity of propylene, the object product, decreased. The main byproduct, methane, was generated from hydrocracking reaction (8) with selectivities of 5.99.5%. Ethane and ethylene are two other byproducts resulting from cracking or dehydrogenation reactions with selectivities of less than 5% always.
The catalytic activities of Cr/MSU-x that varied with Cr2O3 loading are shown in Fig. 2. The conversion of pro- pane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propyl- ene still acquire elevation. Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about 89%. Table 2 summarizes the activities of some typical cat- alysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, includ- ing catalysts cited from literatures and the 12 wt% Cr/ MSU-x prepared for this study. Although reaction condi- tions are different, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher pro- pane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table.
The results show that Cr/MSU-x is a very active catalyst for this reaction. Fig. 3 exhibits the catalytic activities of 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x as a function of reaction time. Conver- sion of propane and CO2 decreased gradually with time Table 1 Catalytic performance of 5 wt% Cr2O3/MSU-x in the propane dehydro- genation to propylene with CO2
