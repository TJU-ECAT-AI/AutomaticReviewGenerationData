1. The study presents the preparation and characterization of chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica, specifically MSU-x. The catalysts demonstrate excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide, achieving a 36.8% conversion of propane with 89.1% selectivity for propylene. The study explores the effects of chromium loading on the catalyst's structure and activity.

2. The conversion of propane increases with an increase in reaction temperature, while the selectivity for propylene decreases. The maximum propane conversion and propylene yield are achieved at a chromium loading of 5 wt% to 12 wt%, followed by a slight decrease. Despite a decline in propylene selectivity, the yield of propylene remains elevated.

3. The Cr/MSU-x catalysts exhibit higher propane conversion compared to other catalysts listed in the table, despite differing reaction conditions.

4. The study reports that the Cr/MSU-x catalysts are highly active in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The conversion of propane and carbon dioxide decreases gradually over time.

1. 研究介绍了在介孔二氧化硅（MSU-x）上支持的铬氧化物催化剂的制备和表征。这些催化剂在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯与二氧化碳反应中表现出优异性能，实现了36.8%的丙烷转化率和89.1%的丙烯选择性。研究探讨了铬负载对催化剂结构和活性的影响。

2. 随着反应温度的升高，丙烷的转化率增加，而丙烯的选择性降低。在5 wt%到12 wt%的铬负载范围内，可以获得最大丙烷转化率和丙烯产率，随后略有下降。尽管丙烯选择性有所下降，但丙烯的产率仍然很高。

3. Cr/MSU-x 催化剂在不同的反应条件下，与列出的其他催化剂相比，显示出更高的丙烷转化率。

4. 研究报告称，Cr/MSU-x 催化剂在丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢反应中具有高度活性。随着反应时间的推移，丙烷和二氧化碳的转化率逐渐降低。
