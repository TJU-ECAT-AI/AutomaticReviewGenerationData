Mesoporous silica-supported chromium catalyst: Characterization and excellent performance in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide Licheng Liu a,b, Huiquan Li a,*, Yi Zhang a a Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O. Box 353, Beijing 100080, PR China b Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China Received 27 April 2006; received in revised form 4 August 2006; accepted 4 August 2006 Available online 12 August 2006 Abstract Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques. Excellent results in dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec- tivity, were obtained. Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
