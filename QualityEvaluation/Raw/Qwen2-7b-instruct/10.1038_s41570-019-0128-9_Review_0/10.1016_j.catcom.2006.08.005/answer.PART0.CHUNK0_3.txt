[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques."
[2] "Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited good activity in the ODH of ethane with CO2 according to our previous study [14]."
[3] "The catalytic activities of Cr/MSU-x that varied with Cr2O3 loading are shown in Fig. 2. The conversion of propane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%."
[4] "Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly."
[5] "Although reaction conditions are different, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher propane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table."
[6] "Fig. 3 exhibits the catalytic activities of 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x as a function of reaction time. Conversion of propane and CO2 decreased gradually with time."

The document discusses the preparation and characterization of chromium oxide catalysts supported on nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The catalysts show enhanced activity compared to other catalysts listed in the table. The conversion of propane and CO2 increases with chromium loading before reaching 5 wt%, and the highest propane conversion and propylene yield are achieved between 5 wt% and 12 wt% chromium loading. The stability of the catalysts decreases with time, as indicated by the gradual decrease in conversion of propane and CO2 in Figure 3.

本文讨论了非有序介孔分子筛MSU-x支持的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的制备和表征。该催化剂与表格中列出的其他催化剂相比表现出增强的活性。随着铬负载量的增加，丙烷和二氧化碳的转化率增加，在达到5 wt%之前。在5 wt%至12 wt%的铬负载范围内，获得最高丙烷转化率和丙烯产量。催化剂的稳定性随时间下降，如图3所示，丙烷和二氧化碳的转化率逐渐降低。
