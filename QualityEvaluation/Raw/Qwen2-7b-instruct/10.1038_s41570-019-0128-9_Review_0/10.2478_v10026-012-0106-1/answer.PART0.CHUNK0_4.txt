[1] "The goal of the present work was to discuss the pos- sibilities of the application of the primary products of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 other than propene,based on thermodynamic considerations and catalytic tests."
[2] "Several differ- ent pathways of DHP-CO2 process integration with commercialized chemical processes utilized synthesis gas were proposed."
[3] "Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion
and propene yield increase with the increase of reac- tion temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases."
[4] "Moreover, the effect of tempera- ture on the CO/H2 value varies with the initial composition of feed gas."
[5] "Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to redu- ced propane conversion."

1. The aim of the research was to explore the potential uses of propane dehydrogenation products other than propene, considering thermodynamics and catalytic testing. 
2. Various integration pathways for the DHP-CO2 process with existing chemical processes that utilize synthesis gas were suggested.
3. As the reaction temperature increased, both propane conversion and propene yield increased, but the selectivity towards propene decreased.
4. The impact of temperature on the CO/H2 ratio varied depending on the initial composition of the feed gas.
5. The adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 could limit propane adsorption on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst surface, resulting in decreased propane conversion.
