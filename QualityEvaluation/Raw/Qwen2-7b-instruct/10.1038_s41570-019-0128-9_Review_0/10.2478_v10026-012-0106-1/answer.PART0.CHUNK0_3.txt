<p>Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 was considered as an alternative to commercial dehydrogenation pathway of obtaining propene and the new sources of synthesis gas.</p>
<p>CO2 may participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (reaction 3) that is an additional way of propene formation as well as in coke gasification (reaction 4) that enhances the catalyst stability.</p>
<p>The additional useful (from chemical point of view) product of DHP-CO2 is CO that is formed in reactions 24. This compound separately or together with H2 produced in reaction 1 (CO + H2  synthesis gas) has many applications.</p>
<p>By controlling CO2 concentration in the feed, the molar ratio of H2/CO (synthesis gas) in the products mixture can be regulated.</p>
<p>Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation technique from an aqueous solution of Cr(NO3)3.</p>
<p>The interaction of CO2 with the surface of the supports and catalysts was probed by FTIR spectroscopy.</p>
<p>Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion and propene yield increase with the increase of reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases.</p>
<p>Over both catalysts, in the investigated narrow range of temperature, the ratios of CO/H2 are changed slightly.</p>
<p>Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2  in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield.</p>
<p>Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion.</p>
<p>The goal of the present work was to discuss the pos- sibilities of the application of the primary products of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 other than propene,based on thermodynamic considerations and catalytic tests.</p>

The document discusses how various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document highlights the role of CO2 in enhancing propene yield through its participation in reactions involving propane, CO2, and hydrogen. The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance involve balancing the effects of CO2 concentration on the molar ratio of H2/CO in the synthesis gas, adjusting the catalyst type and preparation method, and managing the impact of CO2 on propane conversion rates. The document also addresses the importance of controlling reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, to optimize the performance of chromium oxide catalysts. The document suggests that the use of chromium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 offers an alternative pathway for propene production and the generation of synthesis gas, with the ability to regulate the synthesis gas composition based on CO2 concentration in the feed.
