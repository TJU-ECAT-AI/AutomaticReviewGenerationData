[1] "In the new process with CO2 the yield of propene is higher than in the traditional ones."
[2] "This promoting effect of CO2 is due to its participation in the following reaction (24):"
[3] "It is generally accepted that one of the most important roles of CO2 in the DH-CO2 is consumption of hydrogen that is produced in the thermodynamically limited DHP reaction."
[4] "Several different pathways of DHP-CO2 process integration with commercialized chemical processes utilized synthesis gas were proposed."
[5] "The thermodynamic considerations indicate that the temperature has much smaller effect on the equilibrium molar ratio of CO/H2."
[6] "Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2 in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield."
[7] "Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion."
[8] "The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfavorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3."

1. The presence of CO2 in the process increases the yield of propene compared to traditional methods. This is because CO2 participates in reactions that consume hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP).

2. CO2's role in the DHP-CO2 process includes consuming hydrogen produced during the DHP reaction. This is crucial for enhancing propene yield.

3. The DHP-CO2 process can be integrated with various commercial chemical processes that use synthesis gas as a substrate. This integration allows for the utilization of CO and hydrogen produced during the process.

4. Controlling the temperature has a minimal impact on the equilibrium molar ratio of CO/H2 in the DHP-CO2 process.

5. Even a small amount of CO2 in the feed can significantly reduce propene yield over a commercially used Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst.

6. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 reduces the surface availability for propane, leading to decreased propane conversion over Cr-O/Al2O3 catalysts.

7. The unfavorable effect of CO2 on propene yield over Cr-O/Al2O3 catalysts can be attributed to the specific properties of γ-Al2O3.

<p>Propane conversion, hydrocarbons yields and propene selectivity were calculated as reported previously8.</p>
<p>Moreover, the effect of CO2 on the yield of propene depends strongly on the catalyst nature.</p>
<p>Our previous catalytic experiments and literature results reveal that the catalysts which are active and selective in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes exhibit also good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2.</p>
<p>Cr-O/SiO2 carbon dioxide exerts a promoting effect on the yield of propene.</p>
<p>However, the positive effect of CO2 observed over Cr-O/SiO2 is much smaller than the negative effect exerted on the catalytic performances of Cr-O/Al2O3.</p>
<p>Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion.</p>
<p>Such great differences in the effects of CO2 are probably caused by the difference in supports nature.</p>
<p>The thermodynamic calculations for the simplified model and the catalytic tests indicate that the synthesis gas composition (molar ratio of CO/H2) can be controlled easily by changing the molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 in the feed.</p>
<p>The goal of the present work was to discuss the possibilities of the application of the primary products of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 other than propene, based on thermodynamic considerations and catalytic tests.</p>

The various support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The choice of support material can lead to contrasting effects on the catalyst's performance. For instance, chromium oxide supported on SiO2 tends to promote the yield of propene, whereas the same catalyst supported on Al2O3 shows an unfavorable effect. The adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 reduces the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to decreased propane conversion. These differences are attributed to the distinct properties of the support materials. Thermodynamic calculations and catalytic tests demonstrate that by adjusting the molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 in the feed, the synthesis gas composition, specifically the molar ratio of CO/H2, can be easily controlled. The goal of the research is to explore the potential applications of the primary products of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 beyond propene production, considering the thermodynamic and catalytic tests conducted.

各种支持材料和反应条件对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径产生显著影响。不同支持材料的选择可能导致催化剂性能的对比效果。例如，硅酸盐支持的铬氧化物倾向于促进丙烯的产率，而同一种催化剂在氧化铝上的表现则相反。二氧化碳在γ-Al2O3上的吸附减少了丙烷在Cr-O/Al2O3催化剂表面的吸附可能性，导致丙烷转化率降低。这些差异归因于支持材料的不同性质。热力学计算和催化测试表明，通过调整喂料中CO2:C3H8的摩尔比，可以轻松控制合成气组成，尤其是CO/H2的摩尔比。研究的目标是探索丙烷与二氧化碳共脱氢过程的主要产品（除了丙烯）在其他应用领域的可能性，考虑到进行的热力学和催化测试。
