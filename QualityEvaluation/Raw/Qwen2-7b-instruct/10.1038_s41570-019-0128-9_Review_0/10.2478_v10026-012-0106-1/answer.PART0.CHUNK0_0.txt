[1] "In the new process with CO2 the yield of propene is higher than in the traditional ones."
[2] "This promoting effect of CO2 is due to its participation in the following reaction (24):"
[3] "It is generally accepted that one of the most important roles of CO2 in the DH-CO2 is consumption of hydrogen that is produced in the thermodynamically limited DHP reaction."
[4] "Several different pathways of DHP-CO2 process integration with commercialized chemical processes utilized synthesis gas were proposed."
[5] "The thermodynamic considerations indicate that the temperature has much smaller effect on the equilibrium molar ratio of CO/H2."
[6] "Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2 in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield."
[7] "Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion."
[8] "The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfavorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3."

1. The presence of CO2 in the process increases the yield of propene compared to traditional methods. This is because CO2 participates in reactions that consume hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP).

2. CO2's role in the DHP-CO2 process includes consuming hydrogen produced during the DHP reaction. This is crucial for enhancing propene yield.

3. The DHP-CO2 process can be integrated with various commercial chemical processes that use synthesis gas as a substrate. This integration allows for the utilization of CO and hydrogen produced during the process.

4. Controlling the temperature has a minimal impact on the equilibrium molar ratio of CO/H2 in the DHP-CO2 process.

5. Even a small amount of CO2 in the feed can significantly reduce propene yield over a commercially used Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst.

6. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 reduces the surface availability for propane, leading to decreased propane conversion over Cr-O/Al2O3 catalysts.

7. The unfavorable effect of CO2 on propene yield over Cr-O/Al2O3 catalysts can be attributed to the specific properties of γ-Al2O3.

1. 在新过程中，二氧化碳的存在提高了丙烯的产率，与传统方法相比。这是因为二氧化碳参与了消耗在丙烷脱氢（DHP）反应中产生的氢气的反应。

2. 二氧化碳在DHP-CO2过程中的作用包括消耗DHP反应中产生的氢气。这是提高丙烯产率的关键。

3. DHP-CO2过程可以与使用合成气作为基质的多种商业化化学过程集成。这种集成允许利用脱氢过程期间产生的CO和氢。

4. 温度对DHP-CO2过程中的平衡CO/H2摩尔比的影响很小。

5. 即使是微量的二氧化碳在流体中也能显著降低使用商业Cr-O/Al2O3催化剂的丙烷脱氢过程中的丙烯产率。

6. 二氧化碳在γ-Al2O3上的吸附减少了表面的丙烷可用性，导致使用Cr-O/Al2O3催化剂的丙烷转化率降低。

7. 二氧化碳对Cr-O/Al2O3催化剂上丙烯产率的不利影响可归因于γ-Al2O3的特定性质。
