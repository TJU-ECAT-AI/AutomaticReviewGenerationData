<p>Miller and Alberini (2016) review recent estimates of the price elasticity of residential electricity demand, finding that they cover a wide range (from 0, which means that the demand is completely inelastic, to 2), but that the bulk of the estimates suggest a relatively low elasticity.</p>
<p>In other cases, the price (whether marginal or average) is endogenous with the quantity consumed. This is the case with two-part tariffs and block pricing, two price schemes commonly used with electricity and gas.</p>

<p>Fact 1. When possible, suppliers will get around rules and regulations Sallee and Slemrod (2012) study the automakers response to the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1993, which credits vehicles with flex-fuel capability (i.e., equipped to run on both gasoline and E85, an ethanol-gasoline mix) with two thirds more than the miles-per-gallon fuel economy they actually achieve.</p>
<p>Fact 2: Manufacturers will raise price of energy-efficient products if they can Houde (2014a, b) examines the Energy Star certification awarded to appliances by the US EPA and DoE.

1. The price elasticity of residential electricity demand varies widely, from 0 (completely inelastic) to 2, with the majority suggesting a relatively low elasticity. When estimating demand functions, the choice between marginal and average price is crucial, as the former is suggested by theory, while the latter is influenced by the quantity consumed.

2. Automakers may circumvent rules and regulations, as seen in the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1993, where they exploited a loophole by selling flex-fuel vehicles at the same price as regular-fuel vehicles, despite the vehicles' capability to run on both gasoline and E85.

3. Manufacturers might increase the price of energy-efficient products if possible, as evidenced by the Energy Star certification, where appliance manufacturers sell products just meeting the Energy Star requirements at higher prices than comparable products that barely miss the criteria.

4. The Swiss fuel economy label, introduced in 2003, affects the prices of cars achieving the highest grade, with auto importers asking 5 to 11% more for these cars compared to similar cars that narrowly miss the A-grade criteria.

1. 居住用电需求的价格弹性范围广泛，从0（完全无弹性）到2不等，其中大多数估计表明弹性相对较低。在估计需求函数时，选择边际价格还是平均价格至关重要，前者符合理论建议，而后者受消费量的影响。

2. 在1993年的《替代燃料汽车法案》中，汽车制造商可能绕过规则和法规，通过以与标准汽油相同的售价出售既能使用汽油又能使用E85（一种乙醇和汽油混合物）的双燃料汽车来利用漏洞，尽管这些汽车实际上可以运行这两种燃料。

3. 如果可能，制造商可能会提高能效产品的价格，如能源之星认证所示，家电制造商将其产品（仅达到能源之星要求）的价格设定为比勉强未能达到A级标准的类似产品高5%至11%。

4. 自2003年以来引入的瑞士燃油经济性标签影响了获得最高级别的汽车价格，汽车进口商对这些汽车的定价比仅差一点就无法达到A级标准的类似汽车高出5%至11%。
