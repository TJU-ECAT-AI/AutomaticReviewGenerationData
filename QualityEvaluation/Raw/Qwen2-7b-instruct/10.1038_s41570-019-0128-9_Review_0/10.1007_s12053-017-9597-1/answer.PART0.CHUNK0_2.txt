[1] "Fact 1. When possible, suppliers will get around rules and regulations Sallee and Slemrod (2012) study the automakers response to the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1993, which credits vehicles with flex-fuel capability (i.e., equipped to run on both gasoline and E85, an ethanol-gasoline mix) with two thirds more than the miles-per-gallon fuel economy they actually achieve. They show that the US automakers did in fact exploit this loophole at very low cost to them."
[2] "Fact 2: Manufacturers will raise price of energy-efficient products if they can Houde (2014a, b) examines the Energy Star certification awarded to appliances by the US EPA and DoE. Houde provides evidence that appliance manufacturers bunch at efficiency rates that just barely meet the Energy Star requirements and take advantage of consumers by charging higher prices for those appliances."

The automotive industry may circumvent regulations and standards, such as the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1993, by exploiting loopholes that allow them to receive credits for vehicles with flex-fuel capability without actually achieving the required fuel economy. Similarly, manufacturers of energy-efficient products like appliances may strategically set their products' efficiency ratings just above the minimum required for certifications such as Energy Star, thereby charging higher prices to consumers without significantly improving the product's efficiency.

汽车制造商可能会利用漏洞规避法规和标准，例如1993年的替代燃料法案，通过为具有双燃料能力的车辆获得信用而无需实际达到要求的燃油经济性。同样，家电制造商可能会将产品的效率评级设置在接近能源之星认证所需的最低要求之上，从而向消费者收取更高的价格，而无需显著提高产品的效率。
