<p>Miller and Alberini (2016) review recent estimates of the price elasticity of residential electricity demand, finding that they cover a wide range (from 0, which means that the demand is completely inelastic, to 2), but that the bulk of the estimates suggest a relatively low elasticity.</p>
<p>In other cases, the price (whether marginal or average) is endogenous with the quantity consumed. This is the case with two-part tariffs and block pricing, two price schemes commonly used with electricity and gas.</p>
<p>Chetty et al. (2009) explore the notion of salience, namely what parts of a price change or tax is meaningful to and noticed by people.</p>
<p>Another example of salience is provided by Gallagher and Muehlegger (2011) who examine the impact of incentives offered in different forms on hybrid vehicle purchases.</p>
<p>Response stickiness There are a number of reasons why policies that seek to alter the excise tax of fuels and energy inputs are not always successful, or do not elicit immediate response.</p>
<p>Many observers believe that if people received their energy bill more frequently and information about usage and prices were displayed more clearly, this would help avoid wastage and reduce consumption through conservation or the purchase of more energy-efficient appliances.</p>
<p>The notion that providing instant feedback can help household self-regulate electricity and gas consumption is relied upon, among others, by the European Union, which calls for smart meter installation based on an analysis of the benefits and costs associated with their usage.</p>
<p>Farouqui et al. (2010) survey studies that have examined how in-home displays can help people keep track of their consumption of electricity and reduce it.</p>
<p>Finally, much attention has been paid to the effect of norms on consumption.</p>

The price elasticity of residential electricity demand varies widely, ranging from 0 (indicating completely inelastic demand) to 2, with the majority of estimates suggesting a relatively low elasticity. Prices can be endogenous to the quantity consumed, particularly in cases of two-part tariffs and block pricing. Salience plays a role in how individuals perceive price changes or taxes. Different forms of incentives for hybrid vehicle purchases can have varying impacts on sales, with salient incentives like sales tax rebates having a significantly larger effect than less transparent options like income tax credits. Policies attempting to alter excise taxes on fuels and energy inputs may not always succeed due to response stickiness, which can be attributed to factors such as habit formation theory. Increased frequency of energy bills and clearer information about usage and pricing can aid in reducing wastage and promoting conservation. Smart meter installations, advocated by the European Union, can assist in household self-regulation of electricity and gas consumption. In-home displays have been studied for their ability to help users monitor and reduce consumption. Norms and peer comparison can influence consumption patterns, leading to temporary reductions when individuals are informed about their usage relative to others. The rebound effect, which erodes the efficiency gains from energy efficiency upgrades, has a range of effects, with the most credible range being 10% to 30%. Studies examining the demand for vehicle miles traveled (VMT) have found that people respond more to changes in fuel economy than to changes in fuel prices, leading to a rebound effect estimated at 20% to 40%. These findings suggest that energy efficiency policies can face challenges in achieving their intended outcomes due to consumer behavior, pricing mechanisms, and the complexity of energy demand dynamics.

住宅用电需求的价格弹性范围广泛，从0（表示完全无弹性）到2不等，大多数估计表明弹性相对较低。价格可能是与消费量相关的内生变量，特别是在两部分计费和分段定价的情况下。价格变化或税收的显著性影响了个人的感知。对于混合动力车辆购买的不同形式激励措施可以产生不同的销售效果，明显的激励措施如销售税退税比透明度较低的税收抵免（如所得税减免）具有更大的影响。试图改变燃料和能源输入的消费税政策可能并不总是成功，或者不会立即引发反应，这可能归因于响应粘性，这可以归因于习惯形成理论等因素。增加能源账单的频率和更清晰地提供使用和定价信息可以帮助减少浪费并促进节能。欧洲联盟倡导的智能电表安装基于其对使用相关利益和成本的分析，可以协助家庭自我调节电力和燃气消费。已研究了在家中的显示器如何帮助用户监控和减少消费。规范和同行比较可以影响消费模式，导致当人们了解到自己的使用情况与其他人的关系时，临时减少消费。反弹效应，即能源效率升级带来的效率提升被削弱，范围在38%-7%，但最可信的范围是10%-30%。研究车辆行驶里程（VMT）的需求发现，人们更倾向于响应燃油经济性的变化而不是燃油价格的变化，导致反弹效应估计为20%-40%。这些发现表明，由于消费者行为、定价机制和能源需求动态的复杂性，能源效率政策可能会面临实现其预期目标的挑战。

1. The price elasticity of residential electricity demand varies widely, from 0 (completely inelastic) to 2, with the majority suggesting a relatively low elasticity. When estimating demand functions, the choice between marginal and average price is crucial, as the former is suggested by theory, while the latter is influenced by the quantity consumed.

2. Automakers may circumvent rules and regulations, as seen in the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1993, where they exploited a loophole by selling flex-fuel vehicles at the same price as regular-fuel vehicles, despite the vehicles' capability to run on both gasoline and E85.

3. Manufacturers might increase the price of energy-efficient products if possible, as evidenced by the Energy Star certification, where appliance manufacturers sell products just meeting the Energy Star requirements at higher prices than comparable products that barely miss the criteria.

4. The Swiss fuel economy label, introduced in 2003, affects the prices of cars achieving the highest grade, with auto importers asking 5 to 11% more for these cars compared to similar cars that narrowly miss the A-grade criteria.

1. 居住用电需求的价格弹性范围广泛，从0（完全无弹性）到2不等，其中大多数估计表明弹性相对较低。在估计需求函数时，选择边际价格还是平均价格至关重要，前者符合理论建议，而后者受消费量的影响。

2. 在1993年的《替代燃料汽车法案》中，汽车制造商可能绕过规则和法规，通过以与标准汽油相同的售价出售既能使用汽油又能使用E85（一种乙醇和汽油混合物）的双燃料汽车来利用漏洞，尽管这些汽车实际上可以运行这两种燃料。

3. 如果可能，制造商可能会提高能效产品的价格，如能源之星认证所示，家电制造商将其产品（仅达到能源之星要求）的价格设定为比勉强未能达到A级标准的类似产品高5%至11%。

4. 自2003年以来引入的瑞士燃油经济性标签影响了获得最高级别的汽车价格，汽车进口商对这些汽车的定价比仅差一点就无法达到A级标准的类似汽车高出5%至11%。

The automotive industry may circumvent regulations and standards, such as the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1993, by exploiting loopholes that allow them to receive credits for vehicles with flex-fuel capability without actually achieving the required fuel economy. Similarly, manufacturers of energy-efficient products like appliances may strategically set their products' efficiency ratings just above the minimum required for certifications such as Energy Star, thereby charging higher prices to consumers without significantly improving the product's efficiency.

1. The bulk of recent estimates of the price elasticity of residential electricity demand suggest a relatively low elasticity, ranging from 0 to 2, indicating that demand is somewhat responsive to price changes.

2. The price elasticity of demand for electricity can be influenced by various factors, such as the type of tariff structure (two-part tariffs, block pricing), leading to endogenous price with the quantity consumed.

3. People's awareness of price changes or taxes varies significantly, affecting their responsiveness to such economic signals. For instance, a study by Chetty et al. (2009) showed that explicit reminders about taxes can influence consumer behavior.

4. Markets may not immediately react to changes in gasoline prices, as evidenced by a study by Allcott and Wozny (2014), which found a delay of up to 6 months in car markets.

5. In-home displays have been shown to assist in tracking electricity consumption and potentially reducing usage, according to a survey by Faruqui et al. (2010).

6. Frondel and Vance (2013) utilized a specific dataset to identify the rebound effect in vehicle kilometers traveled (VMT) during periods of decreasing gasoline prices.

7. Linn (2013) estimated the demand for vehicle miles traveled using a single cross-section of households, considering the impact of gasoline and diesel fuel prices.

8. Automakers may circumvent rules and regulations by exploiting loopholes, as demonstrated by Sallee and Slemrod (2012) in their study of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act.

9. Appliance manufacturers may bunch at efficiency rates just below the Energy Star requirements and charge higher prices for those appliances, as Houde (2014a, b) observed.

10. The Swiss fuel economy label led to a premium of 5 to 11% for cars that qualified for the A grade, compared to similar cars that narrowly missed the grade, according to Alberini et al. (2016a).

1. 近期对居民用电需求的价格弹性估计显示，需求相对价格变化的弹性较低，范围从0到2，表明需求对价格变化有一定响应性。

2. 电价弹性受不同计费结构（两部分计费、分段定价）的影响，导致价格与消费量相互依存。

3. 人们对于价格变化或税收的敏感度存在显著差异，影响其对经济信号的响应。例如，Chetty等人（2009）的研究表明，明确提醒消费者关于税费可以改变消费者行为。

4. 燃油价格变动后，汽车市场可能需要长达6个月的时间才能做出反应，Allcott和Wozny（2014）的研究对此进行了说明。

5. 在家用显示器的帮助下，人们可以跟踪电力消耗并减少使用，根据Faruqui等人的调查（2010）。

6. Frondel和Vance（2013）利用特定数据集，在汽油价格下降期间识别了车辆行驶里程的反弹效应。

7. Linn（2013）通过美国家庭交通调查中的单一横截面样本，估计了车辆行驶里程的需求，并考虑了汽油和柴油燃料价格的影响。

8. 汽车制造商可能会利用规则漏洞，如Sallee和Slemrod（2012）在研究替代燃料法案时所观察到的那样，规避法规。

9. 家电制造商可能在接近能源之星要求的效率等级处聚集，并为这些电器收取更高的价格，Houde（2014a, b）的研究揭示了这一现象。

10. 瑞士燃油经济标签导致获得A级评级的汽车比仅差一点未能获得该级别的汽车的价格高出5到11%，Alberini等人的研究表明。
