1. The bulk of recent estimates of the price elasticity of residential electricity demand suggest a relatively low elasticity, ranging from 0 to 2, indicating that demand is somewhat responsive to price changes.

2. The price elasticity of demand for electricity can be influenced by various factors, such as the type of tariff structure (two-part tariffs, block pricing), leading to endogenous price with the quantity consumed.

3. People's awareness of price changes or taxes varies significantly, affecting their responsiveness to such economic signals. For instance, a study by Chetty et al. (2009) showed that explicit reminders about taxes can influence consumer behavior.

4. Markets may not immediately react to changes in gasoline prices, as evidenced by a study by Allcott and Wozny (2014), which found a delay of up to 6 months in car markets.

5. In-home displays have been shown to assist in tracking electricity consumption and potentially reducing usage, according to a survey by Faruqui et al. (2010).

6. Frondel and Vance (2013) utilized a specific dataset to identify the rebound effect in vehicle kilometers traveled (VMT) during periods of decreasing gasoline prices.

7. Linn (2013) estimated the demand for vehicle miles traveled using a single cross-section of households, considering the impact of gasoline and diesel fuel prices.

8. Automakers may circumvent rules and regulations by exploiting loopholes, as demonstrated by Sallee and Slemrod (2012) in their study of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act.

9. Appliance manufacturers may bunch at efficiency rates just below the Energy Star requirements and charge higher prices for those appliances, as Houde (2014a, b) observed.

10. The Swiss fuel economy label led to a premium of 5 to 11% for cars that qualified for the A grade, compared to similar cars that narrowly missed the grade, according to Alberini et al. (2016a).

1. 近期对居民用电需求的价格弹性估计显示，需求相对价格变化的弹性较低，范围从0到2，表明需求对价格变化有一定响应性。

2. 电价弹性受不同计费结构（两部分计费、分段定价）的影响，导致价格与消费量相互依存。

3. 人们对于价格变化或税收的敏感度存在显著差异，影响其对经济信号的响应。例如，Chetty等人（2009）的研究表明，明确提醒消费者关于税费可以改变消费者行为。

4. 燃油价格变动后，汽车市场可能需要长达6个月的时间才能做出反应，Allcott和Wozny（2014）的研究对此进行了说明。

5. 在家用显示器的帮助下，人们可以跟踪电力消耗并减少使用，根据Faruqui等人的调查（2010）。

6. Frondel和Vance（2013）利用特定数据集，在汽油价格下降期间识别了车辆行驶里程的反弹效应。

7. Linn（2013）通过美国家庭交通调查中的单一横截面样本，估计了车辆行驶里程的需求，并考虑了汽油和柴油燃料价格的影响。

8. 汽车制造商可能会利用规则漏洞，如Sallee和Slemrod（2012）在研究替代燃料法案时所观察到的那样，规避法规。

9. 家电制造商可能在接近能源之星要求的效率等级处聚集，并为这些电器收取更高的价格，Houde（2014a, b）的研究揭示了这一现象。

10. 瑞士燃油经济标签导致获得A级评级的汽车比仅差一点未能获得该级别的汽车的价格高出5到11%，Alberini等人的研究表明。
