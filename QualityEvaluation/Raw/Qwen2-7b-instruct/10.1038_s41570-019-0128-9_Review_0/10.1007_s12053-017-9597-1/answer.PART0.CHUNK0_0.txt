<p>Miller and Alberini (2016) review recent estimates of the price elasticity of residential electricity demand, finding that they cover a wide range (from 0, which means that the demand is completely inelastic, to 2), but that the bulk of the estimates suggest a relatively low elasticity.</p>
<p>In other cases, the price (whether marginal or average) is endogenous with the quantity consumed. This is the case with two-part tariffs and block pricing, two price schemes commonly used with electricity and gas.</p>
<p>Chetty et al. (2009) explore the notion of salience, namely what parts of a price change or tax is meaningful to and noticed by people.</p>
<p>Another example of salience is provided by Gallagher and Muehlegger (2011) who examine the impact of incentives offered in different forms on hybrid vehicle purchases.</p>
<p>Response stickiness There are a number of reasons why policies that seek to alter the excise tax of fuels and energy inputs are not always successful, or do not elicit immediate response.</p>

<p>The notion that providing instant feedback can help household self-regulate electricity and gas consumption is relied upon, among others, by the European Union, which calls for smart meter installation based on an analysis of the benefits and costs associated with their usage.</p>

<p>Linn (2013) uses a single cross-section of households covered by the Household Transportation Survey in the USA, and estimates a demand for vehicle miles traveled (VMT), allowing for the VMT to respond differently to changes in the price of gasoline and diesel fuels.</p>

The price elasticity of residential electricity demand varies widely, ranging from 0 (indicating completely inelastic demand) to 2, with the majority of estimates suggesting a relatively low elasticity. Prices can be endogenous to the quantity consumed, particularly in cases of two-part tariffs and block pricing. Salience plays a role in how individuals perceive price changes or taxes. Different forms of incentives for hybrid vehicle purchases can have varying impacts on sales, with salient incentives like sales tax rebates having a significantly larger effect than less transparent options like income tax credits. Policies attempting to alter excise taxes on fuels and energy inputs may not always succeed due to response stickiness, which can be attributed to factors such as habit formation theory. Increased frequency of energy bills and clearer information about usage and pricing can aid in reducing wastage and promoting conservation. Smart meter installations, advocated by the European Union, can assist in household self-regulation of electricity and gas consumption. In-home displays have been studied for their ability to help users monitor and reduce consumption. Norms and peer comparison can influence consumption patterns, leading to temporary reductions when individuals are informed about their usage relative to others. The rebound effect, which erodes the efficiency gains from energy efficiency upgrades, has a range of effects, with the most credible range being 10% to 30%. Studies examining the demand for vehicle miles traveled (VMT) have found that people respond more to changes in fuel economy than to changes in fuel prices, leading to a rebound effect estimated at 20% to 40%. These findings suggest that energy efficiency policies can face challenges in achieving their intended outcomes due to consumer behavior, pricing mechanisms, and the complexity of energy demand dynamics.

住宅用电需求的价格弹性范围广泛，从0（表示完全无弹性）到2不等，大多数估计表明弹性相对较低。价格可能是与消费量相关的内生变量，特别是在两部分计费和分段定价的情况下。价格变化或税收的显著性影响了个人的感知。对于混合动力车辆购买的不同形式激励措施可以产生不同的销售效果，明显的激励措施如销售税退税比透明度较低的税收抵免（如所得税减免）具有更大的影响。试图改变燃料和能源输入的消费税政策可能并不总是成功，或者不会立即引发反应，这可能归因于响应粘性，这可以归因于习惯形成理论等因素。增加能源账单的频率和更清晰地提供使用和定价信息可以帮助减少浪费并促进节能。欧洲联盟倡导的智能电表安装基于其对使用相关利益和成本的分析，可以协助家庭自我调节电力和燃气消费。已研究了在家中的显示器如何帮助用户监控和减少消费。规范和同行比较可以影响消费模式，导致当人们了解到自己的使用情况与其他人的关系时，临时减少消费。反弹效应，即能源效率升级带来的效率提升被削弱，范围在38%-7%，但最可信的范围是10%-30%。研究车辆行驶里程（VMT）的需求发现，人们更倾向于响应燃油经济性的变化而不是燃油价格的变化，导致反弹效应估计为20%-40%。这些发现表明，由于消费者行为、定价机制和能源需求动态的复杂性，能源效率政策可能会面临实现其预期目标的挑战。
