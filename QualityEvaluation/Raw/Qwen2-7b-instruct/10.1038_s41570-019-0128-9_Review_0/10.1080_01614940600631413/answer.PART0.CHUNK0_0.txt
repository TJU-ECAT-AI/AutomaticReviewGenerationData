<p>The systems studied so far for ODH of light alkanes such as ethane, propane, n-butane, etc., can be approximately classified into three groups.</p>
<p>Oxidative Dehydrogenation of C2-C3 Alkanes 201 Downloaded by [Laurentian University] at 01:55 17 April 2013 Their characteristics and catalytic activity have already been analyzed in the literature (2, 710).</p>
<p>Alkali and Alkaline Earth-Based Catalysts The catalytic systems that contain ions and oxides of IA and IIA groups (e.g., Li2CO3/MgO) show selective behavior in this reaction (13), but the optimal temperature for these kinds of catalysts is high (above about 8708K).</p>
<p>The main effect of the chlorine ions is to generate ethyl radical species, and this effect is critical for achieving a high ethene yield (above 30%).</p>
<p>Several other catalytic systems have been proposed, such as LiCl/NiO (21, 22), LiTiO, and LiMnTiO (23).</p>
<p>For some, an improvement of the selectivity to ethene has been observed, but they do not show improvement in the ethene yield in comparison with the base system Li2CO3/MgO(Cl).</p>
<p>Several other catalytic systems have been proposed, such as LiCl/NiO (21, 22), LiTiO, and LiMnTiO (23).</p>

<p>The systems for ODH of propane (ODHP) can be divided into two groups: 1) vanadium-based systems (vanadates and vanadia dispersed on various oxides) and 2) molybdenum-containing catalysts (molybdates and supported MoO3).</p>
<p>It is well known that V2O5 is not a good catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, but the same vanadia supported on alumina or sepiolite gives a more selective catalyst (34, 35).</p>
<p>Smits et al. (4143) investigated the VNbO system, which exhibits good productivitiy to propene and apparently does not yield any oxygenated products.</p>
<p>Selectivity to propene was as high as 90% for low conversions of propane and the catalyst operated at relatively low temperatures (6537238K).</p>

The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by various factors including the type of support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure. The specific influence varies depending on the catalyst and the reaction conditions. For instance, the type of support can affect the surface area and pore structure, which in turn impacts the adsorption of reactants and products, influencing activity and selectivity. Reaction conditions, particularly the CO2 partial pressure, can affect the balance between the oxidative and dehydrogenative pathways, impacting the stability and overall performance of the catalyst. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their performance include finding the right balance between activity and selectivity, maintaining stability over multiple reaction cycles, and ensuring efficient conversion of CO2 to desired products. The specific effects of these factors on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions require detailed investigation through experimentation and modeling.

Answer: The type of support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Factors such as the support's surface area, pore structure, and the CO2 partial pressure impact the adsorption of reactants and products, affecting the catalyst's overall performance. Challenges include balancing activity and selectivity, maintaining stability over time, and achieving efficient CO2 conversion to desired products. Specific effects require detailed investigation through experimentation and modeling.
