The study found that the mixed oxides of chromium, cobalt, steel, and tungsten supported on aluminum oxide (CrCoSnW and CrMo) are promising catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The system of equations (17)-(20) describes the interactions and transformations of reactants A, B, and C on the surface. The kinetic model and reaction network for ethane oxidation was proposed by Oyama et al. based on experimental data.

[1] "The review has also demonstrated the effect of the support, metal oxide loading, and additive loading on catalytic properties."
[2] "It is evident that the rates of these five types of operations are dependent on different factors, in addition to the concentration or concentration gradients involved (88)."
[3] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps:"

The review showed that the support material, loading of metal oxides, and additive loading have significant effects on the catalytic properties. The rates of the five operational stages are influenced by multiple factors beyond concentration gradients. Based on the literature, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes appears to follow specific key steps.
