Many catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes can be grouped into three categories: alkali and alkaline earth-based catalysts, reducible transition metal oxides, and other catalysts such as B/P oxides, Ga/zeolite, LaF3/SmO, and Sn/P. Alkali and alkaline earth-based catalysts, especially those containing alkali metals, exhibit selective behavior in the ODH of ethane. Reducible transition metal oxides, like vanadium, molybdenum, and niobium, are active in oxidation at lower temperatures, typically around 473-838 K. For propane and butane, vanadium-based systems, such as vanadates and vanadia dispersed on various oxides, and molybdenum-containing catalysts, like molybdates and supported MoO3, are commonly used. The mechanisms of ODH reactions involve interactions of alkane with the catalyst surface, rupture of the C-H bond, reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen, and cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst. Kinetic models used for ODH of light alkanes include the Eley-Rideal model, Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, rake model, Mars-Van Krevelen model, and power law model. In the case of ethane, the selectivity to ethene increases with temperature, and at around 873 K, the rate constant of ethene oxidation becomes comparable to that of ethane oxidation. The kinetic models and reaction networks for the oxidation of ethane have been proposed based on experimental data.

目前，用于轻烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化剂可以大致分为三类：碱土金属和碱金属基催化剂、可还原过渡金属氧化物以及包括B/P氧化物、Ga/沸石、LaF3/SmO和Sn/P在内的其他催化剂。碱土金属和碱金属基催化剂，特别是含碱金属的催化剂，在乙烯的ODH中表现出选择性。可还原过渡金属氧化物，如钨、钼和铌，可以在较低温度下进行氧化反应，通常在473-838 K左右。对于丙烷和丁烷，以钨为基础的系统，如钨酸盐和分散在各种氧化物上的钨氧基，以及钼盐，如钼酸盐和支持的MoO3，是常用的催化剂。机制上，ODH反应涉及烷烃与催化剂表面的相互作用、C-H键的断裂、烷基物种与相邻表面氧的反应以及催化剂的周期性还原/氧化。用于轻烷烃氧化脱氢的热力学模型包括Eley-Rideal模型、Langmuir-Hinshelwood模型、耙模型、Mars-Van Krevelen模型和幂律模型。对于乙烷，随着温度的升高，乙烯的选择性增加，在大约873 K时，乙烯氧化的速率常数与乙烷氧化的速率常数相等。基于实验数据提出的乙烯氧化的热力学模型和反应网络。
