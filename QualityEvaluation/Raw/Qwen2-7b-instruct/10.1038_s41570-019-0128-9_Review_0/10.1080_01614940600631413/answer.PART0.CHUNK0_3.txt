1. Determining a molecular mechanism for a chemical reaction is a challenging task that necessitates the use of sophisticated experimental and computational methods.

2. For vanadium and molybdenum oxides, both monomeric and polymeric units can be considered active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. The terminal bond of the V(Mo)-O is not involved in the oxidation reactions.

3. Oyama et al. (104) presented a kinetic model and reaction network for the ethane oxidation based on experimental data.

How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?
