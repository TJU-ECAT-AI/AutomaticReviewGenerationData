[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
[2] "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[3] "Our research, then, looks in detail at the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 by CO2 as a potential prospect for CO2 utilisation in temperature and reaction conditions where the ultimate application of solar thermal energy may be a promising technology."
[4] "In reality, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is not a simple single reaction but a multiple reaction system, as shown in Table 2, mainly coupling the traditional dehydrogenation of C3H8 (reaction 1) and reverse water gas shift (reaction 2)."
