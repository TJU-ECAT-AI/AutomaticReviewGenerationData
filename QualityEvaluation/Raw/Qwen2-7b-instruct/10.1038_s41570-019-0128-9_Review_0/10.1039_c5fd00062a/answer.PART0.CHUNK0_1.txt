[1] "An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range."
[2] "The results revealed effective C3H8 conversions at each specified condition while the C3H6 selectivity drops at the beginning of reactions."
[3] "The high stability of the C3H8 conversion, as shown in Figure 7."

1. The potential of propane (C3H8) as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (ethane and butane, respectively) is significant from the perspectives of CO2 activation and coking resistance across the 300-500 temperature range. 
2. The catalytic tests showed effective conversions of propane under different conditions, although the selectivity of propane products initially decreased.
3. The stability of propane conversions was high during the catalytic tests, as depicted in Figure 7.
4. The peak at 2θ=36.18 corresponds to the 1-1-0 phase of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) with a rhombohedral crystal structure.
5. The weight loss starting from 200 degrees is attributed to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air.

1. 在300-500的温度范围内，丙烷（C3H8）相对于其更轻和更重的同系物（乙烷和丁烷）在CO2激活和结焦抵抗力方面具有显著潜力。
2. 催化测试显示，在不同条件下，丙烷的有效转化，而产物的选择性在反应初期有所下降。
3. 烷基转化的稳定性很高，在催化测试中得到体现，如图7所示。
4. 2θ=36.18处的峰对应于具有三斜晶系结构的氧化铬（Cr2O3）的1-1-0相。
5. 从200度开始的重量损失归因为空气中无定形碳的燃烧。
