          [1] "An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range."

          Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, impact these factors as well. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include balancing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, maintaining stability over time, and ensuring efficient conversion rates. The presence of CO2 aids in shifting the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction, but its effectiveness is limited. The optimization of catalyst performance requires a careful selection of support materials, adjustment of reaction conditions, and understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the reaction process.

          [1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
          [2] "The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) of each reaction in the modelled, complete reacting system of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 also indicate that further cracking of C3H6 will affect the ultimate yield and selectivity of the final products."

          The dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an attractive process for producing propylene (C3H6). Thermodynamic calculations suggest that further cracking of propylene might affect the yield and selectivity of the final products. Increasing the propane partial pressure leads to a reduction in its conversion rate, but this also results in a notable enhancement of propylene selectivity. The shift of the equilibrium state towards the products in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been confirmed through thermodynamic analysis. The thermodynamic analysis conducted across a comprehensive reaction system covers all possible by-products, including the generation of carbon, to provide a more accurate picture of the dehydrogenation process. In reality, the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 is a complex process involving multiple reactions, as detailed in Table 2.

          Increasing the partial pressure of C3H8 led to a decrease in its conversion rate, but importantly, it significantly improved the selectivity of C3H6 production. From a thermodynamic analysis, it has been identified that the equilibrium state shifts in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 due to the presence of CO2. The high stability of C3H8 conversion in each test confirmed the robustness and longevity of the catalyst. The peak at 2θ=36.18 corresponds to the (1-1-0) phase of Cr2O3 with rhombohedral crystal structure. The weight loss starting from 200°C is attributed to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air.
