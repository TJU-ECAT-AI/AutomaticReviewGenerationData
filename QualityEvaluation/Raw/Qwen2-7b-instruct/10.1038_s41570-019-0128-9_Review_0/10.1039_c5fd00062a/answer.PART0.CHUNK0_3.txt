1. The dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an attractive process for producing propylene (C3H6). Thermodynamic calculations suggest that further cracking of propylene might affect the yield and selectivity of the final products.

2. The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) calculations for the reactions in the modelled system indicate that the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 shifts the equilibrium state towards the product side. This is due to CO2 acting as a mild oxidant, combining the dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

3. Increasing the partial pressure of propane (C3H8) leads to a reduction in its conversion rate. However, this also results in a notable enhancement of propylene (C3H6) selectivity. This phenomenon is attributed to the competitive adsorption between generated propylene and inactivated propane, inhibiting further cracking effects on propylene.

4. The shift of the equilibrium state towards the products in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been confirmed through thermodynamic analysis. This shift is facilitated by CO2, which combines the dehydrogenation reaction with the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

5. The thermodynamic analysis conducted across a comprehensive reaction system covers all possible by-products, including the generation of carbon, to provide a more accurate picture of the dehydrogenation process.

6. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 is a complex process that involves multiple reactions, as detailed in Table 2. This complexity affects the overall yield and selectivity of the final products.

1. 烷烃C3H8在二氧化碳CO2存在的条件下进行脱氢，是生产C3H6的有吸引力的催化途径。热力学计算表明，丙烯进一步裂解可能会影响最终产物的产量和选择性。

2. 在模型化的完整反应系统中，每种反应的吉布斯自由能（ΔG）表明，丙烷在CO2的存在下脱氢会向产物侧移动平衡状态。这是由于CO2作为温和的氧化剂，将脱氢反应与逆水煤气变换反应结合在一起。

3. 增加丙烷（C3H8）的分压导致其转化率降低。然而，这也会显著提高丙烯（C3H6）的选择性。这一现象归因于生成的丙烯与被抑制的丙烷之间的竞争吸附，阻止了丙烯进一步裂解效应。

4. 通过热力学分析证实了丙烷在CO2存在下的脱氢过程中的平衡状态位移。这种位移由CO2促进，使脱氢反应与逆水煤气变换反应相结合。

5. 进行的热力学分析覆盖了所有可能的副产品，包括碳的生成，以提供脱氢过程的更准确图像。

6. 丙烷在CO2存在的条件下脱氢是一个复杂的过程，涉及多个反应，详细信息见表2。这种复杂性影响最终产物的产量和选择性。
