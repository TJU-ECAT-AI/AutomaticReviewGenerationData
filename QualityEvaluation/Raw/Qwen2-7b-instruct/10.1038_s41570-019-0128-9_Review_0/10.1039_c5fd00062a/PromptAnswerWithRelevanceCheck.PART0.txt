[1] "An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range."
[2] "The increase of the overall GHSV can also decrease the C3H8 conversion to a similar extent, but the further cracking of C3H6 cannot be limited."
[3] "The mechanism of C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves the primary activation of C3H8 on the catalyst surface, while CO2 provides a contribution to the reaction equilibrium shift by oxidising H2 generated from the C3H8 dehydrogenation (via the reverse water gas shift reaction,)."

Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, impact these factors as well. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include balancing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, maintaining stability over time, and ensuring efficient conversion rates. The activity of the catalysts is influenced by the interaction between the support material and the chromium oxide, as well as the conditions under which the reactions occur. Selectivity is often compromised to achieve higher conversion rates, and vice versa. Stability issues arise from the potential for coke buildup and catalyst deactivation. Mechanistically, the presence of CO2 helps shift the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction, but this effect is limited by the partial pressure of CO2 and the reaction conditions. The optimization of catalyst performance requires a careful selection of support materials, adjustment of reaction conditions, and understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the reaction process.

The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the support materials used and the reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure. Balancing these factors presents key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance. The presence of CO2 aids in shifting the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction, but its effectiveness is limited. The optimization of catalyst performance involves choosing suitable support materials, adjusting reaction conditions, and gaining insight into the reaction mechanisms. The results presented here suggest promising catalyst science for the industrialization of CO2 utilization through C3H8 dehydrogenation.

In terms of the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the influence of support materials and reaction conditions is significant. Challenges and trade-offs in optimizing performance include balancing activity and selectivity, maintaining stability, and efficient conversion rates. The presence of CO2 assists in shifting the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction, but its effectiveness is constrained by partial pressure and conditions. Optimizing catalyst performance requires selecting appropriate support materials, adjusting reaction conditions, and understanding the underlying mechanisms. The presented results offer promising catalyst science for the industrialization of CO2 utilization through C3H8 dehydrogenation.

1. The dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an attractive process for producing propylene (C3H6). Thermodynamic calculations suggest that further cracking of propylene might affect the yield and selectivity of the final products.

2. The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) calculations for the reactions in the modelled system indicate that the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 shifts the equilibrium state towards the product side. This is due to CO2 acting as a mild oxidant, combining the dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

3. Increasing the partial pressure of propane (C3H8) leads to a reduction in its conversion rate. However, this also results in a notable enhancement of propylene (C3H6) selectivity. This phenomenon is attributed to the competitive adsorption between generated propylene and inactivated propane, inhibiting further cracking effects on propylene.

4. The shift of the equilibrium state towards the products in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been confirmed through thermodynamic analysis. This shift is facilitated by CO2, which combines the dehydrogenation reaction with the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

5. The thermodynamic analysis conducted across a comprehensive reaction system covers all possible by-products, including the generation of carbon, to provide a more accurate picture of the dehydrogenation process.

6. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 is a complex process that involves multiple reactions, as detailed in Table 2. This complexity affects the overall yield and selectivity of the final products.

2. 在模型化的完整反应系统中，每种反应的吉布斯自由能（ΔG）表明，丙烷在CO2的存在下脱氢会向产物侧移动平衡状态。这是由于CO2作为温和的氧化剂，将脱氢反应与逆水煤气变换反应结合在一起。

3. 增加丙烷（C3H8）的分压导致其转化率降低。然而，这也会显著提高丙烯（C3H6）的选择性。这一现象归因于生成的丙烯与被抑制的丙烷之间的竞争吸附，阻止了丙烯进一步裂解效应。

4. 通过热力学分析证实了丙烷在CO2存在下的脱氢过程中的平衡状态位移。这种位移由CO2促进，使脱氢反应与逆水煤气变换反应相结合。
