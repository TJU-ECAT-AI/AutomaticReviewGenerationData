[1] "An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range."
[2] "The increase of the overall GHSV can also decrease the C3H8 conversion to a similar extent, but the further cracking of C3H6 cannot be limited."
[3] "The mechanism of C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves the primary activation of C3H8 on the catalyst surface, while CO2 provides a contribution to the reaction equilibrium shift by oxidising H2 generated from the C3H8 dehydrogenation (via the reverse water gas shift reaction,)."
[4] "We believe that the results presented here are promising in terms of the underpinning catalyst science for establishing the potential industrialisation of the process of CO2 utilisation through C3H8 dehydrogenation."

Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, impact these factors as well. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include balancing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, maintaining stability over time, and ensuring efficient conversion rates. The activity of the catalysts is influenced by the interaction between the support material and the chromium oxide, as well as the conditions under which the reactions occur. Selectivity is often compromised to achieve higher conversion rates, and vice versa. Stability issues arise from the potential for coke buildup and catalyst deactivation. Mechanistically, the presence of CO2 helps shift the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction, but this effect is limited by the partial pressure of CO2 and the reaction conditions. The optimization of catalyst performance requires a careful selection of support materials, adjustment of reaction conditions, and understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the reaction process.

The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the support materials used and the reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure.
