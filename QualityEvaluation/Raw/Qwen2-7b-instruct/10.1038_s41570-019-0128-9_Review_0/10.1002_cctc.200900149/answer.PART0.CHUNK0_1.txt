Despite these advantages, catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 is still not fully developed. Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction. However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used. When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours).
Cryptomelane-type manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) have been applied extensively as catalysts. The OMS-2 structure consists of one-dimensional tunnels built by 2×2 edge- and corner-sharing MnO6 octahedral chains, forming infinite 3D frameworks with molecule-sized (4.6×4.6Å) tunnels. OMS-2 is a mixed-valent material with manganese in oxidation states of Mn4+, Mn3+, and Mn2+. The mixed valency of OMS-2, along with its one-dimensional tunnel structure, gives rise to interesting oxidation properties. OMS-2 materials have been synthesized by different synthetic methods and characterized. In comparison to chromium oxide catalysts, OMS-2 materials are also inexpensive, easy to make, and have received a great deal of attention due to their catalytic properties.

Various support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Chromium oxide catalysts are highly effective, but they suffer from issues like overconversion to methane and carbon dioxide, leading to reduced ethylene selectivity at high temperatures. High CO2 conversion is challenging with chromium oxide-based catalysts. On the other hand, cryptomelane-type manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) offer better catalytic performance due to their unique structure and properties. These materials are cheaper, easier to synthesize, and display interesting oxidation characteristics, making them an attractive alternative to chromium oxide catalysts.

各种支持材料和反应条件在CO2氧化脱氢反应中对铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理路径产生了显著影响。铬氧化物催化剂非常有效，但存在转化过多为甲烷和二氧化碳的问题，导致在高温下的乙炔选择性降低。使用铬氧化物基催化剂时，很难实现高CO2转化率。相比之下，络合物型锰氧化物八面体分子筛（OMS-2）因其独特的结构和特性提供了更好的催化性能。这些材料更便宜，更容易合成，并且表现出有趣的氧化性质，使其成为铬氧化物催化剂的有吸引力的替代品。
