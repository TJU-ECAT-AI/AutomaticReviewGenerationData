Despite these advantages, catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 is still not fully developed. Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction. However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used. When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours). Therefore, the challenge still remains in designing efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts that could lead to high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and ultimately high ethylene selectivities (>80%).

Cryptomelane-type manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) have been applied extensively as catalysts. The OMS-2 structure consists of one-dimensional tunnels built by 2×2 edge- and corner-sharing MnO6 octahedral chains, forming infinite 3D frameworks with molecule-sized (4.6×4.6Å) tunnels. OMS-2 is a mixed-valent material with manganese in oxidation states of Mn4+, Mn3+, and Mn2+. The mixed valency of OMS-2, along with its one-dimensional tunnel structure, gives rise to interesting oxidation properties. 

Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) has been used to show the existence of acidic (NH3-TPD) and basic (CO2-TPD) sites on the OMS-2 catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the cryptomelane OMS-2 structure. Results of the thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) showed that the synthetic OMS-2 is stable to 850C. Our earlier studies of pore-size distribution indicated that a broad range of micropores was present, with diameters ranging from 58Å. The average oxidation state (AOS) of manganese was 3.67, suggesting that within OMS-2, Mn4+ is the dominant oxidation state. 

The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was used to measure the activity of the Mn species. The TPR profile of the OMS-2 catalyst exhibits two pronounced H2-consumption peaks in the temperature range of 250550C. The first H2-consumption peak at around 280C can be assigned to the reduction of MnO2 to Mn2O3 and the large H2-consumption peak is the result of overlapping peaks representing the reduction of MnO2 to Mn2O3, Mn2O3 to Mn3O4, and Mn3O4 to MnO. Moreover, the colors of the catalyst were different. OMS-2 was a dark brown color after pretreatment in He but changed to brown and green after TPR analysis. The greenish powder was assigned to the MnII species in manganosite-type manganese oxide (MnO) by XRD.

The catalyst activity was evaluated with a short contact time (0.6s). OMS-2 gave outstanding conversions (Table1) of C2H6 (70%) and CO2 (50%), as well as high C2H4 selectivities (88%) at high temperatures (800C), whereas the Cr2O3 (5wt.%) loaded ZSM-5 catalyst only gave 44% selectivity to ethylene with less than 20% CO2 conversion. By using OMS-2 as the catalyst, conversions of C2H6 increased from 35% to 70% and conversions of CO2 increased from 31% to 50% when the reaction temperature was raised from 750C to 800C. These results suggest that OMS-2 is an excellent catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 with recycling of the greenhouse gas as an added benefit.

The study discusses the use of chromium oxide catalysts versus manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2. Chromium oxide catalysts are highly effective but suffer from overconversion of ethane to unwanted byproducts like methane and CO2, leading to decreased ethylene selectivity at high temperatures and CO2 conversion. They are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime. In contrast, OMS-2 catalysts show outstanding catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability, achieving high conversions of ethane (up to 87%), promising selectivities towards ethylene (up to 97%), and high CO2 conversions (up to 56%) under short contact times (0.6s). The OMS-2 catalysts are more efficient, stable, and inexpensive compared to chromium oxide catalysts, making them a better choice for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The OMS-2 catalysts' ability to recycle CO2 is an additional advantage over chromium oxide catalysts.

研究讨论了在二氧化碳存在下乙烷脱氢过程中使用氧化铬催化剂与八面体分子筛（OMS-2）的效果。氧化铬催化剂非常有效，但存在过转化的问题，导致乙烷转化为不期望的副产品如甲烷和二氧化碳，从而降低乙烯选择性，特别是在高温下使用高转化率时。它们还不稳定、昂贵，并且寿命短（即，催化剂在几小时后失效）。相比之下，OMS-2 催化剂显示出了出色的催化活性、选择性和稳定性，能够实现高达 87% 的乙烷转化、高达 97% 的乙烯选择性以及高达 56% 的二氧化碳转化，在短时间内（0.6 秒）。与氧化铬催化剂相比，OMS-2 催化剂更高效、稳定且成本低廉，是乙烷脱氢过程中使用二氧化碳的理想选择。OMS-2 催化剂能够回收二氧化碳，这是氧化铬催化剂的一个额外优势。
