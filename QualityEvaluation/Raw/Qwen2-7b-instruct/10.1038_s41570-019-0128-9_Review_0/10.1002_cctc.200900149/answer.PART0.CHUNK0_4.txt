Despite these advantages, catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 is still not fully developed. Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction.47 However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used. When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours).

Cryptomelane-type manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) have been applied extensively as catalysts.816 The OMS-2 structure consists of one-dimensional tunnels built by 2×2 edge- and corner-sharing MnO6 octahedral chains, forming infinite 3D frameworks with molecule-sized (4.6×4.6Å) tunnels.1719 OMS-2 is a mixed-valent material2022 with manganese in oxidation states of Mn4+, Mn3+, and Mn2+. The mixed valency of OMS-2, along with its one-dimensional tunnel structure, gives rise to interesting oxidation properties.17,23,24

Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) has been used to show the existence of acidic (NH3-TPD) and basic (CO2-TPD) sites on the OMS-2 catalysts.26 X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the cryptomelane OMS-2 structure (see the Supporting Information, Figure4). Results of the thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) showed that the synthetic OMS-2 is stable to 850C (see the Supporting Information, Figure5).

Our earlier studies26 of pore-size distribution indicated that a broad range of micropores was present, with diameters ranging from 58Å. The average oxidation state (AOS) of manganese was 3.67, suggesting that within OMS-2, Mn4+ is the dominant oxidation state. All of these properties contribute to the catalytic performance of the synthesized OMS-2.

The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was used to measure the activity of the Mn species. The TPR profile of the OMS-2 catalyst (see the Supporting Information, Figure1), exhibits two pronounced H2-consumption peaks in the temperature range of 250550C. The first H2-consumption peak at around 280C can be assigned to the reduction of MnO2 to Mn2O3 and the large H2-consumption peak is the result of overlapping peaks representing the reduction of MnO2 to Mn2O3, Mn2O3 to Mn3O4, and Mn3O4 to MnO.32,33 Moreover, the colors of the catalyst were different. OMS-2 was a dark brown color after pretreatment in He but changed to brown and green after TPR analysis. The greenish powder was assigned to the MnII species in manganosite-type manganese oxide (MnO) by XRD.

Catalyst stability is important in the presence of CO2 and often determines the fate of a catalytic material for potential industrial applications. Herein, the stability of the OMS-2 was investigated by continuously recording the catalytic performance for 24h online under constant reaction conditions (T=800C). Results showed high stability of the catalytic material, in which ethane and carbon dioxide conversions along with ethylene selectivities were maintained throughout the entire experiment time (see the Supporting Information, Figure3).

The kinetic studies were performed at different residence times (see the Supporting Information, Figure2) by varying total flow rates while keeping the ratio of N2/C2H6/CO2 constant. A linear relationship with a correlation factor of R2=0.99 was obtained, which is described by Equation(4).

Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenges include high overconversion of ethane to methane and carbon dioxide, which reduces the selectivity for ethylene production. Additionally, chromium oxide catalysts are unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime. Cryptomelane-type manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) offer an alternative due to their mixed valency and one-dimensional tunnel structure, which contribute to their catalytic performance. These materials are inexpensive, easy to synthesize, and have attracted attention for their catalytic properties. The stability of OMS-2 is crucial in the presence of CO2, as it determines the catalyst's suitability for industrial applications. The kinetic studies reveal a linear relationship with a high correlation factor, indicating a second-order reaction mechanism. The use of OMS-2 as a catalyst provides high conversions of ethane, CO2, and selectivity towards ethylene, making it an ideal feedstock for processes involving ethylene carbonylation with the added benefit of recycling greenhouse gases.
