Despite these advantages, catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 is still not fully developed. Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction. However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used. When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours).

Cryptomelane-type manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) have been applied extensively as catalysts. The OMS-2 structure consists of one-dimensional tunnels built by 2×2 edge- and corner-sharing MnO6 octahedral chains, forming infinite 3D frameworks with molecule-sized (4.6×4.6Å) tunnels. OMS-2 is a mixed-valent material with manganese in oxidation states of Mn4+, Mn3+, and Mn2+. The mixed valency of OMS-2, along with its one-dimensional tunnel structure, gives rise to interesting oxidation properties. 

Herein, we report the study of the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 using OMS-2 as an efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalyst. High conversion of ethane (up to 87%) and promising selectivities towards ethylene (up to 97%), along with high CO2 conversions (up to 56%) were obtained under the reaction conditions involving a short contact time (0.6s). This is the first example of using an octahedral molecular sieve as an effective catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2.

The catalyst activity was evaluated with a short contact time (0.6s). OMS-2 gave outstanding conversions (Table1) of C2H6 (70%) and CO2 (50%), as well as high C2H4 selectivities (88%) at high temperatures (800C), whereas the Cr2O3 (5wt.%) loaded ZSM-5 catalyst only gave 44% selectivity to ethylene with less than 20% CO2 conversion.

Catalyst stability is important in the presence of CO2 and often determines the fate of a catalytic material for potential industrial applications. Herein, the stability of the OMS-2 was investigated by continuously recording the catalytic performance for 24h online under constant reaction conditions (T=800C). Results showed high stability of the catalytic material, in which ethane and carbon dioxide conversions along with ethylene selectivities were maintained throughout the entire experiment time.

The generally accepted role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons involves the removal of hydrogen and the suppression of carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. However, the pathway of hydrogen removal is still not clear.

In an effort to improve the yield of ethylene, Fe and Mo ions were loaded on the OMS-2 by an incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method. The Mo and Fe ion-loaded materials enhanced the conversion of ethane (>86%) and C2H4 yield (66%) under the same conditions.

In summary, using OMS-2 as the catalyst in C2H6 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, is an example where extreme conditions are used to drive high conversions of ethane (>70%) and CO2 (up to 56%) with high selectivity towards ethylene (87%) with a short contact time (0.6s). The reaction pathway involved two steps: ethane catalytic dehydrogenation and a reverse watergas shift reaction. High ethylene yields (66%) were obtained and could be improved by using OMS-2 as an active support.

Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Chromium oxide catalysts are effective but suffer from overconversion of ethane to other byproducts like methane and CO2, decreasing ethylene selectivity at high temperatures. Cryptomelane-type manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) offer an alternative with high ethane conversion (up to 87%) and ethylene selectivity (up to 97%) at high temperatures (800C) under a short contact time (0.6s). OMS-2 also shows high stability, converting CO2 efficiently and removing carbon deposits. Iron and molybdenum ions loaded onto OMS-2 further enhance ethane conversion and ethylene yield. The overall challenge is balancing high conversion and selectivity, with trade-offs between stability, cost, and the need for expensive catalysts in industrial applications.

各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2以及反应条件（包括CO2分压）影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径。铬氧化物催化剂有效，但存在过量转化乙烷为其他副产品（如甲烷和CO2），导致在高温（>700°C）下乙烯选择性降低的问题。而以六方分子筛型锰氧化物晶体（OMS-2）为替代品，在800°C高温下，以短接触时间（0.6s）实现高达87%的乙烷转化率和高达97%的乙烯选择性。OMS-2还表现出高稳定性，能够有效地转化为CO2并去除碳沉积。铁和钼离子负载到OMS-2上进一步提高了乙烷转化率和乙烯产率。总体挑战在于平衡高转化率和选择性，并在稳定性、成本和工业应用中需要昂贵催化剂之间做出权衡。
