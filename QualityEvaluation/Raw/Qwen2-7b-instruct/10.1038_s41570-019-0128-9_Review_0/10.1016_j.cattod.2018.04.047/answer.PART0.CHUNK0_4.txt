[1] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species."
[2] "The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties."
[3] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is characterized by formation of ethylene during the DDH accompanied by the RWGS."
[4] "CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst is characterized by selective ODH and the side reactions are non-selective oxidation or/and dry-reforming reactions."
[5] "CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is less active but the most stable due to formation of α-Cr2O3 phase that is inactive in DDH."
[6] "CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts have similar side reactions to CrOx/ZrO2, i.e., non-selective oxidation or/and dry-reforming reactions."
[7] "The increase of CrV/VI species concentration leads to increase in catalyst activity in ethane dehydrogenation."
[8] "The possibility of CO2 activation on the support leads to increased activity in ODH for CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts."
[9] "CeO2 support provides activity of catalysts in non-selective oxidation."
[10] "Control of red-ox properties of the support to provide stabilization of CrV/VI species on its surface is a key factor determining the activity of chromia catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant."

1. The support material affects the oxidation state of chromium species, influencing the reaction pathway, activity, and stability of the catalyst.
2. The catalyst's activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways vary depending on the support's properties, particularly its acid-base and red-ox characteristics.
3. The CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst undergoes direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by reverse water-gas shift (RWGS).
4. The CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst performs selective oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, with non-selective oxidation or dry reforming as side reactions.
5. The CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is less active but more stable due to the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 phase.
6. The CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts share similar side reactions with CrOx/ZrO2, including non-selective oxidation or dry reforming.
7. Increasing the concentration of Cr(V)/Cr(III) species enhances catalyst activity in ethane dehydrogenation.
8. The possibility of CO2 activation on the support boosts activity in oxidative dehydrogenation for CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts.
9. CeO2 support enables catalyst activity in non-selective oxidation reactions.
10. Controlling the red-ox properties of the support to stabilize Cr(V)/Cr(III) species on its surface is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant.
