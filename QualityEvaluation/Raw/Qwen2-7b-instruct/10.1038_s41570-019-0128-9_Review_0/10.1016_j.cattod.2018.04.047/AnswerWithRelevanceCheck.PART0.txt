          The nature of the support material affects the oxidation state of chromium species, impacting the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Different catalysts, such as CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2, exhibit varying ethylene formation rates and reaction pathways. The state of chromium depends on the support used, with specific properties like acid-base and red-ox characteristics playing a significant role. Some catalysts, like CrOx/CeO2, face difficulties in surface re-oxidation by CO2, while others, such as CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2, contain chromium mainly in a high valence state. The CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shows activity in both direct dehydrogenation (DDH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), with RWGS occurring as a side reaction. In contrast, the CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst is characterized by selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and formation of ethylene. The CrOx/CeO2 catalyst has the lowest ethylene formation rate among these catalysts.

          支持材料的性质影响铬物种的氧化状态，从而影响铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径。不同的催化剂，如CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2，展现出不同的乙烯生成速率和反应路径。铬的状态取决于所使用的支持材料，特别是其酸碱性和氧化还原性质对催化剂的影响显著。某些催化剂，如CrOx/CeO2，面临着表面由CO2重新氧化的困难，而其他催化剂，如CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2，则主要含有高价态的铬。CrOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂在直接脱氢（DDH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中均表现出活性，同时伴有水煤气转换（RWGS）作为副反应。相比之下，CrOx/ZrO2催化剂被定义为具有选择性氧化脱氢（ODH）特性和形成乙烯的特性。CrOx/CeO2催化剂在这些催化剂中具有最低的乙烯生成速率。
