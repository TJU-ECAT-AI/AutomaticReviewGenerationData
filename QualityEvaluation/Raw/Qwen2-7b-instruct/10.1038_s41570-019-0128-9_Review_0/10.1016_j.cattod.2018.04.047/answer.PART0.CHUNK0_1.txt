[1] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species, and the activity and stability of the catalyst."
[2] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the higher activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, but the reaction pathways are different on them."
[3] "The main route for CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by the RWGS, with cracking and coke formation as side reactions."
[4] "On CrOx/ ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation and the side reactions are non-selective oxidation or/and dry-reforming reactions."
[5] "The rapid deactivation of the CrOx/ZrO2 at high temperatures is caused by possible sintering of the catalyst and/or formation of inactive chromium species."
[6] "CrOx/CeO2 is the less active, but the most stable catalyst due to formation of α-Cr2O3 phase that is inactive in DDH."
[7] "Small contribution of selective ODH on this catalyst is connected with difficulties of surface re-oxidation by CO2."
[8] "Relatively high stability of CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 is caused by their low activity for ethylene formation and removal of carbon deposits by CO2 due to basic sites of the supports."
[9] "The side reactions for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 are similar to CrOx/ZrO2, i.e., non-selective oxidation or/and dry-reforming reactions."

1. The support material affects the oxidation state of chromium species, influencing the catalyst's activity and stability.
2. Chromium oxide catalysts on γ-Al2O3 and ZrO2 show higher activity in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, but with distinct pathways.
3. γ-Al2O3 catalysts undergo direct dehydrogenation with RWGS, cracking, and coke formation.
4. ZrO2 catalysts form ethylene through selective oxidative dehydrogenation with non-selective oxidation or dry-reforming.
5. High temperature deactivation of ZrO2 catalysts is due to sintering or formation of inactive chromium species.
6. CeO2 catalysts are less active but more stable, thanks to the inactive α-Cr2O3 phase.
7. Selective oxidative dehydrogenation on CeO2 catalysts faces difficulties with surface re-oxidation by CO2.
8. Stability of CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts is enhanced by their low ethylene formation activity and carbon deposit removal by CO2.
9. Side reactions for CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts mirror those of ZrO2 catalysts, involving non-selective oxidation or dry-reforming.

1. 支持材料影响铬物种的氧化状态，进而影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。
2. γ-Al2O3和ZrO2上的铬氧化物催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出较高的活性，但路径不同。
3. γ-Al2O3催化剂通过直接脱氢伴随RWGS，伴随着裂解和结焦等副反应。
4. ZrO2催化剂通过选择性氧化脱氢形成乙烯，并伴有非选择性氧化或干燥重整反应。
5. ZrO2催化剂在高温下快速失活的原因可能是催化剂的烧结或形成无活性的铬物种。
6. CeO2催化剂活性较低但更稳定，这归因于无活性的α-Cr2O3相的存在。
7. CeO2催化剂上选择性氧化脱氢面临表面由CO2重新氧化的困难。
8. CeO2和CexZr(1-x)O2催化剂的稳定性得益于它们较低的乙烯生成活性和通过支持物的碱性位点去除碳沉积的能力。
9. CeO2和CexZr(1-x)O2催化剂的副反应与ZrO2催化剂相似，包括非选择性氧化或干燥重整反应。
