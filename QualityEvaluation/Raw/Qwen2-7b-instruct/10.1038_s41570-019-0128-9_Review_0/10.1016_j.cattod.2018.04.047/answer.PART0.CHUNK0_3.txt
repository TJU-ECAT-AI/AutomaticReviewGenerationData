[1] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species, and the activity and stability of the catalyst."
[2] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the higher activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, but the reaction pathways are different on them."
[3] "The main route for CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by the RWGS, with cracking and coke formation as side reactions."
[4] "On CrOx/ ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation and the side reactions are non-selective oxidation or/and dry-reforming reactions."
[5] "The rapid deactivation of the CrOx/ZrO2 at high temperatures is caused by possible sintering of the catalyst and/or formation of inactive chromium species."
[6] "CrOx/CeO2 is the less active, but the most stable catalyst due to formation of α-Cr2O3 phase that is inactive in DDH."
[7] "Small contribution of selective ODH on this catalyst is connected with difficulties of surface re-oxidation by CO2."
[8] "Relatively high stability of CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 is caused by their low activity for ethylene formation and removal of carbon deposits by CO2 due to basic sites of the supports."
[9] "The side reactions for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 are similar to CrOx/ZrO2, i.e., non-selective oxidation or/ and dry-reforming reactions."

1. The nature of the support material affects the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.  
2. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and ZrO2 show higher activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.
3. For γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts, ethane dehydrogenation occurs through direct dehydrogenation (DDH) accompanied by RWGS, leading to cracking and coke formation.
4. ZrO2-supported catalysts primarily form ethylene via selective oxidative dehydrogenation, with non-selective oxidation or dry reforming as side reactions.
5. The CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst rapidly deactivates at high temperatures due to possible sintering and formation of inactive chromium species.
6. The CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is less active but more stable because of the formation of α-Cr2O3, which is inactive in DDH.
7. The limited contribution of selective oxidative dehydrogenation on the CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is due to difficulties in surface re-oxidation by CO2.
8. The high stability of CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts is attributed to their low ethylene formation activity and carbon deposit removal by CO2, facilitated by the basic sites of the supports.
9. The side reactions for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts resemble those of CrOx/ZrO2, involving non-selective oxidation or dry reforming.

1. 支持材料的性质影响了铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径。
2. 铬氧化物催化剂在γ-Al2O3和ZrO2上的支持下显示出在乙烷氧化脱氢中的更高活性。
3. 对于γ-Al2O3支持的催化剂，乙烷脱氢通过直接脱氢（DDH）伴随水煤气转换发生，导致裂解和焦炭形成。
4. ZrO2支持的催化剂主要通过选择性的氧化脱氢形成乙烯，非选择性氧化或干式重整作为副反应。
5. CrOx/ZrO2催化剂在高温下快速失活，可能由于催化剂的结块和无活性铬物种的形成。
6. CrOx/CeO2催化剂较不活跃但更稳定，因为形成了无活性的α-Cr2O3，这在直接脱氢中是无活性的。
7. CrOx/CeO2催化剂有限的氧化脱氢贡献与表面由CO2再氧化的困难有关。
8. CrOx/CeO2和CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2催化剂的高稳定性归因于它们的低乙烷形成活性和碳沉积由CO2去除，借助支持体的基本位点。
9. CrOx/CeO2和CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2催化剂的副反应类似于CrOx/ZrO2，涉及非选择性氧化或干式重整。
