The influence of support materials (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic behavior of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) reactions is profound. These factors significantly shape the performance of the catalysts, with CO2 partial pressure being pivotal in altering the reaction kinetics and equilibrium. Challenges in optimizing the overall performance include finding the right balance between activity, selectivity, and stability, given the inherent trade-offs between these properties.
