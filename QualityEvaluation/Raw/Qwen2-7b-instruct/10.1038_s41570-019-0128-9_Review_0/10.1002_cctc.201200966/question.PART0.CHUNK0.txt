1. Introduction
Ethene is one of the most important building blocks in the chemical industry. Among organic chemicals, ethene ranks first with respect to volume, with an annual worldwide production of 120106 tons in 2008.[4] Ethene is used to synthesize poly- mers, styrene, ethene oxide, vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate monomers, functionalized hydrocarbons (i.e., dichloroethane,ethylbenzene, acetaldehyde, and ethanol), and many other basic and intermediate products.
The direct activation and conversion of alkanes into chemi- cals results in more-complicated process schemes than those for the analogous processes that employ olefins.[5] Neverthe- less, the availability of alkanes, the increasing demand for ole- fins,[6] and the necessity to minimize the negative environmen- tal impact of a process[7] has stimulated research into new directions.
Steam cracking, that is, high-temperature pyrolysis in the presence of diluting steam, is the most established industrial process for the manufacture of ethene. Typical feedstocks for this reaction are various grades of naphtha and components of natural gas. Different steam-cracking processes are known, de- pending on the length of the carbon chain in the feedstock.
Although naphtha is the main feedstock for ethene production in Western Europe and Japan, natural-gas-derived feedstocks are mainly used in the United States and the Middle East. The lighter feedstocks consist of liquefied petroleum gas (that con- tains propane and different butanes) or ethane, propane, and butane, which originate from natural gas. For naphtha crack- ers, full-range naphtha (boiling point: 302008C) or C6C8 cuts are typically used as feedstocks. In the Middle East, the feed- stock basis has only shifted to ethane in the last decade, thus leading to attractive production costs.[4] It should be men- tioned in passing that the emerging availability of shale gas will markedly shift the overall picture towards processes that use light alkanes.
The recurring increase in the price of crude oil and, in partic- ular, the availability of ethane in shale gas, has advanced the interest in alternative processes for ethene production, includ- ing the dehydration of ethanol (thus enabling the utilization of biomass-derived feeds) and the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of ethane. This latter process offers conceptual advantages and,therefore, has been the subject of substantial research activi- ties. However, the lack of suitable catalysts that combine high activity and selectivity has prevented their industrial realization so far.
Several excellent reviews have broadly addressed ODH reac- tions.[610] Because of the special role of the ODH of ethane and its potential process applications, we have decided to take a different approach. Therefore, this Review summarizes the current state of ethene production as a baseline for the poten- tial and challenges that face the development of new process- es. This Review also describes insight on the atomic and mo- lecular levels, as well as into the ongoing developments in cat- alytic processes and reactor engineering.
2. Current Practice: Steam Cracking, Ethane
Dehydrogenation and Ethanol Dehydration
2.1. Steam cracking
The steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most widespread process for the industrial manufacture of ethene. Steam-dilut- ed alkanes are converted at high temperatures (approximately 8008C) in reactor tubes, thus leading to homogeneous pyroly- sis. A wide variety of feeds with boiling points of up to 6008C can be converted through a radical chain mechanism. Having been practiced for over 50 years, this process is now very [a] Dipl.-Ing. MSc. C.

C. van Veen Current address: School of Engineering University of Warwick Coventry CV4 7AL (UK) The increasing demand for light olefins and the changing nature of basic feedstock has stimulated substantial research activity into the development of new process routes. Steam cracking remains the most industrially relevant pathway, but other routes for light-olefin production have emerged. Fluid catalytic cracking only produces ethene in minor concentra- tions. Challenged by marked catalyst deactivation, in contrast,catalytic dehydrogenation ethane up opens a more selective route to ethene. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane, which couples the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the strongly exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, would po- tentially be the most attractive alternative route because it avoids the need for excessive internal heat input, but also con- sumes valuable hydrogen. In this Review, the current state of the ODH of ethane is compared with other routes for light- olefin production, with a focus on the catalyst and reactor system variants. New catalyst systems and reactor designs have been developed to improve the industrial competitive- ness of the ODH reaction of ethane. The current state of our fundamental understanding of the ODH of light alkanes, in particular in terms of catalyst and reactor development, is criti- cally reviewed. The proposed mechanisms and the nature of the active site for the ODH reaction are described and dis- cussed in detail for selected promising catalysts. The reported catalytic performance and the possible limitations of these ODH catalysts will be examined and the performance of the emerging approaches is compared to the currently practiced methods. 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

0.5 s. Cracking furnaces are externally fired and the radiant
tubes (or coils) have different arrangements (split coil or paral- lel millisecond pyrolysis).[4] The feed is cracked into small ole- fins and di-olefins. Owing to the high reactivity of the prod- ucts, the effluent has to be quenched within 0.020.1 s to avoid product degradation. The products are separated by a combination of distillation and absorption processes.
Steam cracking can be described by using complex kinetic models, which account for the progress of the ultrafast reac- tions in radical chemistry. Parameters that influence the perfor- mance and product distribution are residence time, the partial pressures of the feedstock and steam, and the process temper- ature (profile) in the reactor. Typical hydrocarbon-conversion levels reach 70%,[4] with olefin yields of around 50% by using ethane as a feedstock, whereas single-pass conversion yields are lower in naphtha crackers.
Because the process operates at very high temperatures with high reactant streams, the requirements on the equip- ment are demanding. Suitable materials have to be heat-resist- ant, because temperatures up to 11008C are reached in the re- action tubes. Given the importance of heat management, the sophistication of the engineering of heat exchangers is crucial and involves great effort.
Although it is the industry standard for ethene production,steam cracking has disadvantages. It is a highly energy-inten- sive process; the total energy demand of the produced ethene is 16 GJt1 in the case of ethane as a feedstock and 23 GJt1 if naphtha is used as a feedstock.[4] A part of the light effluent from the product gas stream has to be combusted to provide heat, thereby leading to the formation of CO2 and NOx. Per ton of ethene, 11.6 t CO2 are produced through this external heat- ing.[4] In addition, notable amounts of coke are formed on the inside reactor walls, thus requiring periodic reactor shut-down for maintenance and coke removal[11] by air and steam gasifica- tion, because mechanical coke removal is not possible.
2.2. Dehydrogenation of ethane
The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has been industrially applied since the 1930s. The strongly endothermic and equilib- rium-limited process,[Eq. (1)],is performed in fixed-bed reactors.

High pressures shift the equilibrium toward ethane.
Typical catalysts are based on Cr (i.e., chromiaalumina) or Pt.[12,13] The major challenges are the suppression of side reac- Christian Grtner, born in Stuttgart (Germany), studied Chemical Engineer- ing at the University of Stuttgart (Ger- many) and the University of Wisconsin, Madison (USA), where he received his MS in 2009 under the supervision of Prof. James A.

Consecutive side reactions lead to the forma- tion of dienes, polymers, and coke.[12] Coke removal from the catalyst during the frequent regeneration is required to main- tain acceptable catalyst lifetimes.
Regular catalyst regeneration occurs by oxidation and the associated heat of combustion can be recovered in a straight- forward manner, especially if several catalyst beds are operated in parallel. One of the first commercial dehydrogenation pro- cesses by using chromiaalumina, Catadiene, was employed for butadiene production, by using a parallel fixed-bed ar- rangement of reactors, which are operated in swing mode to alternate the dehydrogenation and coke removal.
In the late 1980s, the development of new processes broad- ened the application range to the production of propene from propane. Catofin employs dehydrogenation and catalyst regen- eration in a swing mode that is similar to the Catadiene pro- cess. An adiabatic fixed-bed reactor is used and pre-heated propane is fed into the reactor, with cooling as the reaction proceeds along the reactor.[14] In the early 1970s, the continu- ous catalyst regeneration (CCR) concept was introduced by UOP; the associated process used an adiabatic fluidized-bed reactor (UOP Oleflex).[10,12] However, ethane dehydrogenation by using this route could not compete with steam cracking be- cause of the relatively low activity of the catalysts, thus leading to low single-pass yields.
2.3. Dehydration of ethanol
The industrial production of ethanol from biomass, in particu- lar in Brazil, has made it an available commodity for its intro- duction as a fuel additive or hydrocarbon substitute.[15,16] Thus,the dehydration of ethanol, [Eq. (2)], seems feasible as a niche route to olefins in certain locations.[14] The mildly endothermic dehydration is catalyzed at around 3008C by using solid acids[4] and selectivities of over 99% are possible.
C2H5OH  C2H4H2O DrH298  45:6 kJ mol1 2 Although the reaction was performed for a long time with homogeneous catalysts (sulfuric and phosphoric acid), hetero- geneous catalysts, such as alumina, silica, and other solid acid catalysts,have now largely replaced homogeneous catalysts.[17,18] The process layout is straightforward. Ethanol is heated and fed into the catalytic reactor, followed by a gas/liquid separa- tor, which splits the product stream into a liquid stream that contains ethanol and water and a gas stream that mainly con- tains ethene. The ethene stream has to be purified in several stages. Compared to steam cracking, this process consumes less energy and the production of carbon and nitrous oxides is decreased.[4]
3. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane:
Mechanistic Considerations In contrast to the above-mentioned processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODH) has not been implemented on a large scale yet. Its conceptual advantage over dehydro- genation, that is, high ethane conversion, potentially lower re- action temperatures (about 4006008C) as compared to steam cracking, and the fact that the reaction is exothermic, has spur- red growing interest in this process [Eq. (3)].
C2H60:5 O2 ! C2H4H2O DrH298  105:5 kJ mol1
3 Short-chain alkanes, in particular ethane that is extracted from conventional natural gas and shale gas, are cheap and abundant and, thus, is a suitable feedstock for oxidative dehy- drogenation.[19] However, major practical differences are re- quired compared to the established steam cracking. Firstly, O2 is added to the feed, thus imposing additional safety measures to prevent the thermal runaway of the reaction and conse- quential explosions. Secondly, the development of suitable cat- alysts is particularly challenging, because the olefin products tend to be more reactive than the reacting alkanes. This rela- tively higher reactivity of the olefins is attributed to enhanced additional directed bonding to most catalytic surfaces, whereas alkanes interact almost exclusively through dispersion forces.[1] Because ethane is converted into ethene through dehydro- genation, some total oxidation, thus forming CO and CO2, as well as water, may take place. This latter reaction pathway originates from oxygen insertion into the CH bond during the primary activation or from the addition of oxygen to ethene, as shown in Figure 1. Because the latter reaction could involve oxygen anions or electrophilic oxygen atoms, it is im- portant to prevent the re-adsorption of ethene and to separate it from O2. Whereas such oxygenates are intermediates on the route to total oxidation, many of the targeted uses of, for ex- ample, ethene, such as polymerization, require very high purity of the olefins.[20] Almost-complete selectivity for a single olefin is only feasible with ethane as feedstock, because ethene is the only possible dehydrogenation product and it is sufficiently unreactive to- wards oxygen addition. The hydrogenolytic CC bond cleav- Figure 1. ODH reaction of ethane with side reactions. 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

www.chemcatchem.org age of ethane or ethene, which results in the formation of CH4,is a highly structure-sensitive reaction and, hence, unlikely under most conditions.[21] In contrast, this result does not hold true in the case of pro- pene. Nevertheless, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is possible,[22] but the yields of propene are low because the al- lylic structure that is formed upon further hydrogen abstrac- tion from propene favors further oxidation,[6] thus leading to oxygenated by-products and, eventually, COx.[23] The various reactivities of the reactants and the products can be better understood by considering their CH bond ener- gies. Whereas the weakest CH bond in ethane has a bond energy of 419.5 kJmol1, its analogue in propane has a value of 401.3 kJmol1. However, the weakest CH bond in ethene has an energy of 444 kJmol1 compared to 360.7 kJmol1 in propene. A more distinct difference can be seen in terms of the weakest
CC
bond,which has a bond energy of 720 kJmol1 in ethene, because the only CC bond is a double bond, compared to 413.8 kJmol1 in propene, in which the weakest CC bond is a single bond. In general, to achieve high selectivities, it is mandatory that the weakest CH or CC bond in the olefin is less than 30 kJmol1 weaker than the weakest CH bond in the reacting paraffin.[24] This result is true for ethane and ethene, but not for propane and propene.
As a consequence, the ODH of ethane is a promising route with potentially high selectivity.[10,25] The reported exploratory approaches range from catalyst development to combining high activity and selectivity, that is, to tailor the catalyst, in such a way that it favors hydrogen abstraction, as well as mini- mizing oxygen insertion,[8,26] to new reactor concepts.[11,27,28] The emerging paradigm is that the development of suitable catalysts requires fundamental insight into the reaction mecha- nism on a molecular level, including the details of the interac- tions with the catalytic surfaces and the associated gas-phase reactions.[7] Because a very diverse range of catalytic materials have been reported, we will first describe the catalytic chemistry of the ODH of ethane on these materials, with an emphasis on the understanding of the catalytically active site. The mecha- nism and catalytic performance of selected catalysts are dis- cussed with respect to the overall performance, as well as with respect to the applied reaction conditions. The materials ex- plored include transition-metal, rare-earth-metal, and alkali metal oxides, as well as supported alkali chlorides. The optimal reaction conditions for these classes of catalysts differ because of differences in their catalytic activity, which, for practical rea- sons, are compensated for by varying the reaction tempera- ture. Because it is rationalized that the first CH activation is rate determining in most cases, we start by discussing the acti- vation of the first CH bond.
3.1. CH activation and cleavage
Overall, the CH cleavage steps can occur either homolytically or heterolytically, with homolytic bond cleavage dominant.
3.1.1. Single-electron processes
Homolytic CH bond rupture involves unpaired electrons and,hence, in most cases, higher energy barriers than elementary steps that involve paired electrons. Moreover, it has to be in- duced thermally (which can be aided by CH bond polariza- tion) or by radicals.[29] Figure 2 shows a typical one-electron process, inducing a radical chain mechanism for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.
The high energy barriers that are involved in the single-elec- tron process have disadvantages compared to surface catalytic processes. The involvement of free radicals may induce further gas-phase reactions, which are complex to control. In ethane conversion, for example, butanes may form by the recombina- tion of ethyl radicals. Figure 2 shows a good example, because H2O2 that is formed transiently may decompose into two OHC radicals, which would further enhance the reaction rate by cre- ating new radical cycles.
The concentration of alkyl radicals and their reactivity depend on the reaction temperature. Catalytically, one route for the generation of alkyl radicals involves their formation on the active surface. Especially at elevated temperatures, the rad- ical is released into the gas phase, in which it reacts further. A second possibility is that alkyl radicals react close to the cata- lytic surface, such as in the boundary layer. The third possibility is that the radical reacts quickly while it is still adsorbed on the catalyst surface, that is, it undergoes conversion into the corre- sponding olefin through b-elimination or reaction with carbon oxides through attack by adsorbed unselective oxygen species.[7] Some examples of catalysts that generate radicals on the surface, with free-radical processes prevailing in the gas phase,include rare-earth oxides and alkali oxides.[3032] Leveles et al. exemplified this mechanism for the ODH of propane on MgO- supported Li2O.[33,34] Their study showed that alkanes were acti- vated on the catalyst surface in the rate-determining step, thus producing alkyl radicals. However, the overall reaction was markedly influenced by gas-phase chemistry.
Despite the large number of contributions to this area, the nature of the active site that abstracts the H atom is still debat- Figure 2.

It should be empha- sized that, in the absence of O2, hydrogen and methyl radicals are the chain propagators with iso- and n-propyl radicals the main acting species.

Alternatively, regeneration occurs through the ready elimina- tion of water from the surface at elevated reaction tempera- tures. However, the surface hydroxyl groups are only part of the cycle and do not have catalytic properties.[33,37] Whereas in the prior example, the radical that was formed on the surface initiated a gas-phase process, homolytic CH cleavage on the catalyst surface may also be followed by prop- agation on the catalyst surface.[38] Hence, oxidation reactions in microporous materials, such as zeolites or redox-active oxides,may be controlled by surface free-radical reactions. Examples of catalysts that follow this pathway are vanadium or cobalt species in zeolites[1] or on oxide surfaces.[38] The catalyst ini- tiates the reaction by the activation of the first CH bond through the generation of an ethyl radical. This species reacts quickly on the surface, thereby acting as a chain propagator.
Sauer and co-workers showed that the formation of transient radicals on an oxide surface is energetically favored over gas- phase reactions.[39] However, there are indications that this way of activating the first CH bond, that is, through a single-elec- tron process, is unique for V-containing catalysts.[40] The ab- sence of radical processes that propagate into the gas phase,that is, the fact that the reaction is confined to the catalytic surface, leads to better control of the reaction and results in enhanced olefin selectivity.
V- and Ni-containing catalysts also undergo single-electron- transfer processes, but this will be addressed later.
3.1.2. Processes that involve paired electrons
In contrast to single-electron processes for the ODH of ethane,several catalytic mechanisms involve the simultaneous transfer of two electrons. In these cases, the first CH bond is cleaved heterolytically and a redox pair of one or more metal oxides is involved. In general, the heterolytic cleavage of a CH bond requires strongly basic sites on the catalyst surface to facilitate proton abstraction. A nucleophilic lattice oxygen atom of a basic oxide can serve as such a site.[8] It is disputed whether the heterolytic splitting can be facilitated by electrophilic metal cations.[26] Figure 3 shows a typical catalytic cycle, which involves the transfer of an electron pair, taking a molybdenum oxide as an example. Vanadium-based catalysts can follow the same type of paired-electron mechanism.
3.2. Active sites for the ODH of ethane
Having shown that sites with single or paired electrons may be involved in the oxidative hydrogen-abstraction step, let us turn to the catalytically active sites. Sites for the ODH reactions of alkanes can be grouped into those that contain redox-active metal cations and those that involve anions in the redox cycle.
3.2.1. Redox-active metal oxides
Most of the catalysts that have been reported to be active for the ODH of ethane fall into this category. The ODH of ethane on such materials follows a Marsvan Krevelen[41] mechanism.
In a polar route, ethane reacts with a metal-oxide species and forms an ethoxyhydroxy pair (Figure 3). After the activation of the b-H atom, ethene is formed and desorbs from the cata- lyst, thereby leaving a dihydroxy species behind. Water is elimi- Figure 3.

The cleavage of the first CH bond may occur homolytically or heterolytically. The most prominent catalysts are based on vanadium oxide,[9,38,43] with g-Al2O3 or SiO2 as typical sup- ports.[44,45] The oxidic support is not involved in the redox cycle; however, it does influence the activity and lability of the oxygen atoms that are associated with V.[46] Three types of available metaloxide bonds can be distinguished, that is, ter- minal vanadyloxygen bonds, bridging oxygen atoms between two V cations, and bridging O atoms between a V cation and the support. The isolated VO4 species in Figure 4 shows termi- nal V=O bonds and bridging oxygen bonds between a V atom and the support. The polymeric VO4 species show additional VO bonds, which bridge between two V atoms. Two ques- tions, that is, which of the oxygen atoms participate in the crit- ical first CH bond activation and what is the structure of the active site, have been vividly debated, without reaching an un- equivocal conclusion.[1] Ethane can be activated at redox-active metal centers that involve either one or two centers. The first possibility is that ethane interacts with the oxygen atoms that are coordinated to one metal cation, as shown in Figure 3. In this case, two ter- minal M=O bonds are involved in the ODH of ethane through the transfer of paired electrons. V2O5-based catalysts with higher V2O5 loadings, which form polyvanadate species (e.g.,2 wt.% V2O5 on Al2O3 [2]), are believed to operate through a mechanism in which paired metal centers undergo a single- electron reduction (in this case from V5+ to V4+).[2] Two neigh- boring metal sites actively cooperate in the ODH reaction;however, only one of them performs the first CH cleavage.
This mechanism is shown in Figure 5. The other possibility is the cooperation between two neighboring redox sites or ma- terials, which involves two or more different anions. However,in this case, the two redox centers must have different oxida- tion states. This mechanism is mainly known from selective oxi- dation of butane,[1,47] but may also be applied to the ODH of ethane.
For the ODH of ethane, it is known that neighboring surface vanadia species lead to enhanced reducibility and, hence, also to increased reactivity.
Figure 6 shows a mechanism that involves two redox centers with oxidation numbers +4 and +5. In this case, initial CH ac- tivation occurs through heterolytic cleavage.
3.2.2. Catalysts with non-redox-active metals
The ODH of ethane through homolytic activation of the CH bonds without a change in the oxidation state of the metal is also possible. In that case, the anion (in most cases halogens) assumes the role of the redox-active element. Depending on the temperature, this process may formally involve single or paired electrons. These two possibilities cannot be differentiat- ed if the bond-breaking and -forming steps occur without charge separation.
The first concept in this chapter is an indirect route to oxida- tive dehydrogenation, which is realized by the halogenation of CH4 followed by radical formation or acid-catalyzed elimination and subsequent CC coupling on LaCl3-based catalysts. In par- ticular, HCl and HBr are suitable for such transient halogena- tions.[1] Of course, ethane can also be directly halogenated and induced to eliminate HX.[4850] In this case, the formation of vinyl chloride has been observed.
Mechanistically, O2, in combination with HX, leads to the for- mation of positively charged halogen atoms on the catalyst Figure 4. Different surface vanadium species (adapted from Ref. [1]).Figure 5. Mechanism of the ODH reaction over V2O5-based catalysts (S=sup- port, adapted from Ref. [2]).

www.chemcatchem.org surface. Subsequently, the hydrogen atom in the first CH bond undergoes electrophilic substitution. To complete the catalytic cycle, water is eliminated in the next step, by combin- ing one H atom from the alkane and one from HCl, thus re- plenishing the transferred Cl ion. This process involves un- paired electrons, but not radical gas-phase reactions. However,the resulting overall chemistry only differs very subtly from free-radical reactions.
LaCl3-based catalysts are ideally suited to produce chlorinat- ed species because of the suitable strength of the LaCl bond.
If the strength of the metalchloride bond is stronger, similar catalytic chemistry can be realized, but the chloride transfer is dramatically decreased and olefins appear as the primary products.
The second concept comprises a related catalytic route,which involves halogen species that are based on supported alkali chlorides. Ethane activation over these catalysts most likely involves the decomposition of hypochlorite at the sur- face, thus forming CO and CCl radicals [Eq. (9)].[51] OCl ! COCCl 9 Subsequently, H is homolytically abstracted from adsorbed ethane, thus resulting in the formation of a hydroxy group and an ethyl radical, which recombine to afford ethyl chloride.

C2H5ClOH ! C2H4H2OCl 11 The other possibility would be a ClC bond formation on the surface, thus leading to subsequent homolytic cleavage,with the release of an ethyl radical. This route would start a gas-phase radical mechanism[33,34] [Eq. (12)].

CC2H5CCl 12 It is also conceivable that two H atoms are eliminated in a concerted manner by hypochlorite anions that themselves are formed upon the concerted reaction of O2 with LiCl.[1] The hydrogen abstraction leads to the reduction of the hypochlor- ite anion back into chloride, according to Equations (13.1),(13.2), and (13.3).

To complete the list of catalysts that follow this pathway,rare-earth oxides[30] and LiDyMg mixed oxides[21] also have to be addressed, even though they do not contain halogen atoms; they will be explained in detail later on.
A third reaction pathway is realized by catalysts that are able to form peroxo species,[52,53] such as vanadium oxides.
Conceptually, V2O5 should allow the formation of such peroxo species.[53] In such a pathway, the vanadium cation itself does not have any redox functionality; Figure 7 shows how the oxi- dation state of the involved oxygen atoms changes instead.
Peroxovanadate species catalyze such a single-site mechanism.
CH bonds on both carbon atoms of ethane are attacked through homolytic cleavage, followed by the formation of ethene and two hydroxyl groups on the V atom. Subsequently,water is eliminated and the V=O bond is formed again.
However, V is known to form various metaloxide bonds in various structural environments, as discussed above.[54] Raman and UV/Vis studies have shown that peroxo species may not generally form on certain supports, such as silica, but are con- ceivable in organometallic compounds.[55] Furthermore, higher concentrations of Vperoxo moieties can only form at very low temperatures (90 K),[53] which are not realistic for the ODH of ethane.
DFT calculations have shown that peroxo species can form on V2O5 surfaces. However, the substitution of O2 by N2O as an oxidizing agent (described in more detail in Section 3.3.3) disa- bles the formation of peroxovanadates. It is likely that vanadyl species are active and selective for the ODH reaction, whereas peroxo-forming sites are unselective.[56]
3.3. Factors that govern the activity and selectivity of ODH
catalysts
3.3.1. Metaloxygen bond strength
One important parameter, especially for redox-active catalysts,is the strength of the metaloxygen bond in the active site;more specifically, its strength and its variation with the degree of reduction in a catalytic cycle.[57] As the strength of this bond varies, the activity and selectivity of an oxidation catalyst will pass through a maximum in terms of the formation rate of the partial oxidation product, that is, in the specific case discussed Figure 7.

If the metaloxygen bond is weak, the catalyst is active (e.g., condensed supported vanadium-oxide clusters) but not very selective, because multiple oxidation steps are facile.[58] As the bond strength increases (e.g., smaller clusters of supported vanadia), the reactivity will gradually decrease, but the selectiv- ity will increase.[59] For example, silica supports lead to the highest selectivity of VO species, because no polymeric vana- dia species can be observed.[5] If one site contains more than one oxygen atom in an opti- mal material, the release of the second oxygen atom after the initial reduction step is much more difficult than the first, for example, in a material with a metal site that is in a high oxida- tion state combined with a non-reducible oxide site.[60] Even if the support is not directly involved in most redox catalysts for the ODH of ethane, its acid/base properties may play the role of a mediator of the redox-active cluster. A more- acidic support increases the metaloxygen bond strength in the redox-active cluster, whereas a more-basic oxide decreases it. This trend can be illustrated with vanadium on a series of different supports, in which an increasing acidity is correlated with decreasing activity and increasing olefin selectivity (V2O5/ MgO<V2O5/MgO+Al2O3<V2O5/Al2O3).[5]
3.3.2. Functionality of the active sites and the cooperation be-
tween phases ODH is a complex reaction that requires the active sites to pos- sess multiple qualities. It has to be able to adsorb and chemi- sorb the alkane, to facilitate the abstraction of two hydrogen atoms, to be re-oxidized by oxygen from the gas phase, and to desorb the produced olefin.[57] Typical vanadate or molybdate anions are capable of performing multiple reaction steps, as depicted in the examples above. However, highly effective cat- alysts exist that consist of two phases, which act in a concerted manner, with the two phases in close spatial proximity to one another.
The most prominent example of this phenomenon is the combination of V2O5 and molybdate sites by depositing V2O5 clusters onto a polymolybdate surface that is supported on alumina.[1,61] Whereas V2O5 is still considered to be the active center, Mo seems to decrease the polarity of the metal oxygen bonds and, hence, increase the acidic character of the surface without changing the nature of the active V2O5 site. In- creasing the V2O5 content up to one monolayer increased the selectivity for ODH over total oxidation reactions. The ratio be- tween the total oxidation and the ODH reaction was notably lower than with V2O5 that was supported on Al2O3 without the molybdates. The presence of the molybdate decreased the in- teractions between the V cations and the olefin product, thus leading to accelerated olefin desorption and, hence, higher selectivities.[1]
3.3.3. Role of O2 and the density of sites
A comprehensive study that compared O2 and N2O as oxidants was reported by Kondratenko et al.[62] This study on vanadia that was incorporated into MCM-41 also nicely pointed out the importance of site isolation and the influence of the density of active sites. The use of N2O instead of O2 resulted in lower ac- tivity, as explained by the fact that N2O had a lower ability to re-oxidize the VOx sites from the reduced state caused hydro- gen abstraction and water elimination. Because the elementary steps of the reaction are independent of the oxidant and the same oxygen lattice species are formed regardless whether O2 or N2O is used, the steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen atoms must account for the difference in reactivity.
Not only is the olefin selectivity markedly higher if N2O is used as an oxidant, the decrease in olefin selectivity with increasing activity also becomes less notable with N2O as an oxidant com- pared to O2. Because N2O tends to re-oxidize the reduced va- nadia sites more slowly than O2, the concentration of those sites is lower, thus lowering the probability that more than two labile lattice oxygen atoms exist per site. More labile oxygen atoms per site favor unselective total oxidation reac- tions and eliminate the possibility that adsorbed oxygen spe- cies are in spatial proximity to the vanadia centers (but not in- corporated into the lattice),[63] which might enhance total oxidation.
3.3.4. Desorption and re-adsorption of ethane
Because olefins are more reactive than alkanes, ethene shows a higher affinity, as well as higher reactivity, with most surfaces than ethane. Hence, the re-adsorption of the formed olefin on the catalytic surface limits the selectivity. The stepwise addition of oxygen is frequently followed by decarbonylation or decar- boxylation on acid catalysts. Therefore, the addition of oxygen,which leads to products such as acetaldehyde or acetic acid,will, in turn, enhance the selectivity for total oxidation. Because the re-adsorption of olefins is linked to the presence of accessi- ble metal cations (Lewis acid sites), their presence has to be minimized. Three options exist to accomplish this goal: The first option is to use oxides with low specific surface areas, thereby minimizing the concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites. Thus, catalysts with high crystallinity show ex- cellent selectivities in the ODH of ethane,[64,65] as well as in other oxidation reactions,[66] because they expose a limited number of unselective sites.
The second concept relies on surfaces that dynamically rear- range to prevent the exposure of cations, such as a supported molten chloride overlayer. The mobility of the melt prevents the formation of defect sites (coordinatively unsaturated metal cations), which are speculated to initiate the reactions that lead to deep oxidation. In a melt, the surface re-arranges,thereby quickly limiting the concentration of these exposed cations by covering the transiently present exposed cat- ions.[51,67] The fact that predominantly anions that are not able to attack the double bond of the olefin are present on the 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

www.chemcatchem.org outer surface further enhances the benefits of a molten overlayer.
A third concept to improve product desorption is site isola- tion, which increases the selectivity for partial-oxidation prod- ucts[68] by restricting the local availability of oxygen. Thus,labile lattice oxygen or ensembles of atoms that contain a redox-active site need to be spatially isolated. As pointed out above, active sites with more than two labile lattice oxygen atoms facilitate oxygen insertion before desorption, thus even- tually leading to COx species.[63] Thus, a good distribution of labile oxygen atoms and the limitation of the number of oxygen atoms per site help to prevent total oxidation.[60] On the other hand, single oxygen atoms on a catalytic surface are inactive or prone to the generation of allyl radicals, which react further in the gas phase.[57,68] Therefore, two labile oxygen atoms per site appear to be optimal for the highly se- lective ODH of alkanes.
4. Groups of ODH Catalysts
Having discussed the elementary steps in the ODH process, we now turn to the description of potential catalysts that are suit- able for oxidative dehydrogenation. This discussion should help to relate the potential elementary steps of reactions to specific examples of catalysts. Special attention will be paid to the structures of the active sites on different catalysts for the ODH of ethane and the common properties and differences between the various classes of catalysts.
4.1. Transition-metal oxides
4.1.1. Vanadium-oxide-based systems
Supported vanadium-oxide-based catalysts are the most inten- sively studied of these systems. The V cations may change their oxidation state between +III, +IV, and +V,[1,69] thus making the catalysts redox active, but they can also form ODH-active peroxo species.[53] In this case, the cation does not change its oxidation state. It is debated whether or not the ac- tivation of the first CH bond occurs through paired- or single- electron transfer with these catalysts.
In particular, UV/Vis and Raman spectroscopy[70,71] showed that vanadium oxide was present in the form of distinct spe- cies. VOx sites exist in their isolated or polymeric forms, either as a 2D layer of interconnected tetrahedral vanadate clusters
(VO4
3) that are connected through corners[38,72] or as dimeric pyrovanadate clusters (V2O7 4) that are connected through an oxygen atom, as shown in Figure 4.[73] To optimize the catalytic performance and to explore the re- action mechanism, many parameters, including the dispersion of the vanadate centers, the support material (thus potentially altering the acid/base properties of the catalyst), and the addi- tion of dopants or promoters, were systematically varied. The most important parameter was the variation of the dispersion of vanadium oxide on the support, which may markedly influ- ence the reactivity of the catalyst.[74] Because a consensus has not been reached on whether ter- minal V=O bonds or bridging VOAl bonds form the catalyti- cally active site, let us now introduce the two different leading paradigms,as exemplified by different experimental ap- proaches and results, followed by their specific interpretations.
Martinez-Huerta et al.[42] studied a vanadia catalyst that was supported on g-Al2O3 by using temperature-programmed re- duction, in situ Raman, IR, UV/Vis diffuse reflectance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, combined with kinetic measure- ments. By synthesizing isolated and polymeric VOx species, as well as crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles, their combination of physicochemical and catalytic measurements allowed impor- tant conclusions regarding the active site to be drawn.
Whereas at low sub-monolayer vanadia loadings, only isolat- ed surface species with three VO-support bonds and one ter- minal V=O bond were found, an increase in the vanadia load- ing resulted in the formation of polymeric vanadia species with only one VO-support bond, one V=O terminal bond, and two VO bridging bonds. Only once a surface monolayer of vanadia was present were 3D V2O5 nanoparticle crystallites formed on top of the surface monolayer.[75] The catalysts with higher vanadia loading (mostly polymeric surface vanadia spe- cies) showed the lowest reduction temperatures and, thus, the most reducible. The reduction of isolated surface vanadia spe- cies was more difficult for V2O5 nanoparticles. Interestingly, the V=O bond of the vanadia species becomes stronger with in- creasing coverage (shift from 1010 to 1023 cm1 for the main peak in the Raman spectra), even though the reducibility of the polymeric surface vanadia species was the lowest. Thus,one may conclude that the rate-determining reduction step cannot be influenced by the terminal V=O bond, thus suggest- ing that the terminal V=O bond is not the primary active site for the ODH of ethane.
Increasing the surface concentration of vanadia species,which resulted in a higher concentration of bridging VOV bonds, did not change the catalytic activity, thus suggesting that those bonds were not catalytically active for ethane acti- vation.[76,77] Because crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles tend to cata- lyze total oxidation, the lower selectivity at high V loading can be explained by the presence of such nanoparticles. However,it should be kept in mind that the V2O5 nanoparticles might undergo a solid-state reaction with the support at higher tem- peratures, thus forming AlVO4 as a new phase. In turn, this re- action would decrease the number of V-free Al2O3 sites, there- by decreasing the trend for total oxidation.[42] Thus, it was concluded that, in supported surface vanadium oxide, neither the terminal V=O bond, the bridging VOV bond, nor V2O5 nanoparticles were active in the ODH reac- tion.[42] Thus, according to that rationale, the bridging VOAl bond was the only option left and, therefore, was inferred to be the active site in this catalytic system. Other authors have accepted this argument, especially the aspect that the bridging VOV site cannot be active for the initial CH bond cleavage in the ODH of ethane.[1] DFT calculations by using well-defined vanadia clusters with the metal oxidation state +5 have been found to be an excel- lent approach for obtaining a more in-depth insight into the 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

www.chemcatchem.org reactivity.[78,79] Evaluation of the energy barriers leads to the conclusion that a hydrogen atom is abstracted through cleav- age of the V=O terminal bond, with the formation of transient radicals and, subsequently, a CV bond.[39,78,79] A bridging oxygen atom could abstract the second hydrogen atom in this case, thus resulting in ethene formation. One drawback of this theoretical experiment is that the VO-support bond is not present in the model vanadia cluster. Thus, further DFT calcula- tions were performed by using a V-substituted silsequioxane cluster with bridging oxygen atoms between the V atoms and the support cations.[79] DFT calculations showed that, even in the presence of VO-support bonds, the terminal V=O (vanad- yl) bond was the only active species for the activation and cleavage of the first CH bond.
To summarize, a consensus exists within the literature that the bridging VOV bond cannot be responsible for the acti- vation of the first CH bond. However, some discrepancies still exist between theory and experiment, that is, whether the ter- minal V=O bond or the VO-support bond is the site for the activation of the first CH bond.
The concept of site isolation assumes a special role in this context. Apparently, the spatial proximity of twobut not morevanadia centers is essential. This result agrees with the hypothesis that the bridging VOV bond does not boost the initial CH bond activation in the ODH reaction, but facilitates the second H abstraction. Thus, an ensemble of two vanadium centers seems to be the active site, regardless of whether the V=O terminal bond or the VO-support bond acts as the active site.
An investigation of the influence of different V loadings showed that, in accordance with expectations, higher V load- ing on g-Al2O3 resulted in increased activity and improved ethene selectivity.[42] This result can be explained by the fact that V-free Al2O3 cation sites exist on this catalyst, which are re- ported to be inactive for ODH but to catalyze the total oxida- tion of the olefin, mainly into CO. Thus, the acid sites of g- Al2O3 mainly contribute to the acidity of the supported catalyst at low V loadings, whereas the vanadate compounds are mainly responsible for the acidity at higher V loadings. Howev- er, in this case, only the vanadia-related acid sites are responsi- ble for product degradation towards carbon oxides.[42] The overall activity increased with the total concentration of acidic sites and with the electronegativity of the dopants.[80] However, there is an upper vanadia-loading limit beyond which the ODH yield decreases. Whereas the sites on Al2O3 should be covered at such loadings, as-formed V2O5 particles catalyze the total oxidation of ethene into CO.[42] Neither acid/ base properties nor the chemical composition show pro- nounced effects on the ODH yield.
The presence of vanadia-free Al2O3 sites leads to the ques- tion of whether other supports might be more appropriate.
Indeed,the activity of supported-vanadia-based catalysts strongly depends on the interactions with the oxide support,as well as on the structure of the support.[81] The dispersion and formation of the active sites are influ- enced by the nature of the support material. A comparison be- tween g-Al2O3 and SiO2 nicely illustrates this fact: g-Al2O3 is a better support than SiO2, owing to the better dispersion of vanadium oxide and the coordination of the V cations. Its acidic character plays a less important role in this case.[38] As discussed above, the active site (two oxygen-bridged tetrahe- drally coordinated V cations) are preferentially formed on g- Al2O3. These sites can be more easily reduced by ethane than the tetrahedrally coordinated vanadate monomers, which are mainly formed on the SiO2 support, and the octahedrally coor- dinated V species in pure V2O5.[38] Another proposed support is hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS).[82] However, the influence of the V loading on the cata- lytic performance was explored with respect to the ODH of propane. Up to 3.2 wt.% V, the ODH activity increased with the V content. Above 3.2 wt.% V, the reaction selectivity and yield decreased. This result can be explained by the detection and characterization of different surface vanadium-oxide species by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and UV/Vis spec- troscopy, specifically: 1) Monomeric V species in tetrahedral co- ordination (VO4) that are active and selective in the ODH reac- tion; 2) oligomeric and distorted tetrahedral vanadium-oxide species (both up to 3.2 wt.% V) that are highly active but less selective; and 3) aggregated vanadium-oxide clusters with oc- tahedral coordination (VO6) that have low activity and selectivi- ty. These results confirm that a high V dispersion is crucial for catalytic performance. Moreover, in this case, the spatial sepa- ration of the vanadate centers (site isolation) is a key feature in determining activity and selectivity.[57,68] Another potential catalyst support for vanadate species is the inexpensive and relatively stable MgO and this catalyst has been the subject of several studies.[77,80,83] Klisinska et al. stud- ied catalysts with a formal concentration of 1.5 monolayers of vanadium oxide and compared MgO to SiO2 as a support. Dop- ants, such as K, P, Ni, Cr, Nb, and Mo, influenced the acid/base and redox properties but did not markedly impact on the structure of the catalysts. MgO-supported catalysts formed magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V2O8)[83] as a sole V-containing species that was either present in an amorphous bulk phase or in a thin layer on the support. Only Lewis acid sites were de- tected on these materials. Their concentration increased with the electronegativity of the dopant. Although the activities of the catalysts could not be correlated to their acid/base proper- ties, their selectivity depended on the dopant. The main by- product in the ODH of ethane was CO2, whereas CO was only formed in trace amounts.
As MgO is known to have basic sites and vanadate species,together with the fact that pure V2O5 des not show any basic sites,[43] the surface acidity and basicity (the acid/base charac- ter) of the vanadium species do not seem to have a crucial impact on the reaction. However, the acid/base properties of the support may have an impact on the reactivity, which will be explained below.
Chao et al. investigated MgO as a support by comparing two groups of mixed-metal oxides, that is, mesostructured Mg/ V oxide and a mixed oxide that was prepared by a solid-state reaction between MgO and V2O5. For both systems, activity in- creased with Mg content, but the selectivity for ethene de- creased. In comparison, the mesostructured oxides were more 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

www.chemcatchem.org active and selective. Again, this result can be explained by the highly dispersed Mg species in the V2O3 phase and the high surface areas. Mg species are assumed to lower the redox ca- pacities of V-containing species, thereby influencing the activa- tion of ethane.[40] The influence of the oxidation state of the vanadia species becomes important if the ODH on vanadia-based systems is in- itiated by the transfer of paired electrons. For this mechanism,two vanadia centers have to cooperate as shown in Figure 6.
Whereas only V5+ could be observed in freshly calcined cata- lysts, V4+ was also detected on used catalysts, especially after experiments with high conversion levels. Thus, V4+ species alone seem to favor deep oxidation and, as a consequence,lead to lower selectivities for the olefin. In passing, a V5+/V4+ ratio of 1:1 yields the maximum selectivity in O-insertion reactions.[84] Let us now return to the doping of vanadia-containing cata- lysts as a means to improve the catalytic performance. Galli et al. studied the effect of K+ doping into an Al2O3-supported vanadia catalyst.[85] The incorporation of K+ ions lowers the re- ducibility of vanadia catalysts. The olefin selectivity in the ODH of ethane decreased, but, for example, increased in the ODH of n-butane. The concentration of acidic sites decreased with in- creasing K+ incorporation, thus suggesting that acidic sites favor the ODH reactions of short alkanes, whereas basic sites favor the ODH reactions of longer paraffins.
Other promising catalyst systems include V-containing alu- minophosphates (also doped with Co and Mg).[8688] These active sites, because V and other metals were incorporated into the microporous aluminophosphate framework, have been shown, for example, by Concepcin et al. for AlPO-5 frameworks that contained V, Co, and Mg.
Co-APO-5 has been explored in depth, because it should have the most pronounced redox and acidic properties. This catalyst was active and selective and CoV-APO-5 was even much more active for the ODH of ethane. This result was at- tributed somewhat vaguely to the cooperation between V and Co sites. A redox couple was assumed to form, but the acidic character of this pair was assumed to change during the reac- tion. A similar catalyst, VCoAPO-18, which contained V and Co in an AEI structure, led to two different redox pairs (V5+/V4+ and Co3+/Co2+). In both cases, the crystal structure and the presence of the second Co3+/Co2+ redox pair change the redox properties of the V species. The metal cations also serve as Lewis acid sites. The catalyst even shows a higher selectivity than the AFI material. ODH reactions over these catalysts pro- ceed through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The presence of acidic sites close to the redox center favors a fast desorption of the olefin intermediates from the catalyst, thus leading to high selectivity for ethene.[86] Too-high V loadings lead to the formation of extra-framework VO species, thus favoring total oxidation. Thus, ideal catalysts have a high degree of incorpo- ration of Co and V into the framework.
The insertion of Mg into the VAPO-5 framework, which is known to create acidic sites,[89] resulted in a notable increase in olefin selectivity compared to the Mg-free catalyst (59.7% versus 32.1% at T=6008C and a conversion of about 28%).[88] This example shows again that the spatial proximity of acidic sites to the redox center promotes the desorption of olefin in- termediates, thus leading to a lower total oxidation rate and higher olefin selectivity at the same conversion.[88] The identical conversion indicates that the redox sites are active for the par- affin transformation and the improved selectivity in the pres- ence of acidic sites shows that acidic sites are not directly in- volved in the redox cycle, but rather facilitate the desorption step.[9095] This assumption is corroborated by the fact that only low olefin selectivities are reported in V/Mg-oxide based catalysts with MgOV pairs, but without the presence of acidic sites.[88,96] Thus, it can be concluded that the spatial proximity of acidic and redox sites within a molecular-sieve framework is especial- ly positive for ODH reactions. However, the behavior of acidic sites must not be compared with the influence of acidic sites in vanadia species that are supported on bulk oxides, in which acidic centers on the support favor an unselective conversion of ethane.
Phosphorus is another known dopant. One example is (VO)2P2O7, both in bulk and supported on TiO2.[97] The support- ed catalyst contains highly dispersed (VO)2P2O7 and yields a per- formance that is one order of magnitude higher than the un- supported catalyst. The incorporation of P is another approach for changing the reducibility of V. The strong interactions with TiO2 increase the reducibility of V by decreasing the metal oxygen bond strength (see Section 3.3.1), thereby leading to very active catalysts.
4.1.2. Mo-based systems
As with V oxides, Mo oxides are also active for the ODH of ethane.[98101] However, similar to vanadia systems, a consensus regarding the nature of the active site has not been reached.
On the one hand, the active site has been concluded to be a molybdenyl group, which activates the first CH bond, in- ducing a homolytic cleavage through a single-electron process,because it has been shown that the activity depends on the concentration of Mo=O bonds.[1,22] On the other hand, different authors have studied Al-supported Mo systems, which have suggested that the anchoring of MoO-support bonds is criti- cal for the ODH reactivity, thus suggesting that oxygen atoms between the support and the molybdenum species are re- sponsible for the catalytic activity.[102] Mo can be used on a Si/Ti mixed-oxide support.[103105] The olefin selectivity is especially increased if Cl ions are added.[106108] This increase is explained by the formation of more-complex ligand structures that contain Mo=O species on SiO2, whereas the formation of these species is hindered on TiO2. The addition of Cl ions seems to accelerate olefin de- sorption by weakening the interactions with ethene, thus limit- ing its further oxidation. Cl ions also lower the oxidation po- tential of the catalyst by lowering the redox potential of Mo4+ ions,[107] thus leading to a lower mobility of lattice oxygen atoms. As a result, the addition of Cl ions leads to strongly bound ethyl species and more weakly bound acetate and for- 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

4.1.3. Mixed-oxide-based systems
Mixed-oxide-based systems appear to be better suited to ad- justing the redox potential and acting cooperatively than single oxides.[64,109,110] One of the most popular mixed-oxide system is based on Mo/V oxides. Mo appears to be particularly active if employed together with V on a mesoporous Al2O3 support.[98] However, the main active species is still V. Mo and V do not interact with each other, but the monomeric or poly- meric tetrahedral Mo species cover the unselective support sites, thus increasing the selectivity.
It has been reported that such a catalyst, with an ortho- rhombic Mo3VOx structure, is very active. The high reactivity has been associated to the formation of pentagonal Mo6O21 units. The arrangement of these units leads to heptagonal channels, which constitute micropores. It is speculated that the catalytic reaction proceeds within these pores.[111] More-complex systems contain the oxides of V, Mo, Sb, and Nb, which are mainly prepared by hydrothermal synthesis.[112] MoVNbOx and MoVSbTe are reported to be very active and se- lective in the ODH of ethane.[3,113,114] The catalysts generally consist of two crystalline phases, that is, the orthorhombic M1 phase, (AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56 (A=Te, Sb; M=Mo, V, Nb; 0<x< 1), and the distorted orthorhombic M2 phase, A2OM6O19 (A= Te, Sb; M=Mo, V, Nb). Further phases have also been found,that is, TeMo5O16/Sb4Mo10Ox,(V,Nb)xMo5xO14,and bronze phases.[113] However, the occurrence of a third phase depends on the synthesis method.[115] Notably, ethene has a low reactivity, owing to its low affinity to the M1 phase, which is rich in MoO and VO pairs that have been reported to be the active sites for the ODH of ethane. However, for the oxidation of ethene, MoTe sites or MoNb sites seem to be required, because they form stronger interactions with olefins.[113] Botella et al. studied MoVTeNbOx catalysts that were pre- pared by using different methods.[110,115] For MoVTeNbOx mixed-oxide catalysts, cooperation between two crystalline phases was suggested to explain the structure of an active site that was assembled from the multifunctional Te2M20O57 ortho- rhombic phase and the Mo5O14 phase. The orthorhombic phase contained pentagonal bipyramidic sites and Te-contain- ing hexagonal pores.[110] The catalyst operated at 3408C with around 20% conversion and an ethene selectivity of around 97%. The calcination temperature was crucial for the formation of the above-mentioned phases. Similarly, for MoVSbOx cata- lysts, the (SbO)2M20O56 phase is highly active and selective (around 65% conversion and 80% selectivity). Mo/V-based sys- tems have also been reported to be active if they are promot- ed with Al, Ga, Bi,[116] and Ce.[117]
4.1.4. Ni- and Co-based systems
NiO-based catalysts are suitable materials for the ODH reaction that operate at relatively low temperatures (3004008C). Pure NiO is very reactive towards ethane; however, it exhibits low selectivity for the ODH of ethane. The selectivity dramatically improves if supported on an oxide (Al2O3,[118] ZrO2 [119]) or if used as bulk mixed oxide that was doped with promoters,such as Nb and Sn.[19,120124] NiO that is supported on Al2O3 strongly interacts with the support, thereby forming a non-stoichiometric surface nickel- aluminate phase. At higher loadings, capping islands of NiO particles of increasing size begin to form on top of the nickel/ alumina interface. The interactions with alumina adjust the electronic properties of NiO such that the decreased oxygen mobility leads to highly selective catalysts.
The promotion of supported and unsupported NiO-based systems by the addition of metals cations, including Mo, V, Nb, Ta, Co, Li, Mg, Al, Ga, and Ti, is possible.[86,87] The most selective catalysts are based on Ni/Nb oxides, which achieve ethene se- lectivities of around 90% and remain almost constant at con- version levels of up to 20%. A maximum yield of 46% has been reported at 4008C. Ni cations are speculated to be active sites for
CH
activation,with Nb affecting the oxygen species.[19] Pure NiO predominantly produces electrophilic O2 and O species, as well as nucleophilic O2 species, on its surface.[125] The addition of Nb results in the elimination of the electrophil- ic oxygen species that are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane. Thus, the selectivity towards the olefin is improved by Nb acting as an electron donor. Other dopants increase or decrease the presence of unselective electrophilic oxygen spe- cies.[122] A systematic study of a series of NiO-based mixed oxides with doping metals that varied from low (+1) to high valence (+5) showed that the dissolution of cations with lower/equal valence to nickel (Li+, Mg2+) increased the amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen species in NiO, whereas the higher-valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+) acted as electron donors and decreased the concentration of positive p+ holes and, consequently, the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor.[122] The ODH of ethane on the NiNbO catalyst follows a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. Importantly, the redox cycle proceeds through a change in the oxidation state of Ni, where- as Nb does not change its oxidation state. In particular, at large concentrations of Nb (above 15 wt.%), the re-oxidation of Ni2+ can be retarded by the Nb atoms, thereby decreasing the catalytic activity of NiNbO compared to pure NiO.[118,126] However, the addition of Nb decreases the concentration of electrophilic oxygen species, thereby increasing the olefin selectivity.[127,128] Notably, an optimum of the reactant partial pressures exists.
Low O2 partial pressures lead to high olefin selectivities, where- as a minimum O2 pressure is needed to keep the catalyst in its fully oxidized state.[129] If a catalyst contains more than 15% Nb, it is deactivated.
This result is related to the formation of a NiNb2O6 phase,which is thermodynamically stable under the employed ODH reaction temperatures,but is not active for the
ODH
reaction.[128] 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim ChemCatChem 0000, 00, 1  23 &13& These are not the final page numbers!

www.chemcatchem.org Nickel oxide can be used in combination with ceria as a mixed-oxide catalyst.[123] Low concentrations of Ce (Ni/Ce>6) lead to a marked increase in catalyst activity and selectivity compared to pure NiO. This increase is related to an increase in the specific surface area and a decrease in reducibility. The addition of higher concentrations of ceria (Ni/Ce=0.20.3) changes the mechanism. In this case, ceria is responsible for transportation of the oxygen species from the bulk to the sur- face, thus forming both NiO and Ce1xNixO2, and leads to a faster re-oxidation of Ni.
Tungsten is also used to promote NiO.[122] The activity de- creases with increasing W content, thus indicating that the active sites are associated with accessible Ni cations. Again, W- rich and Ni-rich systems behave differently: W-rich systems mainly form NiWO4 and WO3, whereas Ni-rich systems mainly form NiO and WOx species. W-rich systems favor ethane de- composition, thus decreasing the selectivity for ethane during the ODH reaction. However, Ni-rich catalysts show higher ethene selectivity than pure Ni-based catalysts, but also lower activity. These catalysts contain small NiO and WOx particles,with the latter species assumed to block unselective sites of NiO.
Besides Ni, Co is also an interesting material for the ODH of ethane. However, Co2+ ions cannot be easily reduced; thus, the ODH of ethane does not follow the typical Marsvan Krevelen mechanism.[41] Redox properties are associated with adsorbed surface-oxygen species, with Co2+ ions acting as a non-redox- active center.[130] These species may be modified by interac- tions between Co2+ ions as the active phase and a TiO2 sup- port.[131] Catalysts that contained various Co and P[130] concen- trations showed the best performance, with the optimal results achieved with 7.6 wt.% Co. Whereas the catalyst deactivated to form a Co/Ti species, a maximum steady-state yield of
13.3% was achieved at a conversion of around 25% and a se-
lectivity of around 60%. Detailed characterization showed that the active species was Co2+ ions in octahedral coordination.
Co-BaCO3 was explored with CO2 as the oxidant instead of
O2. At 6508C, ethane conversion reached 48% with 92.2%
olefin selectivity.[132] The use of CO2 decreased the flammability of the reactants and eliminated the total oxidation of ethane and ethene. Moreover, coke could still be removed from the catalyst through the reduction of CO2 and the partial oxidation of C. The active sites are reducible Co4+O species. On the other hand, BaCO3 is assumed to form defect centers and trapped electrons, which activate O2 for the ODH reaction. Co- operation between BaCO3 and BaCoO3, as both a redox-active metal and a source of active oxygen species, is assumed to be one reason for the good activity and selectivity of this catalyst,which is a good example of cooperation between sites, as dis- cussed in Section 3.3.2.
4.2. Rare-earth-metal oxides
These catalysts typically consist of La2O3, Sm2O3, CeO2, and Pr6O11.[30,133136] Promotion with Na[30] and CaO[137,138] has also been investigated. The cleavage of the first CH bond occurs through a single-electron process and the catalysts belong to the group of non-redox-active materials. The main catalytic function is the production of ethyl radicals, which are released into the gas phase, with ethene and CO as the main carbon- containing products.[30] The catalysts were operated between 6008C and 9008C and the selectivity was around 50%; both the conversion and selectivity for the olefins increased with temperature. This result is thought to be related to the release of ethyl radicals, which increasingly takes place at elevated temperatures. Enhancing the release rates implies that fewer ethoxy species (intermediates of CO2 production) exist on the surface at the steady state.[30] The addition of alkali-earth/alkali metals to rare-earth oxides improves the catalytic performance.[139] A Sm2O3 catalyst that is doped with 10% Na+ cations shows a notably higher selectivi- ty than a pure Sm2O3 catalyst. For both catalysts, olefin selec- tivity decreases with increasing oxygen concentration; howev- er, this effect is not as pronounced for Na+-doped catalysts than for pure Sm2O3. Whereas ethene and CO are the main products with rare-earth oxides, CO2 is observed instead of CO in the presence of Na+ cations. This result suggests that the formation of lattice oxygen species plays a role in the activa- tion of the alkane and it points to the operation of a heteroge- neous surface-catalyzed mechanism.
This trend is even more clear in the case of La2O3.[30] Adding Sr+ ions to rare-earth oxides leads to a marked increase in ac- tivity and selectivity. At 7008C, Sr2O3 on neodymium oxide is the optimal catalyst in terms of activity and selectivity, whereas Sr+-doped CeO2 and praseodymium oxides show the poorest performance.[139] Rare-earth oxides are either employed as bulk materials or on a MgO support, being per se also a potential catalyst for the ODH of ethane. By comparing the performance of Sm2O3- covered MgO with that of pure MgO, it is interesting that Sm2O3 does not increase the catalytic activity, although it in- creases the specific surface area. However, covering MgO in the same way with La2O3 strongly enhances the catalytic activi- ty. This result cannot be explained by only surface stabilization at higher specific surface areas; thus, the intrinsic activity of the catalyst seems to be drastically improved by La3+ species.[30] CeO2 is an exception because it has two oxidation states in the catalytic cycle. Ceria-based catalysts are unique because CO2 can be used as an oxidant.[137] However, higher tempera- tures are required for the activation of CO2 compared to oxygen.[140] In this case, a combination of a homogeneous and heterogeneous mechanisms is assumed. For the heterogene- ous catalyst part, Ce4+ species are reduced by ethane into Ce3+ species, thus supplying oxygen, and are re-oxidized through the reduction of CO2. CeO2 plays a role not only because of its redox properties, but also because of its oxygen-storage ca- pacity. To further improve the catalytic performance, the addi- tion of Ca2+ ions to Ce4+ ions increases the oxygen-ion mobility of CeO2, as well as contributes to a higher surface basicity,thus leading to faster olefin desorption (higher olefin selectivi- ty).[137] Interestingly, olefin desorption is accelerated in the presence of basic sites on this class of catalysts, in contrast to redox-active catalysts, in which acid sites that are in spatial 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

www.chemcatchem.org proximity to redox pairs favor olefin desorption, as mentioned before.
The improvement of the catalytic performance of rare-earth oxides can also be achieved by the addition of halides.[141144] Au and co-workers reported that the addition of 50 mol% BaCl2 to Ho2O3 [141] lowered the reactivity of the oxygen species and, thus, favored the activation of the weaker CH bond in ethane (410 kJmol1) instead of the CH bond in ethene (452 kJmol1). Raman spectroscopy showed that the intensity of the bands of O2 species was higher for the BaCl2-containing catalyst compared to pure Ho2O3. Thus, the addition of BaCl2 resulted in a higher storage capacity and activation activity of O2 species. Again, a higher concentration of basic sites, which was induced by the addition of BaCl2, decreased the adsorp- tion of ethene and, thus, the total oxidation of ethane. It can be inferred that intrinsically weaker adsorption and site-isola- tion are the key concepts for avoiding the re-adsorption of ethane onto these catalysts, thus, maintaining high selectivi- ties. Cation substitution of Ho3+ and Ba2+ is assumed to create oxygen defects that are active for O2 activation. A similar phe- nomenon is observed on Sm2O3/LaF3 catalysts by promotion with BaF3.[142]
4.3. Supported alkali oxides
The simplest and most prominent catalytic system in this class is MgO-supported Li2O.[145] In general, such oxides belong to the group of non-redox-active catalysts. However, it is not yet known whether the first CH bond is activated through a single-electron process or a paired-electron process.[1] The active site has been concluded to be [Li+O], thus form- ing defects on the MgO surface. The fact that [Li+O] sites pos- sess labile O species is of special importance, because the ODH activity notably decreases upon catalyst deoxygenation. The O species is assumed to abstract the first hydrogen atom. Evi- dence was found that Li+ ions formed clusters on the MgO sur- face, but it was concluded that the Li2O domains on MgO did not show classical redox properties.[34,146] It should be empha- sized that Li+ ions that are incorporated into a MgO matrix are also active and selective and can be prepared by a solgel synthesis.[147] The reaction is assumed to proceed through radi- cal chain reactions, by following a homogeneous/heterogene- ous reaction pathway. The catalyst essentially serves as an ele- ment to initiate the radical chain mechanism.[34] In contrast to these conclusions and the assumption that [Li+O] is the active site, Freund and co-workers concluded that the paramagnetic [Li+O] species did not exist under the reaction conditions, because the species were not detected by EPR spectroscopy.[35,148,149] Li+ ions have been found to intro- duce oxygen vacancies into the MgO matrix. At higher Li+ con- centrations, Li/Mg-oxide islands and LixO surface clusters form.
However, Li can desorb into the gas phase at elevated temper- atures (>7808C), thus resulting in the formation of surface de- fects. Therefore, despite suggesting that [Li+O] sites may form under non-equilibrium conditions, Myrach et al. raised doubts that these are active for the ODH of ethane.[35] The addition of halide anions (Cl, Br) further enhances ac- tivity and selectivity.[31,150,151] The active sites in the halide-pro- moted materials have not been unequivocally identified. Wang et al. suggest that Li2O is the catalytically active phase,[152] with LiCl forming a thin layer between the support and the catalyti- cally active phase, which modifies the base strength and sup- presses the formation of Li2CO3. Fuchs et al. concluded that the active site consisted of a Li+ cation and nucleophilic oxygen species.[21] The addition of CO2 to these catalysts mark- edly decreases the ODH activity, thus suggesting that carbon- ate formation indeed blocks the active sites. Gaab et al. provid- ed a detailed differentiation between Cl-free and Cl-contain- ing catalysts.[32] They postulated that hypochlorite (OCl) anions formed in the LiCl melt, thus providing a transient,highly reactive site with dissolved O2.
Alternatively, a combined surface/gas-phase mechanism has been suggested, similar to the one for Cl-free catalysts.[6] However, this mechanism cannot explain the increasing selec- tivity towards ethene with temperature. A third approach in- vokes a surface-catalyzed pathway,[32] thus suggesting that the non-selective sites are covered or dissolved in the molten over- layer.
For Cl-free catalysts, surface ethyl radical formation and a gas phase radical reaction pathway dominate. The initial acti- vation of ethane to form an alkyl radical in the gas phase is considered to be rate determining. However, at partial pres- sures of above 70 mbar, the reaction order decreases, which is attributed to saturation of the active site.
4.4. Supported alkali chlorides
Whereas supported alkali-oxide catalysts show certain disad- vantages, including inhibition by CO2 and limited selectivity,materials with an overlayer of molten alkali chloride and no ad- dition of alkali oxide have been reported to be catalytically active for the ODH of ethane.[51,67] Supported liquid-phase cata- lysts (SLC) are a new generation of catalysts for the ODH of ethane, which requires comparatively high reaction tempera- tures (around 6008C). However, very high selectivities for ethane (up to 95%) can be achieved. The first CH bond is cleaved homolytically in a single electron-transfer process.
Activity and selectivity have been reported for catalysts with overlayers of pure alkali chlorides and several eutectica[153] of alkali chlorides, such as LiCl, KCl, NaCl, LiKCl, LiNaCl, Li SrCl, and LiBaCl, that are supported on (Dy2O3-promoted) MgO.[51,67] Whereas LiCl leads to the most active catalysts,these catalysts are also the least selective. The selectivity to- wards ethene inversely depends on the melting point of the chloride. A linear increase in the selectivity with temperature is observed below the melting point, whereas it remains essen- tially constant above the melting point. Metal cations are pre- sumably inactive towards CH activation, but they influence the catalytic behavior of the molten chloride overlayer. The oxygen solubility is the highest for LiCl,[51] whereas larger cat- ions (Na+, K+) lead to fewer dissolved oxygen species.[154,155] Ethane solubilities in the highly polar melt are negligible.[67] 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

www.chemcatchem.org It has been speculated that dissolved O2 in the molten chlo- ride reacts to form positively charged Cl atoms.[1] In turn, a tran- sient hypochlorite species (OCl) is assumed to catalyze the ODH reaction. The hypochlorite anion itself has a high redox potential and is supposed to form at the interface between the chloride melt and the solid support [Eq. (14)]. 2 LiClmoltenO2dissolved ! 2 LiOCldissolved 14 Hypochlorite is assumed to be the transient species in low concentrations and diffuses within the melt to the surface, on which it activates the CH bond. Because those anions are sur- rounded by alkali cations, spatial separation occurs within the melt, which causes the active sites to be well-dispersed and prevents mutual interactions.
However, the exact mechanism is still matter of debate. Cl radicals are not thought to play a role in alkane activation, nei- ther as initiator nor as radical-chain propagator, and the forma- tion of HCl bonds are unlikely. A key aspect of the adsorption properties of the melt is the Lewis acidity of the cations. The addition of, for example, K+ ions, lowers the average Lewis acidity compared to that of pure Li. Thus, the improved olefin selectivity in the presence of alkali/alkali-earth chlorides of the LiClMgDyO catalyst is speculated to be associated with a decrease in the strength of the Lewis acid.
4.5. Other catalysts
One of the most promising groups of catalysts is based on Ni, Cu, and Fe (cation)-loaded Y-zeolites.[156] In this case, the first CH bond is also assumed to be cleaved homolytically through a single electron transfer.
Acidic catalysts were prepared by ion exchange with metal sulfates and subsequent reduction with hydrogen. For basic catalysts, an additional ion exchange with KOH was performed.
Acidic zeolites were significantly better than basic zeolites in terms of conversion and ethane selectivity. Ni-based materials showed the best performance, followed by Cu and Fe; the best catalyst (Ni on acidic Y-zeolite) showed an ethane conver- sion of 21% and ethene selectivity of 75% at 6008C. Ethene selectivity increased with increasing temperature. With acidic zeolites, ethane oxidation (leading to ethene) dominated over ethane combustion, whereas basic zeolites favored ethane combustion.
For the ODH reactions of transition-metal-supported zeolites,two mechanisms are proposed.[156] The first proposal suggests that two surface oxygen atoms react with ethane, thus forming one surface metalethoxide group and one surface hydroxy group. The metal ethoxide can then undergo two subsequent reactions, that is, a-hydrogen abstraction, thereby forming an aldehyde plus a metal hydride, or b-hydrogen abstraction,thereby leading to ethene plus a metalhydroxy group.
The second possibility is the formation of a metalethyl complex plus a surface hydroxy group after one ethane mole- cule reacts with one surface oxide group. Subsequently, b-hy- drogen abstraction takes place, thus forming ethene plus a metal hydride. Various techniques have been applied to ad- dress the dominating mechanism,[156,157] although it could not be clarified whether the reaction took place through an ethoxyhydroxy mechanism or an ethyl radical. However, it was shown that ethoxy groups were not stable at elevated temperatures.[157] Carbon materials, in particular carbon nanotubes, have also been reported to be active. However, these catalysts appear to be challenging to use and ethane conversions of below 5% have been reported at 4008C; the use of higher reaction tem- peratures is seen as problematic, because of the potential oxi- dation of the catalyst. This problem can be mediated by sur- face modification with B2O3 or P2O5, which have the positive side effect of decreasing the concentration of electrophilic oxygen species, thereby increasing the selectivity. The nature of the active sites is not defined and their concentration is too low to be successfully characterized.[158]
4.6. Conclusions
Table 1 provides a synopsis of a selection of active sites that have been presented in this Section (only the basic types of sites are shown). The characteristics of the sites and the specif- ic mechanisms are compiled, together with their typical reac- tion temperatures and selectivities. A complete list of the refer- enced catalysts, including their performance, is presented in the final Section.The redox-active site is either a cation redox pair (such as V5+/V4+) or an anion redox pair (such as OCl/Cl). High dilu- tion of the sites and higher acid strength appear to promote desorption of the ethyl species and favor selectivity. The sites with metal redox functionality require lower temperatures Table 1. Different active sites for the ODH of ethane.
