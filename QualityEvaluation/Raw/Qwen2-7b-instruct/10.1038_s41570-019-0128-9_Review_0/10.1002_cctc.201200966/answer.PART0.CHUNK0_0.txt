<p>The recurring increase in the price of crude oil and, in partic- ular, the availability of ethane in shale gas, has advanced the interest in alternative processes for ethene production, includ- ing the dehydration of ethanol (thus enabling the utilization of biomass-derived feeds) and the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of ethane. This latter process offers conceptual advantages and,therefore, has been the subject of substantial research activi- ties. However, the lack of suitable catalysts that combine high activity and selectivity has prevented their industrial realization so far.</p>
<p>Several excellent reviews have broadly addressed ODH reac- tions.[610] Because of the special role of the ODH of ethane and its potential process applications, we have decided to take a different approach. Therefore, this Review summarizes the current state of ethene production as a baseline for the poten- tial and challenges that face the development of new process- es. This Review also describes insight on the atomic and mo- lecular levels, as well as into the ongoing developments in cat- alytic processes and reactor engineering.</p>
<p>The increasing demand for light olefins and the changing nature of basic feedstock has stimulated substantial research activity into the development of new process routes. Steam cracking remains the most industrially relevant pathway, but other routes for light-olefin production have emerged. Fluid catalytic cracking only produces ethene in minor concentra- tions. Challenged by marked catalyst deactivation, in contrast,catalytic dehydrogenation ethane up opens a more selective route to ethene. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane, which couples the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the strongly exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, would po- tentially be the most attractive alternative route because it avoids the need for excessive internal heat input, but also con- sumes valuable hydrogen. In this Review, the current state of the ODH of ethane is compared with other routes for light- olefin production, with a focus on the catalyst and reactor system variants. New catalyst systems and reactor designs have been developed to improve the industrial competitive- ness of the ODH reaction of ethane. The current state of our fundamental understanding of the ODH of light alkanes, in particular in terms of catalyst and reactor development, is criti- cally reviewed. The proposed mechanisms and the nature of the active site for the ODH reaction are described and dis- cussed in detail for selected promising catalysts. The reported catalytic performance and the possible limitations of these ODH catalysts will be examined and the performance of the emerging approaches is compared to the currently practiced methods.</p>
