How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

The increasing demand for light olefins and the changing nature of basic feedstock has stimulated substantial research activity into the development of new process routes. Steam cracking remains the most industrially relevant pathway, but other routes for light-olefin production have emerged. Fluid catalytic cracking only produces ethene in minor concentrations. Challenged by marked catalyst deactivation, in contrast,catalytic dehydrogenation ethane up opens a more selective route to ethene. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane, which couples the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the strongly exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, would po- tentially be the most attractive alternative route because it avoids the need for excessive internal heat input, but also con- sums valuable hydrogen. In this Review, the current state of the ODH of ethane is compared with other routes for light- olefin production, with a focus on the catalyst and reactor system variants. New catalyst systems and reactor designs have been developed to improve the industrial competitive- ness of the ODH reaction of ethane. The current state of our fundamental understanding of the ODH of light alkanes, in particular in terms of catalyst and reactor development, is criti- cally reviewed. The proposed mechanisms and the nature of the active site for the ODH reaction are described and dis- cussed in detail for selected promising catalysts. The reported catalytic performance and the possible limitations of these ODH catalysts will be examined and the performance of the emerging approaches is compared to the currently practiced methods.

Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 can affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The choice of support material can alter the surface properties and the interaction of the catalyst with the reactants, impacting the reaction kinetics and selectivity. Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, can influence the extent of CO2 activation and the formation of reactive intermediates, thus affecting the overall catalytic performance. Challenges in optimizing the performance of these catalysts often revolve around balancing factors such as activity, selectivity, and stability, while minimizing unwanted side reactions like CO2 consumption or catalyst deactivation. Key trade-offs may include selecting a support that enhances the catalyst's activity while maintaining selectivity, optimizing the operating conditions to maximize product yield, and ensuring the catalyst's stability over repeated cycles.

各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，可以影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理。不同支持材料可以改变表面性质和催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用，从而影响反应动力学和选择性。反应条件，特别是CO2分压，可以影响CO2的活化程度和活性中间体的形成，进而影响整体催化性能。优化这些催化剂性能的挑战往往在于平衡活性、选择性和稳定性等因素，同时尽量减少不必要的副反应，如CO2消耗或催化剂失活。关键的权衡可能包括选择增强催化剂活性的同时保持选择性的支持材料，优化操作条件以最大化产品产率，并确保催化剂在循环过程中的稳定性。
