[1] "The use of different support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions can significantly influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. These materials affect the interaction between the metal oxide and the reactants, modifying the surface properties and potentially changing the reaction pathways."

[2] "Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, play a critical role in determining the efficiency of CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation. Higher CO2 partial pressures can lead to enhanced CO2 uptake and reaction rates, but may also challenge the catalyst's stability due to increased oxidative stress."

[3] "Optimizing the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation involves balancing multiple factors, including the choice of support material, reaction conditions, and the catalyst's design. Key challenges include achieving high activity and selectivity, maintaining stability under harsh reaction conditions, and ensuring economic feasibility."
