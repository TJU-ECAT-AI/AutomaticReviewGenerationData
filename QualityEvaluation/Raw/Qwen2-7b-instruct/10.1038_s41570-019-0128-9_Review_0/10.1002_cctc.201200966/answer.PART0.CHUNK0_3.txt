[1] "The recurring increase in the price of crude oil and, in partic- ular, the availability of ethane in shale gas, has advanced the interest in alternative processes for ethene production, includ- ing the dehydration of ethanol (thus enabling the utilization of biomass-derived feeds) and the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODH) has not been implemented on a large scale yet. Its conceptual advantage over dehydro- genation, that is, high ethane conversion, potentially lower re- action temperatures (about 4006008C) as compared to steam cracking, and the fact that the reaction is exothermic, has spur- red growing interest in this process."

1. The interest in alternative processes for ethene production, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, has grown due to the high conversion of ethane, potentially lower reaction temperatures, and the exothermic nature of the reaction.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane offers conceptual advantages over traditional dehydrogenation processes, including high ethane conversion, lower reaction temperatures, and the exothermic nature of the reaction.

3. The use of N2O as an oxidant can reduce the activity of vanadia catalysts compared to O2, due to the slower re-oxidation of reduced vanadia sites.

4. The role of oxygen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, particularly in the re-oxidation of reduced vanadia sites, is crucial for the activity and selectivity of the catalysts.

5. The active site for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is still debated, with different mechanisms proposed involving single or paired electrons.

6. The cleavage of the first carbon-hydrogen bond in ethane can occur either homolytically or heterolytically, depending on the mechanism.

7. A single-electron process involving unpaired electrons is one way the first carbon-hydrogen bond can be cleaved.

8. A paired-electron process, involving the transfer of two electrons, is another way the first carbon-hydrogen bond can be cleaved.

9. Rare-earth oxides and alkali oxides can generate radicals on the surface, which then propagate in the gas phase.

10. The single-electron process for activating the first carbon-hydrogen bond is unique to vanadium-containing catalysts.

11. The active site for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, in supported vanadium oxide systems, is inferred to be the bridging VOV bond.

12. Site isolation plays a significant role in determining the activity and selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.

13. The presence of vanadia-free Al2O3 sites raises the question of whether other support materials might be more suitable for catalysts.

14. The activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts is greatly influenced by their interactions with the oxide support and the structure of the support.

15. The addition of Cl ions accelerates olefin desorption by weakening interactions with ethene, thus limiting further oxidation.

16. The spatial proximity of acidic sites to the redox center facilitates the desorption of olefin intermediates, resulting in lower total oxidation rates and higher olefin selectivity.

17. Acidic sites in vanadium oxide catalysts supported on bulk oxides favor an unselective conversion of ethane, unlike those in molecular sieve frameworks.

18. The strong interactions with TiO2 reduce the metal-oxygen bond strength, enhancing the reducibility of vanadium and leading to highly active catalysts.

19. The incorporation of K+ ions reduces the reductibility of vanadia catalysts, decreasing olefin selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane but increasing selectivity in other reactions.

20. The catalyst serves as an initiation element for radical chain reactions in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, facilitating the radical chain mechanism.
