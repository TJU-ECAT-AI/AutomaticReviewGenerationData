The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant offers a potential technology for the industrial production of alkenes, as an alternative to traditional methods of alkene production through direct dehydrogenation of alkanes, which is energy-intensive. The oxidative dehydrogenation process, when CO2 is present, presents a more environmentally friendly option compared to conventional dehydrogenation processes. This mini-review summarizes the challenges encountered in the CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation process and the development of catalytic technologies aimed at addressing these issues.
