The utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions faces challenges due to its inherent inertness. However, the application of suitable catalysts can help overcome these barriers. Various support materials, such as silica (SiO2), mesoporous materials (MCM-41, H-ZSM-5), alumina (Al2O3), zirconia (ZrO2), and ceria (CeO2), play crucial roles in enhancing the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts. The reaction conditions, particularly the CO2 partial pressure, significantly impact the overall performance of the catalysts in these processes. The specific challenges and strategies to optimize catalyst performance are discussed in this mini-review.
