As a defense lawyer in Toronto, I read with interest Portable Spectrometers Give On-Site Testing a Boost, by Carolyn Wilke (C&EN, April 17/24, 2023, page 28).
The article doesn't go into detail about the important distinction between these valuable law enforcement investigative tools and eventual proof in court to convince a judge for the criminal law requirement of beyond a reasonable doubt.
In Canadian law, there is another, more problematic concern, for which these new devices would not help. It is apparent government policy and practice to not reveal the science behind drug determinations. There is no proper scientific report.
For years, qualitative disclosure has effectively been prevented with Controlled Drugs and Substances Act s. 51. More recently, disclosure of the science behind quantitative measurements has simply been declined by Crown counsel.
This is a matter of both science policy and justice: Unexplained science is bad science for that reason alone.

The concerns raised by Michael Grossman regarding portable spectrometers pertain to the legal implications of their use in court. He notes that while these devices may be effective law enforcement tools, they do not address the issue of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in court. Specifically, he highlights the problem of nondisclosure of the scientific methods used in drug determinations, which is a matter of both scientific integrity and justice. This nondisclosure is enabled by government policies and practices, particularly sections 51 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which prevent proper scientific reporting.

迈克尔·格罗斯曼提出的关于便携式光谱仪的问题，与法庭使用这些设备的法律后果有关。他指出，尽管这些设备可能是有效的执法工具，但它们并不能解决在法庭上证明罪行证据充分的难题。具体而言，他强调了科学方法在药物鉴定中未被披露的问题，这是科学诚信和正义的一个问题。这种不披露是政府政策和实践的结果，特别是《管制毒品法》第51条，该条款阻止了进行适当的科学研究报告。

Industry membership When I read in your editorial in the April 10 issue about the decline in American Chemical Society industry memberships (page 2), a possible explanation was given in the same place. As a businessperson, Rothrock doesn't get as much out of ACS meetings as she once did.
I work in industrial R&D and attended the ACS Spring meeting in Indianapolis. It is very obvious that these meetings are heavily focused on academics. Companies send representatives to many other more industry-focused conferences and don't see the value of an academia-heavy additional conference. But in industrial conferences, companies don't share details of the chemistry they are doing with others obviously. And this is exactly the advantage of ACS meetings: most chemistry is openly shared and discussed.

Martin Glodde's perspective on American Chemical Society (ACS) industry memberships suggests that the decline could be attributed to the perceived lack of value for businesspeople attending ACS meetings compared to industry-focused conferences. He argues that while these meetings emphasize academic content, which may not align with the needs of industry professionals, ACS meetings offer the unique advantage of openly sharing and discussing chemistry across various fields. Companies often participate in industry-specific conferences where they share details of their research and developments in private settings.

马丁·格洛德对美国化学学会（ACS）工业会员资格下降的观点认为，这可能归因于商业人士认为参加ACS会议的价值不如行业专注型会议。他认为，虽然这些会议侧重于学术内容，这可能与行业专业人员的需求不完全匹配，但ACS会议的独特优势在于广泛分享和讨论化学知识。公司通常参与行业特定的会议，在那里他们可以在私密的环境中分享他们的研究和发展细节。

Slogan for ACS After reading Donna Petersons letter in the May 1 issue of C&EN (page 3), I propose that all readers of this quality publication help further craft an American Chemical Society slogan that might catch public attention. My suggestions would be Chemistry for better living on a better planet! or Better living on a better planet through chemistry!

Thomas Andrew Runge suggests creating a new slogan for the American Chemical Society that focuses on the positive impact of chemistry on society and the environment. His proposed slogans are "Chemistry for better living on a better planet!" and "Better living on a better planet through chemistry!" These slogans aim to capture public attention by highlighting the transformative power of chemistry in improving quality of life and fostering sustainability.

托马斯·安德鲁·伦奇建议为美国化学学会制定一个新口号，强调化学对社会和环境的积极影响。他提出的口号是“化学让生活更美好，地球更美好！”和“通过化学实现更美好的生活和更美好的地球！”这些口号旨在通过突出化学在提高生活质量并促进可持续发展方面的作用来吸引公众关注。
