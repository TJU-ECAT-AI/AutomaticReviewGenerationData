[1] "These new, often handheld, devices may well be better than the more traditional color tests or wet-chemistry kits."
[2] "But the article doesn't go into detail about the important distinction between these valuable law enforcement investigative tools and eventual proof in court to convince a judge for the criminal law requirement of beyond a reasonable doubt."
[3] "And it would appear that neither these new devices nor the color tests measure quantity, which may be important for eventual court determination of guilt and sentencing."
[4] "In Canadian law, there is another, more problematic concern, for which these new devices would not help. It is apparent government policy and practice to not reveal the science behind drug determinations."
[5] "As a businessperson, Rothrock doesn't get as much out of ACS meetings as she once did."
[6] "However, you know what you work on and check out related chemistry shown in talks and posters."
[7] "Students and professors happily discuss their work with you."
[8] "And the combined costs of ACS membership and conference registration are far less than the fees typically paid at many industrial conferences."
[9] "My suggestions would be Chemistry for better living on a better planet! or Better living on a better planet through chemistry!"

1. Handheld devices such as spectrometers are considered potentially superior to traditional color tests and wet-chemistry kits in forensic science, but they lack the distinction of being admissible as evidence in court due to the requirement of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. They also do not measure quantity, which can be crucial for court decisions regarding guilt and sentencing.

2. The author points out that there is a significant issue in Canadian law where the government does not disclose the scientific methods used in drug determinations, affecting both scientific integrity and justice.

3. Industry members feel that ACS meetings are less valuable compared to other industry-focused conferences because the focus is on academic presentations rather than sharing proprietary information. However, attendees still find opportunities to exchange ideas and inspiration, and the cost of membership and conferences is more affordable compared to industrial conferences.

4. The proposed slogans for the American Chemical Society emphasize the positive impact of chemistry on improving life and the environment, suggesting a broader application of chemical sciences beyond industry contexts.

1. 手持式设备如光谱仪在法医科学中可能优于传统颜色测试和湿化学试剂，但它们在法庭上作为证明有罪的证据时缺乏区分度，因为需要证明有罪超过合理怀疑。它们也不测量数量，这对于法院关于罪行和量刑的决定至关重要。

2. 作者指出，在加拿大法律中存在一个重大问题，政府不披露药物确定的科学方法，这影响了科学诚信和正义。

3. 行业成员认为美国化学学会会议的价值相比其他行业焦点会议较低，因为这些会议更侧重于学术演讲而不是分享专有信息。然而，与会者仍然有机会交换想法和灵感，并且会员费和会议注册费用比工业会议的费用要低。

4. 提议的美国化学学会口号强调化学对改善生活和环境的影响，暗示化学科学的应用范围超出了工业领域。
