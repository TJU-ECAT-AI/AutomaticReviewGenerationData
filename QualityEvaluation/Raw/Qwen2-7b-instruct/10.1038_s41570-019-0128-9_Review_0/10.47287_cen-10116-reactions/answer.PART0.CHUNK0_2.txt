As a defense lawyer in Toronto, I read with interest Portable Spectrometers Give On-Site Testing a Boost, by Carolyn Wilke (C&EN, April 17/24, 2023, page 28). These new, often handheld, devices may well be better than the more traditional color tests or wet-chemistry kits. But the article doesn’t go into detail about the important distinction between these valuable law enforcement investigative tools and eventual proof in court to convince a judge for the criminal law requirement of beyond a reasonable doubt.

The portable spectrometers mentioned in the article are superior to traditional color tests or wet-chemistry kits. However, the article does not fully explain the difference between these tools used in law enforcement and their role in providing evidence in court, which must meet the standard of 'beyond a reasonable doubt' for conviction under criminal law.

文章中提到的手持式光谱仪在性能上优于传统的颜色测试或湿化学试剂盒。然而，文章没有充分解释这些执法工具与法庭提供的证据之间的区别，这些证据必须达到刑事法律规定的“合理怀疑”的标准才能定罪。

<quotes>
It is very obvious that these meetings are heavily focused on academics. Companies send representatives to many other more industry-focused conferences and trade shows and don’t see the value of an academia-heavy additional conference. But in industrial conferences, companies don’t share details of the chemistry they are doing with othersobviously. And this is exactly the advantage of ACS meetings: most chemistry is openly shared and discussed.

ACS meetings are predominantly academic-focused, which contrasts with industry-focused conferences where companies don't share detailed chemical processes. The advantage of ACS meetings lies in the open sharing and discussion of most chemical research and developments among attendees.

ACS会议主要以学术为中心，这与专注于工业领域的会议形成对比，在后者中，公司不会分享其详细化学过程。ACS会议的优势在于允许参与者开放讨论和分享大多数化学研究和发展。
