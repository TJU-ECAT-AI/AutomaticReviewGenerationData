[1] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content."
[2] "Although Cr oxides can be incorporated into mesoporous structures to afford more active species, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates and the materials thus show greater selectivity for undesired products."
[3] "CrOx catalysts for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking."
[4] "When CrOx is on CeO2, it is less active but more stable because the reverse Boudouard reaction can readily consume coke deposits."
[5] "Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure."
[6] "The different performance between these two supports was attributed to two factors: CO2 adsorbs more strongly on γ-Al2O3 (thereby competing with C3H8 adsorption) and/or CO2 affects the acidbase properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3."
[7] "The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 has been attributed to isolated CrVI centres generated from CrIII in a redox cycle."
[8] "Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion."
[9] "Further increasing the Cr content of supported catalysts affords uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species."

How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

1. Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit optimal activity and selectivity when supported on materials like SiO2, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content. However, incorporation into mesoporous structures can lead to inactive polychromates, enhancing undesired product formation.

2. Catalysts supported on CeO2 demonstrate increased stability, as the reverse Boudouard reaction efficiently consumes coke deposits.

3. Increasing the CO2 partial pressure positively impacts the activity and selectivity of CrOx/SiO2 in CO2-ODH reactions, compared to CrOx/γ-Al2O3, which experiences decreased activity with slight CO2 pressure increase. This difference is attributed to CO2's stronger adsorption on γ-Al2O3 and its impact on the acid-base properties of the catalyst.

4. Activation of CO2 over CrOx in MCM-41 occurs via isolated CrVI centers generated from CrIII in a redox cycle. Higher Cr content enhances alkane conversion, but uneven particle distribution and aggregation lead to increased inactive polychromate species.

Challenges and trade-offs in optimizing chromium oxide catalyst performance include balancing activity and selectivity, managing stability against coke formation, and selecting the right support material to accommodate CO2 adsorption while maintaining efficient alkane activation. The redox cycling of chromium species and the formation of inactive polychromates are critical factors influencing the catalyst's overall efficiency.

各种支持材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）以及反应条件（包括CO2分压）如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径，以及优化其整体性能的关键挑战和权衡是什么？

1. 当铬氧化物催化剂被支持在具有高SiO2含量的SiO2、MCM-41和H-ZSM-5等材料上时，它们表现出最佳的活性和选择性。然而，将其引入多孔结构可能导致无活性的多铬酸盐形成，从而增加非目标产物的生成。

2. 在CeO2上的催化剂表现出更高的稳定性，因为反布杜奥反应能够有效地消耗焦炭沉积。

3. 增加CO2分压对CrOx/SiO2在CO2-ODH反应中的活性和选择性产生积极影响，而CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性则随着轻微的CO2压力增加而降低。这种差异归因于γ-Al2O3上CO2的更强吸附及其对催化剂酸基性质的影响。

4. CrOx在MCM-41上的CO2激活发生在CrIII到CrVI的红ox循环中产生的孤立CrVI中心。提高Cr含量可以增强烷烃转化率，但不均匀的颗粒分布和聚集会导致活性无价铬酸盐浓度增加。

优化铬氧化物催化剂性能的关键挑战包括平衡活性与选择性、管理对抗焦炭形成的稳定性、选择合适的支持材料以适应CO2吸附同时保持高效烷烃活化。铬物种的红ox循环和无活性聚铬酸盐的形成是影响催化剂总体效率的关键因素。

Various support materials significantly impact the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) reactions. Materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 can alter the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of these catalysts. The choice of support affects the redox activity, adsorption properties, and acid-base functionalities of the catalysts. Higher SiO2 content in supports like MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 tends to enhance the activity of chromium oxide catalysts. Different supports, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the redox states of chromium ions, leading to distinct pathways for CO2-ODH, including two-step mechanisms or single-step pathways. CO2 partial pressure and the nature of the support can affect the selectivity and conversion efficiency of the catalysts. The performance is often attributed to the ability of CO2 to compete with alkane adsorption, modifying acid-base properties, and generating active sites through redox cycling. Increasing chromium content can optimize the ratio of CrVI to CrIII species, enhancing alkane conversion rates. However, further increasing the chromium content can lead to uneven particle distributions, increased agglomeration, and the formation of inactive species, causing deactivation. Chromium catalysts face challenges due to their short life cycles and toxicity, requiring careful handling during preparation and disposal. These trade-offs necessitate a balance in support selection, chromium loading, and operational conditions to achieve optimal performance in CO2-ODH reactions.

各种支持材料对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODH）反应中的性能产生了显著影响。材料如二氧化硅、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2可以改变催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径。所选支持体影响铬离子的还原性，吸附特性和酸碱功能。MCM-41和H-ZSM-5中较高的二氧化硅含量倾向于增强铬氧化物催化剂的活性。不同的支持体，如Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，会影响铬离子的还原状态，导致CO2-ODH的不同途径，包括两步机制或单步骤途径。CO2分压和支持的性质可以影响催化剂的选择性和转化效率。性能通常归因于CO2与烷烃吸附的竞争能力，修改酸碱属性，并通过氧化还原循环生成活性位点。增加铬含量可以在优化CrVI与CrIII物种的比例的同时提高烷烃转换速率。然而，进一步增加铬含量可能导致颗粒分布不均，增加聚集，并形成无活性物种，导致催化剂失效。由于其短寿命周期和毒性，铬催化剂需要在准备和处置过程中进行仔细处理。这些权衡要求在支持选择、铬加载量和操作条件下找到平衡，以实现CO2-ODH反应的最佳性能。

1. The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are significantly influenced by the type of support material and reaction conditions. High surface area supports such as SiO2, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 enhance activity and selectivity. However, catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 exhibit lower activity due to CO2 competing with C3H8 adsorption and affecting the acid-base properties of the catalyst. Chromium oxide catalysts on CeO2 support exhibit better stability as the reverse Boudouard reaction consumes coke deposits. The choice of support impacts the distribution of reactive metal-oxide groups and the acid-base properties of the catalyst surface, which in turn affect activity and selectivity.

2. Reaction conditions, particularly the CO2 partial pressure, play a crucial role in determining the performance of chromium oxide catalysts. Increased CO2 partial pressure improves activity and C3H6 selectivity in CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, while decreasing activity in CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The different performance between supports can be attributed to CO2's stronger adsorption on γ-Al2O3, which competes with C3H8 adsorption, and CO2's effect on the acid-base properties of the catalyst surface. Doping the catalyst with Ni, which has strong chemisorption of CO2, can improve the low conversion exhibited by CrOx/SiO2 catalysts.

3. The key challenges in optimizing the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions include maintaining high selectivity for desired products, prolonging catalyst life cycles, and avoiding coking. Trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability often arise, necessitating careful selection of support materials and optimization of reaction conditions. For instance, while γ-Al2O3 supports may offer high initial selectivity, they suffer from low maximum conversion due to competing CO2 adsorption. Conversely, supports like CeO2 enhance stability but may require additional processing to maintain activity. Doping with elements like Ni can improve selectivity but may alter the acid-base properties of the catalyst surface. Balancing these factors requires a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways under varying conditions.

1. 铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径，显著受到支持材料类型和反应条件的影响。高比表面积的支持物如二氧化硅、MCM-41和H-ZSM-5能增强活性和选择性。然而，γ-Al2O3支持的催化剂由于二氧化碳与C3H8吸附的竞争作用和对催化剂表面酸碱性质的影响而表现出较低的活性。CeO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂表现出更好的稳定性，因为反布杜尔反应可以消耗焦炭沉积物。支持的选择影响了活性氧金属-氧化物组分的分布和催化剂表面的酸碱性质，进而影响活性和选择性。

2. 反应条件，特别是二氧化碳分压，对铬氧化物催化剂的性能具有关键作用。增加二氧化碳分压可以改善CrOx/SiO2催化剂的活性和C3H6选择性，同时降低CrOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂的活性。不同支持物之间的性能差异可归因于二氧化碳在γ-Al2O3上更强的吸附作用，这与C3H8吸附竞争，并且影响催化剂表面的酸碱性质。通过向催化剂中掺杂Ni等元素，该元素具有强吸碳二化碳的特性，可以改善CrOx/SiO2催化剂的低转化率问题。

3. 在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中优化铬氧化物催化剂的整体性能的关键挑战包括保持目标产品高度选择性、延长催化剂寿命周期并避免积碳。在活动性、选择性、稳定性的平衡之间经常出现权衡，需要仔细选择支持材料并优化反应条件。例如，虽然γ-Al2O3支持物可能提供较高的初始选择性，但它们的最高转化率较低，原因是与C3H8吸附的竞争作用。相反，CeO2支持可以提高稳定性，但可能需要额外处理以保持活性。掺杂Ni等元素可以改善选择性，但可能会改变催化剂表面的酸碱性质。为了实现这些目标，需要全面了解催化剂在不同条件下的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径。

The performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) reactions varies significantly based on the support material and reaction conditions. Key findings include:

1. **Support Materials Influence Activity, Selectivity, and Stability**: Chromium oxides exhibit optimal activity and selectivity when supported on materials like silica, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high silica content. Supports like gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) enable a two-step mechanism involving direct dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS), leading to deactivation through coke formation. Zirconia (ZrO2)-supported chromium oxides perform CO2-ODH in a single step, albeit competitively with oxidative dry reforming (DR), and experience deactivation through sintering or conversion into inactive chromium species. Chromium oxides on ceria (CeO2) are less active but more stable, thanks to the reverse Boudouard reaction's capability to consume coke deposits.

2. **Cr Content and Mechanism**: Increasing chromium content to 8 wt% maximizes the ratio of chromium(VI):chromium(III) species, enhancing alkane conversion. However, further increases in chromium content lead to uneven particle distributions, aggregation into alpha-chromium dioxide (α-Cr2O3), and an increase in inactive polychromate species, which negatively impacts performance.

These insights highlight the importance of tailoring the support material and chromium content to optimize the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions, balancing activity, selectivity, and stability.

铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODH）反应中的性能受到支持材料和反应条件的影响。关键发现包括：

1. **支持材料影响活性、选择性和稳定性**：当用高硅含量的材料如硅、MCM-41和H-ZSM-5等支持时，铬氧化物表现出最佳的活性和选择性。γ-氧化铝（γ-Al2O3）支持下的铬氧化物通过直接脱氢和逆水煤气变换（RWGS）机制工作，导致由于焦炭形成而失活。锆基氧化物（ZrO2）支持的铬氧化物在单一步骤中执行CO2-ODH，但与干式改革竞争，其失活方式涉及烧结或转化为不活性铬物种。铈（CeO2）上的铬氧化物活性较低但稳定性较高，得益于逆布杜瓦尔反应能够消耗焦炭沉积。

2. **铬含量和机制**：将铬含量增加到8 wt%，最大化铬（VI）：铬（III）物种的比例，增强烷烃转化率。然而，进一步增加铬含量导致颗粒分布不均，聚合为α-铬酸盐（α-Cr2O3），并增加不活性多铬酸物种，从而负面影响性能。

这些见解强调了根据活性、选择性和稳定性的平衡优化铬氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的整体性能的重要性，需要定制支持材料和铬含量。

Various support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content are known to enhance the catalyst's activity and selectivity for CO2 conversion. However, Cr oxides incorporated into mesoporous structures exhibit greater selectivity for undesired products due to the presence of inactive polychromates. The choice of support material, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, or CexZr1xO2, impacts the oxidation state of Cr in the catalyst, affecting its activity and selectivity. For instance, CrOx/SiO2 shows increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with higher CO2 partial pressures, while CrOx/γ-Al2O3 activity decreases under similar conditions. The presence of metals like Fe, Co, Mn, and Ni can improve the catalyst's selectivity for specific alkenes by increasing the concentration of weakly acidic sites that facilitate alkane activation and decreasing the number of strong acid sites responsible for reforming and cracking. These factors, along with the redox cycle of CrVI centres generated from CrIII, play crucial roles in the optimization of chromium oxide catalysts' overall performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, the catalysts face challenges such as instability towards coking and short life cycles, which hinder their practical implementation.

The key challenges in optimizing the performance of chromium oxide catalysts include:

1. **Stability and Lifespan**: The catalysts are unstable towards coking, leading to short life cycles. This issue arises from the accumulation of coke deposits on the catalyst surface, which reduces its activity and selectivity over time.

2. **Mechanistic Pathways**: The redox cycle of CrVI centres generated from CrIII plays a crucial role in the activation of CO2. However, the subsequent deactivation of the catalyst occurs due to the relatively inactive CrIII sites and the accumulation of inactive polychromate species.

3. **Selectivity and Conversion**: Achieving high selectivity for desired alkenes while maintaining high conversion rates remains a challenge. The catalysts often exhibit a trade-off between these two parameters, requiring careful tuning of the reaction conditions and catalyst composition.

4. **Support Material Impact**: Different support materials affect the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. Selecting the optimal support material that balances these factors is essential for enhancing the catalyst's performance.

5. **Doping Effects**: Doping the catalyst with metals such as Fe, Co, Mn, and Ni can improve selectivity for specific alkenes by altering the catalyst's surface chemistry. However, the optimal doping level needs to be determined to avoid detrimental effects on the catalyst's stability and activity.

Optimizing the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions involves addressing these challenges through careful selection of support materials, tuning of reaction conditions, and strategic doping of catalysts. The goal is to achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability, enabling the efficient utilization of CO2 and the production of valuable alkenes from light alkanes.

各种支持材料和反应条件对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径产生了显著影响。SiO2、MCM-41和高SiO2含量的H-ZSM-5等材料能增强催化剂的CO2转化活性和选择性。然而，将铬氧化物引入多孔结构中会导致催化剂对非期望产物的选择性增加，因为其中存在不活泼的多铬酸盐。不同的支持材料，如Al2O3、ZrO2、CeO2或CexZr1xO2，会影响铬在催化剂中的氧化状态，从而影响其活性和选择性。例如，CrOx/SiO2在更高的CO2分压下显示出增加的活性和C3H6选择性，而CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性在类似条件下会降低。金属如Fe、Co、Mn和Ni的掺杂可以改善催化剂对特定烯烃的选择性，通过增加促进烷烃活化的弱酸性位点的数量，并减少介导重整和裂解的强酸性位点的数量。这些因素以及CrVI中心的还原循环在优化铬氧化物催化剂整体性能方面起着关键作用。然而，催化剂面临着稳定性差、寿命短等问题，这阻碍了它们的实际应用。

优化铬氧化物催化剂性能的关键挑战包括：

1. **稳定性和寿命**：催化剂容易受到焦碳沉积的影响，导致寿命缩短。这种问题源于催化剂表面焦碳的积累，这会降低其活性和选择性。

2. **反应途径**：CrVI中心从CrIII的还原循环在CO2激活过程中发挥关键作用。然而，催化剂的后续失活是由于相对不活跃的CrIII位点和积聚的不活性多铬酸盐的积累。

3. **选择性和转化率**：实现对所需烯烃的高选择性同时保持高转化率仍然是一个挑战。催化剂往往在这些参数之间存在权衡，需要仔细调整反应条件和催化剂组成。

4. **支持材料影响**：不同的支持材料影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。选择平衡这些因素的最优支持材料对于提高催化剂的性能至关重要。

5. **掺杂效应**：向催化剂中掺入Fe、Co、Mn和Ni等金属可以改善特定烯烃的选择性，通过改变催化剂的表面化学性质。然而，需要确定最佳掺杂水平以避免对催化剂稳定性和活性产生不利影响。

优化铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的性能涉及解决上述挑战，通过精心选择支持材料、调整反应条件和策略性掺杂催化剂。目标是实现高活性、选择性和稳定性，从而有效利用二氧化碳并从轻烷烃生产有价值的烯烃。
