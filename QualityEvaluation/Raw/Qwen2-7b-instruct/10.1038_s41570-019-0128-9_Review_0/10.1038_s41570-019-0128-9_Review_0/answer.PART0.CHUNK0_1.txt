[1] "Cr oxide catalysts Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking."
[2] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content27,53."
[3] "The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2 (ref.46)."
[4] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways."
[5] "Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure27,50,53."
[6] "The different performance between these two supports was attributed to two factors: CO2 adsorbs more strongly on γ-Al2O3 (thereby competing with C3H8 adsorption) and/or CO2 affects the acidbase properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3."
[7] "The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 has been attributed to isolated CrVI centres generated from CrIII in a redox cycle55,56,57,58,59 (Fig. 2b)."
[8] "Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion60,61."
[9] "Further increasing the Cr content of supported catalysts affords uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species3,49,56,58,62."
[10] "CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2 (ref.30)."
[11] "Cr catalysts remain only rarely implemented owing to their short life cycles, as well as the high toxicity of CrIII necessitating meticulous care during the preparation, use and disposal of the materials."

Various support materials significantly impact the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) reactions. Materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 can alter the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of these catalysts. The choice of support affects the redox activity, adsorption properties, and acid-base functionalities of the catalysts. Higher SiO2 content in supports like MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 tends to enhance the activity of chromium oxide catalysts. Different supports, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the redox states of chromium ions, leading to distinct pathways for CO2-ODH, including two-step mechanisms or single-step pathways. CO2 partial pressure and the nature of the support can affect the selectivity and conversion efficiency of the catalysts. The performance is often attributed to the ability of CO2 to compete with alkane adsorption, modifying acid-base properties, and generating active sites through redox cycling. Increasing chromium content can optimize the ratio of CrVI to CrIII species, enhancing alkane conversion rates. However, further increasing the chromium content can lead to uneven particle distributions, increased agglomeration, and the formation of inactive species, causing deactivation. Chromium catalysts face challenges due to their short life cycles and toxicity, requiring careful handling during preparation and disposal. These trade-offs necessitate a balance in support selection, chromium loading, and operational conditions to achieve optimal performance in CO2-ODH reactions.

各种支持材料对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODH）反应中的性能产生了显著影响。材料如二氧化硅、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2可以改变催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径。所选支持体影响铬离子的还原性，吸附特性和酸碱功能。MCM-41和H-ZSM-5中较高的二氧化硅含量倾向于增强铬氧化物催化剂的活性。不同的支持体，如Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，会影响铬离子的还原状态，导致CO2-ODH的不同途径，包括两步机制或单步骤途径。CO2分压和支持的性质可以影响催化剂的选择性和转化效率。性能通常归因于CO2与烷烃吸附的竞争能力，修改酸碱属性，并通过氧化还原循环生成活性位点。增加铬含量可以在优化CrVI与CrIII物种的比例的同时提高烷烃转换速率。然而，进一步增加铬含量可能导致颗粒分布不均，增加聚集，并形成无活性物种，导致催化剂失效。由于其短寿命周期和毒性，铬催化剂需要在准备和处置过程中进行仔细处理。这些权衡要求在支持选择、铬加载量和操作条件下找到平衡，以实现CO2-ODH反应的最佳性能。
