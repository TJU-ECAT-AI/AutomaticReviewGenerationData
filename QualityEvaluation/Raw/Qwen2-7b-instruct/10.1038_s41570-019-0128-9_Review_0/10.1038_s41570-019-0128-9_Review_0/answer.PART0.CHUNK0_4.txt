[1] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content."
[2] "When CrOx is on CeO2, it is less active but more stable because the reverse Boudouard reaction can readily consume coke deposits."
[3] "Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure."
[4] "Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion."
[5] "For instance, CrOx/MCM-41 nanocatalysts for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 at 823K show high initial selectivity for C2H4 (90%) but low maximum conversion of C2H6 (<8%)61."

1. Chromium oxide catalysts display optimal activity and selectivity when supported on materials like silica, siliceous MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high silica content. When supported on ceria, they are less active but more stable due to the reverse Boudouard reaction's capability to consume coke deposits. Increasing the CO2 partial pressure enhances the activity and C3H6 selectivity of CrOx/SiO2 in propane oxidative dehydrogenation, whereas it diminishes the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 even slightly. Elevating the chromium content to 8 wt% maximizes the ratio of CrVI to CrIII, enhancing alkane conversion. Chromium oxide/MCM-41 nanocatalysts for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 at 823 K initially show high selectivity for C2H4 (90%) but exhibit a low maximum conversion of C2H6 (<8%).

1. 铬氧化物催化剂在高硅含量的硅胶、多模-41和H-ZSM-5等材料上的支持下表现出最佳的活性和选择性。当它们在氧化铈上时，活性较低但稳定性更好，因为逆布杜瓦反应能够轻易地消耗沉积的焦炭。增加CO2分压可以提高CrOx/SiO2在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的活性和C3H6选择性，而即使轻微增加CO2分压也会降低CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性。将铬含量提高到8 wt%，可以获得CrVI与CrIII的最大比值，从而增加烷烃转化率。CrOx/MCM-41纳米催化剂在823 K条件下对C2H6的CO2-ODH表现出初期高C2H4选择性（90%），但最大C2H6转化率很低（<8%）。
