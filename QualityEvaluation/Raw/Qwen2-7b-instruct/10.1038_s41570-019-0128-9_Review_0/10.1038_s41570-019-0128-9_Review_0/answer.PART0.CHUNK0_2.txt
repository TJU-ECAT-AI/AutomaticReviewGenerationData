[1] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content."
[2] "Although Cr oxides can be incorporated into mesoporous structures to afford more active species, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates and the materials thus show greater selectivity for undesired products."
[3] "The support can influence the acid-base properties and the distribution of reactive metal-oxide groups on the catalyst surface, and is, thus, not to be neglected because it can shift catalytic activity."
[4] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways."
[5] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke."
[6] "By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species."
[7] "Instead, when CrOx is on CeO2, it is less active but more stable because the reverse Boudouard reaction can readily consume coke deposits."
[8] "Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure."
[9] "The different performance between these two supports was attributed to two factors: CO2 adsorbs more strongly on γ-Al2O3 (thereby competing with C3H8 adsorption) and/or CO2 affects the acid-base properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3."

The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are significantly influenced by the choice of support materials and reaction conditions. Key support materials include silica (SiO2), MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, aluminum oxide (Al2O3), zirconium oxide (ZrO2), and ceria (CeO2). Chromium oxides supported on silica, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high silica content demonstrate higher activity and selectivity compared to other materials. Incorporating chromium oxides into mesoporous structures can increase activity, but often leads to the formation of inactive polychromates, favoring the production of undesired products. The support's ability to influence the acid-base properties and distribution of reactive metal-oxide groups on the catalyst surface is crucial, impacting the overall performance. Different pathways are observed depending on the support; for instance, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 operates through a two-step dehydrogenation and RWGS mechanism, potentially leading to deactivation via coke formation, whereas CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step, albeit competitively with DR, with deactivation occurring through sintering or conversion into inactive species. Using CeO2 as a support results in less active but more stable catalysts due to the reverse Boudouard reaction's capability to consume coke deposits. Increasing CO2 partial pressure enhances activity and C3H6 selectivity for CrOx/SiO2 but decreases it for CrOx/γ-Al2O3. The differences in performance between these supports are attributed to CO2's stronger adsorption on γ-Al2O3, which competes with C3H8 adsorption and affects the acid-base properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3.

铬氧化物在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径受到支撑材料和反应条件的显著影响。关键的支撑材料包括硅（SiO2）、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、氧化铝（Al2O3）、二氧化锆（ZrO2）和氧化铈（CeO2）。当铬氧化物支持在高硅含量的硅、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5上时，它们的活性和选择性通常更高。将铬氧化物引入多孔结构可以增加活性，但往往导致形成无活性的多铬酸盐，从而有利于产生不希望的产品。支撑物能够影响催化剂表面的酸基性质和反应性金属氧化物集团的分布，这对整体性能至关重要。根据不同的支撑物，会观察到不同的路径；例如，CrOx/γ-Al2O3通过两步脱氢和水煤气变换机制运行，可能导致由于焦炭形成而失活，而CrOx/ZrO2在单步中执行CO2-ODH，尽管与DR竞争，其失活方式涉及烧结或转化为无活性的铬物种。使用CeO2作为支撑物会导致活性较低但更稳定的催化剂，因为反布杜尔反应能够消耗焦炭沉积物。增加CO2分压可以增强CrOx/SiO2的活性和C3H6选择性，但减少CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性。这些支持物之间性能差异的原因是CO2在γ-Al2O3上的更强吸附，这与C3H8吸附竞争，并影响CrOx/γ-Al2O3的酸基性质。
