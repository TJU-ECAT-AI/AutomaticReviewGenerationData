1. The addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst improved its catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. Ni facilitated the regeneration of reduced CrOx by acting as a catalyst for CO2 dissociation and reoxidation.
3. The presence of Ni maintained the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction.
4. The Ni-promoted catalyst enhanced the stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction.
5. CO2 became a more effective oxidant in the presence of Ni, promoting the regeneration of active CrOx.
6. Ni induced the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O, which helped in regenerating the reduced CrOx species.
7. Higher valence Cr states become active upon contact with alkanes at high temperatures.
8. CrOx catalysts face rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction.
9. CO2 has limited oxidizing capability for reoxidation of reduced CrOx due to its thermodynamic stability.
