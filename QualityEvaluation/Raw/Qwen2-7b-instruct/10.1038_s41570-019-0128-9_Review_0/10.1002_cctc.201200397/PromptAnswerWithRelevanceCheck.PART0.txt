[1] "Nakagawa et al. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[2] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[3] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2."
[4] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."
[5] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."
[6] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
[7] "Choe et al. studied the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 by using a molecular orbital method on Ni(111) within a 25-atom cluster."
[8] "Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."
[9] "To verify the effect of Ni, three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and exsitu XPS experiments were performed."
[10] "Cr6+ states in CrOx reduce immediately to Cr3+ on interaction with propane, which acts as a precursor for active sites."
[11] "The coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states formed work for dehydrogenation, and the generated hydrogen reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which causes the deactivation of the catalyst."
[12] "The soft oxidant CO2 is activated and dissociates on the Ni surface of the nearby CrOx, and the generated O*ads is transferred to reoxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr3+ to Cr6+ step-by-step to recover the original CrOx phase."
[13] "Consequently, the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst shows high stability in the ODHP reaction by maintaining the active phase of its Cr3+ states."

The document discusses the use of Ni as a promoter in a CrOx catalyst supported on silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). Ni helps to regenerate the reduced CrOx to active Cr3+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and propylene yield. The study also examines the effect of Ni on the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, including its structure and reactivity, through techniques such as XRD, SAXS, HR-TEM, and UV/Vis DRS. The document highlights the importance of Ni in improving the oxidizing ability of CO2 and maintaining a stable selectivity for propylene, as well as its potential in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The mechanism of the ODHP reaction involving Ni is proposed, showing how Ni activates CO2, leading to the dissociation of CO2 to CO and O*ads, which reoxidizes the reduced CrOx species.

The introduction of Ni as a promoter into a 10wt% CrOx catalyst supported on SBA-15 (Cr/Si) significantly improves the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction. The addition of 0.5wt% Ni stabilizes the catalytic activity and selectivity. This is because Ni activates CO2, facilitating its dissociation into CO and activated O (O*ads). The generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx, maintaining the active Cr3+ state during the reaction. This mechanism enhances the stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction.
