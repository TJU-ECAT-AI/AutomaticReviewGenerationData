[1] "CrOx catalysts supported on the SBA-15 support (Cr/Si) are highly active, they represent potentially promising catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP)."
[2] "However, reduction of the active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction is known to lead to severe deactivation."
[3] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[4] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[5] "In addition, exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[6] "CO2 is a more effective oxidant and reduced Cr2+ states are regenerated to active Cr3+ states."
[7] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[8] "Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[9] "Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

The introduction of Ni as a promoter into a 10wt% CrOx catalyst supported on SBA-15 (Cr/Si) significantly improves the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction. The addition of 0.5wt% Ni stabilizes the catalytic activity and selectivity. This is because Ni activates CO2, facilitating its dissociation into CO and activated O (O*ads). The generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx, maintaining the active Cr3+ state during the reaction. This mechanism enhances the stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction.

在SBA-15支持下的10wt%铬氧化物催化剂（Cr/Si）中加入镍作为促进剂，显著改善了丙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢反应。添加0.5wt%的镍可以稳定催化活性和选择性。这是因为镍激活了二氧化碳，使其分解为CO和活性氧（O*ads）。生成的O*ads再生了还原的CrOx，保持了反应期间的活性Cr3+状态。这一机制增强了丙烯生产的稳定性。
