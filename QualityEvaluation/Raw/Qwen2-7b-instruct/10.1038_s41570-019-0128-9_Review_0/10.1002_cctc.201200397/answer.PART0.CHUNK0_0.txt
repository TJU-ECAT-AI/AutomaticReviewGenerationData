[1] "Nakagawa et al. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[2] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[3] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2."
[4] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."
[5] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."
[6] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
[7] "Choe et al. studied the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 by using a molecular orbital method on Ni(111) within a 25-atom cluster."
[8] "Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."
[9] "To verify the effect of Ni, three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and exsitu XPS experiments were performed."
[10] "Cr6+ states in CrOx reduce immediately to Cr3+ on interaction with propane, which acts as a precursor for active sites."
[11] "The coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states formed work for dehydrogenation, and the generated hydrogen reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which causes the deactivation of the catalyst."
[12] "The soft oxidant CO2 is activated and dissociates on the Ni surface of the nearby CrOx, and the generated O*ads is transferred to reoxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr3+ to Cr6+ step-by-step to recover the original CrOx phase."
[13] "Consequently, the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst shows high stability in the ODHP reaction by maintaining the active phase of its Cr3+ states."

The document discusses the use of Ni as a promoter in a CrOx catalyst supported on silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). Ni helps to regenerate the reduced CrOx to active Cr3+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and propylene yield. The study also examines the effect of Ni on the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, including its structure and reactivity, through techniques such as XRD, SAXS, HR-TEM, and UV/Vis DRS. The document highlights the importance of Ni in improving the oxidizing ability of CO2 and maintaining a stable selectivity for propylene, as well as its potential in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The mechanism of the ODHP reaction involving Ni is proposed, showing how Ni activates CO2, leading to the dissociation of CO2 to CO and O*ads, which reoxidizes the reduced CrOx species.

文档讨论了在氧化脱氢反应中使用Ni作为CrOx催化剂支持在二氧化硅上的促进剂。Ni有助于将还原的CrOx再生为活性Cr3+状态，从而增强催化剂的稳定性和丙烯产率。研究还通过X射线衍射(XRD)、小角X射线散射(SAXS)、高分辨率透射电子显微镜(HR-TEM)和紫外可见漫反射光谱(UV/Vis DRS)等技术考察了Ni对催化剂的物理化学性质的影响，包括其结构和活性。文档强调了Ni提高CO2氧化能力以及维持丙烯选择性的稳定性的重要性，并探讨了Ni在CO2重整反应和逆水煤气变换(RWGS)反应中的潜力。提出了ODHP反应中Ni的作用机制，显示了Ni激活CO2，导致CO2分解为CO和O*ads，该O*ads再氧化了还原的CrOx物种的过程。
