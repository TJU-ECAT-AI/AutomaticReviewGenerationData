[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "Exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[4] "In terms of catalytic activity, the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si) catalyst resulted in a higher CO2 conversion and the stable production of propylene."
[5] "This allows one to conclude that Ni has superior ability to dissociate CO2 as well as to regenerate the active site in CrOx for the ODHP reaction, which results in a stable yield of propylene."

The introduction of 0.5wt% Ni to the Cr/Si catalyst led to enhanced stability and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reactions. The addition of Ni facilitated the easy regeneration of reduced CrOx, particularly maintaining the active Cr3+ state. This resulted in a higher CO2 conversion and stable production of propylene. The superior ability of Ni to dissociate CO2 and regenerate the active CrOx sites contributed to the stable yield of propylene.

添加0.5wt% Ni到Cr/Si催化剂中，导致了丙烷与CO2在氧化脱氢反应中的稳定性和选择性的提升。Ni的加入使得还原的CrOx易于再生，特别是保持了活性的Cr3+状态。这导致了更高的CO2转化率和稳定的丙烯产量。Ni对CO2的解离能力和CrOx活性位点的再生能力优越，从而实现了稳定的丙烯产出。
