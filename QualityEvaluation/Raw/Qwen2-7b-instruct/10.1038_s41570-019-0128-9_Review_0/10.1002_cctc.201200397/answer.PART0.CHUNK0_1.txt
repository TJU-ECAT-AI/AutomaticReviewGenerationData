[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "In addition, exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[4] "Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

1. The addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si catalysts resulted in stable catalytic activity and high selectivity.
2. The Ni-promoted catalyst enabled easy regeneration of reduced CrOx.
3. Ex situ XPS analysis showed that Cr3+ was preserved in the Ni-promoted catalyst, unlike in the non-promoted catalyst where Cr3+ rapidly converted to Cr2+.
4. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst improved the stability of propylene production in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction.

1. 添加0.5wt% Ni到10wt% Cr/Si催化剂后，催化活性稳定且选择性高。
2. Ni促进的催化剂实现了还原CrOx的容易再生。
3. 外场XPS分析显示，Ni促进的催化剂中Cr3+得到保持，而非促进的催化剂中Cr3+快速转化为Cr2+。
4. Ni促进的Cr/Si催化剂提高了丙烯在丙烷与CO2氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的稳定性。
