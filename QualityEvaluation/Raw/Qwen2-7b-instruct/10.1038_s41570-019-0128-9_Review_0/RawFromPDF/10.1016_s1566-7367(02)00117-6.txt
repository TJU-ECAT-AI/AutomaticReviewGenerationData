Abstract
Cr/H-ZSM-5 ðSiO2=Al2O3=190Þ catalyst eﬀectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2
oxidant. The maximum rate of formation of ethylene at 923 K was 0:516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1 and selectivity was
over 90%. Carbon dioxide maintained the activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the surface of the catalyst.
TPR proﬁles of the Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts suggest that there are high oxidation states Cr species such as Cr(VI) on the
catalyst, which is considered key of higher activity.  2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
1. Introduction
Natural gas is used not only as a fuel but also as
a raw material. Natural gas typically contains ca.
10% ethane, the concentration of which depends
on the oil ﬁeld or coal ﬁeld gas. One important
way to utilize ethane is to convert it into ethylene,
which has a well-established chemistry in the pet-
rochemical industry. In the United States, more
than 10 million tons of ethane is converted into
ethylene by thermal dehydrogenation. Catalytic
dehydrogenation of ethane and other light alkanes
ðC3; C4Þ is currently being extensively studied as a
new energy-saving method for producing light
oleﬁns. Carbon dioxide is a promising oxidant for
dehydrogenation of ethane. In the dehydrogena-
tion reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to serve as a
medium for supplying heat to the endothermic
dehydrogenation reaction, (2) to increase equilib-
rium conversion by diluting light alkanes, and (3)
to maintain the activity of the catalyst over a long
time by removing coke formed on the catalyst. To
date, the Cr=SiO2 [1–3], Ga=TiO2 [4], Ga/diamond
[5], and CaO=CeO2 [6] catalysts have exhibited
high activities in the dehydrogenation of light
alkanes with CO2 as an oxidant. The temperature
range of the reported dehydrogenations were 823–
923 K.
We have found that the Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts
are very active for the dehydrogenation of ethane
to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide,
and the rate of dehydrogenation is much higher

than the rates previously obtained with other
catalysts. Here, we report the eﬀects of CO2 on
the dehydrogenation of ethane over Cr/H-ZSM-5
catalysts.
2. Experimental procedure
We prepared various Cr (or Ga, V)/zeolite (or
SiO2) catalysts by the impregnation method. Ap-
propriate weights of zeolite (or other support) and
chromium nitrate were added to deionized water
(100 ml) at room temperature, and the mixture was
stirred for 30 min. The slurry was then vacuum
dried at 353 K, and the precursor of the catalyst
was calcined in air at 1023 K for 5 h. The dehy-
drogenation of ethane was carried out in a quartz
tube down-ﬂow reactor. Before the reaction, the
catalyst, mixed with a suitable amount of quartz
sand, was treated with CO2 gas for 15 min at the
reaction temperature. Dehydrogenation was then
performed under atmospheric pressure. The reac-
tant stream, consisting of 10 vol% ethane and 90
vol% carbon dioxide, was passed through the re-
actor at a ﬂow rate of 100 ml min1. The products
were analyzed with on-line GC-14A gas chroma-
tographs (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with
an FID or TCD detector.
The crystal structures of the catalysts were de-
termined with a RINT-2000 X-ray powder dif-
fractometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) using Cu Ka
radiation. The weight of carbon deposited on the
catalyst during the dehydrogenation was measured
with a TGA 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer
(TGA) (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). Before
analysis, samples were heated at 473 K for 10 min
under a helium ﬂow. The temperature was pro-
grammed to increase at a rate of 10 K min1 from
room temperature to 1073 K under circulation of
dried air. The temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR)
measurements
were
carried
out
with
homemade equipment. The weight of oxygen re-
moved by reduction was measured by thermo-
gravimetric analysis. Before analysis, samples were
heated at 823 K for 10 min under a helium ﬂow.
The temperature was programmed to increase at a
rate of 10 K min1 from room temperature to
1073 K under circulation of H2(10 vol%)/Ar(90
vol%) mixed gas. The ﬂow rate was 30 ml min1.

activities of catalysts for the dehydrogenation of
ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide oxidant
are compiled in Fig. 1. The major products of the
oxidative dehydrogenation were C2H4, CO, H2,
and CH4; much smaller amounts of C3 compounds
ð<0:1%Þ were detected. Over quartz sand alone
(No. 12), the thermal dehydrogenation of ethane
to ethylene hardly occurred at 923 K and the
conversion of ethane was only 2.0%. The most
active
catalyst
tested
was
Cr/H-ZSM-5
ðSiO2=Al2O3 ¼ 1900Þ (No. 1). The rate of forma-
tion
of
ethylene
with
this
catalyst
was
0:191 mmol g-catalyst1 min1.
This
value
is
about 1.6 times higher than the rate of formation
of C2H4 with the Cr=SiO2 catalyst, which is one of
the most active catalysts investigated so far [2].
Moreover, the Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900) catalyst was
active after 6 h. In contrast, the Cr/H-ZSM-5(90)
and Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) catalysts, whose H-ZSM-5
supports have the same crystal structure as the H-
ZSM-5 support in Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900), are not as
active
as
Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900)
and
Cr/H-ZSM-
5(190). The order of activity (conversion of ethane
and yield of ethylene) of the H-ZSM-5 support
was Cr=H-ZSM-5ð1900Þ > Cr=H-ZSM-5ð190Þ 
Cr=H-ZSM-5ð90Þ > Cr=H-ZSM-5ð29Þ. This order
indicates that the SiO2=Al2O3 ratio aﬀects the na-
ture of the Cr active species and the activity of the
catalyst. Gallium oxide and vanadium oxide,
which were reported to be active species for
dehydrogenation [4], were not very active on the
H-ZSM-5(1900)
support.
The
Cr/H-beta(150)
catalyst had a higher initial activity at 5 min than
the Cr=SiO2 catalyst; however, the yield of ethyl-
ene decreased to 14.1% after 6 h. Other Cr/zeolite
catalysts were less active than the Cr/SiO2 catalyst.
Crystal structures of the zeolite supports also
greatly aﬀected the catalytic activity. Comparing
among catalyst 4, 5 and 8, whose SiO2=Al2O3 ratio
are almost the same, the order of activity is as
follows: Cr=H-mordeniteð20Þ > Cr=H-ZSM-5ð29Þ
> Cr=H-betað25Þ.
Inﬂuences of Cr content on the H-ZSM-5(1900)
supports are presented in Fig. 2. Since the activity
of H-ZSM-5(1900) alone was very low, Cr could
be an important key component. With increase in
Cr content, the conversion of ethane was in-
creased, while the selectivity was decreased.

The W =F þ ratio inﬂuenced the yield, selectivity,
and rate of formation of ethylene (Fig. 3). Smaller
W =F ratios gave lower yields and higher selectiv-
ities, and the rate of formation of ethylene in-
creased with decreasing W =F . Generally, the rate
of formation ought not to be inﬂuenced by W =F ;
however, in this case, we believe that the desorp-
tion and diﬀusion of products from the surface of
the catalyst is the rate-determining step. The
maximum rate of formation of ethylene was
0:516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1 at 923 K, which is
2.5–4 times faster than the rates previously re-
ported for the Cr=SiO2 [2] and Ga=TiO2 [4] cata-
lysts. The ethylene selectivity was found to be over
90% at the highest formation rate of ethylene.
The time course of dehydrogenation over Cr/H-
ZSM-5(1900) catalyst (Table 1, No. 1) is shown in
Fig. 4. Comparison of the dehydrogenation results
for CO2 co-feed gas vs. Ar co-feed gas reveals two
signiﬁcant promoting eﬀects of CO2. In the pres-
ence of CO2, the yield of ethylene was higher than
that under Ar ﬂow, and deactivation, which oc-
curred with the Cr=SiO2 catalyst [1,2], was not
observed. Takahara et al. [1] and Nakagawa et al.
[4] previously reported the acceleration of dehy-
drogenation by CO2; however, the mechanism of
this acceleration is, as yet, unclear. We hypothesize
that CO2 quickly removes surface species formed
during dehydrogenation of ethane, such as hy-
drogen species, by the reverse water gas shift
reaction, producing clean active sites. When Ar co-
feed gas is used, the main reason for the deacti-
vation is assumed to be coke deposition on the
catalyst surface. The weights of coke deposited,
measured by TGA, were 0.6 wt% of the catalyst
with CO2 co-feed gas and 2.1 wt% with Ar co-feed
gas. We believe that CO2, a weak oxidant, removes
the coke on the surface by the Boudart reaction:
C þ CO2 ¼ 2CO.
XRD measurements were carried out for Cr/H-
ZSM-5(1900) before and after dehydrogenation
and for H-ZSM-5(1900). The XRD patterns of H-

ZSM-5(1900) and Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900) after calci-
nation clearly indicated that the catalysts had the
MFI-zeolite structure. Moreover, chromium oxide
patterns were not found, which might indicate that
the chromium species are highly dispersed on the
H-ZSM-5(1900) support. The XRD pattern after
dehydrogenation was the same as that before de-
hydrogenation, which indicates that the crystal
structure was not changed and that the structure
was stable under the reaction conditions.
The TPR proﬁles of the active (Cr/H-ZSM-
5(1900)) and less active (Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) and Cr/
H-Y(4.8)) catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. The pro-
ﬁles of Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900) catalyst showed a
pronounced H2 consumption peak in the temper-
ature range 623–823 K, whereas a very small peak
was detected for the Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) and Cr/H-
Y(4.8) catalysts in this temperature range. The
other less active catalysts (Cr/H-ZSM-5(90), Cr/H-
beta(25), Cr/USY(360), and Cr/H-mordenite(20))
indicated very small or no peak. The other active
catalysts (Cr/H-ZSM-5(190) and Cr/SiO2) indi-
cated clear peaks a little smaller than that of Cr/H-
ZSM-5(1900). Although Cr/H-beta(150) is greatly
active catalyst in initial stage, H2 consumption
peak was very small. The TPR spectrum of pure
Cr2O3 did not show any peaks in the temperature
range scanned (473–1073 K). The H2 consumption
peak between 623 and 873 K can be assigned not
to a Cr(III) species but to a high oxidation state Cr
species, such as Cr(VI) [7], which may be the key to
the higher dehydrogenation activity. The average
value of x in the CrOx species, which is the high
oxidation state Cr species in the Cr/H-ZSM-
5(1900) catalyst, was determined to be 2.35 by
TGA. We are currently investigating the nature of
the Cr species.
We propose the following mechanism of dehy-
drogenation on the Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. This
mechanism is based on the redox cycle of the as yet
unidentiﬁed high oxidation state Cr species.
1. C2H6 adsorbs on the acidic sites of the Cr spe-
cies and/or H-ZSM-5.
2. The activated C2H6 reacts with the active O spe-
cies, CrOx (detected by TPR), to form C2H4 and
H2O:
C2H6 þ CrOx
¼ C2H4 þ H2O þ CrOx1
ðoxidative dehydrogenationÞ
The following side reactions also occur:
C2H6 ¼ C2H4 þ H2 ðsimple dehydrogenationÞ
CrOx þ C2H6
¼ CH4 þ C þ H2O þ CrOx1
ðmethane and coke formationÞ
C2H6 þ H2 ¼ 2CH4 ðhydrocrackingÞ
3. The CrOx1 species, which lost the active O spe-
cies, are reoxidized by the weak oxidant CO2:
CrOx1 þ CO2 ¼ CrOx þ CO
4. Coke on the catalyst surface reacts with CO2 to
form CO:
C þ CO2 ¼ 2CO
4. Conclusions
Cr/H-ZSM-5 ðSiO2=Al2O3 P 190Þ catalyst ex-
hibited the highest performance in the dehydroge-
nation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant. The CO2
co-feed
gas
accelerated
dehydrogenation
and
maintained the catalytic activity of the catalyst by
removing coke from the catalyst surface. TPR
proﬁles of Cr/H-ZSM-5 ðSiO2=Al2O3 P 190Þ cata-
lysts suggest that Cr species with the high oxidation
