TiO2–ZrO2 supports with different compositions ranging from 0 to 100 wt.% of ZrO2 were prepared by co-
precipitation method and impregnated with 5 wt.% of Cr2O3. The synthesized catalysts were character-
ized by XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET and FTIR techniques. Characterization studies revealed that the
combination of different amounts of TiO2 and ZrO2 in the supports had obvious effect on the crystal struc-
ture, texture characteristic, and catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene
by carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant. The XRD analysis conﬁrmed the formation of crystalline TiO2 and/or
ZrO2 in the synthesized samples. The FESEM and EDX images represented the production of homoge-
neous spherical type agglomerates within the nanometer range and uniform dispersion over the surface
of all samples specially CrT75Z25 with an average particle size of about 38 nm. The BET results depicted
high surface area of Cr/TiO2–ZrO2 nanocatalysts. The highest catalytic activity and yield (C2H4 yield of 46%
as well as 95% ethylene selectivity at 700 C) were acquired when 75 wt.% TiO2 and 25 wt.% ZrO2 were
used as the support. It could be attributed to the smaller particles, higher surface area, better dispersion
of active phase, and uniform morphology of CrT75Z25.

1. Introduction
The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane into ethy-
lene has attracted considerable attention, because ethylene is one
of the most important building blocks for many chemical and
petrochemical industries [1,2]. Ethylene is a raw material for the
production of low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density PE,
ethylene dichloride, ethylene oxide, linear LDPE, ethylbenzene,
and so on [3–5]. Thermal cracking of hydrocarbons is currently
the major source of ethylene [6–8]. Due to the rapidly growing
demand for ethylene and the shortage of petroleum resource in
the future, much effort has been devoted to new routes of ethylene
production from alternative resources, such as dehydrogenation of
ethane and natural gas-based processes [9–11].
The inherent obstacles of the ethane dehydrogenation process
are equilibrium limitations regarding ethane conversion, large
energy consumption due to endothermic reaction and rapid cata-
lyst deactivation owing to coke formation [3,12]. Alternatively,
the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane by oxygen is free
from thermodynamic constraints and can be operated at lower
temperatures with an exothermic reaction. However, this process
suffers from a signiﬁcant loss of ethylene selectivity due to the
over-oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide in the reaction. Han-
dling the potentially explosive oxygen-containing mixture is also
difﬁcult. Therefore, it is expected that these disadvantages will
be avoided to some extent via replacing oxygen by soft oxidants,
such as N2O and CO2 [12–15].
CO2 is now considered as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation
of ethane due to its role as a diluent in achieving high equilibrium
conversion, enhancing the selectivity to ethylene, and maintaining
longer catalyst life time [16,17]. It has been indicated that CO2
increases the yield of ethylene via a redox mechanism in which
the catalyst undergoes reduction by ethane and re-oxidation (by
CO2) cycles or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogena-
tion of ethane and the reverse water–gas shift reaction (RWGS)

[18,19]. Also, CO2 removes hydrogen produced from ethane dehy-
drogenation, and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards
the ethylene formation. On the other hand, the use of CO2 in the
feed of this new process is ecological, because CO2 as one of the
major greenhouse gases is reduced to CO which is more valuable
in chemical industry [6,17,20]. However, due to using the CO2 as
an oxidant in the ODH reactions, more carbonaceous deposits are
formed and resulted in the fast deactivation of catalysts [21].
Therefore, there is a need to design better catalyst systems, which
can overcome the deactivation.
Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium
oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promis-
ing ones due to their high catalytic activity [3,6,16,17]. Also, the
acid-base and textural properties of the supports strongly affect
the catalytic performance. Wang et al. [10] studied the ODH of
ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide over Cr2O3-based catalysts
and investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic
activity. As a result, they found that Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high con-
version but low selectivity to ethylene while Cr2O3/TiO2 demon-
strated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity. In
order to improve ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity, it is
interesting to use TiO2–ZrO2 as a combined support. The mixed
oxide nanocomposite catalysts also displayed superior ODH activ-
ity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement
in the acid-base bifunctional behavior [22]. The addition of ZrO2
can prevent TiO2 phase transformations from anatase to rutile at
high temperature, thereby promoting the thermal stability of the
catalysts [23]. TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides are proved to be highly
active and selective catalysts for several reactions such as isomer-
ization of cyclohexane oxides, hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to
alcohols, dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether, oxidative and
non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and cyclohexane
[22,24–26]. However, TiO2–ZrO2 combined support was not been
investigated for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene by
CO2 as a soft oxidant. Therefore, a combined catalysts consisting
of 5 wt.% Cr2O3 and TiO2–ZrO2 with various loadings of zirconia
were undertaken in the present investigation against the aforesaid
background.
Based on the above stated arguments, we have undertaken
TiO2–ZrO2 supported Cr2O3 materials for the ODH of ethane by
CO2. The desired TiO2, ZrO2 and TiO2–ZrO2 supports were synthe-
sized by precipitation and co-precipitation methods, respectively.
Cr2O3 was deposited over the supports by a wet impregnation
method. The structural evaluation of the catalysts was thoroughly
studied using various physiochemical techniques namely, XRD,
FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET, and FTIR. The catalytic performance was
evaluated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene
under atmospheric pressure employing CO2 as a soft oxidant.

respectively. Also, ammonium hydroxide solution (NH4OH, Mojal-
lali, Iran, 25%) was supplied as a precipitating agent. All of the

Fig. 1 illustrates schematically the methodology used for the
preparation of TiO2–ZrO2 supports with various loadings of zirco-
nia via co-precipitation method. TiO2–ZrO2 combined supports
were named as T(100  x)Zx, where ‘‘x” represents the nominal
weight percentage of ZrO2 (x: 0, 25, 50, 75,100 wt.%). In a typical
synthetic procedure, required amounts of zirconyl (IV) nitrate
hydrate and titanium (IV) chloride were dissolved separately in
deionized water and mixed together to ensure the formation of
homogeneous solution. To this mixture solution, dilute aqueous
ammonia was added drop wise under vigorous stirring until the
precipitation was completed. Then, the stirring was continued fur-
ther. The resultant precipitates were transferred into a Teﬂon-lined
stainless steel autoclave and aged hydrothermally before ﬁltration.
The well-formed white precipitates were ﬁltered and washed with
deionized water several times until the complete removal of chlo-
ride ions. The obtained cake was dried at 110 C for 12 h and ﬁnally
calcined at 600 C for 5 h under air ﬂow. The pure ZrO2 and TiO2
supports were also synthesized in the same manner mentioned
above.
On the calcined supports, Cr2O3 was deposited by adopting a
standard wet impregnation method as indicated in Fig. 2. To
achieve this, the desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate corre-
sponding to 5 wt.% Cr2O3 in the ﬁnal product was dissolved in
deionized water and then the powdered supports were added
under continuous stirring at the same temperature. After the
impregnation, all these samples were dried and calcined as before.
2.2. Nanocatalysts characterization
XRD analysis was performed on Siemens diffractometer D5000
with a Cu Ka radiation (k = 1.54178 Å) source operating at 40 kV
and 30 mA in a scanning range of 2h = 10–90. The diffraction
peaks of the crystalline phase were compared with those of stan-
dard compounds reported in the Joint Committee of Powder
Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) database ﬁles. The morphology and
surface particle size distribution of Cr/TiO2–ZrO2 nanocatalysts
were studied by FESEM (HITACHI S-109 4160). EDX analysis was
carried out by VEGA n nTESCAN, BSE DETECTOR for elemental anal-
ysis. The speciﬁc surface areas of the samples were determined by
BET method on Quantachorom CHEMBET-3000 apparatus. FTIR of
the powders was recorded on UNICAM 4600 Fourier spectrometer
in a range of 400–4000 cm1 by KBr pellet method in order to iden-
tify surface functional groups.
2.3. Nanocatalysts activity
Fig. 3 shows the experimental set up for the oxidative dehydro-
genation of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide. The catalytic
experiments were conducted in a quartz tube reactor (6 mm i.d.)
under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst loading for the reactor
was 500 mg. The reactant stream, consisting of 10 vol.% ethane,
50 vol.% carbon dioxide and 40 vol.% nitrogen, was introduced
into the reactor at a total ﬂow rate of 75 ml/min. The reaction

temperature ranged between 550 and 700 C. Blank tests were
conducted under the same conditions, by replacing the catalyst
with quartz sand particles of the same size. The products and
remained reactants were analyzed on-line by a gas chromatograph
(GC Chrom, Teif Gostar Faraz, Iran) equipped with a ﬂame ioniza-
tion detector (FID) using a CarboxenTM 1000 column. Gas stream
from the regulators passed through pipes and it was introduced
to the mass ﬂow controllers (MFC). Argon was used as the carrier
gas for gas chromatography. The ethane conversion ðXC2H6Þ, ethy-

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Nanocatalysts characterization
Fig. 4 depicts the XRD patterns and Table 1 reports the crys-
talline phases of synthesized TiO2–ZrO2 support and Cr/TiO2–
ZrO2 nanocatalysts with various loadings of ZrO2. According to
the JCPDS ﬁles, TiO2 (00-001-0562) and ZrO2 (01-080-0784) peaks
can be detected in the XRD patterns. As can be seen, CrT0Z100
shows both the tetragonal and monoclinic phases of ZrO2. The
addition of TiO2 to ZrO2 in order to producing TiO2–ZrO2 combined
supports prevents the phase transformation from tetragonal to
monoclinic phase, so the monoclinic phase of ZrO2 is detected very
weak for other patterns (T75Z25, CrT25Z75, CrT50Z50, CrT75Z25)
and the characteristic peaks of tetragonal zirconia are observed
as reported previously in other studies [3,27,28]. According to
other research [23], Cr/TiO2–ZrO2 nanocatalysts due to the domi-
nance of ZrO2 tetragonal phase will exhibit higher catalytic activity
and stability in this process than that on monoclinic phase of zirco-
nia. As the percentage of ZrO2 content increases, most of the peaks
match with monoclinic and tetragonal structure of ZrO2 and as the
percentage of ZrO2 content decreases, most of the peaks match
with anatase phase of TiO2. By decreasing the ZrO2 content, the
intensity of TiO2 peaks increases indicating that the introduction
of titania into the zirconia lattice has been occurred which changes
the structure of zirconia. The rhombohedral crystalline phase of
Cr2O3 are seen just by the very weak diffraction peaks at
2h = 24.5, 33.6, 36.2 (00-006-0504) in all the synthesized
nanocatalysts, probably due to high dispersion or small crystallites
of chromia over the supports. This hypothesis is going to be sup-
ported by BET and EDX analysis. It is observed that some of the
TiO2, ZrO2 and Cr2O3 peaks have overlap. For example, the peak
of Cr2O3 at 2h = 24.5 is severely covered by the peaks of TiO2 at
2h = 25.3 and ZrO2 at 2h = 24.1.

3.1.1. FESEM analysis
Fig. 5 displays the surface morphology of synthesized TiO2–ZrO2
support and Cr/TiO2–ZrO2 nanocatalysts. In this ﬁgure, the FESEM
images of the T75Z25 support and synthesized Cr/TiO2–ZrO2
nanocatalysts with different loadings of 100, 75, 50, 25, and 0 wt.
% ZrO2 are represented. According to the images, raising the TiO2
loading and creating catalysts with combined supports made the
morphology of surface material more homogeneous and spherical
type agglomerates with small sizes within the nanometer range
compared to that of their individual oxides (Cr/ZrO2, Cr/TiO2).
However, it seems that among these nanocatalysts, CrT75Z25 sam-
ple (Fig. 5e) has better surface morphology than the others which
this can cause the catalytic sites to be more available for the reac-
tants. Therefore, it is expected that the reactants can easily adsorb
and react on the surface of the CrT75Z25 nanocatalyst. The results
reveal that employing co-precipitation method to synthesize sup-
ports was an effective method to obtain highly homogeneous and
well dispersed nanocatalyst particles and creates uniform distribu-
tion of active phase on the surface of supports. These nanoparticles
provide more reactive and reducible sites and lead to high catalytic
performance.
3.1.2. PSD analysis
For further analysis, the particle size distribution and average
particle size of the TiO2–ZrO2 support and Cr/TiO2–ZrO2 nanocata-
lysts were calculated by Image-J software [29] and are represented
with histogram graphs in Fig. 6. Broad and non-uniform particle
size distributions with a minimum size of 18.8 nm and a maximum
size of 196.5 nm are observed for the CrT100Z0 particles. In con-
trast, the particles of the CrT0Z100 catalyst have a narrow size dis-
tribution. The minimum size of 17.9 nm, maximum of 91.3 nm and
the average size of 40.9 nm are observed in CrT0Z100 nanocatalyst.
The particles of the Cr/TiO2–ZrO2 nanocatalysts with various load-
ings of zirconia (25, 50, 75 wt.%) have narrow size distributions. For
instance, the major portion of the CrT75Z25 particle size distribu-
tion is observed to be in the range of 30–40 nm, with a minimum
size of 17.9 nm and a maximum of 57.8 nm. The average particle
size for CrT75Z25 is 37.8 nm, while the average particle size for
CrT100Z0 was 42.9 nm, which conﬁrms the effect of the support
composition in creating smaller particles. Approximately 95.2% of
the CrT75Z25 particles, 94% of the CrT100Z0 particles and 88% of
CrT0Z100 particles are in the range of less than 50 nm. In fact, in
synthesizing the combined supports by varying the weight percent
of the support composition, the growth of agglomerates due to sur-
face energy of particles can be under controlled and the spherical
type agglomerates with small sizes within the nanometer range
are created. So, highly homogeneous and smaller nanocatalyst
particles with higher speciﬁc surface area are produced and
employing the combined supports owing to high speciﬁc surface
area causes to create uniform distribution of active phase on the
surface of supports, as evidenced by EDX results. This is why the

bution compared to CrT100Z0 and CrT0Z100.
3.1.3. EDX analysis
After the nanocatalysts were imaged via FESEM, they were ana-
lyzed by EDX to determine the surface composition of elements
present in each catalyst. The elemental compositions of species
are shown in Fig. 7. All of the materials used in the preparation
of nanocatalysts (Zr, Ti, and Cr) can be observed in the EDX dot-
mapping pictures. These results at ﬁrst, proved the presence of
Cr2O3 as an active phase. Secondly, surface chemical compositions
are in agreement with the expected values at the exception of the
ZrO2–TiO2 mixtures in which a deﬁcit in titanium oxide is
observed. This deﬁcit is probably due to the difﬁculty to work
the titanium chloride precursor which is very hygroscopic and
decomposes instantaneously in air. According to the ﬁgure, Cr is
well dispersed over supports and no sintering is observed in Cr
species especially in CrT75Z25 sample. This observation conﬁrms
the XRD results which are previously presented. Therefore, these
nanoparticles provide more reactive and reducible Cr species over
the support and lead to high catalytic performance. To sum up, EDX
analysis reveals signiﬁcant effect of co-precipitation method to
synthesize supports specially combined supports on the dispersion
of active phase over the supports. This implies that TiO2, ZrO2, and
TiO2–ZrO2 combined supports favor the distribution of Cr2O3 over
the support surface.
3.1.4. BET analysis
The speciﬁc surface area of the synthesized samples is reported
in Table 1. It is believed that, high speciﬁc surface area is one of the
signiﬁcant factors which can affect the catalyst activity. As can be
seen, all of the catalysts exhibited relatively high surface area. This

feature is due to porous nature, size uniformity and nano-scale of
the oxides formed through the co-precipitation procedure which
is in consistent with FESEM images and the results of Reddy
et al. study [21]. Very interestingly, the Cr/TiO2–ZrO2 composite
oxides displayed higher speciﬁc surface areas than its individual
component oxides, Cr/TiO2 (28.6 m2/g) and Cr/ZrO2 (57.3 m2/g),
respectively. Among them, the highest speciﬁc area belongs to
CrT75Z25 sample suggesting the maximum combination effect of
ZrO2 and TiO2 at this particular composition which can be
explained by two aspects. First, as shown in the XRD patterns of
synthesized samples, the addition of TiO2 to ZrO2 in order to pro-
ducing TiO2–ZrO2 combined supports prevents the phase transfor-
mation from tetragonal to monoclinic phase, so the monoclinic
phase of ZrO2 is detected very weak for other patterns especially
T75Z25 and CrT75Z25 samples. Therefore, T75Z25 combined sup-
port and CrT75Z25 nanocatalyst due to the dominance of ZrO2
tetragonal phase will exhibit better catalytic and textural proper-
ties such as higher speciﬁc surface area, which is consistent with
the results reported previously in other studies [3,28,30]. Second,
FESEM images revealed that the composition of 75 wt.% TiO2 and
25 wt.% ZrO2 is an optimum composition of TiO2–ZrO2 combined
support for Cr/TiO2–ZrO2 nanocatalyst because at this composition,
the growth of agglomerates due to controlling the surface energy
of particles, was under controlled and the spherical type agglomer-
ates with small sizes within the nanometer range and high surface
area were created. So, highly homogeneous and smaller nanocata-
lyst particles with highest speciﬁc surface area were produced at
this composition and create uniform distribution of active phase
on the surface of supports. A slight difference in the speciﬁc surface
areas of T75Z25 and CrT75Z25 is mainly due to various factors such

support thereby narrowing its pore diameter and blockage of cer-
tain pores.
3.1.5. FTIR analysis
FTIR spectra of the synthesized samples were recorded in the
400–4000 cm1 range and obtained results are demonstrated in
Fig. 8. The spectrum of the synthesized catalysts showed peaks of
stretching vibration of structural O–H [31–33] at wave number
about 3450 cm1 and stretching vibration around 1635 and
1400 cm1
can
be
attributed
to
physically
adsorbed
water
[34–36]. The peak at 2370 cm1 is attributed to residual atmo-
spheric CO2 [34,37,38] or C–H stretching mode of atmospheric
hydrocarbons on the surface of the catalysts that is more intense
in the case of CrT100Z0 sample [39]. Absorption peaks around
465 cm1 are related to the anatase phase Ti–O metal oxides
infrared vibrations [24]. Also, the peaks around 400–600 cm1
are likely due to the metal–oxygen–metal bond (M–O–M; M = Ti,
Zr, and Cr) or the stretching vibration adsorption spectrum of
Zr–O [37,40,41].

3.2. Catalytic performance of Cr/TiO2–ZrO2 toward ethane to ethylene
3.2.1. Effect of support composition on C2H6 conversion
Fig. 9 depicts the effect of support composition on C2H6 conver-
sion at temperatures ranging from 550 to 700 C. In this section, all
reactions were carried out at constant feed composition and gas
hourly space velocity (GHSV = 9000 h1). It is seen that catalytic
conversion increases with increasing temperature which is in con-
sistent with the results in literature [10]. However, the tested cat-
alysts still exhibit varying activities depending on the composition
of supports. Quartz sand shows little activity in the oxidative dehy-
drogenation of ethane to ethylene by CO2 below 650 C. It exhibits
only approximately 10% ethane conversion at 700 C, indicating
that the homogeneous reaction and quartz sand will not make sig-
niﬁcant contributions to the heterogeneous reaction. The catalytic
performance of Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/TiO2 is lower than all the Cr/TiO2–
ZrO2 nanocatalysts. As expected, the best activity results are attrib-
uted to CrT75Z25 in which the proper loadings of ZrO2 and TiO2 in
support composition make a well-structured nanocatalyst. Smaller
particles of this catalyst and their good dispersion will increase the

number of active metal (Cr) per unit mass of the catalyst and also
the surface area for the catalytic reactions. Therefore, a high activ-
ity in terms of the C2H6 conversion is observed for this catalyst.
As presented in Fig. 9, deposition of 5 wt.% Cr2O3 as an active
phase over the T75Z25 support causes to dramatic increase in
ethane conversion (increase from ca. 20% to 48% at 700 C) which
is probably due to the redox property of Cr2O3. The dehydrogena-
tion and oxidative dehydrogenation due to the introduction of CO2
and its decomposition to produce surface oxygen species will be
the parallel reaction paths in the dehydrogenation of ethane by
carbon dioxide. Based on the other researcher’s results, the possi-
ble reactions occurring are proposed as follows [10]:
C2H6 ! C2H4 þ H2
2C2H6 þ 2CrO3 ! 2C2H4 þ Cr2O3 þ 3H2O
Cr2O3 þ 2CO2 ! 2CO þ 2CrO3
H2 þ CO2 ! CO þ H2O
C2H6 þ 2CO2 ! 4CO þ 3H2
C2H6 þ H2 ! 2CH4
3.2.2. Effect of support composition on C2H4 yield
The effect of support composition on C2H4 yield at temperatures
ranging from 550 to 700 C is illustrated in Fig. 10. The yield of
C2H4 was dramatically promoted with increasing operation tem-
perature due to the endothermicity of the reaction and getting a
more negative Gibbs free energy at high temperatures. It must be
underlined that the product yield over CrT75Z25 (C2H4 yield of
ca. 46% as well as 95% ethylene selectivity at 700 C) is remarkably
higher than that of the other nanocatalysts which reveals that the
better activity and ethylene selectivity of the CrT75Z25 nanocata-
lyst is due to the well-deﬁned morphology.

3.2.3. Time on stream performance
The catalytic activity of CrT75Z25 sample was tested for
600 min time on stream at constant temperature (700 C), feed
ratio and GHSV and the results are shown in Fig. 11. For this cata-
lyst, as the ethane conversion decreases, ethylene selectivity
increases. Ethane conversion and ethylene yield decrease from
47.6% and 45.5% to 34.3% and 33.5%, respectively, over 5 wt.%
Cr2O3/TiO2–ZrO2 after about 10 h reaction. The result depicts the
high and relatively stable catalytic activity during the reaction up
to 10 h for the CrT75Z25 nanocatalyst. This can be addressed by
utilizing the proper composition of support in synthesized TiO2–
ZrO2 combined support. Moreover, the addition of ZrO2 can pro-
mote the thermal stability of this nanocatalyst. On the other hand,
utilizing co-precipitation method in this research, due to excellent
catalytic properties such as small particle size, uniform distribu-
tion and enhanced interaction between active sites and the support
help to prevent deactivation of the catalyst aside from enhancing
catalytic activity. Hence, the CrT75Z25 nanocatalyst has mani-
fested itself as an appropriate nanocatalyst for the oxidative dehy-
drogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide due to its good activity
and long-term stability.
4. Conclusions
This investigation conﬁrms that the combination of TiO2 and
ZrO2 could lead to an interesting change in the support character
and improving catalytic activity and stability of Cr/TiO2–ZrO2
nanocatalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethy-
lene by carbon dioxide. The catalytic activity of Cr/TiO2–ZrO2 was
strongly dependent on the TiO2 and ZrO2 contents in the supports,
which combined supports have smaller particles, higher surface
area, and uniform morphology and these favored the better disper-
sion of active phase and the activation of reactants. Ethane conver-
sion reached the highest value (C2H6 conversion of 48% as well as
46% ethylene yield at 700 C) when 75 wt.% TiO2 and 25 wt.% ZrO2
were used in support composition which could be attributed to the
higher physicochemical properties of CrT75Z25 nanocatalyst.
