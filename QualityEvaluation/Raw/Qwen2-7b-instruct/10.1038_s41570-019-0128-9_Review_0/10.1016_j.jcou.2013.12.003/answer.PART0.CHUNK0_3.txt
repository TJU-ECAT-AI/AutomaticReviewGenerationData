[1] "In our previous study, ODH of nB with CO2 as the soft oxidant was investigated over VOx/SnO2ZrO2 catalyst and found that the presence of vanadium oxide and the involvement of CO2 significantly increase the activity."
[2] "However, the decline in the specific surface area after impregnation with vanadia is generally ascribed to various reasons such as, penetration of the deposited active vanadium oxide species into the pores of the support, narrowing pore diameter, blocking some of the pores, and solid-state reactions between the dispersed active oxide and the supporting oxide."
[3] "Interestingly, the rate of decrease in the conversion and selectivity in the case of CZ support was almost similar to VCZ sample and lower in comparison to VTZ sample."
[4] "The ODH of nB was also carried out over CZ and TZ supports at 600 °C and GHSV of 600 mL h−1 g−1 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6, the nB conversion and total C4 olefins selectivity over CZ support is 7.4% and 20.9%, respectively at 15 min. But the support TZ showed a poor activity (<3% conversion) at 15 min."
[5] "The catalytic redox cycle is facile which may be due to the redox cycle of the cerium sites near the vanadium sites."

1. The presence of vanadium oxide and CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane (nB) increases the activity of the VOx/SnO2ZrO2 catalyst.
2. The decline in the specific surface area after impregnation with vanadium oxide is due to factors like penetration of active vanadium oxide into support pores, narrowing of pore diameter, blocking of pores, and solid-state reactions between the active oxide and the support oxide.
3. The rate of decrease in conversion and selectivity for the CZ support is similar to the VCZ sample and lower compared to the VTZ sample.
4. The CZ support shows a conversion of 7.4% and a total C4 olefins selectivity of 20.9% at 15 minutes, while the TZ support has a poor activity with less than 3% conversion at 15 minutes.
5. The facile catalytic redox cycle in vanadium oxide-loaded catalysts might be due to the redox cycle of the cerium sites near the vanadium sites.

1. 在n-B的氧化脱氢（ODH）中，通过SnO2ZrO2催化剂的范德华氧化物和CO2的存在显著增加了活性。
2. 在浸渍后特定表面面积的下降通常归因于各种原因，例如活性范德华氧化物物种渗透到支持体的孔隙中、孔径变窄、堵塞部分孔隙以及分散活性氧化物与支持氧化物之间的固态反应。
3. CZ支持的转化率和总C4烯烃选择性降低的速度与VCZ样品相似，且低于VTZ样品。
4. 在600°C和GHSV为600 mL h−1 g−1催化剂的情况下，CZ支持的n-B转化率为7.4%，总C4烯烃选择性为20.9%。而TZ支持在15分钟时显示出较低的活性，转化率低于3%。
5. 催化剂中的红ox循环易于进行，这可能是由于铈位点附近的钒位点的红ox循环所致。
