[1] "The presence of vanadium oxide is very important to increase the activity and the support plays a vital role for stable catalytic activity."
[2] "Interestingly, the rate of decrease in the conversion and selectivity in the case of CZ support was almost similar to VCZ sample and lower in comparison to VTZ sample."
[3] "These results clearly reveal that support plays a critical role for the observed high and stable activity. This is mainly due to the facile oxygen transport from the bulk of cerium oxide solid solution that helps in the prevention of coke formation, which is the main deactivation pathway of these catalysts."
[4] "The change in the catalyst color and an increase in the weight of the catalyst were observed after the experiment. It is mainly due to formation of coke during the reaction."

The document highlights the importance of vanadium oxide in enhancing the activity of catalysts used in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The support material, in this case, ceria-zirconia (CZ) and titania-zirconia (TZ), plays a crucial role in providing stable and high activity. The rate of decrease in conversion and selectivity is affected by the type of support, with ceria-zirconia showing better performance compared to titania-zirconia. The facile oxygen transport from the bulk of cerium oxide solid solution in CZ supports helps prevent coke formation, a main deactivation pathway for these catalysts. Additionally, the formation of coke during the reaction is observed, indicating that coke buildup is responsible for the decline in catalytic activity.

文档强调了在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，氧化钒对于提高催化剂活性的重要性。支持材料，在这种情况下为铈锆（CZ）和钛锆（TZ），对提供稳定且高活性至关重要。转化率和选择性的下降速率受到支持物类型的影响，铈锆显示出更好的性能与钛锆相比。从铈氧化物固体溶液的大批量中容易运输氧气有助于防止催化剂失活的主要途径——焦炭形成。此外，在反应过程中观察到催化剂颜色变化和重量增加，这主要是由于焦炭形成导致的，表明焦炭积累是催化活性下降的原因。
