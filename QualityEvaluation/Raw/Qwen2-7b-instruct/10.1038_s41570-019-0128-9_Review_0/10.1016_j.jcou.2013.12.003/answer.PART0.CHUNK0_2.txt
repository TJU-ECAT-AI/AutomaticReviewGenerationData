[1] "The investigated mixed metal oxide supports namely, CeO2ZrO2 (CZ) and TiO2ZrO2 (TZ) were synthesized by coprecipitation method, and the vanadium oxide was deposited on the supports by wet impregnation method."
[2] "The catalytic performance was evaluated for the ODH of nB to C4 olefins in the vapor phase under normal atmospheric pressure employing CO2 as the soft oxidant."
[3] "The XRD analysis of CZ and CZ supported V2O5 samples revealed the formation of CexZr1xO2 solid solution and a highly dispersed vanadium oxide over the CZ support, respectively."
[4] "The TPR results confirm that TZ is quite stable which is primarily due to the formation of an amorphous or crystalline ZrTiO4 compound."
[5] "The ODH of nB was also carried out over CZ and TZ supports at 600 8C and GHSV of 600 mL h1 g1 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6, the nB conversion and total C4 olefins selectivity over CZ support is"
[6] "These results clearly reveal that support plays a critical role for the observed high and stable activity. This is mainly due to the facile oxygen transport from the bulk of cerium oxide solid solution that helps in the prevention of coke formation, which is the main deactivation pathway of these catalysts."

1. The vanadium oxide catalysts were prepared using a coprecipitation method for the supports, and a wet impregnation method for the vanadium oxide deposition.
2. The catalysts were evaluated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane to produce C4 olefins in the vapor phase under normal atmospheric pressure using CO2 as a soft oxidant.
3. The XRD analysis showed that the CZ support formed a CexZr1xO2 solid solution, while the vanadium oxide over CZ support was highly dispersed.
4. The TZ support, when calcined, formed an amorphous or crystalline ZrTiO4 compound, contributing to its stability.
5. Over the CZ support, the n-butane conversion and total C4 olefins selectivity were measured under specific conditions.
6. The support played a critical role in achieving high and stable catalytic activity, mainly due to the efficient oxygen transport from the bulk of the cerium oxide solid solution, preventing coke formation.

1. 使用沉淀法制备了支持材料，并通过浸渍法沉积了钒氧化物催化剂。
2. 催化剂在常压下，使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂，在n-丁烷的气相氧化脱氢反应中，评价了将C4烯烃转化为C4烯烃的能力。
3. X射线衍射分析显示，CZ支持形成了CexZr1xO2固溶体，而CZ上的钒氧化物分散良好。
4. 当煅烧TZ支持时，形成了一种非晶态或结晶态的ZrTiO4化合物，这对其稳定性有重要影响。
5. 在CZ支持下，测量了n-丁烷转化和总C4烯烃选择性，在特定条件下进行。
6. 支持在实现高稳定活性方面起着关键作用，主要原因是从铈氧化物固溶体的主体中高效地传输氧气，防止了焦炭的形成，这是这些催化剂的主要失活途径。
