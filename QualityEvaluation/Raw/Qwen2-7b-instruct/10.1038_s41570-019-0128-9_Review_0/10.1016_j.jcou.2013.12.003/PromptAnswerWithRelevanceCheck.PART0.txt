[1] "In our previous study, ODH of nB with CO2 as the soft oxidant was investigated over VOx/SnO2ZrO2 catalyst and found that the presence of vanadium oxide and the involvement of CO2 significantly increase the activity."
[2] "However, the decline in the specific surface area after impregnation with vanadia is generally ascribed to various reasons such as, penetration of the deposited active vanadium oxide species into the pores of the support, narrowing pore diameter, blocking some of the pores, and solid-state reactions between the dispersed active oxide and the supporting oxide."
[3] "Interestingly, the rate of decrease in the conversion and selectivity in the case of CZ support was almost similar to VCZ sample and lower in comparison to VTZ sample."
[4] "The ODH of nB was also carried out over CZ and TZ supports at 600 °C and GHSV of 600 mL h−1 g−1 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6, the nB conversion and total C4 olefins selectivity over CZ support is 7.4% and 20.9%, respectively at 15 min. But the support TZ showed a poor activity (<3% conversion) at 15 min."
[5] "The catalytic redox cycle is facile which may be due to the redox cycle of the cerium sites near the vanadium sites."

2. The decline in the specific surface area after impregnation with vanadium oxide is due to factors like penetration of active vanadium oxide into support pores, narrowing of pore diameter, blocking of pores, and solid-state reactions between the active oxide and the support oxide.
3. The rate of decrease in conversion and selectivity for the CZ support is similar to the VCZ sample and lower compared to the VTZ sample.
4. The CZ support shows a conversion of 7.4% and a total C4 olefins selectivity of 20.9% at 15 minutes, while the TZ support has a poor activity with less than 3% conversion at 15 minutes.
5. The facile catalytic redox cycle in vanadium oxide-loaded catalysts might be due to the redox cycle of the cerium sites near the vanadium sites.

The document highlights the importance of vanadium oxide in enhancing the activity of catalysts used in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The support material, in this case, ceria-zirconia (CZ) and titania-zirconia (TZ), plays a crucial role in providing stable and high activity. The rate of decrease in conversion and selectivity is affected by the type of support, with ceria-zirconia showing better performance compared to titania-zirconia. The facile oxygen transport from the bulk of cerium oxide solid solution in CZ supports helps prevent coke formation, a main deactivation pathway for these catalysts. Additionally, the formation of coke during the reaction is observed, indicating that coke buildup is responsible for the decline in catalytic activity.

文档强调了在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，氧化钒对于提高催化剂活性的重要性。支持材料，在这种情况下为铈锆（CZ）和钛锆（TZ），对提供稳定且高活性至关重要。转化率和选择性的下降速率受到支持物类型的影响，铈锆显示出更好的性能与钛锆相比。从铈氧化物固体溶液的大批量中容易运输氧气有助于防止催化剂失活的主要途径——焦炭形成。此外，在反应过程中观察到催化剂颜色变化和重量增加，这主要是由于焦炭形成导致的，表明焦炭积累是催化活性下降的原因。
