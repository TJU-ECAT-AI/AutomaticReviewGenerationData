[1] "The influence of different support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions was studied."
[2] "The reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, were also varied to optimize the performance of these catalysts."
[3] "The results showed that the choice of support material significantly affected the catalyst's performance."
[4] "In particular, the addition of CeO2 to the catalyst increased its activity and selectivity towards propylene production."
[5] "However, the stability of the catalysts was found to decrease with higher CO2 partial pressures."
[6] "Trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability were observed, necessitating careful selection of conditions and materials for optimal performance."

The use of various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, along with the variation of CO2 partial pressure, influences the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The study revealed that the choice of support material significantly impacts the catalyst's performance. Specifically, the incorporation of CeO2 enhances the catalyst's activity and selectivity towards propylene production. However, the stability of the catalysts decreases with higher CO2 partial pressures. Optimal performance requires balancing these factors through careful selection of conditions and materials.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，不同支持材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）以及CO2分压的变化，对铬氧化催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径有影响。研究发现，选择支持材料显著影响催化剂性能。特别是，将CeO2添加到催化剂中可以增加其活性和丙烯生成的选择性。然而，随着CO2分压的增加，催化剂稳定性会降低。为了达到最佳性能，需要平衡这些因素，通过仔细选择条件和材料进行优化。
