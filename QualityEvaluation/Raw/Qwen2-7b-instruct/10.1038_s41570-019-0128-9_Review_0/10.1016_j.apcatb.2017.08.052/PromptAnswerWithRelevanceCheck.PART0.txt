The use of various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, along with the variation of CO2 partial pressure, influences the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The study revealed that the choice of support material significantly impacts the catalyst's performance. Specifically, the incorporation of CeO2 enhances the catalyst's activity and selectivity towards propylene production. However, the stability of the catalysts decreases with higher CO2 partial pressures. Optimal performance requires balancing these factors through careful selection of conditions and materials.
