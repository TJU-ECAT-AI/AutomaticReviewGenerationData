[1] "The main objective of the present study is to identify the factors influencing ethylene selectivity, while finding the effectiveness of Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) mixed oxide as the support for Cr2O3, when oxygen or carbon dioxide is used as the oxidant."
[2] "Cr2O3/ZSM-5 [13], Cr2O3/Al2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2 [21], modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites [4], Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl monoliths [17], CrO, CrVO oxide [7], Ga incorporated Cr2O3 supported on ZSM-5 and silicalite [18] catalysts have been tried for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in presence of CO2."
[3] "CO2 as an oxidant offers higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2."
[4] "Stronger interaction of product ethylene with the catalyst surface may be the reason for decreased selectivity."

The document discusses how various support materials and reaction conditions affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It identifies Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) mixed oxide as an effective support for Cr2O3 catalysts when oxygen or carbon dioxide is used as the oxidant. It also mentions that CO2 as an oxidant provides higher ethylene selectivity compared to oxygen. The reduced selectivity when using oxygen could be due to stronger interaction of the product ethylene with the catalyst surface, leading to secondary oxidation.

文档讨论了不同支持材料和反应条件如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径。它确定了Al2O3ZrO2（1:1）混合氧化物作为Cr2O3催化剂的有效支持物，当使用氧气或二氧化碳作为氧化剂时。它还提到，二氧化碳作为氧化剂提供的乙二醇选择性高于氧气。当使用氧气时，选择性的降低可能是由于产物乙二醇与催化剂表面更强的相互作用导致二次氧化。
