[1] "The catalytic activity depended on the chromium species formed on the surface."
[2] "However, the selectivity to ethylene was influenced by the oxidizing agent (O2 or CO2)."
[3] "It is thought that this discrepancy in ethylene selectivity could be explained due to secondary oxidation of the product ethylene."
[4] "Better catalysts could be designed by incorporation of efficient promoters so as to decrease the strength of interaction of product ethylene with the surface to prevent secondary oxidation."

The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are significantly influenced by the support materials and reaction conditions. Different materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 offer varying performances due to their distinct properties. For instance, Al2O3 shows lower catalytic activity in terms of ethane and CO2 conversions compared to ZrO2, yet offers higher ethylene selectivity. The mixed oxide support is advantageous in achieving higher activity and selectivity towards ethylene compared to pure Al2O3. CO2 acts as a more effective oxidant than O2 in enhancing ethylene selectivity. The reduction in ethylene selectivity during reactions with O2 is attributed to secondary oxidation of ethylene, which is facilitated by stronger interactions between the product and the catalyst surface. Optimizing the overall performance of these catalysts involves addressing challenges related to activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways. This can be achieved through the strategic incorporation of efficient promoters that decrease the strength of ethylene interaction with the catalyst surface, thereby preventing secondary oxidation.

催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径受到支持材料和反应条件的影响。不同的材料如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2因特性不同而表现出不同的性能。例如，与ZrO2相比，Al2O3在乙烷和CO2转化方面的催化活性较低，但其乙烯选择性较高。混合氧化物支持比纯Al2O3更有利于实现更高的活性和乙烯选择性。CO2作为氧化剂比O2更能提高乙烯选择性。在使用O2进行反应时，乙烯选择性的降低归因于乙烯的二次氧化，这是由产品与催化剂表面更强的相互作用所促进的。通过优化活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径来优化这些催化剂的整体性能涉及解决与活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径相关的挑战。这可以通过战略性地引入能减少乙烯与催化剂表面相互作用强度的有效促进剂来实现，从而防止二次氧化。

[1] "Ethylene is used in the production of various industrially important products such as high and low density polyethylenes, polyvinyl chloride, ethylene glycol, styrene, ethylene oxide, vinyl acetate and ethyl benzene [1, 15]."
[2] "This process has several drawbacks like endothermicity of the reaction, thermodynamic limitation in the paraffin conversion and severe coke formation."
[3] "Catalytic ODE using molecular oxygen has emerged as a highly attractive alternative in overcoming these difficulties [12]."
[4] "However, the requirement of an air separation unit to generate pure oxygen, thermal run-away of reaction and the difficulty of controlling ethylene selectivity are the major issues associated with this process [2, 12, 14]."

1. Various support materials, including SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include dealing with the endothermicity of the reaction, thermodynamic limitations in paraffin conversion, severe coke formation, and the need for an air separation unit to generate pure oxygen. The use of CO2 as an oxidant is considered a mild alternative, offering advantages such as containing the exothermicity of the reaction, high equilibrium conversion, improved ethylene selectivity, reduced coke formation, and longer catalyst lifetime.

2. Reaction conditions, such as CO2 partial pressure, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Improving the conversions of ethane and CO2, as well as ethylene selectivity, is crucial. The study focuses on identifying factors affecting ethylene selectivity and assessing the effectiveness of Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) mixed oxide as a support for Cr2O3 when oxygen or carbon dioxide is used as the oxidant.

3. The use of CO2 as an oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane offers several benefits, including containing the exothermicity of the reaction, high equilibrium conversion, improved ethylene selectivity, reduced coke formation, and longer catalyst lifetime. However, much work is still needed to enhance the conversions of ethane and CO2, as well as ethylene selectivity, and to contain catalyst deactivation. Ethylene selectivity is also a factor that requires more attention.

4. The factors influencing ethylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane are not fully understood. The study aims to identify these factors and assess the effectiveness of Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) mixed oxide as a support for Cr2O3 when oxygen or carbon dioxide is used as the oxidant. The study also evaluates the use of various chromium oxide catalysts with different support materials for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2.

5. The reduction in ethylene selectivity during oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with oxygen could be attributed to secondary oxidation of ethylene. The stronger interaction of product ethylene with the catalyst surface is another possible reason for the decreased selectivity.

3. 使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂在乙烷脱氢中的应用提供了几个优势，包括控制反应热、高平衡转化率、提高乙炔选择性、减少焦炭形成和延长催化剂寿命。然而，仍需要大量工作来增强乙烷和二氧化碳的转化率，以及乙炔选择性，并防止催化剂失活。乙炔选择性也是一个需要更多关注的因素。

4. 影响乙烷氧化脱氢过程中乙炔选择性的因素尚不完全清楚。研究旨在识别这些因素，并评估Al2O3ZrO2（1:1）混合氧化物作为Cr2O3支持的有效性，当氧气或二氧化碳用作氧化剂时。研究还评估了不同支持材料的铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳存在下的乙烷氧化脱氢应用。

[1] "The conversion of ethane increases with rise in chromia content up to 15 wt%. Further increase in loading decreases the conversions of both the reactants."
[2] "Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42 % ethane conversion) but with a decreased ethylene selectivity (36 %)."
[3] "The activity data obtained on the present catalysts corroborates this observation. The higher basicity of Al2O3 than that of ZrO2 may be the reason for decrease in the activity."
[4] "The conversion of ethane is always higher when the reaction is conducted with O2 compared to that in CO2 in the entire temperature region studied. However, the selectivity to ethylene is very low when oxygen is the oxidant."
[5] "From the above results, one can notice that even if the amount of ethylene formed is higher in the case of O2 as the oxidant, because ethylene stays for a longer time on the surface due to strong interaction, it is subjected to secondary oxidation thus leading to reduced ethylene selectivity."

The use of various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influences the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 and MCM-41 are reported to enhance activity, while H-ZSM-5 shows improved selectivity. Al2O3 and ZrO2 are noted to affect the redox properties of the catalysts, with ZrO2 generally leading to higher activity. CeO2 introduces oxygen species, enhancing the activity. Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, also play a significant role in determining the catalyst's performance. Higher CO2 pressures tend to improve activity, but this comes with a trade-off in selectivity. The presence of oxygen as an oxidant leads to lower ethylene selectivity due to secondary oxidation of the product. The key challenges involve optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity, managing the redox properties of the catalysts, and understanding the mechanistic pathways involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Trade-offs exist between achieving high activity and maintaining high selectivity, necessitating careful selection of support materials and optimization of reaction conditions.

1. The global production of ethylene is around 160 million tons per year, growing at an average rate of 4% annually. Ethylene is typically produced through steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks such as natural gas and naphtha. CO2 is recognized as a mild oxidant in ethane dehydrogenation because it helps manage the exothermicity of the reaction, provides a high equilibrium conversion, improves ethylene selectivity, reduces coke formation, and extends catalyst lifespan.

2. Mixed oxide supports, particularly those combining Al2O3 and ZrO2 in a 1:1 ratio, offer higher activity and ethylene selectivity compared to Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. 

3. When CO2 is used as an oxidant, the ethylene selectivity is superior to that achieved with oxygen.

4. The decrease in ethylene selectivity during oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen might result from secondary oxidation of the product ethylene. This occurs due to a stronger interaction between the product ethylene and the catalyst surface, which impedes selectivity enhancement.
