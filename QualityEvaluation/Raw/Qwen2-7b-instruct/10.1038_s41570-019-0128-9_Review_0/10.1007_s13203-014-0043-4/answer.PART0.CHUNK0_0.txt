[1] "The catalytic activity depended on the chromium species formed on the surface."
[2] "However, the selectivity to ethylene was influenced by the oxidizing agent (O2 or CO2)."
[3] "It is thought that this discrepancy in ethylene selectivity could be explained due to secondary oxidation of the product ethylene."
[4] "Better catalysts could be designed by incorporation of efficient promoters so as to decrease the strength of interaction of product ethylene with the surface to prevent secondary oxidation."

The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are significantly influenced by the support materials and reaction conditions. Different materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 offer varying performances due to their distinct properties. For instance, Al2O3 shows lower catalytic activity in terms of ethane and CO2 conversions compared to ZrO2, yet offers higher ethylene selectivity. The mixed oxide support is advantageous in achieving higher activity and selectivity towards ethylene compared to pure Al2O3. CO2 acts as a more effective oxidant than O2 in enhancing ethylene selectivity. The reduction in ethylene selectivity during reactions with O2 is attributed to secondary oxidation of ethylene, which is facilitated by stronger interactions between the product and the catalyst surface. Optimizing the overall performance of these catalysts involves addressing challenges related to activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways. This can be achieved through the strategic incorporation of efficient promoters that decrease the strength of ethylene interaction with the catalyst surface, thereby preventing secondary oxidation.

催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径受到支持材料和反应条件的影响。不同的材料如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2因特性不同而表现出不同的性能。例如，与ZrO2相比，Al2O3在乙烷和CO2转化方面的催化活性较低，但其乙烯选择性较高。混合氧化物支持比纯Al2O3更有利于实现更高的活性和乙烯选择性。CO2作为氧化剂比O2更能提高乙烯选择性。在使用O2进行反应时，乙烯选择性的降低归因于乙烯的二次氧化，这是由产品与催化剂表面更强的相互作用所促进的。通过优化活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径来优化这些催化剂的整体性能涉及解决与活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径相关的挑战。这可以通过战略性地引入能减少乙烯与催化剂表面相互作用强度的有效促进剂来实现，从而防止二次氧化。
