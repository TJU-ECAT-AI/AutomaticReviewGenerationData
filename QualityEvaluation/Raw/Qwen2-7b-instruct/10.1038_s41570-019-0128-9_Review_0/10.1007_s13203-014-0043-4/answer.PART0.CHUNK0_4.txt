1. The global production of ethylene is around 160 million tons per year, growing at an average rate of 4% annually. Ethylene is typically produced through steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks such as natural gas and naphtha. CO2 is recognized as a mild oxidant in ethane dehydrogenation because it helps manage the exothermicity of the reaction, provides a high equilibrium conversion, improves ethylene selectivity, reduces coke formation, and extends catalyst lifespan.

2. Mixed oxide supports, particularly those combining Al2O3 and ZrO2 in a 1:1 ratio, offer higher activity and ethylene selectivity compared to Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. 

3. When CO2 is used as an oxidant, the ethylene selectivity is superior to that achieved with oxygen.

4. The decrease in ethylene selectivity during oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen might result from secondary oxidation of the product ethylene. This occurs due to a stronger interaction between the product ethylene and the catalyst surface, which impedes selectivity enhancement.

1. 乙烯的全球产量约为每年1.6亿吨，平均增长率为4%。乙烯通常通过蒸汽裂解天然气和石脑油等烃类原料生产。二氧化碳被视为乙烷脱氢的温和氧化剂，因为它有助于控制反应的放热性，提供高平衡转化率，提高乙烷选择性，减少焦炭形成，并延长催化剂寿命。

2. 特别是结合了Al2O3和ZrO2以1:1比例的混合氧化物支持，与Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂相比，能提供更高的活性和乙烷选择性。

3. 当使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂时，乙烷选择性优于使用氧气的情况。

4. 在使用氧气进行氧化脱氢过程中，乙烷选择性的下降可能是由于产物乙烷的二次氧化所致。这是由于产物乙烷与催化剂表面之间更强的相互作用阻碍了选择性的提升。
