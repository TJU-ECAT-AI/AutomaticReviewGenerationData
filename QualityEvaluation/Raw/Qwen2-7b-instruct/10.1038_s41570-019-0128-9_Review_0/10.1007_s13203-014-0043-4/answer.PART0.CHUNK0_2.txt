[1] "The conversion of ethane increases with rise in chromia content up to 15 wt%. Further increase in loading decreases the conversions of both the reactants."
[2] "Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42 % ethane conversion) but with a decreased ethylene selectivity (36 %)."
[3] "The activity data obtained on the present catalysts corroborates this observation. The higher basicity of Al2O3 than that of ZrO2 may be the reason for decrease in the activity."
[4] "The conversion of ethane is always higher when the reaction is conducted with O2 compared to that in CO2 in the entire temperature region studied. However, the selectivity to ethylene is very low when oxygen is the oxidant."
[5] "From the above results, one can notice that even if the amount of ethylene formed is higher in the case of O2 as the oxidant, because ethylene stays for a longer time on the surface due to strong interaction, it is subjected to secondary oxidation thus leading to reduced ethylene selectivity."

The use of various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influences the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 and MCM-41 are reported to enhance activity, while H-ZSM-5 shows improved selectivity. Al2O3 and ZrO2 are noted to affect the redox properties of the catalysts, with ZrO2 generally leading to higher activity. CeO2 introduces oxygen species, enhancing the activity. Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, also play a significant role in determining the catalyst's performance. Higher CO2 pressures tend to improve activity, but this comes with a trade-off in selectivity. The presence of oxygen as an oxidant leads to lower ethylene selectivity due to secondary oxidation of the product. The key challenges involve optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity, managing the redox properties of the catalysts, and understanding the mechanistic pathways involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Trade-offs exist between achieving high activity and maintaining high selectivity, necessitating careful selection of support materials and optimization of reaction conditions.

各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中对铬氧化催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径产生影响。SiO2和MCM-41被报道能提高活性，而H-ZSM-5则显示出更高的选择性。Al2O3和ZrO2影响催化剂的还原氧化性质，其中ZrO2通常带来更高的活性。CeO2引入氧物种，增强活性。反应条件，特别是二氧化碳分压，也对催化剂性能有重要影响。较高的二氧化碳压力倾向于提高活性，但这伴随着选择性的下降。氧气作为氧化剂导致乙二醇选择性降低，因为产品被二次氧化。关键挑战包括在活性与选择性之间寻找平衡，管理催化剂的还原氧化性质，并理解氧化脱氢过程中的反应机制。需要仔细选择支持材料并优化反应条件来实现这些挑战。存在在实现高活性同时保持高选择性之间的权衡。
