[1] "Ethylene is used in the production of various industrially important products such as high and low density polyethylenes, polyvinyl chloride, ethylene glycol, styrene, ethylene oxide, vinyl acetate and ethyl benzene [1, 15]."
[2] "This process has several drawbacks like endothermicity of the reaction, thermodynamic limitation in the paraffin conversion and severe coke formation."
[3] "Catalytic ODE using molecular oxygen has emerged as a highly attractive alternative in overcoming these difficulties [12]."
[4] "However, the requirement of an air separation unit to generate pure oxygen, thermal run-away of reaction and the difficulty of controlling ethylene selectivity are the major issues associated with this process [2, 12, 14]."
[5] "CO2 is now considered as a mild oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its advantages in containing the exothermicity of the reaction, its role as a diluent in offering high equilibrium conversion, improving the selectivity to ethylene, reducing coke formation and maintaining longer catalyst life time [13, 23]."
[6] "Nevertheless, much work is needed in improving the conversions of ethane and CO2 and ethylene selectivity, apart from containing catalyst deactivation."
[7] "The factors influencing ethylene selectivity also have not been given much attention."
[8] "The main objective of the present study is to identify the factors influencing ethylene selectivity, while finding the effectiveness of Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) mixed oxide as the support for Cr2O3, when oxygen or carbon dioxide is used as the oxidant."
[9] "Cr2O3/ZSM-5 [13], Cr2O3/Al2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2 [21], modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites [4], Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl monoliths [17], CrO, CrVO oxide [7], Ga incorporated Cr2O3 supported on ZSM-5 and silicalite [18] catalysts have been tried for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in presence of CO2."
[10] "The reduction in ethylene selectivity during ODE with O2 could be due to secondary oxidation of ethylene. Stronger interaction of product ethylene with the catalyst surface may be the reason for decreased selectivity."

1. Various support materials, including SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, affect the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include dealing with the endothermicity of the reaction, thermodynamic limitations in paraffin conversion, severe coke formation, and the need for an air separation unit to generate pure oxygen. The use of CO2 as an oxidant is considered a mild alternative, offering advantages such as containing the exothermicity of the reaction, high equilibrium conversion, improved ethylene selectivity, reduced coke formation, and longer catalyst lifetime.

2. Reaction conditions, such as CO2 partial pressure, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Improving the conversions of ethane and CO2, as well as ethylene selectivity, is crucial. The study focuses on identifying factors affecting ethylene selectivity and assessing the effectiveness of Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) mixed oxide as a support for Cr2O3 when oxygen or carbon dioxide is used as the oxidant.

3. The use of CO2 as an oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane offers several benefits, including containing the exothermicity of the reaction, high equilibrium conversion, improved ethylene selectivity, reduced coke formation, and longer catalyst lifetime. However, much work is still needed to enhance the conversions of ethane and CO2, as well as ethylene selectivity, and to contain catalyst deactivation. Ethylene selectivity is also a factor that requires more attention.

4. The factors influencing ethylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane are not fully understood. The study aims to identify these factors and assess the effectiveness of Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) mixed oxide as a support for Cr2O3 when oxygen or carbon dioxide is used as the oxidant. The study also evaluates the use of various chromium oxide catalysts with different support materials for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2.

5. The reduction in ethylene selectivity during oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with oxygen could be attributed to secondary oxidation of ethylene. The stronger interaction of product ethylene with the catalyst surface is another possible reason for the decreased selectivity.
