[1] "Despite the large number of volumes published, an organized collection of information about the mechanisms concerning the many reactions in which CO2 is involved does not exist."
[2] "This book has been designed with the precise idea of filling the gap and collecting the knowledge we have of the reaction mechanism of CO2 conversion when it is used either as a building block for the production of chemicals and materials, or as a carbon source for C1 and Cn energy-rich molecules."
[3] "This book covers 40 years of research efforts in understanding the reactivity of CO2."
[4] "Its aim is not to present an exhaustive list of all reactions in which CO2 can be involved, even if it shows quite a large number of them, but to analyze the thermodynamics and kinetics of its conversion."

The document discusses the lack of comprehensive information on the reaction mechanisms involving carbon dioxide (CO2), which is central to addressing climate change due to its potential role in atmospheric CO2 levels. The book aims to fill this gap by collecting knowledge on the conversion of CO2 into valuable products, focusing on its use as a building block for chemical production or as a carbon source for energy-rich molecules. It covers 40 years of research on CO2 reactivity, analyzing the thermodynamics and kinetics of its conversion rather than presenting an exhaustive list of all possible reactions.

文献讨论了关于CO2参与反应的机制缺乏全面信息的问题，这是由于其在气候变化中可能对大气CO2水平的影响而成为科学和技术界关注的焦点。本书旨在填补这一空白，通过收集有关CO2转换的知识，重点关注将其用作化学生产的基本组成部分或作为C1和Cn能源丰富分子的碳源。它涵盖了40年的CO2反应性研究，分析了CO2转换的热力学和动力学，而不是列出所有可能反应的详尽列表。
