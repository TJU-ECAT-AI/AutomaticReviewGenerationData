[1] "Despite the large number of volumes published, an organized collection of information about the mechanisms concerning the many reactions in which CO2 is involved does not exist."
[2] "Industry is also much involved, as witnessed by the ever growing number of industrial patents and new processes."
[3] "The book covers 40 years of research efforts in understanding the reactivity of CO2."
[4] "Its aim is not to present an exhaustive list of all reactions in which CO2 can be involved, even if it shows quite a large number of them, but to analyze the thermodynamics and kinetics of its conversion."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure, can significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. These factors can influence how efficiently the catalysts convert CO2 into desired products. Key challenges in optimizing the overall performance often involve balancing these parameters to achieve high conversion rates while maintaining product selectivity and catalyst stability. Trade-offs might include choosing a support material that enhances selectivity at the cost of reduced activity, or adjusting the reaction conditions to improve both activity and selectivity but potentially compromising stability.

The document discusses the lack of comprehensive information on the reaction mechanisms involving carbon dioxide (CO2), which is central to addressing climate change due to its potential role in atmospheric CO2 levels. The book aims to fill this gap by collecting knowledge on the conversion of CO2 into valuable products, focusing on its use as a building block for chemical production or as a carbon source for energy-rich molecules. It covers 40 years of research on CO2 reactivity, analyzing the thermodynamics and kinetics of its conversion rather than presenting an exhaustive list of all possible reactions.
