[1] "Despite the large number of volumes published, an organized collection of information about the mechanisms concerning the many reactions in which CO2 is involved does not exist."
[2] "The conversion of CO2 into added-value products (chemicals, materials, fuels) is today one of the most widespread research themes, and the scientific literature presents a large number of reviews, papers and books that disclose the CO2 chemistry or, in general, utilization."

The various support materials and reaction conditions significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 can alter the surface properties and thus affect the catalytic performance. Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, can influence the reactivity and product distribution. Key challenges in optimizing the overall performance of these catalysts include achieving a balance between high activity and selectivity, maintaining stability over time, and understanding the complex mechanistic pathways involved in the CO2 conversion process.
