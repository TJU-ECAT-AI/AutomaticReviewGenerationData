[1] "Despite the large number of volumes published, an organized collection of information about the mechanisms concerning the many reactions in which CO2 is involved does not exist."
[2] "This book has been designed with the precise idea of filling the gap and collecting the knowledge we have of the reaction mechanism of CO2 conversion when it is used either as a building block for the production of chemicals and materials, or as a carbon source for C1 and Cn energy-rich molecules."
[3] "The book covers 40 years of research efforts in understanding the reactivity of CO2."
[4] "Its aim is not to present an exhaustive list of all reactions in which CO2 can be involved, even if it shows quite a large number of them, but to analyze the thermodynamics and kinetics of its conversion."

The various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and different reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. These factors play crucial roles in determining the overall performance of the catalysts. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their performance include achieving high activity while maintaining selectivity and stability under practical reaction conditions. The book covers 40 years of research efforts in understanding the reactivity of CO2, aiming to analyze the thermodynamics and kinetics of its conversion rather than presenting an exhaustive list of all possible reactions involving CO2.

各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，以及不同的反应条件，包括CO2分压，影响了二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径。这些因素在决定催化剂的整体性能方面起着关键作用。优化其性能的关键挑战和权衡包括在实际反应条件下实现高活性的同时保持选择性和稳定性。该书涵盖了40年的研究努力，以理解二氧化碳的反应性，并旨在分析其转换的热力学和动力学，而不是提供所有可能涉及CO2的所有反应的详尽列表。
