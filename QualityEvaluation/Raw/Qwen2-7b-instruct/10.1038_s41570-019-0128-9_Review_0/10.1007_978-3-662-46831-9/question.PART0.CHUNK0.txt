I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Printed on acid-free paper Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg is part of Springer Science+Business Media (www.springer.com) Lella, Gianluca, Brunella, Manuela, Mattia, Nicolo, Federica, Gabriele, Lorenzo Gianluca, Rosangela Milena, Chiara ThiS is a FM Blank Page Preface Carbon dioxide (CO2) is today at the centre of attention of the scientific and technological world because of its potential role in climate change, which is supposed to be, directly or indirectly, caused by the growing level of CO2 in the atmosphere. Policy-makers work out solutions ranging over a large number of options, including carbon capture and disposal or sequestration (CCS) or carbon capture and utilization (CCU).
The conversion of CO2 into added-value products (chemicals, materials, fuels) is today one of the most widespread research themes, and the scientific literature presents a large number of reviews, papers and books that disclose the CO2 chemistry or, in general, utilization. Industry is also much involved, as witnessed by the ever growing number of industrial patents and new processes.
Despite the large number of volumes published, an organized collection of information about the mechanisms concerning the many reactions in which CO2 is involved does not exist. However, this book has been designed with the precise idea of filling the gap and collecting the knowledge we have of the reaction mechanism of CO2 conversion when it is used either as a building block for the production of chemicals and materials, or as a carbon source for C1 and Cn energy- rich molecules.
This book covers 40 years of research efforts in understanding the reactivity of
CO2. Its aim is not to present an exhaustive list of all reactions in which CO2 can be
involved, even if it shows quite a large number of them, but to analyze the thermodynamics and kinetics of its conversion.
The book is organized in ten chapters, each devoted to a particular subject.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
