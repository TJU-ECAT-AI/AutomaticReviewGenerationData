          "Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K."
          "The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significatively the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction."
          "In the ODE with CO2 over CeO2 catalyst, CeO2 plays the role of a redox catalyst."
          "The redox properties and the ability to store and release oxygen of CeO2 are also seen when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE."
          "The selectivity to C2H4 of the heterogeneous reaction can be higher than 90% under a proper catalyst composition and reaction condition, and that in addition to H2O, CO is the only non-selective product."
          "Ceria-based catalysts are able to activate CO2 and to use it as a selective oxidant for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane."

          Ceria catalysts demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, contributing significantly to the formation of C2H4 through heterogeneous catalysis within the temperature range of 953-993 K. The incorporation of calcium ions in the ceria crystalline network enhances the selectivity for ethene and CO2's efficiency as an oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction. In the context of CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation over CeO2 catalysts, ceria acts as a redox catalyst, capable of storing and releasing oxygen, which is also utilized when CO2 serves as an oxygen source or oxidant. Under optimal conditions, the selectivity for C2H4 in the heterogeneous reaction can surpass 90%, with CO being the sole non-selective product besides H2O. Ceria-based catalysts are adept at activating CO2 and employing it as a selective oxidant for ethane oxidehydrogenation.

          在953-993 K的温度范围内，铈基催化剂在乙烷与二氧化碳的氧化氢化反应中展现出高活性和选择性，对乙烯的形成实际贡献高达75-55%，且通过异相催化作用实现。铈晶格网络中钙离子的固溶体显著提升了乙烯的选择性和二氧化碳作为异相反应中氧化剂的效率。在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，铈氧化物作为红氧化/还原催化剂发挥作用，能够存储和释放氧气，当二氧化碳用作氧源或氧化剂时这一特性同样显现。在合理的催化剂组成和反应条件下，异相反应中乙烯的选择性可超过90%，除水外，二氧化碳是唯一的非选择性产物。铈基催化剂能够激活二氧化碳，并将其作为选择性氧化剂用于乙烷氧化氢化反应。

          "In the presence of both catalysts, the conversion of ethene increases, but the most relevant feature is that the dissociation reaction of CO2 proceeds following the reaction equation (1), its conversion being equal or higher than that of ethane."
          "On pure ceria, the rate of CO formation exceeds that of ethene formation."
          "The selectivity to olefin is highly increased by the solid solution of calcium ions in the cubic framework of CeO2."
          "The features for this reaction are that the selectivity to C2H4 of the heterogeneous reaction can be higher than 90% under a proper catalyst composition and reaction condition, and that in addition to H2O, CO is the only non-selective product."

          With both catalysts present, the conversion of ethene increases, highlighting that the CO2 dissociation reaction follows Equation (1), with its conversion equal to or exceeding that of ethane. On pure ceria, the formation rate of CO surpasses that of ethene. The introduction of calcium ions in the cubic structure of CeO2 significantly boosts the selectivity for olefin formation. This reaction exhibits a high degree of selectivity towards C2H4 formation in the heterogeneous reaction, which can exceed 90% under appropriate catalyst composition and reaction conditions, with CO being the exclusive non-selective product besides water.

          当两种催化剂共存时，乙烯的转化率增加，关键在于CO2的分解反应遵循方程（1），其转化率等于或高于乙烷。在纯铈氧化物上，CO的形成速率超过了乙烯。在立方结构的铈氧化物中加入钙离子显著提高了烯烃选择性。这种反应在异相条件下对C2H4形成的高选择性可超过90%，此外只有水是唯一的非选择性产物，CO是唯一的非选择性产物。
