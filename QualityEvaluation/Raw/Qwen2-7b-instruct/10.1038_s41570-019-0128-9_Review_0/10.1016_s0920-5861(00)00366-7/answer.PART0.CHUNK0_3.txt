[1] "Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K."
[2] "The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significantly the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction."
[3] "It was found that this is a real heterogeneous catalytic reaction over CeO2 catalysts."
[4] "The redox Ce+4/Ce+3 of CeO2 can be used for the activation of CO2 and to produce active oxygen species for the reaction."
[5] "In the presence of both catalysts, the conversion of ethene increases, but the most relevant feature is that the dissociation reaction of CO2 proceeds following the reaction equation (1), its conversion being equal or higher than that of ethane."
[6] "On pure ceria, the rate of CO formation exceeds that of ethene formation."
[7] "The selectivity to olefin is highly increased by the solid solution of calcium ions in the cubic framework of CeO2."
[8] "The features for this reaction are that the selectivity to C2H4 of the heterogeneous reaction can be higher than 90% under a proper catalyst composition and reaction condition, and that in addition to H2O, CO is the only non-selective product."

1. Ceria catalysts were found to be effective and selective for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, contributing 75-55% to the formation of C2H4 under certain conditions. The presence of calcium ions in the ceria structure enhanced the selectivity for ethene and improved CO2's efficiency as an oxidant in the heterogeneous process.

2. Ceria-based catalysts exhibited a complex reaction mechanism involving both gas-phase dehydrogenation and surface heterogeneous catalysis. The redox properties of CeO2 enabled its use as an activator for CO2 and producer of reactive oxygen species.

3. The presence of calcium ions in the ceria catalyst led to an increase in ethene selectivity and CO2's role as an efficient oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction.

4. The overall reaction over ceria catalysts involved the reduction of ceria by ethane followed by its oxidation by CO2, leading to the formation of ethene and water.

5. The selectivity to olefin in the heterogeneous reaction could exceed 90% under optimized conditions, with CO being the only non-selective product besides water.

6. Proper catalyst composition and reaction conditions allowed for a high degree of selectivity towards C2H4 formation, enhancing the practical applicability of this process for carbon utilization.
