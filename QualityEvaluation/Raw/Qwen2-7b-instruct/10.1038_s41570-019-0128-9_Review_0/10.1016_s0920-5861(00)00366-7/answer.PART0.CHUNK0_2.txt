Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K. The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significantly the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction.

The ceria catalysts showed high activity and selectivity in the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. The actual contribution for the formation of C2H4 through heterogeneous catalysis ranged from 75% to 55% within the temperature range of 953 to 993 K. Adding calcium ions to the ceria network enhanced the selectivity towards ethene and improved CO2's efficiency as an oxidant in the reaction.

It was found that this is a real heterogeneous catalytic reaction over CeO2 catalysts. It was concluded that CeO2 is active and selective for the ODE with CO2. The redox Ce+4/Ce+3 of CeO2 can be used for the activation of CO2 and to produce active oxygen species for the reaction.

It was determined that this process is a genuine heterogeneous catalytic reaction over CeO2 catalysts. It was concluded that CeO2 is effective and specific for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. The reversible redox states of Ce+4/Ce+3 in CeO2 can activate CO2 and generate reactive oxygen species for the reaction.

In our preliminary investigation [7], we examined the contributions of both homogeneous and heterogeneous processes in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 on pure ceria. It was discovered that this process actually represents a true heterogeneous catalytic reaction over ceria-based catalysts.

In the presence of both catalysts, the conversion of ethene increases, but the most relevant feature is that the dissociation reaction of CO2 proceeds following the reaction equation (1), its conversion being equal or higher than that of ethane. The reaction products are the same in the three cases, but their distribution varies: in the presence of catalysts, the yield of ethene increases while that of methane shows practically no change.

With both catalysts present, the conversion of ethene rises, yet the key observation is that the CO2 dissociation reaction adheres to Equation (1), with its conversion matching or exceeding that of ethane. Regardless of the catalysts' presence, the end products remain consistent, but their proportions differ: ethene's yield increases, whereas methane's remains nearly unchanged.

在两种催化剂共存的情况下，乙烯的转化率提高，但关键特征是CO2的分解反应遵循方程（1），其转化率与乙烷相当或更高。无论催化剂是否存在，最终产物相同，但比例不同：乙烯的产率增加，而甲烷几乎不变。

Taking into account the different stoichiometry between ethane and CO2 in the two heterogeneous re- actions (2) and (5) and their formation rates, it is possible to calculate the effectiveness of CO2 for selective oxidation (i.e. the percentage of CO2 taking part in the selective ODE reaction (2)) and the actual contribution from heterogeneous ODE with CO2 to the formation of C2H4 over CeO2.

Considering the differing chemical compositions between ethane and CO2 in the two heterogeneous reactions (2) and (5) along with their respective production rates, it is feasible to determine the effectiveness of CO2 in selective oxidation (the proportion of CO2 participating in the selective ODE reaction (2)) and the genuine contribution of the heterogeneous ODE with CO2 to the production of C2H4 over ceria catalysts.
