<quotes>
Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K.
The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significatively the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction.
In the ODE with CO2 over CeO2 catalyst, CeO2 plays the role of a redox catalyst. Therefore, we suggest that the catalytic reaction is carried out via the reduction of the catalyst by C2H6 and its oxidation by CO2, expressed as follows:2CeO2 + C2H6 Ce2O3 + C2H4 + H2O (6) Ce2O3 + CO2 2CeO2 + CO (7)
The overall reaction, i.e. (6)+(7), is reaction (2).
Therefore, the redox properties and the ability to store and release oxygen of CeO2 are also seen when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE.
The selectivity to C2H4 of the heterogeneous reaction can be higher than 90% under a proper catalyst composition and reaction condition, and that in addition to H2O, CO is the only non-selective product.

1. Ceria catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity in the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, contributing 75-55% to the formation of C2H4 through heterogeneous catalysis in the temperature range of 953-993 K. The addition of calcium ions in the ceria crystalline network significantly enhances the selectivity towards ethene and improves CO2's efficiency as an oxidant.

2. In the context of the ODE with CO2 over CeO2 catalysts, ceria functions as a redox catalyst, facilitating the reaction through the reduction of the catalyst by C2H6 followed by its oxidation by CO2. The overall reaction combines steps (6) and (7).

3. Proper catalyst composition and reaction conditions allow for a selectivity to C2H4 exceeding 90% in the heterogeneous reaction. CO is identified as the sole non-selective product, alongside H2O.

In the presence of both catalysts, the conversion of ethene increases, but the most relevant feature is that the dissociation reaction of CO2 proceeds following the reaction equation (1), its conversion being equal or higher than that of ethane. The reaction products are the same in the three cases, but their distribution varies: in the presence of catalysts, the yield of ethene increases while that of methane shows practically no change.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
With both catalysts present, the conversion of ethene rises, yet the key observation is that the CO2 dissociation reaction adheres to Equation (1), with its conversion matching or exceeding that of ethane. Regardless of the catalysts' presence, the end products remain consistent, but their proportions differ: ethene's yield increases, whereas methane's remains nearly unchanged.
