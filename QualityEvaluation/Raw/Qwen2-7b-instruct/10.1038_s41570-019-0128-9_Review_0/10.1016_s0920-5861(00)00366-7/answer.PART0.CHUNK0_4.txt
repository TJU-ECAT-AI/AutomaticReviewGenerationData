Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K.
The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significatively the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction.
In the ODE with CO2 over CeO2 catalyst, CeO2 plays the role of a redox catalyst.
The redox properties and the ability to store and release oxygen of CeO2 are also seen when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE.
The selectivity to C2H4 of the heterogeneous reaction can be higher than 90% under a proper catalyst composition and reaction condition, and that in addition to H2O, CO is the only non-selective product.
Ceria-based catalysts are able to activate CO2 and to use it as a selective oxidant for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane.
A more detailed study on the oxidehydrogenation of other light alkanes with CO2 on CeO2 and CeO2-based catalysts is now underway.

1. Ceria catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity in the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, contributing 75-55% of C2H4 formation through heterogeneous catalysis in the specified temperature range. The incorporation of calcium ions in the ceria structure enhances ethene selectivity and CO2's effectiveness as an oxidant.
2. In the context of CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, ceria-based catalysts play a redox role, effectively activating CO2 as an oxygen source or oxidant.
3. Under optimal conditions, the heterogeneous reaction yields a selectivity for C2H4 greater than 90%, with water being the only non-selective product besides CO.
4. The ceria catalyst's ability to selectively oxidize ethane using CO2 as a reagent is a key feature of this process, offering potential applications in the utilization of carbon-containing products.
5. Further research is currently being conducted to explore the oxidehydrogenation of other light alkanes with CO2 on ceria and ceria-based catalysts, aiming to expand the applicability of this technology.
