Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K.
The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significatively the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction.
In the ODE with CO2 over CeO2 catalyst, CeO2 plays the role of a redox catalyst. Therefore, we suggest that the catalytic reaction is carried out via the reduction of the catalyst by C2H6 and its oxidation by CO2, expressed as follows:2CeO2 + C2H6 Ce2O3 + C2H4 + H2O (6) Ce2O3 + CO2 2CeO2 + CO (7)
The overall reaction, i.e. (6)+(7), is reaction (2).
Therefore, the redox properties and the ability to store and release oxygen of CeO2 are also seen when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE.
The selectivity to C2H4 of the heterogeneous reaction can be higher than 90% under a proper catalyst composition and reaction condition, and that in addition to H2O, CO is the only non-selective product.

1. Ceria catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity in the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, contributing 75-55% to the formation of C2H4 through heterogeneous catalysis in the temperature range of 953-993 K. The addition of calcium ions in the ceria crystalline network significantly enhances the selectivity towards ethene and improves CO2's efficiency as an oxidant.

2. In the context of the ODE with CO2 over CeO2 catalysts, ceria functions as a redox catalyst, facilitating the reaction through the reduction of the catalyst by C2H6 followed by its oxidation by CO2. The overall reaction combines steps (6) and (7).

3. Proper catalyst composition and reaction conditions allow for a selectivity to C2H4 exceeding 90% in the heterogeneous reaction. CO is identified as the sole non-selective product, alongside H2O.

1. 氟化铈催化剂在乙烷与二氧化碳的氧化氢化反应中表现出高活性和选择性，通过异相催化作用，在953-993K的温度范围内贡献了75%-55%的C2H4形成。在氟化铈晶体网络中添加钙离子显著提高了乙烯的选择性和二氧化碳作为氧化剂的效率。

2. 在使用氟化铈催化剂进行CO2氧化脱氢（ODE）的上下文中，氟化铈充当了一个红氧催化剂，通过将催化剂还原为C2H6并随后由CO2氧化实现反应。整体反应结合了步骤（6）和（7）。

3. 合适的催化剂组成和反应条件允许在异相反应中获得超过90%的C2H4选择性。CO被确认为唯一非选择性产物，同时还有水生成。
