[The redox Ce+4/Ce+3 of CeO2 can be used for the activation of CO2 and to produce active oxygen species for the reaction.]
[In the presence of both catalysts, the conversion of ethene increases, but the most relevant feature is that the dissociation reaction of CO2 proceeds following the reaction equation (1), its conversion being equal or higher than that of ethane.]

4. Ceria catalysts are capable of converting CO2 into active oxygen species for the reaction.
5. The presence of calcium ions in the catalyst network increases the selectivity to ethene and improves CO2 utilization in the heterogeneous reaction.
6. The contribution of CO2 to the formation of C2H4 in the heterogeneous reaction was quantified as 75-55%.
7. The overall reaction is represented by Eq. (2), involving the reduction of ceria by ethane and the oxidation of CO2.
8. The selectivity towards olefin products can surpass 90% under optimal catalyst composition and conditions.
9. The shift in the CO2 desorption peak under increased CO2 partial pressure indicates the existence of a pool of chemisorbed CO2 on the catalyst surface.
