[1] "The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands."
[2] "The whole matter still waits for a full rationalization."
[3] "This goal still remains unaccomplished."
[4] "The only industrial exploitation of reaction (40) is still provided by the KolbeSchmitt synthesis of hydroxybenzoic acids."
