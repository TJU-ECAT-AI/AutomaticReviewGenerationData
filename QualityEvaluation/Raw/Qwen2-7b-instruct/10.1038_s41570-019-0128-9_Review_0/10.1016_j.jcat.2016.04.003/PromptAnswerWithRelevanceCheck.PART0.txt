<quotes>
[1] "The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (R = alkyl, aryl) bonds affords a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety (Eq. (27)) and has an industrial interest as it is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates based on the direct carboxylation of substrates such as alcohols, polyols and epoxides."
[2] "Also this process does not require, as a preliminary step, the coordination of CO2."
[3] "Trace amounts of amine can be fortu- itously present in solutions of M(NMe2)n compounds as a result of M(NMe2)n hydrolysis due to adventitious water. Under the working conditions (CO2 in excess relative to amine), the free amine can interact with the heterocumulene to produce carbamic acid R2- NCO2H, which reacts as shown in Eq. (30)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (alkyl, aryl) bonds leads to the formation of a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety, which is of industrial interest due to its use in synthesizing molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates through the direct carboxylation of substances like alcohols, polyols, and epoxides. This process does not necessitate an initial coordination of CO2.

2. In the presence of trace amounts of amine, which can be accidentally introduced into solutions of M(NMe2)n compounds due to their hydrolysis caused by incidental water, the free amine interacts with the heterocumulene under conditions where CO2 is in excess relative to amine. This interaction results in the formation of carbamic acid R2- NCO2H, which undergoes the reaction depicted in Eq. (30).

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. CO2与M-OR（烷基，芳基）基团反应会生成金属-烷基碳酸盐基团，这在工业上具有重要意义，因为它用于通过直接羧化醇、聚醇和环氧乙烷等物质合成分子有机碳酸盐和聚碳酸盐。此过程不需要对CO2进行预先配合。

2. 在存在少量胺的情况下，这些胺可以意外地出现在M(NMe2)n化合物的溶液中，由于它们在偶然水的存在下被水解。在CO2相对胺过量的条件下，自由胺与杂环化合物相互作用，形成R2- NCO2H的碳酰胺酸，然后按照方程（30）所示进行反应。

[1] "The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands."
[2] "The whole matter still waits for a full rationalization."
[3] "The formation of formic acid is more favorable in a condensed medium such as water (Eq. (33), DG = 4 kJ mol1), where the CO2/H2CO3/HCO3 equilibrium as well as the second deprotonation to CO3 2 must be taken into account,or if a base is used that produces formate salts instead of free formic acid, (Eq. (34), DG = 35 kJ mol1)."

[1] "Synthesis of formic acid The use of CO2 as synthon in chemical synthesis for manufactur- ing bulk or fine chemicals has been pursued since the 1980s."
[2] "An order of complexity higher would be represented by the integration of biotechnology and catalysis for an effective CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes, or even whole microorganisms, coupled to chemical technologies for energy supply to enzymes, using perennial sources as sun or wind or geothermal as primary energy."
[3] "The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance must be kept under strict control, with the concept of avoided CO2 winning on that of used CO2."
[4] "Indicators which may help to assess a CO2-based process are as follows:(a) the carbon utilization fraction (the percentage of reagent-C fixed into the products);(b) the carbon-footprint (the CO2 emission in the process per unit of product);(c) the energy consumption factor (ratio of the input- to output- energy);(d) the waste production factor (waste produced per unit of product, w/w);(e) the avoided to used ratio."
[5] "The basic coordination modes of CO2 to a single metal center are shown in Fig. 6 [53,54]."
[6] "Examples of bis(carbon dioxide) side-on complexes are also known, but only with molybdenum. An example is provided by trans-Mo(CO2)2HN(CH2CH2PMe2)2(PMe3) [56]."
[7] "The question rises whether coordinated carbon dioxide can undergo either electrophilic or nucleophilic attack."
[8] "The use of CO2 as a soft and selective oxidant has been demonstrated in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to afford styrene (Eq. (22)) [83]."
[9] "Detailed mechanistic studies have shown that it proceeds instead through carbon dioxide decoordination, dioxygen coordination to Ni, and CO2 insertion into the OAO bond of the newly formed, reactive (PCy3)2Ni(O2) complex [84]."
[10] "Often these reactions are initiated by nucleophilic attack of E (in MAE) at the electrophilic carbon of CO2 and assisted by weaker interactions between the metal center and the lone pairs of one of the O-atoms of the cumulene."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the synthesis of formic acid utilizing CO2 as a raw material. It mentions the complexity involved in the conversion of CO2 for carbon mitigation and the potential integration of biotechnology and catalysis for effective CO2 conversion, using enzymes or microorganisms. It also highlights the importance of indicators like carbon utilization fraction, carbon footprint, energy consumption, waste production, and avoided to used ratio in assessing CO2-based processes. The coordination modes of CO2 to metal centers are discussed, along with examples of bis(carbon dioxide) complexes. The possibility of CO2 undergoing electrophilic or nucleophilic attack is raised. Additionally, the utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene is mentioned. Mechanistic studies reveal that the formation of peroxocarbonate occurs via CO2 insertion into the OAO bond rather than the RhAO bond. Finally, the document notes that reactions involving CO2 often start with nucleophilic attack of the metal center on the carbon of CO2, assisted by interactions with the oxygen atoms of the cumulene.

文献讨论了使用CO2合成甲酸的方法。它提到了将CO2转化为碳减排的复杂性，并提到了生物技术和催化剂的有效结合，以及利用酶或微生物进行CO2转化的可能性。还强调了在评估基于CO2的过程时，碳利用率分数、碳足迹、能量消耗、废物产生和避免与使用比例的重要性。讨论了CO2与金属中心的配合模式，以及双碳氧化物复合物的例子。提出CO2可能经历亲电或亲核攻击的可能性。此外，文献提到CO2作为软氧化剂在乙苯脱氢制备苯乙烯中的应用。机制研究显示，形成过氧碳酸盐是通过CO2插入到新形成的反应性(PCy3)2Ni(O2)化合物的OAO键中，而不是RhAO键。最后，文献指出，涉及CO2的反应通常以金属中心对CO2碳的亲核攻击开始，由氧原子的相互作用辅助。

<p>CO2 coordination to metal centers represent by far the most common bonding mode of CO2. In [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2], the NiAC and NiAO1 bond distances are, respectively, 1.84 and 1.99 Å, showing that both carbon and one of the oxygen atoms are bound to the nickel center, which exhibits a planar coordination.</p>
<p>The complex [(IPr)Ni]2(l-CO)(l2-g2,g2-CO2) documents an interesting case of a l2-g2,g2-coordination, in which each C@O bond of the bridging CO2 ligand is, respectively, side-on coordinated to a Ni atom.</p>
<p>In principle, side-on adducts may be considered as three-membered oxametallacycles resulting from a formal oxidative addition of one of the p-bonds of the CO2 ligand to the metal center or as p-complexes, wherein the metalCO2 interaction involves both electron donation from the O-centered 1puy(5a1) and 1pgy(4b2) orbitals of CO2 to empty d-orbitals of M and, at a greater extent, electron back-donation from a filled d-orbital of metal to the empty C-centered 2puy(6a1) orbital of the ligand.</p>
<p>The role of O-sink may be played by the metal atom itself, or with less oxophilic metals (late transition metals, for instance) by CO2 itself with conversion of two CO2 molecules into CO and O2.</p>
