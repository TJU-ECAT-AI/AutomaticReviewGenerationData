[1] "Synthesis of formic acid The use of CO2 as synthon in chemical synthesis for manufactur- ing bulk or fine chemicals has been pursued since the 1980s."
[2] "Any a priori attempt to foresee the behavior of reactive systems is a pure guess."
[3] "Whether or not the coordination of CO2 is a prerequisite for further reaction depends on the kind of reaction CO2 has to undergo."
[4] "For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation at O)."
[5] "In other cases, CO2 pre-coordination to metal centers may not be necessary."

1. The use of CO2 as a building block in the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals has been explored since the 1980s.
2. Predicting the behavior of reactive systems before conducting experiments is speculative.
3. The requirement for CO2 coordination varies depending on the reaction CO2 needs to undergo.
4. Coordination to a metal center is essential for the reduction of CO2 to CO through O-transfer or protonation at O.
5. CO2 coordination to metal centers might not be necessary in certain reactions.

1. 自1980年代以来，人们一直在探索使用CO2作为构建块合成大宗和精细化学品。
2. 在进行实验之前预测反应体系的行为是推测性的。
3. CO2需要进行的反应类型决定了其协调是否为必要条件。
4. 通过O转移或在O上质子化将CO2还原成CO时，金属中心的配合是必需的。
5. 在某些反应中，CO2对金属中心的配合可能不是必要的。
