[1] "Synthesis of formic acid The use of CO2 as synthon in chemical synthesis for manufactur- ing bulk or fine chemicals has been pursued since the 1980s."
[2] "An order of complexity higher would be represented by the integration of biotechnology and catalysis for an effective CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes, or even whole microorganisms, coupled to chemical technologies for energy supply to enzymes, using perennial sources as sun or wind or geothermal as primary energy."
[3] "The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance must be kept under strict control, with the concept of avoided CO2 winning on that of used CO2."
[4] "Indicators which may help to assess a CO2-based process are as follows:(a) the carbon utilization fraction (the percentage of reagent-C fixed into the products);(b) the carbon-footprint (the CO2 emission in the process per unit of product);(c) the energy consumption factor (ratio of the input- to output- energy);(d) the waste production factor (waste produced per unit of product, w/w);(e) the avoided to used ratio."
[5] "The basic coordination modes of CO2 to a single metal center are shown in Fig. 6 [53,54]."
[6] "Examples of bis(carbon dioxide) side-on complexes are also known, but only with molybdenum. An example is provided by trans-Mo(CO2)2HN(CH2CH2PMe2)2(PMe3) [56]."
[7] "The question rises whether coordinated carbon dioxide can undergo either electrophilic or nucleophilic attack."
[8] "The use of CO2 as a soft and selective oxidant has been demonstrated in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to afford styrene (Eq. (22)) [83]."
[9] "Detailed mechanistic studies have shown that it proceeds instead through carbon dioxide decoordination, dioxygen coordination to Ni, and CO2 insertion into the OAO bond of the newly formed, reactive (PCy3)2Ni(O2) complex [84]."
[10] "Often these reactions are initiated by nucleophilic attack of E (in MAE) at the electrophilic carbon of CO2 and assisted by weaker interactions between the metal center and the lone pairs of one of the O-atoms of the cumulene."

The document discusses the synthesis of formic acid utilizing CO2 as a raw material. It mentions the complexity involved in the conversion of CO2 for carbon mitigation and the potential integration of biotechnology and catalysis for effective CO2 conversion, using enzymes or microorganisms. It also highlights the importance of indicators like carbon utilization fraction, carbon footprint, energy consumption, waste production, and avoided to used ratio in assessing CO2-based processes. The coordination modes of CO2 to metal centers are discussed, along with examples of bis(carbon dioxide) complexes. The possibility of CO2 undergoing electrophilic or nucleophilic attack is raised. Additionally, the utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene is mentioned. Mechanistic studies reveal that the formation of peroxocarbonate occurs via CO2 insertion into the OAO bond rather than the RhAO bond. Finally, the document notes that reactions involving CO2 often start with nucleophilic attack of the metal center on the carbon of CO2, assisted by interactions with the oxygen atoms of the cumulene.

文献讨论了使用CO2合成甲酸的方法。它提到了将CO2转化为碳减排的复杂性，并提到了生物技术和催化剂的有效结合，以及利用酶或微生物进行CO2转化的可能性。还强调了在评估基于CO2的过程时，碳利用率分数、碳足迹、能量消耗、废物产生和避免与使用比例的重要性。讨论了CO2与金属中心的配合模式，以及双碳氧化物复合物的例子。提出CO2可能经历亲电或亲核攻击的可能性。此外，文献提到CO2作为软氧化剂在乙苯脱氢制备苯乙烯中的应用。机制研究显示，形成过氧碳酸盐是通过CO2插入到新形成的反应性(PCy3)2Ni(O2)化合物的OAO键中，而不是RhAO键。最后，文献指出，涉及CO2的反应通常以金属中心对CO2碳的亲核攻击开始，由氧原子的相互作用辅助。
