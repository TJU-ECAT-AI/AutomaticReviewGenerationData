[1] "The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands."
[2] "The nature of the reaction medium may also play a key role in influencing the mechanistic pathway."
[3] "Overcoming the above kinetic and thermodynamic barriers requires the use of a shuttle."
[4] "The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2 catalyzed by transition metal systems has much been investigated in the last twenty years."
[5] "Under the latter conditions the actual substrate is HCO3 or CO3 2 rather than CO2."
[6] "The whole matter still waits for a full rationalization."
[7] "A question may come to the mind of the reader: can CO2 be co-polymerized with olefins to afford polyesters?"

1. The insertion mode in CO2 reactions is influenced by the charge separation in the MAE bond, which can be significantly impacted by the metal's properties and the surrounding ligands.
2. The reaction medium can significantly affect the mechanistic pathway of CO2 reactions.
3. To overcome kinetic and thermodynamic barriers in CO2 synthesis, a shuttle is often necessary.
4. Direct synthesis of formic acid from CO2 and H2 has been extensively studied over the past two decades.
5. Under certain conditions, the substrate in CO2 reactions can be HCO3 or CO3 2 instead of CO2.
6. There is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of CO2 reactions.
7. The reader might wonder if CO2 can be copolymerized with olefins to produce polyesters.
