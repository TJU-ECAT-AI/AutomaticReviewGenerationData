[1] "Various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance are the balance between activity and selectivity, catalyst stability, and the efficiency of CO2 conversion."
