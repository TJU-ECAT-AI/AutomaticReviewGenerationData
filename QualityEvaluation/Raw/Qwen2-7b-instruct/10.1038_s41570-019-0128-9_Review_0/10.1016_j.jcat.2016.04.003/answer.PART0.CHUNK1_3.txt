This section discusses the catalytic processes for CO2 conversion into chemicals and fuels, focusing on the distinct contributions of chemical catalysis and biotechnology. The literature covers a wide range of topics, including the insertion of CO2 into metal-bound bonds, oxidative coupling of CO2 with organic substrates, and the incorporation of CO2 into C-H bonds. It also delves into the synthesis of carboxylic acids, esters, lactones, and other functionalized compounds through direct CO2 incorporation. The document highlights the importance of these processes in developing more sustainable and efficient chemical synthesis routes, particularly in the context of CO2 utilization and the production of valuable chemicals. The text emphasizes the need for further research to optimize catalytic processes, improve selectivity, and enhance the environmental sustainability of CO2 conversion technologies.
