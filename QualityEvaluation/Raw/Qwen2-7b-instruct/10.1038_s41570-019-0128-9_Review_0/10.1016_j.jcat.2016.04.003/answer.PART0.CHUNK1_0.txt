[1] "The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (R = alkyl, aryl) bonds affords a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety (Eq. (27)) and has an industrial interest as it is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates based on the direct carboxylation of substrates such as alcohols, polyols and epoxides."
[2] "Also this process does not require, as a preliminary step, the coordination of CO2."
[3] "Trace amounts of amine can be fortu- itously present in solutions of M(NMe2)n compounds as a result of M(NMe2)n hydrolysis due to adventitious water. Under the working conditions (CO2 in excess relative to amine), the free amine can interact with the heterocumulene to produce carbamic acid R2- NCO2H, which reacts as shown in Eq. (30)."

1. The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (alkyl, aryl) bonds leads to the formation of a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety, which is of industrial interest due to its use in synthesizing molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates through the direct carboxylation of substances like alcohols, polyols, and epoxides. This process does not necessitate an initial coordination of CO2.

2. In the presence of trace amounts of amine, which can be accidentally introduced into solutions of M(NMe2)n compounds due to their hydrolysis caused by incidental water, the free amine interacts with the heterocumulene under conditions where CO2 is in excess relative to amine. This interaction results in the formation of carbamic acid R2- NCO2H, which undergoes the reaction depicted in Eq. (30).

1. CO2与M-OR（烷基，芳基）基团反应会生成金属-烷基碳酸盐基团，这在工业上具有重要意义，因为它用于通过直接羧化醇、聚醇和环氧乙烷等物质合成分子有机碳酸盐和聚碳酸盐。此过程不需要对CO2进行预先配合。

2. 在存在少量胺的情况下，这些胺可以意外地出现在M(NMe2)n化合物的溶液中，由于它们在偶然水的存在下被水解。在CO2相对胺过量的条件下，自由胺与杂环化合物相互作用，形成R2- NCO2H的碳酰胺酸，然后按照方程（30）所示进行反应。

[1] "The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands."
[2] "The whole matter still waits for a full rationalization."
[3] "The formation of formic acid is more favorable in a condensed medium such as water (Eq. (33), DG = 4 kJ mol1), where the CO2/H2CO3/HCO3 equilibrium as well as the second deprotonation to CO3 2 must be taken into account,or if a base is used that produces formate salts instead of free formic acid, (Eq. (34), DG = 35 kJ mol1)."

1. The observed insertion mode is determined by the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which can be significantly influenced by the characteristics of the metal and the auxiliary ligands.

2. The entire matter still awaits a comprehensive explanation.

3. The formation of formic acid is more favorable in a condensed medium such as water, considering the equilibrium of CO2/H2CO3/HCO3 and the second deprotonation to CO3 2, or if a base is utilized that forms formate salts instead of free formic acid.

1. 观察到的插入模式取决于MAE键（E = H，C）中的电荷分离，这可能由金属本身的特性和辅助配体的性质显著影响。

2. 整个问题仍然等待一个全面的解释。

3. 形成甲酸在如水这样的凝聚介质中更有利于考虑CO2/H2CO3/HCO3的平衡以及第二次脱质子化到CO3 2，或者如果使用形成甲酸盐而不是自由甲酸的碱。
