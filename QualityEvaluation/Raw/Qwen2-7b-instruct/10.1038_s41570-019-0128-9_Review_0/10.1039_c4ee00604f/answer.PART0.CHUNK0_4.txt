[1] "The reforming of methane to syngas (CO + H2) is the most important industrial process that utilizes methane in large scale industrial applications at present."
[2] "This process is widely used to produce syngas for methanol synthesis, and hydrogen for ammonia synthesis and refining processes."
[3] "About 48% of the hydrogen in the world is produced by steam reforming."
[4] "However, hot spots in the catalyst bed and high temperature reaction conditions cause difficulties in the operation, and excess steam is needed to suppress the formation of coke."
[5] "In contrast, CO2 reforming consumes two greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) to make the valuable syngas. This reaction not only mitigates CO2 and CH4 emission but also provides an effective way to utilize low grade natural gas resources consisting of CH4 and CO2, e.g., coal bed gas."
[6] "The TCD process offers a convenient way to maximize the production of hydrogen gas from the methane molecule, and many forms of value-added carbon products add importance to this process."
[7] "The rate of methane decomposition activity on the transition metals follows the order: Co, Ru, Ni, Rh > Pt, Re, Ir > Pd, Cu, W, Fe, Mo."
[8] "A different kinetics behavior was observed with carbon materials as compared with that of metal catalysts, illustrating the catalytic effect of carbon in the TCD reaction."
[9] "First, using solar energy to split water to hydrogen and oxygen is still far from the practical applications. Secondly, the electrolysis of water to high-quality hydrogen, although well established, also needs more energy than the TCD process."
[10] "Therefore, as methane has the highest H/C ratio in fossil fuel, we propose that the TCD process would play a more and more important role in the production of hydrogen in the future."

The reforming of methane to syngas (CO + H2) is a critical industrial process for producing syngas used in methanol synthesis and hydrogen for ammonia synthesis and refining processes. About 48% of the hydrogen globally is produced through steam reforming. Steam reforming often encounters operational difficulties due to hot spots in the catalyst bed and high temperatures, necessitating the use of excess steam to prevent the formation of coke. In contrast, CO2 reforming is an environmentally friendly process that converts two greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) into valuable syngas, effectively reducing CO2 emissions and providing an efficient way to utilize low-grade natural gas resources, such as coal bed gas. The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane offers a straightforward method to maximize hydrogen production, with many forms of value-added carbon products enhancing its significance. Transition metals display a specific order of methane decomposition activity, with cobalt, ruthenium, nickel, rhodium showing higher activity than palladium, copper, tungsten, iron, molybdenum. Carbon materials exhibit distinct kinetics compared to metal catalysts in the TCD reaction, indicating the catalytic role of carbon. Splitting water to produce hydrogen using solar energy is still impractical, while electrolysis requires more energy than the TCD process. Given methane's high H/C ratio, the TCD process is expected to play an increasingly important role in hydrogen production in the future.

甲烷重整到合成气（CO + H2）是当前大规模工业应用中最重要的工业过程，用于生产用于甲醇合成和氢气的合成气，以及氨合成和精炼过程。全球约48%的氢气通过蒸汽重整生产。蒸汽重整常因催化剂床热点和高温导致操作困难，需要使用过量蒸汽来防止焦炭形成。相比之下，二氧化碳重整是一个环境友好的过程，能将两种温室气体（CO2和CH4）转化为有价值的合成气，有效减少CO2排放，并提供利用低品位天然气资源（如煤层气）的有效途径。热催化分解（TCD）甲烷提供了一种简单的方法来最大化氢气的产生，许多形式的附加值碳产品增强了其重要性。过渡金属在甲烷分解活性方面显示出特定的顺序，其中钴、钌、镍、铑比钯、铜、钨、铁、钼更活跃。碳材料在TCD反应中与金属催化剂表现出不同的动力学特性，表明碳的催化作用。使用太阳能将水裂解成氢气仍不切实际，而电解则需要比TCD过程更多的能量。鉴于甲烷的高H/C比例，预计TCD过程在未来氢气生产中将发挥越来越重要的作用。
