The TCD process enables the decomposition of methane into hydrogen and solid carbon with high selectivity. Without a catalyst, the reaction requires more than 1500 K to achieve a reasonable yield. Transition metals, particularly cobalt (Co), ruthenium (Ru), nickel (Ni), and rhodium (Rh), exhibit higher methane decomposition activity compared to other metals such as palladium (Pd), copper (Cu), tungsten (W), iron (Fe), and molybdenum (Mo). The presence of surface defects on the Li/MgO catalyst facilitates methane activation by creating oxygen sites, which are essential for the reaction mechanism. This process allows for the efficient production of hydrogen gas from methane molecules, and the formation of various carbon products adds significant value to the process. Although the TCD process is not currently widely used industrially, its potential for hydrogen production, especially in scenarios requiring high-quality hydrogen, suggests its growing importance as the demand for hydrogen increases.

TCD过程使甲烷分解为氢气和固体碳，具有高度的选择性。在没有催化剂的情况下，反应需要超过1500 K才能达到合理的产率。特别是钴（Co）、钌（Ru）、镍（Ni）和钯（Rh），这些过渡金属在甲烷分解活性方面表现出更高的性能，相比于其他金属如钯（Pd）、铜（Cu）、钨（W）、铁（Fe）和钼（Mo）。Li/MgO催化剂表面缺陷的存在有助于激活甲烷，通过形成氧位点，这是反应机制的关键。这个过程允许从甲烷分子高效生产氢气，并且形成各种碳产品为该过程增添了巨大的价值。尽管TCD过程目前在工业上尚未广泛应用，但其作为高纯度氢气生产潜力的增长，尤其是在需求增加的情况下，表明了其日益重要的地位。
