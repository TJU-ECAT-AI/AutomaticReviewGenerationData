The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-based catalysts was explored. It was found that the activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts increased with the increase in CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts was significantly decreased by the addition of even a small amount of CO2. The kinetic analysis revealed that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 hindered the adsorption of propane, thereby reducing the activity of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. XAFS spectra and TPR profiles showed that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a crucial role in both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts during propane dehydrogenation. Additionally, CO2 was capable of oxidizing some of the Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions, leading to the occurrence of oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species alongside the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species on the Cr/SiO2 catalyst.

在铬基催化剂上，二氧化碳在丙烷脱氢反应中的作用进行了研究。发现，随着二氧化碳分压的增加，Cr/SiO2催化剂的活性增强，而Cr/Al2O3催化剂活性显著降低。动力学分析显示，二氧化碳吸附在Al2O3上阻碍了丙烷的吸附，从而降低了Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性。XAFS谱和TPR图谱表明，Cr(III)O6与Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂上的丙烷脱氢过程中起着关键作用，无论支持材料如何。此外，在反应条件下，二氧化碳能够氧化某些Cr(III)物种到Cr(VI)物种，导致Cr/SiO2催化剂上发生氧化脱氢反应，同时伴随着Cr(III)物种的简单脱氢反应。
