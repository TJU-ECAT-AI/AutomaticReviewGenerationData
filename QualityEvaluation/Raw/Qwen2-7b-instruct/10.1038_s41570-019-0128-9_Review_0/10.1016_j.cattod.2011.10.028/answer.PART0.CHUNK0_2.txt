The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2.
Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3.
Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support.
CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition.
In the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

The study investigated the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) on the dehydrogenation of propane over chromium-based catalysts supported on silica (Cr/SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Cr/Al2O3). The activity of Cr/SiO2 increased with the increase in CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was significantly reduced by adding a small amount of CO2. This suggests that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibits the adsorption of propane (C3H8) and reduces the activity of Cr/Al2O3. The redox cycle between chromium(III) oxide (Cr(III)O6) and chromium(VI) oxide (Cr(VI)O4) plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propene (C3H6) over both types of catalysts, regardless of the support. Under certain reaction conditions, CO2 can oxidize some chromium(III) species to chromium(VI) species. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs over chromium(VI) species in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over chromium(III) species.

研究探讨了二氧化碳（CO2）对丙烷在铬基催化剂（以硅为基础的Cr/SiO2和以铝为基础的Cr/Al2O3）上的脱氢作用。随着CO2分压的增加，Cr/SiO2的活性增强，而Cr/Al2O3的活性则显著降低。这表明CO2吸附在Al2O3上抑制了丙烷（C3H8）的吸附，并降低了Cr/Al2O3的活性。铬（III）氧化物（Cr(III)O6）与铬（VI）氧化物（Cr(VI)O4）之间的氧化还原循环在丙烯（C3H6）在两种催化剂上的脱氢反应中起着关键作用，无论支持材料为何种。在特定的反应条件下，CO2可以将一些铬（III）物种氧化为铬（VI）物种。因此，在Cr/SiO2的情况下，丙烷的氧化脱氢发生在铬（VI）物种上，除了在铬（III）物种上的简单脱氢外。
