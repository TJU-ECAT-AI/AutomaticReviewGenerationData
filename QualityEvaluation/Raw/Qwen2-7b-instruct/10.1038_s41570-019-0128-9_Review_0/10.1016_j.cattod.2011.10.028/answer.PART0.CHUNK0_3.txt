[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."
[2] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."
[3] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."
[4] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition."

The effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-based catalysts was studied. When the partial pressure of CO2 increased, the activity of the Cr/SiO2 catalyst improved, whereas the activity of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst significantly decreased upon adding a small amount of CO2. This suggests that CO2 inhibits the adsorption of propane on Al2O3 and reduces the activity of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. The redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process over both types of catalysts, regardless of the support material. Under reaction conditions, CO2 can oxidize some Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species.

对铬基催化剂在二氧化碳下丙烷脱氢的影响进行了研究。当二氧化碳的分压增加时，Cr/SiO2催化剂的活性提高，而向Cr/Al2O3催化剂添加少量二氧化碳会导致其活性显著降低。这表明二氧化碳抑制了Al2O3上丙烷的吸附并降低了Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性。无论支持材料如何，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在两种催化剂上对丙烯脱氢过程起着关键作用。在反应条件下，二氧化碳可以将部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。
