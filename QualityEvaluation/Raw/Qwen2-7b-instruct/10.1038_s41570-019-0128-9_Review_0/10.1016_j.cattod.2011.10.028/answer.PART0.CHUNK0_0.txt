"The activity of  Cr/SiO2 was  enhanced with  increasing the partial pressure of  CO2,  while  the activity of  Cr/Al2O3 was  remarkably reduced by  the  addition of  a  small amount of
CO2.  Kinetic
analysis suggested that  CO2 adsorbed on  Al2O3 inhibited the  adsorption of  C3H8,  and  that CO2 reduced the  activity of  Cr/Al2O3."
"Cr  K-edge XAFS  spectra and  TPR  profiles indicated that the  redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and  Cr(VI)O4 had  an  important role  in  the dehydrogenation of  C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of  the  support."
"CO2 could  oxidize a  part  of Cr(III) species to  Cr(VI)  species under the  reaction condition."
"As  a result,  in  the  case  of Cr/SiO2,  the oxidative dehydrogenation of  C3H8 over  Cr(VI) species took  place in  addition to  the  simple dehydrogenation over  Cr(III) species."

Various support materials, including SiO2 and Al2O3, significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Increasing the partial pressure of CO2 enhances the activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts, whereas it remarkably reduces the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. The presence of CO2 inhibits the adsorption of propane on Al2O3, and CO2 oxidizes a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions, leading to oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species in addition to simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species. This study indicates that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 plays an essential role in the dehydrogenation process over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support material. The use of CO2 as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation reactions offers the potential to improve efficiency and product selectivity compared to traditional methods using oxygen as an oxidant.

Challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include selecting the appropriate support material that balances activity, selectivity, and stability while ensuring efficient CO2 utilization. The redox properties of chromium oxide species and their interaction with CO2 are critical factors affecting the reaction pathway and product distribution. Optimizing these interactions requires a deep understanding of the catalytic mechanisms and careful tuning of reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure and temperature.

各种支持材料，如SiO2和Al2O3，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中对铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机制产生显著影响。提高二氧化碳的分压可以增强Cr/SiO2催化剂的活性，而对Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性有显著的负面影响。二氧化碳在铝氧化物上吸附抑制了丙烷的吸附，并减少了Cr/Al2O3的活性。二氧化碳能够在反应条件下氧化部分Cr(III)物种为Cr(VI)物种，导致Cr/VI物种上的氧化脱氢反应发生，除了Cr(III)物种上的简单脱氢反应。研究表明，无论支持材料如何，Cr(III)O6与Cr(VI)O4之间的还原循环在丙烷的脱氢过程中起着重要作用。使用二氧化碳作为脱氢反应的共喂料气体，相较于传统方法使用氧气作为氧化剂，能够提高效率和产品选择性。

优化整体性能面临的挑战和权衡包括选择合适的支持材料，平衡活性、选择性和稳定性，同时确保有效地利用二氧化碳。铬氧化物物种的还原性质及其与二氧化碳的相互作用是影响反应路径和产物分布的关键因素。优化这些相互作用需要深入了解催化机制并精心调整反应条件，包括二氧化碳分压和温度。
