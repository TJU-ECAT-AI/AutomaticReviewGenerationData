The role of CO2 in dehydrogenation over Cr-based catalysts, specifically Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3, shows contrasting effects. The activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts increases with the rise in CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts significantly decreases upon adding even a small amount of CO2. This indicates that CO2 adsorbed on the Al2O3 surface inhibits the adsorption of propane (C3H8) and reduces the activity of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. The redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process over both types of catalysts, regardless of the support material. Notably, CO2 can oxidize part of the Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions, leading to additional oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species alongside the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species in the case of Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

二氧化碳在铬基催化剂，特别是Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3上的脱氢作用中表现出相反的影响。Cr/SiO2催化剂的活性随着CO2分压的增加而提高，而Cr/Al2O3催化剂在添加少量CO2后活性显著降低。这表明CO2吸附在Al2O3表面上抑制了丙烷（C3H8）的吸附并降低了Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性。Cr(III)O6与Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环对两种催化剂的脱氢过程起着关键作用，无论支持材料是什么。值得注意的是，在反应条件下，CO2可以将部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种，导致Cr/SiO2催化剂上除简单脱氢外还发生额外的氧化脱氢作用。
