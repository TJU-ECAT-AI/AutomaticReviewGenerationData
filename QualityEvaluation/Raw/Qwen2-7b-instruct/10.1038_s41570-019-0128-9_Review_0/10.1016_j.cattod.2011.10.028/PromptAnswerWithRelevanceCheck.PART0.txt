Various support materials, including SiO2 and Al2O3, significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Increasing the partial pressure of CO2 enhances the activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts, whereas it remarkably reduces the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. The presence of CO2 inhibits the adsorption of propane on Al2O3, and CO2 oxidizes a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions, leading to oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species in addition to simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species. This study indicates that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 plays an essential role in the dehydrogenation process over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support material. The use of CO2 as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation reactions offers the potential to improve efficiency and product selectivity compared to traditional methods using oxygen as an oxidant.

Challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include selecting the appropriate support material that balances activity, selectivity, and stability while ensuring efficient CO2 utilization. The redox properties of chromium oxide species and their interaction with CO2 are critical factors affecting the reaction pathway and product distribution. Optimizing these interactions requires a deep understanding of the catalytic mechanisms and careful tuning of reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure and temperature.

各种支持材料，如SiO2和Al2O3，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中对铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机制产生显著影响。提高二氧化碳的分压可以增强Cr/SiO2催化剂的活性，而对Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性有显著的负面影响。二氧化碳在铝氧化物上吸附抑制了丙烷的吸附，并减少了Cr/Al2O3的活性。二氧化碳能够在反应条件下氧化部分Cr(III)物种为Cr(VI)物种，导致Cr/VI物种上的氧化脱氢反应发生，除了Cr(III)物种上的简单脱氢反应。研究表明，无论支持材料如何，Cr(III)O6与Cr(VI)O4之间的还原循环在丙烷的脱氢过程中起着重要作用。使用二氧化碳作为脱氢反应的共喂料气体，相较于传统方法使用氧气作为氧化剂，能够提高效率和产品选择性。

优化整体性能面临的挑战和权衡包括选择合适的支持材料，平衡活性、选择性和稳定性，同时确保有效地利用二氧化碳。铬氧化物物种的还原性质及其与二氧化碳的相互作用是影响反应路径和产物分布的关键因素。优化这些相互作用需要深入了解催化机制并精心调整反应条件，包括二氧化碳分压和温度。

The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-based catalysts was explored. It was found that the activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts increased with the increase in CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts was significantly decreased by the addition of even a small amount of CO2. The kinetic analysis revealed that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 hindered the adsorption of propane, thereby reducing the activity of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. XAFS spectra and TPR profiles showed that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a crucial role in both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts during propane dehydrogenation. Additionally, CO2 was capable of oxidizing some of the Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions, leading to the occurrence of oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species alongside the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species on the Cr/SiO2 catalyst.

The study investigated the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) on the dehydrogenation of propane over chromium-based catalysts supported on silica (Cr/SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Cr/Al2O3). The activity of Cr/SiO2 increased with the increase in CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was significantly reduced by adding a small amount of CO2. This suggests that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibits the adsorption of propane (C3H8) and reduces the activity of Cr/Al2O3. The redox cycle between chromium(III) oxide (Cr(III)O6) and chromium(VI) oxide (Cr(VI)O4) plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propene (C3H6) over both types of catalysts, regardless of the support. Under certain reaction conditions, CO2 can oxidize some chromium(III) species to chromium(VI) species. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs over chromium(VI) species in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over chromium(III) species.

研究探讨了二氧化碳（CO2）对丙烷在铬基催化剂（以硅为基础的Cr/SiO2和以铝为基础的Cr/Al2O3）上的脱氢作用。随着CO2分压的增加，Cr/SiO2的活性增强，而Cr/Al2O3的活性则显著降低。这表明CO2吸附在Al2O3上抑制了丙烷（C3H8）的吸附，并降低了Cr/Al2O3的活性。铬（III）氧化物（Cr(III)O6）与铬（VI）氧化物（Cr(VI)O4）之间的氧化还原循环在丙烯（C3H6）在两种催化剂上的脱氢反应中起着关键作用，无论支持材料为何种。在特定的反应条件下，CO2可以将一些铬（III）物种氧化为铬（VI）物种。因此，在Cr/SiO2的情况下，丙烷的氧化脱氢发生在铬（VI）物种上，除了在铬（III）物种上的简单脱氢外。

对铬基催化剂在二氧化碳下丙烷脱氢的影响进行了研究。当二氧化碳的分压增加时，Cr/SiO2催化剂的活性提高，而向Cr/Al2O3催化剂添加少量二氧化碳会导致其活性显著降低。这表明二氧化碳抑制了Al2O3上丙烷的吸附并降低了Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性。无论支持材料如何，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在两种催化剂上对丙烯脱氢过程起着关键作用。在反应条件下，二氧化碳可以将部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。

The role of CO2 in dehydrogenation over Cr-based catalysts, specifically Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3, shows contrasting effects. The activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts increases with the rise in CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts significantly decreases upon adding even a small amount of CO2. This indicates that CO2 adsorbed on the Al2O3 surface inhibits the adsorption of propane (C3H8) and reduces the activity of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. The redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process over both types of catalysts, regardless of the support material. Notably, CO2 can oxidize part of the Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions, leading to additional oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species alongside the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species in the case of Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

二氧化碳在铬基催化剂，特别是Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3上的脱氢作用中表现出相反的影响。Cr/SiO2催化剂的活性随着CO2分压的增加而提高，而Cr/Al2O3催化剂在添加少量CO2后活性显著降低。这表明CO2吸附在Al2O3表面上抑制了丙烷（C3H8）的吸附并降低了Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性。Cr(III)O6与Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环对两种催化剂的脱氢过程起着关键作用，无论支持材料是什么。值得注意的是，在反应条件下，CO2可以将部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种，导致Cr/SiO2催化剂上除简单脱氢外还发生额外的氧化脱氢作用。
