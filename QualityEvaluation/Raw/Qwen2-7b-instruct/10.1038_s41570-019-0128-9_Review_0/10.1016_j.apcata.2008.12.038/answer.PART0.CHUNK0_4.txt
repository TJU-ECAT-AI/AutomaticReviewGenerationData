[1] "Dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide was investigated over various gallium-based catalysts."
[2] "Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts show better stability than b-Ga2O3, and the higher Si/Al ratio HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation."
[3] "The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst exhibits both high activity and stability for dehydrogenation of ethane, with an ethane conversion of 15% and ethylene selectivity of 94% without any observable trend of deactivation in 70 h."
[4] "As the Si/Al ratio increases, the initial activity of HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreases."
[5] "The catalytic stability is superior for the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 90."
[6] "Results of the dehydrogenation reaction with different partial pressures of CO2 indicate that there are two roles of CO2 existing in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water gas shift reaction, and a negative role by displacing ethane adsorbed on the basic sites of catalyst."
[7] "The stability is also improved greatly by the addition of CO2 due to the suppression of coke formation."

Various support materials and reaction conditions influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of gallium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Among the materials tested, H-ZSM-5 with a higher Si/Al ratio showed superior stability. The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst exhibited both high activity and stability for dehydrogenation of ethane, with an ethane conversion of 15% and ethylene selectivity of 94% without any observable trend of deactivation in 70 hours. As the Si/Al ratio of the support increases, the initial activity of the catalysts decreases, but the catalytic stability increases. CO2 plays dual roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: it removes absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which has a positive impact, while it displaces ethane adsorbed on the basic sites of the catalyst, having a negative impact. The stability is greatly improved by adding CO2 due to the suppression of coke formation, contributing to better performance of the catalysts.

各种支持材料和反应条件影响镓氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理路径。在测试的材料中，Si/Al比更高的H-ZSM-5显示出了更好的稳定性。Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97)催化剂表现出乙烷脱氢的高活性和稳定性，乙烷转化率为15%，乙烯选择性为94%，且在70小时内没有观察到活性趋势的下降。随着支持剂的Si/Al比的增加，催化剂的初始活性降低，但催化稳定性增加。二氧化碳在脱氢反应中扮演双重角色：通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，产生正面影响；同时它将催化剂上的基本位点吸附的乙烷置换掉，产生负面影响。通过添加二氧化碳，稳定性得到了极大的改善，原因是抑制了焦炭的形成，对催化剂的整体性能起到了积极的作用。
