[1] "Dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide was investigated over various gallium-based catalysts. Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts show better stability than b-Ga2O3, and the higher Si/Al ratio HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation."
[2] "As the Si/Al ratio increases, the initial activity of HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreases. The catalytic stability is superior for the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 90."
[3] "Results of the dehydrogenation reaction with different partial pressures of CO2 indicate that there are two roles of CO2 existing in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water gas shift reaction, and a negative role by displacing ethane adsorbed on the basic sites of catalyst."
[4] "The stability is also improved greatly by the addition of CO2 due to the suppression of coke formation."

The various support materials, particularly H-ZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of gallium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to decreased initial activity but improved stability. The introduction of CO2 enhances activity by facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, which removes absorbed H2 from the catalyst surface. However, CO2 also negatively impacts the reaction by displacing ethane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. The stability of the catalysts is significantly improved by the addition of CO2 due to the suppression of coke formation, which is beneficial for long-term operation.

各种支持材料，特别是不同Si/Al比例的H-ZSM-5，对镓氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理产生影响。较高的Si/Al比例导致初始活性降低但稳定性提高。二氧化碳通过反向水煤气变换反应增强活性，从而去除催化剂表面吸附的H2。然而，二氧化碳也通过置换催化剂上基本位点上的乙烷，对反应产生负面影响。通过添加二氧化碳，催化剂的稳定性显著提高，这是由于抑制焦炭形成，对长期操作有益。
