<p>The initial ethane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, showing that the acidities of the supported gallium oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity.</p>
<p>As listed in Table 3, 40.9% of methane and 15.3% of aromatics are formed due to the side reaction such as cracking, cyclization and oligomerization.</p>
<p>However, the stability of b-Ga2O3 is rather poor and the activity drops dramatically to one-tenth within 5 h.</p>
<p>Compared with these catalysts, Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) is more stable after the initial period, and the ethylene yield over this catalyst maintains about 14% without any observable trend of deactivation.</p>
<p>The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction can be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction, which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CO2 has a negative effect on the reaction by displacement of the ethane adsorbed on the catalyst surface.</p>
<p>The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst was deactivated rapidly within only 1 h in the absence of CO2, but when 3% of CO2 was introduced, only about 20% of the initial activity was lost over the same catalyst within 10 h.</p>
<p>It can also be seen that the stability of the catalysts was greatly improved after the addition of CO2.</p>

The support materials and reaction conditions significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to a decrease in initial activity but improve stability over time. Side reactions like cracking, cyclization, and oligomerization affect selectivity. Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit better stability and performance when CO2 is present, particularly in reducing coke formation and enhancing the stability of the catalysts. The reverse water gas shift reaction contributes positively by facilitating the formation of dehydrogenation products, while CO2 displacement negatively impacts ethane conversion by competing for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，不同支持材料和反应条件对铬氧化催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理产生了显著影响。较高的Si/Al比导致初始活性降低，但随着时间的推移提高了稳定性。副反应如裂解、环化和聚合物化影响选择性。含碳氧化铬催化剂在CO2存在下表现出更好的稳定性和性能，尤其是通过减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂表面产物的脱附，从而增强稳定性。反向水煤气变换反应对促进脱氢产物的形成有积极作用，而CO2置换则负面影响乙烷转化，因为它竞争催化剂表面的吸附位点。
