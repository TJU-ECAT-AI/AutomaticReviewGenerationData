<p>Dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 was investigated over gallium oxide catalysts supported on HZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios. A highly active and stable catalyst Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) is obtained, with an ethane conversion of 15% and ethylene selectivity of 94% without any observable trend of deactivation in 70 h, which is much better than the b-Ga2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>As the Si/Al ratio increases, the initial activity of HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreases. The catalytic stability is superior for the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 90.</p>
<p>The enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support is caused by the decrease of the acidity of the catalysts, which is revealed by NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine.</p>
<p>Results of the dehydrogenation reaction with different partial pressures of CO2 indicate that there are two roles of CO2 existing in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water gas shift reaction, and a negative role by displacing ethane adsorbed on the basic sites of catalyst. The stability is also improved greatly by the addition of CO2 due to the suppression of coke formation.</p>

The study investigates the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 over gallium oxide catalysts supported on HZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios. A catalyst named Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) is found to be highly active and stable, achieving an ethane conversion of 15% and ethylene selectivity of 94% over 70 hours without deactivation. This performance surpasses that of the b-Ga2O3 catalyst. As the Si/Al ratio of the support increases, the initial activity of the catalysts decreases, but the stability improves significantly for catalysts with a Si/Al ratio greater than 90. The stability enhancement is attributed to a decrease in catalyst acidity, as evidenced by NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra. The CO2 in the reaction plays dual roles: positively by removing absorbed H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction, and negatively by displacing ethane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. The addition of CO2 also improves stability by suppressing coke formation on the catalyst surface.

研究考察了在不同Si/Al比的HZSM-5支持的镓氧化物催化剂上，乙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下脱氢为乙烯的情况。一种命名为Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97)的催化剂被发现具有高度的活性和稳定性，在70小时内，乙烷转化率为15%，乙烯选择性达到94%，且没有出现活性下降的趋势，这一表现优于b-Ga2O3催化剂。随着支持材料的Si/Al比的增加，催化剂的初始活性降低，但对于Si/Al比大于90的催化剂，其稳定性显著提高。催化剂稳定性的增强归因于催化剂酸性的减少，这一点通过NH3-TPD和吸附吡啶的FT-IR光谱得到证实。二氧化碳在反应中的作用是双面的：正面作用是通过逆向水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，负面影响是将吸附在催化剂碱性位点上的乙烷置换出来。增加二氧化碳的浓度能显著改善稳定性，这得益于抑制了催化剂表面焦炭的形成。
