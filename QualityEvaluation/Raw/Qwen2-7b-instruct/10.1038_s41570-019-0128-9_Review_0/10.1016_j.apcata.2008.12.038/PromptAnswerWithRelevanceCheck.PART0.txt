[1] "Dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide was investigated over various gallium-based catalysts. Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts show better stability than b-Ga2O3, and the higher Si/Al ratio HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation."
[2] "As the Si/Al ratio increases, the initial activity of HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreases. The catalytic stability is superior for the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 90."
[3] "Results of the dehydrogenation reaction with different partial pressures of CO2 indicate that there are two roles of CO2 existing in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water gas shift reaction, and a negative role by displacing ethane adsorbed on the basic sites of catalyst."
[4] "The stability is also improved greatly by the addition of CO2 due to the suppression of coke formation."

The various support materials, particularly H-ZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of gallium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to decreased initial activity but improved stability. The introduction of CO2 enhances activity by facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, which removes absorbed H2 from the catalyst surface. However, CO2 also negatively impacts the reaction by displacing ethane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. The stability of the catalysts is significantly improved by the addition of CO2 due to the suppression of coke formation, which is beneficial for long-term operation.

各种支持材料，特别是不同Si/Al比例的H-ZSM-5，对镓氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理产生影响。较高的Si/Al比例导致初始活性降低但稳定性提高。二氧化碳通过反向水煤气变换反应增强活性，从而去除催化剂表面吸附的H2。然而，二氧化碳也通过置换催化剂上基本位点上的乙烷，对反应产生负面影响。通过添加二氧化碳，催化剂的稳定性显著提高，这是由于抑制焦炭形成，对长期操作有益。

<quotes>
<p>The initial ethane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, showing that the acidities of the supported gallium oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity.</p>
<p>As listed in Table 3, 40.9% of methane and 15.3% of aromatics are formed due to the side reaction such as cracking, cyclization and oligomerization.</p>
<p>However, the stability of b-Ga2O3 is rather poor and the activity drops dramatically to one-tenth within 5 h.</p>
<p>Compared with these catalysts, Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) is more stable after the initial period, and the ethylene yield over this catalyst maintains about 14% without any observable trend of deactivation.</p>
<p>The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction can be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction, which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CO2 has a negative effect on the reaction by displacement of the ethane adsorbed on the catalyst surface.</p>
<p>The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst was deactivated rapidly within only 1 h in the absence of CO2, but when 3% of CO2 was introduced, only about 20% of the initial activity was lost over the same catalyst within 10 h.</p>
<p>It can also be seen that the stability of the catalysts was greatly improved after the addition of CO2.</p>

The support materials and reaction conditions significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to a decrease in initial activity but improve stability over time. Side reactions like cracking, cyclization, and oligomerization affect selectivity. Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit better stability and performance when CO2 is present, particularly in reducing coke formation and enhancing the stability of the catalysts. The reverse water gas shift reaction contributes positively by facilitating the formation of dehydrogenation products, while CO2 displacement negatively impacts ethane conversion by competing for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，不同支持材料和反应条件对铬氧化催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理产生了显著影响。较高的Si/Al比导致初始活性降低，但随着时间的推移提高了稳定性。副反应如裂解、环化和聚合物化影响选择性。含碳氧化铬催化剂在CO2存在下表现出更好的稳定性和性能，尤其是通过减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂表面产物的脱附，从而增强稳定性。反向水煤气变换反应对促进脱氢产物的形成有积极作用，而CO2置换则负面影响乙烷转化，因为它竞争催化剂表面的吸附位点。

1. Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. H-ZSM-5 with higher Si/Al ratios shows better stability and resistance to deactivation. The initial activity of catalysts decreases with higher Si/Al ratios. The addition of CO2 improves stability by suppressing coke formation and promoting the desorption of ethylene from the catalyst surface.

2. The reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, play a crucial role in influencing the performance of chromium oxide catalysts. CO2 has a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water gas shift reaction, enhancing activity. However, it also has a negative role by displacing ethane adsorbed on the basic sites of the catalyst, reducing activity. The stability is improved by the addition of CO2, attributed to the suppression of coke formation.

3. Challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions include finding the optimal balance between activity and stability, dealing with the negative effects of CO2 on the reaction, and managing the complex mechanistic pathways involved. The key is to understand how different support materials and reaction conditions affect the catalyst's performance and adjust them accordingly to achieve the best results.

4. The key findings suggest that H-ZSM-5 supports with higher Si/Al ratios and the strategic addition of CO2 can enhance the stability and performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. These insights can guide the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction conditions for industrial applications.

1. 不同的支撑材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中对铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径产生影响。具有较高Si/Al比的H-ZSM-5表现出更好的稳定性和抗失活能力。随着Si/Al比的增加，催化剂的初始活性降低。高Si/Al比的H-ZSM-5支持的催化剂稳定性更优。二氧化碳的添加极大地提高了稳定性，归因于抑制焦炭形成并促进乙烷从催化剂表面的脱附。

2. 反应条件，特别是二氧化碳分压，对铬氧化物催化剂的性能有重要影响。二氧化碳通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，增强活性，起到积极作用。然而，它也通过置换催化剂上的碱性位点上的乙烷，降低活性，起到消极作用。二氧化碳的添加改善了稳定性，归因于抑制焦炭形成。 

3. 在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中优化铬氧化物催化剂的整体性能面临的主要挑战和权衡包括在活性与稳定性的平衡上找到最佳点，应对二氧化碳对反应的负面影响，以及管理涉及的复杂机制途径。关键在于理解不同支撑材料和反应条件如何影响催化剂的性能，并据此调整以获得最佳结果。

4. 主要发现表明，具有较高Si/Al比的H-ZSM-5支持和策略性添加二氧化碳可以增强铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的稳定性和性能。这些见解可以指导开发更高效的催化剂和反应条件，用于工业应用。

The study investigates the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 over gallium oxide catalysts supported on HZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios. A catalyst named Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) is found to be highly active and stable, achieving an ethane conversion of 15% and ethylene selectivity of 94% over 70 hours without deactivation. This performance surpasses that of the b-Ga2O3 catalyst. As the Si/Al ratio of the support increases, the initial activity of the catalysts decreases, but the stability improves significantly for catalysts with a Si/Al ratio greater than 90. The stability enhancement is attributed to a decrease in catalyst acidity, as evidenced by NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra. The CO2 in the reaction plays dual roles: positively by removing absorbed H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction, and negatively by displacing ethane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. The addition of CO2 also improves stability by suppressing coke formation on the catalyst surface.

研究考察了在不同Si/Al比的HZSM-5支持的镓氧化物催化剂上，乙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下脱氢为乙烯的情况。一种命名为Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97)的催化剂被发现具有高度的活性和稳定性，在70小时内，乙烷转化率为15%，乙烯选择性达到94%，且没有出现活性下降的趋势，这一表现优于b-Ga2O3催化剂。随着支持材料的Si/Al比的增加，催化剂的初始活性降低，但对于Si/Al比大于90的催化剂，其稳定性显著提高。催化剂稳定性的增强归因于催化剂酸性的减少，这一点通过NH3-TPD和吸附吡啶的FT-IR光谱得到证实。二氧化碳在反应中的作用是双面的：正面作用是通过逆向水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，负面影响是将吸附在催化剂碱性位点上的乙烷置换出来。增加二氧化碳的浓度能显著改善稳定性，这得益于抑制了催化剂表面焦炭的形成。
