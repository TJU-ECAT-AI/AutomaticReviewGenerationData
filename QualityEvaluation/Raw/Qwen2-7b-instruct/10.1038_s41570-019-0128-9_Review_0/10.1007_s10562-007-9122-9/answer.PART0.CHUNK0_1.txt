The maximal formation rate of C2H4 was 0.264 mmol · min1 · (g · cat.)1 (48.0% C2H6 conversion, 92.2% C2H4 selectivity, 44.3% C2H4 yield) on 7 wt% CoBaCO3 catalyst at 650 C and 6000 ml · (g · cat)1 · h1.
It was found that Co4+O species were active sites on these catalysts in ODE with CO2.
The redox cycle of CoO species played an important role on the catalytic performance of CoBaCO3 catalysts.
On the other hand, the co-operation of BaCO3 and BaCoO3 was considered to be one of possible reasons for the high catalytic activity of these catalysts.

This study highlights the utilization of cobalt-bicarbonate catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using carbon dioxide as the oxidant. The researchers achieved a maximal formation rate of ethylene (C2H4) at 0.264 mmol per minute per gram of catalyst (cat.), corresponding to a conversion rate of 48.0% of ethane (C2H6) and a selectivity of 92.2% for ethylene. This outcome demonstrates the high efficiency of the catalysts under the tested conditions. The active sites on the catalysts were identified as cobalt(IV)-oxygen species, which play a crucial role in the catalytic process. The redox cycle of cobalt(III)-oxygen species contributes significantly to the performance of the cobalt-bicarbonate catalysts. Moreover, the synergy between barium carbonate (BaCO3) and barium cobaltate (BaCoO3) is proposed as a factor that enhances the catalytic activity of these materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. This study provides valuable insights into the design of efficient catalysts for the production of ethylene through the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

本研究利用钴碳酸盐催化剂，采用二氧化碳作为氧化剂进行乙烷的氧化脱氢反应。研究人员在650°C和每克催化剂每小时6000毫升的条件下，实现了最大乙烯（C2H4）生成速率，达到0.264毫摩尔每分钟每克催化剂（cat.），对应的乙烷（C2H6）转化率为48.0%，乙烯选择性为92.2%。这表明在测试条件下催化剂的高效性。催化剂上的活性位点被确定为钴(IV)-氧物种，其在催化过程中起着关键作用。钴(III)-氧物种的还原-氧化循环对钴碳酸盐催化剂的性能有重要影响。此外，巴氏碳酸盐（BaCO3）与巴氏钴酸盐（BaCoO3）之间的协同作用被认为是这些材料在二氧化碳作为氧化剂的乙烷氧化脱氢反应中高催化活性的原因之一。本研究提供了设计用于使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂生产乙烯的高效催化剂的宝贵见解。
