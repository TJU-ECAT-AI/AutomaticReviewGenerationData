This study highlights the utilization of cobalt-bicarbonate catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using carbon dioxide as the oxidant. The researchers achieved a maximal formation rate of ethylene (C2H4) at 0.264 mmol per minute per gram of catalyst (cat.), corresponding to a conversion rate of 48.0% of ethane (C2H6) and a selectivity of 92.2% for ethylene. This outcome demonstrates the high efficiency of the catalysts under the tested conditions. The active sites on the catalysts were identified as cobalt(IV)-oxygen species, which play a crucial role in the catalytic process. The redox cycle of cobalt(III)-oxygen species contributes significantly to the performance of the cobalt-bicarbonate catalysts. Moreover, the synergy between barium carbonate (BaCO3) and barium cobaltate (BaCoO3) is proposed as a factor that enhances the catalytic activity of these materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. This study provides valuable insights into the design of efficient catalysts for the production of ethylene through the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, can significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature highlights that the CoBaCO3 catalyst system exhibits high catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using CO2 as an oxidant. The maximal formation rate of ethene reached 0.264 mmol · min1 · (g · cat.)1 with 48.0% ethane conversion, 92.2% ethene selectivity, and 44.3% ethene yield at 7 wt% CoBaCO3 catalyst loading, 650°C, and 6000 ml · (g · cat)1 · h1. To improve catalytic reactivity, the development of novel catalysts or modifications of existing ones is crucial. The redox cycle of CoO species is a significant factor affecting the catalytic performance of CoBaCO3 catalysts. Moreover, the cooperative action of BaCO3 and BaCoO3 is proposed as a potential reason for the high catalytic activity of these catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance involve balancing activity, selectivity, and stability, while considering factors such as catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and CO2 partial pressure. The literature suggests that by carefully tuning these parameters, it may be possible to overcome these challenges and achieve optimized performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
