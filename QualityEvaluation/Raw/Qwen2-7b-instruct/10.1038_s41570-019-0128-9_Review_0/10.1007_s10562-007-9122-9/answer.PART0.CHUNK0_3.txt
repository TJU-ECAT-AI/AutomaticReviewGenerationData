Various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, can significantly impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature highlights that the CoBaCO3 catalyst system exhibits high catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using CO2 as an oxidant. The maximal formation rate of ethene reached 0.264 mmol · min1 · (g · cat.)1 with 48.0% ethane conversion, 92.2% ethene selectivity, and 44.3% ethene yield at 7 wt% CoBaCO3 catalyst loading, 650°C, and 6000 ml · (g · cat)1 · h1. To improve catalytic reactivity, the development of novel catalysts or modifications of existing ones is crucial. The redox cycle of CoO species is a significant factor affecting the catalytic performance of CoBaCO3 catalysts. Moreover, the cooperative action of BaCO3 and BaCoO3 is proposed as a potential reason for the high catalytic activity of these catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance involve balancing activity, selectivity, and stability, while considering factors such as catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and CO2 partial pressure. The literature suggests that by carefully tuning these parameters, it may be possible to overcome these challenges and achieve optimized performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

各种支持材料，如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2以及反应条件，包括CO2分压，对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和动力学路径有显著影响。文献表明，CoBaCO3催化剂系统在使用CO2作为氧化剂的乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出高催化性能。当在7 wt% CoBaCO3催化剂负载下，650°C和6000 ml · (g · cat)1 · h1时，最大乙烯生成速率达到0.264 mmol · min1 · (g · cat.)1，乙烷转化率为48.0%，乙烯选择性为92.2%，乙烯产率为44.3%。为了提高催化活性，开发新型催化剂或对现有催化剂进行改性是至关重要的。CoO物种的还原-氧化循环在CoBaCO3催化剂的催化性能中起着重要作用。此外，BaCO3和BaCoO3的协同作用被提出是这些催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中高催化活性的一个可能原因。

优化整体性能的关键挑战和权衡涉及平衡活性、选择性和稳定性，同时考虑催化剂负载、反应温度和CO2分压等因素。文献表明，通过仔细调整这些参数，有可能克服这些挑战，并实现CO2氧化脱氢反应的优化性能。
