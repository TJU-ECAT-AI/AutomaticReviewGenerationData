The document discusses the application of CoBaCO3 catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) using CO2 as the oxidant. These catalysts exhibit high catalytic performance, with the maximal formation rate of C2H4 reaching 0.264 mmol · min1 · (g · cat.)1 at 650°C and 6000 ml · (g · cat)1 · h1, achieving 48.0% C2H6 conversion, 92.2% C2H4 selectivity, and 44.3% C2H4 yield. The redox cycle of CoO species on these catalysts is crucial for their catalytic activity, and the co-operation of BaCO3 and BaCoO3 is suggested as a reason for their high activity.

本文讨论了在CO2作为氧化剂的条件下，使用CoBaCO3催化剂进行乙烷的氧化脱氢（ODE）的应用。这些催化剂表现出很高的催化性能，在650°C和6000 ml · (g · cat)1 · h1的条件下，最大C2H4生成速率达到0.264 mmol · min1 · (g · cat.)1，实现了48.0%的C2H6转化率、92.2%的C2H4选择性和44.3%的C2H4产率。CoO物种的还原氧化循环对于这些催化剂的催化活性至关重要，并且BaCO3与BaCoO3的协同作用被认为是它们高活性的一个可能原因。
