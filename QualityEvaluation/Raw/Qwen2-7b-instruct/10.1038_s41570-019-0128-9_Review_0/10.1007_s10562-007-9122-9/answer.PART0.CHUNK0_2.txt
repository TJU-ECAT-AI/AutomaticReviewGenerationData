The CoBaCO3 catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) using CO2 as an oxidant. The highest formation rate of ethene (C2H4) reached 0.264 mmol · min<sup>-1</sup> · (g · cat.<sup>-1</sup>) (with 48.0% conversion of ethane, 92.2% selectivity of ethene, and 44.3% yield of ethene) on a 7 wt% CoBaCO3 catalyst at 650°C and 6000 ml · (g · cat)<sup>-1</sup> · h<sup>-1</sup>. Active sites on these catalysts were identified as Co4+O species, which participated in the redox cycle during the reaction. The cooperative effect of BaCO3 and BaCoO3 was proposed as a significant factor contributing to the high catalytic activity of the CoBaCO3 catalysts in ODE with CO2.

CoBaCO3催化剂在使用CO2作为氧化剂的乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出优异性能。在650°C和6000 ml · (g · cat)<sup>-1</sup> · h<sup>-1</sup>条件下，7 wt% CoBaCO3催化剂上最大形成率的乙烯（C2H4）达到0.264 mmol · min<sup>-1</sup> · (g · cat.<sup>-1</sup>)（乙烷转化率为48.0%，乙烯选择性为92.2%，乙烯产率为44.3%）。这些催化剂上的活性位点被确认为Co4+O物种，它们参与了反应过程中的氧化还原循环。BaCO3与BaCoO3的协同作用被认为是提高CoBaCO3催化剂在CO2参与下乙烷氧化脱氢反应活性的关键因素之一。
