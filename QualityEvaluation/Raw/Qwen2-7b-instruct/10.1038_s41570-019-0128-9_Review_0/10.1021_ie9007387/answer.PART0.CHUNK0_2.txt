Various support materials, including SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, can influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Reaction conditions, such as CO2 partial pressure, also play a crucial role. The study focused on FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by two different methods: coprecipitation and coprecipitationimpregnation. The catalyst prepared by the coprecipitationimpregnation method showed higher catalytic stability, higher CO2 conversion, and lower ethylene selectivity compared to the coprecipitation method. Coke deposition was identified as the primary reason for catalyst deactivation. The dehydrogenation of ethane is activated by Cr3+ species, and Fe3O4 is formed during the reaction, which can promote the reverse WGS reaction. Thermal degradation and transformation of an active phase were excluded as factors leading to catalyst deactivation. TEM results revealed coke deposition on the catalyst surfaces, particularly on the FeCr/ZrO2(C) catalyst. To assess the coke content, thermogravimetric analyses were conducted in an oxidant atmosphere.

各种支持材料，包括SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，可以影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理路径。反应条件，如CO2分压，也起着关键作用。研究重点是FeCr/ZrO2催化剂，通过两种不同的方法制备：共沉淀和共沉淀浸渍。由共沉淀浸渍法制备的催化剂表现出更高的催化稳定性、更高的CO2转化率和更低的乙烷选择性，与共沉淀法制备的催化剂相比。焦炭沉积被确定为催化剂失活的主要原因。乙烷的脱氢由Cr3+物种激活，并且在反应过程中形成Fe3O4，这可以促进逆向水煤气变换反应。排除了热降解和活性相的转变作为导致催化剂失活的因素。透射电子显微镜结果揭示了催化剂表面的焦炭沉积，特别是在FeCr/ZrO2(C)催化剂上。为了评估焦炭含量，在氧化气氛下进行了热重分析。
