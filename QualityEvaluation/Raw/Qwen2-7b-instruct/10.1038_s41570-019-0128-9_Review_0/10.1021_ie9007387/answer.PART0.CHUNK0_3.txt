[1] "In the research described here, two different methods - coprecipitation and coprecipitation impregnation - were adopted to prepare FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts for the comparison."
[2] "The catalytic tests show that FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by coprecipitation impregnation have higher catalytic stability, higher CO2 conversion, and lower ethylene selectivity in comparison to FeCr/ZrO2 prepared by coprecipitation."
[3] "Thermogravimetric analysis and physicochemical characterization such as XPS, XRD, and BET were performed to explore the correlation of catalytic performance with physicochemical properties of the catalysts."
[4] "Catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed flow type quartz reactor packed with 0.2 g of the catalyst and 1 g of quartz sand at atmospheric pressure."
[5] "After reaction, the reactor was cooled with pure Ar until it cooled to room temperature. The used catalysts were taken out from the reactor and placed in sealed sample bags, which were stored in a desiccator before characterization."
[6] "XRD patterns of FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) catalysts before and after reaction are presented in Figure 3. Only tetragonal ZrO2 diffraction peaks can be observed on their XRD spectra."
[7] "On the basis of the above analysis, it may be concluded that for the ODE to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant over FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts, Cr3+ species take the role of the dehydrogenation of ethane and Fe promotes the CO2 hydrogenation (reverse WGS reaction) through the redox cycle of Fe3+ and Fe2+."
[8] "The relatively high coke deposition on FeCr/ZrO2 (C) catalyst gives an explanation for its dramatic decrease in the production of ethylene over the time on stream."

The study compared FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared using two methods: coprecipitation and coprecipitation impregnation. The catalyst prepared through coprecipitation impregnation showed higher catalytic stability, higher CO2 conversion, and lower ethylene selectivity compared to the one prepared via coprecipitation. Thermogravimetric analysis and physicochemical characterization techniques were utilized to understand the correlation between the catalyst's properties and its performance. The catalytic tests were conducted in a fixed-bed flow type reactor. After the reaction, the catalysts were cooled and characterized. The XRD analysis revealed only tetragonal ZrO2 diffraction peaks in the catalysts' spectra. The researchers concluded that Cr3+ species act as the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation, while Fe promotes CO2 hydrogenation (reverse WGS reaction) through the redox cycle of Fe3+ and Fe2+. The high coke deposition on the FeCr/ZrO2 catalyst prepared via coprecipitation contributed to its significant decrease in ethylene production over time.

在研究中，采用了两种方法制备了FeCr/ZrO2催化剂：共沉淀和共沉淀浸渍。通过共沉淀浸渍制备的催化剂表现出更高的催化稳定性、更高的CO2转化率和更低的乙烯选择性，与通过共沉淀制备的催化剂相比。进行了热重分析和物理化学表征技术（如XPS、XRD和BET）来探索催化剂性能与其物理化学性质之间的关系。催化测试在固定床流化床型石英反应器中进行，该反应器装有0.2克催化剂和1克石英砂，在大气压下。反应后，将反应器冷却至室温，并用纯氩气冷却，直到温度降至室温。然后从反应器中取出催化剂并放入密封的样品袋中，存放在干燥器中进行表征。XRD图谱显示催化剂的XRD谱只有四方晶系ZrO2衍射峰。研究人员得出结论，Cr3+物种在乙烷脱氢作用中起着关键作用，而Fe通过Fe3+和Fe2+的氧化还原循环促进了CO2氢化（逆水煤气变换反应）。共沉淀制备的FeCr/ZrO2催化剂上的高焦炭沉积解释了其在反应时间过程中乙烯产量的显著下降。
