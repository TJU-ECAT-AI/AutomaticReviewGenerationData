The catalytic performance of FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts, prepared by two different methods - coprecipitation and coprecipitationimpregnation - were examined in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant. Thermogravimetric analysis and physicochemical characterization such as XPS, XRD, and BET were performed to explore the correlation of catalytic performance with physicochemical properties of the catalysts.
Catalytic tests show that FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by coprecipitationimpregnation have higher catalytic stability, higher CO2 conversion, and lower ethylene selectivity in comparison to FeCr/ZrO2 prepared by coprecipitation.
Characterization results indicate that the dehydrogenation of ethane is activated by Cr3+ species and Fe3O4 is formed during the reaction, which can promote the reverse WGS reaction.
Coke deposition is the main reason of the deactivation of the catalysts.
A possible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of these results.

The study compared the catalytic performance of FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by coprecipitation and coprecipitationimpregnation methods in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant. The coprecipitationimpregnation method led to catalysts with higher stability, CO2 conversion, and lower ethylene selectivity compared to the coprecipitation method. The characterization results suggested that Cr3+ species activate the dehydrogenation of ethane and Fe3O4 is formed during the reaction, promoting the reverse water gas shift (WGS) reaction. Coke deposition was identified as the main cause of catalyst deactivation. A proposed reaction mechanism explains the process based on these findings.

研究比较了通过沉淀和沉淀浸渍两种方法制备的FeCr/ZrO2催化剂在使用CO2作为氧化剂的乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。与沉淀法相比，沉淀浸渍法制得的催化剂具有更高的稳定性、CO2转化率和更低的乙烯选择性。表征结果表明，Cr3+物种激活了乙烷的脱氢反应，并且在反应过程中形成了Fe3O4，促进了逆向水煤气变换（WGS）反应。焦炭沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因。基于这些发现提出了一种可能的反应机制。
