FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by different methods have been examined in ODE to ethylene in the presence of CO2. The catalyst prepared by the coprecipitationimpregnation method exhibits stable catalytic performance during the time on stream. In contrast, there is obvious deactivation (ethylene yield and ethane conversion) for the catalyst prepared by the coprecipitation method, which can be attributed to coke deposition during the reaction. The catalyst prepared by the coprecipiation method gives higher ethylene selectivity and lower CO2 conversion. The high ethylene selectivity could be explained by its larger amount of oxygen vacancies (OIII). Less adsorbed CO2 (OII) on the catalyst may cause its low CO2 conversion. The characterization results indicate that Cr3+ species are the active sites for the dehydrogenation of ethane and Fe2O3 is reduced to Fe3O4 during the reaction, which may enhance the reverse WGS reaction.

The study compares FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared using two different methods: coprecipitation and coprecipitationimpregnation. The catalyst prepared through coprecipitationimpregnation demonstrates superior stability and efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2, as evidenced by its higher CO2 conversion and lower ethylene selectivity compared to the coprecipitated catalyst. The enhanced stability of the impregnated catalyst is attributed to reduced coke deposition. The coprecipitated catalyst, on the contrary, shows significant deactivation due to coke formation, leading to decreased ethylene yield and ethane conversion. The high ethylene selectivity of the impregnated catalyst is explained by its greater content of oxygen vacancies, which affects CO2 conversion. The characterization results suggest that Cr3+ species act as the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation, and Fe2O3 is reduced to Fe3O4 during the reaction, potentially enhancing the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

在氧化脱氢反应中，不同方法制备的FeCr/ZrO2催化剂进行了研究。通过浸渍共沉淀法制备的催化剂在流通过程中的稳定性表现良好。相比之下，通过共沉淀法制备的催化剂显示出明显的活性下降，表现为乙烯产率和乙烷转化率降低，这可以归因于反应过程中焦炭沉积。浸渍共沉淀法制备的催化剂具有更高的乙烯选择性和较低的CO2转化率。其高乙烯选择性的原因在于催化剂中含有更多的氧空位，从而影响CO2转化。表征结果表明，Cr3+物种是乙烷脱氢的活性位点，并且Fe2O3在反应过程中被还原为Fe3O4，可能促进了逆水煤气变换反应。

The catalytic performance of FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts, prepared by two different methods - coprecipitation and coprecipitationimpregnation - were examined in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant. Thermogravimetric analysis and physicochemical characterization such as XPS, XRD, and BET were performed to explore the correlation of catalytic performance with physicochemical properties of the catalysts.
Catalytic tests show that FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by coprecipitationimpregnation have higher catalytic stability, higher CO2 conversion, and lower ethylene selectivity in comparison to FeCr/ZrO2 prepared by coprecipitation.
Characterization results indicate that the dehydrogenation of ethane is activated by Cr3+ species and Fe3O4 is formed during the reaction, which can promote the reverse WGS reaction.
Coke deposition is the main reason of the deactivation of the catalysts.
A possible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of these results.

Various support materials, including SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, can influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Reaction conditions, such as CO2 partial pressure, also play a crucial role. The study focused on FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by two different methods: coprecipitation and coprecipitationimpregnation. The catalyst prepared by the coprecipitationimpregnation method showed higher catalytic stability, higher CO2 conversion, and lower ethylene selectivity compared to the coprecipitation method. Coke deposition was identified as the primary reason for catalyst deactivation. The dehydrogenation of ethane is activated by Cr3+ species, and Fe3O4 is formed during the reaction, which can promote the reverse WGS reaction. Thermal degradation and transformation of an active phase were excluded as factors leading to catalyst deactivation. TEM results revealed coke deposition on the catalyst surfaces, particularly on the FeCr/ZrO2(C) catalyst. To assess the coke content, thermogravimetric analyses were conducted in an oxidant atmosphere.

The catalyst prepared through coprecipitation impregnation showed higher catalytic stability, higher CO2 conversion, and lower ethylene selectivity compared to the one prepared via coprecipitation. Thermogravimetric analysis and physicochemical characterization techniques were utilized to understand the correlation between the catalyst's properties and its performance. The catalytic tests were conducted in a fixed-bed flow type reactor. After the reaction, the catalysts were cooled and characterized. The XRD analysis revealed only tetragonal ZrO2 diffraction peaks in the catalysts' spectra. The researchers concluded that Cr3+ species act as the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation, while Fe promotes CO2 hydrogenation (reverse WGS reaction) through the redox cycle of Fe3+ and Fe2+. The high coke deposition on the FeCr/ZrO2 catalyst prepared via coprecipitation contributed to its significant decrease in ethylene production over time.
