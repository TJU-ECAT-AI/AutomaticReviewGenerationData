Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method.
Physico-chemical properties including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties of the supported In2O3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, respectively.
It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3.
Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH.

The study investigates the effect of In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with different In2O3 loadings (low: 3 wt%, high: 10 wt%) on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions in the presence of CO2. The physico-chemical properties, such as surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic characteristics of the supported In2O3, were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption techniques. The research highlights that a greater proportion of highly dispersed In2O3 species on the support material is advantageous for propylene production. The highest propylene yield was observed with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. For optimal performance in PDH, it is crucial to achieve a balance between high In2O3 dispersion and a balanced acidic/basic property, which facilitates synergies between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift reactions.

该研究探讨了不同In2O3负载（低：3 wt%，高：10 wt%）的In2O3/MOx（M=Al，Zr，Si）催化剂在CO2存在的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的影响。使用X射线衍射、X射线光电子能谱、H2温度程序还原、NH3和CO2温度程序脱附等技术分析了支撑In2O3的物理化学性质，如表面组成、氧化还原性和酸碱性。研究表明，在支持材料上存在更多特定高度分散的In2O3物种有利于丙烯生产。最高丙烯产率在高载量的In2O3/Al2O3催化剂中实现。为了实现PDH的高效性能，必须平衡高In2O3分散性和酸碱性质之间的平衡，这促进了脱氢和逆水煤气变换反应的协同作用。
