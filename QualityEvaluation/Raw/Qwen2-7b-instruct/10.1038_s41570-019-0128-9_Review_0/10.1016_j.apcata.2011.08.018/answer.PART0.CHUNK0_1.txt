<p>However,significant loss of propylene selectivity due to deep oxidation to carbon oxides is inevitably accompanied,existing as the main drawback of this process.</p>
<p>To circumvent this problem,carbon dioxide (CO2),one of the most important greenhouse gases,has been proposed to be a promising candidate as milder oxidant replacing oxygen in activation of light alkanes,including coupling of methane,dehydration (DH) of ethylbenzene,iso-propylbenzene,propane,or iso-butane [8].</p>
<p>In the DH reaction, CO2 is also expected to serve as a medium for supplying heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction,as a diluent for enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and as an agent for the removal of coke formed on the catalyst [9].</p>
<p>On the other hand,contrarily to what is traditionally believed, CO2 is not inert in the oxidation reaction.</p>
<p>Oxygen species produced by its dissociation can modify the oxidation state of the surface atoms of the catalysts and can directly participate in the oxidation of the hydrocarbon [10,11].</p>
<p>Furthermore, taking into account the environmental concerns, CO2, one of the major greenhouse gases, accounts for the fast global warming tendency in the past decades.</p>
<p>In this context, CO2 recycling by the PDH technique,not only produces useful chemicals but also helps alleviate environmental pressure for excessive burning of fossil fuels, seemingly attractive from both economic and ecological perspectives [12].</p>
<p>For the Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts, the proposed one-step pathway is followed, in agreement with the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism [13,14].</p>
<p>The Ga2O3-based catalysts is proposed to obey a two-step pathway mechanism, which is a simple dehydrogenation step coupled with a subsequent reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [15,16].</p>
<p>However, fast deactivation presents as a common problem troubling all the above-mentioned catalyst systems, ascribed to either exhaustion of active lattice oxygen atoms or coke deposition.</p>
<p>Along this line, we have recently demonstrated that In2O3Al2O3 nanocomposite synthesized via alcoholic coprecipitation was highly active and stable as a new catalyst in the PDH with CO2 [17,18].</p>
<p>An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials, where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system.</p>
<p>In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important roles in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst [1].</p>
<p>It is also suggested that acid-base properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene [2].</p>
<p>Hence, it is necessary to gain further insight into the support effect for the In-based catalysts.</p>
<p>To this end, in the present study, the support effect for In-based catalysts has been studied, and Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 were selected as three supports, taking into account their differentiated surface properties in terms of affinity to In2O3 and relative acid/base strength.</p>
<p>For each support, both low and high In-loading samples were synthesized.</p>
<p>Details of the correlation of characterization results and PDH activities performed reveal the abundance of highly dispersed indium species and acid-base properties are two key parameters that determine the high PDH performance for the In-based catalysts.</p>

This literature discusses the influence of various support materials and reaction conditions on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature mentions that CO2 can be a promising candidate for replacing oxygen in activation processes of light alkanes. CO2 is expected to provide heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, enhance equilibrium conversion of light alkanes, and aid in removing coke formed on the catalyst. Contrary to traditional beliefs, CO2 is not inert in oxidation reactions, as oxygen species produced by its dissociation can modify the oxidation state of surface atoms and directly participate in hydrocarbon oxidation. Environmental concerns regarding CO2 contribute to its importance in recycling through the PDH technique, which not only produces useful chemicals but also alleviates environmental pressure from excessive fossil fuel burning. Challenges in catalyst optimization include deactivation due to exhaustion of active lattice oxygen or coke deposition. The literature highlights the use of In2O3Al2O3 nanocomposites as an active and stable catalyst in CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation, emphasizing the importance of a well-balanced active phase composition. Additionally, the choice of support material plays a crucial role in tuning the dispersion and electronic properties of active species, affecting the overall catalytic performance. Acid-base properties of supports are also noted to impact propylene selectivity. The study focuses on investigating the support effect for indium-based catalysts, selecting Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 as supports with differing surface properties, and synthesizing samples with both low and high indium loadings. The correlation between characterization results and PDH activities indicates that the abundance of highly dispersed indium species and acid-base properties are key factors determining high PDH performance for indium-based catalysts.

本文讨论了各种支持材料和反应条件对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径的影响。文献提到，二氧化碳可以作为替代氧气激活轻烷烃的有前景的候选者。二氧化碳预期为热力学上吸热的脱氢反应提供热量，增强轻烷烃的平衡转化，并帮助去除催化剂上的焦炭。与传统观点相反，二氧化碳在氧化反应中并非惰性，由其分解产生的氧物种可以修改表面原子的氧化状态，并直接参与烃类的氧化。考虑到环境问题，二氧化碳作为主要温室气体之一，导致过去几十年全球变暖趋势加快。在此背景下，通过PDH技术回收二氧化碳不仅产生有用化学品，而且有助于缓解过度燃烧化石燃料带来的环境压力，从经济和生态角度来看具有吸引力。催化剂优化面临的挑战包括由于活性晶格氧耗尽或焦炭沉积导致的快速失活。文献强调了使用In2O3Al2O3纳米复合材料作为二氧化碳介导的丙烷脱氢的活性和稳定的催化剂，在In2O3Al2O3系统中的重要性，强调了活性相组成平衡的重要性。此外，支持材料的选择在调节分散活性物种的分布和电子性质方面发挥着关键作用，影响给定催化剂的整体催化性能。文献指出酸碱性质的支持物对丙烯选择性有显著影响。研究重点在于调查基于铟的催化剂的支撑效果，选择了Al2O3、ZrO2和SiO2作为具有不同表面特性的支持物，合成低负载和高负载的样品。通过表征结果和PDH活动的相关性表明，高度分散的铟物种的丰度和酸碱性质是决定基于铟的催化剂高PDH性能的关键因素。
