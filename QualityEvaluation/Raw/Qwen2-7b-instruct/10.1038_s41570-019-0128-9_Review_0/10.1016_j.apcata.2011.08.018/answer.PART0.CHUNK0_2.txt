[1] "To this end,in the present study,the support effect for In-based catalysts has been studied,and Al2O3, ZrO2 and SiO2 were selected as three supports,taking into account their differentiated surface properties in terms of affinity to In2O3 and relative acid/base strength."
[2] "Detailed correlation of characterization results and PDH activities performed reveals the abundance of highly dispersed indium-species and acidbase properties are two key parameters that determine the high PDH performance for the In-based catalysts."

The study investigates the impact of various support materials (Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2) on indium-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, considering their distinct surface properties related to affinity for In2O3 and relative acidity/basicity. The high dispersion of indium species and the balance of acidic/basic properties are identified as crucial factors determining the superior PDH performance of these catalysts.
