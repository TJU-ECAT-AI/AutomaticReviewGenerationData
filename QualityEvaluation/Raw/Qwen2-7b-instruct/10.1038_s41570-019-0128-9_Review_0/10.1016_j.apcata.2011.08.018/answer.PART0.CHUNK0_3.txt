[1] "Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method."
[2] "It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3."
[3] "Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH."
[4] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst."

In the study, binary In2O3/MOx catalysts with different In2O3 loadings were synthesized using the incipient wetness impregnation method. The researchers found that a higher population of highly dispersed In2O3 species on the support promoted propylene production. Among these, the highest propylene yield was observed with the In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst featuring a high In2O3 loading. For optimal catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), it is crucial to achieve a balance between high In2O3 dispersion and suitable acidic/basic properties, which facilitate synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift reactions. The choice of the support material significantly influences the dispersion and electronic properties of the active species, thereby impacting the overall catalytic performance.

在研究中，制备了不同In2O3负载量的二元In2O3/MOx催化剂，使用浸渍湿法。研究人员发现，支持物上高度分散的特定In2O3物种的更高数量有利于丙烯生成。其中，最高丙烯产率是在高In2O3负载的In2O3/Al2O3催化剂中观察到的。为了实现PDH的高效催化性能，必须实现In2O3高分散性和适宜的酸碱性之间的平衡，这促进脱氢与逆水煤气变换反应的协同作用。支持材料的选择显著影响活性物种的分散性和电子性质，从而影响整体催化性能。
