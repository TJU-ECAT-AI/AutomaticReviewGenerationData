[1] "A new method determining the specific rate with no information about the number of active sites was applied to the reverse-Boudourad reaction over supported Ni catalysts."
[2] "It was found that the catalyst support hardly affected the specific rate."
[3] "The activity pattern and activation energies agreed well with those obtained by a conventional method using TG, suggesting the validity of the new method for studying the kinetics."
[4] "Very little difference was observed from one catalyst to another, which indicates that the catalyst support hardly influences the gasification rate."
[5] "The activation energy was calculated as 41.8 kJ mol1."
[6] "Yamada et al. studied the catalytic activity of physically mixed Ni compounds such as NiO, Ni3CO3(OH)44H2O, Ni(NO3)26H2O, NiC2O42H2O,and Ni(CH3CO2)24H2O for the CO2 gasification of phenol-formaldehyde resin char [13]."
[7] "Concerning factors influencing the rate of carbon gasification, following two are considered: (i) the degree of contact between the catalyst and carbon, and (ii) the chemical nature of a catalyst and/or a catalyst support."

The reverse-Boudouard reaction over supported Ni catalysts showed that the catalyst support had a minimal impact on the specific rate. The activity pattern and activation energies were consistent with traditional methods, validating the new rate determination approach. Catalyst support did not significantly affect the gasification rate, and the activation energy was found to be 41.8 kJ mol1. The study by Yamada et al. on the catalytic activity of Ni compounds for CO2 gasification of phenol-formaldehyde resin char indicated the importance of the reducibility of nickel salts, suggesting metallic nickel as the active site for carbon gasification. Factors affecting the rate of carbon gasification include the contact between the catalyst and carbon, as well as the chemical nature of the catalyst and its support.
