[1] "The activity pattern and activation energies agreed well with those obtained by a conventional method using TG, suggesting the validity of the new method for studying the kinetics."
[2] "Very little difference was observed from one catalyst to another, which indicates that the catalyst support hardly influences the gasification rate."
[3] "The activation energy was calculated as 41.8 kJ mol−1."
[4] "No significant difference was observed in the gasification rate among the different oxide supports."

1. The new method determining the specific rate constant showed good agreement with traditional methods using thermogravimetry (TG), indicating its validity for studying kinetics.
2. The catalyst support had a minimal impact on the gasification rate, suggesting that it hardly affects the reaction.
3. The calculated activation energy for the carbon-CO2 reaction over supported Ni catalysts was 41.8 kJ mol−1.
4. There was no significant difference in the gasification rate observed among various oxide supports used as catalyst supports.
