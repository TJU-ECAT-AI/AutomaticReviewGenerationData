It was found that the catalyst support hardly affected the specific rate.
The activity pattern and activation energies agreed well with those obtained by a conventional method using TG, suggesting the validity of the new method for studying the kinetics.
Very little difference was observed from one catalyst to another, which indicates that the catalyst support hardly influences the gasification rate.
This might be due to the relatively weak interaction between CO2 and Ni on TiO2.
The agreement strongly suggests the validity of the new rate analysis for carbon-CO2 reaction.

The catalyst support had minimal impact on the specific rate and gasification rate of the reverse-Boudouard reaction. The activity patterns and activation energies were consistent with those obtained through traditional methods, supporting the effectiveness of the new rate determination technique. The weak interaction between CO2 and Ni on TiO2 could explain why the type of oxide support did not significantly affect the gasification rate.

催化剂支持对反布杜瓦反应的具体速率和气化速率影响很小。活动模式和活化能与通过传统方法获得的数据一致，这支持了新速率分析的有效性。TiO2上CO2与Ni之间较弱的相互作用可以解释为什么氧化物支持类型对气化速率的影响不大。
