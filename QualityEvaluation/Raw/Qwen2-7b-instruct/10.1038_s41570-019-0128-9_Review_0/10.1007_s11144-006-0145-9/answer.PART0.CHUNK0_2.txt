[1] "Very little difference was observed from one catalyst to another, which indicates that the catalyst support hardly influences the gasification rate."
[2] "The activation energy was calculated as 41.8 kJ mol1."
[3] "In our study, however, since carbon was deposited on Ni from CH4 decomposition, there was no difference in the degree of contact among catalysts examined."
[4] "The gasification rate was not significantly influenced by the kind of oxide supports as shown in Fig. 3."

The research found that the catalyst support had minimal impact on the gasification rate of the reverse-Boudouard reaction over supported Ni catalysts. The specific rate constant was determined without knowledge of the number of active sites, revealing that the catalyst support hardly affected the rate. The activity patterns and activation energies matched well with those obtained through conventional methods, supporting the validity of the new rate determination method. The gasification rate was not notably influenced by the type of oxide supports, indicating that the kind of catalyst support did not significantly affect the reaction rate.

研究发现，催化剂支持对支持Ni催化剂上反布杜瓦反应的气化速率影响很小。在不知道活性位点数量的情况下确定了特定速率常数，表明催化剂支持几乎不影响速率。通过传统方法获得的活性模式和活化能与之匹配良好，支持了新速率测定方法的有效性。氧化物支持类型未显著影响气化速率，表明催化剂支持类型对反应速率的影响不大。</ChineseVersionAnswer>
