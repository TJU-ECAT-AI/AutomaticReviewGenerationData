[1] "Very little difference was observed from one catalyst to another, which indicates that the catalyst support hardly influences the gasification rate."
[2] "The gasification rate was not significantly influenced by the kind of oxide supports as shown in Fig. 3."
[3] "The activation energies were ca. 46 kJ/mol for all catalysts, indicating a good agreement with the present results."
[4] "The agreement strongly suggests the validity of the new rate analysis for carbon-CO2 reaction."
[5] "The difference in the activation energy for Ni between ref. [19] and the present study might be ascribed to such contact degree difference."

The research focused on the kinetics of the reverse-Boudouard reaction over supported nickel catalysts. It was found that the catalyst support had minimal impact on the specific rate constant. The activity patterns and activation energies aligned well with those obtained through traditional methods, supporting the validity of the new rate determination method. The activation energy for the reaction was calculated to be approximately 41.8 kJ/mol, showing consistency across different catalyst supports. Comparisons with previous studies indicated that the rate analysis was valid and could accurately reflect the reaction dynamics. The differences in activation energy between this study and others could be attributed to variations in the contact degree between carbon and catalyst.

研究专注于支持镍催化剂上的反布杜瓦尔反应的动力学。发现催化剂支撑对特定速率常数的影响很小。活性模式和活化能与传统方法获得的结果一致，证明了新速率测定方法的有效性。计算得到的激活能量约为41.8 kJ/mol，在不同催化剂支持下保持一致性。与其他研究的比较表明，速率分析是有效的，并能准确反映反应动态。此研究与其他研究之间的激活能差异可能归因于碳与催化剂接触程度的不同。
