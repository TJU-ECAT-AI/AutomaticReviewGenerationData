[1] "Recently several attempts have been made to utilize carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for dehy- drogenation of ethane to yield ethylene because of the growing requirement for alkenes."
[2] "Fe, Co and Mn oxides markedly increased ethylene selectivity, but the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst mainly favored side reactionsthe reforming and cracking reactions."
[3] "The objective of this work is to attempt to improve the ethylene selectivity in the dehydro- genationofethanewithCO2 ontheCr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst with the addition of Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co oxides."
[4] "The ethylene was produced by the direct dehydrogenation of ethane (1) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 (3), which could also be seen as the ethane dehydrogena- tion reaction (1) coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2)."
[5] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species,and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of the modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide."

1. The utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for dehy- drogenation of ethane to yield ethylene has been attempted due to the increasing demand for alkenes. 
2. Ferric oxide (Fe), cobalt oxide (Co), and manganese oxide (Mn) significantly enhanced ethylene selectivity in the dehydrogenation process. Conversely, nickel oxide (Ni) favored the reforming and cracking reactions.
3. The primary goal of the study was to enhance the ethylene selectivity in the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide on chromium oxide/zirconium oxide nanocomposite catalysts by incorporating iron, nickel, manganese, and cobalt oxides.
4. Ethylene was generated through both direct dehydrogenation of ethane and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide, which could be considered as a coupled reaction between ethane dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift reaction.
5. The characteristics of the modifier impacted the textural and structural properties of the catalyst, the distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and the acid/base properties of the catalyst surface. These factors collectively determined the catalytic activity of the modified chromium oxide/zirconium oxide nanocomposite catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide.

1. 利用二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂进行乙烷脱氢生成乙烯的尝试，是由于对烯烃需求的增长。
2. 铁氧化物（Fe）、钴氧化物（Co）和锰氧化物（Mn）显著提高了乙烷脱氢过程中的乙烯选择性。相反，镍氧化物（Ni）倾向于促进重整和裂解反应。
3. 研究的主要目标是在铬氧化物/锆氧化物纳米复合催化剂上通过添加铁、镍、锰和钴氧化物来提高乙烷与二氧化碳脱氢的乙烯选择性。
4. 乙烯可通过直接脱氢乙烷和使用二氧化碳的氧化脱氢产生，这也可以看作是乙烷脱氢反应与水煤气逆向转换反应的耦合。
5. 添加剂的特性影响了催化剂的结构和纹理性质，铬物种和氧物种的分布，以及催化剂表面的酸/碱性质。这些因素共同决定了修改后的铬氧化物/锆氧化物纳米复合催化剂在二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙烷脱氢过程中的催化活性。
