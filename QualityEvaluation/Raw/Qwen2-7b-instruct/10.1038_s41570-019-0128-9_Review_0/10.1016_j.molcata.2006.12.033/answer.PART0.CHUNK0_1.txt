[1] "Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction [57]."
[2] "In the catalytic performance experiment, the ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr, and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts were markedly higher than that of the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst, while their CO2 and ethane conversion decreased, demonstrating that adsorbed oxygen species (OIII) are prone to reduce the reforming reaction."
[3] "These results clearly show that modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts exhibited varying activities in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The modifiers of Fe, Co and Mn oxides markedly increased the ethylene selectivity of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst mainly favored side reactions—the reforming and cracking reactions."
[4] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of the modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide."

1. Chromium-based catalysts are the most effective catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
2. Adsorbed oxygen species (OIII) tend to reduce the reforming reaction, affecting ethylene selectivity.
3. Various modifiers like Fe, Co, and Mn oxides increase ethylene selectivity in dehydrogenation processes, while Ni mainly favors side reactions.
4. The catalyst's properties are influenced by the modifier, affecting its structure, composition, and activity in CO2 dehydrogenation.

1. 铬基催化剂是CO2氧化脱氢反应中最有效的催化剂。
2. 吸附氧物种（OIII）倾向于减少重整反应，影响乙烯选择性。
3. 不同的修饰剂如Fe、Co和Mn氧化物显著提高了Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂的乙烯选择性，而Ni主要促进副反应——重整和裂解反应。
4. 催化剂的性质受到修饰剂的影响，影响其结构、组成和在CO2脱氢中的活性。
