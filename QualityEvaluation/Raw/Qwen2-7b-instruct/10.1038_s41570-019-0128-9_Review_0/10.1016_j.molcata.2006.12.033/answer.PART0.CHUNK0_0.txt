[1] "Recently several attempts have been made to utilize carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for dehy- drogenation of ethane to yield ethylene because of the growing requirement for alkenes."
[2] "Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction."
[3] "Fe, Co and Mn oxides markedly increased ethylene selectivity, but the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst mainly favored side reactions—the reforming and cracking reactions."
[4] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide."

1. Various support materials and reaction conditions impact the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influence the catalyst's properties. Reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, can alter the effectiveness of the catalysts. Trade-offs often exist in optimizing overall performance, balancing factors like activity, selectivity, and stability.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those containing iron, cobalt, and manganese, show improved ethylene selectivity in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation. However, nickel-containing catalysts tend to favor side reactions such as reforming and cracking.

3. The type of modifier used in chromium oxide catalysts affects the catalyst's textural and structural properties, the distribution of chromium species and oxygen species on the catalyst surface, and the acid/base properties. These factors collectively determine the catalyst's performance in ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant.

4. The nature of the modifier influences the catalyst's ability to activate ethane, adsorb and activate CO2, and control the acidity and basicity of the catalyst surface. Optimizing these aspects can lead to enhanced catalytic activity in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

1. 各种支撑材料和反应条件对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径产生影响。例如，硅氧烷、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、铝氧烷、锆氧烷和铈氧烷等支持材料会影响催化剂的特性。反应条件，如二氧化碳分压，可以改变催化剂的有效性。在优化整体性能时，平衡因素如活性、选择性和稳定性之间存在权衡。

2. 特别是含铁、钴和锰的铬氧化物催化剂，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中表现出提高的乙烯选择性。然而，镍基催化剂倾向于促进副反应，如重整和裂解。

3. 催化剂中添加的不同类型修饰剂会影响催化剂的纹理和结构性质，表面铬物种和氧物种的分布，以及酸/碱性质。这些因素共同决定了使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的乙烷脱氢过程中改性铬氧化物纳米复合催化剂的活性。

4. 修饰剂的性质影响催化剂激活乙烷的能力、吸附和激活二氧化碳的能力，以及控制催化剂表面的酸性和碱性。优化这些方面可以导致二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中的催化剂活性增强。
