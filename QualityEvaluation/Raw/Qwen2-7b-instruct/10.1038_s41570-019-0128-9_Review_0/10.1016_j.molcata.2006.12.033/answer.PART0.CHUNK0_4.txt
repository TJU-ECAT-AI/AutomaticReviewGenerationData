[1] "Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction [57]."
[2] "The ethylene was produced by the direct dehydrogenation of ethane (1) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 (3), which could also be seen as the ethane dehydrogenation reaction (1) coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2)."
[3] "Based on this result and other proposed reaction pathways [1,7], the overall reactions can be described as follows:"
[4] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenations of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant."

1. Chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant compared to other materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2.

2. Ethylene production occurs through direct dehydrogenation of ethane and oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2, which is essentially the ethane dehydrogenation reaction coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

3. The overall reactions in the process are described by equations 1, 2, 3, and 4.

4. The modification of the catalyst with different oxides influences its textural and structural properties, the distribution of chromium and oxygen species, and the acid/base properties of the catalyst surface, all of which collectively determine the catalytic activity of the modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethane using CO2 as an oxidant.

1. 铬基催化剂在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂时，对于乙烷脱氢生成乙烯的反应是最有效的催化剂，与硅酸盐、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、铝酸盐、锆酸盐和铈酸盐等材料相比。

2. 乙烯的产生可以通过直接脱氢化乙烷和与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢来实现，这实际上是将乙烷脱氢化反应与水煤气反向变换反应耦合起来。

3. 这个过程的整体反应由方程式1、2、3和4描述。

4. 催化剂的不同氧化物修饰影响其结构和纹理性质，铬和氧物种的分布，以及催化剂表面的酸/碱性质，所有这些共同决定了改性Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂在使用二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙烷脱氢化中的催化活性。
