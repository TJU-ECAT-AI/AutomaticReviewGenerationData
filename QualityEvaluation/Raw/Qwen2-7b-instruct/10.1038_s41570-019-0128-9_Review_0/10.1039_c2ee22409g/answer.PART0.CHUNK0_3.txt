1. Various support materials, including SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 notably provides the highest conversion of ethane, best ethylene selectivity, and best stability, as observed in studies comparing different supports. The support materials alter the properties of the dispersed active sites, typically by modifying their acidic or basic characteristics. The role of the support material is crucial in the catalytic cycle of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions with CO2, and the choice of support for a specific metal oxide system plays a pivotal role in determining the overall catalytic performance.

2. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the performance of these catalysts include increasing CO2 conversions while minimizing coke deposition, enhancing catalytic efficiency per pass, and ensuring thermal stability. These factors often require balancing between high activity and selectivity, stability under reaction conditions, and the prevention of catalyst deactivation due to carbon buildup.

1. 不同支持材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）对铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应途径产生显著影响。SiO2表现出最高程度的乙烷转化、最佳的乙烯选择性和最佳的稳定性，在比较不同支持材料的研究中观察到这一点。支持材料通过修改其酸性或碱性性质，改变分散活性位点的特性。支持材料在二氧化碳氧化脱氢催化循环中的作用至关重要，对于特定金属氧化物系统的支持材料的选择是确定整体催化性能的关键因素。

2. 在优化这些催化剂性能时的主要挑战和权衡包括提高二氧化碳转化率的同时减少焦炭沉积，增强每通过一次反应的催化效率，并确保催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性。这些因素往往需要在高活性与选择性、稳定性和防止催化剂由于碳积聚而失活之间进行平衡。
