How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 demonstrated the highest conversion of ethane, with the best ethylene selectivity and stability. On the other hand, Cr2O3 supported on Al2O3 and ZrO2 showed comparable surface areas to SiO2, but with slightly lower activity. CeO2 supported Cr2O3 exhibited moderate conversion, selectivity, and stability, while H-ZSM-5 supported Cr2O3 had lower conversion, selectivity, and shorter stability. The partial reduction of chromium is essential for initiating the reaction over redox catalysts. The ease of oxygen transfer in the supported catalysts also impacts their performance. The choice of support is crucial in optimizing the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

各种支持材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）以及反应条件（包括CO2分压）对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径有显著影响。例如，SiO2上负载的Cr2O3显示出最高的乙烷转化率，具有最佳的乙烯选择性和稳定性。相比之下，Al2O3和ZrO2负载的Cr2O3与SiO2负载的Cr2O3具有相似的表面积，但活性稍低。CeO2负载的Cr2O3表现出适度的转化率、选择性和稳定性，而H-ZSM-5负载的Cr2O3则具有较低的转化率、选择性和较短的稳定性。铬的部分还原是启动氧化脱氢反应的关键。支持催化剂中氧气的易转移也是影响其性能的因素。支持的选择对于优化铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的整体性能至关重要。
