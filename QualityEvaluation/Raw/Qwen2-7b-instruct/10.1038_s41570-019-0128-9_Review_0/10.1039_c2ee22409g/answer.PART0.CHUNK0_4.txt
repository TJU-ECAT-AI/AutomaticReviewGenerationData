<p>Nevertheless, even in CO2 mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the support can have a large influence on the perfor- mance of the catalyst. The support brings modification of the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties.</p>
<p>The studies by Nakagawa et al. on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide over Cr2O3 supported on oxidized diamond evidenced a synergy between the support and Cr2O3, which promoted the catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2.</p>
<p>However, the phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts are the factors that affect the catalytic performance of these redox catalysts.</p>
<p>The promotional effect of carbon dioxide was observed in the oxidation of cyclic olefins in the co-presence of CO2 with molecular oxygen over mesoporous carbon nitrides as metal-free catalysts. An investigation of the surface properties after the reaction revealed the occurrence of carbamate, which was indicated in the FTIR spectrum as a new band at 1419 cm−1. This observation indicated the initial activation of carbon dioxide takes place by the formation of surface carbamate.</p>

The support materials significantly influence the performance of catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Supports like SiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 modify the properties of the dispersed active sites based on their acidic or basic characteristics. A synergy was observed between the support and chromium oxide in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 showed the highest conversion, selectivity, and stability. Factors affecting the catalytic performance include the phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support, support nature, changes in metal-oxygen bond strengths, and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts. The promotional effect of CO2 in the oxidation of cyclic olefins was attributed to the formation of surface carbamate, indicating its initial activation.

在CO2介导的氧化脱氢反应中，支持材料显著影响催化剂的性能。SiO2、ZrO2、Al2O3和TiO2等支持物通过其酸性或碱性特性修改分散活性位点的性质。在乙烷氧化脱氢过程中观察到了支持物与铬氧化物之间的协同作用。在SiO2上负载的Cr2O3显示了最高的转化率、选择性和稳定性。影响催化性能的因素包括金属氧键相态和分布、支持物类型、支持物性质、金属-氧键强度的变化以及支持催化剂中的氧转移易度。在CO2的存在下，表面羧酸盐的形成解释了环烯烃氧化过程中的CO2促进效果，表明了其初始激活。
