The preparation of highly dispersed Chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 was investigated. Various support materials, including SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, were studied, and reaction conditions such as CO2 partial pressure were found to influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of these catalysts. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance were also identified.
