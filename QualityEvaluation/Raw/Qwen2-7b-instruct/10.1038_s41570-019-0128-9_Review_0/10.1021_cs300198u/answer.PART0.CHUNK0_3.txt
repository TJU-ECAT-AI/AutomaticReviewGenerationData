The preparation of highly dispersed chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. Various support materials, including silica, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, along with different reaction conditions such as CO2 partial pressure, significantly impact the catalyst's activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance include balancing the support material's properties to enhance the catalyst's efficiency while maintaining its stability under harsh reaction conditions.
