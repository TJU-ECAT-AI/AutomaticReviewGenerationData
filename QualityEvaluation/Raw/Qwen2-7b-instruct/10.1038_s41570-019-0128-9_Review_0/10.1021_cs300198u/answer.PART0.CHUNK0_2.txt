The preparation of highly dispersed chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 was studied. The impact of various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, on the catalysts' activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways was explored. Balancing these factors is crucial for optimizing the catalysts' overall performance.
