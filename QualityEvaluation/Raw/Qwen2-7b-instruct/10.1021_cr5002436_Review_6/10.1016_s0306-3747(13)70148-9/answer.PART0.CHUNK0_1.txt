The described methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly propane and isobutane reactions, addresses the challenges of evaluating diverse catalysts by focusing on specific performance criteria such as olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. By concentrating on these metrics, researchers can systematically compare catalysts based on their efficiency in producing olefins, their durability over time, and their productivity rate, respectively. This approach simplifies the evaluation process and allows for a fair comparison among catalysts. However, excluding other factors might lead to an incomplete understanding of catalyst behavior and could potentially overlook important aspects that affect overall performance in real-world applications. For instance, factors like cost, selectivity, and environmental impact are crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of catalysts in industrial settings.

对于非氧化脱氢化C2-C4烷烃，特别是丙烷和异丁烷反应中催化剂性能的比较描述的方法，通过集中于特定性能指标（如烯烃产率、稳定性及空间速度）来解决评估不同催化剂的挑战。这种方法允许研究人员系统地根据催化剂在生产烯烃的效率、耐久性和生产力方面进行比较，简化了评估过程并允许公平比较催化剂。然而，排除其他因素可能导致对催化剂行为的理解不完整，并可能忽视影响实际应用中整体性能的重要方面。例如，在工业环境中，成本、选择性及环境影响等都是评估催化剂时需要考虑的关键因素。
