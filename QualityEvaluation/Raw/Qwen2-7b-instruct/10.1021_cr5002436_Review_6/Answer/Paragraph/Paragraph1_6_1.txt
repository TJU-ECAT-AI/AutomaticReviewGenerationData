        A comprehensive methodology for assessing catalyst performance in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, specifically focusing on propane and isobutane reactions, has been developed. This approach centers on three key performance indicators: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. By adopting a standardized method to evaluate these aspects, the complexity of comparing diverse catalysts is significantly reduced, thereby enabling a clearer insight into catalyst behavior and facilitating the selection of the most efficient catalysts for the targeted reactions. The emphasis on specific criteria streamlines the evaluation process, enhancing its manageability and cost-effectiveness. However, this approach may inadvertently overlook less quantifiable factors that also impact catalyst performance.

        The utilization of this methodology in the petrochemical industry, particularly in regions with low-permeability reservoirs such as Eastern Siberia, has proven instrumental in optimizing processes, increasing yields, and reducing costs. It provides a robust framework for catalyst assessment that can be adapted and refined to suit various operational environments and requirements. The comparative analysis based on these metrics not only aids in the selection of optimal catalysts but also drives innovation in process design and operational strategies.

        Integrative Understanding and Prospective Outlook:
        Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the referenced documents, there exists an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies that could further enhance catalyst performance evaluation. Future research efforts might focus on integrating machine learning algorithms to predict catalyst performance based on a wider array of input parameters, including environmental conditions and feedstock characteristics. Additionally, the exploration of alternative catalyst materials and synthesis methods could lead to the development of catalysts with superior performance in challenging industrial settings, such as those found in low-permeability reservoirs. These innovations would not only improve efficiency and sustainability in the petrochemical sector but also pave the way for advancements in other industries that rely on catalytic processes.

        对C2-C4烷烃（特别是丙烷和异丁烷反应）非氧化脱氢催化剂性能进行比较的方法论进行了深入研究。该方法论专注于三大关键性能指标：烯烃产率、稳定性和空速。通过采用标准化的方法来评估这些方面，比较不同催化剂的复杂性显著降低，从而为了解催化剂行为提供了清晰的视角，并有助于选择最高效的催化剂用于目标反应。对特定标准的关注简化了评估过程，使其更加易于管理和成本效益高。然而，这种方法可能忽略了影响催化剂性能的不可量化因素。

        在石油化学工业中，特别是在低渗透性油藏如东斯伯利亚地区，这种方法论已被证明在优化流程、提高产量和降低成本方面发挥了重要作用。它提供了一个强大的框架，用于评估催化剂，可以根据不同的运营环境和需求进行调整和改进。基于这些指标的比较分析不仅有助于选择最佳催化剂，而且还可以推动工艺设计和操作策略的创新。
