            A comprehensive methodology has been developed for assessing the performance of catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, specifically targeting propane and isobutane reactions. This approach emphasizes key performance indicators such as olefin yield, stability, and space velocity, providing a systematic framework to compare and select the most efficient catalysts. By focusing on these specific criteria, the methodology facilitates a more streamlined and cost-effective evaluation process, which is particularly advantageous in the complex and resource-intensive field of petrochemical industry, especially in regions like Eastern Siberia with challenging low-permeability reservoir conditions. The approach addresses the inherent challenge of comparing diverse catalysts by establishing a standardized evaluation method, thereby enhancing our understanding of catalyst behavior and performance under various operational conditions.

            Integrative Understanding and Prospective Outlook:
            Considering the detailed insights provided in this document, there is considerable potential for advancing the field by exploring novel methodologies and emerging technologies. Future research might aim to incorporate additional, less quantifiable factors that influence catalyst performance, such as catalyst particle size distribution, surface chemistry, and interaction with the reaction environment. These enhancements could provide a more holistic view of catalyst performance, leading to more accurate predictions of their behavior under real-world conditions. Moreover, there is an opportunity to leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to optimize the screening process, potentially reducing the time and resources required for identifying high-performance catalysts. Such developments would not only accelerate the discovery of new catalysts but also pave the way for more sustainable and efficient petrochemical production processes, particularly in regions with challenging geological settings.
