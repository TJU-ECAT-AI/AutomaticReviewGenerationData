        The methodology outlined in this review focuses on the critical performance indicators of olefin yield, stability, and space velocity for evaluating catalyst performance in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly in the context of propane and isobutane reactions. This approach addresses the multifaceted challenge of comparing diverse catalysts by providing a standardized framework that allows for a clear and systematic understanding of catalyst behavior and enables the selection of the most efficient catalysts for the given reactions. By concentrating on specific performance criteria, the evaluation process becomes more streamlined, enhancing its manageability and cost-effectiveness. However, this focus might inadvertently overlook other less quantifiable factors that also significantly influence catalyst performance.

        The comparative analysis, grounded in these metrics, not only supports the optimization of processes but also leads to enhanced yields and reduced costs in the petrochemical industry, particularly in regions characterized by low-permeability reservoirs such as Eastern Siberia. The study highlights the pivotal role of catalysts in the conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable products, underscoring the importance of precise and efficient catalyst selection for industrial applications.

        Looking ahead, the file suggests avenues for future research that could expand the scope of catalyst evaluation beyond the traditional parameters of olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. Potential areas of exploration include the development of new catalysts that can operate under a wider range of conditions, the integration of computational methods for predicting catalyst performance, and the investigation of synergistic effects between different components of catalytic systems. These advancements could lead to significant improvements in the efficiency and sustainability of petrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goals of resource optimization and environmental stewardship.

        The methodology and insights presented here provide a solid foundation for understanding the complex interactions between catalysts and their performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. As the field continues to evolve, incorporating these findings into the design and evaluation of new catalysts will be crucial for advancing the petrochemical industry towards more sustainable and economically viable practices.

        本综述中阐述的方法聚焦于评价C2-C4烷烃非氧化脱氢反应，尤其是丙烷和异丁烷反应中催化剂性能的关键指标——烯烃产率、稳定性及空间速度。通过提供一种标准化框架，该方法解决了比较不同催化剂的复杂挑战，使我们能够清晰地了解催化剂行为，并从中选出最适合特定反应的高效催化剂。集中关注特定性能指标，使得评估过程更加简化，提高了其可管理和成本效益性。然而，这种聚焦可能忽略了影响催化剂性能的其他不可量化的因素。

        基于这些指标进行的比较分析不仅支持了工艺优化，而且在资源稀缺地区如西伯利亚东部等低渗透度油藏中，促进了更高产量和更低成本的产出。研究强调了催化剂在烃类转化过程中的关键作用，突出了催化剂选择对于工业应用的重要性。

        向前看，文件提出了一些未来研究的方向，旨在拓宽催化剂评估的视野，超越传统的烯烃产率、稳定性及空间速度参数。潜在的研究领域包括开发能够在更广泛条件下运行的新催化剂、集成计算方法预测催化剂性能以及探究催化系统组件之间协同效应的可能性。这些进步有可能显著提高石油化学过程的效率和可持续性，为实现资源优化和环境责任的目标做出贡献。

        所提出的方法和见解为深入理解非氧化脱氢反应中催化剂的复杂相互作用提供了坚实的基础。随着该领域的不断发展，将这些发现融入新催化剂的设计和评估之中，对于推动石油化学行业向更可持续和经济可行的实践迈进至关重要。
