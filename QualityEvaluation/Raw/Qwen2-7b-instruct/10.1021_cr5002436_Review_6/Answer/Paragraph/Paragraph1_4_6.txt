        The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly propane and isobutane reactions, is centered around three key performance indicators: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. This approach addresses the challenge of evaluating diverse catalysts by providing a standardized method for comparison, thus enhancing clarity in understanding catalyst behavior and enabling the selection of the most efficient catalysts for the given reactions. By focusing on specific criteria, the evaluation process becomes more streamlined, manageable, and cost-effective, albeit potentially overlooking less quantifiable factors that influence catalyst performance.

        The utilization of these specific performance metrics in a comparative analysis supports the optimization of processes, enhances yields, and reduces costs in the petrochemical industry, especially in regions with low-permeability reservoirs such as Eastern Siberia. This highlights the methodology's practical application and its significance in enhancing operational efficiency in challenging environments.
