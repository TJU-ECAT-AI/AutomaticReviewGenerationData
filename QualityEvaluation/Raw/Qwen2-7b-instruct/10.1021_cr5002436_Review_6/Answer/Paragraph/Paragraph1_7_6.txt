        The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, as outlined in the study \[1154\], centers on three key criteria: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. This approach addresses the multifaceted challenge of evaluating diverse catalysts through a standardized method, thereby facilitating a clearer insight into catalyst behavior and enabling the selection of the most efficient catalysts for specific reactions. By focusing on these specific criteria, the evaluation process becomes streamlined, enhancing its manageability and cost-effectiveness. However, this emphasis on quantifiable factors might inadvertently overlook less tangible aspects influencing catalyst performance. Despite this limitation, the comparative analysis based on these metrics significantly contributes to optimizing industrial processes, increasing yields, and reducing costs, particularly in regions with low-permeability reservoirs such as Eastern Siberia.
