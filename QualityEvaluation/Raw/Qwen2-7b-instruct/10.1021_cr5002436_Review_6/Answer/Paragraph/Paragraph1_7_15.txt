        The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly focusing on propane and isobutane reactions, employs a systematic approach centered on olefin yield, stability, and space velocity as key performance indicators. This strategy effectively addresses the challenge of evaluating diverse catalysts by establishing a standardized framework that facilitates a clear understanding of catalyst behavior and enables the selection of the most efficient catalysts for specific reactions. By concentrating on these specific criteria, the evaluation process becomes more streamlined and cost-effective, albeit with the acknowledgment that less quantifiable factors influencing catalyst performance may be overlooked.

        The comparative analysis grounded in these metrics significantly supports the optimization of processes, enhancing yields, and reducing costs in the petrochemical industry, especially in regions with low-permeability reservoirs such as Eastern Siberia. This approach underscores the importance of a focused yet comprehensive evaluation strategy that balances efficiency with practicality in complex industrial settings.
