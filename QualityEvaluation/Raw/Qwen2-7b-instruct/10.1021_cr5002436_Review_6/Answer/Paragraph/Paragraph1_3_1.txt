        A comprehensive methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly focusing on propane and isobutane reactions, has been developed. This approach emphasizes specific performance criteria such as olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. The methodology addresses the challenge of evaluating diverse catalysts by providing a standardized framework that enables a clearer understanding of catalyst behavior and facilitates the selection of the most efficient catalysts for the reactions at hand. By concentrating on these key metrics, the evaluation process becomes more streamlined, cost-effective, and manageable. However, this focus on quantifiable factors may overlook less tangible aspects that influence catalyst performance. The comparative analysis based on these metrics supports the optimization of processes, enhances yields, and reduces costs in the petrochemical industry, particularly in regions with low-permeability reservoirs like Eastern Siberia.

        Building upon this methodology, future research can explore emerging fields and innovative approaches. With a deeper understanding of catalyst behavior and performance criteria, there is potential to refine existing techniques and develop novel catalysts. Future studies could delve into the effects of reaction conditions, catalyst composition, and support materials on performance, aiming to tailor catalysts specifically for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins. Additionally, incorporating machine learning algorithms to predict catalyst performance based on various parameters could enhance the efficiency of the screening process. This would enable researchers to identify promising catalyst candidates more quickly and with greater accuracy. Moreover, investigating the impact of catalyst recycling and regeneration methods could lead to sustainable practices that reduce waste and improve operational efficiency in the petrochemical industry.

        Acknowledging the limitations of focusing solely on specific performance metrics, future work should also consider the integration of environmental sustainability and economic viability into the evaluation framework. This would ensure that new catalyst developments not only optimize yields and reduce costs but also minimize environmental impact and contribute to long-term economic benefits. Overall, the proposed methodology serves as a robust foundation for catalysis research, offering a structured approach to catalyst development and evaluation. As the field evolves, it will be crucial to adapt and expand upon this methodology to address emerging challenges and capitalize on technological advancements.
