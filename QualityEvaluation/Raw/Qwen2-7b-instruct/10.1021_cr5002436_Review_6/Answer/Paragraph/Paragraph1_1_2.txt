        The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, as detailed in \[1\], employs a systematic approach that hinges on three key performance indicators: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. This framework allows for a standardized assessment of catalyst efficiency, thereby facilitating a clear understanding of catalyst behavior and enabling the selection of the most effective catalysts for propane and isobutane reactions. By focusing on these specific criteria, the evaluation process becomes streamlined, enhancing its manageability and cost-effectiveness. However, this approach may inadvertently overlook certain less quantifiable factors that also influence catalyst performance.

        The comparative analysis based on these metrics has significant implications for optimizing industrial processes, increasing yields, and reducing costs in the petrochemical sector, particularly in regions with low-permeability reservoirs such as Eastern Siberia. The study underscores the importance of a targeted evaluation strategy in catalyst selection and emphasizes the need for further research into methodologies that can comprehensively account for both quantifiable and less tangible factors affecting catalytic activity.

        Integrative Understanding and Prospective Outlook:
        Considering the advancements and findings presented in the file, there exists a fertile ground for exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies in catalyst evaluation. Future research endeavors might focus on developing multi-criteria evaluation systems that incorporate a wider array of performance indicators, including environmental impact, energy consumption, and selectivity. This would not only enhance the precision of catalyst selection but also pave the way for more sustainable and economically viable industrial practices. Additionally, incorporating real-time monitoring and predictive modeling could enable dynamic optimization of reaction conditions, leading to improved process efficiency and reduced operational costs. Such approaches could significantly contribute to the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly petrochemical processes, particularly in challenging environments like those found in Eastern Siberia.

        非氧化脱氢化C2-C4烷烃催化剂性能比较的方法，如在\[1\]文献中详细描述的那样，以烯烃产率、稳定性以及空速作为评估指标。这种方法提供了一个标准化的评估框架，有助于清晰地理解催化剂的行为，并选择最适合丙烷和异丁烷反应的催化剂。通过聚焦这些特定指标，评估过程得以简化，提高了其管理和成本效益。然而，这种方法可能忽略了影响催化剂性能的一些不可量化的因素。

        基于这些指标的比较分析对优化工业流程、提高产量和降低石化行业成本具有重要意义，尤其是在低渗透性油藏如西伯利亚东部地区这样的挑战环境中。研究强调了在催化剂选择中采用针对性评估策略的重要性，并指出了需要进一步研究更全面评估方法的必要性，以同时考虑量化和非量化的影响因素。

        整合理解和前瞻性展望：
        结合文件中呈现的进展和发现，探索新兴领域和创新方法在催化剂评估方面的前景十分广阔。未来的研究努力可能侧重于开发整合更多绩效指标的多指标评估系统，包括环境影响、能源消耗和选择性。这不仅会增强催化剂选择的精确度，还会为更加可持续和经济有效的工业实践铺平道路。此外，集成实时监测和预测建模可以实现动态优化反应条件，从而提高流程效率并降低运营成本。此类方法有望显著推动更高效和环境友好的石化过程的发展，特别是在西伯利亚东部这样的复杂环境中。
