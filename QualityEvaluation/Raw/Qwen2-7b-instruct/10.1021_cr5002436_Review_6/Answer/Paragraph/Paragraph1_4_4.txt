        The comprehensive methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, with a focus on propane and isobutane reactions, addresses the multifaceted challenge of evaluating diverse catalysts through a systematic approach that emphasizes specific performance criteria such as olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. This method enables a clear understanding of catalyst behavior and facilitates the selection of the most efficient catalysts for the targeted reactions, streamlining the evaluation process to be both manageable and cost-effective. However, this approach acknowledges that it may overlook less quantifiable factors influencing catalyst performance, which could potentially impact the overall assessment of catalyst efficiency.

        The utilization of these specific criteria for comparative analysis supports the optimization of processes, enhancing yields, and reducing costs in the petrochemical industry, particularly in regions with low-permeability reservoirs such as Eastern Siberia. The focus on these metrics not only accelerates the development of efficient catalytic systems but also ensures their practical applicability in challenging environments, thereby contributing significantly to the economic viability and environmental sustainability of the industry.

        The methodology presented here provides a robust framework for researchers and industry professionals to navigate the complexities of catalyst selection and optimization, ensuring that they can make informed decisions based on empirical data and standardized performance indicators. It is essential to acknowledge that while this approach offers a streamlined solution, future research should aim to incorporate additional factors that might influence catalyst performance, thereby providing a more holistic and nuanced understanding of catalyst behavior under various operational conditions.
