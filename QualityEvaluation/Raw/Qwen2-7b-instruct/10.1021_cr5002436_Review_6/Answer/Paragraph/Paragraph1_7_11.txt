        The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly focusing on propane and isobutane reactions, employs a systematic approach that emphasizes key performance indicators such as olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. This approach addresses the challenge of evaluating diverse catalysts by providing a standardized framework that facilitates a clear understanding of catalyst behavior and enables the selection of the most efficient catalysts for specific reactions. By concentrating on these specific performance criteria, the methodology streamlines the evaluation process, making it more manageable and cost-effective. However, this focus may inadvertently overlook less quantifiable factors that influence catalyst performance, which could impact the accuracy of comparisons in certain scenarios.

        The use of olefin yield, stability, and space velocity as primary metrics allows for a comparative analysis that supports the optimization of processes, enhances yields, and reduces costs in the petrochemical industry, especially in regions with low-permeability reservoirs such as Eastern Siberia. This approach not only aids in the selection of optimal catalysts but also contributes to the development of more efficient and economically viable dehydrogenation processes.

        The comprehensive methodology presented in the referenced studies provides a robust foundation for future research and development in the field of catalysis. It encourages the exploration of new catalyst materials and conditions, fostering innovation and improvements in the efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation reactions. The exclusion of less quantifiable factors may limit the depth of understanding in some cases, but the streamlined approach remains valuable for practical applications where rapid, cost-effective assessments are necessary.
