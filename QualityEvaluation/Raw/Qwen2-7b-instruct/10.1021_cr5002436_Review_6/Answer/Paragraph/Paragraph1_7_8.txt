        The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly focusing on propane and isobutane reactions, as elaborated in \[1\], is centered around evaluating catalysts based on three key performance indicators: olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. This approach addresses the challenge of comparing diverse catalysts by establishing a standardized method that facilitates a clear understanding of catalyst behavior and enables the selection of the most efficient catalysts for the specific reactions. By concentrating on these specific criteria, the evaluation process becomes streamlined, enhancing its manageability and cost-effectiveness, albeit at the expense of potentially overlooking less quantifiable factors that influence catalyst performance.

        This comparative analysis, grounded in the metrics of olefin yield, stability, and space velocity, significantly contributes to the optimization of processes, enhancement of yields, and reduction of costs in the petrochemical industry. Notably, this methodology is particularly advantageous in regions with low-permeability reservoirs, such as Eastern Siberia, where efficient catalysts can play a pivotal role in improving oil well productivity and overall operational efficiency.

        The comprehensive approach outlined here not only aids in the direct comparison of catalysts but also paves the way for future research endeavors that could explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future studies might aim to integrate additional performance metrics, consider catalyst interactions with different feedstocks, or investigate the impact of various operating conditions on catalyst performance. These advancements could further refine the methodology, providing even more nuanced insights into catalyst behavior and catalytic process optimization.

        In summary, the methodology presented in this document serves as a robust framework for catalyst assessment in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, offering valuable insights into catalyst selection and process optimization, especially in challenging environments like those found in Eastern Siberia. It underscores the importance of focusing on specific performance criteria while acknowledging the need for continuous improvement and expansion of the evaluation parameters to encompass a broader range of factors influencing catalyst performance.
