            The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly in the context of propane and isobutane reactions, employs a systematic approach that emphasizes the evaluation of olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. This approach addresses the challenge of assessing diverse catalysts by providing a standardized framework that allows for a clearer understanding of catalyst behavior and facilitates the selection of the most efficient catalysts for the given reactions. By focusing on these specific criteria, the evaluation process becomes more streamlined and cost-effective, albeit potentially overlooking less quantifiable factors that influence catalyst performance.

            The comparative analysis based on these metrics directly supports the optimization of processes, enhancing yields, and reducing costs in the petrochemical industry, especially in regions characterized by low-permeability reservoirs such as Eastern Siberia. This highlights the importance of considering the unique operational conditions of these environments when selecting catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

            The implications of this methodology are significant, as it offers a practical solution for the industry to efficiently compare and select catalysts tailored to the specific demands of C2-C4 paraffin dehydrogenation. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations associated with focusing solely on quantifiable performance indicators. The methodology might not fully capture the complex interactions between catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the broader operational context.

            To address these limitations, future research could explore integrating additional performance metrics, such as selectivity and environmental impact, alongside the existing criteria. This would provide a more holistic assessment of catalyst performance, allowing for a more informed decision-making process in the selection of catalysts for industrial applications.

            The comparative analysis based on the methodology described has direct implications for the optimization of existing processes and the development of new catalysts designed specifically for the dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins. It encourages a more nuanced understanding of catalyst behavior under various conditions and promotes the continuous improvement of petrochemical processes.
