        The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, as detailed in the referenced studies \[1\], \[2\], and \[3\], primarily hinges on evaluating three key performance indicators: olefin yield, catalyst stability, and space velocity. This systematic approach enables a clear differentiation between catalysts, facilitating the selection of the most effective catalysts for the targeted reactions. By focusing on these specific performance criteria, the evaluation process becomes streamlined, enhancing its manageability and cost-effectiveness. However, this methodology may inadvertently overlook less quantifiable factors that also significantly influence catalyst performance. Despite these limitations, the comparative analysis grounded in these metrics significantly contributes to optimizing processes, boosting yields, and reducing costs in the petrochemical industry, particularly in areas characterized by low-permeability reservoirs, such as Eastern Siberia.

        The comprehensive methodology, when applied to the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane, ensures a thorough understanding of catalyst behavior under various conditions. It provides insights into how different catalysts respond to varying space velocities, thereby influencing the yield of olefins and the stability of the catalytic system over time. This approach facilitates the identification of catalysts that not only produce high olefin yields but also maintain consistent performance over extended periods, which is crucial for industrial applications.

        The exclusion of certain factors for the sake of simplicity and standardization does not undermine the effectiveness of the methodology but rather necessitates a nuanced interpretation of the results. The focus on olefin yield, stability, and space velocity allows for a direct comparison of catalysts, which can then be tailored to specific operational parameters. This tailored approach ensures that the selected catalysts are optimized for the specific conditions encountered in the industry, including those in low-permeability reservoirs.

        Looking ahead, the methodology outlined in the studies presents several avenues for future exploration. The integration of additional performance indicators, such as selectivity and energy consumption, could provide a more holistic view of catalyst efficiency. Moreover, the consideration of catalyst regeneration capabilities and their environmental impact would further enhance the methodology’s applicability and sustainability in the petrochemical industry. The use of advanced materials and the development of novel catalyst designs could also lead to significant improvements in catalyst performance, potentially revolutionizing the dehydrogenation process.

        In conclusion, the methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins offers a robust framework for selecting the most suitable catalysts for industrial applications. While acknowledging the limitations associated with focusing solely on specific performance criteria, this methodology remains a cornerstone in the field, driving innovation and efficiency in the petrochemical industry. The future direction of this methodology should aim to incorporate a broader spectrum of performance indicators and to embrace new technologies that can further optimize catalyst performance and sustainability.
