        A comprehensive methodology has been developed for comparing catalyst performance in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, with a particular emphasis on propane and isobutane reactions. This methodology focuses on key performance indicators such as olefin yield, stability, and space velocity, enabling a standardized approach to evaluate diverse catalysts. It facilitates a clearer understanding of catalyst behavior and enables the selection of the most efficient catalysts for the specific reactions involved. By concentrating on specific criteria, the evaluation process becomes more streamlined and cost-effective, albeit with potential oversight of less quantifiable factors impacting catalyst performance. This comparative analysis, grounded in the assessment of olefin yield, stability, and space velocity, significantly supports the optimization of processes, enhancement of yields, and reduction of costs in the petrochemical industry, especially in areas with low-permeability reservoirs like Eastern Siberia.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Building upon the foundational insights provided in the referenced documents, future research avenues might explore the integration of advanced computational methods to predict catalyst performance more accurately. There is also potential for the development of novel catalysts that can operate under a wider range of conditions, including those found in low-permeability reservoirs. Additionally, the incorporation of sustainability criteria could guide the selection and design of catalysts that minimize environmental impact while maximizing economic benefits. Future studies could also delve into the dynamic interactions between catalysts and feedstocks, aiming to optimize reaction kinetics and selectivities for enhanced product quality and efficiency.
