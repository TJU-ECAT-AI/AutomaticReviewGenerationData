        The methodology outlined in the referenced studies \[1\], \[2\], and \[3\] centers on the assessment of catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, specifically focusing on propane and isobutane reactions. This approach employs specific performance criteria—olefin yield, stability, and space velocity—to provide a standardized framework for evaluating and comparing diverse catalysts. By concentrating on these metrics, the methodology offers a clear insight into catalyst behavior and enables the identification of the most efficient catalysts for the targeted reactions. This streamlined evaluation process is advantageous for its manageability and cost-effectiveness, albeit with the potential limitation of overlooking certain less quantifiable factors that could influence catalyst performance. The comparative analysis grounded in these performance indicators facilitates the optimization of industrial processes, thereby enhancing yields and reducing costs, particularly in regions characterized by low-permeability reservoirs such as Eastern Siberia.

        The focus on specific criteria not only simplifies the assessment but also underscores the importance of operational parameters in catalyst selection. It highlights the critical role of olefin yield in determining the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process, the significance of stability in ensuring consistent performance over time, and the relevance of space velocity in balancing reaction kinetics with practical constraints. These elements collectively contribute to a holistic understanding of catalyst performance, allowing for informed decision-making in the development and application of catalytic systems.

        The methodology's applicability extends beyond the immediate scope of propane and isobutane reactions, offering a versatile tool for the evaluation of catalysts across different hydrocarbon transformations. Its emphasis on key performance indicators provides a benchmark against which new catalysts can be compared, fostering innovation and the continuous improvement of catalytic technologies.

        Looking ahead, the future directions in this field could include the integration of additional performance metrics that capture the broader impact of catalysts on downstream processes and product quality. The exploration of alternative catalyst materials with improved selectivity and activity, alongside the optimization of operating conditions, holds promise for further enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of petrochemical industries. Moreover, the adaptation of these methodologies to address the challenges posed by renewable feedstocks and the development of more sustainable chemical production routes are areas that could significantly benefit from the insights provided by this comparative approach.

        In summary, the methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, with a focus on propane and isobutane reactions, serves as a robust foundation for the systematic evaluation and selection of catalysts. Its emphasis on specific performance criteria while acknowledging the limitations and excluded factors offers a nuanced understanding of catalyst behavior and guides the optimization of processes in the petrochemical industry. As the field advances, the potential for expanding this methodology to encompass a wider array of factors and applications promises to drive innovation and efficiency in the synthesis of valuable chemicals from hydrocarbons.
