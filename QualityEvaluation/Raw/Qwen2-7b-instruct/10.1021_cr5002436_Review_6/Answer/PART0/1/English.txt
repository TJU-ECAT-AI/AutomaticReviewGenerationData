The methodology focuses on olefin yield, stability, and space velocity to evaluate catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, addressing the challenge of comparing diverse catalysts through a standardized approach. This allows for a clearer understanding of catalyst behavior and selection of the most efficient catalysts for the given reactions. The focus on specific criteria streamlines the evaluation process, making it more manageable and cost-effective, although it may overlook less quantifiable factors influencing catalyst performance. The comparative analysis based on these metrics supports optimization of processes, enhances yields, and reduces costs in the petrochemical industry, particularly in regions with low-permeability reservoirs like Eastern Siberia.
