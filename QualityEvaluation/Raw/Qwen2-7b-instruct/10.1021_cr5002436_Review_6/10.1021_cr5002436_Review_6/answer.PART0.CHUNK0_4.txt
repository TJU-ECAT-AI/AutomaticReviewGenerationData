5.2 In Terms of Propane and Isobutane Dehydrogenation Performance
Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations.
In Figure 31, the yields of propylene and isobutene are plotted versus the deactivation rate of Pt-, CrOx-, GaOx-, and In2O3-based catalysts.
Space velocity is another important factor that has been considered to compare the performance of different dehydrogenation catalysts.
Notably, the performance criteria compared were measured during propane or isobutane dehydrogenation, which are the reactions that have been researched most intensively.
It is important to mention that catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used.
The differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods previously discussed in section 4.
To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts.

The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins focuses on specific performance criteria such as olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. These criteria are chosen to highlight qualitative differences between various catalyst formulations while addressing the challenge of evaluating diverse catalysts. By concentrating on these parameters, the study aims to reveal how different catalysts behave under similar conditions. The exclusion of other factors like pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support is justified due to missing information, lack of clear trends, and high variability. The approach ensures a meaningful comparison of catalysts based on the performance criteria measured during propane or isobutane dehydrogenation, which are the most extensively researched reactions. The results indicate that Pt-based catalysts generally outperform metal oxide-based catalysts in terms of stability and specific activity, despite both providing comparable yields. The higher space velocities that Pt catalysts can handle and their lower deactivation rates contribute to their superior performance, as evidenced by the calculated activation energies and specific activity values.

在非氧化脱氢C2-C4烷烃的催化剂性能比较中，方法侧重于特定性能指标，如烯烃产率、稳定性和空速。这些标准被选用来突出不同催化剂配方之间的质性差异，同时解决评估多种催化剂的挑战。通过集中关注这些参数，研究旨在揭示不同催化剂在相似条件下表现的方式。排除其他因素（如压力、温度、制备方法、促进剂和催化剂支持）是合理的，因为这些信息缺失、缺乏明确趋势以及单个变量的高变异性。这种方法确保基于在丙烷或异丁烷脱氢过程中测量的性能指标进行有意义的比较。结果表明，铂基催化剂通常在稳定性、特定活性方面优于金属氧化物基催化剂，尽管两者都能提供相当的产率。铂催化剂能够处理更高的空速和较低的失活率，这进一步突出了它们的优越性能，通过计算激活能和特定活性值可以得到解释。
