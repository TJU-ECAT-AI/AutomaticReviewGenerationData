5.2 In Terms of Propane and Isobutane Dehydrogenation Performance
Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations. 

In Figure 31, the yields of propylene and isobutene are plotted versus the deactivation rate of Pt-, CrOx-, GaOx-, and In2O3-based catalysts. Moreover, in the plot showing PDH results, the data points representing the catalytic performance of different catalyst types are grouped around similar values, the best initial yields being similar for Pt and CrOx and slightly higher for GaOx. Additionally, PDH results show that the different catalyst types deactivate at different speeds, with Pt being particularly stable, CrOx deactivating rapidly, and other systems deactivating even faster. 

Space velocity is another important factor that has been considered to compare the performance of different dehydrogenation catalysts. In Figure 32 are plotted propylene and isobutene yield against the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). Taking into account that Pt-based catalysts typically have low loadings (<1 wt %), whereas GaOx- and CrOx-based catalysts generally have loadings between 5 and 20 wt %, it is clear that on a weight basis Pt represents the most active formulation in PDH. 

The differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods previously discussed in section 4. In these calculations, the energy barrier for the rate limiting step on PtSn system is lower (109 kJ mol1) than in the CrOx and GaOx catalysts (161 and 163 kJ mol1, respectively). 

To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts.

1. The methodology for comparing catalyst performance focuses on olefin yield, stability, and space velocity, aiming to reveal qualitative differences between catalyst formulations while addressing challenges in evaluating diverse catalysts. By excluding factors like pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support, the analysis provides insights into catalyst behavior under consistent conditions.

2. The implications of focusing on specific performance criteria indicate that Pt-based catalysts offer higher specific activity, lower deactivation rates, and can operate at higher space velocities compared to metal oxide catalysts. This suggests that Pt catalysts might be more suitable for practical applications due to their enhanced stability and efficiency.

3. The comparison of activation energies through DFT methods reveals that the Pt-based catalyst has a lower energy barrier for the rate-limiting step, which explains its higher activity. Despite the differences in specific activity values, metal oxide catalysts can still achieve comparable yields to Pt-based catalysts.

4. The summarized conclusion highlights that while metal oxide catalysts can match the yield of Pt catalysts, the latter demonstrate superior stability and can be operated at higher space velocities. This comparison underscores the importance of considering multiple factors in catalyst selection and the potential for further research to optimize catalyst performance.

1. 比较催化剂性能的方法集中在烯烃产率、稳定性和空速上，旨在揭示各种配方之间质的区别，同时解决评估不同催化剂挑战的问题。通过排除压力、温度、制备方法、促进剂和催化剂支持等因素的影响，分析提供了在一致条件下催化剂行为的见解。

2. 着重于特定性能指标的含义表明，基于铂的催化剂具有更高的特定活性、较低的失活率，并且可以操作在更高的空速下与金属氧化物催化剂相比。这表明，铂催化剂可能更适合实际应用，由于其增强的稳定性与效率。

3. 通过密度泛函理论（DFT）方法比较激活能显示，基于铂的催化剂的速率限制步骤的能量壁垒较低，解释了其更高的活性。尽管特定活动值存在差异，金属氧化物催化剂仍然能够达到与铂催化剂相当的产量。

4. 总结指出，虽然金属氧化物催化剂可以匹配铂催化剂的产量，但后者显示出优越的稳定性，并且可以在更高的空速下运行。这种比较强调了在催化剂选择时考虑多个因素的重要性，并且进一步研究优化催化剂性能的潜力。
