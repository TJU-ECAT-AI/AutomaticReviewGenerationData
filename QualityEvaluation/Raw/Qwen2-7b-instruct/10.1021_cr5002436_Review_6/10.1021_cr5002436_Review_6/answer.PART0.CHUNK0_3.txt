[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable."
[2] "The reasons to ignore these effects include the fact that this information is missing in many articles (pressure being a notable example), the absence of a clear trend (as tends to be the case with temperature), and an excessively large variance within a single variable to allow a meaningful comparison (catalyst preparation being an instance of such a variable)."
[3] "It is important to note that catalysts were only included in this comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined from the information provided in the original source."
[4] "Moreover, in the plot showing PDH results, the data points representing the catalytic performance of different catalyst types are grouped around similar values, the best initial yields being similar for Pt and CrOx and slightly higher for GaOx."
[5] "On a weight basis Pt represents the most active formulation in PDH."
[6] "However, it should be noted that specific activity values are a very rough approximation of the real TOF of these catalysts."

1. The methodology focuses on comparing the activity and stability of catalysts through specific performance criteria—olefin yield, stability, and space velocity—while excluding other factors like pressure, temperature, and catalyst preparation due to missing information, lack of clear trends, and high variability. This allows for a direct comparison of catalysts' performance under controlled conditions.

2. When considering the performance of different catalyst types in propane dehydrogenation, the data points cluster around similar values, indicating that Pt and CrOx have comparable initial yields, while GaOx shows slightly higher yields. 

3. Platinum-based catalysts stand out as the most active formulation in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on a weight basis.

4. The specific activity values calculated for catalysts represent a rough estimate of their true turnover frequency (TOF), with significant discrepancies between Pt and metal oxide catalysts.

1. 该方法侧重于通过特定性能指标（烯烃产率、稳定性、空速）来比较催化剂的活性和稳定性，同时排除了压力、温度和其他因素的影响。这些因素由于信息缺失、缺乏明确趋势以及单一变量内的高变异性而不利于进行有意义的比较。这种方法允许在控制条件下直接比较催化剂的性能。

2. 在丙烷脱氢反应中，不同催化剂类型的性能数据点围绕相似值分布，铂和CrOx具有相近的初始产率，而GaOx稍高。

3. 铂基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）中表现出最活跃的配方，从重量角度看。

4. 催化剂的特定活动值计算代表了其真实转速频率（TOF）的一个粗略估计，Pt和金属氧化物催化剂之间的差异非常大。
