5.2 In Terms of Propane and Isobutane Dehydrogenation Performance
Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations.
In Figure 31, the yields of propylene and isobutene are plotted versus the deactivation rate of Pt-, CrOx-, GaOx-, and In2O3-based catalysts.
Space velocity is another important factor that has been considered to compare the performance of different dehydrogenation catalysts.
Notably, the VOx-based catalysts show excellent yields (40%), albeit they deactivate very fast.
In Figure 32 are plotted propylene and isobutene yield against the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV).
Taking into account that Pt-based catalysts typically have low loadings (<1 wt %), whereas GaOx- and CrOx-based catalysts generally have loadings between 5 and 20 wt %, it is clear that on a weight basis Pt represents the most active formulation in PDH.
It is important to mention that catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used.
The differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods previously discussed in section 4.
To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts.

The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins addresses the challenges of evaluating diverse catalysts by focusing on specific performance criteria such as olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. By concentrating on these metrics, the comparison reveals qualitative differences between various catalyst formulations without the need to consider factors like pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support. These factors are often missing or lack clear trends in the available literature, leading to excessive variance that hinders meaningful comparisons. The performance criteria are measured specifically during propane or isobutane dehydrogenation, which have been researched extensively. This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of catalysts' efficiency and stability under standardized conditions, facilitating a fair comparison among different formulations.

比较C2-C4烷烃非氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的方法通过关注特定性能指标，如烯烃产率、稳定性以及空速，解决了评估不同催化剂挑战。通过聚焦这些指标，比较能够揭示各种催化剂配方之间的质性差异，而无需考虑压力、温度、制备方法、促进剂和催化剂支撑等变量。这些因素在可用文献中往往缺失或缺乏清晰的趋势，导致过度变异性，阻碍了有意义的比较。所使用的性能指标仅在丙烷或异丁烷脱氢期间进行测量，这是已经进行了深入研究的反应。这种方法允许在标准化条件下对催化剂效率和稳定性的全面评估，从而实现不同配方之间公平比较。
