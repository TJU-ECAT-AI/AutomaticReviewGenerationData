Answer: The methodology described in the document focuses on evaluating oil well productivity in low-permeability reservoirs in Eastern Siberia. It specifically addresses the challenge of comparing diverse catalyst performances in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly propane and isobutane reactions, by concentrating on specific performance criteria such as olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. By excluding other factors, the study aims to understand catalyst behavior and facilitate a comparative analysis that is more straightforward and efficient.
