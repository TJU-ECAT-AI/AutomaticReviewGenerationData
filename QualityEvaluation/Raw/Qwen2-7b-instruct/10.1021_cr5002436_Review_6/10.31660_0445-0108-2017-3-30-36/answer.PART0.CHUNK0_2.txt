The methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly propane and isobutane reactions, addresses the challenges of evaluating diverse catalysts by focusing on specific performance criteria such as olefin yield, stability, and space velocity. By concentrating on these factors, the method allows for a more straightforward comparative analysis of catalyst behavior. Excluding other factors helps streamline the evaluation process, enabling researchers to quickly identify catalysts with desirable properties for industrial application. This approach facilitates a clear understanding of catalyst performance and supports informed decision-making in the selection of the most suitable catalyst for specific reactions.
