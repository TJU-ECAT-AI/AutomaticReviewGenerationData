Answer: The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by participating in mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These processes involve the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the metal surface to the C-H bonds of the alkane molecule, leading to the formation of activated intermediates. The methyl-metal compounds (CH3-Me) formed during this process are crucial for the subsequent reactions. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride relies on these principles, where the activation of butane through the formation of methyl-metal intermediates enables the selective oxidation to maleic anhydride.

回答：孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中的催化作用通过参与如Mars van Krevelen和H-abstraction这样的过程来促进烷烃的活化。这些过程涉及从金属表面向烷烃分子的C-H键转移氢原子，从而形成活化的中间体。形成的甲基金属化合物（CH3-Me）对于后续反应至关重要。例如，丁烷转化为马来酸酐就是依赖于这些原理，其中通过形成甲基金属中间体活化丁烷，使选择性氧化成为可能，最终得到马来酸酐。
