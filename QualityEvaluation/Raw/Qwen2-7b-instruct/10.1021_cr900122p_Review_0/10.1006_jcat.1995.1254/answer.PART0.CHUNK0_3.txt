Ab initio quantum mechanical calculations were used to study the rate-determining step for methane activation on aluminum and lanthanum oxide surfaces. Transition states and products for the heterolytic chemisorption of methane were determined, showing a significant energy barrier of approximately 40 kcal/mol. This barrier supports the proposed heterolytic mechanism. Upon chemisorption, the carbon atom forms methyl-metal compounds, CH3-Me (where Me represents Al or La), with the carbon atom carrying a negative charge. To model the catalytic surfaces, the effects of the lattice were introduced using point charges and ab initio model potentials. The selectivity of these catalysts towards the formation of C2 compounds was discussed based on the stability differences of the methyl-metal intermediates.

通过从第一性原理量子力学计算，研究了甲烷在铝和镧氧化物表面的活性决定步骤。确定了甲烷异裂吸附的过渡态和产物，显示了一个约40 kcal/mol的能量壁垒。这支持了这一反应的推测异裂机制。吸附后，碳原子形成甲基金属化合物CH3-Me（Me代表Al或La），碳原子带有负电荷。为了模拟催化剂表面，引入了点电荷和从第一性原理模型势能中得到的效应来考虑晶格的影响。基于甲基金属中间体稳定性的差异，讨论了这些催化剂对C2化合物的选择性。
