1. Theoretical calculations were used to determine the rate-determining step for methane activation on aluminum and lanthanum oxide surfaces. Transition state structures were found to involve a four-center interaction with an energy barrier of approximately 40 kcal/mol, supporting a heterolytic mechanism for the reaction.
2. The products resulting from the reaction are methyl-metal compounds (CH3-Me, where Me is either Al or La), featuring a negatively charged carbon atom.
3. Models of catalytic surfaces were created by incorporating the lattice effects through point charges and ab initio model potentials. This allowed for the examination of the catalysts' selectivity toward ethylene production based on the relative stability of the methyl-metal intermediates.

1. 使用理论计算方法确定了甲烷在铝和镧氧化物表面的活化过程中的决定性步骤。过渡态结构显示为四个中心相互作用，具有约40 kcal/mol的能量壁垒，支持该反应的异裂机制。
2. 反应产物是甲基金属化合物（CH3-Me，其中Me是Al或La），碳原子带有负电荷。
3. 通过引入点电荷和基于第一原理模型势的晶格效应，构建了催化剂模型。这使得根据甲基金属中间体的相对稳定性来探讨催化剂对乙烯选择性的可能性成为可能。
