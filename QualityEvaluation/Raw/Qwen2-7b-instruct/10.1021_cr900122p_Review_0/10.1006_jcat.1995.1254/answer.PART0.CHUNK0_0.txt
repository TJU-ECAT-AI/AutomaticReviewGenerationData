[1] "A theoretical approach to the rate-determining step for methane activation on Al and La oxides has been performed by means of ab initio quantum mechanical calculations."
[2] "Transition states and products for the heterolytic chemisorption of CH4 on Al(OH)3 and La(OH)3 molecules have been determined at the RHF-SCF level of theory."
[3] "Transition-state structures correspond to a four-center interaction with an energy barrier of about 40 kcal/mol."
[4] "This high activation barrier supports the heterolytic mechanism proposed for this reaction."
[5] "The products are methyl-metal compounds, CH3-Me (Me = Al, La), with the carbon atom negatively charged."
[6] "Catalytic surfaces have been modeled by introducing the effects due to the lattice through both point charges and ab initio model potentials."
[7] "The selectivity of these catalysts towards C2 is discussed on the grounds of the differences found for the relative stability of the methyl-metal intermediates."

1. An ab initio quantum mechanical calculation was used to determine the rate-determining step for methane activation on aluminum and lanthanum oxide surfaces.
2. Transition states and products for the heterolytic chemisorption of methane were identified on aluminum hydroxide and lanthanum hydroxide molecules.
3. These transition states involve a four-center interaction with an energy barrier estimated at approximately 40 kcal/mol.
4. The high activation barrier indicates support for the heterolytic mechanism proposed for this reaction.
5. The products resulting from this process are methyl-metal compounds, specifically CH3-Al and CH3-La, where the carbon atom carries a negative charge.
6. Catalytic surfaces were simulated by incorporating the impact of the lattice structure using both point charges and ab initio model potentials.
7. The selectivity of these catalysts for producing C2 compounds is analyzed based on the comparative stability of the intermediate methyl-metal species.
