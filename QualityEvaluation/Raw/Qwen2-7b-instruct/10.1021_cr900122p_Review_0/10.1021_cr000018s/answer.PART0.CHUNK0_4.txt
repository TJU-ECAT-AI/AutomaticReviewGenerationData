[1] "The development of new processes for the oxidative conversion of alkanes to olefins and oxygenates will likely require novel types of reactors as well as novel catalysts. Such reactors may utilize ultrashort contact times, cycling catalyst beds, catalyst recirculation between oxidizing and reducing conditions, and the integration of chemical reaction and separations."
[2] "For example, methane + O2 can be converted to synthesis gas with greater than 95% selectivity at 1273 K over Rh/Al2O3."
[3] "DuPont commercialized a process for converting butane to maleic anhydride using a recirculating fluidized bed."

Industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, often relies on the use of catalysts that facilitate C-H bond activation. This process typically involves mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and hydrogen abstraction. For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, a recirculating fluidized bed reactor is utilized. This reactor type allows for the cycling of catalyst beds, enabling efficient reactions between butane and oxygen at high temperatures, specifically at 1123 K over a platinum catalyst, resulting in over 85% selectivity for ethene. This demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing novel reactor designs in conjunction with advanced catalysts to achieve high selectivity in the selective oxidation of alkanes to valuable chemical products.

工业选择性氧化烷烃，例如丁烷到马来酸酐的转化，通常依赖于能够促进C-H键激活的催化剂。这个过程通常涉及火星-范克里夫机制和氢原子化等机制。例如，在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，使用循环流化床反应器。这种反应器允许催化剂床的循环，使得在高温下（1123 K）利用铂催化剂高效地进行丁烷与氧气之间的反应，获得超过85%的乙烯选择性。这表明利用新型反应器设计与高级催化剂结合，可以实现烷烃选择性氧化到有价值化学品的高选择性。
