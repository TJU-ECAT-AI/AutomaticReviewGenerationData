Scheme 15. Oxidative Coupling Reactions Involving CO2
Scheme 16. Proposed Pathway for Reduction of CO2 to HOCH2CO2H
Scheme 17. Mechanism for the Insertion of CO2 into a MetalHydrogen Bond
Scheme 18. Proposed Mechanism for the Pd- Mediated Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to CO
Factors controlling regio- and stereoselectivity of metal-centered CO2 transformations are also ill-defined.
Regarding heterogeneous CO2 hydrogenation catalysis, the principal barriers are poor product selectivity and unacceptably high reaction temperatures.

The mechanisms involved in C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, butane is oxidized over a catalyst to produce maleic anhydride, demonstrating the effective use of metal centers on oxide materials for C-H bond activation.
