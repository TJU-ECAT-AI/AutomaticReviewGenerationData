[1] "Factors controlling regio- and stereoselectivity of metal-centered CO2 transformations are also ill-defined. These may be important in polymer synthesis using propylene oxide and related monomers in analogy to propene polymerization."
[2] "Formation of CC bonds between olefins + CO2 and alkynes + CO2 appears to involve initial alkene or alkyne coordination followed by CO2 attack at an activated carbon atom."
[3] "During CO2 electrochemical reduction to CO mediated by Pd catalysts, a vacant coordination site facilitates the CO bond cleavage."
[4] "Formation of MC(O)OM linkages or one-electron MCOOH reduction appears to facilitate CO bond cleavage."
[5] "In many instances, CO2 binding occurs via bonds to both the CO2 carbon and oxygen atoms. The role of such cooperative interactions is not well understood, and systematic studies should be informative."
[6] "Direct photochemical reactions of CO2 complexes are rare and offer the possibility of coupling CO2 reduction to O atom transfer; such reactions have yet to be demonstrated."
[7] "Understanding the binary and ternary phase behavior of CO2substratereactant systems is needed to conduct reactions under the most favorable temperature and pressure conditions."

The role of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in facilitating C-H bond activation involves mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These processes are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this specific example, the metal center coordinates with the alkane, allowing for the breaking of a C-H bond and the formation of a new C-C bond, leading to the production of maleic anhydride. This selective oxidation relies on the precise control of reaction conditions and the nature of the metal center to ensure that the desired product is formed.

孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上的作用通过Mars van Krevelen和H抽象机制促进C-H键活化。这些过程在工业选择性氧化烷烃中得到应用，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。在这种特定的例子中，金属中心与烷烃配合，允许C-H键断裂并形成新的C-C键，从而产生马来酸酐。这种选择性氧化依赖于对反应条件和金属中心性质的精确控制，以确保形成所需的产品。
