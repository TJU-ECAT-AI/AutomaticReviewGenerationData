[1] "The dissociative chemisorption of CO2 on metal surfaces plays a crucial role in the activation of carbon dioxide for subsequent chemical transformations. This process involves the breaking of the CO2 molecule's bonds, which is facilitated by the presence of isolated metal centers on oxide materials."

[2] "Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is one of the primary pathways for the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. This mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the substrate by a reactive species, typically a metal center. This abstraction leads to the formation of a carbocation, which can then undergo further reactions."

[3] "In the context of the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the activation of the C-H bonds in butane requires the presence of a suitable catalyst. The use of a metal center, such as platinum or palladium, can facilitate this process by acting as an active site for the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the butane molecules. This leads to the formation of alkyl radicals, which can then undergo sequential reactions to form maleic anhydride."

[4] "Selective oxidation of alkanes often involves the use of transition metal catalysts, such as platinum or palladium, which can selectively activate the C-H bonds in the alkane substrates. These catalysts are typically supported on oxide materials to provide a stable and active surface for the reaction. The mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen atoms by the metal center, leading to the formation of alkyl radicals, which can then react with oxygen to produce aldehydes or ketones."
