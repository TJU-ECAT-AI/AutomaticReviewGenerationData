Isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in C-H bond activation, primarily through two mechanisms: the Mars-van Krevelen process and H-abstraction. In the Mars-van Krevelen process, a metal center donates a proton to an oxygen atom, creating a surface hydroperoxide intermediate. H-abstraction involves a metal center extracting a hydrogen atom from a substrate, typically resulting in the formation of a carbocation intermediate. These principles are utilized in industrial applications, particularly in the selective oxidation of alkanes. For instance, they are applied in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

孤立的金属中心在氧化材料上能够通过Mars-van Krevelen过程和H抽象机制促进C-H键活化。在Mars-van Krevelen过程中，金属中心将质子捐赠给氧原子，形成表面过氧化氢中间体。H抽象涉及金属中心从基质中抽取氢原子，通常导致形成碳正离子中间体。这些原理应用于工业选择性氧化反应中，特别是烷烃的氧化。例如，在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中应用了这些原理。
