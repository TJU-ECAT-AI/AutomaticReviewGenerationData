[1] "The development of new processes for the oxidative conversion of alkanes to valuable chemical products without large quantities of unwanted byproducts such as CO2 will likely require novel types of reactors as well as novel catalysts."
[2] "There are several motivations for producing chemicals from CO2 whenever possible. (1) CO2 is a cheap, nontoxic feedstock that can frequently replace toxic chemicals such as phosgene or isocyanates. (2) CO2 is a totally renewable feedstock compared to oil or coal."

1. The creation of chemical processes that efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts like CO2 will likely necessitate innovative reactor designs alongside new catalysts. 

2. Several reasons support the production of chemicals from CO2. Firstly, CO2 acts as a cost-effective, non-toxic raw material that can replace hazardous chemicals such as phosgene or isocyanates. Secondly, CO2 is a sustainable feedstock compared to fossil fuels like oil or coal.
