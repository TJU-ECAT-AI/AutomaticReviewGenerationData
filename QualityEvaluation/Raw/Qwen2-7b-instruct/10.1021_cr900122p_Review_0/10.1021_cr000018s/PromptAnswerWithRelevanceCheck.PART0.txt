Scheme 15. Oxidative coupling reactions involving CO2

Scheme 16. Proposed pathway for reduction of CO2 to HOCH2CO2H

Scheme 17. Mechanism for the insertion of CO2 into a MetalHydrogen bond

Factors controlling regio- and stereoselectivity of metal-centered CO2 transformations are also ill-defined. These may be important in polymer synthesis using propylene oxide and related monomers in analogy to propene polymerization. Likewise, chain transfer reagents to control polymer molecular weights are also needed. Catalysts with higher turnover frequencies than currently available are needed. Finally, extension of successes in polycarbonate synthesis to polyesters from olefins and CO2 is an attractive goal.

Regarding heterogeneous CO2 hydrogenation catalysis, the principal barriers are poor product selectivity and unacceptably high reaction temperatures. Thus, in ethanol production by CO2 hydrogenation, ethanol is generally one component of a mixture of alcohols and hydrocarbons, and more selective catalysts are needed. Catalysts capable of operating at lower reaction temperatures for hydrogenating CO2 to methanol are also needed. Current catalysts operate at 250 C and the thermodynamics for CO2 to methanol conversion are entropically unfavorable (and enthalpically favorable). At lower temperatures, the equilibrium concentration of methanol is higher, which would lead to higher conversion per pass and more efficient operation. Homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts typically catalyze the reduction of CO2 to formate-based products. Catalysts capable of reductions beyond the formate level are desirable for more useful products.

Electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction would permit the conversion of electrical energy to fuels in a single step, but many barriers exist. Heterogeneous electrocatalysts are needed that operate at lower overpotentials with higher selectivity. Although Cu electrodes catalyze CO2 reduction to methane, comparable catalysts for producing methanol are unknown. Methanol production has been reported at Mo electrodes but selectivity and current densities are very low, typically less than 40% and 1 ma/cm2, respectively.194 Similarly, homogeneous catalysts possessing all of the desired properties for CO2 reduction are not known. Fast, selective, and energy-efficient homogeneous electrocatalysts are known for reducing CO2 to CO but are unstable. Other catalysts operate at unacceptably large overpotentials, require Hg electrodes, or have low catalytic rates. Additionally, rapid and efficient homogeneous catalysts for catalyzing CO2 reduction by more than two electrons are unknown. Better understanding is needed of the requirements for reducing CO2 beyond formate and CO in either a single or sequential steps.

Photochemical processes offer an attractive approach to CO2 reduction using sunlight. However, significant obstacles exist such as the requirement of expensive sacrificial reagents, rather than water, to quench the sensitizer and to provide the thermodynamic driving force for CO2 reduction. Also, sensitizers more completely using the solar spectrum are desired. Direct photochemical reactions of CO2 complexes are rare and offer the possibility of coupling CO2 reduction to O atom transfer; such reactions have yet to be demonstrated.

Regarding supercritical CO2 utilization, understanding the binary and ternary phase behavior of CO2substratereactant systems is needed to conduct reactions under the most favorable temperature and pressure conditions (i.e., to generate the number of phases and phase compositions desired). Most catalytic reactions studied to date have not utilized catalysts specifically designed to operate in supercritical CO2. This led to solubility problems and use of catalysts not capitalizing on the properties of supercritical CO2.

The document discusses the challenges and opportunities in catalysis research related to carbon management, including:

1. **Metal centers on oxide materials** facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. These processes are applied industrially in selective oxidation reactions, such as converting butane to maleic anhydride. The Mars-van Krevelen pathway involves the abstraction of hydrogen by a metal center, followed by a rearrangement to form a new functional group. H-abstraction refers to the removal of a hydrogen atom by a reactive species, often leading to bond formation or cleavage.

2. **Regio- and stereoselectivity in CO2 transformations** are not well-defined, posing challenges in polymer synthesis. The document suggests that improvements in catalysts could lead to better control over polymer molecular weights and selectivity in reactions like the conversion of olefins and CO2 to polyesters.

3. **Heterogeneous CO2 hydrogenation** faces barriers such as poor product selectivity and high reaction temperatures. Lower temperature catalysts are needed for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, as current catalysts at 250°C have thermodynamics that favor enthalpic rather than entropic effects, leading to inefficient production of methanol.

4. **Electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction** requires catalysts that can operate at lower overpotentials with higher selectivity. The document highlights the need for catalysts capable of CO2 reduction beyond formate and CO, and discusses the limitations of current catalysts, including instability and the requirement for high overpotentials or specific electrode materials.

5. **Photochemical CO2 reduction** faces challenges including the need for more efficient light harvesting and catalysts that can fully utilize the solar spectrum. The document mentions the potential for coupling CO2 reduction to O atom transfer but notes that such direct photochemical reactions are rare.

6. **Utilization of supercritical CO2** requires a better understanding of phase behavior to optimize reaction conditions. The document suggests that catalysts specifically designed for supercritical CO2 could improve solubility and exploit the unique properties of this medium for more efficient catalytic reactions.

The document emphasizes the importance of fundamental research in understanding catalytic mechanisms, improving catalyst efficiency, and developing new catalyst designs to address the challenges in carbon management and the conversion of CO2 to fuels and chemicals.

文档讨论了与碳管理相关的催化研究的挑战和机遇，包括：

1. **氧化物材料上的金属中心**通过Mars-van Krevelen途径和H抽象机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。这些过程在工业中应用于选择性氧化反应，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。Mars-van Krevelen途径涉及金属中心对氢原子的抽象，随后进行重排以形成新的功能团。H抽象指的是由活性物种去除氢原子的过程，通常导致键的形成或断裂。

2. **CO2转化的区域性和立体选择性**定义不够明确，对聚合物合成提出了挑战。文档建议改进催化剂可以提高对聚合物分子量控制和反应如烯烃和CO2到聚酯转化时的选择性。

3. **异相CO2氢化**面临低产品选择性和高反应温度的障碍。需要在较低温度下操作的催化剂用于CO2氢化生成甲醇，因为当前在250°C的催化剂有利于焓而非熵的影响，导致甲醇生产效率低下。

4. **电催化CO2还原**需要能够以较低过电位和更高选择性的催化剂。文档强调了需要能够CO2还原到超过形式酸和CO的催化剂，并讨论了当前催化剂的局限性，包括稳定性问题、高过电位需求或特定电极材料的需求。

5. **光化学CO2还原**面临的挑战包括更高效地捕获光能和催化剂完全利用太阳光谱的能力。文档提到直接光化学反应的可能性，但指出此类反应罕见。

6. **超临界CO2的利用**需要更好地理解相行为来优化反应条件。文档建议设计专门针对超临界CO2的催化剂可以改善溶解度并充分利用这种介质的独特性质进行更高效的催化反应。

文档强调了理解催化机制的基础研究的重要性，提高催化剂效率，并开发新的催化剂设计以应对碳管理以及CO2转化为燃料和化学品的挑战。

The simplest reactions involving carbon dioxide involve its insertion into an XH bond, forming compounds like carbamic acids that can be converted into organic carbamates. More recent examples include inserting carbon dioxide into PN bonds of P(NR2)3 compounds to form P(NR2)(OCONR2)2 compounds, and reacting ammonium carbamates (derived from carbon dioxide) with alkyl halides in the presence of crown ethers to form useful urethane intermediates. This demonstrates the use of carbon dioxide to replace phosgene, a highly toxic intermediate in chemical synthesis. An intriguing example is the insertion of carbon dioxide into alkanes like methane to form acetic acid. Despite low turnover numbers for this catalytic process, the simultaneous activation of a CH bond and carbon dioxide insertion is a fascinating aspect.
