[1] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example of the application of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "These metal centers enable the activation of C-H bonds in butane through mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen pathway and hydrogen abstraction."
[3] "In the Mars-van Krevelen pathway, a metal center acts as a Lewis acid, coordinating with a water molecule to create a surface-bound hydride ion which abstracts a hydrogen atom from butane."
[4] "This process leads to the formation of alkyl radicals that can further react with oxygen molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface to produce maleic anhydride."
[5] "The ability of isolated metal centers on oxide materials to activate C-H bonds and promote the selective oxidation of alkanes is critical for the industrial production of valuable chemicals."
