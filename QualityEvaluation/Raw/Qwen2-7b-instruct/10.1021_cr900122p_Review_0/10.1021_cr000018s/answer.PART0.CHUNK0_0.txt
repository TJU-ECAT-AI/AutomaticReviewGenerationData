[1] "There are several motivations for producing chemicals from CO2 whenever possible. (1) CO2 is a cheap, nontoxic feedstock that can frequently replace toxic chemicals such as phosgene or isocyanates. (2) CO2 is a totally renewable feedstock compared to oil or coal."
[2] "There are a number of recent reviews and books on various aspects of CO2 utilization.124 The objective here is to provide a brief review of research progress in the field, to identify barriers to further progress, and to suggest possible avenues for future research."
[3] "The simplest reactions of CO2 are those in which it is simply inserted into an XH bond."
[4] "Examples are the insertion of CO2 into organic amines to afford carbamic acids which may be converted into organic carbamates.127,128"
[5] "Carbonates, (RO)2CO (8), can also be prepared by inserting CO2 into OH bonds followed by dehydration or by oxidative carboxylation of olefins.132 This synthetic approach has the possibility of providing a new route to compounds that have very large potential markets."
[6] "Equations 27-34 show CO2 reduction reactions in which energy in the form of electricity or hydrogen, derived from nuclear or renewable resources, is stored as either liquid or gaseous carbon-based fuels (ΔE and ΔG values are for 298 K)."
[7] "In the electrochemical reactions, CO2 is reduced at the cathode and O2 is produced at the anode."
[8] "The hydrogenation of CO2 to methane and higher hydrocarbons is also known."
[9] "Pioneering work has been carried out by Noyori et al.124,156 on the catalytic synthesis of formic acid derivatives by CO2 hydrogenation, together with other substrates, in supercritical CO2."
[10] "Under the appropriate conditions, very high turnover numbers and rates can be achieved. For example, Leitner et al. examined complexes of the general type [R2P(X)PR2]Rh(hfacac) (X = bridging group; hfacac = 1,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)-acetonylacetonate).158"
