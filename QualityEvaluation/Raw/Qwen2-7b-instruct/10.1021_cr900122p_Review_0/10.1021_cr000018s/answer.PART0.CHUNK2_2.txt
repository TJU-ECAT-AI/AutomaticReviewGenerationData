[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can play a crucial role in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in the activation of C-H bonds."
[2] "The mechanism of C-H bond activation often involves the Mars van Krevelen process or hydrogen abstraction."
[3] "In the context of industrial selective oxidation, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, these principles are applied effectively."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
C-H bond activation through isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitates various chemical transformations, including the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. The Mars van Krevelen process and hydrogen abstraction are key mechanisms involved in this activation. In industrial applications, such as converting butane to maleic anhydride, these catalytic processes enable efficient and selective reactions.

孤立的金属中心在氧化材料上的作用对于异相催化至关重要，尤其是在C-H键活化中。C-H键活化通常涉及Mars van Krevelen过程或氢抽象。在工业选择性氧化应用中，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，这些催化原理能够有效实现并选择性地执行反应。
