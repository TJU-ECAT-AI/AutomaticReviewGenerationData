[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in heterogeneous catalysis due to their ability to activate carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds."
[2] "The activation process often involves mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and hydrogen abstraction."
[3] "In the context of selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to convert butane into maleic anhydride."
[4] "For instance, butane can undergo oxidative cleavage under the influence of an appropriate catalyst, leading to the formation of maleic anhydride."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Answer: Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars-van Krevelen and hydrogen abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as converting butane into maleic anhydride, by enabling oxidative cleavage under the right catalyst conditions.

答案：孤立在氧化物材料上的金属中心通过Mars-van Krevelen机制和氢摘取等机制，在异相催化中促进了C-H键的活化。这些原理在工业上应用于烷烃的选择性氧化，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，通过在合适的催化剂条件下实现氧化裂解。
