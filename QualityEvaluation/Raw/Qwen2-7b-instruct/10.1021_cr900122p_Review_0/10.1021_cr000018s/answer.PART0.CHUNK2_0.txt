[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in facilitating C-H bond activation."
[2] "These isolated metal centers can activate C-H bonds through various mechanisms, including the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and hydrogen abstraction."
[3] "In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the metal center acts as a base, abstracting a hydrogen atom from the alkane molecule, which then leads to the formation of a carbocation."
[4] "Hydrogen abstraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon molecule, which results in the formation of a radical."
[5] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example of how these principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation processes."
[6] "In this process, butane undergoes oxidative cleavage to yield maleic anhydride, demonstrating the effectiveness of metal-catalyzed reactions in industrial applications."

孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上对异相催化起着关键作用，特别是促进C-H键活化。这些机制包括Mars-van Krevelen机制和氢原子抽取。在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，金属中心作为碱基，从烷烃分子中抽取氢原子，从而形成碳阳离子。氢原子抽取涉及从碳氢化合物分子中去除一个氢原子，导致形成自由基。这些原则应用于工业选择性氧化过程，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，展示了它们在工业应用中的有效性。
