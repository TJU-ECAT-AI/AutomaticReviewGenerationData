[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can activate C-H bonds through various mechanisms, including the Mars van Krevelen pathway and hydrogen abstraction."
[2] "The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of a proton from the metal center to the C-H bond, leading to the formation of a carbocation."
[3] "Hydrogen abstraction occurs when a hydrogen atom from the metal center is transferred to the C-H bond, leading to the formation of a radical."
[4] "These processes are crucial in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly for the selective oxidation of alkanes."
[5] "For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride involves the activation of the C-H bonds in butane through the use of an isolated metal center catalyst on an oxide material."
[6] "The selectivity of the process is achieved by controlling the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the metal center."

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars van Krevelen pathway and hydrogen abstraction. These mechanisms involve the transfer of a proton from the metal center to the C-H bond, forming a carbocation, or the transfer of a hydrogen atom, forming a radical. They are essential for selective oxidation reactions, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

2.In the case of converting butane to maleic anhydride, the C-H bonds in butane are activated through the use of an isolated metal center catalyst on an oxide material. The selectivity of the conversion process is achieved by adjusting factors like temperature, pressure, and the characteristics of the metal center.

1.孤立于氧化物材料上的金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen途径和氢原子抽取机制促进C-H键的活化。这些机制包括金属中心向C-H键转移一个质子形成碳正离子，或者金属中心向C-H键转移一个氢原子形成自由基。这些过程对于异相催化中的选择性烷烃氧化至关重要。

2.在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，通过使用孤立在氧化物材料上的金属中心催化剂来活化丁烷中的C-H键。通过调整温度、压力以及金属中心的特性等参数，可以实现转化过程的选择性。
