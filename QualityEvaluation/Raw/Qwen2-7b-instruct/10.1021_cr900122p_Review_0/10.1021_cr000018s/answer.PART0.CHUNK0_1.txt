[1] "In the case of butane conversion to maleic anhydride, the catalyst formulation was found to be critical."
[2] "The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio."
[3] "Near-edge analysis of X-ray absorption spectra taken during butane oxidation suggest that the high selectivity to maleic anhydride observed when P/V = 2 is associated with the stabilization of a high proportion of the V in the 4+ oxidation state."

The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride in heterogeneous catalysis relies heavily on the properties of the catalyst. The selectivity towards maleic anhydride improves consistently with the phosphorus to vanadium (P/V) ratio. This is due to the stabilization of a significant portion of the vanadium in the +4 oxidation state, as determined by near-edge X-ray absorption analysis. This state is crucial for the high selectivity observed in the maleic anhydride formation.

在异相催化中，正丁烷转化为马来酸酐的转化依赖于催化剂的特性。选择性提高与磷/钒（P/V）比成正比。这是由于在P/V=2时，稳定了大量钒的+4氧化态所导致的，通过近边X射线吸收分析可以确定这一点。这种状态对于观察到的高选择性马来酸酐形成至关重要。

[1] "The key points with respect to research needs, challenges, and opportunities emphasized in this section are as follows:"
[2] "There is considerable room for improvement in the most widely used commercial approach, steam methane reforming, especially at higher pressures."
[3] "However, more research is critical with respect to alternative technologies, especially those that do not utilize fossil fuels."
[4] "In the near term, methane (natural gas) is an attractive source of H2."
[5] "In the long term, photocatalysis with sunlight or photoelectrolysis offer nonfossil fuel routes to H2."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The main emphasis in this section pertains to the research requirements, challenges, and opportunities. There is ample scope for enhancement in the prevalent commercial steam methane reforming process, particularly at elevated pressures. It is imperative that more investigation is conducted on alternative methodologies, especially those that abstain from relying on fossil fuels. In the immediate timeframe, natural gas (methane) stands as an appealing hydrogen source. For the distant future, the utilization of sunlight or photoelectrolysis for photocatalysis presents non-fossil fuel pathways to hydrogen production.

本节强调的关键点包括研究需求、挑战和机遇。在使用最广泛的商业蒸汽甲烷重整过程方面，特别是在高压下，存在改进的空间。对替代技术进行更多研究是至关重要的，尤其是那些不依赖化石燃料的方法。在短期内，天然气（甲烷）作为氢源具有吸引力。从长远来看，利用阳光或光电解进行光催化提供了非化石燃料途径来生产氢气。
