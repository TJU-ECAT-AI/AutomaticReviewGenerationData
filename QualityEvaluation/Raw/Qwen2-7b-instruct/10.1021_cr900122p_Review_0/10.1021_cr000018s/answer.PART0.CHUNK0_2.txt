[1] "The development of new routes to large-scale commodity chemicals that reduce investment and give higher yields is required."
[2] "An example is the production of methyl methacrylate (MMA). MMA is currently prepared from isobutylene via two high-temperature gas-phase oxidations followed by esterification (eq 25)."
[3] "These high-temperature conditions result in low yield and carbon dioxide production."
[4] "Asahi Chemical is in the process of building a new plant118 based on the oxidative esterification of methacrolein directly to MMA."

The production of methyl methacrylate (MMA) is currently achieved through two high-temperature gas-phase oxidations followed by esterification. This process leads to low yields and carbon dioxide production. Asahi Chemical is developing a new plant that will use the oxidative esterification of methacrolein directly to MMA. This process is carried out in a slurry phase under mild conditions, eliminating one process step and resulting in higher overall yields with lower investment.

[1] "The simplest reactions of CO2 are those in which it is simply inserted into an XH bond."
[2] "Examples are the insertion of CO2 into organic amines to afford carbamic acids which may be converted into organic carbamates."
[3] "More recent examples include the insertion of CO2 in PN bonds of P(NR2)3 compounds to form P(NR2)(OCONR2)2 compounds and the reaction of ammonium carbamates (derived from CO2) with alkyl halides in the presence of crown ethers to form useful urethane intermediates (5)."
[4] "This is an example of using CO2 to replace phosgene, a highly toxic intermediate in chemical synthesis."
[5] "Another interesting reaction is the insertion of CO2 into alkanes such as methane to form acetic acid (7)."
[6] "Although the turnover numbers for this catalytic process are low, the simultaneous activation of a CH bond and CO2 insertion is intriguing."

The simplest reactions involving carbon dioxide involve its insertion into an XH bond, forming compounds like carbamic acids that can be converted into organic carbamates. More recent examples include inserting carbon dioxide into PN bonds of P(NR2)3 compounds to form P(NR2)(OCONR2)2 compounds, and reacting ammonium carbamates (derived from carbon dioxide) with alkyl halides in the presence of crown ethers to form useful urethane intermediates. This demonstrates the use of carbon dioxide to replace phosgene, a highly toxic intermediate in chemical synthesis. An intriguing example is the insertion of carbon dioxide into alkanes like methane to form acetic acid. Despite low turnover numbers for this catalytic process, the simultaneous activation of a CH bond and carbon dioxide insertion is a fascinating aspect.

碳二酸最简单的反应涉及其插入到XH键中，形成如碳酰胺酸这样的化合物，这些化合物可以转化为有机碳酰胺酸。更近期的例子包括将二氧化碳插入P(NR2)3化合物的PN键中形成P(NR2)(OCONR2)2化合物，以及在冠醚的存在下，将来源于二氧化碳的氨甲酸盐与烷基卤化物反应形成有用的尿素中间体。这展示了二氧化碳取代毒性极高的磷光体作为化学合成中间体的可能性。另一个有趣的例子是将二氧化碳插入甲烷等烷烃中形成乙酸。尽管这个催化过程的周转数较低，同时激活CH键和二氧化碳插入是一个令人着迷的特点。
