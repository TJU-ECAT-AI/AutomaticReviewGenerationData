The process of metal-centered CO2 activation involves coordination of olefins or alkynes followed by CO2 attack at an activated carbon atom. This leads to formation of CC bonds. The CO bond cleavage during CO2 reduction is facilitated by a vacant coordination site on the metal catalyst, such as palladium. In the most effective systems, the quantum yield for all reduced products is around 40%. The turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- typically range from 1 to 10 hours^-1, with turnover numbers usually being 100 or less.

金属中心化的CO2活化过程涉及烯烃或炔烃的配位，随后是CO2在活性碳原子上的攻击，从而形成CC键。CO2的CO键断裂被金属催化剂（如钯）上的空配位位点所促进。在效率最高的系统中，所有还原产物的量子产率约为40%。CO或HCOO-的周转频率通常在每小时1到10次之间，周转数通常为100或更少。
