[1] "The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves the use of an isolated metal center on the surface of an oxide material."
[2] "Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction play significant roles in the process of C-H bond activation."
[3] "Selective oxidation of alkanes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, is facilitated by the application of these principles."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
C-H bond activation is facilitated by isolated metal centers on oxide materials. Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction are key mechanisms involved in this process. These principles are applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as converting butane to maleic anhydride.
