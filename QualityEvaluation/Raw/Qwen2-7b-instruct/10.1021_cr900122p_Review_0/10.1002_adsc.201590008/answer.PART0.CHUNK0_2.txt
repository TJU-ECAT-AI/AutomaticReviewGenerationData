The isolation of metal centers on oxide materials facilitates C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction pathways. These processes allow for the selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this industrial application, the metal center on the oxide material acts as a catalyst, enabling the selective activation of the C-H bond and subsequent oxidation. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of electrons from the metal center to the C-H bond, followed by the abstraction of hydrogen by a reactive species. The H-abstraction pathway involves the direct removal of hydrogen from the C-H bond, typically facilitated by a metal-bound hydrogen atom or a species capable of abstracting hydrogen. These mechanisms are crucial for achieving high selectivity and efficiency in the conversion of hydrocarbons to useful products, such as maleic anhydride in this case.

孤立于氧化材料上的金属中心在异质催化中通过火星范克列文恩和氢提取途径促进了C-H键的激活。这些过程允许烷烃的选择性氧化，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例。在这个工业应用中，氧化材料上的金属中心作为催化剂，使C-H键的选择性活化和随后的氧化成为可能。火星范克列文恩机制涉及从金属中心向C-H键转移电子，随后由反应性物种提取氢。氢提取途径涉及直接从C-H键去除氢，通常由金属结合的氢原子或能够提取氢的物种促进。这些机制对于实现高选择性和效率的碳氢化合物转化为有用产品至关重要，例如本例中的马来酸酐。
