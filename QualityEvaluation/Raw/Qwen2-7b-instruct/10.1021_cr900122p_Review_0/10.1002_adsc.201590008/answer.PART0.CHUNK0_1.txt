The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of a hydrogen atom from a surface-bound species to a molecule adsorbed on the catalyst surface, followed by the desorption of the resulting product. H-abstraction typically involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by a reactive species present on the catalyst surface. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation processes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this specific example, butane molecules interact with the metal oxide catalyst, leading to the activation of C-H bonds and subsequent conversion into maleic anhydride through a series of catalytic steps involving both Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms.

孤立的金属中心在异相催化中通过Mars van Krevelen和H抽象机制促进C-H键活化。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及表面结合物种向吸附在催化剂表面上的分子转移氢原子，随后是产物的脱附。H抽象通常涉及催化剂表面上存在的活性物种从基质中去除一个氢原子。这些原则在工业选择性氧化过程中得到应用，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。在这种具体例子中，丁烷分子与金属氧化物催化剂相互作用，导致C-H键的激活，并通过一系列催化步骤转化为马来酸酐，涉及Mars van Krevelen和H抽象机制。
