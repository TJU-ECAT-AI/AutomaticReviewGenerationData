The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, a metal center acts as a base, abstracting a proton from the C-H bond. This results in the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which then undergoes further reactions. The H-abstraction mechanism involves a metal center abstracting a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond, creating a carbon radical that can react further. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation processes, such as converting butane to maleic anhydride. In this specific example, the C-H bond in butane is selectively activated and oxidized over the metal center on the oxide material catalyst, leading to the formation of maleic anhydride as the product.

孤立的金属中心在异质催化中通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H摘取机制促进C-H键活化。在Mars van Krevelen机制中，金属中心作为碱基，从C-H键摘取一个质子。这导致形成碳正离子中间体，然后进一步反应。H摘取机制涉及金属中心从C-H键摘取氢原子，形成碳自由基，它可以进一步反应。这些原则在工业选择性氧化过程中得到应用，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。在这个具体的例子中，丁烷中的C-H键在氧化物材料催化剂上的金属中心选择性激活并氧化，导致形成马来酸酐作为产物。

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of a hydrogen atom from a surface-bound species to a molecule adsorbed on the catalyst surface, followed by the desorption of the resulting product. H-abstraction typically involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by a reactive species present on the catalyst surface. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation processes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this specific example, butane molecules interact with the metal oxide catalyst, leading to the activation of C-H bonds and subsequent conversion into maleic anhydride through a series of catalytic steps involving both Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms.

孤立的金属中心在异相催化中通过Mars van Krevelen和H抽象机制促进C-H键活化。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及表面结合物种向吸附在催化剂表面上的分子转移氢原子，随后是产物的脱附。H抽象通常涉及催化剂表面上存在的活性物种从基质中去除一个氢原子。这些原则在工业选择性氧化过程中得到应用，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。在这种具体例子中，丁烷分子与金属氧化物催化剂相互作用，导致C-H键的激活，并通过一系列催化步骤转化为马来酸酐，涉及Mars van Krevelen和H抽象机制。

The isolation of metal centers on oxide materials facilitates C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction pathways. These processes allow for the selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this industrial application, the metal center on the oxide material acts as a catalyst, enabling the selective activation of the C-H bond and subsequent oxidation. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of electrons from the metal center to the C-H bond, followed by the abstraction of hydrogen by a reactive species. The H-abstraction pathway involves the direct removal of hydrogen from the C-H bond, typically facilitated by a metal-bound hydrogen atom or a species capable of abstracting hydrogen. These mechanisms are crucial for achieving high selectivity and efficiency in the conversion of hydrocarbons to useful products, such as maleic anhydride in this case.
