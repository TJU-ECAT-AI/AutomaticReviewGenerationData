The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, a metal center acts as a base, abstracting a proton from the C-H bond. This results in the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which then undergoes further reactions. The H-abstraction mechanism involves a metal center abstracting a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond, creating a carbon radical that can react further. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation processes, such as converting butane to maleic anhydride. In this specific example, the C-H bond in butane is selectively activated and oxidized over the metal center on the oxide material catalyst, leading to the formation of maleic anhydride as the product.

孤立的金属中心在异质催化中通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H摘取机制促进C-H键活化。在Mars van Krevelen机制中，金属中心作为碱基，从C-H键摘取一个质子。这导致形成碳正离子中间体，然后进一步反应。H摘取机制涉及金属中心从C-H键摘取氢原子，形成碳自由基，它可以进一步反应。这些原则在工业选择性氧化过程中得到应用，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。在这个具体的例子中，丁烷中的C-H键在氧化物材料催化剂上的金属中心选择性激活并氧化，导致形成马来酸酐作为产物。
