[1] "In contrast to fluoridation,chlorination mainly leads to increased Lewis acidity [6,7]."
[2] "For F containing aluminas showing mainly Bronsted acidity this was to be expected."
[3] "For chlorinated aluminas-for which the Lewis activity is increased- one may conclude that the activity of the Lewis centers must greatly be in- creased to give a higher overall activity,though the number of centers is reduced."
[4] "The different catalytic behavior is caused by activation of different sites, Bronsted-sites by fluorination and on silica-aluminas [23] and Lewis-centers by chlorination."

Metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these processes enable the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. Specifically, fluorination activates Bronsted sites, while chlorination enhances Lewis centers, leading to distinct catalytic behaviors depending on the type of oxide material.

在氧化物材料上，金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象等机制促进C-H键活化，在工业中选择性氧化烷烃的背景下，这些过程使丁烷转化为马来酸酐成为可能。具体而言，氟化激活Bronsted位点，而氯化增强Lewis中心，导致不同类型的氧化物材料产生不同的催化行为。
