The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes. These mechanisms involve the metal center abstracting hydrogen atoms from alkane molecules, leading to the formation of carbocation intermediates that can undergo further chemical transformations. In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, for instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride showcases how these principles are applied. The reaction involves the selective activation of specific carbon-hydrogen bonds, leading to the formation of the desired product while minimizing side reactions. The ability of halogenated aluminas to alter the acidity of the surface sites, either by increasing Bronsted or Lewis acidity depending on the halogen used, plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic efficiency for various reactions. This is exemplified by the differing effects of fluorination and chlorination on the surface properties of aluminas, affecting their reactivity patterns and selectivities in catalytic processes.
