The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes. These mechanisms involve the metal center abstracting hydrogen atoms from alkane molecules, leading to the formation of carbocation intermediates that can undergo further chemical transformations. In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, for instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride showcases how these principles are applied. The reaction involves the selective activation of specific carbon-hydrogen bonds, leading to the formation of the desired product while minimizing side reactions. The ability of halogenated aluminas to alter the acidity of the surface sites, either by increasing Bronsted or Lewis acidity depending on the halogen used, plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic efficiency for various reactions. This is exemplified by the differing effects of fluorination and chlorination on the surface properties of aluminas, affecting their reactivity patterns and selectivities in catalytic processes.

The isolation of metal centers on oxide materials facilitates C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, which are crucial in heterogeneous catalysis. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation processes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. Specifically, the document highlights that halogenation affects the number of Lewis acid sites, reducing their density compared to silica-aluminas. This reduction impacts the catalytic behavior of the materials, with fluorination activating Bronsted sites and chlorination increasing Lewis center activity, albeit with a decreased number of active centers. The specific example provided is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the type of halogenation influences the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process.

1. The OH-bands of aluminum oxide (y-A12O3) are significantly affected by interactions with hydrochloric acid (HCl) or hydrofluoric acid (HF) adsorption. In contrast, other halogens absorbed as ammonium halides on the oxide material partially desorb during pretreatment at 530°C.
2. It appears that the surface phase of silica-aluminum (SiAl) consists of a mixture of alumina (A12O3) and silica (SiO2), which can be determined through the presence of Si-O-bands at 1632, 1865, and 1970 cm^-1.
3. As the composition shifts from pure aluminum oxide to silica-aluminum mixtures (SiAI-10 and SiAI-20), there is a notable reduction in the intensity of the band at 3684 cm^-1.
4. The spectra of silica-aluminum materials exhibit additional bands at 1632, 1865, and 1970 cm^-1, which increase in intensity with the addition of silica content.
5. These additional bands at 1632, 1865, and 1970 cm^-1 can be utilized for a spectroscopic estimation of the silica-aluminum composition.

2. 可以推断，硅铝的表面相由氧化铝（A12O3）和二氧化硅（SiO2）组成，并且可以通过1632、1865和1970 cm^-1的Si-O基团来确定硅铝的组成。
3. 当从纯氧化铝向硅铝混合物（SiAI-10和SiAI-20）过渡时，3684 cm^-1的基团强度显著降低。
4. 硅铝材料的光谱显示出额外的1632、1865和1970 cm^-1的基团，其强度随二氧化硅含量的增加而增加。
5. 这些1632、1865和1970 cm^-1的额外基团可用于对硅铝组成进行光谱估计。
