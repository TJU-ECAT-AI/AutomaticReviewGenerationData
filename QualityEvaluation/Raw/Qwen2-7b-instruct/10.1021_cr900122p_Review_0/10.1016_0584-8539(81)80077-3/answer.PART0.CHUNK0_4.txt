1. The OH-bands of aluminum oxide (y-A12O3) are significantly affected by interactions with hydrochloric acid (HCl) or hydrofluoric acid (HF) adsorption. In contrast, other halogens absorbed as ammonium halides on the oxide material partially desorb during pretreatment at 530°C.
2. It appears that the surface phase of silica-aluminum (SiAl) consists of a mixture of alumina (A12O3) and silica (SiO2), which can be determined through the presence of Si-O-bands at 1632, 1865, and 1970 cm^-1.
3. As the composition shifts from pure aluminum oxide to silica-aluminum mixtures (SiAI-10 and SiAI-20), there is a notable reduction in the intensity of the band at 3684 cm^-1.
4. The spectra of silica-aluminum materials exhibit additional bands at 1632, 1865, and 1970 cm^-1, which increase in intensity with the addition of silica content.
5. These additional bands at 1632, 1865, and 1970 cm^-1 can be utilized for a spectroscopic estimation of the silica-aluminum composition.

1. 研究显示，铝氧化物（y-A12O3）的OH基团强烈受到HCl或HF吸附的影响。相比之下，其他卤素作为铵卤化物吸附在氧化物材料上，在530°C的预处理过程中部分脱附。
2. 可以推断，硅铝的表面相由氧化铝（A12O3）和二氧化硅（SiO2）组成，并且可以通过1632、1865和1970 cm^-1的Si-O基团来确定硅铝的组成。
3. 当从纯氧化铝向硅铝混合物（SiAI-10和SiAI-20）过渡时，3684 cm^-1的基团强度显著降低。
4. 硅铝材料的光谱显示出额外的1632、1865和1970 cm^-1的基团，其强度随二氧化硅含量的增加而增加。
5. 这些1632、1865和1970 cm^-1的额外基团可用于对硅铝组成进行光谱估计。
