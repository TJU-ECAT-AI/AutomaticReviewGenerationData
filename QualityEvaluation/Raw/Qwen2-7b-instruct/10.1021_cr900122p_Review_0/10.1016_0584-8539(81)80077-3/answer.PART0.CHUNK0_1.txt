[1] "The activity of aluminas may be increased by addition of chlorine or fluorine."
[2] "As can be seen from pyridine adsorption experiments, fluorinated aluminas show Bronsted acidity as silica-aluminas do."
[3] "In contrast to fluoridation, chlorination mainly leads to increased Lewis acidity."
[4] "By halogenation, the number of Lewis acid sites is reduced as on silica-aluminas."
[5] "The different catalytic behavior is caused by activation of different sites, Bronsted-sites by fluorination and on silica-aluminas and Lewis-centers by chlorination."

1. Aluminas' activity can be enhanced by adding chlorine or fluorine.
2. Fluorinated aluminas exhibit Bronsted acidity, similar to silica-aluminas.
3. Chlorination predominantly boosts Lewis acidity.
4. Halogenation reduces the number of Lewis acid sites, akin to silica-aluminas.
5. The varied catalytic performance is attributed to the activation of distinct sites: Bronsted-sites by fluorination and Lewis-centers by chlorination.

1. 添加氯或氟可以增强氧化铝的活性。
2. 氟化氧化铝表现出与硅酸铝类似的Bronsted酸性。
3. 氯化主要导致增加Lewis酸性。
4. 卤化减少了Lewis酸性位点的数量，类似于硅酸铝。
5. 不同的催化行为是由于激活不同位点引起的：氟化引发Bronsted位点的激活，而氯化则引发Lewis中心的激活。
