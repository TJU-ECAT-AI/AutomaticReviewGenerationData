[1] "Earlier investigations [9-l 31 clearly show that OH-bands of y-A&O, are strongly influenced by interaction with HCI or HF adsorbed."
[2] "In contrast to fluorine [l4], other halogens absorbed as ammoniumhalides on the oxide at least partially get desorbed by pretreatment of the oxide at 530C."

The isolation of metal centers on oxide materials facilitates C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, which are crucial in heterogeneous catalysis. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation processes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. Specifically, the document highlights that halogenation affects the number of Lewis acid sites, reducing their density compared to silica-aluminas. This reduction impacts the catalytic behavior of the materials, with fluorination activating Bronsted sites and chlorination increasing Lewis center activity, albeit with a decreased number of active centers. The specific example provided is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the type of halogenation influences the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process.

在氧化材料上孤立的金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen和H-摘取等机制促进了C-H键的活化，这是异相催化的关键。这些原则在工业选择性氧化过程中得到应用，包括将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的具体例子。文献特别指出，卤化作用减少了Lewis酸位点的数量，与硅铝氧化物相比，这影响了催化剂的行为。氟化主要激活Bronsted位点，而氯化增加了Lewis中心的活性，尽管活性中心的数量减少了。具体例子提供了将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程，其中卤化类型影响了催化过程的选择性和效率。
