<p>Zeolites have been shown to be useful catalysts in a large variety of reactions, from acid to base and redox catalysis.</p>
<p>We have seen that they will offer new opportunities for reactions in the field of chemical and fine chemicals if,besides the nature of active sites and dimensions and shape of the pores, one is able to tune the adsorption properties and local geometry of the active sites.</p>
<p>However, for many important applications, the size of the zeolitic pores are too small to react the bulky desired molecules.</p>
<p>Thus, new zeolites with larger pores have to be synthesized.</p>
<p>If we refer exclusively to zeolites, the maximum pore diameter corresponds to UTD-1 with 1.0 × 0.75 nm [188,189]. This is a unidimensional pore zeolite that, while interesting for some particular applications, can present limitations due to pore blocking.</p>

Zeolites are versatile catalysts used in various types of reactions, including acid, base, and redox catalysis. They offer new opportunities in chemical and fine chemical reactions by adjusting the adsorption properties and local geometry of active sites, beyond the nature of active sites and the dimensions and shapes of the pores. However, for many applications, the size of zeolitic pores is too small to react with bulky molecules. Therefore, new zeolites with larger pores need to be synthesized. While UTD-1 zeolite has a maximum pore diameter of 1.0 × 0.75 nm, which is a unidimensional pore zeolite, it presents limitations due to pore blocking for certain applications.

对于化学和精细化学品反应，沸石是多用途催化剂，在酸、碱和氧化还原催化反应中都有应用。通过调整活性位点的吸附性质和局部几何形状，可以进一步利用沸石的优势，而不仅仅是活性位点的性质、孔径尺寸和形状。然而，对于许多应用来说，沸石的孔径太小，无法与大分子反应。因此，需要合成具有更大孔径的新沸石。尽管UTD-1沸石的最大孔径为1.0 × 0.75 nm，这是一个一维孔道沸石，它在某些应用中存在因孔堵塞而受限的问题。
