[1] "The control of pore diameter and topology of zeolites, as well as the nature of active sites and adsorption properties, allow in many cases the a priori design of catalysts for applications in the fields of oil refining, petrochemistry, and the production of chemicals and fine chemicals."
[2] "Zeolites are solid catalysts with the following properties:• High surface area. • Molecular dimensions of the pores. • High adsorption capacity. • Partitioning of reactant/products."
[3] "The potentiality of nanocrystalline, delaminated, or ultralarge pore catalysts and of zeolites formed by channels with different dimensions is outlined."
[4] "The presence of strong electric fields and controllable adsorption properties within the pores will produce a unique type of catalyst,which by itself can be considered as a catalytic microreactor."
[5] "Zeolites with their regular well- defined pore dimensions are able to discriminate [12] reactants and products by size and shape when they present significant differences in diffusivity through a given pore channel system."
[6] "When a molecule is confined in the pores of a zeolite, the sorption energy will include different energy terms"

1. Zeolites can be designed for various applications in oil refining, petrochemistry, and chemical production based on their pore diameter, topology, active site nature, and adsorption properties. Zeolites exhibit high surface area, molecular-sized pore dimensions, high adsorption capacity, and the ability to partition reactants and products.

2. Zeolites are solid catalysts with characteristics such as high surface area, molecular-sized pore dimensions, high adsorption capacity, and the capability to separate reactants and products.

3. Zeolites with nanocrystalline, delaminated, or ultralarge pore structures, as well as those with channels of varying dimensions, possess potential.

4. Zeolite catalysts incorporate strong electric fields and controllable adsorption properties within their pores, making them unique microreactors.

5. Zeolites are capable of size and shape discrimination of reactants and products based on significant differences in diffusivity through their pore channel systems.

6. When a molecule is confined within a zeolite, the sorption energy comprises different energy components related to van der Waals interactions, polarization, field dipole, field quadrupole, and intermolecular interactions.
