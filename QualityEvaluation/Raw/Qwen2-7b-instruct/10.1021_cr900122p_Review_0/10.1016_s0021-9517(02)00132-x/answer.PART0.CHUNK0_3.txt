[1] "In this system the organic carrier does not interfere in the catalytic process since it cannot penetrate into the zeolite pores."
[2] "In this case, stability of the zeolite upon catalyst regeneration can be an issue."
[3] "Synthesize delaminated zeolites."
[4] "Delaminated zeolites are stable toward high-temperature calcination."
[5] "For more demanding regeneration conditions, the level of delamination, i.e., the size of the layers, could be controlled and in this way the hydrothermal stability of the delaminated zeolite could be improved."
[6] "It appears to us that by aiming toward the formation of three- and four-member ring secondary building units by means of specific cations-anions, and the use of large and rigid organic-structure-directing agents it may be possible to synthesize zeolites with larger pores."
[7] "Another possibility is to combine framework cations that may coordinate tetrahedrally and pentahedrally, leading to new structures with very large pores."
