<p>Zeolites are crystalline silicates and aluminosilicates linked through oxygen atoms, producing a three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions.</p>
<p>The potentiality of nanocrystalline, delaminated, or ultralarge pore catalysts and of zeolites formed by channels with different dimensions is outlined.</p>
<p>Isolated Al tetrahedrons will have zero NNN and support the strongest type of framework Brnsted acid site.</p>
<p>The acid strength of the Brnsted acid sites can also be modulated through isomorphic substitution, either by synthesis or by postsynthesis methods, of Si for trivalent atoms other than Al.</p>
<p>In the case of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), besides hydrocarbon cracking, hydrogen transfer between olefins and saturated molecules occurs. The ratio of rates for cracking (uni- and bimolecular) and hydrogen transfer (bimolecu- lar) has important implications for the final yield of olefins and aromatics, and consequently for gasoline octane number, propylene yield, and coke formation.</p>
<p>It is possible to generate basic sites within the pores of zeolites and in this way to take advantage of the properties of zeolites in base catalysis. In the case of zeolites the basic sites are of Lewis type and correspond to framework oxygens, and the basicity of a given oxygen will be related to the density of negative charge.</p>
<p>Some of the above reactions have been worked with ze- olites, but most of them, which are also of commercial interest, remain to be explored. We should rely on the imagi- nation of researchers to better exploit a relatively unexplored subject such as the combination of basicity and shape se- lectivity of zeolites to prepare new chemicals.</p>
<p>Researchers at ENI succeeded in introducing, by direct synthesis, Ti into the framework of silicalite, producing a TS-1 redox molecular sieve oxidation catalyst.</p>
<p>When hydrocarbons are oxidized with aqueous H2O2,two phases are formed unless a nonreactive cosolvent is added. Nevertheless, both polar and apolar reactants have to diffuse and adsorb into the pores of the zeolite. It appears that again the polarity of the zeolite plays an important role on the catalyst properties.</p>
<p>Let us now show how a redox zeolite can be designed to give the same products as an enzyme. Linalool is oxidized by an epoxidase enzyme to give furans and pyrans with high selectivities.</p>
<p>Special mention should be made of Al-free Sn-Beta for the BaeyerVilliger (BV) oxidation of cyclic ketones with diluted H2O2. This catalyst gives good activity and very high selectivity to the corresponding lactone.</p>
<p>New shape selectivity effects should be possible by synthesizing tridimensional medium-pore-size zeolites with pores formed by 9- or 9- and 10-member rings. The delib- erated epitaxial isotactic overgrowth of two zeolite phases at the micrometer scale has been demonstrated.</p>
