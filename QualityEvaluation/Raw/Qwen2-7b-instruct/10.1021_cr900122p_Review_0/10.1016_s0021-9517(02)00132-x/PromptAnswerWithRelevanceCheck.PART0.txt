<quotes>
<p>Zeolites are crystalline silicates and aluminosilicates linked through oxygen atoms, producing a three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions.</p>
<p>The potentiality of nanocrystalline, delaminated, or ultralarge pore catalysts and of zeolites formed by channels with different dimensions is outlined.</p>
<p>Isolated Al tetrahedrons will have zero NNN and support the strongest type of framework Brnsted acid site.</p>
<p>The acid strength of the Brnsted acid sites can also be modulated through isomorphic substitution, either by synthesis or by postsynthesis methods, of Si for trivalent atoms other than Al.</p>
<p>In the case of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), besides hydrocarbon cracking, hydrogen transfer between olefins and saturated molecules occurs. The ratio of rates for cracking (uni- and bimolecular) and hydrogen transfer (bimolecu- lar) has important implications for the final yield of olefins and aromatics, and consequently for gasoline octane number, propylene yield, and coke formation.</p>
<p>It is possible to generate basic sites within the pores of zeolites and in this way to take advantage of the properties of zeolites in base catalysis. In the case of zeolites the basic sites are of Lewis type and correspond to framework oxygens, and the basicity of a given oxygen will be related to the density of negative charge.</p>
<p>Some of the above reactions have been worked with ze- olites, but most of them, which are also of commercial interest, remain to be explored. We should rely on the imagi- nation of researchers to better exploit a relatively unexplored subject such as the combination of basicity and shape se- lectivity of zeolites to prepare new chemicals.</p>
<p>Researchers at ENI succeeded in introducing, by direct synthesis, Ti into the framework of silicalite, producing a TS-1 redox molecular sieve oxidation catalyst.</p>
<p>When hydrocarbons are oxidized with aqueous H2O2,two phases are formed unless a nonreactive cosolvent is added. Nevertheless, both polar and apolar reactants have to diffuse and adsorb into the pores of the zeolite. It appears that again the polarity of the zeolite plays an important role on the catalyst properties.</p>
<p>Let us now show how a redox zeolite can be designed to give the same products as an enzyme. Linalool is oxidized by an epoxidase enzyme to give furans and pyrans with high selectivities.</p>
<p>Special mention should be made of Al-free Sn-Beta for the BaeyerVilliger (BV) oxidation of cyclic ketones with diluted H2O2. This catalyst gives good activity and very high selectivity to the corresponding lactone.</p>
<p>New shape selectivity effects should be possible by synthesizing tridimensional medium-pore-size zeolites with pores formed by 9- or 9- and 10-member rings. The delib- erated epitaxial isotactic overgrowth of two zeolite phases at the micrometer scale has been demonstrated.</p>

<p>Zeolites have been shown to be useful catalysts in a large variety of reactions, from acid to base and redox catalysis.</p>
<p>We have seen that they will offer new opportunities for reactions in the field of chemical and fine chemicals if,besides the nature of active sites and dimensions and shape of the pores, one is able to tune the adsorption properties and local geometry of the active sites.</p>
<p>However, for many important applications, the size of the zeolitic pores are too small to react the bulky desired molecules.</p>
<p>Thus, new zeolites with larger pores have to be synthesized.</p>
<p>If we refer exclusively to zeolites, the maximum pore diameter corresponds to UTD-1 with 1.0 × 0.75 nm [188,189]. This is a unidimensional pore zeolite that, while interesting for some particular applications, can present limitations due to pore blocking.</p>

Zeolites are versatile catalysts used in various types of reactions, including acid, base, and redox catalysis. They offer new opportunities in chemical and fine chemical reactions by adjusting the adsorption properties and local geometry of active sites, beyond the nature of active sites and the dimensions and shapes of the pores. However, for many applications, the size of zeolitic pores is too small to react with bulky molecules. Therefore, new zeolites with larger pores need to be synthesized. While UTD-1 zeolite has a maximum pore diameter of 1.0 × 0.75 nm, which is a unidimensional pore zeolite, it presents limitations due to pore blocking for certain applications.

对于化学和精细化学品反应，沸石是多用途催化剂，在酸、碱和氧化还原催化反应中都有应用。通过调整活性位点的吸附性质和局部几何形状，可以进一步利用沸石的优势，而不仅仅是活性位点的性质、孔径尺寸和形状。然而，对于许多应用来说，沸石的孔径太小，无法与大分子反应。因此，需要合成具有更大孔径的新沸石。尽管UTD-1沸石的最大孔径为1.0 × 0.75 nm，这是一个一维孔道沸石，它在某些应用中存在因孔堵塞而受限的问题。

[1] "In this system the organic carrier does not interfere in the catalytic process since it cannot penetrate into the zeolite pores."
[2] "In this case, stability of the zeolite upon catalyst regeneration can be an issue."
[3] "Synthesize delaminated zeolites."
[4] "Delaminated zeolites are stable toward high-temperature calcination."
[5] "For more demanding regeneration conditions, the level of delamination, i.e., the size of the layers, could be controlled and in this way the hydrothermal stability of the delaminated zeolite could be improved."
[6] "It appears to us that by aiming toward the formation of three- and four-member ring secondary building units by means of specific cations-anions, and the use of large and rigid organic-structure-directing agents it may be possible to synthesize zeolites with larger pores."
[7] "Another possibility is to combine framework cations that may coordinate tetrahedrally and pentahedrally, leading to new structures with very large pores."
