[1] "Strongly adsorbed atoms like N, C or O usually prefer the sites with the highest metal coordination number, that is, the same local adsorption geometry on e.g. a close packed and a stepped surface. This means that if the point of a given metal shifts on the x-axis of Fig. 1 when the geometry changes, this is primarily an electronic effect."
[2] "The electronic effect thus corresponds to a displacement along the BEP line."

Metal catalysts often feature active sites that are crucial for their catalytic performance. These active sites are influenced by the local geometry of the surface, leading to different classes of reactions based on their nature and structure sensitivity. The electronic effect, characterized by the interaction strength between metal atoms and adsorbates, is a primary determinant in this context. The BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relations help understand how different local geometries impact the stability of reaction intermediates and activation energies. The geometrical effect, related to the configurations available for bonding, also plays a significant role. Surface reactivity, as quantified by the dissociative chemisorption energy, is crucial in determining the catalytic activity trends across different metals.

The nature of active sites in metal catalysis has been a subject of extensive debate, tracing back to early suggestions regarding the role of unsaturated active sites. The structure dependence of catalytic reactions, which varies from one catalyst to another, is influenced by factors like particle size. This complexity is reflected in the three classes of structural dependence identified based on the magnitude of shifts in BEP lines or the difference between the shift in BEP lines (db) and the shift in reaction energy (dDE).

In the context of surface science and heterogeneous catalysis, a molecular-level understanding of active sites is essential. Different classes of reactions exhibit distinct active sites and dependencies on particle size, impacting the turnover rate and selectivity. The Sabatier analysis provides insights into how surface reactivity relates to catalytic activity, leading to volcano curves that describe the relationship between the catalytic rate and the reactivity of the surface.

The nature of active sites and their structure dependence in heterogeneous catalysts remain topics of ongoing research and debate, with implications for the design and optimization of catalysts in various industrial applications.
