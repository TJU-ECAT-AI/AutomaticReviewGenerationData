The literature discusses the nature of active sites in metal catalysis, focusing on BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relations obtained from electronic structure calculations of adsorption on metal surfaces. These relations help understand the nature of active sites and their dependence on particle size. BEP lines, which reflect the dependence of the BEP lines on the local structure of the reaction site, determine the structural (geometrical) effect of individual elementary reactions and whether a complete catalytic reaction is structure sensitive for a given catalyst. The literature also introduces a term called the degree of structure sensitivity, which quantifies the effect. The text provides a molecular-level discussion of metal catalysis and its application in various industrial processes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

文献讨论了金属催化作用位点的性质，重点关注了从金属表面吸附的电子结构计算中获得的BrnstedEvansPolanyi（BEP）关系。这些关系有助于理解活性位点的性质及其对颗粒尺寸的依赖性。BEP线反映了反应位点局部结构对BEP线的影响，决定了单个基本反应的几何效应以及给定催化剂下完整催化反应的结构敏感性。文献还引入了一个称为结构敏感性的度量术语，用于量化该效应。文本提供了金属催化作用的分子级讨论，并应用于各种工业过程，包括将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。
