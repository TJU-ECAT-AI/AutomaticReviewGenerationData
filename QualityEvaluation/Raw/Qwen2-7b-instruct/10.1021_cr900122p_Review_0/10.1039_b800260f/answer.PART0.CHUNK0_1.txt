[1] "Strongly adsorbed atoms like N, C or O usually prefer the sites with the highest metal coordination number, that is, the same local adsorption geometry on e.g. a close packed and a stepped surface."
[2] "Steps and edges (which are 1-dimensional) of a particle have ai = 1, whereas corners and kinks (which are point defects and therefore 0-dimensional) have ai = 2."
[3] "A number of other reactions belong to the same class of strongly structure dependent reactions. Ammonia synthesis is a good example."

[5] "Recently, it was demonstrated by direct in situ characterization of the active sites that H2 evolution over MoS2 shows a strong structure sensitivity."
[6] "Au on the right side of the volcano shows a clear increase in rate per surface area when going to smaller particles, whereas Pt on the left side has been measured to have a decrease in rate per surface area when the particle size decreases."

1. Strongly adsorbed atoms prefer sites with higher metal coordination number, regardless of the surface's local adsorption geometry.
2. Edges have an ai value of 1, while corners and kinks have an ai value of 2.
3. Ammonia synthesis is an example of a reaction that exhibits strong structure sensitivity.
4. Steam reforming and the dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas over Ni are examples of processes with structure-sensitive catalysis.
5. H2 evolution over MoS2 demonstrates a high degree of structure sensitivity.
6. Gold shows an increase in rate per surface area when decreasing particle size, unlike platinum, which experiences a decrease in rate per surface area under the same condition.
