The literature discusses the nature of active sites in metal catalysis, focusing on BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relations obtained from electronic structure calculations of adsorption on metal surfaces. These relations help understand the nature of active sites and their dependence on particle size. BEP lines, which reflect the dependence of the BEP lines on the local structure of the reaction site, determine the structural (geometrical) effect of individual elementary reactions and whether a complete catalytic reaction is structure sensitive for a given catalyst. The literature also introduces a term called the degree of structure sensitivity, which quantifies the effect. The text provides a molecular-level discussion of metal catalysis and its application in various industrial processes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

[9] "Strongly adsorbed atoms like N, C or O usually prefer the sites with the highest metal coordination number, that is, the same local adsorption geometry on e.g. a close packed and a stepped surface."
[10] "It was realized already a century ago that the rate for a heterogeneous catalytic reaction under given conditions shows a maximum when considered as a function of the reactivity of the catalytic surface."
[11] "Clearly, the over-all reaction rate cannot be larger than the maximal forward rate of the activation step (r1), nor can it be larger than the maximal rate of the removal step (r2)."
[12] "In standard microkinetic modeling,7 the maximal forward rate for a given step is equal to the rate constant, except from trivial prefactors depending only on coverages and pressures."
[13] "The maximal rates are shown for the two reaction steps, with a choice of reasonable standard reaction parameters."
[14] "The ex- ponential variations in the maximal rates of the individual steps are due to the linear variations in the activation barriers in the Arrhenius expressions for the rate constants as DE is varied."
[15] "The maximal rate curves trace out what we call the Sabatier volcano-an exact upper bound on the reaction rate."
[16] "Perhaps not surprisingly Pd and Pt turn out to be the best catalysts under these conditions."
[17] "We thus conclude that the BEP relations for surface reac- tions directly entail volcano relations for the catalytic rate as a function of surface reactivity, and that there is ample reason for describing the surface reactivity in terms of the dissociative chemisorption energy of the key reactants."
[18] "Classification of structure sensitivity The Sabatier analysis can be used to classify different types of structure sensitivity in catalytic reactions."
[19] "For metals on the right leg of the volcano (noble metals), the steps are always the most active."
[20] "For the more reactive metals on the left leg, it depends on the degree of structure sensitivity of the elementary step whether the reac- tion will appear structure sensitive or not."

To answer the first question, isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. These processes involve the formation of a surface-bound species that abstracts a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon substrate, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This alkyl radical can then undergo further reactions, such as oxidative addition, to form the desired product. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is an industrial application of this principle, where the butane molecule is oxidized over a metal catalyst to produce maleic anhydride.

To answer the second question, the principles of C-H bond activation through the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes by carefully selecting the metal catalyst and operating conditions. The metal catalyst provides the necessary surface for the reaction to occur, while the oxide material typically enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst. By controlling factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of additional reagents, the selective oxidation of alkanes can be optimized to produce the desired product, such as maleic anhydride from butane, with high efficiency and yield.

对于第一个问题，孤立在氧化物材料上的金属中心通过Mars-van-Krevelen机制和H抽象机制在异相催化中促进了C-H键的活化。这些过程涉及形成表面结合的物种，从烃基化合物中抽象氢原子，导致形成烷基自由基。这个烷基自由基可以进一步反应，如氧化插入，以形成所需的产物。将丁烷转化为马来酸酐是这种原理的工业应用之一，其中丁烷分子在金属催化剂上被氧化生成马来酸酐。

对于第二个问题，通过选择金属催化剂和操作条件，Mars-van-Krevelen机制和H抽象机制应用于烷烃的选择性氧化中。金属催化剂提供了反应发生的必要表面，而氧化物材料通常提高了催化剂的稳定性和活性。通过控制温度、压力以及额外试剂的存在等因素，可以优化烷烃的选择性氧化，以高效且高产率地生成所需产物，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。

[1] "Strongly adsorbed atoms like N, C or O usually prefer the sites with the highest metal coordination number, that is, the same local adsorption geometry on e.g. a close packed and a stepped surface. This means that if the point of a given metal shifts on the x-axis of Fig. 1 when the geometry changes, this is primarily an electronic effect."
[2] "The electronic effect thus corresponds to a displacement along the BEP line."
[3] "Often close-packed surfaces give the highest and very open structures like steps the lowest values of b, but this need not be so for all molecules."
[4] "We conclude that we can identify three classes of structural dependence for surface reactivity: Strong structural effects are found when the shift in BEP lines (or shift in b, db) is large and larger than the shift in reaction energy, dDE, from one structure to the next."

Metal catalysts often feature active sites that are crucial for their catalytic performance. These active sites are influenced by the local geometry of the surface, leading to different classes of reactions based on their nature and structure sensitivity. The electronic effect, characterized by the interaction strength between metal atoms and adsorbates, is a primary determinant in this context. The BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relations help understand how different local geometries impact the stability of reaction intermediates and activation energies. The geometrical effect, related to the configurations available for bonding, also plays a significant role. Surface reactivity, as quantified by the dissociative chemisorption energy, is crucial in determining the catalytic activity trends across different metals.

The nature of active sites in metal catalysis has been a subject of extensive debate, tracing back to early suggestions regarding the role of unsaturated active sites. The structure dependence of catalytic reactions, which varies from one catalyst to another, is influenced by factors like particle size. This complexity is reflected in the three classes of structural dependence identified based on the magnitude of shifts in BEP lines or the difference between the shift in BEP lines (db) and the shift in reaction energy (dDE).

In the context of surface science and heterogeneous catalysis, a molecular-level understanding of active sites is essential. Different classes of reactions exhibit distinct active sites and dependencies on particle size, impacting the turnover rate and selectivity. The Sabatier analysis provides insights into how surface reactivity relates to catalytic activity, leading to volcano curves that describe the relationship between the catalytic rate and the reactivity of the surface.

The nature of active sites and their structure dependence in heterogeneous catalysts remain topics of ongoing research and debate, with implications for the design and optimization of catalysts in various industrial applications.

金属催化剂中的活性位点对于其催化性能至关重要。这些活性位点受表面局部几何结构的影响，导致基于其性质和结构敏感性的不同反应类。电子效应，由金属原子与吸附剂之间的相互作用强度决定，是这一背景下最重要的因素之一。BrnstedEvansPolanyi（BEP）关系帮助理解不同局部几何结构如何影响反应中间体的稳定性以及活化能。几何效应，与可用于成键的配置相关，也发挥了重要作用。表面反应性，通过离解吸附能量进行量化，对不同金属之间的催化活性趋势具有重要意义。

关于金属催化活性位点的性质的讨论已经持续了一个世纪，可以追溯到关于原子水平上不饱和活性位点能够控制表面化学反应的早期建议。催化反应结构依赖性的复杂性体现在根据BEP线的偏移量或BEP线偏移量（db）与反应能量偏移量（dDE）之间的差异所识别的三个结构依赖性类别中。

在表面科学和异质催化领域，从分子层面理解活性位点是至关重要的。不同类型的反应表现出不同的活性位点和对颗粒大小的依赖性，影响着转化率和选择性。Sabatier分析提供了关于表面反应性和催化活性之间关系的见解，导致火山曲线描述催化速率与表面活性之间的关系。

关于金属催化活性位点的性质及其结构依赖性的讨论仍然是正在进行的研究和辩论的主题，这与各种工业应用中催化剂的设计和优化有着深远的影响。
