[1] "Metal surfaces are used extensively as catalysts in all sections of chemical industry, in environmental protection and in energy conversion processes."
[2] "Typically, the metals are present in the form of nanoparticles in order to expose as large a surface area as possible to the reacting molecules from the gas or liquid phase."
[3] "An important question is which of these local geometries constitute the active sites where the catalysis actually takes place."
[4] "The question of the nature of the active sites and structure dependence of heterogeneous catalysts has been debated for almost a century."
[5] "The understanding of the structure dependence of reactions has progressed enormously with the development of ultra-high vacuum technology combined with single crystal studies."
[6] "This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2008, 37, 21632171"
[7] "We will show how different classes of reactions have different active sites and different dependence of the catalytic activity (turn over rate and/or selectivity) on particle size."
[8] "We will start by introducing the key concepts in our analysis: the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship between activa- tion energies and reaction energies for elementary surface reactions."
[9] "Strongly adsorbed atoms like N, C or O usually prefer the sites with the highest metal coordination number, that is, the same local adsorption geometry on e.g. a close packed and a stepped surface."
[10] "It was realized already a century ago that the rate for a heterogeneous catalytic reaction under given conditions shows a maximum when considered as a function of the reactivity of the catalytic surface."
[11] "Clearly, the over-all reaction rate cannot be larger than the maximal forward rate of the activation step (r1), nor can it be larger than the maximal rate of the removal step (r2)."
[12] "In standard microkinetic modeling,7 the maximal forward rate for a given step is equal to the rate constant, except from trivial prefactors depending only on coverages and pressures."
[13] "The maximal rates are shown for the two reaction steps, with a choice of reasonable standard reaction parameters."
[14] "The ex- ponential variations in the maximal rates of the individual steps are due to the linear variations in the activation barriers in the Arrhenius expressions for the rate constants as DE is varied."
[15] "The maximal rate curves trace out what we call the Sabatier volcano-an exact upper bound on the reaction rate."
[16] "Perhaps not surprisingly Pd and Pt turn out to be the best catalysts under these conditions."
[17] "We thus conclude that the BEP relations for surface reac- tions directly entail volcano relations for the catalytic rate as a function of surface reactivity, and that there is ample reason for describing the surface reactivity in terms of the dissociative chemisorption energy of the key reactants."
[18] "Classification of structure sensitivity The Sabatier analysis can be used to classify different types of structure sensitivity in catalytic reactions."
[19] "For metals on the right leg of the volcano (noble metals), the steps are always the most active."
[20] "For the more reactive metals on the left leg, it depends on the degree of structure sensitivity of the elementary step whether the reac- tion will appear structure sensitive or not."
[21] "Here the strongest bonding sites dominate because the reac- tion barrier is affected more than the reaction energy."
[22] "Fig. 6 shows the measured rate of methane dissociation on a Ni(111) surface with approximately 4% step sites when the surface is clean and when the steps have been blocked by adsorbed sulfur."
[23] "Fig. 7a shows the same experiment but for CO dissociation."
[24] "We note that a very strong structure dependence can appear in surface science experiments as an absence of structure sensitivity."
[25] "Fig. 9 shows experimental data for methanation."
[26] "A number of other reactions belong to the same class of strongly structure dependent reactions."
[27] "Recently, it was demonstrated by direct in situ characterization of the active sites that H2 evolution over MoS2 shows a strong structure sensitivity."
[28] "There are cases illustrating how metals on two different sides of the volcano behave differently."
[29] "The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction is such an example belonging to the class of reactions we refer to as Case 3."
[30] "As expected, Au on the right side of the volcano shows a clear increase in rate per surface area when going to smaller particles, whereas Pt on the left side has been measured to have a decrease in rate per surface area when the particle size decreases."

To answer the first question, isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. These processes involve the formation of a surface-bound species that abstracts a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon substrate, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. This alkyl radical can then undergo further reactions, such as oxidative addition, to form the desired product. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is an industrial application of this principle, where the butane molecule is oxidized over a metal catalyst to produce maleic anhydride.

To answer the second question, the principles of C-H bond activation through the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes by carefully selecting the metal catalyst and operating conditions. The metal catalyst provides the necessary surface for the reaction to occur, while the oxide material typically enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst. By controlling factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of additional reagents, the selective oxidation of alkanes can be optimized to produce the desired product, such as maleic anhydride from butane, with high efficiency and yield.

对于第一个问题，孤立在氧化物材料上的金属中心通过Mars-van-Krevelen机制和H抽象机制在异相催化中促进了C-H键的活化。这些过程涉及形成表面结合的物种，从烃基化合物中抽象氢原子，导致形成烷基自由基。这个烷基自由基可以进一步反应，如氧化插入，以形成所需的产物。将丁烷转化为马来酸酐是这种原理的工业应用之一，其中丁烷分子在金属催化剂上被氧化生成马来酸酐。

对于第二个问题，通过选择金属催化剂和操作条件，Mars-van-Krevelen机制和H抽象机制应用于烷烃的选择性氧化中。金属催化剂提供了反应发生的必要表面，而氧化物材料通常提高了催化剂的稳定性和活性。通过控制温度、压力以及额外试剂的存在等因素，可以优化烷烃的选择性氧化，以高效且高产率地生成所需产物，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。
