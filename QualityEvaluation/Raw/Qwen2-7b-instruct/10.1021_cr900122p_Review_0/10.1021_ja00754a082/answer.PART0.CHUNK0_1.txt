The literature discusses the chemisorption of molecular hydrogen on zinc oxide, which is a key process in heterogeneous catalysis. The article cites various studies showing that hydrogen can be effectively adsorbed onto the surface of zinc oxide, facilitating its use in industrial applications such as selective oxidation of alkanes. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is one specific example where the activation of C-H bonds plays a crucial role in the catalytic process.
