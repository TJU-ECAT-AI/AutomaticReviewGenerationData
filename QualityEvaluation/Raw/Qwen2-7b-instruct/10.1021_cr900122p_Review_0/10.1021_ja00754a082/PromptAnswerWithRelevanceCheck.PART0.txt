<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Isolated metal centers on oxide materials significantly contribute to the activation of C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis. The Mars van Krevelen pathway is one of the key mechanisms involved, which typically entails a metal center facilitating the abstraction of a hydrogen atom (H-abstraction) from the substrate. These concepts are practically implemented in industrial processes for selective oxidation of alkanes. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride exemplifies the application of these principles in industrial chemistry.

Butane is typically converted to maleic anhydride through an industrial process over a metal oxide catalyst. This involves selective oxidation of butane, necessitating meticulous control over reaction conditions to ensure high yield and selectivity. The conversion mechanism comprises breaking the C-H bond, followed by the addition of oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which subsequently undergoes further reactions to produce maleic anhydride.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The chemisorption of molecular hydrogen on zinc oxide facilitates the activation of C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis. This process often involves mechanisms such as Mars-van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the context of industrial applications, such as the selective oxidation of alkanes, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride exemplifies the application of these principles. In this process, the activated C-H bond in butane is selectively oxidized over other functional groups due to the optimized conditions and active site properties of the catalyst. The specific mechanism involves the introduction of oxygen atoms or functional groups onto the alkane molecule, leading to the formation of maleic anhydride, while minimizing side reactions and maintaining high selectivity.

氢分子在氧化锌上的化学吸附促进了异相催化中C-H键的活化。这一过程通常涉及Mars-van Krevelen和H-抽象等机制。在工业应用中，如烷烃的选择性氧化，丁烷转化为马来酸酐就是一个体现这些原则的应用实例。在这个过程中，通过催化剂的优化条件和活性位点特性，选择性地氧化烷烃分子中的C-H键，同时避免其他功能团的反应，保持高选择性，最终形成马来酸酐。
