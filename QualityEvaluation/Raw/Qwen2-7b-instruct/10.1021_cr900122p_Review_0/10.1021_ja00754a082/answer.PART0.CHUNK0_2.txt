Isolated metal centers on oxide materials significantly contribute to the activation of C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis. The Mars van Krevelen pathway is one of the key mechanisms involved, which typically entails a metal center facilitating the abstraction of a hydrogen atom (H-abstraction) from the substrate. These concepts are practically implemented in industrial processes for selective oxidation of alkanes. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride exemplifies the application of these principles in industrial chemistry.

[1] "Butane is converted to maleic anhydride over a metal oxide catalyst in a typical industrial process."
[2] "This process involves the selective oxidation of butane, which requires precise control over reaction conditions to achieve high yield and selectivity."
[3] "The conversion mechanism includes the breaking of the C-H bond followed by the addition of oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which then undergoes further reactions to produce maleic anhydride."

Butane is typically converted to maleic anhydride through an industrial process over a metal oxide catalyst. This involves selective oxidation of butane, necessitating meticulous control over reaction conditions to ensure high yield and selectivity. The conversion mechanism comprises breaking the C-H bond, followed by the addition of oxygen to form a carbonyl group, which subsequently undergoes further reactions to produce maleic anhydride.
