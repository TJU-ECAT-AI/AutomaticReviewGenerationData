[1] "The authors conclusion that the influence upon the conducting power of air or other gas interposed between oppositely electrified surfaces is due, not to an imponderable force radiating from the molecules of thoria, but to the escape in minute quantity of some substance which is mixed with the thoria, and which can be dissolved and precipitated, was of very great interest."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The investigation revealed that the conducting power of air or other gas between electrified surfaces is not caused by an invisible force from thoria molecules, but rather by a small substance mixed with thoria that can be dissolved and precipitated.

<quotes>
[1] "The electrical methods employed for the measurement of emanating power and radioactivity depend on the universal property of the radiations from substances known as radioactive of ionising or producing charged carriers from the gas through which they pass whereby the gas is rendered capable of conducting a current of electricity."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The methods used to measure emanating power and radioactivity rely on the universal property of the radiation from substances known as radioactive, which ionizes or produces charged particles in the gas they pass through, enabling the gas to conduct an electric current.
