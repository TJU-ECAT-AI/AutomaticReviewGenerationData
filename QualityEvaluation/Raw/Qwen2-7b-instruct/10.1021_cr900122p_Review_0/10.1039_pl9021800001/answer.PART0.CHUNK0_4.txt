[1] "The authors described a modification of Zeisels well-known method in which the condenser supplied with water at 4 0 
is replaced by a fractionating column ;this is so eacient that the potcash bulbs containing water with red phosphorus in suspension may be dispensed with."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
2. The authors outlined a modification of Zeisel's renowned technique where the condenser fed with water at 40 degrees Celsius was substituted with a fractionating column; this resulted in significantly streamlined setup and operation compared to Zeisel's original method.

[1] "The authors conclusion that the influence upon the conducting power of air or other gas interposed between oppositely electrified surfaces is due, not to an imponderable force radiating from the molecules of thoria, but to the escape in minute quantity of some substance which is mixed with the thoria, and which can be dissolved and precipitated."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
5. The authors concluded that the impact on the conductivity of air or any other gas placed between two oppositely charged surfaces is not caused by an invisible force emanating from thorium molecules, but rather by the release of a small amount of substance mixed with thorium that can be dissolved and precipitated.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
<ChineseVersionAnswer>
5. 作者得出结论，将两块相反极性的表面之间放置的空气或其他气体的影响，并非源自从钍分子辐射出的不可衡量的力量，而是由于释放了一定量与钍混合的物质，该物质可以溶解和沉淀。
