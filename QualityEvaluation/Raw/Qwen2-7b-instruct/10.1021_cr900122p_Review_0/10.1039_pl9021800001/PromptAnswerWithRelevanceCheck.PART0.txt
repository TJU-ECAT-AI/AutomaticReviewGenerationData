[1] "An investigation of the radioactive emanation produced by thorium compounds."
[2] "The electrical methods employed for the measurement of emanating power and radioactivity depend on the universal property of the radiations from substances known as radioactive of ionising or producing charged carriers from the gas through which they pass whereby the gas is rendered capable of conducting a current of electricity."
[3] "The amount of the current, measured by means of a quadrant electrometer, affords the means of comparing the intensities of radiations, and the method is capable of a degree of precision and rapidity impossible with the better known photographic method."
[4] "The means employed for eliminating the effects of the emanation from the effects of the straight line radiation and vice versa were explained."
[5] "The first question is conclusively answered in the affirmative. After solution and reprecipitation, no difference was observed in the emanating powers of thorium compounds prepared from ordinary thoria and thoria de-emanated as completely as possible by intense ignition."
[6] "With regard to the second question, the attempts first made to separate from thorium a substance to which the emanating power could be traced were not successful."
[7] "No change in either the emanating power or radioactivity was observed in thoria prepared by these methods."
[8] "Subsequently, results of a different character were obtained."
[9] "It was found that water vapour increases and desiccation decreases the normal value of the emanating power, the extremes varying in the ratio of 2 to 1."
[10] "An investigation of the third point, the chemical nature of the emanation itself, showed that this possesses the property of chemical inertness which characterises the members of the argon family."

<quotes>
[1] "The main questions examined by the authors are (1) Can thoria, the emanating power of which has been largely destroyed by ignition,have this property restored to it by chemical treatment ? (2) Is eman- ating power to be regarded as a specific property of thorium, or is it due to the presence of a foreign material!"
(3) Does the radioactive emanation itself resemble in chemical nature any known substance ?
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses several key points regarding thorium compounds and their emanation properties. It investigates whether the emanating power of thoria can be restored through chemical treatment after ignition-induced destruction. It also explores if the emanating power is a unique property of thorium or associated with an external substance. Additionally, the study examines if the radioactive emanation shares chemical characteristics with known substances.

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Electrical techniques utilized for measuring emanating power and radioactivity rely on the inherent property of radiation from substances known as radioactive or ionizing materials. These materials generate charged carriers when passing through a gas, enabling the gas to conduct an electric current. The current, measured using a quadrant electrometer, allows for the comparison of radiation intensities. This method offers a level of accuracy and speed that surpasses traditional photographic techniques.

[1] "It was found that water vapour increases and desiccation decreases the normal value of the emanating power, the extremes varying in the ratio of 2 to 1. Cooling acts powerfully in the opposite direction to illcrease of temperature."
[2] "A remarkable observation has been made on the solutions from which thorium has been precipitated with ammonia ; although these should be free from thoria, they still possess both emanating power and radioactivity in considerable amounts."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Research revealed that water vapor increases while desiccation reduces the typical emanating power value. The range of these extremes is 2 to 1. Cooling counteracts the increase in temperature significantly. A noteworthy finding was that solutions precipitated with ammonia from thorium contained both emanating power and radioactivity in substantial quantities, despite being expected to be free of thorium.

[1] "The authors conclusion that the influence upon the conducting power of air or other gas interposed between oppositely electrified surfaces is due, not to an imponderable force radiating from the molecules of thoria, but to the escape in minute quantity of some substance which is mixed with the thoria, and which can be dissolved and precipitated."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
5. The authors concluded that the impact on the conductivity of air or other gas between two oppositely charged surfaces isn't due to an undetectable force from thorium molecules, but rather to the emission of a small amount of a substance mixed with thorium, which can be dissolved and precipitated.
