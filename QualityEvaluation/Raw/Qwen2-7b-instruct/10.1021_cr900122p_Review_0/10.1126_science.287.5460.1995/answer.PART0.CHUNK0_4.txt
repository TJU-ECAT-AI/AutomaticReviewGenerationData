<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The absence of involvement of Pd(I1)-vinylidene and Pd(I1)-allenyl complexes in the reaction was confirmed (references 26 and 27). In the addition of alk-oxyarenes to activated alkenes, the involvement of alkene carbocations might be feasible. This method provides a straightforward, general, and efficient one-step conversion of simple arenes into valuable compounds under mild conditions. It is anticipated to have numerous applications in organic and medical chemistry, and it could be utilized by chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
