Model systems for studying molecular surface chemistry have evolved from single crystal surfaces
at low pressure to colloidal nanoparticles at high pressure. Low pressure surface structure studies
of platinum single crystals using molecular beam surface scattering and low energy electron
diﬀraction techniques probe the unique activity of defects, steps and kinks at the surface for
dissociation reactions (H–H, C–H, C–C, O
Q
O bonds). High-pressure investigations of platinum
single crystals using sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy have revealed the presence
and the nature of reaction intermediates. High pressure scanning tunneling microscopy of platinum
single crystal surfaces showed adsorbate mobility during a catalytic reaction. Nanoparticle systems
are used to determine the role of metal–oxide interfaces, site blocking and the role of surface
structures in reactive surface chemistry. The size, shape and composition of nanoparticles play
important roles in determining reaction activity and selectivity and is covered in this tutorial review.
I.
Introduction
Much of the research by Gerhard Ertl’s group is focused on
vacuum studies of reactive chemistry on single crystal surfaces,
with a special emphasis on chemisorption.1,2 During the past
forty years, both molecular surface science and surface tech-
nologies underwent explosive development.3 Instruments are
now available that permit atomic scale analysis of the structure
and composition of surfaces in a vacuum and at solid–gas and
solid–liquid interfaces during active catalytic reactions.4–7
The three types of surfaces studied are shown in Fig. 1.
External surfaces are generally single crystals (Fig. 1a).8 Inter-
nal surfaces are where most of the surface area is located inside
the micropores or mesopores.9,10 These surfaces may contain
metal nanoparticles for catalytic purposes (Fig. 1b). Nanopar-
ticles are fabricated by lithography techniques or synthesized
in colloidal solutions (Fig. 1c).11–13
The current technologies developing most rapidly within
modern surface chemistry are shown in Fig. 2.14 These applica-
tions include catalysis, biointerfaces, electrochemistry and corro-
sion. The properties and technologies based on these properties
can now be revisited, allowing for studies and increased under-
standing on the molecular scale. For example tribology, the
science of friction, lubrication and wear, has experienced a
renaissance with the development of new technologies of super-
ior lubricants, wear-resistant coatings, and new nanotribological
tools such as friction force microscopy.15,16

This review focuses on the catalytic reactivity of platinum to
show how the evolution of molecular surface chemistry led to
more advanced applications of this metal. Platinum is the
grandfather of all catalysts and is outstanding for carrying out
many chemical reactions. It was ﬁrst used in 1823 to produce
ﬂames, aiding the combustion of hydrogen in air. Paul
Sabatier compiled a book on organic reactions accelerated
by platinum at the end of the 19th century.17,18 Today,
platinum is the main component of the catalytic converter in
automobiles that cleans the exhaust gases. The metal is also
used to produce high-octane gasoline from naphtha.
Our studies indicate that the platinum surface restructures
during catalytic reactions. It has a diﬀerent structure when it
carries out oxidation reactions than when it rearranges organic
molecules. This chameleon-like behavior makes it very versa-
tile in many catalytic reactions.19–21 Three aspects of the study
of molecular surface chemistry of the metal are highlighted
here: the study of platinum single crystal surfaces in a vacuum,
the catalytic activity of platinum single crystal surfaces in high
pressures, and the synthesis, characterization and catalytic
reactions on platinum nanoparticles 1–10 nm in size.
II.
The study of platinum single crystal surfaces
in a vacuum and at low (o105 Torr) pressures
II.a.
Low energy electron diﬀraction (LEED)
The surface structures of clean surfaces and adsorbed mole-
cules were uncovered using low energy electron diﬀraction
(LEED) surface crystallography.8,22,23 A schematic of LEED
is shown in Fig. 3a. The small (B1 cm2) single-crystal sample
is cleaned in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, usually using a
chemical wash or ion-bombardment. Afterwards, the crystal is
heated to permit the ordering of surface atoms through
diﬀusion to equilibrium positions. An electron beam, in the
energy range of 10–200 eV, is back-scattered from the surface
and detected as a function of energy and angle. Due to the
small mean free path of low energy electrons, this technique is
sensitive to the atomic surface arrangement. Fig. 3b shows the
LEED patterns of Pt(111) and Pt(755) surfaces representing
the hexagonal and stepped surface structures.
LEED surface crystallography studies resulted in the dis-
covery of the reconstruction of clean surfaces. A surface is
formed by cutting through the solid parallel to a chosen plane
of atoms. Surface reconstruction is caused by the asymmetry
of the atomic arrangement at the interface, leading to a change
in the electronic states near and at the surface that reduces
surface free energy. This results in a change in the equilibrium
position of surface atoms. Fig. 4a shows the surface recon-
struction of the clean Pt(100)24 surface to the (1  5) surface
structure.
By monitoring the intensity of the diﬀracted beams as a
function of their kinetic energy, the surface structures of many
organic molecules, such as ethylene on Pt(111), were deter-
mined.25 The surface structure includes such details as precise
bond distances and bond angles. Fig. 4b shows metal surface

restructuring induced by ethylene (C2H4) adsorption in the
form of ethylidyne (C2H3), indicating that the adsorbate–
surface interaction induces both the molecular rearrangement
of the adsorbate and the reconstruction of metal surfaces
around the adsorption site. These studies and others25 show
that adsorbate-induced restructuring of metal surfaces forms
conﬁgurations similar to metal–organic complexes.
II.b.
Molecular beam surface scattering
Parallel with these studies of surface structures, molecular
beam surface scattering was developed and used for studying
reactions and energy transfer between incident molecules and
the metal surface atoms.26 A well-collimated beam of mole-
cules with a uniform and known translational energy and
known rotational and vibrational state populations strikes a
clean metal surface. Some of the molecules are back-reﬂected
after a very short residence time, while others are trapped for
much longer times before desorbing. By measuring the amount
of translational energy exchanged by detecting the velocity
and angular distribution of the scattered molecules with a
suitable time-of-ﬂight analysis, the gas–surface energy transfer
process can be described. Fig. 5a shows a schematic of
molecular beam surface scattering where the beams of mole-
cules are directed towards the surface.
Fig. 5b shows molecular beam scattering results from
studies of H2–D2 exchange. These results indicate that atomic
steps on metal surfaces break chemical bonds, in this case
hydrogen–hydrogen bonds, with unit reaction probability.
That is, every hydrogen molecule dissociated when scattered
from the stepped platinum surface. When a defect-free plati-
num (111) crystal face was studied, the dissociation probabi-
lity of molecular hydrogen was below the detection limit of
103.27 Combined molecular beam surface scattering and
LEED-surface structure studies revealed the unique activity
of defects, atomic steps and kinks on metal surfaces in
dissociating H–H, C–H, C–C, CRO and O
Q
O bonds.
III.
Catalytic activity of platinum single crystal
surfaces at high pressures
III.a.
Development of instruments for high pressure studies
Many catalytic reactions cannot be fully studied in a vacuum
because of the very low reaction probability inhibiting their
detection. Techniques utilized to study surfaces under pressure
have been developed. This review highlights three techniques
developed for studying surfaces at high pressure: a high pressure
–ultra high vacuum combined system, sum frequency generation
(SFG) vibrational spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling micro-
scopy. Schematics of these three techniques are shown in Fig. 6.
A high pressure–ultra high vacuum combined system per-
mitted both reaction studies at high pressures and surface
analysis, which needed vacuum before and after reactions
(Fig. 6a). Using these hybrid systems, we investigated various
catalytic reactions, including ammonia synthesis on iron,
rhenium crystal surfaces and hydrocarbon conversion reac-
tions over platinum. The reaction rate and product composi-
tion were found to depend upon the surface structure.28
SFG vibrational spectroscopy is a surface-speciﬁc optical
technique (Fig. 6b).6,29–32 One or both laser frequencies are tuned
and overlapped both spatially and temporally on the surface of

interest. SFG is a second-order nonlinear optical process, and, as
such, a signal is forbidden from a centrosymmetric medium, such
as the bulk of face centered cubic crystals or an isotropic high
pressure gas or a liquid.33,34 However, at the surface or interface,
the second order susceptibility is non-zero. The overall eﬃciency
of the SFG process will be enhanced when one of the beams is in
resonance with a vibrational level of a species at the interface. By
scanning one of the lasers in the infrared frequency regime, a sum
frequency signal can be obtained, and the surface yields a
vibrational spectrum that is sensitive only to molecules adsorbed
on the surface. This signal is in the visible frequency range.
High pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (HP-STM)
provides atomically resolved images of surfaces under high
gas pressures and during catalytic reactions35–37 (Fig. 6c). While
most spectroscopic techniques yield time-averaged information
of structure and bonding, STM detects surface dynamics when
motion of adsorbates and metal atoms occurs at speeds com-
parable to or less than the scan rate of approximately 10 mm s1.
III.b.
Study of benzene hydrogenation with high pressure
techniques
SFG vibrational spectroscopy and high pressure STM were
used to monitor the surface reaction intermediates and surface
mobility during benzene hydrogenation.38 Benzene hydrogena-
tion is an industrially relevant reaction in petroleum reﬁning and
downstream chemical processing and has two products: cyclo-
hexene and cyclohexane. SFG vibrational spectroscopy under
high-pressure benzene hydrogenation revealed three charac-
teristic vibrational bands on the Pt(111) surface, H–C–C–, vinylic
(H–C
Q
C–), and physisorbed benzene bands (Fig. 7a).38,39
Interestingly, when the surface is scanned during the reaction
turnover of benzene hydrogenation, no scanning tunneling
microscopy pictures are seen. Large scale images (B1000 A
˚ )
still reveal the same platinum steps regularly observed, but no
molecular surface structure can be resolved (Fig. 7b). This
indicates that the adsorbed monolayer of molecules and atoms
is now too mobile to be imaged with STM. The maximum
scanning speed at which high resolution images can be obtained
is 10 nm ms1, but several scans may be necessary to image an
entire molecule. Molecules that diﬀuse or adsorb/desorb on a
faster time scale than this are not able to be resolved. The
formation of this mobile overlayer also corresponds to the onset
of catalytic activity, as monitored by the mass spectrometer.37
Once the reaction stops due to surface poisoning by carbon
monoxide, ordered structures form and no reaction product is
formed (Fig. 7c). The high-coverage pure CO structure corre-
sponds to the (O19  O19) R23.41 structure.40 All benzene
adsorbates have been displaced by the strongly bound and
closely packed CO molecules. The high mobility of adsorbates
on the surface under reaction conditions is important in freeing
up active sites, which results in catalytic turnover.

Synthesis of Pt nanoparticles and development of 2D and

sites that are important for catalytic selectivity, since catalysts

a Langmuir–Blodgett trough and pulled as a monolayer ﬁlm at
various densities. This approach allows two-dimensional metal
nanoparticle arrays to be formed.41 The average inter-particle
spacing can be tuned by varying surface pressure. This ap-
proach has the advantage that size and composition of the
nanoparticles can be controlled. The formation of an oxi-
de–metal interface between nanoparticles and substrate can
also be obtained when synthesized using this colloidal process.
Various surface techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), can be
utilized to characterize chemical composition and morphology
of 2D nanoparticle arrays before and after chemical reactions.
Fig. 8 shows an SEM image of hexadecylthiol-capped Pt
nanoparticle arrays on a silicon wafer. Nanoparticles can be
incorporated in mesoporous high surface area oxides such as
SBA-15.42 A TEM image of platinum nanoparticles encapsu-
lated in mesoporous silica with a channel structure (SBA-15) is
also shown in Fig. 8. This process forms a 3-dimensional model
catalyst system with high surface area (41 m2 g1).
With stabilizing agents , the colloid nanoparticles permit us
to control the size and shape that are required to precisely
quantify catalytic inﬂuences. This is in contrast to the ap-
proach using Pt clusters to prepare conventional oxide-
supported Pt catalysts that have been used for several decades.
The nanoparticles created are within a single crystalline do-
main, meaning the particles can be created with a precise
control of both shape and size. This allows for very controlled
experiments that answer questions about the roles of steps and
kinks as reactive sites, as well as better understanding of the
role surface structure plays in determining catalytic activity
and selectivity. The porous nature of capping layers allows the
reactants and products to travel through the capping layer,
exhibiting reproducible measurements of turnover rate.
Our focus was to create platinum, rhodium or bimetallic
nanoparticles that can be produced with monodispersity and
well-controlled shape.34,42,43 Using hexachloroplatinic acid or
rhodium acetylacetonate as a precursor monomer, we could
produce monodispersed metal nanoparticles that were indivi-
dually coated with a polymer cap to prevent aggregation in
solution. As the particles nucleate and grow, they are held in a
polymer with pores sized to allow growth to 1–8 nm as shown
in Fig. 9a. Particle size is controlled by the monomer concen-
tration. With suitable changes to the growth parameters, the
shape of these particles is controlled. Fig. 9b shows cubic,
cuboctahedral, and porous Pt nanoparticles prepared using
tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) as a surface-
stabilizing reagent. By changing the pH value of the NaBH4
solution (reducing solution which contributes to control of the
reduction rate), shape evolution from cuboctahedra to cubes
was observed. Porous particles were obtained by reduction in
ascorbic acid.
IV.b.
Inﬂuence of size, shape and composition of metallic
nanoparticles on reaction activity and selectivity
Size dependence of Pt nanoparticles. Reaction selectivity is a
major focus of 21st century catalysis science. That is, if there
are several thermodynamically stable products, only one
desired product is formed.44–46 We have investigated some
typical multipath reaction selectivities: benzene and cyclo-
hexene hydrogenation. Reaction selectivity is much less
understood than reaction activity of single-product catalytic
reactions, such as ammonia synthesis or ethylene hydrogena-
tion. A very small change in competing potential energy
barriers changes the product selectivity dramatically. These
changes can be caused by structural changes or the use of
additives.

Fig. 10a and b show reaction selectivity and activation
energy for cyclohexene hydrogenation/dehydrogenation on
Pt nanoparticles in SBA-15 as a function of particle size.
These results show that benzene formation declines as particle
size increases, while cyclohexene formation remains un-
changed with changes in particle size. The activation energy
for dehydrogenation to benzene increases with increasing
particle size. This result implies that the size of the nanopar-
ticles is important for control of reaction selectivity.
Shape dependence of Pt nanoparticles. We studied the form
of benzene hydrogenation that produces cyclohexane and
cyclohexene on the platinum (111) surface and cyclohexene
on the (100) face. SFG studies on platinum (100) and (111)
identiﬁed p-allyl c-C6H9 as the most abundant reactive inter-
mediate.47 This reaction intermediate was found on the
Pt(100) surface, but not on the Pt(111) surface. This indicates
that adsorbed cyclohexene more readily dehydrogenates to
form p-allyl c-C6H9 on the Pt(100) surface than on the Pt(111)
surface.
This face speciﬁcity of benzene hydrogenation makes it
suitable for probing nanoparticle shape-dependent reaction
selectivity. Benzene hydrogenation studies on cuboctahedra
and cubic Pt nanoparticles capped with TTAB demonstrated
that cyclohexene and cyclohexane formed on cuboctahedral
nanoparticles, while only cyclohexane formed on cubic nano-
particles, consistent with previous results for single-crystal Pt
surfaces (Fig. 11).46 This study indicates the importance of
nanoparticle shape in determining reaction selectivity.
Composition dependence of catalytic reaction rates of bime-
tallic nanoparticles. Composition is another important factor
that inﬂuences catalytic activity and selectivity. Pt–Rh bime-
tallic nanoparticles with variable composition and constant
size (9  1 nm) were synthesized by a one-pot polyol synthetic
method.48 The activity of CO oxidation on these bimetallic
nanoparticles was studied.49
Colloid techniques are used to take chloroplatinic acid or a
rhodium precursor (like rhodium acetylacetonate) in the pre-
sence of a polymer (PVP). These metal ions are then reduced in
alcohol. Fig. 12b shows the TEM images of monodispersed
Rh0.4Pt0.6 nanoparticles. The size was 9.3  1.2 nm, which was
determined by measuring 150 nanocrystals from a TEM image.
Once monodispersed particles with the desired size and compo-
sition are obtained, we can put them in a Langmuir trough and
apply a certain surface pressure to deposit diﬀerent densities of
nanoparticle monolayer ﬁlms. Fig. 12a shows the XPS spectra
measured on two dimensional RhxPt1x (x = 0–1) nanoparticle
arrays on a silicon surface. We found that the intensity of the

Rh3d peak increases, while the Pt4f and Pt4d peaks decrease as
the composition of Rh increases.
We found that the turnover rate of a pure Rh nanoparticle is
20 times that of a Pt nanoparticle under the reaction condi-
tions used (100 Torr O2, 40 Torr CO at 180 1C). RhxPt1x
(x = 0.2–0.8) particles exhibit an intermediate activity as
shown in Fig. 12c, while the activation energy increases from
25 to 27 kcal mol1 with increasing rhodium content.
The observation that pure Rh nanoparticles are more
reactive than Pt nanoparticles is consistent with the earlier
CO oxidation studies on thin ﬁlms50 and single crystals.30,51 It
is associated with diﬀerences in the initial dissociative sticking
probability of oxygen (Pt is 0.2 and Rh is 1.0).52,53 As shown in
Fig. 12c, the reactivity of CO oxidation increases nonlinearly
as a function of Rh composition. This tendency could be due
to preferential migration of Pt to the surface, giving rise to a
higher surface concentration of Pt compared to the bulk
concentration.54 The results demonstrate the possibility of
controlling catalytic activity in metal nanoparticle–oxide sys-
tems via tuning the composition of the nanoparticles.
V.
Correlations and future directions
It is necessary to use in situ, surface sensitive techniques
(SFG and STM) to monitor nanoparticles as they undergo
reactions, just as single crystal surfaces were monitored during
chemical reactions,34 as shown in the schematic in Fig. 13. The
SFG studies of pyridine hydrogenation were successful in
detecting pyridinium cation (C5H5NH+) reaction intermedi-
ates on TTAB covered platinum nanoparticles and the forma-
tion of fully hydrogenated piperidine molecules as reaction
products in the gas phase.55 Preliminary studies using STM
indicate that the metal nanoparticles cannot be imaged
because of the polymer capping. Work is in progress to remove
the polymer capping to prepare the exposed nanoparticles for
STM studies.
Enzyme catalysts, homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts
are all nanoparticles. For example, cytochrome C has a 4 nm
catalytic site, where inside the protein ligands are 1.4 nm in
size. A single site oleﬁn polymerization catalyst, which is
homogeneous, is 1.6 nm in size. Platinum nanoparticles are
available that are active in the 1–10 nm regime.
Nature and technology produce catalysts on the nanometre
scale because the small number of atoms permits the ﬂexible
rearrangement of atomic position in the catalyst. Rearranging
the catalyst surface requires breaking metal–metal bonds
which requires energy. When a metal atom has fewer neigh-
bors, as would be the case in a nanoparticle, less energy is
required for rearrangement to occur. The reacting molecules,
reaction intermediates and products must alter their bond
distances to rearrange rapidly. Reaction is favored when a
relatively small number of bonds of the reacting molecules
need to be broken and reformed. Catalysis takes place more
easily in a nanoparticle form, where less atoms and molecules
participate in the restructuring during the catalytic turnover.
The unique catalytic properties of nanoparticles and capability
of controlling catalytic activity and selectivity by tuning their
shape, size and composition can bring new opportunities in
fundamental understanding of molecular surface chemistry
and in major chemical energy conversion technologies.
