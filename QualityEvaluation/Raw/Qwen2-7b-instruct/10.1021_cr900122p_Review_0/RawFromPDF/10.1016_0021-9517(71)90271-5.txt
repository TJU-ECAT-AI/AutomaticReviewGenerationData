Adsorption 
of Hydrogen 
and Hz-D2 
Exchange 
Reaction 
on Alumina*

Received October 19, 1970 
The chemisorption 
of hydrogen on alumina was investigated 
over a wide range 
of temperatures 
(-196-45O”C). 
At 
least five 
different 
states of chemisorbed 
hydrogen on alumina 
were detected by the temperature-programmed 
desorption 
a+~ 
peaks with the peak maxima at about -40: 25, 100, 200, and 320°C. These peaks 
(or types) are referred to as H(I), 
H(II), 
H(III), 
H(IV), 
and H(V), 
respectively. 
Except for H(IV), 
each type of chemisorption was separately investigated in more 
detail by measuring either the isotherms or the rates of adsorption and desorption. 
H(1) is the weakest chemisorpt,ion which occurs rapidly 
and reversibly 
at -75°C 
and fits the dissociative 
Lnngmuir 
isotherm. 
At room temperature, 
H(H) 
and 
H(II1) 
are the major chcmisorption: 
The former is a reversible 
chemisorption 
which is equilibrated 
in 30 min, while the latter is a slow irreversible chemisorption 
which continues up to 70 hr at room temperature. H(V), 
the strongest chemisorp- 
tion, is too slow to be detected at. temperatures below 25O”C, but it is the major 
adsorption at higher temperatures. The total number of active sites for chemisorp- 
tion was found to be 1.9 X 10” sites/c.m’. The experimental 
results indicate that 
at least four types of chemisorption, 
H(1). H(III), 
H(IV), 
and H(V), 
sha.rc all 
or part of the sites which are the surface defects of alumina. 
Isotopic 
exchange of hydrogen and deuterium 
was also studied in connection 
with the above results. Two kinds of reactions were carried out: (1) surface-exchange 
reaction between various types of preadsorbed H, on alumina and D? in the gas 
phase; and (2) equilibration 
reaction of gaseous mixtures of H? and DZ but without 
preadsorption. 
The results shoKed that at low temperatucs 
the isotopic-exchange 
reaction-occurred 
only through hydrogen 
involve the other tppps of chemisorption 
Since it WM dcnlonstrated 
I)y Helm ant1 
Blue (1) that alumina 
was an active cat- 
alyst 
for Hz-D2 
equilibration 
reaction, 
a 
number of investigations 
have been made 
to clarify 
the mechanisms of equilibrat’ion 
and 
ortho-para 
conversion 
reactions 
of 
hydrogen on alumina 
(S-5). Recently Yasu- 
mori and Ohno (6) studied the kinetics 
of 
these reactions on y-alumina 
in detail, and 
showed that 
their 
results were cxplaincd 
by the rate equations

and Hall 
(7) also made an extensive study of cqui- 
lib&ion 
and 
conversion 
reactions

particular 
emphasis on active 
centers of 
alumina 
by using CO2 as a poison. Al- 
though much more work is needed to draw 
a definite conclusion on the mechanisms of 
the reactions, it seems to be generally 
ac- 
ccpted that the activity 
of alumina sharply 
incrcasw 
when the catalyst. is pretreated 
at, temperatures 
higher than about 4OO”C, 
and that the equilibration 
and conversion 
reactions both proceed on a small fraction 
of the surface. These facts apparently 
in- 
dicate that the reactions take place on de- 
fcctr of alumina 
surface.

Investigation 
of the adsorption 
of hy- 
drogen on alumina was started much earlier 
than of the isotopic-equilibration 
reaction, 
and several 
papers have been published 
(8-16). 
In 
these investigations, 
different 
experimental 
conditions 
were used, and it 
is, therefore, difficult 
to draw general con- 
clusions, except that the chemisorption 
of 
hydrogen 
on alumina 
is generally 
slow. 
Gruber (11) suggested two different types of 
chemisorption. 
Dolidze, 
et al. (12) found 
that the order of adsorption 
rate changed 
from 1 to 0.5 when the pressure of hy- 
drogen was increased. They explained their 
results by assuming the existence of two 
different 
sites and the migration 
of hy- 
drogen atoms from one site to the other. 
Low and Argano 
(14) measured the rate 
of adsorption 
at very 
low pressures and 
over a wide range of temperature, 
and con- 
cluded that some dissociative 
chemisorption 
occurred over the entire temperature 
range 
(-193 
to 663°C). 
The latter 
two papers 
suggested very small surface coverages by 
hydrogen. The preliminary 
results obtained 
by Cvetanovic 
and Amenomiya 
(16’) with 
the use of temperature-programmed 
de- 
sorption 
suggested a complex character of 
the hydrogen-alumina 
system. 
No experimental 
attempt, 
however, has 
been made to obtain 
correlation 
between 
the adsorption and the reaction of hydrogen 
isotopes. In view of this, it was thought of 
interest 
to investigate 
the adsorption 
of 
hydrogen 
on alumina 
in more detail with 
the 
aid of the temperature-programmed 
desorption 
technique 
and to study the re- 
action of hydrogen 
isotopes in connection 
with the results obtained from the adsorp- 
tion 
study. 
Two kinds 
of reactions 
were 
examined: reaction between H, preadsorhed 
on alumina 
and Dz in the gas phase (SW- 
face exchange), 
and reaction 
of gaseous 
mixtures 
of H, and D, without 
preadsorp- 
tion 
(equilibration). 
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 
Materials 
The 
preparation 
of alumina 
has been 
described in detail previously 
(17). It was 
prepared 
by the hydrolysis 
of aluminum 
isopropoxide, 
calcined 
in air for 3 hr at 
600°C and finally 
evacuated in the reactor 
for several hours at 650°C. X-Ray 
analysis 
showed that the alumina 
thus treated was 
mainly 
y-alumina. 
The 
amount 
of cat- 
alyst used for the measurements of adsorp- 
tion 
and surface 
exchange 
reaction 
was 
0.5-l g, and that for equilibration 
reaction 
was 1.0 mg. The surface area of each cat- 
alyst was measured by BET with nitrogen 
except for the equilibrium 
reaction. 
The 
average was 180 m”/g after the above pre- 
treatment. 
A 
Na,CO,-poisoned 
alumina 
was also used for 
comparison. 
Alumina 
taken from the same batch was dried at 
420°C and soaked in an 0.1 N solution 
of 
Na2C03 for 16 hr. It was dried in an oven 
without 
filtering, 
calcined, 
and evacuated 
in the same manner as unpoisoned alumnia. 
Chemical 
analysis 
showed that the alkali 
content was 6.1 wt s as Na2C03, and the 
surface area was 175 m”/g. 
The catalyst 
was evacuated for l-2 
hr 
at 600°C after each run, and this treatment 
usually 
gave reproducible 
results for both 
adsorption 
and reaction. When a deactiva- 
tion of catalyst was indicated, 
the catalyst 
was treated with dry air for a few hours at 
600°C followed 
by evacuation 
at 650°C. 
The catalyst 
activity 
was completely 
re- 
covered by this treatment. 
All gases used in the present study were 
purchased from Matheson 
of Canada, Ltd. 
TJltrahigh-purity 
grade 
of 
hydrogen 
(99.999% \ 
and 
C. P. grade 
deuterium 
(99.5%) were both passed through a spira1 
type trap immersed in liquid 
nitrogen 
and 
stored in reservoirs. HD was the only im- 
purity 
detected by gas chromatography 
in 
the deirtcrium. 
Prepurified 
grade nitrogen 
(99.997$&) was used as carrier gas for the 
temperature-programmed 
desorption 
after 
passing through a molecular sieve trap and 
a glass bead trap in series, both cooled in 
liquid 
nitrogen. 
Apparatus 
and Procedure 
The 
apparatus 
used 
for 
the 
present 
study was essentially 
the same as used for

the study of the deuteration 
of ethylene on 
alumina 
(18). It consisted of three parts: 
a conventional 
static system for adsorption 
measurements; 
a temperature-programmed 
desorption 
system in which 
the gas ad- 
sorbed on the catalyst 
was later dcsorbed 
into a carrier gas stream (NJ 
by heating 
the catalyst in a programmed manner; and 
a reaction system in which t’he reactant gas 
was circulated 
through a reactor which was 
common for all the systems. A mercury 
manometer 
and a cathetometer 
were used 
at first 
to measure adsorption, 
but they 
were later replaced by a capacitance pres- 
sure transducer 
(a Type 523 sensor with a 
Type 1023 control unit of Datametrics 
Inc., 
Mass.) so that. the pressure change during 
the adsorption 
was continuously 
recorded. 
Thus the rate of adsorption 
as well as the 
adsorbed amount was convenient.ly 
meas- 
ured. The temperature-programmed 
dcsorp- 
tion 
(TPD) 
has been described in detail 
elsewhere (16). In t,he present cxprriments, 
a thermistor 
type thermal condurtivity 
cell 
was used as the TPD detector. The volume 
of reaction 
system was about 140 ml in- 
cluding 
a small all-glass 
circulation 
pump 
(single 
plunger 
type) 
operated 
by 
an 
electromagnet. 
Adsorption 
of hydrogen 
was measured 
inanometrically 
in a constant 
volume 
as 
already described. After adsorption the cat- 
alyst, was evacuated 
under various 
con- 
ditions, 
and the carrier 
gas was diverted 
into the reactor for TPD. TPD was carried 
out. at a speed of 18.5 f 
l”C/min 
regulated 
by a programmer with a flow rate of nitro- 
gen of about 270 ml/min 
at the pressure in 
the reactor 
(70 Torr). 
The average resi- 
dence time of gas in the catalyst, bed was 
about. 0.2 set at this flow rate. When the 
heating 
was started 
from 
a temperature 
lower than room temperature, 
the cataIyst 
was allowed to warm up naturally 
to room 
temperature 
so that 
t’he t,emperature 
in- 
creasr in this range was not necessarily 
linear. 
However, 
the heating 
curve 
was 
smooth, and peaks were still 
clearly 
sep- 
arated. The amount of hydrogen 
desorbed 
by TPD 
was calculated 
from the peak 
area hv comparison 
with 
those of known 
amounts 
of hydrogen 
passed through 
the 
detector 
before 
and 
after 
each 
TPD 
experiment. 
Surface-exchange 
reaction 
was carried 
out, by circulating 
deuterium 
gas through 
the reactor with 
about 1 g of catalyst 
on 
which hydrogen was preadsorbed. The pre- 
adsorption 
and the following 
evacuation 
were made at selected temperatures so that 
desired type (s) of chemisorbed 
hydrogen 
remained 
on the surface 
The amount of 
preadsorbed hydrogen 
n-as estimated from 
a separate TPD 
experiment 
carried 
out 
under similar 
conditions. 
The reaction was 
stopped by isolating 
t,he reactor from the 
circulation 
system 
by closing 
stopcocks. 
The volume of reactor was about 10% of 
that of whole system. The product was col- 
lected from the circulation 
system into a 
sampler by means of a Toepler pump, and 
transferred 
to a gas cl~romatograph 
for 
analysis. 
The isotopes of hydrogen 
were 
analyzed 
gas chromatographically 
with 
a 
j&Cl,-coated 
alumina column as described 
previously 
(18). 
Equilibration 
reaction 
was carried 
out 
in the same manner as in the surface ex- 
change, except that 
approximately 
equi- 
molar 
mixtures 
of H, and D, were cir- 
culated 
over 1.0 mg of catalyst 
without 
preadsorption. 
Before the measurements of 
t.he rates, it was found with 1 g of catalyst 
at room 
temperature 
that 
the 
reaction 
product 
was already 
equilibrated 
after 
1 
min, indicat’ing 
that the pump was efficient 
enough to homogenize gas in whole system 
at least in 1 min. Actual 
reactions 
were 
carried out, with the much smaller amount 
of cat,alyst 
11.0 mg) at, longer times 
(5- 
30 min), 
and the products were not equi- 
librated, 
assuring 
that, the reaction 
waq 
not controlled 
bv the pump speed. In both 
the surface exchange and the equilibrat.ion 
reactions, a few Torr of He was admitted 
in the reactor 
and evacuated 
briefly 
im- 
mediately 
before reaction in order to cool 
(or 
warm) 
the 
catalyst’ 
quickly 
to 
a 
selected reaction temperature. 
The catalyst 
temperature was also matched by a thermo- 
couple inserted 
at the center of catalyst 
bed.

RESULTS 
AND I>ISCUSSION 
I. Adsorption 
of Hydrogen 
(1) Temperature-Programmed 
Desorption 
When hydrogen was admit’ted at -196”C, 
hydrogen adsorbed very rapIcIly, and after 
evacuation 
at the same temperature, 
the 
subsequent 
TPD 
gave a peak at about 
--1lO”C 
as shown by TPD 
chromatogram 
(a) in Fig. 1. This peak is referred to as 
H(P). 
In the following, 
the other peaks 
observed will 
be similarly 
referred 
to as 
H(i) 
(i = I - V) without 
additional 
iden- 
tification 
since they are clearly 
indicated 
in Fig. 1. H(P) 
peak is believed to be due 
to a physical 
adsorption, 
because hydrogen 
was easily 
removed even at -196°C 
by 
extended cvacuat.ion, 
and also the surface 
coverage at high pressures far exceeded the 
number of chemisorptive 
sites which 
will 
be discussed later. 
Hydrogen 
adsorbed 
also 
rapidly 
at 
-75”C, 
and the subsequent 
TPD 
gave 
Chromatogram 
(b) in Fig. 1, where two 
peaks, H (I) and H (II), 
appeared at about 
-40°C 
and 25”C, respectively. 
H(1) 
ad- 
sorption was reversible and easily removed 
by evacuation 
at -75”C, 
while H(I1) 
was 
not removed at this temperature. 
During 
adsorption at -75”C, 
however, the amount 
of H(I) 
adsorbed was much larger than 
that of H(U) 
which occurred very slowly 
at -75°C. 
When hydrogen 
was adsorbed at tem- 
peratures 
between room temperature 
and 
lOO”C, a slow adsorption 
took place, and 
afief evacuation 
at room temperature, 
the 
subsequent 
TPD 
gave a peak at about 
100°C (H (III) 
) as shown by Chromato- 
gram (c) in Fig. 1. This adsorption was so 
slow that. it took more than 70 hr at room 
temperature 
and at 50 Torr 
of hydrogen 
until 
no appreciable 
change in pressure 
was observed. It was found, however, that 
t.here was always a difference between the 
adsorbed amount and the amount desorbed 
by TPD, suggesting that a part of adsorp- 
tion 
was reversible 
and removed 
during 
evacuation 
at. room temperat.ure. Assuming 
that 
the above difference 
roughly 
repre- 
sented the amount 
of t’he reversible 
ad- 
rorption, 
it was found that the adsorption 
was saturated in 30 min when the pressure 
was higher than 30 Torr. The upper limit 
of the saturation 
was estimat’ed as 7 X 10” 
molecules/cm?. This adsorption 
is believed 
to be type H(U), 
as will 
be discussed in 
somewhat 
more detail 
in 
the 
following 
section. 
It is seen in the Chromatogram 
(c) in 
Fig. 1 that a small shoulder appeared at 
FIG. 1. TPD chromatograms 
of hydrogen 
on alumina. 
Adsorption 
and evacuation 
before:TPD 
were carried 
out as listed in the figure. Hydrogen 
pressure for adsorption 
was about 40 Torr 
except for (f) which was 
obtained 
with 
150 Torr of hydrogen.

about 200°C following 
the H(III) 
peak. 
Thij 
peak, H (IV), 
became clearer when 
hydrogen was adsorbed at 15O”C, as shown 
by Chromatogram 
(d). In this experiment, 
hydrogen was adsorbed for 1 hr at 150°C 
and at 40 Torr, and the catalyst was cooled 
to room temperature 
and kept at the same 
temperature 
for 22 hr with 
the hydrogen 
present before evacuation 
for TPD. 
Finally 
when the adsorption temperature 
was increased higher than 25O”C, the fifth 
peak, H(V), 
appeared at about 32O”C, as 
shown by Chromatograms 
(c) and (f) in 
Fig. 1. Before the TPD of Chromatogram 
(f), hydrogen 
was adsorbed for 2.5 hr at 
450°C and at 150 Torr followed 
by 20 hr 
adsorption 
at room temperature. 
The cat- 
alyst 
was then 
cooled to -150°C 
and 
evacuated 
briefly 
before TPD. 
Therefore, 
the other peaks, H(1) 
to H(N), 
appeared 
as well as H(V), 
and no chemisorbed hy- 
drogen 
was lost 
during 
the evacuation. 
Other experiments 
were also carried out in 
the same manner but at, different 
pressures 
and adsorption 
times, and it was found 
that the amount of hydrogen 
dcsorbed by 
TPD 
was approximately 
the same as in 
if) 
in Fig. 1 (9.7 X 1012 molecules/cm2), 
indicating 
that the surface was saturated 
by chemisorbed hydrogen. 
Sometimes the TPD 
experiments 
were 
carried out with a liquid 
nitrogen 
trap in- 
scrt.ed between the reactor and the TPD 
detector to check if water was formed by 
hydrogen 
chemisorption. 
However, no con- 
densable gas in the trap or change in the 
shape of the peaks was found even with 
the strongest chemisorption, 
H(V) . 
Summarizing 
the results of temperature- 
programmed desorption, five different types 
of chemisorption, 
H(I), 
to H(V), 
were 
found 
a~+ 
ncll 
as a physical 
adsorption, 
H(P) . \\‘hen hydrogen was contacted with 
alumina 
at 
temperatures 
varying 
from 
room temperature 
to 45O”C, however, hy- 
drogen chemisorbed mainly as types H (III) 
and H(V) 
in general agrecmtnt 
with 
the 
results of Gruber 
(11), who suggested two 
different 
types of chemisorption 
of hydro- 
gen on alumina from the observed minima 
in the isobars at about 3OO”C, as already 
mentioned. 
(2) 
Adsorption 
of Hydroyen 
a. Type H(1). 
As already 
pointed out, 
adsorption occurring at -75°C 
was mainly 
of Type 
H(I), 
and it took 
place very 
rapidly, 
while 
H(I1) 
was so slow at this 
temperature 
that its amount was negligibly 
small coml)arcd to that of H(1). 
It was, 
therefore, 
possible 
to measure the H(I) 
adsorption 
manometrically, 
and 
an iso- 
therm was measured at -75°C 
by increas- 
ing pressure from 2 to 46 Torr 
and also 
by decreasing pressure. All points thus ob- 
tained 
fell on the same curve, indicating 
that 
the adsorption 
was quite 
reversible. 
It was also found that 
the isotherm 
was 
well expressed by t,he Langmuir 
equation 
for dissociative 
adsorpt,ion, 
as shown in 
Fig. 
2. The 
saturated 
amount,

calculated 
from the intercept

as 9.7 X 10’” atoms/cm’. The heat of ad- 
sorption calculated from the isotherms at 
-75 and -123°C was 3.5 k 0.5 kcal/mole 
and was almost constant between 0 = 0.25 
and 0.65. 
b. Types H( II) 
and H( III). 
In the pre- 
ceding section it has been suggested from 
the difference between the adsorbed amount 
and the amount desorbed by TPD that two 
types of chemisorption are occurring si- 
multaneously 
during 
the adsorption 
at 
room temperature. This was also indicated 
by 
an 
irregularity 
in 
adsorption-time 
curves which usually occurred at 10-30 
min after the admission of hydrogen, de- 
pending on the pressure. 
In order to see this matter more clearly, 
the rates of adsorption and desorption were 
respectively evaluated from the adsorption- 
time (a-t) curves obtained at various pres- 
sures by a method published previously 
(19). In this method, da/& is first obtained 
from a-t curves measured at various pres- 
sures (p), and then da/dt 
at the same a 
is plotted against a function of p (usually 
p), so that the plot is a straight line. The 
slope of the straight line then gives the 
rate of adsorption (TJ at 1 Torr and the 
negative intercept the rate of desorption 
(ra) at this adsorbed amount. Some of the 
results thus obtained with the present Hz- 
alumina system are shown in Fig. 3 of the 
previous paper (19). In the present study, 
however, the method was extended over 
wider range of surface coverage by using 
the capacitance pressure transducer con- 
nected with a recorder which was useful 
particularly 
for fast adsorption in the 
initial stage. da/dt was calculated by ap- 
proximating 
a portion of a-t curve (the 
period of l-10 min depending on the rate 
of adsorption) to a cubic equation a = 
Bt + Ct” + Dt” and by setting a program 
with a Monroe Epic 3000 calculator to 
obtain du/dt 
as the first derivative of the 
equation. 
A good linearity was found for the plot 
of da/dt 
against p, and the net rates of 
adsorption and desorption thus obtained 
at room temperature are shown in Fig. 3 
as a function of the adsorbed amount. It 
is now clearly shown that the different 
types of adsorption are occurring simul- 
taneously, a fast and a slow adsorption 
whose rates differ by about two orders of 
magnitude. The fast adsorption is equil- 
ibrated in 10-30 min at room temperature, 
while the slow adsorption continues up to 
more than 70 hr, as already described. The 
former is easily removed by evacuation

at room temperature, 
because it has an 
appreciable 
rate of desorption at this tem- 
perature, 
as shown in Fig. 3. 
An advantage 
of this analytical 
method 
is that du/dt is compared at different pres- 
sures but at the same surface coverage, so 
that the method can be applied whet.her or 
not the surface is homogeneous, and also the 
isotherm 
is constructed 
by calculating 
t,he 
equilibrium 
pressures by equalizing 
~~ and 
rd at each surface coverage. The isotherm 
of the fast 
adsorption 
thus 
constructed 
showed that 
the adsorbed amounts 
were 
all reasonably within 
the saturated amount 
(7 X 10” molecules/cm?) 
estimated in the 
preceding 
section, but at least one order 
of magnitude 
larger than the amounts of 
H(1) 
extrapolat,ed 
to room temperature. 
It was therefore 
concluded 
that the fast 
(reversible) 
adsorpt’ion 
observed at room 
temperature 
was not type H(I) 
but H (II) 
chemisorption 
which was detected by TPD 
at about 25°C. 
c. Type H(V). 
Unfort’unately 
the ad- 
sorption of H(IV) 
did not take place with- 
out accompanying 
simultaneous 
adsorption 
of either H(II1) 
or H(V) 
as was under- 
standable 
from the extensive 
overlapping 
of the corresponding 
peaks shown in Fig. 1. 
Therefore 
this type of chemisorption 
could 
not bc studied 
separately. 
However, 
only 
type 
(V) 
chemisorption 
was expect.ed to occur 
at temperatures 
higher than 300°C where other chemisorp- 
tion would either be negligibly 
small or be 
quicklv 
equilibrated 
and, therefore, 
would 
not affect the evaluation 
of da/dt. 
It was 
found from the results obtained 
at 300°C 
t,hat 
du/dt 
showed 
the 
best 
linearity 
against P*.~ over a pressure range between 
0.3 and 10 Torr 
for t’he surface coverage 
from 0.02 to 0.13. The average activation 
energy 
of 
adsorption 
was estimated 
as 
about 13 kcal/mole 
from the rates at 300 
and 350°C. Unfortunately 
the evaluation 
of the desorption 
rate was not accurate 
enough 
to obt.ain the activation 
energy. 
It 
was reported 
by Dolidge 
et al. 
(12) 
that the rate of adsorption 
of hydrogen on 
~-alumina 
was proport,ional 
t.o p”.5 with an 
activation 
energy of 19.5 kcal/mole. 
Low 
and Argano 
(14) also reported 
the same 
pressure dependence with 
1.25-4.27 kcal/ 
mole of activation 
energy. 
Both 
results 
were explained 
by a lateral 
diffusion 
of 
hydrogen 
atoms on the surface. However, 
the pressure dependence was obtained 
in 
a small 
pressure 
range 
by 
the 
former 
authors 
and only 
at 27°C by the latter. 
Mechanism 
which 
explains 
the 
present 
kinetics 
is not yet known. 
(3) Sites for Chemisoyption 
The experimental 
results described above 
provide 
the saturated 
amounts 
of mono- 
layer 
adsorption 
for 
various 
types 
of 
chemisorption. 
Although 
it 
is not 
clear, 
except perhaps for H(I), 
whether 
hydro- 
gen is adsorbed 
as atoms or molecules, 
the site densities 
summarized 
in Table 
1 
have been calculated 
by tentatively 
as- 
suming that 
all adsorption 
is atomic. 
In 
view of the method of assessment used, it 
is likely that the number of sites for H(I1) 
is not as accurate as for the other types 
of rhemisorption. 
The 
t’otal 
number 
of 
sites 
(1.9 X 1013) includes 
all 
types 
of 
chemisorption 
but are occupied mainly 
by 
hydrogen chemieorbed as types H(II1) 
and 
H(V). 
A comparison 
of the Chromato-

the peak H(IIIj

(e) where type H(V) 
was first formed on 
the surface at higher 
adsorption 
temper- 
atures. This fact suggests that the chemi- 
sorption 
of H(IIIj 
and H(V) 
takes place 
on the same sites but in different 
forms. 
The same argument can probably 
be made 
also for H(II1) 
and H (IV) 
from a com- 
parison 
of Chromatograms 
(c) 
and 
(d) 
in the same figure. 
Chromatograms 
(c), 
(d), and (e) were all obtained with about 
the same pressure and time for adsorption, 
while 
(f) was obt#ained with exceptionally 
high pressure of hydrogen. 
The above view was further 
confirmed 
by a more quantitative 
comparison of two 
experiments 
in which 
(1) hydrogen 
was 
adsorbed at room temperature 
and at 45 
Torr 
on a fresh surface of alumina, 
and 
(2) hydrogen 
was adsorbed at the same 
temperature 
and pressure but on the alu- 
mina on which 
9.2 X 1Ol2 at.oms/cm’ 
hy- 
drogen 
had 
been preadsorbed 
as type 
H(V). 
In the latter 
experiment 
hydrogen 
was preadsorbed 
at 250°C and evacuated 
at 150°C so that only type H(V) 
was left 
on the surface, as was confirmed in a TPD 
experiment 
carried 
out 
separately 
but 
under similar 
conditions. 
After 
the same 
a&orption 
time 
(between 2 and 60 min) 
the 
adsorbed 
amount 
of 
hydrogen 
at 
room temperature 
(H(II1)) 
in 
(1) was 
const.antly 
larger t.han in (2) by a factor 
of 2.0 t 0.1. Taking 
1.9 X 10’” atoms/cm’ 
from Table 1 as the total number of sites, 
the preadsorbed H(V) 
(9.2 X lo? 
shows 
a 52% availability 
of the sites for H(III) 
ehcmisorption 
in Expt. 2, which is in rea- 
sonable agreement with 
the above factor 
of 2. 
The 
mutual 
imerference 
of H(1) 
and 
H(III), 
or H(V) 
was also studied by de- 
termining 
vv,,s from the isotherms 
meas- 
ured at -75°C 
on alumina 
on which hy- 
drogen 
had 
been preadsorbed 
as types 
H (III) 
and H(V), 
respectively. 
It 
was 
found that one atom of preadsorhed H(fI1) 
or H(V) 
blocked about 0.5 sites for H(I) 
chemisorption. 
although 
H (III) 
was 
slightly 
more effective 
for blockincr than 
was H(V). 
This 
ratio is close to that of 
the site densities found in Table 1 for the 
total 
and H(I) 
chemisorption. 
The 
for- 
malisticaliy 
simplest 
way to explain 
this 
ratio would be to assume that types H(II1) 
and H(V) 
arc molecular adsorption. It was 
also found in the TPD experiments carried 
out at a constant speed of 18.5”/min 
that 
the peak temperature 
of H(II1) 
remained 
constant at 97 + 3°C over a wide range of 
surface 
coverage 
between 
B = 0.04 and 
0.52, suggesting that the desorption process 
was first order (Ifi). 
It’ is unlikely, 
how- 
ever, that such strong chemisorptions 
take 
place in a simple molecular 
form. Instead 
it seems more likely 
that 
the sites for 
H (III) 
and H(V) 
consist of a pair 
of 
defects only 
on one of which 
hydrogen 
can chemisorb as type H(I). 
For example, 
H (III) 
hydrogen 
chemisorbs in a quasi- 
atomic state, one on top of the aluminum 
ion and the other on top of the oxide ion, 
but there is still 
interaction 
between the 
atoms. In this case, desorption would take 
place as a first-order 
process. Similar type 
of chemisorption 
of hydrogen 
on alumina 
was postulated 
by Pines and Ravoire 
(4,. 
However, the ratio of 2 found here may be 
fortuitous, 
and certainly 
more experimental 
information 
is needed to draw a definite 
conclusion on the nature of these sites. 
The total number of active sites for the 
chemisorption 
of hydrogen 
(2 x 10’” sites/ 
cm”) is still 
only a small fraction 
of the 
total 
surface, 
indicating 
t.hat. these sites 
are the defects of alumina 
surface. When 
the alumina 
was evacuated 
at increasing 
temperatures 
from 530 to 65O”C, the total 
number 
of active 
sites was increased by 
about 3.5 t’imes. It is also of interest that 
the number 
of total 
sites for hydrogen 
chemisorption 
found in the present study 
is in range of total 
acidity 
(l-5 x 1Ol3 
sites/cm2) 
found 
on alumina

authors

has, in principle, 
an advantage 
over the 
above combination, 
if an appreciable 
ex- 
change takes place between hydrogen 
in 
the gas phase and that 
of the catalyst. 
However, 
the results with 
D, gas and the 
catalyst 
showed that 
such exchange was 
negligibly 
small at and below room tem- 
perature. 
Hall 
et al. (24) also found that 
the exchange rate of the catalyst hydrogen 
in alumina 
with 
deuterium 
gas was neg- 
ligible at temperatures 
below about 140°C. 
Moreover, 
hydrogen 
isotopes eluted 
from 
the gas chromatographic 
column 
in the 
order H,, 
HD, 
D,, 
so that 
an accurate 
analysis 
of a small peak of HD following 
a large peak of H2 was difficult. 
Therefore, 
the preadsorbed D, was used only in a few 
cases where the reaction 
temperature 
was 
very high. 
The results obtained 
are summarized 
in 
Table 
2, which 
also includes 
the result 
of an equilibration 
reaction with a mixt,ure 
of H, and D, for comparison. 
As seen in 
the table, the equilibration 
reaction, Expt. 
23 proceeded rapidly 
at -i’5’C, 
and t.he 
product was equilibrated 
at least, in 5 min: 
The value of [HD]?/[H,l 
ID,] 
calculated 
from the composition 
of the product 
was 
2.99, which agreed well with the theoretical 
equilibrium 
constant 
(2.85‘1 at -75°C 
cal- 
culated 
from the equation 
K = 4.24 exp 
(-157/RT) 
(25). On the other hand, no 
HD was formed within 
experimental 
error 
by the surface exchange reaction with hy- 
drogen chemisorbed 
as types H(II1) 
and 
H(V) 
even at higher 
temperatures 
and 
longer times. The data listed in Table 
2 
were all corrected 
for HD 
contained 
as 
impurity 
in the reactant 
D,. In Expt. 55, 
hydrogen 
was preadsorbcd 
at room tem- 
peraturc 
and the reactor was closed with 
some 4.4 Torr 
of hydrogen 
remaining 
in 
the gas phase while 
the rest of the re- 
action 
system 
was evacuated 
and filled 
with I),. Thcreforc, 
the total amount pre- 
adsorbed and the amount 
of gaseous H, 
were 
accurately 
measured 
although 
t,he 
distribution 
of H(I1) 
and 
H (III) 
was 
estimated 
from the results 
of adsorption 
experiments 
described 
in 
t.he preceding 
sections. The hydrogen left in the gas phase 
in the reactor was, of course, mixed with 
deuterium 
in the gas phase as soon as the 
reaction 
was started. 
The result 
showed 
t,hat only this amount of H, (the amount 
left, in t,lic gas phase) was converted into 
HD, 
indicating 
that H(I1) 
hydrogen 
was 
also not eligible 
for the surface exchange 
at least at -75°C. 
It might be feared that 
in these reactions the prcadsorbed hydrogen 
blocked the active sites and thus retarded 
reaction. However, 
the maximum 
coverage 
by the prradsorbed 
hydrogen 
(0.30 ml/ 
0.976 g) was 44% of the total active sitcx, 
and the reaction

proportional 
to the available sites. It should 
also be noted 
that 
a small 
amount 
of 
H (IV) 
was preadsorbed as well as H(M) 
listed 
in Table 2, as was predicted 
from 
the Chromatogram 
(c) in Fig. 
1. There- 
fore type H(IV) 
is also inactive 
for the 
exchange reaction. 
A similar 
procedure 
for preadsorption 
was used in Expt. 
(53) as was used in 
Expt. 
55 except for the temperature 
of 
preadsorption 
(-75°C). 
At this temper- 
ature, only H(1) 
hydrogen was present on 
the surface, although 
a very small amount 
of H(II) 
might have been present as well 
in view 
of the TPD 
Chromatogram 
(b) 
in Fig. 
1. Table 
2 shows that 
the total 
amount of H atoms found in the product 
corresponded to 0.140 ml of H,, which ex- 
ceeded the hydrogen 
left in the gas phase 
(0.097) and was close to the total of H, 
present initially. 
This 
fact suggests that 
hydrogen 
chemisorbed 
as type 
H (I) 
is 
involved 
in the surface-exchange 
reaction. 
Since H(1) 
chemisorption 
is reversible 
at 
-75”C, 
as already pointed out, considera- 
tion must be given to the possibility 
that 
hydrogen 
desorbs from the sites and re- 
adsorbs as another type of chemisorption 
for the reaction. However, H(1) was found 
to be the sole chemisorption 
occurring 
at 
-75”C, 
and the results of Table 2 showed 
that 
other 
types 
of chemisorption 
were 
not involved 
in the exchange reaction 
at 
this low temperature. 
It is, therefore, con- 
cluded 
that 
the exchange reaction 
takes 
place by hydrogen 
chemisorbed 
as type 
H(I), 
at least at low temperatures. 
Although 
the stronger adsorptions 
were 
not involved 
in the exchange reaction 
at 
low temperatures, 
D, chemisorhed 
in the 
forms of H(III), 
H(IV), 
and H(V) 
was 
almost 
quantitatively 
recovered 
as HD 
when an excess of Hz was circulated 
over 
it and temperature 
was raised from room 
temperature 
to 600°C. 
(2) Equilibration 
Reaction 
Equilibration 
reaction was carried out on 
a small amount of catalyst 
(1.0 mg) with 
approximately 
equimolar 
mixtures 
of H, 
and D,, as already explained. It was found 
that the time course of the reaction 
well 
fitted the first order-rate equation dx/dt = 
k, (x, - x) where LX 
and ze were the frac- 
tion of an isotope at time t (min) 
and at 
equilibrium, 
respectively. 
A specific rate, 
k 
was calculated 
from 
k, = Nice/60 A 
mmdlecules 
. set-l . cm-z according to the treat- 
ment of Couper and Eley 
(26). Here N 
is the total 
number 
of molecules in the 
reaction system, and A is the surface area 
(cm2> of the catalyst. 
The pressure dependence of k, at -75°C 
is shown in Fig. 4 which also includes the 
results 
obtained 
with 
an alkali-poisoned 
alumina 
(Na.CO, 
6.1 wt %). The curves 
showed a similar 
trend 
as was observed 
by Yasumori 
and Ohno (6)) and the values 
of k, obtained at -75°C 
were of the same 
order of magnitude 
as those obtained 
by 
them at the same temperature. 
The 
temperature-dependence 
measure- 
ments 
at a total 
pressure 
of 9.5 Torr 
produced unexpected 
results, as shown in 
Fig. 5. A marked decrease in the activa- 
tion 
energy 
was observed 
in the higher 
temperature 
region 
with 
both 
catalysts. 
The 
transient 
temperatures 
were 
about 
-10 
and -5O”C, 
respectively 
on alumina 
and alkali-poisoned 
alumina. 
The activa- 
tion energy on alumina 
was found to be 
2.1 and 0.26 kcal/mole 
in the low and the 
high temperature 
regions, respectively, 
and 
2.9 and -1.4 
kcal/mole 
on Na&O,-alu- 
mina. Although 
the activat’ion 
energy of 
2.1 kcal 
found 
on the alumina 
at low 
temperatures is in a reasonable range (1.5- 
2.5 kcal) 
observed by other authors 
(2, 
5-7) as t’he apparent 
activat’ion 
energy of 
equilibration 
on alumina, 
the decrease in 
energy 
at 
high 
temperatures 
such 
as 
shown in Fig. 5 has not been observed pre- 
viously. 
Acres et al. (5) found a maximum 
at about 110°C in the Arrhenius 
plot of 
the ortho-para 
hydrogen-conversion 
reac- 
tion on an cu-alumina, but the rate of H,- 
D? equilibration 
steadily 
increased 
from 
-80 
to 550°C. The speed of the circula- 
tion 
pump 
used in the present 
reaction 
system was sufficiently 
fast, 
as already 
pointed out, and the order of experiments 
was so chosen that 
the sequential 
effect 
due to catalyst 
fatigue, if any, was elimi- 
nated. As mentioned

admittance 
or circulation 
of the gas. More- 
over, the negative 
activation 
energy can- 
not be explained 
by such a temperature 
effect. It 
is, therefore, 
unlikely 
that 
the 
break in the Arrhenius 
plots observed here 
is due to spurious 
effects of temperature 
or apparatus. 
Eley and Norton 
(27) found an increase 
in the activation 
energy of Hz-D,

ibration 
on a nickel 
catalyst 
from 
2.4 
kcal (2W300”K) 
to 7.5 kcal (30&400”K), 
and explained 
it by the change of mech- 
anism from the Eley-Rideal 
(28) to the 
Bonhoeffer-Farkas 
(29) 
type. 
Similar 
mechanistic 
change was also assumed by 
Acres et al. (5) for equilibration 
reaction 
on a-alumina. 
Although 
the present results 
are not sufficient 
to determine 
the mech- 
anism, the fact that 
the Arrhenius 
plots 
fall 
off at higher 
temperatures 
seems to 
suggest 
other 
possibilities 
such 
as 
(1) 
change of rate-controlling 
step with 
tem- 
perature, 
(2) change of the apparent 
ac- 
tivation 
energy 
due to the temperature 
dependence of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood 
rate equation, 
or (3) self-poisoning 
of the 
&catalyst by hydrogen 
at higher 
temper- 
-atures. For example, if the reaction occurs 
-by Rideal mechanism 
(30), 
* * 
* 
* 
and the exchange of atoms (Step II) 
is 
the slowest step at low temperatures, 
the 
rate-controlling 
step could shift at higher 
temperatures to the Step I, in which molec- 
ular D, is brought 
to an adjacent sitt. 
a chemisorbed H either by adsorption or U,.T 
surface migration. 
The change of apparent 
activation 
energy 
can also be explainc:j 
by the temperature 
dependence of I.n!:g- 
muir-Hinshelwood 
rate 
equation, 
and a 
maximum 
in the rate may 
be observed 
when the heat of adsorption 
of reactant is 
larger than the activation 
energy of the 
elementary 
reaction 
which 
controls 
the 
overall reaction. Finally, 
a stronger chemi- 
sorption 
of hydrogen 
would 
tend to be- 
come faster 
at higher 
temperatures 
and 
result in a blocking 
of the sites for H(1) 
chemisorption 
(self-poisoning). 
Although 
the observed rate of H(II1) 
chemisorption 
at room temperature 
seems to be too slow 
to retard 
the equilibration 
reaction 
ap- 
preciably, 
this effect will 
have to be con- 
sidered at higher temperat,ures. In any case, 
more experimental 
evidence is needed to 
clarify 
this matter. 
Figure 6 shows the effect of preadsorbrd 
ethylene 
on the rate of equilibration. 
In 
these 
experiments, 
known 
amounts 
of 
ethylene 
were admitt.ed at room temper- 
ature, and the reactor was then cooled to

-26°C 
to assure chemisorption 
of ethylene 
on stronger 
sites first. The final pressure 
of ethylene 
at -26°C 
was so small 
(less 
than 
1P 
Torr) 
that 
the 
reactant 
gas 
(II, + J&l 
was 
subsequently 
admitted 
without 
evacuation. 
The reaction was car- 
ried out for 5 min at -26°C 
and at a 
total 
pressure of 9.5 Torr. 
The previous 
results of hydrogenation 
of ethylene 
pre- 
adsorbed on alumina 
(17, 18) showed that 
the hydrogenation 
and the exchange 
of 
hydrogen 
atoms bctwecn ethylene 
and D, 
were negligibly 
small under these reaction 
condit’ions compared to the amount of HD 
produced 
by the equilibration 
reaction. 
Two different 
groups of active sites for 
the chemisorption 
of ethylene 
were pre- 
viously 
found on alumina 
by Amenomiya 
and Cvetanoric 
(31) as sites I 
(weaker 
sites) 
and II 
(stronger 
sites). 
Yasumori 
and Ohno (6) recently 
reported that three 
different 
peaks 
were 
observed 
in 
the 
thermal 
desorption 
of ethylene 
on y-alu- 
mina and concluded that ethylene adsorbed 
most strongly 
(sites II) 
retarded both the 
equilibration 
and the conversion 
reactions 
via 
a chemical 
mechanism. 
It 
was con- 
firmed 
in Fig. 
6 that 
the 
equilibration 
reaction 
was retarded by the prcadsorbcd 
ethylene. However, the number of stronger 
sites (sites II) 
was about, 1.6 X 10’” sites/ 
cm2, as estimated 
from t,he hpdrogenation 
of et.hylene (17), hut, as shown in Fig. 6, 
much larger amount of ethylene was needed 
to stop completely 
the equilibration 
reac- 
tion. The extrapolation 
of the straight line 
in Fig. 6 to 12, = 0 gives 11 X 1O1? 
molc- 
cults of C3H4/cm2. Bearing 
in mind that 
this is a rough estimate, 
particularly 
in 
view 
of the extremely 
small 
amount 
of 
catalyst 
(1 mg) used in the present ex- 
reriments, 
the number of sites thins found 
is thought 
to he in rather good aerccment 
with the tot’al number of sites for ethylene 
chemisorntion 
(sites I + II) 
found on alu- 
mina 
bv 
Amenomiga 
and 
Cvetanovic 
(8.7 X 10’” sites/cm?) 
(32). It is of interest 
tPrlt the above site densities anproximately 
coincide 
with 
t,he site dcnsitv 
of H(I) 
(9.7 x 101’). 
Van 
Caliwelaert 
and Hall 
(71 also found, bv using CO.! as noison. 
that the numhcr of active sites on xlumina 
for Hz--I>, equilibration 
reaction 
was 8-- 
16 X 1O1’ sites/cm’. 
These 
facts suggest 
that the equilibration 
reaction also requires 
hydrogen 
chemisorbed 
in type H(1). 
(3) Alkali-Poisoned 
Alumina 
As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the rate of 
equilibration 
on the Na,CO,-alumina 
is 
about ten times smaller than on alumina. 
Alt,hough 
the adsorption 
of hydrogen 
on 
the poisoned 
alumina 
at -75°C 
was so 
small 
that 
21, for 
H (I) 
chcmisorption 
could not be obtained 
from the isotherm, 
it stems apparent that sodium ions block 
the sites for H(1). 
The activation 
energies 
obtained on this catalyst differed, however, 
from 
those on alumina, 
as already 
de- 
scribed, suggesting that the strength of the 
sites is probably 
also influenced by poison- 
ing t’o some extent. The adsorbed amounts 
of hydrogen 
measured manomctrically 
at 
250°C 
and room temperature 
were also 
much smaller than those obtained 
on the 
unpoisoned 
catalyst, at corresponding 
tem- 
pcraturcs. 
Consequently, 
the temperature- 
programmed 
drsorption 
on the poisoned 
alumina 
showed much 
smaller 
peaks in 
the desorption 
chromatograms. 
The peak 
shapes and temperatures 
were almost the 
same as shown in Fig. 1 except for H(IV), 
which 
appeared at the same temperature 
(2OO”C), but was not decreased by poison- 
ing a‘: Mitch as the other peaks. The peak 
height of H(IV) 
was comparable 
to that 
of H (III), 
even for room temperature 
ad- 
sorption, 
so that] the two peak maxima 
were clrarlp 
separated, while in the Chro- 
matogram 
ic) in Fig. 1 H(IV) 
was only 
a shoulder of H(II1). 
The reason for this, 
however. is not pet known. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The present study 
revealed 
a complex 
character 
of the chemisorption 
of hvdro- 
gen on alumina. 
At 
least 
five 
different 
types of chcmisorbed 
hydrogen 
were de- 
tected by the temperatureprogrammed 
de- 
sorption as different 
peaks which anneared 
respectively 
at about -40, 
35, 100. 200, 
and 320°C. These peaks (or types) 
are 
referred to as H(I), 
H (II). 
H (III), 
H (IV), 
and H(V) , rrspcct,ively. 
The experimental 
122 
Y. AMENOMIYA 
results indicated 
that at least four 
types 
of chemisorption, 
H(I), 
H(III), 
H(IV), 
and H(V), 
shared ail or part of the same 
sites which 
were defects of alumina 
sur- 
face. It 
was found 
that 
H(1) 
was the 
weakest 
chemisorption, 
and it fitted 
the 
dissociative 
Langmuir 
isotherm, 
and that 
this was the only 
type of chemisorption 
which was involved 
in the Hz--D, exchange 
reaction 
at low temperatures.
