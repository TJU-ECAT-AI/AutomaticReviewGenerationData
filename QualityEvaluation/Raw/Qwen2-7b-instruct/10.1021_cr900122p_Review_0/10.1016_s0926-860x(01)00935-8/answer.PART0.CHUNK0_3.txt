[1] "Ga2O3, which has not, to the best of our knowledge,been previously reported by others in the literature for this reaction, was the most active material, followed by ZnO."
[2] "The previously reported ba- sicity trends were observed for limited groups of these oxides, although when taking the dataset as a whole,no direct relationship between predicted basicity and performance could be discerned."
[3] "An activity pattern similar to those observed for hydrogenation and H2/D2 exchange reactions in other studies was apparent for the first row transition metal oxides, and this may indicate a similarity of mechanism for this sub-set of materials."
[4] "It is proposed that the origin of the exceptional activity of Ga2O3 and ZnO may relate to partial reduction during testing."

Metal oxides such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) are found to be exceptionally active in the methanedeuterium exchange reaction, surpassing other metal oxides. Their high activity is possibly due to their partial reduction during testing, which might facilitate the activation of methane. The activity patterns of these materials resemble those observed in hydrogenation and hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions, suggesting a similar mechanism. No direct relationship between the basicity of metal oxides and their performance in this reaction is discernible.

我们发现，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和锌氧化物（ZnO）在甲烷脱氘反应中表现出极高的活性，超越了其他金属氧化物。这种高活性可能与它们在测试过程中的部分还原有关，这有助于甲烷的激活。这些材料的活性模式类似于在氢化和氢/氘交换反应中观察到的模式，表明存在相似的机制。无法直接将金属氧化物的碱性与其在这一反应中的性能相关联。
