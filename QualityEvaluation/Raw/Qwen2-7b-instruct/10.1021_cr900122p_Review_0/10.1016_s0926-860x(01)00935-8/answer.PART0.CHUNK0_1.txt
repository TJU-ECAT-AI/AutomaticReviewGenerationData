"Ga2O3, which has not, to the best of our knowledge, been previously reported by others in the literature for this reaction, was the most active material, followed by ZnO."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The most active material for the methanedeuterium exchange reaction was Ga2O3, followed closely by ZnO. These findings are noteworthy given the materials' potential role in alkane aromatization reactions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
据我们所知，此前文献中未见Ga2O3在这一反应中的报道。Ga2O3是活性最高的材料，紧随其后的是ZnO。这些结果对于这两种材料在烷烃芳构化反应中的潜在作用非常值得注意。

"The conversion was calculated using: CD × 100% where CD is the sum of all the deuterated methane product concentrations and CH4 is the methane concentration in the feed."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Conversion was calculated as CD × 100%, where CD represents the sum of all deuterated methane product concentrations, and CH4 is the methane concentration in the feed.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
转化率计算公式为CD × 100%，其中CD为所有脱氘甲烷产物浓度之和，而CH4则是进料中的甲烷浓度。

<quotes>
"It is very interesting to note the similarity of the activity patterns for the first row transition metal oxides in this study with those reported for hydrogenation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Notably, the activity patterns for the first row transition metal oxides in this study resemble those reported for hydrogenation.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
值得注意的是，本研究中第一行过渡金属氧化物的活性模式与报道的氢化反应相似。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
"The high propensity of partially reduced gallium oxide to form alkyls cannot be used to explain our results since gallium alkyl formation by direct routes from the metal is known to be difficult."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The tendency of partially reduced gallium oxide to form alkyls cannot account for our findings, as direct metal-to-alkyl formation via gallium is known to be challenging.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
部分还原的镓氧化物形成烷基的倾向无法解释我们的结果，因为直接通过金属到烷基的形成方式来形成镓烷基是已知困难的。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
"From the similar activity patterns between singly and doubly deuterated methane formation for many of the materials, it does appear that in the most cases a sequential pathway is in operation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
For many materials, the similarity in activity patterns between singly and doubly deuterated methane formation suggests a sequential pathway is operational in most cases.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
对于许多材料而言，单脱氘甲烷和双脱氘甲烷生成的类似活性模式表明，在大多数情况下，一个顺序途径正在运作。
