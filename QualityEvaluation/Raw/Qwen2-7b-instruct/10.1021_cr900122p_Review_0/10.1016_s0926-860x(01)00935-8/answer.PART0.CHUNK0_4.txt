[1] "Ga2O3, which has not, to the best of our knowledge,been previously reported by others in the literature for this reaction, was the most active material, followed by ZnO."
[2] "The previously reported ba- sicity trends were observed for limited groups of these oxides, although when taking the dataset as a whole,no direct relationship between predicted basicity and performance could be discerned."
[3] "An activity pattern similar to those observed for hydrogenation and H2/D2 exchange reactions in other studies was apparent for the first row transition metal oxides, and this may indicate a similarity of mechanism for this sub-set of materials."
[4] "It is proposed that the origin of the exceptional activity of Ga2O3 and ZnO may relate to partial reduction during testing."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These processes are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, for instance, in converting butane to maleic anhydride. The conversion involves the activation of the C-H bond in butane through the creation of an electrophilic center on the metal center, which abstracts a hydrogen atom to form an alkyl radical. This radical then undergoes a series of reactions to form maleic anhydride. The principles involve the stabilization of the radical species, the generation of an electrophile, and the subsequent addition of oxygen to the alkyl radical to form the desired product. The partial reduction of Ga2O3 and ZnO during testing might contribute to their exceptional activity in C-H bond activation, potentially enabling the formation of alkyl radicals and facilitating the subsequent oxidative reactions.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象等机制促进了非均相催化中的C-H键活化。这些原理在工业上用于选择性氧化烷烃，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。转化过程涉及通过金属中心创建亲电中心来激活丁烷的C-H键，从而提取氢原子形成烷基自由基。随后，该自由基经历一系列反应形成马来酸酐。原理涉及稳定自由基物种、生成亲电体以及随后向烷基自由基添加氧以形成所需产物。测试过程中Ga2O3和ZnO的部分还原可能对其在C-H键活化中的异常活性做出贡献，这可能使烷基自由基的形成成为可能，并促进随后的氧化反应。
