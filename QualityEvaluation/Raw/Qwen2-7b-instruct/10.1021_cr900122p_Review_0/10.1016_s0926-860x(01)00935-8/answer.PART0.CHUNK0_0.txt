<quotes>
"However, any attempt to rank the oxides in terms of acidbase properties can be misleading,since the above types of basicity argument do not hold for our dataset as a whole."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Attempting to rank the oxides based on their acid-base properties can be misleading, as the arguments concerning basicity do not universally apply to our entire dataset.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
<ChineseVersionAnswer>
试图根据酸碱性质对氧化物进行排名可能是误导性的，因为关于基本性的论点并不适用于我们整个数据集。

</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
"Taken together, these observations suggest that different rate determining steps may be occurring for the different groupings of oxides."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Collectively, these observations imply that varying rate-determining steps might be at play for the different oxide groups.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
<ChineseVersionAnswer>
