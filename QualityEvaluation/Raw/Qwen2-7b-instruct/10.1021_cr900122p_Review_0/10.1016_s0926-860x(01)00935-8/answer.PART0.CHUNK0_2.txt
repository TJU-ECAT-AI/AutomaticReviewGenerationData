[1] "Ga2O3, which has not, to the best of our knowledge,been previously reported by others in the literature for this reaction, was the most active material, followed by ZnO."
[2] "The introduction of a donor dopant (Al3+ or Ga3+) was reported to enhance activity whilst an acceptor (Li+) had a retarding effect."
[3] "Although on the basis of these arguments it is tempting to relate ac- tivity pattern to reduction, however, consideration of the dataset as a whole indicates that this explanation is too simplistic."
[4] "In view of the basicity arguments, it is surprising that Y2O3 which is known to be basic, was inactive for the exchange reaction."
[5] "It is very interesting to note the similarity of the activity patterns for the first row transition metal ox- ides in this study with those reported for hydrogena- tion [23] and hydrogendeuterium exchange reactions [18]."

Metal oxides with isolated metal centers can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In the context of the provided literature, Ga2O3 and ZnO were found to be exceptionally active for methane activation, despite their basicity. The basicity arguments, while insightful for certain oxides, do not universally correlate with activity. The activity patterns of the first-row transition metal oxides align with those observed in hydrogenation and hydrogendeuterium exchange reactions, suggesting similarities in the underlying mechanisms. The exceptional activity of Ga2O3 and ZnO may be related to partial reduction during testing, potentially facilitating alkyl formation or hydrogen transfer.

孤立金属中心的金属氧化物可以通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象等机制在异质催化中促进C-H键活化。这些原理应用于工业选择性烷烃氧化，包括丁烷转化为马来酸酐。根据提供的文献，Ga2O3和ZnO被发现对于甲烷激活具有异常活性，尽管它们的碱性。基本性的论点，在某些氧化物上是有洞察力的，但并不适用于所有氧化物。第一行过渡金属氧化物的活性模式与氢化和氢氘交换反应中观察到的模式相似，这表明存在相似的机制。Ga2O3和ZnO的异常活性可能与测试期间的还原有关，这可能促进了烷基形成或氢转移。
