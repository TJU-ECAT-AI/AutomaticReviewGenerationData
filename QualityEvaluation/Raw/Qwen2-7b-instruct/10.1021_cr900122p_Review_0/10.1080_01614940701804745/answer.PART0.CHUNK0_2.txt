[1] "The selective transformation of light alkanes to aromatics that are more valuable and versatile feedstocks for the chemical industry is one of the major challenges of catalytic chemistry."
[2] "Following a general discussion of acidity and confinement effects in these systems, this review focuses on understanding specific reactions occurring on Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5."
[3] "Several groups have used computational methods to determine the influence of structural effects such as Al-O (T-O) distances and bond angles in the Al-OH-Si (T-O-T) group on the acidity of the hydroxyl group."
[4] "The relationship between the T-O-T angle and the proton affinity can be analyzed with simple chemical arguments as follows."
[5] "Early work in alkane cracking over low-silica faujasites, like H-Y concluded that catalytic activity increased as aluminum was removed from the lattice."
[6] "In the first few years following the publication of the Haag-Dessau mechanism, there was significant dispute in the literature, with McVicker and Kramer (108) arguing that the constancy of the [H2  C4 olefins] to [CH4  C3H8] ratio over non-zeolitic catalysts having a wide range of activity was difficult to reconcile."
[7] "In a series of studies, researchers (132134) have used isotopic tracer techniques to study propane activation on HZSM-5."
[8] "Recent quantum chemical studies by Fa rcas iu and Lukinskas (140, 141) have also postulated a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species."
[9] "Truitt et al. (69) have also used NMR methods to demonstrate (i) that alkanes interact with zeolites at Brnsted acid sites via specific adsorption complexes that enable (ii) low temperature (273 K) exchange between iso- butane and the Brnsted acid proton."

The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is a significant challenge in catalytic chemistry. The review focuses on understanding reactions on Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5, considering acidity and confinement effects. Computational methods have been used to analyze the influence of structural parameters on acidity. The T-O-T angle is crucial in determining the acidity and proton affinity of the hydroxyl group. Early studies showed that removing aluminum from the lattice increased catalytic activity in faujasites. There was controversy over the Haag-Dessau mechanism, which proposed a protolytic cracking mechanism, contrasting with McVicker and Kramer's view. Researchers have used isotopic tracer techniques to study propane activation on HZSM-5. Quantum chemical studies have suggested a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species. NMR methods have been employed to demonstrate alkane interaction with Brnsted acid sites via specific adsorption complexes enabling low-temperature hydrogen exchange.
