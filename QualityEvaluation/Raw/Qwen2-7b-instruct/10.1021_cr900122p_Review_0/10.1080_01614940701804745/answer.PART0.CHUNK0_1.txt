[1] "Since the activation energy for the C-H bond cleavage is higher compared to C-C bond cleavage, the former is found to be more facile."
[2] "In a series of studies, researchers (132134) have used isotopic tracer techniques to study propane activation on HZSM-5."
[3] "Isotopic transient experiments were comprised of switching n-C4H10 with n-C4D10 and monitoring the steady-state product distribution."
[4] "The concentration of n-C4H10 was observed to decrease in parallel with that of the tracer krypton gas."
[5] "The lack of a similar kinetic isotope effect for dehydrogenation suggested that deprotonation of the zeolite did not play a role in the rate determining step of protolytic dehydrogenation."

1. C-H bond cleavage is considered more straightforward than C-C bond cleavage due to the higher activation energy required for the former.

2. Researchers have conducted studies using isotopic tracer techniques on propane activation over HZSM-5 in a series of experiments.

3. These experiments involved switching n-C4H10 to n-C4D10 and observing the steady-state product distribution.

4. The decrease in n-C4H10 concentration was observed in parallel with the tracer krypton gas concentration.

5. The absence of a similar kinetic isotope effect for dehydrogenation implies that deprotonation of the zeolite did not dictate the rate-determining step in the process.

1. C-H键断裂被认为比C-C键断裂更容易，因为前者所需的活化能更高。

2. 研究人员在一系列实验中使用同位素示踪技术研究了丙烷在HZSM-5上的活化。

3. 这些实验包括将n-C4H10替换为n-C4D10，并观察稳态产物分布。

4.n-C4H10浓度的减少与示踪剂氪气浓度的下降同时发生。

5. 不存在类似的同位素效应对于脱氢，表明脱质子化对HZSM-5过程的速率决定步骤没有起到作用。
