The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is enabled by isolated metal centers on oxide materials through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, a metal center donates a proton to butane, creating a butyl carbocation. In H-abstraction, a hydrogen atom is removed from butane by the metal center, generating a butyl radical. This radical then reacts with oxygen to produce a peroxy radical, which undergoes a final reaction to form maleic anhydride. This process usually occurs with the aid of a catalyst, such as a supported metal oxide.

但烯转化为马来酸酐的过程依赖于氧化材料上的孤立金属中心，通过火星范克伦机制和氢提取等机制。在火星范克伦机制中，金属中心向但烷捐赠质子，形成丁基碳正离子。在氢提取过程中，金属中心从但烷中移除一个氢原子，生成丁基自由基。这个自由基随后与氧气反应生成过氧自由基，最终反应生成马来酸酐。这个过程通常需要催化剂的支持，如金属氧化物支持剂。
