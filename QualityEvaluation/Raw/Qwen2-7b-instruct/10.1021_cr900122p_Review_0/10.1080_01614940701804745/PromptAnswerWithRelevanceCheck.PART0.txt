The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is enabled by isolated metal centers on oxide materials through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, a metal center donates a proton to butane, creating a butyl carbocation. In H-abstraction, a hydrogen atom is removed from butane by the metal center, generating a butyl radical. This radical then reacts with oxygen to produce a peroxy radical, which undergoes a final reaction to form maleic anhydride. This process usually occurs with the aid of a catalyst, such as a supported metal oxide.

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as gallium in Ga-modified HZSM-5 catalysts, play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. They accomplish this through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the gallium center acts as a Lewis acid, abstracting a hydrogen atom from the butane molecule to form an alkyl radical. This radical then undergoes further reactions, such as electrophilic addition, leading to the formation of maleic anhydride. The gallium center's ability to abstract a hydrogen atom is a key feature in this process, demonstrating its catalytic activity in industrial selective oxidation reactions.

[3] "Isotopic transient experiments were comprised of switching n-C4H10 with n-C4D10 and monitoring the steady-state product distribution."
[4] "The concentration of n-C4H10 was observed to decrease in parallel with that of the tracer krypton gas."
[5] "The lack of a similar kinetic isotope effect for dehydrogenation suggested that deprotonation of the zeolite did not play a role in the rate determining step of protolytic dehydrogenation."

1. C-H bond cleavage is considered more straightforward than C-C bond cleavage due to the higher activation energy required for the former.

2. Researchers have conducted studies using isotopic tracer techniques on propane activation over HZSM-5 in a series of experiments.

3. These experiments involved switching n-C4H10 to n-C4D10 and observing the steady-state product distribution.

4. The decrease in n-C4H10 concentration was observed in parallel with the tracer krypton gas concentration.

5. The absence of a similar kinetic isotope effect for dehydrogenation implies that deprotonation of the zeolite did not dictate the rate-determining step in the process.

Experimental studies show different rates for H/D exchange, C-H bond cleavage, and C-C bond cleavage, and also address the crucial role of alkane adsorption in determining the intrinsic reaction rates. Theoretical studies have shown different transition state struc- tures for these reactions and hence provided a basis for rationalizing differ- ences in measured experimental rates for these reactions.

Spoto et al. (163) studied ethene and propene oligomerization on HZSM-5 using FTIR spectroscopy while collecting 7 interferograms per second at 4 cm21 resolution. The fast collection enabled the adsorption process to be categorized into three intervals (A) immediately after dosage up to a contact time not exceeding 10s, that probes the structure of the primary interaction, (B) up to a contact time of 1.5 minutes, that probes the initial stages of oligomeriza- tion, and (C) up to several hours, that discusses the long time behavior of the reaction. In regime (A), a frequency shift for the Brnsted acid sites (3610 cm21 band) and the ethylene molecule were found, while no perturbation of the external silanol groups (3746 cm21 band) was observed. The observed perturbations were attributed to the formation of a 1:1 p-complex as shown in Figure 5; resulting in a red-shift of 389 cm21 for the O-H Brnsted acid site stretching frequency and reduced symmetry of the adsorbed C2H4 as well as reduced density of charge on the carbon-carbon double bond (measured by the 11 cm21 downward shift of the n(C5 5C) bond).

The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is a significant challenge in catalytic chemistry. The review focuses on understanding reactions on Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5, considering acidity and confinement effects. Computational methods have been used to analyze the influence of structural parameters on acidity. The T-O-T angle is crucial in determining the acidity and proton affinity of the hydroxyl group. Early studies showed that removing aluminum from the lattice increased catalytic activity in faujasites. There was controversy over the Haag-Dessau mechanism, which proposed a protolytic cracking mechanism, contrasting with McVicker and Kramer's view. Researchers have used isotopic tracer techniques to study propane activation on HZSM-5. Quantum chemical studies have suggested a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species.

<p>The isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a key role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. This process involves mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, where a metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom (H-abstraction) from the carbon-hydrogen bond, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The H-abstraction step is often the rate-limiting step in this process.</p>
<p>In industrial applications, these principles are applied in the selective oxidation of alkanes. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride utilizes this mechanism, where a metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the butane molecule, forming a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes further reactions to yield maleic anhydride.</p>

<p>The selective transformation of light alkanes to aromatics that are more valuable and versatile feedstocks for the chemical industry is one of the major challenges of catalytic chemistry.</p>
<p>This article reviews the current mechanistic understanding for the conversion of propane to aromatic compounds over HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts based on experimental as well as theoretical studies.</p>
<p>Following a general discussion of acidity and confinement effects in these systems, this review focuses on understanding specific reactions occurring on Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5.</p>
<p>Ab initio calculations have postulated a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species.</p>
<p>H/D exchange was observed for D2/C3H8, C3D8/C3H8 and CD4/C3H8 mixtures.</p>
<p>Identical rates of C-H bond cleavage on HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 calculated from the deuterium content in C3D8/C3H8 mixtures, but an increase by a factor of three in the propane conversion turnover rates over Ga/HZSM-5, led the authors to conclude that C-H bond cleavage cannot limit the propane conversion rate.</p>
<p>The calculated virtual pressure of hydrogen, considering that the dissociation of H2 leads to one H-atom that is mobile on HZSM-5, was calculated to be 216 kPa, while the gas phase pressure was less than 1 kPa.</p>
<p>Recent quantum chemical studies by Fa rcas iu and Lukinskas have also postulated a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species.</p>
<p>Unimolecular scrambling of 13C in propane, cracking, dehydrogenation and disproportionation were observed.</p>
