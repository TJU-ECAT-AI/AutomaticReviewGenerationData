[1] "Most gallium modified formulations are prepared by impregnating, refluxing, or by mechanical mixing of Ga2O3 and HZSM-5,with subsequent thermal activation or reduction."
[2] "Our discussion below attempts to show that Ga3 cations, in the as-prepared catalysts, irrespective of the preparation technique, are re-dispersed under the strongly reducing conditions and high temperatures prevalent during aromatization resulting in the active formulation of the catalyst."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as gallium in Ga-modified HZSM-5 catalysts, play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. They accomplish this through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the gallium center acts as a Lewis acid, abstracting a hydrogen atom from the butane molecule to form an alkyl radical. This radical then undergoes further reactions, such as electrophilic addition, leading to the formation of maleic anhydride. The gallium center's ability to abstract a hydrogen atom is a key feature in this process, demonstrating its catalytic activity in industrial selective oxidation reactions.

在氧化材料中，如Ga改良的HZSM-5催化剂中的孤立金属中心，在异相催化中起着关键作用，促进了C-H键的激活。它们通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H抽象等机制实现这一过程。例如，在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，镓中心作为路易斯酸，从丁烷分子中提取一个氢原子形成烷基自由基。该自由基随后进行进一步反应，如亲电加成，导致形成马来酸酐。镓中心提取氢原子的能力是此过程中催化剂活性的关键特征，证明了其在工业选择性氧化反应中的应用。
