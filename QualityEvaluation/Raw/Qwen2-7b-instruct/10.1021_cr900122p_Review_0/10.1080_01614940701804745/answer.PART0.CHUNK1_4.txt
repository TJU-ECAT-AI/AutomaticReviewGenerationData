<p>The isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a key role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. This process involves mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, where a metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom (H-abstraction) from the carbon-hydrogen bond, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The H-abstraction step is often the rate-limiting step in this process.</p>
<p>In industrial applications, these principles are applied in the selective oxidation of alkanes. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride utilizes this mechanism, where a metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the butane molecule, forming a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes further reactions to yield maleic anhydride.</p>

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen机制促进C-H键活化，涉及H抽象。这一原理应用于工业中的烷烃选择性氧化，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，其中金属中心从丁烷分子中抽取氢原子形成碳正离子中间体，该中间体随后经历进一步反应生成马来酸酐。
