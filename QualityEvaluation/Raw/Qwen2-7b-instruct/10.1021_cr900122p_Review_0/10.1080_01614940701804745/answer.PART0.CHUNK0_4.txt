<p>The selective transformation of light alkanes to aromatics that are more valuable and versatile feedstocks for the chemical industry is one of the major challenges of catalytic chemistry.</p>
<p>This article reviews the current mechanistic understanding for the conversion of propane to aromatic compounds over HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts based on experimental as well as theoretical studies.</p>
<p>Following a general discussion of acidity and confinement effects in these systems, this review focuses on understanding specific reactions occurring on Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5.</p>
<p>Ab initio calculations have postulated a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species.</p>
<p>H/D exchange was observed for D2/C3H8, C3D8/C3H8 and CD4/C3H8 mixtures.</p>
<p>Identical rates of C-H bond cleavage on HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 calculated from the deuterium content in C3D8/C3H8 mixtures, but an increase by a factor of three in the propane conversion turnover rates over Ga/HZSM-5, led the authors to conclude that C-H bond cleavage cannot limit the propane conversion rate.</p>
<p>The calculated virtual pressure of hydrogen, considering that the dissociation of H2 leads to one H-atom that is mobile on HZSM-5, was calculated to be 216 kPa, while the gas phase pressure was less than 1 kPa.</p>
<p>Recent quantum chemical studies by Fa rcas iu and Lukinskas have also postulated a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species.</p>
<p>Unimolecular scrambling of 13C in propane, cracking, dehydrogenation and disproportionation were observed.</p>
<p>Quantum chemical calculations have also been extensively employed to develop mechanistic understanding for alkane activation over zeolitic acid sites.</p>
