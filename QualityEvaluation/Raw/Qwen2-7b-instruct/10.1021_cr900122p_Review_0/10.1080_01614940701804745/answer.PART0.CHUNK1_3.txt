<p>The current challenge lies in extending this understanding to longer and branched hydrocarbon molecules, both experimentally and theoretically.</p>
<p>Initial work from McVicker and coworkers, NMR studies from Gorte and coworkers as well as Haw and coworkers, and theoretical studies from Kazansky and coworkers have established the formation of neutral alkoxide structures upon olefin adsorption in zeolites.</p>
<p>We extend that discussion here and focus only on the olefin adsorption studies.</p>
<p>Essentially identical TPD product distributions from all three adsorbates suggested that the cracking and alkylation of similar oligomeric species was involved.</p>
<p>The physisorption energy was not affected by cluster relaxation, however, the activation energy increased from 57 to 91 kJ/mol upon constraining the zeolite lattice.</p>
<p>In agreement with Rozanska et al. (178) we also find changes in the first shell of oxygen atoms surrounding the aluminum site at the transition state geometry and note that the aluminum hosting the Brnsted site or the alkoxide always has a longer Al-O bond length.</p>
<p>The observed perturbations were attributed to the formation of a 1:1 p-complex as shown in Figure 5.</p>
<p>Although the major features of the observed product distribution for the b-scission reaction can be described in terms of carbenium ion chemistry, theoretical studies have shown that the reaction profile is complex.</p>
<p>The above studies represent a valuable starting point for developing complex models for light alkane aromatization, however, a majority of the individual rate constants remain inaccessible from a quantitative point of view.</p>
<p>Our model considers surface species to be neutral alkoxides, reactions of these alkoxides to occur via carbenium-ion-like transition states and alkane activation via carbonium-ion-like transition states.</p>
<p>Although the Lack-of-fit test (281) suggests scope for model improvement, the good agreement between experimental data and model predictions over a wide range of space times and hence conversions suggests that we have developed a microkinetic model that can describe the activity of Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5.</p>
<p>The authors note that due to the much higher heat of adsorption on H-MOR and H-BEA, the composite activation barriers are lower for b-scission and hydride transfer reactions, even though the intrinsic activation energies are higher.</p>
<p>Good quantitative agreement between model predictions and the experimental data are obtained based on 30 rate constants for olefin aromatization and an additional 14 rate constants for paraffin aromatization.</p>
<p>The introduction of gallium was observed to increase the dehydropygenation rate constant by a factor of 7, while the protolytic cracking rate was not observed to be significantly altered.</p>
