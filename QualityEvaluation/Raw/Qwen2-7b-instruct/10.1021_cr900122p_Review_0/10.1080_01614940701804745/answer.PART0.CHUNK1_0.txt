1. Different rates for H/D exchange, C-H bond cleavage, and C-C bond cleavage have been observed in alkane reactions. The role of alkane adsorption plays a crucial role in determining the intrinsic reaction rates. Theoretical studies have provided insights into the different transition state structures of these reactions, aiding in the rationalization of the differences in experimental rates.

2. The formation of neutral alkoxide structures upon olefin adsorption in zeolites has been established through initial work from McVicker and coworkers, NMR studies from Gorte and coworkers, and theoretical studies from Kazansky and coworkers.

3. Interaction with Brnsted acid sites in zeolites often leads to oligomerization of unsaturated olefinic molecules.

4. Propene and 2-methyl-2-propanol were observed to undergo reactions at 295 K, while ethylene required temperatures higher than 370 K for reaction. The product distribution was consistent with carbenium ion reactions.

5. Recent in situ EXAFS experiments on ethene chemisorption on H-Y zeolite confirm a longer aluminum-oxygen bond length for the oxygen binding the proton, aligning with theoretical predictions.

6. The alkylation and dealkylation reactions for alkylaromatics could also represent the disproportionation of alkylaromatics.

7. A kinetic model provides good quantitative fits to the data, despite not incorporating features dependent on the surface species or transition states' primary, secondary, or tertiary nature.

8. A simplified kinetic model, derived from an extended kinetic model, is observed to give results in general agreement with the full kinetic model.

9. A gallium-based catalyst formulation shows improved dehydrogenation function in propane aromatization.

10. The model predictions show good quantitative agreement with experimental data for olefin and paraffin aromatization, based on 30 and 14 rate constants respectively.
