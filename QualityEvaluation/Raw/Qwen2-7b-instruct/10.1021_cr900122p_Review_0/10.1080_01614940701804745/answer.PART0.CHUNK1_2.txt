44 Downloaded by [Harvard College] at 06:34 18 August 2013 In summary, the Haag-Dessau mechanism for protolytic activation of the alkane via penta-coordinated carbonium-ion-like transition states explains the observed product distribution. 

Experimental studies show different rates for H/D exchange, C-H bond cleavage, and C-C bond cleavage, and also address the crucial role of alkane adsorption in determining the intrinsic reaction rates. Theoretical studies have shown different transition state struc- tures for these reactions and hence provided a basis for rationalizing differ- ences in measured experimental rates for these reactions. 

The current challenge lies in extending this understanding to longer and branched hydro- carbon molecules, both experimentally and theoretically.

Theoretical studies have revealed differing transition state structures for these reactions, providing a foundation for understanding discrepancies in measured experimental rates.

Haag-Dessau机制通过五配位碳正离子类似过渡态对烷烃的质子化激活进行了解释，这有助于说明观察到的产品分布。实验研究表明，H/D交换、C-H键断裂和C-C键断裂的速率不同。这些研究还强调了烷烃吸附在决定内在反应速率中的关键作用。理论研究揭示了这些反应的不同过渡状态结构，为理解测量实验速率差异提供了基础。当前的挑战是将这种理解扩展到更长和支链的碳氢分子，无论是实验上还是理论上。

Spoto et al. (163) studied ethene and propene oligomerization on HZSM-5 using FTIR spectroscopy while collecting 7 interferograms per second at 4 cm21 resolution. The fast collection enabled the adsorption process to be categorized into three intervals (A) immediately after dosage up to a contact time not exceeding 10s, that probes the structure of the primary interaction, (B) up to a contact time of 1.5 minutes, that probes the initial stages of oligomeriza- tion, and (C) up to several hours, that discusses the long time behavior of the reaction. In regime (A), a frequency shift for the Brnsted acid sites (3610 cm21 band) and the ethylene molecule were found, while no perturbation of the external silanol groups (3746 cm21 band) was observed. The observed perturbations were attributed to the formation of a 1:1 p-complex as shown in Figure 5; resulting in a red-shift of 389 cm21 for the O-H Brnsted acid site stretching frequency and reduced symmetry of the adsorbed C2H4 as well as reduced density of charge on the carbon-carbon double bond (measured by the 11 cm21 downward shift of the n(C5 5C) bond).

Spoto等人（163）使用傅里叶变换红外光谱法在HZSM-5上研究了乙稀和丙烯的寡聚化过程，在每秒收集7个干涉图的同时保持4cm^-1的分辨率。快速的数据采集允许将吸附过程分为三个阶段（A）立即给药后至接触时间不超过10秒，该阶段探查了主要相互作用的结构；（B）至接触时间为1.5分钟，该阶段探查了寡聚化的初始阶段；（C）至几个小时，该阶段讨论了反应的长时间行为。在阶段（A），发现了酸位（3610 cm^-1波段）和乙烯分子的频率偏移，而外部硅醇基团（3746 cm^-1波段）未见扰动。观察到的扰动归因于形成了1:1 p-复合物，如图5所示；导致O-H酸位拉伸频率红移389 cm^-1，吸附的C2H4的对称性降低以及碳-碳双键电荷密度减少（通过检测n(C5 5C)键的向下偏移11 cm^-1来测量）。
