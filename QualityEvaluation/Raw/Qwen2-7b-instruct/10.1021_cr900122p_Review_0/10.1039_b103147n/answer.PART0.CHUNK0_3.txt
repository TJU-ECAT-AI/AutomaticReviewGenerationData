The document does not provide specific details on how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. However, it mentions that current challenges in the field of catalytic alkane functionalization, both organometallic and bioinorganic, are being discussed. It notes that achieving a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization remains elusive, and that understanding the mechanisms involved, such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes, has been particularly difficult.
