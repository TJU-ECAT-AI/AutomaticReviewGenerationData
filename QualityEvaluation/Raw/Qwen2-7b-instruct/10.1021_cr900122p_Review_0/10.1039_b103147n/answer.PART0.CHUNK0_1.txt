The literature discusses the main advances in the field of alkane activation and functionalization using homogeneous transition metal catalysts. It highlights the emphasis on catalytic alkane functionalization, including both organometallic and bioinorganic methods. Challenges in the field are also addressed, noting that achieving a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization remains elusive. Mechanistic issues prove particularly difficult to resolve. This piece is featured within a collection commemorating 50 years of Dalton Transactions.
