1. Vanadium is favored in catalysts for the selective oxidation of alkanes due to its ability to effectively participate in the activation of C-H bonds.
2. The isolation of vanadium ions within a quasi-inert matrix helps maintain their reactivity while reducing side reactions.
3. The stability of the product is crucial for achieving high selectivity in the oxidation process.
4. Multifunctionality in catalyst design enhances efficiency by incorporating multiple active sites for different reactions.
5. As a criterion, multifunctionality guides the selection of catalyst components that can perform various functions simultaneously.
6. In explaining the reaction mechanism, multifunctionality serves as a tool to understand how different catalytic activities contribute to the overall conversion.
7. While multifunctionality is beneficial, it is not sufficient on its own, necessitating consideration of other factors such as matrix properties and product stability.
8. The type of C-H bond activation influences the efficiency and selectivity of the oxidation reaction, affecting which bonds are broken and how new bonds are formed.
9. Acidity and basicity play critical roles in controlling the oxidative environment, influencing the rates and pathways of the chemical transformations.
