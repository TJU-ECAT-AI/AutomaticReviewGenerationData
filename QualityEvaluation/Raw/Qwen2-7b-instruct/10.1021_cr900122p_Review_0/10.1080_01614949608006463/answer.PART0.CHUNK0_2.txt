1. The role of isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitates C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing a stable environment for the metal ions, allowing them to act as Lewis acids and abstract hydrogen atoms from the substrate. This process is crucial for the selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this context, the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism plays a significant role, where the metal center activates the C-H bond by coordinating with it and then abstracting a hydrogen atom through a hydride transfer reaction. The H-abstraction leads to the formation of an alkyl radical, which can then react further in the desired oxidation pathway.

2. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix enhances their activity and stability during the selective oxidation of alkanes. This isolation prevents the vanadium ions from interacting with other components in the catalyst, minimizing side reactions and promoting a higher yield of the desired product. By maintaining the vanadium ions in a well-defined, stable structure, the catalyst can efficiently perform the oxidation process, particularly in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, ensuring a high selectivity towards the target product.

3. Acidity and basicity play critical roles in the mechanism of selective oxidation of paraffins. The acidity of the catalyst surface facilitates the activation of the C-H bonds, while the basicity can stabilize the intermediate species formed during the oxidation process. The balance between these properties ensures that the catalyst efficiently converts the alkanes into the desired products, such as maleic anhydride, while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. The combination of acidic and basic sites on the catalyst surface optimizes the reaction pathway, leading to enhanced selectivity and efficiency in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

1. 在异相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过提供一个稳定的环境来促进C-H键激活，允许金属离子作为Lewis酸从基质中抽取氢原子。这一过程对于烷烃的选择性氧化至关重要，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。在此背景下，Mars-van-Krevelen机制起着重要作用，其中金属中心通过与C-H键配位并随后通过氢转移反应抽取氢原子来活化C-H键。通过抽取H原子形成烷基自由基，然后在期望的氧化途径中进一步反应，实现了对目标产品的高效选择性。

2. 钴离子在惰性矩阵中的隔离提高了催化剂在选择性氧化烷烃中的活性和稳定性。这种隔离防止钴离子与其他催化剂成分相互作用，减少了副反应并促进了目标产物的更高产率。通过保持钴离子在一个明确、稳定结构中，催化剂可以高效地执行氧化过程，特别是将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，确保了对目标产物的高度选择性。

3. 酸性和碱性在烷烃选择性氧化的机制中扮演着关键角色。催化剂表面的酸性有助于活化C-H键，而碱性则能稳定反应过程中形成的中间物种。这种平衡确保催化剂高效地将烷烃转化为所需产品，如马来酸酐，同时最小化形成副产品的生成。催化剂表面酸性和碱性位点的结合优化了反应途径，导致了更高的选择性和效率，在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中。
