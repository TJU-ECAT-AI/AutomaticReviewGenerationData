[1] "The per- formances of catalysts reported in literature is summarized in Figs. 1 and 2, which report the highest achieved yields in a selectivity vs. conversion plot, and the levels of maximum productivity obtained at the average operative temperature for each system."
[2] "Generally, we can classify the catalysts into:a) Catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, which are also active for meth- ethylene selectivity, %"
[3] "The mechanism does not involve a classical redox-type cycle; thus, no furnishing of bulk oxygen occurs, and the catalyst only is involved in C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation, analogously to that occurring with methane."
[4] "However, a progressive loss of Li occurs at temperatures higher than 700C. Such catalysts could be employed after a methane coupling reactor, in order to increase the yield to ethylene through oxydehydrogenation of formed ethane."
[5] "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides [9,10]; the promoter effect is maintained by continuous feeding of the chlorine, which modifies the catalyst surface [ 11 ]; chlorine radicals are thought to favour the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene."
[6] "A further aspect of this system is the formation of H2 under oxidative conditions [7,12]. H2 can be formed either via thermal or catalyzed dehy- drogenation; also, a contribution was proposed due to water gas shift equilibrium (over rare earth oxides) or of intermediate ethoxy species decom- position to CO, C and H2."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from organic molecules by a metal center, leading to the formation of carbocations. The H-abstraction mechanism involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from a substrate molecule by a metal center, resulting in the formation of a radical. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, as demonstrated by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. For instance, the Li/Mg/O catalyst system, which is also active for methane coupling, facilitates the activation of ethane at temperatures higher than 600°C to form ethyl radicals. These radicals then undergo further reactions in the gas phase. High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, particularly when chlorine-containing compounds are fed to the reactor or when the catalyst is doped with halides. Chlorine radicals enhance the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene. Additionally, under oxidative conditions, hydrogen can be formed via thermal or catalyzed dehydrogenation, or through the water gas shift equilibrium over rare earth oxides or the decomposition of intermediate ethoxy species to CO, C, and H2.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料上通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象机制促进了异相催化中的C-H键活化。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及金属中心从有机分子中抽取氢原子，导致碳正离子的形成。H-抽象机制涉及金属中心从基质分子中抽取一个氢原子，导致一个自由基的形成。这些原理被应用于工业中的烷烃选择性氧化，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。例如，Li/Mg/O催化剂系统也适用于甲烷耦合，使乙烷在高于600°C的温度下激活，形成乙基自由基。这些自由基然后在气相中进一步反应。可以使用此催化系统实现高选择性和乙烯产率，特别是在向反应器添加氯化物化合物或对催化剂进行卤素掺杂的情况下。氯化物自由基增强了乙基自由基向乙烯的同质分解。此外，在氧化条件下，可以通过热或催化脱氢作用形成氢，或者通过稀土氧化物的水煤气变换平衡或中间乙氧基物种的分解到CO、C和H2来形成氢。
