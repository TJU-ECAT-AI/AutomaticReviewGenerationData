          [1] "The per- formances of catalysts reported in literature is summarized in Figs. 1 and 2, which report the highest achieved yields in a selectivity vs. conversion plot, and the levels of maximum productivity obtained at the average operative temperature for each system."

          [3] "The mechanism does not involve a classical redox-type cycle; thus, no furnishing of bulk oxygen occurs, and the catalyst only is involved in C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation, analogously to that occurring with methane."
          [4] "However, a progressive loss of Li occurs at temperatures higher than 700C. Such catalysts could be employed after a methane coupling reactor, in order to increase the yield to ethylene through oxydehydrogenation of formed ethane."
          [5] "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides [9,10]; the promoter effect is maintained by continuous feeding of the chlorine, which modifies the catalyst surface [ 11 ]; chlorine radicals are thought to favour the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene."
          [6] "A further aspect of this system is the formation of H2 under oxidative conditions [7,12]. H2 can be formed either via thermal or catalyzed dehy- drogenation; also, a contribution was proposed due to water gas shift equilibrium (over rare earth oxides) or of intermediate ethoxy species decom- position to CO, C and H2."

          The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These mechanisms involve the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by a metal center, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This process is applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. For instance, the Li/Mg/O catalyst system, which is also active for methane coupling, facilitates the activation of ethane at temperatures higher than 600°C to form ethyl radicals. These radicals then undergo further reactions in the gas phase. High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, particularly when chlorine-containing compounds are fed to the reactor or when the catalyst is doped with halides. Chlorine radicals enhance the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene. Additionally, under oxidative conditions, hydrogen can be formed via thermal or catalyzed dehydrogenation, or through the water gas shift equilibrium over rare earth oxides or the decomposition of intermediate ethoxy species to CO, C, and H2.

          在氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H摘除过程促进了异相催化中的C-H键活化。这些机制涉及金属中心对氢原子的摘除，形成碳阳离子中间体。这种方法被应用于烷烃的选择性氧化工业中，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。例如，Li/Mg/O催化剂系统也适用于甲烷耦合，使乙烷在高于600°C的温度下激活，形成乙基自由基。这些自由基然后在气相中进一步反应。可以使用此催化系统实现高选择性和乙烯产率，特别是在向反应器添加氯化物化合物或对催化剂进行卤素掺杂的情况下。氯化物自由基增强了乙基自由基向乙烯的同质分解。此外，在氧化条件下，可以通过热或催化脱氢作用形成氢，或者通过稀土氧化物的水煤气变换平衡或中间乙氧基物种分解到CO、C和H2来形成氢。

          Ethane and propane oxydehydrogenation processes aim to overcome the technical challenges faced by traditional dehydrogenation methods, including thermodynamic constraints, side reactions, energy requirements, and catalyst regeneration issues. This is accomplished by utilizing an oxygen acceptor in the reaction medium, allowing for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins. The performance of various catalysts is extensively compared in the literature, focusing on achieving high yields of olefins while maintaining selectivity across different conversion levels. Catalysts based on Group IA and IIA metals, transition metal oxides, and rare earth oxides show promising results, with some systems achieving yields as high as 34% to ethylene. However, the use of chlorine for enhancing selectivity and yield is limited by corrosion concerns in equipment.

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane often employs catalysts derived from Group IA and IIA metal ions and oxides, which are also effective in methane coupling reactions. These catalysts activate ethane at temperatures typically higher than 600°C to form ethyl radicals. The most successful catalyst among these is the Li/Mg/O system. Its mechanism involves C-H heterolytic scission, leading to ethyl radical formation without significant oxygen supply. The role of Li+-O- centers in abstracting a hydrogen atom and forming the ethyl radical is crucial. However, Li loss occurs at temperatures exceeding 700°C. These catalysts are suitable for use post-methane coupling reactors, aiming to increase ethylene yield through the oxydehydrogenation of generated ethane.
