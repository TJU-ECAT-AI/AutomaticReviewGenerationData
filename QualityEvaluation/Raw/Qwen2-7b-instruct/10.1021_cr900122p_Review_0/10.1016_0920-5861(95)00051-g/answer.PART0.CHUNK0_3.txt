[1] "The per- formances of catalysts reported in literature is summarized in Figs. 1 and 2, which report the highest achieved yields in a selectivity vs. conversion plot, and the levels of maximum productivity obtained at the average operative temperature for each system."
[2] "Generally, we can classify the catalysts into:a) Catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, which are also active for meth- ethylene selectivity, %"
[3] "The most successful of these catalysts is the Li/ Mg/O one. The mechanism does not involve a classical redox-type cycle; thus, no furnishing of bulk oxygen occurs, and the catalyst only is involved in C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation, analogously to that occurring with methane."
[4] "At lower temperatures the formation of a surface ethoxy species is preferred, precursor of COx formation."
[5] "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides [9,10]; the promoter effect is maintained by continuous feeding of the chlorine, which modifies the catalyst surface [ 11 ]; chlorine radicals are thought to favour the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene."

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These mechanisms involve the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by a metal center, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This process is applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the metal center activates the C-H bond for oxidation.

2. In the context of ethane oxydehydrogenation, the Li/Mg/O catalyst system is particularly effective. It does not involve a classical redox-type cycle but rather a mechanism of C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation, similar to the activation of methane. The mechanism involves the generation of Li+-O- centers capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom and forming the ethyl radical.

3. At lower temperatures during ethane oxydehydrogenation, the formation of a surface ethoxy species is preferred, which serves as a precursor for the formation of COx. This highlights the importance of temperature control in the process to optimize the formation of desired products.

4. High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved through the Li/Mg/O catalyst system, especially when chlorine-containing compounds are introduced to the reactor or when the catalyst is doped with halides. Continuous feeding of chlorine maintains the promoter effect, modifying the catalyst surface and favoring the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene.

1. 在异相催化中，孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上的作用是通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H摘除过程激活C-H键。这些机制涉及金属中心对氢原子的摘除，形成碳阳离子中间体。这种方法被应用于烷烃的选择性氧化工业中，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，其中金属中心激活C-H键进行氧化。

2. 在乙烷氧化脱氢的背景下，Li/Mg/O催化剂系统特别有效。它不涉及经典的氧化还原型循环，而是通过C-H异裂与自由基形成机制来激活C-H键，类似于甲烷的激活。该机制涉及生成Li+-O-中心，能够摘取一个氢原子并形成乙基自由基。

3. 在较低温度下进行乙烷氧化脱氢时，表面乙氧基物种的形成被优先考虑，这作为形成COx的前驱体。这强调了在过程中控制温度的重要性以优化所需产品的形成。

4. 通过引入氯化物化合物到反应器或向催化剂掺杂卤素，可以实现高选择性和高乙烯产率。连续供给氯化物保持促动效果，修改催化剂表面，并促进乙基自由基均相分解为乙烯。
