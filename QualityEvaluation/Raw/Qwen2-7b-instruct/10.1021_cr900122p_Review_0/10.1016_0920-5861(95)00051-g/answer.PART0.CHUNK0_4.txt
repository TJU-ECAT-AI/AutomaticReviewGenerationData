2.1. Oxydehydrogenation of ethane

Some of the catalysts developed for the reaction of methane coupling are also active in the ethane oxydehydrogenation. In other cases, entirely new catalytic systems have been developed. The per- formances of catalysts reported in literature is summarized in Figs. 1 and 2, which report the highest achieved yields in a selectivity vs. conversion plot, and the levels of maximum produc- tivity obtained at the average operative temperature for each system.

Generally, we can classify the catalysts into:a) Catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, which are also active for meth- ethylene selectivity, %

The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane often employs catalysts derived from Group IA and IIA metal ions and oxides, which are also effective in methane coupling reactions. These catalysts activate ethane at temperatures typically higher than 600°C to form ethyl radicals. The most successful catalyst among these is the Li/Mg/O system. Its mechanism involves C-H heterolytic scission, leading to ethyl radical formation without significant oxygen supply. The role of Li+-O- centers in abstracting a hydrogen atom and forming the ethyl radical is crucial. However, Li loss occurs at temperatures exceeding 700°C. These catalysts are suitable for use post-methane coupling reactors, aiming to increase ethylene yield through the oxydehydrogenation of generated ethane.

乙烷的氧化脱氢经常使用来自IA族和IIA族金属离子和氧化物的催化剂，这些催化剂也适用于甲烷耦合反应。这些催化剂在温度高于600°C时激活乙烷，形成乙基自由基。最成功的催化剂是Li/Mg/O系统。其机制涉及C-H异裂，导致乙基自由基的形成，而无需显著的氧气供应。Li+-O-中心在摘取一个氢原子并形成乙基自由基中起着关键作用。然而，在温度超过700°C时，Li会逐渐流失。这些催化剂适合用于甲烷耦合反应后，通过乙烷的氧化脱氢来增加乙烯产量。

2.1. Oxydehydrogenation of ethane

High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides [9,10]; the promoter effect is maintained by continuous feeding of the chlorine, which modifies the catalyst surface [11]; chlorine radicals are thought to favour the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene. Yields as high as 34% to ethylene could be achieved [3,10]; however, the use of chlorine is limited by problems related to equipment corrosion.

The selectivity to ethylene is increased with temperature; this is due to the fact that the formed ethyl radical at high temperature (600-700°C; above 700°C homogeneous overoxidation of ethylene decreases the selectivity) desorbs and forms ethylene in the gas phase via reaction with molecular oxygen; the high stability of ethylene and the contribution of the heterogeneously-initiated homogeneous reactions lead to the observed high selectivity. At lower temperatures the formation of a surface ethoxy species is preferred, precursor of COx formation.

A further aspect of this system is the formation of H2 under oxidative conditions [7,12]. H2 can be formed either via thermal or catalyzed dehy- drogenation; also, a contribution was proposed due to water gas shift equilibrium (over rare earth oxides) or of intermediate ethoxy species decom- position to CO, C and H2. Recently [13], it was found that catalysts like Ca/Ni/K/O and Li/Mg/ O are active in the water gas shift at the temperatures at which ethane oxydehydrogenation occurs.

Other systems that are active at temperatures higher than 600°C are Li20/TiO2, LiC1/NiO, LiC1/MnO2 and LiC1/Sm203. Dopants other than Li + have been reported: SnO2, Na20, lanthanides (mainly CeO2) [14].

b) Catalysts based on transition metal oxides [15-23]. Rare earth oxides are remarkably active [12,15], and yield ethylene with high productiv- ity and good selectivity. In addition, they exhibit a very high stability even at high temperature.

Doping Sm203 with alkali metals gives the best performances. These systems are believed to oper- ate with a mechanism similar to that of Li/Mg/O catalysts.

Also Na4P2OT/MnOx/SiO2 catalyst operates at very high temperature; such system is claimed for cyclic operation with ARCO [16] or Phillips [17] technology in circulating-bed applications, where higher selectivities are achieved by dividing the reaction into two stages: i) oxydehydrogenation of the paraffin in the absence of molecular oxygen and ii) regeneration of the catalyst by treatment with air.

In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon,through a classical redox cycle [18-23]. These systems can activate ethane at temperatures as low as 400°C, and the entire reaction is heterogeneous, hence controlled by the catalyst; the contribution of homogeneous reactions only occurs at the highest temperatures. Mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb were shown to be active in ethane oxidation at temperatures as low as 250°C, with selectivity to ethylene higher than 80%. However, the reported experimental conditions lead to an ethylene pro- ductivity which appears to be too low to have practical application. Mo/V/Nb/O also forms considerable amounts of acetic acid.

This section discusses various catalysts used in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, highlighting their properties and mechanisms. Chlorine-containing compounds or halide doping enhance catalyst efficiency by modifying the surface and promoting ethyl radical decomposition to ethylene. High temperatures increase selectivity due to the desorption of ethyl radicals forming ethylene through reaction with molecular oxygen. Lower temperatures favor the formation of ethoxy species, which leads to COx production. Under oxidative conditions, hydrogen can be produced through thermal or catalyzed dehydrogenation, or through water gas shift equilibrium or intermediate ethoxy species decomposition. Catalysts like Ca/Ni/K/O and Li/Mg/O show activity in water gas shift reactions. Transition metal oxides, particularly rare earth oxides, demonstrate high selectivity and productivity, with enhanced stability at elevated temperatures. Dopants such as SnO2, Na20, and lanthanides improve performance. The Na4P2OT/MnOx/SiO2 catalyst operates effectively at high temperatures, achieving cyclic operation with ARCO or Phillips technology. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts undergo redox cycles upon interacting with hydrocarbons, activating ethane at low temperatures. Mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb exhibit high selectivity towards ethylene but low practical productivity due to the formation of acetic acid.

这部分讨论了用于乙烷氧化脱氢的各种催化剂，强调了它们的特性和机制。含氯化合物或卤化物掺杂能通过修改表面并促进乙基自由基分解为乙烯来增强催化剂的效率。高温增加了选择性，因为乙基自由基在通过与分子氧反应形成乙烯的情况下脱附。较低的温度有利于形成乙氧基物种，导致COx产生。在氧化条件下，可以通过热或催化脱氢或通过水气转移平衡或中间乙氧基物种分解来产生氢。Ca/Ni/K/O和Li/Mg/O等催化剂显示出在水气转移反应中的活性。过渡金属氧化物，特别是稀土氧化物，表现出高选择性和生产力，并且在高温下具有增强稳定性。SnO2、Na20和镧系元素等掺杂剂可以改善性能。Na4P2OT/MnOx/SiO2催化剂在高温下有效运行，并且能够实现与ARCO或菲利普斯技术相关的循环操作。范德氧化物基催化剂在与碳氢化合物相互作用时经历还原循环，能够在低温下激活乙烷。Mo/V/Nb等混合氧化物显示出高达80%以上的乙烯选择性，但实验条件下的乙烯生产力似乎过低，无法应用于实际。Mo/V/Nb/O还会形成大量的醋酸。
