[1] "Commercial catalytic dehydrogenation processes suffer from several limitations, especially: i) ther- modynamic limitations on paraffin conversion; ii) side reactions such as thermal cracking; iii) strongly endothermic reactions to which large amounts of heat must be supplied at temperatures above the reaction temperature; iv) formation of coke on the catalyst which requires frequent regeneration."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation takes place in the presence of an hydrogen acceptor such as molec- ular oxygen in the reaction medium."
[3] "The per- formances of catalysts reported in literature is summarized in Figs. 1 and 2, which report the highest achieved yields in a selectivity vs. conversion plot, and the levels of maximum produc- tivity obtained at the average operative temperature for each system."

Ethane and propane oxydehydrogenation processes aim to overcome the technical challenges faced by traditional dehydrogenation methods, including thermodynamic constraints, side reactions, energy requirements, and catalyst regeneration issues. This is accomplished by utilizing an oxygen acceptor in the reaction medium, allowing for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins. The performance of various catalysts is extensively compared in the literature, focusing on achieving high yields of olefins while maintaining selectivity across different conversion levels. Catalysts based on Group IA and IIA metals, transition metal oxides, and rare earth oxides show promising results, with some systems achieving yields as high as 34% to ethylene. However, the use of chlorine for enhancing selectivity and yield is limited due to corrosion concerns in equipment.
