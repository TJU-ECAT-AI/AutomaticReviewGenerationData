[1] "The per- formances of catalysts reported in literature is summarized in Figs. 1 and 2, which report the highest achieved yields in a selectivity vs. conversion plot, and the levels of maximum productivity obtained at the average operative temperature for each system."
[2] "Generally, we can classify the catalysts into:a) Catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, which are also active for meth- ethylene selectivity, %"
[3] "The mechanism does not involve a classical redox-type cycle; thus, no furnishing of bulk oxygen occurs, and the catalyst only is involved in C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation, analogously to that occurring with methane."
[4] "However, a progressive loss of Li occurs at temperatures higher than 700C. Such catalysts could be employed after a methane coupling reactor, in order to increase the yield to ethylene through oxydehydrogenation of formed ethane."
[5] "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides [9,10]; the promoter effect is maintained by continuous feeding of the chlorine, which modifies the catalyst surface [ 11 ]; chlorine radicals are thought to favour the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene."
[6] "A further aspect of this system is the formation of H2 under oxidative conditions [7,12]. H2 can be formed either via thermal or catalyzed dehy- drogenation; also, a contribution was proposed due to water gas shift equilibrium (over rare earth oxides) or of intermediate ethoxy species decom- position to CO, C and H2."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from organic molecules by a metal center, leading to the formation of carbocations. The H-abstraction mechanism involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from a substrate molecule by a metal center, resulting in the formation of a radical. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, as demonstrated by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. For instance, the Li/Mg/O catalyst system, which is also active for methane coupling, facilitates the activation of ethane at temperatures higher than 600°C to form ethyl radicals. These radicals then undergo further reactions in the gas phase. High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, particularly when chlorine-containing compounds are fed to the reactor or when the catalyst is doped with halides. Chlorine radicals enhance the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene. Additionally, under oxidative conditions, hydrogen can be formed via thermal or catalyzed dehydrogenation, or through the water gas shift equilibrium over rare earth oxides or the decomposition of intermediate ethoxy species to CO, C, and H2.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料上通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象机制促进了异相催化中的C-H键活化。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及金属中心从有机分子中抽取氢原子，导致碳正离子的形成。H-抽象机制涉及金属中心从基质分子中抽取一个氢原子，导致一个自由基的形成。这些原理被应用于工业中的烷烃选择性氧化，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。例如，Li/Mg/O催化剂系统也适用于甲烷耦合，使乙烷在高于600°C的温度下激活，形成乙基自由基。这些自由基然后在气相中进一步反应。可以使用此催化系统实现高选择性和乙烯产率，特别是在向反应器添加氯化物化合物或对催化剂进行卤素掺杂的情况下。氯化物自由基增强了乙基自由基向乙烯的同质分解。此外，在氧化条件下，可以通过热或催化脱氢作用形成氢，或者通过稀土氧化物的水煤气变换平衡或中间乙氧基物种的分解到CO、C和H2来形成氢。

The oxidative dehydrogenation process, which involves an oxygen acceptor in the reaction medium, offers a solution to the technical challenges faced by traditional dehydrogenation methods. Catalysts used in ethane dehydrogenation include those based on Group IA and IIA metals, such as Li/Mg/O, and transition metal oxides, like rare earth oxides and mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb. The Li/Mg/O catalyst, for instance, facilitates C-H bond activation through a mechanism involving Li+-O- centers that abstract H atoms, forming ethyl radicals. High selectivities and yields of ethylene are achieved by operating at high temperatures or by adding chlorine-containing compounds or halides to the reactor. However, the efficiency of these catalysts may be limited by low productivity, corrosion issues, and the formation of unwanted byproducts like acetic acid. In industrial applications, alumina-catalyst is employed in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

Ethane and propane oxydehydrogenation processes aim to overcome the technical challenges faced by traditional dehydrogenation methods, including thermodynamic constraints, side reactions, energy requirements, and catalyst regeneration issues. This is accomplished by utilizing an oxygen acceptor in the reaction medium, allowing for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins. The performance of various catalysts is extensively compared in the literature, focusing on achieving high yields of olefins while maintaining selectivity across different conversion levels. Catalysts based on Group IA and IIA metals, transition metal oxides, and rare earth oxides show promising results, with some systems achieving yields as high as 34% to ethylene. However, the use of chlorine for enhancing selectivity and yield is limited due to corrosion concerns in equipment.

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These mechanisms involve the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by a metal center, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This process is applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the metal center activates the C-H bond for oxidation.

2. In the context of ethane oxydehydrogenation, the Li/Mg/O catalyst system is particularly effective. It does not involve a classical redox-type cycle but rather a mechanism of C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation, similar to the activation of methane. The mechanism involves the generation of Li+-O- centers capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom and forming the ethyl radical.

3. At lower temperatures during ethane oxydehydrogenation, the formation of a surface ethoxy species is preferred, which serves as a precursor for the formation of COx. This highlights the importance of temperature control in the process to optimize the formation of desired products.

4. High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved through the Li/Mg/O catalyst system, especially when chlorine-containing compounds are introduced to the reactor or when the catalyst is doped with halides. Continuous feeding of chlorine maintains the promoter effect, modifying the catalyst surface and favoring the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene.

1. 在异相催化中，孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上的作用是通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H摘除过程激活C-H键。这些机制涉及金属中心对氢原子的摘除，形成碳阳离子中间体。这种方法被应用于烷烃的选择性氧化工业中，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，其中金属中心激活C-H键进行氧化。

2. 在乙烷氧化脱氢的背景下，Li/Mg/O催化剂系统特别有效。它不涉及经典的氧化还原型循环，而是通过C-H异裂与自由基形成机制来激活C-H键，类似于甲烷的激活。该机制涉及生成Li+-O-中心，能够摘取一个氢原子并形成乙基自由基。

3. 在较低温度下进行乙烷氧化脱氢时，表面乙氧基物种的形成被优先考虑，这作为形成COx的前驱体。这强调了在过程中控制温度的重要性以优化所需产品的形成。

4. 通过引入氯化物化合物到反应器或向催化剂掺杂卤素，可以实现高选择性和高乙烯产率。连续供给氯化物保持促动效果，修改催化剂表面，并促进乙基自由基均相分解为乙烯。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane often employs catalysts derived from Group IA and IIA metal ions and oxides, which are also effective in methane coupling reactions. These catalysts activate ethane at temperatures typically higher than 600°C to form ethyl radicals. The most successful catalyst among these is the Li/Mg/O system. Its mechanism involves C-H heterolytic scission, leading to ethyl radical formation without significant oxygen supply. The role of Li+-O- centers in abstracting a hydrogen atom and forming the ethyl radical is crucial. However, Li loss occurs at temperatures exceeding 700°C. These catalysts are suitable for use post-methane coupling reactors, aiming to increase ethylene yield through the oxydehydrogenation of generated ethane.

2.1. Oxydehydrogenation of ethane

High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides [9,10]; the promoter effect is maintained by continuous feeding of the chlorine, which modifies the catalyst surface [11]; chlorine radicals are thought to favour the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene. Yields as high as 34% to ethylene could be achieved [3,10]; however, the use of chlorine is limited by problems related to equipment corrosion.

The selectivity to ethylene is increased with temperature; this is due to the fact that the formed ethyl radical at high temperature (600-700°C; above 700°C homogeneous overoxidation of ethylene decreases the selectivity) desorbs and forms ethylene in the gas phase via reaction with molecular oxygen; the high stability of ethylene and the contribution of the heterogeneously-initiated homogeneous reactions lead to the observed high selectivity. At lower temperatures the formation of a surface ethoxy species is preferred, precursor of COx formation.

A further aspect of this system is the formation of H2 under oxidative conditions [7,12]. H2 can be formed either via thermal or catalyzed dehy- drogenation; also, a contribution was proposed due to water gas shift equilibrium (over rare earth oxides) or of intermediate ethoxy species decom- position to CO, C and H2. Recently [13], it was found that catalysts like Ca/Ni/K/O and Li/Mg/ O are active in the water gas shift at the temperatures at which ethane oxydehydrogenation occurs.

Other systems that are active at temperatures higher than 600°C are Li20/TiO2, LiC1/NiO, LiC1/MnO2 and LiC1/Sm203. Dopants other than Li + have been reported: SnO2, Na20, lanthanides (mainly CeO2) [14].

b) Catalysts based on transition metal oxides [15-23]. Rare earth oxides are remarkably active [12,15], and yield ethylene with high productiv- ity and good selectivity. In addition, they exhibit a very high stability even at high temperature.

Doping Sm203 with alkali metals gives the best performances. These systems are believed to oper- ate with a mechanism similar to that of Li/Mg/O catalysts.

Also Na4P2OT/MnOx/SiO2 catalyst operates at very high temperature; such system is claimed for cyclic operation with ARCO [16] or Phillips [17] technology in circulating-bed applications, where higher selectivities are achieved by dividing the reaction into two stages: i) oxydehydrogenation of the paraffin in the absence of molecular oxygen and ii) regeneration of the catalyst by treatment with air.

In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon,through a classical redox cycle [18-23]. These systems can activate ethane at temperatures as low as 400°C, and the entire reaction is heterogeneous, hence controlled by the catalyst; the contribution of homogeneous reactions only occurs at the highest temperatures. Mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb were shown to be active in ethane oxidation at temperatures as low as 250°C, with selectivity to ethylene higher than 80%. However, the reported experimental conditions lead to an ethylene pro- ductivity which appears to be too low to have practical application. Mo/V/Nb/O also forms considerable amounts of acetic acid.

This section discusses various catalysts used in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, highlighting their properties and mechanisms. Chlorine-containing compounds or halide doping enhance catalyst efficiency by modifying the surface and promoting ethyl radical decomposition to ethylene. High temperatures increase selectivity due to the desorption of ethyl radicals forming ethylene through reaction with molecular oxygen. Lower temperatures favor the formation of ethoxy species, which leads to COx production. Under oxidative conditions, hydrogen can be produced through thermal or catalyzed dehydrogenation, or through water gas shift equilibrium or intermediate ethoxy species decomposition. Catalysts like Ca/Ni/K/O and Li/Mg/O show activity in water gas shift reactions. Transition metal oxides, particularly rare earth oxides, demonstrate high selectivity and productivity, with enhanced stability at elevated temperatures. Dopants such as SnO2, Na20, and lanthanides improve performance. The Na4P2OT/MnOx/SiO2 catalyst operates effectively at high temperatures, achieving cyclic operation with ARCO or Phillips technology. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts undergo redox cycles upon interacting with hydrocarbons, activating ethane at low temperatures. Mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb exhibit high selectivity towards ethylene but low practical productivity due to the formation of acetic acid.

这部分讨论了用于乙烷氧化脱氢的各种催化剂，强调了它们的特性和机制。含氯化合物或卤化物掺杂能通过修改表面并促进乙基自由基分解为乙烯来增强催化剂的效率。高温增加了选择性，因为乙基自由基在通过与分子氧反应形成乙烯的情况下脱附。较低的温度有利于形成乙氧基物种，导致COx产生。在氧化条件下，可以通过热或催化脱氢或通过水气转移平衡或中间乙氧基物种分解来产生氢。Ca/Ni/K/O和Li/Mg/O等催化剂显示出在水气转移反应中的活性。过渡金属氧化物，特别是稀土氧化物，表现出高选择性和生产力，并且在高温下具有增强稳定性。SnO2、Na20和镧系元素等掺杂剂可以改善性能。Na4P2OT/MnOx/SiO2催化剂在高温下有效运行，并且能够实现与ARCO或菲利普斯技术相关的循环操作。范德氧化物基催化剂在与碳氢化合物相互作用时经历还原循环，能够在低温下激活乙烷。Mo/V/Nb等混合氧化物显示出高达80%以上的乙烯选择性，但实验条件下的乙烯生产力似乎过低，无法应用于实际。Mo/V/Nb/O还会形成大量的醋酸。
