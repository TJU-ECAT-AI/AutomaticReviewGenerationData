i. "Commercial catalytic dehydrogenation processes suffer from several limitations, especially: i) ther- modynamic limitations on paraffin conversion; ii) side reactions such as thermal cracking; iii) strongly endothermic reactions to which large amounts of heat must be supplied at temperatures above the reaction temperature; iv) formation of coke on the catalyst which requires frequent regeneration."
ii. "Oxidative dehydrogenation takes place in the presence of an hydrogen acceptor such as molec- ular oxygen in the reaction medium."
iii. "This process has the potential to overcome the major technical problems associated with pure dehydrogenation."
iv. "Catalysts for coupling operate at 700- 800C, and the hot outlet stream could be fed to a downstream catalytic or thermal oxydehydrogen- ation reactor."
v. "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides."
vi. "Other systems that are active at temperatures higher than 600C are Li20/TiO2, LiC1/NiO, LiC1/MnO2 and LiC1/Sm203."
vii. "In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon,through a classical redox cycle."
viii. "Mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb were shown to be active in ethane oxidation at temperatures as low as 250C, with selectivity to ethylene higher than 80%."
ix. "However, the reported experimental conditions lead to an ethylene pro- ductivity which appears to be too low to have practical application."
x. "Mo/V/Nb/O also forms considerable amounts of acetic acid."
xi. "Alumina-Catalyst is used in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."

The oxidative dehydrogenation process, which involves an oxygen acceptor in the reaction medium, offers a solution to the technical challenges faced by traditional dehydrogenation methods. Catalysts used in ethane dehydrogenation include those based on Group IA and IIA metals, such as Li/Mg/O, and transition metal oxides, like rare earth oxides and mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb. The Li/Mg/O catalyst, for instance, facilitates C-H bond activation through a mechanism involving Li+-O- centers that abstract H atoms, forming ethyl radicals. High selectivities and yields of ethylene are achieved by operating at high temperatures or by adding chlorine-containing compounds or halides to the reactor. However, the efficiency of these catalysts may be limited by low productivity, corrosion issues, and the formation of unwanted byproducts like acetic acid. In industrial applications, alumina-catalyst is employed in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

氧化脱氢化过程，通过反应介质中的氧接受体，能够解决传统脱氢化方法面临的技术问题。用于乙烷脱氢的催化剂包括基于IA族和IIA族金属（如Li/Mg/O）的催化剂，以及过渡金属氧化物（如稀土氧化物和Mo/V/Nb的混合氧化物）。例如，Li/Mg/O催化剂通过涉及生成Li+-O-中心来激活C-H键，这些中心从分子中提取H原子，形成乙基自由基。通过在高温下操作或向反应器中添加氯化物或卤素化合物，可以实现高选择性和乙烯产量。然而，这些催化剂的效率可能受到低生产力、腐蚀问题和形成副产品（如乙酸）的影响。在工业应用中，使用氧化铝催化剂将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。
