1. The zinc oxide utilized in this investigation was sourced from the New Jersey Zinc Company as Kadox 25. Sample weights varied from 0.1 to 20 grams, subjected to a pressing process at 25,000 pounds per square inch in a stainless steel plug. Subsequent to this, they were fragmented prior to measurement in order to enhance flow properties.

2. The comparative kinetic and adsorption measurements conducted during the exchange process, in the presence or absence of oxygen and nitrogen, are examined and correlated with the various proposed mechanisms in the discussion that follows.

3. It has been demonstrated that the adsorption of oxygen on a surface facilitates the catalysis of ortho-para conversion.

4. Both mechanism A and B can lead to exchange reactions over zinc oxide, and both have implications for isotopic exchange.

5. The hindering of rotation plays a crucial role in altering energy level differences between deuterium and hydrogen, thus impacting the rates of their conversions.

6. The comparison between the rates of hydrogen and deuterium allotropic conversion reveals that the hindering of rotation leads to a more significant conversion rate for deuterium than for hydrogen.

1. 研究中使用的锌氧化物来源于新泽西锌公司，名为Kadox 25。样本重量从0.1到20克不等，在不锈钢插件中以25,000磅每平方英寸的压力进行压制。随后，它们被破碎以提高流动特性，以便在测量前进行称重。

2. 在氧气和氮气的存在或不存在下进行的交换过程中的动力学和吸附测量进行了比较，并与提出的各种机制进行了讨论。

3. 已经证明，氧在表面上的吸附促进了正交-参数转换的催化作用。

4. 机制A和B都可能导致锌氧化物上的交换反应，并且两者都与同位素交换有关。

5. 旋转的阻碍导致了氘和氢之间的能级差的改变，因此其转换速率更高。

6. 氢和氘全同化转换率的比较显示，旋转的阻碍导致氘的转换速率比氢更显著。
