[1] "For years the strongest nonmechanistic evi- dence for chemisorbed molecular hy- drogen stemmed from measurements of the isosteric heats of adsorption (2) but more recently,studies of the chromato- graphic separation (17,22,23) of the iso- topes and allotropes of hydrogen have strongly supported this view."
[2] "The effect of oxygen and nitrogen adsorbed at 78K with the pair sites on zinc oxide (and the hydrogen adsorbed on these sites) are different (34)."
[3] "The adsorption of oxygen on a surface has been shown to promote the catal- ysis of ortho-para conversion (12)."
[4] "The kinetic and adsorption measurements during ex- change in the presence and absence of ox- ygen and nitrogen are compared and their relationship to the various proposed mech- anisms are discussed below."
[5] "The allotropic conversion by a paramagnetic mechanism has been treated theoretically for gas phase molecular collision with a paramagnetic molecule by Wigner (8)."
[6] "The hindering of rotation effects a change in energy level differences that is more dra- matic for deuterium than for hydrogen and, therefore,the rate of conversion for deuterium can be greater than that for hydrogen."
