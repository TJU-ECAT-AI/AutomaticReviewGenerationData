1. The zinc oxide utilized in the study was sourced from the New Jersey Zinc Co. as Kadox 25.
2. The adsorption of oxygen on a surface has demonstrated capability to enhance the catalytic process of ortho-para conversion.
3. The impact of nitrogen adsorption on a catalyst, whose conversion rate had been augmented by the addition of 0.25 cm3 g-1 of oxygen at 78K, is illustrated in Figure 3.
4. The comparison of kinetic and adsorption data taken in the presence versus absence of oxygen and nitrogen is analyzed in relation to the various hypothesized mechanisms in the discussion section.
