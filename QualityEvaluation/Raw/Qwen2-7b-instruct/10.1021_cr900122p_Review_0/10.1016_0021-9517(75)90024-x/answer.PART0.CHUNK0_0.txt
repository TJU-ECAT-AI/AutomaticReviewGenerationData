1. For years, the strongest nonmechanistic evidence for chemisorbed molecular hydrogen came from isosteric heats of adsorption measurements (2). However, recent studies of the chromatographic separation of hydrogen isotopes and allotropes (17,22,23) have strongly supported this view.
2. The adsorption behavior of oxygen and nitrogen with the pair sites on zinc oxide differs (34).
3. The adsorption of oxygen on a surface enhances ortho-para conversion (12).
4. The study compares kinetic and adsorption measurements during exchange in the presence and absence of oxygen and nitrogen and discusses their relationship to proposed mechanisms.
5. Wigner (8) has theoretically addressed the allotropic conversion involving a paramagnetic mechanism in gas phase molecular collisions with a paramagnetic molecule.
6. The hindering of rotation affects energy level differences more significantly for deuterium than for hydrogen, leading to a greater conversion rate for deuterium.

1. 长期以来，化学吸附的分子氢最强的非机制证据来自于等熵吸附热测量（2）。然而，最近通过色谱分离氢同位素和同分异构体的研究（17、22、23）强烈支持了这一观点。
2. 氧气和氮气在锌氧化物的配对位点上的吸附行为存在差异（34）。
3. 表面吸附的氧气促进了正-反氢转化（12）。
4. 研究比较了在氧气和氮气存在与否下进行交换过程中的动力学和吸附测量，并探讨了这些测量与各种假设机制的关系。
5. 根据Wigner（8）的理论，气相分子碰撞与顺磁分子的相互作用涉及到顺-反氢转化的顺磁机制。
6. 旋转的抑制导致了氢氘同位素之间能级差的变化更为显著，因此氘的转化速率高于氢。
