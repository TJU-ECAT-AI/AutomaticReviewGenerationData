[1] "The chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina was investigated over a wide range of temperatures (-196-45OC)."
[2] "At least five different states of chemisorbed hydrogen on alumina were detected by the temperature-programmed desorption a+ peaks with the peak maxima at about -40: 25, 100, 200, and 320C."
[3] "The experimental results indicate that at least four types of chemisorption, H(1), H(III), H(IV), and H(V),shared all or part of the sites which were the surface defects of alumina."
[4] "H(1) is the weakest chemisorpt,ion which occurs rapidly and reversibly at -75C and fits the dissociative Lnngmuir isotherm."
[5] "The chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina is generally slow."
[6] "The site densities summarized in Table 1 have been calculated by tentatively assuming that all adsorption is atomic."
[7] "It was found that one atom of preadsorhed H(fI1) or H(V) blocked about 0.5 sites for H(I) chemisorption."

The chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina involves at least five distinct states, characterized by peaks at -40, 25, 100, 200, and 320°C. Four of these states, H(1), H(III), H(IV), and H(V), share surface defect sites on alumina. H(1) is the weakest form, fitting a dissociative Langmuir isotherm, and is involved in the H₂-D₂ exchange reaction at low temperatures. The overall chemisorption process is generally slow. Surface defect sites on alumina surface are shared among multiple hydrogen chemisorption states. One atom of preadsorbed H(II1) or H(V) blocks approximately 0.5 sites for H(I) chemisorption.

氢在氧化铝上的化学吸附涉及至少五种不同的状态，分别在-40、25、100、200和320°C处达到峰值。其中四个状态，H(1)、H(III)、H(IV)和H(V)，共享铝表面缺陷的位点。H(1)是最弱的形式，符合脱附朗缪尔等温线，并且在低温下参与H₂-D₂交换反应。整个化学吸附过程通常较慢。铝表面上的缺陷位点被多种氢化学吸附状态共享。一个预吸附的H(II1)或H(V)原子阻塞大约0.5个H(I)化学吸附位点。
