[1] "At least five different states of chemisorbed hydrogen on alumina were detected by the temperature-programmed desorption a+ peaks with the peak maxima at about -40: 25, 100, 200, and 320C. These peaks (or types) are referred to as H(I), H(II), H(III), H(IV), and H(V), respectively."
[2] "H(1) is the weakest chemisorption which occurs rapidly and reversibly at -75C and fits the dissociative Langmuir isotherm."
[3] "Two kinds of reactions were examined: reaction between H, preadsorhed on alumina and Dz in the gas phase (SW-face exchange), and reaction of gaseous mixtures of H, and D, without preadsorption."
[4] "In these investigations,different experimental conditions were used, and it is, therefore, difficult to draw general conclusions, except that the chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina is generally slow."
[5] "The chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina was investigated over a wide range of temperatures (-196-45OC)."
[6] "The experimental results indicated that at least four types of chemisorption, H(1), H(III), H(IV), and H(V),shared all or part of the sites which were the surface defects of alumina."
[7] "It was found that the adsorption was quite reversible."
[8] "The fast adsorption is equilibrated in 10-30 min at room temperature,while the slow adsorption continues up to more than 70 hr."
[9] "The peak height of H(IV) was comparable to that of H(III),even for room temperature adsorption,so that the two peak maxima were clearly separated."
[10] "The total number of sites (1.9 × 1013) includes all types of chemisorption but are occupied mainly by hydrogen chemisorbed as types H(III) and H(V)."

The study revealed a complex character of the chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina, with at least five different states of chemisorbed hydrogen being detected, including H(I), H(II), H(III), H(IV), and H(V). H(1) is the weakest chemisorption, fitting the dissociative Langmuir isotherm and occurring rapidly and reversibly at -75C. The chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina is generally slow, and the experimental results indicated that at least four types of chemisorption shared all or part of the sites which were the surface defects of alumina. The fast adsorption is equilibrated in 10-30 minutes at room temperature, while the slow adsorption continues up to more than 70 hours. The peak height of H(IV) was comparable to that of H(III), even for room temperature adsorption, so that the two peak maxima were clearly separated.

研究揭示了铝氧合物上氢化学吸附的复杂特性，检测到了至少五种不同状态的氢化学吸附，包括H(I)，H(II)，H(III)，H(IV)和H(V)。H(1)是最弱的化学吸附，符合解离朗缪尔等温线，并在-75°C快速可逆地发生。铝氧合物上的氢化学吸附通常较慢，实验结果表明至少有四种类型的化学吸附共享表面缺陷的一部分。快速吸附在室温下平衡时间为10-30分钟，而缓慢吸附持续时间超过70小时。H(IV)的峰高度与H(III)相当，即使是在室温下的吸附，因此两个峰值最大值明显分开。
