The chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina was studied over a wide range of temperatures, revealing five distinct states or types of chemisorption: H(I), H(II), H(III), H(IV), and H(V). These types of chemisorption were associated with peak maxima at temperatures of about -40, 25, 100, 200, and 320°C, respectively. The experimental findings suggested that at least four of these types of chemisorption, H(1), H(III), H(IV), and H(V), shared some of the same surface defect sites of the alumina. The total number of active sites for chemisorption was determined to be 1.9 x 10^13 sites/cm². At 300°C, the rate of adsorption displayed the best linearity against pressure over a range of 0.3 to 10 Torr, with a surface coverage from 0.02 to 0.13. The peak height of H(IV) was comparable to that of H(III) at room temperature, indicating a clear separation between the two peak maxima in the chromatogram. However, in the chromatogram in Figure 1, H(IV) was only a shoulder of H(II1).

氢在氧化铝上的化学吸附在广泛的温度范围内进行了研究，揭示了五种不同的状态或类型：H(I)，H(II)，H(III)，H(IV)和H(V)。这些类型的化学吸附与大约-40、25、100、200和320°C的峰最大值相关联。实验结果表明，至少四种化学吸附类型H(1)、H(III)、H(IV)和H(V)共享了氧化铝表面缺陷的部分位点。确定了总共有1.9 x 10^13个活性位点用于化学吸附。在300°C时，吸附速率在0.3至10托的压力范围内显示了最佳的线性关系，表面覆盖率为0.02至0.13。在300°C时，吸附速率在0.3至10托的压力范围内显示了最佳的线性关系，表面覆盖率为0.02至0.13。H(IV)的峰高度与H(III)相当，在室温吸附下，两个峰的最大值明显分开。然而，在图1的色谱图中，H(IV)只是H(II1)的一个肩峰。
