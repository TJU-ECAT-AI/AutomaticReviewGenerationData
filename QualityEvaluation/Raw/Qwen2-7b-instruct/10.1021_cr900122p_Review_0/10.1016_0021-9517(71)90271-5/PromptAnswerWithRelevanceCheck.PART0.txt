The chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina was investigated over a wide range of temperatures (-196-45OC). At least five different states of chemisorbed hydrogen on alumina were detected by the temperature-programmed desorption a+ peaks with the peak maxima at about -40: 25, 100, 200, and 320C. These peaks (or types) are referred to as H(I), H(II), H(III), H(IV), and H(V), respectively. Except for H(IV), each type of chemisorption was separately investigated in more detail by measuring either the isotherms or the rates of adsorption and desorption. H(1) is the weakest chemisorption which occurs rapidly and reversibly at -75C and fits the dissociative Langmuir isotherm. At room temperature, H(H) and H(II1) are the major chcmisorption: The former is a reversible chemisorption which is equilibrated in 30 min, while the latter is a slow irreversible chemisorption which continues up to 70 hr at room temperature. H(V), the strongest chemisorption, is too slow to be detected at temperatures below 25OC, but it is the major adsorption at higher temperatures. The total number of active sites for chemisorption was found to be 1.9 X 10 sites/c.m. The experimental results indicate that at least four types of chemisorption, H(1), H(III), H(IV), and H(V), shared all or part of the sites which were the surface defects of alumina. Isotopic exchange of hydrogen and deuterium was also studied in connection with the above results. Two kinds of reactions were carried out: (1) surface-exchange reaction between various types of preadsorbed H, on alumina and D? in the gas phase; and (2) equilibration reaction of gaseous mixtures of H? and DZ but without preadsorption. The results showed that at low temperatures the isotopic-exchange reaction occurred only through hydrogen involve the other tppps of chemisorption.

Alumina was an active catalyst for Hz-D2 equilibration reaction, a number of investigations have been made to clarify the mechanisms of equilibration and ortho-para conversion reactions of hydrogen on alumina (S-5). Recently Yasu-mori and Ohno (6) studied the kinetics of these reactions on y-alumina in detail, and showed that their results were explaincd by the rate equations of Langmuir-Hinshelwood chcmisorbrd as type H(1) and did not 11clwood type. Van Cauwelaert and Hall (7) also made an extensive study of cqui- lib&ion and conversion reactions mrith particular emphasis on active centers of alumina by using CO2 as a poison.

The present study revealed a complex character of the chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina. At least five different types of chemisorbed hydrogen were detected by the temperature-programmed desorption as different peaks which anneared respectively at about -40, 35, 100, 200, and 320C. These peaks (or types) are referred to as H(I), H(II), H(III), H(IV), and H(V), respectively. The experimental results indicated that at least four types of chemisorption, H(I), H(III), H(IV), and H(V), shared all or part of the same sites which were defects of alumina surface. It was found that H(1) was the weakest chemisorption, and it fitted the dissociative Langmuir isotherm, and that this was the only type of chemisorption which was involved in the Hz--D, exchange reaction at low temperatures.

1. The chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina exhibits a complex character with five distinct states detected at temperatures ranging from -196 to 45°C. These states, named H(I) to H(V), have peak maxima at -40, 25, 100, 200, and 320°C, respectively. H(1) is the weakest chemisorption, fitting the dissociative Langmuir isotherm, and is involved in the hydrogen isotopic exchange reaction at low temperatures. H(III) and H(V) are found to share surface defect sites with other types of chemisorption on the alumina surface.

2. Alumina is an active catalyst for hydrogen isotopic exchange and equilibrium reactions, with mechanisms elucidated through detailed studies by Yasu-mori and Ohno, and Van Cauwelaert and Hall. The kinetics of these reactions are explained by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate equation, highlighting the role of active centers on the alumina surface.

3. The study uncovered a total of five chemisorption states on alumina, with H(I), H(III), H(IV), and H(V) sharing surface defect sites. H(1) is the weakest chemisorption, fitting the dissociative Langmuir isotherm, and is the only type involved in the hydrogen isotopic exchange reaction at low temperatures.

The chemisorption of hydrogen on alumina involves at least five distinct states, characterized by peaks at -40, 25, 100, 200, and 320°C. Four of these states, H(1), H(III), H(IV), and H(V), share surface defect sites on alumina. H(1) is the weakest form, fitting a dissociative Langmuir isotherm, and is involved in the H₂-D₂ exchange reaction at low temperatures. The overall chemisorption process is generally slow. Surface defect sites on alumina surface are shared among multiple hydrogen chemisorption states. One atom of preadsorbed H(II1) or H(V) blocks approximately 0.5 sites for H(I) chemisorption.
