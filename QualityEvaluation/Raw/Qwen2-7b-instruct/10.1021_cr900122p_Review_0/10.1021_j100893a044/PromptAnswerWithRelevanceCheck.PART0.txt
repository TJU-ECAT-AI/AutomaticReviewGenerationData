[1] "The manner in which hydrogen is activated by aluminium and silica-alumina surfaces is not at all understood."
[2] "By analogy with the present methane results, hydrogen may be cleaved on the aluminium surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH."
[3] "In both cases, the driving force seems to be the screening (restoration of coordination around) the exposed cation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document explains that the activation of hydrogen by aluminium surfaces involves the cleavage of hydrogen to form an Al-H bond and an adjacent OH group. This process is driven by the screening of the exposed cation, which restores coordination around the exposed aluminium ion. The mechanism for this activation process is not fully understood, especially when applied to silica-alumina surfaces.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

文档解释说，氢在铝表面的活化涉及到氢的断裂以形成Al-H键和相邻的OH基团。这一过程是由暴露离子的屏蔽（恢复周围配位）驱动的，这恢复了暴露的铝离子周围的配位。对于硅酸铝表面，这一激活过程的机制尚不完全清楚。

[1] "It seems reasonable to ascribe this slower process to the diffusion of hydrogen from distant locations, to positions adjacent to the active sites."
[2] "With the former, there was no evidence of heterogeneity of catalyst hydrogen; the activation energy for exchange was much higher and reaction did not occur at measurable rates below 400 °F."
[3] "By analogy with the present methane results, hydrogen may be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH."
[4] "The identity of the tertiary ion is conserved either by hydride transfer from incoming molecules or by recombination with the carbonium ion on de- sorption."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The slower exchange process occurring in addition to the rapid exchange identified with hydroxyl groups adjacent to active sites is attributed to the diffusion of hydrogen from distant locations, to positions adjacent to the active sites.

2. On silica-alumina, there was no indication of heterogeneity of catalyst hydrogen. The activation energy for exchange was significantly higher, and the reaction did not occur at measurable rates below 400 °F.

3. Analogously to the findings with methane, hydrogen might be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H bond and an adjacent OH group.

4. The identity of the tertiary ion is preserved either through hydride transfer from incoming molecules or by recombination with the carbonium ion upon desorption.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 这个较慢的交换过程被归因于氢原子从远处位置扩散到活性位点附近的位点。

2. 在硅酸铝上，没有发现催化剂氢的异质性。交换激活能更高，低于400°F时无法检测到反应。

3. 类比甲烷的结果，氢可以在氧化铝表面上断裂形成Al-H键和相邻的OH基团。

4. 三甲基离子的身份通过从分子转移氢或在脱附时与碳正离子重组得以保持。

The isotopic mixing of CD4 and CH4 over alumina involved exchange with several percent of the catalyst hydrogen. This hydrogen resided at very definite sites on the alumina surface. The deuterons introduced by exchange with CD4 could be quantitatively recovered by a subsequent exchange with CH4, indicating the presence of specific sites for the exchange process.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The exchange between the hydrogen held by isobutane and deuterated cracking catalysts has been interpreted in terms of abstraction of the tertiary hydride ion by the catalyst to form the isobutyl carbonium ion; the nine remaining hydrogens on the carbonium ion then exchange freely with available catalyst hydroxyl groups.

With respect to the mechanism of hydrogen exchange with catalyst deoxy groups, on alumina, it is thought that the methyl group is held by the aluminium ion with concomitant formation of a hydroxyl group. Extending current thoughts concerning silica-alumina, it might suggest that the methyl group be attached to oxygen and hydrogen to the cation. This chemistry is plausible but highly speculative and should be considered so.

关于催化剂去氧基团中氢交换的机制，在氧化铝上，人们认为甲基集团由铝离子保持，同时形成一个羟基。在硅酸铝的情况下，可能建议甲基集团附着在氧原子上，而氢则附着在阳离子上。这种化学反应是可能的，但高度推测性，应被视为如此。

[1] "The isotopic mixing of CDh and CHI over alumina involved exchange with several per cent of the catalyst hydrogen. Moreover, this hydrogen resided at very definite sites on the alumina surface."
[2] "The manner in which hydrogen is activated by alu- mina and silica-alumina surfaces is not at all understood."
[3] "Studies of the exchange between the hydrogen held by isobutane and deuterated cracking catalysts have been interpreted in terms of abstraction of the tertiary hydride ion by the catalyst to form the isobutyl carbonium ion."
[4] "With silica-alumina, the situation is even less clear and anything that is written must necessarily be classified as speculation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Isotopic mixing between CDh and CHI over alumina occurred through exchange with a significant percentage of the catalyst hydrogen, which was located at specific sites on the alumina surface. The hydrogen was activated by the alumina surface, possibly through cleavage of the methane molecule, leading to formation of an Al-H bond and an adjacent OH group.

2. The mechanism by which hydrogen is activated by alumina and silica-alumina surfaces remains unclear. The activation process might involve cleavage of the hydrogen molecule, leading to formation of an Al-H bond and an adjacent OH group on the surface.

3. The exchange of hydrogen held by isobutane and deuterated cracking catalysts has been explained through abstraction of the tertiary hydride ion by the catalyst, forming the isobutyl carbonium ion. The remaining nine hydrogens on the carbonium ion then exchange freely with available catalyst hydroxyl groups.

4. The situation with silica-alumina catalysts is even less clear, and any conclusions drawn about hydrogen activation must be considered speculative. The nature of active sites on silica-alumina catalysts is not fully understood, and theories about hydrogen activation differ significantly from those involving alumina.

1. 在氧化铝上，CDh 和 CHI 的同位素混合通过与催化剂氢的几个百分比进行交换发生。此外，这种氢位于氧化铝表面的非常确定的位置上。氢在氧化铝表面的激活可能涉及甲烷分子的裂解，形成一个 Al-H 键和一个相邻的 OH 群体。

2. 氧化铝和硅酸铝表面氢的激活机制尚不清楚。激活过程可能涉及氢分子的裂解，导致在表面形成一个 Al-H 键和一个相邻的 OH 群体。

3. 对于异丁烷携带的氢和脱氘化裂解催化剂之间的交换，已通过催化剂吸收三级氢离子形成异丁基碳正离子进行了解释。碳正离子上的剩余九个氢原子随后与催化剂羟基自由交换。

4. 对于硅酸铝催化剂的情况则更加模糊，任何关于氢激活的结论都必须被视作推测。对于硅酸铝催化剂活性位点的性质尚未完全理解，关于氢激活的理论与涉及氧化铝的理论存在显著差异。

The literature discusses the activation of C-H bonds on oxide materials, particularly focusing on alumina. The isolated metal centers on these materials facilitate the activation of C-H bonds through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. For instance, hydrogen can be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH group. However, the situation with silica-alumina is less clear, and any explanations must be considered speculative. In the context of industrial applications, such as the selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to convert butane into maleic anhydride. The literature provides insights into the chemistry involved in these processes, although the specifics of the mechanism for methane on silica-alumina remain uncertain.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进异相催化中的C-H键活化？在这些过程中涉及哪些机制（如马尔斯范克雷伦和H-抽象）？以及如何将这些原则应用于工业中选择性氧化烷烃，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例？
文献讨论了氧化物材料中C-H键的激活，特别关注于氧化铝。氧化铝上的孤立金属中心通过如马尔斯范克雷伦和H-抽象等机制促进C-H键的活化。例如，氢可以在氧化铝表面上被裂解形成Al-H和相邻的OH组分。然而，对于二氧化硅-氧化铝的情况，情况更为模糊，任何解释都必须归类为推测。在工业应用中，如选择性氧化烷烃，这些原理被应用于将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。文献提供了关于这些过程的化学原理的见解，尽管对于二氧化硅-氧化铝中甲烷的机制仍然存在不确定性。
