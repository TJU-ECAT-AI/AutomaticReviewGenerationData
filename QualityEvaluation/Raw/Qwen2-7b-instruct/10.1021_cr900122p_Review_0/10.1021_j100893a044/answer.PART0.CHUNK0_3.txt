[1] "The isotopic mixing of CDh and CHI over alumina involved exchange with several per cent of the catalyst hydrogen. Moreover, this hydrogen resided at very definite sites on the alumina surface."
[2] "The manner in which hydrogen is activated by alu- mina and silica-alumina surfaces is not at all understood."
[3] "Studies of the exchange between the hydrogen held by isobutane and deuterated cracking catalysts have been interpreted in terms of abstraction of the tertiary hydride ion by the catalyst to form the isobutyl carbonium ion."
[4] "With silica-alumina, the situation is even less clear and anything that is written must necessarily be classified as speculation."

1. Isotopic mixing between CDh and CHI over alumina occurred through exchange with a significant percentage of the catalyst hydrogen, which was located at specific sites on the alumina surface. The hydrogen was activated by the alumina surface, possibly through cleavage of the methane molecule, leading to formation of an Al-H bond and an adjacent OH group.

2. The mechanism by which hydrogen is activated by alumina and silica-alumina surfaces remains unclear. The activation process might involve cleavage of the hydrogen molecule, leading to formation of an Al-H bond and an adjacent OH group on the surface.

3. The exchange of hydrogen held by isobutane and deuterated cracking catalysts has been explained through abstraction of the tertiary hydride ion by the catalyst, forming the isobutyl carbonium ion. The remaining nine hydrogens on the carbonium ion then exchange freely with available catalyst hydroxyl groups.

4. The situation with silica-alumina catalysts is even less clear, and any conclusions drawn about hydrogen activation must be considered speculative. The nature of active sites on silica-alumina catalysts is not fully understood, and theories about hydrogen activation differ significantly from those involving alumina.

1. 在氧化铝上，CDh 和 CHI 的同位素混合通过与催化剂氢的几个百分比进行交换发生。此外，这种氢位于氧化铝表面的非常确定的位置上。氢在氧化铝表面的激活可能涉及甲烷分子的裂解，形成一个 Al-H 键和一个相邻的 OH 群体。

2. 氧化铝和硅酸铝表面氢的激活机制尚不清楚。激活过程可能涉及氢分子的裂解，导致在表面形成一个 Al-H 键和一个相邻的 OH 群体。

3. 对于异丁烷携带的氢和脱氘化裂解催化剂之间的交换，已通过催化剂吸收三级氢离子形成异丁基碳正离子进行了解释。碳正离子上的剩余九个氢原子随后与催化剂羟基自由交换。

4. 对于硅酸铝催化剂的情况则更加模糊，任何关于氢激活的结论都必须被视作推测。对于硅酸铝催化剂活性位点的性质尚未完全理解，关于氢激活的理论与涉及氧化铝的理论存在显著差异。
