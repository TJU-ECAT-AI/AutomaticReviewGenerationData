[1] "It seems reasonable to ascribe this slower process to the diffusion of hydrogen from distant locations, to positions adjacent to the active sites."
[2] "By analogy with the present methane results, hydrogen may be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH."
[3] "With silica-alumina, the situation is even less clear and anything that is written must necessarily be classified as speculation."

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?
The literature discusses the activation of C-H bonds on oxide materials, particularly focusing on alumina. The isolated metal centers on these materials facilitate the activation of C-H bonds through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. For instance, hydrogen can be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH group. However, the situation with silica-alumina is less clear, and any explanations must be considered speculative. In the context of industrial applications, such as the selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to convert butane into maleic anhydride. The literature provides insights into the chemistry involved in these processes, although the specifics of the mechanism for methane on silica-alumina remain uncertain.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进异相催化中的C-H键活化？在这些过程中涉及哪些机制（如马尔斯范克雷伦和H-抽象）？以及如何将这些原则应用于工业中选择性氧化烷烃，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例？
文献讨论了氧化物材料中C-H键的激活，特别关注于氧化铝。氧化铝上的孤立金属中心通过如马尔斯范克雷伦和H-抽象等机制促进C-H键的活化。例如，氢可以在氧化铝表面上被裂解形成Al-H和相邻的OH组分。然而，对于二氧化硅-氧化铝的情况，情况更为模糊，任何解释都必须归类为推测。在工业应用中，如选择性氧化烷烃，这些原理被应用于将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。文献提供了关于这些过程的化学原理的见解，尽管对于二氧化硅-氧化铝中甲烷的机制仍然存在不确定性。
