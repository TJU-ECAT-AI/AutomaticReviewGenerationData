[1] "The manner in which hydrogen is activated by aluminium and silica-alumina surfaces is not at all understood."
[2] "By analogy with the present methane results, hydrogen may be cleaved on the aluminium surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH."
[3] "In both cases, the driving force seems to be the screening (restoration of coordination around) the exposed cation."

The document explains that the activation of hydrogen by aluminium surfaces involves the cleavage of hydrogen to form an Al-H bond and an adjacent OH group. This process is driven by the screening of the exposed cation, which restores coordination around the exposed aluminium ion. The mechanism for this activation process is not fully understood, especially when applied to silica-alumina surfaces.

文档解释说，氢在铝表面的活化涉及到氢的断裂以形成Al-H键和相邻的OH基团。这一过程是由暴露离子的屏蔽（恢复周围配位）驱动的，这恢复了暴露的铝离子周围的配位。对于硅酸铝表面，这一激活过程的机制尚不完全清楚。
