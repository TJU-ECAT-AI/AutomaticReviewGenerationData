[1] "It seems reasonable to ascribe this slower process to the diffusion of hydrogen from distant locations, to positions adjacent to the active sites."
[2] "With the former, there was no evidence of heterogeneity of catalyst hydrogen; the activation energy for exchange was much higher and reaction did not occur at measurable rates below 400 °F."
[3] "By analogy with the present methane results, hydrogen may be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH."
[4] "The identity of the tertiary ion is conserved either by hydride transfer from incoming molecules or by recombination with the carbonium ion on de- sorption."

1. The slower exchange process occurring in addition to the rapid exchange identified with hydroxyl groups adjacent to active sites is attributed to the diffusion of hydrogen from distant locations, to positions adjacent to the active sites.

2. On silica-alumina, there was no indication of heterogeneity of catalyst hydrogen. The activation energy for exchange was significantly higher, and the reaction did not occur at measurable rates below 400 °F.

3. Analogously to the findings with methane, hydrogen might be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H bond and an adjacent OH group.

4. The identity of the tertiary ion is preserved either through hydride transfer from incoming molecules or by recombination with the carbonium ion upon desorption.

1. 这个较慢的交换过程被归因于氢原子从远处位置扩散到活性位点附近的位点。

2. 在硅酸铝上，没有发现催化剂氢的异质性。交换激活能更高，低于400°F时无法检测到反应。

3. 类比甲烷的结果，氢可以在氧化铝表面上断裂形成Al-H键和相邻的OH基团。

4. 三甲基离子的身份通过从分子转移氢或在脱附时与碳正离子重组得以保持。
