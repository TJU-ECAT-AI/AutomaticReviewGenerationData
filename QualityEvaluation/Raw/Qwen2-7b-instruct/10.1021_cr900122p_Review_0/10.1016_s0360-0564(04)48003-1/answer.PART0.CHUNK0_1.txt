<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The isolated metal centers on oxide materials in heterogeneous catalysis enable C-H bond activation through mechanisms like the Mars-van-Krevelen process and hydrogen abstraction. These concepts are utilized in industrial selective oxidation, particularly in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.
