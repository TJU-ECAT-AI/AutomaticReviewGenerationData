[1] "The alkylation mechanism involves several steps including initiation, alkene addition and isomerization, hydride transfer, oligomerization, cracking, self-alkylation, and product and acid degradation."
[2] "In the process of liquid acid-catalyzed isobutane/alkene alkylation, sulfuric acid is commonly used due to its strong acidity and ability to effectively activate C-H bonds."
[3] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism plays a significant role in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly during the oxidation of alkanes. This mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane molecule, followed by the formation of a peroxy radical which then reacts with another alkane molecule to form a peroxy compound."
[4] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a specific example where the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is applied. In this process, butane is oxidized over a catalyst, typically iron, to produce maleic anhydride, which is a key intermediate in the synthesis of various polymers."

Industrial selective oxidation of alkanes often utilizes the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, which involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane molecule, followed by the formation of a peroxy radical reacting with another alkane molecule to form a peroxy compound. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride demonstrates this application, where butane is oxidized over a catalyst, typically iron, to produce maleic anhydride, a crucial intermediate in polymer synthesis.

工业选择性氧化烷烃通常采用Mars-van Krevelen机制，该机制涉及从烷烃分子中抽象氢原子，随后形成的过氧基自由基与另一个烷烃分子反应形成过氧化合物。例如，将丁烷转化为马来酸酐就体现了这一应用，在此过程中，丁烷在铁等催化剂的作用下被氧化，生成马来酸酐，这是聚合物合成中的关键中间体。
