[1] "The alkylation mechanism involves several steps including initiation, alkene addition, isomerization, hydride transfer, oligomerization, cracking, self-alkylation, and product and acid degradation."
[2] "In the initiation step, the liquid acid catalyst facilitates the breaking of the C-H bond in the alkane."
[3] "During the alkene addition step, the alkene adds across the C-H bond of the alkane, forming a new alkylated compound."

[5] "Oligomerization and cracking are pathways that lead to the formation of higher molecular weight compounds and smaller molecules, respectively."
[6] "Self-alkylation refers to the reaction of the alkylated compound with itself, leading to further branching and longer chain lengths."

[9] "The Mars van Krevelen process is characterized by the sequential abstraction of hydrogen atoms and oxygenation of carbon atoms."
[10] "H-abstraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the alkane, followed by its recombination with an oxygen atom, leading to the formation of an alcohol."
[11] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is an example of selective oxidation, demonstrating the potential of these processes in industrial applications."

Industrial selective oxidation of alkanes utilizes isolated metal centers on oxide materials to activate C-H bonds through mechanisms like the Mars van Krevelen process and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen process, hydrogen atoms are sequentially abstracted from the alkane, followed by oxygenation of carbon atoms, leading to the formation of alcohols or other oxygenated products. H-abstraction involves removing a hydrogen atom from the alkane, which then combines with an oxygen atom to form an alcohol. These processes were demonstrated in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, showcasing their application in industrial settings for the production of valuable chemical intermediates.

工业选择性氧化烷烃利用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心激活C-H键，通过Mars van Krevelen过程和H-抽象机制。在Mars van Krevelen过程中，氢原子从烷烃中逐个被移除，并通过碳原子的氧化形成醇或其他氧基化合物。H-抽象涉及从烷烃中移除一个氢原子，然后与氧原子结合形成醇。这些过程在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的例子中得到了展示，展示了它们在工业领域生产有价值的化学中间体的应用潜力。
