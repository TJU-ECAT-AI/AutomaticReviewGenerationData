[1] "The alkylation mechanism involves several steps including initiation, alkene addition, isomerization, hydride transfer, oligomerization, cracking, self-alkylation, and product and acid degradation."
[2] "In the initiation step, the liquid acid catalyst facilitates the breaking of the C-H bond in the alkane."
[3] "During the alkene addition step, the alkene adds across the C-H bond of the alkane, forming a new alkylated compound."
[4] "Hydride transfer is a crucial step where hydrogen atoms are transferred from one molecule to another, influencing the formation of various products."
[5] "Oligomerization and cracking are pathways that lead to the formation of higher molecular weight compounds and smaller molecules, respectively."
[6] "Self-alkylation refers to the reaction of the alkylated compound with itself, leading to further branching and longer chain lengths."
[7] "Product and acid degradation contribute to the purity of the final product and the efficiency of the catalyst."
[8] "Selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials involves mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen process and H-abstraction."
[9] "The Mars van Krevelen process is characterized by the sequential abstraction of hydrogen atoms and oxygenation of carbon atoms."
[10] "H-abstraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the alkane, followed by its recombination with an oxygen atom, leading to the formation of an alcohol."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Industrial selective oxidation of alkanes utilizes isolated metal centers on oxide materials to activate C-H bonds through mechanisms like the Mars van Krevelen process and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen process, hydrogen atoms are sequentially abstracted from the alkane, followed by oxygenation of carbon atoms, leading to the formation of alcohols or other oxygenated products. H-abstraction involves removing a hydrogen atom from the alkane, which then combines with an oxygen atom to form an alcohol. These processes were demonstrated in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, showcasing their application in industrial settings for the production of valuable chemical intermediates.
