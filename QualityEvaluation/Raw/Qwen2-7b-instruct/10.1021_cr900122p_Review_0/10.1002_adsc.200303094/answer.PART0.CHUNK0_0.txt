[1] "In the case of the reaction of m-substituted acetophenones, the corresponding 6- alkylated products are obtained as the major product (Figure 1). Interestingly, however, the reactions of m- fluoro- and m-methoxyacetophenones with triethoxy-vinylsilane take place at the more congested ortho position, i.e., 2-position (Figure 2; 1 and 2, respectively)."

[2] "Interestingly, however, in the case of CH/SiR3 coupling, -conjugation is not essential."

[3] "Very recently, Ishiyama reported that the presence of 4,4-di-tert-butyl-2,2-pipyridine (dtbpy) dramatically improves the activity of the iridium catalyst for aromatic CH/Bpin2 coupling."

1. The reaction of m-substituted acetophenones typically gives the corresponding 6-alkylated products as the major product. However, when m-fluoro- and m-methoxyacetophenones react with triethoxy-vinylsilane, the products are formed at the more crowded ortho position, specifically at the 2-position.

2. In the case of CH/SiR3 coupling, the conjugation of the directing group with the benzene ring is not a requirement for the reaction to occur.

3. The use of 4,4-di-tert-butyl-2,2-pipyridine (dtbpy) significantly enhances the activity of the iridium catalyst in the aromatic CH/Bpin2 coupling reaction.

1. 对于m取代的苯甲酮，通常得到对应的6烷基化产物为主要产物。然而，当m-氟化和m-甲氧基苯甲酮与三乙氧基乙烯硅烷反应时，产物在更拥挤的对位形成，具体为2位。

2. 在CH/SiR3耦合中，定向基团与苯环的共轭不是反应发生的要求。

3. 使用4,4-二叔丁基-2,2-吡啶（dtbpy）显著提高了铱催化剂在芳香族CH/Bpin2耦合反应中的活性。
