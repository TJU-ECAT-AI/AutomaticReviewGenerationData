[1] "In the case of the reaction of m-substituted acetophenones, the corresponding 6- alkylated products are obtained as the major product (Figure 1). Interestingly, however, the reactions of m- fluoro- and m-methoxyacetophenones with triethoxy-vinylsilane take place at the more congested ortho position, i.e., 2-position (Figure 2; 1 and 2, respectively)."

[2] "Interestingly, however, in the case of CH/SiR3 coupling, -conjugation is not essential."

[3] "Very recently, Ishiyama reported that the presence of 4,4-di-tert-butyl-2,2-pipyridine (dtbpy) dramatically improves the activity of the iridium catalyst for aromatic CH/Bpin2 coupling."

1. The reaction of m-substituted acetophenones typically gives the corresponding 6-alkylated products as the major product. However, when m-fluoro- and m-methoxyacetophenones react with triethoxy-vinylsilane, the products are formed at the more crowded ortho position, specifically at the 2-position.

2. In the case of CH/SiR3 coupling, the conjugation of the directing group with the benzene ring is not a requirement for the reaction to occur.

3. The use of 4,4-di-tert-butyl-2,2-pipyridine (dtbpy) significantly enhances the activity of the iridium catalyst in the aromatic CH/Bpin2 coupling reaction.

When benzene reacts with diphenylacetylene, triphenylethene is produced with a 45% yield based on the acetylene used. The use of carbon monoxide is crucial for achieving this catalytic coupling. When RhCl(PPh3)3 acts as the catalyst, the coupling reaction yields 1-(arylamino)indole with good yields. Based on these findings, it was suggested that the step involving the cleavage of the C-H bond is the rate-limiting step.
