The reaction of m-substituted acetophenones generally leads to the formation of 6-alkylated products as the major product. However, when m-fluoro- and m-methoxyacetophenones react with triethoxyvinylsilane, the reactions occur at the more crowded ortho position, specifically at the 2-position. These results indicate that heteroatoms might influence the regioselectivity of the reaction. Morokuma and Koga conducted ab initio theoretical calculations to analyze the mechanism of CH bond cleavage by the ruthenium complex. They used benzaldehyde and ethylene as models to represent the aromatic ketone and olefin, respectively. Their calculations suggested that the latter mechanism (path b) is plausible for the CH bond cleavage. Murai's experimental findings align well with Morokuma's theoretical predictions.

m-取代的乙酸苯酯通常导致形成6-烷基化产物为主要产物。然而，当m-氟代和m-甲氧基乙酸苯酯与三乙氧基乙烯硅烷反应时，反应发生在更为拥挤的对位位置，即2位置。这些结果表明，杂原子可能在确定反应的区域选择性方面起辅助作用。莫罗卡和高加进行了基于第一原理的理论计算，以分析钌络合物中的CH键断裂机制。他们使用苯甲醛和乙烯作为代表芳基酮和烯烃的模型。他们的计算表明，后一种机制（路径b）可能是CH键断裂的合理方式。Murai的实验结果与莫罗卡的理论预测一致。
