[1] "The first example of the catalytic dehydrogenation of an alkane under thermal conditions was reported by Baudry using a homogeneous rhenium catalyst."
[2] "The rhenium polyhydride complex is effective for the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes with the aid of tert-butylethylene as a hydrogen acceptor."
[3] "Under 1000 psi of H2 at 100C for 15 min, a cyclooctane solution of RhCl(CO)(PMe3)2 (0.20 mM) and norbornene (1.2 M) yields 950 turnovers of cyclooctene (0.19 M) and norbornane (1.2 M)."
[4] "The key to their success with respect to the high efficiency observed, appears to be the long-term stability of the Ir- PCP complexes at very high temperatures."

1. The first instance of thermal catalytic dehydrogenation of an alkane was reported by Baudry utilizing a homogeneous rhenium catalyst. 
2. Rhenium polyhydride complexes are capable of dehydrogenating cycloalkanes in the presence of tert-butylethylene as a hydrogen acceptor. 
3. Baudry's process involved reacting cyclooctane with 1.2 M tert-butylethylene under 1000 psi of hydrogen at 100°C for 15 minutes, resulting in 950 turnovers of cyclooctene and norbornane.  
4. The reason for the high efficiency observed in this reaction is attributed to the long-term stability of the Ir- PCP complexes at high temperatures.  
5. For the dehydrogenative silylation of arenes to occur catalytically, the use of olefin as a hydrogen scavenger is essential.  
6. The reactivity of arenes in dehydrogenative silylation decreases in the order: anisole > chlorobenzene > benzene > toluene.  
7. In the reaction of pentane with B2pin2 using Cp*Re(CO)3 as catalyst, the boron atom primarily attaches to the methyl CH bond.  
8. The first catalytic borylation reaction was reported in 1999.  
9. Using Cp*Rh(4-C6Me6) as catalyst, the reaction of pentane with B2pin2 at 150°C resulted in the exclusive formation of n-octylborane with perfect regioselectivity and high yield.
