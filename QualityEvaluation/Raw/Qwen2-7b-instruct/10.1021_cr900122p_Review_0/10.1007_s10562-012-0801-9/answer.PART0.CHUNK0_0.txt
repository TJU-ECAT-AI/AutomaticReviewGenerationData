[1] "The demands of new industrial processes are ever increasing; witness, for instance, the desire to selectively synthesize enantiopure chiral compounds for pharmaceutical and agricultural applications and for uses in the food industry."
[2] "A more extensive knowledge is require of the molecular details of catalysis, and better synthetic methods are also needed to prepare the catalyst that can satisfy the conditions identified by such basic studies."
[3] "Increasingly, the old catalyst preparation protocols have proven inadequate for the needs of new catalytic processes."
[4] "We believe that it is this synergy between the fields of modern surface science, computational chemistry, and materials synthesis that will usher the field of heterogeneous catalysis into a new modality where catalysts will be designed at a molecular level to selectively promote specific reactions in complex systems."
