[1] "In the case of gold cited above, for instance, a clear correlation has been reported between the size of gold particles dispersed on a titania support and both the magnitude of the electronic band gap of the metal and its catalytic activity for CO oxidation [22]."
[2] "An atypically weak CO adsorption state was identified on very small Pd particles, on the order of a couple of nanometers in diameter (Fig. 1), attributable to a strong interaction with the support; those particles also displayed facile oxidation and reduction."
[3] "It was concluded that the observed trends are related to a quantum-size effect with respect to the thickness of the islands that gold forms on the support."
[4] "Much of the surface-science work in this area to date has focused on simple oxidation reactions, but the potential is there to extend the research to other more complex catalytic systems [25, 26]."
[5] "Figure 2, for instance, shows how the selectivity for the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of pyrrole on platinum catalysts shifts from close to 100 % conversion to n-butylamine with large nanoparticles to the production of significant quantities of pyrrolidine if nanoparticles on the order of 1 nm in diameter are used instead."
[6] "In that case it was demonstrated that, while the yolk@shell structure prevents the gold particles from sintering upon annealing to high temperatures, as it happens with regular Au/TiO2 dispersed catalysts, it does not affect their catalytic activity toward carbon monoxide oxidation."

1. The size of gold particles on a titania support correlates with the metal's electronic band gap and catalytic activity for CO oxidation. This correlation is explained by a quantum-size effect affecting the thickness of gold islands on the support.

2. Very small palladium particles display a weak CO adsorption state due to strong interaction with the support, which facilitates oxidation and reduction. 

3. The weak CO adsorption state on small palladium particles is attributed to a quantum-size effect influencing the thickness of the particles.

4. Research has primarily focused on simple oxidation reactions, but there's potential to extend studies to more complex catalytic systems.

5. Using platinum catalysts, the selectivity for the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of pyrrole shifts from near complete conversion to n-butylamine with larger nanoparticles to significant production of pyrrolidine with nanoparticles around 1 nm in diameter.

6. The yolk@shell structure of gold nanoparticles prevents sintering upon high temperature annealing, unlike regular Au/TiO2 dispersed catalysts, without affecting their catalytic activity towards CO oxidation.

1. 当金颗粒分散在钛酸盐支持物上时，它们的尺寸与金属的电子带隙和CO氧化的催化活性之间存在明显的相关性。这种相关性由影响金岛上层厚度的量子尺寸效应解释。

2. 非常小的钯颗粒显示出弱的CO吸附状态，这是由于与支撑物的强烈相互作用，这促进了氧化和还原。

3. 小钯颗粒上的弱CO吸附状态归因于影响颗粒厚度的量子尺寸效应。

4. 研究主要集中在简单的氧化反应上，但有潜力将研究扩展到更复杂的催化系统。

5. 使用铂催化剂时，吡咯的氢化和氢解选择性从使用较大纳米颗粒时接近完全转化至n-丁胺，转变为使用直径约1 nm的纳米颗粒时显著产生吡咯烷。

6. 包壳结构的金纳米颗粒防止在高温退火时发生聚集，与常规Au/TiO2分散催化剂不同，同时不影响其向CO氧化的催化活性。
