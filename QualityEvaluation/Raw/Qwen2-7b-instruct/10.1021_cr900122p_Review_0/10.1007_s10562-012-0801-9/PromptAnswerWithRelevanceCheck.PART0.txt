[1] "In the case of gold cited above, for instance, a clear correlation has been reported between the size of gold particles dispersed on a titania support and both the magnitude of the electronic band gap of the metal and its catalytic activity for CO oxidation [22]."
[2] "An atypically weak CO adsorption state was identified on very small Pd particles, on the order of a couple of nanometers in diameter (Fig. 1), attributable to a strong interaction with the support; those particles also displayed facile oxidation and reduction."
[3] "It was concluded that the observed trends are related to a quantum-size effect with respect to the thickness of the islands that gold forms on the support."
[4] "Much of the surface-science work in this area to date has focused on simple oxidation reactions, but the potential is there to extend the research to other more complex catalytic systems [25, 26]."
[5] "Figure 2, for instance, shows how the selectivity for the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of pyrrole on platinum catalysts shifts from close to 100 % conversion to n-butylamine with large nanoparticles to the production of significant quantities of pyrrolidine if nanoparticles on the order of 1 nm in diameter are used instead."
[6] "In that case it was demonstrated that, while the yolk@shell structure prevents the gold particles from sintering upon annealing to high temperatures, as it happens with regular Au/TiO2 dispersed catalysts, it does not affect their catalytic activity toward carbon monoxide oxidation."

1. The size of gold particles on a titania support correlates with the metal's electronic band gap and catalytic activity for CO oxidation. This correlation is explained by a quantum-size effect affecting the thickness of gold islands on the support.

2. Very small palladium particles display a weak CO adsorption state due to strong interaction with the support, which facilitates oxidation and reduction. 

3. The weak CO adsorption state on small palladium particles is attributed to a quantum-size effect influencing the thickness of the particles.

4. Research has primarily focused on simple oxidation reactions, but there's potential to extend studies to more complex catalytic systems.

5. Using platinum catalysts, the selectivity for the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of pyrrole shifts from near complete conversion to n-butylamine with larger nanoparticles to significant production of pyrrolidine with nanoparticles around 1 nm in diameter.

6. The yolk@shell structure of gold nanoparticles prevents sintering upon high temperature annealing, unlike regular Au/TiO2 dispersed catalysts, without affecting their catalytic activity towards CO oxidation.

2. In surface science studies using model system, structure sensitivity has traditionally been probed by comparing chemical reactivity on single crystals exposing surfaces with different orientations [5, 8]. Initial studies on chemisorption were later extended to catalytic rate measurements using so-called high pressure cells [42-44]. Those studies have been quite useful, but also revealed some intrinsic limitations, in particular the fact that they cannot always reproduce the behavior of small nanoparticles or mimic the effect of the support.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon molecule by a reactive species, typically a metal center. This process can lead to the formation of an intermediate that can undergo further reactions, such as the cleavage of C-H bonds. H-abstraction is another mechanism where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from a hydrocarbon molecule by a reactive species, leading to the formation of a radical and a carbocation. These mechanisms are involved in the selective oxidation of alkanes, where the metal center acts as an electron-withdrawing group, stabilizing the transition state and facilitating the breaking of C-H bonds. 

As an example, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride involves the activation of C-H bonds by a metal center on an oxide material. The metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from butane, forming a peroxy peroxy radical and a carbocation. The carbocation then undergoes a series of reactions, including proton transfer and rearrangements, leading to the formation of maleic anhydride.

孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上可以促进C-H键活化，通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H抽象等机制。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及从烃分子中由活性物种抽象氢原子的过程，通常是一个金属中心。这个过程可能导致中间体的形成，该中间体可以进一步反应，如C-H键的断裂。H抽象是另一个机制，其中氢原子被活性物种抽象从烃分子，导致形成一个自由基和一个碳正离子。这些机制涉及到烷烃的选择性氧化，其中金属中心作为电子吸引剂，稳定过渡态并促进C-H键的断裂。

以将丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例，该过程涉及氧化物材料上的金属中心对C-H键的激活。金属中心从丁烷中抽象氢原子，形成过氧过氧自由基和碳正离子。碳正离子然后经历一系列反应，包括质子转移和重排，导致形成马来酸酐。
