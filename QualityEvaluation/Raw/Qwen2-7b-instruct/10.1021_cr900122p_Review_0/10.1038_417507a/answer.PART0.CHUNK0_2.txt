[1] "The controlled activation of small, relatively inert molecules has been a ubiquitous theme in transition metal chemistry since its renaissance began in the late 1950s."
[2] "Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water."
[3] "Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization."
[4] "Indeed, in most pre-1980s examples of CH bonds reacting at transition-metal centres, reactions proceed successfully only if they are assisted through participation of the p orbitals of aromatic CH bonds or involve intramolecular reactions."
[5] "These observations suggested that alkane activation should be possible. In fact, chemists realized that previous failures to achieve it might not have been due to unreactivity at all: CH activation might take place, but yield an organometallic product that is thermodynamically unstable and thus undetectable."
[6] "Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982 (refs 15, 16) (one reaction is shown in equation (4)), and a large number of other examples quickly followed."

1. The selective transformation of ubiquitous but inert C-H bonds to other functional groups has significant practical implications, including more efficient strategies for fine chemical synthesis and the replacement of current petrochemical feedstocks by less expensive and more readily available alkanes.
2. Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, are major constituents of natural gas and petroleum, but there are very few practical processes for converting them directly to more valuable products due to their inert nature, which arises from the strong and localized CC and CH bonds.
3. While cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins, these processes require high temperatures and are energy-intensive.
4. Alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, but these species are usually demanding and expensive to make, offering little control over product selectivity.
5. Although enzymes efficiently and selectively catalyse alkane oxidation at physiological temperatures and pressures, large-scale bioprocesses for converting alkane resources seem to be problematic due to practical limitations.
6. The difficulty in achieving selective transformations under forcing conditions leads to most important petrochemicals being produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons, specifically olefins, which are obtained from alkanes through inefficient processes.
7. The development of efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could significantly improve methane utilization.
8. In most pre-1980s examples of C-H bonds reacting at transition-metal centers, reactions proceeded successfully only if they were assisted through participation of the p orbitals of aromatic C-H bonds or involved intramolecular reactions.
9. Chemists realized that previous failures to achieve alkane activation might not have been due to unreactivity, as CH activation could take place but yield an organometallic product that is thermodynamically unstable and thus undetectable.
10. Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982, and a large number of other examples quickly followed.

1. 对于普遍但惰性的C-H键进行选择性转化到其他功能基团具有深远的实际意义，包括更高效的精细化学品合成策略以及用成本更低、更容易获得的烷烃取代当前的石油化学品。
2. 烷烃，或饱和烃，是天然气和石油的主要成分，但几乎没有直接将它们转化为更有价值产品的实用过程，因为它们的惰性源自强且局部化的CC和CH键。
3. 裂解和热脱氢化将烷烃转化为有价值的烯烃，但这些过程需要高温且能耗高。
4. 烷烃可以通过暴露于超酸或自由基等高度活性物种来诱导反应，但这些物种通常难以制备，且对产品选择性控制有限。
5. 尽管酶在生理温度和压力下高效且选择性地催化烷烃氧化，但在工业规模上利用烷烃资源似乎存在实践限制，尤其是大规模生物过程。
6. 难以在强制条件下实现选择性转化导致大多数重要的石油化工产品从不饱和烃中生产出来，而后者是从烷烃通过效率较低的过程获取的。
7. 将甲烷直接转化为甲醇或其他液体燃料或化学品的高效策略的发展能够显著提高甲烷的利用。
8. 在大多数1980年代以前的例子中，C-H键在过渡金属中心反应时，只有在参与芳香C-H键的p轨道或涉及分子内反应的情况下才能成功。
9. 化学家意识到，之前的烷基化失败可能并非由于无反应性，而是CH激活可能发生，但产生的过渡金属产物是热力学不稳定且不可检测的。
10. 使用旨在产生稳定产物的系统，两个小组在1982年展示了分子间烷基化，并迅速出现了许多其他例子。
