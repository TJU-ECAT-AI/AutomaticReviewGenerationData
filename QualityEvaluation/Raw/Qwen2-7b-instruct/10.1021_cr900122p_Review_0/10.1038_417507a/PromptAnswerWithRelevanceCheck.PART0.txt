[1] "The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert."
[2] "Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water."
[3] "Although profitable practical applications have not yet been developed, our understanding of how these organometallic reactions occur, and what their inherent advantages and limitations for practical alkane conversion are, has progressed considerably."
[4] "Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization."
[5] "Binding to metal centres has resulted in altered and/or enhanced reactivity in a variety of molecules, through associated changes in the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity."

1. Alkanes are considered relatively inert because they have strong and localized CC and CH bonds, lacking empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction.
2. Alkanes react at high temperatures in combustion, but these reactions are not easily controllable and typically result in thermodynamically stable and economically unappealing products, such as carbon dioxide and water.
3. The understanding of organometallic reactions and their inherent advantages and limitations for practical alkane conversion has advanced significantly.
4. Efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could greatly enhance methane utilization.
5. Binding to metal centers leads to altered and/or increased reactivity in various molecules, often through changes in the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity.

<p>Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, are major constitu- ents of natural gas and petroleum, but there are very few practical processes for converting them directly to more valuable products. The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert. This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes.</p>
<p>Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in com- bustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically un- attractive products, carbon dioxide and water. The currently preva- lent use of alkanes in combustion applications exploits their energy content, but not their considerable potential as valuable precursors for more important and expensive chemicals. Although cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins,these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity.</p>
<p>A variety of enzymes efficiently and selectively catalyse alkane oxidation at physiological temperatures and pressures, and the direct use of biological organisms for industrial alkane conversion under such benign conditions is possible in principle. But in practice, these approaches may be primarily applicable to the small-scale production of specialized chemicals, given that large- scale bioprocesses for converting alkane resources seem to be problematic1. However, despite their practical limitations, enzy- matic alkane transformations are much studied, to understand the underlying reaction mechanisms and guide the design of synthetic catalysts mimicking the function, efficiency and selectivity of their biological counterparts. Enzymatic and enzyme-mimetic alkane transformations are beyond the scope of the present review, but further information and bibliographies can be found in recent reviews2,3.</p>

1. Alkanes, due to their inert nature, are not easily converted into more valuable products under practical conditions. Their chemical inertness is mainly because their molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in chemical reactions. High temperature reactions, such as combustion, are not controllable and usually result in carbon dioxide and water, which are not economically attractive. Alkanes are primarily used for their energy content rather than as valuable precursors for more important chemicals.

2. Cracking and thermal dehydrogenation are methods that convert alkanes to valuable olefins, but these processes require high temperatures and are energy-intensive. 

3. Exposure to highly reactive species like superacids or free radicals can induce alkane reactions, but these reactive species are often expensive and difficult to make, providing limited control over product selectivity.

4. Enzymatic alkane oxidation occurs efficiently at physiological temperatures and pressures, but the practical application of these processes is primarily limited to small-scale production of specialized chemicals. Large-scale bioprocesses for converting alkane resources face challenges. Despite their limitations, enzymatic alkane transformations are extensively studied to understand reaction mechanisms and guide the design of synthetic catalysts that mimic their efficiency and selectivity. Further details and bibliographies can be found in recent reviews.

5. Alkane chemistry could potentially improve the utilization of methane, the principal component of natural gas. Direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could significantly enhance methane utilization, but the current methods for converting hydrocarbon gas into more readily transportable liquids are indirect, involving the production of synthesis gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), followed by conversion to the desired product.

1. 由于烷烃的惰性，它们在实际条件下很难转化为更有价值的产物。它们的化学惰性主要是因为它们的分子没有低能级的空轨道或高能级的充满轨道，这些轨道可以很容易地参与化学反应。高温反应，如燃烧，不易控制，通常会导致二氧化碳和水，这在经济上并不吸引人。烷烃主要用于其能量含量，而不是作为更重要的化学品的有价值前体。

2. 裂解和热脱氢化是将烷烃转化为有价值烯烃的方法，但这些过程需要高温且能耗大。

3. 高活性物种（如超酸）或自由基的暴露可以诱导烷烃反应，但这些活性物种往往昂贵且难以制造，提供有限的产品选择性。

4. 在生理温度和压力下，酶促烷烃氧化发生高效，但在实践中，这些方法的主要应用限于小规模生产专门化学品。大规模生物过程用于转化烷烃资源似乎存在问题。尽管存在实践限制，但酶促烷烃转化受到广泛研究，以了解反应机制并指导设计模仿其功能、效率和选择性的合成催化剂。关于此主题的更多信息和参考文献可以在最近的评论中找到。

5. 烷烃化学有可能提高天然气主要成分甲烷的利用。直接将甲烷转化为甲醇或其他液体燃料或化学品可以显著增强甲烷的利用。但目前将烃类气体转化为更易于运输的液体的方法是间接的，涉及产生合成气（一氧化碳和氢气），随后转化为所需产品。

The selective transformation of ubiquitous but inert C-H bonds to other functional groups has significant practical implications, including more efficient strategies for fine chemical synthesis and the replacement of current petrochemical feedstocks by less expensive and more readily available alkanes.

Alkanes are relatively inert because their molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction. This chemical inertness arises from the strong and localized CC and CH bonds holding the atoms together. Alkanes react at high temperatures, typically in combustion processes, which are not easily controllable and usually lead to the formation of carbon dioxide and water. Direct conversion of methane into more valuable products, such as methanol, could significantly enhance methane utilization. The inertness of alkanes' CH bonds is a challenge for selective transformations under normal conditions. However, binding to metal centers can alter the reactivity of various molecules by changing the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity. Despite this, activating the CH bonds of alkanes requires overcoming the unique properties of these molecules.

烷烃的惰性源于其分子中没有参与化学反应的低能轨道或高能轨道。这种化学惰性源自于碳-碳和碳-氢键的强局部化作用。烷烃在高温下反应，通常是在燃烧过程中，这些反应不易控制，通常导致二氧化碳和水的生成。直接将甲烷转化为更有价值的产品，如甲醇，可以显著提高甲烷的利用效率。烷烃的C-H键的惰性是正常条件下选择性转化的挑战。然而，将分子绑定到金属中心可以通过改变轨道的相对能量或极性来改变各种分子的反应性。尽管如此，激活烷烃的C-H键需要克服这些分子的独特性质。
