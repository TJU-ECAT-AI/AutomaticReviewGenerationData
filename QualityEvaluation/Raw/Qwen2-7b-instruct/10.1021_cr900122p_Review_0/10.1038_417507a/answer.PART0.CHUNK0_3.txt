[1] "The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert."
[2] "This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes."
[3] "Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water."
[4] "The currently prevalent use of alkanes in combustion applications exploits their energy content, but not their considerable potential as valuable precursors for more important and expensive chemicals."
[5] "Although cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins, these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive."
[6] "Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity."

Alkanes are considered inert due to their strong and localized CC and CH bonds, which prevent them from participating in chemical reactions easily. Their energy content is mainly exploited through combustion, rather than their potential as valuable precursors for producing more important and expensive chemicals. Processes like cracking and thermal dehydrogenation, which convert alkanes to olefins, require high temperatures and are energy-intensive. Exposure to highly reactive species like superacids or free radicals can induce reactions, but these species are costly to produce and offer limited control over product selectivity.

烷烃被认为是因为它们的强且局部化的CC和CH键而难以参与化学反应。它们的能量含量主要通过燃烧来利用，而不是作为生产更重要和昂贵化学品的重要前体。如裂解和热脱氢化等过程将烷烃转化为烯烃，需要高温并耗能高。通过高度活性物种如超酸或自由基的暴露可以诱导反应，但这些物种的生产成本高，并且在产品选择性上有限制。
