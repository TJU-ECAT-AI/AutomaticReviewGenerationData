[1] "The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert."
[2] "Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water."
[3] "Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization."
[4] "Binding to metal centres has resulted in altered and/or enhanced reactivity in a variety of molecules, through associated changes in the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity."
[5] "In principle, it should be possible to similarly activate the inert CH bonds of alkanes, but the examples just mentioned all involve small molecules with lone electron pairs and/or p orbitals that can interact with empty orbitals of the metal centres; alkanes possess neither of these."

Alkanes are relatively inert because their molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction. This chemical inertness arises from the strong and localized CC and CH bonds holding the atoms together. Alkanes react at high temperatures, typically in combustion processes, which are not easily controllable and usually lead to the formation of carbon dioxide and water. Direct conversion of methane into more valuable products, such as methanol, could significantly enhance methane utilization. The inertness of alkanes' CH bonds is a challenge for selective transformations under normal conditions. However, binding to metal centers can alter the reactivity of various molecules by changing the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity. Despite this, activating the CH bonds of alkanes requires overcoming the unique properties of these molecules.

烷烃的惰性源于其分子中没有参与化学反应的低能轨道或高能轨道。这种化学惰性源自于碳-碳和碳-氢键的强局部化作用。烷烃在高温下反应，通常是在燃烧过程中，这些反应不易控制，通常导致二氧化碳和水的生成。直接将甲烷转化为更有价值的产品，如甲醇，可以显著提高甲烷的利用效率。烷烃的C-H键的惰性是正常条件下选择性转化的挑战。然而，将分子绑定到金属中心可以通过改变轨道的相对能量或极性来改变各种分子的反应性。尽管如此，激活烷烃的C-H键需要克服这些分子的独特性质。
