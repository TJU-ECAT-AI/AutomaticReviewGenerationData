[1] "The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert."
[2] "Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water."
[3] "Although profitable practical applications have not yet been developed, our understanding of how these organometallic reactions occur, and what their inherent advantages and limitations for practical alkane conversion are, has progressed considerably."
[4] "Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization."
[5] "Binding to metal centres has resulted in altered and/or enhanced reactivity in a variety of molecules, through associated changes in the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity."

1. Alkanes are considered relatively inert because they have strong and localized CC and CH bonds, lacking empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction.
2. Alkanes react at high temperatures in combustion, but these reactions are not easily controllable and typically result in thermodynamically stable and economically unappealing products, such as carbon dioxide and water.
3. The understanding of organometallic reactions and their inherent advantages and limitations for practical alkane conversion has advanced significantly.
4. Efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could greatly enhance methane utilization.
5. Binding to metal centers leads to altered and/or increased reactivity in various molecules, often through changes in the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity.

1. 烷烃被认为是相对惰性的，因为它们具有强而局部化的CC和CH键，缺乏参与化学反应的低能级空轨道或高能级满轨道。
2. 烷烃在燃烧时会反应，但这些反应不易控制，通常会形成热力学上稳定且经济上不吸引人的产物，如二氧化碳和水。
3. 对于烷烃转换的有机金属反应及其内在优势和限制的理解已显著进步。
4. 高效策略直接将甲烷转化为甲醇或其他液体燃料或化学品可以大大提高甲烷的利用效率。
5. 绑定到金属中心导致各种分子的反应性改变和/或增强，通常通过轨道能量的相对变化或它们的极性变化来实现。
