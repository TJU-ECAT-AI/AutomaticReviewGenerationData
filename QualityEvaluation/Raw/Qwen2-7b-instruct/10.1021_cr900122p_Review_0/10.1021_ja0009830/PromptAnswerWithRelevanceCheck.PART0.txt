[1] "The mechanism involves a series of steps that includes the formation of an active species, which then undergoes a reaction with the alkene substrate."
[2] "Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism plays a critical role in the process of C-H bond activation."
[3] "In the context of heterogeneous catalysis, isolated metal centers on oxide materials serve as the active sites for the activation of C-H bonds."
[4] "This principle has been applied in various industries, including the selective oxidation of alkanes."
[5] "A specific example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the catalyst facilitates the desired reaction pathway."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The isolated metal centers on oxide materials in heterogeneous catalysis facilitate C-H bond activation through a series of steps that form an active species which reacts with the alkene substrate. The Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism is crucial in this process. In industries such as selective oxidation of alkanes, these isolated metal centers act as active sites for C-H bond activation. A practical application of this principle is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the catalyst directs the reaction towards the desired product.
