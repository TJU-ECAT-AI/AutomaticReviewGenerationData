The isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation through heterogeneous catalysis. This process involves mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These catalytic principles are then applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, showcasing their practical utility. A specific example of this application is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.
