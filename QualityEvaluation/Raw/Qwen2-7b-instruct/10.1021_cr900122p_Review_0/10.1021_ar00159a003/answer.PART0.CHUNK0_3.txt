[1] "Evidence with Re(PPh3)2H7,35 CpRe(PMe3)3,25Cid and Fe- all indicates that a direct oxidative addition pathway exists in addition to a-coordination."
[2] "Furthermore, reductive elimination of the vinyl hydride can also lead directly to the a-olefin complex."
[3] "It is also interesting to note that the microscopic reverse of this sequence implies that olefin dissociation from the metal also can occur by two pathways, one of which involves intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination of free olefin!"
[4] "The factors controlling intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remains poorly understood in a general sense."
[5] "It may be that relief of steric compression is the driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, a force that is not so important in the [ (C5Me5)M(PMe3)] intermediates."
[6] "The more crowded [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate appears to sit in the middle, with both phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation in balance."

The document discusses several mechanisms related to the activation of C-H bonds in metal complexes. One mechanism involves a direct oxidative addition pathway, where the olefin coordinates to the metal center. Another pathway involves a vinylic oxidative addition followed by reductive elimination to form the a-olefin complex. The document also notes that the microscopic reverse of this sequence suggests that olefin dissociation from the metal center can occur via two pathways, including intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination of the free olefin. However, the factors controlling intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remain poorly understood. The document suggests that relief of steric compression might be the driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, which is less important in other intermediates like [ (C5Me5)M(PMe3)]. The crowded [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate appears to balance both phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation.

文档讨论了与金属复合物中C-H键活化相关的几种机制。一种机制涉及直接氧化添加途径，其中烯烃与金属中心配位。另一种途径涉及vinylic氧化添加随后是还原消除形成a-烯烃复合物。文档还指出，微观逆序表明从金属中心分离烯烃可以以两种途径进行，包括通过重新激活分子内vinylic后自由烯烃的还原消除。然而，控制分子内激活的C-H键的配体的因素在一般意义上仍然不清楚。文档提出，可能释放立体压缩是促进PMe3配体金属化的驱动力，在其他中间体[(C5Me5)M(PMe3)]中这一作用不太重要。拥挤的[(C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2]中间体似乎处于平衡状态，同时平衡磷氢金属化和分子间碳氢化合物激活。
