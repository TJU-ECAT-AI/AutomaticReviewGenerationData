1. "There must be two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a coordinately unsaturated metal: (1) direct a-complexation and (2) vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination."
2. "It is still not clear why species such as [Fe(PMe3),]37 and [ (C5Me5)Re- (PMe3)2]23C undergo cyclometalation whereas [ (C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)] and [ (C5Me5)Ir(PMe3)] do not."
3. "It may be that relief of steric compression is the driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, a force that is not so important in the [ (C5Me5)M(PMe3)] intermediates."
4. "The more crowded [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate appears to sit in the middle, with both phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation in balance."

1. There are two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from a free olefin and a coordinately unsaturated metal. The first is direct a-complexation, while the second involves vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination.
2. The reasons why certain species undergo cyclometalation while others do not are not fully understood, particularly regarding the involvement of specific metal-phosphine complexes.
3. Relief of steric compression might be the driving force behind metalation of the PMe3 ligand, explaining the selectivity in certain metal complexes.
4. In the case of the more crowded [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate, phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation are balanced.

1. 形成烯烃复合物有两条独立路径：（1）直接的a配位和（2）通过内分子还原消除的乙烯基氧化加成。  
2. 某些物种进行环金属化而其他物种不进行的原因仍不清楚，特别是涉及特定金属磷配合物时。  
3. 可能是立体压缩的缓解是金属化PMe3配体的动力，解释了某些金属配合物的选择性。  
4. 对于更拥挤的[(C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2]中间体而言，在磷金属化和分子间碳氢化合物激活之间存在平衡。
