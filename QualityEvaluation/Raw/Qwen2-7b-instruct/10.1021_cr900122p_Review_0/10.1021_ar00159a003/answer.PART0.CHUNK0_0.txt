[1] "There must be two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a coordinately unsaturated metal: (1) direct a-complexation and (2) vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination."
[2] "It is still not clear why species such as [Fe(PMe3),]37 and [ (C5Me5)Re-(PMe3)2]23C undergo cyclometalation whereas [ (C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)] and [ (C5Me5)Ir(PMe3)] do not."
[3] "The more crowded [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate appears to sit in the middle, with both phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation in balance."

1. There are two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from a free olefin and a coordinately unsaturated metal. These pathways include direct a-complexation and vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination.
2. The reason why certain species undergo cyclometalation while others do not is not fully understood. This could potentially relate to factors such as steric compression.
3. The [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate seems to have a balance between phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation due to its crowded nature.

1. 形成自由烯烃和配位不饱和金属之间的烯烃复合物有两条独立的途径：（1）直接a络合，（2）乙烯基氧化加成后进行分子内还原消除。
2. 某些物种发生环金属化而其他物种不发生的原因尚不清楚。这可能与立体压缩等因素有关。
3. [(C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2]中间体似乎在磷烷金属化和分子间烃基激活之间达到平衡，由于其拥挤的性质。
