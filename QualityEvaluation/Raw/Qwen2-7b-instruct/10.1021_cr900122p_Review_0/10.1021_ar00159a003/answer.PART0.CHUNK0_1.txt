[1] "Evidence with Re(PPh3)2H7,35 CpRe(PMe3)3,25Cid and Fe- all indicates that a direct oxidative addition pathway exists in addition to a-coordination."
[2] "Furthermore, reductive elimination of the vinyl hydride can also lead directly to the a-olefin complex."
[3] "It is also interesting to note that the microscopic reverse of this sequence implies that olefin dissociation from the metal also can occur by two pathways, one of which involves intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination of free olefin!"
[4] "The factors controlling intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remains poorly understood in a general sense."
[5] "It may be that relief of steric compression is the driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, a force that is not so important in the [ (C5Me5)M(PMe3)] intermediates."

The scientific literature discusses two primary pathways for forming an olefin complex from a free olefin and a coordinately unsaturated metal: direct a-complexation and vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination. The literature also notes that the microscopic reverse of the activation sequence implies two pathways for olefin dissociation from the metal, involving either intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination or direct dissociation. However, the factors controlling the intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remain poorly understood in a general sense. Relief of steric compression is suggested as a possible driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, which might not be as significant in other intermediates.

文献讨论了从自由烯烃和配位不饱和金属形成烯基复合物的两种主要途径：直接a配位和通过氧化加成和分子内还原消除的乙烯基配位。文献还指出，激活序列的微观逆向暗示了金属上烯烃分解的两种途径，包括分子内乙烯基激活后进行还原消除或直接分解。然而，控制配体中碳氢键分子内激活的因素在一般意义上仍然难以理解。推测缓解立体压缩可能是PMe3配体金属化的驱动力，在其他中间体中，这种力量可能不如重要。
