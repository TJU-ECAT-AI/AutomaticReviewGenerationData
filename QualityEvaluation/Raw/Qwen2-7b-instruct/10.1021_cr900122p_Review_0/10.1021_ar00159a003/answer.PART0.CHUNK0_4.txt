[1] "There must be two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a coordinately unsaturated metal: (1) direct a-complexation and (2) vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination."
[2] "It is still not clear why species such as [Fe(PMe3),]37 and [ (C5Me5)Re- (PMe3)2]23C undergo cyclometalation whereas [ (C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)] and [ (C5Me5)Ir(PMe3)] do not."
[3] "It may be that relief of steric compression is the driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, a force that is not so important in the [ (C5Me5)M(PMe3)] intermediates."

The formation of olefin complexes from free olefins and coordinately unsaturated metals can occur through two independent pathways: direct a-complexation and vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination. The reason why certain species undergo cyclometalation while others do not is not fully understood. Relief of steric compression might be a key factor driving metalation of the PMe3 ligand, although its importance varies across different intermediates.

形成烯烃复合物的途径有两种独立方式：直接a络合和乙烯基氧化性添加，随后进行分子内还原消除。某些物种进行环金属化而另一些不进行的原因尚未完全清楚。可能是因为立体压缩的缓解是驱动PMe3配体金属化的动力，尽管在不同中间体中其重要性存在差异。
