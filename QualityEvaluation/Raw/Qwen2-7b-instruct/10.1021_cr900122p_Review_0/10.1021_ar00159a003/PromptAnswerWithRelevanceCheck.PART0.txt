How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

[1] "There must be two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a coordinately unsaturated metal: (1) direct a-complexation and (2) vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination."
[2] "It is still not clear why species such as [Fe(PMe3),]37 and [ (C5Me5)Re-(PMe3)2]23C undergo cyclometalation whereas [ (C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)] and [ (C5Me5)Ir(PMe3)] do not."
[3] "The more crowded [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate appears to sit in the middle, with both phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation in balance."

1. There are two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from a free olefin and a coordinately unsaturated metal. These pathways include direct a-complexation and vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination.
2. The reason why certain species undergo cyclometalation while others do not is not fully understood. This could potentially relate to factors such as steric compression.
3. The [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate seems to have a balance between phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation due to its crowded nature.

[1] "Evidence with Re(PPh3)2H7,35 CpRe(PMe3)3,25Cid and Fe- all indicates that a direct oxidative addition pathway exists in addition to a-coordination."
[2] "Furthermore, reductive elimination of the vinyl hydride can also lead directly to the a-olefin complex."
[3] "It is also interesting to note that the microscopic reverse of this sequence implies that olefin dissociation from the metal also can occur by two pathways, one of which involves intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination of free olefin!"
[4] "The factors controlling intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remains poorly understood in a general sense."

The scientific literature discusses two primary pathways for forming an olefin complex from a free olefin and a coordinately unsaturated metal: direct a-complexation and vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination. The literature also notes that the microscopic reverse of the activation sequence implies two pathways for olefin dissociation from the metal, involving either intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination or direct dissociation. However, the factors controlling the intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remain poorly understood in a general sense. Relief of steric compression is suggested as a possible driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, which might not be as significant in other intermediates.

文献讨论了从自由烯烃和配位不饱和金属形成烯基复合物的两种主要途径：直接a配位和通过氧化加成和分子内还原消除的乙烯基配位。文献还指出，激活序列的微观逆向暗示了金属上烯烃分解的两种途径，包括分子内乙烯基激活后进行还原消除或直接分解。然而，控制配体中碳氢键分子内激活的因素在一般意义上仍然难以理解。推测缓解立体压缩可能是PMe3配体金属化的驱动力，在其他中间体中，这种力量可能不如重要。

1. There are two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from a free olefin and a coordinately unsaturated metal. The first is direct a-complexation, while the second involves vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination.
2. The reasons why certain species undergo cyclometalation while others do not are not fully understood, particularly regarding the involvement of specific metal-phosphine complexes.
3. Relief of steric compression might be the driving force behind metalation of the PMe3 ligand, explaining the selectivity in certain metal complexes.
4. In the case of the more crowded [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate, phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation are balanced.

The document discusses several mechanisms related to the activation of C-H bonds in metal complexes. One mechanism involves a direct oxidative addition pathway, where the olefin coordinates to the metal center. Another pathway involves a vinylic oxidative addition followed by reductive elimination to form the a-olefin complex. The document also notes that the microscopic reverse of this sequence suggests that olefin dissociation from the metal center can occur via two pathways, including intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination of the free olefin. However, the factors controlling intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remain poorly understood. The document suggests that relief of steric compression might be the driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, which is less important in other intermediates like [ (C5Me5)M(PMe3)]. The crowded [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate appears to balance both phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation.

文档讨论了与金属复合物中C-H键活化相关的几种机制。一种机制涉及直接氧化添加途径，其中烯烃与金属中心配位。另一种途径涉及vinylic氧化添加随后是还原消除形成a-烯烃复合物。文档还指出，微观逆序表明从金属中心分离烯烃可以以两种途径进行，包括通过重新激活分子内vinylic后自由烯烃的还原消除。然而，控制分子内激活的C-H键的配体的因素在一般意义上仍然不清楚。文档提出，可能释放立体压缩是促进PMe3配体金属化的驱动力，在其他中间体[(C5Me5)M(PMe3)]中这一作用不太重要。拥挤的[(C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2]中间体似乎处于平衡状态，同时平衡磷氢金属化和分子间碳氢化合物激活。

The formation of olefin complexes from free olefins and coordinately unsaturated metals can occur through two independent pathways: direct a-complexation and vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination. The reason why certain species undergo cyclometalation while others do not is not fully understood. Relief of steric compression might be a key factor driving metalation of the PMe3 ligand, although its importance varies across different intermediates.

形成烯烃复合物的途径有两种独立方式：直接a络合和乙烯基氧化性添加，随后进行分子内还原消除。某些物种进行环金属化而另一些不进行的原因尚未完全清楚。可能是因为立体压缩的缓解是驱动PMe3配体金属化的动力，尽管在不同中间体中其重要性存在差异。
