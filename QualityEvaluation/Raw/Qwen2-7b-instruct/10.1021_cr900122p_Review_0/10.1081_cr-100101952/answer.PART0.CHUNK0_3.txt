<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. In heterogeneous catalysis, isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. These principles are utilized in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.
