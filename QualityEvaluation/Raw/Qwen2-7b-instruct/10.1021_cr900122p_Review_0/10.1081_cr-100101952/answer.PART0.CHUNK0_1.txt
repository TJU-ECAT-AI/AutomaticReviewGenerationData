<EnglishVersionAnswer>
There are no specific quotes provided that directly address the question regarding how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, the mechanisms involved, or their application in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. The document focuses on the conversion of ethane to aromatic hydrocarbons, but does not delve into the detailed mechanisms of C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysts or provide examples of industrial applications such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

文献中没有直接回答关于孤立金属中心在异相催化中的作用、C-H键活化机制，以及它们在烷烃选择性氧化工业应用中的应用的具体引文。该文档主要关注乙烷转化为芳香烃的过程，但并未深入探讨异相催化剂中C-H键活化机制的详细信息，或提供如丁烷转化为马来酸酐这样的工业应用示例。
