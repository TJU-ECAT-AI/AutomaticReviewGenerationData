In the context of converting ethane to aromatic hydrocarbons, isolated metal centers on oxide materials enable C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These mechanisms are utilized in industrial processes for the selective oxidation of alkanes. A practical example of this principle is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, demonstrating its application in industrial chemistry.
