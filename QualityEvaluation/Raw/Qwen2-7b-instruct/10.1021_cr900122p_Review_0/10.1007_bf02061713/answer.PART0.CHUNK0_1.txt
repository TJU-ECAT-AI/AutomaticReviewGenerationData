[1] "The plot passes through a maximum for py and a minimum for Ac."
[2] "The curve for py goes through a maximum and that for Ac through a minimum with extrema at about 30 Al-atoms/U.C."
[3] "The results indicate that this value decreases if the A1 content decreases below 30 AI/U.C."
[4] "Nevertheless,it does not seem probable that although some of the sites are less accessible for py,other sites are more accessible for Ac."

1. The plot of the ratio of the number of adsorbed py and Ac molecules to the number of A1 atoms shows a maximum for py and a minimum for Ac. 
2. For py, the adsorption curve reaches a maximum, and for Ac, it reaches a minimum at approximately 30 Al-atoms per unit cell (U.C.). 
3. As the A1 content decreases below 30 AI/U.C., the average number of py molecules strongly bound on a site under fixed conditions decreases.
4. It seems unlikely that the accessibility of other sites for Ac increases while some sites are less accessible for py when the A1 content decreases.

1. 对于吡啶和乙酸的吸附比与铝原子数的关系图，吡啶的曲线在大约每单位细胞（U.C.）30个Al原子处达到最大值，而乙酸的曲线在该位置达到最小值。
2. 当Al含量低于每单位细胞30个Al原子时，对于吡啶，吸附量随着Al含量的降低而减少，而对于乙酸，其吸附量在相同条件下也相应减少。
3. 当Al含量降低至每单位细胞30个Al原子以下时，固定条件下每个位点上强吸附的吡啶分子数量会减少。
4. 在Al含量降低的情况下，不太可能的情况是某些位点对吡啶的可接近性降低，而其他位点对乙酸的可接近性却增加。
