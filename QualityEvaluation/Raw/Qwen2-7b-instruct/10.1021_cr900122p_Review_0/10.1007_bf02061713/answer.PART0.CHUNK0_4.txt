[1] "The plot passes through a maximum for py and a minimum for Ac."
[2] "The curve for py goes through a maximum and that for Ac through a minimum with extrema at about 30 Al-atoms/U.C."
[3] "The results indicate that this value decreases if the A1 content decreases below 30 AI/U.C."
[4] "Nevertheless, it does not seem probable that although some of the sites are less accessible for py, other sites are more accessible for Ac."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The plot for py shows a maximum and the plot for Ac shows a minimum when considering the number of adsorbed molecules related to the number of A1 atoms. These extrema occur around 30 Al-atoms per unit cell.
2. As the A1 content decreases below 30 AI/U.C., the average number of py molecules strongly bound on a site under fixed conditions decreases.
3. It seems unlikely that sites become more accessible for Ac while some sites become less accessible for py, given the observed trends.

1. 对于py，其曲线显示最大值；对于Ac，则显示最小值。这些极值大约在每单位细胞30个Al原子处发生。
2. 当A1含量低于30 AI/U.C.时，一个固定条件下每个站点上强烈结合的py分子的数量会减少。
3. 看起来不太可能的是，一些位点变得对py更难接近，而其他位点则变得更容易接近Ac，鉴于观察到的趋势。
