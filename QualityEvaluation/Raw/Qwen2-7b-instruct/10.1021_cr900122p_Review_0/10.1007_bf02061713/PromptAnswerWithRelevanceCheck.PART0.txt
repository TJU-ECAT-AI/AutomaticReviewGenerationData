The adsorption study on dealuminated HY zeolites reveals that the adsorption of pyridine (py) and acetic acid (Ac) shows distinct behaviors with respect to aluminum (Al) content. Specifically, the adsorption of py peaks at approximately 30 Al atoms per unit cell (U.C.), while the adsorption of Ac shows a minimum at the same Al content. As the Al content decreases below 30 Al atoms per U.C., the ability of the zeolite sites to adsorb py decreases, suggesting a reduction in acid strength. Conversely, the adsorption of Ac increases, indicating an enhancement in base strength. This implies that the acid strength of the zeolite sites decreases and their base strength increases when the Al content falls within the range of 30 to 0 Al atoms per U.C.

吸附研究显示，dealuminated HY沸石上吡啶（py）和乙酸（Ac）的吸附行为与铝（Al）含量具有明显的差异。具体来说，吡啶的吸附在约每单位细胞（U.C.）30个Al原子处达到峰值，而乙酸的吸附在相同的Al含量下出现最小值。当Al含量低于每U.C. 30个Al原子时，沸石位点吸附吡啶的能力降低，暗示酸强度的下降。相反，乙酸的吸附增加，表明碱强度的增强。这表明，当Al含量在30至0个Al原子/单位细胞的范围内降低时，沸石位点的酸强度下降，而其碱强度增加。

INTRODUCTION
A GREAT NUMBER OF PAPERS HAS BEEN DEVOTED RECENTLY TO THE ACIDITY OF ZEOLITES [1,2]. IN CONTRAST TO ACIDIC PROPERTIES, MUCH LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO BASICITY [3,4]. THE ACIDITY OF ZEOLITES DEPENDS, AMONG OTHERS, ON THE NUMBER AND DENSITY OF ACID SITES. THE NUMBER OF ACID SITES EQUALS THEORETICALLY THE NUMBER OF Al ATOMS IN THE ZEOLITE STRUCTURE. OUR WORK IS AIMED AT FINDING A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE Al CONTENT AND THE AVERAGE ACID AS WELL AS THE BASE STRENGTH OF THE SITES IN HY zeolites DEALUMINATED TO DIFFERENT DEGREES.
EXPERIMENTAL
ZEOLITE SAMPLES WERE OBTAINED BY COURTESY OF DR. H.K. BEYER. THEY WERE PREPARED FROM NAY zeolite BY DEALUMINATION WITH THEN ION-EXCHANGED FOR NH [5]. Al CONTENTS OF THE SAM- PLES ARE SHOWN IN TABLE I.
THE FLOW-GRAVIMETRIC TECHNIQUE [6] WAS USED TO MEASURE THE ADSORPTION OF PY AND Ac. 200 MG OF ZEOLITE WAS PRETREATED AT 673 K IN HELIUM STREAM UNTIL CONSTANT WEIGHT WAS REACHED, THEN ADSORPTION AND DESORPTION MEASUREMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT 553 K. THE FIRST SAMPLE WAS CONTACTED WITH HELIUM SATURATED WITH THE ADSORBATIVE AT 293 K. WHEN THE INCREASE OF THE SAMPLE-WEIGHT CEASED, WEAKLY BOUND ADSORBATE WAS ELUTED WITH HELIUM FOR 1 H. CLOSE TO THE END OF THIS PERIOD, THE WEIGHT DECREASE BECAME VERY SLOW. THE AMOUNT OF ADSORBATE RETAINED BY THE SAMPLE WAS CONSIDERED AS THE "STRONGLY BOUND" PART OF THE TOTAL ADSORBED AMOUNT.

The study examines the adsorption of pyridine (Py) and acetic acid (Ac) on dealuminated HY zeolites with Al content ranging from 3.9 to 58 per unit cell (U.C.). Adsorption is studied at 553 K using a flow gravimetric technique. The ratio of the number of adsorbed Py and Ac molecules to the number of Al atoms is plotted against the Al content. For Py, the plot reaches a maximum, whereas for Ac, it reaches a minimum.

The introduction highlights the recent focus on zeolite acidity, noting that less attention has been given to their basicity. The number of acid sites in zeolites is theorized to equate to the number of Al atoms in the zeolite structure. The study aims to correlate the Al content with the average acid and base strength of the sites in dealuminated HY zeolites.

The experimental section details the preparation of zeolite samples by dealumination followed by ion exchange with NH. Adsorption and desorption measurements are conducted using a flow gravimetric technique at 553 K. The adsorption process involves contacting the sample with helium saturated with the adsorbate at 293 K. Weakly bound adsorbate is eluted with helium for 1 hour, with the retained amount considered as the "strongly bound" part.

Table 1 presents the adsorption of Py and Ac on HY zeolite samples with varying Al content. The adsorbed amounts are lower on zeolites with less Al. However, plotting the ratio of adsorbed Py and Ac molecules to the number of Al atoms against the Al content reveals distinct patterns for Py and Ac.

The discussion section explains that the acid strength of zeolite sites depends on the Si/Al ratio. Models suggest that the protonic acidity associated with an AlO4 tetrahedron is influenced by the number of close Al neighbors. As the Al content decreases, the acid strength is expected to increase continuously. At very low Al concentrations, short-range interactions are negligible, and the acid strength becomes independent of the degree of dealumination.

For faujasite, the highest and constant acid strength region is predicted to be reached at Al contents smaller than 28-30 Al atoms per U.C. The study characterizes the average acid strength of the sites by the average number of Py molecules strongly bound under fixed conditions. The results indicate that this value decreases as the Al content decreases below 30 Al atoms per U.C. This unusual phenomenon could be attributed to Al atoms that are less accessible for Py due to the dealumination process.

Infrared spectroscopic studies confirm that OH groups near Al atoms exhibit properties of Brnsted-type acid centers, but interact with organic acid molecules as Brnsted basic centers. Pyrrole adsorption measurements show that while the acidity of zeolites decreases in different cationic forms, their basicity increases. Zeolites in Na or K form display amphoteric properties.

The study concludes that the number of adsorbed Ac molecules relative to the number of Al atoms varies oppositely with the Al content of the zeolite compared to Py. This suggests that the acid strength of the sites decreases, and their base strength increases as the Al content decreases within the range of 30 to 0 Al atoms per U.C. However, it seems unlikely that some sites are less accessible for Py while other sites are more accessible for Ac. Further examinations are planned to elucidate the unexpected acid-base properties of deeply dealuminated faujasites.

该研究探讨了不同Al含量（范围为3.9至58个/单位晶胞）的HY沸石上吡啶（Py）和乙酸（Ac）的吸附情况，研究在553 K下通过流体称重技术进行。吸附量与Al原子数的比例随Al含量变化的图表明，对于Py，图达到最大值，而对于Ac，则达到最小值。

引言部分指出，近年来对沸石酸性关注度较高，但对其碱性关注较少。沸石上的酸位数量理论上等于其结构中的Al原子数。本研究旨在寻找Al含量与HY沸石中不同程度脱铝后平均酸性和碱性强弱之间的关系。

实验部分详细描述了通过脱铝和NH离子交换制备沸石样品的过程。在553 K下使用流体称重技术进行吸附和脱附测量。吸附过程涉及将样品与饱和有吸附剂的氦气接触在293 K下。当样品质量增加停止时，弱吸附物用氦气洗脱1小时。接近此过程结束时，质量下降变得非常缓慢。考虑保留的质量作为总吸附量中的“强结合”部分。

表1列出了不同Al含量的HY沸石样品上Py和Ac的吸附量。随着Al含量增加，吸附量降低。然而，将吸附Py和Ac分子数与Al原子数的比例绘制在Al含量坐标轴上揭示了Py和Ac的不同模式。

讨论部分解释了沸石位点的酸强度依赖于Si/Al比。模型表明，与AlO4四面体相关的质子酸性受到邻近Al原子数量的影响。随着Al含量减少，酸强度预计会连续增加。当Al浓度非常低时，短程相互作用可忽略不计，并且酸强度在脱铝程度上变得独立。

对于faujasite，预测在Al含量小于28-30个Al原子/单位晶胞时达到最高的和恒定的酸强度区域。研究通过固定条件下的固定数量的Py分子强烈吸附来表征位点的平均酸强度。结果表明，在Al含量低于30个Al原子/单位晶胞时，这个值会降低。这种异常现象可能归因于由于脱铝过程而难以接近Py的Al原子。

红外光谱研究表明，靠近Al原子的OH基团表现出Brnsted型酸中心的性质，但与有机酸分子交互时表现为Brnsted基本中心。通过吡咯吸附测量发现，尽管不同阳离子形式的沸石酸度降低，其碱性增加。Na或K形式的沸石显示出两性性质。

研究结论指出，随着Al含量从30降至0个Al原子/单位晶胞，与Al原子数相比，吸附Ac分子的数量呈现出相反的趋势。这表明位点的酸强度降低，而其碱强度增加。然而，似乎不太可能某些位点对于Py的访问性降低，而其他位点对于Ac的访问性增加。计划进一步研究以阐明深度脱铝faujasites的意外酸碱性质。

Zeolite samples were obtained by courtesy of Dr. H.K. Beyer. They were prepared from NaY zeolite by dealumination with then ion-exchanged for NH [5].

The flow-gravimetric technique [6] was used to measure the adsorption of py and Ac.

RESULTS

The amount of py and Ac strongly bound on HY zeolites at 553 K can be seen in Table i. The adsorbed amount of both ad- sorbates is lower on zeolites containing less AI. However, if the number of adsorbate molecules related to the number of A1 atoms is plotted as a function of the A1 content (Fig. I) curves show different characteristics for py and Ac. The curve for py goes through a maximum and that for Ac through a mini- mum with extrema at about 30 Al-atoms/U.C.

DISCUSSION

The acid strength of sites in zeolites depends on the Si/AI ratio. The cluster model provides an explanation for the varia- tion of the acid strength. According to the mode due to short range interactions the protonic acidity associated with an AIO;tetrahedron depends on the number of close A1 neighbors of the tetrahedron [i].

Another model applies the Sanderson electroneg- ativity equalization concept [7]. This model suggests that for faujasites of various A1 contents the charge on the protons,i.e. the acid strength of the Brnsted-acid sites increases con- tinuously as the A1 content decreases [8].

When the A1 concentration is very small, short-range in- teractions are negligible. After a critical Si/AI ratio the acid strength is supposed to become independent of the degree of dealumination.

For faujasite, the highest and constant acid strength region is predicted to be reached at Al-contents smaller than 28-30 AI/U.C.

[2].

We characterized the average acid strength of the sites by the average number of py molecules strongly bound on a site under fixed conditions. The results indicate that this value decreases if the A1 content decreases below 30 AI/U.C. One ex- planation for this unusual phenomenon may be that A1 atoms which can be less easily removed by a SiC14 treatment, are less accessible for py.

Infrared spectroscopic studies of adsorbed py verified that OH groups in close proximity of A1 atoms show the proper- ties of Brnsted type acid centers, however, in interaction with organic acid molecules the same sites exhibit the proper- ties of a Brnsted basic center [3]. Acetate ions are formed as a result of the reaction between the zeolitic OH groups and the adsorbed Ac molecules.

It has been shown by pyrrole adsorption measurements that while the acidity of zeolites in different cationic forms de- creases (in the sequence of Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs) their basic- ity increases [4]. Zeolites in Na or K form have amphoteric properties.

Our results snow that the number of adsorbed Ac molecules related to the number of A1 atoms varies according to an oppo- site trend with the A1 content of the zeolite as the number of adsorbed py. This strongly suggests that the acid strength of the sites decreases and, concomitantly,their base strength in- creases if the A1 content of the HY zeolite decreases in the range of 30 to O AI/U.C. Nevertheless,it does not seem proba- ble that although some of the sites are less accessible for py,other sites are more accessible for Ac. Further examinations are planned to find an explanation for the unexpected acid-base properties of the deeply dealuminated fau]asites.

Answer: The study found that the adsorption of pyridine (py) and acetic acid (Ac) on dealuminated HY zeolites shows distinct behaviors depending on the aluminum (Al) content within the zeolite structure. Specifically, the adsorption ratio of py to the number of Al atoms reaches a maximum, while the ratio for Ac reaches a minimum at an Al content of approximately 30 Al atoms per unit cell (U.C.). This indicates that the acid strength of the zeolite sites decreases, and their base strength increases as the Al content drops below 30 Al atoms per U.C. This unusual behavior might be explained by the reduced accessibility of py to certain sites, possibly due to less easily removable Al atoms that are less accessible for py binding. In contrast, other sites might become more accessible for Ac binding, contributing to the observed opposite trends in acid-base properties.

答案：研究发现，不同铝（Al）含量的处理过的HY沸石上吡啶（py）和乙酸（Ac）的吸附行为表现出显著差异。具体来说，在约每单位晶胞（U.C.）有30个Al原子时，吡啶与Al原子的数量比达到最大，而乙酸与Al原子的数量比达到最小。这表明沸石位点的酸强度降低，而碱强度增加，当Al含量低于每U.C. 30个Al原子时。这种不寻常的行为可能解释为吡啶对某些位点的可接近性降低，可能是由于较难去除的Al原子，这些Al原子对于吡啶结合的可接近性较差。相反，其他位点可能变得更容易被乙酸结合，导致观察到的酸碱性质的相反趋势。
