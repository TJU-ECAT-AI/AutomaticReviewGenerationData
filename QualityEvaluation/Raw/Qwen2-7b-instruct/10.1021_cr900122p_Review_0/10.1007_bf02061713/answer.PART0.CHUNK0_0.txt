[1] "The curve for py goes through a maximum and that for Ac through a minimum with extrema at about 30 Al-atoms/U.C."
[2] "The results indicate that this value decreases if the A1 content decreases below 30 AI/U.C."
[3] "This strongly suggests that the acid strength of the sites decreases and, concomitantly,their base strength increases if the A1 content of the HY zeolite decreases in the range of 30 to O AI/U.C."

The adsorption study on dealuminated HY zeolites reveals that the adsorption of pyridine (py) and acetic acid (Ac) shows distinct behaviors with respect to aluminum (Al) content. Specifically, the adsorption of py peaks at approximately 30 Al atoms per unit cell (U.C.), while the adsorption of Ac shows a minimum at the same Al content. As the Al content decreases below 30 Al atoms per U.C., the ability of the zeolite sites to adsorb py decreases, suggesting a reduction in acid strength. Conversely, the adsorption of Ac increases, indicating an enhancement in base strength. This implies that the acid strength of the zeolite sites decreases and their base strength increases when the Al content falls within the range of 30 to 0 Al atoms per U.C.

吸附研究显示，dealuminated HY沸石上吡啶（py）和乙酸（Ac）的吸附行为与铝（Al）含量具有明显的差异。具体来说，吡啶的吸附在约每单位细胞（U.C.）30个Al原子处达到峰值，而乙酸的吸附在相同的Al含量下出现最小值。当Al含量低于每U.C. 30个Al原子时，沸石位点吸附吡啶的能力降低，暗示酸强度的下降。相反，乙酸的吸附增加，表明碱强度的增强。这表明，当Al含量在30至0个Al原子/单位细胞的范围内降低时，沸石位点的酸强度下降，而其碱强度增加。
