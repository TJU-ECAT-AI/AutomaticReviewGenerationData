[1] "In this spectral range, absorption bands of stretching vibrations of the terminal silanol groups of acid-bridging GaO(H)Si groups and of the OH groups located at nonframework gallium species appear."
[2] "The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions."
[3] "The asymmetric TOT stretching vibration occurs at 1090 cm-1 if the aluminum framework concentration is high (5 Al per unit cell) and is shifted to 1104 cm-1 at low aluminum contents (0.6 Al per unit cell)."
[4] "The shift of the TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers after isomorphous substitution of Si by larger atoms is due to the change in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the lengthening of the TO bond by large T atoms."
[5] "With [Ga]-omega, Mirajkar et al.163 found a very broad band at 1060 cm-1 due to the asymmetric SiOGa stretching vibration characteristic of poorly crystallized samples."
[6] "The intensity of the resulting IR vibrations can be normalized upon the mass of the disks."
[7] "This finding is not in line with the commonly accepted view that substitution of aluminum by gallium would lower the acid strength of Brnsted sites."
[8] "Quantum chemical cluster calculations for a series of gallium-free zeolite structures (LTA, MEL, MFI, OFF, MOR, FAU, and LTL) yielded partial charges of the bridging oxygen of Brnsted sites which correlate with experimental acidities determined by the catalytic activity of the 2-propanol decomposition or estimated from the position of the peak maxima in the desorptograms of NH3-TPD."
[9] "The peak areas contain information on the concentration of sites."
[10] "It is suggested that at dehydroxylated surfaces a dissociative adsorption of NH3 is possible as shown by eq 26."

1. The absorption bands of stretching vibrations of terminal silanol groups and OH groups located at nonframework gallium species indicate the incorporation of gallium into zeolite framework positions.

2. The asymmetric TOT stretching vibration of gallium species varies depending on the aluminum concentration in the framework.

3. The shift of TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers is due to the change in reduced mass and bond length upon substitution.

4. Poor crystallinity in [Ga]-omega zeolites is associated with a broad asymmetric SiOGa stretching vibration.

5. IR vibration intensity normalization helps in quantitative comparison of results across different samples.

6. Contrary to common belief, gallium substitution does not necessarily lower Brnsted acid site strength.

7. Quantum chemical calculations predict partial charges of Brnsted sites correlating with experimental acidities.

8. The area of desorption peaks in TPDA profiles provides information on the concentration and strength of acid sites.

9. Dissociative adsorption of ammonia is possible at dehydroxylated surfaces, as supported by theoretical models.
