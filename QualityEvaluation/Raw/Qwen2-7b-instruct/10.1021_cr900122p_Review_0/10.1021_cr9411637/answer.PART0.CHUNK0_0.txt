<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Isomorphous substitution is a common phenomenon in mineralogy where atoms within the framework of a crystalline compound are replaced by atoms of other elements without altering the crystal structure's type. The thermodynamics of this process have been explored by researchers like Barrer, and the main factors influencing isomorphous substitution have been summarized by Ione and Vostrikova.
