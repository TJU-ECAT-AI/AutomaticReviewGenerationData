[1] "Le van Mao and Yao455 could not confirm the transfer of gallium species into the interior of the zeolite."
[2] "They found that extruding a wet mixture of a Ga-loaded silica cocatalyst, [Al]-ZSM-5, with a bentonite binder yields a hybrid catalyst for the aromatization of n-butane which is superior to the Cyclar catalyst."
[3] "In this catalyst, gallium is considered to be very far away from the zeolitic acid sites."
[4] "The hybrid catalyst with separated zeolite and gallium component exhibits a long-term stability."
[5] "Considering the magnitude of distances (several micrometers) to be bridged by migration of gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it seems reasonable to modify the concept of bifunctional configuration of active sites based on adjacent gallium species and acidic protons."

1. Le van Mao and Yao did not confirm the transfer of gallium species into the interior of the zeolite. 
2. They discovered that by extruding a mixture containing a Ga-loaded silica cocatalyst with [Al]-ZSM-5 and bentonite, they created a hybrid catalyst for n-butane aromatization that outperformed the Cyclar catalyst.
3. In this hybrid catalyst, gallium is believed to be distant from the zeolite's acid sites.
4. The hybrid catalyst demonstrates long-term stability.
5. Given the substantial distances (several micrometers) that gallium needs to travel between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it makes sense to revise the concept of a bifunctional configuration of active sites, which previously relied on nearby gallium species and acidic protons.

1. 李万茂和姚455没有证实镓物种转移到了沸石内部。
2. 他们发现，通过挤压含有Ga负载硅酸盐共催化剂与[Al]-ZSM-5和膨润土的湿混合物，可以制造出一种用于异构化n-丁烷的复合催化剂，其性能优于Cyclar催化剂。
3. 在这种复合催化剂中，认为镓远离沸石酸位点。
4. 这种复合催化剂表现出长期稳定性。
5. 考虑到镓在共催化剂和沸石之间需要跨越几微米的距离才能移动，重新定义活性位点的双功能配置概念是有道理的，该概念以前依赖于相邻的镓物种和酸性质子。
