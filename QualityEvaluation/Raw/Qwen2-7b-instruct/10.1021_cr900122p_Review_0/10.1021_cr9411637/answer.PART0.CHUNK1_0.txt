[1] "The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions."
[2] "Infrared characterization data of gallium analogs for known zeolite structures."
[3] "Hydroxyl Vibrations. In this spectral range, absorption bands of stretching vibrations of the terminal silanol groups of acid-bridging GaO(H)Si groups and of the OH groups located at nonframework gallium species appear."
[4] "The asymmetric TOT stretching vibration occurs at 1090 cm-1 if the aluminum framework concentration is high (5 Al per unit cell) and is shifted to 1104 cm-1 at low aluminum contents (0.6 Al per unit cell)."
[5] "The shift of the TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers after isomorphous substitution of Si by larger atoms is due to the change in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the lengthening of the TO bond by large T atoms."
