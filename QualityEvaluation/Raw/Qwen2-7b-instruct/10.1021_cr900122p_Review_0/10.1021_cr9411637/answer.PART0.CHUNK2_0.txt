The synthesis of these new materials is achieved by combining an appropriate surfactant molecule, usually hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide or hydroxide (CTABr or CTAOH) with a silicon source like SiO2, silica sol, water glass, or tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in aqueous solution.379-382 Different pH values are applied: acidic, alkaline, or nearly neutral synthesis gels. The concentration of the surfactant must be high enough to ensure micelle formation. Different types of micelles can be formed at different concentrations of the surfactant. Therefore, the surfactant/silica ratio has an important impact on the actual structure type formed. Crystallization of mesoporous silicates is obtained by aging the gel at room temperature or by hydrothermal treatment between 40 and 50 C, usually at 80120 C.

The synthesis of mesoporous silicates involves combining a surfactant, typically hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide or hydroxide, with a silicon source in aqueous solution. The pH, surfactant concentration, and silica/surfactant ratio determine the structure type. Crystallization is achieved by aging the gel at room temperature or through hydrothermal treatment at temperatures ranging from 40 to 120 C.

Gallophosphates containing a porous framework structure were first prepared by Parise. 422 Since then, further structures have been synthesized, some of them structurally similar or identical with aluminosilicates or aluminophosphates; others are completely new. A survey has been given by SchottDarie et al. 423 emphasizing the structure-directing effect of the template molecules.
