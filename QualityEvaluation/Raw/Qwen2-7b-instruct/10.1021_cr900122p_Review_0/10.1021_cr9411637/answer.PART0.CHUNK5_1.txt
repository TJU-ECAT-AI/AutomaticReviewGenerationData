The development of a multistep process for converting butane to maleic anhydride relies on the activation of C-H bonds through the use of isolated metal centers on oxide materials. This activation process involves the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms. These mechanisms have been applied in the selective oxidation of alkanes, specifically in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

开发了一种多步过程，用于将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。这一转化过程依赖于氧化材料上孤立金属中心对C-H键的激活。这种激活过程涉及马尔斯范克里夫伦和H抽象机制。这些机制被应用于烷烃的选择性氧化中，特别是在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中。
