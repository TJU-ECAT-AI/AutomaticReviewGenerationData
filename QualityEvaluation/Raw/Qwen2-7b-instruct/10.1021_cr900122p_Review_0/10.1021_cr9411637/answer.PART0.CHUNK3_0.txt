[1] "With the aromatization of propane, Price and Kanazirev454 observed very long induction periods (up to 24 h) for ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The authors ascribed this effect to the slow reduction process creating redispersed active Ga+ species that migrate into the zeolite interior where a solid-state ion exchange occurs."
[2] "Pretreatment of the freshly prepared catalyst with hydrogen at elevated temperatures was found to shorten the induction period and to increase activity."
[3] "This kind of thermal pretreatment obviously anticipates reduction/redispersion of Ga species otherwise proceeding in the early stages of the catalytic reaction."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The slow reduction process during the preparation of β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts leads to a long induction period for the aromatization of propane. This is due to the creation of dispersed Ga+ species that migrate into the zeolite interior, resulting in a solid-state ion exchange. Pretreating the catalyst with hydrogen at high temperatures can reduce this induction period and increase activity by facilitating the redispersion of Ga species. This redispersion is crucial for the catalytic activity of the Ga-containing catalyst.

在β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5催化剂的制备过程中，缓慢的还原过程导致丙烷芳香化时存在很长的诱导期。这是由于形成分散的Ga+物种迁移到沸石内部并进行固态离子交换的结果。通过将催化剂在高温下与氢气预处理可以缩短诱导期并增加活性，通过促进Ga物种的再分散。这种再分散对于Ga基催化剂的催化活性至关重要。

[1] "Le van Mao and Yao455 could not confirm the transfer of gallium species into the interior of the zeolite."
[2] "They found that extruding a wet mixture of a Ga-loaded silica cocatalyst, [Al]-ZSM-5, with a bentonite binder yields a hybrid catalyst for the aromatization of n-butane which is superior to the Cyclar catalyst."
[3] "In this catalyst, gallium is considered to be very far away from the zeolitic acid sites."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Le van Mao and Yao455 were unable to confirm the transfer of gallium species into the interior of the zeolite. Instead, they found that extruding a wet mixture of a gallium-loaded silica cocatalyst, [Al]-ZSM-5, with a bentonite binder results in a hybrid catalyst for n-butane aromatization that outperforms the Cyclar catalyst. In this hybrid catalyst, gallium is considered to be distant from the zeolite's acidic sites.

Le van Mao和Yao455未能证实镓物种转移到沸石内部。相反，他们发现挤出湿混合物，其中包含负载有镓的硅酸盐共催化剂和膨润土粘结剂的[Al]-ZSM-5，生成了一种用于n-丁烷芳香化的杂化催化剂，该催化剂优于Cyclar催化剂。在这一杂化催化剂中，认为镓远离沸石酸性位点。

[1] "Considering the magnitude of distances (several micrometers) to be bridged by migration of gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it seems reasonable to modify the concept of bifunctional configuration of active sites based on adjacent gallium species and acidic protons."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Given the significant distances (several micrometers) that need to be bridged by the migration of gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it is reasonable to revise the concept of a bifunctional configuration of active sites, based on neighboring gallium species and acidic protons.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
考虑到需要跨越几个微米的距离，以迁移镓从共催化剂到沸石之间，根据相邻的镓物种和酸性质子重新定义活性位点的双功能配置是合理的。
