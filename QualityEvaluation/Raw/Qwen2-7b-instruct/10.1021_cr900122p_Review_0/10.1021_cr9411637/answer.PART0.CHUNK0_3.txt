[1] "In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example of how isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation. This process relies on the use of metal catalysts, which are typically supported on an oxide substrate, to enable the breaking of the C-H bond and subsequent addition of oxygen or other functional groups."
[2] "The activation of C-H bonds by isolated metal centers on oxide materials often involves mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal center facilitates the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane molecule, creating a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then reacts with oxygen or other functional groups to form the desired product."
[3] "In the case of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, the metal catalyst is typically supported on an oxide such as alumina or silica. The metal, often from the group VIII transition metals like palladium or platinum, is dispersed on the oxide surface as isolated centers. These centers are capable of activating the C-H bonds of butane through the aforementioned mechanisms, leading to the selective oxidation to maleic anhydride."
[4] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a specific example of industrial selective oxidation processes that utilize isolated metal centers on oxide materials. This process is critical in the petrochemical industry for the production of maleic anhydride, which is a valuable feedstock for the manufacture of plastics, resins, and other chemical products."

工业上选择性氧化烷烃，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例，依赖于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心来促进C-H键的活化。此过程采用火星范克列文途径和氢摘取机制。在火星范克列文机制中，金属中心从烷烃分子中摘取一个氢原子，形成一个碳正离子中间体。该中间体随后与氧或其他功能性基团反应形成所需产物。作为来自第VIII族过渡金属如钯或铂的金属催化剂，通常分散在氧化铝或硅胶等基质上。这些孤立中心能够激活丁烷中的C-H键，从而实现选择性氧化为马来酸酐。这一过程对于石油化学工业生产马来酸酐至关重要，马来酸酐是制造塑料、树脂和其他化学产品的宝贵原料。
