[1] "The production of the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) by the acid-catalyzed equilibrium reaction of methanol and isobutene over ion-exchange resin catalysts at low temperatures (330350 K) consumed more than 20 million tons in 1994."
[2] "The chain length of olefins can be controlled by shape-selective zeolites to give maximum C2 C4 olefin yields."
[3] "Ga-modified ZSM-5 mostly produces C5-C11 aliphatics."
[4] "Besides aliphatics, aromatics are detected among the products of reaction."
[5] "Ga-containing zeolites are not well suited for an optimum production of light alkenes from methanol."
[6] "Samples with an NH4+/Na+ exchange level of 96% and 4 h thermal pretreatment at 873 K were used (Figure 103ac)."
[7] "Calcination without or in the presence of steam leads to a decline of methanol conversion if the temperature exceeds 1023 (dry calcination) and 873 K (wet impregnation)."
[8] "A few percent of strong acid sites among the total amount is sufficient to guarantee high methanol conversion levels."
[9] "Higher concentrations of Brnsted sites, however, are necessary to allow formation of aliphatics and aromatics."
[10] "The conversion of methanol to aromatics over [Ga]-ZSM-5 has been studied thoroughly by Choudhary and Kinage."
[11] "In contrast to the methanol conversion on [Al]-ZSM-5, the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons on [Ga]-ZSM-5 was found to be remarkable even in samples where only 5% of the Na+ ions are replaced with H+, i.e., at very low exchange degrees."
[12] "Due to the pulse technique, coke formation and its impact on the reaction characteristics could not be observed."
[13] "The coke content does not increase monotonically with methanol supply (with the exception of the Fe silicate) but runs through at least two stages with distinctly slower coke increments."
[14] "The nature of nonframework species and the way they contribute to catalytic reactions are not yet fully understood."
[15] "The inherent hydrophilic character of aluminosilicate and gallosilicates zeolites as well as gallophosphates promotes dealumination or degalliation under reaction conditions accompanied by losses of activity."
[16] "The state of the art is constituted by the manufacturing of mesoporous silicates."
