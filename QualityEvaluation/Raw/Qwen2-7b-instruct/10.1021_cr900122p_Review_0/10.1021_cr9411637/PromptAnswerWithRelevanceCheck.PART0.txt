<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as gallium (Ga), facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. These processes are crucial for the selective oxidation of alkanes. In the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the metal sites undergo oxidation states change, leading to the breaking of C-H bonds and the formation of alcohols. These alcohols further undergo oxidation to form aldehydes and ketones, which are then converted to maleic anhydride via dehydration. This transformation showcases the importance of metal sites in catalytic reactions.

The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions.
Infrared characterization data of gallium analogs for known zeolite structures.
Hydroxyl Vibrations. In this spectral range, absorption bands of stretching vibrations of the terminal silanol groups of acid-bridging GaO(H)Si groups and of the OH groups located at nonframework gallium species appear.
The asymmetric TOT stretching vibration occurs at 1090 cm-1 if the aluminum framework concentration is high (5 Al per unit cell) and is shifted to 1104 cm-1 at low aluminum contents (0.6 Al per unit cell).
The shift of the TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers after isomorphous substitution of Si by larger atoms is due to the change in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the lengthening of the TO bond by large T atoms.

With the aromatization of propane, Price and Kanazirev454 observed very long induction periods (up to 24 h) for ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The authors ascribed this effect to the slow reduction process creating redispersed active Ga+ species that migrate into the zeolite interior where a solid-state ion exchange occurs.
Pretreatment of the freshly prepared catalyst with hydrogen at elevated temperatures was found to shorten the induction period and to increase activity.
This kind of thermal pretreatment obviously anticipates reduction/redispersion of Ga species otherwise proceeding in the early stages of the catalytic reaction.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The slow reduction process during the preparation of β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts leads to a long induction period for the aromatization of propane. This is due to the creation of dispersed Ga+ species that migrate into the zeolite interior, resulting in a solid-state ion exchange. Pretreating the catalyst with hydrogen at high temperatures can reduce this induction period and increase activity by facilitating the redispersion of Ga species. This redispersion is crucial for the catalytic activity of the Ga-containing catalyst.

The synthesis of these new materials is achieved by combining an appropriate surfactant molecule, usually hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide or hydroxide (CTABr or CTAOH) with a silicon source like SiO2, silica sol, water glass, or tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in aqueous solution.379-382 Different pH values are applied: acidic, alkaline, or nearly neutral synthesis gels. The concentration of the surfactant must be high enough to ensure micelle formation. Different types of micelles can be formed at different concentrations of the surfactant. Therefore, the surfactant/silica ratio has an important impact on the actual structure type formed. Crystallization of mesoporous silicates is obtained by aging the gel at room temperature or by hydrothermal treatment between 40 and 50 C, usually at 80120 C.

Brnsted acidity within silicate-like materials is generated when tetravalent Si4+ is replaced with trivalent ions such as Al3+ or Ga3+".
Substitution of Al3+ by Ga3+ in aluminophosphates has no primary effect on Brnsted acidity.
Nonframework gallium is the source of Lewis acidity.
Oxo cations GaO+ on exchange positions of the framework behave as Lewis acids.
Due to the pulse technique, coke formation and its impact on the reaction characteristics could not be observed.
A few percent of strong acid sites among the total amount is sufficient to guarantee high methanol conversion levels.
Higher concentrations of Brnsted sites, however, are necessary to allow formation of aliphatics and aromatics.
The conversion of methanol to aromatics over [Ga]-ZSM-5 has been studied thoroughly by Choudhary and Kinage.
Samples with an NH4+/Na+ exchange level of 96% and 4 h thermal pretreatment at 873 K were used.
Calcination without or in the presence of steam leads to a decline of methanol conversion if the temperature exceeds 1023 (dry calcination) and 873 K (wet impregnation).

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by acting as either Brnsted or Lewis acids. Brnsted acid sites are generated when tetravalent Si4+ is replaced with trivalent ions like Al3+ or Ga3+. Lewis acidity comes from oxo cations GaO+ on exchange positions of the framework. 

2. The principle of using these isolated metal centers involves the activation of C-H bonds through acid-base reactions. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, a Brnsted acid abstracts a proton from a C-H bond, leading to the formation of a carbocation. This carbocation can then undergo further reactions like alkyne addition or ring-opening reactions. In H-abstraction, a Lewis acid abstracts a hydrogen atom from a C-H bond, forming a radical.

3. In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied by designing catalysts with the appropriate metal centers and acidic sites. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride uses a catalyst that selectively oxidizes butane by activating the C-H bonds through acid-base reactions, followed by further oxidation steps.

Answer:
1. 隔离在氧化物材料上的金属中心通过充当Brnsted或Lewis酸来促进C-H键激活，在异相催化中。当四价Si4+被三价离子如Al3+或Ga3+取代时，会产生Brnsted酸位点。框架中的氧基GaO+作为Lewis酸作用于交换位置。 

2. 这些孤立金属中心的原理涉及通过酸碱反应激活C-H键。在Mars van Krevelen机制中，Brnsted酸从C-H键抽象质子，导致形成碳正离子。该碳正离子可以进一步进行如炔烃加成或环开裂等反应。在H抽象中，Lewis酸从C-H键抽象氢原子，形成自由基。

3. 在烷烃的选择性氧化工业应用中，这些原则通过设计具有适当金属中心和酸性位点的催化剂来实现。例如，将丁烷转化为马来酸酐使用一种催化剂，该催化剂选择性地通过酸碱反应激活丁烷的C-H键，随后进行进一步的氧化步骤。

Le van Mao and Yao455 could not confirm the transfer of gallium species into the interior of the zeolite.
They found that extruding a wet mixture of a Ga-loaded silica cocatalyst, [Al]-ZSM-5, with a bentonite binder yields a hybrid catalyst for the aromatization of n-butane which is superior to the Cyclar catalyst.
In this catalyst, gallium is considered to be very far away from the zeolitic acid sites.
The hybrid catalyst with separated zeolite and gallium component exhibits a long-term stability.
Considering the magnitude of distances (several micrometers) to be bridged by migration of gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it seems reasonable to modify the concept of bifunctional configuration of active sites based on adjacent gallium species and acidic protons.

In any case, selectivity decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios.
The authors gave no conversion data for methanol.
In the following years he extended his research on supported and nonsupported heteropoly acid catalysts.
The conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons on [Ga]-ZSM-5 was found to be remarkable even in samples where only 5% of the Na+ ions are replaced with H+, i.e., at very low exchange degrees.
The point of deactivation was defined as the reaction time at which the hydrocarbon production ceased and methanol was converted into DME only.

In contrast to the methanol conversion on [Al]-ZSM-5, the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons on [Ga]-ZSM-5 was found to be remarkable even in samples where only 5% of the Na+ ions are replaced with H+, i.e., at very low exchange degrees.
Due to the pulse technique, coke formation and its impact on the reaction characteristics could not be observed.
The coke content does not increase monotonically with methanol supply (with the exception of the Fe silicate) but runs through at least two stages with distinctly slower coke increments.
The nature of nonframework species and the way they contribute to catalytic reactions are not yet fully understood.
The inherent hydrophilic character of aluminosilicate and gallosilicates zeolites as well as gallophosphates promotes dealumination or degalliation under reaction conditions accompanied by losses of activity.
The state of the art is constituted by the manufacturing of mesoporous silicates.

In this spectral range, absorption bands of stretching vibrations of the terminal silanol groups of acid-bridging GaO(H)Si groups and of the OH groups located at nonframework gallium species appear.
The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions.
The asymmetric TOT stretching vibration occurs at 1090 cm-1 if the aluminum framework concentration is high (5 Al per unit cell) and is shifted to 1104 cm-1 at low aluminum contents (0.6 Al per unit cell).
The shift of the TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers after isomorphous substitution of Si by larger atoms is due to the change in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the lengthening of the TO bond by large T atoms.
With [Ga]-omega, Mirajkar et al.163 found a very broad band at 1060 cm-1 due to the asymmetric SiOGa stretching vibration characteristic of poorly crystallized samples.
The intensity of the resulting IR vibrations can be normalized upon the mass of the disks.
This finding is not in line with the commonly accepted view that substitution of aluminum by gallium would lower the acid strength of Brnsted sites.
Quantum chemical cluster calculations for a series of gallium-free zeolite structures (LTA, MEL, MFI, OFF, MOR, FAU, and LTL) yielded partial charges of the bridging oxygen of Brnsted sites which correlate with experimental acidities determined by the catalytic activity of the 2-propanol decomposition or estimated from the position of the peak maxima in the desorptograms of NH3-TPD.
The peak areas contain information on the concentration of sites.
It is suggested that at dehydroxylated surfaces a dissociative adsorption of NH3 is possible as shown by eq 26.

With the aromatization of propane, Price and Kanazirev454 observed very long induction periods (up to 24 h) for ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
Pretreatment of the freshly prepared catalyst with hydrogen at elevated temperatures was found to shorten the induction period and to increase activity.
This kind of thermal pretreatment obviously anticipates reduction of Ga species otherwise proceeding in the early stages of the catalytic reaction.
In the case of propane aromatization, the attack of zeolitic protons produces intermediate C3H9+ carbonium ions which rearrange into C3H7+ and H2 or C2H5+ and CH4.
Analyzing initial product selectivities, Kwak et al.458 found that the addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has no essential effect on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but increases the dehydrogenation rate 7.7-fold (T = 803 K).
An initial and direct carbenium ion formation is considered by several authors.
Nonframework Ga, in concert with H+, acts as dehydrogenating site.
Considering the magnitude of distances (several micrometers) to be bridged by migration of gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it seems reasonable to modify the concept of bifunctional configuration of active sites based on adjacent gallium species and acidic protons.
Conversion of propane and selectivity to aromatics run through a maximum with changing degrees of replacement of H+ by Ga+.
Optimum yields were achieved with catalysts having Ga/(Ga + H+) ratios between 0.4 and 0.5.

In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example of how isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation. This process relies on the use of metal catalysts, which are typically supported on an oxide substrate, to enable the breaking of the C-H bond and subsequent addition of oxygen or other functional groups.
The activation of C-H bonds by isolated metal centers on oxide materials often involves mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal center facilitates the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkane molecule, creating a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then reacts with oxygen or other functional groups to form the desired product.
In the case of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, the metal catalyst is typically supported on an oxide such as alumina or silica. The metal, often from the group VIII transition metals like palladium or platinum, is dispersed on the oxide surface as isolated centers. These centers are capable of activating the C-H bonds of butane through the aforementioned mechanisms, leading to the selective oxidation to maleic anhydride.
The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a specific example of industrial selective oxidation processes that utilize isolated metal centers on oxide materials. This process is critical in the petrochemical industry for the production of maleic anhydride, which is a valuable feedstock for the manufacture of plastics, resins, and other chemical products.

The production of the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) by the acid-catalyzed equilibrium reaction of methanol and isobutene over ion-exchange resin catalysts at low temperatures (330350 K) consumed more than 20 million tons in 1994.
Applications of Ga-based zeolite catalysts are not very numerous, as can be seen from Table 24.
Ga-modified ZSM-5 mostly produces C5-C11 aliphatics.
Besides aliphatics, aromatics are detected among the products of reaction.
In any case, selectivity decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios.
Compared with Al-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities of C2C4 olefins, which is ascribed to their weaker acidity suppressing secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins.

1. Gallium incorporation into zeolite structures is achieved through hydrothermal synthesis, typically involving a gel composition containing gallium source, template, and silica source. For instance, [Ga]-ZSM-5 is synthesized from a gel of composition 1.2 Na2O:0.33Ga2O3:0.67Al2O3:30.2SiO2:26.4TEAOH:267H2O. The gel is hydrothermally treated at approximately 100°C for 14 days without stirring.

2. The degree of gallium incorporation in zeolite structures can be quantified through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. For example, in [Ga]-ZSM-5, gallium content is estimated from the 29Si NMR spectrum, revealing gallium configurations such as Si(4Ga), Si(3Ga), Si(2Ga), and Si(1Ga).

3. The presence of gallium in zeolite structures is confirmed through various analytical techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, IR spectroscopy, and 71Ga MAS NMR spectroscopy are used to verify gallium incorporation and distribution within the zeolite framework.

4. The synthesis of gallium-containing mesoporous silicates, such as MCM-41, is achieved by combining an appropriate surfactant molecule, a silicon source, and gallium source in aqueous solution. The gel is then aged at room temperature or hydrothermally treated at temperatures ranging from 40 to 50°C, usually at 80-120°C.

5. Gallium-modified mesoporous silicates, including MCM-41, exhibit ordered mesoporous structures characterized by pore sizes between 20 and 100 Å. These materials show high surface areas, wide pore volumes, and long, uniform pores, making them suitable for various applications.

6. The incorporation of gallium into the walls of mesoporous silicates, such as MCM-41, is confirmed through 71Ga MAS NMR spectroscopy. The presence of gallium is indicated by the appearance of signals at specific chemical shifts, typically between 139 and 146 ppm.

7. The synthesis of gallium-modified cloverite involves using quinuclidine as a template. The crystal structure of cloverite is built of double four-rings (D4R) with alternating gallium and phosphorus atoms. The presence of gallium in the framework is confirmed through XRD analysis and IR spectroscopy.

8. The acidity of gallium-modified cloverite is controversial. While some studies suggest it contains acidic POH groups, others indicate the presence of strong Brnsted acid sites. The interaction of cloverite with polar molecules can influence its acidity characteristics.

9. The stability of cloverite structure is dependent on the coordination of gallium ions. The structure is stable with 5-fold, 4-fold, or 6-fold coordination, but collapses upon sorption of small polar molecules.

10. Cloverite is used as a catalyst for the gas-phase etherification of isobutene by methanol or ethanol. This ability is attributed to the presence of strong acid sites on the material. The residual fluoride ions in cloverite after template removal and catalysis are believed to enhance its acidic properties.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. This process often involves mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In Mars van Krevelen, the metal center abstracts a proton from the molecule, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate can then undergo further reactions to achieve the desired transformation. H-abstraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the molecule, typically facilitated by a metal center, leading to the formation of a radical or a carbocation. These mechanisms are particularly important in the selective oxidation of alkanes, where the goal is to convert saturated hydrocarbons into functionalized products.

For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the selective oxidation of butane requires precise control over the activation of the C-H bonds and the subsequent selective formation of the double bond and the anhydride functionality. The isolated metal centers, due to their ability to abstract protons or hydrogen atoms, are well-suited for this task. They can selectively activate the desired C-H bonds, leading to the formation of maleic anhydride rather than other potential products. The efficiency and selectivity of this conversion can be influenced by the nature of the metal center, its dispersion on the support material, and the acidity of the surrounding environment.

1. The activation of alkane molecules, particularly propane, in the process of converting them to aromatics requires the direct protonation of CC or CH bonds. This is a key step in initiating the conversion process.

2. The activation of propane and other alkanes in aromatization reactions involves a complex interplay between acid sites on the zeolite framework and non-framework gallium sites. This concerted action facilitates the activation of the alkane molecule.

3. The activation of propane specifically is believed to happen through a dual-function mechanism involving Ga3+O2- pairs and Brnsted acid sites on the zeolite, highlighting the importance of these specific sites in the catalytic process.

4. The reverse hydrogen spill-over phenomenon, which facilitates the desorption of hydrogen, plays a crucial role in accelerating the desorption process over Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts. This mechanism contributes to overcoming kinetic bottlenecks in the aromatization of alkanes.

5. The overall mechanism for propane aromatization over Ga-containing MFI zeolite catalysts, as outlined by Derouane et al., suggests multiple potential pathways for the activation of alkanes, including direct activation and pseudo-protonated cyclopropane activation.

6. Dehydrogenation of propane is a crucial step that leads to the formation of propene. This process results in the creation of a C3H7+ carbenium ion, which is a central intermediate in the conversion to aromatics.

7. An alternative activation pathway involves the direct activation of propane with an intermediate pseudo-protonated cyclopropane. This intermediate then decomposes, yielding carbenium ions that contribute to the final conversion to aromatics.
