[1] "The production of the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) by the acid-catalyzed equilibrium reaction of methanol and isobutene over ion-exchange resin catalysts at low temperatures (330350 K) consumed more than 20 million tons in 1994."
[2] "Applications of Ga-based zeolite catalysts are not very numerous, as can be seen from Table 24."
[3] "Ga-modified ZSM-5 mostly produces C5-C11 aliphatics."
[4] "Besides aliphatics, aromatics are detected among the products of reaction."
[5] "In any case, selectivity decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios."
[6] "Compared with Al-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities of C2C4 olefins, which is ascribed to their weaker acidity suppressing secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins."

1. In 1994, more than 20 million tons of gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were produced using acid-catalyzed equilibrium reactions of methanol and isobutene at low temperatures (330-350 K).

2. The use of gallium-based zeolite catalysts is not very widespread, as indicated by Table 24.

3. Gallium-modified ZSM-5 primarily produces aliphatic compounds with carbon chains ranging from C5 to C11.

4. Aromatics are also formed among the products of the reaction.

5. As the Si/Me ratio increases, selectivity generally decreases.

6. Gallium-modified ZSM-5 catalysts show higher selectivity for C2-C4 olefins compared to aluminum-modified ZSM-5 catalysts, attributed to their reduced acidity which inhibits secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins.

1. 1994年，通过在较低温度（330-350 K）下使用离子交换树脂催化剂催化甲醇和异丁烯的平衡反应，生产了超过2000万吨汽油添加剂甲基叔丁基醚（MTBE）。

2. 镓基沸石催化剂的应用并不广泛，如表24所示。

3. 镓改性ZSM-5主要产生从C5到C11碳链的烷烃化合物。

4. 反应产物中也检测到了芳香族化合物。

5. 当Si/Me比增加时，选择性通常会降低。

6. 与铝改性ZSM-5催化剂相比，镓改性ZSM-5催化剂显示出更高的C2-C4烯烃选择性，这归因于其较低的酸性，能够抑制中间烯烃的副反应。
