[1] "The conversion of methanol to olefins over zeolites has currently been reviewed by Froment et al."
[2] "Lalik et al. 545 used methanol conversion to dimethyl ether under mild conditions (T < 573 K) to check the Brnsted acidity of Al-free gallosilicates with various Si/Ga ratios (65.7, 51.6, 30.3, 24.6, 17.5) and a Ga-impregnated silicalite (Si/Ga = 19.8) as a reference."
[3] "In any case, selectivity decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios."
[4] "The authors gave no conversion data for methanol."
[5] "In the following years he extended his research on supported and nonsupported heteropoly acid catalysts."
[6] "The conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons on [Ga]-ZSM-5 was found to be remarkable even in samples where only 5% of the Na+ ions are replaced with H+, i.e., at very low exchange degrees."
[7] "The point of deactivation was defined as the reaction time at which the hydrocarbon production ceased and methanol was converted into DME only."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Froment et al. have reviewed the conversion of methanol to olefins using zeolites.
2. Lalik et al. examined the Brnsted acidity of Al-free gallosilicates with different Si/Ga ratios by converting methanol to dimethyl ether under mild conditions.
3. As the Si/Me ratio increases, the selectivity of the conversion decreases.
4. The authors did not provide data on the conversion of methanol.
5. Rolf Fricke expanded his research to include studies on supported and nonsupported heteropoly acid catalysts in subsequent years.
6. Even in samples with only 5% of Na+ ions replaced with H+, the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons on [Ga]-ZSM-5 was remarkable.
7. The point of deactivation was reached when the production of hydrocarbons stopped and methanol was solely converted into DME.

1. Froment等人已经审查了使用沸石将甲醇转化为烯烃。
2. Lalik等人通过在温和条件下将甲醇转化为二甲醚，检查了不同Si/Ga比的无铝高岭土型硅酸盐的Brnsted酸性。
3. 随着Si/Me比例的增加，转化的选择性会降低。
4. 作者没有提供关于甲醇转化的数据。
5. Rolf Fricke在接下来的几年里扩展了他的研究，包括支持和非支持的多酸催化剂的研究。
6. 即使只有5%的Na+离子被H+取代，在[Ga]-ZSM-5上甲醇转化为碳氢化合物也表现出显著的转化率。
7. 催化剂失活的点是在生产碳氢化合物停止，甲醇完全转化为DME时。
