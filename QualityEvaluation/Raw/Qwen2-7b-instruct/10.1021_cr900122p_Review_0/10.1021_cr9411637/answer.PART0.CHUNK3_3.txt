[1] "With the aromatization of propane, Price and Kanazirev454 observed very long induction periods (up to 24 h) for ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts."

[5] "Analyzing initial product selectivities, Kwak et al.458 found that the addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has no essential effect on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but increases the dehydrogenation rate 7.7-fold (T = 803 K)."

1. The aromatization of propane using ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts showed very long induction periods, typically up to 24 hours. However, pretreatment of the catalyst with hydrogen at elevated temperatures shortened the induction period and increased activity.
2. Thermal pretreatment of the catalysts facilitated the reduction of gallium species, which was anticipated to occur in the early stages of the catalytic reaction.
3. During the aromatization of propane, the attack of zeolitic protons produces intermediate C3H9+ carbonium ions that rearrange into C3H7+ and H2 or C2H5+ and CH4.
4. Kwak et al.'s study found that the addition of gallium to H-ZSM-5 catalysts had little impact on the rate of propane cracking but increased the dehydrogenation rate by 7.7 times at a temperature of 803 K.
5. Several authors consider the initial formation of carbenium ions as a key step in the propane aromatization process.
6. Nonframework gallium, in combination with hydrogen, acts as a dehydrogenating site in the reaction.
7. The concept of a bifunctional configuration of active sites, involving adjacent gallium species and acidic protons, needs to be revised due to the large distances involved in migrating gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite.
8. The conversion of propane and selectivity to aromatics showed an optimal performance when the ratio of gallium to the sum of gallium and hydrogen ions was between 0.4 and 0.5.

1. 使用β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5催化剂进行丙烷芳构化时，球磨催化剂的诱导期通常长达24小时。然而，通过在高温下对催化剂进行氢气预处理可以缩短诱导期并提高活性。
2. 催化剂的热预处理促进了镓物种的还原，这种还原预期会在催化反应的早期阶段发生。
3. 在丙烷芳构化过程中，由质子攻击产生的中间体C3H9+碳离子会重新排列为C3H7+和H2或C2H5+和CH4。
4. Kwak等人研究发现，将镓添加到H-ZSM-5催化剂中对丙烷裂解速率影响不大，但在803K温度下提高了脱氢速率7.7倍。
5. 多数作者认为初始形成碳正离子是丙烷芳构化过程的关键步骤。
6. 非框架镓与氢一起作为脱氢位点参与反应。
7. 由于需要跨越几微米的距离迁移镓分子从辅助催化剂到沸石，因此有必要修订关于活性位点双功能配置的概念，即相邻的镓物种和酸性质子。
8. 当镓与氢离子之和的比例在0.4到0.5之间时，丙烷的转化率和向芳香烃的选择性表现出最佳性能。
