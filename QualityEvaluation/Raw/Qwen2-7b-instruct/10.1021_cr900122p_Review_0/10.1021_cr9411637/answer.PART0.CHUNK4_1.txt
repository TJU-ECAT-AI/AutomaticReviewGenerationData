[1] "Methanol is a versatile basic chemical."
[2] "Its application as alkylating agent for the transformation of aromatics was described in section VI.B."
[3] "The production of the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) by the acid-catalyzed equilibrium reaction of methanol and isobutene over ion-exchange resin catalysts at low temperatures (330350 K) consumed more than 20 million tons in 1994."

1. Methanol is a versatile chemical with applications in alkylating agents for aromatic transformations. It is used to produce gasoline additives like methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE).

2. MTBE is created via an acid-catalyzed equilibrium reaction of methanol and isobutene at low temperatures (330-350 K) over ion-exchange resin catalysts. The production of MTBE exceeded 20 million tons in 1994.

1. 甲醇是一种多功能基本化学物质，用于芳香化合物的烷基化剂。它被用于生产汽油添加剂，如甲基叔丁基醚（MTBE）。

2. MTBE通过酸催化平衡反应产生，使用甲醇和异丁烯在低温（330-350 K）下与离子交换树脂催化剂作用。1994年的MTBE产量超过2000万吨。

[1] "In any case, selectivity decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios."
[2] "Compared with Al-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities of C2C4 olefins, which is ascribed to their weaker acidity suppressing secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
3. As the Si/Me ratio increases, selectivity decreases. Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts show higher selectivity for C2C4 olefins compared to Al-ZSM-5 catalysts. This is attributed to their reduced acidity, which suppresses secondary reactions of intermediate olefins.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
3. 当Si/Me比增加时，选择性会下降。Ga-ZSM-5催化剂对C2C4烯烃的选择性高于Al-ZSM-5催化剂。这归因于它们较低的酸性，可以抑制中间烯烃的副反应。

[1] "At 643 K, GHSV = 3600 h-1 and methanol concentration = 350%. The selectivity of C2C4 olefins is recorded to be dependent on the Me content."
[2] "Compared with Al-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities of C2C4 olefins, which is ascribed to their weaker acidity suppressing secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
4. At 643 K with a GHSV of 3600 h-1 and 350% methanol concentration, the selectivity of C2C4 olefins depends on the methanol content. Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts demonstrate higher selectivity for C2C4 olefins than Al-ZSM-5 catalysts, attributed to their reduced acidity that inhibits secondary reactions of intermediate olefins.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
4. 在643 K下，GHSV为3600 h-1，甲醇浓度为350%，C2C4烯烃的选择性取决于甲醇含量。与Al-ZSM-5催化剂相比，Ga-ZSM-5催化剂显示出更高的C2C4烯烃选择性，这是由于其较低的酸性抑制了中间烯烃的副反应。

[1] "In particular, the exchange of K+ ions within the erionite structure is not easy to accomplish."
[2] "Despite a rather broad spectrum of the strength of acid sites, Brnsted sites at the mordenite can be assumed to be the stronger ones."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
5. Within the erionite structure, exchanging K+ ions is particularly difficult. Despite the wide range of acid site strengths, Brnsted sites on mordenite are considered to be stronger.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
5. 在erionite结构内，交换K+离子尤其困难。尽管酸性位点强度范围广泛，但mordenite上的Brnsted位点被认为是更强的。
