1. In the reduction experiments conducted by Price and Kanazirev on Ga-modified ZSM-5 samples, the weight loss observed aligns with the proposed stoichiometry of reduction, indicating the fixation of Ga+ ions onto the anionic zeolite.

2. Inui et al. compared the catalytic performance of pure gallosilicates with varying Si/Ga ratios to Pt-modified H-forms, highlighting the role of Pt in enhancing the catalytic activity.

3. Over MFI and MEL ion-exchanged with Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+, a correlation was observed between the formation rates of N2 from NO and CO2 from various hydrocarbons, regardless of the specific hydrocarbon used.

4. Miyamoto et al.'s molecular modeling revealed that gallium species in ZSM-5 tend to migrate towards the T12 site, coordinating with a maximum of three Ga(OH)2+ ions near framework aluminum.

5. Himei et al. used advanced computational methods to model the adsorption and activation of methane at Ga3+-exchanged ZSM-5 catalysts, aiming to understand the CH4-based NOx reduction under lean conditions.

1. 在Price和Kanazirev对Ga改性ZSM-5样品进行的还原实验中，观察到的重量损失与作者早先提出的还原的化学计量学相吻合，表明Ga+离子固定在阴离子沸石上。

2. Inui等人比较了不同Si/Ga比的纯镓硅酸盐与Pt修饰的H型材料的催化性能，指出Pt可以增强催化活性。

3. 在用Co2+、Ni2+和Cu2+离子交换的MFI和MEL上，观察到从NO生成N2和从各种烃类生成CO2之间的相关性，无论具体使用的是哪种烃类。

4. Miyamoto等人通过分子建模发现，镓物种倾向于迁移到ZSM-5的T12位点，并与最多三个Ga(OH)2+离子协调在一起，这些离子靠近骨架铝。

5. Himei等人利用高级计算方法来模拟Ga3+-交换的ZSM-5催化剂上的甲烷吸附和激活，旨在理解在稀燃条件下基于甲烷的NOx减少。
