[1] "In the aromatization of alkanes/alkenes, gallium-substituted zeolites, particularly those of the MFI structure, are known to enhance dehydrogenation activity and increase the selectivity of aromatic components."
[2] "The Cyclar process, jointly developed by UOP and BP, uses a catalyst formulation described as a gallium-doped zeolite catalyst, which is ideal for forming aromatic rings."
[3] "Due to the high dispersion and stability of gallium species, gallium-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for the aromatization of hydrocarbons."

1. Gallium-substituted zeolites, especially those of the MFI structure, improve the dehydrogenation activity and increase the selectivity of aromatic components in the aromatization of alkanes/alkenes. 

2. The Cyclar process, developed by UOP and BP, utilizes a gallium-doped zeolite catalyst that facilitates the formation of aromatic rings in the aromatization of hydrocarbons.

3. Gallium-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for hydrocarbon aromatization due to the high dispersion and stability of gallium species within the zeolite structure.
