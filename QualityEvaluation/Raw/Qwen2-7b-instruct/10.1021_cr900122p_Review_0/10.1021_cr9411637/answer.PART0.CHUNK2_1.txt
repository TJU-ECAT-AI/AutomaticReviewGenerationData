The Cyclar process, developed jointly by UOP and BP, commercializes the aromatization of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) alkanes into aromatic components, primarily benzene, toluene, and xylenes, using gallium-modified ZSM-5 catalysts. Additionally, the one-step synthesis of phenol by catalytic hydroxylation of benzene with nitrous oxide can proceed over Ga-ZSM-5. Gallium in zeolites enhances dehydrogenation activity and increases the selectivity of aromatics. Gallium species located at/near cation positions in the zeolite lattice provide high dispersion and stability for the dispersed species.

由UOP和BP联合开发的Cyclar过程，商业化利用含镓改性的ZSM-5催化剂将液化石油气（LPG）烷烃转化为主要为苯、甲苯和二甲苯的芳烃成分。此外，通过催化羟基化，使用氮氧化物将苯合成酚的一步合成过程可在含镓的ZSM-5上进行。镓在沸石中的引入提高了脱氢活性并增加了芳烃的选择性。位于/接近笼子位置的镓物种在沸石晶格中提供高分散性和稳定性的分散物种。
