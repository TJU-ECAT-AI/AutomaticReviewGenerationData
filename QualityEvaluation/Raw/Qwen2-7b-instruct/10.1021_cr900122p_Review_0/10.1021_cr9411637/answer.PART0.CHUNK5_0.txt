The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as gallium (Ga), facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. These processes are crucial for the selective oxidation of alkanes. In the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the metal sites undergo oxidation states change, leading to the breaking of C-H bonds and the formation of alcohols. These alcohols further undergo oxidation to form aldehydes and ketones, which are then converted to maleic anhydride via dehydration. This transformation showcases the importance of metal sites in catalytic reactions.

孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上，如镓（Ga），通过Mars van Krevelen途径和H摘除等机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。这些过程对于烷烃的选择性氧化至关重要。在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，金属位点经历氧化态变化，导致C-H键断裂并形成醇类。这些醇进一步氧化为醛和酮，然后通过脱水转化为马来酸酐。这一转变展示了金属位点在催化反应中的重要性。
