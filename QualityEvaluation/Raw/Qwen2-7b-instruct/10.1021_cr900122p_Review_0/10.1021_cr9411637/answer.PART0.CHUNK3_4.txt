1. The activation of alkane molecules, particularly propane, in the process of converting them to aromatics requires the direct protonation of CC or CH bonds. This is a key step in initiating the conversion process.

2. The activation of propane and other alkanes in aromatization reactions involves a complex interplay between acid sites on the zeolite framework and non-framework gallium sites. This concerted action facilitates the activation of the alkane molecule.

3. The activation of propane specifically is believed to happen through a dual-function mechanism involving Ga3+O2- pairs and Brnsted acid sites on the zeolite, highlighting the importance of these specific sites in the catalytic process.

4. The reverse hydrogen spill-over phenomenon, which facilitates the desorption of hydrogen, plays a crucial role in accelerating the desorption process over Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts. This mechanism contributes to overcoming kinetic bottlenecks in the aromatization of alkanes.

5. The overall mechanism for propane aromatization over Ga-containing MFI zeolite catalysts, as outlined by Derouane et al., suggests multiple potential pathways for the activation of alkanes, including direct activation and pseudo-protonated cyclopropane activation.

6. Dehydrogenation of propane is a crucial step that leads to the formation of propene. This process results in the creation of a C3H7+ carbenium ion, which is a central intermediate in the conversion to aromatics.

7. An alternative activation pathway involves the direct activation of propane with an intermediate pseudo-protonated cyclopropane. This intermediate then decomposes, yielding carbenium ions that contribute to the final conversion to aromatics.
