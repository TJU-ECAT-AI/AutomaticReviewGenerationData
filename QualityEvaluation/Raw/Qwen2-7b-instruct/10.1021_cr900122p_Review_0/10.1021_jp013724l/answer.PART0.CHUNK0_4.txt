The calculations established the existence of a weak physisorbed complex of propane with a tricoordinated aluminum cluster, which is 4 kcal/mol more stable than the isolated reactants. The reaction pathways for both clusters 1 and 2 were identical. The transition structure for the chemisorption of propane on a tricoordinated aluminum cluster shows the migration of hydrogen from aluminum to oxygen, indicating metal ion catalysis rather than acid-base catalysis. The energy barrier for the elimination step is higher than the chemisorption step, suggesting that hydrogen exchange is faster than elimination. The alkylaluminum complexes are more stable than the alkyl-oxygen complexes, and the energy of the product, propene, includes a stabilizing interaction with the hydrogen molecule.

计算表明，与三配位铝簇形成的丙烷弱物理吸附复合物比孤立反应物稳定4 kcal/mol。两个簇1和2的反应途径相同。在三配位铝簇上丙烷化学吸附的过渡结构显示氢从铝迁移到氧，表明金属离子催化而非酸碱催化。消除步骤的能量壁垒高于吸附步骤，表明氢交换比消除更快。烷基铝复合物比烷基氧复合物更稳定，产物丙烯的能量包含与氢分子的稳定相互作用。

Answer: These calculations demonstrate that isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through metal ion catalysis, rather than acid-base catalysis, by inserting metal atoms into C-H bonds and undergoing subsequent hydrogen migration. The energy barriers for the elimination steps are higher than those for chemisorption, indicating that hydrogen exchange occurs more rapidly than elimination. The stability of alkylaluminum complexes is greater than that of alkyl-oxygen complexes, and the energy of the product, propene, includes a stabilizing interaction with the hydrogen molecule.

2. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a specific example of the application of these principles in industrial heterogeneous catalysis. By utilizing the metal ion catalysis mechanism uncovered in the document, the selective oxidation of butane can be efficiently achieved. The calculations predict that the relative reactivity of CH bonds decreases as the degree of substitution increases, which aligns with the observed selectivity in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This demonstrates how the principles of metal ion catalysis can be applied to achieve selective alkane activation and transformation in industrial settings.
