[1] "Mechanistically, our calculations show that the hydrogen exchange2,4,27,30 and elimination reactions25 of an alkane on materials containing Al(O)n sites, with n = 3 and 4, are examples of metal ion catalysis.7"
[2] "Alkane activation by solid acids, particularly zeolites, was described as involving hydron transfer to CH3a and CC bonds,3b the same as for the liquid superacids HClAlCl3 (or, rather, H2OAlCl3), 31 HFSbF5, 32 and HFTaF5. 33 It was, indeed, claimed that zeolites, among others, are solid superacids."
[3] "An increase in reactivity for broken lattices of zeolites and a role for extraframework aluminum species of steamed zeolites in hydrogen and alkane activation is predicted by this mechanism."
[4] "It follows that for mechanistic studies on zeolites, the rigorous and sensitive identification and quantification of extraframework aluminum species is essential."

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?
