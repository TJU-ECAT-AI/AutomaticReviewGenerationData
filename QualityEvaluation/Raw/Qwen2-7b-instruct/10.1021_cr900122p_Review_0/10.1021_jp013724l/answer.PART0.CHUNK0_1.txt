[1] "Mechanistically, our calculations show that the hydrogen exchange2,4,27,30 and elimination reactions25 of an alkane on materials containing Al(O)n sites, with n = 3 and 4, are examples of metal ion catalysis."
[2] "Alkane activation by solid acids, particularly zeolites, was described as involving hydron transfer to CH3a and CC bonds,3b the same as for the liquid superacids HClAlCl3 (or, rather, H2OAlCl3), HFSbF5, and HFTaF5."
[3] "An increase in reactivity for broken lattices of zeolites and a role for extraframework aluminum species of steamed zeolites in hydrogen and alkane activation is predicted by this mechanism."
[4] "The insertion of the metal ion into the CH bonds, predicted by the calculations, liberates the mechanistic model from such improbable acidbase reactions."
[5] "At high temperatures and low pressure, olefin products desorb from the catalyst. In experiments with the feed as liquid and at lower temperatures (120160 C), however, only saturated hydrocarbons were desorbed from the catalyst, as isomerization and disproportionation products, but they were formed entirely via olefinic intermediates."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, particularly aluminum, enable the activation of C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis. This is primarily through metal ion catalysis, where aluminum ions insert into the C-H bonds of alkanes. This mechanism differs from traditional acid-base catalysis, eliminating the need for hydron transfer. For alkane activation by solid acids like zeolites, the process is often described as involving hydron transfer to C-H and C-C bonds, akin to reactions with liquid superacids. However, computational studies suggest that aluminum's insertion into C-H bonds is a more plausible mechanism for alkane activation on materials containing Al(O)n sites, where n=3 or 4. This process predicts an increased reactivity for broken zeolite lattices and a role for extraframework aluminum species in steamed zeolites for hydrogen and alkane activation. At elevated temperatures, olefinic products desorb from the catalyst. In lower temperature experiments, saturated hydrocarbons and isomerization products are produced via olefinic intermediates, supporting the role of aluminum ion insertion in these catalytic processes.

在氧化物材料中的孤立金属中心，特别是铝，能够通过金属离子催化激活烷烃中的C-H键。这主要是通过金属离子插入C-H键的过程实现的，与传统的酸碱催化不同，消除了氢转移的需要。对于固体酸如沸石中烷基化的作用机制，通常描述为涉及向C-H和C-C键的氢转移，类似于液态超强酸的反应。然而，计算研究表明，铝离子插入C-H键可能是烷基化在含有Al(O)n（n=3或4）位点的材料上的更合理的机制。这个过程预测了断裂沸石晶格活性的增加，并且预测了蒸煮沸石中额外框架铝物种在氢气和烷基化激活中的作用。在高温低压下，烯烃产物从催化剂上脱附。在较低温度实验中，通过烯烃中间体产生的饱和碳氢化合物和异构化产物，支持了铝离子插入在这些催化过程中的作用。
