[1] "We noted, however, deficiencies in those calculations and conducted a computational study of the dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen on coordinatively unsaturated aluminum centers."
[2] "Thus, the reaction is better described as metal ion catalysis, rather than acid-base catalysis."
[3] "We noted that in the reaction of BuH-d10 with HZSM-5 at 400-550 C, HD exchange was at least 1 order of magnitude faster than dehydrogenation and cracking."
[4] "Indeed, this rate relationship was found in a study of the reaction of tritium gas with toluene and with hexane on three zeolites."
[5] "The calculations show that the hydrogen exchange with the catalyst has a much lower potential energy barrier than the elimination, for all clusters and for all types of CH bonds."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through metal ion catalysis rather than acid-base catalysis. This process involves inserting metal atoms or ions into C-H bonds. The hydrogen exchange with the catalyst has a much lower potential energy barrier than the elimination, indicating that hydrogen exchange is the fastest process. For example, in the reaction of BuH-d10 with HZSM-5 at 400-550°C, HD exchange was significantly faster than dehydrogenation and cracking. This principle is applied in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the catalyst enables efficient hydrogen exchange, leading to the desired product.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中通过金属离子催化作用促进C-H键活化，这与酸碱催化不同。该过程涉及将金属原子或离子插入C-H键中。催化剂上的氢交换具有比消除更低的势能壁垒，表明氢交换是最快的反应。例如，在BuH-d10与HZSM-5在400-550°C反应时，HD交换明显快于脱氢和裂解。这一原理应用于正丁烷转化为马来酸酐，催化剂使得有效的氢交换得以进行，从而得到所需的产品。
