[1] "Mechanistically, our calculations show that the hydrogen exchange2,4,27,30 and elimination reactions25 of an alkane on materials containing Al(O)n sites, with n = 3 and 4, are examples of metal ion catalysis.7"
[2] "Alkane activation by solid acids, particularly zeolites, was described as involving hydron transfer to CH3a and CC bonds,3b the same as for the liquid superacids HClAlCl3 (or, rather, H2OAlCl3), 31 HFSbF5, 32 and HFTaF5. 33 It was, indeed, claimed that zeolites, among others, are solid superacids."
[3] "An increase in reactivity for broken lattices of zeolites and a role for extraframework aluminum species of steamed zeolites in hydrogen and alkane activation is predicted by this mechanism."

[3] "An increase in reactivity for broken lattices of zeolites and a role for extraframework aluminum species of steamed zeolites in hydrogen and alkane activation is predicted by this mechanism."
[4] "The insertion of the metal ion into the CH bonds, predicted by the calculations, liberates the mechanistic model from such improbable acidbase reactions."
[5] "At high temperatures and low pressure, olefin products desorb from the catalyst. In experiments with the feed as liquid and at lower temperatures (120160 C), however, only saturated hydrocarbons were desorbed from the catalyst, as isomerization and disproportionation products, but they were formed entirely via olefinic intermediates."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, particularly aluminum, enable the activation of C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis. This is primarily through metal ion catalysis, where aluminum ions insert into the C-H bonds of alkanes. This mechanism differs from traditional acid-base catalysis, eliminating the need for hydron transfer. For alkane activation by solid acids like zeolites, the process is often described as involving hydron transfer to C-H and C-C bonds, akin to reactions with liquid superacids. However, computational studies suggest that aluminum's insertion into C-H bonds is a more plausible mechanism for alkane activation on materials containing Al(O)n sites, where n=3 or 4. This process predicts an increased reactivity for broken zeolite lattices and a role for extraframework aluminum species in steamed zeolites for hydrogen and alkane activation. At elevated temperatures, olefinic products desorb from the catalyst. In lower temperature experiments, saturated hydrocarbons and isomerization products are produced via olefinic intermediates, supporting the role of aluminum ion insertion in these catalytic processes.

在氧化物材料中的孤立金属中心，特别是铝，能够通过金属离子催化激活烷烃中的C-H键。这主要是通过金属离子插入C-H键的过程实现的，与传统的酸碱催化不同，消除了氢转移的需要。对于固体酸如沸石中烷基化的作用机制，通常描述为涉及向C-H和C-C键的氢转移，类似于液态超强酸的反应。然而，计算研究表明，铝离子插入C-H键可能是烷基化在含有Al(O)n（n=3或4）位点的材料上的更合理的机制。这个过程预测了断裂沸石晶格活性的增加，并且预测了蒸煮沸石中额外框架铝物种在氢气和烷基化激活中的作用。在高温低压下，烯烃产物从催化剂上脱附。在较低温度实验中，通过烯烃中间体产生的饱和碳氢化合物和异构化产物，支持了铝离子插入在这些催化过程中的作用。

1. Alkane activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials in heterogeneous catalysis typically involves mechanisms like metal insertion into C-H bonds, which contrasts with traditional models involving hydron transfer or H-abstraction. The process described in the document uses the insertion of metal atoms or ions into C-H bonds, which facilitates alkane activation.

2. In the context of the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the mechanism outlined in the document suggests a pathway where the C-H bonds in butane are activated through insertion of metal ions, followed by hydrogen migration to form an olefin intermediate. This olefin intermediate then undergoes a rearrangement to yield maleic anhydride. This mechanism differs from classical sigma bond acidolysis and carbocationic rearrangement, providing an alternative pathway for alkane activation in industrial selective oxidation processes.

3. The calculations indicate that the hydrogen exchange with the catalyst has a much lower potential energy barrier than the elimination, for all clusters and for all types of C-H bonds. This implies that hydrogen exchange is the fastest process, which aligns with experimental observations in the reaction of tritium gas with toluene and hexane on zeolites.

4. The document shows that the reactivity of primary and secondary C-H bonds is similar in propane and butane, suggesting that the size of the hydrocarbon chain has little effect on the relative reactivity of these bonds when interacting with coordinatively unsaturated aluminum sites. This insight is crucial for understanding the mechanism of alkane activation on materials containing Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4, which are examples of metal ion catalysis.

5. The calculations predict that alkane activation by solid acids, particularly zeolites, occurs through metal ion catalysis, rather than hydron transfer as previously suggested. This finding offers a new mechanistic framework for understanding the role of solid acids in alkane activation and highlights the importance of identifying extraframework aluminum species in zeolites for mechanistic studies.

1. 隔离金属中心在氧化物材料中的异相催化中通常通过金属插入C-H键的机制激活烷烃，这与传统的模型如氢转移或H提取不同。文档描述的过程使用金属原子或离子插入C-H键来促进烷烃激活。

2. 在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，所提出的机制表明，丁烷中的C-H键通过金属离子的插入激活，随后氢迁移到形成烯烃中间体。这个烯烃中间体然后经历重排生成马来酸酐。这一机制与经典的σ键酸解和碳正离子重排不同，提供了一种烷烃激活的替代途径，在工业选择性氧化过程中。

3. 计算表明，与催化剂的氢交换比消除过程具有更低的潜在能量壁垒，对于所有簇和所有类型的C-H键都是如此。这意味着氢交换是最快的进程，这与实验观察一致，即三氟甲磺酸在沸石上与对二甲苯和己烷的反应。

4. 文档显示，丙烷和丁烷中主链和次级C-H键的相对活性相似，表明当与Al(O)n站点上的配位不饱和铝中心相互作用时，碳氢链的长度对这些键的相对活性影响不大。这一见解对于理解Al(O)n站点（n=3和4）包含的固体酸在金属离子催化下激活烷烃的机制至关重要。

5. 计算预测，由固体酸（特别是沸石）激活的烷烃通过金属离子催化发生，而不是先前提出的氢转移。这一发现为理解固体酸在烷烃激活中的作用提供了一个新的机制框架，并强调了在沸石中识别额外框架铝物种对于机制研究的重要性。

The calculations established the existence of a weak physisorbed complex of propane with a tricoordinated aluminum cluster, which is 4 kcal/mol more stable than the isolated reactants. The reaction pathways for both clusters 1 and 2 were identical. The transition structure for the chemisorption of propane on a tricoordinated aluminum cluster shows the migration of hydrogen from aluminum to oxygen, indicating metal ion catalysis rather than acid-base catalysis. The energy barrier for the elimination step is higher than the chemisorption step, suggesting that hydrogen exchange is faster than elimination. The alkylaluminum complexes are more stable than the alkyl-oxygen complexes, and the energy of the product, propene, includes a stabilizing interaction with the hydrogen molecule.

Answer: These calculations demonstrate that isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through metal ion catalysis, rather than acid-base catalysis, by inserting metal atoms into C-H bonds and undergoing subsequent hydrogen migration. The energy barriers for the elimination steps are higher than those for chemisorption, indicating that hydrogen exchange occurs more rapidly than elimination. The stability of alkylaluminum complexes is greater than that of alkyl-oxygen complexes, and the energy of the product, propene, includes a stabilizing interaction with the hydrogen molecule.

2. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a specific example of the application of these principles in industrial heterogeneous catalysis. By utilizing the metal ion catalysis mechanism uncovered in the document, the selective oxidation of butane can be efficiently achieved. The calculations predict that the relative reactivity of CH bonds decreases as the degree of substitution increases, which aligns with the observed selectivity in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This demonstrates how the principles of metal ion catalysis can be applied to achieve selective alkane activation and transformation in industrial settings.
