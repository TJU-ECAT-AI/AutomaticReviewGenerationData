[1] "The acidic properties of Ga- and Zn-containing ZSM-5 play a crucial role in the conversion of lower alkanes into aromatic hydrocarbons."
[2] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis."
[3] "Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the substrate molecule to form a carbocation intermediate."
[4] "H-abstraction mechanism is also involved in the process, where hydrogen atoms are removed from the alkane molecule."
[5] "In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to convert butane into maleic anhydride."

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied industrially for the selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane into maleic anhydride.
