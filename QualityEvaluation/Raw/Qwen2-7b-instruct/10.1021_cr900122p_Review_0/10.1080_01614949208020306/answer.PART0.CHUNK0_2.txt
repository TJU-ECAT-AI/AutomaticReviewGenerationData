The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied industrially in the selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This process demonstrates the effectiveness of using ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts in industrial applications.
