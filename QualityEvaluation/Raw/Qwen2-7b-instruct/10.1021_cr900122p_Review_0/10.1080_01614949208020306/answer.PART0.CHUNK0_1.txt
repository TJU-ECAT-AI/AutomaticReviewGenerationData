Since the provided document does not contain specific information regarding the facilitation of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials, their involvement in mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, or their application in the selective oxidation of alkanes, particularly in the context of converting butane to maleic anhydride, it is impossible to answer the questions directly from the given text. Therefore, I am unable to provide answers to the questions based on the information provided.
