C-H bond activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSMS.

Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products.

Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).

Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propane conversion to propene.

The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.

Ga species have not exchanged during synthesis and remain as extracrystalline Ga2O3 or Ga2O.

The reduction of Ga species and the accompanying formation of protons during reaction above 573 K may be responsible for these contradictory results.

Hydrogen is also formed as a result of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface.

Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity.

Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brönsted acid sites.

Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products.

Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombination of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2).

The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn.

1. Metal cations in light alkane reactions catalyzed by modified H-ZSM5 mainly function to increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, thereby enhancing the rate and selectivity of alkane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions. 

2. Metal cations facilitate the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, and the presence of both acid sites and metal sites is required for the concerted reaction sequence involving C-C bond formation and cleavage, C-H bond activation, and hydrogen disposal.

3. The mechanism of propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5 involves a complex sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, followed by oligomerization and cracking reactions that establish an 'equilibrated' pool of alkene intermediates. Subsequently, these intermediates are converted into aromatic products through cyclization and aromatization pathways.

4. Metal cations, specifically Ga and Zn, increase the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibit cracking side reactions by facilitating hydrogen disposal.

5. The structure and function of metal cations in H-ZSM5 catalysts are influenced by their location within zeolite channels and their ability to migrate and interact with acid sites and unsaturated hydrocarbon fragments.

6. The experimental methods utilized for catalyst synthesis, elemental analysis, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy enable the characterization of metal species and their interaction with the zeolite framework.

7. Metal cations influence the reversibility of hydrogen adsorption/desorption steps by altering the surface hydrogen pool and affecting the communication between gas phase hydrogen and the surface hydrogen pool.

8. Acid sites play a crucial role in activating C-H bonds during propane reactions on H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5, whereas metal sites facilitate hydrogen desorption, particularly through the recombinative desorption of H-atoms.

9. Metal cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal during propane dehydrocyclodimerization by catalyzing the recombination of hydrogen atoms, thereby preventing the formation of unwanted by-products.

10. The synergy between metal cation and Brönsted acid sites enhances the efficiency of dehydrocyclodimerization reactions, enabling the completion of the reaction sequence with higher rates and selectivity.

11. The function of Ga and Zn cations during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5 is multifaceted, including accelerating the dehydrogenation of propane, increasing the rate of hydrogen disposal, and enhancing aromatic selectivity.

12. Metal cations impact the dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and hydrogen transfer properties of modified pentasil zeolites by altering the surface chemistry and reactivity.

13. The conclusions drawn from the study reveal that metal cations, especially Ga and Zn, significantly influence the structure and function of H-ZSM5 catalysts in light alkane reactions, enhancing selectivity and rate through the facilitation of hydrogen disposal and the synergistic interaction with acid sites.
