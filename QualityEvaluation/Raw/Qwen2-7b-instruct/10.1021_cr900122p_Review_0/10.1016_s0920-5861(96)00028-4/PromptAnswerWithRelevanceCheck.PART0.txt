How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as Ga and Zn species on H-ZSM5, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by acting as Lewis acids. These metal centers can abstract hydrogen atoms from carbon-hydrogen bonds, leading to the formation of carbonium ions or carbocations. This process is known as H-abstraction.

2. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of a surface species, such as a radical, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from an alkane molecule. This leads to the formation of an alkyl radical, which can then react further to produce various products.

3. In the context of the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the selective oxidation of alkanes is typically carried out under controlled conditions to ensure that only specific functional groups are modified. The presence of isolated metal centers helps in directing the reaction towards the desired product, maleic anhydride, by selectively activating the carbon-hydrogen bonds of butane that lead to the formation of this compound.

4. In this industrial application, the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride relies on the ability of the metal centers to selectively activate the carbon-hydrogen bonds in a way that avoids unwanted side reactions, such as cracking of the alkane or formation of other organic compounds. This is achieved by controlling factors such as temperature, pressure, and the concentration of the metal catalyst in the reaction mixture.

1. 在氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心，如H-ZSM5上的Ga和Zn物种，在异相催化中促进C-H键活化，通过作为Lewis酸的作用。这些金属中心可以从碳氢键中提取氢原子，导致碳离子或碳正离子的形成。这一过程称为氢提取。

2. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及形成表面物种，例如自由基，从中提取一个氢原子的烷烃分子。这导致形成烷基自由基，然后可以进一步反应产生各种产物。

3. 在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的具体例子中，烷烃的选择性氧化通常在控制条件下进行，以确保仅特定功能团被修改。存在的孤立金属中心有助于指导反应朝向所需产物马来酸酐的方向，通过选择性活化丁烷中的碳氢键来产生这种化合物。

4. 在此工业应用中，将丁烷转化为马来酸酐依赖于金属中心能够选择性地激活碳氢键的方式，避免不必要的副反应，如烷烃裂解或形成其他有机化合物。这是通过控制因素如温度、压力和反应混合物中金属催化剂的浓度来实现的。

What are the key differences in the structure and function of metal cations in light alkane reactions catalyzed by modified H-ZSM5?

</questions>

<quotes>

"The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics. Quasi-equilibrated acid-cata- lyzed cracking, oligomerization, and cyclization reactions of alkene intermediates occur in sequence with these dehydrogena- tion reactions."

"Catalytic tests were conducted dur- ing X-ray absorption measurements using an in-situ cell design previously described [52]. X-ray spectra include sharp increases in ab- sorbance at 10368 eV (Ga K-edge) or at 9659 eV (Zn K-edge), which arise from the ejection of Ga (or Zn) l s electrons."

"In effect, this step becomes even more irreversible (r_l/r 2 decreases) when Ga or Zn are intro- duced into H-ZSM5 catalysts, because required subsequent dehydrogenation reactions are more strongly influenced by these cations than the initial dehydrogenation reaction."

"The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid- catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C 3 + carbocations."

"Clearly, Ga and Zn species increase the re- versibility of H-atom recombinative desorption steps and act as efficient 'portholes' [67] for the removal of H-atoms produced during C-H bond activation steps."

C-H bond activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSMS.

Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products.

Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).

Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propane conversion to propene.

The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.

Ga species have not exchanged during synthesis and remain as extracrystalline Ga2O3 or Ga2O.

The reduction of Ga species and the accompanying formation of protons during reaction above 573 K may be responsible for these contradictory results.

Hydrogen is also formed as a result of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface.

Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity.

Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brönsted acid sites.

Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products.

Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombination of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2).

The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn.

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

</questions>

<quotes>
The beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation [16,26,28,29,33,35] or ion exchange techniques [15,18,22,23,32]. These effects are even observed when catalyst precursors consist of Ga203/H-ZSM5 physical mixtures [17,19- 21,23,36] or of gallosilicates containing Ga species within framework positions in the pen- tasil structure [56-58].

Ga species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).

In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover. These monomeric species form directly during exchange of Zn ions from solution onto H-ZSM5. Ga3+ species, however, do not exchange directly from solution onto H-ZSM5, but instead form extrazeolitic Ga203 crystals.

The introduction of Ga and Zn species to H-ZSM5 does not decrease the density of acid sites at reaction conditions, but leads to a displacement of protons by oxidized Ga complexes near room temperature. The reduction-oxidation of intrazeolitic Ga species has been confirmed by the X-ray absorption studies described in a previous report [26].

Hydrogen is also formed as a result of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface.

The isolated metal centers, particularly gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn), facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for hydrogen abstraction or insertion reactions. This process often follows the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, where a metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from a C-H bond, creating a carbocation intermediate. The Ga and Zn species in the zeolite catalysts act as these active sites, enabling the selective oxidation of alkanes.

In the context of converting butane to maleic anhydride, the Ga and Zn centers play a crucial role in the selective oxidation of butane. By facilitating the activation of C-H bonds in butane, these metal centers enable the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride with high efficiency. The metal centers help in the selective oxidation process by providing sites for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of carbocation intermediates that can then undergo further reactions to produce maleic anhydride. 

The Ga and Zn species in the catalysts are also responsible for enhancing the rate of hydrogen desorption and deuterium incorporation, which are key steps in the overall reaction sequence. The recombination of hydrogen atoms, often facilitated by the Ga and Zn centers, leads to the formation of dihydrogen (H2), which is a by-product of the catalytic process.

Moreover, the Ga and Zn centers increase the rate of chemical conversion and the overall efficiency of the conversion process by providing active sites for the reactions to occur. This is achieved through their ability to activate C-H bonds, which is essential for the selective oxidation of alkanes like butane to produce maleic anhydride. The enhanced activation of C-H bonds by Ga and Zn leads to faster and more efficient conversion of the alkane to the desired product, maleic anhydride.

The presence of Ga and Zn in the zeolite catalysts does not decrease the density of acid sites but rather displaces protons by oxidized Ga complexes, facilitating the activation of C-H bonds. This displacement of protons creates a more active environment for the oxidation reactions, further enhancing the catalytic activity of the system.

The recombination of hydrogen atoms on the surface of the catalyst, catalyzed by the Ga and Zn centers, plays a critical role in the overall process. This recombination leads to the formation of dihydrogen (H2), which can be utilized in the production of valuable chemical products, such as maleic anhydride, in industrial applications.

孤立的金属中心，特别是镓（Ga）和锌（Zn），通过提供从C-H键中抽象或插入氢原子的活性位点，在异相催化中促进C-H键活化。这个过程通常遵循马尔斯-范-克雷维尔机制，其中金属中心从C-H键中抽取氢原子，形成一个碳正离子中间体。Ga和Zn物种在催化剂中的作用作为这些活性位点，使烷烃的选择性氧化成为可能。

以将丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例，在这种情况下，Ga和Zn中心在选择性氧化丁烷的过程中起着关键作用。通过激活丁烷中的C-H键，这些金属中心能够高效地将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。金属中心通过提供氢提取位点，使丁烷的选择性氧化成为可能。

Ga和Zn物种在催化剂中的作用也促进了化学转化率和整体反应效率的提升。通过提供活性位点来激活C-H键，它们加速了烷烃到目标产物马来酸酐的转化过程。Ga和Zn的存在提高了C-H键的激活速率，从而加速了烷烃的转化，并产生了高效率的产品。

Ga和Zn的存在并没有降低酸位点的密度，而是通过氧化Ga复合物置换质子，促进了C-H键的激活。这种质子的置换在催化体系中创造了更活跃的环境，进一步增强了催化活性。

催化表面的氢原子再组合，由Ga和Zn中心催化，对整个过程至关重要。这种再组合导致了二氢（H2）的形成，这是催化过程中产生的有用副产品之一，在工业应用中可以用于生产有价值的化学产品，如马来酸酐。
