          "The beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation [16,26,28,29,33,35] or ion exchange techniques [15,18,22,23,32]. These effects are even observed when catalyst precursors consist of Ga203/H-ZSM5 physical mixtures [17,19- 21,23,36] or of gallosilicates containing Ga species within framework positions in the pen- tasil structure [56-58]."
          "Ga species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products."
          "Hydrogen is also formed as a result of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface."

          The introduction of gallium (Ga) into oxide materials, particularly through impregnation or ion exchange techniques, significantly enhances the rates of alkane aromatization and the selectivity of the conversion process. This improvement is evident in catalysts composed of Ga2O3 mixed with H-ZSM5 or in gallosilicates with Ga species within the penta-sil structure. Gallium facilitates the chemical conversion of propane, accelerates hydrogen desorption, and promotes the incorporation of deuterium from D2 into reaction products. Additionally, hydrogen is generated as a byproduct of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface.

          尤其通过浸渍或离子交换技术将镓（Ga）引入氧化物材料中，显著提高了烷烃芳香化速率和转化过程的选择性。这种改善在Ga2O3与H-ZSM5混合的催化剂或含有Ga物种的五硅结构中的gallosilicates中均能观察到。镓促进了丙烷的化学转化、加速了氢的再组合释放，并促进了从D2中吸附的氢气整合到反应产物中。此外，氢气还作为催化表面上吸附的氢气再组合释放的副产品被生成。

          "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products."
          "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."

          Gallium (Ga) and Zinc (Zn) species enhance the rates of propane chemical conversion, the process of hydrogen recombination, and the incorporation of deuterium from D2 into reaction products. After activation, the hydrogen atoms are transferred to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombination of hydrogen atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).

          镓（Ga）和锌（Zn）物种增加了丙烷化学转化的速率、氢原子再组合的过程以及从D2中整合到反应产物中的脱氘作用。激活后，氢原子被转移到不饱和物种形成烷烃，或者转移到Ga和Zn物种上，这些物种催化氢原子的再组合形成氢气（H2）。
