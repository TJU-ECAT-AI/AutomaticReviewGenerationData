How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

The beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation [16,26,28,29,33,35] or ion exchange techniques [15,18,22,23,32]. These effects are even observed when catalyst precursors consist of Ga203/H-ZSM5 physical mixtures [17,19- 21,23,36] or of gallosilicates containing Ga species within framework positions in the pen- tasil structure [56-58].

Ga species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).

In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover. These monomeric species form directly during exchange of Zn ions from solution onto H-ZSM5. Ga3+ species, however, do not exchange directly from solution onto H-ZSM5, but instead form extrazeolitic Ga203 crystals.

The introduction of Ga and Zn species to H-ZSM5 does not decrease the density of acid sites at reaction conditions, but leads to a displacement of protons by oxidized Ga complexes near room temperature. The reduction-oxidation of intrazeolitic Ga species has been confirmed by the X-ray absorption studies described in a previous report [26].

Hydrogen is also formed as a result of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface.

The isolated metal centers, particularly gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn), facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for hydrogen abstraction or insertion reactions. This process often follows the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, where a metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from a C-H bond, creating a carbocation intermediate. The Ga and Zn species in the zeolite catalysts act as these active sites, enabling the selective oxidation of alkanes.

In the context of converting butane to maleic anhydride, the Ga and Zn centers play a crucial role in the selective oxidation of butane. By facilitating the activation of C-H bonds in butane, these metal centers enable the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride with high efficiency. The metal centers help in the selective oxidation process by providing sites for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of carbocation intermediates that can then undergo further reactions to produce maleic anhydride. 

The Ga and Zn species in the catalysts are also responsible for enhancing the rate of hydrogen desorption and deuterium incorporation, which are key steps in the overall reaction sequence. The recombination of hydrogen atoms, often facilitated by the Ga and Zn centers, leads to the formation of dihydrogen (H2), which is a by-product of the catalytic process.

Moreover, the Ga and Zn centers increase the rate of chemical conversion and the overall efficiency of the conversion process by providing active sites for the reactions to occur. This is achieved through their ability to activate C-H bonds, which is essential for the selective oxidation of alkanes like butane to produce maleic anhydride. The enhanced activation of C-H bonds by Ga and Zn leads to faster and more efficient conversion of the alkane to the desired product, maleic anhydride.

The presence of Ga and Zn in the zeolite catalysts does not decrease the density of acid sites but rather displaces protons by oxidized Ga complexes, facilitating the activation of C-H bonds. This displacement of protons creates a more active environment for the oxidation reactions, further enhancing the catalytic activity of the system.

The recombination of hydrogen atoms on the surface of the catalyst, catalyzed by the Ga and Zn centers, plays a critical role in the overall process. This recombination leads to the formation of dihydrogen (H2), which can be utilized in the production of valuable chemical products, such as maleic anhydride, in industrial applications.

孤立的金属中心，特别是镓（Ga）和锌（Zn），通过提供从C-H键中抽象或插入氢原子的活性位点，在异相催化中促进C-H键活化。这个过程通常遵循马尔斯-范-克雷维尔机制，其中金属中心从C-H键中抽取氢原子，形成一个碳正离子中间体。Ga和Zn物种在催化剂中的作用作为这些活性位点，使烷烃的选择性氧化成为可能。

以将丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例，在这种情况下，Ga和Zn中心在选择性氧化丁烷的过程中起着关键作用。通过激活丁烷中的C-H键，这些金属中心能够高效地将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。金属中心通过提供氢提取位点，使丁烷的选择性氧化成为可能。

Ga和Zn物种在催化剂中的作用也促进了化学转化率和整体反应效率的提升。通过提供活性位点来激活C-H键，它们加速了烷烃到目标产物马来酸酐的转化过程。Ga和Zn的存在提高了C-H键的激活速率，从而加速了烷烃的转化，并产生了高效率的产品。

Ga和Zn的存在并没有降低酸位点的密度，而是通过氧化Ga复合物置换质子，促进了C-H键的激活。这种质子的置换在催化体系中创造了更活跃的环境，进一步增强了催化活性。

催化表面的氢原子再组合，由Ga和Zn中心催化，对整个过程至关重要。这种再组合导致了二氢（H2）的形成，这是催化过程中产生的有用副产品之一，在工业应用中可以用于生产有价值的化学产品，如马来酸酐。
