What mechanisms do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate for C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis?

</questions>

<quotes>
"Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, specifically gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn), facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by increasing the rates of chemical conversion, hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation into reaction products. This occurs through the transfer of hydrogen atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes, or to Ga and Zn species which catalyze the recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中，特别是镓（Ga）和锌（Zn），通过增加化学转化、氢脱附和从D2引入反应产物的脱氘作用，促进C-H键活化。这一过程通过将氢原子转移到不饱和物种形成烷烃，或催化Ga和Zn物种进行氢原子的重组合成氢气（H2）。
