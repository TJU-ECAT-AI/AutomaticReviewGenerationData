C-H activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5.
The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.
Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products.

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as Ga and Zn species on H-ZSM5, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by acting as Lewis acids. These metal centers can abstract hydrogen atoms from carbon-hydrogen bonds, leading to the formation of carbonium ions or carbocations. This process is known as H-abstraction.

2. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of a surface species, such as a radical, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from an alkane molecule. This leads to the formation of an alkyl radical, which can then react further to produce various products.

3. In the context of the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the selective oxidation of alkanes is typically carried out under controlled conditions to ensure that only specific functional groups are modified. The presence of isolated metal centers helps in directing the reaction towards the desired product, maleic anhydride, by selectively activating the carbon-hydrogen bonds of butane that lead to the formation of this compound.

4. In this industrial application, the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride relies on the ability of the metal centers to selectively activate the carbon-hydrogen bonds in a way that avoids unwanted side reactions, such as cracking of the alkane or formation of other organic compounds. This is achieved by controlling factors such as temperature, pressure, and the concentration of the metal catalyst in the reaction mixture.

1. 在氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心，如H-ZSM5上的Ga和Zn物种，在异相催化中促进C-H键活化，通过作为Lewis酸的作用。这些金属中心可以从碳氢键中提取氢原子，导致碳离子或碳正离子的形成。这一过程称为氢提取。

2. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及形成表面物种，例如自由基，从中提取一个氢原子的烷烃分子。这导致形成烷基自由基，然后可以进一步反应产生各种产物。

3. 在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的具体例子中，烷烃的选择性氧化通常在控制条件下进行，以确保仅特定功能团被修改。存在的孤立金属中心有助于指导反应朝向所需产物马来酸酐的方向，通过选择性活化丁烷中的碳氢键来产生这种化合物。

4. 在此工业应用中，将丁烷转化为马来酸酐依赖于金属中心能够选择性地激活碳氢键的方式，避免不必要的副反应，如烷烃裂解或形成其他有机化合物。这是通过控制因素如温度、压力和反应混合物中金属催化剂的浓度来实现的。
