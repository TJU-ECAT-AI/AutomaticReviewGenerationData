"The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics. Quasi-equilibrated acid-cata- lyzed cracking, oligomerization, and cyclization reactions of alkene intermediates occur in sequence with these dehydrogena- tion reactions."

"Catalytic tests were conducted dur- ing X-ray absorption measurements using an in-situ cell design previously described [52]. X-ray spectra include sharp increases in ab- sorbance at 10368 eV (Ga K-edge) or at 9659 eV (Zn K-edge), which arise from the ejection of Ga (or Zn) l s electrons."

"In effect, this step becomes even more irreversible (r_l/r 2 decreases) when Ga or Zn are intro- duced into H-ZSM5 catalysts, because required subsequent dehydrogenation reactions are more strongly influenced by these cations than the initial dehydrogenation reaction."

"The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid- catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C 3 + carbocations."

"Clearly, Ga and Zn species increase the re- versibility of H-atom recombinative desorption steps and act as efficient 'portholes' [67] for the removal of H-atoms produced during C-H bond activation steps."

Metal cations in light alkane reactions catalyzed by modified H-ZSM5 exhibit differences in structure and function that impact the catalytic process. Key differences include:

1. The catalysis of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tifacts, and aromatics, with a sequence of quasi-equilibrated acid-catalyzed cracking, oligomerization, and cyclization reactions accompanying these dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The X-ray absorption spectra show clear evidence of Ga and Zn cations in the H-ZSM5 catalyst, indicating their presence and potential roles in the catalytic process.

3. The introduction of Ga or Zn into the H-ZSM5 catalyst increases the reversibility of hydrogen adsorption/desorption steps, enhancing the efficiency of hydrogen removal processes.

4. Propene is formed from dehydrogenation of propane, which then undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions, including oligomerization and addition to C 3 + carbocations.

5. The presence of Ga and Zn species facilitates the recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms, acting as efficient 'portholes' for hydrogen removal, thereby influencing the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of the reactions.
