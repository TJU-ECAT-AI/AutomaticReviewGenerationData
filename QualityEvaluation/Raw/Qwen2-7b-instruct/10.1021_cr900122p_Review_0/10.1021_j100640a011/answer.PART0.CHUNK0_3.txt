The nature of molecular hydrogen adsorbed on zinc oxide has been studied by examining its isotherms, which show a significant isotope effect, and by observing its presence in molecular form with isosteric heats at low coverage of 2.2-2.5 kcal. The infrared studies and temperature-pressure dependence indicate that this hydrogen is limited to 5 to 10% of the surface. Poisoning studies with water suggest it occurs on the same sites as the dissociative type I hydrogen. The spectral results and isotope effect suggest there is a considerable barrier to rotation on the surface. This molecular hydrogen could play a role in the ortho-para hydrogen conversion.

在锌氧化物上吸附的分子氢的性质通过检查其等温线进行了研究，这些等温线显示出明显的同位素效应，并且表明这种氢在低覆盖度（约2.2-2.5 kcal）下以分子形式存在，且占表面的5到10%。水污染实验表明，它发生在与离解型I氢相同的位点上。光谱结果和同位素效应表明表面旋转存在显著的障碍。这种分子氢可能在正交-顺式氢转换中发挥作用。

The nature of molecular hydrogen adsorbed on zinc oxide has been characterized through adsorption and infrared techniques. The isotherms exhibit a significant isotope effect and yield isosteric heats at low coverage of 2.2-2.5 kcal. Infrared studies and the temperature-pressure dependence indicate that this hydrogen is present in molecular form and is limited to 5 to 10% of the surface. Water poisoning studies suggest it occurs on the same sites as the dissociative type I hydrogen. Interpretation of the spectral results and the isotope effect suggest that there is a considerable barrier to rotation on the surface. The role of such a species in the ortho-para hydrogen conversion is discussed.

在锌氧化物上吸附的分子氢的性质通过吸附和红外技术进行了描述。等温曲线显示了明显的同位素效应，并在低覆盖率（约2.2-2.5 kcal）下给出了等焓值。红外研究和温度压力依赖性表明，这种氢以分子形式存在，仅占表面的5到10%。水污染研究表明，它发生在与离解型I氢相同的位点上。对光谱结果和同位素效应的解释表明，表面上旋转存在显著的障碍。讨论了这种物种在正交-顺式氢转换中的作用。
