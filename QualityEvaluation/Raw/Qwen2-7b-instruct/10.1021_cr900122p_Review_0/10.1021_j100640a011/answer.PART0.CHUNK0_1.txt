[1] "Heterogeneous catalysts that are effective for hydrogen- ation reactions usually are also effective for hydrogen- deuterium exchange (and the related parahydrogen con- version) The nature of the "activated" hydrogen in these catalytic sequences has been the subject of much peculation."
[2] "Often, it is assumed that this reactive molecular hydrogen species is weakly adsorbed."
[3] "At present, it is not clear whether the "active" form of hydrogen is only atomic or includes a molecular species."
[4] "The nature of adsorbed hydrogen has also been exam- ined by a number of nonmechanistic techniques. Infrared studies provide the strongest evidence that hydrogen ad- sorption on at least some metalsSJ0 and oxides11 is atom- ic."
[5] "Recently,analysis of chromatographic separation of hydrogen iso- topes and allotropes strongly suggests there is a specific form of molecular hydrogen adsorption on oxides."
[6] "This view is reinforced by recent observations in this labo- ratory of ir bands due to molecular species when hydrogen is adsorbed on zinc oxide at low temperature."
[7] "The nature of molecular hydrogen adsorbed on zinc oxide at -195 and -183" (type 1 1 1 ) has been examined by adsorption and ir techniques."
[8] "The isosteric heats of adsorp- tion for hydrogen and deuterium were computed from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation."
[9] "In order to study it we must first devise a way to separate it from the type I adsorption which also occurs readily at these low temperatures."
[10] "These bands, together with the corresponding type I bands, are also observed when the catalyst is precooled to - 195" in helium, then evacuated, and exposed to hydro- gen (or deuterium)."
[11] "The bands for molecular adsorption on zinc oxide are quite different from those assigned to "physical adsorp- tion" on porous glass."
[12] "The interaction of hydrogen with zinc oxide is greater than with porous glass."
[13] "The nature of the molecular hydrogen (gauged by ir) appears to be highly specific to the adsorbent, zinc oxide, and, in that sense, it is chemisorptin."
[14] "The adsorption characteristics of the molecular species (termed type 1 1 1 ) responsible for the ir spectra, we must devise a scheme for subtracting out the physical adsorption contributions to the vo,lumetric iso- therms in Figure 1."
[15] "Contributions of physical adsorption should be most pronounced at higher pressures and should occur with heats of adsorption more comparable to the heat of liquefaction (0.216 kcal/moll7) than the initial heats, characteristic of type 111 hydrogen."
[16] "At higher coverages, where additional adsorption is largely physical, I11 should become independent of total coverage."
[17] "In order to specify the adsorption characteristics of the molecular species (termed type 1 1 1 ) responsible for the ir spectra, we must devise a scheme for subtracting out the physical adsorption contributions to the vo,lumetric iso- therms in Figure 1."
[18] "Contributions of physical adsorption should be most pronounced at higher pressures and should occur with heats of adsorption more comparable to the heat of liquefaction (0.216 kcal/moll7) than the initial heats, characteristic of type 111 hydrogen."
[19] "At higher coverages, where additional adsorption is largely physical, I11 should become independent of total coverage."
[20] "Effects of water adsorption on the hydrogen spectrum support this interpretation."
[21] "EarlierZ0 it was demonstrated that water adsorption selectively poisons the sites for type I adsorption."
[22] "In our present study we have found that if sufficient water is adsorbed so that type I bands do not appear on exposure to hydrogen, type I11 bands are also absent."
[23] "When the adsorbed water is re- moved in stages by evacuation at successively higher tem- peratures, the catalyst can be reactivated for both type I and type I11 hydrogen adsorption."
[24] "Observation of the ir spectra in hydrogen during successive stages of the reacti- vation reveal that type I and type I11 bands both reappear and show a parallel growth in intensity at successive stag- es of the reactivation."

The literature discusses the nature of molecular hydrogen adsorbed on zinc oxide, focusing on its isotope effect, infrared spectroscopy, and adsorption isotherms. The authors suggest that molecular hydrogen adsorption on zinc oxide is distinct from physical adsorption on porous glass, with a stronger interaction. They propose that this molecular hydrogen is chemisorbed, indicating a specific site on zinc oxide. The literature also explores the possibility that this molecular hydrogen could play a role in ortho-para hydrogen conversion, potentially serving as an intermediate species. The authors use adsorption and infrared spectroscopy to characterize the adsorbed hydrogen, identifying a significant isotope effect and suggesting that the hydrogen is present in molecular form, albeit at low concentration on the surface. They also discuss the barrier to rotation on the surface, which influences the vibrational transitions observed in the infrared spectrum. This barrier contributes to the specificity of molecular hydrogen adsorption on zinc oxide and may affect the ortho-para conversion process.

文献讨论了锌氧化物上吸附的分子氢的性质，重点是同位素效应、红外光谱和吸附等温线。作者认为锌氧化物上的分子氢与多孔玻璃上的物理吸附有明显区别，与锌氧化物之间的相互作用更强。他们提出这种分子氢是化学吸附的，表明它在锌氧化物上有特定的吸附位点。文献还探讨了分子氢在锌氧化物上作为中间体参与正交-顺氢转换的可能性。通过吸附和红外光谱法，作者表征了吸附的氢气，发现了显著的同位素效应，并指出氢气以分子形式存在，但表面浓度较低。他们还讨论了表面旋转的障碍，这影响了红外光谱中观察到的振动跃迁。这个障碍有助于理解锌氧化物上分子氢的特异性吸附，并可能影响正交-顺氢转换过程。
