The literature discusses the nature of molecular hydrogen adsorbed on zinc oxide, focusing on its isotope effect, infrared spectroscopy, and adsorption isotherms. The authors suggest that molecular hydrogen adsorption on zinc oxide is distinct from physical adsorption on porous glass, with a stronger interaction. They propose that this molecular hydrogen is chemisorbed, indicating a specific site on zinc oxide. The literature also explores the possibility that this molecular hydrogen could play a role in ortho-para hydrogen conversion, potentially serving as an intermediate species. The authors use adsorption and infrared spectroscopy to characterize the adsorbed hydrogen, identifying a significant isotope effect and suggesting that the hydrogen is present in molecular form, albeit at low concentration on the surface. They also discuss the barrier to rotation on the surface, which influences the vibrational transitions observed in the infrared spectrum. This barrier contributes to the specificity of molecular hydrogen adsorption on zinc oxide and may affect the ortho-para conversion process.

(1) "The reversibly adsorbed hydrogen and deuterium on zinc oxide at -195 and -183" (type 1 1 1 ) has been examined by adsorption and ir techniques. The isotherms show a significant isotope effect and yield isosteric heats at low coverage of 2.2-2.5 kcal. Infrared studies and the temperature and pressure dependence show this hydrogen is present in molecular form and is limited to 5 to 10% of the surface."
(2) "Infrared studies provide the strongest evidence that hydrogen ad- sorption on at least some metalsSJ0 and oxides11 is atom- ic."
(3) "The amount of adsorption is extensive insofar as it approaches half the nitrogen V, value at 1 atm and -195"."
(4) "The isotope effect is also reflected in isosteric heats shown in Figure 2. Values for both hydrogen and deuterium approach a common value at high coverage, but at low coverage, the value is about 2.2 kcal for hydrogen compared to 2.5 kcal for deu- terium."
(5) "In a recent paper from this laboratoryz1 it was noted that the ratio of pressures for different isotopes at fixed 6 should be represented by the formula where Q is the partition function for the indicated gaseous species and q is the partition function for the indicated adsorbed species (including zero point energies) at zero coverage."

(8) "The adsorption measurements were made on a 23.0-g sample of zinc oxide pressed into disks similar to those used in ir studies and broken into large chunks."

The nature of molecular hydrogen adsorbed on zinc oxide was investigated using adsorption and infrared (IR) techniques. The adsorption isotherms showed a significant isotope effect and yielded isosteric heats of 2.2-2.5 kcal at low coverage. IR studies and temperature-pressure dependence revealed that this hydrogen is present in a molecular form, occupying approximately 5 to 10% of the surface. The isotope effect was confirmed by the ratio of pressures for different isotopes, which was calculated using the partition function formula. The adsorption measurements were conducted on a zinc oxide sample prepared similarly to those used for IR studies. Type I hydrogen is reactive and forms ZnH and OH bonds by dissociation on a limited number of zinc oxide sites, while type I1 hydrogen is unreactive in certain reactions like ethylene hydrogenation and hydrogen-deuterium exchange.
