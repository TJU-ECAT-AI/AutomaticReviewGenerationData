<question>
How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document does not provide information about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, the mechanisms involved, or their application in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the provided document.

文档没有提供关于孤立金属中心在异相催化中促进C-H键活化、涉及的机制（如火星-克雷韦伦机制和氢摘取）以及在工业选择性烷烃氧化中的应用的信息。因此，我无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。
