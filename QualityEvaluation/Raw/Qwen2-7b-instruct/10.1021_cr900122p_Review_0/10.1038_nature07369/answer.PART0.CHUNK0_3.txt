[1] "Recent progress clearly indicates that the latter was true."
[2] "Much recent effort has been focused on reactions that form Cheteroatom bonds using olefins as reagents."
[3] "Several types of catalyst for the oxidations and oxidative aminations of olefins through organometallic intermediates have been shown recently to react through yet another set of elementary reactions of alkoxo and amido complexes, paralleling the reactions of alkyl complexes."
[4] "These reactions are olefin insertions into MN and MO bonds, and catalytic reactions that involve this class of elementary reaction include the following: palladium-catalysed oxidations of olefins to form alde- hydes, vinyl ethers and vinyl acetates; related oxidative aminations to form enamides; and hydroaminations of alkenes to form alkylamines."
[5] "Other catalysts for the hydroamination of alkenes have been shown to react through organometallic amido intermediates generated by [2 + 2] cycloadditions between imido complexes and alkenes."
