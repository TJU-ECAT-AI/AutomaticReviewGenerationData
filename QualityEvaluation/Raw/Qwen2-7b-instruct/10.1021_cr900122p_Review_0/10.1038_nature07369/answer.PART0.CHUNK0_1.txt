How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
There are no direct quotes in the provided document that discuss the role of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, the specific mechanisms involved such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, or their application in industrial selective oxidation processes, particularly the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. 

The document focuses on organometallic complexes and their reactions forming CC and CH bonds, including cross-coupling, hydrogenations, and functionalizations of CH bonds, but does not delve into heterogeneous catalysis or the specifics of butane to maleic anhydride conversion.
