[1] "The exchange of alkanes and alkenes with deuterium on magnesium oxide appears to involve intermediates with carbanionic character similar to those found for alumina."
[2] "We wished to know if such a similarity in behaviour would be observed when alkylbenzenes were used."
[3] "There seems to be some parallel between magnesium oxide and titanium dioxide (rutile) for reactions of propene and toluene, although titanium dioxide is a much less active catalyst."
[4] "However, the work has established a number of significant differences between magnesium oxide and y-alumina for reactions involving aromatic molecules."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as magnesium oxide, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. Despite similarities observed with alumina, magnesium oxide exhibits distinct behaviors in reactions with aromatic molecules compared to y-alumina. Notably, magnesium oxide is an effective catalyst for intermolecular reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as propene and toluene, indicating its capability to mediate intermolecular exchange processes.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中，如镁氧化物，通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象等机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。这些原则被应用于工业选择性氧化烷烃，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例。尽管与氧化铝存在相似之处，镁氧化物在芳香分子反应中的行为与氧化铝有显著差异。值得注意的是，镁氧化物是丙烯和苯乙烯等不饱和烃间分子反应的有效催化剂，表明其能够介导分子间交换过程。
