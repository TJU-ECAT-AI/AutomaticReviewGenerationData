[1] "Some hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions of benzene and alkylbenzenes on y-alumina and magnesium oxide have been investigated."
[2] "The exchange of alkanes and alkenes with deuterium on magnesium oxide appears to involve intermediates with carbanionic character similar to those found for alumina."
[3] "We also wished to know whether the linear relationship between the ease of exchange of hydrocarbons and their acidity found for alkanes 5 9 and probably applicable to alkenes 6 could be extended to include the reactions of aromatic compounds."
[4] "In contrast to the behaviour of alumina, steady poisoning of magnesium oxide was apparent during some experiments, and was particularly severe at temperatures above 350 K."
[5] "The close agreement between the observed rate of exchange of the latter molecule and that predicted by the acidity of the hydrogens suggests that such drastic electronic distortion of the n-system does not in fact occur."
[6] "Magnesium oxide appears to be an effective catalyst for intermolecular reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons."

The investigation focused on hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions of benzene and alkylbenzenes on y-alumina and magnesium oxide. It was found that the exchange of alkanes and alkenes on magnesium oxide involves intermediates with carbanionic character similar to those on alumina. Researchers aimed to determine if the linear relationship between hydrocarbon exchange ease and acidity, known for alkanes and alkenes, could extend to aromatic compounds. Contrary to alumina, magnesium oxide showed signs of steady poisoning at temperatures above 350 K. The observed rate of exchange for benzene matched predictions based on hydrogen acidity, suggesting minimal distortion of the n-system. Magnesium oxide proved effective for intermolecular reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

研究重点是苯和烷基苯在y氧化铝和镁氧化物上的氢氘交换反应。发现烷烃和烯烃在镁氧化物上的交换涉及与铝氧化物中发现的具有碳负离子特性的中间体相似的中间体。研究人员试图确定如果酸性线性关系，对于已知适用于烷烃和烯烃的烷烃和烯烃，是否可以扩展到芳香族化合物。与铝氧化物不同，镁氧化物在350 K以上的温度下显示出明显的中毒现象。观察到的苯交换速率与基于氢酸性的预测相匹配，这表明n系统的严重扭曲实际上并未发生。镁氧化物证明了不饱和烃的分子间反应的有效催化剂。

5. The ease of replacing hydrogen atoms in alkanes and cycloalkanes with deuterium on y-alumina is determined by their acidity.

6. The high acidity of toluene's methyl hydrogens stems from the benzyl carbanion's stabilization due to the delocalization of the negative charge across the ring system.

7. The rate-determining step in the intermolecular transfer of deuterium involves the cleavage of a carbon-hydrogen bond in the side group.

8. There exists a likeness between magnesium oxide and titanium dioxide (rutile) for propene and toluene reactions, with magnesium oxide showing greater reactivity.

9. The exchange of toluene with C6D6 happens at a faster rate than with deuterium, indicating slower deuterium adsorption-desorption processes in the presence of aromatic molecules.

1. The rate and activation energy for benzene's exchange with D2 in this study are nearly identical to those reported by Saunders and Hightower.

2. The elevated acidity of toluene's methyl hydrogens can be attributed to the substantial stabilization of the benzyl carbanion, thanks to the delocalization of the negative charge on the alpha-carbon atom within the ring structure.

3. The exchange of alkanes and alkenes with deuterium on magnesium oxide seems to involve intermediate forms with carbanionic characteristics akin to those observed in alumina.

4. The swift redistribution of deuterium in C6H5.CD3 suggests that the slow exchange of toluene's methyl hydrogens with deuterium from either D2 or heavy benzene likely occurs via an intermolecular transfer of deuterium from the more easily replaced ring positions.

5. Magnesium oxide exhibits effectiveness as a catalyst for intermolecular reactions involving unsaturated hydrocarbons.

1. 在这项研究中，苯与D2的交换速率和活化能与Saunders和Hightower报告的数据非常接近。

2. 对于对二甲苯的甲基氢较高的酸性可以归因于环结构中α-碳原子上的负电荷通过环系统进行去孤立化所赋予的苯基碳正离子的显著稳定化。

3. 在镁氧化物上，烷烃和烯烃与氘的交换似乎涉及与铝氧化物中发现的具有相似特征的碳负离子中间体。

4. 对于C6H5.CD3中氘的重新分配速率足够高，这表明对二甲苯的甲基氢从D2或重苯中缓慢交换可能通过从更易替换的环位置进行氘的分子内转移而发生。

5. 镁氧化物对于不饱和烃的分子间反应表现出良好的催化活性。

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as magnesium oxide, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. Despite similarities observed with alumina, magnesium oxide exhibits distinct behaviors in reactions with aromatic molecules compared to y-alumina. Notably, magnesium oxide is an effective catalyst for intermolecular reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as propene and toluene, indicating its capability to mediate intermolecular exchange processes.

The document discusses the investigation of hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions of benzene and toluene on aluminum oxide (y-alumina) and magnesium oxide. These reactions are studied for understanding the catalytic properties of metal oxide catalysts. The document explores cross-exchange between different hydrocarbons, intermolecular redistribution of deuterium, and the use of magnesium oxide for similar reactions. It also notes that the exchange reactions of alkanes and alkenes on magnesium oxide involve intermediates with carbanionic character similar to those found for aluminum oxide. The document aims to understand the mechanisms behind these exchange reactions and compares the behavior of alkylbenzenes on these different catalysts. Previous research has focused on the characterization of metal oxide catalysts through the study of exchange reactions, and the current work uses aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide as catalysts for these reactions.
