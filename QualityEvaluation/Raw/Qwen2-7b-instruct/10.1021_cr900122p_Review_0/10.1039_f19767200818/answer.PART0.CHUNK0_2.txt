[1] "The rate and activation energy of exchange for benzene with D2 found in this work are very close to those reported by Saunders and Hightwer."
[2] "The high acidity associated with the methyl hydrogens of toluene is attributable to the considerable stabilization of the benzyl carbanion afforded by the delocalization of the negative charge on the a-carbon atom through the n-system of the ring."
[3] "The exchange of alkanes and alkenes with deuterium on magnesium oxide appears to involve intermediates with carbanionic character similar to those found for alumina."
[4] "The rate of redistribution of deuterium in C6H5.CD3 is sufficiently high to indicate that the slow exchange of the methyl hydrogens of toluene with deuterium from either D2 or heavy benzene probably occurs via an intermolecular transfer of deuterium from the more readily replaced ring positions."
[5] "Magnesium oxide appears to be an effective catalyst for intermolecular reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons."

1. The rate and activation energy for benzene's exchange with D2 in this study are nearly identical to those reported by Saunders and Hightower.

2. The elevated acidity of toluene's methyl hydrogens can be attributed to the substantial stabilization of the benzyl carbanion, thanks to the delocalization of the negative charge on the alpha-carbon atom within the ring structure.

3. The exchange of alkanes and alkenes with deuterium on magnesium oxide seems to involve intermediate forms with carbanionic characteristics akin to those observed in alumina.

4. The swift redistribution of deuterium in C6H5.CD3 suggests that the slow exchange of toluene's methyl hydrogens with deuterium from either D2 or heavy benzene likely occurs via an intermolecular transfer of deuterium from the more easily replaced ring positions.

5. Magnesium oxide exhibits effectiveness as a catalyst for intermolecular reactions involving unsaturated hydrocarbons.

1. 在这项研究中，苯与D2的交换速率和活化能与Saunders和Hightower报告的数据非常接近。

2. 对于对二甲苯的甲基氢较高的酸性可以归因于环结构中α-碳原子上的负电荷通过环系统进行去孤立化所赋予的苯基碳正离子的显著稳定化。

3. 在镁氧化物上，烷烃和烯烃与氘的交换似乎涉及与铝氧化物中发现的具有相似特征的碳负离子中间体。

4. 对于C6H5.CD3中氘的重新分配速率足够高，这表明对二甲苯的甲基氢从D2或重苯中缓慢交换可能通过从更易替换的环位置进行氘的分子内转移而发生。

5. 镁氧化物对于不饱和烃的分子间反应表现出良好的催化活性。
