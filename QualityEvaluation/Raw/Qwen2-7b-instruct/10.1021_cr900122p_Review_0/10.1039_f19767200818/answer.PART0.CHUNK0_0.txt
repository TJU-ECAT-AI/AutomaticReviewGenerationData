[1] "Some hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions of benzene and alkylbenzenes on y-alumina and magnesium oxide have been investigated."
[2] "The exchange of alkanes and alkenes with deuterium on magnesium oxide appears to involve intermediates with carbanionic character similar to those found for alumina."
[3] "We also wished to know whether the linear relationship between the ease of exchange of hydrocarbons and their acidity found for alkanes 5 9 and probably applicable to alkenes 6 could be extended to include the reactions of aromatic compounds."
[4] "In contrast to the behaviour of alumina, steady poisoning of magnesium oxide was apparent during some experiments, and was particularly severe at temperatures above 350 K."
[5] "The close agreement between the observed rate of exchange of the latter molecule and that predicted by the acidity of the hydrogens suggests that such drastic electronic distortion of the n-system does not in fact occur."
[6] "Magnesium oxide appears to be an effective catalyst for intermolecular reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons."

The investigation focused on hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions of benzene and alkylbenzenes on y-alumina and magnesium oxide. It was found that the exchange of alkanes and alkenes on magnesium oxide involves intermediates with carbanionic character similar to those on alumina. Researchers aimed to determine if the linear relationship between hydrocarbon exchange ease and acidity, known for alkanes and alkenes, could extend to aromatic compounds. Contrary to alumina, magnesium oxide showed signs of steady poisoning at temperatures above 350 K. The observed rate of exchange for benzene matched predictions based on hydrogen acidity, suggesting minimal distortion of the n-system. Magnesium oxide proved effective for intermolecular reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

研究重点是苯和烷基苯在y氧化铝和镁氧化物上的氢氘交换反应。发现烷烃和烯烃在镁氧化物上的交换涉及与铝氧化物中发现的具有碳负离子特性的中间体相似的中间体。研究人员试图确定如果酸性线性关系，对于已知适用于烷烃和烯烃的烷烃和烯烃，是否可以扩展到芳香族化合物。与铝氧化物不同，镁氧化物在350 K以上的温度下显示出明显的中毒现象。观察到的苯交换速率与基于氢酸性的预测相匹配，这表明n系统的严重扭曲实际上并未发生。镁氧化物证明了不饱和烃的分子间反应的有效催化剂。
