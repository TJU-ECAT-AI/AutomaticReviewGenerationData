[1] "This structure sensitivity may be related to the need for a reason- ably large ensemble of metal atoms in order for the reaction to occur: the adsorption of ethylene and acetylene involves a minimum of four and two surface nickel atoms, respetively,3J and each extra hyd- rogen requires one hollow site with another three Ni atoms."
[2] "Recent structural experiments suggest that the two hydrogen atoms could be lost simultaneously from the ethylene molecule in a concerted step, either via cis elimination with trans- lation of the molecule to a new adsorption site, or by trans elimination and rotation around the symmetry axis of the molecule along the surface"

1. Metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by requiring a large ensemble of metal atoms for reactions to occur. The adsorption of ethylene and acetylene necessitates a minimum of four and two surface nickel atoms respectively. Each additional hydrogen atom demands one hollow site with another three nickel atoms.

2. The mechanism for dehydrogenation reactions, such as the conversion of ethylene to acetylene on nickel surfaces, might involve a concerted elimination of both hydrogen atoms from the ethylene molecule. This could happen either through a cis elimination followed by translation of the molecule to a new adsorption site, or through a trans elimination accompanied by rotation around the molecule's symmetry axis along the surface.

1. 离子材料上的金属中心通过要求较大的金属原子簇才能使反应发生，从而促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。乙烯和乙炔的吸附需要最少四个表面镍原子和两个镍原子分别。每个额外的氢原子需要一个空位和另外三个镍原子。

2. 例如，在镍表面上将乙烯转化为乙炔的脱氢化反应机制可能涉及从乙烯分子中同时消除两个氢原子的协同消除步骤。这可以通过顺式消除后分子沿表面翻译到新的吸附位点，或者通过转消除伴随分子围绕其对称轴旋转来实现。
