[1] "The fact that on Cu(100) 8-H elimination is much faster in 3-hexyl groups than in cyclohexyl moieties indicates that molecular strain also hinders the reaction, and suggests a cyclic transition state?24 Finally, a mo- lecular cluster calculation for the decomposition of isobutyl decomposition on aluminum surfaces favors a four-center planar intermediate?12 The activation barrier for 8 elimination ranges from 24 to 37 kcaVmol on aluminum,5I6 but is less than 10 kcaVmol on most transition metal sur- f a c e a ."
[2] "On silver in particular alkyl groups couple with 100% efficiency,@ perhaps because the low affinity of silver for hydrogen inhibits any hydride elimination steps;the same lack of elimination activity has been reported in silver complees."

[4] "The mechanism for vinyl dehydrogenation seems to depend on the nature of the transition metal: infrared experiments indicated that the thermal activation of vinyl moieties on Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties Pt(ll1) leads to the formation of a mixture of vi- nylidene and acetylene around 140 K,131 while a preference for pure acetylene formation at much higher temperatures, about 275 K, was seen on Ni(100).128"
[5] "On surfaces, alkyl a-hydride elimination reactions have so far only been observed in methyl groups.

[7] "The formation of C-H bonds in reductive elimina- tion reactions is in general favored over H-H and Zaera C-C reductive couplings.627 The preference for C-H over H-H bond formation can be explained entirely by thermodynamic arguments, but C-C coupling reactions, which are even more exothermic than the C-H counterparts, are slower because the transition state requires the reorientation of two highly direc- tional carbon-sp3 hybrid orbitals.628"

[10] "Alkyls One of the most common reactions both in orga- nometallic alkyl hydride complexes and on alkyl surface systems is the recombinatory reductive elimi- nation of the alkyl group with hydrogen to yield a free alkane. This reaction is in principle reversible (the reverse reaction being the oxidative addition step discussed previously), but usually goes only in one direction. The oxidative additiodreductive elimina- tion equilibrium is determined by the overall ther- modynamics of the system, and therefore depends on the relative stability of the product (an A-B mol- ecule) compared to that of the initial reactant (a M(A)(B) complex)."

1. Metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These processes are utilized in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, as seen in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by a metal center, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which then undergoes further reactions to form the desired product. H-abstraction refers to the removal of a hydrogen atom from a molecule, often facilitated by metal-catalyzed reactions. In the case of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, the activation of C-H bonds through these mechanisms enables the selective oxidation of butane into maleic anhydride, showcasing the utility of metal oxide catalysts in chemical synthesis.

2. On silver surfaces, alkyl groups couple with 100% efficiency, possibly due to the low affinity of silver for hydrogen, which inhibits hydride elimination steps. This lack of elimination activity has been reported in silver complexes, highlighting the unique properties of silver in facilitating alkyl coupling reactions.

3. The selectivity of hydride elimination reactions in inorganic compounds is influenced by the nature of the metal complex. For instance, neopentyl tantalum compounds tend to form stable methylenic species via an a-hydride elimination step, whereas analogous platinum complexes undergo elimination at the y position to yield metallacyclobutane compounds. This suggests that y eliminations are favored by low-valence late transition metals, but direct evidence for y-elimination reactions on surfaces is not yet available.

4. The mechanism for vinyl dehydrogenation varies based on the nature of the transition metal. For example, infrared experiments indicate that on Pt(ll1), the thermal activation of vinyl moieties leads to the formation of a mixture of vinylidene and acetylene around 140 K, while on Ni(100), a preference for pure acetylene formation is observed at much higher temperatures, around 275 K. This highlights the dependence of the reaction pathway on the specific metal involved.

5. Alkyl a-hydride elimination reactions have been observed only in methyl groups on surfaces. Indirect evidence for such reactions in other cases comes from temperature-programmed desorption and photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The conversion of methyl moieties to methylene groups has been clearly established on Pt(ll1) through reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS).

6. Theoretical studies reveal that the complete transfer of the a hydrogen to the tantalum center is symmetry forbidden, explaining the stability of the original reactants. Hydride abstraction from a bridging carbene can yield an unsaturated and reactive bridging carbyne with a pronounced carbonium ion character. Carbynes bind analogously to carbenes and display similar chemistry, capable of reacting with nucleophiles, electrophiles, or undergoing electrocyclic reactions in less reactive solvents.

7. C-H bond formation in reductive elimination reactions is generally favored over H-H and C-C reductive couplings due to thermodynamic considerations. However, C-C coupling reactions, despite being even more exothermic, are slower because they require the reorientation of two highly directional carbon-sp3 hybrid orbitals. The lack of isotopic scrambling in experiments with mixed labeled compounds and the preservation of the stereoselectivity of the coupling alkyl groups confirm that reductive eliminations are concerted and do not involve previous dissociation of the metal-carbon bond.

8. Intramolecular reductive elimination reactions have been reported in gold, silver, copper, manganese, and cobalt complexes. However, the elimination of two organic ligands from a pair of metal atoms joined by a bond is symmetry forbidden, making it a rare occurrence. R-H elimination from two metal centers has been observed, but only after a P-hydride elimination step.

9. The adsorption of hydrogen and ethylene on the surface in vacuum studies affects the kinetics of the hydrogenation reaction due to a geometrical constraint on the adsorption of these molecules. This constraint influences the pathways and rates of hydrogenation, demonstrating the impact of surface conditions on catalytic processes.

10. The reductive elimination of alkyl groups with hydrogen to yield free alkanes is a common reaction in both organometallic alkyl hydride complexes and on alkyl surface systems. This reaction is reversible, with the reverse process being the oxidative addition step. The equilibrium of the oxidative additiodreductive elimination depends on the thermodynamics of the system, with the product's relative stability compared to the initial reactant dictating the direction of the reaction.

1. 在氧化材料的金属中心上，通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H抽象等途径促进了C-H键激活。这些过程在工业中用于选择性氧化烷烃，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及金属中心从分子中抽象氢原子，形成碳正离子中间体，然后进一步反应生成所需产物。H抽象指的是从分子中去除氢原子的过程，通常由金属催化的反应促进。在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，通过这些机制激活C-H键实现了对丁烷的选择性氧化，展示了金属氧化物催化剂在化学合成中的应用价值。

2. 银表面的烷基耦合具有100%的效率，可能是因为银对氢的低亲和力抑制了氢化物消除步骤，这种消除活性缺乏已在银复合物中报道。这凸显了银在促进烷基耦合反应的独特性质。

3. 烷基氢化物消除反应的选择性取决于无机化合物的金属复合物性质。例如，二甲基乙醇盐倾向于通过a-氢化物消除步骤形成稳定的甲基烯烃物种，而类似的铂复合物则在y位置进行消除以形成金属环戊烷化合物。这表明y消除在低价过渡金属中更受青睐，但关于表面y-消除反应的直接证据尚不存在。

4. 不同金属对乙烯脱氢的机制有所不同。例如，红外实验显示，在Pt(ll1)上，乙烯热激活导致形成混合的乙烯二烯和乙炔约140 K，而在Ni(100)上，纯乙炔形成偏好于更高温度（约275 K）。这表明反应路径依赖于特定的金属类型。

5. 在表面上，只有甲基组分表现出a-氢化物消除反应。间接证据来自于温度程序脱吸附和光电子光谱实验。在Pt(ll1)上，甲基物种的脱氢化被清晰地建立为转化为甲基二烯。

6. 理论研究表明，a氢完全转移到钽中心是反对称的，解释了原始反应物的稳定性。从桥接碳烯中移除氢可以产生一个不饱和且高度反应性的桥接碳烯，带有明显的碳离子特征。碳烯以类似的方式与碳烯结合，并展现出相似的化学性质，能够与亲核试剂或亲电试剂反应，或在较不活泼的溶剂中进行电环化反应。在多核簇中，它们也会重新排列到有利于脱氢反应的几何构型。

7. 在重排消除反应中，C-H键形成通常优于H-H和C-C重排耦合，这是基于热力学考虑的。然而，C-C耦合反应，尽管更放热，速度较慢，因为过渡态需要两个高度定向的碳sp3杂化轨道的重排。实验结果表明，异位标记化合物中没有发生任何同位素混乱，以及保持耦合烷基组分的立体化学完整性，证实了重排消除是协同进行的，不需要先前的金属-碳键断裂。

8. 已经在金、银、铜、锰和钴复合物中报告了内向重排消除反应。然而，消除两个有机配体的两个金属原子之间已连接的键是反对称的，因此非常罕见。在某些情况下，已经观察到从两个金属中心消除H-R，但仅在P-氢化物消除步骤之后。

9. 氢和乙烯在真空研究中的吸附在表面上改变了氢化反应的速率，因为这影响了这两种分子的吸附方式。这种约束条件影响了氢化路径和速率，展示了表面条件对催化过程的影响。

10. 烷基团与氢气的还原消除反应产生自由烷烃是一种常见的反应，在有机金属烷基氢化物复合物和烷基表面系统中均可见。这个反应是可逆的，其反过程是氧化添加步骤。氧化加成与消除消除平衡依赖于系统的热力学，产品与初始反应物的相对稳定性决定了反应的方向。
