<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses the activation barriers for the elimination of hydrogen from various hydrocarbon groups on different metal surfaces. On Cu(100), the elimination of hydrogen from 3-hexyl groups is faster than from cyclohexyl moieties, indicating that molecular strain affects the reaction rate. The activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen from isobutyl groups on aluminum surfaces is estimated to range from 24 to 37 kcaVmol, while on most transition metal surfaces, it is less than 10 kcaVmol. This suggests that the nature of the metal surface and the strain in the hydrocarbon group play significant roles in determining the activation barrier for hydrogen elimination reactions.

What are the key differences between hydrocarbon chemistry on surfaces compared to organometallic complexes?
</questions>
<quotes>
The similarities in chemical behavior between hydrocarbon ligands in organometallic complexes and hydrocarbon species adsorbed on surfaces can be justified by the localized nature of the chemical bond between the metal atoms and the hydrocarbon moieties on surfaces.
</quotes>


<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Key differences between hydrocarbon chemistry on surfaces and organometallic complexes include:

1. **Easier Activation**: Unsaturated adsorbates such as olefins are easier to activate on surfaces than on discrete metal complexes.
2. **Conversion of Alkyl Groups**: The conversion of adsorbed neopentyl groups to isobutene is difficult to explain in terms of known organometallic processes.
3. **C-C Coupling and Insertion**: C-C coupling and methylene and olefin migratory insertion reactions are apparently easier with coordinated ligands than with chemisorbed fragments on solid surfaces, particularly under vacuum.
4. **Reaction Selectivity**: Heterogeneous systems catalyze a much larger number of reactions than their organometallic counterparts, but they usually exhibit much poorer selectivity toward any given pathway.

It is our belief that there is a close relation between organic ligands in organometallic compounds and their counterparts on solid surfaces in terms of both structure and reactivity.
The vibrational normal modes associated with bonds between surfaces and adsorbates usually display well-defined frequency value.
Evidence for the formation of alkyl moieties after this bond-scission step comes from a range of techniques, mostly X-ray photoelectron (XPS),static secondary ion mass (SSIMS), and vibrational (HREELS and RAIRS) spectroscopies.
The alkyl chains initially orient themselves flat on the surface in order to maximize their interaction with the metal, but reorient to a perpendicular configuration at higher coverages, presumably because van der Waals interactions between the hydrocarbon chains dominate in that regime.
Metal-carbon dissociation energy for gas-phase metal-CH3 fragments ranges from about 30 kcaVmo1 (for Mn and Fe) to 60 kcaYmol (for Ni and Cu).
The bond energies for a given metal have similar values regardless of the type of system being studied, whether it is a gas-phase radical, a gas or a liquid organometallic complex, or a hydrocarbon moiety adsorbed on a solid surface, as long as the oxidation state of the metal is not changed.
When coordi- nated to one metal center, the metal-carbon bond has a pure a character, but this type of ligand is more commonly seen in clusters, and in those com- pounds an additional interaction between the n orbital and a second metal atom is usually ob-
The stability of alkyl fragments. As mentioned earlier,metal-carbon c 7 bonds are not inherently weak;compounds with alkyl ligands are kinetically un- stable only because there are a number of decomposi- tion routes readily available to them.
The formation of larger alkylidynes (n-propylidyne,n-butylidyne, isobutylidyne, and n-pentylidyne) by thermal conversion of the corresponding olefins was initially inferred from TPD and LEED r e s  l t s *   - and later corroborated by vibrational spectros-
Ethylidyne has been one of the most studied moieties in surface science in recent years; a wide range of struc- t  r a 1 , 2   .    * electronic,218-220 and v i b r a t i  n a l '  ,techniques have been used for that purpose.
The general findings from this work can be summarized as follows (Figure 3): (1) ethylidyne chemisorbs with
Ethylene adsorption normally leads to significant rehybridization toward a single-bond character, and retention of the double-bond character occurs mainly in late transition metals, but this trend can be modified by coadsorption of species such as oxygen or carbon.
The flat adsorption geometry for acetylene on Pt(ll1) has also been confirmed by ARUPS data.
The main structural features of inorganic conjugated-alkene complexes can be summarized as follows: (1) the bond between the inner carbon atoms of the diene is shorter than the average of the outer ones; (2) both inner and outer carbon atom pairs are each equidis- tant from the metal; (3) the inner carbons are closer to the metal center; (4) the four carbons are coplanar,with C-C-C bond angles ranging from 114 to 121";and (5) the substituents in the C 1 and C4 positions tend to be twisted out of the four-carbon plane.
Binding of butadiene in the trans configuration is rare, but it has been observed in a few circumstances, both in mononuclear com- p l e  e s    ,and in clusters.

Answer: The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, hydrogen abstraction from the C-H bond leads to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate can then undergo further reactions, such as oxidation or rearrangement, leading to the desired products. The H-abstraction mechanism involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond, which can also lead to the formation of a carbocation or other reactive intermediates. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the selective removal of hydrogen atoms from the alkane leads to the formation of the desired organic compound.

Answer: Almost 90% of revenue came from widget sales, with gadget sales making up the remaining 10%. The company's revenue structure is heavily weighted towards the sale of widgets.

Answer: Ethylidyne has been extensively studied in surface science. Techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, static secondary ion mass spectroscopy, vibrational spectroscopy, and more have been used to investigate its properties. Ethylidyne is found to chemisorb with a single-bond character, primarily on late transition metals, and its reactivity is influenced by the presence of other species such as oxygen or carbon.

Answer: The stability of alkyl fragments is maintained by the strong nature of metal-carbon bonds, which are not inherently weak. This stability is contingent upon the absence of decomposition pathways available to the alkyl fragments.

Answer: The synthesis of alkylidynes from olefins involves thermal conversion, decomposition of acetylene, or substitution of existing alkylidyne compounds. The electronic configuration of alkylidynes is debated, but it is believed that they have a sp hybridized carbon atom bonded to all three metal atoms via delocalized molecular orbitals.

Answer: Ethylidyne is characterized by a flat adsorption geometry on surfaces, with its C-C bond standing in a perpendicular configuration to the surface. This orientation is supported by data from photoelectron diffraction experiments and reflects the single-bond character of the ethylidyne moiety.

Answer: Butadiene binds to metal surfaces through a combination of interactions, including a simultaneous donation of electrons from a carbon p orbital perpendicular to the metal d band and a back donation of metal d electrons to an empty carbon p orbital parallel to the surface. This configuration is supported by data from reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction experiments.

Answer: Binding of butadiene in the trans configuration is uncommon but has been observed under certain conditions, both in mononuclear complexes and in clusters. The trans configuration is characterized by a bent structure with the two double bonds aligned in a zigzag pattern.

On silver in particular alkyl groups couple with 100% efficiency,@ perhaps because the low affinity of silver for hydrogen inhibits any hydride elimination steps;the same lack of elimination activity has been reported in silver complees.
The selectivity for y- versus a-hydride e l i - nation in inorganic compounds depends on the nature of the metal complex. For example, neopentyl tan- talum compounds tend to form stable methylenic species via an a-hydride elimination step,17' but analogous platinum complexes undergo elimination at the y position to yield metallacyclobutane com- pounds instead?38 It has been suggested that y eliminations are favored by low-valence late transi- tion metals.No direct evidence is yet available for y-elimination reactions on surfaces.
The mechanism for vinyl dehydrogenation seems to depend on the nature of the transition metal: infrared experiments indicated that the thermal activation of vinyl moieties on Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties Pt(ll1) leads to the formation of a mixture of vi- nylidene and acetylene around 140 K,131 while a preference for pure acetylene formation at much higher temperatures, about 275 K, was seen on Ni(100).128
On surfaces, alkyl a-hydride elimination reactions have so far only been observed in methyl groups. The conversion of methyl moieties to methylene groups was clearly established on Pt(ll1) by reflection- absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS).52535 In- direct evidence for such a reaction in other cases comes from temperature-programmed desorp- tion36*a,47,62 and photoelectron spectrocopf3 experi- ments.
It is interesting to note,although, that theoretical studies have revealed that the complete transfer of the a hydrogen to the tantalum center is symmetry forbidden, which ex- plains why the original reactants are so stable.323 Hydride abstraction from a bridging carbene can yield an unsaturated and very reactive bridging carbyne with a pronounced carbonium ion charac- ter.174 Carbynes bind in an analogous way to carbenes,and display similar chemistry.11g For instance, car- bynes can he made to react with either nucleophiles or electrophiles, or to undergo electrocyclic reactions in less reactive solvents. In polynuclear clusters they also rearrange in geometrical configurations which facilitate dehydrogenation reactions.
The formation of C-H bonds in reductive elimina- tion reactions is in general favored over H-H and Zaera C-C reductive couplings.627 The preference for C-H over H-H bond formation can be explained entirely by thermodynamic arguments, but C-C coupling reactions, which are even more exothermic than the C-H counterparts, are slower because the transition state requires the reorientation of two highly direc- tional carbon-sp3 hybrid orbitals.628

The order in which the hydrogen and the ethylene are adsorbed on the surface in vacuum studies also changes the kinetics of the hydrogenation reaction!" This is because there is a geometrical constraint on the way the olefin and the hydrogen atoms need to
Alkyls One of the most common reactions both in orga- nometallic alkyl hydride complexes and on alkyl surface systems is the recombinatory reductive elimi- nation of the alkyl group with hydrogen to yield a free alkane. This reaction is in principle reversible (the reverse reaction being the oxidative addition step discussed previously), but usually goes only in one direction. The oxidative additiodreductive elimina- tion equilibrium is determined by the overall ther- modynamics of the system, and therefore depends on the relative stability of the product (an A-B mol- ecule) compared to that of the initial reactant (a M(A)(B) complex).

1. Metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These processes are utilized in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, as seen in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by a metal center, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which then undergoes further reactions to form the desired product. H-abstraction refers to the removal of a hydrogen atom from a molecule, often facilitated by metal-catalyzed reactions. In the case of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, the activation of C-H bonds through these mechanisms enables the selective oxidation of butane into maleic anhydride, showcasing the utility of metal oxide catalysts in chemical synthesis.

2. On silver surfaces, alkyl groups couple with 100% efficiency, possibly due to the low affinity of silver for hydrogen, which inhibits hydride elimination steps. This lack of elimination activity has been reported in silver complexes, highlighting the unique properties of silver in facilitating alkyl coupling reactions.

3. The selectivity of hydride elimination reactions in inorganic compounds is influenced by the nature of the metal complex. For instance, neopentyl tantalum compounds tend to form stable methylenic species via an a-hydride elimination step, whereas analogous platinum complexes undergo elimination at the y position to yield metallacyclobutane compounds. This suggests that y eliminations are favored by low-valence late transition metals, but direct evidence for y-elimination reactions on surfaces is not yet available.

4. The mechanism for vinyl dehydrogenation varies based on the nature of the transition metal. For example, infrared experiments indicate that on Pt(ll1), the thermal activation of vinyl moieties leads to the formation of a mixture of vinylidene and acetylene around 140 K, while on Ni(100), a preference for pure acetylene formation is observed at much higher temperatures, around 275 K. This highlights the dependence of the reaction pathway on the specific metal involved.

5. Alkyl a-hydride elimination reactions have been observed only in methyl groups on surfaces. Indirect evidence for such reactions in other cases comes from temperature-programmed desorption and photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The conversion of methyl moieties to methylene groups has been clearly established on Pt(ll1) through reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS).

6. Theoretical studies reveal that the complete transfer of the a hydrogen to the tantalum center is symmetry forbidden, explaining the stability of the original reactants. Hydride abstraction from a bridging carbene can yield an unsaturated and reactive bridging carbyne with a pronounced carbonium ion character. Carbynes bind analogously to carbenes and display similar chemistry, capable of reacting with nucleophiles, electrophiles, or undergoing electrocyclic reactions in less reactive solvents.

7. C-H bond formation in reductive elimination reactions is generally favored over H-H and C-C reductive couplings due to thermodynamic considerations. However, C-C coupling reactions, despite being even more exothermic, are slower because they require the reorientation of two highly directional carbon-sp3 hybrid orbitals. The lack of isotopic scrambling in experiments with mixed labeled compounds and the preservation of the stereoselectivity of the coupling alkyl groups confirm that reductive eliminations are concerted and do not involve previous dissociation of the metal-carbon bond.

8. Intramolecular reductive elimination reactions have been reported in gold, silver, copper, manganese, and cobalt complexes. However, the elimination of two organic ligands from a pair of metal atoms joined by a bond is symmetry forbidden, making it a rare occurrence. R-H elimination from two metal centers has been observed, but only after a P-hydride elimination step.

9. The adsorption of hydrogen and ethylene on the surface in vacuum studies affects the kinetics of the hydrogenation reaction due to a geometrical constraint on the adsorption of these molecules. This constraint influences the pathways and rates of hydrogenation, demonstrating the impact of surface conditions on catalytic processes.

10. The reductive elimination of alkyl groups with hydrogen to yield free alkanes is a common reaction in both organometallic alkyl hydride complexes and on alkyl surface systems. This reaction is reversible, with the reverse process being the oxidative addition step. The equilibrium of the oxidative additiodreductive elimination depends on the thermodynamics of the system, with the product's relative stability compared to the initial reactant dictating the direction of the reaction.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
To facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role. These metal centers act as active sites where chemical reactions occur. The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen process and hydrogen abstraction. 

The Mars van Krevelen process refers to the transfer of a proton from a molecule to a metal surface, which leads to the formation of a metal hydride complex. This complex then facilitates the activation of the C-H bond. Hydrogen abstraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from a substrate molecule, which can also lead to the activation of the C-H bond.

These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, butane molecules come into contact with the metal catalysts supported on oxide materials. The metal centers activate the C-H bonds in butane, allowing for selective oxidation to occur, resulting in the production of maleic anhydride. This reaction demonstrates the importance of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in achieving efficient and selective chemical transformations.

The synthesis of organometallic compounds with alkyl ligands via the direct oxidative addition (C-H bond scission) of saturated hydrocarbons to metal atoms is in general not practical because of the low reactivity of those alkanes.
There are, however,several easier routes for the synthesis of alkyl-metal organometallic complexes, such as, for instance, the oxidative addition of alkyl halides to metal center.
Alkyl halide insertion reactions can also be induced on transition metal surfaces.
In addition to alkyl groups, unsaturated hydrocarbons can also a bond to one or more metal centers to form alkenyl (vinyl), alkynyl (acetylide), or aryl ligands.
The stability of alkyl fragments. As mentioned earlier,metal-carbon C7 bonds are not inherently weak;compounds with alkyl ligands are kinetically unstable only because there are a number of decomposition routes readily available to them.
Metal complexes containing unsaturated carbenes such as vinylidenes are quite reactive, but can nevertheless be isolated.
Alkylidenes are usually prepared either by conversion of terminal alkynes, or by protonation or alkylation of metal acetylides.
Ethylidyne has been one of the most studied moieties in surface science in recent years; a wide range of structural, electronic, and vibrational techniques have been used for that purpose.
Ethylidyne chemisorbs with its C-C bond parallel to the surface but with its molecular plane tilted by 50",suggestive of a di-oh three-atom interaction.
The flat adsorption geometry for acetylene on Pt(ll1) has also been confirmed by ARUPS data.
Alkynes bind to metals in a similar manner as olefins. However, because of their larger electro- negativity, there is more back-donation of metal d electrons to the empty X* antibonding orbitals in the alkynes, and therefore, the bonding to the metal is stronger.
Conjugated alkenes such as butadiene could be considered as four-electron donors, since both olefinic bonds can coordinate to the central metal atom, but the actual bonding is better regarded as the result of the interaction of the delocalized X system of the diene with the d orbitals of the metal.
In most cases the scission of saturated C-H bonds requires complexes with labile ligands,so they can be easily released to produce the electron- deficient electrophilic metal centers needed for three- center two-electron agostic interactions.
Direct evidence for the formation of alkane-metal adducts is not yet available, the initial metal-HC interaction is believed to be agostic.
The activation barrier associated with the decomposition of alkanes on metal surfaces is in most cases lower than 20 kcal/mo1,471-474,484 less than one-fifth of the C-H bond energy in hydrocarbons.

However, there are alternative routes such as oxidative addition of alkyl halides to metal centers or alkyl halide insertion reactions on metal surfaces. Unsaturated hydrocarbons can also bond to metal centers to form alkenyl, alkynyl, or aryl ligands. The stability of alkyl fragments is maintained by decomposition routes rather than inherent weakness of metal-carbon C7 bonds.

7. The initial metal-HC interaction is believed to be agostic, even though direct evidence for alkane-metal adducts is lacking.

Catalytic processes
In view of this, only the most important conclusions reached so far in terms of mechanisms for hydrocarbon catalytic processes will be summarized here.

Dehydrogenation
In the case of cyclohexene, where dehydrogenation to benzene competes with hydrogenation to cyclohexane, the selection between these two paths changes dramatically with total pressure, even if the Hdcyclohexene ratio is kept constant: the production of benzene dominates at low pressures (Torr), but cyclohexane is formed almost exclusively under high pressures (lo2 Torr) (Figure 18).
Hydrogenation
The studies on ethylene hydrogenation over Pt(ll1) have shown that the active catalytic surface in these processes is not clean, but completely covered with a layer of strongly bound hydrocarbon moieties (ethylidyne in the case of ethylene hydrogenation).

Industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, relies on the use of isolated metal centers on oxide materials to facilitate C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, a metal center accepts a proton from an acid site to form a more reactive intermediate, which then facilitates the breaking of the C-H bond. H-abstraction involves a hydrogen atom being abstracted from an alkane molecule by a metal center, leading to the formation of a radical and a carbocation, which can then proceed to form various products depending on the reaction conditions.

In the context of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, the selective oxidation process is typically carried out over a metal oxide catalyst. The metal oxide provides a surface for the metal active sites, which are isolated from each other by the oxide layer. This isolation prevents the metal from reacting with oxygen directly, thus avoiding unwanted side reactions. Instead, the metal center is exposed to the alkane molecule, facilitating its activation and subsequent oxidation. The metal center accepts a proton from the acidic sites on the oxide material, leading to the formation of a reactive intermediate that breaks the C-H bond in butane. The resulting alkyl radical then reacts with oxygen to form maleic anhydride.

The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride showcases the application of metal oxide catalysts in industrial processes, demonstrating the effectiveness of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in facilitating C-H bond activation through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction.

This structure sensitivity may be related to the need for a reason- ably large ensemble of metal atoms in order for the reaction to occur: the adsorption of ethylene and acetylene involves a minimum of four and two surface nickel atoms, respetively,3J and each extra hydride requires one hollow site with another three Ni atoms.
Since such large ensembles are difficult to emulate with organometallic clusters, it may be difficult to reproduce these surface reactions in the homogeneous phase.
In the case of the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane en platinum, the blocking of surface sites by gold deposition increases the selectivity for cyclohexene over benzene production, presumably because a larger site is required to accommodate the extra hydrogen atoms from benzene formation (Figure 18).

To understand how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, one needs to consider the role of oxygen atoms in stabilizing metal complexes and promoting reactive intermediates. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism suggests that oxygen atoms can stabilize metal-bound alkyl radicals through π-back bonding, leading to more stable and reactive species. H-abstraction from C-H bonds occurs when these species interact with hydrogen atoms, which can lead to the formation of carbocation intermediates or other reactive species depending on the conditions. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes by designing catalysts with appropriate metal loading and support materials to control the reaction pathway and product selectivity.

As an example, consider the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, the butane molecule undergoes oxidative cleavage, where a double bond is inserted into the butane chain, resulting in the formation of maleic anhydride. This is typically achieved using a suitable heterogeneous catalyst system that includes metal oxides and promoters. The metal center on the oxide surface facilitates the activation of molecular oxygen, which then reacts with the butane molecule to form peroxy intermediates. These peroxy species abstract hydrogen from the butane molecule, leading to the formation of the desired maleic anhydride product.

The specific mechanism involves the following steps:
1. Activation of molecular oxygen by the metal center on the oxide surface.
2. Formation of peroxy intermediates by reaction of activated oxygen with the butane molecule.
3. H-abstraction from the C-H bond of butane by the peroxy intermediates, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate.
4. Rearrangement of the carbocation intermediate to form the maleic anhydride product.

This conversion demonstrates the application of principles related to C-H bond activation and H-abstraction in a practical industrial setting, where careful control over the catalyst composition and operating conditions ensures high product selectivity and efficiency.

and on Pd(ll1) in molecular beam studies at room temerature.

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of hydrogen from a metal-bound species to an adsorbed hydrocarbon, while H-abstraction refers to the removal of a hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbon, typically by a more reactive species. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation processes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. For example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the activation of C-H bonds allows for the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, rather than producing other unwanted products.

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through various mechanisms. Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction are key processes involved in these reactions. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by a surface-bound radical, leading to the formation of a carbene intermediate. H-abstraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon molecule, leading to the formation of a radical and a carbocation. These mechanisms allow for the selective activation of C-H bonds, enabling the conversion of hydrocarbons into functionalized products.

2. In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied through the use of metal oxide catalysts. For example, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride can be achieved using a metal oxide catalyst. Butane is oxidized over the catalyst surface, where C-H bonds are selectively activated. The activation of C-H bonds allows for the formation of peroxy radicals, which then abstract hydrogen from butane to form peroxybutenes. These peroxybutenes further react to form maleic anhydride, demonstrating the application of C-H bond activation principles in industrial processes.

Alkyl iodides are commonly used in these studies as precursors for the preparation of alkyl groups on metal surfaces, since the C-I bond is easily activated at temperatures below 200 K.
An elegant series of experiments using fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have demonstrated the anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in the same way as previously reported for organometallic.
The positive charge that develops on the 8 carbon in the transition state is also stabilized by electron-donating groups such as alkyls, making the reaction on either propyl or butyl species faster than on ethyl groups.
