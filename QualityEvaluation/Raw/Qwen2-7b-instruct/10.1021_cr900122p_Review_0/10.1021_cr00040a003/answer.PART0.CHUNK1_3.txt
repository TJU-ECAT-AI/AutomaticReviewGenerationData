[1] "This structure sensitivity may be related to the need for a reason- ably large ensemble of metal atoms in order for the reaction to occur: the adsorption of ethylene and acetylene involves a minimum of four and two surface nickel atoms, respetively,3J and each extra hydride requires one hollow site with another three Ni atoms."
[2] "Since such large ensembles are difficult to emulate with organometallic clusters, it may be difficult to reproduce these surface reactions in the homogeneous phase."
[3] "In the case of the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane en platinum, the blocking of surface sites by gold deposition increases the selectivity for cyclohexene over benzene production, presumably because a larger site is required to accommodate the extra hydrogen atoms from benzene formation (Figure 18)."

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing a large ensemble of metal atoms, which enables reactions such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. 

2. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride relies on the presence of a large ensemble of metal atoms to enable the necessary C-H bond activation and subsequent oxidation. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction play crucial roles in this process.

3. The dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on platinum shows structure sensitivity, where blocking surface sites by gold deposition increases the selectivity for cyclohexene production over benzene. This is because a larger site is required to accommodate the extra hydrogen atoms released during benzene formation.

1. 独立的金属中心在氧化物材料上通过提供大量金属原子来促进异相催化中的C-H键激活，这包括Mars van Krevelen机制和H解离。这些原则在工业中被应用于烷烃的选择性氧化，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例。

2. 丁烷转化为马来酸酐依赖于大量金属原子的存在，以实现必要的C-H键激活和随后的氧化。Mars van Krevelen机制和H解离在这个过程中扮演着关键角色。

3. 氧化铂上的环己烷脱氢显示出结构敏感性，其中通过金沉积阻塞表面位点可以增加环己烯产率相对于苯的生产选择性。这是因为需要更大的位点来容纳苯形成过程中释放的额外氢原子。
