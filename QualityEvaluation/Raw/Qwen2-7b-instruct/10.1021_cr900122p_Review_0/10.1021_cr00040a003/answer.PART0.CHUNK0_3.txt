[1] "The selectivity for 8- over either a- or y-hydride elimination was clearly demonstrated on both Cu(llO)M and Ni(100) surfaces by isotope labeling studies (Figure 9), and additional studies highlighted the ease with which 8-elimination occurs on other surfaces for straight alkyl chains of up to six carbon atoms, as well as for branched species such as isopropyl and isobutyl."

The 8-hydride elimination pathway is preferred over alpha or gamma hydride eliminations on both Cu(llO)M and Ni(100) surfaces. This has been demonstrated through isotope labeling studies. The 8-elimination pathway is also observed on other surfaces for alkyl chains up to six carbons, as well as branched species like isopropyl and isobutyl.

在Cu(llO)M和Ni(100)表面上，8-氢消除途径明显优于α或γ氢消除。这通过同位素标记研究得到了证明。对于碳链最多六个碳原子的直链烷基以及异丙基和异丁基等支链物种，8-消除过程也能够在其他表面观察到。

[1] "The details of the mechanism for 8-H eliminations on metal surfaces have been addressed by a few research groups. An elegant series of experiments using fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have demonstrated the anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in the same way as previously reported for organometallic"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The mechanisms behind 8-H eliminations on metal surfaces have been explored by some research teams. A series of sophisticated experiments utilizing fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have illustrated the anionic character of the departing hydrogen, akin to previous findings in organometallic compounds.
