1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through various mechanisms. Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction are key processes involved in these reactions. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by a surface-bound radical, leading to the formation of a carbene intermediate. H-abstraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon molecule, leading to the formation of a radical and a carbocation. These mechanisms allow for the selective activation of C-H bonds, enabling the conversion of hydrocarbons into functionalized products.

2. In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied through the use of metal oxide catalysts. For example, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride can be achieved using a metal oxide catalyst. Butane is oxidized over the catalyst surface, where C-H bonds are selectively activated. The activation of C-H bonds allows for the formation of peroxy radicals, which then abstract hydrogen from butane to form peroxybutenes. These peroxybutenes further react to form maleic anhydride, demonstrating the application of C-H bond activation principles in industrial processes.

1. 孤立在氧化物材料上的金属中心可以通过各种机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。火星范克里夫和氢提取是这些过程中涉及的关键过程。火星范克里夫机制涉及表面自由基对氢原子的抽取，导致碳烯中间体的形成。氢提取涉及到从烃分子中去除氢原子，导致自由基和碳正离子的形成。这些机制允许选择性激活C-H键，从而实现烃类的转化成功能化产物。

2. 在烷烃选择性氧化的工业应用中，这些原理通过使用金属氧化物催化剂进行应用。例如，丁烷转化为马来酸酐可以通过金属氧化物催化剂实现。丁烷在催化剂表面上被氧化，其中选择性激活C-H键。激活C-H键允许形成过氧自由基，然后从丁烷抽取氢原子形成过氧丁烯。这些过氧丁烯进一步反应形成马来酸酐，这展示了C-H键活化原理在工业过程中的应用。
