The fact that on Cu(100) 8-H elimination is much faster in 3-hexyl groups than in cyclohexyl moieties indicates that molecular strain also hinders the reaction, and suggests a cyclic transition state?24 Finally, a mo- lecular cluster calculation for the decomposition of isobutyl decomposition on aluminum surfaces favors a four-center planar intermediate?12 The activation barrier for 8 elimination ranges from 24 to 37 kcaVmol on aluminum,5I6 but is less than 10 kcaVmol on most transition metal sur- f a c e

The literature discusses the activation barriers for the elimination of hydrogen from various hydrocarbon groups on different metal surfaces. On Cu(100), the elimination of hydrogen from 3-hexyl groups is faster than from cyclohexyl moieties, indicating that molecular strain affects the reaction rate. The activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen from isobutyl groups on aluminum surfaces is estimated to range from 24 to 37 kcaVmol, while on most transition metal surfaces, it is less than 10 kcaVmol. This suggests that the nature of the metal surface and the strain in the hydrocarbon group play significant roles in determining the activation barrier for hydrogen elimination reactions.

文献讨论了不同金属表面上各种烃基团脱氢消除的活化能。在Cu(100)上，3-己基基团的氢消除速率比环己基更快，这表明分子张力影响反应速率。铝表面的异丁基氢消除的活化能估计范围为24至37 kcaVmol，而在大多数过渡金属表面上，该值小于10 kcaVmol。这表明金属表面性质和烃基团的张力对氢消除反应的活化能具有重要影响。

This difference is paralleled by differences in the thermodynamics of the reaction,and therefore may be related to the affinity of the different surfaces for atomic hydrogen. Also, the elimination of a deuterium atom from an ethyl group is about 10 times slower than the elimination of a normal hydrogen on either C  ( 1 0 0 ) or Fe(lOO)lOz surfaces;since normal primary isotope effects can at the most account for a factor of 5,the remaining difference must be due either to tunneling or to secondary effects. The reaction rate can be reduced further by caging effects, because a large ensemble of atoms is required to accommodate the resulting products;525 this may be related to the increase in coordination number required for the reaction in organometallic systems. Some other signilicant trends have been observed (1) The desorption temperature of alkenes from alkyl groups on Ni(100) shifts to higher temperature with increasing chain length,perhaps because of the increase in adsorption energy of the pr0ducts.4 (2) Branched alkyls yield more alkenes than linear ones (relative to the alkane produced by the competing reductive elimination reaction), and they do so at lower temperatures. This effect can be explained at least in part by steric and entropic arguments. (3) Open surfaces are normally 2888 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 more active than close-packed ones: the formation of ethylene from ethyl peaks around 240 K in tem- perature-programmed desorption on Cu(lOO), but only about 225 kon Cu(110).526 This difference may be correlated to the requirement of low-coordination numbers for the j3-H elimination in organometallic complexes. (4) j3-H elimination is easier on earlier transition metals: it occurs below 200 K on nickel,palladium, or platinum surfaces, at around 230-250 K on copper, and at about 260-310 K on gold. (5) Most metals are efficient at promoting j3-hydride elimination reactions, but a few late transition metals tend to favor the reductive elimination route instead.

The literature points out several trends in the behavior of hydrogen elimination reactions on different metal surfaces. The differences in thermodynamics correlate with the surfaces' affinity for atomic hydrogen. The elimination of a deuterium atom from an ethyl group is significantly slower than the normal hydrogen elimination on Cu(100) or Fe(100) surfaces, with the remaining difference likely attributed to tunneling or secondary effects. Reaction rates can be further reduced by caging effects, requiring a large ensemble of atoms to accommodate products, which might relate to the increased coordination number needed in organometallic systems. The desorption temperature of alkenes from alkyl groups on Ni(100) increases with increasing chain length, possibly due to increased adsorption energy of products. Branched alkyl groups produce more alkenes than linear ones at lower temperatures, likely explained by steric and entropic considerations. Open surfaces generally exhibit higher activity than close-packed ones, with ethylene formation from ethyl peaks around 240 K on Cu(100) but only about 225 K on Cu(110). Beta-hydride elimination is faster on earlier transition metals (nickel, palladium, platinum) than on copper or gold, which is around 230-250 K and 260-310 K, respectively. Most metals efficiently promote beta-hydride elimination, but late transition metals may favor the reductive elimination route.

文献指出在不同金属表面上氢消除反应行为的一些趋势。热力学差异与表面对于原子氢的亲合力相关。从一个乙基中消除的重氢比正常氢在Cu(100)或Fe(100)表面上慢得多，剩余的差异可能归因于隧穿效应或二级效应。通过限制大原子簇来进一步降低反应速率可以容纳产物，这可能与有机金属系统中需要更高的配位数有关。Ni(100)上的烯烃从烷基组分的脱附温度随链长增加而升高，可能由于产品吸附能增加。分支烷基组分比线性组分生成更多的烯烃，并且在较低温度下产生，这至少部分由立体化学和熵考虑解释。开放表面通常比紧密堆积的表面更活跃，从乙基形成乙烯在Cu(100)上的峰值约为240 K，在Cu(110)上仅为约225 K。早期过渡金属（镍、钯、铂）上β氢消除的速度比铜或金快，分别为230-250 K和260-310 K。大多数金属高效促进β氢消除反应，但一些晚期过渡金属倾向于促进还原消除途径。

Alkyl groups couple with 100% efficiency,@ perhaps because the low affinity of silver for hydrogen inhibits any hydride elimination steps;the same lack of elimination activity has been reported in silver complees.5 Hydride elimination from the a position, i.e., from the carbon bonded to the metal, is generally much less favorable than from the j3 carbon, but it is operative in ligands with no j3 hydrogens such as methyl, neopentyl, and b e n  y l .   - The simplest case of an a-H elimination step is the conversion of methyl to methylene groups. In contrast to the olefin produced in j3-elimination reactions, though, the methylene moiety that results from a-H abstraction is not stable in free form, and therefore remains coordinated to the metal. Moreover, methylene- hydride complexes are usually unstable and therefore difficult to isolate. In spite of the lack of direct evidence for the mechanism for this reaction, some kinetic data suggest that a-elimination is facile in early transition metal complexes, even in some coordinated alkyl moieties with j3-hdrogens.5'3.58.529 A few coordinatively unsaturated methyl complexes can also exist in equilibrium with their corresponding methylene hydride isomer, a process that promotes fast H-D exchange at the a poition.4'.The same methyl-methylene equilibrium can also be attained in clsters,5' but in dialkyl organometallic com- pounds the formation of carbene ligands is usually accompanied by the subsequent elimination of an alkane molecule in a disproportionation reaction which may take place either through the formation of a metal hydride intermediate or directly via a four- center activated complex (where the a-abstraction step is bypassed)?32 Intermolecular a-hydride ab- straction reactions are possible as we11.533.534 On surfaces, alkyl a-hydride elimination reactions have so far only been observed in methyl groups. The conversion of methyl moieties to methylene groups was clearly established on Pt(ll1) by reflection- absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS).52535 In- direct evidence for such a reaction in other cases comes from temperature-programmed desorp- tion36*a,47,62 and photoelectron spectrocopf3 experi- ments. The multiple H-D exchange seen for methyl groups on Pt(ll1) suggests an activation barrier of less than 10 kcdmol for the dehydrogenation of those moietie.I'* A fast alkyl-alkylidene equilibrium may also be one of the key steps in the mechanism of H-D exchange reactions in alkanes on transition metal  a t a l y s t s ?   .Zaera C-C Bond Scission lsobutene TPD from Neopentyl I Ni(100) Temperature I K Figure

tion (TPD) spectra from neopentyl iodide on Ni(lOO).539-541 This is perhaps the best surface science example for C-C bond-scission reactions. The mechanism of this reaction is still not well understood, but the fact that only normal isobutene is formed even when starting with 1,l-dideute- rioneopentyl iodide indicates that the bond that breaks is that between the a and B carbons. It is also quite likely that at least one dehydrogenation step precedes this C-C cleavage, since a normal kinetic isotope effect is seen for the overall reaction (the peak shifls by about 30 K to higher temperatures in the a-deuterated neopentyl case) Elimination at positions further along the carbon chain, whenever possible, usually yields cyclic prod- u c t  . ' The selectivity for y- versus a-hydride e l i - nation in inorganic compounds depends on the nature of the metal complex. For example, neopentyl tan- talum compounds tend to form stable methylenic species via an a-hydride elimination step,17' but analogous platinum complexes undergo elimination at the y position to yield metallacyclobutane com- pounds instead?38 It has been suggested that y eliminations are favored by low-valence late transi- tion metals.No direct evidence is yet available for y-elimination reactions on surfaces. A recent study has identified the production of isobutene from decomposition of neopentyl moieties on Ni(100),539 which additional isotope labeling experiments showed occurs by dis- sociation of the c-C bond closer to the surface (Figure Since the C-C bond cleavage presumably occurs after a number of a-H elimina- tions, this result suggests that a hydrogens are substantially more reactive than y hydrogens.

The literature discusses the hydrogen abstraction and elimination reactions in alkyl groups. Methyl groups couple with 100% efficiency, likely due to silver's low hydrogen affinity, inhibiting hydride elimination steps. Methyl groups can undergo a-H abstraction to form methylene groups, a process that contrasts with olefin formation in β-elimination reactions. The resulting methylene moiety remains coordinated to the metal and is typically unstable, making isolation difficult. Kinetic data suggest that a-elimination is facile in early transition metal complexes, even in some alkyl moieties with β-hydrogens. A few coordinatively unsaturated methyl complexes can exist in equilibrium with their corresponding methylene hydride isomers, promoting fast H-D exchange. Intermolecular a-hydride abstraction reactions are possible as well. On surfaces, alkyl a-hydride elimination reactions have been observed only in methyl groups, with the conversion to methylene groups established on Pt(ll1) through reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy. Indirect evidence for such reactions in other cases comes from temperature-programmed desorption and photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The multiple H-D exchange in methyl groups on Pt(ll1) suggests an activation barrier of less than 10 kcdmol for dehydrogenation. A fast alkyl-alkylidene equilibrium might be a key step in H-D exchange reactions on alkane surfaces. C-C bond scission occurs in isobutene reactions, producing normal isobutene even from dideuterated neopentyl iodide. Selectivity for α- versus β-hydride elimination depends on the metal complex nature. Neopentyl tantalum compounds tend to form stable methylenic species through α-hydride elimination, while analogous platinum complexes undergo β-elimination to yield metallacyclobutanes. Low-valence late transition metals favor β eliminations, but direct evidence for surface β-elimination reactions is not yet available. A recent study identified isobutene production from neopentyl moieties on Ni(100), occurring by C-C bond dissociation closer to the surface. This result suggests that α hydrogens are substantially more reactive than β hydrogens.

文献探讨了烷基团中的氢抽象和消除反应。甲基团以100%的效率耦合，可能是因为银对氢的低亲和性抑制了氢化物消除步骤。甲基团可以通过a-H抽象形成甲基，这一过程与β消除反应中形成的烯烃形成对比。产生的甲基团仍然与金属配位，通常是不稳定的，因此难以分离。动力学数据表明，在某些含β氢的烷基配体中，a消除是容易的，甚至在早期过渡金属复合物中也是如此。少数协调不饱和的甲基复合物可以与其对应的甲基氢化物异构体处于平衡状态，促进a位置的快速H-D交换。分子间a氢化物抽象反应也是可能的。在表面上，仅在甲基团中观察到a氢化物消除反应，通过反射吸收红外光谱法在Pt(ll1)上建立了甲基转化为甲基的转化。其他情况的间接证据来自温度程序降解和光电子光谱实验。在Pt(ll1)上的甲基的多重H-D交换表明，脱氢化过程的活化势垒小于10 kcdmol。a-H消除可能是一个关键步骤，它在烷烃表面上的H-D交换反应中起作用。C-C键裂解发生在isobutene反应中，即使是从二氘代neopentyl碘化物开始，也仅产生正常isobutene。α-与β-氢消除的选择性取决于金属复合物的性质。neopentyl钽化合物倾向于通过α氢消除形成稳定的甲基化物种，而类似的铂复合物则在β位置进行消除，生成金属环丁烷化合物。低价晚期过渡金属有利于β消除，但尚未在表面上发现直接的β消除反应证据。最近的一项研究在Ni(100)上识别出了neopentyl基团的分解产生isobutene，该过程通过表面的C-C键裂解发生在靠近表面的位置。这一结果表明，α氢远比β氢更活跃。
