What are the key differences between hydrocarbon chemistry on surfaces compared to organometallic complexes?

</questions>

"The similarities in chemical behavior between hydrocarbon ligands in organometallic complexes and hydrocarbon species adsorbed on surfaces can be justified by the localized nature of the chemical bond between the metal atoms and the hydrocarbon moieties on surfaces."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Key differences between hydrocarbon chemistry on surfaces and organometallic complexes include:

1. **Easier Activation**: Unsaturated adsorbates such as olefins are easier to activate on surfaces than on discrete metal complexes.
2. **Conversion of Alkyl Groups**: The conversion of adsorbed neopentyl groups to isobutene is difficult to explain in terms of known organometallic processes.
3. **C-C Coupling and Insertion**: C-C coupling and methylene and olefin migratory insertion reactions are apparently easier with coordinated ligands than with chemisorbed fragments on solid surfaces, particularly under vacuum.
4. **Reaction Selectivity**: Heterogeneous systems catalyze a much larger number of reactions than their organometallic counterparts, but they usually exhibit much poorer selectivity toward any given pathway.

表面与无机配合物中的碳氢化合物化学之间的关键差异包括：

1. **激活更容易**：表面上的不饱和吸附物如烯烃比孤立金属复合物中更容易激活。
2. **烷基团转化**：在表面上转化吸附的正戊基团为异丁烯的反应，很难用已知的无机化学过程来解释。
3. **C-C耦合和插入**：配合物中的配体比固体表面上的化学吸附碎片更容易进行C-C耦合和甲基插入等反应，尤其是在真空条件下。
4. **反应选择性**：异质系统催化了比无机复合物更多的反应，但它们对特定路径的选择性通常要差得多。

Can you explain the mechanism of hydrogenation of ethylene on Pt(111) surface, including the role of ethylidyne and the activation energy for the process?

</questions>

<quotes>
"On the basis of the UHV studies reviewed above, both cyclohexyl and allyl moieties have been proposed as additional intermediates for this reaction. The role of these moieties in the hydrogenation mechanism is still controversial. The idea of ethylidyne being a direct intermediate in the conversion of ethylene to ethane was ruled out by kinetic measurements using 13C- and 14C-labeled compounds, which proved that eth- ylidyne hydrogenates at a rate several orders of magnitude slower than ethylene."

The mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation on Pt(111) surface involves ethylidyne as an intermediate. However, it is not the direct conversion intermediate. Kinetic measurements using 13C- and 14C-labeled compounds showed that ethylidyne hydrogenates at a much slower rate compared to ethylene. The activation energy for this hydrogenation process is about 13 kcal/mol on Pt(111).

乙烯在Pt(111)表面上的氢化机制涉及乙基炔作为中间体。然而，它不是直接转换的中间体。使用13C-和14C标记的化合物进行的动态测量表明，乙基炔的氢化速率远低于乙烯。在Pt(111)上，该氢化过程的活化能约为13 kcal/mol。

What are the main findings regarding the catalytic activity of single-crystal surfaces in hydrocarbon conversion reactions?

</questions>

"In view of this, only the most important conclusions reached so far in terms of mechanisms for hydrocarbon catalytic processes will be summarized here."

The main findings regarding the catalytic activity of single-crystal surfaces in hydrocarbon conversion reactions include:

1. **Dehydrogenation**: Cyclohexane conversion has been extensively studied on platinum, ruthenium, and tungsten single crystals. Benzene is the major product, with smaller quantities of cyclohexene, n-hexane, and other lighter alkanes. The activity and selectivity of dehydrogenation are sensitive to the surface structure, suggesting that reasonably large ensemble sites with specific geometries are involved.
2. **Hydrogenation**: Alkenes are the best known class of hydrogenation reactions. Olefin hydrogenation has been studied on various surfaces including Pt(111), Rh(111), Ni(100), Ni(lll), Ni(l10), Ir(ll1), Ir(l10)-(12), Ru(OOO1), Ru(1,l,-10), Re(OOOl), and W(100), as well as on a few alloys. The studies on ethylene hydrogenation over Pt(ll1) have shown that the active catalytic surface is not clean, but completely covered with a layer of strongly bound hydrocarbon moieties (ethylidyne in the case of ethylene hydrogenation).
3. **Exchange Reactions**: Catalytic exchange of hydrogens for deuteriums in hydrocarbon molecules over single-crystal metals has been studied for a few alkanes on platinum single-crystal surfaces. The kinetic parameters for ethane H-D exchange on Pt(lll) are the same as for polycrystalline foils and supported catalysts. The product distribution displays an U-shape with maxima at the mono and perdeuterated alkanes, strongly arguing for a mechanism where the formation of a common initial intermediate, presumably an alkyl moiety, is followed by two competitive reaction paths.

单晶表面在碳氢化合物转化反应中的催化活性的主要发现包括：

1. **脱氢化**：在铂、钌和钨单晶上进行了大量的环己烷转化研究。苯是主要产物，少量的环己烯、己烷和其他较轻的烷烃。脱氢化活性和选择性对表面结构敏感，表明参与反应的是具有一定几何形状的较大簇集位点。
2. **氢化**：烯烃氢化是最知名的一类氢化反应。各种表面上的烯烃氢化研究包括Pt(111)、Rh(111)、Ni(100)、Ni(lll)、Ni(l10)、Ir(ll1)、Ir(l10)-(12)、Ru(OOO1)、Ru(1,l,-10)、Re(OOOl)和W(100)，以及几种合金。在Pt(ll1)上进行的乙烯氢化研究表明，活性催化剂表面并非干净，而是完全被一层牢固结合的碳氢化合物分子层（乙烯氢化时为乙基炔）覆盖。
3. **交换反应**：单晶金属表面碳氢化合物分子之间氢与氘的催化交换已被研究了几种烷烃。在铂单晶表面上的乙烷H-D交换的动能参数与多晶箔片和负载催化剂相同。产品分布呈U形，最大值位于单氘和全氘烷烃，强烈表明形成一个共同的初始中间体（很可能是一个烷基基团），随后是两条竞争反应路径的过程。
