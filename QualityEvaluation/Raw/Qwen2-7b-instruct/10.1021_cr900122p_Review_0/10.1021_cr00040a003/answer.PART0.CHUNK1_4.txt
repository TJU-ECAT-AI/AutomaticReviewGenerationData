[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction."
[2] "These processes involve the formation of transition states that lower the activation energy for C-H bond cleavage, allowing for the selective oxidation of alkanes."
[3] "For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the isolated metal center acts as a catalyst, lowering the activation energy for the C-H bond cleavage."
[4] "This selective oxidation is achieved by using the appropriate metal center and reaction conditions to promote the desired reaction pathway."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These processes lower the activation energy for C-H bond cleavage, enabling selective oxidation of alkanes. For example, in converting butane to maleic anhydride, an isolated metal center acts as a catalyst, reducing the activation energy for C-H bond cleavage. This selective oxidation is accomplished by employing the correct metal center and reaction conditions to guide the desired reaction pathway.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料上通过Mars van Krevelen和H抽象机制促进C-H键活化。这些过程降低了C-H键断裂的活化能，使烷烃的选择性氧化成为可能。例如，在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，孤立的金属中心作为催化剂作用，降低C-H键断裂的活化能。这种选择性的氧化是通过使用适当的金属中心和反应条件来引导所需反应路径来实现的。
