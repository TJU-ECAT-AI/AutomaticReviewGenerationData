What is the mechanism for the activation of alkanes on metal surfaces?

</questions>

<quotes>
"Most alkanes physisorb on metal surfaces at low temperatures, but they usually desorb molecularly upon heating of the sample;419,420 as mentioned above, alkane chemisorption requires the breaking of at least one C-H bond."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The activation of alkanes on metal surfaces typically involves the breaking of at least one C-H bond, leading to chemisorption. This process is often facilitated by the heating of the sample, which promotes the desorption of the alkane molecule. The chemisorption step is crucial for the activation, requiring the cleavage of a C-H bond.

烷烃在金属表面的激活通常涉及至少断裂一个C-H键，导致化学吸附。这一过程往往通过加热样品来促进，从而促进烷烃分子的脱附。化学吸附步骤对于激活至关重要，需要断裂C-H键。

"It has been suggested that direct alkane activation occurs via a tunneling mechanism.461,465-467 For one,the sticking probability of the alkane often increases monotonically with increasing kinetic energy, it does not display the threshold expected for cases where the kinetics are dominated by an activation barrier (Figure In addition, the observed shifts in the translational energy needed to activate CH4 vs CD4,or C2H6 vs C2D6, are usually on the order of 5 kcaV mol, much larger than the differences in their zero- point energies."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Direct activation of alkanes might occur through a tunneling mechanism. The likelihood of sticking of the alkane molecule often rises steadily with increased kinetic energy, without showing the expected threshold for situations where the kinetics are controlled by an activation barrier (Fig.). Additionally, the observed changes in the translational energy required to activate CH4 compared to CD4, or C2H6 compared to C2D6, are typically around 5 kcal/mol, significantly greater than their zero-point energy differences.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
烷烃的直接激活可能通过隧穿机制发生。烷烃分子的粘附概率通常随着动能的增加而单调增加，但不会显示由激活壁垒主导情况下的预期阈值（图）。此外，激活CH4与CD4，或C2H6与C2D6所需的平移能量变化通常约为5 kcal/mol，远大于它们的零点能差。

What is the mechanism for the activation of alkanes by organometallic compounds?

</questions>

<quotes>
"It is currently believed that the main reason for this difference is that M-C bonds are in general weaker than M-H bonds.449,450 Indeed, oxidative addition is favored in systems where the resulting M-C bond is strong.451"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The main reason for the difference in activation is that metal-carbon (M-C) bonds are generally weaker than metal-hydrogen (M-H) bonds. Oxidative addition is favored in systems where the formed M-C bond is strong.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
激活差异的主要原因在于，金属-碳(M-C)键通常比金属-氢(M-H)键弱。在形成强M-C键的系统中，氧化添加是首选的。

"Although direct evidence for the formation of alkane-metal adducts is not yet available, the initial metal-HC interaction is believed to be agostic. For one, there are a large number of examples of stable complexes containing intramolecular agostic interactions.405 In particular, the characterization of catalytic cyclic dehydrogenation reactions with Ir(H)2(P(p-PhF)&-(OOCCF3)) has led to the isolation of an agostic alkyl"

Direct evidence for the formation of alkane-metal adducts is not yet available, but the initial metal-HC interaction is thought to be agostic. Specifically, stable complexes with intramolecular agostic interactions have been observed. The characterization of catalytic cyclic dehydrogenation reactions with Ir(H)2(P(p-PhF)&-(OOCCF3)) has led to the isolation of an agostic alkyl group.

Can you describe the mechanism of P-H elimination in organometallic complexes and its relationship to the coordination number of the metal center?

</questions>

<quotes>
"One of the key features of the mechanism for j3-hydride elimination is that it leads to an increase in the coordination number of the metal center. The reaction is therefore inoperative in coordinatively saturated compounds: any 18-electron complex has to lose at least one ligand in order to open a site for the elimination products."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
A distinctive aspect of the mechanism for P-H elimination involves an increase in the coordination number of the metal center. This reaction cannot proceed in compounds fully coordinated, meaning that any 18-electron complex must shed at least one ligand to create a site for the elimination products.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
消除P-H键的机制的一个关键特征是金属中心的配位数增加。该反应无法在完全配位的化合物中进行；任何18电子复合物必须舍弃至少一个配体，以创建消除产物的位置。

<quotes>
"The details of the mechanism for 8-H eliminations on metal surfaces have been addressed by a few research groups. An elegant series of experiments using fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have demonstrated the anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in the same way as previously reported for organometallic The positive charge that develops on the 8 carbon in the transition state is also stabilized by electron-donating groups such as alkyls, making the reaction on either propyl or butyl species faster than on ethyl g r 0  p s . S This promo- tion by alkyl substitution at the 8 position was seen tyl."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The specifics of the mechanism for P-H eliminations on metal surfaces have been explored by certain research teams. A series of sophisticated experiments employing fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have shown that the departing hydrogen carries an anionic character, akin to previous findings in organometallic systems. The formation of a positive charge on the 8 carbon in the transition state is also stabilized by electron-donating groups like alkyls, making the reaction proceed more quickly for propyl or butyl species compared to ethyl groups. Substitution at the 8 position by alkyl groups enhances this process.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
消除P-H键的机制在金属表面上的具体细节已经被一些研究小组探讨过。一系列巧妙的实验使用了Cu(ll1)上的氟代丙基组分，揭示了离去氢的阴离子性质，这与之前在有机金属系统中的报道一致。过渡态中第8个碳形成的正电荷也被如烷基这样的电子给体组稳定化，使得丙基或丁基物种的反应速率比乙基组快。在第8位置上通过烷基替换增强了这个过程。
