1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of hydrogen from a metal-bound species to an adsorbed hydrocarbon, while H-abstraction refers to the removal of a hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbon, typically by a more reactive species. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation processes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. For example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the activation of C-H bonds allows for the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, rather than producing other unwanted products.

1.孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上的催化作用通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H抽象等途径促进C-H键活化。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及从金属结合物种向吸附的烃类转移氢原子，而H抽象指的是从烃类中移除一个氢原子，通常由更活泼的物种进行。这些原理在工业上应用于选择性氧化过程，包括丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。例如，在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，激活C-H键允许选择性氧化丁烷为马来酸酐，而不是产生其他不必要的副产品。
