How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature does not contain any quotes specifically addressing the mechanism of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials in heterogeneous catalysis, the involvement of Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms, or the application of these principles in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, particularly in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.
