How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can function as catalysts for C-H bond activation. They facilitate the breakdown of C-H bonds via various mechanisms, such as the Mars van Krevelen pathway. This pathway involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond by a surface-bound metal species. Another key process is H-abstraction, where a hydrogen atom is removed from the substrate molecule. These mechanisms play a critical role in the selective oxidation of alkanes. For example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the metal center on the oxide catalyst enables the breaking of the C-H bonds and the subsequent formation of the desired product.

1. 隔离在氧化物材料上的金属中心可以作为C-H键活化的催化剂。它们通过各种机制，如马尔斯-范克雷文路径，促进C-H键的断裂。这个途径涉及表面结合的金属物种从C-H键中抽取氢原子的过程。另一个关键过程是H抽取，其中从基质分子中移除一个氢原子。这些机制对于烷烃的选择性氧化至关重要。例如，在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，氧化物催化剂上的金属中心使C-H键断裂，并随后形成所需的产物。
