[1] "It is our belief that there is a close relation between organic ligands in organometallic compounds and their counterparts on solid surfaces in terms of both structure and reactivity."
[2] "The vibrational normal modes associated with bonds between surfaces and adsorbates usually display well-defined frequency value."
[3] "Evidence for the formation of alkyl moieties after this bond-scission step comes from a range of techniques, mostly X-ray photoelectron (XPS),static secondary ion mass (SSIMS), and vibrational (HREELS and RAIRS) spectroscopies."
[4] "The alkyl chains initially orient themselves flat on the surface in order to maximize their interaction with the metal, but reorient to a perpendicular configuration at higher coverages, presumably because van der Waals interactions between the hydrocarbon chains dominate in that regime."
[5] "Metal-carbon dissociation energy for gas-phase metal-CH3 fragments ranges from about 30 kcaVmo1 (for Mn and Fe) to 60 kcaYmol (for Ni and Cu)."
[6] "The bond energies for a given metal have similar values regardless of the type of system being studied, whether it is a gas-phase radical, a gas or a liquid organometallic complex, or a hydrocarbon moiety adsorbed on a solid surface, as long as the oxidation state of the metal is not changed."

[12] "Ethylene adsorption normally leads to significant rehybridization toward a single-bond character, and retention of the double-bond character occurs mainly in late transition metals, but this trend can be modified by coadsorption of species such as oxygen or carbon."
[13] "The flat adsorption geometry for acetylene on Pt(ll1) has also been confirmed by ARUPS data."
[14] "The main structural features of inorganic conjugated-alkene complexes can be summarized as follows: (1) the bond between the inner carbon atoms of the diene is shorter than the average of the outer ones; (2) both inner and outer carbon atom pairs are each equidis- tant from the metal; (3) the inner carbons are closer to the metal center; (4) the four carbons are coplanar,with C-C-C bond angles ranging from 114 to 121";and (5) the substituents in the C 1 and C4 positions tend to be twisted out of the four-carbon plane."

Answer: The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, hydrogen abstraction from the C-H bond leads to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate can then undergo further reactions, such as oxidation or rearrangement, leading to the desired products. The H-abstraction mechanism involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond, which can also lead to the formation of a carbocation or other reactive intermediates. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the selective removal of hydrogen atoms from the alkane leads to the formation of the desired organic compound.

Answer: Ethylidyne has been extensively studied in surface science. Techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, static secondary ion mass spectroscopy, vibrational spectroscopy, and more have been used to investigate its properties. Ethylidyne is found to chemisorb with a single-bond character, primarily on late transition metals, and its reactivity is influenced by the presence of other species such as oxygen or carbon.

Answer: The stability of alkyl fragments is maintained by the strong nature of metal-carbon bonds, which are not inherently weak. This stability is contingent upon the absence of decomposition pathways available to the alkyl fragments.

Answer: The synthesis of alkylidynes from olefins involves thermal conversion, decomposition of acetylene, or substitution of existing alkylidyne compounds. The electronic configuration of alkylidynes is debated, but it is believed that they have a sp hybridized carbon atom bonded to all three metal atoms via delocalized molecular orbitals.

Answer: Ethylidyne is characterized by a flat adsorption geometry on surfaces, with its C-C bond standing in a perpendicular configuration to the surface. This orientation is supported by data from photoelectron diffraction experiments and reflects the single-bond character of the ethylidyne moiety.

Answer: Butadiene binds to metal surfaces through a combination of interactions, including a simultaneous donation of electrons from a carbon p orbital perpendicular to the metal d band and a back donation of metal d electrons to an empty carbon p orbital parallel to the surface. This configuration is supported by data from reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction experiments.

Answer: Binding of butadiene in the trans configuration is uncommon but has been observed under certain conditions, both in mononuclear complexes and in clusters. The trans configuration is characterized by a bent structure with the two double bonds aligned in a zigzag pattern.

答案：异质催化中，孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上的催化作用通过Mars van Krevelen机制和氢原子提取机制实现C-H键活化。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及从C-H键提取氢原子形成碳正离子中间体，随后中间体可以进一步发生氧化或重排反应生成所需产物。氢原子提取机制涉及从C-H键提取氢原子，同样导致形成碳正离子或其他活性中间体。这些原理应用于工业中对烷烃的选择性氧化，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，通过选择性去除烷烃中的氢原子生成所需的有机化合物。
