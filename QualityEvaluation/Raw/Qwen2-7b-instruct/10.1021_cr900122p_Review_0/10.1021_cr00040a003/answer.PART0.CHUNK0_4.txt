[1] "Alkyl iodides are commonly used in these studies as precursors for the preparation of alkyl groups on metal surfaces, since the C-I bond is easily activated at temperatures below 200 K."
[2] "An elegant series of experiments using fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have demonstrated the anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in the same way as previously reported for organometallic."
[3] "The positive charge that develops on the 8 carbon in the transition state is also stabilized by electron-donating groups such as alkyls, making the reaction on either propyl or butyl species faster than on ethyl groups."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These processes are utilized in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, alkyl iodides serve as precursors for preparing alkyl groups on metal surfaces. The C-I bond is easily activated at temperatures below 200 K. Experiments using fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) demonstrate the anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen, similar to organometallic reactions. The positive charge on the 8 carbon is stabilized by electron-donating alkyl groups, making the reaction faster on propyl or butyl species compared to ethyl groups.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料上通过Mars van Krevelen和H脱氢等机制促进烷基键的激活，这在异相催化中被用于工业选择性氧化烷烃，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例。在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，使用碘代烷作为在金属表面制备烷基的前体。在低于200K的温度下，C-I键容易被激活。通过在Cu(ll1)上使用氟取代的丙基组实验，证明了离开氢的阴离子性质，类似于有机金属反应。在过渡态中形成的正电荷由电子给体烷基稳定，使得丙基或丁基物种相对于乙基物种的反应更快。
