    How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

    "Dehydrogenation"
    "In the case of cyclohexene, where dehydrogenation to benzene competes with hydrogenation to cyclohexane, the selection between these two paths changes dramatically with total pressure, even if the Hdcyclohexene ratio is kept constant: the production of benzene dominates at low pressures (Torr), but cyclohexane is formed almost exclusively under high pressures (lo2 Torr) (Figure 18)."

    "Hydrogenation"
    "The studies on ethylene hydrogenation over Pt(ll1) have shown that the active catalytic surface in these processes is not clean, but completely covered with a layer of strongly bound hydrocarbon moieties (ethylidyne in the case of ethylene hydrogenation)."

Industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, relies on the use of isolated metal centers on oxide materials to facilitate C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, a metal center accepts a proton from an acid site to form a more reactive intermediate, which then facilitates the breaking of the C-H bond. H-abstraction involves a hydrogen atom being abstracted from an alkane molecule by a metal center, leading to the formation of a radical and a carbocation, which can then proceed to form various products depending on the reaction conditions.

In the context of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, the selective oxidation process is typically carried out over a metal oxide catalyst. The metal oxide provides a surface for the metal active sites, which are isolated from each other by the oxide layer. This isolation prevents the metal from reacting with oxygen directly, thus avoiding unwanted side reactions. Instead, the metal center is exposed to the alkane molecule, facilitating its activation and subsequent oxidation. The metal center accepts a proton from the acidic sites on the oxide material, leading to the formation of a reactive intermediate that breaks the C-H bond in butane. The resulting alkyl radical then reacts with oxygen to form maleic anhydride.

The selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride showcases the application of metal oxide catalysts in industrial processes, demonstrating the effectiveness of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in facilitating C-H bond activation through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction.

工业中选择性氧化烷烃，包括将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程，依赖于在氧化材料上的孤立金属中心促进C-H键活化，通过诸如火星范克雷伦和H抽象等机制。在火星范克雷伦机制中，金属中心从酸性位点接受一个氢离子形成更易反应的中间体，从而帮助打破C-H键。H抽象涉及金属中心从烷烃分子中抽取一个氢原子，导致形成一个自由基和一个碳正离子，根据反应条件，这些可以进一步形成各种产物。

以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例，在此氧化过程中通常使用金属氧化物催化剂。金属氧化物提供了金属活性位点的表面，这些位点被氧化层隔开。这种隔离防止金属直接与氧气反应，避免了不必要的副反应。相反，金属中心暴露于烷烃分子上，促进了其激活和随后的氧化。金属中心从氧化物材料上的酸性位点接受一个氢离子，导致形成一个可反应的中间体，进而断裂丁烷中的C-H键。产生的烷基自由基然后与氧气反应形成马来酸酐。

丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程展示了金属氧化物催化剂在工业过程中的应用，说明了孤立金属中心在氧化材料上通过火星范克雷伦和H抽象等机制促进C-H键活化的能力。
