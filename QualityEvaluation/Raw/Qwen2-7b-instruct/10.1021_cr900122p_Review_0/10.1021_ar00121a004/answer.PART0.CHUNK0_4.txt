[1] "Catalysis of the ammonia synthesis reaction is clearly dependent upon the structural details of the metal surface. The need for atomically rough surfaces containing high-coordination hollowing sites where N2 can dissociate has been revealed."
[2] "Reactions of this type cannot occur on single transition-metal atom molecules that are utilized most frequently in homogeneous catalysis."
[3] "The catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene by Pt and Rh has been shown to occur over an irreducible, carbonaceous overlayer primarily composed of adsorbed ethylidyne."
[4] "It has been suggested that this overlayer serves as a medium through which atomic hydrogen, from H2 dissociation by the metal, is transferred to ethylene, weakly adsorbed on the ethylidyne layer."
[5] "Coadsorbates modify the rates and product distributions of catalytic reactions by blocking sites of high symmetry, by creating new sites, or by charge transfer that changes bonding of reaction intermediates."

Heterogeneous catalysts, particularly for reactions like ammonia synthesis and ethylene hydrogenation, rely heavily on the precise structural characteristics of the metal surfaces. These surfaces often require roughness and high coordination sites to enable effective dissociation and subsequent reaction of molecules like N2 and ethylene. Coadsorbates can influence catalytic activity by blocking or creating new sites, or by facilitating charge transfer that alters bonding of intermediates. For instance, in ethylene hydrogenation, an active layer of ethylidyne forms on the surface, serving as a conduit for hydrogen transfer to ethylene, leading to the formation of ethane. This mechanism is distinct from homogeneous catalysis, where molecular structures might not exhibit the same level of complexity or site specificity.

对于氨合成和乙烷氢化这类反应，异相催化剂主要依赖于金属表面的精确结构特性。这些表面往往需要粗糙性和高协调位点以有效分解分子如N2和乙烷。共吸附物可以通过阻塞或创建新位点，或者通过促进电荷转移改变中间体的结合方式来影响催化活性。例如，在乙烷氢化中，表面形成活性层的乙基炔，作为氢转移到乙烷的通道，导致乙烷的形成。这种机制与均相催化不同，后者中的分子结构可能不会表现出相同的复杂度或位点特异性。
