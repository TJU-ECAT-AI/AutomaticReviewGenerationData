The ammonia synthesis reaction has been studied over iron and rhenium single-crystal surfaces. The synthesis involves the reaction of hydrogen and nitrogen gases at temperatures between 500 and 800 K and pressures up to 20 atmospheres. The surfaces were characterized using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to ensure their cleanliness and to determine their atomic structure. The dissociative adsorption of nitrogen is identified as the rate-determining step, and the activity of the catalyst is significantly influenced by the atomic structure of the surface. The study found that the activity of the iron and rhenium surfaces followed the trend of the sticking coefficient, indicating that nitrogen chemisorption is the rate-limiting step. It was observed that surfaces with high coordination hollows are crucial for the dissociative adsorption of nitrogen. The most active rhenium surface, Re (1121), does not contain atoms with sevenfold coordination, unlike the most active iron surface, Fe (111).

氨合成反应已经在铁和铑单晶表面进行了研究。该合成涉及到氢气和氮气在500至800 K的温度和高达20个大气压下反应。通过低能电子衍射（LEED）和电子发射光谱（AES）对表面进行了表征，以确保其清洁并确定其原子结构。氮的离解吸附被识别为决定性的步骤，并且催化剂的活性很大程度上取决于表面的原子结构。研究发现，铁和铑表面的活性遵循粘附系数的趋势，表明氮化学吸附是限制速率的步骤。观察到具有高协调空穴的表面对于氮的离解吸附至关重要。最活跃的铑表面Re (1121) 不包含七面体协调的原子，而最活跃的铁表面Fe (111) 是如此。
