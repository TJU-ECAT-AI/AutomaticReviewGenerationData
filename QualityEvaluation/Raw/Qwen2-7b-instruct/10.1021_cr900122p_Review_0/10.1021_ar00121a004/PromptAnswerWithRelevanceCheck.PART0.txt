The ammonia synthesis reaction and the catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene are two distinct types of catalytic processes that depend on the structural details of the metal surface. For the ammonia synthesis, reactions occur directly on the metal surface and are sensitive to the local surface structure. Open or rough surfaces that expose sites of high coordination are particularly active. For the hydrogenation of ethylene, a carbonaceous overlayer primarily composed of adsorbed ethylidyne acts as a medium for hydrogen transfer from the metal to ethylene.

In the ammonia synthesis reaction, the high activity of the surface is associated with surfaces having open topography. Theoretical studies have linked the electronic structure of high coordination sites to the observed catalytic activity. The activity of the surface in the ammonia synthesis reaction is influenced by the atomic structure of the surface.

In the case of the catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene, the reaction occurs over an irreducible, carbonaceous overlayer that is primarily composed of adsorbed ethylidyne. It is proposed that this overlayer facilitates the transfer of hydrogen, dissociated by the metal surface, to ethylene that is weakly adsorbed on the ethylidyne layer. This type of reaction can also occur over homogeneous catalysts.

氨合成反应和乙烯的催化氢化是两种依赖于金属表面结构细节的不同类型的催化过程。对于氨合成反应，反应直接在金属表面上进行，并且对局部表面结构敏感。开放或粗糙的表面，暴露第一或第二原子层中的高配位点，显示出特别高的催化活性。对于乙烯的氢化反应，一个不可还原、碳基的覆盖层主要由吸附的乙炔组成，充当了金属释放的氢原子向吸附在乙炔层上的乙烯转移的媒介。

在氨合成反应中，表面的高活性与具有开放拓扑的表面相关联。最近的理论研究将高配位点的电子结构与观察到的催化活性联系起来。氨合成反应的活性受到表面原子结构的影响。

在乙烯的催化氢化过程中，反应发生在由吸附的乙炔组成的不可还原碳基覆盖层上。提出，这个覆盖层通过金属表面释放的氢原子向吸附在乙炔层上的乙烯提供了一种转移机制。这种类型的反应也可以在均相催化剂上发生。

The ammonia synthesis reaction has been studied over iron and rhenium single-crystal surfaces. The synthesis involves the reaction of hydrogen and nitrogen gases at temperatures between 500 and 800 K and pressures up to 20 atmospheres. The surfaces were characterized using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to ensure their cleanliness and to determine their atomic structure. The dissociative adsorption of nitrogen is identified as the rate-determining step, and the activity of the catalyst is significantly influenced by the atomic structure of the surface. The study found that the activity of the iron and rhenium surfaces followed the trend of the sticking coefficient, indicating that nitrogen chemisorption is the rate-limiting step. It was observed that surfaces with high coordination hollows are crucial for the dissociative adsorption of nitrogen. The most active rhenium surface, Re (1121), does not contain atoms with sevenfold coordination, unlike the most active iron surface, Fe (111).

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Heterogeneous catalysts, particularly for reactions like ammonia synthesis and ethylene hydrogenation, rely heavily on the precise structural characteristics of the metal surfaces. These surfaces often require roughness and high coordination sites to enable effective dissociation and subsequent reaction of molecules like N2 and ethylene. Coadsorbates can influence catalytic activity by blocking or creating new sites, or by facilitating charge transfer that alters bonding of intermediates. For instance, in ethylene hydrogenation, an active layer of ethylidyne forms on the surface, serving as a conduit for hydrogen transfer to ethylene, leading to the formation of ethane. This mechanism is distinct from homogeneous catalysis, where molecular structures might not exhibit the same level of complexity or site specificity.

对于氨合成和乙烷氢化这类反应，异相催化剂主要依赖于金属表面的精确结构特性。这些表面往往需要粗糙性和高协调位点以有效分解分子如N2和乙烷。共吸附物可以通过阻塞或创建新位点，或者通过促进电荷转移改变中间体的结合方式来影响催化活性。例如，在乙烷氢化中，表面形成活性层的乙基炔，作为氢转移到乙烷的通道，导致乙烷的形成。这种机制与均相催化不同，后者中的分子结构可能不会表现出相同的复杂度或位点特异性。
