[1] "The combined use of UHV surface analytical tools and the ability to perform catalytic reactions over single-crystal surfaces under conditions that truly approach those of industrial processes have revealed detailed characteristics of these systems hitherto unobtainable."
[2] "The need for atomically rough surfaces containing high-coordination hollowing sites where N2 can dissociate has been revealed."
[3] "It has been suggested that this overlayer serves as a medium through which atomic hydrogen, from H2 dissociation by the metal, is transferred to ethylene, weakly adsorbed on the ethylidyne layer."
[4] "Coadsorbates modify the rates and product distributions of catalytic reactions by blocking sites of high symmetry, by creating new sites, or by charge transfer that changes bonding of reaction intermediates."

1. The use of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface analytical techniques and conducting catalytic reactions on single-crystal surfaces under conditions closely resembling industrial processes has unveiled detailed insights previously unattainable. 

2. For the ammonia synthesis reaction, atomically rough surfaces with high coordination hollow sites where N2 can dissociate are essential.

3. An ethylidyne layer serves as a conduit for the transfer of atomic hydrogen, produced by the dissociation of H2 by the metal surface, to ethylene weakly adsorbed onto the ethylidyne layer. 

4. Coadsorbates alter reaction rates and product distributions by blocking sites of high symmetry, generating new sites, or facilitating charge transfer that alters the bonding of reaction intermediates.

1. 使用超高真空（UHV）表面分析技术以及在接近工业过程条件下对单晶表面进行催化反应，已经揭示了这些系统以前无法获得的详细特性。

2. 对于氨合成反应，需要原子级粗糙的表面，其中N2可以发生分解的高配位空穴位点是必要的。

3. 一个乙炔层作为氢原子从金属表面分解H2后转移到吸附在乙炔层上的乙烯的媒介。

4. 共吸附物通过阻塞高对称性位点、创造新位点或促进改变反应中间体键合的电荷转移来改变反应速率和产物分布。
