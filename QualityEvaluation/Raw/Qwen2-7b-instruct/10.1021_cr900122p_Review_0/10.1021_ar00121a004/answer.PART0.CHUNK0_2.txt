[1] "Catalysis of the ammonia synthesis reaction is clearly dependent upon the structural details of the metal surface."
[2] "The catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene by Pt and Rh has been shown to occur over an irreducible, carbonaceous overlayer primarily composed of adsorbed ethylidyne."
[3] "Coadsorbates modify the rates and product distributions of catalytic reactions by blocking sites of high symmetry, by creating new sites, or by charge transfer that changes bonding of reaction intermediates."

1. The ammonia synthesis reaction's effectiveness is significantly influenced by the precise structure of the metal surface involved. 
2. The catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene over platinum (Pt) and rhodium (Rh) surfaces occurs through a carbonaceous layer primarily consisting of adsorbed ethylidyne.
3. Coadsorbates impact the speed and product distribution of catalytic reactions by inhibiting high-symmetry sites, generating new sites, or facilitating charge transfer that alters the bonding of reaction intermediates.

1. 氨合成反应的有效性很大程度上取决于所用金属表面的具体结构。
2. 铂（Pt）和铑（Rh）表面的乙烯氢化通过一个主要由吸附的乙基炔组成的不可减去的碳质层发生。
3. 共吸附剂通过阻止高对称性位点、产生新位点或促进改变反应中间体键合的电荷转移，影响催化反应的速度和产物分布。
