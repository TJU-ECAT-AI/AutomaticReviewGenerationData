[1] "The role of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis has been well documented. These centers can mediate reactions through mechanisms such as the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway and hydrogen abstraction."

[2] "In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these mechanisms are crucial. For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway is often employed. This involves the oxidative addition of molecular oxygen to the metal center, followed by a hydride abstraction step to generate the desired product."

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a key role in C-H bond activation through mechanisms like the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway and hydrogen abstraction. In industrial applications, particularly in the selective oxidation of alkanes, these mechanisms are essential. For example, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride typically employs the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway. This process starts with the oxidative addition of molecular oxygen to the metal center, followed by a hydride abstraction step to yield the desired product.

1.孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中通过Mars-van-Krevelen途径和氢原子转移等机制在异相催化中的C-H键活化中起关键作用。在工业应用中，特别是烷烃的选择性氧化中，这些机制至关重要。例如，在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，通常采用Mars-van-Krevelen途径。这一过程始于分子氧向金属中心的氧化插入步骤，随后进行氢原子转移步骤以生成所需产物。
