The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride involves isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation. This process utilizes the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. Specifically, the metal centers act as Lewis acids, coordinating with butane molecules and activating the C-H bonds. In the case of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, the selectivity is achieved through the cooperation of a pair of vanadium sites, as supported by experimental observations. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism includes steps such as activation of the substrate on a metallic cation, insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens, and a redox process at the metallic site, where electrons are transferred.

In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, metal oxide catalysts are often employed. For example, vanadium-based systems are widely used for alkane oxydehydrogenation, oxygenations, and alkylaromatic oxidations. These systems can be supported on solid materials, enhancing their stability and reusability. The activity of these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the metal loading, the support material, and the presence of promoters that can alter the nature of the metal species and their catalytic properties.

In the selective oxidation of methane to benzoic acid, a process involving a quaternary ammonium bromide as a phase transfer catalyst is reported. This demonstrates the application of Lewis acid-base interactions in heterogeneous catalysis, where the catalyst facilitates the transfer of electrons between the reactants, accelerating the oxidation process. The quaternary ammonium ion acts as a phase transfer agent, enabling the reaction to proceed in a more efficient manner by creating a more favorable environment for the oxidation reaction to occur.

但烷到马来酸酐的转化涉及氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心促进C-H键活化。此过程利用了马斯范克雷文伦机制和H提取。具体来说，金属中心作为路易斯酸，与但烷分子配位并激活C-H键。在将但烷转化为马来酸酐的情况下，通过两个钒原子的配合来实现选择性，这一观察结果得到了支持。马斯范克雷文伦机制包括以下步骤：在金属离子上激活底物、从晶格氧中插入氧以及在金属离子处进行的还原氧化过程，其中电子被转移。

在烷烃的选择性氧化工业应用中，金属氧化物催化剂经常被使用。例如，钒基系统广泛用于烷烃脱氢、氧化和烷基芳烃氧化。这些系统可以通过固体材料支撑，提高其稳定性和可重复使用性。这些催化剂的活性受因素影响，如金属负载量、支持材料以及促进剂的存在，这些可以改变金属物种的性质及其催化特性。

在甲烷到苯甲酸的选择性氧化过程中，报道了一种使用四元铵溴化物作为相转移催化剂的方法。这表明了路易斯酸-碱相互作用在异质催化中的应用，其中催化剂促进了反应物之间的电子转移，加速了氧化过程。四元铵离子充当相转移剂，通过创建更有利于氧化反应发生的情况，使反应得以更有效进行。
