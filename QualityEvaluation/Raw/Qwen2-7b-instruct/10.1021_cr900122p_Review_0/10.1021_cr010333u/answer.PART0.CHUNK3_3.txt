[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a significant role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. These centers often participate in mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen pathway, where a metal center abstracts hydrogen from a hydrocarbon molecule, leading to bond cleavage. Alternatively, H-abstraction from the metal center can also lead to bond activation. These principles have been applied in industrial selective oxidation reactions, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials enable C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars-van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. These processes are utilized in industrial applications, for instance, in the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride.

The provided text does not contain specific details about isolated metal centers on oxide materials, their mechanisms of C-H bond activation, or their application in the industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. Therefore, the response above is speculative based on general knowledge about metal-catalyzed C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis.
