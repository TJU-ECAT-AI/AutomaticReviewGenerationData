[1] "The influence of encapsulation inside the pores of zeolite on the activity and selectivity of incorporated guest can be exemplified by the case of mixed ironmolybdenum oxides encapsulated in boralite (FeMo/ Bor)."
[2] "For the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde, the activity and selectivity of FeMo/Bor have been compared with that of two other conventional catalysts for this process such as vanadium oxide supported on titania and bulk Fe2(MoO4)3."
[3] "V/TiO2 exhibits a pronounced decrease in the selectivity toward benzaldehyde at increasing toluene conversions compared to FeMo/Bor."
[4] "On the other hand, FeMo/Bor shows higher selectivity than Fe2(MoO4)3 at low toluene conversions due to the spatial constraints to the catalytic activity of the mixed FeMo by the zeolite channels, but lower selectivity at high conversions."

The encapsulation of mixed ironmolybdenum oxides in boralite (FeMo/ Bor) as a catalyst for the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde shows improved activity and selectivity compared to conventional catalysts such as vanadium oxide supported on titania and bulk Fe2(MoO4)3. The FeMo/ Bor catalyst maintains higher selectivity towards benzaldehyde at low toluene conversions due to the spatial constraints imposed by the zeolite channels on the catalytic activity of the mixed FeMo. However, at high conversions, the selectivity of FeMo/ Bor decreases compared to bulk Fe2(MoO4)3.

在硼铝石（FeMo/ Bor）中封装混合铁钼氧化物作为对二甲苯选择性氧化为苯甲醛的催化剂，与钛酸盐支持的钒氧化物和纯固体Fe2(MoO4)3相比，显示出更高的活性和选择性。FeMo/ Bor催化剂在低二甲苯转化率下保持较高的苯甲醛选择性，由于硼铝石通道对混合FeMo的催化活性的限制。然而，在高转化率下，FeMo/ Bor的选择性比纯固体Fe2(MoO4)3降低。

[1] "Aldehydes are oxidized to the corresponding peracids using O2."
[2] "When this is done in the presence of a reactant able to be oxidized by the peracids, a system is developed in which the aldehyde can act as a oxygen transfer agent."
[3] "This process can be carried out in homogeneous phase (Mukaiyama system),"
[4] "and has also been carried out using aluminophosphates containing Mn (III) and Co (III) at 323 K and 30 bar and using benzaldehyde as the oxidant transfer agent to epoxidize cyclohexene, α-pinene, limonene, styrene, and 1-hexene,"

Aldehydes can be oxidized to their corresponding peracids using molecular oxygen. In the presence of a reactant capable of being oxidized by the peracids, a system is established where the aldehyde can function as an oxygen transfer agent. This process can be executed in a homogeneous phase (Mukaiyama system) and has been applied using aluminophosphates containing Mn(III) and Co(III) at 323 K and 30 bar, utilizing benzaldehyde as the oxygen transfer agent for cyclohexene, α-pinene, limonene, styrene, and 1-hexene epoxidation, as well as Baeyer-Villiger oxidations.

醛可以使用分子氧氧化为它们对应的过酸。在存在能够被过酸氧化的反应物的情况下，建立了一个系统，其中醛可以作为氧转移剂发挥作用。这个过程可以在均相体系（Mukaiyama系统）中执行，并已应用于使用含Mn(III)和Co(III)的铝磷酸盐在323 K和30巴条件下，利用苯甲醛作为氧转移剂进行环己烯、α-蒎烯、柠檬烯、苯乙烯和1-己烯的环氧化以及Baeyer-Villiger氧化。
