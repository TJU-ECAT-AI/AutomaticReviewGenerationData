[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction."
[2] "The Mars-van-Krevelen pathway involves the formation of a radical species that abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond."
[3] "H-abstraction occurs when a molecule donates a proton to a reactive intermediate, leading to bond cleavage."
[4] "These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."
[5] "In the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the isolated metal center facilitates the activation of molecular oxygen, which then undergoes a series of reactions to produce maleic anhydride selectively."
