[1] "Transition metals such as copper and iron can be introduced in MCM-41 by ion exchange."
[2] "These mesoporous MCM-41 containing Cu2+ or Fe3+ can act as redox catalysts and can convert N2O into NO at room temperature."
[3] "Fe3+- and Cu2+- exchanged Al/MCM-41 have been found convenient catalysts for the oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol by oxygen or air to form 1,1-binaphthyl (Scheme 23)."
[4] "High conversion and good selectivities have been achieved using Fe-Al/MCM-41."
[5] "FeCl3/SiO2, FeCl3/Al2O3, Fe3+-exchanged montmorillonite, and Fe3+ and Cu2+ exchanged Y zeolite."
[6] "In the latter case, a large fraction of the product formed inside the zeolite cavities cannot diffuse out and remains trapped due to the large molecular size of binaphthyl compared to the windows of Y zeolite (0.74 nm)."
