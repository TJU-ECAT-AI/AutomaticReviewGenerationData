[1] "Very frequently, solids containing transition metals are termed as redox catalysts, but they act in reality as solid Lewis acids."
[2] "The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle."
[3] "A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by forming acid-base adducts either with the substrate or with the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation."
[4] "For instance, similar reaction rates have been measured for the oxidation of methyl p-tolyl sulfide and the corresponding sulfoxide by cumyl peroxide using titanium(IV)-(R,R,R)-tris(2-phenylethoxy)amine as catalyst."
[5] "The presence of just a few equivalents of Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride or aluminum trichloride accelerates considerably the room-temperature oxidation of alkanes with chromate or permanganate."
[6] "It has been found that the process consumes stoichiometric amounts of an acid such as sulfuric acid."
[7] "The study of the effect of bidentate ligands on the olefin epoxidation using molybdenum oxobisperoxo complexes L-LMoO(O2)2 has served to establish the relationship between the Lewis acidity and the catalytic activity for epoxidation."
[8] "Apparently, the anhydride acts as dehydrating agent during the reaction avoiding the interference of the water that is formed as product."
[9] "It is believed that these protons are responsible of the cerium ammonium nitrate-catalyzed methanolysis of allylic and benzylic alcohols."
[10] "In this context, cyclohexane can be oxidized at room temperature by barium ferrate, 126 permanganate,125 chromate125 in a mixture of acetic acid and dichloromethane giving a product distribution containing cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, and cyclohexyl chloride."
[11] "The active oxidation states of supported metal catalysts, such as Cu, Ag, and Au can be discussed by IR spectroscopy, UVVis spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, EXAFS, and electron microscopy."

1. Transition metals in solid form do not function as redox catalysts but rather as solid Lewis acids. This concept is crucial for understanding their role in heterogeneous catalysis. 

2. A catalytic center for oxidation reactions involving transition metals can consist of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that changes its oxidation state throughout the catalytic cycle.

3. A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by creating an acid-base adduct with either the substrate or the oxidizing agent, thereby enhancing their reactivity and functioning as an oxidation catalyst.

4. The reaction rates for the oxidation of methyl p-tolyl sulfide and the corresponding sulfoxide using titanium(IV)-(R,R,R)-tris(2-phenylethoxy)amine as a catalyst are remarkably similar.

5. The addition of Lewis acids like boron trifluoride or aluminum trichloride can significantly speed up the room-temperature oxidation of alkanes with chromate or permanganate.

6. The reaction process requires the consumption of stoichiometric amounts of sulfuric acid.

7. The Lewis acidity of molybdenum oxobisperoxo complexes L-LMoO(O2)2 influences their catalytic activity in olefin epoxidation, establishing a relationship between acidity and catalytic efficiency.

8. The anhydride acts as a dehydrating agent during the reaction, preventing interference from the water produced as a byproduct.

9. The protons produced during the methanol oxidation are thought to be responsible for the cerium ammonium nitrate-catalyzed methanolysis of allylic and benzylic alcohols.

10. Cyclohexane can be oxidized at room temperature using barium ferrate, permanganate, or chromate in a mixture of acetic acid and dichloromethane, yielding a product distribution of cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, and cyclohexyl chloride.

11. The active oxidation states of supported metal catalysts such as copper, silver, and gold can be explored through techniques like infrared spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and electron microscopy.
