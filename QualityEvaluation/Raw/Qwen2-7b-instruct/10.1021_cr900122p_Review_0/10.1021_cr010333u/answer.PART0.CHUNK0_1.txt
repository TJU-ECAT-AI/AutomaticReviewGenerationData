1. Solid transition metals often appear as redox catalysts, but they actually function as solid Lewis acids. This concept applies to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, where the catalytic center is a composite of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom undergoing oxidation state changes throughout the catalytic cycle.

2. The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism involves the activation of the substrate on a metallic cation, the insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens, and a redox process at the metallic site with electron transfer. This mechanism necessitates a specific atomic-level structure and cooperation of distinct atoms for catalysis.

3. The active sites of metallic oxide catalysts that catalyze oxidation reactions through the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism have been comprehensively reviewed recently.

4. The catalytic activities of vanadium-containing solids, notably vanadium phosphates, are discussed in the following sections, with a focus on the relationship between Lewis acid sites and their role in selective oxidation of alkanes.

5. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride occurs specifically on the (1.0.0) face of the crystal.

6. The surface structure of the catalyst undergoes significant changes during the catalytic process.

7. The defects created are oxygen vacancies linking corner-sharing phosphorus tetrahedra and vanadyl octahedra in the active plane.

8. These oxygen vacancies are proposed to play a crucial role in the activation of the alkane, particularly for selective dehydrogenation reactions.

9. The selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is hypothesized to occur specifically on the (1.0.0) face of the crystal.

10. Further discussion on the catalytic activities of vanadium-containing solids, including their Lewis acid sites, is provided in the next section.

11. The oxygen vacancies are suggested to contribute to the activation of the alkane during the selective oxidation process.

12. The process of converting n-butane to maleic anhydride is believed to occur specifically on the (1.0.0) face of the crystal.

13. This explanation implies that oxygen atoms of the catalyst are depleted during the reaction.

14. There is a correlation between maleic anhydride selectivity and the Lewis acidity of the promoter cations and oxide support when considering supported vanadia.

15. The Lewis acid sites do not solely promote oxidation but collaborate with other sites present in the catalyst, contributing to its complex mechanism.
