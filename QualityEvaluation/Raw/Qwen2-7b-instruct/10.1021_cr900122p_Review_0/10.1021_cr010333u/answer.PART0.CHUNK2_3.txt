[1] "Titanium silicalite is the most emblematic example of this type of solid oxidation catalysts."
[2] "The simplest strategy in which the Lewis acid is deposited on a solid surface has evolved to more elaborate ones in which the Lewis site forms part of the solid framework."
[3] "The centers will be designed inspired not only on homogeneous Lewis acids, but also learning from the active centers of enzymes and biomolecules."

1. Titanium silicalite exemplifies solid oxidation catalysts where the Lewis acid site is integrated into the solid framework.

2. The straightforward approach of depositing Lewis acids on surfaces has advanced to more complex designs where the Lewis site is intrinsic to the solid structure.

3. Catalyst design will draw inspiration from both homogeneous Lewis acids and the active sites found in enzymes and biomolecules.
