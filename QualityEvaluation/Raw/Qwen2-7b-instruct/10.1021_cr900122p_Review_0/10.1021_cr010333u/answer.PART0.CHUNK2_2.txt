How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in heterogeneous catalysis, especially for the activation of C-H bonds. The mechanism often involves the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction."

[2] "In the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway, a metal center in the oxide material acts as a Lewis acid, coordinating with a molecule and creating a surface complex. This complex facilitates the activation of the C-H bond through electron donation from the metal to the C-H bond, lowering its energy and making it more susceptible to reaction."

[3] "H-abstraction is another key mechanism, where the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond, leading to the formation of a carbocation or other reactive intermediates. This step is often followed by a subsequent reaction to produce the desired product."

[4] "These principles are applied in the selective oxidation of alkanes. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride involves the selective oxidation of butane to butanal, followed by a decarbonylation step to yield maleic anhydride."

[5] "In this process, isolated metal centers on the oxide catalyst facilitate the activation of the C-H bonds in butane. The metal center acts as a Lewis acid, coordinating with butane and stabilizing the resulting surface complex. This complex then undergoes H-abstraction, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate is then selectively oxidized to butanal, and finally, decarbonylated to produce maleic anhydride."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials in heterogeneous catalysis activate C-H bonds through the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction.

孤立的金属中心在氧化材料中的异质催化中通过Mars-van-Krevelen途径和H摘取激活C-H键。Mars-van-Krevelen途径涉及金属中心作为Lewis酸，与分子配位并形成表面复合物，从而促进C-H键的活化。H摘取是另一种机制，其中金属中心从C-H键摘取氢原子，形成活性中间体。这些原理应用于烷烃的选择性氧化，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。在这个过程中，金属中心激活丁烷中的C-H键，形成表面复合物。这个复合物经过H摘取，产生一个碳正离子中间体。中间体然后被选择性氧化为丁醛，最后脱羰化生成马来酸酐。
