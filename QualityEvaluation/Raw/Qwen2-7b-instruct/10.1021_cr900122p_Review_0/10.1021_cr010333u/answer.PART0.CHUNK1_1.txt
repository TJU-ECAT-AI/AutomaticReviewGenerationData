[1] "Transition metals such as copper and iron can be introduced in MCM-41 by ion exchange."
[2] "Fe3+- and Cu2+- exchanged Al/MCM-41 have been found convenient catalysts for the oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol by oxygen or air to form 1,1-binaphthyl (Scheme 23)."
[3] "High conversion and good selectivities have been achieved using Fe-Al/MCM-41."
[4] "In the latter case, a large fraction of the product formed inside the zeolite cavities cannot diffuse out and remains trapped due to the large molecular size of binaphthyl compared to the windows of Y zeolite (0.74 nm)."

1. Copper and iron can be introduced into MCM-41 through ion exchange.

2. Iron and copper in Al/MCM-41 have proven to be effective catalysts for the oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol.

3. Using Fe-Al/MCM-41 has led to high conversion rates and good selectivities in the reaction.

4. The large size of the product formed within the zeolite cavities, like binaphthyl, often gets trapped inside due to the size disparity with the zeolite's window openings.

1. 铜和铁可以通过离子交换引入到MCM-41中。

2. 铁和铜在Al/MCM-41中的使用证明了它们是2-萘酚氧化偶联的有效催化剂。

3. 使用Fe-Al/MCM-41实现了高的转化率和良好的选择性。

4. 经常有大量在分子大小与沸石窗口相比巨大的产物（如二萘酚）被困在内部，因为它们无法通过沸石的窗口扩散出来。
