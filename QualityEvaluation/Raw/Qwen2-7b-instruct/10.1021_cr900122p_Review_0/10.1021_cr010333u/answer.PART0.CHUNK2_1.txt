How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

[1] "The Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism describes how a metal center on a solid surface activates a C-H bond through a series of steps including abstraction of a hydrogen atom by the metal center, leading to the formation of a radical and a metal-bound alkyl species."
[2] "For the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, a typical example of industrial selective oxidation, the process involves the activation of the C-H bonds in butane by a metal center on a solid catalyst. The metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, creating a radical and a metal-bound alkyl species. This process is crucial for the subsequent oxidation steps to proceed."
[3] "In the context of the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the metal center facilitates the breaking of the C-H bonds in butane, enabling the selective oxidation of the alkane to the desired product."

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars-van-Krevelen process. This involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by the metal center, leading to the formation of a radical and a metal-bound alkyl species. In the case of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, like the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the metal center activates the C-H bonds in butane. It abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, creating a radical and a metal-bound alkyl species, which is essential for the subsequent oxidation steps.

1. 在异相催化中，孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料上的作用通过Mars-van-Krevelen机制来激活C-H键。这一过程涉及金属中心对氢原子的抽取，从而形成自由基和金属绑定的烷基物种。在工业选择性氧化烷烃的情况下，如丁烷转化为马来酸酐，金属中心激活丁烷中的C-H键。它从烷烃中抽取氢原子，形成自由基和金属绑定的烷基物种，这是后续氧化步骤进行的关键。
