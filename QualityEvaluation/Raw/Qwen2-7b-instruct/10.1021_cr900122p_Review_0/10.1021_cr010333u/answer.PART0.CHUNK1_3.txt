[1] "Aldehydes are oxidized to the corresponding peracids using O2. When this is done in the presence of a reactant able to be oxidized by the peracids, a system is developed in which the aldehyde can act as a oxygen transfer agent."
[2] "This process can be carried out in homogeneous phase (Mukaiyama system), and has also been carried out using aluminophosphates containing Mn (III) and Co (III) at 323 K and 30 bar and using benzaldehyde as the oxidant transfer agent to epoxidize cyclohexene, α-pinene, limonene, styrene, and 1-hexene, as well as to carry out BaeyerVilliger oxidations."
[3] "In this process, it is claimed that the solvent and anthraquinone derivative play a crucial role."
[4] "Yields of propylene, based on starting alkyl anthrahydroquinone, of 78% are obtained."
[5] "Anthrahydroquinone is consumed in the first process, but regenerated separately by subsequent hydrogenation."

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied by using metal centers to activate the C-H bonds of alkanes for subsequent oxidation. 

As an example, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride demonstrates this process. The isolated metal centers, possibly supported on oxide materials, act as catalysts to activate the C-H bonds of butane. Through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, the metal centers enable the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride.

2. In the process for converting butane to maleic anhydride, a key aspect is the role of solvents and anthraquinone derivatives. These components play a crucial role in the overall reaction mechanism, facilitating the activation and oxidation of butane.

For instance, the process starts with an alkylated anthrahydroquinone, which is then oxidized using molecular oxygen and the alkylated anthrahydroquinone itself as a reagent. The oxidized anthrahydroquinone serves as a precursor to regenerate the initial anthrahydroquinone through subsequent hydrogenation steps. This cycle allows for the efficient conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, utilizing the solvent and anthraquinone derivative effectively.

In the process, the solvent and anthraquinone derivative are essential in creating an environment conducive to the activation of butane and the subsequent selective oxidation to maleic anhydride. The solvent assists in the distribution of reactants and products, while the anthraquinone derivative functions as both a reactant and a regenerating agent in the catalytic cycle.

1. 单独的金属中心在氧化物材料上可以通过火星范克列文和氢摘取机制促进异相催化作用。在烷烃选择性氧化的工业应用中，这些原则通过使用金属中心来活化烷烃中的C-H键来实现。

以将丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例，展示了这一过程。单独的金属中心，可能支持在氧化物材料上，作为催化剂来活化丁烷中的C-H键。通过火星范克列文和氢摘取机制，金属中心使丁烷的选择性氧化成为可能。

2. 在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，溶剂和蒽醌衍生物的作用至关重要。这些成分在整体反应机制中扮演着关键角色，有助于活化和氧化丁烷。

例如，该过程从烷基化的蒽醌开始，然后使用分子氧和烷基化的蒽醌本身作为反应物进行氧化。氧化后的蒽醌作为初始蒽醌的再生剂，通过后续的氢化步骤进行再生。这个循环允许有效地将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，充分利用溶剂和蒽醌衍生物。

在此过程中，溶剂和蒽醌衍生物对于激活丁烷和随后的选择性氧化到马来酸酐非常重要。溶剂有助于反应物和产物的分布，而蒽醌衍生物则作为反应物和再生剂在催化循环中的关键角色。
