[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction."
[2] "In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane molecule, forming a carbocation intermediate."
[3] "The H-abstraction process involves the metal center acting as a strong electron-withdrawing group, stabilizing the carbocation and promoting its formation."
[4] "These activated carbocations can then undergo further reactions, such as oxygen insertion to form carboxylic acids, or other functional group substitutions."
[5] "For example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the alkane is first activated by the metal center, leading to the formation of a carbocation."
[6] "This carbocation subsequently reacts with oxygen, forming maleic anhydride as the product."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can activate C-H bonds in alkanes through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, creating a carbocation. The H-abstraction process stabilizes the carbocation, facilitating further reactions such as oxygen insertion to form carboxylic acids or other functional groups. For instance, in converting butane to maleic anhydride, the alkane is activated by the metal center, leading to the formation of a carbocation. This carbocation reacts with oxygen to produce maleic anhydride as the product.

孤立的金属中心在氧化材料上可以通过火星范克雷伦机制和H抽象机制激活烷烃中的C-H键。在火星范克雷伦机制中，金属中心从烷烃分子中抽取一个氢原子，形成一个碳正离子中间体。H抽象过程通过使金属中心作为强电子吸电子基团来稳定碳正离子，促进其形成。这些活化的碳正离子可以进一步反应，例如与氧插入形成羧酸或其他功能团。例如，在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，首先通过金属中心活化烷
