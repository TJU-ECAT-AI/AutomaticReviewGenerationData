How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation by acting as Lewis acid sites, promoting the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the alkane molecule. This process often follows the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, where the metal center first abstracts a hydrogen atom, forming a hydride ion and an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical then reacts with molecular oxygen, leading to the formation of the desired product."

[2] "In the case of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, the process involves the selective oxidation of butane. The isolated metal centers on the oxide catalyst provide the necessary acidity for the abstraction of hydrogen from the butane molecule. The resulting alkyl radical reacts with molecular oxygen, forming an alkyl peroxide. This alkyl peroxide then undergoes further oxidation, yielding maleic anhydride as the final product."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through their role as Lewis acid sites, which enable the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the alkane molecule. This process adheres to the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, where the metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom, creating a hydride ion and an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical subsequently reacts with molecular oxygen, leading to the formation of the desired product. 

In the specific case of converting butane to maleic anhydride, the selective oxidation process begins with the selective abstraction of hydrogen from the butane molecule by the isolated metal centers on the oxide catalyst. This results in the formation of an alkyl radical. This alkyl radical then undergoes further oxidation with molecular oxygen, yielding maleic anhydride as the final product.

孤立的金属中心在氧化材料上可以通过充当路易斯酸位点来促进C-H键活化，从而促进烷烃分子中氢原子的抽象。这一过程通常遵循马尔斯-范-克雷维尔机制，其中金属中心首先抽象一个氢原子，形成一个氢离子和一个烷基自由基。然后，烷基自由基与分子氧反应，生成所需的产物。

以将丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例，在这个特定过程中，选择性氧化开始于氧化催化剂上的孤立金属中心对丁烷分子中氢原子的选择性抽象。这导致形成一个烷基自由基。这个烷基自由基随后进一步与分子氧反应，生成马来酸酐作为最终产物。
