[1] "In the case of supported vanadium oxides as catalysts for liquid-phase reactions, the possibility of metal leaching and subsequent homogeneous phase catalysis by the leached metal should be addressed in this type of catalyst."
[2] "For instance, while platinum deposited on alumina forms a platinum compound on the solid surface, the weaker electron acceptor properties of charcoal compared to alumina determines that the species present on charcoal surface is predominantly metallic platinum."
[3] "It has been found that the presence of just a few equivalents of Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride or aluminum trichloride accelerates considerably the room-temperature oxidation of alkanes with chromate or permanganate."
[4] "The reaction mechanism has been firmly correlated to the intermediacy of radical cations generated through electron transfer from the organic compound to sulfated zirconia."
[5] "Among the series of Lewis acids tested, the oxidation rate follows the order AlCl3 > FeCl3 >MgCl2 > LiCl > ZnCl2."

1. The possibility of metal leaching from supported catalysts and the subsequent homogeneous phase catalysis by the leached metal needs to be considered in this type of catalyst. For example, platinum on alumina forms a compound on the surface, while on charcoal, it is predominantly metallic due to the weaker electron acceptor properties of charcoal.

2. Platinum deposited on alumina forms a compound on the surface, while on charcoal, which has weaker electron acceptor properties compared to alumina, the predominant species is metallic platinum.

3. The presence of a few equivalents of Lewis acids like boron trifluoride or aluminum trichloride can significantly speed up the room-temperature oxidation of alkanes using chromate or permanganate.

4. The oxidation process is closely linked to the formation of radical cations through electron transfer from the organic compound to sulfated zirconia.

5. Among the tested series of Lewis acids, aluminum trichloride shows the fastest oxidation rate, followed by iron(III) chloride, magnesium chloride, lithium chloride, and zinc chloride.

1. 在这类催化剂中，需要考虑金属溶解的可能性及其随后在均相相中的催化作用。例如，铂沉积在氧化铝上会在表面形成化合物，而在炭黑上，由于炭黑的电子接受能力较弱，主要形成的物种是金属铂。

2. 铂沉积在氧化铝上会在表面形成化合物，而炭黑（其电子接受能力比氧化铝弱）上的主要物种是金属铂。

3. 几种等量的Lewis酸，如硼酸三氟化物或铝三氯化物的存在，可以显著加速烷烃在铬酸盐或高锰酸钾下的室温氧化。

4. 该氧化过程紧密关联于有机化合物向硫酸锆通过电子转移形成自由基离子的过程。

5. 在测试的系列Lewis酸中，铝三氯化物显示出最快的氧化速率，其次是铁(III)氯化物、镁氯化物、锂氯化物和锌氯化物。
