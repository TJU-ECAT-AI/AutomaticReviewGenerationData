Answer: In heterogeneous catalysis, isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves a series of steps where the substrate is activated on a metal cation, oxygen is inserted from lattice oxygens, and a redox process occurs at the metal site. The cooperation of acid-base and redox sites is essential for catalysis. 

Specifically, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the reaction occurs on the (1.0.0) face of the crystal. Oxygen vacancies at sites linking corner-sharing phosphorus tetrahedra and vanadyl octahedra in the active plane are created during the catalytic process. These defects play a crucial role in the activation of the alkane, particularly for selective dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid centers formed at these oxygen vacancy sites abstract electrons from electron-rich molecules, facilitating the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride.

The selectivity for the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is more efficient at sites with more than one vanadium atom. This suggests that the cooperative action of multiple vanadium sites enhances the catalytic efficiency. The surface coverage of vanadium oxide also impacts the selectivity toward maleic anhydride. As the vanadium oxide coverage approaches monolayer coverage, the selectivity toward maleic anhydride increases, indicating that a single site is sufficient for n-butane oxidation while a pair of vanadium sites is required for maleic anhydride formation.

In summary, isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These mechanisms are illustrated in the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, where the cooperative action of multiple vanadium sites and the surface coverage of vanadium oxide play critical roles in the catalytic process.

答案：在异质催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen和H抽象等机制促进C-H键活化。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及一系列步骤，其中底物在金属阳离子上被激活，氧从晶格氧插入，然后在金属位点进行还原氧化过程。酸碱和氧化还原位点的合作对于催化至关重要。

具体来说，在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，反应发生在晶体的（1.0.0）面上。在活性平面中，磷四面体和钒八面体之间的角共享磷四面体处形成的氧空位在催化过程中产生。这些缺陷在烷基激活中起着关键作用，特别是对于选择性脱氢反应。氧空位位点形成的Lewis酸中心从电子丰富的分子中提取电子，促进丁烷转化为马来酸酐的氧化。

马来酸酐的选择性在具有多个钒原子的位点更高。这表明多个钒原子位点的协同作用增强了催化效率。钒氧化物覆盖度也影响马来酸酐的选择性。当钒氧化物覆盖度接近单层覆盖度时，马来酸酐的选择性增加，表明单个位点足以进行n-丁烷氧化，而两个钒位点则需要形成马来酸酐。

综上所述，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen和H抽象等机制在异质催化中促进C-H键活化。这些机制在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的选择性氧化中得到说明，其中多个钒位点的协同作用和钒氧化物覆盖度对催化过程起到关键作用。
