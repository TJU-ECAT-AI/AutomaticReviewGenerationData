Aluminas with different preparation methods exhibit varying activities in chemical reactions. Alumina V, prepared from aluminium sulfate with urea, shows high activity in the isomerization of 1-butene. Meanwhile, alumina III or II, prepared from aluminium nitrate with ammonia or urea, demonstrates the highest activities for hydrogen exchanges between ethylene or cyclopropane and deuterium.
