[1] "Among eleven kinds of aluminas, alumina V prepared from aluminium sulfate with urea exhibited a pronounced activity for the isomerization of 1-butene, while alumina III or II prepared from aluminium nitrate with ammonia or urea showed the highest activities for the exchange reactions between ethylene or cyclopropane and deuterium, respectively."

The study highlights the differing activities of various aluminas in specific chemical reactions. Alumina V, made from aluminum sulfate with urea, was highly active in the isomerization of 1-butene. Conversely, alumina III or II, produced from aluminum nitrate with ammonia or urea, demonstrated the highest activities in hydrogen exchanges between ethylene or cyclopropane and deuterium.
