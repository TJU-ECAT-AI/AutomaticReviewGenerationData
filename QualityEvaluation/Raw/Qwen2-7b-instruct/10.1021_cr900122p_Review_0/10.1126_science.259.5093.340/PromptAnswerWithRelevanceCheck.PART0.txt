[1] "Under the reaction conditions, 1 readily decomposes to CH30SO3H and the reduced mercurous species, Hg22"
[2] "The primary steps of the Hg(ll)- catalyzed reaction were individually examined and the essential elements of the mech- anism were identified."
[3] "The Hg(ll) ion reacts with methane by an electrophilic displacement mechanism to produce an observable species, CH3HgOSO3H, 1."
[4] "The catalytic cycle is completed by the reoxidation of Hg22+ with H2S04 to re- generate Hg(ll) and byproducts S02 and H20."
[5] "This unreactivity has been found to be the case."
[6] "Only with extremely reactive species,such as protons in "superacid" media (SbF5/ HF), are reactions with methane observed at lower temperatures."
[7] "Given the low proton affin- ity and acidity of methane, it would not be expected that reaction of typical acids or bases with methane would occur at temper- atures lower than those of radical processes."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The activation of methane is proposed to occur through a net electrophilic displacement reaction with mercuric bisulfate to produce methyl mercuric bisulfate, 1. This species then decomposes to the product and the reduced species, mercurous bisulfate, in the functionalization step. In the reoxidation step, the mercurous bisulfate is oxidized by sulfuric acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate.

[1] "Three key steps in the catalytic sequence have been established."

[3] "The identity of intermediate 1 was confirmed by comparison to a sample prepared independently by treatment of dimethyl mercury with one equivalent of sulfuric acid (Eq. 6)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The catalytic sequence of the mercury-catalyzed oxidation of methane to methanol involves three key steps. Scheme 2 illustrates the working model based on the available data. Intermediate 1, which is produced by the activation step, was confirmed by direct observations using 13C (and 99Hg) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Independent reactions of 1 with H2SO4 also confirmed the occurrence of protolysis, the microscopic reverse of the activation step, leading to the production of Hg(OSO3H)2 and methane.

[1] "We describe the use of Hg(II) to catalyze the selective oxidation of methane to methanol, through methyl bisulfate, in high yield, -43% (9)."
[2] "The reaction occurs under mild conditions (180°C) with reagents that can potentially be used on a large scale."
[3] "The keys to this discovery are the novel use of Hg(II) as a catalyst for the oxidation of methane through an electro-philic displacement reaction (10) and the production of the monomethyl ester of sulfuric acid, methyl bisulfate, as a methanol precursor that is less reactive than methane."
[4] "We have found that the stoichiometric reaction of methane with mercuric triflate in triflic acid at 180°C results in an almost quantitative yield of methyl triflate based on added mercuric triflate (20)."
[5] "Moreover, in this solvent the reaction is catalytic in mercuric ions, with sulfuric acid playing the role of oxidant."
[6] "Consistent with the high yield of methyl bisulfate, control experiments have shown that the rate of oxidation of methyl bisulfate by the Hg(II)-sulfuric acid system is less than the rate of oxidation of methane."
[7] "Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analyses of isolated samples of methanol produced from '3C-enriched methane confirmed that the methanol is produced from the oxidation of methane (and not some carbon-containing contaminant)."
[8] "The conversion of methane to methanol with the concomitant reduction of sulfuric acid to sulfur dioxide (Eqs. 4 and 5) cannot, as such, be the basis for an economical synthesis of methanol."
[9] "However, sulfuric acid is the single largest commodity chemical produced in the world today and is prepared from the oxidation of sulfur dioxide. Thus, the technology for the reoxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid (through sulfur trioxide) with air (20% oxygen) is practiced on a large scale and is relatively inexpensive."
[10] "By combining this step with reactions shown in Eqs. 4 and 5, a potentially practical process can be described. Such an integrated scheme is shown in Scheme 1."

The mercury-catalyzed system for the oxidation of methane to methanol operates under mild conditions (180°C) and utilizes reagents that can potentially be scaled up for industrial use. The catalyst, mercuric ions (Hg(II)), facilitates an electro-philic displacement reaction with methane, leading to the formation of methyl bisulfate as a precursor to methanol. This system shows high efficiency, with 85% selectivity to methyl bisulfate at a 50% methane conversion rate. The process involves the reaction of methane with mercuric triflate in triflic acid, yielding methyl triflate and mercurous triflate. The sulfuric acid plays a dual role as both an oxidant and a medium for the catalytic cycle. The rate of oxidation of methyl bisulfate is slower than that of methane, indicating a selective process. Methanol produced from this system is confirmed to originate from the oxidation of methane, not contaminants. An integrated scheme combining the steps of sulfur dioxide re-oxidation and the methane oxidation process allows for a potentially practical synthesis of methanol.

汞催化系统在温和条件下（180°C）运行，利用可放大工业使用的试剂。汞离子（Hg(II)）通过电-磷基置换反应促进甲烷氧化，生成甲基硫酸作为甲醇前体。该系统表现出高效率，在50%甲烷转化率下，甲基硫酸选择性达到85%。此过程涉及甲烷与三氟甲磺酸汞反应，产生甲基三氟甲磺酸和二价汞。硫酸在催化循环中扮演双重角色，既是氧化剂又是介质。甲基硫酸的氧化速率低于甲烷，表明这是一个选择性过程。从这个系统产生的甲醇确实来源于甲烷的氧化，而非杂质。通过结合二氧化硫的重新氧化步骤和甲烷氧化过程的步骤，可以描述一个潜在实用的甲醇合成方法。

[2] "The reaction is quite efficient and, to our knowledge, unprecedented. In batch reac- tions, methane conversions as high as 50% at 85% selectivity to methyl bisulfate (43% yield; the major side product is carbon dioxide) and molar productivity rates of 1O-7 mol cm-3 s-1 with Hg(II) turnover frequencies of 10-3 s-' have been observed (21)."

1. The discovery relies on the innovative use of Hg(II) as a catalyst for the electro-philic displacement reaction in the oxidation of methane. The monomethyl ester of sulfuric acid, methyl bisulfate, serves as a less reactive precursor to methanol, which is produced via hydrolysis.
2. The system is highly efficient, with methane conversions reaching up to 50% at a 43% yield, selective conversion to methyl bisulfate at 85%, and a high molar productivity rate of 10^-7 mol/cm^3/s with a Hg(II) turnover frequency of 10^-3/s.
3. The methyl bisulfate generated can be easily hydrolyzed to produce methanol, which can then be isolated through distillation.
4. The overall transformation enables the selective oxidation of methane to methanol using molecular oxygen.
5. The intermediate 1 was confirmed by synthesizing it independently through the reaction of dimethyl mercury with sulfuric acid, yielding CH3HgOSO3H and CH4.
6. Further confirmation of intermediate 1's existence was achieved by reacting it with H2SO4, leading to the reverse reaction (protolysis) that produces Hg(OSO3H)2 and methane.
