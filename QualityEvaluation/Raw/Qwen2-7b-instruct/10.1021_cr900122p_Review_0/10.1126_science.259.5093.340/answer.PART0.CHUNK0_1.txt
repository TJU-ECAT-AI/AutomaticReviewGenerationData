The catalytic sequence of the mercury-catalyzed oxidation of methane to methanol involves three key steps. Scheme 2 illustrates the working model based on the available data. Intermediate 1, which is produced by the activation step, was confirmed by direct observations using 13C (and 99Hg) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Independent reactions of 1 with H2SO4 also confirmed the occurrence of protolysis, the microscopic reverse of the activation step, leading to the production of Hg(OSO3H)2 and methane.

催化序列中的三个关键步骤是甲烷汞催化氧化为甲醇的过程。基于可用数据的运行模型如方案2所示。通过直接观察使用13C（和99Hg）核磁共振光谱学，确认了由激活步骤产生的中间体1。独立反应1与H2SO4也证实了反向激活步骤的微观过程脱质子化，产生了Hg(OSO3H)2和甲烷。
