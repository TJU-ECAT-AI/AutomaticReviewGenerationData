[1] "The keys to this discovery are the novel use of Hg(II) as a catalyst for the oxidation of methane through an electro- philic displacement reaction (10) and the production of the monomethyl ester of sul- furic acid, methyl bisulfate, as a methanol precursor that is less reactive than meth- ane."
[2] "The reaction is quite efficient and, to our knowledge, unprecedented. In batch reac- tions, methane conversions as high as 50% at 85% selectivity to methyl bisulfate (43% yield; the major side product is carbon dioxide) and molar productivity rates of 1O-7 mol cm-3 s-1 with Hg(II) turnover frequencies of 10-3 s-' have been observed (21)."
[3] "The methyl bisulfate solution produced in the reaction can be readily hydrolyzed (Eq. 5) and the metha- nol can be isolated by distillation:"
[4] "The net transformation of the established steps is the selective oxidation ofmethane to meth- anol with molecular oxygen."
[5] "The identity of intermediate 1 was con- firmed by comparison to a sample prepared independently by treatment of dimethyl mercury with one equivalent of sulfuric acid (Eq. 6): Hg(CH3)2 + H2S04 -* CH3HgOSO3H + CH4"
[6] "Independent reactions of 1 with H2S04 con- firmed that protolysis, the microscopic reverse of the activation step,occurs at 1800 to produce Hg(OSO3H)2 and methane."

1. The discovery relies on the innovative use of Hg(II) as a catalyst for the electro-philic displacement reaction in the oxidation of methane. The monomethyl ester of sulfuric acid, methyl bisulfate, serves as a less reactive precursor to methanol, which is produced via hydrolysis.
2. The system is highly efficient, with methane conversions reaching up to 50% at a 43% yield, selective conversion to methyl bisulfate at 85%, and a high molar productivity rate of 10^-7 mol/cm^3/s with a Hg(II) turnover frequency of 10^-3/s.
3. The methyl bisulfate generated can be easily hydrolyzed to produce methanol, which can then be isolated through distillation.
4. The overall transformation enables the selective oxidation of methane to methanol using molecular oxygen.
5. The intermediate 1 was confirmed by synthesizing it independently through the reaction of dimethyl mercury with sulfuric acid, yielding CH3HgOSO3H and CH4.
6. Further confirmation of intermediate 1's existence was achieved by reacting it with H2SO4, leading to the reverse reaction (protolysis) that produces Hg(OSO3H)2 and methane.

1. 发现依赖于汞离子（II）作为甲烷氧化电亲核取代反应催化剂的创新使用。甲基硫酸酯的一元甲酯作为比甲烷更不活泼的甲醇前体，通过水解产生甲醇。
2. 系统非常高效，甲烷转化率可达50%，产率为43%，选择性转化为甲基硫酸酯为85%，并具有高摩尔产率速率10^-7 mol/cm^3/s和Hg(II)周转频率10^-3/s。
3. 产生的甲基硫酸酯可以容易地水解以生成甲醇，然后通过蒸馏分离。
4. 总体转换允许在分子氧存在下选择性氧化甲烷到甲醇。
5. 中间体1通过独立合成，即二甲基汞与硫酸的反应，产生了CH3HgOSO3H和CH4，得到了确认。
6. 进一步确认中间体1的存在是通过将其与H2SO4反应实现的，导致反向反应（脱质子化）产生Hg(OSO3H)2和甲烷。
