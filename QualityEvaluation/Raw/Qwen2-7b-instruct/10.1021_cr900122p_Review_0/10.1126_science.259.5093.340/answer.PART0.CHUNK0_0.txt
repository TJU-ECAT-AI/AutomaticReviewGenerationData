[1] "Under the reaction conditions, 1 readily decomposes to CH30SO3H and the reduced mercurous species, Hg22"
[2] "The primary steps of the Hg(ll)- catalyzed reaction were individually examined and the essential elements of the mech- anism were identified."
[3] "The Hg(ll) ion reacts with methane by an electrophilic displacement mechanism to produce an observable species, CH3HgOSO3H, 1."
[4] "The catalytic cycle is completed by the reoxidation of Hg22+ with H2S04 to re- generate Hg(ll) and byproducts S02 and H20."
[5] "This unreactivity has been found to be the case."
[6] "Only with extremely reactive species,such as protons in "superacid" media (SbF5/ HF), are reactions with methane observed at lower temperatures."
[7] "Given the low proton affin- ity and acidity of methane, it would not be expected that reaction of typical acids or bases with methane would occur at temper- atures lower than those of radical processes."

The activation of methane is proposed to occur through a net electrophilic displacement reaction with mercuric bisulfate to produce methyl mercuric bisulfate, 1. This species then decomposes to the product and the reduced species, mercurous bisulfate, in the functionalization step. In the reoxidation step, the mercurous bisulfate is oxidized by sulfuric acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate.

甲烷的激活被提议通过净亲电取代反应与汞(II)硫酸盐发生，产生甲基汞硫酸盐，1。此物种随后在功能化步骤中分解为产物和还原物种，汞(II)硫酸盐。在氧化步骤中，汞(II)硫酸盐被硫酸氧化，再生汞(II)硫酸盐。
