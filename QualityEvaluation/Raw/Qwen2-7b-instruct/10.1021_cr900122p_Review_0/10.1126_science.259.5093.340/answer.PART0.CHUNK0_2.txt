[1] "Under the reaction conditions, 1 readily decomposes to CH30SO3H and the reduced mercurous species, Hg22"
[2] "The working model based on the available data is shown in Scheme 2."
[3] "Our observations do not imply that Hg(OSO3H)2 is the species that activates methane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The decomposition of intermediate 1 proceeds to form CH30SO3H and Hg22+. The activated model for the reaction is illustrated in Scheme 2. Our findings suggest that Hg(OSO3H)2 is not the direct activating species for methane.

在反应条件下，中间体1迅速分解为CH30SO3H和Hg22+。根据可用数据建立的工作模型如方案2所示。我们的观察结果表明，Hg(OSO3H)2不是直接激活甲烷的物种。
