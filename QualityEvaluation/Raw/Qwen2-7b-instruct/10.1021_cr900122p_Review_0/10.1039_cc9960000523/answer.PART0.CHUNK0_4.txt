[1] "The CH4/D2 exchange reaction is used as an indication of methane activation over potential oxide catalysts; Ga2O3 exhibits an exchange rate over two orders of magnitude higher than other simple oxides and this approach leads to the identification of Ga203/Mo03 as a selective catalyst for methane partial oxidation to methanol."
[2] "We have now successfully addressed this problem and have used the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a predictive catalyst design parameter."
[3] "Most noteworthy is that the rate of methane/deuterium exchange over gallium oxide is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than for any other oxide, with ZnO and chromia also showing high activity."
[4] "On the basis of these findings we considered that Ga203 could be a useful component of selective methane oxidation catalysts."
[5] "Previously we have studied the stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides and have shown that a correlation exists between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction."
[6] "From these studies we identified Moo3 as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, but was known to activate dioxygen."
[7] "To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h]."
[8] "Ga203, Moo3 and the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture were then used separately as methane oxidation catalysts in a silica-lined stainless-steel microreactor at 15 bar using a reaction mixture of CH4 : O2 : He = 23 :2 :5 with a total gas hourly space velocity of 5000 h-1."
[9] "The experimental results are shown in Table 1 and it is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

Industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, often relies on the ability of isolated metal centers on oxide materials to facilitate C-H bond activation. In heterogeneous catalysis, this typically involves mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes. Metal centers on oxide materials can act as electron donors or acceptors, enabling the cleavage of C-H bonds through the formation of radicals or carbocations. 

For instance, in the context of the CH4/D2 exchange reaction over Ga2O3, it was found that gallium oxide exhibits an exceptionally high exchange rate compared to other simple oxides, making it a promising catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane to methanol. The high activity of Ga2O3 suggests its potential role in the initial activation of methane by polarizing a C-H bond. This principle is further illustrated in the study where a physical mixture of Ga2O3 and MoO3 was found to enhance the rate of methanol formation during methane oxidation, indicating that the combination of these oxides could lead to the design of novel high activity catalysts for the selective oxidation of alkanes.

These findings underscore the importance of understanding the role of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in C-H bond activation, as well as the potential for combining different oxide components to optimize catalytic performance in industrial applications. The principles derived from studying the CH4/D2 exchange reaction and the behavior of Ga2O3 and MoO3 offer insights into designing catalysts that efficiently convert alkanes into desired products with high selectivity.

工业上对烷烃的选择性氧化，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，通常依赖于氧化物材料上孤立金属中心在异相催化中的C-H键活化能力。这通常涉及到Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象等机制。在氧化物材料上的金属中心可以作为电子供体或受体，通过形成自由基或碳正离子来裂解C-H键。

例如，在使用Ga2O3进行CH4/D2交换反应时，发现镓氧化物的交换速率远高于其他简单氧化物，使其成为甲烷部分氧化至甲醇的理想催化剂。Ga2O3的高活性表明它在最初激活甲烷以极化C-H键方面的潜力。进一步的研究中，发现由Ga2O3和MoO3组成的物理混合物能够显著提高甲醇形成速率，表明这些氧化物的结合可用于设计新型高活性催化剂，用于烷烃的选择性氧化。

这些发现强调了理解氧化物材料上孤立金属中心在C-H键活化中的作用的重要性，以及组合不同氧化物成分优化催化性能的可能性。从研究CH4/D2交换反应以及Ga2O3和MoO3的行为中得出的原则为设计高效选择性生成所需产物的催化剂提供了见解。
