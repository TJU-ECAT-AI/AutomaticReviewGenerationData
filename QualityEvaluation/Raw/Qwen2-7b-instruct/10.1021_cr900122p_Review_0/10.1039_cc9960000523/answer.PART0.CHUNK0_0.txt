[3] "We have now successfully addressed this problem and have used the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as an indication of methane activation over simple oxides, since the initial activation of methane and oxygen are key elementary steps in the overall oxidation process."

[5] "On the basis of these findings we considered that Ga203 could be a useful component of selective methane oxidation catalysts."
[6] "To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h]."
[7] "It is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

The high activity of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) in methane activation is significant because they are preferred catalyst components for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process. These oxides, along with H-ZSM-5, are used in the direct oxidation of methane to methanol. Gallium oxide is considered a useful component for selective methane oxidation catalysts due to its ability to improve methane activation. A physical mixture of Ga2O3 and molybdenum oxide (MoO3), with a mole ratio of 1:1, was prepared by grinding the oxides together and calcining them at 650°C for 3 hours. This mixture significantly enhanced the rate of methanol formation compared to individual Ga2O3 and MoO3 catalysts. The high activity of Ga2O3 and ZnO in methane activation is attributed to their ability to polarize C-H bonds, facilitating C-H bond cleavage in heterogeneous catalysis. This principle is applied in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

孤立金属中心在氧化物材料中的作用如何促进异相催化中的C-H键活化，涉及哪些机制（如Mars van Krevelen和H抽象），以及这些原则是如何应用于工业中选择性烷烃氧化的，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例？

镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和锌氧化物（ZnO）在甲烷激活方面的高活性意义重大，因为它们是丙烷和丁烷在Cyclar过程中进行芳香化反应的首选催化剂成分。这些氧化物与H-ZSM-5一起用于直接甲烷氧化至甲醇。镓氧化物被认为是有用的甲烷氧化催化剂成分之一，因为它能够改善甲烷的激活。通过将镓氧化物和钼氧化物（MoO3）研磨混合并在650°C下煅烧3小时制备了一种物理混合物，其摩尔比为1:1。这种混合物显著提高了甲醇的形成速率，与单独的Ga2O3和MoO3催化剂相比。Ga2O3和ZnO在甲烷激活方面的高活性归因于它们能够极化C-H键，从而促进异相催化中的C-H键断裂。这一原理应用于工业中选择性烷烃氧化，例如丁烷转化为马来酸酐。
