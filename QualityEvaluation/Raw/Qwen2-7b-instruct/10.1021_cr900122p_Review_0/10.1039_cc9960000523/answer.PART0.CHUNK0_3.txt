[1] "The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalysts components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process."
[2] "Previously we have studied the stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides and have shown that a correlation exists between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction."
[3] "From these studies we identified Moo3 as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, but was known to activate dioxygen."
[4] "To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h]."
[5] "Ga203, Moo3 and the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture were then used separately as methane oxidation catalysts in a silica-lined stainless-steel microrector at 15 bar using a reaction mixture of CH4 : O2 : He = 23 :2 :5 with a total gas hourly space velocity of 5000 h-1."
[6] "The experimental results are shown in Table 1 and it is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as converting butane to maleic anhydride, by utilizing the high reactivity of these metal centers to activate and subsequently oxidize the alkane molecules efficiently.

2. In the context of this document, Ga203 and ZnO, when used in combination with H-ZSM-5, are preferred catalyst components for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process. This indicates their capability to enhance the activation and transformation of alkanes into desired products under specific conditions.

3. Methanol's stability towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over certain oxide catalysts, including MoO3, is crucial for the effectiveness of these catalysts in alkane oxidation reactions. The correlation between the rate of methanol oxidation and its '*02/1602 exchange reaction highlights the importance of this property in selecting suitable catalysts for alkane conversion processes.

4. The study aimed to investigate whether the inclusion of Ga203 as a catalyst component could improve methane activation. To achieve this, a physical mixture of Ga203 and MoO3 with a mole ratio of 1:1 was prepared and tested as a methane oxidation catalyst.

5. Ga203, MoO3, and their physical mixture were tested separately as methane oxidation catalysts under controlled conditions. The experimental setup involved using a silica-lined stainless-steel microreactor at 15 bar with a reaction mixture of CH4 : O2 : He = 23 :2 :5, and a total gas hourly space velocity of 5000 h-1.

6. The results demonstrated that while both Ga203 and MoO3 showed low selectivities for methanol formation, the physical mixture of these oxides significantly enhanced the rate of methanol formation. This finding supports the hypothesis that combining Ga203 with MoO3 could lead to the development of high-activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane.

1. 在异相催化中，孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上的活性通过火星-范克里夫恩途径和H-抽象机制促进C-H键活化。这些原则应用于工业中选择性氧化烷烃，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，通过利用这些金属中心的高度反应性有效地激活并氧化烷烃分子。

2. 在此文档的背景下，Ga203和ZnO与H-ZSM-5结合，作为丙烷和丁烷在Cyarar过程中芳香化的首选催化剂成分。这表明它们有能力增强烷烃的激活和转化为所需产品的能力，在特定条件下。

3. 在某些氧化物催化剂上，甲醇在高温度下的稳定性，包括MoO3，对于这些催化剂在烷烃氧化反应中的有效性至关重要。甲醇氧化率与其'*02/1602交换反应速率之间的相关性强调了这种性质在选择适合烷烃转换过程的催化剂时的重要性。

4. 研究旨在调查是否可以通过将Ga203作为催化剂成分来改善甲烷的激活。为了实现这一目标，准备了Ga203和MoO3的物理混合物，其摩尔比为1:1，并作为甲烷氧化催化剂进行了测试。

5. Ga203、MoO3及其物理混合物分别在受控条件下作为甲烷氧化催化剂进行了测试。实验设置包括使用一个包含CH4 : O2 : He = 23 :2 :5的反应混合物的SiO2涂层不锈钢微反应器，在15 bar下工作，以及总气体小时流速为5000 h-1。

6. 结果显示，尽管Ga203和MoO3显示出较低的甲醇选择性，但这两者的物理混合物显著提高了甲醇形成的速率。这一发现支持了这样一个假设：将Ga203与MoO3结合可以导致开发出高活性催化剂，用于部分氧化甲烷。
