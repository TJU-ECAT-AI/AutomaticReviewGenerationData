          [1] "Most effort has been given to the oxidative coupling reaction,' but more recently there has been some success in the synthesis of catalysts active for the direct oxidation of methane to meth- anoL2"
          [2] "A number of approaches have been made concerning the identification of suitable catalysts3 but, to date, none has proved to be useful in a predictive manner."
          [3] "We have now successfully addressed this problem and have used the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as an indication of methane activation over simple oxides, since the initial activation of methane and oxygen are key elementary steps in the overall oxidation process."
          [4] "The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process.'"
          [5] "On the basis of these findings we considered that Ga203 could be a useful component of selective methane oxidation catalysts."
          [6] "To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h]."
          [7] "It is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

          Efforts have primarily focused on oxidative coupling reactions, but recent advancements have led to the successful synthesis of catalysts capable of directly oxidizing methane to methanol. Initially, identifying suitable catalysts was challenging, as no approach has proven effective for prediction. The CH4/D2 exchange reaction has been utilized as an indicator of methane activation over simple oxides, highlighting the importance of the initial activation steps in the overall oxidation process. Gallium oxide (Ga203) and zinc oxide (ZnO) have demonstrated high activity in methane oxidation, making them preferred catalyst components alongside H-ZSM-5 for the aromatization of propane and butane in the Cyclar process. Based on these findings, gallium oxide is considered a useful addition to selective methane oxidation catalysts. To test the hypothesis that gallium oxide improves methane activation, a physical mixture of gallium oxide and molybdenum oxide (MoO3) was prepared, revealing that this mixture significantly increases the rate of methanol formation despite both components having low selectivity for methanol.

          努力主要集中在氧化耦合反应上，但最近的成功已经导致合成出可以直接氧化甲烷到甲醇的催化剂。起初，确定合适的催化剂是一个挑战，因为没有方法可以预测有效。CH4/D2交换反应被用作简单氧化物上甲烷激活的指示器，强调了在总体氧化过程中初始激活步骤的重要性。镓氧化物（Ga203）和锌氧化物（ZnO）在甲烷氧化中表现出高活性，使得它们成为与H-ZSM-5一起用于丙烷和丁烷在Cyarar过程中芳香化的优选催化剂成分。基于这些发现，镓氧化物被认为是选择性甲烷氧化催化剂的有用组成部分。为了测试镓氧化物是否能改善甲烷激活的假设，制备了镓氧化物和钼氧化物（MoO3）的物理混合物，发现这种混合物显著提高了甲醇的形成速率，尽管这两种成分对甲醇的选择性都很低。

          [2] "From these studies we identified Moo3 as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, but was known to activate dioxygen."
          [3] "To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h]."
          [4] "Ga203, Moo3 and the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture were then used separately as methane oxidation catalysts in a silica-lined stainless-steel microreactor at 15 bar using a reaction mixture of CH4 : O2 : He = 23 :2 :5 with a total gas hourly space velocity of 5000 h-1."
          [5] "The experimental results are shown in Table 1 and it is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

          Gallium oxide (Ga203) and zinc oxide (ZnO) have shown high activity in methane oxidation, making them preferred catalyst components alongside H-ZSM-5 for the aromatization of propane and butane in the Cyclar process. Molybdenum oxide (MoO3) was identified as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, but it was known to activate dioxygen. To test the hypothesis that gallium oxide improves methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of gallium oxide and molybdenum oxide (with a mole ratio of 1:1) was prepared and used separately as methane oxidation catalysts in a silica-lined stainless-steel microreactor. Using a reaction mixture containing CH4 : O2 : He = 23 :2 :5 at 15 bar with a total gas hourly space velocity of 5000 h-1, the experimental results indicated that although both gallium oxide and molybdenum oxide exhibit low selectivity for methanol, the gallium oxide/molybdenum oxide physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation.
