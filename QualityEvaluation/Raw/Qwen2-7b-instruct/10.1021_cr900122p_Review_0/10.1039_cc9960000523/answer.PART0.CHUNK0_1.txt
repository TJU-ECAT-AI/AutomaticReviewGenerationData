[1] "Most effort has been given to the oxidative coupling reaction,' but more recently there has been some success in the synthesis of catalysts active for the direct oxidation of methane to meth- anoL2"
[2] "We have now successfully addressed this problem and have used the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as an indication of methane activation over simple oxides, since the initial activation of methane and oxygen are key elementary steps in the overall oxidation process."
[3] "The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process.' The identification of the high CH4/D2 exchange rate gives some background to the origin of their catalytic efficacy since Ga203 and ZnO are considered to play a key role in the initial activation of the alkane by polarising a C-H bond."
[4] "From these studies we identified Moo3 as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, but was known to activate dioxygen."
[5] "To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h]."
[6] "It is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/M003 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, specifically gallium oxide (Ga2O3), zinc oxide (ZnO), and molybdenum oxide (MoO3), facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through various mechanisms. In the context of methane oxidation to methanol, these metal centers act as catalysts by polarizing C-H bonds, leading to their activation. For instance, gallium oxide shows a high methane/deuterium exchange rate, indicating its efficiency in activating methane. Zinc oxide and gallium oxide are also highlighted for their role in the initial activation of alkanes, particularly in the Cyclar process for the aromatization of propane and butane. Molybdenum oxide, though less active, still plays a part in the oxidation process. By combining gallium oxide and molybdenum oxide in a physical mixture, the resulting catalyst demonstrates improved methanol formation rates compared to using the individual oxides alone.

The principles behind these metal centers' activation capabilities are rooted in their ability to polarize C-H bonds, which is crucial for the subsequent steps in the oxidation process. This polarization weakens the C-H bond, making it more susceptible to further reactions. The effectiveness of these metal centers in catalyzing the oxidation of alkanes is evident in their ability to enhance the rate of methanol formation in the presence of dioxygen. The identification of the high CH4/D2 exchange rate provides insights into the origin of their catalytic efficacy, supporting the role of gallium oxide and zinc oxide in the initial activation of alkane molecules.

In the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, the principles outlined apply, with the metal centers on the oxide materials facilitating the activation of butane molecules, leading to their subsequent conversion to maleic anhydride. The combination of gallium oxide, zinc oxide, and molybdenum oxide, especially in the form of a physical mixture, showcases the synergistic effect of these metal centers in enhancing the overall catalytic activity for the desired chemical transformation.

在异相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过多种机制促进了C-H键的活化。在甲烷氧化为甲醇的过程中，这些金属中心作为催化剂，通过极化C-H键来活化甲烷。例如，镓氧化物显示出高的甲烷/重氢交换率，表明其在激活甲烷方面的高效性。锌氧化物和镓氧化物也被强调在丙烷和丁烷的Cyclar过程中进行芳香化时的作用，尤其是在烷基的初始活化中。尽管钼氧化物的活性较低，但它仍然参与了氧化过程。通过将镓氧化物和钼氧化物混合在一起形成物理混合物，形成的催化剂显著提高了甲醇生成速率，与单独使用各自的氧化物相比。

这些金属中心活化能力背后的原则在于它们能够极化C-H键，这是后续步骤氧化过程的关键。这种极化削弱了C-H键，使其更易受到进一步反应的影响。这些金属中心在催化烷烃氧化中的有效性体现在它们能够提高甲醇形成速率的存在下。高CH4/D2交换率的识别提供了其催化效能起源的见解，支持了镓氧化物和锌氧化物在烷基分子初始活化中的作用。

以将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的具体示例为例，上述原则适用，金属中心在氧化物材料上的作用是活化丁烷分子，进而导致其转化为马来酸酐。镓氧化物、锌氧化物和钼氧化物的组合，尤其是物理混合物的形式，展示了这些金属中心协同作用的增强整体催化活性，以实现所需化学转换的效果。
