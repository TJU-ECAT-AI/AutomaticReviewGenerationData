[1] "The bulk of the Account summarizes what has been learned so far about homogeneous metal-mediated C-H activation reactions and the Account concludes with our thoughts about the 'Holy Grails' that workers in the C-H activation field would like to attain in the future."
[2] "The present Account therefore reflects this emphasis."
[3] "Despite the fact that C-H bonds are more difficult than other types of linkages to cleave, they are not completely inert. Alkanes have long been known to undergo a number of solution and gas-phase reactions that involve free radicals as intermediates, such as photochlorination, autoxidation, and combustion."
[4] "One Holy Grail of C-H activation research, therefore, is not simply to find new C-H activation reactions but to obtain an understanding of them that will allow the development of reagents capable of selective transformations of C-H bonds into more reactive functionalized molecules."
[5] "Alkane Activation by Metalloradicals. Although it involves metal rather than organic radicals, one other important reaction that should be mentioned in this section is the unique porphyrin-based C-H activation system discovered by Wayland and his group."
[6] "In contrast to both the late transition metal oxidative addition and early metal M=X complexes, none of the porphyrin complexes investigated showed any reaction with benzene over a period of several weeks at 80 °C."
[7] "To our knowledge this type of reaction has so far been found only in this rhodium porphyrin system. It would be interesting to know whether other paramagnetic complexes exist that will activate alkanes by this double-attack mechanism."
[8] "The most widely employed alkane functionalization catalysts are heterogeneous metal surfaces."
[9] "Nevertheless, heterogeneous alkane functionalization reactions are typified by stringent conditions and either poor (e.g., cracking) or poorly understood (n-butane to maleic anhydride) selectivity, which makes them either difficult to control or hard to generalize to a wide range of substrates."
[10] "Exploratory goals include the search for new types of C-H activating systems. Waylands termolecular rhodium porphyrin reactions, our late transition metal Ir(II1) apparent a-bond metathesis reactions, and Perianas Hg(II)/CF3S03H systems are examples of new types of C-H activation reactions that have come to light relatively recently."

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

There are no direct quotes addressing the specific question regarding isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms involved, and application in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. However, we can infer that:

1. Alkanes have been known to undergo a number of solution and gas-phase reactions that involve free radicals as intermediates, such as photochlorination, autoxidation, and combustion. This implies that metal centers on oxide materials might play a role in C-H bond activation through mechanisms that involve free radicals or metal centers that can act as catalysts for radical reactions.

2. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is an example of industrial selective oxidation. Typically, such processes rely on heterogeneous catalysts that can promote oxidation reactions efficiently. Metal oxides, metal sulfides, or metal phosphates are common catalysts used in such reactions. The activation of C-H bonds in alkanes is crucial for the selective formation of functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, or in this case, maleic anhydride. Metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate this activation through redox reactions, hydrogen abstraction, or by acting as sites for radical formation.

3. While there are no specific details about mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction, it is reasonable to assume that these principles could be involved in the activation of C-H bonds in heterogeneous catalysis. Mars van Krevelen theory describes the role of metal surfaces in catalysis, suggesting that adsorbed molecules undergo changes in their oxidation state as they interact with the metal surface. H-abstraction refers to the process where a hydrogen atom is removed from a molecule, which can be facilitated by the presence of a metal center capable of forming a radical.

In summary, while the literature does not directly address the question, it implies that metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms involving free radicals or redox reactions. The principles of Mars van Krevelen theory and H-abstraction could be relevant to this context. Industrial selective oxidation processes, such as converting butane to maleic anhydride, rely on these catalytic mechanisms to achieve efficient and selective functionalization of alkanes.

孤立金属中心在异相催化中的作用、涉及的机制（如火星范克雷伦和H抽象）以及它们在烷烃选择性氧化工业应用中的应用，特别是将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的具体例子是如何的？

文献中没有直接引用关于孤立金属中心在异相催化中促进C-H键活化、涉及的机制以及在烷烃选择性氧化工业应用中的具体细节。但是我们可以推断：

1. 长期以来，已知烷烃能够经历溶液和气体反应，这些反应以自由基作为中间体，如光氯化、自氧化和燃烧。这暗示金属中心在氧化铝材料上可能在异相催化中通过涉及自由基或能够催化自由基反应的金属中心促进C-H键活化。

2. 将丁烷转化为马来酸酐是工业选择性氧化的一个实例。通常，这样的过程依赖于能够高效促进氧化反应的异相催化剂。氧化物、硫化物或磷酸盐金属是这类反应中常用的催化剂。烷烃中的C-H键的活化对于形成如醛、酮或在此情况下为马来酸酐等功能性基团至关重要。金属中心在氧化铝材料上的存在可以促进这一活化过程，通过氧化还原反应、氢抽象或通过形成自由基的途径。

3. 虽然没有具体提到像火星范克雷伦理论或H抽象这样的原理，但合理推测这些原理可能在这个上下文中与烷烃选择性活化相关。火星范克伦理论描述了金属表面在催化中的角色，建议吸附分子在其与金属表面相互作用时会发生氧化状态的变化。H抽象指的是从分子中去除一个氢原子的过程，这可以通过存在能够形成自由基的金属中心来促进。

综上所述，虽然文献没有直接回答这个问题，但它暗示金属中心在氧化铝材料上可以通过涉及自由基或氧化还原反应的机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。火星范克伦理论原则和H抽象可能与此上下文相关。工业选择性氧化过程，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，依赖于这些催化机制实现烷烃的有效和选择性功能化。
