[1] "Moving from relatively fundamental to more practical goals, we cite the following challenges as a hopefully stimulating, but certainly noninclusive, list."
[2] "We require better insight into why some metals undergo C-H activation and why some do not, and an improvement in the level of reliability associated with theoretical predictions of energy surfaces for C-H activation, especially for relatively complex molecules."
[3] "Still perplexing is the relationship of heterogeneous and biological catalysts to those that can be prepared in the laboratory, as well as the challenge of synthesizing soluble complexes that will mimic the C-H activation behavior of their solid and biological relatives."
[4] "We also anticipate the appearance of new ligands that will convert nonreactive metals into reactive ones, allow conversion of C-H-activated products into functionalized organic compounds (e.g.,oxidation-resistant ligands), and provide methods for carrying out enantioselective C-H activation."
[5] "Within this general goal lie methods for selective conversion of C-H activated metal complexes to functional groups of choice and conversion of methane to longer-chain hydrocarbons for use as synthetic intermediates or liquid fuels."

1. The challenges and future goals in the field of C-H activation include gaining a deeper understanding of the factors controlling the rate, selectivity, isotope effects, and stereochemistry of C-H activation processes. Researchers aim to elucidate why certain metals undergo C-H activation while others do not, and improve the reliability of theoretical predictions regarding energy surfaces for C-H activation, particularly for complex molecules. There is also a need to explore the relationship between heterogeneous and biological catalysts compared to those synthesized in the lab, and develop soluble complexes that mimic the C-H activation behavior of their solid and biological counterparts. Additionally, scientists anticipate discovering new ligands that can transform non-reactive metals into active catalysts, enable the conversion of C-H activated products into functional organic compounds, and facilitate enantioselective C-H activation. Achieving these goals includes devising methods for selective conversion of C-H activated metal complexes into desired functional groups and converting methane into longer-chain hydrocarbons for use as synthetic intermediates or liquid fuels.

1. C-H激活领域的挑战和未来目标包括深入了解控制C-H激活过程速率、选择性、同位素效应和立体化学的因子。研究者旨在揭示为何某些金属能进行C-H激活而其他金属不能，以及提高理论预测关于复杂分子C-H激活能量表面可靠性的能力。此外，还需探索异相催化剂与生物催化剂与实验室合成催化剂之间的关系，并开发能够模仿其固体和生物来源催化行为的可溶性配合物。另外，科学家预计会发现可以将非反应性金属转化为活性催化剂的新配体，使C-H活化产物转化为功能性有机化合物，并实现手性C-H活化。实现这些目标包括设计方法以选择性地将C-H活化金属复合物转化为所需功能团，并将甲烷转化为作为合成中间体或液体燃料使用的更长链烃类。
