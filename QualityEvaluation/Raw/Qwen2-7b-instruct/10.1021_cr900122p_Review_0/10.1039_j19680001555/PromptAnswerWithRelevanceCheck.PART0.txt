How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

[1] "In this study, we focus on the exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium on silica-alumina and alumina catalysts."
[2] "The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium have been studied on two silica-alumina catalysts containing 13% (I) or 45% (II) alumina and on pure alumina."
[3] "The temperature ranges studied were 125-440°C, 20-100°C, and 20-250°C for the three catalysts respectively."
[4] "On any catalyst, the hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate and there were no appreciable directing effects due to the side-groups."
[5] "Rates of reaction were substantially lower on silica-alumina I than on the other catalysts."
[6] "Side-group exchange with toluene or m-xylene was slower than ring exchange by factors ranging from 30 upwards."
[7] "Silica-alumina I was the least active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates comparable with those found for side-group exchange."
[8] "The exchange reactions of alkylbenzenes with deuterium have been studied on metal film, supported platinum, chromium oxide titania, nickel-exchanged zeolites, and silica-alumina."
[9] "The exchange behaviour of the alkylbenzenes over silica-alumina and alumina is strikingly different from the results found with metals and some other oxide catalysts."
[10] "The exchange of CD2 with hydrogen is close to the common rate that we find for the exchange of the ring hydrogen atoms in the three aromatic molecules."
[11] "When CD2 is used as the source of deuterium atoms only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135°C which is a much higher temperature than that required for the exchange of methane with deuterium or for the equilibration of CH4 and CD2."
[12] "The exchange of a hydrocarbon may only take place readily with deuterium atoms which are present in the form of OD groups at special sites and the rate-determining step might be the conversion of OH into OD at these sites."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium were studied on silica-alumina and alumina catalysts. The reactions were conducted at varying temperatures on the catalysts, and the hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate, without significant directing effects due to side-groups. The rates of reaction were notably lower on silica-alumina I than on other catalysts. Side-group exchange was slower than ring exchange by factors of 30 or more. Silica-alumina I was less active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates comparable to side-group exchange. The exchange behaviour of alkylbenzenes on silica-alumina and alumina is distinct from that on metals and other oxide catalysts. The exchange of CD2 with hydrogen occurs at a rate similar to the exchange of ring hydrogen atoms in the aromatic molecules. When CD2 is used as the source of deuterium atoms, only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135°C, a temperature significantly higher than that required for methane exchange with deuterium. It is hypothesized that the exchange process may involve the conversion of OH into OD at special sites, suggesting a possible rate-determining step.

在研究中，我们关注了苯、甲苯和间二甲苯与重氢的交换反应在硅酸铝和氧化铝催化剂上的情况。这些反应在不同的温度下在三种催化剂上进行，环位上的氢原子在所有三种烃类中以相同速率反应，且不存在由侧基引起的明显导向效应。在硅酸铝I上的反应速率显著低于其他催化剂。甲苯或间二甲苯的侧基交换速率比环交换慢30倍以上。硅酸铝I对于氢-重氢交换活性较低，并以与侧基交换相当的速率异构化间二甲苯。烷基苯在硅酸铝和氧化铝上的交换行为与金属和其他氧化物催化剂的结果大相径庭。CD2与氢的交换率接近我们发现的三个芳香分子中环氢原子的常见交换率。当使用CD2作为重氢来源时，在135°C只有表面羟基组分的一部分迅速交换，该温度远高于甲烷与重氢交换所需的温度。推测交换过程可能涉及OH转化为OD在特殊位置，暗示可能的决定性步骤是OH到OD的转换。

The study investigates the exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium on silica-alumina and alumina catalysts. The reactions occur readily at low temperatures, with no significant directing effects due to side groups. The rates of reaction are lower on silica-alumina I compared to other catalysts, and side-group exchange is slower than ring exchange by factors of up to 30. The catalysts are effective for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerization of m-xylene. The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium occurs at similar rates to the exchange of ring hydrogen atoms in the aromatic molecules. Only a fraction of surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly with deuterium at 135°C, unlike the exchange of methane with deuterium or the equilibration of CH4 and CD4.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The silica-alumina and alumina catalysts were utilized to examine the exchange of hydrogen atoms in benzene, toluene, and m-xylene. The hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at an equivalent rate across all catalysts, without any significant directionality influenced by side groups. The reaction rates were notably lower on silica-alumina I compared to other catalysts. Side-group exchange with toluene or m-xylene occurred at a slower pace than ring exchange, with the rate differing by factors ranging from 30. Silica-alumina I exhibited lower activity for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and matched the side-group exchange rates for m-xylene isomerization. The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium happens efficiently at low temperatures, making activation straightforward. The rate of deuterium exchange closely matches the ring hydrogen atom exchange rates in the three aromatic molecules. When using CD as the deuterium source, only a portion of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135°C, significantly higher than methane exchange with deuterium or the equilibrium of CH and CD. The exchange of hydrogen with deuterium on silica-alumina I is slightly faster than the alkylbenzene ring atom reactions, but the latter exchanges much more quickly than methane, unlike results with y-alumina. The hierarchy of molecule activity is olefins > saturated hydrocarbons with tertiary carbons > benzene > hydrogen > saturated hydrocarbons without tertiary carbons.

我们研究了氧化铝和硅酸铝催化剂在苯、甲苯和间二甲苯中氢原子交换的活性。环状位置的三个烃类氢原子在任何催化剂上以相同速率反应，且没有侧基对方向性的显著影响。与其它催化剂相比，硅酸铝I的反应速率明显较低。甲苯或间二甲苯的侧基交换速度慢于环交换，比率高达30倍。硅酸铝I对氢氘交换的活性最低，并与侧基交换速率相当，用于间二甲苯异构化。氢与氘之间的交换在低温下容易进行，因此激活过程并不困难。使用CD作为氘源时，表面羟基仅在较高温度（135°C）下快速交换，远高于甲烷与氘的交换或CH和CD的平衡温度。在硅酸铝I上，氢与氘的交换速率略快于烷基苯环原子反应，但后者比甲烷快得多，这与y-氧化铝的结果不同。分子活性顺序为烯烃 > 含有三级碳原子的饱和烃 > 苯 > 氢 > 不含三级碳原子的饱和烃。
