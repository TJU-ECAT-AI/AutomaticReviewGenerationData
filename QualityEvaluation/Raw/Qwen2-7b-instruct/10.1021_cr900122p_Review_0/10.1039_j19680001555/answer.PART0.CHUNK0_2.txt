[1] "The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium takes place readily at low temperatures and consequently there is no difficulty about 'activating' the hydrogen molecules for this particular exchange."
[2] "The rate of exchange of CD, with hydrogen is close to the common rate that we find for the exchange of the ring hydrogen atoms in the three aromatic molecules."
[3] "When CD,is used as the source of deuterium atoms only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135" which is a much higher temperature than that required for the exchange of methane with deuterium or for the equilibration of CH, and CD,"
[4] "With silica-alumina I the exchange of hydrogen with deuterium is only slightly more rapid than the reaction of the ring atoms of the alkylbenzenes but the latter exchange much nore rapidly than methane in contrast to the results with y-alumina."

1. Hydrogen and deuterium exchange readily at low temperatures, allowing easy activation of hydrogen molecules for this specific exchange.

2. The rate of exchange between deuterium and hydrogen is comparable to the rate of ring hydrogen atom exchanges in aromatic molecules.

3. Using deuterium atoms from CD only allows a portion of surface hydroxyl groups to exchange rapidly at 135°C, a temperature significantly higher than required for methane deuterium exchange or CH, and CD, equilibrium.

4. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange on silica-alumina I is slightly faster than alkylbenzene ring atom exchanges, but much slower than methane's exchange rate compared to results on y-alumina.

1. 氢和重氢在低温下容易交换，使得氢分子可以轻松激活进行这种特定的交换。

2. 重氢与氢的交换速率与芳香分子中环氢原子的交换速率相近。

3. 使用来自CD的重氢原子，只有表面羟基组分的一部分能在135°C迅速交换，这个温度远高于甲烷与重氢交换或CH,和CD的平衡所需。

4. 在硅酸铝I上，氢-重氢交换略快于烷基苯环原子交换，但比甲烷的交换速率要慢得多，这与在y-氧化铝上的结果不同。
