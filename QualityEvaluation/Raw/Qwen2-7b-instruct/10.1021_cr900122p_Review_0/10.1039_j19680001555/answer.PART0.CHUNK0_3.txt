[1] "The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium have been studied on two silica-alumina catalysts containing 13% (I) or 45% (II) alumina and on pure alumina."
[2] "Rates of reaction were substantially lower on silica-alumina I than on the other catalysts."
[3] "Side-group exchange with toluene or m-xylene was slower than ring exchange by factors ranging from 30 upwards."
[4] "Silica-alumina I was the least active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates comparable with those found for side-group exchange."
[5] "The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium takes place readily at low temperatures."
[6] "The rate of exchange of CD2 with hydrogen is close to the common rate that we find for the exchange of the ring hydrogen atoms in the three aromatic molecules."
[7] "When CD2 is used as the source of deuterium atoms only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135°C which is a much higher temperature than that required for the exchange of methane with deuterium or for the equilibration of CH4 and CD2."
[8] "With silica-alumina I the exchange of hydrogen with deuterium is only slightly more rapid than the reaction of the ring atoms of the alkylbenzenes but the latter exchange much more rapidly than methane in contrast to the results with y-alumina."

1. The study examined the exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium on silica-alumina catalysts with varying alumina contents and pure alumina. 

2. The reaction rates were notably slower on silica-alumina I compared to other catalysts.

3. Side-group exchanges with toluene or m-xylene occurred significantly slower than ring exchanges, with a factor of 30 or more.

4. Silica-alumina I exhibited the lowest activity for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and showed rates for m-xylene isomerization comparable to side-group exchange.

5. The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium occurred efficiently at low temperatures.

6. The rate of exchange of CD2 with hydrogen matched the common rate for ring hydrogen atom exchanges in the studied aromatic molecules.

7. Using CD2 as the deuterium source resulted in only a portion of the surface hydroxyl groups exchanging rapidly at 135°C, higher than methane or CH4 and CD2 equilibration temperatures.

8. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange on silica-alumina I was slightly faster than ring alkylbenzene exchanges, but still much slower than methane exchange.

1. 研究考察了苯、甲苯和间二甲苯与氘的交换反应在含13%（I）或45%（II）氧化铝的二氧化硅氧化铝催化剂及纯氧化铝上的行为。

2. 相比其他催化剂，二氧化硅氧化铝I的反应速率显著较低。

3. 甲苯或间二甲苯的侧基交换速率较环上氢原子交换慢，相差约30倍以上。

4. 二氧化硅氧化铝I对于氢氘交换活性最低，并且其甲苯异构化速率与侧基交换相当。

5. 氢氘交换在低温下进行得非常顺畅。

6. 使用CD2作为氘源时，表面羟基仅有一部分在135°C迅速交换，这一温度高于甲烷或CH4和CD2的平衡温度。

7. 在二氧化硅氧化铝I上，氢氘交换稍快于环上芳烃交换，但仍然远低于甲烷交换速率。

8. 氢氘交换在二氧化硅氧化铝I上比环上烷基苯交换稍快，但仍然明显慢于甲烷交换。
