[1] "In this study, we focus on the exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium on silica-alumina and alumina catalysts."
[2] "The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium have been studied on two silica-alumina catalysts containing 13% (I) or 45% (II) alumina and on pure alumina."
[3] "The temperature ranges studied were 125-440°C, 20-100°C, and 20-250°C for the three catalysts respectively."
[4] "On any catalyst, the hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate and there were no appreciable directing effects due to the side-groups."
[5] "Rates of reaction were substantially lower on silica-alumina I than on the other catalysts."
[6] "Side-group exchange with toluene or m-xylene was slower than ring exchange by factors ranging from 30 upwards."
[7] "Silica-alumina I was the least active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates comparable with those found for side-group exchange."
[8] "The exchange reactions of alkylbenzenes with deuterium have been studied on metal film, supported platinum, chromium oxide titania, nickel-exchanged zeolites, and silica-alumina."
[9] "The exchange behaviour of the alkylbenzenes over silica-alumina and alumina is strikingly different from the results found with metals and some other oxide catalysts."
[10] "The exchange of CD2 with hydrogen is close to the common rate that we find for the exchange of the ring hydrogen atoms in the three aromatic molecules."
[11] "When CD2 is used as the source of deuterium atoms only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135°C which is a much higher temperature than that required for the exchange of methane with deuterium or for the equilibration of CH4 and CD2."
[12] "The exchange of a hydrocarbon may only take place readily with deuterium atoms which are present in the form of OD groups at special sites and the rate-determining step might be the conversion of OH into OD at these sites."

The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium were studied on silica-alumina and alumina catalysts. The reactions were conducted at varying temperatures on the catalysts, and the hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate, without significant directing effects due to side-groups. The rates of reaction were notably lower on silica-alumina I than on other catalysts. Side-group exchange was slower than ring exchange by factors of 30 or more. Silica-alumina I was less active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates comparable to side-group exchange. The exchange behaviour of alkylbenzenes on silica-alumina and alumina is distinct from that on metals and other oxide catalysts. The exchange of CD2 with hydrogen occurs at a rate similar to the exchange of ring hydrogen atoms in the aromatic molecules. When CD2 is used as the source of deuterium atoms, only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135°C, a temperature significantly higher than that required for methane exchange with deuterium. It is hypothesized that the exchange process may involve the conversion of OH into OD at special sites, suggesting a possible rate-determining step.

在研究中，我们关注了苯、甲苯和间二甲苯与重氢的交换反应在硅酸铝和氧化铝催化剂上的情况。这些反应在不同的温度下在三种催化剂上进行，环位上的氢原子在所有三种烃类中以相同速率反应，且不存在由侧基引起的明显导向效应。在硅酸铝I上的反应速率显著低于其他催化剂。甲苯或间二甲苯的侧基交换速率比环交换慢30倍以上。硅酸铝I对于氢-重氢交换活性较低，并以与侧基交换相当的速率异构化间二甲苯。烷基苯在硅酸铝和氧化铝上的交换行为与金属和其他氧化物催化剂的结果大相径庭。CD2与氢的交换率接近我们发现的三个芳香分子中环氢原子的常见交换率。当使用CD2作为重氢来源时，在135°C只有表面羟基组分的一部分迅速交换，该温度远高于甲烷与重氢交换所需的温度。推测交换过程可能涉及OH转化为OD在特殊位置，暗示可能的决定性步骤是OH到OD的转换。
