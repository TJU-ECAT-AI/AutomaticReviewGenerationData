[2] "The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and rn-xylene with deuterium have been studied on two silica-alumina catalysts containing 13% (I) or 45% (II) alumina and on pure alumina."
[3] "On any catalyst the hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate and there were no appreciable directing effects due to the side-groups."
[4] "Rates of reaction were substantially lower on silica-alumina I than on the other catalysts."
[5] "Side-group exchange with toluene or rn-xylene was slower than ring exchange by factors ranging from 30 upwards."
[6] "Subsidiary experiments on hydrogen-deuterium exchange and on the isomerization of rn-xylene were also carried out."
[7] "Silica-alumina I was the least active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized rn-xylene at rates comparable with those found for side-group exchange."
[8] "The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium takes place readily at low temperatures and consequently there is no difficulty about 'activating' the hydrogen molecules for this particular exchange."
[9] "The rate of exchange of CD, with hydrogen is close to the common rate that we find for the exchange of the ring hydrogen atoms in the three aromatic molecules."
[10] "When CD,is used as the source of deuterium atoms only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135° which is a much higher temperature than that required for the exchange of methane with deuterium or for the equilibration of CH, and CD,."

The study investigates the exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium on silica-alumina and alumina catalysts. The reactions occur readily at low temperatures, with no significant directing effects due to side groups. The rates of reaction are lower on silica-alumina I compared to other catalysts, and side-group exchange is slower than ring exchange by factors of up to 30. The catalysts are effective for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerization of m-xylene. The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium occurs at similar rates to the exchange of ring hydrogen atoms in the aromatic molecules. Only a fraction of surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly with deuterium at 135°C, unlike the exchange of methane with deuterium or the equilibration of CH4 and CD4.

这项研究考察了苯、甲苯和邻二甲苯在硅酸铝和氧化铝催化剂上与氘的交换反应。在低温下，反应能够顺利进行，且侧基对反应没有显著的定向效应。在硅酸铝I上的反应速率比其他催化剂低，侧基交换速率是环基交换速率的30倍以上。催化剂对于氢氘交换和邻二甲苯异构化有效。氢与氘之间的交换速率与芳香分子中环氢原子的交换速率相似。只有表面羟基组分在135°C快速与氘交换，而甲烷与氘的交换或CH4和CD4的平衡则不是这种情况。
