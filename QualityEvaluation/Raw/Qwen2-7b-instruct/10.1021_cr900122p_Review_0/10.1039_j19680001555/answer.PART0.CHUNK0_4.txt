The silica-alumina and alumina catalysts were utilized to examine the exchange of hydrogen atoms in benzene, toluene, and m-xylene. The hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at an equivalent rate across all catalysts, without any significant directionality influenced by side groups. The reaction rates were notably lower on silica-alumina I compared to other catalysts. Side-group exchange with toluene or m-xylene occurred at a slower pace than ring exchange, with the rate differing by factors ranging from 30. Silica-alumina I exhibited lower activity for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and matched the side-group exchange rates for m-xylene isomerization. The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium happens efficiently at low temperatures, making activation straightforward. The rate of deuterium exchange closely matches the ring hydrogen atom exchange rates in the three aromatic molecules. When using CD as the deuterium source, only a portion of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135°C, significantly higher than methane exchange with deuterium or the equilibrium of CH and CD. The exchange of hydrogen with deuterium on silica-alumina I is slightly faster than the alkylbenzene ring atom reactions, but the latter exchanges much more quickly than methane, unlike results with y-alumina. The hierarchy of molecule activity is olefins > saturated hydrocarbons with tertiary carbons > benzene > hydrogen > saturated hydrocarbons without tertiary carbons.

我们研究了氧化铝和硅酸铝催化剂在苯、甲苯和间二甲苯中氢原子交换的活性。环状位置的三个烃类氢原子在任何催化剂上以相同速率反应，且没有侧基对方向性的显著影响。与其它催化剂相比，硅酸铝I的反应速率明显较低。甲苯或间二甲苯的侧基交换速度慢于环交换，比率高达30倍。硅酸铝I对氢氘交换的活性最低，并与侧基交换速率相当，用于间二甲苯异构化。氢与氘之间的交换在低温下容易进行，因此激活过程并不困难。使用CD作为氘源时，表面羟基仅在较高温度（135°C）下快速交换，远高于甲烷与氘的交换或CH和CD的平衡温度。在硅酸铝I上，氢与氘的交换速率略快于烷基苯环原子反应，但后者比甲烷快得多，这与y-氧化铝的结果不同。分子活性顺序为烯烃 > 含有三级碳原子的饱和烃 > 苯 > 氢 > 不含三级碳原子的饱和烃。
