Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes. Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective. Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke. As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions. Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke, the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice.

In situ Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the reduction process of surface Cr6 species on a 5 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of n-butane. It was concluded that polychromate was more readily reducible than monochromate. However, above 350°C the in situ Raman spectra became less informative due to coke formation. In situ DRS spectroscopy studies on 0.18.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts show that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane to mainly pseudo-octahedral Cr3. Thus, surface Cr3 species are formed under reaction conditions at the expense of Cr6. The in situ DRS cell was coupled with a GC in order to monitor online the activity and selectivity of the catalysts under study. It was found that there is a more or less quantitative relationship between the amount of pseudo-octahedral Cr3 formed by reduction and the dehydrogenation activity.

The industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions strongly affects their physical and chemical structure, and ultimately leads to catalyst deactivation. First of all, the specific surface area of the catalyst decreases with increasing time-on-stream, increasing reaction temperature, and increasing number of catalytic cycles. In addition, the amount of surface Cr6 decreased with increasing number of cycles. Hakuli et al. observed that in a fresh 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst 15% of the Cr was present as Cr6, whereas after 25 cycles, the amount of Cr6 as a percentage of the total Cr content was only 12.7. Thus, part of the Cr6 was irreversibly reduced to a lower oxidation state. The same authors also found an almost linear relationship between the initial dehydrogenation activity and the amount of Cr6 as determined by XPS in the spent catalyst. Similar results were obtained by De Rossi et al., who observed that the extent of reduction (as determined from the amount of H2 or CO consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts) decreases with increasing number of reduction-dehydrogenation recalcination cycles. This decrease has been attributed to an incomplete reoxidation of reduced Cr3 species.

Industrial catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly chromium oxide catalysts supported on aluminum oxide (Cr2O3/Al2O3), enable efficient conversion of alkanes to alkenes through selective C-H bond activation. The dehydrogenation process is endothermic and requires high temperatures and low pressures. Suitable catalysts must balance high activity and selectivity while inhibiting unwanted side reactions like thermal cracking and coke formation. Detailed information on the dehydrogenation sites can be obtained through advanced spectroscopic tools. In situ techniques like Raman spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy are crucial for monitoring surface chromium species during alkane dehydrogenation reactions. These tools reveal that under reaction conditions, surface chromium species transform from Cr6 to Cr3, which is beneficial for dehydrogenation activity. Industrial catalysts undergo cyclic oxidation and reduction, leading to structural changes and eventual deactivation. The specific surface area and amount of Cr6 decrease with prolonged use, impacting the catalyst's performance and selectivity.

The key mechanisms involve the reduction of surface chromium hexavalent (Cr6) species to trivalent (Cr3) forms, which are more reactive and contribute to the dehydrogenation process. The relationship between the amount of reduced Cr3 species and catalyst activity suggests that maintaining a certain level of Cr3 is essential for optimal performance. The deactivation process involves the irreversible reduction of Cr6 to lower oxidation states and incomplete reoxidation of reduced Cr3 species, affecting the catalyst's efficiency over time. This highlights the importance of understanding and managing the redox states of chromium species on the catalyst surface to enhance selectivity and prolong the catalyst's life cycle.

To summarize, the effectiveness of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation relies on the precise control and manipulation of surface chromium species, particularly through the redox transformation from Cr6 to Cr3. This process enables efficient and selective conversion of alkanes to alkenes, which is critical for industries producing valuable chemical intermediates like propene and isobutene.
