Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes. Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective. Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke. As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions. Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke, the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice.

In situ Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the reduction process of surface Cr6 species on a 5 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of n-butane. It was concluded that polychromate was more readily reducible than monochromate. However, above 350°C the in situ Raman spectra became less informative due to coke formation. In situ DRS spectroscopy studies on 0.18.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts show that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane to mainly pseudo-octahedral Cr3. Thus, surface Cr3 species are formed under reaction conditions at the expense of Cr6. The in situ DRS cell was coupled with a GC in order to monitor online the activity and selectivity of the catalysts under study. It was found that there is a more or less quantitative relationship between the amount of pseudo-octahedral Cr3 formed by reduction and the dehydrogenation activity.

The industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions strongly affects their physical and chemical structure, and ultimately leads to catalyst deactivation. First of all, the specific surface area of the catalyst decreases with increasing time-on-stream, increasing reaction temperature, and increasing number of catalytic cycles. In addition, the amount of surface Cr6 decreased with increasing number of cycles. Hakuli et al. observed that in a fresh 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst 15% of the Cr was present as Cr6, whereas after 25 cycles, the amount of Cr6 as a percentage of the total Cr content was only 12.7. Thus, part of the Cr6 was irreversibly reduced to a lower oxidation state. The same authors also found an almost linear relationship between the initial dehydrogenation activity and the amount of Cr6 as determined by XPS in the spent catalyst. Similar results were obtained by De Rossi et al., who observed that the extent of reduction (as determined from the amount of H2 or CO consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts) decreases with increasing number of reduction-dehydrogenation recalcination cycles. This decrease has been attributed to an incomplete reoxidation of reduced Cr3 species.

Industrial catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly chromium oxide catalysts supported on aluminum oxide (Cr2O3/Al2O3), enable efficient conversion of alkanes to alkenes through selective C-H bond activation. The dehydrogenation process is endothermic and requires high temperatures and low pressures. Suitable catalysts must balance high activity and selectivity while inhibiting unwanted side reactions like thermal cracking and coke formation. Detailed information on the dehydrogenation sites can be obtained through advanced spectroscopic tools. In situ techniques like Raman spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy are crucial for monitoring surface chromium species during alkane dehydrogenation reactions. These tools reveal that under reaction conditions, surface chromium species transform from Cr6 to Cr3, which is beneficial for dehydrogenation activity. Industrial catalysts undergo cyclic oxidation and reduction, leading to structural changes and eventual deactivation. The specific surface area and amount of Cr6 decrease with prolonged use, impacting the catalyst's performance and selectivity.

The key mechanisms involve the reduction of surface chromium hexavalent (Cr6) species to trivalent (Cr3) forms, which are more reactive and contribute to the dehydrogenation process. The relationship between the amount of reduced Cr3 species and catalyst activity suggests that maintaining a certain level of Cr3 is essential for optimal performance. The deactivation process involves the irreversible reduction of Cr6 to lower oxidation states and incomplete reoxidation of reduced Cr3 species, affecting the catalyst's efficiency over time. This highlights the importance of understanding and managing the redox states of chromium species on the catalyst surface to enhance selectivity and prolong the catalyst's life cycle.

To summarize, the effectiveness of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation relies on the precise control and manipulation of surface chromium species, particularly through the redox transformation from Cr6 to Cr3. This process enables efficient and selective conversion of alkanes to alkenes, which is critical for industries producing valuable chemical intermediates like propene and isobutene.

关键机制涉及表面六价铬（Cr6）物种的还原至三价（Cr3）形式，这有利于脱氢过程。活性与减少的Cr3物种的数量之间的关系表明，保持一定水平的Cr3对于最佳性能至关重要。失活过程涉及不可逆地还原Cr6到较低的氧化状态以及还原Cr3物种的不完全再氧化，从而影响催化剂的效率。这突出了理解并管理催化剂表面铬物种的氧化还原状态以增强选择性和延长催化剂生命周期的重要性。

综上所述，Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的有效性取决于对表面铬物种的精确控制和操纵，尤其是通过Cr6到Cr3的氧化还原转变。这一过程允许高效和选择性地将烷烃转化为烯烃，这对于生产有价值的化学中间体如丙烯和异丁烯等工业非常重要。

Industrial heterogeneous catalysts, particularly chromium oxide supported on aluminum oxide (Cr/Al2O3), facilitate the activation of C-H bonds through the creation of isolated metal centers on the oxide material. These centers enable the abstraction of hydrogen atoms (H-abstraction) or the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, where electrons are transferred between the metal center and the substrate, leading to the formation of reactive intermediates. In the context of industrial selective oxidation, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, these principles are crucial. Chromium, in its various oxidation states, acts as a Lewis acid, attracting electrons from the substrate and promoting the cleavage of C-H bonds. As the process occurs, the chromium species undergo reduction, forming coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 sites, which are essential for the subsequent oxidation reactions.

The industrial application of these catalysts involves a cycle of oxidation, dehydrogenation, and recalcination. Over time, this process leads to a decrease in the efficiency of the catalyst, as evidenced by a decline in the amount of hydrogen or carbon monoxide consumed during reduction steps, indicating incomplete reoxidation of the reduced Cr3 species. This deactivation is a significant concern, necessitating the development of strategies to maintain or restore the catalyst's activity and selectivity throughout its operational life.

工业异质催化剂，特别是铝氧化物支持的铬氧化物（Cr/Al2O3），通过在氧化物材料上形成孤立的金属中心来促进C-H键的激活。这些中心通过氢原子的提取（H-提取）或Mars van Krevelen机制，即金属中心和基体之间的电子转移，导致形成活性中间体，从而促进C-H键的断裂。在工业选择性氧化中，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，这些原理至关重要。铬以各种氧化状态存在，作为路易斯酸，吸引基体的电子并促进C-H键的裂解。随着过程进行，铬物种经历还原，形成配位不饱和的Cr3位点，这对于后续氧化反应是必不可少的。

工业应用中催化剂的工作流程涉及氧化、脱氢和再活化循环。随着时间的推移，这一过程会导致催化剂效率下降，表现为还原步骤中消耗的氢或一氧化碳量减少，表明还原后的Cr3物种未能完全重新氧化。这种失活是一个重要问题，需要发展策略以维持或恢复催化剂的活性和选择性，使其在整个操作周期内保持高效。

Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke, the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice. The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mciver, and by Kearby. Subsequently, numerous papers have been published in the literature on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts. All the newer studies primarily focus on identifying the active sites; influencing the preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selecitivity; and elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism.
In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge about chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. In Section 2, the thermodynamic constraints for alkane dehydrogenations and their technological consequences will be introduced. Sections 3 and 4 are devoted to the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization, while Section 5 discusses the factors governing the catalytic activity and selectivity. In Section 6, the spectroscopic and catalytic data of Cr-based catalysts will be combined in an attempt to define structureactivity/selectivity relationships.

The dehydrogenation of alkanes facilitates C-H bond activation through the creation of isolated metal centers on oxide materials. In heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen process and H-abstraction play crucial roles in C-H bond activation. These processes involve the transfer of electrons from a metal center to a C-H bond, leading to the cleavage of the bond. In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied by designing catalysts with specific structures that allow for efficient activation of the desired C-H bonds while avoiding unwanted side reactions. For example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the catalyst is engineered to promote the desired oxidative cleavage of the butane molecule into maleic anhydride, while minimizing the formation of other products.

In the case of Cr-based catalysts, the key is to maintain the oxidation state of chromium as Cr6, which is known to be effective in alkane dehydrogenation. Through the use of in situ spectroscopic techniques, researchers can monitor the reduction of Cr6 species to Cr3 during the dehydrogenation process. This reduction leads to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species, which are believed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. The balance between Cr6 and Cr3 species is crucial for maintaining high activity and selectivity in the catalyst.

The deactivation of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under industrial conditions involves changes in the structure of the catalyst, such as a decrease in specific surface area and a reduction in the amount of Cr6 species. These changes can be monitored through spectroscopic techniques like XPS, DRS, and Raman spectroscopy. By understanding the mechanisms of deactivation and the role of Cr6 and Cr3 species, researchers can optimize the catalyst preparation and operating conditions to extend the lifetime and efficiency of the catalyst.

To summarize, the isolation of metal centers on oxide materials enables efficient C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen process and H-abstraction. In industrial applications, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, these principles are harnessed by designing catalysts that maintain the appropriate metal oxidation states and optimize the balance between active Cr6 and Cr3 species to achieve high activity and selectivity.

在氧化物材料上形成的孤立金属中心促进了烷烃脱氢过程中的C-H键活化。在异相催化中，Mars-van Krevelen过程和H摘取等机制在C-H键活化过程中起着关键作用。这些过程涉及从金属中心向C-H键转移电子，导致键的断裂。在工业选择性氧化烷烃的应用中，通过设计具有特定结构的催化剂，可以有效地激活所需的C-H键，同时避免其他副反应。例如，在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，通过设计催化剂来促进预期的氧化断裂，从而将丁烷分子转化为马来酸酐，同时尽量减少其他产物的形成。

对于Cr基催化剂而言，关键在于保持铬的氧化状态为Cr6，这是已知在烷烃脱氢中有效的。通过使用原位光谱技术，研究人员可以监测脱氢过程中Cr6物种向Cr3的还原。这种还原导致形成配位不饱和的Cr3物种，被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。Cr6和Cr3物种之间的平衡对于维持高活性和选择性催化剂至关重要。

Cr/Al2O3催化剂在工业条件下失活涉及催化剂结构的变化，如特定表面积的降低和Cr6物种数量的减少。这些变化可以通过XPS、DRS和拉曼光谱等技术进行监控。通过理解失活机制以及Cr6和Cr3物种的作用，研究者可以优化催化剂制备和操作条件，以延长催化剂的寿命和效率。

总之，孤立于氧化物材料上的金属中心能够通过Mars-van Krevelen过程和H摘取等机制有效地活化C-H键。在工业应用中，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，这些原理被利用来设计保持适当金属氧化状态并优化Cr6和Cr3物种平衡的催化剂，以实现高活性和选择性。
