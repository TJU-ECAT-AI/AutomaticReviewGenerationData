Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes. Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective. Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke. As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions.
Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke, the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice. The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mciver, and by Kearby. Subsequently, numerous papers have been published in the literature on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts. All the newer studies primarily focus on identifying the active sites; influencing the preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selecitivity; and elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism.
In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge about chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. In Section 2, the thermodynamic constraints for alkane dehydrogenations and their technological consequences will be introduced. Sections 3 and 4 are devoted to the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization, while Section 5 discusses the factors governing the catalytic activity and selectivity. In Section 6, the spectroscopic and catalytic data of Cr-based catalysts will be combined in an attempt to define structureactivity/selectivity relationships.

The dehydrogenation of alkanes facilitates C-H bond activation through the creation of isolated metal centers on oxide materials. In heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen process and H-abstraction play crucial roles in C-H bond activation. These processes involve the transfer of electrons from a metal center to a C-H bond, leading to the cleavage of the bond. In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied by designing catalysts with specific structures that allow for efficient activation of the desired C-H bonds while avoiding unwanted side reactions. For example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the catalyst is engineered to promote the desired oxidative cleavage of the butane molecule into maleic anhydride, while minimizing the formation of other products.

In the case of Cr-based catalysts, the key is to maintain the oxidation state of chromium as Cr6, which is known to be effective in alkane dehydrogenation. Through the use of in situ spectroscopic techniques, researchers can monitor the reduction of Cr6 species to Cr3 during the dehydrogenation process. This reduction leads to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species, which are believed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. The balance between Cr6 and Cr3 species is crucial for maintaining high activity and selectivity in the catalyst.

The deactivation of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under industrial conditions involves changes in the structure of the catalyst, such as a decrease in specific surface area and a reduction in the amount of Cr6 species. These changes can be monitored through spectroscopic techniques like XPS, DRS, and Raman spectroscopy. By understanding the mechanisms of deactivation and the role of Cr6 and Cr3 species, researchers can optimize the catalyst preparation and operating conditions to extend the lifetime and efficiency of the catalyst.

To summarize, the isolation of metal centers on oxide materials enables efficient C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen process and H-abstraction. In industrial applications, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, these principles are harnessed by designing catalysts that maintain the appropriate metal oxidation states and optimize the balance between active Cr6 and Cr3 species to achieve high activity and selectivity.

在氧化物材料上形成的孤立金属中心促进了烷烃脱氢过程中的C-H键活化。在异相催化中，Mars-van Krevelen过程和H摘取等机制在C-H键活化过程中起着关键作用。这些过程涉及从金属中心向C-H键转移电子，导致键的断裂。在工业选择性氧化烷烃的应用中，通过设计具有特定结构的催化剂，可以有效地激活所需的C-H键，同时避免其他副反应。例如，在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，通过设计催化剂来促进预期的氧化断裂，从而将丁烷分子转化为马来酸酐，同时尽量减少其他产物的形成。

对于Cr基催化剂而言，关键在于保持铬的氧化状态为Cr6，这是已知在烷烃脱氢中有效的。通过使用原位光谱技术，研究人员可以监测脱氢过程中Cr6物种向Cr3的还原。这种还原导致形成配位不饱和的Cr3物种，被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。Cr6和Cr3物种之间的平衡对于维持高活性和选择性催化剂至关重要。

Cr/Al2O3催化剂在工业条件下失活涉及催化剂结构的变化，如特定表面积的降低和Cr6物种数量的减少。这些变化可以通过XPS、DRS和拉曼光谱等技术进行监控。通过理解失活机制以及Cr6和Cr3物种的作用，研究者可以优化催化剂制备和操作条件，以延长催化剂的寿命和效率。

总之，孤立于氧化物材料上的金属中心能够通过Mars-van Krevelen过程和H摘取等机制有效地活化C-H键。在工业应用中，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，这些原理被利用来设计保持适当金属氧化状态并优化Cr6和Cr3物种平衡的催化剂，以实现高活性和选择性。
