Industrial catalysts, particularly chromium oxide catalysts supported on alumina, play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce propene and isobutene. Advanced spectroscopic tools allow researchers to gain insights into the dehydrogenation sites on these catalyst surfaces. Through in situ spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, it is possible to monitor the transformation of surface chromium species during alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, these studies have revealed that surface chromium hexavalent species (Cr6) are reduced to trivalent species (Cr3) under reaction conditions, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The formation of pseudo-octahedral Cr3 species indicates the presence of coordinatively unsaturated sites, which are essential for C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis.

工业催化剂，尤其是铬氧化物催化剂负载在氧化铝上，在丙烯和异丁烯的工业生产中起着关键作用。高级光谱技术允许研究者获得关于这些催化剂表面脱氢化位点的详细信息。通过原位光谱技术，如拉曼光谱和反射光谱，可以在烷烃脱氢反应过程中监测表面铬物种的变化。具体来说，这些研究表明，表面六价铬物种（Cr6）在烷烃存在下被还原为三价物种（Cr3），促进脱氢过程。形成伪八面体Cr3物种表明存在未配位位点，对于均相催化中的C-H键活化至关重要。
