Industrial heterogeneous catalysts, particularly chromium oxide supported on aluminum oxide (Cr/Al2O3), facilitate the activation of C-H bonds through the creation of isolated metal centers on the oxide material. These centers enable the abstraction of hydrogen atoms (H-abstraction) or the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, where electrons are transferred between the metal center and the substrate, leading to the formation of reactive intermediates. In the context of industrial selective oxidation, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, these principles are crucial. Chromium, in its various oxidation states, acts as a Lewis acid, attracting electrons from the substrate and promoting the cleavage of C-H bonds. As the process occurs, the chromium species undergo reduction, forming coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 sites, which are essential for the subsequent oxidation reactions.

The industrial application of these catalysts involves a cycle of oxidation, dehydrogenation, and recalcination. Over time, this process leads to a decrease in the efficiency of the catalyst, as evidenced by a decline in the amount of hydrogen or carbon monoxide consumed during reduction steps, indicating incomplete reoxidation of the reduced Cr3 species. This deactivation is a significant concern, necessitating the development of strategies to maintain or restore the catalyst's activity and selectivity throughout its operational life.

工业异质催化剂，特别是铝氧化物支持的铬氧化物（Cr/Al2O3），通过在氧化物材料上形成孤立的金属中心来促进C-H键的激活。这些中心通过氢原子的提取（H-提取）或Mars van Krevelen机制，即金属中心和基体之间的电子转移，导致形成活性中间体，从而促进C-H键的断裂。在工业选择性氧化中，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，这些原理至关重要。铬以各种氧化状态存在，作为路易斯酸，吸引基体的电子并促进C-H键的裂解。随着过程进行，铬物种经历还原，形成配位不饱和的Cr3位点，这对于后续氧化反应是必不可少的。

工业应用中催化剂的工作流程涉及氧化、脱氢和再活化循环。随着时间的推移，这一过程会导致催化剂效率下降，表现为还原步骤中消耗的氢或一氧化碳量减少，表明还原后的Cr3物种未能完全重新氧化。这种失活是一个重要问题，需要发展策略以维持或恢复催化剂的活性和选择性，使其在整个操作周期内保持高效。
