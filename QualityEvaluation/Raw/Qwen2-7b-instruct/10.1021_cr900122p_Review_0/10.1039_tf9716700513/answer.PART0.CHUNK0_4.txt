[3] "The property of the pure alumina catalysts which correlates best with the hydrogen-deuterium exchange activity is the Lewis acidity."

[5] "On all the oxides studied the exchange of propane with deuterium is a stepwise process involving replacement of one hydrogen atom at a time."
[6] "Catalytic aluminas possess acid-base properties which are responsible for their activity in reactions such as the dehydration of a1cohols."
[7] "In addition to these acid-base properties, catalytic aluminas possess well-marked oxidizing-reducing (redox) properties 2-4 which can promote electron-transfer reactions at the alumina surface."
[8] "The object of the present study was to see whether a correlation exists between catalytic activity for the exchange of the hydrogen in n-propane with deuterium and electron-transfer activity of the oxide surface."

The literature discusses the catalytic activity of oxide catalysts, specifically focusing on alumina catalysts. The key points regarding electron-transfer activity and catalytic exchange of hydrogen involve:

1. Electron-transfer activity in aluminas peaks in the temperature range of 400-800°C, with a sharp maximum around 530-560°C.
2. The Lewis acidity of pure alumina catalysts correlates best with hydrogen-deuterium exchange activity.
3. Reducing centers on the surface play an essential role in the exchange reaction, with weaker sites being more important.
4. The exchange of propane with deuterium is a stepwise process involving the replacement of one hydrogen atom at a time.
5. Catalytic aluminas exhibit acid-base properties responsible for their activity in reactions like alcohol dehydration, and they also possess strong oxidizing-reducing (redox) properties that facilitate electron-transfer reactions at the alumina surface.
6. The study aimed to explore if there is a correlation between catalytic activity for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and electron-transfer activity of the oxide surface.

文献主要讨论了氧化物催化剂的催化活性，特别是氧化铝催化剂。关于电子转移活动和氢氘交换活性的关键点包括：

1. 在400-800°C的温度范围内，电子转移活动在400-800°C之间达到峰值，最大值集中在530-560°C。
2. 纯氧化铝催化剂的Lewis酸性与氢氘交换活性最佳相关。
3. 表面的还原中心在交换反应中扮演着重要角色，较弱的位点更为关键。
4. 氢气与氘的交换是一个逐步过程，涉及单个氢原子的替换。
5. 催化氧化铝具有负责它们在如醇脱水等反应中的活性的酸碱性质，以及强烈的氧化还原（红氧化）性质，这可以在铝表面促进电子转移反应。
6. 研究旨在探索氢氘交换催化活性与氧化物表面的电子转移活性之间是否存在相关性。
