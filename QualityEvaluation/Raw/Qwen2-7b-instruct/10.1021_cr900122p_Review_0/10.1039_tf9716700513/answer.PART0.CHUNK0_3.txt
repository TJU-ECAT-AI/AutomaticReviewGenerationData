[1] "Electron-transfer and the Catalytic Activity of Oxide Catalysts Part 1 .-Electron-transfer Activity of Alumina Catalysts and their Activity for the Catalytic Exchange of the Hydrogen in Propane with Deuterium"
[2] "The exchange reaction of propane with deuterium has been studied over a number of oxide surfaces."
[3] "The object of the present study was to see whether a correlation exists between catalytic activity for the exchange of the hydrogen in n-propane with deuterium and electron-transfer activity of the oxide surface."
[4] "Parallel measurements of surface acidity, surface area and propane adsorption are also reported."
[5] "The catalyst was then transferred to the reaction vessel used for the exchange experiments, or to the side-arm of the reaction tube used for the e.s.r. measurements, where it was further heated for 1 h with continuous pumping at the same temperatwe as that used in the pretreatment, followed by two 1.5 h heating periods in 10 an of oxygen with a 30 min interval for evacuation between the oxygen treat- ments."
[6] "Deuterated alumina was prepared by two methods."
[7] "Activation of all catalyst samples involved pretreatment in flowing oxygen in an electric muffle furnace for 1 h at temperatures between 100 and 11OO"C, followed by cooling at mmHg over phosphoric oxide for 30 min."
[8] "Exchange of propane with deuterium is a stepwise process involving replacement of one hydrogen atom at a time."
[9] "Catalytic aluminas possess acid-base properties which are responsible for their activity in reactions such as the dehydration of a1cohols."
[10] "In addition to these acid-base properties, catalytic aluminas possess well-marked oxidizing-reducing (redox) properties 2-4 which can promote electron-transfer reactions at the alumina surface."
[11] "The exchange reaction involves the replacement of one hydrogen atom at a time."
[12] "The exchange reaction is a stepwise process."
[13] "The exchange reaction does not involve the hydroxyl groups in alumina."
[14] "Bronsted acid centres on the silica-alumina surface are not important in the catalytic exchange reaction."
[15] "High reducing activity is not alone decisive for the exchange process."
[16] "Lewis acidity correlates best with hydrogen-deuterium exchange activity."
[17] "Blocking experiments with electron donor and acceptor molecules show that reducing centres play an essential role."
[18] "The weaker sites, both electron-donor and electron-acceptor, are important."
[19] "Blocking of electron-deficient sites reduces the catalytic activity for the exchange reaction."
