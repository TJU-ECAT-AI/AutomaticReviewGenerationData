[2] "Since these temperatures are well in excess of those leading to maximum surface area and to maximum propane adsorption (-35OoC), some specific property of the surface must be involved in the exchange reaction."
[3] "The property of the pure alumina catalysts which correlates best with the hydrogen-deuterium exchange activity is the Lewis acidity."
[4] "Blocking experiments with electron-acceptor molecules show, however,that the reducing centres on the surface play an essential role."
[5] "The almost negligible activity found in the silica-alumina catalysts indicates clearly that Bronsted acid centres, which are freely available on the silica-alumina surface,l are not important in the catalytic exchange reaction."
[6] "Present results indicate that these weaker electron-deficient sites, which are capable of Lewis acid-Lewis base reactions but which are insufficiently strong to bring about cation-radical formation, are involved in the exchange reaction with propane."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, like converting butane to maleic anhydride. In the conversion process, the isolated metal centers act as electron donors or acceptors, participating in redox reactions to activate the C-H bonds in the alkane. The specifics of these reactions depend on the type of oxide material, the structure of the metal centers, and the reaction conditions. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride involves the activation of the C-H bond in butane, followed by the selective oxidation to form maleic anhydride. This process typically requires a catalyst with well-defined metal centers that can facilitate the necessary electron transfer and redox chemistry to achieve the desired conversion.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中通过Mars van Krevelen和H抽象等机制促进C-H键活化，这在异相催化中起着关键作用。这些原理被应用于工业选择性氧化烷烃，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。在转化过程中，孤立的金属中心作为电子供体或受体参与还原反应来活化烷烃中的C-H键。这些反应的具体细节取决于氧化物材料的类型、金属中心的结构以及反应条件。将丁烷转化为马来酸酐涉及激活丁烷中的C-H键，随后进行选择性氧化形成马来酸酐。这一过程通常需要具有明确金属中心的催化剂，这些中心能够促进必要的电子转移和还原化学反应，以实现所需的转换。
