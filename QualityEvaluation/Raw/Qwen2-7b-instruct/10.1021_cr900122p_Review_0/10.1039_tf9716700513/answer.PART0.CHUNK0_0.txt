[1] "The exchange reaction of propane with deuterium has been studied over a number of oxide surfaces. Exchange activity in aluminas is virtually confined to catalysts activated in the temperature range 400-8OO0C, with a sharp maximum in activity around 530-560C."
[2] "Since these temperatures are well in excess of those leading to maximum surface area and to maximum propane adsorption (-35OoC), some specific property of the surface must be involved in the exchange reaction."
[3] "The property of the pure alumina catalysts which correlates best with the hydrogen-deuterium exchange activity is the Lewis acidity."
[4] "Blocking experiments with electron-acceptor molecules show, however,that the reducing centres on the surface play an essential role. In each case the weaker sites are important."
[5] "On all the oxides studied the exchange of propane with deuterium is a stepwise process involving replacement of one hydrogen atom at a time."

The activation of catalysts for the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction is primarily confined to a temperature range of 400-800°C, with a peak around 530-560°C. This is beyond the temperatures that maximize surface area and propane adsorption. The key property related to the exchange activity is Lewis acidity, which correlates best with the exchange activity. Electron-acceptor molecules can block the reducing centers on the surface, showing their essential role. The exchange reaction is stepwise, replacing one hydrogen atom at a time.

氢氘交换反应的催化剂激活主要集中在400-800°C的范围内，峰值在530-560°C左右。这远远超过了表面面积和丙烷吸附量达到最大值的温度。与交换活性相关的关键属性是路易斯酸度，它与交换活性的关系最好。电子接受分子可以阻塞表面的还原中心，显示出它们在反应中的重要性。交换反应是分步进行的，一次替换一个氢原子。

[1] "The object of the present study was to see whether a correlation exists between catalytic activity for the exchange of the hydrogen in n-propane with deuterium and electron-transfer activity of the oxide surface."
[2] "In the exchange reactions in acid solution, proton transfer has often been inoked,although the postulation of the transition state as aprotonated molecule may, in many cases, be too simple."
[3] "Few studies have been reported on the exchange reaction on oxide catalysts."
[4] "A number of workers have shown that alumina catalysts are more active in hydrogen-deuterium exchange than are alumina catalysts containing silica."
[5] "Exchange reactions of the hydrogen in hydrocarbons with deuterium on evaporated metal films have been widely investigated and in some cases the basic processes are well understood."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The aim of the current research was to determine if there is a connection between the catalytic efficiency for the hydrogen-deuterium exchange in n-propane and the electron-transfer capability of the oxide surface. In acid solution, proton transfer is commonly invoked in exchange reactions, but this assumption might oversimplify the transition state in many cases. Few studies have explored hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions on oxide catalysts. Alumina catalysts exhibit greater activity in hydrogen-deuterium exchange compared to alumina catalysts containing silica. Hydrocarbon hydrogen exchange with deuterium on evaporated metal films has been extensively studied, with clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms in some instances.

当前研究的目的是确定氢氘交换在n-丙烷中和氧化物表面的电子转移活性之间是否存在相关性。在酸溶液中，通常通过假设质子转移来解释交换反应，但在许多情况下，这种假设可能过于简化过渡状态。很少有关于氧化物催化剂上氢氘交换反应的研究报告。与含硅的氧化铝催化剂相比，纯氧化铝催化剂在氢氘交换中的活性更高。对碳氢化合物中的氢与氘在蒸发金属薄膜上的交换反应进行了广泛研究，在某些情况下，基本过程已被充分理解。

In experiments aiming to coat the alumina surface with an organic adsorbate, the activation method varied from the previously detailed procedure by reducing the sample outgassing time from 11 to 8 hours. The objective of the present study was to investigate if a relationship exists between the catalytic efficiency for hydrogen-deuterium exchange in n-propane and the electron-transfer activity of the oxide surface. Surface acidity, surface area, and propane adsorption measurements were also concurrently documented.
