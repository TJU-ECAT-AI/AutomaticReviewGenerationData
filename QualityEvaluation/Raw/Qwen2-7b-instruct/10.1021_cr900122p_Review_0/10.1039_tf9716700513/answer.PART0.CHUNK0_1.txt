[1] "Hydrogen-deuterium exchange activity in aluminas is virtually confined to catalysts activated in the temperature range 40O-80O0C, with a sharp maximum in activity around 530-560C."
[2] "Significant activity for this isotopic exchange reaction at 20C developed only at dehydration temperatures above 400C."
[3] "Although the propane molecule possesses two kinds of hydrogen atom-the six in the methyl groups and the two in the methylene group-it was not possible by mass spectrometry to distinguish between the exchange of the atoms in the two positions."
[4] "Catalysts activated at 350°C, e.g., having maximum surface area and propane adsorption, were almost inactive for the propane + deuterium exchange reaction."
[5] "The property of the pure alumina catalysts which correlates best with the hydrogen-deuterium exchange activity is the Lewis acidity."
[6] "Since the hydrogen in propane exchanges readily with deuterium at room temperature over alumina, it is significant that the rate of exchange of the deuterium in perdeuteropropane with the hydrogen of alumina is negligible under these conditions, as is the exchange of the hydrogen in propane with deuterated alumina."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, particularly alumina, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These processes are crucial in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of a hydrogen atom from an alkane to an oxygen atom in a catalyst, forming a carbocation. Subsequently, this carbocation reacts with the oxygen atom to form a product. In the case of H-abstraction, a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the alkane, leading to the formation of a carbocation. This carbocation can then react with oxygen to produce a variety of products, depending on the specific conditions and catalyst used.

The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example of the application of these principles. Butane is oxidized in the presence of a suitable catalyst, such as a supported vanadium catalyst, to produce maleic anhydride. The catalyst provides a surface for the reaction to occur, and the metal centers facilitate the breaking of the C-H bonds in butane, allowing for the selective oxidation to maleic anhydride. The high selectivity and yield of maleic anhydride make this process industrially valuable.

氧化物材料中的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen和H抽象等机制在异相催化中促进C-H键活化。这些过程对于工业选择性氧化烷烃至关重要，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及从烷烃向催化剂中的氧原子转移一个氢原子，形成一个碳正离子。随后，这个碳正离子与氧原子反应生成产物。H抽象是指从烷烃中抽象一个氢原子，导致形成一个碳正离子。这个碳正离子可以与氧气反应生成各种产物，这取决于具体条件和使用的催化剂类型。

将丁烷转化为马来酸酐是一个应用这些原则的例子。在适当的催化剂，如支持的钒催化剂的存在下，丁烷被氧化以产生马来酸酐。催化剂提供了一个反应发生的表面，金属中心促进了丁烷中C-H键的断裂，允许选择性氧化为马来酸酐。高选择性和马来酸酐的产率使这一过程在工业上具有价值。
