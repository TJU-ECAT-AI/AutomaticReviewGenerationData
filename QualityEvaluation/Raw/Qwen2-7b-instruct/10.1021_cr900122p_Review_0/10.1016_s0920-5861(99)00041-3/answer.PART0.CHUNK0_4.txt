[1] "Some aspects concerning the chemistry of oxidative transformation of parafns catalyzed by different classes of materials are examined."
[2] "The interaction between the catalyst surface and the gas phase, and how surface phenomena are affected by homogeneous phenomena,plays an important role in conditioning the nal performance in terms of product distribution."
[3] "Examples of the points which have been considered as key factors in determining the pathway of alkane transformation to the product of selective oxidation are: the activation of oxygen and of the alkane, and specifically: the role of adsorbed oxygen species [14,6,7,11]; the importance of the mode of alkane adsorption [13,5]."
[4] "The density of the active sites [3,9,10], which can be explained by the site isolation theory [23]; the role of surface acidity [8,11]; the need for intrinsic surface polyfunctional-ity [9,10]."
[5] "The mechanism which operates is completely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical species). This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions,such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity)."
[6] "In fact, more oxidized surfaces usually result in more active but less selective catalysts, while the opposite is true for more reduced surfaces."
[7] "The band at 700 nm is typical of Mo5 in heteropoly- blues, and its intensity is approximately proportional to the extent of molybdenum reduction [79]."
[8] "The catalyst which operates under fuel-lean conditions is less reduced than the catalyst which operates under hydrocarbon-rich conditions."
[9] "The important role of the valence state of vanadium in affecting the catalytic properties in n-butane and butene oxidation over VPO catalysts has also been demonstrated by means of pulse tests and by an ex situ characterization of catalysts unloaded after reaction at different reaction conditions (i.e. different hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratios in the feed)."
[10] "At low n-butane conversion (i.e. under conditions in which the consecutive contribution of maleic anhydride combustion is negligible) the selectivity was proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, and that at high n-butane conversion the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreased as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increased."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing discrete active sites for the reaction. These centers are often referred to as discrete metal centers, and they are responsible for the activation of oxygen and alkane molecules. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are involved in these processes, which are crucial for the selective oxidation of alkanes. For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the density of the active sites, their reactivity, and the surface acidity play significant roles in determining the pathway of the reaction. The role of the valence state of vanadium, particularly in the form of vanadyl pyrophosphate, is critical in the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. The density of the active sites, the surface acidity, and the valence state of vanadium are all influenced by the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed, which affects the selectivity of the process. The site isolation theory explains why more oxidized surfaces result in more active but less selective catalysts, while more reduced surfaces are more selective but less active. The extent of molybdenum reduction is proportional to the intensity of the band at 700 nm, indicating the role of molybdenum reduction in the selectivity of the catalyst. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed significantly affects the selectivity of the process, particularly at low and high conversion rates of n-butane.

孤立金属中心在氧化合物材料上的激活对异质催化反应中的C-H键激活至关重要，它们提供了反应的活性位点。这些中心通常被称为离散金属中心，负责激活氧和烷烃分子。火星-范克雷伦机制和H抽取在这些过程中起着关键作用，对于烷烃的选择性氧化至关重要。例如，在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，活性位点的密度、其反应性以及表面酸度在决定反应途径方面起着重要作用。特别是，钒的价态在范亚磷酸盐的形式下对于丁烷向马来酸酐的选择性氧化至关重要。活性位点的密度、表面酸度和钒的价态都受到进料中碳氢化合物与氧的比例的影响，这影响了过程的选择性。位隔离理论解释了为什么更氧化的表面导致更活跃但选择性较低的催化剂，而更还原的表面则更具有选择性但活性较低。700nm波长带的强度与钼的还原程度成正比，表明钼的还原程度在催化剂的选择性中起着重要作用。进料中碳氢化合物与氧的比例显著影响了过程的选择性，尤其是在低和高丁烷转化率的情况下。
