[1] "The activation of oxygen and of the alkane, and specifically:
1.1. the role of adsorbed oxygen species [14,6,7,11];"

[2] "In fact, more oxidized surfaces usually result in more active but less selective catalysts, while the opposite is true for more reduced surfaces. This has been the fundamental driving force for the development of processes which operate in the presence of very low amounts of oxygen in the gas phase; other advantages are related to the absence of hazards associated with the possible formation of flammable mixtures (which are instead present when the combustible and the oxidant are co-fed)."

[3] "The role of different vanadium phosphate phases, and of the valence state of vanadium in the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride has been widely studied [9,16,61,86-95]. In general, the fundamental role of the vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7 as the active phase is recognized but it is generally believed that oxidized V5 sites, present as dispersed VOPO4 phases at the surface of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, or in the form of domains at the basal (100) face of (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in the formation of maleic anhydride."

[4] "The mechanism which operates in these cases usually involves a fundamental contribution of alkyl radical species which are generated at the catalyst surface and then: (i) react quickly in the adsorbed state (for instance, by being transformed to the corresponding olen via β-elimination, or by undergoing non-selective oxidative attack by adsorbed oxygen species), (ii) react further in the close proximity to the catalyst surface (i.e. in the boundary layer), or (iii) become transferred into the gas phase where the reaction proceeds."

[5] "For amounts of hydrocarbon which increase in the range 0-2 mol% (Fig. 3(a)), the rate of transformation of the parafn is proportional to the hydrocarbon content. In this range, the conversion of n-pentane decreases (but the rate of hydrocarbon depletion increases), the overall selectivity to maleic plus phthalic anhydride increases, and the ratio phthalic-to-maleic anhydride also increases."

1. Adsorbed oxygen species play a crucial role in activating oxygen and alkanes during heterogeneous catalysis. More oxidized surfaces tend to be more active but less selective, whereas more reduced surfaces are more selective but less active. Processes with low oxygen content in the gas phase are developed due to the absence of flammable mixture hazards.

2. The valence state of vanadium significantly influences the performance of catalysts in the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride. The vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7 is recognized as the active phase, and it is believed that oxidized V5 sites, either as dispersed VOPO4 phases or domains at the basal (100) face of (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in the formation of maleic anhydride.

3. In the case of light alkanes' oxidation, the mechanism often involves alkyl radical species generated at the catalyst surface. These radicals react quickly in the adsorbed state, either via β-elimination or oxidative attack by adsorbed oxygen species, or they react further near the catalyst surface in the boundary layer, or they are transferred into the gas phase where the reaction continues.

4. For low concentrations of pentane (0-2 mol%), the rate of transformation is proportional to the pentane content. Conversion of n-pentane decreases, but the rate of hydrocarbon depletion increases. The overall selectivity towards maleic and phthalic anhydrides rises, and the ratio of phthalic to maleic anhydrides also increases.

1. 吸附氧物种在异相催化中激活氧和烷烃起着关键作用。更氧化的表面倾向于更活跃但选择性较差，而更还原的表面则更选择性但活性较低。由于不存在形成可燃混合物的危险，开发了气体中氧含量低的过程。

2. 钒的价态显著影响了催化剂在n-丁烷选择性氧化为马来酸酐中的性能。被认为作为活性相的钒酸盐磷酸盐（VO）2P2O7，认为氧化的V5位点，以分散的VOPO4相形式出现在钒酸盐磷酸盐表面上，或者在（VO）2P2O7的（100）面上形成域，直接参与马来酸酐的形成。

3. 在轻烷烃氧化的情况下，机制通常涉及在催化剂表面生成的烷基自由基物种。这些自由基在吸附状态下快速反应，通过β消除或由吸附氧物种进行非选择性氧化攻击，或者在催化剂表面附近进一步反应，在边界层内，或者转移到气体相继续反应。

4. 对于低浓度的戊烷（0-2 mol%），转化率与戊烷含量成正比。n-戊烷的转化率降低，但碳氢化合物消耗速率增加。总体上，对马来酸酐和邻苯二甲酸酐的选择性增加，并且马来酸酐与邻苯二甲酸酐的比例也增加。
