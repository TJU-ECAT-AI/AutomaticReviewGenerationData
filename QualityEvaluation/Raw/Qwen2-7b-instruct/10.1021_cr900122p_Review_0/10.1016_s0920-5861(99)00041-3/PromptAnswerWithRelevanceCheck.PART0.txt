[1] "The role of isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitates C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. These centers can act as electron donors or acceptors, creating a redox environment that aids in the activation of C-H bonds."
[2] "Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms are involved in these processes. Mars van Krevelen involves the transfer of electrons between metal centers, creating an electron-rich or electron-deficient state that facilitates the breaking of C-H bonds. H-abstraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from a molecule, often facilitated by a proton donor or acceptor, which creates a carbocation or a carbanion, respectively, that can then undergo further reactions."
[3] "In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied by designing catalysts with specific oxide materials and metal centers that can effectively activate C-H bonds in the desired direction. For example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the catalyst must be able to activate the C-H bonds in butane specifically for the formation of the maleic anhydride product."
[4] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride utilizes a catalyst that contains metal centers on an oxide material. The metal centers create a redox environment that facilitates the breaking of C-H bonds in butane. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism plays a role in the electron transfer between metal centers, while H-abstraction facilitates the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes further reactions to form maleic anhydride."

2. Mars van Krevelen和H抽象机制是这些过程的关键。Mars van Krevelen涉及金属中心之间的电子转移，创建一个电子富余或电子缺乏的状态，以促进C-H键的断裂。H抽象涉及从分子中移除一个氢原子，通常由电子供体或接受者进行，以形成一个碳正离子或碳负离子，然后进一步反应。
3. 在工业上选择性氧化烷烃中，通过设计具有特定氧化物材料和金属中心的催化剂，可以在所需方向激活烷烃中的C-H键。例如，在将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，催化剂必须能够特别激活丁烷中的C-H键以形成马来酸酐产物。
4. 将丁烷转化为马来酸酐使用包含金属中心的氧化物材料催化剂。金属中心创建一个还原氧化环境来断裂C-H键。Mars van Krevelen促进了电子转移，而H抽象形成了一个碳正离子中间体，该中间体进一步反应生成马来酸酐。

[1] "The activation of oxygen and of the alkane, and specifically:
1.1. the role of adsorbed oxygen species [14,6,7,11];"

[2] "In fact, more oxidized surfaces usually result in more active but less selective catalysts, while the opposite is true for more reduced surfaces. This has been the fundamental driving force for the development of processes which operate in the presence of very low amounts of oxygen in the gas phase; other advantages are related to the absence of hazards associated with the possible formation of flammable mixtures (which are instead present when the combustible and the oxidant are co-fed)."

[3] "The role of different vanadium phosphate phases, and of the valence state of vanadium in the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride has been widely studied [9,16,61,86-95]. In general, the fundamental role of the vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7 as the active phase is recognized but it is generally believed that oxidized V5 sites, present as dispersed VOPO4 phases at the surface of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, or in the form of domains at the basal (100) face of (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in the formation of maleic anhydride."

[4] "The mechanism which operates in these cases usually involves a fundamental contribution of alkyl radical species which are generated at the catalyst surface and then: (i) react quickly in the adsorbed state (for instance, by being transformed to the corresponding olen via β-elimination, or by undergoing non-selective oxidative attack by adsorbed oxygen species), (ii) react further in the close proximity to the catalyst surface (i.e. in the boundary layer), or (iii) become transferred into the gas phase where the reaction proceeds."

[5] "For amounts of hydrocarbon which increase in the range 0-2 mol% (Fig. 3(a)), the rate of transformation of the parafn is proportional to the hydrocarbon content. In this range, the conversion of n-pentane decreases (but the rate of hydrocarbon depletion increases), the overall selectivity to maleic plus phthalic anhydride increases, and the ratio phthalic-to-maleic anhydride also increases."

1. Adsorbed oxygen species play a crucial role in activating oxygen and alkanes during heterogeneous catalysis. More oxidized surfaces tend to be more active but less selective, whereas more reduced surfaces are more selective but less active. Processes with low oxygen content in the gas phase are developed due to the absence of flammable mixture hazards.

2. The valence state of vanadium significantly influences the performance of catalysts in the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride. The vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7 is recognized as the active phase, and it is believed that oxidized V5 sites, either as dispersed VOPO4 phases or domains at the basal (100) face of (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in the formation of maleic anhydride.

3. In the case of light alkanes' oxidation, the mechanism often involves alkyl radical species generated at the catalyst surface. These radicals react quickly in the adsorbed state, either via β-elimination or oxidative attack by adsorbed oxygen species, or they react further near the catalyst surface in the boundary layer, or they are transferred into the gas phase where the reaction continues.

4. For low concentrations of pentane (0-2 mol%), the rate of transformation is proportional to the pentane content. Conversion of n-pentane decreases, but the rate of hydrocarbon depletion increases. The overall selectivity towards maleic and phthalic anhydrides rises, and the ratio of phthalic to maleic anhydrides also increases.

1. 吸附氧物种在异相催化中激活氧和烷烃起着关键作用。更氧化的表面倾向于更活跃但选择性较差，而更还原的表面则更选择性但活性较低。由于不存在形成可燃混合物的危险，开发了气体中氧含量低的过程。

2. 钒的价态显著影响了催化剂在n-丁烷选择性氧化为马来酸酐中的性能。被认为作为活性相的钒酸盐磷酸盐（VO）2P2O7，认为氧化的V5位点，以分散的VOPO4相形式出现在钒酸盐磷酸盐表面上，或者在（VO）2P2O7的（100）面上形成域，直接参与马来酸酐的形成。

3. 在轻烷烃氧化的情况下，机制通常涉及在催化剂表面生成的烷基自由基物种。这些自由基在吸附状态下快速反应，通过β消除或由吸附氧物种进行非选择性氧化攻击，或者在催化剂表面附近进一步反应，在边界层内，或者转移到气体相继续反应。

4. 对于低浓度的戊烷（0-2 mol%），转化率与戊烷含量成正比。n-戊烷的转化率降低，但碳氢化合物消耗速率增加。总体上，对马来酸酐和邻苯二甲酸酐的选择性增加，并且马来酸酐与邻苯二甲酸酐的比例也增加。

[2] "For example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, isolated metal centers on vanadium phosphate catalysts are crucial for the multi-electron transformation of n-butane."

[6] "An increase in oxygen partial pressure can favor the selectivity to the anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olen never reaches the same values as with n-butane."
[7] "The key point of the monolith-type reactor is the large temperature difference between the catalyst surface (where temperatures are as high as 1000°C) and the gas phase, allowing the reaction pathway to be directed towards the formation of olens."
[8] "Noble metal (Pt, Pd, Rh) coated ceramic foam monoliths used in these reactors are usually considered as being nonselective for the oxidation of alkanes, but control of the oxygen-to-hydrocarbon ratio and the high surface temperature reached on the very active metal surface allows the reaction pathway to be directed towards the formation of olens."

In the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, isolated metal centers on vanadium phosphate catalysts are crucial for the multi-electron transformation of n-butane. The distribution of products in n-butane oxidation over VPO catalysts is influenced by the availability of O-insertion sites, which is determined by the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed.

However, when the surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the scarcity of O-insertion sites hinders the formation of final stable products. An increase in oxygen partial pressure can favor the selectivity to anhydrides. Noble metal-coated ceramic foam monoliths in monolith-type reactors are considered nonselective for alkane oxidation, but control of the oxygen-to-hydrocarbon ratio and the high surface temperature on the active metal surface directs the reaction pathway towards the formation of olens.

1. 孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料上通过Mars-van Krevelen和H-抽象途径激活C-H键。在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，范德华磷酸催化剂上的孤立金属中心对于n-丁烷的多电子转化至关重要。n-丁烷在VPO催化剂上的氧化过程中，产品的分布受到表面插入位点可用性的影响，这由进料中的碳氢化合物与氧的比例决定。当催化剂表面未饱和时，气体相的氧化能力降低有利于表面情况，从而促进形成最终稳定的产物。然而，当表面被吸附物种饱和时，由于表面插入位点稀缺，最终稳定产物的形成受阻。氧气分压的增加可以促进选择性到酸酐。在多孔体反应器中使用的铂、钯、铑等贵金属涂层陶瓷泡沫多孔体被认为是烷烃氧化的非选择性催化剂，但控制氧气与碳氢化合物的比例和活性金属表面达到的高温允许反应路径导向形成醇类。

[1] "Some aspects concerning the chemistry of oxidative transformation of parafns catalyzed by different classes of materials are examined."
[2] "The interaction between the catalyst surface and the gas phase, and how surface phenomena are affected by homogeneous phenomena,plays an important role in conditioning the nal performance in terms of product distribution."
[3] "Examples of the points which have been considered as key factors in determining the pathway of alkane transformation to the product of selective oxidation are: the activation of oxygen and of the alkane, and specifically: the role of adsorbed oxygen species [14,6,7,11]; the importance of the mode of alkane adsorption [13,5]."
[4] "The density of the active sites [3,9,10], which can be explained by the site isolation theory [23]; the role of surface acidity [8,11]; the need for intrinsic surface polyfunctional-ity [9,10]."
[5] "The mechanism which operates is completely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical species). This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions,such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity)."
[6] "In fact, more oxidized surfaces usually result in more active but less selective catalysts, while the opposite is true for more reduced surfaces."
[7] "The band at 700 nm is typical of Mo5 in heteropoly- blues, and its intensity is approximately proportional to the extent of molybdenum reduction [79]."

[9] "The important role of the valence state of vanadium in affecting the catalytic properties in n-butane and butene oxidation over VPO catalysts has also been demonstrated by means of pulse tests and by an ex situ characterization of catalysts unloaded after reaction at different reaction conditions (i.e. different hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratios in the feed)."
[10] "At low n-butane conversion (i.e. under conditions in which the consecutive contribution of maleic anhydride combustion is negligible) the selectivity was proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, and that at high n-butane conversion the selectivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreased as the average degree of oxidation of vanadium increased."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing discrete active sites for the reaction. These centers are often referred to as discrete metal centers, and they are responsible for the activation of oxygen and alkane molecules. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are involved in these processes, which are crucial for the selective oxidation of alkanes. For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the density of the active sites, their reactivity, and the surface acidity play significant roles in determining the pathway of the reaction. The role of the valence state of vanadium, particularly in the form of vanadyl pyrophosphate, is critical in the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. The density of the active sites, the surface acidity, and the valence state of vanadium are all influenced by the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed, which affects the selectivity of the process. The site isolation theory explains why more oxidized surfaces result in more active but less selective catalysts, while more reduced surfaces are more selective but less active. The extent of molybdenum reduction is proportional to the intensity of the band at 700 nm, indicating the role of molybdenum reduction in the selectivity of the catalyst. The hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the feed significantly affects the selectivity of the process, particularly at low and high conversion rates of n-butane.

孤立金属中心在氧化合物材料上的激活对异质催化反应中的C-H键激活至关重要，它们提供了反应的活性位点。这些中心通常被称为离散金属中心，负责激活氧和烷烃分子。火星-范克雷伦机制和H抽取在这些过程中起着关键作用，对于烷烃的选择性氧化至关重要。例如，在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，活性位点的密度、其反应性以及表面酸度在决定反应途径方面起着重要作用。特别是，钒的价态在范亚磷酸盐的形式下对于丁烷向马来酸酐的选择性氧化至关重要。活性位点的密度、表面酸度和钒的价态都受到进料中碳氢化合物与氧的比例的影响，这影响了过程的选择性。位隔离理论解释了为什么更氧化的表面导致更活跃但选择性较低的催化剂，而更还原的表面则更具有选择性但活性较低。700nm波长带的强度与钼的还原程度成正比，表明钼的还原程度在催化剂的选择性中起着重要作用。进料中碳氢化合物与氧的比例显著影响了过程的选择性，尤其是在低和高丁烷转化率的情况下。
