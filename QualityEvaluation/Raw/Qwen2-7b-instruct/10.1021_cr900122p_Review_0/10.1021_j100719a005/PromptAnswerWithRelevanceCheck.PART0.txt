[1] "Some of the finer details of the interaction of benzene with the surface of an alumina catalyst have been in- vestigated with the use o f deuterium tracers.

1. The investigation revealed that the exchange of benzene hydrogen atoms with deuterium (D) occurred readily at room temperature, while the intermolecular redistribution of hydrogen and deuterium atoms between benzene and deuterobenzene happened at least 10-20 times faster under the same conditions. These reactions were believed to occur on the same sites, which were estimated to have a concentration of 6-15 x 1012 sites per cm2 based on COZ poisoning studies.

2. Other compounds like nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen (O2), water (HzO), and ammonia (NH3) had minimal impact on the exchange reaction.

3. The exchange reaction between benzene and deuterium showed a primary kinetic isotope effect, being faster than the exchange between deuterobenzene and hydrogen. This was attributed to a dissociative exchange mechanism where the cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) or carbon-deuterium (CD) bond was the rate-limiting step. The isotope effect ratio (kCH/kcD) was 2.

4. Benzene could also poison the hydrogen-deuterium equilibrium.

5. It seems that the activation energies for different bond types might not be the same, with the aromatic ring having a lower activation energy compared to olefinic or paraffinic C-H bonds.

6. Despite variations in absolute activation energies across different catalysts, the ratios of these activation energies seem to remain consistent in each system.

7. The poisoning effect of benzene on the hydrogen-deuterium equilibrium indicates that the catalytic sites involved in these reactions might not be the same as those in the isomerization of olefins, suggesting potential differences in the catalytic mechanisms.

1. 研究发现，苯与氧化铝催化剂表面之间的氢交换在室温下易于进行，而氢和氘原子在苯与二氘苯之间进行分子内重排的速度至少快了10-20倍。这些反应似乎发生在相同的位置上，其浓度估计为每平方厘米6-15 x 1012个位点，根据COZ中毒的研究确定。

2. 其他化合物如氮氧化物（NO）、一氧化碳（CO）、氧气（O2）、水（HzO）和氨（NH3）对交换反应的影响很小。

3. 苯与氘的交换反应显示出主要的同位素效应，比二氘苯与氢的交换更快；这种效应被归因于一个解离性交换机制，在其中碳-氢（CH）或碳-氘（CD）键的断裂是速率限制步骤。同位素效应比率（kCH/kcD）为2。

4. 苯也能毒害氢-氘平衡。

5. 看起来不同键类型的活化能可能不同，芳香环的活化能低于烯烃或烷基碳氢键。

6. 尽管不同催化剂的绝对活化能存在差异，但每个系统中活化能的比例似乎保持不变。

7. 苯对氢-氘平衡的毒害表明，这些反应涉及的催化位点可能不同于烯烃异构化，这暗示可能存在不同的催化机制。

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen process and H-abstraction. In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied by utilizing catalysts with these active sites to selectively oxidize specific functional groups in the alkane molecules. As an example, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride involves the selective oxidation of butane by oxygen at the active sites on the catalyst, leading to the formation of maleic anhydride while minimizing side reactions. This is achieved by tuning the properties of the catalyst, such as its surface chemistry and composition, to ensure that the desired C-H bond is activated and oxidized efficiently, while other bonds remain intact.

The poisoning of the catalyst by certain compounds indicates the presence of active sites that are susceptible to adsorption. Among these, carbon dioxide (CO2) was found to be the most effective poison, suggesting that it interacts specifically with these active sites. This interaction leads to a decrease in the catalyst's activity, as observed in the poisoning experiments. The absence of significant poisoning by other compounds, such as nitrogen oxides (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), water (H2O), oxygen (O2), and ammonia (NH3), suggests that these substances do not interact effectively with the active sites, or that their adsorption does not inhibit the catalytic activity in the same manner as CO2.

The stepwise nature of the exchange reactions is confirmed by the unity of the reaction multiplicity (M), indicating that each exchange event follows a sequential process. The poisoning experiments revealed that the catalyst has a limited number of active sites, estimated to be around 6-15 x 10^12 sites per cm². The presence of exposed aluminum ions (Al3+) on the catalyst surface is hypothesized to be the location of these active sites, which facilitate the C-H bond activation and subsequent reactions. The high concentration of active sites allows for efficient activation and transformation of the alkane molecules, leading to the desired product formation.

在氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen过程和H抽象机制促进了C-H键的异构化。在烷烃选择性氧化的工业应用中，这些原理是通过调整催化剂的性质来实现的，以确保选择性地氧化特定的烷烃功能团，同时避免其他副反应的发生。例如，将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程涉及在催化剂活性位点上选择性地氧化丁烷分子中的氧原子，从而形成马来酸酐，同时保持其他化学键的完整性。

某些化合物对催化剂的毒害表明存在特定的活性位点，它们容易被吸附。其中，二氧化碳（CO2）被发现是最有效的毒剂，这暗示它与这些活性位点有特定的相互作用，导致催化剂活性的下降，如在毒害实验中观察到的那样。其他化合物如氮氧化物（NO）、一氧化碳（CO）、水（H2O）、氧气（O2）和氨（NH3）对催化剂活性的影响较小，这可能意味着它们不能有效与活性位点相互作用，或者其吸附不抑制催化活性。

交换反应的步进性质由反应多重性的统一（M）证实，表明每个交换事件遵循一个顺序过程。毒害实验揭示了催化剂具有有限数量的活性位点，估计为每平方厘米约6-15 x 10^12个位点。假设暴露的铝离子（Al3+）位于催化剂表面是这些活性位点的位置，它们促进C-H键的激活和后续反应。高浓度的活性位点使得烷烃分子能够高效地被激活并转化为所需产品。

活性位点的存在和特性对于催化剂的性能至关重要，它们决定了催化反应的选择性和效率。通过对活性位点的精确控制和理解，可以进一步优化催化剂设计，提高目标产物的产率，并减少副产品的生成。

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, specifically alumina, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The interaction of benzene with the alumina surface involves a dissociative exchange mechanism, where the initial interaction likely involves the attraction of the π system in the molecule to the metal center. This process allows for the cleavage of the C-H bond, enabling the subsequent redistribution of hydrogen and deuterium atoms between molecules. The concentration of these active sites is estimated to be around 6-15 x 1012 sites/cm2. The poisoning experiments reveal that certain compounds like NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs do not significantly poison the catalyst, suggesting that the active sites might not be the same ones involved in reactions like isomerization in olefins. The absence of poisoning by ammonia indicates a chemical interaction with the alumina surface, yet this does not affect the exchange rate. The data suggest that aromatic and olefinic C-H bonds are more easily activated than paraffinic C-H bonds, pointing to differences in the activation energy for different types of C-H bonds. The poisoning experiments further elucidate the concentration of the active sites, with estimates ranging from 6-8 x 1012 sites/cm2.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen和H解离机制在均相催化中促进C-H键活化。苯与氧化铝表面的相互作用涉及一个解离交换机制，其中初始相互作用可能涉及分子中的π系统对金属中心的吸引。这一过程允许C-H键的断裂，进而使氢和重氢原子在分子间进行重新分配。这些活性位点的浓度估计约为6-15 x 1012个/cm2。中毒实验表明，某些化合物如NO、CO、HzO、0 2 和NHs不会显著中毒催化剂，这表明活性位点可能不是参与烯烃异构化等反应的相同位点。氨的存在缺乏对催化剂的中毒现象表明，它与氧化铝表面之间存在化学作用，但这种作用不影响交换速率。数据表明，芳香族和烯族C-H键比饱和C-H键更容易激活，指出不同类型C-H键的活化能可能存在差异。中毒实验进一步阐明了活性位点的浓度，估计范围从6-8 x 1012个/cm2。
