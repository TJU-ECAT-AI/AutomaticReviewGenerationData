[1] "Some of the finer details of the interaction of benzene with the surface of an alumina catalyst have been in- vestigated with the use o f deuterium tracers. Exchange of benzene H atoms with DZ occurred readily at room temperature, but intermolecular redistribution of H and D atoms between CeHe and CeDe occurred at least 10-20 times as rapidly under the same conditions."
[2] "Both reactions apparently took place on the same sites whose concentration was 6-15 x 1012 sites/cm2 as determined by COZ poisoning."
[3] "The exchange reaction with D z exhibited a primary kinetic isotope effect by being faster than CeDe-Hz exchange; the kCH/kcD = 2 was attributed to a dissociative exchange mechanism in which CH (or CD) cleavage wa3 rate limiting."
[4] "Benzene also poisoned the Hz-D2 equilibration."
[5] "All investigators2-416 have observed that the re- action multiplicity, M ,  is unity and have concluded that the exchange reactions are all stepwise."
[6] "Perhaps the most surprising result was the absence of significant poisoning with NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs."
[7] "Water caused some poisoning, but its effect was small compared with the devastating effect of COz."
[8] "The observation that there was no significant change in any of the exchange reaction characteristics when the catalyst was fully deuterated indicates that the vast majority of the catalyst H atoms, whose concentration is about 2 X 1014/cm2,s cannot be involved in the re- action mechanism."
[9] "Carbon dioxide was clearly the most effective poison tested. I f one assumes a 1:1 = site-poison molecule ratio, the poisoning intercept in Figure 3 gives a site density of about 15 X loL2 sites/cm2 for both the DZ exchange and the redistribution reactions."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen process and H-abstraction. In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied by utilizing catalysts with these active sites to selectively oxidize specific functional groups in the alkane molecules. As an example, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride involves the selective oxidation of butane by oxygen at the active sites on the catalyst, leading to the formation of maleic anhydride while minimizing side reactions. This is achieved by tuning the properties of the catalyst, such as its surface chemistry and composition, to ensure that the desired C-H bond is activated and oxidized efficiently, while other bonds remain intact.

The poisoning of the catalyst by certain compounds indicates the presence of active sites that are susceptible to adsorption. Among these, carbon dioxide (CO2) was found to be the most effective poison, suggesting that it interacts specifically with these active sites. This interaction leads to a decrease in the catalyst's activity, as observed in the poisoning experiments. The absence of significant poisoning by other compounds, such as nitrogen oxides (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), water (H2O), oxygen (O2), and ammonia (NH3), suggests that these substances do not interact effectively with the active sites, or that their adsorption does not inhibit the catalytic activity in the same manner as CO2.

The stepwise nature of the exchange reactions is confirmed by the unity of the reaction multiplicity (M), indicating that each exchange event follows a sequential process. The poisoning experiments revealed that the catalyst has a limited number of active sites, estimated to be around 6-15 x 10^12 sites per cm². The presence of exposed aluminum ions (Al3+) on the catalyst surface is hypothesized to be the location of these active sites, which facilitate the C-H bond activation and subsequent reactions. The high concentration of active sites allows for efficient activation and transformation of the alkane molecules, leading to the desired product formation.

在氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen过程和H抽象机制促进了C-H键的异构化。在烷烃选择性氧化的工业应用中，这些原理是通过调整催化剂的性质来实现的，以确保选择性地氧化特定的烷烃功能团，同时避免其他副反应的发生。例如，将丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程涉及在催化剂活性位点上选择性地氧化丁烷分子中的氧原子，从而形成马来酸酐，同时保持其他化学键的完整性。

某些化合物对催化剂的毒害表明存在特定的活性位点，它们容易被吸附。其中，二氧化碳（CO2）被发现是最有效的毒剂，这暗示它与这些活性位点有特定的相互作用，导致催化剂活性的下降，如在毒害实验中观察到的那样。其他化合物如氮氧化物（NO）、一氧化碳（CO）、水（H2O）、氧气（O2）和氨（NH3）对催化剂活性的影响较小，这可能意味着它们不能有效与活性位点相互作用，或者其吸附不抑制催化活性。

交换反应的步进性质由反应多重性的统一（M）证实，表明每个交换事件遵循一个顺序过程。毒害实验揭示了催化剂具有有限数量的活性位点，估计为每平方厘米约6-15 x 10^12个位点。假设暴露的铝离子（Al3+）位于催化剂表面是这些活性位点的位置，它们促进C-H键的激活和后续反应。高浓度的活性位点使得烷烃分子能够高效地被激活并转化为所需产品。

活性位点的存在和特性对于催化剂的性能至关重要，它们决定了催化反应的选择性和效率。通过对活性位点的精确控制和理解，可以进一步优化催化剂设计，提高目标产物的产率，并减少副产品的生成。
