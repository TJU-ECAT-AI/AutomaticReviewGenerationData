[1] "Some of the finer details of the interaction of benzene with the surface of an alumina catalyst have been in- vestigated with the use o f deuterium tracers. Exchange of benzene H atoms with DZ occurred readily at room temperature, but intermolecular redistribution of H and D atoms between CeHe and CeDe occurred at least 10-20 times as rapidly under the same conditions."
[2] "Both reactions apparently took place on the same sites whose concentration was 6-15 x 1012 sites/cm2 as determined by COZ poisoning."
[3] "Several other compounds (NO, CO, 02, HzO, and 3) had little poisoning effect on the exchange reaction."
[4] "The exchange reaction with D z exhibited a primary kinetic isotope effect by being faster than CeDe-Hz exchange; the kCH/kcD = 2 was attributed to a dissociative exchange mechanism in which CH (or CD) cleavage wa3 rate limiting."
[5] "Benzene also poisoned the Hz-D2 equilibration."
[6] "It appears that rather than hav- ing the same activation energies, each bond type may have its own unique activation energy with that for aromatic ring being lower than those for olefinic or for paraffinic C-H bonds."
[7] "While the absolute values may vary from one catalyst to another, the ratio of the acti- vation energies apparently remains about the same in each system."

1. The investigation revealed that the exchange of benzene hydrogen atoms with deuterium (D) occurred readily at room temperature, while the intermolecular redistribution of hydrogen and deuterium atoms between benzene and deuterobenzene happened at least 10-20 times faster under the same conditions. These reactions were believed to occur on the same sites, which were estimated to have a concentration of 6-15 x 1012 sites per cm2 based on COZ poisoning studies.

2. Other compounds like nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen (O2), water (HzO), and ammonia (NH3) had minimal impact on the exchange reaction.

3. The exchange reaction between benzene and deuterium showed a primary kinetic isotope effect, being faster than the exchange between deuterobenzene and hydrogen. This was attributed to a dissociative exchange mechanism where the cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) or carbon-deuterium (CD) bond was the rate-limiting step. The isotope effect ratio (kCH/kcD) was 2.

4. Benzene could also poison the hydrogen-deuterium equilibrium.

5. It seems that the activation energies for different bond types might not be the same, with the aromatic ring having a lower activation energy compared to olefinic or paraffinic C-H bonds.

6. Despite variations in absolute activation energies across different catalysts, the ratios of these activation energies seem to remain consistent in each system.

7. The poisoning effect of benzene on the hydrogen-deuterium equilibrium indicates that the catalytic sites involved in these reactions might not be the same as those in the isomerization of olefins, suggesting potential differences in the catalytic mechanisms.

1. 研究发现，苯与氧化铝催化剂表面之间的氢交换在室温下易于进行，而氢和氘原子在苯与二氘苯之间进行分子内重排的速度至少快了10-20倍。这些反应似乎发生在相同的位置上，其浓度估计为每平方厘米6-15 x 1012个位点，根据COZ中毒的研究确定。

2. 其他化合物如氮氧化物（NO）、一氧化碳（CO）、氧气（O2）、水（HzO）和氨（NH3）对交换反应的影响很小。

3. 苯与氘的交换反应显示出主要的同位素效应，比二氘苯与氢的交换更快；这种效应被归因于一个解离性交换机制，在其中碳-氢（CH）或碳-氘（CD）键的断裂是速率限制步骤。同位素效应比率（kCH/kcD）为2。

4. 苯也能毒害氢-氘平衡。

5. 看起来不同键类型的活化能可能不同，芳香环的活化能低于烯烃或烷基碳氢键。

6. 尽管不同催化剂的绝对活化能存在差异，但每个系统中活化能的比例似乎保持不变。

7. 苯对氢-氘平衡的毒害表明，这些反应涉及的催化位点可能不同于烯烃异构化，这暗示可能存在不同的催化机制。
