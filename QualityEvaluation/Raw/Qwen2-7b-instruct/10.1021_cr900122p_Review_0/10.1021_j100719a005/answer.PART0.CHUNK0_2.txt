[1] "Some of the finer details of the interaction of benzene with the surface of an alumina catalyst have been in- vestigated with the use o f deuterium tracers. Exchange of benzene H atoms with DZ occurred readily at room temperature, but intermolecular redistribution of H and D atoms between CeHe and CeDe occurred at least 10-20 times as rapidly under the same conditions."
[2] "Both reactions apparently took place on the same sites whose concentration was 6-15 x 1012 sites/cm2 as determined by COZ poisoning."
[3] "The exchange reaction with D z exhibited a primary kinetic isotope effect by being faster than CeDe-Hz exchange; the kCH/kcD = 2 was attributed to a dissociative exchange mechanism in which CH (or CD) cleavage wa3 rate limiting."
[4] "Benzene also poisoned the Hz-D2 equilibration."
[5] "The exchange activity remained poisoned, however,until 50-60% of the adsorbed CI4O2 from the first pulse was desorbed at 222"."
[6] "It appears that rather than hav- ing the same activation energies, each bond type may have its own unique activation energy with that for aromatic ring being lower than those for olefinic or for paraffinic C-H bonds."
[7] "Perhaps the most surprising result was the absence of significant poisoning with NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs."
[8] "The poisoning experiments have supplied consider- able information about the concentration and chemical nature of the active sites, Perhaps the most surprising result was the absence of significant poisoning with NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs."
[9] "An affirmative answer to this last uncertainty would clearly indicate that a chemical interaction had occurred between am- monia and the alumina surface, but this interaction (if it did occur) did not affect the exchange rate."
[10] "Further evidence comes from the radioactive poisoning experi- ments. Whereas the catalyst could adsorb at least 30% more COz than was necessary to poison the ex- change reaction, the exchange activity did not recom- mence until the temperature was increased (between 96 and 222" in Figure 4) to the point where 12-60% of the first C1402 dose was desorbed."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, specifically alumina, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The interaction of benzene with the alumina surface involves a dissociative exchange mechanism, where the initial interaction likely involves the attraction of the π system in the molecule to the metal center. This process allows for the cleavage of the C-H bond, enabling the subsequent redistribution of hydrogen and deuterium atoms between molecules. The concentration of these active sites is estimated to be around 6-15 x 1012 sites/cm2. The poisoning experiments reveal that certain compounds like NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs do not significantly poison the catalyst, suggesting that the active sites might not be the same ones involved in reactions like isomerization in olefins. The absence of poisoning by ammonia indicates a chemical interaction with the alumina surface, yet this does not affect the exchange rate. The data suggest that aromatic and olefinic C-H bonds are more easily activated than paraffinic C-H bonds, pointing to differences in the activation energy for different types of C-H bonds. The poisoning experiments further elucidate the concentration of the active sites, with estimates ranging from 6-8 x 1012 sites/cm2.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen和H解离机制在均相催化中促进C-H键活化。苯与氧化铝表面的相互作用涉及一个解离交换机制，其中初始相互作用可能涉及分子中的π系统对金属中心的吸引。这一过程允许C-H键的断裂，进而使氢和重氢原子在分子间进行重新分配。这些活性位点的浓度估计约为6-15 x 1012个/cm2。中毒实验表明，某些化合物如NO、CO、HzO、0 2 和NHs不会显著中毒催化剂，这表明活性位点可能不是参与烯烃异构化等反应的相同位点。氨的存在缺乏对催化剂的中毒现象表明，它与氧化铝表面之间存在化学作用，但这种作用不影响交换速率。数据表明，芳香族和烯族C-H键比饱和C-H键更容易激活，指出不同类型C-H键的活化能可能存在差异。中毒实验进一步阐明了活性位点的浓度，估计范围从6-8 x 1012个/cm2。
