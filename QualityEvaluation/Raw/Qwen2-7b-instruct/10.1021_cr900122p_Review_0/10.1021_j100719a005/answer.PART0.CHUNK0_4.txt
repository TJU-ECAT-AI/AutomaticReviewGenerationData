[1] "Some of the finer details of the interaction of benzene with the surface of an alumina catalyst have been in- vestigated with the use o f deuterium tracers."
[2] "Exchange of benzene H atoms with DZ occurred readily at room temperature, but intermolecular redistribution of H and D atoms between CeHe and CeDe occurred at least 10-20 times as rapidly under the same conditions."
[3] "Both reactions apparently took place on the same sites whose concentration was 6-15 x 1012 sites/cm2 as determined by COZ poisoning."
[4] "Several other compounds (NO, CO, 02, HzO, and 3) had little poisoning effect on the exchange reaction."
[5] "The exchange reaction with D z exhibited a primary kinetic isotope effect by being faster than CeDe-Hz exchange; the kCH/kcD = 2 was attributed to a dissociative exchange mechanism in which CH (or CD) cleavage wa3 rate limiting."
[6] "Benzene also poisoned the Hz-D2 equilibration."
[7] "The density of active sites was determined for these reactions by selective poisoning techniques."
[8] "Perhaps the most surprising result was the absence of significant poisoning with NO, CO, HzO, 0 2 ,  and NHs."
[9] "An affirmative answer to this last uncertainty would clearly indicate that a chemical interaction had occurred between am- monia and the alumina surface, but this interaction (if it did occur) did not affect the exchange rate."
[10] "On the basis of these findings, we believe the true site density is prob- ably about 8 X 1012/cm2."

These studies investigated the interaction of benzene with the surface of an alumina catalyst using deuterium tracers. The exchange of benzene hydrogen atoms with deuterium occurred readily at room temperature, while intermolecular redistribution of hydrogen and deuterium atoms between benzene and deuterated benzene happened at least 10-20 times faster under the same conditions. Both reactions occurred on the same sites, estimated to be around 6-15 x 1012 sites/cm2. Other compounds like nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, oxygen, water, and ammonia had little effect on the exchange reaction. The exchange reaction with deuterium displayed a kinetic isotope effect, being faster than hydrogen exchange, attributed to a dissociative mechanism where CH or CD cleavage was the rate-limiting step. Benzene also affected the hydrogen-deuterium equilibrium. The density of active sites for these reactions was determined through selective poisoning techniques. Surprisingly, ammonia had no significant impact on the exchange rate. Based on these findings, the researchers estimated the true site density to be around 8 x 1012/cm2.

这些研究使用脱uterium示踪剂来探究苯与氧化铝催化剂表面的相互作用。室温下，苯的氢原子与deuterium的交换发生得很容易，而苯和去氢化苯之间氢和deuterium原子的分子内重分布速度至少比交换反应快10到20倍。这两种反应似乎在相同位置进行，估计这些位置的数量级为每平方厘米6到15乘以10的12次方个。其他化合物如氮氧化物、一氧化碳、氧气、水和氨对交换反应影响较小。与deuterium的交换反应表现出初级的同位素效应，其速率比氢交换快，归因于一个分解机制，在该机制中，CH或CD的断裂是速率决定步骤。苯还会影响氢-德uterium平衡。通过选择性中毒技术确定了这些反应中的活性位点密度。令人惊讶的是，氨对交换速率没有显著影响。根据这些发现，研究人员估计真正的位点密度约为每平方厘米8乘以10的12次方个。
