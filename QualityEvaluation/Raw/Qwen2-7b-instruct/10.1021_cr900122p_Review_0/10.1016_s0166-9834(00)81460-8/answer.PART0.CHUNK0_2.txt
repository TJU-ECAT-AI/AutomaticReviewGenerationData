When evacuated at 600C, alumina was found to be most active followed by magnesia while silica and titanium oxide were totally inactive at any temperatures up to 600C.

Alumina did not show any activity until it was evacuated at temperatures higher than 400C. Once it was evacuated at 600C for 2 hr, the equilibration reaction readily occurred even at room temperature as reported by Larson and Hall.

The lowest evacuation temperature required for the equilibration reaction on magnesia was about 450C. The activity of magnesia maximized when the catalyst was evacuated at 600C. When evacuated at 600C, magnesia catalyzed the equilibration reaction above 250C, but the activity was one order of magnitude lower than that of alumina at 400C.

Comparing these results with Fig. 3, it is obvious that the carbon dioxide which poisons the equilibration reaction is that which adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 280°C.

The exchange reaction between CD4 and the surface OH groups was examined with alumina and magnesia. On alumina, no exchange of the OH groups to OD was observed in 15 min up to 250°C even after alumina was evacuated at 700°C. The exchange reaction started to occur at 300°C and all OH groups were converted to OD at 550°C.

When magnesia was heated at increasing temperatures, two major bands due to hydroxyl groups appeared, a sharp band at 3740 cm−1 and a broad one at about 3580 cm−1, in general agreement with previous authors. The broad band shifted to 3610 cm−1 and was removed more readily as the evacuation temperature was increased, and very little remained at 500°C.

On alumina, if the hydroxyl groups are involved in the equilibration reaction, those which give the highest frequency IR bands (3800-3780 cm−1) might be a likely candidate since they were exchanged with CD4 most easily. However, the population of these hydroxyl groups is about 6 x 1012/cm2 estimated from the total number of OH groups of Alon alumina evacuated at 600°C, almost 30 times larger than the number of active sites (2.2 x 1011/cm2) found in the present study.

No exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed in 15 min below 250°C while the CD4-CH4 reaction readily proceeded at those low temperatures as already pointed out.

1. Alumina showed activity only after being evacuated at temperatures higher than 400°C, becoming most active when evacuated at 600°C for 2 hours, even at room temperature. Magnesia required an evacuation temperature of about 450°C for activity, peaking at 600°C, with activity one order of magnitude lower than alumina at 400°C.

2. The carbon dioxide that poisons the equilibration reaction on alumina adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 280°C.

3. Exchange of hydroxyl groups occurred at temperatures above 300°C on alumina, converting all OH groups to OD at 550°C. Below 250°C, no exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed, even though the CD4-CH4 reaction proceeded readily at these low temperatures.

4. The hydroxyl groups giving the highest frequency IR bands (3800-3780 cm−1) on alumina might be involved in the equilibration reaction, but their population is about 30 times larger than the number of active sites (2.2 x 1011/cm2) found in the present study.

5. No exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed in 15 minutes below 250°C, despite the rapid CD4-CH4 reaction at these low temperatures.

1. 在温度高于400°C时，氧化铝才显示出活性，在600°C下被抽真空2小时后，即使在室温下也能迅速反应。镁基催化剂需要约450°C的抽真空温度才能激活，而在600°C时达到最高活性，其活性比400°C下氧化铝的活性低一个数量级。

2. 在氧化铝上，吸附最强烈的二氧化碳在280°C时给出TPD峰，这是毒化等离子反应的原因。

3. 在300°C以上的温度下，氧化铝上的羟基发生交换，所有羟基在550°C时全部转化为OD。在250°C以下，没有观察到羟基的交换，尽管在这些低温下CD4-CH4反应进行了快速反应。

4. 给出最高频率IR波（3800-3780 cm−1）的羟基组分可能参与等离子反应，但它们的数量是现在研究中发现的活性位点（2.2 x 1011/cm2）的30倍大。

5. 在250°C以下，没有观察到15分钟内的羟基交换，尽管在这些低温下CD4-CH4反应进行得很快。
