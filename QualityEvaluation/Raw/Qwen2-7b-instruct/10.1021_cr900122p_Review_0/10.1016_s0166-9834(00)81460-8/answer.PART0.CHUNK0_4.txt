[1] "When evacuated at 600C. alumina was found to be most active followed by magnesia while silica and titanium oxide were totally inactive at any temperatures up to 600C."
[2] "The first order rate constant, k, is listed in Table 1 together with results obtained with other oxides."
[3] "Silica and titanium oxide were inactive at all temperatures used in the present study even after they were evacuated at 600C or 700C as shown in Table 1."
[4] "Comparing these results with Fig. 3,it is obvious that the carbon dioxide which poisons the equilibration reaction is that which adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 28O'C."
[5] "On alumina, no exchange of the OH groups to 00 was observed in 15 min up to 250C even after alumina was evacuated at 700C as shown in Fig. 5."
[6] "This suggests that the hydroxyl groups are not involved in the CD,-CH, reaction at these low temperatures."
[7] "The C-H bond has to be broken in order for methane to exchange its hydrogen."
[8] "If the hydroxyl groups are involved in the equilibration reaction, those which give the highest frequency ir bands (3800-3780 cm-l) might be a likely candidate since they were exchanged with CD, most easily as pointed out in the previous section."
[9] "Moreover, no exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed in 15 min below 25O'C while the CD,-CH, reaction readily proceeded at those low temperatures as already pointed out."
[10] "The present results suggest that the equilibration reacticn of methane on alumina involves no hydroxyl groups of the catalyst or that the number of hydroxyl groups associated with the active sites is extremely small."
[11] "Unfortunately,the present infrared spectroscopy cannot detect such a small amount of exchange so that direct proof from the study of the surface is not possible."

1. At temperatures above 600°C, alumina showed the highest activity in the hydrogen exchange reaction between CD4 and CH4, followed by magnesia. Silica and titanium oxide were inactive at all temperatures up to 600°C.
2. The first order rate constant, k, for the hydrogen exchange reaction between CD4 and the surface OH groups was one order of magnitude smaller than the estimate based on poisoning experiments.
3. Hydroxyl groups on silica and titanium oxide were not involved in the CD4-CH4 exchange reaction at any of the temperatures tested.
4. Carbon dioxide that adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 280°C is responsible for poisoning the hydrogen exchange reaction.
5. No exchange of hydroxyl groups occurred on alumina at temperatures up to 250°C, even after evacuating at 700°C.
6. At low temperatures, the hydroxyl groups are not involved in the CD4-CH4 exchange reaction.
7. Methane's C-H bond needs to be broken for hydrogen exchange to occur.
8. The hydroxyl groups with the highest frequency infrared bands (3800-3780 cm⁻¹) might be a suitable candidate for exchange if they are involved in the equilibration reaction.
9. No hydroxyl group exchange was observed at temperatures below 250°C, despite the rapid CD4-CH4 reaction at those temperatures.
10. The current findings indicate that hydroxyl groups are not involved in the methane equilibration reaction on alumina, or that the number of hydroxyl groups associated with active sites is very small.
11. Direct evidence from surface studies cannot confirm the small amount of hydroxyl group exchange due to the limitations of infrared spectroscopy.

1. 在600°C以上的温度下，氧化铝在CD4和CH4之间的氢交换反应中表现出最高的活性，随后是镁。二氧化硅和钛氧化物在所有温度下至600°C都完全无活性。
2. 基于中毒实验估计的表面羟基密度，氢交换反应CD4和表面OH组之间的第一级速率常数k比从CO2吸附实验得到的结果低一个数量级。
3. 二氧化硅和钛氧化物在测试的所有温度下对CD4-CH4交换反应没有活性，即使在600°C或700°C下预抽真空也是如此。
4. 产生280°C下TD谱峰的CO2是导致氢交换反应中毒的主要原因。
5. 即使在700°C下预抽真空，也未在250°C及以下温度上观察到氧化铝上的羟基交换。
6. 在低温下，羟基组分不参与CD4-CH4交换反应。
7. 为了氢交换发生，甲烷的C-H键必须断裂。
8. 具有最高频率红外光谱带（3800-3780 cm⁻¹）的羟基组分可能是参与平衡反应的候选对象，如果它们确实参与其中的话。
9. 未在250°C以下观察到羟基组分交换，尽管在这些低温下CD4-CH4反应迅速进行。
10. 当前的结果表明，羟基组分可能不参与甲烷在氧化铝上的平衡反应，或者与活性位点关联的羟基组分的数量非常小。
11. 由于红外光谱技术的限制，无法直接通过表面研究确认少量羟基组分交换的存在。
