[2] "The catalytic exchange of hydrogen between methane molecules, between methane and hydrogen and between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalyst has been studied on various oxide catalysts by several investigators Cl-31."
[3] "The C-H bond has to be broken in order for methane to exchange its hydrogen."
[4] "As proposed by Larson and Hall [l], methane will dissociatively adsorb on a pair of sites consisting of exposed aluminum and @- ions (dual acid-base sites) to form Al-CH, and OH groups."
[5] "The exchange of surface hydroxyl groups was also studied and the involvement of the surface hydroxyl groups in the CD,-CH,exchange reaction was discussed."
[6] "However, this mechanism is unlikely since it requires a second order reaction with respect to methane."
[7] "A similar argument may be made for magnesia."
[8] "The number of active sites on magnesia is also small, 7.3 x 1012 sites/es,and the rate of the exchange of hydroxyl groups seems too slow for the full involvement in the equilibration reaction as described earlier."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, for example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion is not provided in the document. The exchange of hydrogen between methane molecules, methane and hydrogen, and methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts has been studied on various oxide catalysts. The exchange reaction between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups is also discussed. The exchange reaction is unlikely to occur through a direct exchange between CD and OH groups due to the requirement of a second-order reaction with respect to methane. For magnesia, the number of active sites is small, and the rate of the exchange of hydroxyl groups is too slow for full involvement in the equilibration reaction. Sulfate ions poison the active sites more selectively than potassium ions on alumina, possibly due to differences in their interactions with the catalyst surface.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象等机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。这些原理应用于工业中烷烃的选择性氧化，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。但是，丁烷到马来酸酐转换的具体例子未在文档中提供。已经研究了甲烷与各种氧化物催化剂之间的氢交换、甲烷分子之间以及甲烷和催化剂表面羟基团之间的氢交换。还讨论了甲烷与表面羟基团之间的交换反应。氢交换不大可能通过CD和OH组间的直接交换发生，因为这需要甲烷的二级反应。对于镁，活性位点的数量很小，并且羟基的交换速率太慢，无法充分参与平衡反应。硫酸根离子比铝酸盐中的钾离子更选择性地毒害活性位点，可能是因为它们与催化剂表面的相互作用存在差异。
