The C-H bond has to be broken in order for methane to exchange its hydrogen. As proposed by Larson and Hall [l], methane will dissociatively adsorb on a pair of sites consisting of exposed aluminum and @- ions (dual acid-base sites) to form Al-CH, and OH groups. They preferred a group of sites where the nearest neighbors of an isolated OH group are all aluminum ions. Such OH groups give the lowest frequency infrared band at 3700 cm-1 [IO]. When CO, adsorbs on those sites, CD, is attached to an aluminum ion together with 00 and OH groups implying that all exchange reactions involve the hydroxyl groups of alumina.

The C-H bond in methane is broken by dissociative adsorption onto dual acid-base sites consisting of exposed aluminum and $\alpha-$ ions. These sites are favored for their ability to form Al-CH, and OH groups. Specifically, isolated OH groups with aluminum ions as their nearest neighbors facilitate the exchange reactions involving methane. CO, adsorption on these sites leads to the attachment of CD, along with $0_0$ and OH groups, indicating that all exchange reactions involve the hydroxyl groups of alumina.

甲烷的C-H键通过离解吸附至由暴露的铝和$\alpha-$离子组成的双酸碱位点而断裂。这些位点倾向于形成Al-CH, 和OH基团。特别是，具有铝离子作为其邻近原子的孤立OH基团有助于涉及甲烷的交换反应。CO,在这些位点上的吸附导致CD,与$0_0$和OH基团结合在一起，这表明所有交换反应都涉及到氧化铝中的羟基基团。

On the other hand, Flockhart et al. [4] observed that the C,H,-D, exchange reaction took place readily at room temperature on alumina while the exchange between C,D, and the hydroxyl groups were negligible under the same conditions. From these results, they concluded that the hydroxyl groups of alumina were not involved directly in the propane-D2 exchange reaction.

Contrarily, Flockhart et al. [4] noted that the CH, - D, exchange reaction occurred easily at room temperature on alumina, whereas the exchange between CD, and the hydroxyl groups was insignificant under the same conditions. Based on these findings, they deduced that the hydroxyl groups of alumina did not directly participate in the propane-D2 exchange reaction.

相反，Flockhart等人的研究显示，在室温下，CH, - D,交换反应在氧化铝上进行得相当顺利，而CD,与羟基之间的交换则微乎其微。基于这些结果，他们得出结论，氧化铝中的羟基基团并未直接参与丙烷-D2交换反应。

The equilibration reaction without the participation of the catalyst hydroxyl groups is possible, for example by the exchange of hydrogen between two methane molecules dissociatively adsorbed on the neighboring Al-0 pairs. However, this mechanism is unlikely since it requires a second order reaction with respect to methane.

The equilibration reaction can proceed without the involvement of catalyst hydroxyl groups, for instance, through hydrogen exchange between two methane molecules that are dissociatively adsorbed on adjacent Al-O pairs. However, this pathway is improbable because it necessitates a second-order reaction with respect to methane.

没有催化剂羟基的参与，平衡反应也是可能的，例如，通过两个在相邻Al-O对上离解吸附的甲烷分子之间的氢交换。然而，这种方法不太可能，因为它需要甲烷的二次反应。
