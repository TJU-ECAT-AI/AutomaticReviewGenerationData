The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, for example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion is not provided in the document. The exchange of hydrogen between methane molecules, methane and hydrogen, and methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts has been studied on various oxide catalysts. The exchange reaction between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups is also discussed. The exchange reaction is unlikely to occur through a direct exchange between CD and OH groups due to the requirement of a second-order reaction with respect to methane. For magnesia, the number of active sites is small, and the rate of the exchange of hydroxyl groups is too slow for full involvement in the equilibration reaction. Sulfate ions poison the active sites more selectively than potassium ions on alumina, possibly due to differences in their interactions with the catalyst surface.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象等机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。这些原理应用于工业中烷烃的选择性氧化，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。但是，丁烷到马来酸酐转换的具体例子未在文档中提供。已经研究了甲烷与各种氧化物催化剂之间的氢交换、甲烷分子之间以及甲烷和催化剂表面羟基团之间的氢交换。还讨论了甲烷与表面羟基团之间的交换反应。氢交换不大可能通过CD和OH组间的直接交换发生，因为这需要甲烷的二级反应。对于镁，活性位点的数量很小，并且羟基的交换速率太慢，无法充分参与平衡反应。硫酸根离子比铝酸盐中的钾离子更选择性地毒害活性位点，可能是因为它们与催化剂表面的相互作用存在差异。

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, particularly aluminum and oxygen ions, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, involving the abstraction of hydrogen by a metal center, plays a key role. In the context of industrial applications, such as the selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles enable efficient conversion. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride employs these catalytic properties. The hydrogen exchange reaction between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups on alumina catalysts demonstrates the involvement of metal sites and the importance of hydrogen abstraction in these processes. However, the study reveals that the exchange reaction on alumina does not involve hydroxyl groups of the catalyst, suggesting that the number of hydroxyl groups associated with active sites is significantly lower than initially estimated.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中，特别是铝和氧离子，促进了异相催化中的C-H键活化。Mars van Krevelen机制，涉及金属中心对氢的抽象，起着关键作用。在工业应用中，如烷烃的选择性氧化，这些原理使过程高效。例如，将丁烷转化为马来酸酐就利用了这些催化特性。甲烷与氧化铝催化剂表面羟基团之间的氢交换反应表明了金属位点的作用以及氢抽象在这些过程中的重要性。然而，研究表明，铝上甲烷交换反应不涉及催化剂的羟基团，这暗示与活性位点相关的羟基团数量远低于最初估计的数量。

When evacuated at 600C, alumina was found to be most active followed by magnesia while silica and titanium oxide were totally inactive at any temperatures up to 600C.

Alumina did not show any activity until it was evacuated at temperatures higher than 400C. Once it was evacuated at 600C for 2 hr, the equilibration reaction readily occurred even at room temperature as reported by Larson and Hall.

The lowest evacuation temperature required for the equilibration reaction on magnesia was about 450C. The activity of magnesia maximized when the catalyst was evacuated at 600C. When evacuated at 600C, magnesia catalyzed the equilibration reaction above 250C, but the activity was one order of magnitude lower than that of alumina at 400C.

Comparing these results with Fig. 3, it is obvious that the carbon dioxide which poisons the equilibration reaction is that which adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 280°C.

The exchange reaction between CD4 and the surface OH groups was examined with alumina and magnesia. On alumina, no exchange of the OH groups to OD was observed in 15 min up to 250°C even after alumina was evacuated at 700°C. The exchange reaction started to occur at 300°C and all OH groups were converted to OD at 550°C.

When magnesia was heated at increasing temperatures, two major bands due to hydroxyl groups appeared, a sharp band at 3740 cm−1 and a broad one at about 3580 cm−1, in general agreement with previous authors. The broad band shifted to 3610 cm−1 and was removed more readily as the evacuation temperature was increased, and very little remained at 500°C.

On alumina, if the hydroxyl groups are involved in the equilibration reaction, those which give the highest frequency IR bands (3800-3780 cm−1) might be a likely candidate since they were exchanged with CD4 most easily. However, the population of these hydroxyl groups is about 6 x 1012/cm2 estimated from the total number of OH groups of Alon alumina evacuated at 600°C, almost 30 times larger than the number of active sites (2.2 x 1011/cm2) found in the present study.

No exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed in 15 min below 250°C while the CD4-CH4 reaction readily proceeded at those low temperatures as already pointed out.

1. Alumina showed activity only after being evacuated at temperatures higher than 400°C, becoming most active when evacuated at 600°C for 2 hours, even at room temperature. Magnesia required an evacuation temperature of about 450°C for activity, peaking at 600°C, with activity one order of magnitude lower than alumina at 400°C.

2. The carbon dioxide that poisons the equilibration reaction on alumina adsorbs most strongly and gives the TPD peak at 280°C.

3. Exchange of hydroxyl groups occurred at temperatures above 300°C on alumina, converting all OH groups to OD at 550°C. Below 250°C, no exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed, even though the CD4-CH4 reaction proceeded readily at these low temperatures.

4. The hydroxyl groups giving the highest frequency IR bands (3800-3780 cm−1) on alumina might be involved in the equilibration reaction, but their population is about 30 times larger than the number of active sites (2.2 x 1011/cm2) found in the present study.

5. No exchange of hydroxyl groups was observed in 15 minutes below 250°C, despite the rapid CD4-CH4 reaction at these low temperatures.

1. 在温度高于400°C时，氧化铝才显示出活性，在600°C下被抽真空2小时后，即使在室温下也能迅速反应。镁基催化剂需要约450°C的抽真空温度才能激活，而在600°C时达到最高活性，其活性比400°C下氧化铝的活性低一个数量级。

2. 在氧化铝上，吸附最强烈的二氧化碳在280°C时给出TPD峰，这是毒化等离子反应的原因。

3. 在300°C以上的温度下，氧化铝上的羟基发生交换，所有羟基在550°C时全部转化为OD。在250°C以下，没有观察到羟基的交换，尽管在这些低温下CD4-CH4反应进行了快速反应。

4. 给出最高频率IR波（3800-3780 cm−1）的羟基组分可能参与等离子反应，但它们的数量是现在研究中发现的活性位点（2.2 x 1011/cm2）的30倍大。

5. 在250°C以下，没有观察到15分钟内的羟基交换，尽管在这些低温下CD4-CH4反应进行得很快。

The C-H bond has to be broken in order for methane to exchange its hydrogen. As proposed by Larson and Hall [l], methane will dissociatively adsorb on a pair of sites consisting of exposed aluminum and @- ions (dual acid-base sites) to form Al-CH, and OH groups. They preferred a group of sites where the nearest neighbors of an isolated OH group are all aluminum ions. Such OH groups give the lowest frequency infrared band at 3700 cm-1 [IO]. When CO, adsorbs on those sites, CD, is attached to an aluminum ion together with 00 and OH groups implying that all exchange reactions involve the hydroxyl groups of alumina.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The C-H bond in methane is broken by dissociative adsorption onto dual acid-base sites consisting of exposed aluminum and $\alpha-$ ions. These sites are favored for their ability to form Al-CH, and OH groups. Specifically, isolated OH groups with aluminum ions as their nearest neighbors facilitate the exchange reactions involving methane. CO, adsorption on these sites leads to the attachment of CD, along with $0_0$ and OH groups, indicating that all exchange reactions involve the hydroxyl groups of alumina.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
甲烷的C-H键通过离解吸附至由暴露的铝和$\alpha-$离子组成的双酸碱位点而断裂。这些位点倾向于形成Al-CH, 和OH基团。特别是，具有铝离子作为其邻近原子的孤立OH基团有助于涉及甲烷的交换反应。CO,在这些位点上的吸附导致CD,与$0_0$和OH基团结合在一起，这表明所有交换反应都涉及到氧化铝中的羟基基团。

On the other hand, Flockhart et al. [4] observed that the C,H,-D, exchange reaction took place readily at room temperature on alumina while the exchange between C,D, and the hydroxyl groups were negligible under the same conditions. From these results, they concluded that the hydroxyl groups of alumina were not involved directly in the propane-D2 exchange reaction.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Contrarily, Flockhart et al. [4] noted that the CH, - D, exchange reaction occurred easily at room temperature on alumina, whereas the exchange between CD, and the hydroxyl groups was insignificant under the same conditions. Based on these findings, they deduced that the hydroxyl groups of alumina did not directly participate in the propane-D2 exchange reaction.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
相反，Flockhart等人的研究显示，在室温下，CH, - D,交换反应在氧化铝上进行得相当顺利，而CD,与羟基之间的交换则微乎其微。基于这些结果，他们得出结论，氧化铝中的羟基基团并未直接参与丙烷-D2交换反应。

The equilibration reaction without the participation of the catalyst hydroxyl groups is possible, for example by the exchange of hydrogen between two methane molecules dissociatively adsorbed on the neighboring Al-0 pairs. However, this mechanism is unlikely since it requires a second order reaction with respect to methane.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The equilibration reaction can proceed without the involvement of catalyst hydroxyl groups, for instance, through hydrogen exchange between two methane molecules that are dissociatively adsorbed on adjacent Al-O pairs. However, this pathway is improbable because it necessitates a second-order reaction with respect to methane.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
没有催化剂羟基的参与，平衡反应也是可能的，例如，通过两个在相邻Al-O对上离解吸附的甲烷分子之间的氢交换。然而，这种方法不太可能，因为它需要甲烷的二次反应。
