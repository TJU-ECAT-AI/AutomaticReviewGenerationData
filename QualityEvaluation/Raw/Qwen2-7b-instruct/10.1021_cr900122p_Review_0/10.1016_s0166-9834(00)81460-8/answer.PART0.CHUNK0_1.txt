[1] "The C-H bond has to be broken in order for methane to exchange its hydrogen."
[2] "As proposed by Larson and Hall [l], methane will dissociatively adsorb on a pair of sites consisting of exposed aluminum and @- ions (dual acid-base sites) to form Al-CH, and OH groups."
[3] "The equilibration reaction of methane on alumina involves no hydroxyl groups of the catalyst or that the number of hydroxyl groups associated with the active sites is extremely small."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, particularly aluminum and oxygen ions, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, involving the abstraction of hydrogen by a metal center, plays a key role. In the context of industrial applications, such as the selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles enable efficient conversion. For instance, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride employs these catalytic properties. The hydrogen exchange reaction between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups on alumina catalysts demonstrates the involvement of metal sites and the importance of hydrogen abstraction in these processes. However, the study reveals that the exchange reaction on alumina does not involve hydroxyl groups of the catalyst, suggesting that the number of hydroxyl groups associated with active sites is significantly lower than initially estimated.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中，特别是铝和氧离子，促进了异相催化中的C-H键活化。Mars van Krevelen机制，涉及金属中心对氢的抽象，起着关键作用。在工业应用中，如烷烃的选择性氧化，这些原理使过程高效。例如，将丁烷转化为马来酸酐就利用了这些催化特性。甲烷与氧化铝催化剂表面羟基团之间的氢交换反应表明了金属位点的作用以及氢抽象在这些过程中的重要性。然而，研究表明，铝上甲烷交换反应不涉及催化剂的羟基团，这暗示与活性位点相关的羟基团数量远低于最初估计的数量。
