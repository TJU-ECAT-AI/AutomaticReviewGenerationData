The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation processes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The nanotechnology implications of the work include the construction of controllable zero-, one-, and two-dimensional nanostructures in electronically conducting polymers. The transition of dimensionality in nanostructures suggests potential for on-off switching. P4VP, a semiconducting conjugated polymer, shares chemical similarities with other main-chain conjugated polymers, which are inherently difficult to process due to rigidity. However, methods exist to introduce processibility, such as the use of amphiphilic dopants or amphiphilic oligomers capable of molecular recognition with the polymer chains.

孤立的金属中心在氧化材料上通过Mars van Krevelen和H抽象等机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。这些原理在工业上应用于选择性氧化过程，包括丁烷转化为马来酸酐。这项工作的纳米技术含义包括在电子导电聚合物中构建可控的零维、一维和二维纳米结构。纳米结构维度的变化预示着可能的开/关切换。P4VP，一种半导体共轭聚合物，与其它主链共轭聚合物（如聚苯胺、聚吡啶、聚吡啶乙烯）在化学上有很多相似之处。由于其刚性，这些材料在加工上固有困难。然而，存在引入可加工性的方法，例如使用两亲性掺杂剂或能够与聚合物链识别的两亲性寡聚体。
