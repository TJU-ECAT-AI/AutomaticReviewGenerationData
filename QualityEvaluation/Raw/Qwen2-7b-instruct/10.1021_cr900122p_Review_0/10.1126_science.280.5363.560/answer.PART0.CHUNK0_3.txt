[4] "In this case, conductivity appears to proceed through a protonic mechanism (19); this mechanism is not a serious limitation to the generality of the concepts, which are based on a control of the morphology."
[5] "Chemically, P4VP resembles in several ways main-chain conjugated polymers such as polyaniline,poly(p-pyridine), poly(p-pyridine vinylene) (20, 21), and possibly even polypyrrole."
[6] "These materials are inherently difficult to process because of their rigidity."
[7] "However, in polyaniline, for example, methods have been demonstrated to introduce processibility by the use of amphiphilic dopants (22) or amphiphilic oligomers capable of molecular recognition with the polyaniline chain (23)."

1. The implications of the current research on nanotechnology appear multifaceted, suggesting a wide range of applications and advancements in nanotechnology.
2. The techniques used to create zero-, one-, and two-dimensional nanostructures indicate controllable nanostructures within conjugated electronically conducting polymers.
3. P4VP is a semiconducting side-chain conjugated polymer.
4. Conductivity in this context seems to occur via a protonic mechanism, which does not restrict the general applicability of the concepts, focusing on controlling the structure's morphology.
5. P4VP shares chemical similarities with other main-chain conjugated polymers like polyaniline, poly(p-pyridine), poly(p-pyridine vinylene), and potentially polypyrrole.
6. These materials are inherently challenging to process due to their rigidity.
7. In contrast, methods have been developed for materials like polyaniline to introduce processability through the use of amphiphilic dopants or amphiphilic oligomers capable of molecular recognition with the polyaniline chain.
