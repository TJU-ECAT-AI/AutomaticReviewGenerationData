How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

[1] "All the exchange reactions took place in a stepwise manner and, for the cycloalkanes, exchange could be followed at lower temperatures without complication from isomerization and addition."
[2] "An improved method involving combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (g.c.-m.s.) has now been used and permits examination of the exchange of a series of reactants simultaneously."
[3] "Using g.c.-m.s. the processes of addition, exchange and isomerization may be followed simultaneously."
[4] "Information concerning reaction intermediates has been obtained not only from relative rates of exchange of the various reactants, but also from the reactivities of different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule."
[5] "In previous work only one hydrocarbon has been investigated in any one experiment. An improved method involving combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (g.c.-m.s.) has now been used and permits examination of the exchange of a series of reactants simultaneously."
[6] "In experiments involving more than one reactant hydrocarbon or in those in which a single reactant could exhibit different reactions, the standard mass spectrometric method proved inadequate. In such cases the combined g.c.-m.s. apparatus linked to an "on-line" computer was employed."

This study investigates the exchange behavior of a series of alkanes, including cycloalkanes, with deuterium over γ-alumina. The researchers found that different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule exchange at different rates. They compared reaction rates of different molecules, indicating that the reaction intermediates are carbanionic in nature. A linear relationship between hydrogen exchange activity and hydrocarbon acidity was obtained, demonstrating an example of the Brnsted catalysis law. The exchange reactions took place in a stepwise manner, allowing for the examination of the exchange of a series of reactants simultaneously through the use of combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (g.c.-m.s.). This method enabled the observation of the processes of addition, exchange, and isomerization occurring concurrently.

这项研究探讨了一系列烷烃（包括环烷烃）与氘在γ氧化铝上的交换行为。研究人员发现，同一分子内的不同氢原子交换速率不同。他们比较了不同分子的反应速率，表明反应中间体具有碳负离子的性质。获得了一种氢交换活性与碳氢化合物酸性之间的线性关系，这是布恩斯泰德催化作用定律的一个例子。交换反应以步骤方式进行，通过结合气相色谱-质谱法（g.c.-m.s.），可以同时对一系列反应物进行观察。这种方法使观察到添加、交换和异构化过程同时发生成为可能。

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, for instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The reactivities of different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule provide insights into the nature of reaction intermediates, which are often found to possess carbanionic character. A linear relationship between hydrogen exchange activity and hydrocarbon acidity exemplifies the Brsnsted catalysis law.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料上通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象等机制促进了C-H键的活化，这在异相催化中起着关键作用。这些原则在工业选择性氧化烷烃中得到了应用，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。同分子内不同类型的氢原子的反应性提供了反应中间体性质的见解，这些中间体通常具有碳负离子特性。氢交换活性与碳氢化合物酸度之间的线性关系是Brsnsted催化作用定律的一个例子。

The exchange of butanes over y-alumina is believed to form carbanionic intermediates. The use of combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (g.c.-m.s.) allows for the simultaneous examination of the exchange reactions of multiple alkanes, enabling observation of processes such as addition, exchange, and isomerization.
