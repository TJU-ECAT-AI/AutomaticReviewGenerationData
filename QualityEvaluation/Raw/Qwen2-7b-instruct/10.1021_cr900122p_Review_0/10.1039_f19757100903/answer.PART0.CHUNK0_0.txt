[1] "All the exchange reactions took place in a stepwise manner and, for the cycloalkanes, exchange could be followed at lower temperatures without complication from isomerization and addition."
[2] "An improved method involving combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (g.c.-m.s.) has now been used and permits examination of the exchange of a series of reactants simultaneously."
[3] "Using g.c.-m.s. the processes of addition, exchange and isomerization may be followed simultaneously."
[4] "Information concerning reaction intermediates has been obtained not only from relative rates of exchange of the various reactants, but also from the reactivities of different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule."
[5] "In previous work only one hydrocarbon has been investigated in any one experiment. An improved method involving combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (g.c.-m.s.) has now been used and permits examination of the exchange of a series of reactants simultaneously."
[6] "In experiments involving more than one reactant hydrocarbon or in those in which a single reactant could exhibit different reactions, the standard mass spectrometric method proved inadequate. In such cases the combined g.c.-m.s. apparatus linked to an "on-line" computer was employed."

This study investigates the exchange behavior of a series of alkanes, including cycloalkanes, with deuterium over γ-alumina. The researchers found that different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule exchange at different rates. They compared reaction rates of different molecules, indicating that the reaction intermediates are carbanionic in nature. A linear relationship between hydrogen exchange activity and hydrocarbon acidity was obtained, demonstrating an example of the Brnsted catalysis law. The exchange reactions took place in a stepwise manner, allowing for the examination of the exchange of a series of reactants simultaneously through the use of combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (g.c.-m.s.). This method enabled the observation of the processes of addition, exchange, and isomerization occurring concurrently.

这项研究探讨了一系列烷烃（包括环烷烃）与氘在γ氧化铝上的交换行为。研究人员发现，同一分子内的不同氢原子交换速率不同。他们比较了不同分子的反应速率，表明反应中间体具有碳负离子的性质。获得了一种氢交换活性与碳氢化合物酸性之间的线性关系，这是布恩斯泰德催化作用定律的一个例子。交换反应以步骤方式进行，通过结合气相色谱-质谱法（g.c.-m.s.），可以同时对一系列反应物进行观察。这种方法使观察到添加、交换和异构化过程同时发生成为可能。
