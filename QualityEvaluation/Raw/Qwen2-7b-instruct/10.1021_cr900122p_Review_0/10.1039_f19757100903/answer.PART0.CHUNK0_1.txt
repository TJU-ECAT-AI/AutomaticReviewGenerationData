[1] "Recent results suggest that the intermediates in the exchange of butanes over y-alumina possess carbanionic character."
[2] "A linear relation between hydrogen exchange activity and hydrocarbon acidity has been obtained and is shown to be an example of the Brsnsted catalysis law."
[3] "Information concerning reaction intermediates has been obtained not only from relative rates of exchange of the various reactants, but also from the reactivities of different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, for instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The reactivities of different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule provide insights into the nature of reaction intermediates, which are often found to possess carbanionic character. A linear relationship between hydrogen exchange activity and hydrocarbon acidity exemplifies the Brsnsted catalysis law.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料上通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象等机制促进了C-H键的活化，这在异相催化中起着关键作用。这些原则在工业选择性氧化烷烃中得到了应用，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。同分子内不同类型的氢原子的反应性提供了反应中间体性质的见解，这些中间体通常具有碳负离子特性。氢交换活性与碳氢化合物酸度之间的线性关系是Brsnsted催化作用定律的一个例子。
