The study focuses on the exchange behavior of a series of alkanes, including cycloalkanes, with deuterium over y-alumina. It indicates that the reaction intermediates are carbanionic in nature. A linear relationship between hydrogen exchange activity and hydrocarbon acidity is observed, demonstrating an example of the Brnsted catalysis law. Recent findings suggest that the intermediates in the exchange of butanes over y-alumina also exhibit carbanionic characteristics. An advanced method combining gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (g.c.-m.s.) enables the simultaneous examination of the exchange reactions of multiple alkanes, allowing for the observation of processes like addition, exchange, and isomerization.

研究集中在一系列烷烃，包括环烷烃，与氘在y沸石上的交换行为。它表明反应中间体具有碳离子性质。氢交换活性与碳氢化合物酸性之间的线性关系被观察到，展示了Brnsted催化作用法则的一个例子。最近的研究发现，丁烷在y沸石上的交换过程中的中间体也表现出碳离子特性。结合气相色谱-质谱法(g.c.-m.s.)的先进方法允许同时研究一系列反应物的交换反应，从而观察到添加、交换和异构化等过程。
