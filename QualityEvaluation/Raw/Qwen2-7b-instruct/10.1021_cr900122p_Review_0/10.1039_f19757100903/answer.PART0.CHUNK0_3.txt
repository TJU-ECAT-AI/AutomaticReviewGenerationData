[1] "Recent results suggest that the intermediates in the exchange of butanes over y-alumina possess carbanionic character."
[2] "An improved method involving combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (g.c.-m.s.) has now been used and permits examination of the exchange of a series of reactants simultaneously."
[3] "Using g.c.-m.s. the processes of addition, exchange and isomerization may be followed simultaneously."

The exchange of butanes over y-alumina is believed to form carbanionic intermediates. The use of combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (g.c.-m.s.) allows for the simultaneous examination of the exchange reactions of multiple alkanes, enabling observation of processes such as addition, exchange, and isomerization.
