[1] "A linear relation between hydrogen exchange activity and hydrocarbon acidity has been obtained and is shown to be an example of the Brsnsted catalysis law."
[2] "Information concerning reaction intermediates has been obtained not only from relative rates of exchange of the various reactants, but also from the reactivities of different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule."
