The unique catalytic properties of nanoparticles and the ability to control catalytic activity and selectivity by tuning their shape, size, and composition offer new opportunities in understanding molecular surface chemistry and in major chemical energy conversion technologies. This is achieved through the use of in situ, surface-sensitive techniques like sum frequency generation (SFG) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to monitor nanoparticles undergoing reactions. These methods allow researchers to detect reaction intermediates and products, providing insights into the mechanism of C-H bond activation facilitated by isolated metal centers on oxide materials. Mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction play crucial roles in these processes. For instance, in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, nanoparticles can enhance the reactivity of the metal center, enabling efficient activation of C-H bonds and subsequent formation of desired products. The small size of nanoparticles facilitates easier rearrangement of atomic positions, allowing for rapid alteration of bond distances necessary for catalytic turnover.
