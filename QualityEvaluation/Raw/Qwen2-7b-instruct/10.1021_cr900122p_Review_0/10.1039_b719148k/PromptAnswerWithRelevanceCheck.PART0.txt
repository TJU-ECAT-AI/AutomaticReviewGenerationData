The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, the metal center acts as a Lewis acid, abstracting a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a carbocation intermediate. The carbocation is then oxidized to a carboxylic acid derivative, which is subsequently converted to the desired product, maleic anhydride, through further reactions. The unique catalytic properties of nanoparticles, including their ability to control catalytic activity and selectivity by tuning their shape, size, and composition, offer new opportunities in fundamental understanding of molecular surface chemistry and in major chemical energy conversion technologies.

II.a. "LEED surface crystallography studies resulted in the discovery of the reconstruction of clean surfaces. A surface is formed by cutting through the solid parallel to a chosen plane of atoms. Surface reconstruction is caused by the asymmetry of the atomic arrangement at the interface, leading to a change in the electronic states near and at the surface that reduces surface free energy. This results in a change in the equilibrium position of surface atoms."

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

In the context of heterogeneous catalysis, isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through various mechanisms, including Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of a metal-bound alkyl intermediate, which then abstracts a hydrogen atom from an adjacent C-H bond, leading to bond cleavage and subsequent activation. H-abstraction, on the other hand, involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from a C-H bond by a metal-bound species, typically leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation processes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this specific example, butane undergoes oxidation over a catalyst containing an isolated metal center on an oxide support. The metal center facilitates the activation of molecular oxygen or other oxidizing agents, leading to the selective formation of maleic anhydride through a series of reactions that involve the cleavage and recombination of C-H and C-O bonds.

孤立金属中心在氧化物材料中的作用如何促进异相催化中的C-H键活化，涉及哪些机制（如Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象），以及这些原理是如何应用于工业选择性氧化烷烃的过程，以将丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例？

在异相催化中，孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上的作用通过多种机制促进C-H键活化，包括Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽象。Mars van Krevelen机制涉及形成金属结合的烷基中间体，然后从相邻的C-H键中抽象氢原子，导致键断裂并随后激活。H-抽象则涉及由金属结合物种移除C-H键中的氢原子，通常导致形成烷基自由基。这些原理应用于工业选择性氧化过程，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。在这个具体例子中，丁烷在含有孤立金属中心的氧化物支持催化剂上进行氧化。金属中心促进了分子氧或其他氧化剂的活性，导致通过一系列反应选择性地形成马来酸酐，这些反应涉及C-H和C-O键的断裂和重组。

The unique catalytic properties of nanoparticles and the ability to control catalytic activity and selectivity by tuning their shape, size, and composition offer new opportunities in understanding molecular surface chemistry and in major chemical energy conversion technologies. This is achieved through the use of in situ, surface-sensitive techniques like sum frequency generation (SFG) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to monitor nanoparticles undergoing reactions. These methods allow researchers to detect reaction intermediates and products, providing insights into the mechanism of C-H bond activation facilitated by isolated metal centers on oxide materials. Mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction play crucial roles in these processes. For instance, in the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, nanoparticles can enhance the reactivity of the metal center, enabling efficient activation of C-H bonds and subsequent formation of desired products. The small size of nanoparticles facilitates easier rearrangement of atomic positions, allowing for rapid alteration of bond distances necessary for catalytic turnover.
