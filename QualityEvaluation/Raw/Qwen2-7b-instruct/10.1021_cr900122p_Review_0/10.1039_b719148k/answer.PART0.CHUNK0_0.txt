II.a. "LEED surface crystallography studies resulted in the discovery of the reconstruction of clean surfaces. A surface is formed by cutting through the solid parallel to a chosen plane of atoms."

II.b. "Combined molecular beam surface scattering and LEED-surface structure studies revealed the unique activity of defects, atomic steps and kinks on metal surfaces in dissociating HH, CH, CC, CRO and OQO bonds."

III.a. "Many catalytic reactions cannot be fully studied in a vacuum because of the very low reaction probability inhibiting their detection. Techniques utilized to study surfaces under pressure have been developed."

III.b. "SFG vibrational spectroscopy under high-pressure benzene hydrogenation revealed three characteristic vibrational bands on the Pt(111) surface, HCC, vinylic (HCQ C), and physisorbed benzene bands."

IV.a. "The porous nature of capping layers allows the reactants and products to travel through the capping layer, exhibiting reproducible measurements of turnover rate."

IV.b. "These results show that benzene formation declines as particle size increases, while cyclohexene formation remains unchanged with changes in particle size. The activation energy for dehydrogenation to benzene increases with increasing particle size."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, the metal center acts as a Lewis acid, abstracting a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a carbocation intermediate. The carbocation is then oxidized to a carboxylic acid derivative, which is subsequently converted to the desired product, maleic anhydride, through further reactions. The unique catalytic properties of nanoparticles, including their ability to control catalytic activity and selectivity by tuning their shape, size, and composition, offer new opportunities in fundamental understanding of molecular surface chemistry and in major chemical energy conversion technologies.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料上通过Mars van Krevelen和H-抽象过程促进C-H键激活，在异相催化中起作用。这些原理应用于工业中对烷烃的选择性氧化，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例。在这个过程中，金属中心作为路易斯酸，从烷烃中提取氢原子，形成碳正离子中间体。碳正离子随后被氧化为羧酸衍生物，进而通过进一步反应转化为所需的产物，即马来酸酐。纳米粒子的独特催化性质，包括通过调整其形状、大小和组成来控制催化活性和选择性的能力，为分子表面化学的基本理解以及重大化学能源转换技术提供了新的机遇。
