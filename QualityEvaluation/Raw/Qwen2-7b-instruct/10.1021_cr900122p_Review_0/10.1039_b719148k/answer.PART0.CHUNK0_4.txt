[1] "Our studies indicate that the platinum surface restructures during catalytic reactions. It has a different structure when it carries out oxidation reactions than when it rearranges organic molecules. This chameleon-like behavior makes it very versatile in many catalytic reactions."
[2] "Size, shape and composition of nanoparticles play important roles in determining reaction activity and selectivity and is covered in this tutorial review."
[3] "Reaction selectivity is much less understood than reaction activity of single-product catalytic reactions, such as ammonia synthesis or ethylene hydrogenation."
[4] "The metal nanoparticles cannot be imaged because of the polymer capping."

The platinum surface adapts its structure depending on the type of catalytic reaction, exhibiting a versatile behavior that facilitates various catalytic processes. The size, shape, and composition of nanoparticles significantly influence their activity and selectivity in chemical reactions. The selectivity of reactions involving multiple pathways is less explored compared to single-product catalytic reactions. The presence of polymer capping prevents imaging the metal nanoparticles using scanning tunneling microscopy.

铂表面根据催化反应的不同，会调整其结构，展现出高度的适应性和多功能性。纳米颗粒的大小、形状和组成对其化学反应的活性和选择性有重要影响。涉及多种途径的反应的选择性研究较少，相较于单一产物的催化反应。聚合物包覆的存在阻止了对金属纳米颗粒进行扫描隧道显微镜成像。
