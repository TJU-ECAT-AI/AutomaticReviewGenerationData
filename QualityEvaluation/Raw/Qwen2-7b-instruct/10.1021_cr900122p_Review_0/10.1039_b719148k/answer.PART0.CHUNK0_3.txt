[1] "Nature and technology produce catalysts on the nanometre scale because the small number of atoms permits the flexible rearrangement of atomic position in the catalyst."
[2] "When a metal atom has fewer neighbors, as would be the case in a nanoparticle, less energy is required for rearrangement to occur."
[3] "Catalysis takes place more easily in a nanoparticle form, where less atoms and molecules participate in the restructuring during the catalytic turnover."

Nano-sized metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by enabling flexible atomic rearrangement. This is achieved through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, the smaller number of atoms in a nanoparticle requires less energy for rearrangement, making the catalytic turnover more efficient. Less atoms and molecules participating in the restructuring further enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity.

纳米尺度的金属中心在异相催化中通过允许催化剂原子的灵活重排，促进了C-H键的活化。这种过程通过Mars van Krevelen和H-摘除等机制实现。这些原理在工业选择性氧化烷烃中得到了应用，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例。在这个过程中，纳米颗粒中较少的原子需要较少的能量进行重组，使催化循环更加有效。参与重新排列的原子和分子更少进一步提高了催化活性和选择性。
