1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials enable C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These mechanisms involve sequential hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion. They are utilized in industrial selective oxidation processes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.
