[1] "In selective oxidation of paraffins, the following three main questions are addressed: How is it possible to stop the oxidation at some intermediate products (avoiding its total oxidation) without operating at very low contact time, when the intermediates are more reactive than the paraffin?"
[2] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."
[3] "The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature."
[4] "Several processes have been developed in recent years for n-butane oxidation which differ in regard to the following aspects': Type of reactor (fixed, fluidized, or moving bed), Type of recovery of maleic anhydride (anhydrous or aqueous), and System for the purification of maleic anhydride."
[5] "High availability in many regions, and The different processes that have been proposed together with their main features are summarized in Table 1."
[6] "The aim of this review is to confirm, modify, complete, or reject the main conclusions reported in a previous review based on the results reported in the scientific literature of the last few years."

To address the questions regarding how selective oxidation of paraffins can be achieved, particularly focusing on stopping the oxidation at some intermediate products without operating at very low contact time, the document explores the mechanism of activation of the paraffin, abstraction of hydrogen, or hydrogen ion donation. The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is highlighted as the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin. Various aspects such as the type of reactor, recovery of maleic anhydride, and the system for purifying maleic anhydride are discussed across different processes developed for n-butane oxidation. These details provide insights into optimizing contact time and achieving selective oxidation of paraffins.
