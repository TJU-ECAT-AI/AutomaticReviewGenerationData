[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."
[2] "Several processes have been developed in recent years for n-butane oxidation which differ in regard to the following aspects': Type of reactor (fixed, fluidized, or moving bed), Type of recovery of maleic anhydride (anhydrous or aqueous), and System for the purification of maleic anhydride."
[3] "The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature?"
[4] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
[5] "Only when a considerable excess of phosphorus is used, (P/V>2), may another phase appear, VO(H2P04)2."
[6] "Formation of colloidal V205 at the water-alcohol interface (this has been proposed by some authors, but according to others it is not an important step)."
[7] "The type of alcohol influences the morphology of (VO)HP04.0.5H20. With isobutanol, nonagglomerated platelets (rosette morphology) form with preferential exposure of the basal plane (Ool). With sec-or t-butyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol well formed, nonagglomerated platelets are obtained."
[8] "With increasing the atomic P/V ratio, the morphology changes from nonuniformly sized clumps (at P/V=l.O) to uniformly sized rosettes (P/V=l.l), to well-defined crystal plates (P/V=I 2)."
[9] "The effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
[10] "Different types of VOPO,, some of which can be reversibly reduced to (VO),P207,have been the 6 and aIr,2027 the y-25 and the 6*-19 VOPO."
[11] "Very likely these findings are less important for the most active and selective catalysts, where only one phase has been detected, but they can be important in the formation, and in the catalytic properties, of the vanadylpyrophosphate during the activation procedure."
[12] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one."
[13] "According to the authors, an equilibrated catalyst is the one that has been kept in a flow of n-butane and air with a hydrocarbon concentration of 1.4 to 2 percent for approximately 200 to 1 , O hours."
[14] "The equilibrated catalyst has an average vanadium oxidation state in the range of 4.00 to 4.04, a bulk P/V ratio of 1 . O to 1.025,and an XPS surface atomic P/V ratio of 1.5 to 3.0."

1. The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin. Several processes have been developed, differing in reactor type, maleic anhydride recovery method, and purification system.

2. The catalyst and reaction for this process have been extensively studied in scientific literature. The chemistry of preparation of the active phase explains variations and lack of reproducibility across studies.

3. The preparation of the catalyst involves multiple steps, including reduction of V5' compounds, addition of phosphoric acid, and filtration. The most effective preparation uses dry phosphoric acid and results in a phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization.

4. The morphology of the catalyst's active phase, (VO)HP04.0.5H20, is influenced by factors like the type of alcohol used, the atomic P/V ratio, and washing procedures. 

5. The P/V ratio plays a crucial role in the catalytic behavior, affecting the catalyst's reducibility and reoxidizability. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus exhibit optimal activity and selectivity.

6. The mechanism of the reaction involves activation of the paraffin with high selectivity, followed by a series of steps including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and lactone formation, culminating in the formation of maleic anhydride.

7. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride showcases the polyfunctional nature of V-P catalysts, capable of activating paraffin with high selectivity and facilitating a series of interconnected reactions.

8. The properties of the catalyst, such as exposure of the (001) plane, strain in the crystallite, and extent of reduction of V5+, influence the catalytic performance.

9. The activation procedure varies, with some catalysts undergoing transformation in an oxygen-free atmosphere, while others are activated through multistep calcination in air. Factors like morphology, P/V ratio, and presence of defects impact the transformation.

10. Conditioning of the catalyst is necessary for maintaining constant catalytic behavior over time. Equilibrated catalysts show stable V4+ and exhibit reduced reoxidizability.

11. The excess phosphorus in the catalyst helps prevent oxidation of the catalyst by forming a phase on the side faces of the (100) plane.

12. The morphology of the catalyst's active phase is influenced by the type of alcohol used in preparation, with isobutanol leading to nonagglomerated platelets and other alcohols forming well-formed platelets.

13. The atomic P/V ratio affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity, with a slight excess promoting the right balance between reducibility and reoxidizability for optimal performance.

14. The equilibration process involves keeping the catalyst in a flow of n-butane and air for a specified period, leading to a catalyst with a stable V4+ state and specific chemical characteristics.
