[1] "In selective oxidation of paraffins, the following three main questions are addressed: How is it possible to stop the oxidation at some intermediate products (avoiding its total oxidation) without operating at very low contact time, when the intermediates are more reactive than the paraffin?"
[2] "In the preparation with benzyl alcohol as the reducing agent, many authors report the formation of platelets with stacking faults (deduced from the preferential broadening of the [Ool] reflection) attributed to the trapping of alcohol between the layers of the precursor and its release during actiation."
[3] "Different types of VOPO,, some of which can be reversibly reduced to (VO),P207,have been the 6 and aIr,2027 the y-25 and the 6*-19"
[4] "Very likely these findings are less important for the most active and selective catalysts, where only one phase has been detected, but they can be important in the formation, and in the catalytic properties, of the vanadylpyrophosphate during the activation procedure."
[5] "By means of electron microscopy,103 it has been observed that the dehydrated phase maintains the morphology of the precursor. In addition, XRD analysis has shown that the broadening of reflections corresponding to the basal planes of the precursor also occurs in the reflections corresponding to the basal planes of (VO)2P207,as shown in Figure 2."

Selective oxidation of paraffins involves addressing three main questions: how to halt the reaction at an intermediate product without significantly decreasing efficiency, the mechanism of paraffin activation, and whether the selectivity is linked to the activation mechanism. In the preparation process, platelets with stacking faults are formed when benzyl alcohol is used as a reducing agent. Various forms of VOPO, can be reversibly reduced to (VO)2P207. These findings are crucial for the most active and selective catalysts, influencing the formation and properties of vanadylpyrophosphate during activation. Electron microscopy and XRD analysis reveal that the dehydrated phase retains the precursor's morphology and that the broadening of reflections from the precursor's basal planes is preserved in the (VO)2P207 phase.

在选择性烷烃氧化中，主要涉及三个关键问题：如何在中间产物时停止氧化反应，而不会显著降低效率；烷烃激活机制是什么；选择性是否与激活机制有关。在准备过程中，使用苯基乙醇作为还原剂时，会形成具有层间陷阱和释放的堆叠缺陷的片状结构。不同类型的VOPO,可以可逆地还原为(VO)2P207。这些发现对于最活跃和选择性的催化剂至关重要，影响了激活过程中vanadylpyrophosphate的形成和性质。通过电子显微镜和XRD分析发现，脱水相保留了前体的形态，并且从前体的基本平面反射的扩展也出现在(VO)2P207的反射中。
