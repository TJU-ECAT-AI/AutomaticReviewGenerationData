Selective oxidation of C4 paraffins involves various processes differing in reactor type, maleic anhydride recovery method, and purification system. The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process, utilizing catalysts like (VO)2P2O7. Catalyst preparation involves specific conditions, including the P/V ratio, morphology, and activation procedure. After activation, catalysts can undergo conditioning, transforming from nonequilibrated to equilibrated states. Equilibrated catalysts exhibit stable V4+ ions, maintaining constant behavior over time, unlike nonequilibrated catalysts which show higher activity but lower selectivity, particularly at high conversion rates.

The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the primary industrial process for selective oxidation of paraffins. Since 1974, n-butane has been favored over benzene for maleic anhydride production due to its lower cost and non-toxicity. Various processes for n-butane oxidation exist, differing in reactor type, maleic anhydride recovery, and purification systems. The catalyst and reaction have been extensively studied in scientific literature. The chemistry of catalyst preparation involves factors such as solvent choice, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation conditions. Catalyst activation typically transforms the precursor into a crystalline vanadylphosphate, which can undergo oxidation to a V5+ phase. Equilibrated catalysts, maintained under specific conditions, exhibit consistent performance for extended periods.

1. The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin. Several processes have been developed, differing in reactor type, maleic anhydride recovery method, and purification system.

2. The catalyst and reaction for this process have been extensively studied in scientific literature. The chemistry of preparation of the active phase explains variations and lack of reproducibility across studies.

3. The preparation of the catalyst involves multiple steps, including reduction of V5' compounds, addition of phosphoric acid, and filtration. The most effective preparation uses dry phosphoric acid and results in a phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization.

4. The morphology of the catalyst's active phase, (VO)HP04.0.5H20, is influenced by factors like the type of alcohol used, the atomic P/V ratio, and washing procedures. 

5. The P/V ratio plays a crucial role in the catalytic behavior, affecting the catalyst's reducibility and reoxidizability. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus exhibit optimal activity and selectivity.

6. The mechanism of the reaction involves activation of the paraffin with high selectivity, followed by a series of steps including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and lactone formation, culminating in the formation of maleic anhydride.

7. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride showcases the polyfunctional nature of V-P catalysts, capable of activating paraffin with high selectivity and facilitating a series of interconnected reactions.

8. The properties of the catalyst, such as exposure of the (001) plane, strain in the crystallite, and extent of reduction of V5+, influence the catalytic performance.

9. The activation procedure varies, with some catalysts undergoing transformation in an oxygen-free atmosphere, while others are activated through multistep calcination in air. Factors like morphology, P/V ratio, and presence of defects impact the transformation.

10. Conditioning of the catalyst is necessary for maintaining constant catalytic behavior over time. Equilibrated catalysts show stable V4+ and exhibit reduced reoxidizability.

11. The excess phosphorus in the catalyst helps prevent oxidation of the catalyst by forming a phase on the side faces of the (100) plane.

12. The morphology of the catalyst's active phase is influenced by the type of alcohol used in preparation, with isobutanol leading to nonagglomerated platelets and other alcohols forming well-formed platelets.

13. The atomic P/V ratio affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity, with a slight excess promoting the right balance between reducibility and reoxidizability for optimal performance.

14. The equilibration process involves keeping the catalyst in a flow of n-butane and air for a specified period, leading to a catalyst with a stable V4+ state and specific chemical characteristics.

[1] "In selective oxidation of paraffins, the following three main questions are addressed: How is it possible to stop the oxidation at some intermediate products (avoiding its total oxidation) without operating at very low contact time, when the intermediates are more reactive than the paraffin?"
[2] "In the preparation with benzyl alcohol as the reducing agent, many authors report the formation of platelets with stacking faults (deduced from the preferential broadening of the [Ool] reflection) attributed to the trapping of alcohol between the layers of the precursor and its release during actiation."
[3] "Different types of VOPO,, some of which can be reversibly reduced to (VO),P207,have been the 6 and aIr,2027 the y-25 and the 6*-19"
[4] "Very likely these findings are less important for the most active and selective catalysts, where only one phase has been detected, but they can be important in the formation, and in the catalytic properties, of the vanadylpyrophosphate during the activation procedure."
[5] "By means of electron microscopy,103 it has been observed that the dehydrated phase maintains the morphology of the precursor. In addition, XRD analysis has shown that the broadening of reflections corresponding to the basal planes of the precursor also occurs in the reflections corresponding to the basal planes of (VO)2P207,as shown in Figure 2."

Selective oxidation of paraffins involves addressing three main questions: how to halt the reaction at an intermediate product without significantly decreasing efficiency, the mechanism of paraffin activation, and whether the selectivity is linked to the activation mechanism. In the preparation process, platelets with stacking faults are formed when benzyl alcohol is used as a reducing agent. Various forms of VOPO, can be reversibly reduced to (VO)2P207. These findings are crucial for the most active and selective catalysts, influencing the formation and properties of vanadylpyrophosphate during activation. Electron microscopy and XRD analysis reveal that the dehydrated phase retains the precursor's morphology and that the broadening of reflections from the precursor's basal planes is preserved in the (VO)2P207 phase.
