[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."
[2] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons3: Lower price, Nontoxicity."
[3] "Several processes have been developed in recent years for n-butane oxidation which differ in regard to the following aspects': Type of reactor (fixed, fluidized, or moving bed), Type of recovery of maleic anhydride (anhydrous or aqueous), and System for the purification of maleic anhydride."
[4] "The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature."
[5] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
[6] "There is large consensus274*6,10-15 that the necessary conditions to obtain an optimal catalyst are the following: Synthesis of microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, characterized by a preferential exposure of the basal plane (001); Presence of defects in stacking of the platelets; and Slight excess of phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric amount, an atomic P/V ratio in the range of 1.01 to 1.10 (the excess phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric amount remains strongly bound with the acid vanadylphosphate; in fact, it is not removed by washing the precipitate)."
[7] "The aim of this review is to confirm, modify, complete, or reject the main conclusions reported in a previous review? based on the results reported in the scientific literature of the last few years."
[8] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high tempera- ture."
[9] "In catalysts activated in air, the transformation from an amorphous phase to an almost completely crystal- line vanadylpyrophosphate inside the reactor (in the presence of the reactant's mixture) requires more than 100 hours."
[10] "According to Sola et a1.?6 the conditions required can be less severe; in particular,an equilibrated catalyst is the one that maintains a constant catalytic behavior for at least 50 hours."

The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the primary industrial process for selective oxidation of paraffins. Since 1974, n-butane has been favored over benzene for maleic anhydride production due to its lower cost and non-toxicity. Various processes for n-butane oxidation exist, differing in reactor type, maleic anhydride recovery, and purification systems. The catalyst and reaction have been extensively studied in scientific literature. The chemistry of catalyst preparation involves factors such as solvent choice, P/V ratio, presence of additives, and activation conditions. Catalyst activation typically transforms the precursor into a crystalline vanadylphosphate, which can undergo oxidation to a V5+ phase. Equilibrated catalysts, maintained under specific conditions, exhibit consistent performance for extended periods.

将正丁烷氧化为马来酸酐是选择性氧化烷烃的主要工业过程。自1974年以来，由于成本较低且无毒性，正丁烷被用作马来酸酐生产的首选原料，取代了苯。存在多种n-丁烷氧化工艺，它们在反应器类型、马来酸酐回收和纯化系统方面有所不同。催化剂及其反应在科学文献中进行了广泛研究。催化剂制备化学涉及溶剂选择、P/V比、添加剂存在、激活条件等因素。催化剂活化通常将前体转化为结晶钒磷酸盐，该物质可能被氧化为V5+相。经过特定条件维持的催化剂，在长时间内能够表现出一致的性能。
