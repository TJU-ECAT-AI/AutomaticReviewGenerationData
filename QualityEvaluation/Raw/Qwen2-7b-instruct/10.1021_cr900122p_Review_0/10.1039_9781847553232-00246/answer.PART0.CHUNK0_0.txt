Selective oxidation of C4 paraffins involves various processes differing in reactor type, maleic anhydride recovery method, and purification system. The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a well-studied industrial process, utilizing catalysts like (VO)2P2O7. Catalyst preparation involves specific conditions, including the P/V ratio, morphology, and activation procedure. After activation, catalysts can undergo conditioning, transforming from nonequilibrated to equilibrated states. Equilibrated catalysts exhibit stable V4+ ions, maintaining constant behavior over time, unlike nonequilibrated catalysts which show higher activity but lower selectivity, particularly at high conversion rates.

选择性氧化C4烷烃涉及各种过程，这些过程在反应器类型、马来酸酐回收方法和净化系统方面有所不同。将丁烷氧化为马来酸酐是已充分研究的工业过程，利用（VO）2P2O7等催化剂。催化剂制备涉及特定条件，包括P/V比、形态和活化程序。活化后，催化剂可以经历调整，从非平衡态转变为平衡态。平衡态催化剂表现出稳定的V4+离子，维持恒定的行为，而非平衡态催化剂则显示出更高的活性但较低的选择性，尤其是在高转化率的情况下。
