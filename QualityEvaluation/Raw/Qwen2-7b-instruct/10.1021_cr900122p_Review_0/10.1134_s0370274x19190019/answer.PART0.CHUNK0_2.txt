Isolated metal centers on oxide materials contribute to C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism and hydrogen abstraction. In the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, the metal center accepts electron density from the oxide material, stabilizing a carbocation intermediate. Hydrogen abstraction removes a hydrogen atom from the substrate, leading to the formation of a carbocation. These principles are utilized in industrial processes, notably in the selective oxidation of alkanes. An example of this application is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the metal center on the oxide material activates the C-H bond in butane.

孤立的金属中心在氧化材料上对异相催化中的C-H键活化起着关键作用，通过Mars-van-Krevelen机制和氢抽象等机制。在Mars-van-Krevelen机制中，金属中心从氧化物材料接受电子密度，稳定一个碳阳离子中间体。氢抽象从基质中去除一个氢原子，导致形成一个碳阳离子。这些原理应用于各种工业过程，特别是烷烃的选择性氧化。但烯转化为马来酸酐就是一个例子，其中金属中心在氧化物材料上活化了但烯中的C-H键。
