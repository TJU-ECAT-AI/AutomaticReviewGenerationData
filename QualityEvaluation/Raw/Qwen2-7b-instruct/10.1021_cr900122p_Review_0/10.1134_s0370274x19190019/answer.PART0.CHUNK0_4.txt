[1] "The mechanism of C-H bond activation involves the formation of an intermediate with a high-energy state, which facilitates the breaking of the C-H bond."
[2] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in the activation of C-H bonds due to their ability to stabilize the intermediate."
[3] "In heterogeneous catalysis, the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are key processes involved in the activation of C-H bonds."
[4] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride exemplifies the application of these principles in industrial selective oxidation."

Answer: Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through their ability to stabilize high-energy intermediates. Key processes involved are the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. These principles are applied industrially in the selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.
