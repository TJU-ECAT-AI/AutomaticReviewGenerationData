1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. These mechanisms involve the transfer of a proton from the catalyst surface to the substrate, followed by the migration of the resulting cation to the metal center (Mars-van Krevelen mechanism), and the removal of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by the metal center, leading to bond cleavage and subsequent functionalization (H-abstraction). These principles are widely applied in industrial selective oxidation processes, including the conversion of alkanes to alcohols, ketones, and other valuable chemicals. Specific examples of their application include the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

1.孤立在氧化物材料上的金属中心通过均相催化作用促进C-H键活化，这通常涉及火星-范克里夫机制和H抽取等机制。火星-范克里夫机制涉及从催化剂表面转移一个质子到基质，随后该阳离子迁移到金属中心。H抽取涉及由金属中心从基质中移除一个氢原子，导致键断裂并随后发生功能化。这些原则广泛应用于工业选择性氧化过程，包括烷烃转化为醇、酮和其他有价值的化学品。具体应用示例包括将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。
