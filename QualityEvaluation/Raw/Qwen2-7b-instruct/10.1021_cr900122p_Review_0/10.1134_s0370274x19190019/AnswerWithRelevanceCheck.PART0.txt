          [1] "The isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation through various mechanisms, including the Mars-van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction."
          [2] "In the Mars-van Krevelen pathway, the metal center acts as a catalyst, transferring electrons to the substrate, leading to the formation of an intermediate that can undergo further reactions."
          [3] "H-abstraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by the metal center, which facilitates the breaking of the C-H bond."
          [4] "These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation processes, such as the conversion of alkanes, where the goal is to selectively oxidize specific functional groups while minimizing unwanted side reactions."
          [5] "For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the isolated metal centers on the oxide material enable the selective oxidation of the alkane, with the formation of maleic anhydride as the desired product."

          Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through mechanisms like the Mars-van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. These mechanisms involve electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction, respectively. In industrial applications, such as the selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles enable the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride with high selectivity.
