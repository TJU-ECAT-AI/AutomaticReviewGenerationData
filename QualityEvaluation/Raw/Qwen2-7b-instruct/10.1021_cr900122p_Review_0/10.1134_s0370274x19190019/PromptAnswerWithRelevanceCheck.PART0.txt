[1] "The isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation through various mechanisms, including the Mars-van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction."
[2] "In the Mars-van Krevelen pathway, the metal center acts as a catalyst, transferring electrons to the substrate, leading to the formation of an intermediate that can undergo further reactions."
[3] "H-abstraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by the metal center, which facilitates the breaking of the C-H bond."
[4] "These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation processes, such as the conversion of alkanes, where the goal is to selectively oxidize specific functional groups while minimizing unwanted side reactions."
[5] "For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the isolated metal centers on the oxide material enable the selective oxidation of the alkane, with the formation of maleic anhydride as the desired product."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars-van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. These mechanisms involve electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction, respectively. In industrial applications, such as the selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles enable the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride with high selectivity.

[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "The activation process typically involves mechanisms such as the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism and hydrogen abstraction."
[3] "In the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, the metal center acts as a Lewis acid, accepting electron density from the oxygen atom of the oxide material, which leads to the stabilization of a carbocation intermediate."
[4] "Hydrogen abstraction occurs when a hydrogen atom is removed from the substrate, allowing for the formation of a carbocation."
[5] "These principles are applied in various industrial processes, including the selective oxidation of alkanes."
[6] "A specific example of this application is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the metal center on the oxide material facilitates the activation of the C-H bond in butane."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials contribute to C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism and hydrogen abstraction. In the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, the metal center accepts electron density from the oxide material, stabilizing a carbocation intermediate. Hydrogen abstraction removes a hydrogen atom from the substrate, leading to the formation of a carbocation. These principles are utilized in industrial processes, notably in the selective oxidation of alkanes. An example of this application is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the metal center on the oxide material activates the C-H bond in butane.

孤立的金属中心在氧化材料上对异相催化中的C-H键活化起着关键作用，通过Mars-van-Krevelen机制和氢抽象等机制。在Mars-van-Krevelen机制中，金属中心从氧化物材料接受电子密度，稳定一个碳阳离子中间体。氢抽象从基质中去除一个氢原子，导致形成一个碳阳离子。这些原理应用于各种工业过程，特别是烷烃的选择性氧化。但烯转化为马来酸酐就是一个例子，其中金属中心在氧化物材料上活化了但烯中的C-H键。

1.Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction. These mechanisms involve the transfer of a proton from the catalyst surface to the substrate, followed by the migration of the resulting cation to the metal center (Mars-van Krevelen mechanism), and the removal of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by the metal center, leading to bond cleavage and subsequent functionalization (H-abstraction). These principles are widely applied in industrial selective oxidation processes, including the conversion of alkanes to alcohols, ketones, and other valuable chemicals. Specific examples of their application include the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

1.孤立在氧化物材料上的金属中心通过均相催化作用促进C-H键活化，这通常涉及火星-范克里夫机制和H抽取等机制。火星-范克里夫机制涉及从催化剂表面转移一个质子到基质，随后该阳离子迁移到金属中心。H抽取涉及由金属中心从基质中移除一个氢原子，导致键断裂并随后发生功能化。这些原则广泛应用于工业选择性氧化过程，包括烷烃转化为醇、酮和其他有价值的化学品。具体应用示例包括将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。
