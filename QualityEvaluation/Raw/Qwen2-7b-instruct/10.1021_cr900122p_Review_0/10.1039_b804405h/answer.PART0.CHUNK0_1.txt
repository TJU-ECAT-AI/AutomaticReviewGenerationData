[1] "The first catalytic tests showed very strong oxidizing properties of the (FePctBu4)2NH2O2 system and prompted us to try the oxidation of CH4."
[2] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 °C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[3] "At 40-50 °C HCOOH and CH2O were obtained in 2:1 ratio (runs 2 and 3)."
[4] "At higher temperature the amount of CH2O diminished in favour of HCOOH."
[5] "The activity of the catalyst was similar between 40 and 80 °C, providing 26-32 turnovers."
[6] "The oxidation of CH4 was tested at different temperatures."
[7] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 °C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13."
[8] "When the reaction was performed in 97% H218O, CH3OH didn't contain 18O, indicating that its oxygen originated from H216O2."
[9] "Formic acid was composed of 18% of HCO16OH, 59% of HCO16O18OH, and 23% of HCO18O2."
[10] "The oxidation of CH4 was tested at different temperatures."
[11] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 °C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13."
[12] "The best solution to avoid uncertainties due to solvent oxidation is to use water, an inert, green and biologically relevant solvent."
[13] "With this aim, m-nitrido complex was supported onto silica."
[14] "The CH4 oxidation was unequivocally evidenced using labeled 13CH4 in D2O at 60 °C."
[15] "When the mixture of 53% of CH4 and 47% of 13CH4 was used for oxidation, the 13C NMR spectrum of the final reaction mixture showed two signals attributed to hydrated formaldehyde 13CH2(OH)2 and H13COOH, respectively."

The isolated metal center in the m-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine complex facilitates C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through the formation of highly oxidizing diiron species. These species are capable of attacking a CH bond in CH4. The mechanism involves the creation of a strong oxidizing diiron species, which is a characteristic of methane monooxygenase enzymes in nature. The diiron structure is kept intact throughout the catalytic process, as evidenced by positive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectra. The system shows high efficiency in the oxidation of CH4 at various temperatures, with the highest TON being 13 at 25°C. The oxidation occurs in water, a green and biologically relevant solvent, demonstrating the system's potential for practical applications. The selectivity of the reaction is evident from the isotopic labeling experiments, which show that the oxygen in formic acid originates from H2O2, while the oxygen in methanol comes from the catalyst itself. The high stability of the catalyst allows for recycling and continuous use, as demonstrated by the retention of catalytic activity in the second cycle. This catalytic system offers several attractive features, including the use of a clean oxidant (H2O2) and reaction medium (H2O), and the ease of separating the solid catalyst by filtration. The phthalocyanine complex is accessible in bulk quantities, making it potentially cost-effective compared to other complexes. The system shows activity comparable to the most efficient so far, approaching the performance of the Perianas system based on Pt(II) bipyrimidine complex in oleum at 220°C.
