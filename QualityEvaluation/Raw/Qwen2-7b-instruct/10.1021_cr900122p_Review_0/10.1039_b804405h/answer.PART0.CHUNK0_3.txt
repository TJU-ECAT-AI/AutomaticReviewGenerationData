[1] "A stable l-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine activates H2O2 to oxidize CH4 in water at 2560 1C to methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid as evidenced using 13C and 18O labelling."
[2] "The diiron structure was kept intact as evidenced by positive electrospray ionization mass spectro- metry (ESI-MS)."
[3] "The first catalytic tests showed very strong oxidizing proper- ties of the (FePctBu4)2NH2O2 system and prompted us to try the oxidation of CH4."
[4] "With this aim, m-nitrido complex was sup- ported onto silica."
[5] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 1C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[6] "The activity of the catalyst was similar between 40 and 80 1C, providing 2632 turnovers."
[7] "The heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond in FeIVNFeIIIOOH complex and the formation of putative very strong oxidizing FeIVNFeVQO species should be favoured in the presence of acid by the protonation of peroxide oxygen."
[8] "The TONHCOOH was increased by more than a factor of 3 to attain 72.8."
[9] "Remarkably, the catalytic system retained practically the same catalytic activity in the second cycle (Table 1,run 7), indicating a high stability of the catalyst and even a possibility of recycling."
[10] "In contrast to the much more expensive porphyrin and non-heme complexes, phthalocyanines can be accessible in bulk quantities."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen process and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The diiron structure in the complex was kept intact, as confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS). The system showed strong oxidizing properties, prompting the researchers to test its ability to oxidize methane. To achieve this, the m-nitrido complex was supported onto silica. The oxidation of methane was efficient even at 25°C, resulting in formic acid with a turnover number (TON) of 13. The activity of the catalyst was consistent between 40 and 80°C, providing 2632 turnovers. The heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond in the complex leads to the formation of a very strong oxidizing species, which is favored by protonation of the peroxide oxygen. The catalytic system retained high stability and even the possibility of recycling. Phthalocyanines, being accessible in bulk quantities, offer an attractive alternative to more expensive porphyrin and non-heme complexes in catalysis.

孤立金属中心在异相催化中通过Mars van Krevelen过程和H抽象等机制促进C-H键活化。这些原理应用于工业选择性烷烃氧化，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。复合物中的双铁结构保持不变，由电喷雾离子质谱（ESI-MS）确认。该系统显示出很强的氧化性质，促使研究人员测试其氧化甲烷的能力。为了实现这一点，将m-硝基络合物支撑到硅胶上。甲烷的氧化即使在25°C下也效率很高，产生了形式酸，转化数（TON）为13。催化剂在40至80°C之间的活性一致，提供了2632次转换。异裂OO键在复合物中导致形成一种非常强的氧化物种，这得益于过氧化氧的质子化。催化系统保持高稳定性，并且甚至有可能循环利用。由于可以大量获得，酞菁类化合物为催化提供了一个有吸引力的选择，与更昂贵的卟啉和非血红素复合物相比。
