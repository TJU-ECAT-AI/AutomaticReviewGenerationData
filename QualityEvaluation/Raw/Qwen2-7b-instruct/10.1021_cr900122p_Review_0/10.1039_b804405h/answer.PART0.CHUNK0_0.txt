1. Low temperature oxidation of methane has been inspired by the work of Shilov and colleagues on methane activation on platinum, which involved harsh conditions such as strong concentrated acids and high temperatures.

2. The iron-phthalocyanine complex (FePctBu4)2N interacts with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in a way that changes its UV-Vis and EPR spectra.

3. The diiron structure within the complex remains intact when subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).

4. Initial methane oxidation tests were conducted in a mixture of methylene chloride (MeCN) with 0.1 mM of the complex and 67 mM of H2O2.

5. The main product from methane oxidation was formic acid, with other minor products including acetic acid, methanol, acetone, and oxidation products of methylene chloride.

6. During the oxidation process, 13C-labeled methane (13CH4) was used to obtain two signals at 81.6 and 165.5 ppm in the final reaction mixture's 13C NMR spectrum, attributed to hydrated formaldehyde and formic acid.

7. The ratio of products derived from methane compared to methylene chloride (MeCN) did not align with a free radical mechanism of oxidation.

8. Methane oxidation occurred efficiently even at 25°C, resulting in formic acid with a turnover number (TON) of 13.

9. At temperatures ranging from 40 to 50°C, the oxidation yielded formic acid and formaldehyde in a 2:1 ratio.

10. The catalytic activity of the complex was consistent between 40 and 80°C, achieving 2632 turnovers.

11. In the first step of the oxidation process, the complex coordinates with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form a hydroperoxo complex that is likely in equilibrium with its deprotonated form.

12. Recent density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that water favors the formation of a non-heme HOFeV Q O species through water-assisted cleavage of the O-O bond.

13. The heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond in the hydroperoxo complex leads to the formation of a very strong oxidizing FeIVNFeV Q O species, which is favored in the presence of acid due to protonation of the peroxide oxygen.
