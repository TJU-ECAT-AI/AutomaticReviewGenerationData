The isolated metal center in the m-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine complex facilitates C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through the formation of highly oxidizing diiron species. These species are capable of attacking a CH bond in CH4. The mechanism involves the creation of a strong oxidizing diiron species, which is a characteristic of methane monooxygenase enzymes in nature. The diiron structure is kept intact throughout the catalytic process, as evidenced by positive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectra. The system shows high efficiency in the oxidation of CH4 at various temperatures, with the highest TON being 13 at 25°C. The oxidation occurs in water, a green and biologically relevant solvent, demonstrating the system's potential for practical applications. The selectivity of the reaction is evident from the isotopic labeling experiments, which show that the oxygen in formic acid originates from H2O2, while the oxygen in methanol comes from the catalyst itself. The high stability of the catalyst allows for recycling and continuous use, as demonstrated by the retention of catalytic activity in the second cycle. This catalytic system offers several attractive features, including the use of a clean oxidant (H2O2) and reaction medium (H2O), and the ease of separating the solid catalyst by filtration. The phthalocyanine complex is accessible in bulk quantities, making it potentially cost-effective compared to other complexes. The system shows activity comparable to the most efficient so far, approaching the performance of the Perianas system based on Pt(II) bipyrimidine complex in oleum at 220°C.

The document describes a method of oxidizing methane (CH4) in water using a stable l-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine complex, which activates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid. The process is facilitated at 2560°C. The catalyst, (FePctBu4)2NH2O2, showed strong oxidizing properties, prompting the authors to test its ability to oxidize methane. The main products of methane oxidation were formic acid, with traces of other compounds. The reaction was efficient even at lower temperatures, such as 25°C, yielding formic acid with a turnover number (TON) of 13. The document suggests that the diiron complex might stabilize ultra-high valent Fe states due to the terminal nitrido ligand. The catalyst demonstrated high performance, oxidizing more than 150 moles of methane per mole of catalyst. The system retained its catalytic activity over multiple cycles, indicating high stability and potential recyclability. The authors propose a tentative mechanism involving the formation of hydroperoxo complexes, heterolytic cleavage of peroxide bonds, and protonation of peroxide oxygen.
