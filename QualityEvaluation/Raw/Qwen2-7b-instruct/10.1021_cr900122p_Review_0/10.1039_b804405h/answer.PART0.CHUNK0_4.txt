[1] "The first catalytic tests showed very strong oxidizing properties of the (FePctBu4)2NH2O2 system and prompted us to try the oxidation of CH4."
[2] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25°C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[3] "At 40-50°C HCOOH and CH2O were obtained in a 2:1 ratio (runs 2 and 3)."
[4] "The activity of the catalyst was similar between 40 and 80°C, providing 26-32 turnovers."
[5] "The stability of CH3OH under the reaction conditions was tested using 0.01 M CH3OH solution in water. The conversion of CH3OH was 82% after 1 h and the HCOOH yield was 80%."
[6] "When the reaction was performed in 97% H218O, CH3OH did not contain 18O, indicating that its oxygen originated from H216O2."
[7] "Formic acid was composed of 18% of HC16O2H, 59% of HC16O18OH, and 23% of HC18O2H."
[8] "The oxidation of CH4 was tested at different temperatures."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The (FePctBu4)2NH2O2 system demonstrated strong oxidizing properties, enabling the efficient oxidation of methane at various temperatures. For instance, at 25°C, the oxidation yielded formic acid with a turnover number (TON) of 13. At higher temperatures, such as 40-50°C, the reaction produced a 2:1 ratio of formic acid and hydrated formaldehyde. The catalyst maintained similar activity across 40-80°C, achieving up to 32 turnovers. The stability of CH3OH under reaction conditions was confirmed by testing its conversion to formic acid. Furthermore, the presence of acid favored the heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond, leading to the formation of a very strong oxidizing FeIVNFeVQO species. The isotopic analysis of the formic acid product further elucidated the origin of oxygen in the compound.

孤立的金属中心在异相催化中通过Mars van Krevelen和H抽象等机制促进了C-H键活化。这些原理被应用于工业中选择性氧化烷烃，以丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例。(FePctBu4)2NH2O2系统表现出强烈的氧化性质，能够使甲烷在不同温度下高效氧化。例如，在25°C时，氧化产物为形式酸，转化数（TON）为13。在更高温度如40-50°C时，反应产生了形式酸与水合甲醛的2:1比率。催化剂在40-80°C之间的活性相似，实现了高达32次周转。在反应条件下CH3OH的稳定性通过测试其转化为形式酸得到了验证。此外，酸的存在促进了OO键的异裂，导致了超高价氧化FeIVNFeVQO物种的形成。对形式酸产品的同位素分析进一步揭示了化合物中氧的来源。
