[1] "A stable l-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine activates H2O2 to oxidize CH4 in water at 2560 1C to methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid as evidenced using 13C and 18O labelling."
[2] "The first catalytic tests showed very strong oxidizing properties of the (FePctBu4)2NH2O2 system and prompted us to try the oxidation of CH4."
[3] "Formic acid was the main product along with traces of acetic acid, methanol, acetone and MeCN oxidation products."
[4] "Neither 13CH3OH (49 ppm) nor 13CO2 (125 ppm) signals were found in this spectrum. CH2O and HCOOH were therefore the main products of CH4 oxidation."
[5] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 1C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[6] "Remarkably, the oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 1C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[7] "The heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond in FeIVNFeIIIOOH complex and the formation of putative very strong oxidizing FeIVNFeV Q O species should be favoured in the presence of acid by the protonation of peroxide oxygen."
[8] "One can suggest that m-nitrido ligand in a diiron complex could also stabilize ultra high valent Fe states."
[9] "Terminal nitrido ligand stabilizes FeV and even FeVI states in mononuclear cyclam complexes."
[10] "The catalyst exhibits a very high performance: more than 150 moles CH4 per mole of catalyst were oxidized to useful products."
[11] "The oxidation of CH4 was tested at different temperatures."
[12] "The activity of the catalyst was similar between 40 and 80 1C, providing 2632 turnovers."
[13] "The stability of CH3OH under the reaction conditions was tested using 0.01 M CH3OH solution in water."
[14] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 1C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[15] "After completion of the first reaction, a new portion of H2O2 was added directly to the reaction mixture."
[16] "Remarkably, the catalytic system retained practically the same catalytic activity in the second cycle (Table 1,run 7), indicating a high stability of the catalyst and even a possibility of recycling."

The document describes a method of oxidizing methane (CH4) in water using a stable l-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine complex, which activates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid. The process is facilitated at 2560°C. The catalyst, (FePctBu4)2NH2O2, showed strong oxidizing properties, prompting the authors to test its ability to oxidize methane. The main products of methane oxidation were formic acid, with traces of other compounds. The reaction was efficient even at lower temperatures, such as 25°C, yielding formic acid with a turnover number (TON) of 13. The document suggests that the diiron complex might stabilize ultra-high valent Fe states due to the terminal nitrido ligand. The catalyst demonstrated high performance, oxidizing more than 150 moles of methane per mole of catalyst. The system retained its catalytic activity over multiple cycles, indicating high stability and potential recyclability. The authors propose a tentative mechanism involving the formation of hydroperoxo complexes, heterolytic cleavage of peroxide bonds, and protonation of peroxide oxygen.

文档描述了一种在水中利用稳定的一硝基二铁酞菁催化剂氧化甲烷（CH4）的方法，该催化剂激活过氧化氢（H2O2），产生甲醛、甲醇和甲酸。该过程在2560°C下进行。催化剂(FePctBu4)2NH2O2显示出强烈的氧化性，促使作者测试其氧化甲烷的能力。甲烷氧化的主要产物是甲酸，还伴有其他化合物的微量。即使在较低温度如25°C下，反应仍然有效，生成甲酸的转化数（TON）为13。文档推测，由于末端硝基配体的作用，双铁复合物可能能够稳定超高价铁状态。该催化剂表现出高效率，每摩尔催化剂可以氧化超过150摩尔的甲烷。系统在多个循环中保持其催化活性，表明高稳定性甚至有可能回收利用。作者提出了一种初步的机制，涉及形成过氧复合物、过氧键的异裂和过氧氧的质子化。
