Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are key processes involved in these activations. These principles are applied industrially in the selective oxidation of alkanes. A specific application is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the catalyst's ability to activate and selectively oxidize the alkane is demonstrated.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中对于异相催化中的C-H键活化起着关键作用。Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽象是这些激活过程中的核心过程。这些原理在工业上应用于烷烃的选择性氧化。一个具体的应用是在但烯转化为马来酸酐中，催化剂能够活化并选择性地氧化烷烃的能力得到了体现。
