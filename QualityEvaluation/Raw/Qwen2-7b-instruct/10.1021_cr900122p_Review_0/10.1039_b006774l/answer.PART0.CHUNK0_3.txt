Industrial heterogeneous catalysis often employs isolated metal centers on oxide materials to activate C-H bonds in alkanes. These centers can facilitate activation through mechanisms such as metal-induced hydrogen abstraction or the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway, where the metal acts as a Lewis acid to abstract a hydrogen atom from the alkane, creating a carbocation intermediate. This activated state allows for subsequent chemical transformations, such as functional group introductions or bond cleavages.

In the context of converting butane to maleic anhydride, the metal center (like aluminum) catalyzes the dehydrogenation of butane, leading to the formation of propene. This process is an example of acid-base catalysis, where the metal center acts as an acid to abstract a hydrogen atom from the alkane, and the oxygen atom acts as a base to accept the hydrogen atom, forming a propene molecule. The resulting propene then undergoes further reactions under the influence of the metal center to produce maleic anhydride.

Answering the specific question about the role of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, it can be stated that these centers enable the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from alkanes through mechanisms like metal-induced hydrogen abstraction or the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway. These principles are applied in industrial processes such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the metal center acts as a catalyst to drive the dehydrogenation reaction and subsequent transformation steps.

工业异相催化经常利用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心来活化烷烃中的C-H键。这些中心可以通过诸如金属诱导氢解离或马氏-范-克里夫恩途径等机制来实现激活作用，其中金属作为路易斯酸作用于烷烃，从烷烃中提取一个氢原子，形成碳正离子中间体。这种激活状态允许后续的化学转化，如功能基引入或键断裂。

以将丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例，金属中心（如铝）催化丁烷脱氢，产生丙烯。这个过程是一个酸碱催化的例子，在这里，金属中心作为酸作用于烷烃，氧原子作为碱接受氢原子，形成丙烯分子。随后，通过金属中心的影响，产生的丙烯进行进一步反应生成马来酸酐。

对于特定问题关于孤立金属中心在异相催化中活化C-H键的作用，可以指出，这些中心能够通过金属诱导氢解离或马氏-范-克里夫恩途径等机制，使烷烃中的氢原子被提取。这些原理应用于工业过程，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，其中金属中心作为催化剂驱动脱氢反应和后续的转化步骤。
