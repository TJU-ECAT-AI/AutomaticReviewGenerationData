[1] "Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom."
[2] "The computations on the activation of alkane CH bonds have attempted to describe the accepted mechanism and sought mostly pathways based on hydron transfer."
[3] "In the second step of the reaction on 2, the cleavage of an AlO bond is easier than the elimination of propene."
[4] "The described mechanism is relevant for the hydrogen exchange and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as aluminium, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through a mechanism involving aluminium insertion into a CH bond followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is part of a larger mechanism that has been attempted to describe through electron-correlated DFT calculations. The second step involves the cleavage of an AlO bond being easier than the elimination of propene, which is relevant for hydrogen exchange and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation.

在氧化物材料中的孤立金属中心，如铝，通过将铝插入到CH键中并随后氢迁移到氧原子上来促进C-H键活化，在异相催化作用下。这一过程是通过电子相关密度泛函理论计算来描述的一部分。第二步中，断裂AlO键比消除丙烯更容易，这与氢交换和烯烃氢化/烷烃脱氢化有关。
