[1] "Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom."
[2] "Pathway b (defined below) for chemisorption on 1 was also examined by MP2/6-31G**, to check the agreement between the two methods (as done in previous work)."
[3] "For the aluminiumalkyl pathway,eqn. (1), a primary CH bond (a) is more reactive than a secondary CH bond (b)."
[4] "The described mechanism is relevant for the hydrogen exchange and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation."
[5] "An increase in reactivity for broken lattices of zeolites or for extraframework aluminium species in steamed zeolites is predicted."

Metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through a mechanism involving aluminum insertion into a C-H bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is crucial for the conversion of alkanes into other compounds. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride exemplifies the application of this principle in industrial selective oxidation processes. The activation involves a mechanism similar to Mars-van-Krevelen and H-abstraction, where the metal center acts as a catalyst to activate the C-H bond, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes further reactions to yield the desired product. The enhanced reactivity of metal centers in altered lattice structures, such as those found in steamed zeolites, indicates their potential for increased catalytic activity in various chemical transformations.

氧化物材料上的金属中心通过铝插入到C-H键中，随后氢迁移到氧原子上这一机制，在异相催化中促进了C-H键的活化。这种过程对于将烷烃转化为其他化合物至关重要。将丁烷转化为马来酸酐是一个在工业选择性氧化过程中应用此原理的例子。该激活过程类似于马尔斯-范克雷威尔恩和氢摘取机制，其中金属中心作为催化剂活化C-H键，形成一个碳正离子中间体。然后，该中间体经历进一步反应以产生所需的产品。在蒸煮沸石等结构中金属中心活性增强的趋势表明，它们在各种化学转化中的潜在高催化活性。
