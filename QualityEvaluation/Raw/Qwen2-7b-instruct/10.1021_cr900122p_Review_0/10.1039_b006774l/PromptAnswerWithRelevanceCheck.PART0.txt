The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as aluminium, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through a mechanism involving aluminium insertion into a CH bond followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is part of a larger mechanism that has been attempted to describe through electron-correlated DFT calculations. The second step involves the cleavage of an AlO bond being easier than the elimination of propene, which is relevant for hydrogen exchange and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as aluminium, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like aluminium insertion into a C-H bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is applicable in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The aluminium centers act as Lewis acids, catalyzing the activation of alkane C-H bonds. This activation is crucial for reactions like hydrogen exchange, alkene hydrogenation, and alkane dehydrogenation, which are often described as being catalyzed by Brnsted acid centers with carbocation intermediates. Moreover, the reactivity of aluminium centers increases under conditions that disrupt the lattice structure of zeolites or expose extraframework aluminium species in steamed zeolites.

Metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through a mechanism involving aluminum insertion into a C-H bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is crucial for the conversion of alkanes into other compounds. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride exemplifies the application of this principle in industrial selective oxidation processes. The activation involves a mechanism similar to Mars-van-Krevelen and H-abstraction, where the metal center acts as a catalyst to activate the C-H bond, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes further reactions to yield the desired product. The enhanced reactivity of metal centers in altered lattice structures, such as those found in steamed zeolites, indicates their potential for increased catalytic activity in various chemical transformations.

Industrial heterogeneous catalysis often employs isolated metal centers on oxide materials to activate C-H bonds in alkanes. These centers can facilitate activation through mechanisms such as metal-induced hydrogen abstraction or the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway, where the metal acts as a Lewis acid to abstract a hydrogen atom from the alkane, creating a carbocation intermediate. This activated state allows for subsequent chemical transformations, such as functional group introductions or bond cleavages.

In the context of converting butane to maleic anhydride, the metal center (like aluminum) catalyzes the dehydrogenation of butane, leading to the formation of propene. This process is an example of acid-base catalysis, where the metal center acts as an acid to abstract a hydrogen atom from the alkane, and the oxygen atom acts as a base to accept the hydrogen atom, forming a propene molecule. The resulting propene then undergoes further reactions under the influence of the metal center to produce maleic anhydride.

Answering the specific question about the role of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, it can be stated that these centers enable the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from alkanes through mechanisms like metal-induced hydrogen abstraction or the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway. These principles are applied in industrial processes such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the metal center acts as a catalyst to drive the dehydrogenation reaction and subsequent transformation steps.

工业异相催化经常利用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心来活化烷烃中的C-H键。这些中心可以通过诸如金属诱导氢解离或马氏-范-克里夫恩途径等机制来实现激活作用，其中金属作为路易斯酸作用于烷烃，从烷烃中提取一个氢原子，形成碳正离子中间体。这种激活状态允许后续的化学转化，如功能基引入或键断裂。

以将丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例，金属中心（如铝）催化丁烷脱氢，产生丙烯。这个过程是一个酸碱催化的例子，在这里，金属中心作为酸作用于烷烃，氧原子作为碱接受氢原子，形成丙烯分子。随后，通过金属中心的影响，产生的丙烯进行进一步反应生成马来酸酐。

对于特定问题关于孤立金属中心在异相催化中活化C-H键的作用，可以指出，这些中心能够通过金属诱导氢解离或马氏-范-克里夫恩途径等机制，使烷烃中的氢原子被提取。这些原理应用于工业过程，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，其中金属中心作为催化剂驱动脱氢反应和后续的转化步骤。

1. Metal centers on oxide materials, such as aluminum hydroxide clusters, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by inserting into a C-H bond and then migrating hydrogen to an oxygen atom. This process involves mechanisms akin to Mars-van-Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied industrially in the selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

2. In the context of the aluminum hydroxide clusters discussed, the reactivity of aluminum centers varies in the order: tri- > tetra- > penta-coordinated. The clusters catalyze hydrogen exchange reactions and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation, which are typically classified as acid-base catalysis. These reactions involve the activation of alkane C-H bonds and the subsequent migration of hydrogen to an oxygen atom, facilitated by the aluminum center.

3. The computational studies showed that for the chemisorption step on the aluminumalkyl pathway, the transition structure was similar to that for hydrogen chemisorption. This involved the insertion of aluminum into a C-H bond followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This mechanism is applicable to both hydrogen exchange reactions and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation, where the aluminum center acts as a catalyst by facilitating the breaking of C-H bonds and the formation of new C-O bonds.

4. In the reaction of propane with aluminum hydroxide clusters, the reactivity order for the C-H bonds is primary > secondary. The mechanism for the chemisorption of propane on the aluminum cluster involves the insertion of aluminum into the C-H bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is consistent with the description of metal ion catalysis and differs from the typical mechanism involving alkyloxygen interaction.

5. The aluminum hydroxide clusters exhibit catalytic activity in the hydrogen exchange of saturated hydrocarbons, which is characterized as an acid-base catalysis. This activity is attributed to the ability of the aluminum centers to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds and the formation of new C-O bonds through the migration of hydrogen to an oxygen atom.

6. The potential energy barrier for hydrogen chemisorption on the aluminum hydroxide clusters was found to be similar whether the outer atoms of the cluster were frozen in place or allowed to move. This indicates that the catalytic activity of the aluminum centers is robust against structural variations within the cluster.

7. The computational studies revealed that for the elimination step of the oxygen alkyl pathway, the hydrogen is transferred to another oxygen atom, rather than being released as a molecule. This process contrasts with the hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom observed in the aluminumalkyl pathway.

8. The described mechanism for the reactions of propane with aluminum hydroxide clusters is applicable to hydrogen exchange reactions and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation. It involves the insertion of aluminum into a C-H bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom, which is a key step in the catalytic process. This mechanism is consistent with the role of metal ion catalysis in these reactions.

3. 计算研究表明，在铝基团的化学吸附步骤上，铝基团插入C-H键，随后氢迁移到氧原子的过程与氢吸附相似。这个机制适用于氢交换反应和烯烃氢化/烷烃脱氢，其中铝中心作为催化剂，通过促进C-H键的断裂和形成新的C-O键来发挥作用。

4. 在丙烷与铝氢氧化物簇的反应中，C-H键的活性顺序为一级 > 二级。化学吸附过程涉及铝插入C-H键，随后氢迁移到氧原子。这一过程符合金属离子催化作用的描述，与典型的涉及烷基氧相互作用的机制不同。

5. 铝氢氧化物簇在饱和烃的氢交换中表现出催化活性，这被归类为酸碱催化。这种活性归因于铝中心能够通过将氢迁移到氧原子来促进C-H键的断裂和形成新C-O键的作用。

6. 对铝氢氧化物簇的氢吸附潜在能量壁垒的研究表明，无论簇外原子固定不动还是允许铝原子移动，其催化活性都保持稳定。这表明铝中心的催化作用对簇内部结构的变化具有鲁棒性。

7. 计算研究揭示，在氧气烷基路径的消除步骤中，氢迁移到另一个氧原子，而不是释放为分子。这一过程与铝烷基路径中观察到的氢迁移到氧原子过程形成对比。

8. 描述的丙烷与铝氢氧化物簇反应的机制适用于氢交换反应和烯烃氢化/烷烃脱氢。这一机制涉及铝插入C-H键，随后氢迁移到氧原子的关键步骤。这一机制与金属离子催化在这些反应中的作用一致。
