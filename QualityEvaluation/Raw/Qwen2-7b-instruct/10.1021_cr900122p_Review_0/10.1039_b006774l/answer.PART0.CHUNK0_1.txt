[1] "Weak complexes of propane with 1 (3) and 2 (4) were located and two types of chemisorption products were identified, with CAl bond (5 and 6, respectively) and with CO bond (7 and 8,respectively), shown in eqns. (1) and (2)."
[2] "For the aluminiumalkyl pathway,eqn. (1), a primary CH bond (a) is more reactive than a secondary CH bond (b)."
[3] "The described mechanism is relevant for the hydrogen exchange11,19 and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation.20 These reactions have been described as catalyzed by Brnsted acid centers,with carbocations as intermediates or transition struc- tures."
[4] "An increase in reactivity for broken lattices of zeolites or for extraframework aluminium species in steamed zeolites is predicted."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials, such as aluminium, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like aluminium insertion into a C-H bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is applicable in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The aluminium centers act as Lewis acids, catalyzing the activation of alkane C-H bonds. This activation is crucial for reactions like hydrogen exchange, alkene hydrogenation, and alkane dehydrogenation, which are often described as being catalyzed by Brnsted acid centers with carbocation intermediates. Moreover, the reactivity of aluminium centers increases under conditions that disrupt the lattice structure of zeolites or expose extraframework aluminium species in steamed zeolites.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料中，如铝，通过将铝插入C-H键并随后氢迁移到氧原子来促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。这个过程适用于工业中选择性氧化烷烃，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。这些铝中心作为Lewis酸，催化烷烃C-H键的活化。这一激活对于氢交换、烯烃氢化和烷烃脱氢等反应至关重要，这些反应通常被描述为由Brnsted酸中心催化，中间体或过渡态包含碳正离子。此外，在破坏沸石晶体结构或在蒸煮沸石中暴露额外框架铝物种的情况下，铝中心的反应活性会增加。
