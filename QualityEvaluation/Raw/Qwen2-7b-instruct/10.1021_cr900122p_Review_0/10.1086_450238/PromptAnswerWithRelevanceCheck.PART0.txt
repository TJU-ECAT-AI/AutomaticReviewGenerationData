[1] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a critical role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "The mechanism often involves the Mars van Krevelen process, where the metal center acts as a Lewis acid, abstracting a proton from the C-H bond."
[3] "Another mechanism is H-abstraction, which occurs when the metal center donates a hydrogen atom to the substrate, leading to bond cleavage."
[4] "These principles are widely applied in industrial processes, including the selective oxidation of alkanes."
[5] "A specific example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the isolated metal center on the oxide catalyst activates the C-H bonds, allowing for selective oxidation."
