C−H Bond Activation and Organometallic Intermediates on Isolated Metal Centers on Oxide Surfaces

SPECIAL ISSUE
This article is part of the 2010 Selected Functionalization of CH Bonds special issue.
Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The selective activation and transformation of alkanes or aromatics have been a research goal for several decades. (1-3) Today, research in this area is strongly motivated by the need to optimize resources and to shorten the number of steps, hence the direct and selective transformation of petrochemicals into valuable products is therefore of major interest. Any of these processes will have first to rely on the selective C−H bond activation. This has been the holy grail in molecular organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis for some years; (1, 4, 5) several success stories have appeared in the past ten years, (6-9) including progress in the direct catalytic functionalization of methane into methanol. (10-13) However, finding stable catalytic systems using acceptable operating conditions remains a challenge. In heterogeneous catalysis, several large scale industrial processes are based on the selective C−H bond activation of alkanes and lead to the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step, for instance the direct oxidation of butane into maleic anhydride, (14-16) the dehydrogenation of propane into propene, (17, 18) or the direct transformation of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) into aromatics. (19-24)
C−H bond activation is in fact a ubiquitous process in heterogeneous catalysis. It involves various types of mechanisms and intermediates. C−H bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years. Here, we will focus on processes involving C−H bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates. The review is divided into two main sections focusing on the C−H bond activation on oxide materials and related systems (section ) and on well-defined organometallic complexes supported on oxide materials (section ). Section is subdivided into four parts describing C−H bond activation on bulk oxides, bulk metal halides, supported transition-metal oxides, and metal-exchange zeolites.

Stoichiometric C−H Bond Activation and H/D Exchange Processes
H/D exchange processes in D2/alkane and CH4/CD4 mixtures are catalyzed by various metal oxides (MxOy), and in most cases they take place via C−H bond activation and formation of a metal-alkyl intermediate (Scheme 1a). A comprehensive study of the reactivity of oxides in H/D exchange processes shows that oxide materials can be divided into four main categories: (36, 37) those with (1) no activity: Nb2O5, MoO3, SiO2, SnO2, Tb4O7, WO3, and Y2O3, (2) low activity: CeO2, Fe2O3, Mn2O3, and TiO2, (3) moderate activity: Al2O3, CaO, Gd2O3, La2O3, MgO, Nd2O3, Pr6O11, Sm2O3, Yb2O3, and ZrO2, and (4) higher activity: Cr2O3, Ga2O3, and ZnO. Note that this trend is similar to what has been observed for the activity of these oxides in hydrogenation (38-41) or in the H/D exchange reaction of a H2/D2 mixture (Scheme 1b). (42) This probably indicates that the active sites are likely the same in all these cases. Additionally, the primary product of the reaction of D2 and CH4 is CH3D, which is in agreement with a stepwise incorporation of deuterium. (37, 43) Note that the activity in H/D exchange reactions of these oxides can be related to neither the Lewis acidity nor the Lewis basicity of the oxide materials.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. (a) Formation of Metal−Alkyl Intermediates by C−H Bond Activation on M−OS, with OS Designating the O Atoms of the Oxide Surface and (b) Related Activation of H2
In particular, H/D exchange and C−H bond activation processes have been extensively studied on alumina in the past 40 years. (44-60) All these studies agree that H/D exchange takes place (1) on a small amount of surface sites (defect sites), ca. 0.02−0.04/nm2 (to be compared with an OH density of 4 OH/nm2 after dehydroxylation at 500 °C), which are formed upon thermal treatments above 400 °C, and (2) via the heterolytic splitting of the C−H bond on highly reactive Al−O surface sites (σ-bond metathesis or ambiphilic C−H activation). (61) The most recent study combining experiment (titration, IR, and solid state NMR) and theory showed that, in the case of methane, C−H bond activation occurs on AlIII sites, the most unsaturated and reactive Al sites, and generates surface AlSOH and AlIV−CH3 species (Scheme 2). (60) It has also been proposed that other alkanes should react in similar ways with these sites and could be further converted into alkenes. (62) Similarly to CH4, H2 reacts with the same AlIIIO sites but also with the less reactive AlIVO sites. (60)

Scheme 2. Heterolytic Splitting of H-X on Al−OS Sites (Defect Sites): (a) X = CH3 and (b) X = H (S = surface) and x = 0 or 1. (c) σ-bond Metathesis Transition State
It is probable that C−H bond activation on other oxides takes place via similar processes and involves organometallic intermediates. This includes aluminosilicates, whether amorphous or crystalline (zeolites), (59, 63) which display analogous reactivity toward H2 and alkanes. In fact, similar activation energies for the H/D exchange process were also measured. It is therefore likely that H/D exchange processes take place via heterolytic splitting of C−H and H−H bonds on highly reactive Al sites, a process involving lower activation barriers (50−80 kJ/mol) than those involving carbonium or carbenium ions (typically Ea of 120−150 kJ/mol).
Finally, the C−H bond activation of alkyl fragments can also occur during the chemisorption of organometallic compounds on alumina (grafting). While grafting typically takes place via reaction of the surface hydroxyls with the reactive M−C bond, (64-67) in the particular case of MeReO3, it was shown that grafting occurred via either coordination of the oxo ligand on Lewis acid sites or C−H bond activation of the methyl group on defect sites. (68-70) This yields [CH3ReO3 → AlS] and [AlSCH2ReO3] as the major and the minor surface species, respectively (Scheme 3a). In view of the high activity of this system in alkene metathesis and labeling experiments, (68, 69, 71, 72) it was also shown that the μ-methylidene species [AlSCH2ReO3] correspond to the active sites of the catalyst (Scheme 3b). It is noteworthy that other supports such as nobia, (73) silica−alumina, (71) and zeolite (74) can be used to activate CH3ReO3, and one could propose that similar active species are formed on these supports via C−H bond activation of the methyl group on reactive M−OS sites. Finally, C−H bond activation processes yielding μ-methylidene surface species have also been proposed to explain the formation of minor species in the chemisorption of Cp2M(CH3)2 on highly dehydroxylated alumina (Scheme 3c, M = U and Th). (66, 75, 76)

Alkane Dehydrogenation on Metal Oxides
In alkane dehydrogenation, one possible reaction pathway involved the formation of a metal−alkyl intermediate, which undergoes β-H elimination and generates an alkene. Of various oxides, Ga2O3, whether supported or not, catalytically dehydrogenates alkanes such as ethane and propane into the corresponding alkenes in the absence of O2, (77-81) a reactivity closely related to what is observed with Ga-exchange zeolites (vide infra section ). Note that Cr2O3 or Fe2O3 display a much lower activity and that Al2O3 and SiO2 are almost inactive for this reaction. (82, 83) This order of reactivity parallels again this observed for H/D exchange reactions (vide supra). Moreover, it has been shown that cofeeding CO2 typically increases both the activity and the stability of these nonoxidative dehydrogenation catalysts; possibly because CO2 plays the role of a mild oxidant and prevents coke formation. (80, 81, 84, 85) A detailed mechanistic investigation of the dehydrogenation process by periodic DFT calculations shows that the C−H bond activation can take place via either heterolytic splitting on highly reactive Ga−OS or H-abstraction on a reactive OS site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl, with the latter process being slightly favored (Scheme 4). (86) Both pathways can converge toward Ga−alkyl intermediates, which were observed experimentally, (87) but the radical mechanism can also yield Ga−alkoxy species. Calculations also show that all these intermediates, i.e. the adsorbed alkyl radical and the Ga−alkyl and the Ga−alkoxy species, can readily yield propene via further H-transfer: (i) from the radical intermediate [a subsequent H-transfer by another OS atom, yielding propene and a reduced Ga-center, is preferred over the formation of Ga−H], (ii) from the alkoxy species [H-transfer to an adjacent surface oxygen with a concomitant reduction of Ga is also favored compared to H-transfer to a surface Ga leading to Ga−H (not shown), but the most favored pathway is the cleavage of the O−C bond and the formation of the radical], and (iii) from the alkyl species [β-H transfer forming Ga−H and propene is also disfavored compared to H-transfer to adjacent O atoms].
Scheme 4
Scheme 4. Possible Mechanisms of Alkane Dehydrogenation on Ga2O3: (a) Formation of Alkenes; (b) Formation of H2
The most likely mechanism for propane dehydrogenation into propene on Ga2O3 takes place via H-transfer on O sites and a concomitant reduction of surface Ga-centers. As already pointed out, metal−alkyl intermediates have been observed (87) but could only correspond to dormant species of the overall catalytic cycle. The thus-generated alkyl radical generates via H-transfer the alkene and GaIII−H. This intermediate can then decompose into H2 to regenerate the initial surface sites (GaIII). However, H-transfer can also lead to the formation of strongly adsorbed H2O: this process is easier than the formation of H2, even if overall H2 formation is easier than that of gaseous H2O. Note that the competitive formation/desorption of H2O leads to a modification of the reduction of Ga sites (GaI). This would explain the fast deactivation of Ga2O3 as well as the beneficial effect of added H2O (88) and CO2, with the former inducing H2 desorption and the latter reoxidation of Ga centers. (80, 81, 84, 85) Note that the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3 (compared to those of Al2O3 and SiO2 for instance) could be related to the ease of formation of reduced surface species, i.e. GaI. While the dehydrogenation of alkanes on Ga2O3 is promising, rapid deactivation is still a major problem. Improved stabilities have been obtained by using solid solution in alumina (83) or by using supported systems. (88, 89)
Oxidative Dehydrogenation and Selective Oxidation of Alkanes
All selective oxidations of alkanes start by C−H bond activation, which is often the rate-limiting step, and this key step is usually an H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates, which are further transformed into the products via multiple steps, and no evidence for metal−alkyl intermediates has been found. It typically involves the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen. This area has been comprehensively reviewed, (14-17, 90-92) and only a few examples will be discussed thereafter, mainly to illustrate the current possible mechanisms involved in the C−H bond activation step.
The direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen has been a great challenge for decades. Note that high selectivities are usually achieved for very specific substrates, which yield very stable products, e.g. propane → acrylic acid, butane → maleic anhydride, xylene → phtalic anhydride.... The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process. (14, 93) One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride. Butane oxidation into maleic anhydride corresponds to a 14-electron oxidation process and involves several key stages: formation of butenes, then butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then subsequently converted into maleic anhydride (Scheme 5a). (90, 94) While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the C−H bond activation of butane. The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIV−O species (Scheme 5b), (95, 96) which is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2 (the Mars van Krevelen mechanism). Alternative mechanisms have been proposed, such as the H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, which leads to strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene via Brönsted acid catalysis.
