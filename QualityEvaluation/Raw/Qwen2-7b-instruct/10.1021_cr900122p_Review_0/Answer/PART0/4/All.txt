This process often follows the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, where a metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from a C-H bond, creating a carbocation intermediate. The Ga and Zn species in the zeolite catalysts act as these active sites, enabling the selective oxidation of alkanes.\n\n         In the context of converting butane to maleic anhydride, the Ga and Zn centers play a crucial role in the selective oxidation of butane. By facilitating the activation of C-H bonds in butane, these metal centers enable the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride with high efficiency. The metal centers help in the selective oxidation process by providing sites for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of carbocation intermediates that can then undergo further reactions to produce maleic anhydride.\n\n         Ga and Zn species increase the rate of chemical conversion and the overall efficiency of the conversion process by providing active sites for the reactions to occur. This is achieved through their ability to activate C-H bonds, which is essential for the selective oxidation of alkanes like butane to produce maleic anhydride. The enhanced activation of C-H bonds by Ga and Zn leads to faster and more efficient conversion of the alkane to the desired product, maleic anhydride.\n\n         The presence of Ga and Zn in the zeolite catalysts does not decrease the density of acid sites but rather displaces protons by oxidized Ga complexes, facilitating the activation of C-H bonds. This displacement of protons creates a more active environment for the oxidation reactions, further enhancing the catalytic activity of the system.\n\n         The recombination of hydrogen atoms on the surface of the catalyst, catalyzed by the Ga and Zn centers, plays a critical role in the overall process. This recombination leads to the formation of dihydrogen (H2), which can be utilized in the production of valuable chemical products, such as maleic anhydride, in industrial applications.", "Chinese": "孤立的金属中心，特别是镓（Ga）和锌（Zn），通过提供从C-H键中抽象或插入氢原子的活性位点，在异相催化中促进C-H键活化。这一过程通常遵循马尔斯-范-克雷维尔机制，其中金属中心从C-H键中抽取氢原子，形成一个碳正离子中间体。Ga和Zn物种在沸石催化剂中作为这些活性位点，使烷烃的选择性氧化成为可能。\n\n         以将丁烷转化为马来酸酐为例，在这种情况下，Ga和Zn中心在选择性氧化丁烷中起着关键作用。通过激活丁烷中的C-H键，这些金属中心能够高效地将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。金属中心通过提供氢提取位点，使丁烷的选择性氧化成为可能。\n\n         Ga和Zn物种通过提供活性位点来加速化学转化和转化过程的整体效率，从而促进反应的发生。这是通过它们激活C-H键的能力实现的，这对于将烷烃如丁烷选择性转化为马来酸酐至关重要。Ga和Zn通过增强C-H键的激活速率加速了烷烃向目标产物马来酸酐的转化过程。\n\n         镉和锌的存在并没有减少酸位点的密度，而是通过氧化Ga复合物置换质子，促进C-H键的激活。这种质子的置换在催化体系中创造了更活跃的环境，进一步增强了催化活性。\n\n         催化表面的氢原子再组合，由Ga和Zn中心催化，对整个过程至关重要。这种再组合导致了二氢（H2）的形成，这是一种可以在工业应用中用于生产有价值化学产品的副产品，如马来酸酐。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00028-4"},
