"Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products."
         "Ga species increase the rate of propane conversion to propene."
         "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."
         "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity."
