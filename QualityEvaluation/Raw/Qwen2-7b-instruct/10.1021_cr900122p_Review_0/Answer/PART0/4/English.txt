The isolated metal centers, particularly gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn), facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing active sites for hydrogen abstraction or insertion reactions. This process often follows the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, where a metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from a C-H bond, creating a carbocation intermediate. The Ga and Zn species in the zeolite catalysts act as these active sites, enabling the selective oxidation of alkanes.

         In the context of converting butane to maleic anhydride, the Ga and Zn centers play a crucial role in the selective oxidation of butane. By facilitating the activation of C-H bonds in butane, these metal centers enable the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride with high efficiency. The metal centers help in the selective oxidation process by providing sites for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of carbocation intermediates that can then undergo further reactions to produce maleic anhydride.

         Ga and Zn species increase the rate of chemical conversion and the overall efficiency of the conversion process by providing active sites for the reactions to occur. This is achieved through their ability to activate C-H bonds, which is essential for the selective oxidation of alkanes like butane to produce maleic anhydride. The enhanced activation of C-H bonds by Ga and Zn leads to faster and more efficient conversion of the alkane to the desired product, maleic anhydride.

         The presence of Ga and Zn in the zeolite catalysts does not decrease the density of acid sites but rather displaces protons by oxidized Ga complexes, facilitating the activation of C-H bonds. This displacement of protons creates a more active environment for the oxidation reactions, further enhancing the catalytic activity of the system.

         The recombination of hydrogen atoms on the surface of the catalyst, catalyzed by the Ga and Zn centers, plays a critical role in the overall process. This recombination leads to the formation of dihydrogen (H2), which can be utilized in the production of valuable chemical products, such as maleic anhydride, in industrial applications.
