          [4] "These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation processes, such as the conversion of alkanes, where the goal is to selectively oxidize specific functional groups while minimizing unwanted side reactions."
          [5] "For instance, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the isolated metal centers on the oxide material enable the selective oxidation of the alkane, with the formation of maleic anhydride as the desired product."

          [2] "Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of electrons between reactants and catalysts."
          [3] "H-abstraction mechanism involves the removal of hydrogen atoms from the substrate."
          [4] "These principles are widely applied in industrial selective oxidation processes."
          [5] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example of such industrial application."

[1] "The mechanism involves a series of steps that includes the formation of an active species, which then undergoes a reaction with the alkene substrate."
          [2] "Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism plays a critical role in the process of C-H bond activation."
          [3] "In the context of heterogeneous catalysis, isolated metal centers on oxide materials serve as the active sites for the activation of C-H bonds."
          [4] "This principle has been applied in various industries, including the selective oxidation of alkanes."
          [5] "A specific example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the catalyst facilitates the desired reaction pathway."
