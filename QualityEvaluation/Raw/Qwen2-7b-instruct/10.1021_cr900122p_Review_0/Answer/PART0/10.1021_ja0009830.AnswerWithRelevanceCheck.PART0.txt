          The isolated metal centers on oxide materials in heterogeneous catalysis facilitate C-H bond activation through a series of steps that form an active species which reacts with the alkene substrate. The Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism is crucial in this process. In industries such as selective oxidation of alkanes, these isolated metal centers act as active sites for C-H bond activation. A practical application of this principle is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the catalyst directs the reaction towards the desired product.
