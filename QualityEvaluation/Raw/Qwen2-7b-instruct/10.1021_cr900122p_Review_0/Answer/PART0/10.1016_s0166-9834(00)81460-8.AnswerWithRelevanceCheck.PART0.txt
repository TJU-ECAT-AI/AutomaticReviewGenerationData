          [1] "When evacuated at 600C. alumina was found to be most active followed by magnesia while silica and titanium oxide were totally inactive at any temperatures up to 600C."
          [2] "The catalytic exchange of hydrogen between methane molecules, between methane and hydrogen and between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalyst has been studied on various oxide catalysts by several investigators Cl-31."
          [3] "The C-H bond has to be broken in order for methane to exchange its hydrogen."
          [4] "As proposed by Larson and Hall [l], methane will dissociatively adsorb on a pair of sites consisting of exposed aluminum and @- ions (dual acid-base sites) to form Al-CH, and OH groups."
          [5] "The exchange of surface hydroxyl groups was also studied and the involvement of the surface hydroxyl groups in the CD,-CH,exchange reaction was discussed."
          [6] "However, this mechanism is unlikely since it requires a second order reaction with respect to methane."
          [7] "A similar argument may be made for magnesia."
          [8] "The number of active sites on magnesia is also small, 7.3 x 1012 sites/es,and the rate of the exchange of hydroxyl groups seems too slow for the full involvement in the equilibration reaction as described earlier."

          The isolated metal centers on oxide materials, particularly aluminum and oxygen ions, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction. These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, for example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion is not provided in the document. The exchange of hydrogen between methane molecules, methane and hydrogen, and methane and the surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts has been studied on various oxide catalysts. The exchange reaction between methane and the surface hydroxyl groups is also discussed. The exchange reaction is unlikely to occur through a direct exchange between CD and OH groups due to the requirement of a second-order reaction with respect to methane. For magnesia, the number of active sites is small, and the rate of the exchange of hydroxyl groups is too slow for full involvement in the equilibration reaction as described earlier.

          在氧化物材料中，特别是铝和氧离子，通过Mars van Krevelen机制和H-抽象等机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。这些原理应用于工业中烷烃的选择性氧化，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。但是，丁烷到马来酸酐转换的具体例子未在文档中提供。已经研究了甲烷与各种氧化物催化剂之间的氢交换、甲烷分子之间以及甲烷和催化剂表面羟基团之间的氢交换。还讨论了甲烷与表面羟基团之间的交换反应。氢交换不大可能通过CD和OH组间的直接交换发生，因为这需要甲烷的二级反应。对于镁，活性位点的数量很小，并且羟基的交换速率太慢，无法充分参与描述的平衡反应。

          The C-H bond in methane must be broken for hydrogen exchange to occur. Methane will dissociatively adsorb on a pair of sites consisting of exposed aluminum and @- ions (dual acid-base sites) to form Al-CH, and OH groups. The equilibration reaction of methane on alumina does not involve the hydroxyl groups of the catalyst, or the number of hydroxyl groups associated with the active sites is extremely small.

          为了发生氢交换，甲烷的C-H键必须断裂。甲烷将在暴露的铝和@-离子（双酸碱位点）组成的对上离解吸附，形成Al-CH和OH基团。甲烷在氧化铝上的平衡反应不涉及催化剂的羟基组分，或者与活性位点关联的羟基组分数量极小。
