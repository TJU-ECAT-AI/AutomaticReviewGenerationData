"Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products."
         "The introduction of Ga and Zn species to H-ZSM5 does not decrease the density of acid sites at reaction conditions, but leads to a displacement of protons by oxidized Ga complexes near room temperature."
