These effects are even observed when catalyst precursors consist of Ga203/H-ZSM5 physical mixtures [17,19- 21,23,36] or of gallosilicates containing Ga species within framework positions in the pen- tasil structure [56-58].\n\n         Ga species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).\n\n         The introduction of Ga and Zn species to H-ZSM5 does not decrease the density of acid sites at reaction conditions, but leads to a displacement of protons by oxidized Ga complexes near room temperature.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00028-4"},
