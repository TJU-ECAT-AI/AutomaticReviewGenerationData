          Among eleven kinds of aluminas, alumina V prepared from aluminium sulfate with urea exhibited a pronounced activity for the isomerization of 1-butene, while alumina III or II prepared from aluminium nitrate with ammonia or urea showed the highest activities for the exchange reactions between ethylene or cyclopropane and deuterium, respectively.

          Aluminas with different preparation methods exhibit varying activities in chemical reactions. Alumina V, prepared from aluminium sulfate with urea, shows high activity in the isomerization of 1-butene. Meanwhile, alumina III or II, prepared from aluminium nitrate with ammonia or urea, demonstrates the highest activities for hydrogen exchanges between ethylene or cyclopropane and deuterium.

          Different types of aluminas have distinct roles in chemical reactions. Alumina V, created from aluminium sulfate with urea, is highly effective in the isomerization of 1-butene. In contrast, alumina III or II, produced from aluminium nitrate with ammonia or urea, excels in hydrogen exchanges between ethylene or cyclopropane and deuterium.
