          Industrial catalysts, particularly chromium oxide catalysts supported on alumina, play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce propene and isobutene. Advanced spectroscopic tools allow researchers to gain insights into the dehydrogenation sites on these catalyst surfaces. Through in situ spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, it is possible to monitor the transformation of surface chromium species during alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, these studies have revealed that surface chromium hexavalent species (Cr6) are reduced to trivalent species (Cr3) under reaction conditions, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The formation of pseudo-octahedral Cr3 species indicates the presence of coordinatively unsaturated sites, which are essential for C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis.

          工业催化剂，尤其是铝氧化物支持的铬氧化物，对于烷烃脱氢产生丙烯和异丁烯具有重要作用。高级光谱技术允许研究者获得关于这些催化剂表面脱氢化位点的详细信息。通过原位光谱技术，如拉曼光谱和反射光谱，可以在烷烃脱氢反应过程中监测表面铬物种的变化。具体而言，研究表明，表面六价铬物种（Cr6）在反应条件下被还原为三价物种（Cr3），促进脱氢过程。形成伪八面体Cr3物种表明存在未配位位点，这对于均相催化中的C-H键活化至关重要。

          [1] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes."
          [2] "Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective."
          [3] "Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke."
          [4] "As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions."
          [5] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke, the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."

          The dehydrogenation of alkanes facilitates C-H bond activation through the creation of isolated metal centers on oxide materials. In heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen process and H-abstraction play crucial roles in C-H bond activation. These processes involve the transfer of electrons from a metal center to a C-H bond, leading to the cleavage of the bond. In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied by designing catalysts with specific structures that allow for efficient activation of the desired C-H bonds while avoiding unwanted side reactions. For example, in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the catalyst is engineered to promote the desired oxidative cleavage of the butane molecule into maleic anhydride, while minimizing the formation of other products.

          烷烃脱氢通过在氧化物材料上形成孤立金属中心来促进C-H键活化。在异相催化中，Mars-van Krevelen过程和H摘取等机制在C-H键活化过程中起着关键作用。这些过程涉及从金属中心向C-H键转移电子，导致键的断裂。在工业选择性氧化烷烃的应用中，通过设计具有特定结构的催化剂，可以有效地激活所需的C-H键，同时避免其他副反应。例如，在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，催化剂被设计成促进丁烷分子的预期氧化断裂成马来酸酐，同时尽量减少其他产品的生成。

          [1] "In conclusion, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species under reaction conditions."
          [2] "The industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions strongly affects their physicochemical structure, and ultimately leads to catalyst deactivation."
          [3] "Similar results were obtained by De Rossi et al. [45]. These authors observed that the extent of reduction (as determined from the amount of H2 or CO consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts) decreases with increasing number of reduction-dehydrogenation recalcination cycles."
          [4] "This decrease has been attributed to an incomplete reoxidation of reduced Cr3 species."

          To summarize, the isolation of metal centers on oxide materials enables efficient C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen process and H-abstraction. In industrial applications, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, these principles are harnessed by designing catalysts that maintain the appropriate metal oxidation states and optimize the balance between active Cr6 and Cr3 species to achieve high activity and selectivity.
