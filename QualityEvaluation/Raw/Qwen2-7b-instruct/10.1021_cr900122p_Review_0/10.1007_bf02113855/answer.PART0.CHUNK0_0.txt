[1] "Dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene occurs over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 under non-oxidizing conditions."
[2] "Following an initial induction period,during which CH4 reactant reduces the original Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C and deposition of coke occurs, a benzene selectivity of,,, 70% at a CH4 conversion of 8-10% could be sustained for more than 16 h."
[3] "The reduced Mo is highly dispersed in the channels of the zeolite."
[4] "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product."
[5] "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."

The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene is facilitated by isolated metal centers, specifically molybdenum (Mo) centers, on the oxide material ZSM-5. The process involves the reduction of Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite structure to Mo2C upon contact with methane (CH4) reactant. This reduction creates active sites on the Mo2C for the activation of CH4, leading to the formation of ethylene (C2H4) as the primary product. Subsequent oligomerization reactions of ethylene on acidic sites of the zeolite produce aromatic products, including benzene. The dispersed Mo2C sites are crucial for the initial activation of CH4 and the subsequent conversion to ethylene. Ethylene then undergoes further reactions on acidic sites to yield the observed aromatic products. The mechanism involves a series of steps including the reduction of Mo to Mo2C, activation of CH4 on these sites, formation of ethylene, and oligomerization reactions leading to the formation of aromatic compounds.

在氧化物材料ZSM-5上，孤立的金属中心，特别是钼（Mo）中心，促进了甲烷的脱氢芳构化至苯。这一过程涉及在与甲烷（CH4）反应物接触时将钼6+离子还原为Mo2C，这会在钼2C上创建活性位点以激活CH4。随后形成乙烷（C2H4）作为主要产物。乙烷在沸石中的酸性位点上的进一步聚合反应产生芳香化合物，包括苯。分散的Mo2C位点对于CH4的初始激活和随后转化为乙烷至关重要。乙烷然后在酸性位点上进行进一步反应以生成观察到的芳香化合物。这一机制涉及一系列步骤，包括Mo还原为Mo2C、在这些位点上激活CH4、形成乙烷以及在沸石中酸性位点上的进一步聚合反应，最终形成芳香化合物。
