[1] "Several recent studies have demonstrated that methane can be selectively converted into benzene and other aromatic products over various metal oxides and metal-containing zeolite catalysts [ 1-6]."
[2] "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product."
[3] "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."
[4] "Conversion of C2H4 reactant over Mo/ZSM-5 at 700 results in a hydrocarbon product distribution (excluding the CH4 that is formed) and overall catalytic behavior that is very similar to that observed with cn 4 reactant, including the occurrence of the initial activation period."
[5] "The solid data points in fig. 1 show typical results obtained for the reaction of CH4 over the 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 and a space velocity of 800 h -1."
[6] "XPS spectra obtained in the Mo 3d region following various treatments designed to simulate those in the catalytic reaction experiments are presented in fig. 3."
[7] "Disappearance of the original Mo 6+ was virtually complete after exposure of the calcined catalyst to CH4 for 2 h, which corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period that is observed during the catalytic reaction (fig. 1)."
[8] "When a partial pressure of 80 Torr of CO2 was temporarily added to the CH4 feed over the 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 after having attained steady-state conditions, an immediate cessation of benzene production (and of all CH4 conversion) occurred, as shown in fig. 4."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. In the context of the provided literature, molybdenum centers on the ZSM-5 zeolite are responsible for the initial activation of methane (CH4) to form ethylene (C2H4) as the primary product. The process involves the reduction of molybdenum from the +6 oxidation state to Mo2C sites within the zeolite channels. Subsequent reactions of ethylene on acidic sites of the zeolite lead to the formation of aromatic products. This mechanism applies to the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where butane is activated on the catalyst surface, followed by the formation of propene and hydrogen, which then undergo further reactions to produce maleic anhydride.

In the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through the Mars van Krevelen pathway, which involves the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from alkane molecules by metal-bound hydrogen atoms. This process allows for the cleavage of C-H bonds, enabling the formation of reactive intermediates that can undergo further transformations. In the case of the provided literature, molybdenum centers on the ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst are responsible for activating methane to form ethylene, which then undergoes subsequent reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite to produce aromatic compounds. This demonstrates the application of the Mars van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction in the selective oxidation of alkanes to form specific products, such as maleic anhydride.

在异相催化中，孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen途径和H-摘取机制促进C-H键活化。在提供的文献中，钼中心在ZSM-5沸石催化剂上的作用是甲烷（CH4）的初始激活形成乙烷（C2H4）作为主要产物。这一过程涉及将钼从+6氧化态还原为Mo2C位点在沸石通道内。随后，乙烷在沸石上的酸性位点上进行反应形成芳香族化合物。这一机制适用于丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程，其中丁烷在催化剂表面被激活，随后形成丙烯和氢气，这些中间体进一步转化为马来酸酐。

在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen途径促进C-H键活化，该途径涉及由金属结合的氢原子摘取烷烃分子中的氢原子。这一过程允许C-H键的断裂，从而形成可以进一步转化的活性中间体。在提供的文献中，ZSM-5沸石催化剂上的钼中心负责激活甲烷形成乙烷，然后乙烷在沸石上的酸性位点上进一步反应生成芳香族化合物。这展示了在特定产品如马来酸酐合成中Mars van Krevelen途径和H-摘取机制在烷烃选择性氧化中的应用。
