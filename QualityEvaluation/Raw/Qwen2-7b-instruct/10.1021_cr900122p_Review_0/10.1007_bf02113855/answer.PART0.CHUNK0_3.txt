[1] "The present investigation was performed to obtain additional information about the dehydroaromatization of methane over a Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst. Particular emphasis was placed on determining the nature of the catalytic sites responsible for initial CH4 activation and on indentifying the reaction intermediate(s)."
[2] "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product. The latter then undergoes subsequent oligomerization reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite to form aromatic products."
[3] "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."

The conversion of methane to benzene over a molybdenum/zinc silicate catalyst (Mo/ZSM-5) involves the activation of methane on metal carbide sites within the zeolite channels, leading to the formation of ethylene as the primary product. Ethylene then undergoes subsequent reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite to form aromatic compounds, including benzene. The nature of the reaction intermediate is ethylene, which facilitates the formation of aromatic products through further oligomerization reactions.
