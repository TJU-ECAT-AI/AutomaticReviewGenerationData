2.1. "The 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by slurrying H-ZSM-5 (Conteka B.V. 5020, Si/A1 = 25) with an aqueous solution containing an appropriate concentration of ammonium paramolybdate [(NH4)6Mo7024] at 85 for 16 h, followed by drying for 4 h at 120 and calcining in air for 4 h at 500."
2.2. "Dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene occurs over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 under non-oxidizing conditions."
2.3. "Following an initial induction period, during which CH4 reactant reduces the original Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C and deposition of coke occurs, a benzene selectivity of,,, 70% at a CH4 conversion of 8-10% could be sustained for more than 16 h."
2.4. "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product."
2.5. "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."

The isolated metal centers on the oxide material, specifically molybdenum (Mo) in the Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. This process involves the reduction of Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C, which acts as an active site for the activation of methane (CH4) reactant. The activation occurs through a mechanism that might involve the Mars van Krevelen pathway or hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of ethylene (C2H4) as the primary product. The ethylene then undergoes subsequent oligomerization reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite, which are not necessarily dependent on the presence of molybdenum, to form the observed aromatic products. This application of the principles of C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis is exemplified in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the catalyst's ability to activate and rearrange alkene bonds to form functionalized products showcases the effectiveness of these mechanisms in industrial-scale processes.

孤立的金属中心在氧化材料中，特别是Mo/ZSM-5催化剂中的钼(Mo)，促进了非均相催化中的C-H键活化。这一过程涉及将Mo 6+离子在沸石中的还原为Mo2C，Mo2C作为激活甲烷(CH4)反应物的活性位点。激活过程可能涉及Mars van Krevelen途径或氢摘除机制，导致形成乙烷(C2H4)作为主要产物。随后，乙烷在沸石的酸性位点上经历进一步的多聚化反应，形成观察到的芳香族产品，这些酸性位点不一定需要钼的存在。这种C-H键活化原则在异构化催化中的应用体现在丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程中，催化剂能够激活并重新排列烯烃键以形成功能性产物，展示了这些机制在工业规模过程中的有效性。
