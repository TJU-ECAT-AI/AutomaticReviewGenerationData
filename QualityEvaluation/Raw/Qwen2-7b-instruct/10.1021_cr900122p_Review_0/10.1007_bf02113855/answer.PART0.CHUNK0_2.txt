[1] "Dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene occurs over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 under non-oxidizing conditions."
[2] "Following an initial induction period, during which CH4 reactant reduces the original Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C and deposition of coke occurs, a benzene selectivity of,,, 70% at a CH4 conversion of 8-10% could be sustained for more than 16 h."
[3] "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product. The latter then undergoes subsequent oligomerization reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite to form aromatic products."
[4] "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."

The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene happens over a 2 wt% molybdenum/zirconium-silicate catalyst at 700 degrees Celsius under non-oxidizing conditions. An initial induction period occurs, during which the methane reactant reduces the original molybdenum ions in the zeolite to molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) and coke deposition takes place. Under these conditions, a benzene selectivity of around 70% can be maintained for over 16 hours at a methane conversion rate of 8-10%. The initial activation of methane takes place on Mo2C sites, resulting in the formation of ethylene as the primary product. Subsequently, ethylene undergoes oligomerization reactions on the acidic sites of the zeolite to produce aromatic compounds.

甲烷在2 wt%钼/二氧化锆催化剂上，在700摄氏度的非氧化性条件下，通过脱氢芳构化转化为苯。存在一个初始诱导期，在此期间，甲烷反应物将原始钼离子在沸石中的还原为钼碳（Mo2C）并沉积焦炭。在这种情况下，在8-10%的甲烷转化率下，可以维持大约70%的苯选择性超过16小时。甲烷的初始激活发生在Mo2C位点上，导致形成乙烯作为主要产物。随后，乙烯在沸石的酸性位点上进行多聚化反应以生成芳香化合物。
