[1] "Dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene occurs over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 under non-oxidizing conditions."
[2] "Following an initial induction period,during which CH4 reactant reduces the original Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C and deposition of coke occurs, a benzene selectivity of,,, 70% at a CH4 conversion of 8-10% could be sustained for more than 16 h."
[3] "The reduced Mo is highly dispersed in the channels of the zeolite."
[4] "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product."
[5] "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."

The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene is facilitated by isolated metal centers, specifically molybdenum (Mo) centers, on the oxide material ZSM-5. The process involves the reduction of Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite structure to Mo2C upon contact with methane (CH4) reactant. This reduction creates active sites on the Mo2C for the activation of CH4, leading to the formation of ethylene (C2H4) as the primary product. Subsequent oligomerization reactions of ethylene on acidic sites of the zeolite produce aromatic products, including benzene. The dispersed Mo2C sites are crucial for the initial activation of CH4 and the subsequent conversion to ethylene. Ethylene then undergoes further reactions on acidic sites to yield the observed aromatic products. The mechanism involves a series of steps including the reduction of Mo to Mo2C, activation of CH4 on these sites, formation of ethylene, and oligomerization reactions leading to the formation of aromatic compounds.

在氧化物材料ZSM-5上，孤立的金属中心，特别是钼（Mo）中心，促进了甲烷的脱氢芳构化至苯。这一过程涉及在与甲烷（CH4）反应物接触时将钼6+离子还原为Mo2C，这会在钼2C上创建活性位点以激活CH4。随后形成乙烷（C2H4）作为主要产物。乙烷在沸石中的酸性位点上的进一步聚合反应产生芳香化合物，包括苯。分散的Mo2C位点对于CH4的初始激活和随后转化为乙烷至关重要。乙烷然后在酸性位点上进行进一步反应以生成观察到的芳香化合物。这一机制涉及一系列步骤，包括Mo还原为Mo2C、在这些位点上激活CH4、形成乙烷以及在沸石中酸性位点上的进一步聚合反应，最终形成芳香化合物。

The isolated metal centers on the oxide material, specifically molybdenum (Mo) in the Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. This process involves the reduction of Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C, which acts as an active site for the activation of methane (CH4) reactant. The activation occurs through a mechanism that might involve the Mars van Krevelen pathway or hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of ethylene (C2H4) as the primary product. The ethylene then undergoes subsequent oligomerization reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite, which are not necessarily dependent on the presence of molybdenum, to form the observed aromatic products. This application of the principles of C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis is exemplified in the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the catalyst's ability to activate and rearrange alkene bonds to form functionalized products showcases the effectiveness of these mechanisms in industrial-scale processes.

The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene happens over a 2 wt% molybdenum/zirconium-silicate catalyst at 700 degrees Celsius under non-oxidizing conditions. An initial induction period occurs, during which the methane reactant reduces the original molybdenum ions in the zeolite to molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) and coke deposition takes place. Under these conditions, a benzene selectivity of around 70% can be maintained for over 16 hours at a methane conversion rate of 8-10%. The initial activation of methane takes place on Mo2C sites, resulting in the formation of ethylene as the primary product. Subsequently, ethylene undergoes oligomerization reactions on the acidic sites of the zeolite to produce aromatic compounds.

甲烷在2 wt%钼/二氧化锆催化剂上，在700摄氏度的非氧化性条件下，通过脱氢芳构化转化为苯。存在一个初始诱导期，在此期间，甲烷反应物将原始钼离子在沸石中的还原为钼碳（Mo2C）并沉积焦炭。在这种情况下，在8-10%的甲烷转化率下，可以维持大约70%的苯选择性超过16小时。甲烷的初始激活发生在Mo2C位点上，导致形成乙烯作为主要产物。随后，乙烯在沸石的酸性位点上进行多聚化反应以生成芳香化合物。

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. In the context of the provided literature, molybdenum centers on the ZSM-5 zeolite are responsible for the initial activation of methane (CH4) to form ethylene (C2H4) as the primary product. The process involves the reduction of molybdenum from the +6 oxidation state to Mo2C sites within the zeolite channels. Subsequent reactions of ethylene on acidic sites of the zeolite lead to the formation of aromatic products. This mechanism applies to the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where butane is activated on the catalyst surface, followed by the formation of propene and hydrogen, which then undergo further reactions to produce maleic anhydride.

In the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through the Mars van Krevelen pathway, which involves the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from alkane molecules by metal-bound hydrogen atoms. This process allows for the cleavage of C-H bonds, enabling the formation of reactive intermediates that can undergo further transformations. In the case of the provided literature, molybdenum centers on the ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst are responsible for activating methane to form ethylene, which then undergoes subsequent reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite to produce aromatic compounds. This demonstrates the application of the Mars van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction in the selective oxidation of alkanes to form specific products, such as maleic anhydride.
