[1] "Both the transformations of pure alkanes: n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization and of alkanes in mixture with alkenes: isobutanebutene alkylation or with aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene alkylation with ethane or propane are considered."
[2] "This review paper presents the significant advances which were made in the last decade in the understanding of the transformation over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts of the cheap and readily available C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products: mechanism of activation, reaction scheme, nature of the active sites."
[3] "Isolated metal centers on oxide materials play a crucial role in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms such as the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction."
[4] "In the context of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride serves as a specific example."

The literature discusses the use of acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts for the transformation of C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products, including n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, and alkanes in mixture with alkenes undergoing isobutanebutene alkylation or benzene alkylation with ethane or propane. It also highlights the significance of isolated metal centers on oxide materials in facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, involving mechanisms such as the Mars-van-Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. The selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, is considered within the scope of industrial applications.

文献讨论了酸性和双功能沸石催化剂在将C2C4烷烃转化为更有价值的产物中的应用，包括正丁烷异构化、C2C4烷烃芳构化以及与烯烃混合的烷烃进行异丁烷丁二烯烷基化或与芳香族烃进行乙烷或丙烷烷基化。它还强调了氧化物材料中孤立金属中心在异质催化中促进C-H键活化的重要性，涉及如Mars-van-Krevelen途径和H抽象等机制。在工业选择性氧化应用的背景下，将正丁烷转化为马来酸酐作为具体例子进行了考虑。
