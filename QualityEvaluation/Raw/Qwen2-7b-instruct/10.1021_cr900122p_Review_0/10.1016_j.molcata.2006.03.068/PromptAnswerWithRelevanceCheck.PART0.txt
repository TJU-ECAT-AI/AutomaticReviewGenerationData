Industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, relies on the presence of isolated metal centers on oxide materials to activate C-H bonds. These centers enable reactions through mechanisms such as the Mars-van Krevelen pathway and H-abstraction. In the case of butane to maleic anhydride, the process involves oxidative cleavage of the C-H bonds, facilitated by the metal center. This is applied industrially by using catalysts that contain metal species capable of oxidizing butane to form maleic anhydride. The specific example demonstrates how the principles of C-H bond activation and the use of metal centers in heterogeneous catalysis are employed to convert hydrocarbon feedstocks into valuable chemical intermediates.
