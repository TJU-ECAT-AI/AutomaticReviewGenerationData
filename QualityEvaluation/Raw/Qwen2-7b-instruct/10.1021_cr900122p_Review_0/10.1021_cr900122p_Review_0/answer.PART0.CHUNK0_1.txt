[1] "The selective activation and transformation of alkanes or aromatics have been a research goal for several decades."
[2] "Any of these processes will have first to rely on the selective CH bond activation."
[3] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years."
[4] "Oxide materials can be divided into four main categories: (1) those with (1) no activity: Nb2O5, MoO3, SiO2, SnO2, Tb4O7, WO3, and Y2O3, (2) low activity: CeO2, Fe2O3, Mn2O3, and TiO2, (3) moderate activity: Al2O3, CaO, Gd2O3, La2O3, MgO, Nd2O3, Pr6O11, Sm2O3, Yb2O3, and ZrO2, and (4) higher activity: Cr2O3, Ga2O3, and ZnO."
[5] "H/D exchange processes in D2/alkane and CH4/CD4 mixtures are catalyzed by various metal oxides (MxOy), and in most cases they take place via CH bond activation and formation of a metal-alkyl intermediate (Scheme 1a)."
[6] "H/D exchange and CH bond activation processes have been extensively studied on alumina in the past 40 years."
[7] "All these studies agree that H/D exchange takes place (1) on a small amount of surface sites (defect sites), ca. 0.020.04/nm2 (to be compared with an OH density of 4 OH/nm2 after dehydroxylation at 500 C), which are formed upon thermal treatments above 400 C, and (2) via the heterolytic splitting of the CH bond on highly reactive AlO surface sites (σ-bond metathesis or ambiphilic CH activation)."
[8] "In alkane dehydrogenation, one possible reaction pathway involved the formation of a metalalkyl intermediate, which undergoes β-H elimination and generates an alkene."
[9] "Metal-alkyl intermediates have been observed (87) but could only correspond to dormant species of the overall catalytic cycle."
[10] "While the dehydrogenation of alkanes on Ga2O3 is promising, rapid deactivation is still a major problem."
[11] "One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."
[12] "The direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride corresponds to a 14-electron oxidation process and involves several key stages: formation of butenes, then butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then subsequently converted into maleic anhydride (Scheme 5a)."
[13] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane."
[14] "The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species (Scheme 5b), (95, 96) which is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2 (the Mars van Krevelen mechanism)."

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials enable C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond and H-abstraction by surface oxygen species. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the rate-limiting step is the C-H bond activation of butane.

2. In the context of C-H bond activation, metal oxides like alumina, Ga2O3, and Cr2O3 are categorized based on their activity level in H/D exchange processes. For instance, alumina activates C-H bonds on its reactive Al sites through heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond.

3. Alkane dehydrogenation on metal oxides often involves the formation of a metal-alkyl intermediate, followed by β-H elimination to generate an alkene. Ga2O3 is known for its ability to catalytically dehydrogenate alkanes like ethane and propane into corresponding alkenes.

4. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a complex 14-electron oxidation process involving multiple steps, with the activation of the C-H bonds in butane serving as the rate-determining step. The mechanism involves the concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on vanadium oxide species, followed by reoxidation of the active phase by molecular oxygen, adhering to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.

5. The effectiveness of Ga2O3 in alkane dehydrogenation is attributed to the ease of formation of reduced surface species, such as GaI. However, rapid deactivation is still a significant challenge in this process.

6. Vanadium phosphate (VPO) is noted as an effective catalyst for selective oxidation of alkanes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, showcasing its application in industrial processes for the selective oxidation of alkanes.
