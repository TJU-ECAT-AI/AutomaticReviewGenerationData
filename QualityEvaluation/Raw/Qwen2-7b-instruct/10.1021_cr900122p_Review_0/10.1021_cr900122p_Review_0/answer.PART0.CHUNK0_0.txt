[1] "Selective activation and transformation of alkanes or aromatics have been a research goal for several decades."
[2] "Today, research in this area is strongly motivated by the need to optimize resources and to shorten the number of steps, hence the direct and selective transformation of petrochemicals into valuable products is therefore of major interest."
[3] "Any of these processes will have first to rely on the selective CH bond activation."
[4] "Finding stable catalytic systems using acceptable operating conditions remains a challenge."
[5] "In heterogeneous catalysis, several large scale industrial processes are based on the selective CH bond activation of alkanes and lead to the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step."
[6] "It involves various types of mechanisms and intermediates."
[7] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years."

[10] "Stoichiometric CH Bond Activation and H/D Exchange Processes"
[11] "Formation of MetalAlkyl Intermediates by CH Bond Activation on MOS, with OS Designating the O Atoms of the Oxide Surface and (b) Related Activation of H2"
[12] "Pertinent studies agree that H/D exchange takes place (1) on a small amount of surface sites (defect sites), ca. 0.020.04/nm2 (to be compared with an OH density of 4 OH/nm2 after dehydroxylation at 500 C), which are formed upon thermal treatments above 400 C, and (2) via the heterolytic splitting of the CH bond on highly reactive AlO surface sites (σ-bond metathesis or ambiphilic CH activation)."
[13] "The most recent study combining experiment (titration, IR, and solid state NMR) and theory showed that, in the case of methane, CH bond activation occurs on AlIII sites, the most unsaturated and reactive Al sites, and generates surface AlSOH and AlIVCH3 species (Scheme 2)."
[14] "Similarly to CH4, H2 reacts with the same AlIIIO sites but also with the less reactive AlIVO sites."
[15] "Alkane Dehydrogenation on Metal Oxides"
[16] "In alkane dehydrogenation, one possible reaction pathway involved the formation of a metalalkyl intermediate, which undergoes β-H elimination and generates an alkene."
[17] "Of various oxides, Ga2O3, whether supported or not, catalytically dehydrogenates alkanes such as ethane and propane into the corresponding alkenes in the absence of O2."
[18] "A detailed mechanistic investigation of the dehydrogenation process by periodic DFT calculations shows that the CH bond activation can take place via either heterolytic splitting on highly reactive GaOS or H-abstraction on a reactive OS site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl, with the latter process being slightly favored (Scheme 4)."
[19] "The most likely mechanism for propane dehydrogenation into propene on Ga2O3 takes place via H-transfer on O sites and a concomitant reduction of surface Ga-centers."
[20] "Oxidative Dehydrogenation and Selective Oxidation of Alkanes"
[21] "All selective oxidations of alkanes start by CH bond activation, which is often the rate-limiting step, and this key step is usually an H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates, which are further transformed into the products via multiple steps, and no evidence for metalalkyl intermediates has been found."
[22] "The direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen has been a great challenge for decades."
[23] "One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."
[24] "Butane oxidation into maleic anhydride corresponds to a 14-electron oxidation process and involves several key stages: formation of butenes, then butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then subsequently converted into maleic anhydride (Scheme 5a)."
[25] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane."
[26] "The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species (Scheme 5b), (95, 96)"
[27] "Alternative mechanisms have been proposed, such as the H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, which leads to strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene via Brnsted acid catalysis."
[28] "The direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process."
[29] "One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."
[30] "Butane oxidation into maleic anhydride corresponds to a 14-electron oxidation process and involves several key stages: formation of butenes, then butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then subsequently converted into maleic anhydride (Scheme 5a)."

Answer: 

1. In heterogeneous catalysis, isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through various mechanisms, including heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond and abstraction of hydrogen by surface oxygen species. These processes enable the selective transformation of alkanes or aromatics into valuable products.

2. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a common principle in selective oxidation of alkanes, involving the oxidation of alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen. This mechanism is often rate-limiting in the activation step of the C-H bond.

3. For the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the key step involves the activation of the C-H bond, followed by the formation of butenes, butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then converted into maleic anhydride. This process relies on the use of metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium phosphate (VPO).
