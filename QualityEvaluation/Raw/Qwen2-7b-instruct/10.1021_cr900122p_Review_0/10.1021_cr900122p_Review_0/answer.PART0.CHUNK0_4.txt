[1] "Today, research in this area is strongly motivated by the need to optimize resources and to shorten the number of steps, hence the direct and selective transformation of petrochemicals into valuable products is therefore of major interest."
[2] "Any of these processes will have first to rely on the selective CH bond activation."
[3] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years."
[4] "It is probable that CH bond activation on other oxides takes place via similar processes and involves organometallic intermediates."
[5] "In alkane dehydrogenation, one possible reaction pathway involved the formation of a metalalkyl intermediate, which undergoes β-H elimination and generates an alkene."
[6] "Metalalkyl intermediates have been observed (87) but could only correspond to dormant species of the overall catalytic cycle."
[7] "One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."
[8] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane."

The selective activation of C-H bonds through isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitates heterogeneous catalysis by allowing direct and efficient transformations of petrochemicals into valuable products. This process often involves the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, which can undergo β-H elimination to generate alkenes. In industrial applications, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the rate-determining step is the activation of the C-H bond in butane. This involves a mechanism where butane is converted into 2-butenes through a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species, followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2. This showcases the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and highlights the importance of C-H bond activation in achieving high selectivity and efficiency in industrial selective oxidation processes.

通过孤立金属中心在氧化物材料上的激活，C-H键选择性活化在异相催化中促进了对石油化学品的直接和有效转化以制备有价值的产物。这一过程通常涉及形成金属-烷基中间体，其可以经历β-H消除生成烯烃。在工业应用中，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，C-H键活化的步骤是决定性步骤。这涉及到一种机制，其中丁烷被转化为2-丁烯，通过在VIVO物种上同时抽取两个氢原子完成，随后是活性相由O2的重新氧化。这展示了火星范克列文机制，并强调了在工业选择性氧化过程中实现高选择性和效率的关键作用。
