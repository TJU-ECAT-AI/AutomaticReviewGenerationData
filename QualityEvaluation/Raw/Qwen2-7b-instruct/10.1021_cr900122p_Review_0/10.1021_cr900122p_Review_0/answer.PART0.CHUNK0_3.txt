[1] "CH bond activation and organometallic intermediates on isolated metal centers on oxide surfaces have been extensively reviewed."
[2] "In heterogeneous catalysis, several large scale industrial processes are based on the selective CH bond activation of alkanes and lead to the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step."
[3] "Any of these processes will have first to rely on the selective CH bond activation."
[4] "The most common mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species."
[5] "Alternative mechanisms have been proposed, such as the H-abstraction of butane by activated O2 coordinated to VIV centers, which leads to strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene via Brnsted acid catalysis."

Heterogeneous catalysis utilizes the selective activation of C-H bonds on isolated metal centers located on oxide surfaces to facilitate chemical transformations. This process is crucial for the development of efficient catalysts that can synthesize valuable products from petrochemicals. For instance, the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride showcases the application of these principles in industry. The typical mechanism for butane oxidation involves the abstraction of two hydrogen atoms by vanadium oxide (VIVO) species, leading to the formation of 2-butenes. An alternative route suggests that butane might be abstracted by oxygen coordinated to VIV centers, resulting in the formation of strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene through Brnsted acid catalysis.

在异相催化中，通过在氧化物表面的孤立金属中心上选择性激活C-H键来促进化学转化。这一过程对于开发能够从石油化学品合成有价值产品的高效催化剂至关重要。例如，将丁烷直接转化为马来酸酐就是这些原则在工业中的应用示例。但烷氧化的典型机制涉及通过VIVO物种抽象两个氢原子形成2-丁烯。另一种途径表明，但烷可能被协调到VIV中心的氧原子抽象，导致形成强烈吸附的2-丁烯或2-丁酮，然后可以通过Brnsted酸催化转化为丁二烯。
