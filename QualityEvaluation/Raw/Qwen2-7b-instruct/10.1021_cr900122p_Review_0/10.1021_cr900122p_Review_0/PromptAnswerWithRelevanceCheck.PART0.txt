[1] "Selective activation and transformation of alkanes or aromatics have been a research goal for several decades."

[4] "Finding stable catalytic systems using acceptable operating conditions remains a challenge."
[5] "In heterogeneous catalysis, several large scale industrial processes are based on the selective CH bond activation of alkanes and lead to the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step."
[6] "It involves various types of mechanisms and intermediates."
[7] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years."

[11] "Formation of MetalAlkyl Intermediates by CH Bond Activation on MOS, with OS Designating the O Atoms of the Oxide Surface and (b) Related Activation of H2"
[12] "Pertinent studies agree that H/D exchange takes place (1) on a small amount of surface sites (defect sites), ca. 0.020.04/nm2 (to be compared with an OH density of 4 OH/nm2 after dehydroxylation at 500 C), which are formed upon thermal treatments above 400 C, and (2) via the heterolytic splitting of the CH bond on highly reactive AlO surface sites (σ-bond metathesis or ambiphilic CH activation)."
[13] "The most recent study combining experiment (titration, IR, and solid state NMR) and theory showed that, in the case of methane, CH bond activation occurs on AlIII sites, the most unsaturated and reactive Al sites, and generates surface AlSOH and AlIVCH3 species (Scheme 2)."
[14] "Similarly to CH4, H2 reacts with the same AlIIIO sites but also with the less reactive AlIVO sites."

[18] "A detailed mechanistic investigation of the dehydrogenation process by periodic DFT calculations shows that the CH bond activation can take place via either heterolytic splitting on highly reactive GaOS or H-abstraction on a reactive OS site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl, with the latter process being slightly favored (Scheme 4)."
[19] "The most likely mechanism for propane dehydrogenation into propene on Ga2O3 takes place via H-transfer on O sites and a concomitant reduction of surface Ga-centers."
[20] "Oxidative Dehydrogenation and Selective Oxidation of Alkanes"
[21] "All selective oxidations of alkanes start by CH bond activation, which is often the rate-limiting step, and this key step is usually an H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates, which are further transformed into the products via multiple steps, and no evidence for metalalkyl intermediates has been found."
[22] "The direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen has been a great challenge for decades."

Answer: 

1. In heterogeneous catalysis, isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation through various mechanisms, including heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond and abstraction of hydrogen by surface oxygen species. These processes enable the selective transformation of alkanes or aromatics into valuable products.

2. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a common principle in selective oxidation of alkanes, involving the oxidation of alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen. This mechanism is often rate-limiting in the activation step of the C-H bond.

3. For the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, the key step involves the activation of the C-H bond, followed by the formation of butenes, butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then converted into maleic anhydride. This process relies on the use of metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium phosphate (VPO).

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials enable C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through mechanisms like heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond and H-abstraction by surface oxygen species. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation of alkanes, exemplified by the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, where the rate-limiting step is the C-H bond activation of butane.

2. In the context of C-H bond activation, metal oxides like alumina, Ga2O3, and Cr2O3 are categorized based on their activity level in H/D exchange processes. For instance, alumina activates C-H bonds on its reactive Al sites through heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond.

3. Alkane dehydrogenation on metal oxides often involves the formation of a metal-alkyl intermediate, followed by β-H elimination to generate an alkene. Ga2O3 is known for its ability to catalytically dehydrogenate alkanes like ethane and propane into corresponding alkenes.

4. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a complex 14-electron oxidation process involving multiple steps, with the activation of the C-H bonds in butane serving as the rate-determining step. The mechanism involves the concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on vanadium oxide species, followed by reoxidation of the active phase by molecular oxygen, adhering to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.

5. The effectiveness of Ga2O3 in alkane dehydrogenation is attributed to the ease of formation of reduced surface species, such as GaI. However, rapid deactivation is still a significant challenge in this process.

6. Vanadium phosphate (VPO) is noted as an effective catalyst for selective oxidation of alkanes, including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, showcasing its application in industrial processes for the selective oxidation of alkanes.

Heterogeneous catalysis utilizes the selective activation of C-H bonds on isolated metal centers located on oxide surfaces to facilitate chemical transformations. This process is crucial for the development of efficient catalysts that can synthesize valuable products from petrochemicals. For instance, the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride showcases the application of these principles in industry. The typical mechanism for butane oxidation involves the abstraction of two hydrogen atoms by vanadium oxide (VIVO) species, leading to the formation of 2-butenes. An alternative route suggests that butane might be abstracted by oxygen coordinated to VIV centers, resulting in the formation of strongly adsorbed 2-butene or 2-butanone, which can then be converted into butadiene through Brnsted acid catalysis.
