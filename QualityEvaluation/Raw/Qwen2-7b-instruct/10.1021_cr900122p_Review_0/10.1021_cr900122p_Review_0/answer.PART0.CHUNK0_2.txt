[1] "Selective activation and transformation of alkanes or aromatics have been a research goal for several decades."
[2] "Any of these processes will have first to rely on the selective CH bond activation."
[3] "In heterogeneous catalysis, several large scale industrial processes are based on the selective CH bond activation of alkanes and lead to the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step."
[4] "This includes aluminosilicates, whether amorphous or crystalline (zeolites), (59, 63) which display analogous reactivity toward H2 and alkanes."
[5] "It has been shown that cofeeding CO2 typically increases both the activity and the stability of these nonoxidative dehydrogenation catalysts; possibly because CO2 plays the role of a mild oxidant and prevents coke formation."
[6] "Metal-alkyl intermediates have been observed (87) but could only correspond to dormant species of the overall catalytic cycle."
[7] "While the dehydrogenation of alkanes on Ga2O3 is promising, rapid deactivation is still a major problem."
[8] "One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."
[9] "The direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride corresponds to a 14-electron oxidation process and involves several key stages: formation of butenes, then butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then subsequently converted into maleic anhydride (Scheme 5a)."
[10] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane."

1. Isolated metal centers on oxide materials enable the selective activation and transformation of alkanes or aromatics through the catalytic activation of C-H bonds, facilitating reactions that lead to the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step.
2. Mechanisms involved in C-H bond activation on oxide materials include the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, where alkane molecules are oxidized by the metal oxide, and the reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen, and H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates.
3. Industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, employs catalytic systems like vanadium phosphate (VPO). This process involves several key stages: the formation of butenes, butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then converted into maleic anhydride.

1. 分离的金属中心在氧化物材料上能够选择性地激活和转化烷烃或芳香烃，通过催化激活C-H键，从而促进形成更有价值的和功能化的产物。
2. 在氧化物材料上的C-H键激活机制包括Mars van Krevelen机制，其中烷烃分子被金属氧化物氧化，并且通过分子氧重新氧化固体，以及表面氧物种的H抽象生成自由基中间体。
3. 在工业中，选择性氧化烷烃，如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，采用如钒磷酸盐（VPO）等催化剂系统。这一过程涉及几个关键步骤：但烯的形成，但二烯，然后是1,4-二氢呋喃，最终转化为马来酸酐。
