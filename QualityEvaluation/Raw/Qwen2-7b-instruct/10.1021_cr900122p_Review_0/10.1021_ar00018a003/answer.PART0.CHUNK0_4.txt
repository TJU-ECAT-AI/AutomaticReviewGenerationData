[1] "Unfortunately, since catalytic processes are generally quite complex, little is known about the individual steps that take place at the molecular level in such systems."
[2] "However, since that reaction often displays quite low probabilities, catalytic processes need to be performed under fairly severe prmsure and temperature conditions in order to reach reasonable conversion rates."
[3] "One way to make C-H bond breaking reactions easier under vacu- um is by using open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms, because those sites tend to display higher reactivity."
[4] "Alternatively, supersonic beams can be used to deliver gas molecules having the high energies needed for their ativation."
[5] "However, even though studies based on these ideas have yielded very exciting results, they have proven less than general for inves- tigating the surface chemistry of hydrocarbons on surfaces."
[6] "High pressures are not easy to reproduce in the vacuum environments normally used in surface science studies, and in addition, they tend to accelerate the conversion of alkyl groups into other species, making the steady- state concentration of those intermediates on the cat- alyst surface too low to be detected."
[7] "Several approaches have been taken in order to ov- ercome the difficulties mentioned above."
[8] "It is well- known that alkyl radicals can be efficiently prepared in either gas or liquid phases by activating suitable precursors such as alkyl halides, azo compounds, and peroxide."
[9] "Alkyl halides are particularly good can- didates for studies on surfaces because they are easy to prepare and to handle under vacuum and because they have already been shown to undergo oxidative addition reactions in solution to form organometallic products with alkyl ligands attached directly to the metal center."
[10] "We have shown here that alkyl halides chemisorb molecularly on transition metal surfaces at low tem- peratures and that the scission of the carbon-halogen bond can be easily activated either thermally or pho- tolytically to yield adsorbed alkyl moieties."

Industrial selective oxidation of alkanes often employs catalysts that utilize isolated metal centers on oxide materials to activate C-H bonds. These processes typically involve mechanisms like the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction pathways. For example, the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride involves oxidizing butane using a suitable catalyst to introduce functional groups selectively. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism facilitates the transfer of hydrogen atoms between molecules, enabling the activation of C-H bonds. H-abstraction involves the removal of hydrogen atoms from the alkane, leading to the formation of alkyl radicals, which can then participate in further reactions. These principles are applied industrially to produce various chemicals, including but not limited to maleic anhydride, through carefully selected catalysts and reaction conditions.

工业上选择性氧化烷烃通常使用在氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心作为催化剂来活化C-H键。这些过程通常涉及Mars van Krevelen和H抽象等机制。例如，将丁烷转化为马来酸酐涉及到使用合适的催化剂选择性地氧化丁烷以引入功能团。Mars van Krevelen机制通过分子之间的氢原子转移来促进C-H键的激活。H抽象涉及从烷烃中移除氢原子，导致烷基自由基的形成，然后参与进一步反应。这些原则被应用于工业生产各种化学品，包括但不限于马来酸酐，这需要精心选择的催化剂和反应条件。
