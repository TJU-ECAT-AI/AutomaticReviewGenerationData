[1] "High pressures are not easy to reproduce in the vacuum environments normally used in surface science studies,and in addition, they tend to accelerate the conversion of alkyl groups into other species, making the steady- state concentration of those intermediates on the cat- alyst surface too low to be detected."
[2] "One way to make C-H bond breaking reactions easier under vacu- um is by using open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms, because those sites tend to display higher reactivity."

The high pressures required for C-H bond breaking reactions are challenging to reproduce in typical surface science vacuum environments. This accelerates the conversion of alkyl groups into other species, leading to a low steady-state concentration of intermediates on the catalyst surface, making them undetectable. To address this issue, researchers have considered utilizing open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms. These sites exhibit higher reactivity, facilitating easier C-H bond breaking under vacuum conditions.

在通常的表面科学真空环境中，需要高压才能重现C-H键断裂反应。这会加速烷基团转化为其他物种，导致催化剂表面上中间体的稳态浓度过低而无法检测到。为了克服上述困难，研究者考虑使用具有低配位金属原子的开放表面。这些位置表现出更高的活性，使得在真空条件下更容易实现C-H键断裂。
