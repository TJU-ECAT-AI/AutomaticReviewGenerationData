[1] "Unfortunately, since catalytic processes are generally quite complex, little is known about the individual steps that take place at the molecular level in such systems."
[2] "The conversion of hydrocarbons in particular is at the heart of the refining of crude oil, the modification of fat in food industries, and the synthesis of pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals."
[3] "It is only recently that the advent of a variety of modern surface-sensitive instrumentation has made those studies feasible; the power of using such techniques in elucidating reaction mechanisms has been shown already in several key case."
[4] "However, since that reaction often displays quite low probabilities, catalytic processes need to be performed under fairly severe prmsure and temperature conditions in order to reach reasonable conversion rates."
[5] "High pressures are not easy to reproduce in the vacuum environments normally used in surface science studies, and in addition, they tend to accelerate the conversion of alkyl groups into other species, making the steady-state concentration of those intermediates on the cat- alyst surface too low to be detected."
[6] "One way to make C-H bond breaking reactions easier under vacu- um is by using open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms, because those sites tend to display higher reactivity."
[7] "Alternatively, supersonic beams can be used to deliver gas molecules having the high energies needed for their ativation."
[8] "Several approaches have been taken in order to ov- ercome the difficulties mentioned above."
[9] "However, even though studies based on these ideas have yielded very exciting results, they have proven less than general for inves- tigating the surface chemistry of hydrocarbons on surfaces."
[10] "Recent studies in my laboratory and a few others have shown the feasibility of yet another method for preparing chemisorbed alkyl groups, namely, by disso- Francisco Zaera was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on May 11."

The isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation by providing reactive sites for the bond-breaking process. The mechanisms involved include the Mars van Krevelen pathway, where a hydrogen atom abstracts from the C-H bond, and H-abstraction, which removes a hydrogen atom from the carbon, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical. These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation processes, such as converting butane to maleic anhydride. The conversion involves the selective oxidation of butane to produce maleic anhydride through a series of reactions facilitated by the metal catalyst. The high-pressure conditions ensure that the alkyl groups are sufficiently activated for the desired conversion to occur efficiently.

孤立的金属中心在氧化物材料上促进C-H键激活，通过提供反应性位点来实现键断裂过程。涉及的机制包括Mars van Krevelen途径，其中氢原子从C-H键中抽取，以及H抽取，从碳中移除氢原子，形成烷基自由基。这些原则在工业选择性氧化过程中得到应用，例如将丁烷转化为马来酸酐。转化涉及到通过金属催化剂促进的选择性氧化，将丁烷转化为马来酸酐，通过一系列反应实现。高压条件确保烷基团充分激活，以高效地进行所需的转化。
