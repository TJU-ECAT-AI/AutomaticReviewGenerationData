About 40 years have past since the pioneering report of the cleavage of CH bonds with transition metal complexes. Since that time, a vast number of studies of the cleavage of CH bonds, using stoichiometric amounts of transi- tion metal complexes has appeared. In the last decade, a variety of catalytic reactions involving CH bond cleavage has been reported. In this review we briefly survey the results of these research activities with respect to the catalytic use of unreac- tive CH bonds in organic synthesis. 1 Introduction 2 Catalytic CC Bond Formation via CH Bond Cleavage

If the CH bonds could be used as a functional group, similar to a carbon-halogen bond, it would become one of the most powerful, valuable, straightforward methods for producing complex molecules and for the construction of CC bond frameworks. However, the bond dissoci- ation energy of a CH bond is usually large, e.g.,105 kcal/mol for
HCH3,
and 110 kcal/mol for
HC6H5.[1] Therefore, such a CH bond cleavage was
generally believed to be difficult.
In 1963, Kleiman and Dubeck reported the possibility of CH bond cleavage in azobenzene by the Cp2Ni complex, Eq. (1).[2] The reaction mechanism for this metalation reaction has not been elucidated, but the ortho-CH bond was apparently cleaved. 1 Two years later, in 1965, Chatt and Davidson reported on the first example of the oxidative addition of a CH bond to the zero-valent ruthenium center to give the Ru(H)(2-naphthyl)(dmpe)2 [dmpe  1,2-bis(dimethyl- phosphino)ethane] complex, which is in equilibrium with a -coordinated naphthalene ruthenium complex, Ru(naphthalene)(dmpe)2, Eq. (2).[3] They also reported that the sp3 CH bond of the methyl group in the dmpe ligand can be cleaved by the ruthenium(0) complex. 2 After these pioneering studies, many research groups have reported on the cleavage of CH bonds via the use of a stoichiometric amount of transition metal com- plexes.[4] To date, a large number of review articles is available and the fundamental features of the CH bond cleavage reactions have been elucidated.[4,5] Nearly all of these review articles deal with studies of the stoichio- metic cleavage of CH bonds by transition metal

This review article will broadly survey the literature dealing with the catalytic use of otherwise unreactive sp2 and sp3 CH bonds in organic synthesis until early in the year 2003. However, several areas, e.g., hydroacylation of olefins and acetylenes with aldehydes, Michael addition and aldol reactions using active methylene compounds, reactions involving transition metal-carbe- noids, reactions using aryl halides, acetylenes, and palladium complexes, and reactions in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts, will not be dealt with. In this review, only limited numbers of examples which involve unusual significance, originality, or complexity will be presented in equation form. 2 Catalytic CC Bond Formation via a CH Bond Cleavage Carbon-carbon bond formation is one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis.[9] A large number of methods has been published in the literature and this chemistry continues to grow. When the CC bond formation is carried out catalytically, relatively reactive functional groups such as halogen and triflates are usually used.[10] The important step for these reactions is the generation of metal-carbon bonds via oxidative addition of the CX bond (X  halogen,triflate) to low-valent transition metal complexes. The insertion of small molecules such as olefins, acetylenes,and carbon monoxide into the metal-carbon bond is followed by a reductive elimination, resulting in CC bond formation. If CH bonds can be used like carbon- halogen bonds for constructing a CC bond, the reaction becomes one of the most valuable, powerful,straightforward procedures in organic synthesis. In this section, transition metal-catalyzed CC bond formation through a CH bond cleavage will be discussed.
2.1 Addition of CH Bonds to C/C Double Bonds
The catalytic addition of CH bonds to olefins con- stitutes one of the most efficient, economical methods for constructing CC bond frameworks. In 1978, Yama- zaki reported on some pioneering studies in this area.[11] The reaction of benzene, used as a solvent, with diphenylketene in the presence of Rh4(CO)12 as a catalyst gives diphenylmethyl phenyl ketone in good yield with moderate selectivity, Eq. (3). The use of a CO atmosphere is essential in achieving a catalytic reaction although no CO incorporation occurs, probably because carbon monoxide maintains the catalyst in an active form. In the examination of the relative reactivities of several aromatic compounds, they found that fluoro- benzene is more reactive than toluene. On the basis of these results, they proposed that the CH bond cleavage step by the rhodium complex appears to be nucleophilic in nature. The rhodium catalyst is also effective for the dehydrogenative vinylation of benzenes with ethylene to give styrenes.[12] Fumitoshi Kakiuchi was born in Hoyogo, Japan, in 1965 and received his B.Sc. in 1988 and Ph.

Catal. 2003, 345, 1077  1101 3 The double insertion of ethylene into aniline with the aid of rhodium(III) chloride hydrate gives the cyclization product, 2-methylquinoline, Eq. (4).[13] Forcing reaction conditions (a high ethylene pressure, 100 kg/cm2, and a high temperature, 200C) and the use of an excess of aniline are required for this catalytic reaction to proceed efficiently. The addition of an sp3 CH bond adjacent to a nitrogen atom in dimethylamine to 1-pentene is catalyzed by the tungsten amide complex W(NMe2)n,[14] which is a 2:1 adduct of W2(NMe2)6/ W(NMe2)6,to give N-methyl-N-(2-methylpentyl)a- mine, Eq. (5).[15] The similar type of reaction involving an  CH bond adjacent to oxygen with tert-butyl- ethylene is catalyzed by IrH5(PiPr3)2 under relatively mild reaction conditions (50C).[16] This reaction is formally a dehydrogenative coupling. Hydrogenation of the olefin is the key for regenerating the catalytically active species since the generation of molecular hydro- gen by reductive elimination from an H-M-H species is usually a thermally unfavorable pathway.[17] Thus, in this reaction, the olefin functions as an acceptor of the CH bond and also as a scavenger of two hydrogen atoms from the metal center. 4 5 The heteroatom-directed ethylation of a phenol on the benzene ring is catalyzed by a ruthenium(II)-phosphite complex. This alkylation takes place exclusively at the position ortho to the hydroxy group, and the corre- sponding 1:2 addition product is the major product, Eq. (6).[18] The alkylation of -picoline with a terminal olefin occurs at a position  to the nitrogen with the aid of a cationic zirconium catalyst, Eq. (7).[6] For this reaction, the protection of one  CH bond of the pyridine ring with an alkyl group is required to conduct this reaction in a catalytic manner. This reaction can be extended to an asymmetric version. An example of the asymmetric -alkylation of the picoline via CH bond cleavage reaction using a chiral tetrahydroindenyl- zirconium complex has been reported by Jordan.[6b] The enantiomeric excess of the product is up to 58% ee.
Another type of coupling reaction was reported by Jones:[19] the RuH2 (dmpe)2-catalyzed intramolecular insertion of isocyanide into the benzylic CH bond in 2,6-xylyl isonitrile leading to indole derivatives. 6 7 In 1993, Murai found the first example of a highly efficient, selective CH/olefin coupling reaction.[8] The reaction of aromatic ketones with olefins in the presence of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 gave the corresponding ortho- alkylated compounds in quite high yields, Eq. (8).
Various combinations of aromatic ketones and olefins are applicable to this reaction. Carbon-carbon bond formation occurred exclusively at the position ortho to the carbonyl group. The important feature of this reaction is the coordination of the carbonyl group to the ruthenium, bringing the ruthenium closer proximity to the ortho CH bonds. 8 Murai reported on the successful use of a variety of directing groups including ketones,[20] esters,[21] alde- hydes,[22] aldimines,[23] ketimines,[23] amidinates,[24] hy- drazones,[25] and nitriles.[26] The ruthenium-catalyzed coupling of aromatic ketones with olefins is tolerant of several functional groups [e.g., NMe2, OMe, F, NEt- C(O)Me, CF3, CO2Et, CN, acetals, OC(O)CH3]. As shown in Figure 1, the regioselectivity is basically controlled by steric factors. In the case of the reaction Catalytic Methods for CH Bond Functionalization

Interestingly, however, the reactions of m- fluoro- and m-methoxyacetophenones with triethoxy- vinylsilane take place at the more congested ortho position, i.e., 2-position (Figure 2; 1 and 2, respectively).
When a strong electron-withdrawing CF3 group, which should decrease the electron density of the adjacent atom, is introduced on the ether oxygen as in 3, the alkylation takes place preferentially at the less con- gested position. These results suggest that heteroatoms may additionally assist in the regioslectivity determi- nation step.
Murai has claimed that there are two plausible mechanisms with respect to the CH bond cleavage step (Scheme 1).[20b] One is a usual oxidative addition of the CH bond to the ruthenium center which proceeds through transition state TSA (path a, concerted path- way). In the other case, the CH bond cleavage through intermediate B occurs in two steps (path b, stepwise pathway). Therefore, in the first step the ruthenium- carbon bond is formed without CH bond cleavage and in the second step the hydrogen at the ortho position is transferred to the ruthenium atom. Both mechanisms satisfactorily explain the ortho selectivity. Morokuma and Koga reported that the latter mechanism (path b) is reasonable for the CH bond cleavage by the ruthenium complex on the basis of ab initio theoretical calcula- tions.[27] For their theoretical calculation, they used benzaldehyde and ethylene as models of aromatic ketone and olefin. Their calculation revealed that the highly selective ortho CH bond cleavage of the aromatic ketones stems from the coordination of the carbonyl oxygen to the ruthenium center. If the reaction passes through the conventional three-centered transi- tion state (path a), a much larger activation energy (20.1 kcal/mol) would be required. On the contrary, if the CH bond is cleaved through novel metalacycle intermediate B, the reaction proceeds with an extremely small activation energy (1.8  3.0 kcal/mol). Therefore,their calculation suggests that the coordination of the carbonyl oxygen to the ruthenium center is the key for the success of the ruthenium-catalyzed CH/olefin coupling and the reductive elimination, i.e., CC bond formation is rate-determining.
Deuterium-labeling experiments and 13C kinetic iso- tope effects (KIE) for the RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3-catalyzed reaction of aromatic ketones with olefins provide significant information concerning the rate-determining step. The catalytic reaction of acetophenone-d5 with triethoxyvinylsilane is carried out in presence of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 as the catalyst at 50C for 15 h (0% conversion), Eq. (9).[20b] Even though the CH/olefin coupling reaction does not proceed at all under these reaction conditions, H/D scrambling among the two ortho positions of the ketone and the three vinylic positions of the olefin takes place to some extent. These results indicate that a rapid equilibrium exists prior to the reductive elimination step leading to CC bond formation. These results indicate that the CH bond cleavage step is quite facial and that the later step of the catalytic cycle is rate-determining. The studies of 13C KIE for this coupling reaction also provide support that the reductive elimination step is rate-determining.[28] Thus, Murai×s experimental results are consistent with Morokuma×s theoretical calculation.[27] 9 Brookhart found another important phenomenon for the chelation-assisted CH/olefin couplings.[29] In the Figure 1.

By means of deuterium labeling experiments, they revealed that each CH bond at the aromatic ring added to the ruthenium atom. These results indicate that the CH bond cleavage occurs without the coordination of the ketone carbonyl group. Interestingly, however, the CC bond formation occurred only at the ortho position. This result suggests that in the CC bond formation step the coordination of the carbonyl group is essential (Scheme 2). Brookhart×s observations provide a signifi- cant working hypothesis for developing new types of CH/olefin coupling reactions.
Several related examples of transition metal-cata- lyzed addition of CH bonds in ketones to olefins have been reported.[3034] Application of CH/olefin coupling to polymer chemistry has been reported by Weber×s group.[30] They prepared a variety of polymers by reactions of aromatic ketones having two free ortho CH bonds with ,-dienes such as 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl- 1,3-divinyldisiloxane with the aid of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 complex as a catalyst, Eq. (10). The fact that this step growth polymerization gives higher molecular weight polymers implies that each step proceeds virtually quantitatively. In particular, acetophenones having an electron-donating group, e.g., methoxy and amino groups, exhibit higher reactivities. Woodgate applied the RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3-catalyzed coupling of aromatic ketones with olefins to the alkylation of aromatic diterpenoids.[31] The alkylation of phenyl 3-pyridyl ketone proceeds with the aid of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 as catalyst.[32] The alkylation selectively proceeds at the pyridine ring. Chaudret prepared a reactive ruthenium complex, RuH2(H2)(CO)(PCy3)2, and examined the catalytic activity of the complex in a reaction of benzophenonewith ethylene.[33] The desired CH/olefin coupling reaction giving the bis(alkylation) product proceeded at room temperature and up to 19 turnover numbers were achieved in 48 h, Eq. (11). Leitner sub- sequently reported the similar room-temperature CH/ olefin coupling reaction using Chaudret×s catalyst.[34] Several attempts have been made to understand the mechanism and the intermediate involved in the cata- lytic reaction. Trost reported that the catalytic active species does not contain a CO ligand because the RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3-catalyzed CH/olefin coupling reac- tion is strongly inhibited under a CO atmosphere.[35] Whittlesey prepared some ortho metalated complexes by the reaction of Ru(H2)H2(PPh3)3 with aceto- phenone.[36] Among the complexes, the most likely ortho metalated complex RuH(o-C6H4C(O)CH3)(CO)(PPh3)2 (4) (Figure 3) showed essentially no catalytic activity. 10 11 Chaudret prepared a PCy3 analogue of the ortho metalated complex, RuH(o-C6H4C(O)CH3)(CO)(PCy3)2 (5) (Figure 3), and observed that the complex does not show any reactivity for the CH/olefin coupling reaction.[33] They also concluded that the ruthenium complex having a CO ligand is not the intermediate in the catalytic reaction, similar to Trost×s proposal. The authors of this review are skeptical about this discussion because several ruthenium complexes,including RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3, are known to be converted to Ru(CO)3(PPh3)2 under an atmosphere of carbon monox- ide,[37] which was reported by Murai to be a poor catalyst for the CH/olefin coupling.[8,20b] Fogg reported an ortho metalated ruthenium complex, RuH(o-C6H4C(O)- Ph(CO)(dcypb) (6) [dcypb  Cy2P(CH2)4PCy2], which was prepared by a reaction of RuH2(dcypb)(CO) with benzophenone (Figure 3).[38] In this complex, the hy- dride ligand is bound at the apical position. This stereochemistry is different from those of Whittlesey×s and Chaudret×s complexes. Fogg examined the catalytic activity of 6 for the reaction of aromatic ketones with olefin. However, 6 did not exhibit catalytic ac- tivity.Hiraki reported an

However,they did not isolate the corresponding complexes like 4  6. They discussed the reaction mechanism only on the basis of the NMR studies. Weber synthesized a zero-valent ruthenium complex, Ru(o-vinylacetophenone)(CO)- (PPh3)2 (7) (Figure 3).[40] Interestingly, this complex has catalytic activity for the co-polymerization of aceto- phenone with 1,3-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane, although it has a CO ligand. The studies mentioned above indicate that the relation between the structures of the catalyst precursor and the catalyst activity is currently poorly understood and it is premature to conclude that the presence of a CO ligand on the ruthenium center retards catalytic activity.[40] Further studies to elucidate the structure of the actual active species should be awaited.
Chelation-assisted CH/olefin coupling is also appli- cable to aromatic esters.[21] In the case of aromatic esters,electron-withdrawing groups such as CF3 and CN groups facilitate the CH/olefin coupling reaction, Eq. (12). In this alkylation, trimethylvinylsilane showed a higher reactivity (100% yield for 1 h) than triethoxyvinylsilane (97% yield for 24 h). The use of an amide group is also effective for the regioselective alkylation. Togni report- ed that the addition of a CH bond of benzamide to norbornene takes place in the presence of an Ir(Cp)(R)- biphemp complex [biphemp  2,2-bis(diphenylphos- phino)-6,6-dimethyl-1,1-biphenyl], Eq. (13).[41] This re- action gives the optically active alkylation product in moderate yields with high enantiomer excess. 13 For the alkylation of aromatic aldehydes and conjugated enals with olefins using the RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst, a sterically bulky substituent on the ortho position or a heteroatom at the  position of the enals is essential for the reaction to proceed catalytically. These substituents are believed to suppress undesired decarbonylation reactions by steric or electronic effects, Eqs. (14) and (15).[22] 14 15 A nitrogen functionality can also function as a directing group. In the cases of reactions of aromatic imines, Ru3(CO)12 exhibits a higher catalytic activity than RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3. Interestingly, the reaction of aro- matic ketimines derived from acetophenone gave the corresponding 1:1 coupling product as a single product, Eq. (16).[23] 16 Lim reported a similar alkylation of aromatic imines with olefins using the RhCl(coe)2]2/PCy3 catalyst sys- tem.[42] Later, Jun also reported the RhCl(PPh3)3- catalyzed coupling of aromatic imines with olefins.[43] Both aromatic aldimines and ketimines smoothly re- acted with the olefin to give the corresponding alkyla- tion products. Interestingly, in the case of aromatic ketimines, the 1:1 coupling product is obtained as a single isomer. On the other hand, in the case of the reaction of the hydrazone derived from acetophenone,the corresponding 1:1 and 1:2 coupling products are Figure 3.

Steric repulsion between the methyl group in the imine moiety and the alkyl group at the ortho position does not appear to be important for product selectivity.
The sp2 nitrogen in a pyridine ring can also function as a directing functionality. The alkylation reaction of 2- arylpyridines is catalyzed by rhodium catalysts.[44] In- troduction of a methyl group at the 3-position of the pyridyl ring suppresses the incorporation of the second olefin into another ortho CH bond. For the alkylation of 3-methyl-2-phenylpyridine, the cone angles of the phosphine ligands largely affect reactivity rather than electronic factors, Eq. (17).[42b] The pyridyl group-di- rected CH/olefin coupling can be extended to atrop- selective alkylation.[45] The coupling of 2-(1-naphthyl)- 3-methylpyridine with ethylene using [RhCl(coe)2]2/(R),(S)-PPFOMe as catalyst {(R),(S)-PPFOMe(R)-1-[(S)- 2-diphenylphophino]ferrocenyl)ethyl methyl ether} gives the alkylation product in 37% yield with 49% ee. 17 Murai reported that olefinic CH bonds in conjugated enones can add across C/C double bonds with the aid of the RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst, Eq. (18).[20c, g] Among the acylcyclohexenes investigated, 1-pivaloyl-1-cyclo- hexene exhibits a high reactivity and the presence of an oxygen atom at the allylic position in the 6-membered ring increases the reactivity of the enones. Some terminal olefins, e.g., triethoxyvinylsilane, allyltrime- thylsilane, methyl methacrylate, and vinylcyclohexane,are applicable to this reaction. Acyclic enones are also effective for this CH/olefin coupling.[20 g] Trost reported on a similar coupling reaction of a conjugated ester with olefins using RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3, Eq. (19).[35] Both cyclic and acyclic conjugated esters can be applied to the coupling reaction. This coupling reaction tolerates various functional groups on the ester moiety. 19 The rhodium-catalyzed alkylation of 2-isopropenylpyr- idine gives the addition product, in which the stereo- chemistry around the double bond is inverted with respect to the thermodynamically favorable E-isomer, Eq. (20).[46] This olefinic CH/olefin coupling can be applied to several substrates. The reaction of 2-vinyl- pyridines with 1,-dienes results in a double CH/olefin coupling reaction affording carbocycles with good efficiency, albeit in low-product selectivity.[46c] Murai found that intramolecular CH/olefin coupling pro- vides a new entry to the carbocyclic compounds.[47] The cyclization of 1-methyl-2-octa-1,5-dienyl-1H-imidazole giving a 5-membered carbocycle is catalyzed by a ruthenium or a rhodium complex, Eq. (21). A pyridyl group is also effective as a directing group for this type of cyclization of 1,-dienes. Deuterium labeling experi- ments indicate that this reaction proceeds via a direct CH bond cleavage pathway and that the reductive elimination step is rate-determining. This cyclization reaction proceeds in an asymmetric fashion.[47b] When the reaction is conducted in the presence of a mono- dentate chiral ferrocenylphosphine and [RhCl(coe)2]2,enantiomerically enriched carbocycles are obtained.[47b] In the case of the reaction of an imidazolyldiene, the product is obtained in 75% chemical yield with 82% ee at 50C, Eq. (21). Ellman and Bergman recently re- ported on a similar intramolecular cyclization reac- tion.[48] The conversion of N-alkenylbenzimidazoles yielding carbocycles proceeded with the aid of [RhCl(coe)2]2 and PCy3, Eq. (22). They proposed that the N-heterocyclic carbene complex may participate in this cyclization as an intermediate and theoretical calculations supported the intermediacy of this carbene complex.[48c] An imino group is also effective as a directing group for the intramolecular cyclization,giving carbocycles.[48b] The intramolecular cyclization reactions described above provide new routes for the synthesis of carbocycles. The CH bond in the CHN moiety in five-membered heteroaromatic compounds such as thiazoles, benzimidazoles, and -oxazoles also adds to C/C double bonds, Eq. (23).[49] The use of Lewis acids such as lutidium chloride and MgBr2 dramatically increases the efficiency of the reaction, although the role of the Lewis acids employed is not clear. 20 18 Catalytic Methods for CH Bond Functionalization

KGaA, Weinheim 1083 21 22 23 Dimerization of acrylonitrile is a cheaper way to synthesize highly valuable hexamethylenediamine which is one component of the starting materials for Nylon-6,6.[50,51] In some cases of the dimerizations of acrylic acid esters, acrylonitriles, and acroleins, a direct CH bond cleavage step is believed to be involved in the catalytic reaction. At the early stage of the catalytic dimerization of acrylonitrile, cis-1,4-dicyanobut-1-ene is formed as the major product, not the trans-isomer.[50,51] It has been proposed that this high cis-selectivity indicates the selective cleavage of the CH bond cis to CN by the metal coordinated to nitrile group with a side- on fashion.[52] However, the participation of -bonded nitrile is still disputable because several possible reac- tion pathways exist. The ruthenium-catalyzed alkylation of benzonitriles with triethoxyvinylsilane proceeds at the ortho position predominantly, Eq. (24).[26] This regioselectivity indicates the possibility of -coordina- tion of the CN group to the ruthenium in the catalytic cycle. 24 Catalytic CC bond formation via sp3 CH bond cleavage is the ultimate reaction in organic synthesis.
A relatively ideal catalytic reaction system involves the use of sp3 CH bonds adjacent to a heteroatom such as nitrogen and oxygen. Early examples using tungsten or iridium complexes have already been mentioned above.[15,16] Recently, Jun succeeded in the Ru3(CO)12- catalyzed alkylation of an sp3 CH bond  to the nitrogen atom in benzyl(3-methylpyridin-2-yl)amine by means of chelation assistance, Eq. (25).[53] In this case,the coordination of the pyridine nitrogen to the ruthenium complex followed by the CH bond cleav- age, which allows the formation of a five-membered ruthenacycle, was proposed to be important in this catalytic reaction. Murai also reported on the rutheni- um-catalyzed coupling of 2-N-pyridyldialkylamines, Eq. (26).[54] The use of 2-propanol as a solvent dramat- ically improves the yield of the product.

(27).
Recently, several reaction systems resulting in the formation of heteroaromatic compounds which are modifications of the preceding annulation reaction using aniline and ethylene with the aid of rhodium catalyst have been developed.[55] An intramolecular version of this quinoline synthesis using o-allylanilines and Co2(CO)8 catalyst has also been demonstrated by Jones.[56] 27 Some other types of CH/olefin coupling reactions have also been reported.

Obviously, non-chelation-assisted CH/olefin cou- plings are more ideal than chelation-assisted ones.
Recently, the alkylation of benzene with olefins has been accomplished with the aid of [Ir(-acac-O,O,C3)(acac- O,O)(acac-C3)]2, Eq. (29). Although interesting, the reaction does not overcome the regioselectivity. Thus,the reaction of substituted arenes with olefins provides a mixture of regioisomers.[59] For example, the reaction of toluene with ethylene affords m- and p-isomers in 63% and 37% selectivity, respectively. 29
2.2 Addition of CH Bonds to C/C Triple Bonds
Substituted styrenes and vinylic compounds are versa- tile intermediates in organic synthesis, and various methods for accomplishing this have been published in the literature.[9,60,61] Among the catalytic approaches,transition metal-catalyzed coupling reactions using organometallic reagents[62] and dehydrohalogenative vinylation reactions between organic halides and olefins (the so-called MizorokiHeck reaction)[63,64] are fre- quently used to obtain the desired compounds. For these reactions, however, the use of a CX (e.g., X  halogen,triflate) bond is required for producing CC bonds. If the direct addition of an otherwise unreactive CH bond to acetylenes takes place, the method promises to become one of the simplest methods for the preparation of vinylic compounds with 100% atom efficiency. In this section, we will describe the transition metal-catalyzed vinylation of aromatic compounds using acetylenes.
The pioneering work on a coupling of aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds with acetylenes has been reported by Yamazaki.[11b,65] Reaction of benzene with diphenylacetylene gives triphenylethene in 45% yield based on the acetylene employed. The presence of carbon monoxide is an essential factor in accomplishing this coupling in a catalytic fashion. In the case of the monosubstituted benzene, the low regioselectivity is an inevitable problem. The reaction of toluene gives a mixture of o-, m-, and p-isomers in a ratio of 6:65:29, Eq. (30). Heteroaromatic compounds, such as furan,thiophene and N-methylpyrrole, are also applicable to this vinylation reaction, giving the corresponding cou- pling products in 80%, 48%, and 31% yields, respecti- vely.[11b,66] The order of the relative reactivities of these compounds are estimated as follows:furan thiophene  N-methylpyrrole  benzene. 30 The addition of CH bonds in azobenzenes to di- phenylacetylene is catalyzed by CoH(N2)(PPh3)3, CoH3(PPh3)3, or RhCl(PPh3)3.[67] When RhCl(PPh3)3 is used as the catalyst, this coupling reaction gives 1- (arylamino)indole in good yields, Eq. (31). Electron- withdrawing groups on the acetylene retard the coupling reaction. On the basis of this result, it was proposed that the CH bond cleavage step is rate-determining. There are several alternative mechanisms and these wait further studies.

(32).[68] When trimethylsilyl-substi- tuted acetylenes are employed in the reaction, the desired coupling products are obtained with high regioselectivity in excellent yields.[68a] In the case of the reaction with 1-trimethylsilylpropyne, the regio- and stereochemical outcome is perfect. The E-isomer is the predominant product. These results indicate that the addition of CH bonds to the C/C triple bond proceeds with syn selectivity. This CH/olefin coupling is appli- cable to conjugated enones, and highly substituted dienes are obtained in high yields with a high stereo- selectivity.[68b] Miura reported regioselective alkenyla- tion of 1-naphthols with alkynes.[69] In this case, the CC bond formation takes place exclusively at the peri position (8 position). 32 Extensive reactions of ruthenium-catalyzed CH/ace- tylene coupling have been studied with respect to the step growth copolymerization of aromatic ketones and acetylenes, resulting in the formation of cross-conju- gated polymers, copoly(arylene/1,2-vinylene)backbone, Eq. (33),[70] which have received considerable attention because of their potential utility in a number of applications such as light emitting diodes.[71] Woodgate demonstrated a similar alkenylation reaction of diter- penoid analogues with acetylenes.[72] The regio- and stereoselectivities are nearly the same as that in the reaction of Eq. (32). Lim reported that the reaction of 2- phenylpyridines with internal acetylenes using RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst also gives ortho alkenylation products in high yields.[73] 33 Quite recently, the iridium-catalyzed addition of sp3 CH bond adjacent to the imino nitrogen to acetylenes was reported by Ishii, Eq. (34).[74] Terminal acetylenes can be used for this reaction. Carbon-carbon bond formation takes place at the internal carbon atom of the acetylene moiety. 34 When the rhodium-catalyzed coupling of phenylboronic acid with internal acetylenes is performed, a unique alkenylation reaction involving a 1,4-shift of rhodium,i.e., the isomerization of 2-aryl-1-alkenylrhodium to 2- alkenylarylrhodium, takes place (Scheme 4).[75a] This unique 1,4-shift of rhodium is supported by deuterium Scheme 4.

Previously, Miura has already reported a similar 1,4-shift of rhodium in multialkyla- tion of aromatic ring with norbornene (see Scheme 3).[58] Although not unprecedented, Larock found that a unique 1,4-shift of palladium takes place in the palla- dium-catalyzed reaction 2-iodo-4-methylbiaryl with ethyl acrylate.[75b] Another approach to the alkenylation of aromatic compounds involves the electrophilic substitution of arenes with transition metal salts such as Pd(OAc)2 and PtCl2. One of the most significant advances in the catalytic addition of CH bonds to C/C triple bonds was achieved by Fujiwara, Eq. (35).[76] Various arenes react with both terminal and internal acetylenes to give the corresponding trans hydroarylation products in high yields. It is noteworthy that this coupling reaction occurs at room temperature. The stereoselectivity and efficien- cy of this coupling reaction are sufficiently high to merit its use as a tool in organic synthesis. When arenes having an acetylene moiety are exposed to the reaction conditions, intramolecular cyclization takes place selec- tively. For example, in the case of aryl alkynoates,coumarins are obtained in high yields, Eq. (36).[76ce] 35 36
2.3 Oxidative Coupling of Arenes with Olefins via
Electrophilic Substitution by Transition Metal Complexes The alkenylation of arenes with olefins via CH bond cleavage is the most highly valuable procedure for the preparation of styrene derivatives. The first example of this type of coupling reaction was reported in 1967.[77] Later, several efforts have been made to perform this reaction in a catalytic manner.[78] Recently, remarkable advances appeared with respect to the transition metal- catalyzed oxidative coupling of arenes with olefins.
Mikami reported the asymmetric coupling reaction of benzene with cyclohexenecarbonitrile in the presence of Pd(OAc)2, tert-butyl perbenzoate as an oxidant, and a chiral oxazoline ligand.[79] This reaction gives 6-phenyl- 1-cyclohexenecarbonitrile. Chiral induction arises at the 6-position of the cyclohexene ring. The chemical and optical yields are moderate, but this is a prospective procedure for making CC bonds in an enantioselective fashion, Eq. (37). Fujiwara achieved the highly efficient palladium-catalyzed addition of arenes to electron- deficient olefins with the aid of benzoquinone and tert- butyl hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant, Eq. (38).[80] In this case, CC bond formation took place selectively at the position  to the electron-withdrawing groups. A similar reaction was reported using heteropolyoxome- talate and oxygen as a reoxidation reagent by Ishii.[81] In these cases, the control of regioselectivity is substantial.
The use of chelation-assistance with the amide group improved the regioselectivity. The Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed reaction of N-acetylanilides with acrylic esters conduct- ed at room temperature using benzoquinone as an oxidant gives the alkenylated product in good to high yields. This observation suggests that chelation-assis- tance is also effective in electrophilic CH bond cleavage, Eq. (39).[82] Alkenylations of arenes using rhodium[83] or ruthenium catalysts[84] have also been demonstrated by several research groups. 37 38 39
2.4 Coupling of CH Bonds, Carbon Monoxide, and
Olefins There are two categories that involve the direct carbon- ylation of CH bonds. One is CH/CO coupling, and the other is CH/CO/olefin coupling. Since the former reaction leading to aldehydes is endothermic, the reaction should ideally be conducted under photo- irradiation conditions.[85] On the other hand, the CH/ CO/olefin coupling reaction leading to ketones can proceed under thermal reaction conditions, because it is exothermic. The photo-assisted carbonylation reaction of CH bonds will not be dealt with in this review, since there are several leading review articles.[4] Catalytic Methods for CH Bond Functionalization

KGaA, Weinheim 1087 Yamazaki reported the first example of a three- component coupling reaction of CH bonds in arenes, CO, and olefins using a Rh4(CO)12 catalyst.[12] This pioneering work reveals that the benzene ring under- goes acylation with CO and olefins under thermal reaction conditions, although the efficiency is not high.
In 1992, Moore reported on the highly selective carbon- ylation of pyridines with the aid of a Ru3(CO)12 catalyst.[7] The reaction of pyridine, CO, and 1-hexene in the presence of Ru3(CO)12 at 150C gives -acylated pyridines, Eq. (40). A number of olefins can be used in this system. Terminal olefins, as small as ethylene and as large as 1-eicosene, afforded the corresponding linear pyridyl ketones as the major products. 40 Murai and coworkers reports that the carbonylation of imidazole derivatives using several olefins takes place in high yields with the aid of a Ru3(CO)12 catalyst, Eq. (41).[86] Carbon-carbon bond formation occurs ex- clusively at the position  to the sp2 nitrogen. A wide range of olefins can be utilized in this reaction, and a variety of functional groups are compatible under the reaction conditions, indicating that CH bond activa- tion reactions are now on a satisfactory level in organic synthesis. The (-H)triruthenium clusters 8, as shown in Scheme 5, are proposed as a key species on the basis of the result in which a triosmium cluster, analogous to complex 8, is obtained by a stoichiometric reaction of Os3(CO)10(CH3CN)2 with 2-methylimidazole.[87] Other five-membered N-heteroaromatic compounds, such as pyrazoles, oxazoles, and thiazoles, can also be used for the carbonylation, and in all cases, carbonylation takes place exclusively at a CH bond  to the sp2 nitrogen.
The reactivity of the five-membered heterocycles cor- responds to the pKa values of the conjugate acid of these heterocycles. The higher the pKa of the substrate, the higher is the reactivity. This result also indicates that the coordination of the substrates by the sp2 nitrogen to the ruthenium center is essential for the reaction to proceed. 41 Carbonylation at a CH bond  to the sp2 ring nitrogen is also achieved by Ru3(CO)12 catalyst.[88] The Ru3(CO)12- catalyzed reaction of 1,2-dimethylbenzimidazole with olefin and CO provides the corresponding  acylated product in high yield, Eq. (42). 42 When the reaction of phenylpyridine with CO (20 atm) and ethylene is conducted at 160C, the ortho CH bond ( to the sp2 nitrogen) in the benzene ring undergoes carbonylation, Eq. (43).[89] In this reaction, a CH bond in the pyridine ring is completely unreactive. In the reaction of m-substituted substrates, such as those having Me, OMe, CF3, and COOMe, carbonylation takes place exclusively at the less hindered CH bond,irrespective of the electronic nature of the substituents.
An oxazoline ring instead of a pyridine ring is also an effective directing group for the  selective carbon- ylation of the benzene ring.[90] The reaction of aromatic aldimine gives indenones via carbonylation reaction at the ortho CH bond followed by intramolecular aldol- type condensation, Eq. (44).[91] 43 44 The carbonylation of a CH bond at the position  to the sp2 nitrogen proceeds with the aid of Ru3(CO)12 as catalyst, Eq. (45).[92] The reactivity appears to be sensitive to the polarity of the solvent. The choice of N,N-dimethylacetamide as the solvent is crucial for the reaction to proceed efficiently.

(46).[93] The [RhCl(cod)]2 complex is superior as a catalyst and 2-propanol is the solvent of the choice. While cyclic amines exhibit a high reactivity (up to 84% ), acyclic amines show relatively low reactivity (18% ). Although the scope of this reaction is limited, this carbonylation protocol expands the scope of carbonylation reactions. The use of Ru3(CO)12 as a catalyst does not result in a carbonylation reaction, but instead the addition of the sp3 CH bond across the olefin bond to give an alkylation product, even when the reaction is carried out under CO pressure.[94] 46 The reaction of N-(2-pyridinyl)piperazines with CO and ethylene in the presence of a catalytic amount of Rh4(CO)12 in toluene at 160C results in a novel type of carbonylation reaction, which involves dehydrogen- ation and carbonylation at a CH bond, Eq. (47).[95] The presence of an additional nitrogen functionality at the 4- position of the piperazine ring is essential for the reaction to proceed. The substitution of both an electron-donating group on the 4-nitrogen and an electron-withdrawing group, e.g., 5-COOMe, 4-COOMe,and 5-CF3, on the pyridine ring causes a significant increase in reactivity. It was found that the reaction involves two discrete reactions: i) dehydrogenation of the piperazine ring leading to 10 and ii) carbonylation at a CH bond in the resulting olefin 10. Interestingly, Ru3(CO)12 is ineffective for the carbonylation of 9, but effective for the carbonylation of 10 or N-(2-pyridin- yl)enamines.[96] In place of the pyridyl group, an acyl group can also serve as a directing group for carbon- ylation at an  CH bond, Eq. (48).[97] This is the first example of a carbonylation at a CH bond which is directed by a functional group other than a CN moiety. 48 Several high-throughput protocols for examining opti- mal reaction conditions and applicable substrates have recently been reported. A mass spectrometric labeling strategy is now popular as a rapid screening method to evaluate many substrates. The method can be applied to the direct carbonylation of CH bonds in N-heterocyclic compounds (Scheme 6).[98] The three-component coupling reaction of a CH bond, carbon monoxide, and olefins leading to ketones is applicable to a number of N-heterocyclic compounds.
The carbonylation at sp2 CH bonds reported thus far can be classified into four types, depending on the position where the carbonylation takes place; , , , and to the sp2 nitrogen atom. Carbonylation at an sp3 CH bond adjacent to a nitrogen atom has also been developed. These methods have already become new synthetic tools for catalytic acylation.
2.5 Catalytic Arylation of CH Bonds
Catalytic arylation via CH bond cleavage is a subject of intense interest.[99] Pioneering work in this area was originally reported by Chiusoli in 1985.[100] The reaction of bromobenzene with norbornene gives hexahydrome- thanotriphenylenes, Eq. (49). The biaryl framework is formed via CH bond cleavage. Later de Meijer also reported on a similar coupling reaction of aryl halides with norbornene, to give the multiple arylation prod- uct.[101] One of the highly important advances in this area is the palladium-catalyzed arylation of 2-phenylphenols and naphthols, Eq. (50).[102] The formation of an (ar- yl)(aryloxy)palladium(II) intermediate is crucial to accomplishing this arylation reaction. Very recently,the RhCl(PPh3)3-catalyzed arylation of phenols with aryl halides in the presence of phosphinites [PR2(OAr)] has been reported, Eq. (51). [103] The significant point of this reaction is the use of phosphinite as a co-catalyst.
The phosphorus atom coordinates to the rhodium atom,then electrophilic substitution with the rhodium(III) species occurs at the ortho position. 47 Catalytic Methods for CH Bond Functionalization

A plausible pathway is as follows: an anion exchange between the amido anion (or enolate) and triflate (or halide) ion in the Ar-Pd-X species leads to the (aryl)(alkoxy)palladium intermedi- ate 11; electrophilic palladation on the aromatic ring gives the Ar-Pd-Ar× intermediate 12; the reductive elimination affords the diaryl compounds.

(52).[107] Interestingly, when the reaction of 3-carboethoxyfuran with an aryl bromideis examined,the arylationproceeds selectively at the 2-position and the ester moiety is retained in the product.[108] The arylation of thiazole with aryl iodide occurs at the 2-position with the aid of PdCl2(PPh3)2/CuI as catalyst.[109] Tetrabutylammonium fluoride improves the activity of the catalyst. 52 The ruthenium(II)-phosphine complex exhibits a high catalytic activity for the regioselective arylation of 2- arylpyridines using aryl halides, Eq.

The same catalyst system is also effective for the arylation of aromatic imines.[111] The authors proposed that the tetravalent arylrutheni- um complex reacts electrophilically with the arylimines.
Therefore, CH bond cleavage proceeds via an electro- philic substitution pathway. 53 Dyker reported on the intramolecular arylation of CH bonds.[112] In this case, 1-tert-butyl-2-iodobenzene is reacted under palladium catalysis to give the 1,2- dihydrocyclobutabenzene derivative in 75% yield, Eq. (54). They proposed that this catalytic cycle is initiated by the oxidative addition of ArI to Pd(0) to give an Ar-Pd-I species, then electrophilic substitution at the sp3 CH bond with the Pd(II) species results in the formation of the cyclopalladation complex. To this Pd(II) species, another molecule of ArI oxidatively adds, giving the Pd(IV) complex. 54 There are new entries to the catalytic arylation of aromatic compounds. The utilization of organometallic reagents as an arylating agent is another protocol. Oi reported on the rhodium-catalyzed arylation of arylpyr- idines using tetraarylstannanes, Eq. (55).[113] This reac- tion required the use of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane as a solvent for attaining a high catalyst activity. Very recently, Kakiuchi found that the ruthenium-catalyzed coupling reaction of aromatic ketones with arylboro- nates providing the ortho arylated aromatic ketones, Eq.

The Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed phenylation of a tert-butyl group in an aromatic Schiff base with the diphenylsilanol pro- ceeded in good yield. The applicability is relatively limited, but this is a rare example of CC bond formation using an sp3 CH bond. 57 3 Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Alkanes Since various types of functional groups can be made by transformations of C/C double bonds, a large number of methods for the preparation of a C/C double bond have been reported.[9,66,67] The simplest way is the direct dehydrogenation of alkanes giving alkenes with the aid of transition metal-catalysts. This reaction is highly valuable, but only a limited number of studies has appeared in the literature. In this section, transition metal-catalyzed dehydrogenations of alkanes yielding alkenes will be described.
In 1979, Crabtree demonstrated the dehyrogenation of alkanes using a stoichiometic amount of an iridium- phosphine complex.[116] Several years later, dehydrogen- ation reactions of alkanes were conducted in the presence of a hydrogen acceptor, i.e., an alkene, because the thermally disfavored alkane dehydrogenation (G  ca. 20 kcal/mol)[117] becomes thermally much more favorable (G  ca. 0 kcal/mol) compared with hydrogen acceptor-less conditions by combining hydro- gen transfer reactions. The first example with respect to the catalytic dehydrogenation of an alkane under thermal conditions was reported by Baudry using a homogeneous rhenium catalyst.[118] The rhenium poly- hydride complex is effective for the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes with the aid of tert-butylethylene as a hydrogen acceptor. The turnover number in this system is only 9, but this result indicates the possibility of alkane dehydrogenation by a soluble transition metal catalyst under thermal reaction conditions, Eq. (58). Some other transition metal polyhydride complexes also have show catalytic activities for the alkane dehydrogenation.
Among several iridium complexes, e.g., [IrH5(iPr3P)2],[IrH5((p-FC6H4)3P)2], and [RuH4((p-FC6H4)3P)3], the iridium polyhydride complex having isopropylphos- phine shows the highest catalytic activities (23 TON/ Catalytic Methods for CH Bond Functionalization

Crabtree re-examined their previous- ly reported reactions and found that the dehydrogen- ation of cyclooctane takes place in a catalytic man- ner.[119] 58 Other types of thermal catalytic alkane dehydrogen- ation using a hydrogen acceptor have been reported by several research groups.[119126] A variety of iridium complexes, e.g., [IrH2(acetone)2P(p-FC6H4)3]SbF6,[119] IrH5(PiPr3)2,[120,121] [IrH2(CF3CO2)(p-FC6H4)2],[122,123] and [IrH2(3-C6H3(CH2PtBu2)2-2,6)],[124] can catalyze the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes giving cycloal- kenes in the presence of tert-butylethylene as the hydrogen acceptor, Eq. (59). An analogous iridium complex, [IrH2(acetone)2PPh3]SbF6,[125] catalyzes the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexenes to arenes.
In this case, the cyclohexenes function as the substrate and also as the hydrogen acceptor. 59 The highly efficient transfer dehydrogenation of alkanes has been reported by Goldman.[126] Their catalyst system is unique. A high pressure (1000 psi) of hydrogen is used for the dehydrogenation reaction.[126bd] Under 1000 psi of H2 at 100C for 15 min, a cyclooctane solution of RhCl(CO)(PMe3)2 (0.20 mM) and norbornene (1.2 M) yields 950 turnovers of cyclooctene (0.19 M) and norbornane (1.2 M), Eq. (60). The proposed mechanism for this paradoxical catalytic reaction involves the addition of H2, the loss of CO, and the transfer of
H2
to a sacrificial acceptor,thereby generating RhCl(PMe3)2, which is the same catalytically active species proposed in the photochemical dehydrogen- ation of alkanes with RhCl(CO)(PMe3)2 (Scheme 8). 60 In 1990, Saito reported an extremely interesting re- sult.[127] Their finding was that the endoergonic alkane dehydrogenation reactions can be driven by the con- tinuous removal of molecular hydrogen in the refluxing process, Eq. (61). They found that the catalytic reaction of an alkane dehydrogenation under thermal conditions gives an alkene and molecular hydrogen. The important factor in this catalyst system is the continuous removal of molecular hydrogen which is produced by dehydro- genation of the alkane from the reaction mixture by refluxing. Therefore, the continuous removal of mo- lecular hydrogen shifts the equilibrium toward the product, i.e., the alkene. This simple technique has been modified by Crabtree.[128] They have assayed the catalytic activities of a variety of transition metal catalysts using the modified reflux method published by Saito×s group. 61 A notable advance has recently been achieved in the acceptor-less dehydrogenation of alkanes. The transi- tion metal-catalyzed highly efficient alkane dehydro- genation proceeds, even in the absence of a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, under thermal conditions.[129] The iridium complex having a 3-C6H3(PBut

ligand efficiently catalyzes the dehydrogenation of cyclodecane to give cyclodecene, Eq. (62). When the reaction is carried out at 201C in refluxing cyclodecane,360 turnover numbers were attained after 24 h. The key to their success with respect to the high efficiency observed, appears to be the long-term stability of the Ir- PCP complexes at very high temperatures. 62 The most attractive recent subject in this area is the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of the acceptor- Scheme 8.

Although the actual reaction mecha- nism is still controversial, both studies provide an important consideration in future efforts with respect to the development of related acceptor-less thermal dehydrogenation reactions of alkanes. 4 Catalytic Silylation of CH Bonds Dehydrogenative silylations of arenes and alkanes with hydrosilane are also a thermally disfavored process. To accomplish these reactions in a catalytic manner, photo- irradiation or the co-presence of an efficient hydrogen acceptor is necessary.
Curtis reported, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of the dehydrogenative silylation of benzene with penatamethyldisiloxane using an IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2 catalyst under thermal reaction conditions in the absence of a hydrogen acceptor.In this case, a prolonged reaction period (49 days) was required to obtain rela- tively higher total yields of phenylated products.[132] The selective silylation of arenes with o-bis(dimethylsilyl)- benzene is catalyzed by Pt2(dba)3 complex, gives the monoarylated hydrosilanes in high yields, Eq. (63).[133] In this case, the bis(silyl)platinum appears to function as the active catalyst species. A deuterium-labeling experi- ment using o-bis(deuteriodimethylsilyl)benzene re- vealed the following results: 1) deuterium remains in the starting hydrosilane; 2) the newly formed SiH moiety does not contain deuterium. These observations indicate that the origin of the hydrogen of the SiH moiety in the product is benzene. They proposed the bis(silyl)platina intermediate as the active catalyst species. In this dehydrogenative silylation, the reactiv- ities of the arenes decrease in the following order:anisole  chlorobenzene  benzene  toluene. 63 Berry reported on the self-dehydrogenative silylation of triethylsilane in the presence of tert-butylethylene as the hydrogen acceptor using (5-C5Me5)Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2 as catalyst.[134] The conversion of the silane is almost quantitative and the dehydrogenative silylated product is obtained, Eq. (64). The (5-C5Me5)Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2 and (6-C6Me6)Ru(H)2(SiEt3)2 complexes are also ef- fective for the dehydrogenative silylation of arenes with triethylsilane, Eq. (65).[135] In this reaction, the carbosi- lane dimer, Et3SiCH(Me)SiHEt2, is formed in addition to the arylsilane. In the reaction of ,,-trifluorome- thyltoluene with triethylsilane, the selectivity of the desired arylsilane increases as the reaction proceeds.

(65) The major drawback of the preceding silylation of CH bonds is their low regioselectivity.[132135] One of the most reliable protocols for attaining a high regioselectivity is the use of chelation-assisted CH bond cleavage, which is now popular in catalytic reactions involving CH bond cleavage. This protocol can also be applied to CH/SiR3 coupling.[136] In the case of the reaction of aryloxazolines with hydrosilanes, the silylation takes place exclusively at the position ortho to the oxazoline ring. As mentioned above, for the dehydrogenative silylation of CH bond, the use of olefin as a hydrogen scavenger is required to attain the reaction in catalytic manner.
Triorganosilanes,especially triethylsilane,show a high reactivity. When the reaction of aryloxazo- lines with triethylsilane is carried out in the presence of tert-butylethylene as a hydrogen acceptor with the aid of Ru3(CO)12 as catalyst, the silylation proceeds at the position ortho to the oxazoline group, Eq. (66).[136a] The functional group compatibility of this reaction is high.This reaction is tolerant to both electron-donating (Me, OMe, and NMe2) and -withdrawing (CF3 and F) groups.
A variety of functional groups such as ester, amide, and imino, groups, and sp2 nitrogen in pyridine, imidazole,pyrazole, triazole, and tetrazole rings can be used as a directing group (Scheme 10). In nearly all cases, the corresponding ortho silylation products are obtained in good to excellent yields. 66 In the chelation-assisted CH/olefin coupling, -con- jugation between the benzene ring and the directing group is important. This working hypothesis is support- ed by experimental results[20b] and theoretical calcula- tions.[27] Interestingly, however, in the case of CH/SiR3 coupling, -conjugation is not essential. The silylation reaction of N,N-dimethylbenzylamine with triethylsi- lane gives the ortho silylation product, Eq. (67).[137] Some other aromatic compounds in which the directing group is not conjugated with the benzene ring can be silylated under the same reaction conditions.[137] 67 Scheme 9.

Ishikawa found that the Ni(PEt3)4-catalyzed reaction of aromatic compounds with 3,4-benzo-1,1,2,2-tetraethyl- 1,2-disilacyclobutene yields the 1-(diethylarylsilyl)-2- (diethylsilyl)benzene, Eq. (68).[138] The results of deute- rium-labeling experiments suggest that the o-quinodisi- lane-nickel complex, which may produce a bis(silyl)- nickel intermediate, is involved as a key intermediate in this reaction. Later, a similar intermediate was also proposed by Tanaka in the platinum-catalyzed silylation of arenes, Eq. (63).[133] In the case of the reaction of mesitylene, interestingly, the benzylic CH bond can be silylated to afford benzodisilacyclobutene, albeit in low yield (28% ). Platinum(0) complexes are effective as catalysts for this silylation reaction. 68 The regioselective silylation of aromatic imines with hexaorganodisilanes proceeds via chelation-assisted CH bond cleavage by a platinum complex.[139] The CH bonds undergo the silylation with exclusive ortho selectivity. In the case of the reaction of an imine having an electron-withdrawing group at the para position,silylation products are obtained in high yields, Eq. (69).
Murai reported on a unique system for the dehydro- genative silylation of heteroaromatic compounds in which triorganovinylsilane was used as a silylating reagent.[140] In this reaction, the vinyl moiety functions as a hydrogen acceptor. Thus, ethylene should be generated after the reaction. When the reaction of 3- acetylthiophene with trimethylvinylsilane is conducted using of Ru3(CO)12 as a catalyst, the silylation occurs at the 2-position of 3-acetylthiophene, Eq. (70). The im- portant step of this reaction is a -silyl elimination,yielding a metal-silyl species.[141] This silylation protocol using vinylsilanes can be applied only to heteroaromatic compounds. 69 5 Catalytic Borylation of CH Bonds Direct borylation of CH bonds is a highly active recent research subject in the catalytic use of CH bonds.
Hartwig reported the first representative result with respect to the borylation of CH bonds.[142] A stoichio- metric amount of transition metal boryl complex reacts with arenes under photo-irradiation conditions to give the corresponding arylboron compounds. Subsequently,they succeeded in the borylation of an sp3 CH bond in an alkane using Cp*W(CO)2B(OR)2 [(OR)2  1,2-
O2(C6H2-3,5-(CH3)2]
under photochemical condi- tions.[143] The first example of the catalytic version of the borylation reaction was accomplished in 1999, Eq. (71).[144] When the reaction of pentane with 4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5-octamethyl-2,2-bi-1,3,2-dioxaobolane (B2pin2) using Cp*Re(CO)3 as catalyst is conducted under photo-irradiation conditions, CB bond forma- tion occurs exclusively at the methyl CH bond. The co- presence of carbon monoxide (2 atm) suppresses the deactivation of the catalyst. A remarkable advance was achieved in 2000.[145] Hartwig reported on an ideal borylation reaction system. The reaction of octane with B2pin2 using Cp*Rh(4-C6Me6) as a catalyst, when conducted at 150C (no photo-irradiation) gives n- octylborane with perfect regioselectivity in high yield, Eq. (72). Pinacol-borane (Hbpin) can also be used as a borylating reagent. Hartwig×s results indicate that a new research area for alkane functionalization has appa- rently been created. 71 72 70 Catalytic Methods for CH Bond Functionalization

KGaA, Weinheim 1095 In the case of the borylation of arenes, one encounters again the inevitable problem of regioselectivity. The reaction of monosubstituted arenes with hydroboranes yields a mixture of regioisomers as experienced in the non-chelation-assisted silylation of arenes.[133,135] When 1,3-disubstitued arenes, e.g., 1,3-dichloro-, 1,3-dibromo-,and 1,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenes, are used in the reaction, CB bond formation occurs at the 5-position selectively, Eq. (73).[146] It is noteworthy that when the reaction of p-xylene with pinacol-borane is conducted in the presence of RhCl(PiPr3)2(N2) as a catalyst, boryla- tion occurs mainly at the benzyl CH bond [run 1 in Eq. (74)].[146c, 147] On the other hand,the use of Cp*Rh(4-C6Me6) as a catalyst results in the formation of a CB bond at the aromatic ring [run 2 in Eq. (74)].[146b] Very recently, Ishiyama reported that the presence of 4,4-di-tert-butyl-2,2-pipyridine (dtbpy) dramatically improves the activity of the iridium catalyst for aromatic CH/Bpin2 coupling.[148] Five-membered heteroaromatic compounds are also applicable to the borylation reaction.[148b] In this case, 2-boryl heteroaro- matic compounds are obtained exclusively in high yields.
The anion ligand on the iridium center is sensitive to the activity of the catalyst. The methoxy ligand highly improves the reactivity of the iridium complex. Indeed,the borylation proceeds at room temperature with high efficiency. 73 74 The CH/B(OR)2 coupling will certainly become a useful tool in organic synthesis because the boryl moiety can be converted to a hydroxy group by oxidation[149] and organoboron compounds are versatile synthetic reagents in the palladium-catalyzed coupling with organohalides (the so-called SuzukiMiyaura coupling).[150] 6 Conclusions The catalytic method for CH bond functionalization is obviously one of the simplest, most powerful methods in organic synthesis. From the synthetic point of view, CH/olefin, CH/acetylene, and CH/CO/olefin cou- plings can be regarded as practical tools since these reactions exhibit a high selectivity and efficiency, and a wide applicability, which are essential for practical organic synthesis.
During the past 40 years, CH bond cleavage, so- called CH bond activation was an intriguing research subject mainly for inorganic and organometallic chem- ists. Recently, this situation has dramatically changed. A variety of catalytic reactions involving CH bond cleavage have become popular and various types of transformation such as CH/olefin, CH/acetylene, CH/CO/olefin, CH/aryl, CH/SiR3,and
CH/
B(OR)2 couplings, and dehydrogenation of alkanes have appeared in the literature. The growth of this research area has been rapid, but the applicability of this type of coupling reaction to the synthesis of complex molecules is insufficient. Namely, many studies have been focused on investigations of the scope and limitations of these types of reactions.
Quite recently, some promising results have been reported. Sames utilized the CH bond for the synthesis of rhazinilam using a stoichiometric amount of a palladium complex, Eq. (75).[151] They also reported that the palladium-catalyzed oxidative functionaliza- 75 76
