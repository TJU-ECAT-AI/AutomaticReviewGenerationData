<p>The need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is pushing toward the use of renewable carbon, so to avoid as much as possible burning fossil carbon.</p>
<p>Such practice would fall into the utilization of renewable carbon, as the man-made process would perfectly mimic the natural process.</p>
<p>An order of complexity higher would be represented by the integration of biotechnology and catalysis for an effective CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes, or even whole microorganisms, coupled to chemical technologies for energy supply to enzymes, using perennial sources as sun or wind or geothermal as primary energy.</p>
<p>In the 1970s there was a revival in the exploitation of CO2 as additive to CO in the synthesis of methanol [4] and as co-monomer in the pioneering production of organic carbonates from epoxides [5], via direct carboxylation.</p>
<p>The reaction parameter space is defined by the following factors:i. Solvent; ii. co-reagents; iii. catalysts; iv. temperature; v. pressure; vi. overall energy expenditure-time of reaction; vii. conversion of reagents; viii. formation of co-products/selectivity of the process; ix. waste generation; and x. end of process separation energy.</p>
<p>Side-on coordination represents by far the most common bonding mode of CO2. In [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2] (Cy = cyclohexyl) [55],the first crystallographically characterized metalCO2 complex,the NiAC and NiAO1 bond distances are, respectively, 1.84 and 1.99 Å, showing that both carbon and one of the oxygen atoms are bound to the nickel center,which exhibits a planar coordination.</p>
<p>The structure of the g1-C complex Rh(diars)2(Cl)(CO2) provides an example of the behavior of CO2 ligand acting as a only- C-electrophile.</p>
