This is the case of the insertion of CO2 into MAO bond of metal- hydroxo (LnMAOH) and metal alkoxo (LnMAOR) complexes. The insertion reaction of CO2 into a covalent polar MAOH bond affords a hydrogen carbonate species (Eq. (26)) that can be stable or can react further. This reaction is strictly related to the conversion of CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3 and the elusive acid H2CO3, a transformation that plays a key role in the respiratory process of humans and animals.

Answer: The insertion of CO2 into the MAO bond of metal hydroxo and metal alkoxo complexes leads to the formation of a hydrogen carbonate species. This process is crucial for the conversion of CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3 and the elusive acid H2CO3, which is vital for the respiratory process in humans and animals.

The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands. The normal insertion mode affords metal-formates (E = H) or, more generally,metal-carboxylates (E = C), while the abnormal mode generates a metalla-carboxylic acid (E = H) or a metalla-ester (E = C).
</quotes>

Answer: The mode of CO2 insertion into the MAE bond (where E can be H or C) is influenced by the metal's properties and the auxiliary ligands. The normal mode yields metal formates (when E = H) or metal carboxylates (when E = C), whereas the abnormal mode produces metalla-carboxylic acids (when E = H) or metalla-esters (when E = C).

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
观察到的插入模式取决于MAE键（E=H，C）上的电荷分离，这可能由金属本身的性质及其辅助配体的特性严重地影响。正常插入模式产生金属形式酸（当E=H时）或金属羧酸盐（当E=C时），而异常模式则生成金属羧酸（当E=H时）或金属酯（当E=C时）。

The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2 catalyzed by tran- sition metal systems has much been investigated in the last twenty years. The interest toward such a process is mainly due to the potential of formic acid as hydrogen-carrier, as the two reactions,(i) carbon dioxide hydrogenation using molecular dihydrogen and (ii) decomposition of formic acid into the starting carbon diox- ide and dihydrogen, give a quasi-CO2-neutral cycle.

Answer: The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2, catalyzed by transition metal systems, has been extensively studied over the past two decades. The primary interest in this process stems from formic acid's potential as a hydrogen carrier. The two reactions involved, (i) the hydrogenation of CO2 using molecular hydrogen and (ii) the decomposition of formic acid back into CO2 and dihydrogen, result in a nearly CO2-neutral cycle.

This goal may be achieved through a judicious choice of the metal center, the ancillary ligands and the experi- mental conditions. For instance, in the presence of Ni(0), switching from PPh3 to less basic P(O-i-Pr)3 ancillary ligand allowed to obtain 2-methylene-3-vinylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid from butadiene and CO2 even catalytically, albeit in low yield and with a low turn- over (TON = 29) [153].
</quotes>

Answer: Achieving the goal can be done by carefully selecting the metal center, auxiliary ligands, and experimental conditions. For example, using Ni(0) and replacing the less basic P(O-i-Pr)3 auxiliary ligand from PPh3 led to the catalytic production of 2-methylene-3-vinylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid from butadiene and CO2, though with low yield and turnover (TON = 29) [153].
