<p>It is obvious that H2 cannot be derived from fossil C, but must come from water or organic waste, while energy must be supplied by perennial sources such as sun, wind, and geothermal.</p>
<p>Noticeably, the two classes are characterized by a distinct use of the products and a quite different size of their market. Class A species fall into the chemicals market, while Class B are fuels with a market that is some 1214 times that of chemicals.</p>
<p>The reaction of CO2 with basic amines is of particular interest, being exploited not only for up-taking CO2 from a gas stream, but also for synthetic purposes.</p>
<p>Under strictly anhydrous conditions, tertiary aliphatic amines do not absorb CO2, but aliphatic primary and secondary amines do and form the corresponding ammonium carbamates or the relevant carbamic acid which may be stabilized in a dimeric form through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, both in solution and in the solid state.</p>
<p>However, whether or not the coordination of CO2 is a prerequisite for further reaction depends on the kind of reaction CO2 has to undergo. For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation at O).</p>

This is the case of the insertion of CO2 into MAO bond of metal- hydroxo (LnMAOH) and metal alkoxo (LnMAOR) complexes. The insertion reaction of CO2 into a covalent polar MAOH bond affords a hydrogen carbonate species (Eq. (26)) that can be stable or can react further. This reaction is strictly related to the conversion of CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3 and the elusive acid H2CO3, a transformation that plays a key role in the respiratory process of humans and animals.

Answer: The insertion of CO2 into the MAO bond of metal hydroxo and metal alkoxo complexes leads to the formation of a hydrogen carbonate species. This process is crucial for the conversion of CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3 and the elusive acid H2CO3, which is vital for the respiratory process in humans and animals.

The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands. The normal insertion mode affords metal-formates (E = H) or, more generally,metal-carboxylates (E = C), while the abnormal mode generates a metalla-carboxylic acid (E = H) or a metalla-ester (E = C).
</quotes>

Answer: The mode of CO2 insertion into the MAE bond (where E can be H or C) is influenced by the metal's properties and the auxiliary ligands. The normal mode yields metal formates (when E = H) or metal carboxylates (when E = C), whereas the abnormal mode produces metalla-carboxylic acids (when E = H) or metalla-esters (when E = C).

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
观察到的插入模式取决于MAE键（E=H，C）上的电荷分离，这可能由金属本身的性质及其辅助配体的特性严重地影响。正常插入模式产生金属形式酸（当E=H时）或金属羧酸盐（当E=C时），而异常模式则生成金属羧酸（当E=H时）或金属酯（当E=C时）。

The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2 catalyzed by tran- sition metal systems has much been investigated in the last twenty years. The interest toward such a process is mainly due to the potential of formic acid as hydrogen-carrier, as the two reactions,(i) carbon dioxide hydrogenation using molecular dihydrogen and (ii) decomposition of formic acid into the starting carbon diox- ide and dihydrogen, give a quasi-CO2-neutral cycle.

This goal may be achieved through a judicious choice of the metal center, the ancillary ligands and the experi- mental conditions. For instance, in the presence of Ni(0), switching from PPh3 to less basic P(O-i-Pr)3 ancillary ligand allowed to obtain 2-methylene-3-vinylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid from butadiene and CO2 even catalytically, albeit in low yield and with a low turn- over (TON = 29) [153].
</quotes>

Answer: Achieving the goal can be done by carefully selecting the metal center, auxiliary ligands, and experimental conditions. For example, using Ni(0) and replacing the less basic P(O-i-Pr)3 auxiliary ligand from PPh3 led to the catalytic production of 2-methylene-3-vinylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid from butadiene and CO2, though with low yield and turnover (TON = 29) [153].

The direct carboxylation reactions are of great importance, and their exploitation may have favorable impact on the chemical industry allowing the synthesis of several large market products (for instance, acetic acid, benzoic acid, long chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids) through less tortu- ous and more C-efficient routes.
</quotes>

Answer: Direct carboxylation reactions are of great significance, and their utilization could have a positive impact on the chemical industry by enabling the synthesis of multiple high-demand products (such as acetic acid, benzoic acid, long-chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids) via less complex and more carbon-efficient methods.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
直接羧基化反应极为重要，其利用可能会对化学工业产生积极影响，通过更少曲折和更高碳效率的途径合成多种高需求产品（例如乙酸、苯甲酸、长链脂肪酸、二元酸）。

Noteworthy, also this industrial synthesis is not a catalytic process as 1 mol of Group 1 metal (Na or K) is used per mol of phenol.
</quotes>

Answer: Note that this industrial synthesis is not a catalytic process since it requires 1 mole of Group 1 metal (Na or K) per mole of phenol.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
值得注意的是，这种工业合成并非催化剂过程，因为它需要每摩尔酚1摩尔的组1金属（Na或K）。

The only industrial exploitation of reaction (40) is still provided by the KolbeSchmitt synthesis of hydroxybenzoic acids [185] carried out by reacting CO2 with Group 1 salts of phenol under severe conditions.
</quotes>

Answer: The sole industrial application of reaction (40) continues to be the Kolbe-Schmitt synthesis of hydroxybenzoic acids, which involves reacting CO2 with Group 1 salts of phenol under rigorous conditions.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
反应（40）唯一工业应用仍然是通过Kolbe-Schmitt合成水杨酸，其涉及在严格条件下用CO2与组1酚盐反应。

<quotes>
[1] "Synthesis of formic acid The use of CO2 as synthon in chemical synthesis for manufactur- ing bulk or fine chemicals has been pursued since the 1980s."
[2] "Any a priori attempt to foresee the behavior of reactive systems is a pure guess."
[3] "The thermal lability of CO2 complexes and their tendency to dissociate coordinated CO2 may add complexity and uncertainty to the problem."
[4] "For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation at O)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The use of CO2 as a synthon in chemical synthesis for manufacturing bulk or fine chemicals started in the 1980s. 
2. Predicting the behavior of reactive systems without conducting experiments is speculative.
3. The instability of CO2 complexes and their tendency to release coordinated CO2 can introduce complexity and unpredictability into the process.
4. Coordination to a metal center is essential for the reduction of CO2 to CO, either through oxygen transfer or protonation at oxygen.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 自1980年代以来，CO2被用作合成制造大宗或精细化学品的合成子。
2. 在没有进行实验的情况下预测反应系统的行为是推测性的。
3. CO2复合物的热不稳定性及其倾向性释放配位的CO2可以引入复杂性和不可预测性到过程中。
4. 对于将CO2还原为CO，无论是通过氧转移还是在氧上的质子化，都需要与金属中心的配位。
