[1] "Synthesis of formic acid The use of CO2 as synthon in chemical synthesis for manufactur- ing bulk or fine chemicals has been pursued since the 1980s."
[2] "Any a priori attempt to foresee the behavior of reactive systems is a pure guess."
[3] "The thermal lability of CO2 complexes and their tendency to dissociate coordinated CO2 may add complexity and uncertainty to the problem."
[4] "For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation at O)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The use of CO2 as a synthon in chemical synthesis for manufacturing bulk or fine chemicals started in the 1980s. 
2. Predicting the behavior of reactive systems without conducting experiments is speculative.
3. The instability of CO2 complexes and their tendency to release coordinated CO2 can introduce complexity and unpredictability into the process.
4. Coordination to a metal center is essential for the reduction of CO2 to CO, either through oxygen transfer or protonation at oxygen.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 自1980年代以来，CO2被用作合成制造大宗或精细化学品的合成子。
2. 在没有进行实验的情况下预测反应系统的行为是推测性的。
3. CO2复合物的热不稳定性及其倾向性释放配位的CO2可以引入复杂性和不可预测性到过程中。
4. 对于将CO2还原为CO，无论是通过氧转移还是在氧上的质子化，都需要与金属中心的配位。
