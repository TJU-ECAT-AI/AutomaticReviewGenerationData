[1] "The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands."
[2] "The whole matter still waits for a full rationalization."
[3] "This approach has been used also for the photocarboxylation of 2,3-dihydrofuran (2,3-DHF) to afford 25% yields 2,3-DHF-2-COOH."
[4] "The role of Lewis acids has been also investigated [141,142], and the activity of Pd systems has been explored [143]."

The observed insertion mode in the MAE bond (where E is hydrogen or carbon) is influenced by the properties of the metal and the auxiliary ligands. The underlying mechanism remains unclear and requires further investigation. The direct carboxylation of 2,3-dihydrofuran (2,3-DHF) using photocatalysis resulted in a yield of 25%. The effectiveness of Lewis acids and palladium systems has also been studied in the context of CO2 conversion processes.

在MAE键（其中E为氢或碳）中观察到的插入模式受到金属和辅助配体性质的影响。其背后的机制仍不清楚，需要进一步研究。通过光催化直接对2,3-二氢呋喃（2,3-DHF）进行羧基化得到了25%的产率。镧系酸和钯系统的作用效果也已被研究。
