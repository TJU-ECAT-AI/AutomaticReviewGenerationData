[1] "The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance must be kept under strict control, with the concept of avoided CO2 winning on that of used CO2."
[2] "The reaction parameter space is defined by the following factors:i. Solvent; ii. co-reagents; iii. catalysts; iv. temperature; v. pressure; vi. overall energy expenditure-time of reaction; vii. conversion of reagents; viii. formation of co-products/selectivity of the process; ix. waste generation; and x. end of process separation energy."
[3] "The stability of the MAC bond strongly depends on the donor properties of the metal center. Often g1-C complexes can be further stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between the O-atom of CO2 ligand and hydrogen donor centers [63]."
[4] "Examples of l-g1(O), g1(O) coordination have been also described and structurally characterized [68,69]."
[5] "Detailed mechanistic studies have shown that it proceeds instead through carbon dioxide decoordination, dioxygen coordination to Ni, and CO2 insertion into the OAO bond of the newly formed, reactive (PCy3)2Ni(O2) complex [84]."
[6] "The thermal lability of CO2 complexes and their tendency to dissociate coordinated CO2 may add complexity and uncertainty to the problem."
[7] "The role of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been extended to oxidative coupling of methane to ethane and ethylene and oxida- tive dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons (such as propane to propene) and there is still a lot of scope for its use in other reactions [83]."

1. The conversion of CO2 into chemicals and fuels is a complex issue due to the need to maintain strict control over the carbon balance, prioritizing avoided CO2 over used CO2.

2. The reaction parameter space includes factors such as solvent, co-reagents, catalysts, temperature, pressure, overall energy expenditure, conversion of reagents, formation of co-products, waste generation, and end of process separation energy.

3. The stability of the MAC bond in g1-C complexes depends on the donor properties of the metal center and can be further stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.

4. Coordination of CO2 to metal centers in g1-O or end-on (g1-O) modes has been described and structurally characterized in certain cases.

5. Mechanistic studies have shown that the reaction of (PCy3)2Ni(CO2) with dioxygen proceeds through carbon dioxide decoordination, dioxygen coordination to Ni, and CO2 insertion into the OAO bond rather than through O2 insertion into the NiAC bond.

6. The thermal instability of CO2 complexes and their tendency to dissociate can introduce complexity and uncertainty into the conversion process.

7. CO2 acts as a soft oxidant in processes such as oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, ethylene, and oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, with potential for broader application in other reactions.

1. 将CO2转化为化学品和燃料是一个复杂的问题，因为它需要严格控制碳平衡，优先考虑避免的CO2而不是使用的CO2。

2. 反应参数空间包括溶剂、共试剂、催化剂、温度、压力、总体能量消耗、反应物的转化率、副产品的形成、废物产生和过程结束时的能量分离等要素。

3. g1-C复合物中的MAC键的稳定性取决于金属中心的供体性质，并且可以通过分子内氢键相互作用进一步稳定。

4. 在某些情况下，已经描述并进行了结构表征了向金属中心的CO2在g1-O或末端（g1-O）模式的配合。

5. 详细的研究机制表明，(PCy3)2Ni(CO2)与氧气反应的过程是通过二氧化碳解配位，氧气与Ni的配位以及CO2插入到新形成的活性(PCy3)2Ni(O2)复合物的OAO键，而不是通过O2插入到NiAC键。

6. CO2复合物的热不稳定性及其倾向解离会引入复杂性和不确定性到转换过程。

7. CO2作为软氧化剂在甲烷氧化耦合到乙烷、乙烯以及各种烃类的氧化脱氢（如丙烷到丙烯）过程中发挥作用，并且在其他反应中还有很大的应用潜力。
