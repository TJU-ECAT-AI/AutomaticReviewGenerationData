<p>It is obvious that H2 cannot be derived from fossil C, but must come from water or organic waste, while energy must be supplied by perennial sources such as sun, wind, and geothermal.</p>
<p>Noticeably, the two classes are characterized by a distinct use of the products and a quite different size of their market. Class A species fall into the chemicals market, while Class B are fuels with a market that is some 1214 times that of chemicals.</p>
<p>The reaction of CO2 with basic amines is of particular interest, being exploited not only for up-taking CO2 from a gas stream, but also for synthetic purposes.</p>
<p>Under strictly anhydrous conditions, tertiary aliphatic amines do not absorb CO2, but aliphatic primary and secondary amines do and form the corresponding ammonium carbamates or the relevant carbamic acid which may be stabilized in a dimeric form through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, both in solution and in the solid state.</p>
<p>However, whether or not the coordination of CO2 is a prerequisite for further reaction depends on the kind of reaction CO2 has to undergo. For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation at O).</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Hydrogen cannot be produced from fossil carbon, but must come from water or organic waste. Perennial sources like sun, wind, and geothermal energy must supply the energy needed.
2. The two classes of CO2 reactions, Class A and Class B, have distinct uses and markets. Class A products are chemicals, while Class B products are fuels, with the fuel market being approximately 12-14 times larger than the chemical market.
3. Basic amines are utilized not just for absorbing CO2 from a gas stream, but also for synthetic purposes.
4. Under dry conditions, tertiary aliphatic amines do not absorb CO2, but primary and secondary aliphatic amines do and form ammonium carbamates or carbamic acids, which can be stabilized in a dimeric form through hydrogen bonding.
5. Coordination of CO2 to a metal center is necessary for the reduction of CO2 to CO, whether through oxygen transfer or protonation at oxygen.

1. 碳水化合物无法从化石碳中产生，但必须来自水或有机废物。太阳能、风能和地热等可再生能源必须提供能量。
2. CO2反应的两个类别，类别A和类别B，有各自不同的用途和市场。类别A的产品是化学品，而类别B的产品是燃料，燃料市场的规模大约是化学市场的12到14倍。
3. 基胺不仅用于吸收气体流中的CO2，还有合成用途。
4. 在干燥条件下，叔烷基胺不会吸收CO2，但是伯胺和仲胺会形成相应的铵盐或碳酸酸，这些酸可以通过分子间氢键在溶液和固体中稳定下来形成二聚体形式。
5. CO2与金属中心的配位对于将CO2还原为CO是必要的，无论是通过氧传递还是氧上的质子化。
