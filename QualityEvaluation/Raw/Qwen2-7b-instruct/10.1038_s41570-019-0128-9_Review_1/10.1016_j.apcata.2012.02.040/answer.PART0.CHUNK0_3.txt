[1] "On the other hand,conversion of CO2 via catalytic reactions is considered as one of the most promising approaches for CO2 abatement."
[2] "The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant will provide several potential advantages,which are normally encountered in conventional processes such as deep oxidation,low product selectivity and the formation of CO2 greenhouse gas as a by-product."
[3] "The mixed oxide supported vanadia sample exhibited superior acidbase bifunctionality;in particular,more numbers of medium strength acidbase sites were observed."
[4] "The reduction temperature of the vanadia was observed to decrease in the case of mixed oxide supported vanadia catalysts."
[5] "The mixed oxide supported vanadia sample exhibited a high conversion and product selectivity than its individual component oxide supported vanadia samples."
[6] "A significant difference in the catalyst activity was noted in the presence and absence (He) of CO2 feed gas."
[7] "The VOx/SnO2ZrO2 catalyst exhibited excellent performance (22.34 and 36.63% conversion of n-butane and selectivity of C4 olefins, respectively), which is attributed to a high specific surface area, superior acidbase bifunctionality and easily reducibility of the dispersed vanadium oxide."
