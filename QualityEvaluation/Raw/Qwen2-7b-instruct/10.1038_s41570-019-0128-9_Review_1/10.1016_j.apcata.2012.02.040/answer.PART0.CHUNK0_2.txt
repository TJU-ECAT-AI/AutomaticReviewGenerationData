[1] "In our previous studies, we have investigated the soft oxidant nature and promotional effect of CO2 in various reactions [36]."
[2] "The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant will provide several potential advantages, which are normally encountered in conventional processes such as deep oxidation, low product selectivity, and the formation of CO2 greenhouse gas as a by-product [7]."
[3] "Moreover, the utilization of CO2 in the ODH process can encompass several prominent features like alleviating the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, minimizing the hot spot phenomenon on the catalyst surface, poisoning the nonselective sites of the catalysts, accelerating the reaction rate, enhancing the selectivity, and suppressing the total oxidation products [4,8-11]."
[4] "Recently, Urlan et al. [24] studied the effect of CO2 on the catalytic ODH of n-butane with oxygen over TiP2O7 catalysts."
[5] "The VMgO catalyst has also shown a poor n-butane conversion with CO2 despite a high selectivity to C4 olefins [25]."
[6] "The promoting effect of CO2 was noticed on butenes yield over oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts [13]."
[7] "The acid-base and textural properties of the supports strongly affect the catalytic performance."
[8] "The mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts also displayed superior ODH activity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement in the acid-base bifunctional behavior [17]."
[9] "Trimm and Gabbay [26] studied oxidation of butene isomers over a SnSb mixed oxide catalyst and concluded that Sn4+ plays an important role in the oxidation of n-butenes."
[10] "Moreover, SnO2 shows a significant role in improving the dispersion and reducibility of the surface vanadium oxide [27]."
[11] "The combination of SnO2 and ZrO2 also offered better catalytic activity for the ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene than those of constituent single oxides [6,17]."
[12] "The catalytic performance of vanadium oxide catalysts depends on the acid-base character of the supporting materials [28]."
[13] "Therefore, a combination catalyst consisting of V2O5 and SnO2ZrO2 were undertaken in the present investigation against the aforesaid background."
[14] "Based on the above stated arguments, we have undertaken SnO2ZrO2 supported VOx materials for the ODH of n-butane with CO2."

The document compares the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. The comparisons focus on activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms, while also considering the roles of support materials, composition, and structural factors in determining their performance. Challenges and potential for improvement are also discussed.

In the context of CO2-ODH reactions, FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, show competitive performance compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The document highlights the importance of support materials, composition, and structure in influencing the catalytic performance. It emphasizes that the acid-base and textural properties of the supports significantly affect the catalytic activity. The use of mixed oxide nanocomposites, like SnO2ZrO2, demonstrates superior activity compared to their individual components due to enhanced acid-base bifunctionality. Additionally, the role of specific elements, such as Sn4+, in improving dispersion and reducibility of surface vanadium oxide is acknowledged. The document also notes that the combination of SnO2 and ZrO2 offers better catalytic activity for certain reactions compared to their constituent single oxides. These findings suggest that the design of catalysts with optimized support materials and compositions could lead to improved performance in CO2-ODH reactions.
