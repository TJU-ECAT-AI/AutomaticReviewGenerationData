[1] "Vanadium oxide based materials are very often used as catalysts in the ODH reactions."
[2] "The mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts also displayed superior ODH activity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement in the acidbase bifunctionality."
[3] "The acidbase and textural properties of the supports strongly affect the catalytic performance."
[4] "The catalytic performance of vanadium oxide catalysts depends on the acidbase character of the supporting materials."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The use of vanadium oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions is common. Mixed oxide nanocomposites show superior ODH activity compared to their individual components due to enhanced acid-base functionality. The acid-base and textural characteristics of the supports significantly influence the catalyst's performance. The effectiveness of vanadium oxide catalysts relies heavily on the acidic-basic properties of the supporting materials.

在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，使用钒氧化物催化剂很常见。混合氧化物纳米复合材料的ODH活性高于其单个组分，这是由于酸基功能性的增强。支持材料的酸碱性和纹理性质强烈影响催化剂的性能。钒氧化物催化剂的有效性很大程度上依赖于支持材料的酸碱特性。
