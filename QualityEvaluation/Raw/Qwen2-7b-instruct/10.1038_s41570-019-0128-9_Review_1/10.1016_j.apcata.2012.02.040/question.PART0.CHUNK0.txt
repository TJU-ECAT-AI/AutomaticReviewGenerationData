The acidbase properties,reducibility,surface area  and  morphology of  the  SnO2ZrO2 mixed oxide  and its individual component oxide supported vanadium oxide  samples were  thoroughly studied.
The mixed  oxide  supported vanadia sample exhibited superior acidbase bifunctionality;in  particular,  more numbers of  medium strength acidbase sites  were  observed.
The  reduction temperature of  the  vanadia was  observed to decrease in  the case of  mixed oxide  supported vanadia catalysts.
The mixed oxide supported vanadia sample exhibited a high conversion and  product selectivity than its  individual component oxide  supported vanadia samples.
A
significant difference in  the  catalyst  activity  was  noted in  the  presence and  absence (He)  of  CO2 feed gas.
Among various catalysts evaluated,the  VOx/SnO2ZrO2 catalyst exhibited excellent performance (22.34 and
36.63%  conversion
of  n-butane and  selectivity of  C4  olefins,respectively),which is attributed to a  high specific surface area,superior acidbase bifunctionality and  easily reducibility of  the  dispersed vanadium oxide. 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction The rising level of carbon dioxide
(CO2)
in the atmosphere has a detrimental effect on the environment,mainly contributing to global warming [1].  Reducing the release of CO2 and implement- ing CO2 recycling techniques have therefore become increasingly important.
On the other hand,conversion of CO2 via catalytic reac- tions is considered as one of the most promising approaches for CO2 abatement.
Recently,much attention has been devoted toward utilization of CO2 as an oxygen source or non-traditional (soft) oxi- dant and oxygen transfer agent [2,3].
In our previous studies,we have investigated the soft oxidant nature and promotional effect of CO2 in various reactions [36].
The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxi- dant will provide several potential advantages,which are normally encountered in conventional processes such as deep oxidation,low product selectivity and the formation of CO2 greenhouse gas as a by-product [7].  Moreover,the utilization of CO2 in the
ODH
pro- cess can encompass several prominent features like alleviating the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations,minimizing the hot spot phenomenon on the catalyst surface,poisoning the nonselective sites of the catalysts,accelerating the reaction rate,enhancing the Corresponding author.

(S.-E.
Park). selectivity and suppressing the total oxidation products [4,811].
On the other hand,such consumption of CO2 shows a significant positive impact on the global carbon balance.
The unsaturated hydrocarbons are most important building block chemicals in the industry.
Among the paraffins,n-butane is the least intensively studied alkane in the
ODH
processes where CO2 is used as an oxidant.
In the dehydrogenation of higher alka- nes,generally the produced olefins contain allylic hydrogen.
The bond dissociation energy of allylic hydrogen is much lower than that of the starting substrate.
Thus,the abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to produce coke precursors.
Therefore,avoidance of the deactivation of the catalyst is very difficult,which consequently results low yields of olefins [12,13].  Moreover,the formed alkenes are approximately four times more reactive than butane.
The high reactivity of alkenes causes the lower selectivity to the desired products with increasing the conversion of butane [14].
Therefore,design of a selective cat- alyst with high yields of alkenes remained a challenge in catalysis.
Vanadium oxide based materials are very often used as cata- lysts in the
ODH
reactions [15].
We  have also studied various vanadium oxide based catalysts for the
ODH
of aromatic hydro- carbons [46,8,16,17].
Various vanadium oxide catalytic systems such as VMgO [18], VOx/SiO2 [19], VOx/Al2O3 [20], V2O5/ZrO2 [21], VOx/SBA15 [22] and VOx/USY [23] were reported in the liter- ature for the synthesis of

General 423 424 (2012) 168 175 169 cis-2-butene and 1,3-butadiene) from n-butane with or without oxidant
(O2).
Recently, Urlan et al.
[24] studied the effect of
CO2
on the catalytic
ODH
of n-butane with oxygen over TiP2O7 cata- lysts.
A
decrease in the catalytic activity with carbon dioxide as the unique oxidant (absence of oxygen) was noted over the TiP2O7 catalysts.
The VMgO catalyst has also shown a poor n-butane conversion with CO2 despite a high selectivity to
C4
olefins [25].
The sole presence of oxygen only tends to increase the activity of these catalysts.
The poor activity of the catalysts in the presence of CO2 may be due to the lack of reoxidation efficiency of the cata- lyst surface owing to strong adsorption of CO2 on the surface [24].
The promoting effect of CO2 was noticed on butenes yield over oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts [13].
The acidbase and textural properties of the supports strongly affect the catalytic performance.
The mixed oxide nanocomposite cat- alysts also displayed superior
ODH
activity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement in the acidbase bifunc- tional behavior [17].
The ZrO2 based mixed oxides;particularly,the TiO2ZrO2 mixed oxide is very promising for
ODH
of ethylben- zene to styrene with CO2 as the soft oxidant [6].  Trimm and Gabbay [26] studied oxidation of butene isomers over a SnSb mixed oxide catalyst and concluded that Sn4+ plays an important role in the oxidation of n-butenes.
Moreover, SnO2 shows a significant role in improving the dispersion and reducibility of the surface vanadium oxide [27].
The combination of SnO2 and ZrO2 also offered bet- ter catalytic activity for the
ODH
of ethylbenzene to styrene than those of constituent single oxides [6,17].
The catalytic performance of vanadium oxide catalysts depends on the acidbase character of the supporting materials [28].
Therefore,a combination catalyst consisting of V2O5 and SnO2ZrO2 were undertaken in the present investigation against the aforesaid background.
Based on the above stated arguments,we have undertaken SnO2ZrO2 supported VOx materials for the
ODH
of n-butane with
CO2.
The desired SnO2, ZrO2 and SnO2ZrO2 supports were synthesized by precipitation and coprecipitation methods,respec- tively.
V2O5 was deposited on the supports by a wet impregnation method.
The structural evaluation of the catalysts were thoroughly studied using various physiochemical techniques namely,pow- der X-ray diffraction
(XRD),
BrunauerEmmettTeller

surface area, CO2 and NH3 temperature preprogrammed desorption
(CO2-

and
NH3-TPD),
temperature preprogrammed reduction

and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM).
The catalytic perfor- mance was evaluated for the
ODH
of n-butane to
C4
olefins in the vapor phase under normal atmospheric pressure employing CO2 as the soft oxidant.

Preparation of catalysts The SnO2ZrO2 (SZ) mixed oxide supports (mole ratio of SnO2/ZrO2 = 1/9,
1.5/8.5,
3/7 and 5/5,abbreviated as
SZ(X/Y),
where
X/Y
= SnO2/ZrO2 mole ratio) were synthesized by adopting a copre- cipitation method from aqueous solutions of ZrOCl2 and SnCl4 (all are from Aldrich,
GR
grade) by hydrolysis with aqueous ammo- nium hydroxide solution.
In a typical synthetic procedure,required amounts of chloride precursors were dissolved in deionized water separately to form
0.1
M
aqueous metal salt solutions under vigor- ous stirring at room temperature.
Both the solutions were mixed and stirred further for 1 h to ensure the formation of homogeneous solution.
To this mixed metal salts solution,dilute aqueous ammo- nium hydroxide was added drop wise in a controlled manner under vigorous stirring until the attainment of pH 9,and the stirring was continued further 2 h.
The resultant white precipitate gel was aged for 15 h at room temperature.
The resulting mixed precipitate gel was separated by centrifugation and dried at
100 C
for 12 h.
Finally,the material was calcined at
600 C
for 8 h at a rate of 2 C/min in static air.
The pure ZrO2 and SnO2 supports were also synthesized in the same manner mentioned above.
On the calcined supports, V2O5 was deposited by adopting a standard wet impregnation method.

(abbreviated as

SZ(1.5/8.5)
(abbreviated as
5VSZ(1.5/8.5))
were synthesized by a wet impreg- nation method.
To achieve this,the desired amount of ammonium metavanadate (Aldrich) was dissolved in aqueous oxalic acid solu- tion to which the finely powdered support was added under continuous stirring.
The excess solvent was removed on a water- bath under vigorous stirring.
Finally,the resulting material was oven dried at
100 C
for 12 h,subsequently calcined at
600 C
for 5 h at a heating rate of 2 C/min in static air to obtain the final catalyst.
