This study highlights that chromium oxide supported on a Na-type ZSM-5 zeolite with a smaller crystal size (approximately 400 nm) is an effective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. The enhanced activity of this catalyst is attributed to a significantly higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species compared to a catalyst supported on ZSM-5 with larger crystal size. The use of CO2 as an oxidant in this process is advantageous due to its ecological benefits, as CO2, a major greenhouse gas, is converted to CO, a more valuable chemical feedstock. The superior performance of the catalyst is explained by the redox mechanism involving the reduction of Cr(VI) species by propane and subsequent reoxidation by CO2, which shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the formation of propylene. The combination of Raman spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance UVVis, XPS, and H2-TPR techniques confirms the higher content of Cr(VI) species on the smaller-crystal-size ZSM-5-supported catalyst, contributing to its higher activity in the propane dehydrogenation process.

这项研究指出，Na型ZSM-5沸石上具有较小晶粒尺寸（约400nm）的铬氧化物支持是丙烷脱氢到丙烯与CO2反应的有效催化剂。该催化剂的增强活性归因于表面Cr(VI)物种浓度显著高于在较大晶粒尺寸的ZSM-5支持下的催化剂。将CO2用作氧化剂在这个过程中具有生态优势，因为作为主要温室气体的CO2被转换为CO，这是一种更宝贵的化学原料。该催化剂性能优越的原因是通过Cr(VI)物种由丙烷还原和随后由CO2重新氧化的还原-氧化机制，这将脱氢平衡推向丙烯形成的方向。结合拉曼光谱、紫外可见漫反射、XPS和H2-TPR技术证实了较小晶粒尺寸的ZSM-5支持催化剂表面Cr(VI)物种含量更高，这对其在丙烷脱氢过程中的高活性起到了关键作用。
