[1] "Combined Raman, diffuse reflectance UVVis, XPS and H2-TPR results demonstrate that the former catalyst has a much higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species than the latter one, which accounts for its superior catalytic performance."
[2] "The much higher amount of Cr(VI) species observed on the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst than Cr/ZSM-5-L could be related to a much greater external surface area of the former catalyst (Table 1) and a higher concentration of terminal silanol on the external surface of ZSM-5 zeolite with smaller crystal size [33]."
[3] "The major product formed in the reaction is propylene, and the minor products are ethane,ethylene and methane. At the beginning of the reaction, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity on Cr/ZSM-5-S and Cr/ZSM-5-L catalysts are 48.3%, 86.0% and 11.3%, 92.8%, respectively."
[4] "This result confirms the conclusion that the reduction of Cr(VI) plays an important role for the deactivation of Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst."

1. The ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those with smaller crystal size, exhibit superior catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2. This is attributed to the higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species on the catalyst, which correlates with its larger external surface area and higher concentration of terminal silanol on the zeolite's external surface.

2. The Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst shows a significantly higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to the Cr/ZSM-5-L catalyst. At the start of the reaction, the conversion rates are 48.3% and 11.3%, while the propylene selectivities are 86.0% and 92.8%, respectively.

3. The reduction of Cr(VI) species to Cr(III) plays a critical role in the deactivation of the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst. This conclusion is supported by experimental evidence that demonstrates a decrease in propane conversion and an increase in the amount of coke formed on the catalyst surface.

4. After regeneration of the used Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst by re-calcination in flowing air, the original activity of the catalyst is fully restored, confirming the importance of removing carbon species deposited on the catalyst and completely re-oxidizing the reduced Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species.

1. 小晶粒尺寸的ZSM-5负载铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯与二氧化碳反应中表现出优越的催化性能。这是由于催化剂表面Cr(VI)物种的高浓度所致，这与它较大的外表面面积和小晶粒尺寸下ZSM-5沸石外部表面更高的端硅醇浓度相关。

2. Cr/ZSM-5-S催化剂在反应初期的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性显著高于Cr/ZSM-5-L催化剂。初始时，转化率分别为48.3%和11.3%，而丙烯选择性分别为86.0%和92.8%。

3. Cr/ZSM-5-S催化剂的活性下降主要由两个因素造成：碳沉积在催化剂表面以及Cr(VI)物种被还原为Cr(III)物种。实验结果证实了Cr(VI)物种的还原对Cr/ZSM-5-S催化剂的失活具有重要作用。

4. 在流动空气中的再煅烧后再生的Cr/ZSM-5-S催化剂，其原始活性完全恢复，确认了去除催化剂表面沉积的碳物种和完全将还原的Cr(III)物种重新氧化为Cr(VI)物种的重要性。
