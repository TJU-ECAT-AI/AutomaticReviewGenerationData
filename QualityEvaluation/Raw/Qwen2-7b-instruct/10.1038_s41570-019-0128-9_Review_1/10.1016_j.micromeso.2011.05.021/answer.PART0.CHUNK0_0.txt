[1] "The inherent drawbacks of the propane dehydrogenation process are equilibrium limitations regarding propane conversion, large energy consumption due to endothermic reaction and rapid catalyst deactivation owing to coke formation."
[2] "Alternatively, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is free from thermodynamic constraints and can be operated at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction."
[3] "However, this process suffers from a significant loss of propylene selectivity due to the overoxidation of propane to carbon dioxide in the reaction."
[4] "In the latter case CO2 removes hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation, and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propylene formation."
[5] "Moreover, the use of CO2 in the feed is also ecological, because in this new process CO2, one of the major greenhouse gases, is reduced to CO which is more valuable in chemical industry."
[6] "Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
[7] "Attention has been recently focused on employing mesoporous silica materials as catalyst supports to disperse chromium species, such as MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, and MSU-x due to their high surface areas, uniform mesopore size and relatively high thermal stability."
[8] "However, it is well known that the potential disadvantage of these siliceous mesoporous materials is relatively poor hydrothermal stability."
[9] "In continuation of our interest in exploring the applications of ZSM-5-supported oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2, in the present work, we report for the first time the use of ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide as a new efficient catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."
[10] "Our results have shown that the crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound effect on the catalytic activity."

The study demonstrates that ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide catalysts are highly effective for propane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2. These catalysts exhibit significantly higher activity compared to chromium oxide supported on ZSM-5 with larger crystal size. The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to a higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species, which is closely related to the smaller crystal size of the ZSM-5 support. The results also suggest that besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) species contributes to the catalyst deactivation. The study highlights the importance of considering factors such as support materials, composition, and structural characteristics in optimizing catalyst performance for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation reactions.

本研究显示，ZSM-5负载的铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢为丙烯与二氧化碳反应中表现出高度有效性。这些催化剂的活性显著高于在较大晶粒尺寸ZSM-5上负载的铬氧化物。增强的催化性能归因于表面Cr(VI)物种的更高浓度，这与ZSM-5支持体的较小晶粒尺寸密切相关。结果还表明，除了焦炭形成之外，Cr(VI)物种还原到Cr(III)物种是催化剂失活的另一个原因。研究强调了在优化CO2辅助脱氢反应催化剂性能时考虑因素如支撑材料、组成和结构特性的重要性。
