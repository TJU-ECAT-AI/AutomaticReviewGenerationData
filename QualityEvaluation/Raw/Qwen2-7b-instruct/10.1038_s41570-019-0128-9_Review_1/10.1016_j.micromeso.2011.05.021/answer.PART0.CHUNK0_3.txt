[1] "It has been shown that in this new process propylene can be obtained with a rather high selectivity."
[2] "The inherent drawbacks of the propane dehydrogenation process are equilibrium limitations regarding propane conversion, large energy consumption due to endothermic reaction and rapid catalyst deactivation owing to coke formation."
[3] "Over the last decade, the utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has gained increasing interest."
[4] "The supporting chromium oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
[5] "Combined Raman, diffuse reflectance UVVis, XPS and H2-TPR results demonstrate that the former catalyst has a much higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species than the latter one, which accounts for its superior catalytic performance."

This study explores the use of ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of carbon dioxide. The research highlights that chromium oxide supported on Na-type ZSM-5 with smaller crystal size (approximately 400 nm) exhibits a high catalytic performance, significantly more active than chromium oxide supported on ZSM-5 with larger crystal size (approximately 2 μm). The enhanced activity is attributed to a higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species. The study also reveals that the reduction of Cr(VI) species to Cr(III) is another factor contributing to the catalyst's deactivation. The findings suggest that the crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound impact on the catalytic activity.

本研究探讨了使用ZSM-5负载型铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳存在下进行丙烷脱氢制丙烯的过程。研究表明，粒径约为400纳米的Na型ZSM-5负载型铬氧化物具有良好的催化性能，活性显著高于粒径约为2微米的ZSM-5负载型铬氧化物。增强的活性归因于表面Cr(VI)物种浓度的提高。研究还发现，Cr(VI)物种还原为Cr(III)是催化剂失活的另一个原因。研究结果表明，ZSM-5支持体的晶粒大小对催化活性有深远影响。
