The utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has gained increasing interest over the last decade. This process allows for the production of propylene with a high selectivity. Carbon dioxide has been shown to have a promoting effect on propane dehydrogenation reactions on various catalysts, including silica-supported chromium(II) oxide, rare earth vanadates, gallium oxide, titanium oxide-supported gallium oxide, and indium oxide-aluminum oxide mixed oxide. In the process where carbon dioxide removes hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation, it shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards propylene formation. The use of carbon dioxide in this process is ecological because it converts one of the major greenhouse gases into carbon, which is more valuable in chemical industry. Among the studied catalysts, supported chromium-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. The crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a significant impact on the catalytic activity.

在过去的十年中，将二氧化碳作为选择性脱氢制丙烯的温和氧化剂的利用引起了越来越多的关注。这一过程允许以较高的选择性生产丙烯。二氧化碳已在多种催化剂上显示出促进丙烷脱氢反应的作用，包括二氧化硅支持的铬（II）氧化物、稀土钒酸盐、镓氧化物、钛氧化物支持的镓氧化物、以及铟氧化物-铝氧化物混合氧化物。在二氧化碳移除由丙烷脱氢产生的氢气的情况下，它将脱氢平衡向丙烯形成方向转移的过程。使用二氧化碳在这个过程中是生态友好的，因为它将主要温室气体之一转化为更具有化学工业价值的碳。在所有研究的催化剂中，支持的铬基材料已被证明是最有前景的，因为它们具有高催化活性。ZSM-5支持体的晶粒尺寸对催化活性有显著影响。
