[1] "The inherent drawbacks of the propane dehydrogenation process are equilibrium limitations regarding propane conversion, large energy consumption due to endothermic reaction and rapid catalyst deactivation owing to coke formation."
[2] "Alternatively, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is free from thermodynamic constraints and can be operated at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction."
[3] "However, this process suffers from a significant loss of propylene selectivity due to the overoxidation of propane to carbon dioxide in the reaction."
[4] "In the latter case CO2 removes hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation, and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propylene formation."
[5] "Moreover, the use of CO2 in the feed is also ecological, because in this new process CO2, one of the major greenhouse gases, is reduced to CO which is more valuable in chemical industry."
[6] "Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
[7] "Attention has been recently focused on employing mesoporous silica materials as catalyst supports to disperse chromium species, such as MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, and MSU-x due to their high surface areas, uniform mesopore size and relatively high thermal stability."
[8] "However, it is well known that the potential disadvantage of these siliceous mesoporous materials is relatively poor hydrothermal stability."
[9] "In continuation of our interest in exploring the applications of ZSM-5-supported oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2, in the present work, we report for the first time the use of ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide as a new efficient catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."
[10] "Our results have shown that the crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound effect on the catalytic activity."

The study demonstrates that ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide catalysts are highly effective for propane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2. These catalysts exhibit significantly higher activity compared to chromium oxide supported on ZSM-5 with larger crystal size. The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to a higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species, which is closely related to the smaller crystal size of the ZSM-5 support. The results also suggest that besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) species contributes to the catalyst deactivation. The study highlights the importance of considering factors such as support materials, composition, and structural characteristics in optimizing catalyst performance for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation reactions.

本研究显示，ZSM-5负载的铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢为丙烯与二氧化碳反应中表现出高度有效性。这些催化剂的活性显著高于在较大晶粒尺寸ZSM-5上负载的铬氧化物。增强的催化性能归因于表面Cr(VI)物种的更高浓度，这与ZSM-5支持体的较小晶粒尺寸密切相关。结果还表明，除了焦炭形成之外，Cr(VI)物种还原到Cr(III)物种是催化剂失活的另一个原因。研究强调了在优化CO2辅助脱氢反应催化剂性能时考虑因素如支撑材料、组成和结构特性的重要性。

[1] "Combined Raman, diffuse reflectance UVVis, XPS and H2-TPR results demonstrate that the former catalyst has a much higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species than the latter one, which accounts for its superior catalytic performance."
[2] "The much higher amount of Cr(VI) species observed on the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst than Cr/ZSM-5-L could be related to a much greater external surface area of the former catalyst (Table 1) and a higher concentration of terminal silanol on the external surface of ZSM-5 zeolite with smaller crystal size [33]."
[3] "The major product formed in the reaction is propylene, and the minor products are ethane,ethylene and methane. At the beginning of the reaction, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity on Cr/ZSM-5-S and Cr/ZSM-5-L catalysts are 48.3%, 86.0% and 11.3%, 92.8%, respectively."
[4] "This result confirms the conclusion that the reduction of Cr(VI) plays an important role for the deactivation of Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst."

1. The ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those with smaller crystal size, exhibit superior catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2. This is attributed to the higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species on the catalyst, which correlates with its larger external surface area and higher concentration of terminal silanol on the zeolite's external surface.

2. The Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst shows a significantly higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to the Cr/ZSM-5-L catalyst. At the start of the reaction, the conversion rates are 48.3% and 11.3%, while the propylene selectivities are 86.0% and 92.8%, respectively.

3. The reduction of Cr(VI) species to Cr(III) plays a critical role in the deactivation of the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst. This conclusion is supported by experimental evidence that demonstrates a decrease in propane conversion and an increase in the amount of coke formed on the catalyst surface.

4. After regeneration of the used Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst by re-calcination in flowing air, the original activity of the catalyst is fully restored, confirming the importance of removing carbon species deposited on the catalyst and completely re-oxidizing the reduced Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species.

1. 小晶粒尺寸的ZSM-5负载铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯与二氧化碳反应中表现出优越的催化性能。这是由于催化剂表面Cr(VI)物种的高浓度所致，这与它较大的外表面面积和小晶粒尺寸下ZSM-5沸石外部表面更高的端硅醇浓度相关。

2. Cr/ZSM-5-S催化剂在反应初期的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性显著高于Cr/ZSM-5-L催化剂。初始时，转化率分别为48.3%和11.3%，而丙烯选择性分别为86.0%和92.8%。

3. Cr/ZSM-5-S催化剂的活性下降主要由两个因素造成：碳沉积在催化剂表面以及Cr(VI)物种被还原为Cr(III)物种。实验结果证实了Cr(VI)物种的还原对Cr/ZSM-5-S催化剂的失活具有重要作用。

4. 在流动空气中的再煅烧后再生的Cr/ZSM-5-S催化剂，其原始活性完全恢复，确认了去除催化剂表面沉积的碳物种和完全将还原的Cr(III)物种重新氧化为Cr(VI)物种的重要性。

[2] "It has been proposed that Cr(VI) species are responsible for the high catalytic activities of supported chro- mia catalysts in the light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant, and Cr(VI) monochromate is more active than Cr(III) polychromate."
[3] "In the latter case CO2 removes hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation, and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propylene formation."

This study highlights that chromium oxide supported on a Na-type ZSM-5 zeolite with a smaller crystal size (approximately 400 nm) is an effective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. The enhanced activity of this catalyst is attributed to a significantly higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species compared to a catalyst supported on ZSM-5 with larger crystal size. The use of CO2 as an oxidant in this process is advantageous due to its ecological benefits, as CO2, a major greenhouse gas, is converted to CO, a more valuable chemical feedstock. The superior performance of the catalyst is explained by the redox mechanism involving the reduction of Cr(VI) species by propane and subsequent reoxidation by CO2, which shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the formation of propylene. The combination of Raman spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance UVVis, XPS, and H2-TPR techniques confirms the higher content of Cr(VI) species on the smaller-crystal-size ZSM-5-supported catalyst, contributing to its higher activity in the propane dehydrogenation process.

这项研究指出，Na型ZSM-5沸石上具有较小晶粒尺寸（约400nm）的铬氧化物支持是丙烷脱氢到丙烯与CO2反应的有效催化剂。该催化剂的增强活性归因于表面Cr(VI)物种浓度显著高于在较大晶粒尺寸的ZSM-5支持下的催化剂。将CO2用作氧化剂在这个过程中具有生态优势，因为作为主要温室气体的CO2被转换为CO，这是一种更宝贵的化学原料。该催化剂性能优越的原因是通过Cr(VI)物种由丙烷还原和随后由CO2重新氧化的还原-氧化机制，这将脱氢平衡推向丙烯形成的方向。结合拉曼光谱、紫外可见漫反射、XPS和H2-TPR技术证实了较小晶粒尺寸的ZSM-5支持催化剂表面Cr(VI)物种含量更高，这对其在丙烷脱氢过程中的高活性起到了关键作用。

The utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has gained increasing interest over the last decade. This process allows for the production of propylene with a high selectivity. Carbon dioxide has been shown to have a promoting effect on propane dehydrogenation reactions on various catalysts, including silica-supported chromium(II) oxide, rare earth vanadates, gallium oxide, titanium oxide-supported gallium oxide, and indium oxide-aluminum oxide mixed oxide. In the process where carbon dioxide removes hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation, it shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards propylene formation. The use of carbon dioxide in this process is ecological because it converts one of the major greenhouse gases into carbon, which is more valuable in chemical industry. Among the studied catalysts, supported chromium-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. The crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a significant impact on the catalytic activity.

在过去的十年中，将二氧化碳作为选择性脱氢制丙烯的温和氧化剂的利用引起了越来越多的关注。这一过程允许以较高的选择性生产丙烯。二氧化碳已在多种催化剂上显示出促进丙烷脱氢反应的作用，包括二氧化硅支持的铬（II）氧化物、稀土钒酸盐、镓氧化物、钛氧化物支持的镓氧化物、以及铟氧化物-铝氧化物混合氧化物。在二氧化碳移除由丙烷脱氢产生的氢气的情况下，它将脱氢平衡向丙烯形成方向转移的过程。使用二氧化碳在这个过程中是生态友好的，因为它将主要温室气体之一转化为更具有化学工业价值的碳。在所有研究的催化剂中，支持的铬基材料已被证明是最有前景的，因为它们具有高催化活性。ZSM-5支持体的晶粒尺寸对催化活性有显著影响。
