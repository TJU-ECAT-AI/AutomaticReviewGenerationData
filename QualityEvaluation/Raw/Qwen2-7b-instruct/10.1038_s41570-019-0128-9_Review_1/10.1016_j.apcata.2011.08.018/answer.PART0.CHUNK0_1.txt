[1] "An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials, where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system."
[2] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst."
[3] "It is also suggested that acid-base properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene."
[4] "Detailed correlation of characterization results and PDH activities performed reveals the abundance of highly dispersed indium-species and acid-base properties are two key parameters that determine the high PDH performance for the In-based catalysts."

The In-based catalysts, particularly those with indium oxide loaded on aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, and silica, exhibit a unique bifunctional character with a balance between metallic indium species and bulk indium oxide phase, which is crucial for efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation. The choice of support, such as aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, and silica, influences the dispersion and electronic properties of the active species, thereby tuning the catalytic performance. Acid-base properties of the supports significantly impact the selectivity towards propylene production. High dispersion of indium species and balanced acid-base properties are essential parameters determining the high performance of these In-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
