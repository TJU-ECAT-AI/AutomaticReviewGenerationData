[1] "Light alkenes such as propylene are important building blocks in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications thus,their demand is high [1,2]."
[2] "A great deal of attention has been paid to the so-called on-purpose propylene production technologies,such as propane dehydrogenation [3,4],due to their potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers where propylene is produced as a byproduct of ethylene."
[3] "However,due to the thermodynamic constrains of PDH reaction,high reaction tem- perature is frequently used,which inevitably leads to severe coke formation as well as undesired thermal cracking to lighter alkanes [5,6]."
[4] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane by molecular oxygen,which allows significantly lower reaction temperature and effective inhibition of coke deposition [7]."
[5] "Nevertheless,significant loss of propylene selectivity due to deep oxidation to carbon oxides is inevitably accompanied,existing as the main drawback of this process [1]."
[6] "To circumvent this problem,carbon dioxide (CO2),one of the most important green-house gases,has been proposed to be a promising candidate as milder oxidant replacing oxygen in activation of light alkanes,including coupling of methane,dehydration (DH) of ethylbenzene,iso-propylbenzene,propane,or iso-butane [8]."
[7] "On the other hand,contrarily to what is traditionally believed, CO2 is not inert in the oxidation reaction. Oxygen species produced by its dissociation can modify the oxidation state of the surface atoms of the catalysts and can directly participate in the oxidation of the hydrocarbon [10,11]."
[8] "In this context, CO2,one of the major greenhouse gases,accounts for the fast global warming tendency in the past decades."
[9] "In this context, CO2 recycling by the PDH technique,not only produces useful chemicals but also helps alleviate environmental pressure for excessive burning of fossil fuels,seemingly attractive from both economic and ecological perspective [12]."
[10] "An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials,where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system."
[11] "In addition to the specific active phases,the choice of the support,conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species,is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst [1]."
[12] "It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene [2]."
[13] "To date,in the field of PDH by CO2,Cr2O3-,V2O5-,and Ga2O3-based materials are the most frequently reported catalytic systems."
[14] "In the DH reaction, CO2 is also expected to serve as a medium for supplying heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction,as a diluent for enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and as an agent for the removal of coke formed on the catalyst [9]."

1. The study focuses on the use of indium oxide (In2O3) and its binary compounds with metals like Al, Si, and Zr as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in the presence of CO2. The research highlights the importance of In-based catalysts in efficiently converting propane to propylene using CO2 as an oxidant, addressing the challenges of traditional PDH processes involving high temperatures and severe coke formation.
2. The study investigates the support effect on the performance of In-based catalysts for PDH with CO2, specifically looking at Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 as supports. The focus is on understanding how the choice of support material, along with the loading of In2O3, affects the catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene production.
3. The support effect on In-based catalysts is crucial for tuning the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, which in turn impacts the overall catalytic performance. The study aims to elucidate the key parameters determining the high PDH performance of In-based catalysts, namely the abundance of highly dispersed indium species and the balance of acid-base properties of the support.
