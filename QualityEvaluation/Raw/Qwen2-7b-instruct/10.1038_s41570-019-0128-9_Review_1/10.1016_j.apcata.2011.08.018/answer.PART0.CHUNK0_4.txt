[1] "An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials,where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system."
[2] "In addition to the specific active phases,the choice of the support,conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species,is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst."
[3] "It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene."
[4] "For each support,both low and high In-loading samples were synthesized."
[5] "Detailed correlation of characterization results and PDH activities performed reveals the abundance of highly dispersed indium-species and acidbase properties are two key parameters that determine the high PDH performance for the In-based catalysts."

1. The InAlO catalyst in the PDH reaction exhibits a unique bifunctional property, necessitating a balanced presence of metallic In species and the bulk In2O3 phase for efficient CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation.
2. The selection of the support influences the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, thereby impacting the catalytic performance.
3. Acid-base properties of the supports significantly affect the selectivity towards propylene.
4. Both low and high loading samples of indium oxide were synthesized for each support.
5. The high PDH performance of In-based catalysts is determined by the abundance of highly dispersed indium species and the balance of acid-base properties.
