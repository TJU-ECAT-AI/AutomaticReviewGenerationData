In the present study, the focus was on understanding the influence of different support materials on the performance of In-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions in the presence of CO2. Three types of supports—Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2—were chosen based on their varying surface properties towards In2O3 and their relative acid/base strengths. The researchers synthesized both low and high In-loading samples for each support. Through detailed analysis of the characterization results and PDH activities, they discovered that the high dispersion of indium species and the balance of acidic/basic properties are crucial factors that contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance of these In-based catalysts in PDH reactions with CO2.
