In the present study, the focus was on understanding the influence of different support materials on the performance of In-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions in the presence of CO2. Three types of supports—Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2—were chosen based on their varying surface properties towards In2O3 and their relative acid/base strengths. The researchers synthesized both low and high In-loading samples for each support. Through detailed analysis of the characterization results and PDH activities, they discovered that the high dispersion of indium species and the balance of acidic/basic properties are crucial factors that contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance of these In-based catalysts in PDH reactions with CO2.

[1] "An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials, where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system."
[2] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst."
[3] "It is also suggested that acid-base properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene."
[4] "Detailed correlation of characterization results and PDH activities performed reveals the abundance of highly dispersed indium-species and acid-base properties are two key parameters that determine the high PDH performance for the In-based catalysts."

The In-based catalysts, particularly those with indium oxide loaded on aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, and silica, exhibit a unique bifunctional character with a balance between metallic indium species and bulk indium oxide phase, which is crucial for efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation. The choice of support, such as aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, and silica, influences the dispersion and electronic properties of the active species, thereby tuning the catalytic performance. Acid-base properties of the supports significantly impact the selectivity towards propylene production. High dispersion of indium species and balanced acid-base properties are essential parameters determining the high performance of these In-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method.
It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3.
Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH.

In the study, binary In2O3/MOx catalysts with varying In2O3 loadings were prepared to investigate their support effect in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. High dispersion of In2O3 species on the support material was found to enhance propylene production, with the highest yield observed in the case of the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. For optimal performance, the catalysts required a balance of acidic and basic properties to facilitate both dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift reactions.

[1] "Light alkenes such as propylene are important building blocks in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications thus,their demand is high [1,2]."
[2] "A great deal of attention has been paid to the so-called on-purpose propylene production technologies,such as propane dehydrogenation [3,4],due to their potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers where propylene is produced as a byproduct of ethylene."
[3] "However,due to the thermodynamic constrains of PDH reaction,high reaction tem- perature is frequently used,which inevitably leads to severe coke formation as well as undesired thermal cracking to lighter alkanes [5,6]."
[4] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane by molecular oxygen,which allows significantly lower reaction temperature and effective inhibition of coke deposition [7]."
[5] "Nevertheless,significant loss of propylene selectivity due to deep oxidation to carbon oxides is inevitably accompanied,existing as the main drawback of this process [1]."
[6] "To circumvent this problem,carbon dioxide (CO2),one of the most important green-house gases,has been proposed to be a promising candidate as milder oxidant replacing oxygen in activation of light alkanes,including coupling of methane,dehydration (DH) of ethylbenzene,iso-propylbenzene,propane,or iso-butane [8]."
[7] "On the other hand,contrarily to what is traditionally believed, CO2 is not inert in the oxidation reaction. Oxygen species produced by its dissociation can modify the oxidation state of the surface atoms of the catalysts and can directly participate in the oxidation of the hydrocarbon [10,11]."
[8] "In this context, CO2,one of the major greenhouse gases,accounts for the fast global warming tendency in the past decades."
[9] "In this context, CO2 recycling by the PDH technique,not only produces useful chemicals but also helps alleviate environmental pressure for excessive burning of fossil fuels,seemingly attractive from both economic and ecological perspective [12]."
[10] "An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials,where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system."
[11] "In addition to the specific active phases,the choice of the support,conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species,is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst [1]."
[12] "It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene [2]."
[13] "To date,in the field of PDH by CO2,Cr2O3-,V2O5-,and Ga2O3-based materials are the most frequently reported catalytic systems."
[14] "In the DH reaction, CO2 is also expected to serve as a medium for supplying heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction,as a diluent for enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and as an agent for the removal of coke formed on the catalyst [9]."
