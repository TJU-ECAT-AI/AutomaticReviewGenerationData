Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method.
It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3.
Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH.

In the study, binary In2O3/MOx catalysts with varying In2O3 loadings were prepared to investigate their support effect in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. High dispersion of In2O3 species on the support material was found to enhance propylene production, with the highest yield observed in the case of the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. For optimal performance, the catalysts required a balance of acidic and basic properties to facilitate both dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift reactions.
