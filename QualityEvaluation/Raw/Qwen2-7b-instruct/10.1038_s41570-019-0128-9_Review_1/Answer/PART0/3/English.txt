FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, compare favorably with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. The support material CeO2 is crucial for the catalyst's performance, influencing its activity and selectivity through its role in providing a suitable surface for the active phase. The composition and structure of the catalyst significantly affect its performance. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts have shown higher activity, selectivity, and stability compared to V2O5 catalysts. Challenges exist in finding an optimal balance between metal components and support material. Potential improvements aim to optimize catalyst activity and selectivity through modifications to its structure or composition.

The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340°C, showing a significant increase in CO conversion when the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst was compared to the Fe-1.2Na catalyst, both with a similar sodium content. Despite similar selectivities, the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst demonstrated a notable rise in CO conversion efficiency, indicating that zinc serves as a structural promoter that reduces the size of iron crystals, thereby exposing more active surface sites. This results in a dramatic increase in mass-specific activity. Crucially, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface inhibits the hydrogenation of double bonds and facilitates the desorption of products, making the catalyst exceptionally reactive towards alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms, while reducing the selectivity for unwanted products.
