Despite similar selectivities, the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst demonstrated a notable rise in CO conversion efficiency, indicating that zinc serves as a structural promoter that reduces the size of iron crystals, thereby exposing more active surface sites. This results in a dramatic increase in mass-specific activity. Crucially, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface inhibits the hydrogenation of double bonds and facilitates the desorption of products, making the catalyst exceptionally reactive towards alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms, while reducing the selectivity for unwanted products.", "Chinese": "在340°C下评估了催化剂性能，发现Fe-Zn-0.81Na催化剂与Fe-1.2Na催化剂（两种催化剂的钠含量相似）相比，CO转化率显著提高。尽管选择性相似，但Fe-Zn-0.81Na催化剂的CO转化效率有了明显的提升，表明锌作为结构促进剂，能够减小铁晶粒的尺寸，从而暴露更多的活性表面位点。这导致了质量特异性活性的大幅提高。最重要的是，催化剂表面的电子结构抑制了双键的氢化并促进了产物的脱附，使得催化剂对五碳以上烯烃的反应异常活跃，特别是那些在烃类中有超过50%选择性的烯烃，同时降低了对其他不期望产物的选择性。", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.201603556"},
