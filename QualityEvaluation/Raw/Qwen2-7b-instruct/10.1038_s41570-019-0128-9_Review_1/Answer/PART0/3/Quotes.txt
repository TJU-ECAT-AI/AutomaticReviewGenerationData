[1] "In comparison to V2O5-based catalysts, the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions."
          [2] "The support material CeO2 plays a crucial role in the performance of the catalyst, providing a suitable surface for the active phase."

[1] "The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340C (Table1). Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
          [2] "However, the selectivity of the two catalysts was similar."
          [3] "Therefore, in line with XRD and CO adsorption results, this means that Zn works as a structural promoter, the addition of which leads to smaller Fe crystals and therefore more exposed surface sites."
          [4] "Consequently, the mass-specific activity is dramatically increased."
          [5] "Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
          [6] "Most importantly, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface suppresses the hydrogenation of double bonds and promotes desorption of products, which renders the catalyst unexpectedly reactive toward alkenesespecially C5+ alkenes (with more than 50% selectivity in hydrocarbons) while lowering the selectivity for undesired products."
