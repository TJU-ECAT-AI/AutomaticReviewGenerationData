Ceria-based catalysts, particularly those containing Fe3Ni1, show superior activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH processes compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The performance, challenges, and potential improvements of these catalysts are largely determined by the type of support materials, their composition, and structural characteristics.

The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst system demonstrated higher activity than V2O5 in CO2-ODH reactions. Catalyst performance was affected by the choice of support materials, composition, and structural factors. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts showed superior selectivity in CO2-ODH products compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The significance of oxygen vacancies in improving CO2 adsorption and activation processes was also explored.

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate superior activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. Support materials, composition, and structural factors significantly influence the catalyst performance. Challenges for improvement include maintaining stability, reducing costs, and minimizing environmental impact. Further research is essential to enhance catalyst efficiency and sustainability.

The catalytic performance was assessed at 340°C, demonstrating a significant enhancement in CO conversion when comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst to the Fe-1.2Na catalyst, both containing a similar amount of sodium. Although the selectivities of the two catalysts were comparable, the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst showed a marked increase in CO conversion efficiency, indicating that zinc functions as a structural promoter that reduces the size of iron crystals, thereby exposing more active surface sites. This leads to a substantial increase in mass-specific activity. Moreover, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface plays a pivotal role in inhibiting the hydrogenation of double bonds and facilitating the desorption of products, making the catalyst exceptionally reactive towards alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms, while reducing the selectivity for less desirable products.
