Although the selectivities of the two catalysts were comparable, the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst showed a marked increase in CO conversion efficiency, indicating that zinc functions as a structural promoter that reduces the size of iron crystals, thereby exposing more active surface sites. This leads to a substantial increase in mass-specific activity. Moreover, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface plays a pivotal role in inhibiting the hydrogenation of double bonds and facilitating the desorption of products, making the catalyst exceptionally reactive towards alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms, while reducing the selectivity for less desirable products.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.201603556"},
