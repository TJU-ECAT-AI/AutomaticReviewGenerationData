          [1] "Significantly, deJong etal. reported that lower olefins can be selectively produced on S- and Na-modified Fe catalyst."
          [2] "By combining various insitu characterization approaches with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a rationale for the structural modulation provided by Zn and the electronic modulation given by Na ions has been clearly revealed, which is vital for understanding complicated multicomponent FTS catalytic systems and contributes toward the development of highly selective FTS processes."
          [3] "Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
          [4] "However, the o/p ratio drastically increased with an increase of Na concentration; for catalyst with 0.36%Na the o/p ratio reached 6.3. This ratio goes as high as 7.4 when the loading of Na is 3.4%."
          [5] "Clearly, phase segregation occurred because of crystalline phase transformation of the sample from ZnFe2O4 and ZnO, into Fe5C2, Fe3O4, and ZnO; Zn and Fe species were separated with a clear boundary."
          [6] "To understand the dramatic effect of Na on the selectivity for FTS products, we carried out reaction mechanism calculations on iron carbide catalysts."

          The literature discusses the effects of modifying iron catalysts with zinc and sodium, particularly focusing on how these modifications impact the selectivity and activity in CO2-ODH reactions. Zinc changes the size of iron species, acting as a structural promoter, while sodium ions alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, facilitating CO activation and promoting the desorption of products. The introduction of sodium ions can significantly increase the conversion of CO and the selectivity for alkenes, especially those with five or more carbon atoms. The study also explores the reaction mechanisms involved in the synthesis of alkenes through FTS processes, highlighting the role of electronic structure modifications in controlling product distribution.

          文献讨论了通过锌和钠修饰铁催化剂对CO2-ODH反应的选择性和活性的影响。锌改变铁物种的大小，作为结构促进剂，而钠离子改变催化剂的电子结构，促进CO激活并促进产物的脱附。引入钠离子可以显著增加CO的转化率和烯烃的选择性，尤其是含五个或更多碳原子的烯烃。研究还探讨了通过FTS过程合成烯烃的反应机制，强调电子结构修改在控制产物分布中的作用。

          [1] "The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340C (Table1). Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
          [2] "However, the selectivity of the two catalysts was similar."
          [3] "Therefore, in line with XRD and CO adsorption results, this means that Zn works as a structural promoter, the addition of which leads to smaller Fe crystals and therefore more exposed surface sites."
          [4] "Consequently, the mass-specific activity is dramatically increased."
          [5] "Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
          [6] "Most importantly, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface suppresses the hydrogenation of double bonds and promotes desorption of products, which renders the catalyst unexpectedly reactive toward alkenesespecially C5+ alkenes (with more than 50% selectivity in hydrocarbons) while lowering the selectivity for undesired products."

          The catalytic performance was assessed at 340°C, demonstrating a significant enhancement in CO conversion when comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst to the Fe-1.2Na catalyst, both containing a similar amount of sodium. Although the selectivities of the two catalysts were comparable, the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst showed a marked increase in CO conversion efficiency, indicating that zinc functions as a structural promoter that reduces the size of iron crystals, thereby exposing more active surface sites. This leads to a substantial increase in mass-specific activity. Moreover, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface plays a pivotal role in inhibiting the hydrogenation of double bonds and facilitating the desorption of products, making the catalyst exceptionally reactive towards alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms, while reducing the selectivity for less desirable products.

          在340°C下评估了催化剂性能，发现Fe-Zn-0.81Na催化剂与Fe-1.2Na催化剂（两种催化剂的钠含量相似）相比，CO转化率显著提高。尽管两个催化剂的选择性相似，但Fe-Zn-0.81Na催化剂的CO转化效率有了明显的提升，表明锌作为结构促进剂，能够减小铁晶粒的尺寸，从而暴露更多的活性表面位点。这导致了质量特异性活性的大幅提高。此外，催化剂表面的电子结构在抑制双键的氢化并促进产物脱附方面起着关键作用，使得催化剂对五碳以上烯烃的反应异常活跃，特别是那些在烃类中有超过50%选择性的烯烃，同时降低了对其他不期望产物的选择性。

          The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340°C, revealing a significant increase in CO conversion when the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst was contrasted against the Fe-1.2Na catalyst, both having a similar sodium content. While the selectivities of the two catalysts were equivalent, the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst exhibited a pronounced rise in CO conversion efficiency, signifying that zinc functions as a structural promoter that shrinks the size of iron crystals, thus exposing more active surface sites. This leads to a substantial increase in mass-specific activity. Moreover, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface impedes the hydrogenation of double bonds and enhances the desorption of products, making the catalyst exceptionally reactive towards alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms, while diminishing the selectivity for unwanted products.
