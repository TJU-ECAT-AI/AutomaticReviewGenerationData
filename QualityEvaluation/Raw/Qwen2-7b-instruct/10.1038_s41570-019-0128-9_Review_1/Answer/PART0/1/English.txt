When comparing FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions, the former might offer different levels of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms depending on the support materials, composition, and structural factors. However, specific details on these comparisons are not provided in the document.

The study examines the impact of hydration and oxygen vacancy on the adsorption and activation of CO2 on β-Ga2O3(100). It highlights that the catalyst system exhibits remarkable activity in CO2 activation. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts were found to surpass V2O5-based catalysts in performance, demonstrating higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions. The presence of structural defects, particularly oxygen vacancies, improves catalytic properties. The study suggests potential for enhancing catalyst performance through refining the composition and structure.

The FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, notably Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrated improved activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. Support materials, composition, and structural factors significantly influence the catalyst performance. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts showed superior performance due to an optimized structure and composition. Nevertheless, scalability and cost-effectiveness present challenges. Future improvements aim to optimize the catalyst composition and synthesis techniques.

The literature discusses the effects of modifying iron catalysts with zinc and sodium, particularly focusing on how these modifications impact the selectivity and activity in CO2-ODH reactions. Zinc changes the size of iron species, acting as a structural promoter, while sodium ions alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, facilitating CO activation and promoting the desorption of products. The introduction of sodium ions can significantly increase the conversion of CO and the selectivity for alkenes, especially those with five or more carbon atoms. The study also explores the reaction mechanisms involved in the synthesis of alkenes through FTS processes, highlighting the role of electronic structure modifications in controlling product distribution.

The study investigates the detailed exchange of oxygen between CO2 and CeO2, focusing on the role of Pt in the process. It uses C18O2 in an advanced TAP reactor to analyze the exchange mechanism. Between 200 and 300°C, only one oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged, while above 300°C, C16O2 is formed. The exchange occurs in two consecutive steps, as depicted in Scheme 1. The effect of Pt is not evident at high temperatures, but between 200 and 400°C, Pt accelerates the exchange rate, mainly favoring the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule. In the presence of Pt, the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2 can also occur with C18O16O in the gas phase or with C18O16O-like surface species, leading to the formation of C16O2.
