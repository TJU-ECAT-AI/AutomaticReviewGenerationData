          [4] "However, the o/p ratio drastically increased with an increase of Na concentration; for catalyst with 0.36%Na the o/p ratio reached 6.3. This ratio goes as high as 7.4 when the loading of Na is 3.4%."
          [5] "Clearly, phase segregation occurred because of crystalline phase transformation of the sample from ZnFe2O4 and ZnO, into Fe5C2, Fe3O4, and ZnO; Zn and Fe species were separated with a clear boundary."
          [6] "To understand the dramatic effect of Na on the selectivity for FTS products, we carried out reaction mechanism calculations on iron carbide catalysts."

[1] "The aim of this study is to investigate the exchange of oxygen between the CO2 and the CeO2 in more detail and to analyse the role of Pt during this exchange process."
          [2] "For this purpose, C18O2 has been used and the exchange mechanism has been studied in an advanced TAP (Temporal Analysis of Products) reactor."
          [3] "Between 200 and 300 8C, only one oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged and the only reaction taking place is reaction (2)."
          [4] "Above 300 8C, C16O2 is formed, but reaction (2) still occurs."
          [5] "This sequence of reactions is described in Scheme 1."
          [6] "In the case of Pt-deposited CeO2, the participation of the noble metal in the oxygen exchange processes depends on temperature."
          [7] "At high temperature (500 and 600 8C), the effect of Pt is not obvious by comparison of the CeO2 (Fig. 5a) and Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 5b) behaviour."
          [8] "Between 200 and 400 8C, Pt accelerates the oxygen exchange rate."
          [9] "It is reasonable to assume that, in this range of temperatures where the oxygen exchange rate between C18O2 and CeO2 is fast, the reactions (2) and (3) take place."
          [10] "On the contrary, at lower temperatures (200400 8C) the behaviour of CeO2 and Pt/ CeO2 is quite different."
          [11] "In the presence of Pt, as discussed for bare CeO2, the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2 could also occur with C18O16O in the gas-phase or with C18O16O-like surface species, and both reaction pathways would yield finally C16O2."
          [12] "The adsorption of C18O2 on Pt and the exchange of the first oxygen atom of C18O2 with Ce16O2 (reactions (4) and (6)) could occurs by two mechanisms."
