While the selectivities of the two catalysts were equivalent, the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst exhibited a pronounced rise in CO conversion efficiency, signifying that zinc functions as a structural promoter that shrinks the size of iron crystals, thus exposing more active surface sites. This leads to a substantial increase in mass-specific activity. Moreover, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface impedes the hydrogenation of double bonds and enhances the desorption of products, making the catalyst exceptionally reactive towards alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms, while diminishing the selectivity for unwanted products.", "Chinese": "在340°C下评估了催化剂性能，发现Fe-Zn-0.81Na催化剂与Fe-1.2Na催化剂（两种催化剂的钠含量相似）相比，CO转化率显著提高。尽管两个催化剂的选择性相同，但Fe-Zn-0.81Na催化剂的CO转化效率有了明显的提升，表明锌作为结构促进剂，能够缩小铁晶粒的尺寸，从而暴露更多的活性表面位点。这导致了质量特异性活性的大幅提高。此外，催化剂表面的电子结构阻碍了双键的氢化并促进了产物的脱附，使得催化剂对五碳以上烯烃的反应异常活跃，特别是那些在烃类中有超过50%选择性的烯烃，同时降低了对其他不期望产物的选择性。", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.201603556"},
