The document discusses the catalytic properties of ceria and ceria-containing materials, focusing on their applications in oxidation reactions, hydrogenation reactions, elimination of SOx and NOx, automotive exhaust catalysts, and diesel emission control. It also explores the reductive behavior, adsorption of other probe molecules, metal-support interactions, and characterization studies related to ceria.

The FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrated superior performance in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. Support materials, composition, and structural factors played critical roles in determining their effectiveness. Challenges exist, such as enhancing stability and activity, which require further optimization. Potential improvements include refining the catalyst composition and adjusting the support materials.

The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340°C, revealing a significant increase in CO conversion when the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst was contrasted against the Fe-1.2Na catalyst, both having a similar sodium content. While the selectivities of the two catalysts were equivalent, the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst exhibited a pronounced rise in CO conversion efficiency, signifying that zinc functions as a structural promoter that shrinks the size of iron crystals, thus exposing more active surface sites. This leads to a substantial increase in mass-specific activity. Moreover, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface impedes the hydrogenation of double bonds and enhances the desorption of products, making the catalyst exceptionally reactive towards alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms, while diminishing the selectivity for unwanted products.
