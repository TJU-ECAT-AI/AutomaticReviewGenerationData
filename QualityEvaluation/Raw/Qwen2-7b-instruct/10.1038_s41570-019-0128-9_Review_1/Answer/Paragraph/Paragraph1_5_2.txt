        Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions: Performance, selectivity, and the influence of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation

        The study delves into the comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, against vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. It highlights that FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity, primarily due to the influence of support materials, composition, and structural factors. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts stand out for their superior performance, attributed to an optimized structure and composition, surpassing vanadium oxide catalysts in propylene formation.

        The literature reveals that the presence of structural defects, such as oxygen vacancies, significantly enhances the catalytic properties of these catalysts. Challenges in scaling up production and cost-effectiveness remain, necessitating future improvements aimed at refining the catalyst composition and synthesis methods.

        DeJong et al. (2016) report that sodium ions, when introduced into iron catalysts, can dramatically increase CO conversion and selectivity for alkenes with five or more carbon atoms. This effect is attributed to the modulation of electronic structure by sodium ions, facilitating CO activation and promoting product desorption.

        The study by deJong et al. (2016) also emphasizes the importance of the role of Pt in the oxygen exchange processes between CO2 and CeO2. The introduction of Pt accelerates the oxygen exchange rate, particularly between 200 and 400°C, leading to the formation of C16O2. Phase segregation occurs, resulting in a clearer separation of Zn and Fe species.

        The catalyst system examined by deJong et al. (2016) on β-Ga2O3(100) demonstrates remarkable activity in CO2 activation, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts surpassing V2O5-based catalysts in performance. These catalysts show higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions, underscoring the significance of structural defects, such as oxygen vacancies, in improving catalytic properties.

        The investigation by deJong et al. (2016) into the exchange of oxygen between CO2 and CeO2 reveals that only one oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged at temperatures between 200 and 300°C. Above 300°C, C16O2 is formed, indicating a sequence of reactions that contribute to the overall catalytic process.

        The participation of noble metals like Pt in the oxygen exchange processes depends on temperature, with a notable acceleration of the exchange rate between 200 and 400°C. This effect is crucial for understanding the complex interactions between catalyst components and the CO2 molecule.

        The study by deJong et al. (2016) on the role of Pt in CeO2 catalysts further elucidates the importance of temperature in modulating the catalyst's performance. At high temperatures (500 and 600°C), the effect of Pt is less pronounced, suggesting a critical temperature range for optimizing catalyst efficiency.

        In summary, the comparative analysis indicates that FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, offer superior performance in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The role of support materials, composition, and structural factors is pivotal in determining the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Future research directions should focus on refining catalyst composition, synthesis methods, and exploring novel support materials to address scalability and cost-effectiveness challenges.
