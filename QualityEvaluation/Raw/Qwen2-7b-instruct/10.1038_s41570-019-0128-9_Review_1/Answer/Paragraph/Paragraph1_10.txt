In the realm of catalysis, particularly concerning the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemical products through the oxygenated decomposition of hydrogen (CO2-ODH), the comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts becomes crucial for understanding their performance and selectivity. Both catalyst types play significant roles in this chemical transformation, with each exhibiting unique properties that influence reaction mechanisms and product formation. The FexNiy/CeO2 system, characterized by its mixed metal oxide structure, demonstrates a high degree of activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions due to the synergistic effects between iron and nitrogen species, along with the redox properties of ceria. The CeO2 component acts as an efficient oxygen carrier, facilitating the oxygen transfer process essential for the CO2-ODH reaction, while the iron-nitrogen compounds contribute to the activation of CO2.

On the other hand, vanadium oxide catalysts are known for their robustness and stability under harsh conditions, making them attractive for CO2-ODH applications. Vanadium's ability to exist in multiple oxidation states enables it to act as a versatile catalyst, capable of promoting various reaction pathways depending on the specific conditions and composition. The presence of vanadium in these catalysts can significantly influence the reaction mechanisms, often leading to the formation of a wide range of oxygenated products.

The influence of supports and composition on these catalysts is equally important. Supports like CeO2 and the precise tuning of metal loading and composition (FexNiy ratios in the case of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts) can dramatically alter the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. For instance, the addition of nitrogen in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts enhances the surface area and acidity, which are critical for CO2 activation and subsequent ODH processes. Similarly, the composition of vanadium oxide catalysts can be adjusted to optimize the balance between CO2 activation and product selectivity.

In conclusion, the comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions reveals a complex interplay between catalyst composition, support materials, and reaction mechanisms. Each system offers distinct advantages and challenges, necessitating a detailed examination of their performance and selectivity under various operating conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of efficient and sustainable methods for converting CO2 into valuable chemical feedstocks, contributing to the broader goals of environmental protection and resource efficiency.
