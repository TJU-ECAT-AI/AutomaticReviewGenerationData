        Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions: Performance, selectivity, and the influence of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation

        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1080/01614949608006464], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/la903836v] and [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]. The investigation highlights that FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate enhanced activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the support materials, composition, and structural factors. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts exhibit superior performance due to an optimized structure and composition. However, challenges in scaling up production and cost-effectiveness remain, necessitating future improvements focused on refining the catalyst composition and synthesis methods.

        Notably, references [10.1002/anie.201603556] and [10.1016/j.apcata.2008.03.013] elucidate the effects of modifying iron catalysts with zinc and sodium, emphasizing how these modifications impact the selectivity and activity in CO2-ODH reactions. Zinc acts as a structural promoter, changing the size of iron species, while sodium ions alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, facilitating CO activation and promoting the desorption of products. The introduction of sodium ions can significantly increase the conversion of CO and the selectivity for alkenes, especially those with five or more carbon atoms. The reaction mechanisms involved in the synthesis of alkenes through FTS processes are explored, underscoring the pivotal role of electronic structure modifications in controlling product distribution.

        The study of reference [10.1021/la903836v] examines the impact of hydration and oxygen vacancy on the adsorption and activation of CO2 on β-Ga2O3(100), revealing that the catalyst system exhibits remarkable activity in CO2 activation. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts surpass V2O5-based catalysts in performance, demonstrating higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions. The presence of structural defects, particularly oxygen vacancies, enhances catalytic properties. The study suggests potential for enhancing catalyst performance through refining the composition and structure.

        The analysis of reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052] underscores the importance of support materials, composition, and structural factors in determining the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts show superior performance due to an optimized structure and composition. However, challenges in scaling up production and cost-effectiveness remain, highlighting the need for further research aimed at optimizing catalyst composition and synthesis techniques.

        Future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies, such as utilizing advanced synthesis methods to improve catalyst stability and activity, developing new support materials with tailored properties, and investigating the synergistic effects of multiple metals on CO2 activation and product selectivity. Additionally, understanding the precise mechanisms by which support materials modulate the electronic structure of catalysts could lead to the design of catalysts with enhanced performance and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions.
