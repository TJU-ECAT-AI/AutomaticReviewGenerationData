        Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions: Performance, selectivity, and the influence of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation

        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/la903836v], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052] and [10.1002/anie.201603556]. The comparative study indicates that FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, notably Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate superior performance over vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. This superiority is attributed to the enhanced activity and selectivity towards propylene formation, which is influenced by the support materials, composition, and structural factors of the catalysts. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts exhibit an optimized structure and composition that contributes to their superior performance.

        However, the study also highlights challenges in scaling up production and ensuring cost-effectiveness. Potential avenues for improvement include further optimization of the catalyst composition and synthesis methods. The literature further suggests that the electronic structure modifications, brought about by the introduction of zinc and sodium ions, significantly affect the catalytic properties of iron catalysts, thereby impacting the selectivity for alkenes in CO2-ODH reactions.

        The study investigates the detailed exchange of oxygen between CO2 and CeO2, focusing on the role of Pt in the process. It uses C18O2 in an advanced TAP reactor to analyze the exchange mechanism. The results indicate that the exchange occurs in two consecutive steps, and the effect of Pt is temperature-dependent, accelerating the exchange rate between 200 and 400°C.

        Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on understanding the precise mechanisms behind the enhanced activity and selectivity of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, optimizing the synthesis methods to improve their scalability and cost-effectiveness, and exploring the synergistic effects of support materials and composition on catalytic performance.

        FexNiy/CeO2和钒氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的比较分析：性能、选择性和支持材料、组成对反应机制和产物形成的影响

        根据参考文献[10.1021/la903836v]的深入分析，结合了参考文献[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]和[10.1002/anie.201603556]的综合理解。比较研究表明，FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中的性能优于钒氧化物催化剂。这种优越性归因于增强的活性和丙烯形成的高选择性，这受到催化剂支持材料、组成和结构因素的影响。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂因其优化的结构和组成而表现出优异的性能。

        然而，研究也指出了扩大生产规模和确保成本效益的挑战。改进催化剂组成和合成方法的潜力包括进一步优化合成方法以提高其可扩展性和经济性。文献还表明，通过引入锌和钠离子进行电子结构修改，显著影响铁催化剂的催化性质，从而影响CO2-ODH反应中烯烃的选择性。

        研究调查了CO2和CeO2之间的详细氧交换过程，重点分析了Pt在此过程中的作用。使用C18O2在高级TAP反应器中进行分析，结果显示氧交换分为两个连续步骤，Pt的参与温度依赖性，200至400°C时加速了氧交换速率。

        考虑文件中讨论的进展和发现，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来研究努力可能集中在理解FexNiy/CeO2催化剂增强活性和选择性的精确机制，优化合成方法以提高其可扩展性和经济性，并探索支持材料和组成对催化性能的协同效应。此外，需要开发能够高效将CO2转化为附加值产品的催化剂，考虑到环境可持续性和经济效益。

        总结与前瞻展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进展和发现，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来研究努力可能集中在理解FexNiy/CeO2催化剂增强活性和选择性的精确机制，优化合成方法以提高其可扩展性和经济性，并探索支持材料和组成对催化性能的协同效应。同时，还需要开发能够在环保和经济上可行的CO2转化成高价值产品的催化剂。
