        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1080/01614949608006464], synthesizing comprehension from [10.1021/la903836v] and [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]. Comparative studies have indicated that FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, specifically Fe3Ni1/CeO2, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. This improvement is attributed to the influence of support materials, composition, and structural factors on the catalyst's performance. 

        Notably, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts demonstrate superior performance due to an optimized structure and composition, as reported in [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]. However, challenges in scaling up production and cost-effectiveness remain areas of concern. The literature also highlights that the addition of sodium ions can significantly increase the conversion of CO and the selectivity for alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms, as discussed in [10.1002/anie.201603556].

        An integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings disclosed in the file, future research might focus on refining the catalyst composition and structure to overcome scalability issues and enhance cost-effectiveness. Additionally, exploring the synergistic effects of different modifiers like zinc and sodium on the catalysts could lead to the development of more selective and efficient catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. Innovations in catalyst design and synthesis methodologies could pave the way for the creation of highly selective FTS processes.

        Future research could also delve deeper into understanding the intricate mechanisms of oxygen exchange between CO2 and CeO2, as explored in [10.1016/j.apcata.2008.03.013]. This knowledge could provide insights into optimizing catalysts for CO2 activation and improving the selectivity of products, especially in the context of CO2-ODH reactions.

        基于参考文献[10.1080/01614949608006464]的深入分析，结合了[10.1021/la903836v]和[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]的综合理解。比较研究表明，FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，尤其是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中的活性和选择性优于钒氧化物催化剂。这种提升归因于支持材料、组成和结构因素对催化剂性能的影响。

        特别是，Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂由于优化的结构和组成而表现出优越的性能，如在[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]中所述。然而，生产规模扩大和成本效益的问题仍然是需要关注的领域。文献还指出，添加钠离子可以显著增加CO的转化率并提高五碳以上烯烃的选择性，这在[10.1002/anie.201603556]中有所讨论。

        整合理解和前景展望：考虑到文件中披露的进展和发现，未来的研究可能专注于改进催化剂组成和结构以克服规模化问题和提高成本效益。此外，探索锌和钠等不同修饰剂对催化剂的作用，可以促进更选择性和高效的催化剂发展，用于CO2-ODH反应。

        未来研究还可以深入探讨CO2和CeO2之间氧交换的复杂机制，如在[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.03.013]中所研究的。这些知识可以为优化催化剂进行CO2活化和改善产物选择性提供见解，特别是在CO2-ODH反应的背景下。
