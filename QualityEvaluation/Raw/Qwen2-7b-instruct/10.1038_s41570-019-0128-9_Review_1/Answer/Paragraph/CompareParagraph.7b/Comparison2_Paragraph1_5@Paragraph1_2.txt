They maintain clear logical structures, appropriate citation practices, and timely coverage of relevant literature. However, they are equally lacking in rigor of research design, fluency of language expression, and conciseness of expression. Both offer practical application potential and feasible suggestions. Their critical thinking skills are also comparable, with recognition of research limitations. Despite being closely matched, neither review significantly outperforms the other."
