Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions: Performance, selectivity, and the influence of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation

        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/la903836v], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052] and [10.1002/anie.201603556]. The literature highlights that FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, notably Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate improved activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts, influenced significantly by support materials, composition, and structural factors. The study of reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052] confirms that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts exhibit superior performance due to their optimized structure and composition, despite facing challenges in scaling up production and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, the work in reference [10.1002/anie.201603556] reveals that sodium ions, when introduced to iron catalysts, can significantly increase CO conversion and the selectivity for alkenes, especially those with five or more carbon atoms.

        The study in reference [10.1016/j.apcata.2008.03.013] delves deeper into the role of Pt in the oxygen exchange process between CO2 and CeO2, demonstrating that its participation depends on temperature. At lower temperatures (200-400Â°C), Pt accelerates the oxygen exchange rate, which is crucial for understanding the complex multicomponent FTS catalytic systems and developing highly selective FTS processes. This research underscores the importance of considering the electronic structure modifications in catalysts to control product distribution.

        Looking ahead, there is an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research might focus on optimizing catalyst composition and synthesis techniques to overcome scalability and cost-effectiveness challenges. By refining the catalyst structure and composition, it may be possible to enhance the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable industrial processes.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggest that advancements in catalyst design and synthesis could lead to significant improvements in CO2-ODH reactions. Potential avenues include the development of novel catalyst materials, the implementation of advanced synthesis methods, and the exploration of synergistic interactions between catalyst components. These efforts could not only improve the efficiency of CO2 utilization but also contribute to the broader goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering a more sustainable chemical industry.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1080/01614949608006464\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/la903836v\], \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\], \[10.1002/anie.201603556\], \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.03.013\], and \[10.1080/01614949608006464\]. Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions reveals that FexNiy/CeO2, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrates enhanced activity and selectivity compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The superior performance of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts is attributed to the optimized structure and composition, influenced by factors such as support materials, composition, and structural characteristics. However, challenges in scaling up production and cost-effectiveness are noted.

        The literature discusses the effects of modifying iron catalysts with zinc and sodium, highlighting how these modifications impact the selectivity and activity in CO2-ODH reactions. Zinc acts as a structural promoter, altering the size of iron species, while sodium ions modify the electronic structure of the catalyst, facilitating CO activation and promoting the desorption of products. The introduction of sodium ions can significantly increase the conversion of CO and the selectivity for alkenes, especially those with five or more carbon atoms. Future improvements aim to optimize the catalyst composition and synthesis techniques.

        In terms of the reaction mechanism, the detailed exchange of oxygen between CO2 and CeO2, analyzed in an advanced TAP reactor, reveals that between 200 and 300Â°C, only one oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged. Above 300Â°C, C16O2 is formed. The effect of Pt on this process depends on temperature, with the noble metal accelerating the oxygen exchange rate between 200 and 400Â°C.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on refining the synthesis methods, optimizing the composition, and exploring the synergistic effects of different metals and supports to enhance the catalytic performance of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts. Additionally, investigating the role of defects and their manipulation could lead to catalysts with superior activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions. The development of cost-effective, scalable catalysts with enhanced performance remains a critical challenge that warrants further investigation.
