Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1080/01614949608006464]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/la903836v], [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052], and [10.1002/anie.201603556]. Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions: Performance, selectivity, and the influence of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation.

        When comparing FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions, the former might offer different levels of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms depending on the support materials, composition, and structural factors. However, specific details on these comparisons are not provided in the document.

        The study examines the impact of hydration and oxygen vacancy on the adsorption and activation of CO2 on β-Ga2O3(100). It highlights that the catalyst system exhibits remarkable activity in CO2 activation. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts were found to surpass V2O5-based catalysts in performance, demonstrating higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions. The presence of structural defects, particularly oxygen vacancies, improves catalytic properties. The study suggests potential for enhancing catalyst performance through refining the composition and structure.

        The FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, notably Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrated improved activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. Support materials, composition, and structural factors significantly influence the catalyst performance. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts showed superior performance due to an optimized structure and composition. Nevertheless, scalability and cost-effectiveness present challenges. Future improvements aim to optimize the catalyst composition and synthesis techniques.

        The literature discusses the effects of modifying iron catalysts with zinc and sodium, particularly focusing on how these modifications impact the selectivity and activity in CO2-ODH reactions. Zinc changes the size of iron species, acting as a structural promoter, while sodium ions alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, facilitating CO activation and promoting the desorption of products. The introduction of sodium ions can significantly increase the conversion of CO and the selectivity for alkenes, especially those with five or more carbon atoms. The study also explores the reaction mechanisms involved in the synthesis of alkenes through FTS processes, highlighting the role of electronic structure modifications in controlling product distribution.

        The study investigates the detailed exchange of oxygen between CO2 and CeO2, focusing on the role of Pt in the process. It uses C18O2 in an advanced TAP reactor to analyze the exchange mechanism. Between 200 and 300°C, only one oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged, while above 300°C, C16O2 is formed. The exchange occurs in two consecutive steps, as depicted in Scheme 1. The effect of Pt is not evident at high temperatures, but between 200 and 400°C, Pt accelerates the exchange rate, mainly favoring the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule. In the presence of Pt, the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2 can also occur with C18O16O in the gas phase or with C18O16O-like surface species, leading to the formation of C16O2.

        In the case of Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalysts, a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%) when compared to Fe-1.2Na catalysts (having a similar Na content). However, the o/p ratio drastically increased with an increase of Na concentration; for catalyst with 0.36%Na, the o/p ratio reached 6.3. This ratio goes as high as 7.4 when the loading of Na is 3.4%. Clearly, phase segregation occurred because of crystalline phase transformation of the sample from ZnFe2O4 and ZnO, into Fe5C2, Fe3O4, and ZnO; Zn and Fe species were separated with a clear boundary. To understand the dramatic effect of Na on the selectivity for FTS products, reaction mechanism calculations on iron carbide catalysts were carried out.

        Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (having a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%).

        The aim of this study is to investigate the exchange of oxygen between the CO2 and the CeO2 in more detail and to analyse the role of Pt during this exchange process. For this purpose, C18O2 has been used and the exchange mechanism has been studied in an advanced TAP (Temporal Analysis of Products) reactor. Between 200 and 300°C, only one oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged and the only reaction taking place is reaction (2). Above 300°C, C16O2 is formed, but reaction (2) still occurs. This sequence of reactions is described in Scheme 1. In the case of Pt-deposited CeO2, the participation of the noble metal in the oxygen exchange processes depends on temperature. At high temperature (500 and 600°C), the effect of Pt is not obvious by comparison of the CeO2 (Fig. 5a) and Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 5b) behaviour. Between 200 and 400°C, Pt accelerates the oxygen exchange rate.

        The study investigated the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, in CO2-ODH reactions. Compared to vanadium oxide catalysts, the FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts showed enhanced activity and selectivity towards propylene formation. Support materials, composition, and structural factors significantly influence the performance of these catalysts. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts exhibited superior performance due to optimized structure and composition. However, challenges in scaling up production and cost-effectiveness remain. Potential for improvement includes further optimization of the catalyst composition and synthesis methods.

        Significantly, deJong et al. reported that lower olefins can be selectively produced on S- and Na-modified Fe catalyst. By combining various insitu characterization approaches with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a rationale for the structural modulation provided by Zn and the electronic modulation given by Na ions has been clearly revealed, which is vital for understanding complicated multicomponent FTS catalytic systems and contributes toward the development of highly selective FTS processes.

        In summary, the comparative analysis reveals that FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, exhibit superior performance over vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. This superiority is attributed to enhanced activity, selectivity, and optimized structure and composition. The influence of support materials and structural factors on the catalyst performance is significant. Challenges in scaling up production and cost-effectiveness need to be addressed. Future research should focus on further optimizing the catalyst composition and synthesis methods to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions between catalyst components and their impact on product distribution in CO2-ODH reactions.
        
        

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing novel catalyst compositions and synthesis techniques that can further enhance the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts. Specifically, there is potential to tailor the structure and composition of these catalysts to achieve even higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions. Additionally, investigating the synergistic effects of multiple modifying agents (e.g., Zn and Na) and their precise roles in altering the electronic structure and enhancing catalytic properties could lead to the development of highly selective catalysts. Moreover, exploring the integration of advanced characterization techniques with computational modeling could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and catalyst dynamics, enabling the rational design of catalysts with tailored properties for CO2-ODH applications. The field may also benefit from interdisciplinary collaborations, incorporating expertise from materials science, chemistry, and physics, to develop sustainable and economically viable methods for CO2 utilization. As the technology advances, there is potential for FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and related materials to play a pivotal role in the development of green chemical processes and the transition towards a circular economy.
