Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions: Performance, selectivity, and the influence of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation

        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/la903836v], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052] and [10.1002/anie.201603556]. The literature highlights that FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, notably Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate improved activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts, influenced significantly by support materials, composition, and structural factors. The study of reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052] confirms that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts exhibit superior performance due to their optimized structure and composition, despite facing challenges in scaling up production and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, the work in reference [10.1002/anie.201603556] reveals that sodium ions, when introduced to iron catalysts, can significantly increase CO conversion and the selectivity for alkenes, especially those with five or more carbon atoms.

        The study in reference [10.1016/j.apcata.2008.03.013] delves deeper into the role of Pt in the oxygen exchange process between CO2 and CeO2, demonstrating that its participation depends on temperature. At lower temperatures (200-400°C), Pt accelerates the oxygen exchange rate, which is crucial for understanding the complex multicomponent FTS catalytic systems and developing highly selective FTS processes. This research underscores the importance of considering the electronic structure modifications in catalysts to control product distribution.

        Looking ahead, there is an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research might focus on optimizing catalyst composition and synthesis techniques to overcome scalability and cost-effectiveness challenges. By refining the catalyst structure and composition, it may be possible to enhance the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable industrial processes.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggest that advancements in catalyst design and synthesis could lead to significant improvements in CO2-ODH reactions. Potential avenues include the development of novel catalyst materials, the implementation of advanced synthesis methods, and the exploration of synergistic interactions between catalyst components. These efforts could not only improve the efficiency of CO2 utilization but also contribute to the broader goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering a more sustainable chemical industry.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1080/01614949608006464\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/la903836v\], \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\], \[10.1002/anie.201603556\], \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.03.013\], and \[10.1080/01614949608006464\]. Comparative insights into FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts reveal that, in CO2-ODH reactions, FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, notably Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate enhanced activity and selectivity in propylene formation. This superiority is influenced by the support materials, composition, and structural factors, as highlighted in reference \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\].

        The study \[10.1021/la903836v\] further elucidates that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts exhibit higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The presence of structural defects, such as oxygen vacancies, enhances the catalytic properties, as discussed in \[10.1021/la903836v\] and \[10.1002/anie.201603556\]. Moreover, the document \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.03.013\] underscores the role of hydration and oxygen vacancy in CO2 adsorption and activation on β-Ga2O3(100), revealing remarkable activity in CO2 activation. The catalyst system surpassed V2O5-based catalysts, demonstrating higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions.

        The reference \[10.1002/anie.201603556\] further emphasizes the impact of modifying iron catalysts with zinc and sodium, which significantly increases the conversion of CO and the selectivity for alkenes, especially those with five or more carbon atoms. The study also explores the reaction mechanisms involved in the synthesis of alkenes through FTS processes, highlighting the role of electronic structure modifications in controlling product distribution.

        Considering the findings, there is a potential for improvement in refining the catalyst composition and synthesis methods to address scalability and cost-effectiveness challenges, as mentioned in \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\] and \[10.1002/anie.201603556\].
