They are equally strong in comprehensiveness, accuracy, innovation, and organization. While both articles effectively utilize interdisciplinary perspectives and provide recent, relevant references, they fall slightly short in the rigor of research design and the clarity of language expression. The inclusion of latest research results and reflection of current research hotspots is commendable. Both articles propose feasible suggestions with practical application potential, although their critical thinking skills and identification of research limitations are similarly evaluated. Despite minor differences, neither article outperforms the other significantly, leading to identical overall scores."
