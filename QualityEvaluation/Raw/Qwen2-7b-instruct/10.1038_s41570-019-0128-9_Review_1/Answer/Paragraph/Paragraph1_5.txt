        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1080/01614949608006464], followed by insights from [10.1021/la903836v] and [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]. The comparative examination of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, specifically Fe3Ni1/CeO2, against vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions reveals distinct variations in activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms, which are influenced by support materials, composition, and structural characteristics.

        The literature indicates that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts may exhibit superior performance compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. This superiority is attributed to the optimized structure and composition of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts, which can lead to enhanced activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions. The role of structural defects, such as oxygen vacancies, is highlighted as crucial for enhancing catalytic properties. These factors play a significant role in determining the overall performance, challenges, and potential avenues for improvement of these catalysts.

        Challenges in scaling up production and cost-effectiveness are acknowledged, necessitating further refinement of catalyst composition and synthesis methods. Future research directions might include exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies to address these challenges.
