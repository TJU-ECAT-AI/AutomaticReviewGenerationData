1. Introduction
The need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is pushing toward the use of renewable carbon, so to avoid as much as possible burning fossil carbon. Biomass is synonym of renewable carbon, as it is re-generated from CO2,usually captured from atmosphere. A close to zero emission cycle can in principle be implemented that effectively reduces the emis- sion of CO2. It would be possible to complement the natural car- bon cycle by developing man-made industrial processes for carbon recycling, converting, thus, spent carbon as CO2 into working carbon, as that present in valuable chemicals or fuels.
Such practice would fall again into the utilization of renewable carbon, as the man-made process would perfectly mimic the nat- ural process. An order of complexity higher would be represented by the integration of biotechnology and catalysis for an effective CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes, or even whole microorganisms, coupled to chemical technologies for energy supply to enzymes, using perennial sources as sun or wind or geothermal as primary energy.
These days all the above approaches are under investigation with an interesting complementarity of publicprivate investment in research.
This paper aimed at showing the state of the art of CO2 conver- sion and giving a perspective view of such technology.
Each atom of C we can recycle is an atom of fossil carbon left in the underground for next generations that will not reach the atmosphere today.
1.1. Where we are
The chemical utilization of CO2 is not a new attitude. Industrial processes were developed as early as in the 18801893s, namely:the synthesis of urea [1], the soda Solvay process, the synthesis of http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.04.003 0021-9517/ 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.04.003 hydrogen carbonates [2], and the production of salicylic acid [3].
Interestingly, in the former process CO2 recovered from the synthesis of NH3 is used. In the 1900s there was not a great interest in developing new applications of CO2. As a matter of fact, since the late 1800s the chemistry of CO (derived from fossil carbon) has been developed for the synthesis of chemicals and fuels that had its golden era in the 19001970s, and still today plays a key role in the production of chemicals and fuels. Only in the 1970s there was a revival in the exploitation of CO2 as additive to CO in the synthesis of methanol [4] and as co-monomer in the pioneering production of organic carbonates from epoxides [5], via direct carboxylation. Table 1 gives the actual use of carbon dioxide in the synthesis of chemicals and the perspective use at 2030 [6], cal- culated considering the expected market growth for the listed chemicals and assuming that new technologies will be developed that ensure a large conversion of CO2. Data reported in Table 1 show that in the best of cases the utilization of CO2 will grow from 180 Mt/y in 2014 to 207 Mt/y in 2016 and 332 Mt/y in 2030: a drop in the ocean of the over 35,000 Mt/y emitted today. Such scenario validates the position of those who say that the conversion of CO2 into chemicals will not contribute to the CO2 emission reduction.
We anticipate that what has value is the amount of avoided CO2 more than the amount of used CO2: the ratio avoided/used may span over a range 25, with a good average around 3.
This gives a different weight to the utilization option as 1 Gt/y of avoided CO2 may be a realistic goal in 2030. Should CO2 be converted into fuels, a new perspective opens and the Carbon Capture and Utilization-CCU option may play a fundamental role in avoiding CO2.
Table 1 also shows the oxidation state of the carbon-atom in the various compounds listed. This is a key point as the energetics of any reaction depends on the variation of the C-oxidation state in the reaction. Fig. 1 shows the Gibbs free-energy of formation of several C1 species.
It is quite evident that when the oxidation state of the carbon atom is reduced from +4 in CO2 to 2 or lower, a significant amount of energy is needed, while when the oxidation state remains +4 or close to it (+3 in C2 species such as oxalic acid, HO2CACO2H) the reaction is quasi-neutral (i.e., synthesis of organic carbonates and carbamates, located in the circle around CO2) or even exothermic as in the synthesis of inorganic carbonates, which lie well below
CO2. On this basis, in the middle 1980s we have classified the
CO2 reactions in two classes [7], according to the fact that CO2 is incorporated such as in the product (Class A) or it is converted into one of its reduced forms (Class B).
Class A: CO2 fixation into inorganic carbonates-M2CO3, organic carbonates-(RO)2CO, carbamates-RR0NACO2R, polycarbonates,polyurethanes, isocyanates-NCO.
Class B: CO2 reduction to CO or hydrogenated products such as methanol, methane, and higher hydrocarbons.
Noticeably, the two classes are characterized by a distinct use of the products and a quite different size of their market. Class A spe- cies fall into the chemicals market, while Class B are fuels with a market that is some 1214 times that of chemicals. Therefore, if one targets to convert large volumes of CO2 one must pursue its conversion into fuels. And here a new issue arises about the neces- sary energy for the conversion (see Fig. 1) and the hydrogen for the production of hydrocarbons. It is obvious that H2 cannot be derived from fossil C, but must come from water or organic waste, while energy must be supplied by perennial sources such as sun, wind,and geothermal. A new approach must be developed for H2 pro- duction with respect to the actual one based on the reforming (of coke or methane) at high temperature, a strongly endergonic pro- cess (Eqs. (1)(3)).

1.2. Key issues in the conversion of CO2
The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance must be kept under strict control, with the concept of avoided CO2 winning on that of used CO2. As a matter of fact, the use of CO2 in new chemical processes can be quite interesting as it avoids the emission of large volumes of CO2 (with respect to processes on stream), much larger than that of the amount of converted CO2.
Correct values of used and avoided CO2 may be obtained by applying the LCA methodology. An early example is given by the use of LCA in the comparative analysis of different synthetic methodologies for the production of cyclic carbonates [9]. It is worth to emphasize that the correctness of the figures depends on the quality of available data. At the time of the above study very limited data were available. Today, more reliable data are loaded in continuously up dated data bases and figures obtained from pilot plants are more and more at the hand. This may assist to make a much better estimate of new processes based on CO2. Fig. 2 shows the amount of CO2 emitted in processes based on the use of phosgene (on stream since the 1970s) vs the amount emitted in innovative processes based on the use of CO2 [8].
It is clear that what really matters is not the amount of CO2 used (0.5 t/tcarbonate) but the amount of CO2 avoided (the amount of CO2 emitted in the process based on phosgene (almost ca. 69 t/tcarbonate) minus the amount of CO2 emitted in the direct carboxylation,
1.32 t/tcarbonate). A parameter that can be used for the assessment
of processes is the ratio of CO2 avoided/CO2 used. For the carboxyla- tion of propene oxide (similar to reaction (a) in Fig. 2) it is estimated to range around 3.5 today.
We now come to a key point: synthetic routes based on CO2 must respond to a stringent requisite, namely: the new process must minimize the CO2 emission with respect to processes on stream. In order to satisfy such condition, an immediate sub-condition is:the CO2-based process must be a consumer and not a producer of CO2.
1.3. Performance indicators in CO2 conversion
Indicators which may help to assess a CO2-based process are as follows:(a) the carbon utilization fraction (the percentage of reagent-C fixed into the products);(b) the carbon-footprint (the CO2 emission in the process per unit of product);(c) the energy consumption factor (ratio of the input- to output- energy);(d) the waste production factor (waste produced per unit of product, w/w);(e) the avoided to used ratio.
The above indicators heavily depend on the reaction conditions.
The reaction parameter space is defined by the following factors:i. Solvent; ii. co-reagents; iii. catalysts; iv. temperature; v. pres- sure; vi. overall energy expenditure-time of reaction; vii. conver- sion of reagents; viii. formation of co-products/selectivity of the process; ix. waste generation; and x. end of process separation energy.
In order to maximize the benefit, the above parameters must respond to the conditions listed below:i. The solvent can be one of the reagents. Solventless reactions can be a good solution. The use of sc-CO2 may be beneficial. ii. Co-reagents must be used in stoichiometric amount and be converted at their maximum. This is particularly true when H2 is used. Any excess must be recovered. iii. Catalysts must be simple and cheap (earth abundant ele- ments), recoverable, reusable. iv. The temperature must be as low as possible, and selected also taking into consideration the separation step. Tempera- ture sweep must be avoided as the heat is not completely recovered and reused (especially at low temperature) and considerable energy loss occur. v. The reaction pressure should be kept as low as possible.
Pressurized liquid reaction mixtures and sc-conditions must be comparatively evaluated considering reaction rates, con- version yields and selectivities. vi. The overall energy expenditure must be kept as low as possible. vii. The conversion of reagents should be maximized. viii. The formation of co-products should be minimized. Very active catalysts may favor the occurrence of several reac- tions at the same time, with increase of the conversion yield but lowering selectivity and increasing the post-process sep- aration cost. Often such co-products are formed from co- reagents in equimolar amount with the target product. In case of large-scale (>Mt) chemicals such co-products must be either marketable or converted back into the original co-reagent. ix. The waste generation (including waste solvents) must be minimized as waste will produce CO2 during its final processing-burning. x. The post-reaction process for product isolation may play a key role in the overall energy expenditure. Sometimes it is better to achieve a lower conversion with 100% selectivity than a high conversion with formation of several byproducts difficult to separate.
All the above issues are considered when a life cycle assessment-LCA study is performed. Such methodology is the one that can give a reliable answer to the question whether a particular use of CO2 is avoiding CO2 emission or increasing it. Having set such a frame to the objective of using CO2 for the production of chemicals and fuels, we can face the aspect of how we can use CO2 in profitable ways that contribute to the reduction of the

2. CO2 properties, coordination chemistry and reactions
In this session we briefly discuss the electronic properties of CO2 and the structural changes the cumulene undergoes upon coordination to a metal center. These concepts are relevant to any metal-driven conversion of CO2.
2.1. Electronic properties of CO2
CO2 has a linear geometry (D1h) in its ground state, with both the carbonoxygen bonds being equivalent and displaying an equi- librium CAO distance of 1.1600 Å [10,11]. The valence electronic configuration of CO2 (16 valence electrons) in the linear ground state, 1Rg +, is 3rg 22ru 24rg 23ru 21pu 41pg 4 [12]. Fig. 3 shows a schematic and simplified representation of the molecular orbitals (MOs) of
CO2.
Combination of 2s and 2pz of all the three atoms generates six r molecular orbitals. Three couples of doubly degenerate reciprocally orthogonal p-orbitals (1pux and 1puy; 1pgx and 1pgy; 2pux and 2puy) are obtained from combining the remaining 2px and 2py orbi- tals of carbon and oxygens. The non bonding 1pgx and 1pgy MOs have null weight on the carbon atom and, therefore, are localized on the terminal oxygens, while the antibonding 2pux and 2puy MOs are mainly localized on the carbon atom, as they have a preponderant 2pxC and 2py character, respectively. Of the eight occupied molecular orbitals, both 3rg and 2ru are responsible for the r bonding skeleton of the molecule, while the 1pu orbitals account for the CAO p bonds. By contrast, the electrons 4rg, 3ru and 1pg are, r and p lone pairs, respectively.
Fig. 4 reports the Walsh diagram [13] for the CO2 molecule showing qualitatively the variation of the MOs energies with the change of OCO bond angle. The energies of the r-orbitals increase or remain practically unaffected upon the change of molecular symmetry (D1h ? C2v).
However, the energies of p-orbitals show more important changes. The degeneracy of the p-orbitals is lost in the bent geometry and the formerly degenerated p-orbitals separate in two non-equivalent orbitals with different energies. The splitting of the levels 1pu and 1pg is modest and the destabilization of 1pu(5a1) is roughly counterbalanced by the stabilization of 1pu(1b1). By contrast, the energies of both 1pg orbitals increase upon bending, much faster for 1pg(4b2) than for 1pg(1a2). The energy of the 2pu(2b1) orbital is only slightly affected by the mole- cule bending. The rapid increase of the energy of 1pg(4b2) with diminution of the bond angle accounts for the linearity of the CO2 molecule in the ground state. However, bending causes a marked decrease of the energy of the 2pu(6a1) MO, which can become even more stable than 1pg(4b2). The behavior of the 2pu(6a1) MO upon molecule bending suggests that population of the 2pu(6a1) level is expected to produce a distortion of CO2 molecule from linearity. This statement finds several validations, for instance,when considering:the geometry of the CO2 lowest excited states, related with the electronic configuration 1ru 2 1rg 2 2rg 2 3rg 2 2ru 2 4rg 2 3ru 2 1pu 4 1pg 3 2pu 1 [14];the geometry of CO2 radical anion (vide infra);the geometry of CO2 acting as ligand in metal-complexes, when the cumulene interacts with the metal center through the C-atom, as observed both g1-C adducts and g2-C, O (side-on) mononuclear and polynuclear complexes (vide infra).

Aresta et al., State of the art and perspectives in catalytic processes for CO2 conversion into chemicals and fuels: The distinctive contribution of chemical catalysis and biotechnology, J. Catal. (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.04.003 Upon addition of an extra electron the CO2 molecule converts into the radical anion CO2 (Eq. (4)). The latter species, generated in many ways and trapped in solid matrices, shows a bent equilibrium geometry (C2v symmetry) in the 2A1 ground state ((1a1)2(1b2)2 (2a1)2(3a1)2(2b2)2(4a1)2(3b2)2 (1b1)2(5a1)2(1a2)2(4b2)2(6a1)1;see also Fig. 4), with elongated CO bonds and the value of OCO angle ranging around 130 [15].
CO2  e ! CO 2 4 Reaction (4) is an endergonic process. A value of 0.6  0.2 eV has been measured for the adiabatic electron affinity (EAad) of the CO2 ground state [16]. In the gas phase CO2 is metastable against electron autodetachment. The reason for the metastability of the anion (lifetimes in the range of 3090 ls) is ascribed to the fact that the change of the molecular geometry from the 2A1 state of CO2 to the ground state of CO2, has a barrier of 0.4 eV [17]. Con- version of CO2 to CO2 anion is regarded as an important mode of activating the molecule and represents the first of the reactive steps leading to the partial or full reduction of the heterocumulene.
The change of geometry upon e transfer to CO2 may affect the rate of the process. Such features are relevant to the electrochemical reduction of CO2 as discussed in Section 4.2.
Removal of a 1pg electron from CO2 molecule to afford the CO2 + radical cation in the 2Pg ground state requires an energy of
13.79 eV [18], by far larger than that needed for the formation of
the radical anion CO2 [16] or for the dissociation of neutral CO2 to CO and atomic oxygen [19]. Spectroscopic measurements [20] show that CO2 + in its 2Pg ground state is a linear molecule with D1h point group symmetry: the two CAO bonds are equivalent with a length, which is only slightly longer (1.1769 Å) than that measured in the neutral molecule. The above features are relevant to the states of CO2 coordinated in different ways to various metal systems (Fig. 4).
2.2. Spectroscopic (IR, UV, NMR) properties of CO2
IR and NMR spectroscopies have been widely employed as diagnostic tools of the state of the CO2 molecule and even for quan- titative determinations. UVvisible spectroscopy has found less extensive use. However, the spectroscopic properties of CO2 in the UV region are of fundamental importance for understanding the photochemistry of this molecule [19].
Fig. 5 summarizes the spectroscopic properties of CO2 in the IR region [2123].
Table 2 compares the IR fundamental frequencies of gaseous CO2 with those measured for gaseous CO2 + [24] and for CO2 isolated in solid neon [25,26] where the radical anion is free from interac- tions with metal cations. In the IR spectrum of CO2 , because of the bent geometry (C2v) of the anion, all the three normal vibration modes are IR active. The stretching frequencies are shifted to lower values, which reflect a reduced average CO bond order (1.5 in CO2
vs 2 in CO2).
As it will be discussed later, the formation of CO2 metal complexes or, more generally, CO2-adducts can originate large modifications in the
IR
spectrum of the
CO2
moiety [27].
The antisymmetric stretching mode, ma(OCO), falls in the range 22501400 cm1,the symmetric stretching mode,ms(OCO),becomes IR-active and can absorb in the region 14001100 cm1,the bending mode d(OCO) is shifted from 667 cm1. Additional vibrational modes, such as metalcarbon and/or metaloxygen stretching modes, C@O out-of-plane deformation, may be observed in the low-frequency region (down to 300 cm1). The latter spec- troscopic features can provide useful information on the bonding mode of the heterocumulene in the adduct, so that IR is quite diag- nostic for understanding the state of CO2 interacting with metal systems (atoms or complexes).
Carbon dioxide is transparent in the visible and near-to-middle ultraviolet regions, at least down to 210 nm (hm < 5.91 eV), both in the liquid phase and in the gas phase [20]. Only weak absorptions can be observed below 11 eV, in the vacuum ultraviolet region, at
147.5 (8.41 eV), 133.2 (9.31 eV) and 112.1 nm (11.08 eV), respec-
tively. Above 11 eV there are several Rydberg series converging to the various states of CO2 +.
CO2 dissolved in a nonpolar solvent (benzene, toluene) displays only one 13C NMR signal around 124 ppm. In aqueous solutions,the resonance is close to 125 ppm and can be used for the quantifi- cation of free CO2. 13C NMR has proved to be a very useful spectro- scopic technique for identifying the CO2 moiety incorporated into a metal-compound (metal complexes, metal-carbamates LnM (O2CNR2), metal-hemicarbonates LnM(O2COR), metal-carboxylates LnM(O2CR),metallacarboxylic acids LnM(CO2H),metallaesters LnM(CO2R)) [28] or organic products, such as carbamic acids or carbamates (150160 ppm),carbonates (145165 ppm),acids (160180 ppm), esters (160170 ppm).
2.3. Main features of carbon dioxide reactivity
The MOs most relevant to the chemical reactivity of carbon dioxide are the doubly occupied non-bonding 1pg orbitals (HOMOs), mainly localized on the end oxygen atoms, and the empty antibonding 2pu orbitals (LUMOs), mostly centered on the carbon (Fig. 3). Therefore, CO2 can be considered an amphoteric molecule, as it can act as an acceptor of electrons at the C-atom (through the LUMOs) and a donor of electrons via the O-atoms (through the HOMOs).Electron poor centers (electrophiles such as the proton, metal centers in high oxidation state, and electron deficient molecules) are expected to attack CO2 at the O-atom. Noteworthy, CO2 dis- plays a weak basic character, as demonstrated by the value of pro- ton affinity of this molecule (Eq. (5)). The commonly accepted Fig. 5.

CO2  H ! HOCO
5 The electrophilic character of carbon dominates over the weak nucleophilic properties of the oxygen atoms. Consequently, CO2 is a better acceptor than donor of electron density. Electrons and electron rich species will easily interact with CO2 at the C-atom.
This reactivity is exemplified by the direct non metal-mediated reactions of CO2 with electron rich anionic or neutral species such as, for instance, H (Eq. (6)), OH (Eq. (7)), amines (vide infra).

2 7 Reaction of ionic (Group 1 or 2) hydrides with CO2 to afford the relevant formate (Eq. (5)), albeit known since long time, has never found any practical application for the synthesis of formates, which are more conveniently synthesized by reaction of CO and the metal hydroxides.
The reaction of CO2 with ionic metal hydroxides [M(OH)n] (Eq. (7)) involves the nucleophilic attack of the anion (OH) to the electrophilic carbon of CO2 [30]. The interest for this reaction is linked to its utilization for the separation of CO2 from flue gases [31] or for the fixation of CO2 into inorganic carbonates (Eq. (8)) that are under consideration for the safe long-term storage of
CO2 [32,33].

Under strictly anhydrous conditions, tertiary aliphatic amines do not absorb CO2, but aliphatic primary and secondary amines do and form the corresponding ammonium carbamates (Eq. (9)) [34,35] or the relevant carbamic acid (Eq. (10)) which may be stabilized in a dimeric form through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, both in solution [37] and in the solid state [38]. Carbamic moieties play a key role as intermediates in several biological processes,such as carboxylations by biotin enzymes and photosynthetic activation of CO2 promoted by RuBisCO (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxidase) [39].

10 Different mechanisms have been proposed for the conversion of amine and CO2 into alkylammonium carbamate [40], which may involve the intermediate formation of a zwitterionic species (Scheme 1) [41], or take place through a termolecular single step (Scheme 2) [42]. Base B in Schemes 1 and 2 is the amine itself under anhydrous conditions, but in an aqueous medium such role may be played by H2O or OH. Whatever may be the working mechanism, the key feature of the carbamation process is the attack of the electron rich amine to the C-atom of CO2.
CO2 displays its amphoteric character in the reactions with frus- trated Lewis pairs (FLPs) (Scheme 3) [4346].
The interest for FLPs as potential systems for activating the heterocumulene has markedly grown in the last few years [47].
Remarkably, B/N, B/P, or Al/P based FLPs can also effect the stoi- chiometric or catalytic reduction of the activated CO2 moiety upon treatment with an appropriate reducing agent such as hydrobo- ranes or hydrosilanes [4850]. Hydroboration and hydrosilylation of CO2 to methoxyboranes and methoxysilanes, respectively, are of significant academic interest, but remain costly processes with- out industrial utility. Of greater interest, in this context, may be the use of a reducing agent such as H2 [51], which is known to be heterolytically activated by several FLPs. To date, this intriguing field is still poorly investigated, but requires greater attention as it may open perspectives toward the metal-free (or organic) cat- alytic reduction of the heterocumulene.

The reactivity patterns outlined above can be recognized easily when considering the behavior of CO2 as a ligand or, more generally, the interaction of CO2 with metal centers.

In fact, most reactions based on the uti- lization of CO2 are driven by metal systems. Understanding the interaction of the cumulene with metal centers, as well as the reac- tivity of coordinated CO2, may be of great help in developing new catalysts for CO2 conversion.
2.4.1. CO2 coordination to metal centers
The basic coordination modes of CO2 to a single metal center are shown in Fig. 6 [53,54].
They reflect in a clear way the ability of CO2 to act as a pure C-electrophile, (g1-C coordination), or O-nucleophile, linking the metal through oxygen (g1-O or end-on coordination), or also to act as an acceptor and donor of electron density, interacting, thus,with the metal center through the C and O atoms, as in the case of side-on (g2-C,O) coordination. The mode of bonding of CO2 to metal centers has been extensively reviewed [5254], therefore we discuss here only selected cases, which can be relevant to catalytic processes.
Side-on coordination represents by far the most common bonding mode of CO2. In [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2] (Cy = cyclohexyl) [55],the first crystallographically characterized metalCO2 complex,the NiAC and NiAO1 bond distances are, respectively, 1.84 and
1.99 Å, showing that both carbon and one of the oxygen atoms
are bound to the nickel center,which exhibits a planar coordination.
The coordinated CO2 molecule looses the original D1h symme- try, typical of the free ligand: the measured lengths for the CAO1 and CAO2 bonds (Fig. 7) are, respectively, 1.22 and 1.17 Å, while the value of the OCO angle is 133. The deviation of the coordinated CO2 molecule from linearity is well in accordance with the features foreseen considering the Walsh diagram.
Examples of bis(carbon dioxide) side-on complexes are also known, but only with molybdenum. An example is provided by trans-Mo(CO2)2HN(CH2CH2PMe2)2(PMe3) [56]. The complex has a distorted octahedral geometry with two staggered CO2 ligands g2-C,O-coordinated to Mo. The CO2 ligands show CAO lengths ranging from 1.199 to 1.284 Å and OCO angles of 131.
The dinuclear complex [(IPr)Ni]2(l-CO) (l-g2,g2-CO2) (IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) docu- ments an interesting case of a l2-g2,g2-coordination, in which each C@O bond of the bridging CO2 ligand is, respectively, side- on coordinated to a Ni atom [57] (Fig. 8). In principle, side-on adducts may be considered as three-membered oxametallacycles resulting from a formal oxidative addition of one of the p-bonds of the CO2 ligand to the metal center or as p-complexes, wherein the metalCO2 interaction involves both electron donation from the O-centered 1puy(5a1) and 1pgy(4b2) orbitals of CO2 to empty d-orbitals of M and, at a greater extent, electron back-donation from a filled d-orbital of metal to the empty C-centered 2puy(6a1) orbital of the ligand [58].
This point is relevant to the definition of the oxidation state of the metal center M: is it zero, one or two? However, whatever model may be followed, in these systems the CO2 ligand always acts simultaneously as electron-donor through an end oxygen and electron-acceptor at the central carbon. The ability of CO2 to act as a bifunctional system is further documented by the plethora of CO2 complexes in which the cumulene bridges two or more metal centers through carbon and one or both oxygens [5254].

(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.04.003 g1-C(CO2) transition metal complexes are less common.
Rh(diars)2(Cl)(CO2) (diars = o-phenylene-bis(dimethyl)arsine) pro- vides an example of the behavior of CO2 ligand acting as a only- C-electrophile (Fig. 9) [59]. Rh is essentially octahedral with the CO2 ligand trans to chlorine and interacting with the nucleophilic metal center through the central carbon (g1-C coordination). In the adduct, the C-O distances, 1.20(2) and 1.25(2) Å respectively,are longer than in the free cumulene, while the OCO angle is
126. The above structural data indicate an important pouring of
electron density from metal into the empty antibonding 2pu(6a1) orbital, which weakens the CAO bonds and causes a remarkable bending of the coordinated CO2 molecule (Fig. 4). g1-C coordination has been claimed or demonstrated also in a few other Rh, Ir and Ru complexes [6062]. Generally, g1-C com- plexes are less stable than g2-C,O complexes and are regarded as reversible carriers of carbon dioxide. The stability of the MAC bond strongly depends on the donor properties of the metal center. Often g1-C complexes can be further stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between the O-atom of CO2 ligand and hydrogen donor centers [63]. As discussed below, the interac- tion with external Lewis centers may also occur. It is worth noting that such an interaction may play a key role in stabilizing adducts of CO2 also with non-metal species. In 1,3-dimethylimidazolium-2-c arboxylate,obtained by reaction of 1-methylimidazole with dimethyl carbonate [64],the imidazolium C-carbene binds CO2 at C by using the free couple of electrons. The resulting C ? CO2 moiety is formally similar to the M ? CO2 system: in the solid adduct, the carboxylate moiety is stabilized through the interaction of the nucleophilic O-atoms with the imidazolium- ring hydrogens. In the last two decades, the chemistry of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with CO2 has received great atten- tion and NHCs and related complexes offer interesting perspectives as potential systems for capture, fixation, and activation of CO2 [65].
End-on (g1-O) coordination mode has remained elusive for a long time. Only more recently, a few genuine examples of isolated and structurally characterized adducts in which CO2 acts exclusively as an O-nucleophile (g1-O or end-on coordination) have been described in the literature [6669].
The uranium-complex (AdArO)3tacnU(g1-OCO) ((AdArO)3 tacn = 1,4,7-tris(adamantyl-5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)1,4,7- triazacyclononane), obtained by reacting the complex (AdArO)3 tacnUIII with CO2 has provided the first evidence of (g1-O) coordi- nation [66,70]. The OCO moiety is almost linear (OCO angle = 178) with the terminal CO bond length (1.277(4) Å) longer than the internal CO bond distance (1.122(4) Å). The structural data show that, when CO2 behaves exclusively as an O-nucleophile, the coor- dinated CO2 molecule essentially retains its original linear geome- try or undergoes only slight distortion from linearity, as expected when there is not a significant back-donation of electron density into the 2pu orbitals of the heterocumulene.
Examples of l-g1(O), g1(O) coordination have been also described and structurally characterized [68,69]. In these systems the CO2 molecule bridges two distinct metal centers through the end O atoms as shown in Fig. 10. Systems of particular applicative interest are represented by a few polyoxometalate anions, such as for instance (H2PMo11CoO40)5, which reacts with aqueous CO2 affording the CO2-adduct (C3H5N2)3(C3H4N2)(PMo11CoO38(CO2)) 4H2O, where CO2 is (l-g1,g1) coordinated through the end oxygen atoms [69]. This compound consists of (PMo11CoO38)n polymeric chains bridged by the almost linear CO2 ligand (OCO angle: 158) in an axial direction. Such behavior is of great interest as it opens an intriguing perspective on the use of polyoxometalates as CO2 capturing agents in aqueous medium.
Further insight in understanding the reactivity of CO2 with metal centers comes from the study of the interaction of the CO2 molecule with naked metal atoms in a gas matrix at low temper- ature (<20 K). FTIR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT), are helpful in discovering their behavior [71], the most fre- quently observed reactions being the formation of a metal complex and the insertion into one the C@O bonds, depending on the nature of the metal [72], i.e. its oxophilicity.For instance, early transition metals (strong oxophiles) exhibit a different behavior relative to late transition metals [71,72]. Ti, V and Cr (or early transition metals, in general) insert spontaneously into one of the C@O bonds yielding oxo-carbonyl species OM(CO) even without energy barrier (Ti), while Fe, Co, Ni, Ag and Cu (late transition metals)] form 1:1 M(CO2) adducts in which the cumu- lene may display different coordination modes, depending on metal. A side-on bonding was found for Ni, an O-end-on for Cu, a g1-C for Fe and Co. Noteworthy, in a few cases, the same coordina- tion modes were found for naked atoms and the relevant metal complexes, which is not a general rule as the ancillary ligands L may significantly influence the behavior of the metal center toward CO2, influencing the electron density and governing the space availability [70].
2.4.2. Reactivity of coordinated CO2
Coordination of carbon dioxide to a metal center produces marked changes of the structural and spectroscopic (IR, 13C NMR) properties of the cumulene (loss of linearity; elongation of C@O bonds; shift of the IR frequencies and 13C NMR resonance) [73].
The question rises whether coordinated CO2, in whatever form in metalcomplexes, can be considered an activated form with respect to the free molecule, and, thus, which are the effects of coordination on the reactivity of the cumulene and if there is a pre- ferred mode of bonding for the conversion of CO2. Also, one can ask whether spectroscopic data can be informative about the mode of bonding of the cumulene and can, thus, be used for predicting its reactivity. The rationalization of the whole matter is far from hav- ing been accomplished and further fundamental studies are still necessary. Another intriguing issue that must be addressed when investigating the reactivity of CO2metal complexes in solution is relevant to the fluxionality of the bonded cumulene: does CO2 maintain the same mode of bonding in solution as in the solid state for a given adduct? This key aspect has been addressed only in a very few cases. For instance, 31P and 13C VT NMR studies carried out on [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2] have allowed to conclude that in solution,at 173 K, carbon dioxide is bonded to Ni as in the solid state, but at room temperature carbon dioxide is fluxional with an intramolec- ular motion that, most likely, involves the disanchorage of the car- bon atom from nickel (Fig. 7, bottom) to afford an g1-O intermediate [74]. Such fluxionality makes the two phosphines equivalent in solution at room temperature, which are not equiva- lent in the solid state (Fig. 7).
In principle, coordinated carbon dioxide can undergo either electrophilic or nucleophilic attack. In general, the C-atom of CO2 bound to a metal in the g1-C or g2-C,O-coordination mode is expected to be less prone to react with nucleophilic species than the free molecule. However, if g1-O-coordination of cumulene is considered, then the nucleophilic attack at C should be a more likely process. However, reactions of CO2 complexes with nucle- ophiles are poorly documented in the literature and knowledge in this field is very lacunose. A nucleophilic attack has been pro- posed to be working in the Wittig-like reaction of (PCy3)2Ni(g2- CO2) with Me3P = CH2 ylide to give the ketene complex (Cy3P)2Ni (g2-C,O)-CH2CO and Me3PO [75].

(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.04.003 formation of CAC bonds and opens a question about the necessity to have a coordinated CO2 because a CAC coupling may occur.
Electrophilic attack is better documented. Both g1-C and side- on coordinated CO2 have been shown to display an enhanced reac- tivity at oxygen toward electrophiles and electrophilic attack is the prevalent reactivity of CO2-bridged complexes with alkali cations [60,7678].
Of great interest is the protonation of coordinated CO2, which may occur under very mild conditions (<273 K) and affords CO as product. The electrons required for the reduction of CO2 to CO are provided by the metal (Eq. (11)), which is oxidized, or may be furnished by an external source.LnMCO2  2H ! LnM2  CO  H2O 11 The utilization of PhSH as source of protons and electrons in the reaction with (PCy3)2Ni(g2-CO2) has been demonstrated, providing an interesting biomimetic system [79]. Unfortunately, in this sys- tem CO remains tightly bound to Ni and diphenyldisulfide adds oxidatively to Ni(0) to give P2Ni(SPh)2 (Eqs. (12)(14)). These events prevent the reduction process to proceed catalytically with respect to nickel.PhSH ! PhS H  e 12 2PhS ! PhS  SPh 13 P2NiCO2  2H  2e ! \P2NiCO"  H2O 14 The above process (Eq. (11)) is strictly related to the more gen- eral reaction of dissociative reduction of CO2 to CO (Eq. (15)).
This is the simplest way to convert CO2. The process is very energy

DG1000K  190:5 kJ=mol 15 intensive, and, can be carried by a thermal (a high T > 1200 K) or a radiative route (using high energy radiations, <160 nm). As shown in Fig. 11a, this process is of great applicative interest if energy from natural sources other than fossils fuels (for instance concentrators of solar power, CSP) are used, as the formed CO, in turn, is both an energy source and a synthetically exploitable source of carbon.A cyclic process that runs on CO2CO couple and makes use of perennial energy sources (solar energy) as energy input is very appealing. Metal oxides (Eqs. (16) and (17)) are under considera- tion as catalysts for such reaction using concentrators of solar power (CSP) that allow to operate at high temperature. When CO2 splitting is coupled with water splitting using CSP, it is possible to produce Syngas (plus oxygen) from CO2 and water, and, thus,liquid fuels by Fischer Tropsch.MOx  Energy ! MOx1  1=2O2 16 MOx1  CO2 ! MOx  CO 17 This high-temperature catalytic splitting is of great importance for the exploitation of CO2 and H2O as source of Syngas for the pro- duction of solar liquid fuels (methanol, DME, gasoline, diesel).CAO bond cleavage with consequent formation of CO and O transfer to an oxophile is a reaction frequently observed for g2- and g1-C CO2-complexes. The effect of coordination to a metal is evident as the deoxygenation of CO2 can be performed even at room temperature using the suited metal center and an oxophile.Formed CO is often found coordinated to the metal center. The oxo- phile acts as oxygen sink. Both these features contribute to drive the dissociative reduction of CO2 to the right. The role of O-sink may be played by the metal atom itself (Eq. (18)) [80], or with less oxophilic metals (late transition metals, for instance) by CO2 itself (Eq. (19)) [81] with conversion of two CO2 molecules into CO e

2, or by a ligand. For instance, phosphines, PR3 [55], can be con- verted by this way into their oxides (O = PR3) (Eq. (20)), products of very limited utility and difficult to reduce back to the parent com- pounds if not using energy intensive reducing agents (metals) which cancel out the benefit of having the CO2 splitting running at room temperature.

20 In principle, the deoxygenation process can be coupled with the production of useful chemicals, for instance by using as the oxo- phile a suitable organic substrate (Sub, in Fig. 11b). Such applica- tion may be limited by the market of the species Sub = O that can be generated. Suitable O-acceptors may be olefins (Eq. (21)) as their oxidized forms (epoxides) may have wide market as mono- mers for polymers. Eq. (21) is not a straightforward process and may occur if mediated by metal oxides as catalysts in a two-step process: transfer of O-atom from a metal oxide to the olefin [82] and reoxidation of the reduced oxide with CO2. 21 The epoxide can react with CO2 to afford a cyclic carbonate. To date, this process, although of interest, has been demonstrated only at the laboratory scale.
The use of CO2 as soft and selective oxidant has been demon- strated in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to afford styrene (Eq. (22)) [83].

24 As H2O and CO can be processed to afford H2 and CO2 (WGS) (Eq. (23)), the net reaction is represented in Eq. (24) in which CO2 acts as promoter of the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene favoring milder conditions and higher selectivity with respect to pure dioxygen.
Currently the role of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been extended to oxidative coupling of methane to ethane and ethylene and oxida- tive dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons (such as propane to propene) and there is still a lot of scope for its use in other reac- tions [83].

2.4.3. Relevance of CO2 coordination to chemical utilization of CO2.
Synthesis of formic acid The use of CO2 as synthon in chemical synthesis for manufactur- ing bulk or fine chemicals has been pursued since the 1980s. A key issue is the relevance of CO2 coordination in such processes: is CO2 coordination a strict prerequisite for its conversion? An answer can be given only by mechanistic studies on reactive systems. Any a priori attempt to foresee the behavior of reactive systems is a pure guess. The thermal lability of CO2 complexes and their tendency to dissociate coordinated CO2 may add complexity and uncertainty to the problem. As an example, let us consider the reaction of (PCy3)2Ni(CO2) with dioxygen: the product would be the peroxo- carbonate (PCy3)2Ni(CO4) (Eq. (25)) and one would foresee that reaction (25) may proceed via O2 insertion into the NiAC bond of the g2-C,O form.
PCy32NiCO2s  O2g ! PCy32NiCO4s 25 Detailed mechanistic studies have shown that it proceeds instead through carbon dioxide decoordination, dioxygen coordi- nation to Ni, and CO2 insertion into the OAO bond of the newly formed, reactive (PCy3)2Ni(O2) complex [84]. Interestingly, using the (PPh3)3RhCl(O2) complex and labeled O2 and CO2 species
(16O2, 18O2, 16O2
12C, 18O2
12C, 16O2
13C) it has been confirmed using FTIR and NMR studies that the formation of the peroxocarbonate moiety occurs via CO2 insertion into the OAO bond more than into the RhAO bond of the dioxygen-Rh complex [85].
However, whether or not the coordination of CO2 is a prerequi- site for further reaction depends on the kind of reaction CO2 has to undergo. For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation at O). In other cases, CO2 pre-coordination to metal centers may not be necessary, as discussed later on.
The insertion reactions of CO2 into MAE (E = H, C, N, O, etc.) bonds are key steps of stoichiometric processes and catalytic cycles implying CO2 incorporation into organic substrates with the gener- ation of a new EAC bond. Often these reactions are initiated by nucleophilic attack of E (in MAE) at the electrophilic carbon of CO2 and assisted by weaker interactions between the metal center and the lone pairs of one of the O-atoms of the cumulene.
