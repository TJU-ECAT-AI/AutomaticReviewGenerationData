1. Introduction
Among the greenhouse gases, CO2 is the prime gas responsible for the enhanced greenhouse effect and accounts for 70% [1]. The atmospheric CO2 has amplified by one-third since the inception of the industrial revolution, which is further predicted to be 570 ppm by the end of this century [2,3]. There is an appreciable correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and global temper- ature trends. As a result, chemical fixation of CO2 into value-added compounds is an important strategy for mitigation of CO2 and also a topic of huge interest in terms of green and sustainable chemistry [1,4]. Mitigation of CO2 can play a pivotal role in combating the greenhouse effect and global warming. Even though CO2 is an economical, safe, and renewable C1 feedstock, but its utilization as a chemical feedstock is limited due to its high thermodynamic stability. Consequently, large amounts of energy and/or high energy substrates are typically required to transform the CO2 into chemicals [57]. Hydrogen is a high energy gas and can be used for CO2 transformation as a reagent. CO2 acts as a hydrogen acceptor (soft oxidant) in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to shift the reaction equilibrium toward olefin side. It also offers several pronounced advantages to overcome deep oxidation, low product selectivity, and the formation of greenhouse gas CO2 as a byproduct, which are usually encountered in the conventional processes [8,9]. In addition, the ODH with CO2 has also been considered as a potential way to lessen the negative impact of dangerous oxidant-paraffin mixture [10].
Production of olefins from their respective hydrocarbons is an industrially important reaction. The 1,3-butadiene is a versatile monomer used for synthesis of polymers, synthetic rubbers,plastics with special mechanical properties, and also as a raw material for a variety of chemicals synthesis [11]. Recently, a few studies have been reported in the literature for the production of butenes through the ODH of n-butane (nB) with CO2 [1216]. Ge et al. have investigated the influence of CO2 in the ODH of nB with oxygen over VMgO catalyst [14]. It was found that an increase in CO2 partial pressure improves the selectivity and yield of C4 dehydrogenation products. But, a clear decrease in the catalytic activity with CO2 alone as the oxidant was reported. A decrease in the catalytic activity with CO2 (absence of oxygen) was also noted over TiP2O7 catalysts [15]. The poor performance of the catalysts in the presence of CO2 could be due to the lack of reoxidation efficiency of the catalyst surface or strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface [14,15].

The CO2 promoted oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane was investigated over mixed metal oxide supported vanadium catalysts. The investigated mixed metal oxide supports namely, CeO2ZrO2 (CZ) and TiO2ZrO2 (TZ) were synthesized by coprecipitation method, and the vanadium oxide was deposited on the supports by wet impregnation method. The synthesized samples were characterized by BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The XRD analysis of CZ and CZ supported V2O5 samples revealed the formation of CexZr1xO2 solid solution and a highly dispersed vanadium oxide over the CZ support, respectively. On the other hand, different mixed oxide phases (ZrV2O7 and TiZrO4) were observed in the case of TZ supported vanadia catalyst. The TPR reduction temperature of supported samples is lower than the bulk V2O5. XPS results revealed that vanadium and cerium are in V5+ and Ce4+/ Ce3+ oxidation states, respectively. Among the investigated catalysts, the CZ supported vanadium oxide catalyst exhibited a high activity and good time-on-stream stability. The redox property of the catalyst significantly influenced the catalytic activity in the ODH of n-butane with CO2. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. * Corresponding author.

All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2013.12.003 nB conversion was observed over Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported- oxidized diamond catalysts compared to simple dehydrogenation with Ar [13]. In our previous reports [12,17], a significantly high nB conversion and C4 olefins (1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene,and 1,3-butadiene) selectivity were noted in the ODH of nB with CO2 as compared to dehydrogenation of nB with N2 over mixed metal oxide supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Furthermore, the vanadium oxide supported on mixed metal oxides also exhibited high catalytic activity compared to its individual oxides supported vanadia catalysts. The high activity of mixed oxide supported vanadia catalysts is mainly due to superior acidbase bifunctionality and reducibility of the dispersed vanadium oxide [12]. The existence of synergetic effect in mixed oxide materials plays an important role in enhancing the catalytic activity [12,18]. However, catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide is strongly influenced by the specific oxide employed as the support [1922].
TiO2ZrO2 mixed oxide has received a tremendous attention recently as active catalyst and catalyst support for a wide variety of reactions owing to its significant features that include high specific surface area, profound acidbase properties, high thermal stability,and strong mechanical strength [23]. Ceria-based mixed oxides are also receiving much attention as catalysts, supports, and promo- ters due to their high oxygen-storage capacity (OSC) and facile oxidation/reduction of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple. Ceria-based mixed oxides are active catalysts for oxidation of various compounds such as hydrocarbons, soot, and CO [2426]. The presence of CeO2 promotes various catalytic reactions namely, CO2 activation [27], low-temperature watergas shift reaction [28],and so on. The unique oxygen storage/release capacity and redox properties of CeO2 are known to suppress the deactivation of the catalysts under rigorous reaction conditions. The CeO2V2O5 combination catalyst also showed a remarkably high activity and stability for ODH of aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2 [29].
In the present study, the oxidizing ability of V2O5 has been exploited by supporting it on the redox featured CeO2ZrO2 and TiO2ZrO2 mixed oxides. These supports were synthesized through a soft-chemical route by adopting a coprecipitation method, and the V2O5 was deposited over the calcined support by a wet impregnation method. The structural evolution of catalysts was achieved by using BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD),temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray photoelec- tron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The catalytic performance was evaluated for the ODH of nB to C4 olefins in the vapor phase under normal atmospheric pressure employing CO2 as the soft oxidant.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of catalysts
The MO2ZrO2 (M = Ce (CZ) and Ti (TZ), 1:1 mol ratio) mixed metal oxide supports were prepared by adopting a coprecipitation method using dilute aqueous NH3 (DC Chemicals, Korea) as precipitating reagent. For TZ support, requisite amount of TiCl4 (0.09 M TiCl4 in 20% cold HCl solution, Aldrich, USA) and ZrOCl2 (Aldrich, USA) were dissolved in deionized water to form homogeneous aqueous mixed salt solution under mechanical stirring. To this solution, dilute aqueous NH3 was added drop wise with vigorous stirring until the precipitation was complete at room temperature. The resultant precipitate was aged hydrothermally at 100 8C for 12 h. Thus formed white precipitate was then filtered off,washed several times with deionized water until free from anion impurities. The obtained material was oven dried at 100 8C for 12 h and finally calcined at 600 8C for 6 h in static air. The CZ support was synthesized by using aqueous solution of ceric ammonium nitrate (Aldrich) and ZrOCl2. The dilute ammonium hydroxide was added drop wise to the mixed salt solution until the precipitation was complete. The resulting aged precipitate was filtered off and washed with deionized water. Finally, the sample was oven dried at 100 8C for 12 h, subsequently calcined at 600 8C for 6 h in static air. On the calcined mixed metal oxide supports, V2O5 (12 wt.% on CZ; VCZ and 15 wt.% on TZ; VTZ) was deposited by adopting a standard wet impregnation method. In a typical procedure, the desired quantity of ammonium metavanadate (Aldrich) was dissolved in aqueous oxalic acid solution to form a clear solution at room temperature. To this solution, finely powdered calcined supports were added with continuous stirring. The excess of water was evaporated on a hot plate under vigorous stirring. Finally,materials were oven dried at 100 8C for 12 h and calcined at 600 8C for 6 h in static air.
2.2. Characterization studies
BET specific surface areas were obtained on a TriStar 3000 (Micromeritics Instrument Co., USA) at liquid N2 temperature.
Prior to measurement, the samples were degassed at 300 8C for 3 h to remove any residual moisture. The BET specific surface areas were calculated from adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/Po) range = 0.040.25. XRD patterns of the samples were obtained on a Rigaku diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.154 nm) source and a Scintillation counter detector. The intensity data were collected over a range of 58  2u  808 with a step size and time per step were, respectively, fixed at 0.028 and 1 s. Crystalline phases were identified by comparison with the standard reference data from International Center for Diffraction Data (ICDD) files. The TPR measurements were carried out by using AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics Instrument Co., USA) instrument. In a typical experiment, 100 mg catalyst sample was loaded in a U-shape quartz reactor and pretreated in a flow of helium gas at 300 8C for 1 h and allowed to cool. After this, the analysis was carried out by using 4.95% H2 in helium gas and raising the temperature of the sample from 50 to 700 8C at a heating rate of 10 8C min1. The XP spectra of the samples were recorded on a Shimadzu (ESCA 3400) spectrometer by using Mg Ka (1253.6 eV) radiation as the excitation source. Charging of catalyst samples was corrected by setting the binding energy of the adventitious carbon (C 1s) at
284.6 eV. The XPS analysis was done at ambient temperature and
pressures typically in the order of less than 106 Pa. Prior to analysis, the samples were out-gassed in a vacuum oven overnight.
2.3. Catalytic performance
The catalytic activity for vapor phase ODH of nB with CO2 was investigated in a down flow fixed-bed stainless steel microreactor at normal atmospheric pressure. The catalyst was mixed with inert quartz particles (5070 mesh) with a catalyst to quartz ratio of 1:1 and placed in the isothermal middle part of the reactor, between two flocks of quartz wool. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was preheated at 600 8C for 2 h in the flow of He (25 mL min1). The catalyst pretreatment was further continued another 30 min at the same temperature in the flow of CO2 (25 mL min1). Then nB was introduced through a mass flow controller into the reactor. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) with respect to nB (600 mL h1 g1 cat) and nB to CO2 ratio (1:5) for all runs were kept constant. The reaction products were analyzed by online chromatography (Younlin Instrument, Acme 6000 Series, Korea) equipped with thermal conductivity detector and flame ionization detector. For hydrocarbons analysis, 23% SP-1700 on 80/100 Chromosorb PAW (6 ft  1/8 in.) column was employed and for CO, H2 and CO2, Carbosphere (6 ft  1/8 in.) column was used. The main products that were analyzed include 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene,1,3-butadiene, propane, ethane, methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. BET surface area studies
BET surface areas of CZ, TZ, VCZ, and VTZ samples are presented in Table 1. The specific surface area of TZ and CZ mixed oxide supports are 207 and 67 m2 g1, respectively [29]. Based on the specific surface areas of the support, different loadings of vanadia were selected to achieve the theoretical monolayer coverage over the supports (12 wt.% on CZ and 15 wt.% on TZ) [30]. The vanadia impregnated samples exhibited low surface area than the supports. Among vanadia containing samples, the VTZ exhibited high specific surface area than VCZ. However, the decline in the specific surface area after impregnation with vanadia is generally ascribed to various reasons such as, penetration of the deposited active vanadium oxide species into the pores of the support,narrowing pore diameter, blocking some of the pores, and solid- state reactions between the dispersed active oxide and the supporting oxide [11,17,30].
3.2. XRD studies
The XRD patterns of CZ, VCZ, and VTZ catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in the figure, the CZ and VCZ samples exhibited diffraction lines corresponding to a phase analogous to cubic fluorite type phase of ceria. Moreover, within the detection limits of XRD technique, the diffraction lines pertaining to ZrO2 (monoclinic, tetragonal or cubic) phase were not found. It was confirmed from XRD analysis that the formation of CeO2ZrO2 solid solutions with the cubic structure (Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, PDF-ICDD # 28-0271; Ce0.6Zr0.4O2, PDF-ICDD # 38-1439) [26,31]. Additionally,the impregnated vanadium oxide improved the crystallinity of various phases in the VCZ sample. Hence, it can be inferred from XRD measurements that the dispersed vanadium oxide accelerates the crystallization of CZ solid solution and incorporation of more zirconium into the ceria lattice [31]. However, no crystalline phase ascribed to vanadium oxide was found. Therefore, it can be presumed that the dispersed vanadium oxide is in a highly dispersed or amorphous state on the surface of the CZ support. The TZ support exhibits diffraction lines corresponding to crystalline ZrTiO4 phase when calcined beyond 450 8C [23]. In the case of VTZ catalyst, the diffraction lines of mixed oxide phases, namely, ZrTiO4 and ZrV2O7 were mainly observed, while the peaks of TiO2 (2u = 27.5 and 35.78; rutile phase) other than those of single oxides (monoclinic, tetragonal or cubic ZrO2 and V2O5) were detected in the 2u range of 20808. As envisaged earlier [32], the vanadium oxide reacts preferably with the ZrO2 portion of the ZrTiO4 compound and forms ZrV2O7 with the liberation of TiO2. Thus released portion of TiO2 appears as the crystalline rutile phase.
Generally, in mixed oxide supported vanadia catalysts, vanadium containing new mixed oxide phase is normally observed at high temperatures owing to vanadium oxide selective interaction with one of the metal oxides of the mixed oxide support. However, in case of VCZ sample such phase (CeVO4) was not witnessed. It could be due to the presence of CeVO4 phase in amorphous state or small particle size that was below the detection limit of the XRD technique.
3.3. TPR studies
The reducibility of samples and interaction between the active component and the supporting oxides were studied by H2-TPR. The TPR profiles of CZ, VCZ, and VTZ samples are depicted in Fig. 2. As shown in the figure, a major broad hydrogen consumption peak at 600 8C with a shoulder at low temperature was observed for CZ support. Generally, ceria doped materials strongly favor the reduction, first by coordinately unsaturated surface capping oxygen ions at low temperature followed by bulk oxygen [33].
The observed main and shoulder hydrogen consumption peaks of CZ support are ascribed to surface and bulk reductions, respec- tively [34]. The TZ support exhibits two peaks at high temperatures (748 and 870 8C) [29]. The TPR results confirm that TZ is quite stable which is primarily due to the formation of an amorphous or crystalline ZrTiO4 compound. The reduction of bulk V2O5 has been reported between 531 and 1008 8C with multiple reduction peaks Table 1 BET surface area and binding energy values (O 1s, Ti 2p3/2 and V 2p3/2) of CZ, TZ, VCZ,and VTZ samples.

43 owing to V2O5 ! V6O13 ! V2O4 ! V2O3 [29]. However, the reduc- ibility of V2O5 is strongly influenced by the type and reducibility of the oxide support employed [35]. In vanadia promoted catalysts,the reducibility of vanadium oxide has been shifted to lower temperatures in comparison to the bulk V2O5. Interestingly, in the case of VCZ sample the intensity of main peak enhanced compared to CZ support owing to ceriavanadia mixed oxide phase. An additional peak was noticed at 784 8C attributed to the reduction of CeVO4 to CeVO3. The reduction of dispersed vanadium oxide over the TZ support is expected to reduce at lower temperatures than the bulk V2O5. The TPR analysis clearly exemplified that the reduction peaks of both vanadium oxide supported samples reduced at lower temperatures compared to the bulk vanadium oxide.
3.4. XPS studies
In order to understand the nature of interactions between the supported oxide and the supporting oxides and the oxidation states of the surface species, the synthesized samples have been investigated by XPS technique. The representative photoelectron peaks of V 2p pertaining to both VCZ and VTZ samples are presented together in Fig. 3. The presence of peaks at a binding energy (BE) of 517.2 and 517.0 eV for VCZ and VTZ samples,respectively are attributed to V5+. Which indicate that the vanadium oxide surface species are mostly in fully oxidized state (V5+). It has been reported in the literature that the BE of V 2p3/2 for V5+ oxidation state ranges between 517.4 and 516.4 eV [36,37]. The presence of V5+ oxidation state in the VCZ sample is probably due to the formation of CeVO4, in which vanadium cations are in +5 valent state [38]. In the case of VTZ sample, the crystalline ZrV2O7 compound stabilizes the +5 state of vanadium. The present results are thus corroborating very well with the earlier findings [31,39].
As shown in Fig. 4, the Zr 3d photoelectron peaks of CZ, VCZ, and VTZ samples are found at the BEs of 182.2, 183.2, and 182.5 eV,respectively. After vanadium oxide loading, the Zr 3d BE of VCZ sample increased to 1 eV higher than that of the support which is in good agreement with the literature [31]. The high BE of Zr 3d in VCZ sample signifies the enrichment of zirconium and accounts for the emergence of zirconia-rich composite oxide. The decrease in the Ce/Zr ratio from 2.80 (CZ) to 2.49 (VCZ) also indicates the enrichment of zirconium after the impregnation of vanadia [31].
The core level electron binding energies of Ti 2p and O 1s for various samples are depicted in Table 1. The photoelectron signal of Ti 2p is found at 458.5 eV ascribed to the spin orbital multiplets of Ti 2p3/2 [40]. The BEs of both Zr 3d and Ti 3d reveals the presence of +4 oxidation state for both Zr and Ti. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the Ce 3d core level profiles are more complicated owing to complex nature of the spectra arising not only because of multiple oxidation states, but also due to final state shake down which places a different occupation in the O 2p and Ce 4f valance orbitals. The Ce 3d core level spectrum is composed of five spin-orbit doublets owing to two multiplets, Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2. The XPS bands labeled u (main bands u0 and u, satellite bands u0, u00, and u000) and v (main bands v and v0, satellite bands v0, v00, and v000) are ascribed to Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2 ionizations, respectively. The bands labeled v and v00 have been related to a mixing of Ce 3d9 4f2 O 2p4 and Ce 3d9 4f1 O 2p5 Ce(IV) final states, and the v000 corresponds to the final state of Ce 3d9 4f0 O 2p6 Ce(IV). While, v0 and v0 are due to Ce 3d9 4f2 O 2p5 and Ce 3d9 4f1 O 2p6 final states corresponding to Ce3+.
The similar assignment can be applied to u structures, which correspond to the Ce 3d3/2 levels [31,41]. It can be stated from the results that both CZ and VCZ samples exhibit surface cerium species in Ce+4 and Ce+3 oxidation states. The u000 peak is the most convenient feature to identify the progress of Ce reduction, since it does not overlap with any other peaks. A closer look at the figure shows that a decrease in the intensity of the peak u000 and an increase in the intensity of peaks u0/v0 and u0/v0 that are found after dispersion of vanadium oxide on the CZ support. This significant Fig. 3. V 2p XPS profiles of VOx/CeO2ZrO2 (VCZ) and VOx/TiO2ZrO2 (VTZ) samples.

44 observation manifests that there is an increase in the surface Ce3+ ions. It can be concluded from the XPS results that both CZ and VCZ samples contain surface cerium species in both +4 and +3 oxidation states and the Ce3+ species is predominant in the case of VCZ sample that could be due to the formation of CeVO4.
3.5. Catalytic activity studies
In our previous study, ODH of nB with CO2 as the soft oxidant was investigated over VOx/SnO2ZrO2 catalyst and found that the presence of vanadium oxide and the involvement of
CO2
significantly increase the activity [11]. Therefore, in the present study, ODH of nB was carried out over VOx/MO2ZrO2 (M = Ce and Ti; VCZ and VTZ) samples employing CO2 as the soft oxidant at 600 8C and GHSV of 600 mL h1 g1 catalyst with respect to nB. The nB conversion and the total C4 olefins selectivity are presented in Fig. 6. The conversion of nB over VTZ and VCZ samples was 39.8% and 33.8% at 15 min, respectively. Both samples displayed a decrease in the conversion of nB with reaction time and reached to
28.3% and 28.9% at 60 min, respectively. The rate of decrease in the
conversion over VCZ sample is much lower than that of the VTZ catalyst. Regarding the total selectivity of C4 olefins, a high selectivity was observed over the VCZ sample. The selectivity of total C4 olefins was 50.2 and 25.8% at 15 min for both VCZ and VTZ samples, respectively. Interestingly, rate of decrease in the selectivity over VCZ sample is slower than that of VTZ sample.
The VCZ sample exhibited a total C4 olefins selectivity of 45.5% at 60 min, which is higher than the initial selectivity (25.8%; at 15 min) of VTZ. These results clearly manifest that vanadia supported on CZ exhibits a high and stable catalytic activity for the title reaction in comparison to the TZ supported vanadia catalyst.
The oxygen vacancies or lattice oxygen species generally participate in the ODH of hydrocarbons over metal oxide catalysts [42]. This reaction is believed to proceed via a Marsvan Krevelen (redox)-type reaction mechanism [42]. In redox type mechanism,the lattice oxygen of the catalyst participates in the dehydrogena- tion process to produce respective olefins along with the water,where reduction of higher valence state metal oxide occurs to lower oxidation state (Eq. (1)). Here the CO2 plays a critical role to reoxidize the lower valence metal oxide (Eq. (2)). Under the CO2 flow, both consumption of the lattice oxygen and reoxidation of the vanished lattice oxygen proceeds simultaneously to provide H2O (Fig. 7) [43]. Therefore, the redox cycle over vanadium oxide- loaded catalysts is an important factor in promoting the catalytic activity for ODH of nB with CO2 [43]. The CZ support is a well- known material for its facile Ce4+/Ce3+ redox chemistry and oxygen mobility [44]. The existence of Ce4+/Ce3+ was also confirmed by
XPS. In the vanadia containing catalysts, the catalytic redox cycle is
facile which may be due to the redox cycle of the cerium sites near the vanadium sites. It may vary for most of the supported-vanadia catalysts that work on the redox cycle of vanadium sites [45]. It has been reported in the literature that the key catalytic site in the ODH of propane over ceria supported vanadia catalysts is VOV or V OCe bridging oxygen [45,46]. Martinez-Huerta et al. [45] have reported that the nature of active sites in the case of ethane ODH over the ceria-supported vanadia and CeVO4 catalysts is similar. It implies that the activity for both the systems is comparable because both have same active centers. The common functionality in both the systems is VOCe bond, which is involved in the rate- determining step for ethane ODH [45]. The existence of CeVO4 was confirmed from XPS and TPR studies. Therefore, the catalyst with a combination of vanadia and CZ is expected to exhibit better catalytic activity compared to VTZ. However, further studies are needed to confirm the activity of VCeO4 and ZrV2O7 oxides.
C4H10  MOx ! C4H8  MOx1  H2O ODH by lattice oxygen (1) MOx1  CO2 ! CO reoxidation with CO2 (2) The ODH of nB was also carried out over CZ and TZ supports at 600 8C and GHSV of 600 mL h1 g1 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6, the nB conversion and total C4 olefins selectivity over CZ support is
7.4% and 20.9%, respectively at 15 min. But the support TZ showed
a poor activity (<3% conversion) at 15 min. After dispersion of vanadium oxide on the CZ and TZ, the nB conversion and total C4 olefins selectivity were significantly enhanced. These results obviously exemplify that vanadium oxide plays an important role for ODH of nB with CO2 as the soft oxidant. Interestingly, the rate of decrease in the conversion and selectivity in the case of CZ support was almost similar to VCZ sample and lower in comparison to VTZ sample.Moreover,the
CZ
support exhibited high activity compared to TZ. These results clearly reveal that support plays a critical role for the observed high and stable activity. This is mainly due to the facile oxygen transport from the bulk of cerium oxide solid solution that helps in the prevention of coke formation, which is the main deactivation pathway of these catalysts [29].
The time-on-stream measurements are most significant to understand the behavior of various catalytic systems. Generally,catalyst deactivation is often encountered in the ODH of alkanes.
Therefore, time-on-stream study was performed over VCZ catalyst at 600 8C and GHSV of 600 mL h1 g1 catalyst. The nB conversion and product distribution are shown in Fig. 8. The figure clearly reveals that the VCZ catalyst shows a decline in the conversion of nB and total C4 olefins selectivity with reaction time. Interestingly, Fig. 6.

45 a high selectivity of 1,3-butadiene was noticed at longer reaction times. The selectivity of 1-butene is lower compared to 2-butenes that means the ratio of 1-butene/2-butenes is less than one. The 1- butene/2-butene ratio is 1 and <1 over the catalysts with acidic and basic character on the surface, respectively [47]. The change in the catalyst color and an increase in the weight of the catalyst were observed after the experiment. It is mainly due to formation of coke during the reaction. Coking may be responsible for decline in the catalytic activity i.e. deactivation of the catalyst. Further studies are necesaary to understand the mechanism of coking and deactiva- tion of the catalysts.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, CeO2ZrO2 (CZ) and TiO2ZrO2 (TZ) mixed metal oxide supports were prepared by coprecipitation method and vanadium oxide was deposited on the calcined mixed oxide supports by a wet impregnation method. The characterization results suggested the formation of CeZr solid solutions in the case of CZ support and the CZ supported vanadium oxide (VCZ) catalysts respectively. The deposited vanadium oxide is in a highly dispersed form over the CZ support, whereas TZ supported vanadium oxide (VTZ) catalyst exhibited the formation of new and stable ZrTiO4 and ZrV2O7 compounds. The mixed oxide supports facilitated easy reduction of the vanadium oxide compared to its bulk form. The Ce 3d XPS results indicated the presence of both Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states in CZ and VCZ samples, and the impregnated vanadium is in +5 oxidation state. The ODH of n-butane with CO2 revealed that the reactivity of VCZ sample is much higher than other samples. The presence of vanadium oxide is very important to increase the activity and the support plays a vital role for stable catalytic activity. The redox property of the catalyst significantly influenced the catalytic activity for nB ODH with CO2.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
