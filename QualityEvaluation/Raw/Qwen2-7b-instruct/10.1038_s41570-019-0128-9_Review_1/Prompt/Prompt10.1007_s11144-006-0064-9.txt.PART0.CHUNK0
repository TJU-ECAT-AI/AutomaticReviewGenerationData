Abstract The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene in the presence of carbon dioxide was carried out over supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The influence of the support on the catalytic performance was investigated. The isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity in the presence of carbon dioxide were compared with the results obtained during the dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of helium (inert gas). The catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed techniques (TPR, TPD-NH3, TPD-CO2).

process. For example, in 1996 about 1.93 million tons of isobutene were consumed in Western Europe, not including refinery operations such as alkylation and polymerization. The most important consumer of isobutene (more than 64% of total demand) is fuel industry, where isobutene is the feedstock for synthesis of MTBE, ETBE and isooctane. Moreover, isobutene is polymerized or copolymerized to polyisobutylene and butyl rubber (about 28% of total demand), and is used for impact-resistant and antioxidant additives for plastics, and in many other applications [1, 2].
In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]. We discussed the influence of vanadium loading and the preparation method on the catalyst activity and its phase composition.
This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts. Effects of the support on the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene will be discussed in terms of redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts.

Catalysts preparation
All of the catalysts listed in Table 1 were prepared to contain a nominal 20 wt.% of vanadium pentoxide. Zirconium and lanthanum oxide supported catalysts were prepared by citrate method [4], while the other samples were

295 prepared by impregnation of powdered oxides or Cact particles (0.2-0.3 mm) in
0.1 M citric acid solution of NH4VO3. To form the final bulk catalysts the
VOx/Cact sample was activated in the carbon dioxide flow [5], while the other precursors were calcined in static air at 923 K for 6 h.
Catalysts characterization
The specific surface areas (BET method) of the vanadium oxide supported catalysts were determined at 77 K using nitrogen as the adsorbate.Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR-H2) and desorption (TPD-NH3, CO2) experiments were carried out in A quartz reactor connected on-line with a thermal conductivity detector. Prior to analysis the samples of 200 mg were outgassed in He flow (0.5 h at 873 K, 30 cm3min-1) and than cooled to room temperature. The catalysts were reduced with the mixture of 10 vol.% H2 in argon flow (30 cm3min-1) by increasing the temperature from 300 to 900 K at the heating rate of 10 K min-1. The top temperature was kept constant until the TCD signal returned to the initial values. For the TPD analyzes the ammonia and carbon dioxide were introduced to the reactor at a rate of 30 cm3min-1 for
0.5 h. The unadsorbed gas was flushed off the reactor by flowing helium (60
cm3min-1), and finally the temperature was increased to 873 K at a rate of 10 K min-1. The amount of desorbed species was analyzed on-line.
Catalytic activity tests
The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was carried out at 873 K under atmospheric pressure in a flow-type stainless steel reactor packed with
0.4 g of the catalyst. Prior to the catalytic tests the samples were degassed
under He (35 cm3min-1). After 0.5 h the stream was changed for the mixture of iC4H10 and CO2 or He with 1:6 molar ratio. The reactants and products were analyzed on-line after 0.2 h time-on-stream [4].

The highest isobutene yield reported in the literature (32.6%) for the isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide was obtained over K-Cr-MnO/SiO2, but the temperature of the process was 923 K [6]. In our work, after 0.2 h time-on-stream at 873 K, the highest isobutene yields were achieved over VOx/Cact catalyst, both in CO2 atmosphere (43.8%) and under helium flow (38.7%). The isobutane conversion was equal to 54.8 and 45.5% in the presence and absence of CO2. This indicates that carbon dioxide enhances the activity of the VOx/Cact catalyst. Similar promoting effect of CO2 was observed over the active carbon supported iron oxide and oxidized diamond supported vanadium oxide, but the isobutene yields at 873 K were only 23% and 14% in the presence of CO2, and 17 and 11% in the helium flow respectively [5, 7].
The opposite trend was observed over alumina supported vanadium oxide,where the isobutane conversion in the carbon dioxide atmosphere was much lower than that in the inert gas flow (13.2% and 26.2% respectively). Such significant difference between the catalyst activity in the presence and absence
OGONOWSKI, SKRZYSKA: ISOBUTANE
297 of carbon dioxide is probably caused by the nature of alumina support, which is well known for its acidity and basicity of different strengths [8, 9]. Therefore,the active centers on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst surface might be blocked for the isobutane exposure by the adsorbed CO2. Similar decrease in the catalytic activity in the carbon dioxide atmosphere was observed over vanadium loaded ZnO, where the isobutene yield in He flow was relatively high (10.2%) as compared with the reaction in CO2 (4.7%).
In the case of VOx/SiO2 there were no significant differences in the catalyst performance under helium and carbon dioxide flow. In the both atmospheres the isobutane conversion was around 12%, while the selectivity to isobutene was considerably high, above 90%. The rest of catalysts did not show high activity during the catalytic tests, either in CO2 or in He flow.
Except the unreacted source gas (iC4H10 and CO2), isobutene, propene,methane, hydrogen and carbon oxide predominated among the dehydrogenation products. Small amounts of propane, ethane, ethylene and water were also detected. The formation of CO during the process in He flow indicates the mobility of catalyst lattice oxygen, which became available to interact with the reactants. On the other hand, very high amounts of H2 show that the hydrogen is produced not only by simple dehydrogenation but also by side reactions, such as hydrocarbon decomposition. Moreover, the relatively high CO2 conversion in comparison to the isobutane conversion at given iC4H10 / CO2 molar ratio,proves that CO2 can react both with H2 and coke. Traces of n-butenes were formed only over the most active catalysts (VOx/Cact, VOx/Al2O3, VOx/SiO2 and VOx/ZnO), but selectivity to the isomerization products was not high, about 1- 3%. Presence of n-butenes could be caused by the considerable acidity of the catalysts. Furthermore, the high activity of the catalysts seems to be connected with existence of acidic sites of different strength (Fig. 1). This phenomenon probably is related to the adsorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface.
The TPD profiles can be divided into three temperature regions. The first region within the temperature range of 300-373 K, is usually connected with desorption of the physisorbed NH3 and CO2. Higher temperatures can be assigned to the desorption of chemisorbed species from the sites of different strength: medium (373-573 K) and strong (above 573 K). It is commonly accepted that the crystalline V2O5 exhibits Lewis acidity [8, 10]. Therefore, on the basis of comparing the NH3-TPD profile of the vanadium oxide (prepared in the same manner as the rest of the samples) with the TPD profiles of the tested catalysts, the peaks around 450 and 640 K can be associated with the desorption of coordinatively held NH3 from the Lewis acids sites of different strength. On the other hand, the peaks in the temperature range of 500-550 K are attributed to the desorption of NH3 from the Brnsted acid sites of vanadium oxide adsorbed on the support and the uncovered surface of the oxide carrier [8, 11]. 298

Figure 2 shows the TPR-H2 profiles of the tested catalysts. It is known that the reducibility of the catalysts depends not only on the vanadium loading but also on the support nature, as they can interact with each other [12]. The initial temperature of the H2 uptake is around 500-600 K for the most active catalysts,while the Tmax position is increasing in the sequence Cact<ZnO<TiO2<Al2O3 <ZrO2<SiO2 <La2O3<CeO2, which is in agreement with the earlier report [12].The presence of two peaks on the VOx/TiO2 and VOx/ZnO TPR-H2 profiles can be attributed to the reduction of the vanadium oxide in the following sequence V2O5V2O4V2O3. It is known that the reduction of V2O5 to V2O4 can occur in multiple stages via V6O13 intermediate species [9]. This explains the presence of the third peak on the VOx/SiO2 and VOx/Al2O3 TPR-H2 profiles.The multi-step reduction pattern of zirconium oxide supported catalyst suggests the formation of ZrV2O7 phase [13]. Shift of Tmax to the temperatures above 900 K in the VOx/La2O3, VOx/CeO2 reduction profiles can also be explained by the formation of vanadates [14], while the small hydrogen consumption by VOx/Cact is caused by the presence of vanadium oxide at lower oxidation state [15].

High activity of the VOx/Cact, VOx/Al2O3, VOx/SiO2 and VOx/ZnO can be associated with their lowest initial temperature of reduction. Consequntly, the low reducibility of VOx/La2O3 and VOx/CeO2 at 873 K (the temperature used for the isobutane dehydrogenation tests) gives the catalysts with low activity.
CONCLUSIONS
The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2  ZrO2.
The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with the their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. Moreover, the highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface. Another though undesirable effect of acidity, is the formation of small amounts of the isomerization products (selectivity up to 3%).
The results obtained show that CO2 enhances isobutane conversion in the reaction carried out over VOx/Cact catalyst. Opposite trend is observed when vanadium is supported on the ZnO and Al2O3 surface, what can be explained by the presence of basic sites of medium strength - the catalyst surface can be partially blocked for the isobutane by adsorbed carbon dioxide.
