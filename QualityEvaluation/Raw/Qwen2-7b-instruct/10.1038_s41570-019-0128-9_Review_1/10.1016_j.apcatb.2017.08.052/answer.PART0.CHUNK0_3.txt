FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, compare favorably with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. The support material CeO2 is crucial for the catalyst's performance, influencing its activity and selectivity through its role in providing a suitable surface for the active phase. The composition and structure of the catalyst significantly affect its performance. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts have shown higher activity, selectivity, and stability compared to V2O5 catalysts. Challenges exist in finding an optimal balance between metal components and support material. Potential improvements aim to optimize catalyst activity and selectivity through modifications to its structure or composition.
