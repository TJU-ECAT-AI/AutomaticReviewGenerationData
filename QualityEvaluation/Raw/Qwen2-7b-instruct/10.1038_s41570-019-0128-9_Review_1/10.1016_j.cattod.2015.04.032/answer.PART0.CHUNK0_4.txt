1. CeO2 was found to have a promotional effect on the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) over In2O3, enhancing the catalyst's activity.
2. The presence of CeO2 helped to create more and stabilize oxygen vacancies, which improved the dissociative hydrogen adsorption and increased the amount of bicarbonate species resulting from activated CO2 adsorption.
3. The combination of In2O3 and CeO2 resulted in enhanced activity for RWGS compared to pure In2O3, due to the synergistic effect between the two materials.
4. There was a slight red shift observed for the peaks at 131 cm1 after the reaction, possibly indicating changes in the phase structures of the catalysts.
5. The figure illustrates the relationship between the activities of the catalysts and the most significant factors influencing their performance, such as oxygen vacancies and active sites.

1. CeO2被发现能够促进In2O3在RWGS过程中的活性。
2. CeO2的存在有助于创造更多的氧空位，并稳定这些空位，从而增强离解氢吸附并增加激活CO2吸附后形成的碳酸氢盐物种的数量。
3. In2O3和CeO2的组合导致了与纯In2O3相比，RWGS活性的增强，这是由于两种材料之间的协同效应。
4. 反应后观察到131 cm1处的峰略有红移，可能表明催化剂结构的变化。
5. 图表展示了催化剂活性与决定其性能的关键因素（如氧空位和活性位点）之间的关系。
