<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In the investigation of the promotion effect of CeO2 on RWGS over In2O3, it was found that the surface areas of the In2O3CeO2 catalysts increase compared to pure In2O3. As the fraction of CeO2 in the In2O3CeO2 samples increases, the size of the In2O3 particles decreases. The presence of CeO2 facilitates the creation of more and stabilized oxygen vacancies, enhancing the dissociative hydrogen adsorption and increasing the amount of bicarbonate species generated from activated CO2 adsorption. The combined effect of In2O3 and CeO2 results in the In2O3CeO2 catalysts showing improved activity for RWGS compared to pure In2O3.

在对CeO2促进In2O3上RWGS效果的实验研究中，发现In2O3CeO2催化剂的表面积与纯In2O3相比有所增加。随着CeO2在In2O3CeO2样品中的比例增加，In2O3粒子的尺寸减小。CeO2的存在有助于创造更多的稳定氧空位，增强脱附氢吸附，并增加激活CO2吸附后形成的碳酸根物种的数量。In2O3和CeO2的协同效应使得In2O3CeO2催化剂在RWGS反应中的活性优于纯In2O3。

[1] "The textural properties of pure In2O3 and pure CeO2 are very different."
[2] "For In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples, surface areas show a significant increase as compared with pure In2O3."
[3] "The most important issue is that more oxygen vacancies are created in the presence of CeO2 so that more hydrogen can be dissociatively adsorbed."
[4] "Therefore, the In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples show an increased activity for RWGS."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The textural properties of pure In2O3 and pure CeO2 are notably distinct. In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples exhibit a substantial rise in surface area compared to pure In2O3. Crucially, the presence of CeO2 leads to the creation of more oxygen vacancies, enabling more hydrogen to be dissociatively adsorbed. Consequently, the In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples demonstrate an elevated activity for RWGS.

纯In2O3和纯CeO2的纹理性质大相径庭。In2O3CeO2催化剂样品的比表面积与纯In2O3相比有显著提高。关键的是，CeO2的存在导致生成更多氧空位，从而允许更多的氢被解离吸附。因此，In2O3CeO2催化剂样品表现出更高的RWGS活性。

[2] "In contrast to pure In2O3, the adsorption bands of pure CeO2 remain after desorption for 30 min, indicating that the adsorption of CO2 on CeO2 is strong."

On pure CeO2, absorption bands are observed at 1625, 1407, 1379, 1269, 1215, and 1031 cm−1. Unlike pure In2O3, the adsorption bands on pure CeO2 persist after 30 minutes of desorption, suggesting strong CO2 adsorption on CeO2. The FTIR spectra of CO2 on the mixed In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples exhibit variations. When the spectra resemble those on pure CeO2, the absorption bands are pronounced.

在纯CeO2上，吸收带出现在1625、1407、1379、1269、1215和1031 cm−1处。与纯In2O3不同，纯CeO2的吸附带在30分钟后仍存在，这表明CO2在CeO2上的吸附强度较大。混合In2O3CeO2催化剂样品上的CO2 FTIR光谱显示一些差异。当光谱类似于纯CeO2时，吸收带较强。
