The study investigates the promotion effect of CeO2 on the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction over In2O3. CeO2 increases the surface areas of the In2O3CeO2 catalysts, leading to better dispersion and smaller size of In2O3 particles. It also creates more oxygen vacancies, enhancing dissociative hydrogen adsorption. These oxygen vacancies facilitate the formation of bicarbonate species during CO2 adsorption. The synergistic effect between In2O3 and CeO2 results in an enhanced activity for RWGS, as the catalysts exhibit increased activity over pure In2O3. More specifically, CeO2 increases the surface areas of the catalysts, improves the dispersion of In2O3 particles, and creates oxygen vacancies, which enhance hydrogen adsorption and bicarbonate species formation, thus boosting the RWGS activity.

本研究探讨了铈氧化物（CeO2）对In2O3基催化剂上逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应的促进作用。CeO2增加了In2O3CeO2催化剂的比表面积，使得In2O3颗粒分散得更好且粒径更小。它还生成更多的氧空位，增强氢分子的离解吸附。这些氧空位促进了二氧化碳吸附过程中的碳酸盐物种形成。In2O3与CeO2之间的协同效应导致了RWGS活性的增强，因为催化剂在纯In2O3基础上表现出更高的活性。具体来说，CeO2增加了催化剂的比表面积、改善了In2O3颗粒的分散，并生成氧空位，这增强了氢吸附和碳酸盐物种的形成，从而提高了RWGS活性。
