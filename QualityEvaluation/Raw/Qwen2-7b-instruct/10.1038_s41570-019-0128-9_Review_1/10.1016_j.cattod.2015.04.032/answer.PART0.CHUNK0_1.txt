[1] "The presence of CeO2 increases the surface areas of the In2O3CeO2 catalysts over the pure In2O3."
[2] "In addition, the In2O3 particles in the In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples also show smaller size and better dispersion."
[3] "The most important issue is that more oxygen vacancies are created in the presence of CeO2 so that more hydrogen can be dissociatively adsorbed."
[4] "Furthermore, the generation of bicarbonate species during the CO2 adsorption is also significantly enhanced."
[5] "Therefore, the In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples show an increased activity for RWGS."

The document discusses how In2O3CeO2 catalysts, specifically In2O3 mixed with CeO2, enhance the activity of CO2 conversion through RWGS. The key factors contributing to this improvement are:

1. Increased surface areas of the catalysts, providing more adsorption sites for CO2.
2. Smaller and better dispersed In2O3 particles, facilitating more efficient interactions with CO2.
3. The creation of more oxygen vacancies, allowing for easier dissociative adsorption of hydrogen.
4. Enhanced generation of bicarbonate species during CO2 adsorption, which aids in the activation and conversion of CO2.

These factors collectively lead to a higher activity of In2O3CeO2 catalysts compared to pure In2O3, making them more effective for RWGS.

文档讨论了In2O3CeO2催化剂，特别是In2O3与CeO2混合的情况，如何增强CO2转换通过RWGS的活性。关键因素对这种改进的贡献如下：

1. 催化剂表面积的增加，提供了更多的吸附位点以供CO2使用。
2. In2O3粒子更小且分布更好，有利于更高效的与CO2相互作用。
3. 在CeO2存在下产生更多氧空位，使得氢更容易进行离解吸附。
4. CO2吸附期间生成碳酸盐物种的数量显著增加，这有助于激活和转化CO2。

这些因素共同导致In2O3CeO2催化剂的活性高于纯In2O3，使它们在RWGS中更为有效。
