[3] "In addition, the presence of CeO2 helps to create more, and stabilizes, oxygen vacancies, on which the dissociative hydrogen adsorption is enhanced and the amount of bicarbonate species resulting from activated CO2 adsorption is increased."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In the investigation of the promotion effect of CeO2 on RWGS over In2O3, it was found that the surface areas of the In2O3CeO2 catalysts increase compared to pure In2O3. As the fraction of CeO2 in the In2O3CeO2 samples increases, the size of the In2O3 particles decreases. The presence of CeO2 facilitates the creation of more and stabilized oxygen vacancies, enhancing the dissociative hydrogen adsorption and increasing the amount of bicarbonate species generated from activated CO2 adsorption. The combined effect of In2O3 and CeO2 results in the In2O3CeO2 catalysts showing improved activity for RWGS compared to pure In2O3.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在对CeO2促进In2O3上RWGS效果的实验研究中，发现In2O3CeO2催化剂的表面积与纯In2O3相比有所增加。随着CeO2在In2O3CeO2样品中的比例增加，In2O3粒子的尺寸减小。CeO2的存在有助于创造更多的稳定氧空位，增强脱附氢吸附，并增加激活CO2吸附后形成的碳酸根物种的数量。In2O3和CeO2的协同效应使得In2O3CeO2催化剂在RWGS反应中的活性优于纯In2O3。

[1] "The textural properties of pure In2O3 and pure CeO2 are very different."
[2] "For In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples, surface areas show a significant increase as compared with pure In2O3."
[3] "The most important issue is that more oxygen vacancies are created in the presence of CeO2 so that more hydrogen can be dissociatively adsorbed."
[4] "Therefore, the In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples show an increased activity for RWGS."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The textural properties of pure In2O3 and pure CeO2 are notably distinct. In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples exhibit a substantial rise in surface area compared to pure In2O3. Crucially, the presence of CeO2 leads to the creation of more oxygen vacancies, enabling more hydrogen to be dissociatively adsorbed. Consequently, the In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples demonstrate an elevated activity for RWGS.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
纯In2O3和纯CeO2的纹理性质大相径庭。In2O3CeO2催化剂样品的比表面积与纯In2O3相比有显著提高。关键的是，CeO2的存在导致生成更多氧空位，从而允许更多的氢被解离吸附。因此，In2O3CeO2催化剂样品表现出更高的RWGS活性。

On pure CeO2, absorption bands are observed at 1625, 1407, 1379, 1269, 1215, and 1031 cm−1. Unlike pure In2O3, the adsorption bands on pure CeO2 persist after 30 minutes of desorption, suggesting strong CO2 adsorption on CeO2.

The document discusses how In2O3CeO2 catalysts, specifically In2O3 mixed with CeO2, enhance the activity of CO2 conversion through RWGS. The key factors contributing to this improvement are:

1. Increased surface areas of the catalysts, providing more adsorption sites for CO2.
2. Smaller and better dispersed In2O3 particles, facilitating more efficient interactions with CO2.
3. The creation of more oxygen vacancies, allowing for easier dissociative adsorption of hydrogen.
4. Enhanced generation of bicarbonate species during CO2 adsorption, which aids in the activation and conversion of CO2.

These factors collectively lead to a higher activity of In2O3CeO2 catalysts compared to pure In2O3, making them more effective for RWGS.

文档讨论了In2O3CeO2催化剂，特别是In2O3与CeO2混合的情况，如何增强CO2转换通过RWGS的活性。关键因素对这种改进的贡献如下：

1. 催化剂表面积的增加，提供了更多的吸附位点以供CO2使用。
2. In2O3粒子更小且分布更好，有利于更高效的与CO2相互作用。
3. 在CeO2存在下产生更多氧空位，使得氢更容易进行离解吸附。
4. CO2吸附期间生成碳酸盐物种的数量显著增加，这有助于激活和转化CO2。

这些因素共同导致In2O3CeO2催化剂的活性高于纯In2O3，使它们在RWGS中更为有效。

The study investigates the promotion effect of CeO2 on the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction over In2O3. CeO2 increases the surface areas of the In2O3CeO2 catalysts, leading to better dispersion and smaller size of In2O3 particles. It also creates more oxygen vacancies, enhancing dissociative hydrogen adsorption. These oxygen vacancies facilitate the formation of bicarbonate species during CO2 adsorption. The synergistic effect between In2O3 and CeO2 results in an enhanced activity for RWGS, as the catalysts exhibit increased activity over pure In2O3. More specifically, CeO2 increases the surface areas of the catalysts, improves the dispersion of In2O3 particles, and creates oxygen vacancies, which enhance hydrogen adsorption and bicarbonate species formation, thus boosting the RWGS activity.

本研究探讨了铈氧化物（CeO2）对In2O3基催化剂上逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应的促进作用。CeO2增加了In2O3CeO2催化剂的比表面积，使得In2O3颗粒分散得更好且粒径更小。它还生成更多的氧空位，增强氢分子的离解吸附。这些氧空位促进了二氧化碳吸附过程中的碳酸盐物种形成。In2O3与CeO2之间的协同效应导致了RWGS活性的增强，因为催化剂在纯In2O3基础上表现出更高的活性。具体来说，CeO2增加了催化剂的比表面积、改善了In2O3颗粒的分散，并生成氧空位，这增强了氢吸附和碳酸盐物种的形成，从而提高了RWGS活性。

The In2O3 catalyst shows the best activity for the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) among the tested catalysts. It has a low adsorption energy for CO2, facilitating its activation and conversion. The selectivity towards CO from RWGS remains 100% without producing CH4. The CeO2 catalyst promotes RWGS over In2O3, enhancing the generation of bicarbonate species during CO2 adsorption and increasing the amount of oxygen vacancies. This leads to better dispersion of In2O3 particles and more active sites for the reaction. The relationship between the activities of catalysts and their key factors is illustrated in Figure 9. In pure In2O3, the extra oxygen vacancies generated significantly boost the activity, while in pure CeO2, the amount of reactive sites determines the activity. By combining the effects of oxygen vacancies and active sites, Sample B shows the highest activity for RWGS.

在测试的催化剂中，In2O3催化剂表现出对逆水煤气变换（RWGS）的最佳活性。它对CO2的吸附能低，有利于其激活和转化。从RWGS中选择性地生成CO保持为100%，没有产生CH4。CeO2催化剂促进In2O3上的RWGS，显著增加CO2吸附过程中的碳酸盐物种生成，并增加Ga2O3表面的氧空位量。这导致In2O3颗粒更好地分散并提供更多的活性位点进行反应。图9展示了催化剂活性与其关键因素之间的关系。在纯In2O3中，额外产生的氧空位显著提高了活性，而在纯CeO2中，活性位点的数量决定了活性。通过结合氧空位和添加CeO2到In2O3所产生的活性位点的效果，样品B显示了最高的RWGS活性。
