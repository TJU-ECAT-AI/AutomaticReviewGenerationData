The In2O3 catalyst shows the best activity for the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) among the tested catalysts. It has a low adsorption energy for CO2, facilitating its activation and conversion. The selectivity towards CO from RWGS remains 100% without producing CH4. The CeO2 catalyst promotes RWGS over In2O3, enhancing the generation of bicarbonate species during CO2 adsorption and increasing the amount of oxygen vacancies. This leads to better dispersion of In2O3 particles and more active sites for the reaction. The relationship between the activities of catalysts and their key factors is illustrated in Figure 9. In pure In2O3, the extra oxygen vacancies generated significantly boost the activity, while in pure CeO2, the amount of reactive sites determines the activity. By combining the effects of oxygen vacancies and active sites, Sample B shows the highest activity for RWGS.

在测试的催化剂中，In2O3催化剂表现出对逆水煤气变换（RWGS）的最佳活性。它对CO2的吸附能低，有利于其激活和转化。从RWGS中选择性地生成CO保持为100%，没有产生CH4。CeO2催化剂促进In2O3上的RWGS，显著增加CO2吸附过程中的碳酸盐物种生成，并增加Ga2O3表面的氧空位量。这导致In2O3颗粒更好地分散并提供更多的活性位点进行反应。图9展示了催化剂活性与其关键因素之间的关系。在纯In2O3中，额外产生的氧空位显著提高了活性，而在纯CeO2中，活性位点的数量决定了活性。通过结合氧空位和添加CeO2到In2O3所产生的活性位点的效果，样品B显示了最高的RWGS活性。
