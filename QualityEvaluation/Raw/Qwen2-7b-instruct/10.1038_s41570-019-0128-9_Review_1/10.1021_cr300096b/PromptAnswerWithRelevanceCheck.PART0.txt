[2] "Siani et al. have proposed that the increased activity for CO oxidation correlates with the extent of PtFe interactions and the strength of CO adsorption."
[3] "When supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), PtCo is highly efficient for CO PROX in a H2-rich gas stream at temperatures below 423 K."
[4] "Findings by Komatsu and Tamura agree that PtCo/SiO2 catalysts are more effective for PROX than either parent metal."
[5] "Aksoylu et al. have proposed that sequential impregnation leads to higher activity because less Pt is alloyed with Sn, making more Pt sites available for CO oxidation."
[6] "Quantum calculations by Glmen et al. on PtSn surfaces show that PtSn bimetallic particles adsorb CO more weakly than Pt alone. The studies also indicate that Sn present in the subsurface configuration strengthens CO adsorption, while neighboring Sn on the surface destabilizes CO adsorption."
[7] "In comparing a series of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts over γ-Al2O3 and TiO2, catalysts containing PtRe and PtCo exhibit a higher WGS activity than Pt, but PtMo, PtSn, and PtCu show a lower WGS activity."
[8] "Additional Re increases the amount of Re on the catalyst surface and leads to an increase in the rate of WGS."
[9] "The introduction of Pt to the Au catalyst leads to the formation of a partially oxidized gold species. The presence of Au and Pt also help keep ceria in a Ce3+ state, which creates oxygen vacancies and aids in the overall activity of the catalyst."

There were corresponding increases in the Pt intensity as the annealing temperature increased."

The document discusses advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, particularly focusing on bimetallic catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts, which exhibit distinct electronic and chemical properties compared to their parent metals, offer the potential to develop catalysts with improved selectivity, activity, and stability. The Ni/Pt system is used as an example to introduce preparation methods and characterization techniques for both bimetallic surfaces and supported catalysts. In the context of surface analysis, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) experiments reveal the annealing behavior of Ni and Pt on a Pt(111) surface. The study shows that the Ni intensity decreases significantly with increasing temperature, indicating diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region, while the Pt intensity increases. This demonstrates the correlation between DFT predictions and experimental measurements, highlighting the ability of bimetallic structures to change under different reaction environments, affecting their catalytic performance for reactions like hydrogenation and oxidation.

The strong correlation between theoretical predictions and experimental outcomes, observed in both model surfaces and nanoparticles, provides evidence for the dynamic nature of bimetallic structures under reaction conditions. This, in turn, impacts the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts for various types of reactions, such as hydrogenation and oxidation, as explained in the subsequent sections.

[1] "The trend in the DFT calculations in Figure 10b also shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) are even weaker than that on PtNiPt(111). Although this might suggest that the former two surfaces would be more active toward hydrogenation than PtNiPt(111); one should keep in mind that the adsorption of cyclohexene needs to be strong enough for the hydrogenation to take place."
[2] "The addition of Sn to the Pt catalysts supported on ZnAlO and mixed spinel Al2O3 has been shown to increase the selectivity to propylene for propane dehydrogenation and decrease the deactivation rate of the catalyst."
[3] "The binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene, typically follow the same trend as HBE. As shown in Figure 10b, DFT calculations reveal that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding 3dPtPt(111) surface structures."

[9] "One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with the surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces."
