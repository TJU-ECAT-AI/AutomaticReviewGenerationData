[1] "The field of heterogeneous catalysis, specifically catalysis on bimetallic alloys, has seen many advances over the past few decades. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability."
[2] "In section 2 we will utilize one of the most thoroughly studied bimetallic systems, Ni/Pt, to introduce the preparation procedures and common characterization techniques for both bimetallic surfaces and supported catalysts."
[3] "For the LEIS experiments (Figure 3a), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was 1 ML. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K. There were corresponding increases in the Pt intensity as the annealing temperature increased."
[4] "Overall, the strong correlation between DFT prediction and experimental measurements, on both model surfaces and nanoparticles, provides conclusive evidence that the bimetallic structures change under different reaction environments. Such structural changes in turn modify the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts for different types of reactions, such as hydrogenation and oxidation reactions, as discussed in the next section."

The document discusses advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, particularly focusing on bimetallic catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts, which exhibit distinct electronic and chemical properties compared to their parent metals, offer the potential to develop catalysts with improved selectivity, activity, and stability. The Ni/Pt system is used as an example to introduce preparation methods and characterization techniques for both bimetallic surfaces and supported catalysts. In the context of surface analysis, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) experiments reveal the annealing behavior of Ni and Pt on a Pt(111) surface. The study shows that the Ni intensity decreases significantly with increasing temperature, indicating diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region, while the Pt intensity increases. This demonstrates the correlation between DFT predictions and experimental measurements, highlighting the ability of bimetallic structures to change under different reaction environments, affecting their catalytic performance for reactions like hydrogenation and oxidation.

The strong correlation between theoretical predictions and experimental outcomes, observed in both model surfaces and nanoparticles, provides evidence for the dynamic nature of bimetallic structures under reaction conditions. This, in turn, impacts the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts for various types of reactions, such as hydrogenation and oxidation, as explained in the subsequent sections.

文档讨论了异质催化领域的进展，特别是双金属催化剂。双金属催化剂显示出与它们的母金属不同的电子和化学性质，提供了开发具有更高选择性、活性和稳定性的催化剂的可能性。以Ni/Pt系统为例，介绍了双金属表面和支撑催化剂的制备方法和表征技术。在表面分析的背景下，低能离子散射（LEIS）实验揭示了Ni和Pt在Pt(111)表面上的退火行为。研究表明，随着温度升高，Ni强度显著降低，可能由于吸附剂H2的脱附，而Pt强度增加。这表明了理论预测和实验测量之间的强相关性，说明了在不同反应条件下双金属结构的变化能力，并影响其催化性能，如氢化和氧化反应。

在模型表面和纳米颗粒上观察到的这种理论预测和实验结果之间的强烈相关性，为动态性质的双金属结构提供了证据，这些结构在反应条件下发生变化。这进而影响了不同类型的反应（如氢化和氧化）中双金属催化剂的催化性能，如后续章节所解释的那样。
