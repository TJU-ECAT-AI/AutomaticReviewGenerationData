[1] "The results on model surfaces are consistent with reactor studies over supported PtFe and PtNi catalysts. PtFe/γ-Al2O3, PtFe2/γ-Al2O3, and PtFe3/γ-Al2O3 outperform Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the PROX of CO in a combined stream of CO and H2."
[2] "Siani et al. have proposed that the increased activity for CO oxidation correlates with the extent of PtFe interactions and the strength of CO adsorption."
[3] "When supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), PtCo is highly efficient for CO PROX in a H2-rich gas stream at temperatures below 423 K."
[4] "Findings by Komatsu and Tamura agree that PtCo/SiO2 catalysts are more effective for PROX than either parent metal."
[5] "Aksoylu et al. have proposed that sequential impregnation leads to higher activity because less Pt is alloyed with Sn, making more Pt sites available for CO oxidation."
[6] "Quantum calculations by Glmen et al. on PtSn surfaces show that PtSn bimetallic particles adsorb CO more weakly than Pt alone. The studies also indicate that Sn present in the subsurface configuration strengthens CO adsorption, while neighboring Sn on the surface destabilizes CO adsorption."
[7] "In comparing a series of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts over γ-Al2O3 and TiO2, catalysts containing PtRe and PtCo exhibit a higher WGS activity than Pt, but PtMo, PtSn, and PtCu show a lower WGS activity."
[8] "Additional Re increases the amount of Re on the catalyst surface and leads to an increase in the rate of WGS."
[9] "The introduction of Pt to the Au catalyst leads to the formation of a partially oxidized gold species. The presence of Au and Pt also help keep ceria in a Ce3+ state, which creates oxygen vacancies and aids in the overall activity of the catalyst."
[10] "For example, PtNi supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics."

1. Supported PtFe and PtNi catalysts show higher activity than Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the preferential oxidation of CO (PROX).
2. Increased activity for CO oxidation correlates with the strength of PtFe interactions and CO adsorption.
3. PtCo catalysts supported on YSZ are efficient for CO PROX in a hydrogen-rich stream at low temperatures.
4. PtCo/SiO2 catalysts have higher CO PROX activity than Pt and Co catalysts individually.
5. Sequential impregnation of Pt and Sn leads to higher CO oxidation activity due to less Pt alloying with Sn.
6. Quantum calculations indicate that PtSn particles adsorb CO more weakly than Pt alone, and subsurface Sn strengthens CO adsorption.
7. Catalysts containing PtRe and PtCo have higher water gas shift (WGS) activity compared to Pt, while PtMo, PtSn, and PtCu have lower WGS activity.
8. Additional Re increases the amount of Re on the catalyst surface, boosting the WGS rate.
9. The introduction of Pt and Au to ceria catalysts leads to the formation of partially oxidized species, enhancing WGS activity.
