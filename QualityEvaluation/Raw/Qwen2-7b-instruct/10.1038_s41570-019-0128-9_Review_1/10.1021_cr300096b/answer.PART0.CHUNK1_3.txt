[1] "The trend in the DFT calculations in Figure 10b also shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) are even weaker than that on PtNiPt(111)."
[2] "One would therefore expect to observe a volcano relationship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, i.e., when the adsorption of cyclohexene becomes too weak for hydrogenation to occur."
[3] "The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts supported on ZnAlO and mixed spinel Al2O3 has been shown to increase the selectivity to propylene for propane dehydrogenation and decrease the deactivation rate of the catalyst."
[4] "Over PtFe/SiO2, dehydrogenation activity is enhanced because Pt aids in the reduction of Fe as confirmed by FTIR."
[5] "The exact origin of the bimetallic enhancement can only be determined by in situ measurement of the surface termination of supported PtNi catalysts, such as by EXAFS under aqueous-phase reforming conditions."
[6] "The comparison indicates that surfaces that bind adsorbates more strongly, such as NiPtPt(111), promote reforming reactions."
[7] "The interface confinement effect and enhanced CO oxidation are also confirmed for the PtNi system by Mu et al., (273) where the reversible structures are identified as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111) surfaces."
[8] "The addition of Co to Pt/YSZ results in enhancement of catalytic performance, especially in the temperature region below 423 K."
[9] "The addition of Pt to a Au/CeO2 catalyst leads to the formation of a partially oxidized gold species. The presence of Au and Pt also help keep ceria in a Ce3+ state, which creates oxygen vacancies and aids in the overall activity of the catalyst."

1. The binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) are weaker than on PtNiPt(111), leading to a volcano relationship in hydrogenation activity.
2. As the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, the adsorption of cyclohexene becomes too weak for hydrogenation to occur, resulting in a volcano relationship.
3. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts increases the selectivity for propylene and decreases deactivation during propane dehydrogenation.
4. Pt aids in the reduction of Fe on PtFe/SiO2 catalysts, enhancing dehydrogenation activity.
5. Determining the surface termination of supported PtNi catalysts under aqueous-phase reforming conditions is crucial for understanding the bimetallic enhancement.
6. Surfaces that bind adsorbates more strongly, like NiPtPt(111), promote reforming reactions.
7. The PtNi system exhibits interface confinement effects and enhanced CO oxidation, as identified by reversible structures NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111).
8. Adding Co to Pt/YSZ catalysts enhances catalytic performance, particularly below 423 K.
9. The addition of Pt to Au/CeO2 catalysts creates a partially oxidized gold species, aiding in ceria's Ce3+ state and improving overall activity.
