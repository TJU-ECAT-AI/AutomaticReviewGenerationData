[1] "The field of heterogeneous catalysis, specifically catalysis on bimetallic alloys, has seen many advances over the past few decades. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[3] "It is now well-known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."
[4] "The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on their possible applications."
[5] "To understand the origins of the novel catalytic properties, bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research."
[6] "For this reason, the study of bimetallic surfaces in the field of catalysis has gained considerable interest."
[7] "There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface. First, the formation of heteroatom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure through the ligand effect."
[8] "Second, the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, e.g., the average metal-metal bond lengths change, resulting in the strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap."
[9] "One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with the surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces."
[10] "DFT modeling results clearly indicate that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures."
[11] "Surface science results, using several probe molecules, also confirm the different chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures."
[12] "In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results reveal a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various bimetallic structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties."
[13] "Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support."
[14] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions."
[15] "In particular, we will attempt to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment."
[16] "We will utilize successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, to demonstrate the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis."
[17] "We will also use other reactions to point out the challenges in applying fundamental surface science studies to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis."
[18] "In section 2 we will utilize one of the most thoroughly studied bimetallic systems, Ni/Pt, to introduce the preparation procedures and common characterization techniques for both bimetallic surfaces and supported catalysts."
[19] "This will be followed in section 3 by DFT calculations and experimental verification of stable bimetallic structures under different reaction conditions."
[20] "In section 4 we will summarize the unique properties and general trends of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for different types of reactions, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, reforming, and oxidation reactions."
[21] "The review will conclude by pointing out challenges and research opportunities for further advancing bimetallic catalysis."

The document discusses the advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, specifically focusing on bimetallic catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts have gained commercial interest due to their unique electronic and chemical properties that differ from their parent metals. These properties allow for enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability in catalysts. The document emphasizes the importance of understanding the origins of these novel catalytic properties through fundamental surface science research. It mentions that the electronic and chemical properties of metals in bimetallic surfaces are influenced by factors such as the formation of heteroatom bonds and the geometry of the bimetallic structure. DFT calculations and surface science experiments have revealed that the position of the surface d-band center correlates with the adsorption energy for various bimetallic structures. This correlation allows for the prediction of bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties. The document further explains that despite the insights gained from studying model bimetallic surfaces, the active metal in industrially relevant supported catalysts exists in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support. The aim of the current review is to establish correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for various catalytic reactions, bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis. The review covers the preparation procedures and common characterization techniques for bimetallic surfaces and supported catalysts, as well as DFT calculations and experimental verification of stable bimetallic structures under different reaction conditions. It also summarizes the unique properties and general trends of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for different types of reactions, highlighting challenges and opportunities for further advancing bimetallic catalysis.
