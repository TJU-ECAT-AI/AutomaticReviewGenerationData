[1] "Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."
[2] "DFT and UHV Studies on Single-Crystal 3d/Pt(111) Surfaces To facilitate the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene, one hypothesis is that an effective catalyst should bond relatively weakly to atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene."
[3] "DFT calculations were performed to estimate the values of hydrogen-binding energy (HBE) on several 3dPtPt(111) and Pt3dPt(111) surfaces."

The use of cyclohexene in hydrogenation studies is crucial because cyclic hydrocarbons are key intermediates in refinery and petrochemical processes, and they serve as building blocks for numerous chemical products. DFT calculations were conducted to determine the hydrogen-binding energy (HBE) on various 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, hypothesizing that a catalyst with weak bonding to atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene would facilitate low-temperature hydrogenation effectively.

在氢化研究中使用环己烯至关重要，因为环烷烃是许多炼油和石油化工过程中的重要中间体，并且它们作为化学产品的主要构建块。进行了DFT计算来确定各种3d/Pt(111)表面的氢结合能（HBE），假设与原子氢和环己烯结合较弱的催化剂能够在较低温度下有效促进氢化。
