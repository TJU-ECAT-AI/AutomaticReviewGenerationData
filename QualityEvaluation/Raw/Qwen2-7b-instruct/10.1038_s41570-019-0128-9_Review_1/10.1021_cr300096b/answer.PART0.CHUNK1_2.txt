[1] "The trend in the DFT calculations in Figure 10b also shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) are even weaker than that on PtNiPt(111). Although this might suggest that the former two surfaces would be more active toward hydrogenation than PtNiPt(111); one should keep in mind that the adsorption of cyclohexene needs to be strong enough for the hydrogenation to take place."
[2] "The addition of Sn to the Pt catalysts supported on ZnAlO and mixed spinel Al2O3 has been shown to increase the selectivity to propylene for propane dehydrogenation and decrease the deactivation rate of the catalyst."
[3] "The binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene, typically follow the same trend as HBE. As shown in Figure 10b, DFT calculations reveal that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding 3dPtPt(111) surface structures."
[4] "The results on model surfaces are consistent with reactor studies over supported PtFe and PtNi catalysts. PtFe/γ-Al2O3, PtFe2/γ-Al2O3, and PtFe3/γ-Al2O3 outperform Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the PROX of CO in a combined stream of CO and H2."
[5] "The Pt-terminated configuration is also consistent with results by Sedlacek et al. that the surfaces of PtNi alloys are enriched in Pt when treated with H2, as well as with findings reported by Arenas-Alatorre et al. for PtNi catalysts supported on SiO2 and by Mu et al. for PtNi catalysts supported on graphite."

1. The binding energy of cyclohexene on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) is weaker than on PtNiPt(111), suggesting these surfaces might be more active for hydrogenation. However, the adsorption strength is crucial for hydrogenation to occur.

2. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts on ZnAlO and mixed spinel Al2O3 increases the selectivity for propylene in propane dehydrogenation and reduces catalyst deactivation.

3. DFT calculations in Figure 10b show that the binding energy of cyclohexene is lower on Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures compared to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surface structures.

4. Reactor studies confirm that PtFe/γ-Al2O3, PtFe2/γ-Al2O3, and PtFe3/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are more active than Pt/γ-Al2O3 for CO oxidation in a CO-H2 mixture.

5. Results by Sedlacek et al. and Arenas-Alatorre et al. are consistent with the Pt-terminated configuration in PtNi catalysts, indicating that the surfaces are enriched in Pt after hydrogen treatment.

6. Adding Sn to Pt catalysts on ZnAlO and mixed spinel Al2O3 boosts the selectivity for propylene in propane dehydrogenation and reduces catalyst deactivation.

7. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts on ZnAlO and mixed spinel Al2O3 increases the selectivity for propylene in propane dehydrogenation and decreases catalyst deactivation.

1. 在DFT计算中，环己烯在PtCoPt(111)和PtFePt(111)上的结合能比在PtNiPt(111)上弱，这可能表明前两者在氢化反应中更活跃。然而，吸附强度对于氢化反应的发生至关重要。

2. 将Sn添加到支持在ZnAlO和混合立方氧化铝上的Pt催化剂中，可以增加丙烯在丙烷裂解中的选择性，并降低催化剂的降解速率。

3. 图10b中的DFT计算显示，环己烯在Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构上的结合能低于Pt(111)和3dPtPt(111)表面结构。

4. 反应器研究证实，PtFe/γ-Al2O3、PtFe2/γ-Al2O3和PtFe3/γ-Al2O3催化剂在CO-H2混合物中对CO氧化的活性高于Pt/γ-Al2O3。

5. Sedlacek等人和Arenas-Alatorre等人得出的结果与Pt终止配置下的PtNi催化剂相一致，表明在氢处理后表面富集了Pt。

6. 将Sn添加到支持在ZnAlO和混合立方氧化铝上的Pt催化剂中，可以提高丙烯在丙烷裂解中的选择性，并降低催化剂的降解速率。

7. 将Sn添加到支持在ZnAlO和混合立方氧化铝上的Pt催化剂中，可以提高丙烯在丙烷裂解中的选择性，并降低催化剂的降解速率。
