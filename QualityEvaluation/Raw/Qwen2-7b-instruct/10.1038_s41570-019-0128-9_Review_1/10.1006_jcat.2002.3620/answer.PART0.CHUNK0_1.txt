[1] "For a given active oxide, propane turnover rates increased in parallel with the reduction rate of the oxide catalyst using H2, but propane ODH rates differed significantly among different metal oxide samples with similar H2 reduction rates."
[2] "For samples with similar H2 reduction rates, V-based catalysts are much more active than Mo-based catalysts."
[3] "For all catalysts, ODH turnover rates increased monotonically as the energy of the absorption edge in the UV-visible spectrum decreased."

1. Propane turnover rates increased in parallel with the reduction rate of the oxide catalyst using H2, but differed significantly among metal oxide samples with similar H2 reduction rates. 

2. V-based catalysts were found to be much more active than Mo-based catalysts for samples with similar H2 reduction rates.

3. ODH turnover rates increased monotonically as the energy of the absorption edge in the UV-visible spectrum decreased across all examined samples.

1. 对于使用H2还原的氧化物催化剂，丙烷转化速率与还原速率成平行增加，但不同金属氧化物样本在相似H2还原率下表现出显著差异。

2. 对于具有相似H2还原率的样本，V基催化剂的活性远高于Mo基催化剂。

3. 在所有检查的样品中，随着紫外可见吸收边能级的降低，ODH转化速率呈单调增加。
