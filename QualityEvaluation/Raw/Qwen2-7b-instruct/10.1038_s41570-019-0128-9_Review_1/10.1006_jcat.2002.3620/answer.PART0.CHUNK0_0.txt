[1] "For a given active oxide, propane turnover rates increased in parallel with the reduction rate of the oxide catalyst using H2, but propane ODH rates differed significantly among different metal oxide samples with similar H2 reduction rates."
[2] "For samples with similar H2 reduction rates, V-based catalysts are much more active than Mo-based catalysts."
[3] "These results, taken together with the respective mechanisms for electron transfer during CH bond activation and during the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer processes responsible for the UV-visible edge, suggest that the stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of the active oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers."
[4] "Clearly, the marked differences in structural or chemical properties of VOx and MoOx domains are felt differently by H2 reduction and propane ODH reactions."

1. The study found that the rates of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and hydrogen reduction are influenced by the electronic properties of the metal oxide catalysts. Specifically, the stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of the oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers.
2. For a given metal oxide, the propane turnover rate increases with the rate of reduction of the oxide catalyst using hydrogen. However, among metal oxide samples with similar hydrogen reduction rates, vanadium-based catalysts (VOx) are more active than molybdenum-based catalysts (MoOx).
3. The stability of the activated complexes during CH bond activation is sensitive to the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge in the UV-visible spectrum of the metal oxide. This suggests that the energy required for these transitions affects the activation energy of the CH bond dissociation step.
4. The differences in structural or chemical properties between VOx and MoOx domains impact their performance in both H2 reduction and propane ODH reactions differently. This highlights that the relationship between oxide reducibility and ODH activity is nuanced and depends on the specific properties of the catalyst.

1. 研究发现，金属氧化物催化剂的电子性质影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）和氢还原的速率。具体而言，CH键断裂步骤中活性复合物的稳定性依赖于氧化物域从晶格氧原子向金属中心转移电子的能力。
2. 对于相同的金属氧化物，通过氢气的还原速率增加会导致丙烷转化速率提高。然而，在具有相似氢还原速率的金属氧化物样本中，以钒为基础的催化剂（VOx）比以钼为基础的催化剂（MoOx）更为活跃。
3. 电子跃迁负责UV可见谱边缘的能量决定了激活能量的高低，从而影响CH键断裂步骤的稳定性。这表明吸收边的能量与激活过程相关。
4. VOx和MoOx域的结构或化学性质差异导致它们在氢还原和丙烷ODH反应中的性能不同。这表明氧化物可还原性与ODH活性之间的关系复杂，并且取决于催化剂的具体性质。
