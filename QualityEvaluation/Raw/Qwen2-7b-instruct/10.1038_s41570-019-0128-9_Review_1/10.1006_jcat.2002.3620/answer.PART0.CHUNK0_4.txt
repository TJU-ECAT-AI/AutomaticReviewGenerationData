[1] "For a given active oxide, propane turnover rates increased in parallel with the reduction rate of the oxide catalyst using H2, but propane ODH rates differed significantly among different metal oxide samples with similar H2 reduction rates."
[2] "For samples with similar H2 reduction rates, V-based catalysts are much more active than Mo-based catalysts."
[3] "Irrespective of the nature of the active oxide,propane turnover rates increase monotonically as the UV visible absorption-edge energy decreases for all samples examined."

1. The document states that for a given active oxide, the rate of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) increases in parallel with the rate of reduction of the oxide catalyst using hydrogen (H2). However, the rates of propane ODH differ significantly among different metal oxide samples with similar H2 reduction rates.

2. It is mentioned that for samples with comparable H2 reduction rates, catalysts based on vanadium (V) are significantly more active than those based on molybdenum (Mo).

3. Regardless of the type of active oxide, the document indicates that propane turnover rates increase steadily as the UV-visible absorption-edge energy decreases across all examined samples.

1. 文档指出，对于特定活性氧化物，在使用氢（H2）还原催化剂时，丙烷氧化性脱氢化（ODH）速率与氧化物的还原速率成正比增加。然而，具有相似H2还原率的不同金属氧化物样本之间的ODH速率存在显著差异。

2. 文档提到，对于具有相同H2还原率的样本，基于钒（V）的催化剂比基于钼（Mo）的催化剂活性高得多。

3. 不论活性氧化物的类型如何，文档表明，所有检测到的样品中，随着可见光吸收边缘能量的降低，丙烷转化速率呈单调增加。
