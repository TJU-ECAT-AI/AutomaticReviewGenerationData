[1] "For a given active oxide, propane turnover rates increased in parallel with the reduction rate of the oxide catalyst using H2, but propane ODH rates differed significantly among different metal oxide samples with similar H2 reduction rates."
[2] "For samples with similar H2 reduction rates, V-based catalysts are much more active than Mo-based catalysts."
[3] "For all catalysts, ODH turnover rates increased monotonically as the energy of the absorption edge in the UV-visible spectrum decreased."

The document shows that for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, the rate of reaction parallels the rate of hydrogen reduction for a given active oxide. However, among different metal oxide samples with comparable hydrogen reduction rates, the ODH rates vary significantly. Specifically, vanadium (V)-based catalysts are found to be much more active than molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts under similar conditions. Moreover, the document indicates that the ODH turnover rates increase monotonically with a decrease in the UV-visible absorption edge energy of the active oxide. This suggests that the stability of activated complexes in the CH bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of the active oxide to facilitate electron transfer from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers.

文献表明，在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，对于特定活性氧化物，使用氢气的还原速率与反应速率成平行关系。然而，在具有相似氢气还原速率的不同金属氧化物样品之间，ODH速率存在显著差异。具体而言，钒（V）基催化剂在类似条件下表现出比钼（Mo）基催化剂高得多的活性。此外，文献指出，随着紫外线可见吸收边界的能量降低，ODH转速率呈现单调递增趋势。这表明，激活复合物在CH键分解步骤中的稳定性对活性氧化物促进氧原子向金属中心电子转移的能力高度敏感。
