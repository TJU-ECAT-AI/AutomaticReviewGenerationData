INTRODUCTION
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane pro- vides a low-temperature route for the synthesis of propene (114). Catalyst compositions based on V and Mo oxides have shown attractive ODH rates and propene selectivi- ties (3). Several studies have probed primary and secon- dary reactions responsible for the observed selectivity during propane ODH reactions (13, 914). The kineti- cally relevant steps for both propane dehydrogenation and combustion reactions involve the activation of methylene 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed.

CH bonds in propane (9). Detailed reaction kinetics and mechanistic studies have shown that CH bond activation steps involve lattice oxygen atoms and that each reaction turnover requires a two-electron reduction of high-valent M+n cations to form one Mn2 or two Mn1 cations (911);as a result of these cycles, the redox properties of oxides in- fluence their ability to catalyze such reaction turnovers. On VOx- and MoOx-based catalysts, the rate constants for re- oxidation of reduced centers using O2 are greater than for their re-reduction by CH bond activation steps. Several studies (13, 1421) have proposed that alkane ODH rates increase as active metal oxides become more reducible,without providing a rigorous definition of reducibility or an appropriate method to measure it. The reduction peak temperatures during reduction of oxides in H2 (1423), gen- erally used as a measure of reducibility, reflect instead the nucleation and growth of a new crystal structure during a stoichiometric reduction, and not merely the formation of a few reduced centers in a structurally intact stoichiomet- ric oxide. In addition, the mechanism of reduction using H2 may differ from the related processes using propane as the reductant, and the measured ODH reaction rates can reflect a complex interplay between site reactivity and the surface accessibility of oxide structures, which are seldom atomically dispersed.
Here, we explore the electron transfer processes required for CH bond activation steps and the factors responsible for the redox processes involved in each propane turnover.
Propane ODH turnover rates are reported on active oxi- des (VOx, MoOx, NbOx, and WOx) dispersed as isolated or two-dimensional species on the surface of inactive sup- ports. These turnover rates are related to those for the in- cipient formation of vacancies during the stoichiometric re- duction of the oxides using H2 and to the energy required for the ligand-to-metal electron transfer processes respon- sible for the edge energy in the UVvisible absorption spec- trum. A decrease in the energy required for local photore- duction events occurring during this electron transfer was accompanied by a faster CH bond activation step during 35 0021-9517/02 $35.00 c 2002 Elsevier Science (USA) All rights reserved. 36

propane ODH. Facile electron transfer between occupied orbitals in lattice oxygen and empty states in the metal cen- ters leads to more stable activated complexes in the kineti- cally relevant elementary chemical steps for propane ODH and to lower required photon energies for electron promo- tion between these two energy levels.
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Al2O3, ZrO2, or MgO were used as inactive supports for V2O5, MoO3, WO3, or Nb2O5 species predominately present as isolated or two-dimensional structures. Sam- ples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of γ -Al2O3, ZrOx(OH)42x, or MgO with a solution of am- monium vanadate (12, 13, 26), ammonium heptamolybd- ate (14), ammonium metatungstate (24, 25), or ammonium niobium oxalate (27). Impregnated samples were dried overnight in ambient air at 393 K and then treated in flow- ing dry air at 773 K for 3 h. Surface areas were measured by N2 physisorption at its normal boiling point using a Quan- tasorb surface-area analyzer (Quantachrome Corporation) and standard BET analysis methods.
The rates of stoichiometric reduction of these dispersed metal oxides using H2 were measured using a Quantasorb surface-area analyzer (Quantachrome Corporation) mod- ified with electronic mass-flow controllers. Samples were heated in 20% H2/Ar (1.33 cm3 s1; Matheson UHP, certi- fied mixture) at 0.167 K s1 to 1200 K. H2 concentrations were measured using a thermal conductivity detector after removing the water formed during reduction using a 13× molecular sieve trap held at ambient temperature. The de- tector response was calibrated using the reduction of CuO powder (Aldrich, 99.995%). The samples were held within a quartz cell (4 mm I.D.) containing a quartz thermowell in contact with the sample bed. The amount of catalyst was varied in order to maintain a constant number of metal atoms in all experiments (space velocities, 0.22 mol H2/g- atomV s1 and0.34molH2/g-atomMo s1).Theveryinitial stages of reduction (oxygen conversion, <10%) were ana- lyzed by fitting the reduction rate data using an Arrhenius dependence in order to obtain a rate constant as a function of temperature for these low extents of reduction.Diffuse reflectance UVvisible spectra were obtained us- ing a VarianCary 4 spectrophotometer equipped with a Harrick diffuse-reflectance attachment and an in situ re- action chamber. MgO (Mallinckrodt, AR) powders were used as a reference. Reflectance measurements were con- verted to absorption spectra using the KubelkaMunk func- tion (28). UVvisible spectra were measured in the 1.5- to
5.0-eV photon energy range.
Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivi- ties were measured at 703 K using a packed-bed tubular quartz reactor and 0.01- to 0.3-g catalyst samples. Propane (14 kPa; Airgas, 99.9%) and oxygen (1.7 kPa; Airgas,
99.999%) diluted with He (Airgas, 99.999%) were used
as reactants. Reactants and products were analyzed by gas chromatography (HewlettPackard 5890 GC) using pro- cedures described previously (12, 13). C3H8 and O2 con- versions were varied by changing reactant space velocities (F/w; w, catalyst mass; F, reactant volumetric flow rate).Reactant conversions were <2% for C3H8 and <20% for
O2. Initial propane turnover rates and selectivities were ob-
tained by extrapolation of these data to zero residence time using reaction rate data obtained over a wide range of space velocities. Rates and rate constants for secondary propene combustion reactions were calculated from the correspond- ing effects of bed residence time on product selectivity, us- ing procedures reported previously (12, 13).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Surface areas and MOx surface densities (M = V, Mo, W, or Nb) are shown in Table 1 for all samples. These sam- ples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and by X-ray absorption, Raman, and UVvisible spectroscopies. The details of these measurements have been reported previ- ously (1214, 2427). These methods showed that the ac- tive oxide species at these surface densities consist pre- dominately of two-dimensional oligomeric domains. These two-dimensional structures expose most MOx structures at surfaces, where they can be used for catalytic reaction turnovers. Thus, reaction rates normalized by the number of metal atoms in each sample become turnover rates, as a

result of the effective access of reactants to all MOx species.Catalysts with bulk MOx clusters (detected by Raman or X-ray diffraction) are not included in this study, but details of their catalytic and structural properties can be found in previous studies (1215, 2427).
Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of MOx surface density for VOx and MoOx species supported on Al2O3. On both types of samples, turnover rates increased with increasing MOx surface density. At a given MOx surface density, turnover rates are greater on VOx than on MoOx samples, suggesting that the redox cycles required for each ODH turnover oc- cur more rapidly on VOx domains than on MoOx domains of similar size. These differences are consistent with the higher ODH reaction temperatures reported on Mo-based compared with V-based catalysts (3).
Previous studies have suggested that the higher ODH rates observed on VOx species reflect their more reducible nature compared with that of MoOx species (1421). These studies, however, were not restricted to well-dispersed ox- ides with completely accessible active oxides; thus, reported reaction rates did not reflect the true activity of sites ex- posed at the surface of MOx domains. Also, reduction ki- netics were not rigorously measured and the reducibility was inferred solely from the temperature of one or more of the observed reduction peaks. These reduction peaks reflect the structural transformation of the starting high- valent oxides into structurally distinct suboxides, instead of merely the ease of removal of the few oxygen atoms (<5%) generally missing during steady-state ODH reactions (911).Next, we report the reduction kinetics of VOx and MoOx catalysts measured during the initial stages of reduction in H2. Figure 2 shows H2 consumption rates as a func- tion of temperature during the reduction of VOx/Al2O3 and MoOx/Al2O3. Figure 2 shows that the reduction peak maxima shift to lower temperature as the surface density of the active oxides increases in VOx and MoOx samples.This peak temperature occurs, however, at an extent of re- duction requiring significant restructuring to form distinct suboxides, as detected by evolution of X-ray diffraction and absorption features from those of MoO3 to MoO2 and ulti- mately to Mo metal as reduction proceeds. Figure 3 shows H2 consumption rates at 673 K (obtained using the method described in the experimental section) as a function of MOx surface density. H2 reduction rates are reported at 673 K because this temperature leads to low extents of reduction (510% of total V5+ or Mo6+), which resemble the antici- pateddensityofoxygenvacanciesduringsteady-stateODH reactions at the conditions of our ODH rate measurements 400 600 800 1000 Temperature (K) H2 consumption (mol H2 /g-atom Mo h-1) 1 Mo surface density (Mo/nm2)

Figure 4 shows propane ODH turnover rates and initial rates of reduction in H2 (from the data in Fig. 3) for VOx and MoOx domains supported on alumina. A parallel increase in these rates is apparent for each active oxide, but ODH turnover rates on VOx catalysts are significantly higher than on MoOx catalysts, even at similar values of the measured H2 reduction rates. This suggests that differences in struc- tural or chemical properties of VOx and MoOx domains are

Clearly, the structural and chemical re- quirementsforODHandH2 reductionprocessesareshared only to some extent. The rate of reduction in H2 may well be appropriate as a complete description of the processes required for a propane turnover for a given metal oxide, as suggested by the data in Fig. 3, but additional factors must be considered as the identity of the active oxides changes.
Yet, many studies have proposed a persistent correlation between propane reactivity and reducibility in H2 (1621),without including the subtleties described above and with- out reporting turnover rates (per exposed MOx) or initial (low conversion) reduction rates in H2. Next, we show that a more fundamental relationship appears to exist between the rate of propane turnover and the ligand-to-metal elec- tron transfer processes responsible for the near-edge region absorption features in the electronic spectra of dispersed metal oxides.
Diffuse reflectance UVvisible spectra were measured for VOx, MoOx, NbOx, and WOx domains supported on Al2O3 at varying MOx surface densities. These electronic spectra reflect the structure of valence and conduction bands in bulk solids and of the frontier atomic orbitals in oxide domains too small to be described by a continuum spectrum of energy states. In both bulk and dispersed ox- ides, the bands arising from electronic transitions in the vis- ible and UV energy range are typically broad, making their interpretation and assignment to specific structures diffi- cult. The absorption edge energy, however, can be mea- sured rigorously, and it provides an accurate description of the electronic properties of metal oxides (30), because it corresponds to incipient ligand-to-metal charge transfer processes in these materials.
Absorption edge energies were calculated using Taucs law (25, 31). The absorption edge is defined by conven- tion as the x-intercept of a linearized near-edge region for [F(R)hν]1/2 as a function of hν, where F(R) is the KubelkaMunk function [28] and hν is the energy of the in- cident photon. This form accurately describes the near-edge region for indirect band gap semiconductors and for amor- phous semiconductors, such as those consisting of small ox- ide domains, irrespective of the charge-transfer mechanism.
The absorption-edge energies estimated in this manner for all Al2O3-supported VOx and MoOx catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5 shows that absorption-edge energies de- crease with increasing VOx or MoOx surface density, sug- gesting that the energy required to promote an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in a lattice oxygen atom to the lowest unoccupied molecular or- bital (LUMO) in the metal cation decreases as the surface density and the size of the two-dimensional active oxide domains increase. These results are consistent with simi- lar trends reported earlier for dispersed MoOx and WOx ELECTRONIC/REDOX PROPERTIES VS TURNOVER RATES IN ODH 39

At a given surface density, however,absorption energies are significantly higher for MoOx than for VOx samples. Next, we examine a possible relation be- tween the ability of these materials to undergo oxygen-to- metal electronic transitions and their effectiveness in form- ing vacancies during propane ODH and during reduction with H2.

Turnover rates increase monotonically with decreasing absorption-edge energy, almost irrespective of the chem- ical identity of the active oxide. The turnover rates for propane conversion shown in Fig. 6 include both primary propane oxidative dehydrogenation and primary propane combustion reactions. On these materials, initial propene selectivities are very high (>80%); therefore, the trends de- tected in Fig. 6 for total propane conversion persist when propene formation rates are used instead (Fig. 7). As in the case of total rates, propene formation rates increase as the absorption-edge energies of the active oxide domains decrease. The observed correlation suggests that electron promotion processes responsible for the absorption edge involved in the kinetically relevant CH bond activation share some common requirements with the photoexcita- tion process responsible for the absorption edge in all oxide domains examined (VOx, MoOx, NbOx, and WOx).
A discussion of these common features requires that we examine the details of propane ODH reactions on these ac- tive oxides. Propane turnover rates on VOx and MoOx do- mains are controlled by the dissociation of the first methy- lene CH bond in propane. The transition state for this elementary step lies along a reaction coordinate in which two electrons are transferred from lattice oxygens to metal centers as an isopropoxide and a hydroxyl group form from propane (911). A plausible sequence, supported by molec- ular simulations (32) and consistent with kinetic and iso- topic tracer measurements (9, 33), is shown in Fig. 8. The 40

FIG. 8.
Simulated example of CH bond activation of propane using catalyst lattice oxygen. methylene CH bond in a propane molecule first interacts with lattice oxygen as a propane molecule adsorbs weakly on the oxide surface. The adsorbed propane reacts with a vicinal lattice oxygen atom to form an isopropoxide species and an OH group. The complete sequence of elementary steps required for an oxidative dehydrogenation turnover,confirmed previously by kinetic and isotopic tracer stud- ies (9, 11), is shown in Fig. 9, where k j denotes rate con- stants for irreversible steps and K j equilibrium constants for quasiequilibrated steps.
Two lattice oxygen atoms ultimately become involved in the CH activation step, and each one returns one electron to either a single metal center, leading to a two-electron reduction (e.g., V5+ to V3+), or to two metal centers, each of which undergoes a one-electron reduction (e.g., V+5 to V+4). These two processes require different energies, and the reaction will preferentially follow the path with the lower activation barrier. Molecular simulations (32) suggest that propane ODH reactions involve one-electron reduc- tion of two V+5 centers to V+4 using one electron from each of two lattice oxygens, a process that requires a lower activa- tion energy than a V5+- to-V3+ reduction. The need for two V atoms to accommodate the transition state and the pro- ducts in the rate-determining step may account for the low ODH turnover rates observed on small oxide domains (12, 13), such as monovanadate structures, which must undergo less favorable two-electron reduction of individ- ual V atoms during each ODH catalytic turnover.

ELECTRONIC/REDOX PROPERTIES VS TURNOVER RATES IN ODH 41 more adjacent V and Mo sites appear to be required for other catalytic oxidation reactions (34, 35), and a sharp break in catalytic behavior is reported between monomer and oligomers of metal oxides. In the present study, the changes in catalytic behavior are much more gradual (1215), because these samples do not exhibit sharp tran- sitions in structure (e.g., from monovanadate to polyvana- date) with increasing surface density of the active oxide.
The transition state for propane activation during ODH reactions contains incipiently cleaved CH and VO bonds and partially formed OC and OH bonds. (Figs. 8 and 9) Molecular simulations and the empirical correlation be- tween the rates of H2 reduction and propane ODH both suggest that the required transition states for both pro- cesses involve electron transfer from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers. The number of electrons transferred in the process of forming this activated complex must lie bet- ween zero (as in the reactants) and two (as in the pro- ducts), because this elementary step lies along a reaction coordinate in which two VO bonds are cleaved and OC and OH bonds are concurrently formed. Hammonds pos- tulate states that transition states become increasingly pro- ductlikeasanelementarystepbecomeslessthermodynami- cally favorable. Therefore, as the breaking of metaloxygen bonds becomes more difficult (e.g., as the cation changes from V to Mo to Nb), the reduced character of the cations in the transition state should increase, and the energy of for- mation of the transition state will respond more sensitively to the ability of each cation to accept electrons. In other words, as the energetics of the CH bond activation state become less favorable, the activated complex increasingly resembles the reaction products. The stability of this transi- tion state, and therefore the activation energy for CH bond activation steps, depends on the energy required to transfer the required electrons from the oxygen ligands to the metal centers in a metal oxide. This energy determines also, in the case of excitation by photons, the energy at which absorp- tion occurs in the UVvisible spectrum. As these electronic transitions require higher energies, either because of a de- crease in oxide domain size or a change in the chemical identity of the oxide, propane ODH turnover rates concur- rently decrease, as shown by the data presented in Figs. 6 and 7.
If all metal oxides shown in Figs. 6 and 7 followed the one- electron reduction path suggested for VOx, a single general correlation would be expected. This is not supported by the data in Figs. 6 and 7. For all oxides, propane conver- sion turnover rates increase monotonically with decreasing absorption-edge energy, but the data for the different ox- ides are shifted slightly relative to each other. Also, the sensitivity of the rates to the absorption energy is weaker for VOx domains than for MoOx domains. Of course, the transition state structures suggested by the scheme in Fig. 8 include not only partially cleaved metaloxygen bonds, but also the incipient formation of MOC and MOH bonds.
The extent to which this evolution of chemical bonds has progressed at the point of maximum energy along the re- action coordinate (i.e., at the transition state) will depend on the relative energies of these various bonds and on whether the process involves one- or two-electron reduc- tion of metal centers. Thus, although the edge energy is important for these materials to stabilize the required acti- vated complexes, the extent to which it influences these re- action rates varies slightly as we change the identity of the metal oxide and the consequent finer details of the electron transfer processes involved.
As a comparison, Fig. 10 shows the relationship between H2 reduction rates (in a logarithmic axis) and UVvisible absorption-edge energies for some VOx and MoOx samples supported on Al2O3 and ZrO2. A decrease in absorption- edge energy leads to an increase in H2 rates for VOx and MoOx supported on Al2O3 with varying surface density and domain sizes, but no clear general relationship emerges from the complete set of data shown in Fig. 10. These findings are in contrast to the more consistent relation found between ODH turnover rates and absorption ener- gies. Clearly, the marked differences in structural or chemi- cal properties of VOx and MoOx domains are felt differ- ently by H2 reduction and propane ODH reactions. While ODH reaction pathways are relatively well established (9 11), detailed H2 reduction mechanisms remain unclear (22) and they emphasize the nucleation and growth processes that limit stoichiometric reductions leading to changes in crystal structure and not the chemistry of the HH bond

activation and OH formation steps. In fact, one of the pos- sible H2 reduction pathways on transition metal oxides may include H2 dissociation on a few active metal centers and hydrogen spillover to vicinal reducible oxides (22, 23), ren- dering this H2 reduction process mechanistically unrelated to the redox cycles required for alkane ODH (911). Thus,the relationship between the tendency of oxides to reduce in H2 and their ability to undergo fast redox cycles during ODH reactions remains tenuous. It is clearly less appropri- ate as a predictive tool as the identity of the oxide varies than as changes in the size and structure of domains occur for a given metal oxide.
CONCLUSION
Turnover rates for propane oxidative dehydrogenation increase in parallel with an increase in the rate of H2 reduc- tion and with a decrease in the UVvisible absorption-edge energies for supported two-dimensional transition metal oxides (VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx). For a given metal oxide, propane conversion turnover rates increase as the rate of reduction in H2 increases, suggesting the involve- ment of redox cycles in propane ODH kinetically rele- vant steps. For samples with similar H2 reduction rates, V-based catalysts are much more active than Mo-based catalysts. Irrespective of the nature of the active oxide,propane turnover rates increase monotonically as the UV visible absorption-edge energy decreases for all samples examined. For each of the oxides examined (VOx, MoOx, NbOx, and WOx) lower absorption energies correspond to higher propane turnover rates. These results combined with an analysis of the catalyst electron-transfer mecha- nism suggest that CH bond dissociation proceeds via tran- sition states requiring electron transfer from oxygen atoms to metal centers. The activation energy for this step ap- pears to depend sensitively on energy required for elec- tronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge in the UVvisible spectrum. As this transition occurs at lower energies, propane ODH turnover rates increase.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
