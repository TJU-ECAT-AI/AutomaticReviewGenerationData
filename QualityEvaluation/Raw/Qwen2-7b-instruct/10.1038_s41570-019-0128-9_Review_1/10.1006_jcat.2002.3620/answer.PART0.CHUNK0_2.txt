[1] "The mechanistic connections among propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) rates, H2 reduction rates, and the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge in the electronic spectra of dispersed metal oxides were explored for VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx samples consisting predominately of two-dimensional oxide domains supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO."
[2] "For a given active oxide, propane turnover rates increased in parallel with the reduction rate of the oxide catalyst using H2, but propane ODH rates differed significantly among different metal oxide samples with similar H2 reduction rates."
[3] "These results, taken together with the respective mechanisms for electron transfer during CH bond activation and during the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer processes responsible for the UV-visible edge, suggest that the stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of the active oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers."
[4] "For samples with similar H2 reduction rates, V-based catalysts are much more active than Mo-based catalysts."
[5] "Irrespective of the nature of the active oxide, propane turnover rates increase monotonically as the UV visible absorption-edge energy decreases for all samples examined."

1. The study explores the connection between the rates of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), hydrogen reduction, and the electronic transitions affecting the absorption edge in the electronic spectra of dispersed metal oxides. The research subjects include VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx samples predominantly composed of two-dimensional oxide domains supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO.
2. Propane turnover rates were observed to rise in tandem with the H2 reduction rate for a particular active oxide. However, the ODH rates varied significantly across different metal oxide samples with comparable H2 reduction rates.
3. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation stages is shown to be sensitive to the capability of the active oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers. This is inferred from the mechanisms of electron transfer during CH bond activation and ligand-to-metal charge transfer responsible for the UV-visible edge.
4. Vanadium-based catalysts demonstrated significantly higher activity compared to molybdenum-based catalysts, regardless of similar H2 reduction rates.
5. Regardless of the type of active oxide, propane turnover rates increased steadily as the UV visible absorption-edge energy decreased across all examined samples.

1. 研究探讨了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）速率、氢气还原速率以及分散金属氧化物电子谱中吸收边缘对应电子跃迁之间的机制联系。研究对象包括在Al2O3、ZrO2和MgO上支持的VOx、MoOx、WOx和NbOx样品，这些样品主要由二维氧化物域组成。
2. 对于特定活性氧化物，通过H2进行的氧化物催化剂的转化速率与H2还原速率成正比增加，但不同金属氧化物样本的ODH速率在相似的H2还原速率下存在显著差异。
3. 研究表明，CH键断裂步骤中激活复合物的稳定性对活性氧化物域从晶格氧原子向金属中心转移电子的能力极为敏感。这一结论基于CH键活化过程和负责UV可见边沿的配体到金属电荷转移过程的机制。
4. 无论还原率相似，钒基催化剂的活性远高于钼基催化剂。
5. 不论活性氧化物的类型如何，所有检查样本的丙烷转化速率随UV可见吸收边缘能量的降低而呈单调递增趋势。
