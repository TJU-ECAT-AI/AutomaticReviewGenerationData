1. Cu-based catalysts in CO2 synthesis from MeOH are sensitive to structure. Larger particles with less interaction between metal and support are more beneficial for CO2 hydrogenation to alcohols, as demonstrated in studies with Fe-Cu/MCM-41.
   
2. Charge redistribution over metal particles plays a role in low-pressure CH3OH synthesis. Adding CeOx to Au/CeOx/TiO2 catalysts increases both CO2 conversion and CH3OH selectivity. This is attributed to enhanced CO2 adsorption strength due to the negatively charged Au and Ce3+ sites.

3. The necessity exists for researchers to utilize DFT to identify descriptors correlating with MeOH yield. The BEEF-vdW101 functional maps all relevant energy kinetics of MeOH synthesis using the oxygen adsorption energy (ΔEO).

4. A volcano relationship emerges when plotting TOF of CO2 hydrogenation versus ΔEO, with peaks at Cu/ZnO and Ni-Ga. These materials exhibit an optimal interaction with oxygen, stabilizing intermediates without poisoning the surface.

1. Cu基催化剂在CO2从MeOH合成中对结构敏感。研究表明，更大的颗粒和金属与支撑之间较弱的相互作用对于CO2氢化到醇更为有利，这是通过Fe-Cu/MCM-41的研究得出的结论。
   
2. 在低压力CH3OH合成中，金属粒子的电荷重分布起着关键作用。向Au/CeOx/TiO2催化剂中添加CeOx增加了CO2转化率和CH3OH选择性。这归因于由于负电荷的Au和Ce3+位点增强了CO2吸附强度，导致更高的CH3OH产率。

3. 对于MeOH合成，有必要让研究人员利用DFT来识别与MeOH产量相关的描述符。使用BEEF-vdW101功能可以将所有相关能量动力学映射为MeOH合成使用氧吸附能（ΔEO）。

4. 当根据TOF的CO2氢化速率与ΔEO进行绘制时，出现火山关系，Cu/ZnO和Ni-Ga位于峰值。这些材料与氧的相互作用最佳，稳定中间体而不会毒化表面。
