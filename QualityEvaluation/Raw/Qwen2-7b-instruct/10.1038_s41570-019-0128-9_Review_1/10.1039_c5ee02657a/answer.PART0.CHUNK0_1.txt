<p>Currently, 95% of H2 is produced from hydrocarbon based feedstocks (steam reforming of CH4, coal gasification and partial oxidation of light oil residues), with CO2 as a byproduct.</p>
<p>A large-scale reduction of CO2 requires sources of relatively inexpensive, renewable and CO2-free H2.</p>
<p>Significant efforts must be put forth to both identify new catalysts and reduce the cost of CO2-free H2 to make CO2 reduction by H2 scientifically and economically viable.</p>

1. The majority of hydrogen is generated using hydrocarbon feedstocks, which results in CO2 emissions. Large-scale CO2 reduction necessitates the discovery of affordable, renewable, and CO2-free hydrogen sources. Efforts should focus on identifying new catalysts and lowering the cost of CO2-free hydrogen to make CO2 reduction by hydrogen economically and scientifically viable.

2. The literature does not provide a direct comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. However, it discusses the importance of support materials, composition, and structural factors in determining the performance of CO2 reduction catalysts. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts specifically, the text highlights the role of CeO2 as a reducible support that can improve activity through oxygen exchange with CO2. It also mentions the potential for metal modifications to attenuate the Mo2C binding energy of intermediates in CO2 reduction, which could be applied to FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts as well.

2. 文献没有直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和氧化钒催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能。但是，它讨论了支撑材料、组成和结构因素在确定CO2还原催化剂性能中的重要性。对于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂而言，文献强调了CeO2作为可还原支撑体通过与CO2的氧交换来提高活性的作用。它还提到了对Mo2C中间体结合能进行金属修饰的可能性，这也可以应用于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂。
