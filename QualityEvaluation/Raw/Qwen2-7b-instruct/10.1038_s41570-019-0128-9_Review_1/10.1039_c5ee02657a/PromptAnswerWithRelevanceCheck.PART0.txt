[1] "Out of several metals supported on Cu(111), Ni/Cu(111) exhibits the lowest barrier for H2COO hydrogenation with an intermediate CO binding energy, leading to the highest MeOH production out of Pt, Rh, Pd, Cu and Au supported on Cu(111)."
[2] "Some of the current challenges in electrocatalysis include the relatively low Faradic efficiency for CO2 conversion due to the high activity of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study indicates that Ni/Cu(111) shows the lowest barrier for H2COO hydrogenation, featuring the lowest intermediate CO binding energy among Pt, Rh, Pd, Cu, and Au supported on Cu(111). This results in the highest MeOH production. Moreover, the challenges in electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction involve low Faradic efficiency due to the high activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
研究表明，Ni/Cu(111)在H2COO氢化过程中的最低壁垒显示出了最低的中间态CO结合能，与Pt、Rh、Pd、Cu和Au在Cu(111)上的支持相比。这导致了最高的甲醇产量。此外，电催化过程中CO2转化的挑战包括由于氢演化反应（HER）的高活性导致的法拉第效率低。

<p>Currently, 95% of H2 is produced from hydrocarbon based feedstocks (steam reforming of CH4, coal gasification and partial oxidation of light oil residues), with CO2 as a byproduct.</p>
<p>A large-scale reduction of CO2 requires sources of relatively inexpensive, renewable and CO2-free H2.</p>
<p>Significant efforts must be put forth to both identify new catalysts and reduce the cost of CO2-free H2 to make CO2 reduction by H2 scientifically and economically viable.</p>

1. The majority of hydrogen is generated using hydrocarbon feedstocks, which results in CO2 emissions. Large-scale CO2 reduction necessitates the discovery of affordable, renewable, and CO2-free hydrogen sources. Efforts should focus on identifying new catalysts and lowering the cost of CO2-free hydrogen to make CO2 reduction by hydrogen economically and scientifically viable.

2. The literature does not provide a direct comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. However, it discusses the importance of support materials, composition, and structural factors in determining the performance of CO2 reduction catalysts. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts specifically, the text highlights the role of CeO2 as a reducible support that can improve activity through oxygen exchange with CO2. It also mentions the potential for metal modifications to attenuate the Mo2C binding energy of intermediates in CO2 reduction, which could be applied to FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts as well.

2. 文献没有直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和氧化钒催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能。但是，它讨论了支撑材料、组成和结构因素在确定CO2还原催化剂性能中的重要性。对于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂而言，文献强调了CeO2作为可还原支撑体通过与CO2的氧交换来提高活性的作用。它还提到了对Mo2C中间体结合能进行金属修饰的可能性，这也可以应用于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂。

<p>Similar to the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, Cu-based materials are popular choices for MeOH synthesis from CO2;49- 51 however, activity over Cu-based catalysts is structure sensitive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a study over Fe-Cu/MCM-41 demonstrates that larger particles with less metal-support interaction are more favorable for CO2 hydrogenation to alcohols.58</p>
<p>A recent study of low-pressure CH3OH synthesis over Au/CeOx/TiO2 model catalysts also indicate that charge redistribution over metal particles may play a role.100</p>
<p>The addition of CeOx over Au/CeOx/TiO2 leads to increases in both CO2 conversion and CH3OH selectivity.  AP-XPS measurements reveal that Au is partially negatively charged and CeOx is in the Ce3+ state.  The presence of adjacent negatively charged Au and Ce3+ sites enhances the adsorption strength of CO2, leading to the higher CH3OH yield.</p>

1. Cu-based catalysts in CO2 synthesis from MeOH are sensitive to structure. Larger particles with less interaction between metal and support are more beneficial for CO2 hydrogenation to alcohols, as demonstrated in studies with Fe-Cu/MCM-41.
   
2. Charge redistribution over metal particles plays a role in low-pressure CH3OH synthesis. Adding CeOx to Au/CeOx/TiO2 catalysts increases both CO2 conversion and CH3OH selectivity. This is attributed to enhanced CO2 adsorption strength due to the negatively charged Au and Ce3+ sites.

3. The necessity exists for researchers to utilize DFT to identify descriptors correlating with MeOH yield. The BEEF-vdW101 functional maps all relevant energy kinetics of MeOH synthesis using the oxygen adsorption energy (ΔEO).

4. A volcano relationship emerges when plotting TOF of CO2 hydrogenation versus ΔEO, with peaks at Cu/ZnO and Ni-Ga. These materials exhibit an optimal interaction with oxygen, stabilizing intermediates without poisoning the surface.

1. Cu基催化剂在CO2从MeOH合成中对结构敏感。研究表明，更大的颗粒和金属与支撑之间较弱的相互作用对于CO2氢化到醇更为有利，这是通过Fe-Cu/MCM-41的研究得出的结论。
   
2. 在低压力CH3OH合成中，金属粒子的电荷重分布起着关键作用。向Au/CeOx/TiO2催化剂中添加CeOx增加了CO2转化率和CH3OH选择性。这归因于由于负电荷的Au和Ce3+位点增强了CO2吸附强度，导致更高的CH3OH产率。

3. 对于MeOH合成，有必要让研究人员利用DFT来识别与MeOH产量相关的描述符。使用BEEF-vdW101功能可以将所有相关能量动力学映射为MeOH合成使用氧吸附能（ΔEO）。

4. 当根据TOF的CO2氢化速率与ΔEO进行绘制时，出现火山关系，Cu/ZnO和Ni-Ga位于峰值。这些材料与氧的相互作用最佳，稳定中间体而不会毒化表面。
