[1] "Out of several metals supported on Cu(111), Ni/Cu(111) exhibits the lowest barrier for H2COO hydrogenation with an intermediate CO binding energy, leading to the highest MeOH production out of Pt, Rh, Pd, Cu and Au supported on Cu(111)."
[2] "Some of the current challenges in electrocatalysis include the relatively low Faradic efficiency for CO2 conversion due to the high activity of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)."

The study indicates that Ni/Cu(111) shows the lowest barrier for H2COO hydrogenation, featuring the lowest intermediate CO binding energy among Pt, Rh, Pd, Cu, and Au supported on Cu(111). This results in the highest MeOH production. Moreover, the challenges in electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction involve low Faradic efficiency due to the high activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

研究表明，Ni/Cu(111)在H2COO氢化过程中的最低壁垒显示出了最低的中间态CO结合能，与Pt、Rh、Pd、Cu和Au在Cu(111)上的支持相比。这导致了最高的甲醇产量。此外，电催化过程中CO2转化的挑战包括由于氢演化反应（HER）的高活性导致的法拉第效率低。
