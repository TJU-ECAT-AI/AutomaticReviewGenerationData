1. Bimetallic CrV impregnated catalysts were tested for oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane using CO2 as oxidant. The catalysts were characterized by their reducibility and acid-base functionality.

2. The 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 catalyst produced 1,3-butadiene as the major product (6.6 wt%), with smaller quantities of trans 2-butene, 1-butene, cis 2-butene, and isobutene.

3. The 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 catalyst showed the highest CO2 conversion (2.35-2.2%) at 550°C.

4. The CO2 activation capability of the catalysts improved at higher temperatures.

5. The apparent activation energies for dehydrogenation across the catalysts ranged from 67 to 72 kJ/mol.

6. The variation in activation energies for cracking (80-157 kJ/mol) indicated different cracking mechanisms among the catalysts.
