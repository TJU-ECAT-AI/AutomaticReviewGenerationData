The document discusses the characterization and evaluation of bimetallic CrV catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane using CO2 as an oxidant. Key points include:

1. The reducibility and acid/base functionality of the catalysts play crucial roles in their activity and selectivity for producing butenes.
2. Different reduction peaks in TPR profiles indicate varying degrees of reducibility among the catalysts, affecting their activity.
3. Acid/base properties, as assessed by ammonia and CO2 thermogravimetric analyses, influence the catalysts' ability to activate CO2.
4. The presence of distinct peaks in the Raman spectra indicates the dispersion of metal oxides over the supports.
5. The selectivity towards butenes is higher for catalysts like 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41, which exhibits high dehydrogenation activity and mild adsorption of olefins.
6. The olefin/paraffin ratio varies with temperature, reflecting the balance between dehydrogenation and cracking reactions.
7. The amount of coke formation differs among the catalysts, with 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 exhibiting the highest coke content.
8. The apparent activation energies for dehydrogenation and cracking reactions vary among the catalysts, impacting their performance.
9. The ratio of conversion to coke weight percentage provides insights into the catalysts' stability and efficiency.
