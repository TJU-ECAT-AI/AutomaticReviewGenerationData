[1] "The activity of bimetallic CrV impregnated mesoporous and microporous catalysts are tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane using CO2 as oxidant."
[2] "Overall, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 maintained high catalytic activity, where conversion of n-butane increased from 4.7 % at 525 C to the maximum of 14 % at 600 C."
[3] "The high activity of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 depends on the reducibility and acid to base functionality for the production of butenes."
[4] "With respect to CO2 activation, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 shows highest CO2 conversion in the range 2.352.2 % at 550 C."
[5] "However, its CO2 activation improves at higher temperatures."
[6] "The apparent activation energies of dehydrogenation reaction over the four catalysts remain similar ranging from 67 to 72 kJ mol1."
[7] "The ratio of conversion to coke weight per cent over the four catalysts at same reaction condition are in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22."

This study evaluates the activity of bimetallic CrV catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane with CO2 as an oxidant. The catalyst 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 exhibits high activity, converting n-butane to butenes effectively. Its activity increases with temperature, reaching a maximum of 14% at 600°C. The high activity is attributed to the reducibility and acid-base functionality of the catalyst. Another catalyst, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22, shows high CO2 conversion at 550°C, and this improves at higher temperatures. The apparent activation energies for dehydrogenation across the four catalysts are similar, ranging from 67 to 72 kJ/mol. The ratio of conversion to coke formation varies among the catalysts, with 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 showing the highest conversion to coke.
