The catalyst 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 exhibits high activity, converting n-butane to butenes effectively. Its activity increases with temperature, reaching a maximum of 14% at 600°C. The high activity is attributed to the reducibility and acid-base functionality of the catalyst. Another catalyst, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22, shows high CO2 conversion at 550°C, and this improves at higher temperatures.
