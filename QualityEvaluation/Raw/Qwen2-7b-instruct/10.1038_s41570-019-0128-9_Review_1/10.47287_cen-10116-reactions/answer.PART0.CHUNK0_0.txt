[1] "As a defense lawyer in Toronto, I read with interest Portable Spectrometers Give On-Site Testing a Boost, by Carolyn Wilke (C&EN, April 17/24, 2023, page 28)."
[2] "These new, often handheld, devices may well be better than the more traditional color tests or wet-chemistry kits."
[3] "But the article doesn't go into detail about the important distinction between these valuable law enforcement investigative tools and eventual proof in court to convince a judge for the criminal law requirement of beyond a reasonable doubt."
[4] "And it would appear that neither these new devices nor the color tests measure quantity, which may be important for eventual court determination of guilt and sentencing."
[5] "In Canadian law, there is another, more problematic concern, for which these new devices would not help."
[6] "It is apparent government policy and practice to not reveal the science behind drug determinations."
[7] "There is no proper scientific report."
[8] "Perhaps of greatest concern is that hardly any of the personnel of the Canadian legal system would seem to be concerned with these problems of science policy and justice."
[9] "Or concerned that the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act s. 51 remains as law."
[10] "Perhaps the coming availability of the new devices would falsely allay that there are serious problems of scientific and legal principle."

The document does not provide specific comparisons between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. It also does not delve into the roles of support materials, composition, and structural factors in determining their performance. Instead, it discusses concerns regarding the use of portable spectrometers in court cases and issues related to the Canadian legal system's handling of drug determinations and science policy. The document suggests that the lack of proper scientific reporting and the absence of concern over the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act s. 51 remain as law could lead to misunderstandings about the effectiveness and limitations of these new devices in forensic science and legal proceedings.

文档没有提供FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2与二氧化钒催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的具体比较，包括活性、选择性和反应机制。它也没有深入探讨支撑材料、组成和结构因素在决定其性能中的作用。相反，它讨论了在法庭案件中使用便携式光谱仪的问题以及加拿大法律体系处理毒品确定和科学政策问题的担忧。文档指出，缺乏适当的科学报告和对《管制药物和物质法》第51条仍为法律的担忧可能会导致对这些新设备在法医科学和司法程序中的有效性和限制的误解。
