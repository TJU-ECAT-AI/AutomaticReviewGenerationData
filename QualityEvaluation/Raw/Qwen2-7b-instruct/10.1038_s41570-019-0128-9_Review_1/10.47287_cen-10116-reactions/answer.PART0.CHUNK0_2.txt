As a defense lawyer in Toronto, I read with interest Portable Spectrometers Give On-Site Testing a Boost, by Carolyn Wilke (C&EN, April 17/24, 2023, page 28).
And it would appear that neither these new devices nor the color tests measure quantity, which may be important for eventual court determination of guilt and sentencing.
In Canadian law, there is another, more problematic concern, for which these new devices would not help. It is apparent government policy and practice to not reveal the science behind drug determinations.
Perhaps of greatest concern is that hardly any of the personnel of the Canadian legal system would seem to be concerned with these problems of science policy and justice.
