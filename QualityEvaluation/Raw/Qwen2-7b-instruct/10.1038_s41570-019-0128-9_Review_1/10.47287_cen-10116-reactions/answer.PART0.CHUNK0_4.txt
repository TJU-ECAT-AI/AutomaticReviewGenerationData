[1] "These new, often handheld, devices may well be better than the more traditional color tests or wet-chemistry kits."
[2] "But the article doesn't go into detail about the important distinction between these valuable law enforcement investigative tools and eventual proof in court to convince a judge for the criminal law requirement of beyond a reasonable doubt."
[3] "And it would appear that neither these new devices nor the color tests measure quantity, which may be important for eventual court determination of guilt and sentencing."
[4] "For years, qualitative disclosure has effectively been prevented with Controlled Drugs and Substances Act s. 51. More recently, disclosure of the science behind quantitative measurements has simply been declined by Crown counsel."

The portable spectrometers mentioned in the article are described as potentially superior to traditional color tests or wet-chemistry kits. However, the article does not elaborate on the crucial difference between these devices used by law enforcement and the necessity of providing evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in court. Furthermore, these new devices and color tests do not measure quantity, which could be vital for determining guilt and sentencing in court. Moreover, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act section 51 has prevented the disclosure of the science behind drug determinations, and Crown counsel have declined to reveal the science behind quantitative measurements.

文章提到的手持式光谱仪在性能上可能优于传统的颜色测试或湿化学试剂。然而，文章并未详细说明这些用于执法的设备与法庭需要证明罪行确凿无疑之间的关键区别。此外，这些新设备和颜色测试都无法测量数量，这可能对定罪和量刑的判决至关重要。更重要的是，《管制药物和物质法》第51条阻止了对毒品确定科学的披露，总检控官拒绝透露量化测量背后的科学原理。
