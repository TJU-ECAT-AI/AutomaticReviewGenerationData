[3] "The ethene yield increased with Ga loading up to about 10 wt %. The molar CO2/C2H6 ratio in the feed, reaction temperature, and space velocity were decisive parameters for achieving maximum ethene yield."

Answer: How does the Ga content affect the structural properties and catalytic behavior of flame-synthesized TiO2-supported gallium oxide in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane?

The Ga content influences the structural properties and catalytic behavior of flame-synthesized TiO2-supported gallium oxide in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Specifically, the gallium oxide powders consist of nonporous spherical particles with an average diameter of about 10 nm. The specific surface area of these powders is around 120 m2/g. The ethene yield increases with the Ga loading up to approximately 10 wt%. Factors such as the molar CO2/C2H6 ratio in the feed, reaction temperature, and space velocity play crucial roles in achieving the maximum ethene yield. Furthermore, the catalysts can be efficiently regenerated by exposing them to air at 700°C for 10 minutes, which provides a foundation for developing a dynamic process involving alternative oxidative dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles.

如何影响火焰合成的二氧化钛负载镓氧化物在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的结构特性和催化行为？

镓含量对火焰合成的二氧化钛负载镓氧化物在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的结构特性和催化行为产生影响。具体来说，镓氧化物粉末由直径约为10nm的非孔性球形颗粒组成，这通过高分辨透射电子显微镜和X射线衍射线宽化得到证实，其比表面积约为120m2/g。随着镓含量的增加，乙炔产率也会上升，直到大约10wt%。反应气体中二氧化碳与乙烷的摩尔比、反应温度和空速等因素是实现最大乙炔产率的关键参数。此外，通过将催化剂暴露于700°C的空气中10分钟，可以有效地再生它们，为开发包含交替氧化脱氢/再生周期的动态过程提供了基础。

[1] "The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts."
[2] "Ethane conversion increased almost linearly with increasing reaction temperature, similar to the findings of Nakagawa et al., (8) while CO2 conversion showed a maximum around 700 C."
[3] "High selectivity at high temperatures (800 C) arises from the unavailability of active surface sites for further oxidation of ethene due to enhanced coking."
[4] "Severe coking on the catalyst surface is the major reason for its deactivation, requiring further investigation."
[5] "Carbon deposition on the catalyst increased almost linearly, reaching a saturation level after 60 min on stream, while ethane conversion decreased steadily until 120 min on stream."
[6] "The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles."

2. Ethane conversion increased linearly with the reaction temperature, mirroring findings from Nakagawa et al. (8), while CO2 conversion peaked around 700°C.
3. High selectivity at high temperatures (800°C) was attributed to the scarcity of active sites available for ethene oxidation due to enhanced coking.
