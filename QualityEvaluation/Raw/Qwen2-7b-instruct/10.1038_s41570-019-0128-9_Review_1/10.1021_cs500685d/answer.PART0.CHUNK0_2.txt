[1] "The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts."
[2] "Ethane conversion and ethene selectivity showed a clear interdependence, higher ethane conversion resulting in lower ethene selectivity."
[3] "These materials show remarkable catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (OHDE) with CO2 as oxidant."
[4] "Ethane conversion and ethene selectivity showed a clear interdependence, higher ethane conversion resulting in lower ethene selectivity."
[5] "The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles."

The document discusses the influence of gallium (Ga) loading and reaction conditions on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration of flame-made Ga-loaded TiO2 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) using CO2 as an oxidant. The ethane conversion and ethene selectivity show a clear interdependence, with higher ethane conversion leading to lower ethene selectivity. The catalysts demonstrate remarkable activity in ODHE, and the ease and efficiency of regeneration offer a foundation for developing dynamic processes combining reaction and regeneration cycles.

文档讨论了在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的乙烷氧化脱氢（ODHE）过程中，镓（Ga）负载和反应条件对火焰合成的Ga负载TiO2催化剂性能、失活和再生的影响。乙烷转化率与乙烯选择性之间存在明显的相关性，较高的乙烷转化率导致较低的乙烯选择性。催化剂表现出显著的活性，在ODHE中，并且再生过程的简便性和效率为开发结合反应和再生周期的动态过程提供了基础。
