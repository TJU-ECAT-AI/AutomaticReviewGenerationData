Answer: How does the Ga content affect the structural properties and catalytic behavior of flame-synthesized TiO2-supported gallium oxide in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane?

The Ga content influences the structural properties and catalytic behavior of flame-synthesized TiO2-supported gallium oxide in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Specifically, the gallium oxide powders consist of nonporous spherical particles with an average diameter of about 10 nm. The specific surface area of these powders is around 120 m2/g. The ethene yield increases with the Ga loading up to approximately 10 wt%. Factors such as the molar CO2/C2H6 ratio in the feed, reaction temperature, and space velocity play crucial roles in achieving the maximum ethene yield. Furthermore, the catalysts can be efficiently regenerated by exposing them to air at 700°C for 10 minutes, which provides a foundation for developing a dynamic process involving alternative oxidative dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles.

如何影响火焰合成的二氧化钛负载镓氧化物在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的结构特性和催化行为？

镓含量对火焰合成的二氧化钛负载镓氧化物在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的结构特性和催化行为产生影响。具体来说，镓氧化物粉末由直径约为10nm的非孔性球形颗粒组成，这通过高分辨透射电子显微镜和X射线衍射线宽化得到证实，其比表面积约为120m2/g。随着镓含量的增加，乙炔产率也会上升，直到大约10wt%。反应气体中二氧化碳与乙烷的摩尔比、反应温度和空速等因素是实现最大乙炔产率的关键参数。此外，通过将催化剂暴露于700°C的空气中10分钟，可以有效地再生它们，为开发包含交替氧化脱氢/再生周期的动态过程提供了基础。
