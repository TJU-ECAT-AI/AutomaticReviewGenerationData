[1] "The main focus was the influence of the Ga loading and reaction conditions (CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, space velocity) on the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of these catalysts."
[2] "Ethane conversion increased almost linearly with increasing reaction temperature, similar to the findings of Nakagawa et al., (8) while CO2 conversion showed a maximum around 700 C."
[3] "High selectivity at high temperatures (800 C) arises from the unavailability of active surface sites for further oxidation of ethene due to enhanced coking."
[4] "Severe coking on the catalyst surface is the major reason for its deactivation, requiring further investigation."
[5] "Carbon deposition on the catalyst increased almost linearly, reaching a saturation level after 60 min on stream, while ethane conversion decreased steadily until 120 min on stream."
[6] "The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles."

1. The study focused on how the gallium (Ga) loading and reaction conditions, including the CO2/C2H6 feed ratio, temperature, and space velocity, affected the performance, deactivation, and regeneration behavior of the catalysts.
2. Ethane conversion increased linearly with the reaction temperature, mirroring findings from Nakagawa et al. (8), while CO2 conversion peaked around 700°C.
3. High selectivity at high temperatures (800°C) was attributed to the scarcity of active sites available for ethene oxidation due to enhanced coking.
4. Severe carbon deposition on the catalyst surface was identified as the primary cause for catalyst deactivation, necessitating further investigation.
5. Carbon deposition increased linearly, reaching a plateau after 60 minutes, while ethane conversion decreased gradually until 120 minutes on stream.
6. The simplicity and effectiveness of catalyst regeneration provided a foundation for developing a dynamic process involving alternating reaction/regeneration cycles.

1. 研究主要关注了镓（Ga）负载和反应条件，包括二氧化碳/乙烷混合物的进料比、温度和空速，对催化剂性能、失活和再生行为的影响。
2. 随着反应温度的增加，乙烷转化率呈线性增长，与Nakagawa等人的发现相似（8），而二氧化碳转化率在700°C左右达到最大值。
3. 在高温（800°C）时的高选择性归因于活性位点的稀缺，由于焦炭沉积导致了进一步的乙烯氧化。
4. 催化剂表面严重的碳沉积被确定为催化剂失活的主要原因，需要进一步研究。
5. 碳沉积在60分钟内呈线性增加，直到达到饱和，而乙烷转化率则逐渐下降到120分钟。
6. 催化剂再生的简便性和效率为开发一种交替反应/再生周期的动态过程提供了基础。
