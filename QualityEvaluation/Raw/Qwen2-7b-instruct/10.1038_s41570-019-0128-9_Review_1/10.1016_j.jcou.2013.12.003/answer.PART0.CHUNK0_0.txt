The document highlights the evaluation of the catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane (nB) to C4 olefins under normal atmospheric pressure, utilizing CO2 as the soft oxidant. It emphasizes the importance of synergistic effects in mixed oxide materials in enhancing catalytic activity. CO2 is shown to have a promoting effect on the ODH process. The specific oxide used as the support significantly influences the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The study exploits the oxidizing ability of vanadium oxide by supporting it on redox-featured CeO2ZrO2 and TiO2ZrO2 mixed oxides. The redox property of the catalyst plays a crucial role in influencing the catalytic activity for the nB ODH with CO2.
