[1] "In our previous study, ODH of nB with CO2 as the soft oxidant was investigated over VOx/SnO2ZrO2 catalyst and found that the presence of vanadium oxide and the involvement of CO2 significantly increase the activity."
[2] "Interestingly, the rate of decrease in the conversion and selectivity in the case of CZ support was almost similar to VCZ sample and lower in comparison to VTZ sample."
[3] "However, further studies are needed to confirm the activity of VCeO4 and ZrV2O7 oxides."
[4] "These results clearly reveal that support plays a critical role for the observed high and stable activity. This is mainly due to the facile oxygen transport from the bulk of cerium oxide solid solution that helps in the prevention of coke formation, which is the main deactivation pathway of these catalysts."

1. In a previous study, the use of vanadium oxide in conjunction with CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane (nB) led to an increase in activity. 
2. The rate of decrease in conversion and selectivity over the CZ support was similar to VCZ but lower than VTZ.
3. There is a need for further research to confirm the activity of VCeO4 and ZrV2O7 oxides.
4. The high and stable activity observed can be attributed to the ease of oxygen transport from the bulk of the cerium oxide solid solution, which prevents coke formation, a primary pathway for catalyst deactivation.

1. 在先前的研究中，使用范德华氧化物与CO2在n-B的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中增加了活性。
2. CZ支持的转化率和选择性下降速率与VCZ相似，但低于VTZ。
3. 需要进一步研究来确认VCeO4和ZrV2O7氧化物的活性。
4. 观察到的高和稳定活性主要归因于从铈氧化物固溶体本体的氧气传输的便利性，这有助于防止焦炭形成，这是这些催化剂失活的主要途径。
