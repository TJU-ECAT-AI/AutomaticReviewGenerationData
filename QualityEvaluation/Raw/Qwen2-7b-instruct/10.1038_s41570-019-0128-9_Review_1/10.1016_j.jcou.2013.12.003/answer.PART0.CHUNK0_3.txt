[1] "The presence of vanadium oxide is very important to increase the activity and the support plays a vital role for stable catalytic activity."
[2] "The redox property of the catalyst significantly influenced the catalytic activity for nB ODH with CO2."
[3] "The catalytic performance was evaluated for the ODH of nB to C4 olefins in the vapor phase under normal atmospheric pressure employing CO2 as the soft oxidant."
[4] "The ODH of nB was also carried out over CZ and TZ supports at 600 °C and GHSV of 600 mL h−1 g−1 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6, the nB conversion and total C4 olefins selectivity over CZ support is 7.4% and 20.9%, respectively at 15 min. But the support TZ showed a poor activity (<3% conversion) at 15 min."
[5] "Interestingly, the rate of decrease in the conversion and selectivity in the case of CZ support was almost similar to VCZ sample and lower in comparison to VTZ sample."
[6] "These results clearly reveal that support plays a critical role for the observed high and stable activity. This is mainly due to the facile oxygen transport from the bulk of cerium oxide solid solution that helps in the prevention of coke formation, which is the main deactivation pathway of these catalysts."

The literature discusses the importance of vanadium oxide in enhancing catalytic activity for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane (nB) with carbon dioxide (CO2). The redox property of the catalyst significantly influences its activity in this reaction. Different mixed metal oxide supports, specifically CeO2ZrO2 (CZ) and TiO2ZrO2 (TZ), were synthesized and used in the ODH process. The CZ support facilitates easier reduction of vanadium oxide compared to its bulk form, and the CZ-supported vanadium oxide catalysts exhibit higher activity and stability compared to the TZ-supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The CZ support, with its high oxygen transport capabilities, prevents coke formation, contributing to its high and stable catalytic activity. The literature does not directly compare FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts to vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions, nor does it provide detailed information on the roles of support materials, composition, and structural factors in determining the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts. It focuses on the CZ and TZ mixed metal oxide supports and their impact on vanadium oxide catalyst performance.

文献讨论了在二氧化碳（CO2）氧化脱氢（ODH）中，五氧化二钒对催化剂活性的增强作用。催化剂的还原性质显著影响其在该反应中的活性。使用了两种不同的混合金属氧化物支持物，分别为CeO2ZrO2（CZ）和TiO2ZrO2（TZ），进行ODH过程。CZ支持物能够更容易地使五氧化二钒还原，与纯物质相比。CZ支持的五氧化二钒催化剂表现出比TZ支持的五氧化二钒催化剂更高的活性和稳定性。CZ支持物，由于其高氧传输能力，防止了焦炭形成，从而为其提供了高且稳定的催化活性。文献没有直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂与五氧化二钒催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能，也没有提供关于支持材料、组成和结构因素在决定FexNiy/CeO2催化剂性能方面的作用的详细信息。它主要关注CZ和TZ混合金属氧化物支持物及其对五氧化二钒催化剂性能的影响。
