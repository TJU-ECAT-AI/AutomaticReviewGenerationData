The redox property of the catalyst plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane with CO2. CO2 promotes the activity of the catalyst, enhancing the selectivity and yield of C4 dehydrogenation products. In previous studies, the presence of vanadium oxide and CO2 significantly increased the activity of catalysts used in the ODH of n-butane. The Ce4+/Ce3+ redox chemistry and oxygen mobility of the CeO2ZrO2 (CZ) support facilitate the redox cycle, contributing to the high activity. Key catalytic sites, such as VOV or V OCe bridging oxygen, are essential for the ODH of propane over ceria-supported vanadia catalysts, demonstrating the importance of these active centers in the reaction mechanism.

催化剂的氧化还原性质在n-丁烷与CO2的氧化脱氢反应中起着关键作用。CO2促进了催化剂的活性，提高了C4脱氢产物的选择性和产率。在之前的实验中，范德华氧化物和CO2显著增加了用于n-丁烷脱氢的催化剂的活性。CeO2ZrO2（CZ）支持的Ce4+/Ce3+氧化还原化学和氧动力学有助于红ox循环，从而促进高活性。关键催化位点，如VOV或V OCe桥接氧，在使用铈氧化物支持的钒化催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢时至关重要，这表明这些活性中心在反应机制中的重要性。
