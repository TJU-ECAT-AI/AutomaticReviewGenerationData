Ceria and CeO2-containing materials exhibit catalytic properties in various oxidation and hydrogenation reactions, as well as in automotive exhaust catalysts. They are characterized by their reductive behavior, adsorption capabilities, and interactions with metals. In automotive exhaust catalysts, ceria plays a crucial role in dynamic behavior, promoting CO-NO reactions, and exhibits additional features beneficial for diesel emission control.
