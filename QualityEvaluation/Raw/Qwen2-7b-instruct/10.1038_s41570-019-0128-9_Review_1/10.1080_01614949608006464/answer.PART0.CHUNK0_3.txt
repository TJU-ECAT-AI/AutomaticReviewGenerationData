<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Ceria-based catalysts, particularly those containing Fe3Ni1, show superior activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH processes compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The performance, challenges, and potential improvements of these catalysts are largely determined by the type of support materials, their composition, and structural characteristics.
