[1] "Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction [57]."
[2] "The ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts was markedly higher than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst."
[3] "The Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst mainly favored side reactions—the reforming and cracking reactions."
[4] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenations of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Chromium-based catalysts are the most effective for the CO2-ODH reaction, as stated in the document.
2. The Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr, and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts showed significantly higher ethylene selectivity compared to the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst.
3. The Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst primarily favored side reactions, specifically reforming and cracking reactions.
4. The performance of the modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts is influenced by the modifier's impact on the catalyst's textural and structural properties, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base properties on the catalyst surface, collectively affecting its catalytic activity in CO2-assisted ethane dehydrogenation.

1. 铬基催化剂对于CO2-ODH反应是最有效的，正如文档中所述。
2. Fe5-Cr10/Zr、Mn5-Cr10/Zr和Co5-Cr10/Zr纳米复合催化剂在乙烷脱氢反应中相对于Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂显示出了明显更高的乙烯选择性。
3. Ni5-Cr10/Zr纳米复合催化剂主要倾向于副反应，即重整和裂解反应。
4. 修改后的Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂的性能受到修改剂对催化剂纹理和结构性质的影响，分布的铬物种和氧物种，以及催化剂表面的酸/碱性质的影响，这些因素共同决定了使用CO2作为氧化剂时乙烷脱氢反应的催化活性。
