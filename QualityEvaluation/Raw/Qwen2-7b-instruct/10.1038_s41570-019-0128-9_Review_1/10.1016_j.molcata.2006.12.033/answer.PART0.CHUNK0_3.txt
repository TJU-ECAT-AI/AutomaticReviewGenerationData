[1] "This investigation clearly shows that modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts exhibited varying activities in dehydronation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The modifiers of Fe, Co and Mn oxides markedly increased the ethylene selectivity of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst mainly favored side reactions—the reforming and cracking reactions."
[2] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide."

This study reveals that in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide, the use of iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn) oxides as modifiers significantly boosts the ethylene selectivity of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst. Conversely, nickel (Ni) as a modifier tends to favor side reactions such as reforming and cracking. The specific characteristics of the modifier impact the catalyst's textural and structural properties, the distribution of chromium and oxygen species, and the acid-base properties of the catalyst surface, collectively determining the catalyst's activity in ethane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

这项研究揭示，在以二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙烷脱氢反应中，铁（Fe）、钴（Co）和锰（Mn）的氧化物作为改性剂显著提高了Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂的乙烯选择性。相反，镍（Ni）作为改性剂倾向于促进副反应如重整和裂解。改性剂的特性影响催化剂的纹理和结构性质、铬和氧物种的分布以及催化剂表面的酸碱性质，共同决定了在二氧化碳作为氧化剂时，Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂的活性。
