[1] "This investigation clearly shows that modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts exhibited varying activities in dehydropnlation of ethane with carbon dioxide."
[2] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide."

This study highlights that the introduction of various modifiers, including Fe, Co, Mn, and Ni oxides, into Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts leads to diverse catalytic activities in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. The nature of the modifier impacts the catalyst's textural and structural properties, the distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and the acid/base properties of the catalyst surface. These factors collectively determine the catalytic efficiency of the modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in ethane dehydrogenation reactions.

This study reveals that in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide, the use of iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn) oxides as modifiers significantly boosts the ethylene selectivity of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst. Conversely, nickel (Ni) as a modifier tends to favor side reactions such as reforming and cracking. The specific characteristics of the modifier impact the catalyst's textural and structural properties, the distribution of chromium and oxygen species, and the acid-base properties of the catalyst surface, collectively determining the catalyst's activity in ethane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This study explores how the use of iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn) oxides as modifiers can significantly enhance the ethylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. On the contrary, nickel (Ni) as a modifier leads to a preference for side reactions such as reforming and cracking. The performance of the catalysts is influenced by multiple factors including the textural and structural properties of the catalyst, the distribution of chromium species and oxygen species on the catalyst surface, and the acid/base properties of the catalyst surface. These factors collectively determine the catalytic activity of the modified chromium oxide/zirconia (Cr2O3/ZrO2) nano-composite catalysts in the process of converting ethane to ethylene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant.
