[1] "Fe, Co and Mn oxides markedly increased ethylene selectivity, but the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst mainly favored side reactionsthe reforming and cracking reactions."
[2] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species,and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenations of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant."

This study explores how the use of iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn) oxides as modifiers can significantly enhance the ethylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. On the contrary, nickel (Ni) as a modifier leads to a preference for side reactions such as reforming and cracking. The performance of the catalysts is influenced by multiple factors including the textural and structural properties of the catalyst, the distribution of chromium species and oxygen species on the catalyst surface, and the acid/base properties of the catalyst surface. These factors collectively determine the catalytic activity of the modified chromium oxide/zirconia (Cr2O3/ZrO2) nano-composite catalysts in the process of converting ethane to ethylene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

本研究探讨了铁（Fe）、钴（Co）和锰（Mn）氧化物作为改性剂如何显著提高乙烷在二氧化碳氧化脱氢为乙烯过程中的乙烯选择性。相比之下，镍（Ni）作为改性剂倾向于促进副反应如重整和裂解。催化剂的性能受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂的结构和纹理性质、催化剂表面铬物种和氧物种的分布以及催化剂表面的酸/碱性质。这些因素共同决定了改性氧化铬/氧化锆（Cr2O3/ZrO2）纳米复合催化剂在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的情况下将乙烷转化为乙烯的催化活性。
