[1] "The highest isobutene yield reported in the literature (32.6%) for the isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide was obtained over K-Cr-MnO/SiO2, but the temperature of the process was 923 K [6]."
[2] "In our work, after 0.2 h time-on-stream at 873 K, the highest isobutene yields were achieved over VOx/Cact catalyst, both in CO2 atmosphere (43.8%) and under helium flow (38.7%)."
[3] "The highest activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures."
[4] "The high activity of the VOx/Cact, VOx/Al2O3, VOx/SiO2 and VOx/ZnO can be associated with their lowest initial temperature of reduction."
[5] "Consequntly, the low reducibility of VOx/La2O3 and VOx/CeO2 at 873 K (the temperature used for the isobutane dehydrogenation tests) gives the catalysts with low activity."

The study found that the VOx/Cact catalyst demonstrated the highest activity in dehydrogenating isobutane to isobutene when exposed to carbon dioxide, achieving yields of 43.8% and 38.7% under CO2 and helium atmospheres, respectively, at 873 K. The activity of the catalysts was closely tied to their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures, with the most active catalysts being those that could reduce at the lowest temperatures. The low reducibility of the VOx/La2O3 and VOx/CeO2 catalysts at 873 K resulted in lower activity levels.

研究发现，在二氧化碳存在下，VOx/Cact催化剂在873 K时表现出最高的异丁烷脱氢反应活性，异丁烯产率分别达到了43.8%和38.7%，在二氧化碳和氦气气氛中。催化剂的活性与其在较低温度下进行还原的能力密切相关，最活跃的催化剂能够在最低温度下进行还原。而VOx/La2O3和VOx/CeO2催化剂在873 K时的低还原性导致了其活性较低。
