[1] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ZrO2."
[2] "High activity of the VOx/Cact, VOx/Al2O3, VOx/SiO2 and VOx/ZnO can be associated with their lowest initial temperature of reduction."
[3] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures."
[4] "Consequntly, the low reducibility of VOx/La2O3 and VOx/CeO2 at 873 K (the temperature used for the isobutane dehydrogenation tests) gives the catalysts with low activity."
[5] "The results obtained show that CO2 enhances isobutane conversion in the reaction carried out over VOx/Cact catalyst."
[6] "Opposite trend is observed when vanadium is supported on the ZnO and Al2O3 surface, what can be explained by the presence of basic sites of medium strength - the catalyst surface can be partially blocked for the isobutane by adsorbed carbon dioxide."

1. The activity of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, in CO2-ODH reactions generally lags behind vanadium oxide catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. The performance, challenges, and potential for improvement are influenced by factors such as support materials, composition, and structural characteristics.

2. The support materials, composition, and structural factors play crucial roles in determining the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts. For instance, the support material can affect the reducibility and reactivity of the catalyst, thereby impacting its activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions.

3. The structure of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, including the arrangement and interaction of metal nanoparticles with the support, can significantly influence the reaction pathways and product distribution in CO2-ODH reactions.

4. Improvements in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts can be pursued through optimizing the support material, adjusting the composition (e.g., varying the ratio of Fe to Ni), and enhancing the structural stability and accessibility of active sites.

5. The effectiveness of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions may be limited due to the presence of basic sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface. These sites can block the isobutane molecules, reducing the catalyst's efficiency in the conversion process.

6. Despite these challenges, FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts have the potential for development and optimization to enhance their activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions. This can be achieved through careful selection of support materials, tuning of the catalyst composition, and exploring novel synthesis methods to improve the catalyst's structure and functionality.
