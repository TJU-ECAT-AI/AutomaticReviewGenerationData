[1] "The highest isobutene yield reported in the literature (32.6%) for the isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide was obtained over K-Cr-MnO/SiO2, but the temperature of the process was 923 K."
[2] "In our work, after 0.2 h time-on-stream at 873 K, the highest isobutene yields were achieved over VOx/Cact catalyst, both in CO2 atmosphere (43.8%) and under helium flow (38.7%)."
[3] "Similar promoting effect of CO2 was observed over the active carbon supported iron oxide and oxidized diamond supported vanadium oxide, but the isobutene yields at 873 K were only 23% and 14% in the presence of CO2, and 17 and 11% in the helium flow respectively."
[4] "On the other hand, very high amounts of H2 show that the hydrogen is produced not only by simple dehydrogenation but also by side reactions, such as hydrocarbon decomposition."
[5] "The TPD profiles can be divided into three temperature regions. The first region within the temperature range of 300-373 K, is usually connected with desorption of the physisorbed NH3 and CO2."
[6] "The initial temperature of the H2 uptake is around 500-600 K for the most active catalysts, while the Tmax position is increasing in the sequence Cact<ZnO<TiO2<Al2O3 <ZrO2<SiO2 <La2O3<CeO2, which is in agreement with the earlier report."

1. In comparison to vanadium oxide catalysts, FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts showed higher activity, selectivity, and efficiency in CO2-ODH reactions. This is due to the unique properties of the support material (CeO2), composition (Fe and Ni), and structural factors that enhance the catalyst's performance. Challenges and potential improvements involve refining the catalyst composition and structure to optimize activity and selectivity further.

2. The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 > ZrO2. High activity correlates with the catalyst's ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. The catalysts' performance is influenced by their support material, composition, and structural factors.

3. The results indicate that CO2 enhances the isobutane conversion in reactions conducted over VOx/Cact catalysts. This effect is opposite for vanadium catalysts supported on ZnO and Al2O3 surfaces, where the catalyst activity decreases due to the presence of basic sites of medium strength that may block the isobutane surface.

4. The high activity of the first four catalysts (VOx/Cact, VOx/Al2O3, VOx/SiO2, VOx/ZnO) is associated with their low initial temperature of reduction. The low reducibility of VOx/La2O3 and VOx/CeO2 at 873 K leads to lower activity due to their inability to undergo reduction efficiently at the operational temperature.

5. The acidity of the catalysts plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. While it promotes high activity, it also results in the formation of small amounts of isomerization products. The acidity is likely related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface, which can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts.

6. The TPD profiles of the tested catalysts show that they can be divided into three temperature regions, typically associated with the desorption of physisorbed NH3 and CO2. The reduction of vanadium oxide catalysts depends on the vanadium loading and support nature, influencing the initial temperature of hydrogen uptake and the maximum temperature (Tmax) of the reduction process.

1.FexNiy/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中与范德华氧化物催化剂相比，显示出更高的活性、选择性和效率。这归因于支持材料（CeO2）的独特性质、组分（Fe和Ni）以及结构因素，这些因素增强了催化剂的性能。挑战和改进的方向涉及优化催化剂的组成和结构，以进一步提高活性和选择性。

2. 支持的范德华氧化物催化剂在异丁烷脱氢反应中的活性下降顺序为Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 > ZrO2。高活性与催化剂在较低温度下进行还原的能力有关。催化剂的性能受到支持材料、组成和结构因素的影响。

3. 结果表明，二氧化碳增强了在使用VOx/Cact催化剂进行反应时的异丁烷转化率。这种效果与在ZnO和Al2O3表面的范德华催化剂活性降低相反，因为基本强度中等的站点可能导致异丁烷表面被吸附的二氧化碳部分阻塞。

4. 第一四个催化剂（VOx/Cact、VOx/Al2O3、VOx/SiO2、VOx/ZnO）的高活性与其较低的还原起始温度相关联。在873 K操作温度下，VOx/La2O3和VOx/CeO2的低可还原性导致活性较低，因为它们不能在操作温度下有效进行还原。

5. 催化剂的酸性在异丁烷脱氢过程中起着关键作用。虽然它促进了高活性，但也导致了少量异构化产物的形成。酸性可能与异丁烷在催化剂表面的吸附有关，这可能导致形成不需要的副产品。

6. 测试催化剂的TPD谱图显示，它们可以分为三个温度区域，通常与物理吸附的NH3和CO2的脱附相关联。催化剂中范德华氧化物的还原取决于钒加载量和支持性质，影响氢吸收的初始温度和最大温度（Tmax）的过程。
