[1] "The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene in the presence of carbon dioxide was carried out over supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
[2] "The highest isobutene yield reported in the literature (32.6%) for the isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide was obtained over K-Cr-MnO/SiO2, but the temperature of the process was 923 K."
[3] "The highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."
[4] "The results obtained show that CO2 enhances isobutane conversion in the reaction carried out over VOx/Cact catalyst."
[5] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures."
[6] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ZrO2."

The FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, specifically Fe3Ni1/CeO2, compare favorably with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions due to their higher activity, selectivity, and efficiency. The performance of these catalysts is influenced significantly by the support materials, composition, and structural factors. Catalysts like Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibit superior performance because they can undergo reduction at lower temperatures, enhancing their reactivity. The acidity of the catalyst surfaces, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation of isobutane, is another key factor in determining their effectiveness. The presence of considerable acidity on catalysts such as VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3 is likely responsible for their high activity. Additionally, CO2 has been shown to enhance the isobutane conversion when using VOx/Cact catalysts. However, the activity of catalysts supported on ZnO and Al2O3 is negatively affected by the presence of basic sites of medium strength, which can block the surface for isobutane. Future improvements may focus on optimizing the support materials and composition to further enhance catalyst performance.

FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中与钒氧化物催化剂相比具有更高的活性、选择性和效率。这些催化剂的性能受到支持材料、组成和结构因素的影响。像Fe3Ni1/CeO2这样的催化剂表现出优越的性能，因为它们能够在较低温度下进行还原，从而提高其反应性。催化剂表面的酸性是决定其有效性的重要因素，对于异丁烷脱氢反应至关重要。VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3等催化剂上存在的显著酸性可能是它们高活性的原因。此外，当使用VOx/Cact催化剂时，CO2已被证明可以增强异丁烷转化率。然而，ZnO和Al2O3上的支持催化剂的活性受到中强度碱性位点的影响，这可能会阻塞表面以供异丁烷使用。未来可能需要优化支持材料和组成以进一步提高催化剂性能。
