[1] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ZrO2."
[2] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures."
[3] "Consequntly, the low reducibility of VOx/La2O3 and VOx/CeO2 at 873 K (the temperature used for the isobutane dehydrogenation tests) gives the catalysts with low activity."
[4] "The results obtained show that CO2 enhances isobutane conversion in the reaction carried out over VOx/Cact catalyst."
[5] "Opposite trend is observed when vanadium is supported on the ZnO and Al2O3 surface, what can be explained by the presence of basic sites of medium strength - the catalyst surface can be partially blocked for the isobutane by adsorbed carbon dioxide."

1. The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts decreases in the order of Cact, Al2O3, SiO2, ZnO, La2O3, CeO2, TiO2, ZrO2. The high activity of the first four catalysts is due to their capability of undergoing reduction at lower temperatures. The low reducibility of VOx/La2O3 and VOx/CeO2 at 873 K leads to low activity. Carbon dioxide enhances isobutane conversion in the reaction conducted over VOx/Cact catalyst. However, the opposite trend is observed when vanadium is supported on ZnO and Al2O3 surfaces, which can be explained by the presence of basic sites of medium strength that partially block the isobutane surface by adsorbed carbon dioxide.

1. 支持的钒氧化物催化剂的活性顺序为Cact、Al2O3、SiO2、ZnO、La2O3、CeO2、TiO2、ZrO2。前四个催化剂的高活性与它们在较低温度下进行还原的能力有关。La2O3和CeO2在873 K下的低可还原性导致活性降低。二氧化碳增强了在VOx/Cact催化剂上进行的异丁烷脱氢反应的异丁烯转化率。然而，在ZnO和Al2O3表面支持钒时，观察到相反的趋势，这可以解释为中等强度的基本位点的存在，这些位点部分阻塞了吸附的二氧化碳对异丁烷表面的影响。
