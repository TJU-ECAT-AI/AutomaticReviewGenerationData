 Introduction
The
 rising
 level
 of
 carbon
 dioxide
 (CO2)
 in
 the
 atmosphere
 has
a
 detrimental
 effect
 on
 the
 environment,
 mainly
 contributing
 to
global
 warming
 [1].  Reducing
 the
 release
 of
 CO2 and
 implement-
ing
 CO2 recycling
 techniques
 have
 therefore
 become
 increasingly
important.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 conversion
 of
 CO2 via
 catalytic
 reac-
tions
 is
 considered
 as
 one
 of
 the
 most
 promising
 approaches
 for
CO2 abatement.
 Recently,
 much
 attention
 has
 been
 devoted
 toward
utilization
 of
 CO2 as
 an
 oxygen
 source
 or
 non-traditional
 (soft)
 oxi-
dant
 and
 oxygen
 transfer
 agent
 [2,3].
 In
 our
 previous
 studies,
 we
have
 investigated
 the
 soft
 oxidant
 nature
 and
 promotional
 effect
 of
CO2 in
 various
 reactions
 [3–6].
 The
 utilization
 of
 CO2 as
 a
 soft
 oxi-
dant
 will
 provide
 several
 potential
 advantages,
 which
 are
 normally
encountered
 in
 conventional
 processes
 such
 as
 deep
 oxidation,
 low
product
 selectivity
 and
 the
 formation
 of
 CO2 greenhouse
 gas
 as
 a
by-product
 [7].  Moreover,
 the
 utilization
 of
 CO2 in
 the
 ODH
 pro-
cess
 can
 encompass
 several
 prominent
 features
 like
 alleviating
 the
thermodynamic
 equilibrium
 limitations,
 minimizing
 the
 hot
 spot
phenomenon
 on
 the
 catalyst
 surface,
 poisoning
 the
 nonselective
sites
 of
 the
 catalysts,
 accelerating
 the
 reaction
 rate,
 enhancing

selectivity
 and
 suppressing
 the
 total
 oxidation
 products
 [4,8–11].
On
 the
 other
 hand,
 such
 consumption
 of
 CO2 shows
 a
 signiﬁcant
positive
 impact
 on
 the
 global
 carbon
 balance.
The
 unsaturated
 hydrocarbons
 are
 most
 important
 building
block
 chemicals
 in
 the
 industry.
 Among
 the
 parafﬁns,
 n-butane
 is
the
 least
 intensively
 studied
 alkane
 in
 the
 ODH
 processes
 where
CO2 is
 used
 as
 an
 oxidant.
 In
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 higher
 alka-
nes,
 generally
 the
 produced
 oleﬁns
 contain
 allylic
 hydrogen.
 The
bond
 dissociation
 energy
 of
 allylic
 hydrogen
 is
 much
 lower
 than
that
 of
 the
 starting
 substrate.
 Thus,
 the
 abstraction
 of
 hydrogen
from
 the
 allylic
 position
 may
 proceed
 more
 rapidly
 to
 produce
coke
 precursors.
 Therefore,
 avoidance
 of
 the
 deactivation
 of
 the
catalyst
 is
 very
 difﬁcult,
 which
 consequently
 results
 low
 yields
 of
oleﬁns
 [12,13].  Moreover,
 the
 formed
 alkenes
 are
 approximately
four
 times
 more
 reactive
 than
 butane.
 The
 high
 reactivity
 of
 alkenes
causes
 the
 lower
 selectivity
 to
 the
 desired
 products
 with
 increasing
the
 conversion
 of
 butane
 [14].
 Therefore,
 design
 of
 a
 selective
 cat-
alyst
 with
 high
 yields
 of
 alkenes
 remained
 a
 challenge
 in
 catalysis.
Vanadium
 oxide
 based
 materials
 are
 very
 often
 used
 as
 cata-
lysts
 in
 the
 ODH
 reactions
 [15].
 We  have
 also
 studied
 various
vanadium
 oxide
 based
 catalysts
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
 aromatic
 hydro-
carbons
 [4–6,8,16,17].
 Various
 vanadium
 oxide
 catalytic
 systems
such
 as
 VMgO
 [18],
 VOx/SiO2 [19],
 VOx/Al2O3 [20],
 V2O5/ZrO2 [21],
VOx/SBA–15
 [22]
 and
 VOx/USY
 [23]
 were
 reported
 in
 the
 liter-
ature
 for
 the
 synthesis
 of
 C4

cis-2-butene
 and
 1,3-butadiene)
 from
 n-butane
 with
 or
 without
oxidant
 (O2).
 Recently,
 Urlan
 et
 al.
 [24]
 studied
 the
 effect
 of
 CO2
on
 the
 catalytic
 ODH
 of
 n-butane
 with
 oxygen
 over
 TiP2O7 cata-
lysts.
 A
 decrease
 in
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 with
 carbon
 dioxide
 as
the
 unique
 oxidant
 (absence
 of
 oxygen)
 was
 noted
 over
 the
 TiP2O7
catalysts.
 The
 V–Mg–O
 catalyst
 has
 also
 shown
 a
 poor
 n-butane
conversion
 with
 CO2 despite
 a
 high
 selectivity
 to
 C4
 oleﬁns
 [25].
The
 sole
 presence
 of
 oxygen
 only
 tends
 to
 increase
 the
 activity
 of
these
 catalysts.
 The
 poor
 activity
 of
 the
 catalysts
 in
 the
 presence
 of
CO2 may
 be
 due
 to
 the
 lack
 of
 reoxidation
 efﬁciency
 of
 the
 cata-
lyst
 surface
 owing
 to
 strong
 adsorption
 of
 CO2 on
 the
 surface
 [24].
The
 promoting
 effect
 of
 CO2 was
 noticed
 on
 butenes
 yield
 over
oxidized
 diamond-supported
 Cr2O3 and
 V2O5 catalysts
 [13].
 The
acid–base
 and
 textural
 properties
 of
 the
 supports
 strongly
 affect
the
 catalytic
 performance.
 The
 mixed
 oxide
 nanocomposite
 cat-
alysts
 also
 displayed
 superior
 ODH
 activity
 than
 their
 individual
component
 oxides
 owing
 to
 enhancement
 in
 the
 acid–base
 bifunc-
tional
 behavior
 [17].
 The
 ZrO2 based
 mixed
 oxides;
 particularly,
the
 TiO2–ZrO2 mixed
 oxide
 is
 very
 promising
 for
 ODH
 of
 ethylben-
zene
 to
 styrene
 with
 CO2 as
 the
 soft
 oxidant
 [6].  Trimm
 and
 Gabbay
[26]
 studied
 oxidation
 of
 butene
 isomers
 over
 a
 Sn–Sb
 mixed
 oxide
catalyst
 and
 concluded
 that
 Sn4+ plays
 an
 important
 role
 in
 the
oxidation
 of
 n-butenes.
 Moreover,
 SnO2 shows
 a
 signiﬁcant
 role
 in
improving
 the
 dispersion
 and
 reducibility
 of
 the
 surface
 vanadium
oxide
 [27].
 The
 combination
 of
 SnO2 and
 ZrO2 also
 offered
 bet-
ter
 catalytic
 activity
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
 ethylbenzene
 to
 styrene
 than
those
 of
 constituent
 single
 oxides
 [6,17].
 The
 catalytic
 performance
of
 vanadium
 oxide
 catalysts
 depends
 on
 the
 acid–base
 character
 of
the
 supporting
 materials
 [28].
 Therefore,
 a
 combination
 catalyst
consisting
 of
 V2O5 and
 SnO2–ZrO2 were
 undertaken
 in
 the
 present
investigation
 against
 the
 aforesaid
 background.
Based
 on
 the
 above
 stated
 arguments,
 we
 have
 undertaken
SnO2–ZrO2 supported
 VOx materials
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
 n-butane
with
 CO2.
 The
 desired
 SnO2,
 ZrO2 and
 SnO2–ZrO2 supports
 were
synthesized
 by
 precipitation
 and
 coprecipitation
 methods,
 respec-
tively.
 V2O5 was
 deposited
 on
 the
 supports
 by
 a
 wet
 impregnation
method.
 The
 structural
 evaluation
 of
 the
 catalysts
 were
 thoroughly
studied
 using
 various
 physiochemical
 techniques

der

 The
 catalytic

mance
 was
 evaluated
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
 n-butane
 to
 C4

 in
 the

 phase
 under

 employing
 CO2 as

 Experimental
2.1.
 Preparation
 of
 catalysts
The
 SnO2–ZrO2 (SZ)
 mixed
 oxide
 supports
 (mole
 ratio
 of
SnO2/ZrO2 =
 1/9,
 1.5/8.5,
 3/7
 and
 5/5,
 abbreviated
 as
 SZ(X/Y),
 where
X/Y
 =
 SnO2/ZrO2 mole
 ratio)
 were
 synthesized
 by
 adopting
 a
 copre-
cipitation
 method
 from
 aqueous
 solutions
 of
 ZrOCl2 and
 SnCl4 (all
are
 from
 Aldrich,
 GR
 grade)
 by
 hydrolysis
 with
 aqueous
 ammo-
nium
 hydroxide
 solution.
 In
 a
 typical
 synthetic
 procedure,
 required
amounts
 of
 chloride
 precursors
 were
 dissolved
 in
 deionized
 water
separately
 to
 form
 0.1
 M
 aqueous
 metal
 salt
 solutions
 under
 vigor-
ous
 stirring
 at
 room
 temperature.
 Both
 the
 solutions
 were
 mixed
and
 stirred
 further
 for
 1
 h
 to
 ensure
 the
 formation
 of
 homogeneous
solution.
 To
 this
 mixed
 metal
 salts
 solution,
 dilute
 aqueous
 ammo-
nium
 hydroxide
 was
 added
 drop
 wise
 in
 a
 controlled
 manner
 under
vigorous
 stirring
 until
 the
 attainment
 of
 pH
 ∼9,
 and
 the
 stirring
 was
continued
 further
 2
 h.
 The
 resultant
 white
 precipitate
 gel
 was
 aged
for
 15
 h
 at
 room
 temperature.
 The
 resulting
 mixed
 precipitate
 gel
was
 separated
 by
 centrifugation
 and
 dried
 at
 100 ◦C
 for
 12
 h.
 Finally,
the
 material
 was
 calcined
 at
 600 ◦C
 for
 8
 h
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 2 ◦C/min
 in
static
 air.
 The
 pure
 ZrO2 and
 SnO2 supports
 were
 also
 synthesized
in
 the
 same
 manner
 mentioned
 above.
On
 the
 calcined
 supports,
 V2O5 was
 deposited
 by
 adopting
 a
standard
 wet
 impregnation
 method.
 A
 7.5
 wt.%
 V2O5 on
 SZ(X/Y)
(abbreviated
 as
 7.5VSZ(X/Y),
 where
 X/Y
 =
 SnO2/ZrO2 mole
 ratio),
SnO2 (VZ)
 and
 ZrO2 (VZ)
 supports,
 and
 a
 5
 wt.%
 V2O5 on
 SZ(1.5/8.5)
(abbreviated
 as
 5VSZ(1.5/8.5))
 were
 synthesized
 by
 a
 wet
 impreg-
nation
 method.
 To
 achieve
 this,
 the
 desired
 amount
 of
 ammonium
metavanadate
 (Aldrich)
 was
 dissolved
 in
 aqueous
 oxalic
 acid
 solu-
tion
 to
 which
 the
 ﬁnely
 powdered
 support
 was
 added
 under
continuous
 stirring.
 The
 excess
 solvent
 was
 removed
 on
 a
 water-
bath
 under
 vigorous
 stirring.
 Finally,
 the
 resulting
 material
 was
oven
 dried
 at
 100 ◦C
 for
 12
 h,
 subsequently
 calcined
 at
 600 ◦C
 for
 5
 h
at
 a
 heating
 rate
 of
 2 ◦C/min
 in
 static
 air
 to
 obtain
 the
 ﬁnal
 catalyst.

 The
 acidity
 and

 were
 determined
by
 NH3-TPD
 and
 CO2-TPD,
 respectively.
 In
 a
 typical
 experiment,
∼100
 mg  catalyst
 sample
 was
 pretreated
 in
 a
 ﬂow
 of
 helium
 gas
 at
300 ◦C
 for
 1
 h
 and
 allowed
 to
 cool
 to
 50 ◦C.
 After
 this,
 the

 was

 A
 similar
 behavior
 was
 found
 in
 the
case
 of
 mixed
 oxide
 catalysts
 such
 as
 MnO2–ZrO2 and
 TiO2–ZrO2
[6,29].
 The
 decrease
 in
 the
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 after
 impregnation
of
 vanadium
 oxide
 is
 attributed
 to
 penetration
 of
 the
 deposited
active
 vanadium
 oxide
 species
 into
 the
 pores
 of
 the
 support
 thereby
narrowing
 its
 pore
 diameter
 or
 blocking
 some
 of
 the

 and
solid-state
 reactions
 between
 the

 and

 only

tion

 corresponding
 to
 the
 vanadium

 was
 observed
at

 conforms
 that

 oxide
 is
 pre-
sented
 in
 either
 a

 form
 or
 no

 vanadium
oxide
 exists
 over
 the
 SnO2 surface.
 The
 XRD
 analysis
 of
 VZ
 sample
revealed
 the
 presence
 of
 monoclinic
 ZrO2 and
 Zr(V2O7)
 mixed
 oxide
phases.
 This
 implies
 that
 solid-state
 reactions
 occurred
 between
the
 impregnated
 vanadium
 oxide
 species
 and
 the
 zirconia
 in
 the
VZ
 sample.
 The
 intense
 peaks
 of
 VZ
 and
 VS
 samples
 are
 due
 to
well
 crystalline
 phases.
 In
 contrast
 to
 the
 above,
 the
 SZ(1.5/8.5)
mixed
 oxide
 exhibited
 relatively
 broad
 and
 low
 intense
 peaks
 cor-
responding
 to
 monoclinic

 of
 ZrO2.
 Interestingly,
 the
 peaks
corresponding
 to
 the
 crystalline
 SnO2 phase
 are
 not
 observed
 in
the
 SZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample.
 It
 could
 be
 due
 to
 either
 amorphous
 nature
of
 SnO2 or
 the
 formation
 of
 single-phase
 solid
 solution
 between
SnO2 and
 ZrO2 as
 reported
 by
 Ba
 et
 al.
 [30]
 for
 indium–tin
 oxide
system.
 After
 impregnation
 of
 vanadium
 oxide,
 the
 crystallinity
of
 the
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample
 was
 improved.
 However,
 the
 XRD
patterns
 of
 the
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample
 showed
 typically
 very
 low
intensity
 peaks
 compared
 to
 that
 of
 its
 individual

oxide
 supported
 vanadia
 catalysts.
 Further,
 the
 diffraction
 lines
corresponding
 to
 the
 monoclinic
 ZrO2,
 Zr–V
 mixed

 phase
(Zr(V2O7))
 and
 SnO2 were
 also
 observed
 in

 The

 which
 is

 In

 the

 exhibited
 relatively
 good

 with

 Interestingly,
 the

 resulted
 in

 of

 TPD
 and
 TPR
 studies
The
 acid–base
 properties
 of
 the
 metal
 oxide
 catalysts
 play
 a
 vital
role
 in
 the
 development
 of
 scientiﬁc
 criteria
 for
 catalytic
 appli-
cations.
 Higher
 basicity
 on
 the
 catalyst
 surface
 prevents
 the
 side
reactions
 by
 easy
 desorption
 of
 alkenes
 [32].
 The
 higher
 basicity
also
 inhibits
 further
 dehydrogenation
 of
 n-butenes
 to
 butadiene
[32].
 However,
 the
 optimum
 basic
 sites
 are
 required
 to
 control
 the
selectivity
 of
 C4
 oleﬁns.
 To
 know
 the
 acidic
 and
 basic
 properties
 of
the
 catalysts,
 NH3-
 and
 CO2-TPD
 experiments,
 respectively
 were
carried
 out.
 The
 CO2-TPD
 proﬁles
 of
 VS,
 VZ
 and
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
along
 with
 SZ(1.5/8.5)
 support
 are
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 3.
 The
 char-
acteristics
 of
 acid
 and
 base
 strengths
 are
 expressed
 in
 terms
 of
different
 temperature
 ranges
 wherein
 the
 NH3 or
 CO2 are
 des-
orbed.
 The
 weak,
 medium,
 strong
 and
 very
 strong
 basic
 sites
 are
estimated
 from
 the
 CO2-TPD
 curves
 for
 the
 temperature
 range
of
 100–250,
 250–400,
 400–650
 and
 >
 650 ◦C,
 respectively
 [33].
Addition
 of
 vanadium
 oxide
 shifted
 the
 desorption
 temperature
maximum
 (Tmax)
 to
 low
 temperature
 side
 for
 supported
 catalysts
compared
 to
 the
 support.
 The
 CO2-TPD
 proﬁles
 of
 all
 the
 supported
vanadium
 oxide
 catalysts
 revealed
 three
 Tmax,
 one
 at
 ∼110 ◦C
 and
the
 other
 two
 at
 ∼355
 and
 ∼415 ◦C,
 respectively
 ascribed
 to
 weak,
medium
 and
 strong
 basic
 sites.
 The
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 catalyst
 exhib-
ited
 more
 basic
 sites
 (peak
 intensity)
 than
 VS
 and
 VZ
 samples.
Furthermore,
 for
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample,
 the
 peak
 corresponding
 to
medium
 strength
 basic
 sites
 is
 slightly
 shifted
 to
 high
 temperature
side
 compared
 to
 VZ.
 These
 results
 clearly
 envisaged

 the
 metal
 oxides.
 In
 general,
 the
 mixed
oxide
 catalysts
 show
 more
 number
 of
 basic
 sites
 than
 the
 individual
component
 oxides.
 From
 the
 CO2-TPD
 proﬁle
 of
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5),
 it
could
 be
 stated
 that
 more
 number
 of
 basic
 sites
 are
 generated
 due
to
 mixing
 of
 SnO2 to
 VZ,
 similar
 to
 an
 enhancement
 in
 the
 speciﬁc
surface
 area.
 An
 analogous
 observation
 was
 also
 found
 in
 the
 case
 of
TiO2–ZrO2 mixed
 oxide
 which
 not
 only
 showed
 more
 basicity,
 but
also
 a
 large
 number
 of
 basic
 sites
 than
 that
 of
 individual
 component
oxides
 (TiO2 and
 ZrO2)
 [6].
The
 NH3-TPD
 proﬁles
 of
 the
 VS,
 VZ,
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 and
SZ(1.5/8.5)
 samples
 are
 presented
 in
 Fig.

 Based
 on
 the
 NH3 des-
orption
 temperature,
 the
 acidic
 sites
 were
 categorized
 into
 three
types.
 The
 NH3 desorbed
 below
 200 ◦C
 is
 the
 measure
 of
 weak
acidic
 sites,
 followed
 by
 the
 desorption
 in
 the
 temperature
 range
200–350 ◦C
 and
 above
 350 ◦C
 corresponds
 to
 medium
 and
 strong
acid
 sites,
 respectively

to
 high
 temperature
 side
 for
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample
 compared
 to
SZ(1.5/8.5).
 In
 the
 case
 of
 VS
 and
 VZ
 samples,
 the
 Tmax were
 located
at
 ∼115
 and
 ∼435 ◦C
 attributed
 to
 weak
 and
 strong
 acid
 sites,
respectively.
 In
 contrast
 to
 VS
 and
 VZ
 samples,
 the
 NH3-TPD
 proﬁle
of
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 was
 observed
 to
 spread
 out
 over
 the
 tempera-
ture
 range
 from
 50
 to
 560 ◦C,
 which
 indicates
 that,
 the
 acid
 strength
is
 distributed
 from
 weak
 to
 strong.
 However,
 there
 is
 more
 num-
ber
 of
 acid
 sites
 located
 at
 low
 temperature
 region
 than
 at
 high
temperature.
 Moreover,
 new
 acid
 sites
 are
 generated
 at
 medium
acidic
 site
 region.
 The
 interaction
 between
 the
 two
 oxides
 gener-
ates
 a
 signiﬁcantly
 greater
 surface
 acidity
 than
 that
 of
 the
 single
component
 oxides.
 These
 results
 also
 indicate
 the
 existence
 of
 syn-
ergistic
 effect
 between
 the
 metal
 oxides.
 According
 to
 Tanabe’s
hypothesis,
 the
 acidity
 of
 binary
 oxide
 is
 formed
 by
 an
 excess
 of
a
 negative
 or
 positive
 charge
 in
 the
 structure
 [35].
 Thus,
 the
 NH3-
and
 CO2-TPD
 results
 signify
 that
 the
 addition
 of
 SnO2 enhances

 acid–base
 properties
 of
 the
 mixed

 especially
 more

 are

 In
 addition
 to
 this,
 change
 in
 the
 acid–base
strength
 after

 of

 implies
 optimization
 of
 the
acid–base
 bifunctionality.
TPR
 was
 carried
 out
 to
 gain
 information
 on
 the
 reduction
properties
 of
 the
 samples
 through
 the
 analysis
 of
 the
 reduction
temperatures,
 and
 also
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 the
 support
 on
 the
 active
metal
 oxides.
 TPR
 data
 strongly
 depends
 on
 the
 experimental
conditions
 and
 provides
 important
 comparative
 information.
 The
TPR
 proﬁles
 of
 various
 vanadia
 containing
 samples
 (VS,
 VZ
 and
7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5))
 along
 with
 SZ(1.5/8.5)
 support
 are
 presented
 in
Fig.
 5.
 The
 SnO2 support
 is
 reducible,
 whereas
 the
 ZrO2 is
 not
 eas-
ily
 reducible.
 The
 SZ(1.5/8.5)
 mixed
 oxide
 support
 did
 not
 exhibit
any
 signiﬁcant
 reduction
 peaks
 up
 to
 700 ◦C,
 but,
 a
 broad
 peak
is
 observed
 after
 this
 temperature
 ascribed
 to
 reduction
 of
 SnO2.
This
 signiﬁes
 that
 the
 mixed
 oxide
 support
 is
 quite
 stable.
 As
 per
the
 literature,
 the
 bulk
 V2O5 exhibits
 multiple
 reduction
 peaks
between
 531–1008 ◦C
 [16].
 The
 reducibility
 of
 V2O5 is
 strongly
inﬂuenced
 by
 the
 type
 and
 reducibility
 of
 the
 oxide
 supports
[36].
 In
 supported
 vanadia
 catalysts,
 the
 reduction
 temperature
of
 vanadia
 has
 been
 shifted
 to
 lower
 temperatures
 in
 compar-
ison
 to
 the
 bulk
 V2O5.
 The
 VZ
 sample
 exhibited
 two
 reduction
peaks
 located
 at
 ∼474
 and
 ∼578 ◦C.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 VS
 catalyst,
 two
reduction
 peaks
 were
 observed
 below
 450 ◦C
 and
 a
 broad
 peak
at
 ∼780 ◦C.
 The
 peaks
 at
 lower
 temperatures
 in
 both
 the
 cases
are
 ascribed
 to
 the
 reduction
 of
 vanadium
 oxide
 species
 [37].
 It
is
 clear
 from
 these
 results
 that
 the
 SnO2 lowered
 the
 reducibility
of
 vanadium
 oxide
 compared
 to
 ZrO2.
 Interestingly,
 the
 addition
of
 SnO2 to
 VZ
 sample,
 the
 reduction
 peak
 at
 low
 temperature
is
 shifted
 further
 toward
 the
 lower
 temperature
 side
 compared
to
 VS
 and
 VZ
 samples.
 This
 eventually
 indicates
 that
 the
 mixed
oxide
 support
 facilitates
 easy
 reduction
 of
 the
 vanadium
 oxide
compared
 to
 its
 individual
 oxides.
 The
 reducibility
 of
 the
 surface
vanadium
 oxide
 on
 various
 oxide
 supports
 is
 in
 the
 following
order:
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 >
 VS
 >
 VZ.
 The
 high
 temperature
 reduction
peak
 (730 ◦C)
 is
 probably
 due
 to
 the
 reduction
 of
 either
 SnO2 or
V–Sn–O
 solid
 solution.

The

 n-butane.
 The

 and

 are
 depicted
 in
 Fig.

 The
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
sample
 exhibited
 signiﬁcant
 enhancement
 of
 catalytic
 performance
compared
 to
 VS
 and
 VZ.
 The
 observed
 n-butane
 conversion
 and
C4
 oleﬁns
 selectivity
 over
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample
 were
 22.34
 and
36.63%,
 respectively.
 The
 catalytic
 results
 signify
 that
 compatible
active
 sites
 are
 generated
 by
 the
 addition
 of
 SnO2 to
 VZ
 sample.
Surprisingly,
 the
 surface
 area
 (Table

 of
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample
 is
much
 higher
 than
 that
 of
 its

 synthesized
 under
 identical
 conditions.
 More-
over,
 the

 and

 clearly
 demonstrated
 that

 are
 more
 on

 samples.
 The
 mixed
 oxide
 support
 also
 lowered
 the
 reduc-
tion
 temperature
 of
 vanadium
 oxide
 supported
 on
 SZ(1.5/8.5).
 The
addition
 of
 SnO2 to
 VZ
 sample
 enhanced
 the
 surface
 area,
 acid–base
properties,
 especially
 more
 number
 of
 medium
 strength
 acid–base
sites,
 and
 decreased
 reduction
 temperature
 of
 vanadia,
 which
 are
anticipated
 to
 enhance
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 for
 the
 ODH
 of
n-butane
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2.
 The
 high
 activity
 may
 also
 be
attributed
 to
 the
 ability
 to
 release
 oxygen
 due
 to
 the
 loosening
 of
the
 vanadium–oxygen
 bond
 induced
 by
 the
 presence
 of
 tin
 oxide
[38].
 The
 C4
 oleﬁns
 distribution
 and
 the
 total
 selectivity
 of
 products
strongly
 depend
 on
 the
 acid–base
 nature
 of
 the
 catalyst
 surface
[28].
 Over
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample,
 the
 selectivity
 of
 1-butene
 is
high
 compared
 to
 2-butenes
 that
 means
 the
 ratio
 of
 1-butene/2-
butenes
 is
 more
 than
 one.
 Blasco
 et
 al.
 [28]
 also
 reported
 that
 the
1-butene/2-butene
 ratio
 is
 ≥1
 and
 <1
 over
 the
 catalysts
 with
 acidic
and
 basic
 character
 on
 the
 surface,
 respectively.
To
 optimize
 the
 catalyst
 composition,
 ODH
 of
 n-butane
 in
 the
presence
 of
 CO2 was
 studied
 by
 varying
 both
 V2O5 content
 and
SnO2/ZrO2 ratios.
 The
 ODH
 of
 n-butane
 was
 carried
 out
 over
SZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample
 with
 different
 vanadia
 loadings
 (0,
 5
 and
 7.5
 wt.%
V2O5)
 at
 the
 same
 600 ◦C
 and
 WHSV
 of
 600
 mL
 h−1 g−1 catalyst.
The
 conversion
 of
 n-butane
 and
 the
 selectivity
 of
 C4
 oleﬁns
 are
depicted
 in
 Fig.
 7(A).
 The
 5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 and
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 samples
exhibited
 excellent
 conversion
 and
 product
 selectivity
 compared
to
 SZ(1.5/8.5)
 support.
 This
 observation
 indicates
 that
 the
 vanadia
is
 obviously
 an
 active
 component
 for
 this
 reaction.
 Redox
 nature
of
 the
 vanadium
 oxide
 is
 also
 one
 of
 the
 factors
 among
 various
factors
 that
 determine
 the
 catalytic
 properties
 of
 vanadium
 oxide-
based
 catalysts,
 which
 play
 a
 key
 role
 in
 the
 ODH,
 oxidation

 The
 conversion
 of
 n-
butane
 was
 augmented
 with
 vanadium
 oxide
 loading
 up
 to
 7.5
 wt.%,
despite
 the
 decline
 in
 selectivity.
 A
 high
 selectivity
 (45.53%)
 of
 C4
oleﬁns
 was
 observed
 at
 5
 wt.%
 vanadia
 loading
 with
 a
 conversion
 of
n-butane
 7.79%.
 The
 sample
 with
 7.5
 wt.%
 vanadia
 over
 SZ(1.5/8.5)
support
 showed
 a
 high
 n-butane
 conversion
 (22.34%),
 but
 selec-
tivity
 of
 C4
 oleﬁns
 was
 lower
 (36.63%)
 than
 that
 of
 the
 5
 wt.%
 of
vanadia
 supported
 catalyst
 (45.53%).
 The
 optimization
 of
 the
 SnO2
and
 ZrO2 composition
 (SnO2/ZrO2 =
 1/9,
 1.5/8.5,
 3/7
 and
 5/5)
 on
 the
ODH
 of
 n-butane
 with
 CO2 was
 also
 investigated
 at
 the
 same
 600 ◦C
and
 WHSV
 of
 600
 mL
 h−1 g−1 catalyst
 and
 the
 results
 are
 presented
in
 Fig.
 7(B).
 The
 conversion
 of
 n-butane
 and
 C4
 oleﬁns
 selectivity
were
 found
 to
 increase
 with
 increase
 in
 SnO2 from
 10
 to
 15%
 and
 at
15%
 SnO2 the
 conversion
 of
 n-butane
 was
 23.34%.
 The
 high
 conver-
sion
 of
 n-butane
 could
 be
 due
 to
 optimum
 acid–base
 sites.
 Further
increase
 in
 the
 SnO2 content,
 a
 diminishing
 trend
 in
 the
 conversion
and
 selectivity
 was
 noticed.
 Among
 various
 samples
 investigated,
the
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 catalyst
 with
 15%
 SnO2 was
 more
 prominent
exhibiting
 23.34%
 n-butane
 conversion
 and
 36.63%
 C4
 oleﬁns
 selec-
tivity.
 Therefore,
 based
 on
 these
 results
 optimum
 composition
 of
the
 support
 is
 found
 to
 be
 SnO2/ZrO2 =
 1.5/8.5.
 These
 results
 clearly
indicate
 that
 the
 catalyst
 composition
 signiﬁcantly
 inﬂuences
 the
catalytic
 activity.
The
 catalytic
 activity
 of
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 at
 different
 reaction
temperatures
 (500,
 550
 and
 600 ◦C)
 at
 a
 constant
 WHSV
 of
600
 mL  h−1 g−1 catalyst
 are
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 8.
 The
 catalytic
 activity
of
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 at
 500 ◦C
 is
 very
 low,
 wherein,
 the
 conversion
 of
n-butane
 is
 only
 2%,
 but
 the
 selectivity
 of
 C4
 oleﬁns
 is
 82%.
 As
 the
reaction
 temperature
 increases
 from
 500
 to
 600 ◦C,
 the
 conversion
of
 n-butane
 increased,
 but
 the
 selectivity
 of
 C4
 oleﬁns
 substan-
tially
 decreased.
 It
 is
 quite
 obvious
 that
 as
 the
 reaction
 temperature
increases
 the
 conversion
 of
 reactants
 increases
 whereas
 the
 selec-
tivity
 to
 the
 desired
 products
 certainly
 declines.
 Similar
 observation
was
 also
 reported
 by
 Bhattacharyya
 et
 al.
 [39]
 over
 vanadium
 oxide
catalysts,
 in
 which
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 temperature
 from
 510
 to
630 ◦C,
 n-butane
 conversion
 was
 linearly
 increased,
 while
 the
 selec-
tivity
 of
 butenes
 and
 butadiene
 were
 gradually
 decreased.
 Urlan
et
 al.
 [24]
 have
 also
 reported
 similar
 trend
 with
 and
 without
 (N2)
CO2 in
 the
 feed.
To
 understand
 the
 potential
 role
 of
 CO2,
 the
 ODH
 of
 n-butane
was
 investigated
 over
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 catalyst
 in
 the
 presence
 and
absence
 (He)
 of
 CO2 again
 at
 600 ◦C
 and
 WHSV
 of
 600
 mL  h−1 g−1
catalyst.
 As
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 9,
 a
 signiﬁcant
 difference
 in
 the
n-butane
 conversion
 and
 C4
 oleﬁns
 selectivity
 was
 noted
 in
the
 presence
 and
 absence
 of
 CO2.
 The
 catalytic
 performance
 of
7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 CO2 is
 obviously

than
 that
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2,
 indicating
 the
 promoting
 role
 of
CO2 in
 the
 ODH
 of
 n-butane.
 As
 elaborated
 elsewhere
 [13],
 a
 direct
dehydrogenation
 of
 n-butane
 takes
 place
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 CO2 (Eq.
(1)).
 The
 dehydrogenation
 of
 alkanes
 can
 be
 carried
 out
 to
 produce
the
 oleﬁns
 with
 accompanying
 molecular
 hydrogen
 as
 a
 byproduct.
However,
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 alkanes
 is
 an
 endothermic
 reac-
tion
 and
 requires
 high
 temperature
 and
 low
 pressure
 to
 ensure
 a
sufﬁcient
 yield
 of
 product.
 A
 high
 reaction
 temperature
 with
 excess
steam
 as
 diluent
 shifts
 the
 reaction
 equilibrium
 to
 the
 product
 side.
As
 advocated
 by
 Cavani
 and
 Triﬁro
 [40],
 the
 oxidation
 of
 produced
hydrogen
 with
 CO2 (Eq.
 (2))
 shifts
 the
 dehydrogenation
 equilibrium
to
 higher
 yield
 side
 by
 increasing
 both
 conversion
 and
 selectiv-
ity.
 The
 reverse
 water-gas-shift
 (RWGS)
 reaction
 (Eq.
 (2))
 coupled
with
 the
 simple
 dehydrogenation
 operates
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2
as
 shown
 in
 Eqs.
 (1)
 and
 (2).
C4H10 ↔
 C4H8 +
 H2
(1)
H2 +
 CO2 →
 CO
 +
 H2O(RWGS)
(2)
CO2 +
 C
 →
 2CO
 
(3)
A
 considerable
 amount
 of
 CO
 and
 H2O
 were
 formed
 during
the
 ODH
 of
 n-butane
 over
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 sample
 where
 CO2 was
employed
 as
 an
 oxidant,
 which
 demonstrates
 the
 occurrence
 of
 a
reaction
 between
 CO2 and
 H2 (RWGS).
 Removal
 of
 deposited
 car-
bon
 through
 the
 Boudart
 reaction
 is
 another
 plausible
 reason
 for
the
 formation
 of
 CO
 (Eq.
 (3)).
 The
 promoting
 effect
 of
 CO2 in
 the
ODH
 reaction
 is
 mainly
 due
 to
 the
 potential
 role
 of
 CO2 acting
 as
hydrogen
 acceptor
 (Eq.
 (2)) and
 also
 facilitates
 the
 elimination
 of
deposited
 carbon.
 The
 CO2 may
 also
 maintain
 a
 higher
 oxidation
state
 of
 vanadium
 species
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 lower
 alkanes
[13].
 These
 results
 are
 found
 to
 correlate
 well
 with
 observations
made
 by
 Nakagawa
 et
 al.
 [13],
 who
 investigated
 recently
 the
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 light
 alkanes
 over
 oxidized
 diamond-supported
catalysts
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2.
Catalyst
 deactivation
 is
 often
 encountered
 in
 the
 ODH
 of
 alka-
nes.
 Therefore,
 time-on-stream
 measurements
 are
 most
 signiﬁcant
to
 understand
 the
 behavior
 of
 various
 catalytic
 systems.
 The
 con-
version
 of
 n-butane
 and
 selectivity
 to
 n-butenes
 and
 butadiene
 over
7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 catalyst
 at
 600 ◦C
 and
 WHSV
 of
 600
 mL
 h−1 g−1 cat-
alyst
 were
 investigated
 and
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 10.  The
 time-on-stream
studies
 revealed
 that
 the
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
 catalyst
 shows
 a
 decline
 in
the
 conversion
 of
 n-butane
 with
 reaction
 time.
 The
 decrease
 in
 the
n-butane
 conversion
 was
 faster
 at
 initial
 reaction
 times
 and
 there-
after
 almost
 stable.
 The
 C4
 oleﬁns
 selectivity
 also
 decreased
 faster
at
 initial
 reaction
 times
 and
 much
 slower
 at
 longer
 reaction
 times.
The
 decrease
 in
 the
 activity
 was
 found
 to
 be
 due
 to
 the
 deactivation

 Conclusions
In the
 present
 investigation,
 a
 series
 of
 SnO2–ZrO2 mixed
 oxides
and
 its
 individual
 component
 oxides
 were
 prepared
 by
 coprecipi-
tation
 and
 precipitation
 methods,
 respectively.
 Different
 wt.
 %
 of
vanadia
 was
 deposited
 on
 the
 calcined
 support
 oxides
 by
 a
 wet
impregnation
 method
 and
 evaluated
 for
 oxidative
 dehydrogena-
tion
 of
 n-butane
 using
 CO2 as
 the
 soft
 oxidant.
 Among
 various
 cat-
alysts
 investigated,
 the
 7.5
 wt.%
 V2O5/SnO2–ZrO2 (7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5))
catalyst
 exhibited
 a
 high
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 and
 superior
acid–base
 bifunctionality,
 especially
 more
 number
 of
 medium
strength
 acid–base
 sites
 were
 generated
 than
 its
 individual
 oxide
supported
 vanadia
 catalysts.
 The
 TPR
 analysis
 revealed
 that
 the
vanadia
 reduces
 at
 a
 lower
 temperature
 when
 deposited
 on
 the
SnO2–ZrO2 support.
 These
 properties
 of
 the
 catalyst
 were
 found
 to
show
 a
 profound
 inﬂuence
 on
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 for
 the
 ODH
of
 n-butane
 with
 CO2 as
 the
 soft
 oxidant.
 The
 CO2 as
 the
 oxi-
dant
 also
 exhibited
 a
 signiﬁcant
 promoting
 effect
 on
 the
 n-butane
conversion
 and
 C4
 oleﬁns
 selectivity.
 The
 catalyst
 composition
and
 reaction
 temperature
 showed
 a
 considerable
 inﬂuence
 on
 the
activity.
 Among
 various
 catalysts
 investigated,
 the
 7.5VSZ(1.5/8.5)
sample
 exhibited
 highest
 conversion
 of
 n-butane
 (22.34%)
 with
best
 selectivity
 to
 C4
 oleﬁns
 (36.63%).
 Further
 studies
 are
 under
active
 progress
 to
 exploit
 the
 ZrO2 based
 mixed
 oxide
 supported
vanadia
 catalysts
 for
 ODH
 of
 n-butane
 with
 CO2.
