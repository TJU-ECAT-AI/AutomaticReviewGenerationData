ABSTRACT 
Over the past several years, cerium oxide and Ce0,-containing materials have 
come under intense scrutiny as catalysts and as structural and electronic pro- 
moters of heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Recent developments regarding 
the characterization of ceria and Ce0,-containing catalysts are critically re- 
viewed with a special focus towards catalyst interaction with small molecules 
such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, oxygen, and nitric oxide. Relevant cat- 
alytic and technological applications such as the use of ceria in automotive 
exhaust emission control and in the formulation of SO, reduction catalysts is 
described. A survey of the use of Ce0,-containing materials as oxidation and 
reduction catalysts is also presented. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Over the past several years, cerium oxide and Ce0,-containing materials 
have come under intense scrutiny as catalysts and as structural and electronic 
promoters of heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Undoubtedly, the utilization 
of CeO, as a key component in three-way catalysts (TWC) for the treatment 
of exhaust gas from automobiles [l-31 constitutes its economically and tech- 
nologically most important application, and has stimulated a strong research 
effort in this area; however, other catalytic applications such as the use of 
CeO, in the removal of SO, from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) flue gases 
[4-61 or its use as a component of several oxidation catalysts [7-141 have 
also been reported. The rapid growth in the use and the characterization of 
Ce0,-containing catalysts in the past decade is well documented by a con- 
siderable increase in the number of articles that have appeared in the literature 
on this topic (29 papers in 1980, 216 in 1994). Interestingly, and despite its 
obvious importance, a more detailed mechanistic understanding (at the atomic 
level) on how cerium effects catalytic processes is still a matter of consid- 
erable debate, although some key findings are well established. For example, 
the use of Ce in three-way catalysts relies primarily on (a) the beneficial 
effect of precious metal-ceria interactions and (b) 
on the activity of the redox 
couple Ce"'-Ce"' 
with its ability to change from CeIV 
(CeO,) under oxidizing 
conditions to Ce'" (Ce,O,) under net reducing conditions and vice versa. CeO, 
has also been shown to induce secondary processes which can affect catalyst 
performance in several applications; specifically, ceria is known to (a) 
affect 
the dispersion of supported metals; (b) 
promote the water gas shift and steam 
reforming reactions; (c) increase the thermal stability of the support; (d) 
pro- 
mote noble metal reduction and oxidation; (e) 
store and release oxygen, hy- 
drogen, and sulfur; (f) form surface and bulk vacancies; and (g)

metallic M-Ce compounds. Discriminating between the various effects can 
be difficult as these often occur concurrently; however, due to strong and 
decisive efforts aimed at a detailed characterization of these materials, many 
of these effects and their influences on catalysis can now be rationalized. This 
review provides a critical analysis of recent developments in the characteri- 
zation of Ce0,-based and Ce0,-containing catalysts, and a description of 
some of their more relevant catalytic applications. Particular attention is given 
to the role of lattice vacancies in CeO, and Ce0,-based mixed oxides and 
how these affect the catalytic chemistry, as well as the effects on catalysis 
arising from the occurrence of metal-ceria interactions.

STUDIES 
A. Reductive Behavior 
Cerium oxide has the fluorite (CaF,) structure, Fig. 1, consisting of a 
cubic close-packed array of metal atoms with all tetrahedral holes filled by 
oxygen. When treated in a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures, 
CeO, is known to form a continuum of oxygen-deficient, nonstoichiometric 
CeO,-, oxides (with 0 < x I 
0.5) [15-171, while at lower temperatures (T < 
723 K), ceria forms a series of discrete compositions as evident from its phase 
diagram [16]. Notably, even after loss of considerable amounts of oxygen 
from its lattice and formation of a large number of oxygen vacancies, CeO, 
remains in its fluorite crystal structure, and these suboxides are readily re- 
oxidized to CeO, by exposure to an oxidizing environment [15,18,19]. The

reductive behavior of CeO, (in pure and supported CeO, and M/CeO, sys- 
tems) and their relation to catalysis have been studied in great detail by using 
several complementary techniques such as chemisorption [20-231, tempera- 
ture-programmed reduction [ 
18,23-321 and desorption [23,33-351, Fourier- 
transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy [

[43,57,60], magnetic susceptibility studies [ 
18,22,32,70,71], and semiconduc- 
tivity studies [71,72]. 
In the following sections we summarize the reductive behavior of ceria 
and related compounds in the presence of H2 and CO. The interaction of 
CeO, with other probe molecules such as 0, and NO that are frequently used 
for catalytic site characterization, is described in a subsequent section. 
1. Interaction with Hydrogen 
A large amount of information on the redox behavior of CeO, has been 
collected by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements, which 
can provide insights into low- and high-temperature interactions between H, 
and CeO,. TPR profiles have been reported for several Ce0,-containing ma- 
terials as well as metals supported on ceria, Table 1. 
The TPR of CeO, shows 
primarily two peaks, at approximately 770 K and 1100 K, indicative of the 
reduction of CeO, to Ce,O,, Fig. 2. The first, low-temperature peak (770 K) 
is due to the reduction of the most easily reducible surface capping oxygen 
of CeO,, while removal of bulk oxygen was suggested as the cause of the 
high-temperature signal at 1100 K [24]. Similar correlations were later also 
found by Johnson and Mooi [25], who developed a simple model to calculate 
surface areas from TPR measurements. For this model the authors assumed 
that the ceria surface is composed of adjacent oxygen ions, the number of 
which can easily be calculated for cubic particles. Assuming that the reduc- 
tion of the cerium corresponds to the elimination of one fourth of the surface 
oxygen ions, the value of H, consumption can be calculated and related to 
the surface area. In developing this model, experimental data from CeO, 
samples with low surface area were employed (not larger than 27 m2/g); 
however, the model already shows less than satisfactory behavior for CeO, 
samples with surface areas greater than 13 m2/g. Similar limitations apply to 
high surface area CeO, samples [28,35,73]. More recently, a careful analysis 
of the effect of CeO, texture on TPR traces has been reported [32]. Several 
samples with different surface area were used, and a good correlation was 
found between BET surface area and H, consumption from the first peak. 
The variation between surface area and H, consumption was linear, indicating

that reduction of ceria occurs first on the surface and then progressively af- 
fects the bulk. The possible formation of intermediate phases as the origin of 
the low-temperature peak in the TPR of CeO, has also been investigated 
[38,73]. Although TPR is widely utilized to study CeO, reduction, its appli- 
cation to high surface area ceria samples has not gone uncriticized. The pres-

ence of carbonates from CO, adsorption and/or residual nitrate species can 
affect the measurement of the total H, uptake if these measurements are 
carried out using a thermoconductivity detector [28]; these problems can be 
avoided with a multiple detector system. Moreover, the presence of nitrates 
was also found to slightly affect the reductive behavior of CeO, and Rh/CeO, 
samples [30] under TPR conditions. 
X P S  analysis has also proven a powerful tool in studying the reductive 
behavior of ceria. In a first detailed study, Burroughs et al. [97] assigned the 
Ce 3d photoemission lines. This study was followed by several studies from 
both the theoretical and experimental side [47,49,98]. Albeit the reduction of 
CeO, is best studied by analyzing Ce 3d5,, and Ce 3d3,, core level spectra, 0 
1s photoemission is also a possibility [18]. In carrying out these experiments 
great care must be taken to avoid introducing artifacts: reduction of ceria 
surface has been observed both under vacuum [43,99] and in the x-ray beam 
of an XPS chamber [ 
1001 through progressive elimination of hydroxyl groups 
and oxygen. The reduction of CeO, samples with varying surface areas was 
investigated by XPS, which allowed to quantify the amount of Ce(II1) formed 
at or near the surface [MI. 
The results are summarized in Fig. 3 and show 
that the higher the surface area, the better the reducibility in the medium- 
and high-temperature range (the onset of reduction at 437 K is independent 
of the BET surface area). A plateau, consistent with formation of CeOl.ss, 
is 
observed at 700 K for the high surface area samples (for comparison, a bulk 
composition of CeO,.,, was calculated from magnetic susceptibility measure- 
ments). The excellent agreement between the results obtained by applying 
two independent techniques indicates that there is no difference between sur- 
face and bulk reduction when CeO, is isothermally treated with H, at 700 K.

Thus, a kinetic model for ceria reduction comprising four main steps can be 
proposed, Fig. 4 
[57]: 
Dissociation of chemisorbed H, to form hydroxyl groups 
Formation of anionic vacancies and reduction of neighboring cations 
Desorption of water by recombination of hydrogen and hydroxyl 
groups 
Diffusion of surface anionic vacancies into the bulk material

The first part of the kinetic agrees well with a model in which a surface 
step is rate limiting; the influence of the surface area on the kinetics is well 
established. Consequently, the initial progress of reduction is highly sensitive 
to the surface area of the sample and it is only when all surface sites are 
fully reduced that bulk reduction begins, favored by the high mobility of 
oxygen into the CeO, lattice [101-1031. Treating CeO, with hydrogen leads 
to the formation of hydroxyl groups as is apparent from FT-IR measurements.

The intensity of those v(0H) bands increases with increasing reduction tem- 
perature [18,23,104] up to 673 K. At even higher temperature these bands 
eventually disappear due to the thermally induced desorption of water. In 
accordance with this pathway, the reduction process would be associated with 
the creation of oxygen vacancies (step 2) whereas the first step, leading to 
dissociative chemisorption of H,, would not imply its reduction. However, as 
described in depth by Bernal and coworkers [48,70,99], reduction of ceria 
does not necessarily involve formation of oxygen vacancies in its first stage. 
A strong component of reversible Ce'"-Ce"' 
reduction has been observed on 
ceria and Rh/CeO, samples reduced with H2; the reduction in this first step 
is not accompanied by formation of oxygen vacancies, and easy reoxidation 
is accomplished just by outgassing. In agreement with these observation, for- 
mation of Ce3+ 
(step l', Fig. 4) would be required following dissociation of 
H, onto ceria surface [105]. 
An alternative pathway for ceria reduction has been put forth by Fierro 
et al. [43] and Cunningham et al. [44], and involves formation of ceria 
bronzes as intermediates: 
CeO, + x/2 
H, - 
CeO,H, 
CeO,H, - 
CeO,-, + xl2 H,O 
This mechanism is the result of 'H-NMR, IR, ESR, and thermogravimetric 
studies, but has recently been argued by Bernal et al. [23]. 
They have studied 
the reduction of CeO, by TPR, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), 
and FT-IR, and concluded that H, adsorption is related to the surface area of 
ceria only, thus ruling out the possibility of extensive dissolution of H, into 
the bulk of ceria. Figure 5 shows the total amount of adsorbed H, on ceria

versus reduction temperature. The 
H2 adsorption referenced to hydrogen atoms per square nanometer of surface 
area is constant, indicating an exclusively surface process. 
Very recently, x-ray diffraction has been successfully applied to inves- 
tigate the formation of different phases upon reduction of CeO, under H, at 
moderate and high temperatures [32,60]. When ceria is reduced under H,, 
neither the hexagonal Ce,O, nor the CeO,,,, rhombohedra1 phase, as previ- 
ously reported by Bevan [106], were observed at temperatures up to 1073 K 
[60]. As a result of lattice expansion [formation of the larger Ce3+ in com- 
parison to Ce4+ 
(1.14 A vs. 0.97 A [107]) after hydrogen treatment of CeO,, 
the four main diffraction peaks [corresponding to the (111) (200) (220) (311) 
reflections typical for a face-centered cubic (fcc) cell] shift. Moreover, inclu- 
sion of H2 
in a fashion similar to that described by Fierro et al. [43] has also 
been cited as a contributing factor. Perrichon et al. [32] have analyzed the 
behavior under H2 at even higher temperatures (1273 K) and reported the 
formation of a new hexagonal Ce,O, phase. An overview of these results is 
given in Fig. 6, which shows the lattice expansion of the fluorite cell as 
measured from shifts in the XRD parameters. 
When CeO, is supported on other oxides like SO2 
or A1203, 
the reductive 
behavior, as judged form TPR analysis, is modified depending on the extent

and the nature of the interaction between the two oxides [13,24,38,64,83]. 
Although the typical features of TPR traces of CeO, are preserved, TPR traces 
of Ce0,/Al,03 exhibit some novel characteristics: (i) the shape of the TPR 
is dependent on the crystallite size of deposited CeO,; (ii) the H, uptake 
attributable to bulk oxygen removal appears only at high CeO, loading [38], 
a finding that is consistent with the presence of bulk ceria; (iii) at low CeO, 
loading, formation of CeAIO, species has been detected by XPS and Raman 
studies [38]; the low-temperature features are, therefore, assigned to the re- 
duction of surface oxygens. Also in the case of CeO,/SiO, samples, a strong 
dependence of CeO, reduction on CeO, crystallite size was observed [64]. 
By decreasing CeO, loading, a shift toward lower temperatures is observed 
for the high-temperature signal, while for the first peak, small deviations from 
the temperature of 800 K are observed. A quantitative estimate of H, con- 
sumption indicates that the lower the CeO, loading, the higher the percentage 
of CeO, reduction in the range of temperature 800-1200 K, as is evidenced 
in Fig. 7. This finding is a direct consequence of better spreading of CeO, 
onto the silica surface at low loadings and in the presence of hydrogen 
[58,64,65]. 
In a recent study, very small (1-3 nm) silica-supported ceria par- 
ticles have been prepared in a reproducible way by anchoring Ce(1v) ace- 
tylacetonate on the carrier and calcining it in oxygen [52]. However, no in- 
dication of their reduction behavior has been reported. 
The reductive behavior of CeO, can be modified by introducing Zr or Hf 
into the cubic cell of CeO,, that is, through the preparation of solid solutions 
of Ce0,-ZrO, 
[92-951 and Ce0,-HfO, [ll]. 
The introduction of smaller 
isovalent cations like Zr and Hf into the fcc cell of ceria results in a defective

fluorite structure with increased oxygen mobility. The reducibility of Ce,Zr,-, 
0, solid solutions is strongly dependent on the structure of the material; for 
example, Ce4+ 
is more readily reduced in the cubic Ce,,Zr,,O, 
with its in- 
creased oxygen mobility, Table 2. Also, a displacement of oxygens from their 
ideal positions [ 
1081, caused by high-temperature redox cycling, promotes 
oxygen mobility and thus reduction of cerium at lower temperatures [92]. An 
increase in reducibility is also seen for Ce+"/Tbf4 
in Ce-Tb-La 
solid solu- 
tions [90], for Pr in Ce-Pr mixed oxides [91], and for Ce4+ 
in Ce0,-TiO, 
mixed oxides [109]. However, in the last case, the increase in reducibility is 
due to the formation of a stable CeTiO, compound, and not due to favorable 
energetics for Ce3+ 
(than compared to Ce4+) 
in the fluorite lattice. 
Supporting noble metals on ceria or Ce0,-containing materials dramat- 
ically changes the redox behavior. The addition of only a few percent of 
noble metal is reported to effectively promote the reduction of surface oxy- 
gens only [24,29,73,76,91,110] as judged by a characteristic shift of the first 
TPR peak to lower temperatures (approx. 600 K), Fig. 8. A new peak in the 
temperature range of 350-450 K is due to the reduction of the noble metal 
[24,26,29,42]. Notably, the amount of H, consumed in this process is always 
higher than the amount required for the reduction of the metal precursor as 
reduction of surface Ce"' occurs concurrently even at this lower temperature. 
The occurrence of H, spillover [Eq. (l)] for Rh/CeO, catalysts [42] was

A secondary process which could contribute to the high H, consumption

Unusually strong and reversible H, adsorption has been observed for Ir/ 
CeO, catalyst and has been tentatively attributed to important direct and 
reverse spillover phenomena and/or to the formation of intermetallic Ir/Ce 
clusters [35]. 
Using supported Pd/Ce/Al,O, [50], Pt/Ce/Al,O, [82], and Rh/Ce/SiO, 
[64], it was also shown that the degree of reduction of surface ceria in the 
low-temperature range is dependent on the amount and the dispersion of 
supported CeO,. For CeO,/Al,O,, the presence of the metal increases the rate 
of formation of cerium aluminate CeA10, [50,82]. This synergistic effect 
between the metal and support is absent when Pt,Rh/CeO, is doped with other

rare earth elements like La and Nd [75]. This difference in behavior was 
attributed to the rare earth element induced migration of the noble metals 
into the CeO, lattice or by coverage of noble metals with a layer of rare earth 
oxides, preventing interaction of H2 with CeO,. 
2. Interaction with Carbon Monoxide 
Carbon monoxide is a powerful probe for the characterization of metal 
oxide surfaces by adsorption. Therefore, a large number of investigations 
have addressed CO-ceria interactions [ 
19,27,29,36,37,104,112-1171. The 
ability of CO to reduce ceria has been known for several years [116]. It was 
proposed that CO adsorption on ceria is followed by the reduction of surface 
oxygens of CeO, with formation of oxygen vacancies [112,113]: 
co + * == CO& 
CO,& + 02- 
== co, + 0,- 
Carbon monoxide is a better reducing agent than H, for ceria [19]; in 
the presence of CO, reduction readily occurs at room temperature and stoi- 
chiometries close to CeO, 86 are observed at 673 K (at 573 K, CeO, 94 [112]). 
The reduction of CeO, by CO is strongly sensitive to the textural and mor- 
phological properties of the sample; generally, the more perfect the CeO, 
lattice, the more difficult it is to reduce, as evidenced by CO-TPR with mon- 
itoring of CO, evolution [27]. The use of TPR performed with CO diluted in 
He has the advantage, compared with classical TPR, that CO does not diffuse 
into the bulk of particles; thus reduction occurs via a chemical pump effect, 
causing oxygen diffusion up to the surface and consequent elimination with 
formation of oxygen vacancies [118]. Just as the reduction is dependent on 
the nature of the surface, so is the adsorption of CO. Several adsorbed species, 
Table 3, are detectable depending on the exact experimental conditions. In 
general, CO adsorption on a fully dehydroxylated, oxidized, clean CeO, sur- 
face yields, at room temperature, linear adsorbed CO, carbonates, and car- 
boxylates [36,114]. The latter two products are afforded by oxidation of CO 
and concurrent reduction of surface Ce atoms. Hydroxyl groups hinder CO 
adsorption, especially at low temperatures. Formation of carbonates or car- 
boxylates is, due to the lack of appropriate surface oxygens, also strongly 
inhibited when using partially reduced ceria [104], while linear CO is more 
strongly adsorbed on Ce3+ 
ions generated after reduction, probably due to a 
slight retrodonation from Ce3+ 
to CO [36]. Great care should be used to avoid 
interference from adsorbed carbonates which are present on ceria before treat- 
ments. To obtain a ceria surface free from contaminants requires a pretreat- 
ment in oxygen at temperatures > 1000 K to burn out surface hydrocarbon 
impurities and occluded CO before outgassing at T > 1000 K to remove 
carbonates [36]. If ceria samples are reduced with CO or evacuated at high 
temperature prior to CO admission, formation of carbonite, CO;-, has been 
reported [37] while a reductive pretreatment of ceria with hydrogen affords

imply that (i) CO disproportionates to C and CO, or (ii) carbonates are formed 
by the bulk or subsurface reduction of ceria. While the second process is

more likely at higher temperatures where oxygen mobility is high, the dis- 
proportionation of CO to give C and CO, on ceria at low temperature has 
precedent, see Ref. 115. 
B. Adsorption of 
Other Probe Molecules 
1. Adsorption o

Oxygen 
The identification and characterization of oxygen species formed by 0, 
adsorption on ceria surfaces is of great importance as these species are key 
intermediates in many oxidation reactions. Following 0, 
adsorption, 0, (su- 
peroxide) has been detected on CeO,, CeO,/SiO,, CeO,/Al,O,, Rh/CeO,, and 
Pd/CeO,/Al,O, [43,45,120-1241. In the latter case, stabilization of 0, 
species 
by interaction with Pd‚Äù was also observed, which is responsible for the 
diversity in the behavior of CeO,/Al,O, and Pd/CeO,/Al,O,: while reductive 
pretreatment is necessary to induce 0, formation on metal-free samples, 
such treatment proved detrimental for Pd-containing samples because Pd‚Äù is 
reduced to Pd metal with subsequent loss of stabilization. The presence of 
rhodium was found to lower the temperature of 0, formation and to facilitate 
the creation of oxygen vacancies, although it is likely that some adsorption 
sites are physically blocked by the metal [45]. There is no obvious correlation 
between reductive treatment (accomplished either by outgassing at high tem- 
peratures or by treatment under H,) and the kind of adsorbed oxygen that 
result [121,122,125]. Three different 0; species with three different coordi- 
nation arrangements on Ce sites have been observed. Only one of these was 
sensitive to the presence of oxygen vacancies and has been tentatively iden- 
tified as end-on coordinated 0; [121]. Scheme 1 shows a simplified model 
of oxygen species on ceria surfaces as side-on coordinated 0; (A) and end- 
on coordinated 0; (B). 0, adsorption on ceria samples outgassed at temper- 
atures L 473 K produces 0; radicals, the concentration and the nature of 
which is temperature dependent. This observation can be explained by the 
formation of new kinds of defects at different exposed crystal planes in ac- 
cordance with theoretical predictions [ 
1261; alternatively, new types of ad- 
sorption sites formed by accumulation or association of oxygen vacancies can 
explain the high concentration of 0, under these conditions [122]. A second 
kind of 0, adsorbed species has been identified by infrared spectroscopy as 
0;- 
(peroxide) [125]. Both superoxide and peroxides are intermediates in the 
general process of 0, dissociation, leading to the incorporation of gas-phase 
0, into lattice oxygen:

Although 0;- peroxides are formed following 0, adsorption over re- 
duced ceria, they have not been identified as active species in the exchange

2. NO Adsorption 
The effect of NO adsorption on pure CeO, has recently been studied by 
Martinez-Arias et al. [128]. Ceria lattice vacancies provide suitable sites for 
NO adsorption and its further reaction to give N,O. A proposed reaction 
mechanism for NO adsorption and decomposition is shown in Scheme 2. 
Treating a sample of outgassed ceria with NO at 77 K results in the adsorption 
of NO, its intensity being proportional to the evacuation temperature. Upon 
heating the sample at room temperature, NO reacts with CeO, [Scheme 2, 
Eqs. (1) and (2)] to give nitrites (detected by IR) and NO-. NO- undergoes 
dimerization to yield hyponitrites, which then decompose to N20. N,O for- 
mation has been also detected by reacting NO over CeO, in a flow reactor; 
formation of N, was not detected under the same conditions (outgassing at 
773 K, reaction at 323 K). In the case of CeO,/Al,O,, nitrites and hyponitrites 
are also observed following NO adsorption [129]; however, N,O is formed 
in smaller amount than for CeO,. This has been attributed to a lower con- 
centration of associated vacancies on dispersed ceria in comparison to pure 
CeO,, where a large number of vacancies are more easily generated. Nitrogen 
formation following NO adsorption over metal-loaded Ce0,-containing cat- 
alyst following reductive treatment has been reported. Over M/CeO,/Al,O, 
[130] and M/CeO,/ZrO, [94], NO decomposition occurs at a reduced M-

profile of adsorbed NO shows only N2 
that desorbs at much lower temperature 
in the presence of CeO, than in Ce0,-free samples, Fig. 10 [131]. Reoxidation 
of a reduced Rh/CeO, catalyst with NO produces N, as a main product and 
a smaller amount of N,O. Complete reoxidation of both CeO, and Rh (Table 
4) was observed even in the presence of low concentration of oxidant NO 
[53]. All these findings indicates that in the presence of ceria, the activation 
energy for NO dissociation and/or the activation energy for N, desorption is 
lowered. 
3. Adsorption and Interaction with Hydrocarbons 
The adsorption and interaction of hydrocarbons (HC) with metal oxides 
have received much attention in the last years since most of the catalytic 
processes involve hydrocarbons. HC adsorption and reaction with ceria and 
Ce0,-containing materials are important especially in catalytic oxidation pro- 
cesses and in automotive emission control, and therefore most of the studies 
of interactions between ceria and hydrocarbons are aimed at the understand- 
ing of the catalytic behavior. A detailed study of adsorption and interaction 
of hydrocarbons with CeO, has been carried out by Li et al. [132-1341. They 
have examined the effect of thermal treatment on the adsorption and reaction 
of light hydrocarbons (especially CH,) with CeO,. On the basis of infrared

measurements [133], the formation of methane adsorbed on two different sites 
of ceria has been proposed, as shown in Scheme 3. The activation of methane 
occurs through a surface-active oxygen species, which is also in agreement 
with the fact that by coadsorbing CO there is no inhibition of methane chem- 
isorption. The two species correspond to adsorption of methane on surface 
lattice oxygen anion and on a surface coordinatively unsaturated (cus) oxy- 
gen, which can be generated by outgassing at high temperatures. The high 
electron affinity of the cus oxygen causes a stronger interaction with methane 
and other light hydrocarbons, which may lead to the activation of the C-H 
bond at low temperature and in the absence of gaseous oxygen, with for- 
mation of formates, which then evolve decomposing to surface carbonates 
and finally desorb as CO, and H20 at higher temperatures [132]. The ad- 
sorption of methane is strongly inhibited if ceria is subjected to a reduction 
treatment, due to the lack of available cus oxygen and surface oxygen species. 
Acid-base sites are also important in the adsorption and reaction of 
hydrocarbons on surface ceria. The presence of strong acid sites on ceria is

believed to be important in the activation of hydrocarbons at high tempera- 
tures [135]. The formation of an acid-base pair on sites of low coordination 
(such as that present on imperfections like steps, kinks, and corners) are 
thought to be involved in the abstraction of the H atom from the hydrocarbon, 
as shown in Scheme 4
.
 
When the acid-base pair has enough strength, it can 
break the C-H bond, resulting in the formation of CH, and Hf ions, which 
interact with the acid and base sites, respectively. According to this mecha- 
nism, carbanions, hydrocarbon radicals (which might form in the presence of 
0, by an electron transfer from CH, to 0,), 
and unsaturated hydrocarbons 
are expected to be strongly adsorbed on strong acid sites of ceria. This is 
likely to favor surface reactions with adsorbed 0
;
 and 0-, 
leading to for- 
mation of total oxidation products. 
C. Metal-Support Interactions 
Supported metals have extensively been used in heterogeneous catalysis, 
the traditional role of the support being to disperse and stabilize small metal 
particles. However, in addition to these effects, several other interactions can 
also occur at the metal-oxide interface, resulting in substantial modifications 
of the physicochemical and catalytic properties of both the oxide and the 
metal. Foger suggested an unambiguous definition of metal-support inter- 
action [136] as: 
a direct influence of the support on the chemisorption and catalytic 
properties of the metal phase either by stabilizing unusual metal 
particle structure, by changing the electronic properties due to elec- 
tron transfer processes betwen the metal particles and the support, 
or chemical bonding-compound 
formation-between 
metal and 
support. 
Thus many of the phenomena described in the previous section could equally 
well be classified as metal-support interactions; however, in this section we 
focus specifically on the interactions present in the M-CeO, system at high 
temperatures upon treatment with 0, and H,. In an effort to describe the 
effects of ceria-noble metal interactions there has been a continuous stream 
of studies since the early 1980s. For example, the stabilization of dispersed 
metal [1,20,21,50,54,82,137] as well as the formation of Ce-M alloys under 
reductive atmosphere [61,138] have all been attributed to the metal-oxide 
interactions. While substantial progress has been made in assessing the 
Downloaded by [Stanford University Libraries] at 06:18 10 July 2012 
CATALYTIC PROPERTIES OF CERTA 
459 
metal-support interaction under oxidative conditions, the description of the 
M-CeO, interaction under H, atmosphere at high temperatures is less clear 
and open to conflicting interpretations. 
1. Interactions Under Oxidizing Conditions 
Several studies have addressed the interaction of metal and CeO, follow- 
ing sample treatment at high temperature in an oxygen-containing atmosphere 
[1,21,33,39,45,50,67,82,137,139,140]. The majority of these studies focus on 
metals like Pd, Pt, and Rh for their important role in automotive exhaust 
catalysts. High-temperature calcination of Pt/CeO, results in the formation of 
‚ÄúPt-O‚Äù 
species on the ceria surface [39,82,114,137], with concomitant sta- 
bilization of Pt toward dispersion [21,137]. However, high Pt content and 
prolonged heating at temperature of 1000 K promotes rapid sintering of the 
M-0 complexes, as detected by chemisorption measurements and x-ray pow- 
der diffraction [29]. The formation of Pt-0-Ce 
bonds following high-tem- 
perature treatment under oxygen has recently been detected spectroscopically 
[39,137]. Raman spectroscopy can be employed to assess the effect of calci- 
nation on Pt/CeO, samples of varying Pt content [137]; a band at ca. 700 cm-‚Äô 
was identified with an oxidized Pt-0 complex bound to the ceria surface. 
Raman bands due to M-0 complex formation have also been detected for 
other noble metals showing that formation of an Mf - CeO, oxidized metal is 
a much more general phenomenon. Similar conclusions were also reached by 
Brogan et al. [39], who identified two strong bands, at 550 cm-‚Äô and 690 cm-‚Äô, 
with asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of a Pt-0-Ce 
bond. 
Strong interaction of Pt with ceria is also observed when CeO, is supported 
on A1203 
[82]; at 1173 K formation of PtZf is observed on the surface of 
Pt/CeO,/Al,O,. The platinum interacts preferentially with CeO, [39,82] in a 
fashion similar to that of Rh in Rh/CeO,/SiO, [64]. In some cases selective 
migration of the metal over Ce0,-rich areas during catalyst preparation was 
observed [64,83]. High-temperature migration of Pt from a Pt/A1203 
to CeO,/ 
Al,03 was also reported for a physical mixture of the two catalysts under 
oxidizing conditions [141]. This migration had the effect of increasing the 
catalytic activity in CO oxidation through the formation of a dispersed Pt phase 
on CeO,. Platinum also facilitates the bulk oxidation of CeAlO,/AI,O, to 
CeO,/Al,O, and the reduction of CeO,/Al,O, to CeAlO,/Al,O,. A similar be- 
havior characterizes Pd/CeO, and Pd/CeO,/Al,O, [50], 
in which ceria aids the 
oxidation of Pd to Pd oxide. Analogously, palladium also assists in the for- 
mation of bulk CeAlO, from CeO,/Al,O, and its oxidation at elevated tem- 
peratures. These interactions are believed to involve reactive 0, species which 
were previously identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) mea- 
surements on CeO, surfaces [120]. The presence of a complex of the type 
shown is conceivable [50], which is similar to what has been proposed with 
Pt [39,137] and Rh [33]:

The interaction of ceria and Rh under oxygen has also been investigated 
[33,45,67,139,140], and Rh'-0-Ce 
and [Rh-O2I2' 
species have been 
postulated. Treatment of Rh/CeO, in air at high temperatures yields Rh203 
oxide [53,139,140]. TEM studies indicate that this oxidation is accompanied 
by a slight sintering at higher temperatures. In accordance with theoretical 
predictions [142,143], calcination of a Rh/CeO, catalyst leads also to the 
incorporation of Rh ions into the CeO, lattice [45]. 
Summarizing the results on the oxidative behavior of M-CeO, catalysts, 
it is possible to highlight some commonalities resulting from high-tempera- 
ture interactions between the metal and the support: 
High-temperature treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere results in the 
formation of M-0 
surface complexes. 
These complexes show an improved degree of metal dispersion; 
however, cyclic redox aging conditions result in complete degrada- 
tion of surface complexes by sintering or agglomeration [137]. 
Ceria (including Ce02/A1203) 
promotes the oxidation of metal to 
M-0. 
In multicomponent oxidic mixtures (e.g., CeO,/Al,O,), in- 
teractions are preferentially formed between the metal and ceria. 
2. Interactions Under Reducing Conditions 
Metal-support interactions under reducing conditions and their rele- 
vance to catalysis have been widely investigated following the discovery 
[ 
1441 of the so-called strong metal-support interactions (SMSI). The occur- 
rence of SMSI in M/TiO, and M/Nb,O, is now well established. Following 
high-temperature reduction, partially reduced oxide-support species are able 
to migrate through the metal particle to cover the particles surface, thereby 
blocking sites for H, and CO adsorption and catalysis [145]. It is generally 
recognized that the reducibility of the oxide is one of the main factors in 
determining SMSI and related effects. As ceria is rather easily reduced, sev- 
eral studies have targeted the mechanisms of SMSI interactions in ceria-based 
system. Among the metals that have been thoroughly investigated are Pt 
[22,61,151-1541, Ni [54,72,79], Ir [35,155,156], and Ru [76]. Despite this 
rather large number of investigations, a clear and definitive picture of M- 
CeO, interactions is still not forthcoming, In some cases the behavior has 
been described as a classical SMSI [42,44,79,148,152,154,155]; 
in other cases 
different interpretations have been proposed [26,61-63,68,72,138,149,150].

These uncertainties are related to the difficulty inherent in applying conven- 
tional chemisorption techniques to ceria supported metals. Although uptake 
measurements are generally used to ascertain the onset of a SMSI in M/oxide 
systems, it is clearly evident from the literature that H, and CO chemisorption 
alone are not sufficient to establish its occurrence in M/CeO, catalysts 
[20,26,44,48,63,67,150,156,157]. Not only can ceria chemisorb large amounts 
of H, [23,43,44] and CO [19,26,44,114], but this adsorption is also influenced 
by the textural properties [lo41 and the pretreatment conditions [19,71,104]. 
As mentioned earlier, hydrogen spillover contributes to H, uptake in a way 
that is difficult to quantify [71]. Residual anionic species (e.g., chlorides from 
the metal precursor) add to the complexity of the system: the exact nature of 
the metal precursor (e.g., nitrates, chlorides) may profoundly affect the re- 
ductive properties of supported metals such as Rh [73,139], Pt [73], and Pd 
[47,61,77], by forming cerium oxychloride CeOCl [61], by substituting C1- 
for lattice oxygen [139], or by stabilizing cerium in a lower oxidation state 
[47]. Thus, H/M or CO/M values are rather scattered and often larger than 
unity, Table 5. As reduction at high temperature generally does not induce 
suppression of hydrogen chemisorption measured in conventional way (cf. 
Ref. 48 for known exceptions), a number of indirect techniques have been 
applied: H2 uptake at low temperatures [63,71], NMR techniques [42,44], 
quantitative measurements of v(C0) frequencies following CO adsorption 
[20,35,152], HRTEM analysis [62,67,140], and catalytic studies using probe 
reactions like hydrogenation and hydrogenoly 
sis [26,61,138,149,150]. 
Meriaudeau et al. [138] were able to show that the nature of metal- 
support interactions in Pt/CeO, was different from that in Pt/TiO,. They pro- 
posed the formation of a Pt-Ce alloy to account for the different behavior 
with regard to H2 and CO chemisorption and catalytic activity in benzene 
hydrogenation. Mitchell and Vannice [151] have studied Pd/CeO, as a part 
of a more general study on the adsorption and catalytic behavior of Pd dis- 
persed on rare earth oxides. They did not observe either a marked decrease 
of H, and CO chemisorption on Pd/CeO, after a high-temperature reduction, 
or a strong influence on CO methanation activity. They concluded that in- 
teraction between CeO, and Pd could not be explained as a typical SMSI, 
although a partial coverage of the metal by CeO, suboxides, even at low 
reduction temperatures cannot be excluded from their investigation. Encap- 
sulation of palladium by reduced ceria occurs at reduction temperatures 
higher than 873 K. At this temperature Pd-Ce alloy formation is also detected 
[61]. Suppression of carbon monoxide uptake on Pd/CeO, is reported to occur 
after reducing at lower temperature, followed by its recovery after a reoxi- 
dation, as determined by the variation in the integrated intensity of the u(C0) 
bands [152]. This suggests that the system enters into a classical SMSI. Strong 
metal-support interaction has also been recently invoked to explain the high 
activity of a Pt/CeO, catalyst in C O N 0  reaction under fuel-rich reducing 
conditions [148]. The authors proposed a mechanism in which ceria, after 
reduction, covers the Pt metal, thus providing new active sites for CO and

NO conversion. However, no evidence for decoration of metal surface from 
reduced ceria is evident from HRTEMs of Pt/CeO, [68,149,158]. This does 
not rule out that covering only occurs under reaction conditions involving 
high temperature and slightly reducing conditions. Further studies have 
pointed to the important role of Ce3+ 
sites formed after reduction of Pt- and 
Pd-based catalyst, as those sites are at the metal-ceria interface, where ac- 
tivation of molecules like CO or CO, can take place especially when aided 
by oxygen transfer from and to the support [76,119,146]. 
H, chemisorption on Rh/CeO, is not suppressed after high-temperature 
reduction [26,63,150]. To the contrary, large values of H, uptake were gen- 
erally found (Table 5); these are probably due to H, spillover from the metal 
to the support [71]. In situ magnetic measurements show that spillover on 
Rh/CeO, leads to almost complete surface reduction [99]. Cunningham et al. 
[44] studied how different reductive treatments affect H, chemisorption on 
Rh/CeO,. They cautioned against taking the total H2 uptake on Rh/CeO, as 
a criterion for the entry of Ce0,-supported catalysts into a SMSI state and 
were able to distinguish between H, adsorbed on Rh and H, adsorbed on the 
support. It was found that after HTR, H, was mostly adsorbed on the support. 
Several test reactions were devised to study metal-support interactions on 
Rh/CeO, [26,42,44,63,150,159]. Acetone hydrogenation was strongly inhib- 
ited after reduction of Rh/CeO, at 673 K [42,44]; the activity was recovered 
only after repeated oxidation and reduction at lower temperature. The hydro- 
genation of benzene has also been recently carried out [63]; no noticeable 
changes of catalytic activity were found after reduction of the catalyst at 773 
K. These results stand in contrast to those reported for Ni/CeO, [79], Pd/ 
CeO, [61], and Ir/CeO, [156]. Several excellent studies on the interaction of 
Rh and CeO, were carried out using HRTEM [62,63,67,139]. No evidence 
for Rh encapsulation by reduced support was found in the temperature range 
surveyed [62,63]. However, prolonged heating under hydrogen at elevated 
temperatures (T > 973 K) caused partial covering of Rh from patches of 
reduced ceria [67,139]; these coverings are difficult to remove even after 
oxidation at 773 K. Partial sintering of Rh particles was also observed at 773 
K, which increased when the catalysts was reduced at 1173 K. 
Even given with this large amount of data, a clear and definitive picture 
of interaction phenomena over Rh/CeO, or, more generally, M/CeO, systems, 
is still not forthcoming. A model to accurately predict the different behavior 
of metals supported on TiO, and metals supported on fluorite-based oxides 
has been developed by Sanchez and Gasquez [143]. This model takes into 
account the differences between casserite-structured oxides (e.g., TiO,) and 
fluorite-structured such as CeO,, and is based on the interaction and diffusion 
of metal atoms into anionic 0,- vacancies or surface nests of the support. 
When applied to fluorite-structured materials such as ceria, this model ac- 
counts for experimental observations such as high metal dispersion, high 
chemisorption, and high stability toward sintering. When the same model is 
applied to TiO, it accounts for a classical SMSI. Accordingly, theoretical

calculations [ 
1421 have demonstrated that precious metal ions of Rh3+, 
Pd2+, 
and Pt2+ extensively segregate to the surface of ceria as isolated ions or 
neutral clusters, a prediction which was experimentally confirmed by Soria 
et al. for Rh/CeO, [45]. 
Hydrogenation of CO/CO2 over Rh/CeO, has been studied as a model 
reaction to elucidate the role of Rh/CeO, interactions. High-temperature re- 
duction results in a strong increase in CO, hydrogenation activity as measured 
under pulse transient conditions; in contrast, Rh/Ti02 and Rh/Nb,O, [150] 
show inhibition under otherwise identical conditions. Thus Rh-CeO, inter- 
actions cannot be adequately described by classical SMSI, but instead the 
high tendency of ceria to form bulk and surface vacancies within the stable 
fluorite structure has been put forth to account for the different behavior of 
the supports. 
3. Metal-Ceria Interactions i
n
 M/CeO,/Al,O, (or Si0.j Systems 
In many catalytic systems of practical interest, cerium oxide is used as 
a promoter added to high surface area materials such as Al,03 
and SiO,. It 
is therefore of interest to examine here if and how metal-ceria interactions 
are modified by the presence of a support, and specifically to understand what 
are the key factors in the promotion of M-CeO, interaction in M/CeO,/Al,O, 
(or SiO,) systems. Given the complexity of these multicomponent catalysts, 
it is difficult to focus exclusively on metal-CeO, interaction, especially when 
the extent of interaction between ceria and the support is not negligible. In 
particular, the degree of interaction between CeO, and Al,O, or SiO, is in- 
fluenced by several variables, such as the dispersion and the loading of ceria, 
and the nature and the extent of thermal treatments. On silica, formation of 
Ce,Si,O, by treating a Rh/CeO,/SiO, sample under hydrogen up to 800¬∞C 
has been detected by HRTEM [65]. 
In this case the presence of the metal 
facilitates the nucleation and growth of the silicate. High-temperature hydro- 
gen treatment also promotes the spreading of CeO, onto the silica surface, a 
process accelerated by the presence of the metal [58,64-661. It is observed 
that highly dispersed ceria forms CeAlO, on Al,O, by treating in a reducing 
atmosphere at high temperature [50,82], a reaction that can be promoted by 
the presence of a noble metal like Pt and Pd, or even totally suppressed as 
in the case of CeO,/Al,O, prepared by coprecipitation [13]. In this case very 
small crystallites of CeO, (3.4 nm), under reducing atmosphere, transform to 
CeO,-, without any relevant interaction with Al,O,. Similarly, CeO, micro- 
domains (1 
- 
10 nm) within an Al,O, host structure prepared by coprecipita- 
tion through A
l
 and Ce gels, are reported to be more stable than supported 
ceria phases under severe thermal conditions [160]. The introduction of noble 
metal in these oxides adds to the complexity of the system; the way metal 
and ceria are added to the support can heavily affect the nature and the degree 
of metal-ceria interaction. Generally these catalysts are prepared by succes- 
sive incipient wetness impregnation of the support with cerium and precious 
metals (by using either nitrates or chloride salts) followed by drying and

calcination. A modification of the preparation procedure-for 
example, by 
coimpregnating the metal and ceria on the support-can 
induce a stronger 
degree of metal-ceria interaction. The reduction behavior of a Pd-CeOJ 
Al,03 
prepared by coimpregnating Pd and cerium differs from that of a Pd/ 
CeO,/Al,O, prepared by conventional successive impregnation of CeO, and 
Pd [85]. In the first case, an appreciable degree of reduction is already ob- 
served at room temperature as a consequence of an enhanced Pd-ceria in- 
teraction, probably facilitated by a higher degree of Pd-ceria contact area, 
which influences their low-temperature redox activity. A similar low-temper- 
ature reduction is observed also on a Pt/CeO,/Al,O, [21] and a Pt,Rh/CeO, 
[83,148] catalyst prepared by a conventional impregnation method. However, 
in these cases a reductive thermal treatment is necessary to induce such in- 
teraction. It can be speculated that the simultaneous impregnation of metal 
and ceria could have induced a segregation of the metal within the CeO, 
lattice and surface defects, thus promoting the redox synergism between the 
two components. The effect of preparation procedure has been recently ad- 
dressed in the study of the preparation of a bimetallic Pt-Rh/CeO,/Al,O, 
catalyst [86,87], in which Pt and Rh have been added by a method of suc- 
cessive impregnation with a reduction step at 500¬∞C after Pt impregnation. It 
is suggested that reduced cerium, which is present after the first impregnation 
step, is necessary to selectively deposit rhodium on the ceria surface, avoiding 
formation of Pt-Rh alloy. This is reported to occur through a redox reaction 
of Rh3' with Ce3+ 
in the course of the preparation, which would avoid ex- 
tensive Pt-Rh contact; as a result, this preparation method produces a more 
active oxidation catalyst. 
While valuable insights can be gained from these studies, it is sometimes 
impossible to account satisfactory for M-CeO, interactions in these systems, 
owing to the mutual influences of the various components of the fully for- 
mulated catalysts. However, despite the complicated nature of these multi- 
component catalysts, there are some important factors that should be under- 
lined in the assessment of metal-ceria interactions in these systems. 
1. The interaction between the metal and ceria is generally promoted by 
a reducing pretreatment [21,83,84,130,149,161,162] 
and is reversed by treat- 
ing at high temperature in an oxidizing atmosphere. The treatment in a re- 
ducing environment causes an enhancement of the redox reactions on ceria, 
facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies, stabilized by electron transfer 
with the metal. This is also supported by thermodynamic consideration on 
the redox potentials (Pd2+/Pdo 
= 0.951 eV, Rh3'/Rho = 0.758 eV, Pt2'/Pto = 
1.118 eV, Ce4+/Ce3+ 
= 1.61 eV) that supposes an electronic transfer from the 
metal to cerium. These results have been recently interpreted within the junc- 
tion effect theory [148,161,163], which postulates that the nature of metal- 
ceria interaction involves metal promotion of the oxide by enhancement of 
the equilibrium concentration of oxygen vacancies. Several other explanations 
have been proposed, like the decoration of the metal by reduced ceria in the

CATALYTIC PROPERTIES OF CERIA 
467 
case of Pd/CeO,/SiO, [164] or the formation of cerium hydrides particles 
covering the metal in Pt and Rh/Ce/SiO, [66]. 
2. It is important to control to some extent the metal-CeO, contact 
perimeter [147], which can be done by increasing either the metal dispersion 
or the dispersion of CeO, on the support. For a higher degree of metal-CeO, 
interaction, supports with the smallest CeO, size are required. In this case 
under a reductive atmosphere a synergetic effect results in an improved re- 
ducibility of both the metal and CeO, at lower temperature [64,83]. In ad- 
dition, the presence of chloride ions, residual from the catalyst preparation, 
enhances the stability of cerium in a low oxidation state with the formation 
of oxychloride CeOCl [47]. The sites located at the interface seem to be 
particularly effective in the promotion of activity in CO oxidation under 
slightly oxidizing or stoichiometric conditions. A disadvantage is that CeO, 
also promotes the easy oxidation of finely divided metals like Pt, Pd, and Rh 
in an oxidizing environment, giving metal-oxygen surface complexes which 
are less active than the reduced metals. Catalyst aging at high temperature 
can have a detrimental effect on this synergetic metal-ceria interaction by 
partly reoxidizing the metal and reduced ceria, and by favoring the loss of 
noble metal surface area as well as sintering of the ceria in the catalyst [162]. 
Also, the presence of oxygen vacancies can facilitate the migration of a part 
of the reduced metal into CeO, lattice [142,143]. Thus, doping of a Pt/ 
CeO,/AI,O, catalyst with La, Y, and Nd (which increases the number of 
available vacancies) causes a severe loss of metal-ceria interaction after pro- 
longed aging at high temperature, while its treatment under less severe con- 
ditions results in a beneficial effect on performance [165]. 
3. If on one hand, dispersed ceria results in an enhanced metal-CeO, 
interaction, on the other hand, it has been shown that three-dimensional, large 
CeO, particles are more effective in generating vacancy sites, which may 
result in a higher ability to activate molecules like CO [130], NO [129], and 
CO, [64]. Moreover, the presence of bulk ceria is much more effective in 
storing oxygen and supplying it to the metal particles [166]. 
Summarizing, it seems that a high degree of metal-ceria interaction is 
reached with an accurate balance of two different tendencies: one that is 
focused on the increase of the metal-ceria contact perimeter and another that 
is aimed at the formation of highly reactive oxygen vacancies on the ceria 
crystallites. 
111. CATALYTIC STUDIES 
Although the most widespread application of CeO, in catalysis is in the 
catalytic converters in automobiles for exhaust treatment, several other studies 
concerning the use of ceria and Ce0,-containing materials in catalysis have 
appeared in the last years, Table 6. Ceria can be used as support for transition 
metals, or alternatively, ceria itself can be supported and dispersed on oxides 
like alumina and silica. Applications in which ceria is used alone or in com-

bination with other elements to give mixed-oxide formulations, have also 
been reported. The most relevant features of ceria in term of its catalytic 
properties are the lattice ion mobility and the possibility of readily switching 
between Ce(II1) and Ce(IV), together with the high oxidizing power of the 
Ce(1V) cation. The following section addresses various uses of ceria in ca- 
talysis. Although several features which are considered are common to a 
variety of reactions, the classification by reaction types has been maintained 
to facilitate the subsequent presentation. Particular emphasis is given to stud- 
ies where the role of ceria is clearly understood and that contribute to a 
unifying view of its role in catalysis. 
A. Oxidation Reactions 
Oxidation reactions account for the majority of uses of Ce0,-containing 
materials in catalysis. The redox properties of ceria and the high lability of 
lattice oxygen are among the most important factors which contribute to the 
catalytic reactivity of CeO, in oxidation reactions. Albeit ceria has proven its 
worth in total oxidation reaction, its ability to catalyze selective or partial 
oxidations is very poor. However, the catalytic behavior of CeO, can be 
modified by addition of dopants or incorporation of different elements into 
the lattice. This in turn allows for ‚Äúfine tuning‚Äù of the catalyst and even 
opens reaction pathways that can lead to partial oxidation products. Generally, 
the best catalysts are multicomponent systems comprising ceria and a metal 
dopant; in such catalyst systems, ceria provides for the unique capability of 
promoting oxidation reactions. 
1. Carbon Monoxide Oxidation 
The ability of either pure ceria or ceria modified by additives to catalyze 
the oxidation of carbon monoxide is very well known. Rienacker et al., in 
their pioneering studies, found that pure CeO, and CeO, mixed with N,O, 
[266], with Tho, [267], and with La,O, [176] are effective catalysts for CO 
oxidation in the range of temperatures 200‚Äù-300¬∞C. Although the activity of 
ceria was not comparable to that of other oxides like CuO, the studies first 
envisaged the possible participation of lattice oxygen from ceria in the cat- 
alytic process. These findings were later confirmed by several authors from 
both the experimental [112,113,130,146,173] and the theoretical point of view 
[126,143,167]. In the absence of noble metals, it is generally found that the 
reaction order is zero, or nearly zero, in 0, pressure [112,179], while the 
dependence on CO is much more complex; the reaction order varies from 
one, at low Pco, to zero for higher CO pressures [179]. Moreover, CO ad- 
sorption on pure ceria is always accompanied by a reduction of the solid 
[19,112,116]. Recently, computer simulation techniques have been used to 
study the effect of surface structures and energetics in the oxidation of CO 
over pure ceria [167]; it was shown that CO oxidation using oxygen from 
ceria is favored at the (110) and (310) surfaces, with easy formation of ox-

ygen vacancies, while it is less favored when oxygen from the bulk is used; 
hence any conditions which aid the formation of these planes is expected to 
enhance CO oxidation activity. 
The addition of some elements to CeO, dramatically modifies its be- 
havior in the oxidation of CO [8,177,179]. A careful analysis of CO oxidation 
activity on Ce0,-based composites has shown that the introduction of CuO 
into CeO, strongly promotes CO oxidation activity, lowering the light-off 
temperature by more than 200¬∞C [S]. Copper is the best promoter, while 
introduction of Sr, Sc, Gd, and La had little or no effect on CO oxidation 
activity. It is worth mentioning that copper-based catalysts show an activity 
which is better than that of the best literature oxide catalyst and is comparable 
to that of Pt/Al,O, under the same conditions, Table 7. The authors attributed 
these results to the presence of small dispersed copper clusters stabilized by 
interaction with ceria. They proposed a mechanism in which CO is activated 
on Cu, while 0, is activated as superoxide 0; on the CeO, surface 
[121,124,125] and then transferred to CO. A similar mechanism was pro- 
posed also to explain the excellent CO oxidation activity of a 5% Au-con- 
taining Au-Ce-0 
composite [179]. Promotion of CO oxidation activity is 
found also when ceria is added to a precious metal (PM)/Al,O, catalyst 
[1,84,124,130,173,174] or when bulk ceria is used as a support for, or is in 
contact with, noble metals like Pt [171,172]. Addition of ceria to a PM/Al,O, 
catalyst results in a decrease of the apparent activation energy by several 
kilocalories/mole (from a value of ca. 25-30 kcal/mol typical of a supported 
noble metal, to a value of ca. 17-22 kcal/mol for PM/CeO,/Al,O, [130, 
173,1741 
or for a ceria-containing commercial automotive catalyst [ 
1621). 
The 
decrease of activation energy observed in the presence of CeO, is generally 
accompanied by a decrease in the sensitivity of the rate to gas-phase 0, 
concentration and, at high CeO, loading, to a suppression of CO inhibition 
effect. The extent to which the CeO, additive affects the CO oxidation ki- 
netics depends strongly on the pretreatment conditions 1162,1731, on CeO, 
loading, and on the stoichiometric conditions employed [ 
130,1741, Fig. 11. 
For large excess of 0, (O,/CO > 5) the activity is not affected by the presence 
of Ce, while near stoichiometric conditions, the presence of Ce does affect 
the reaction kinetics. This behavior is generally attributed to a change in the 
reaction mechanism due to the presence of ceria. Under strongly oxidizing 
conditions, activation of both CO and 0, occurs on the metal with a classical 
Langmuir-Hinselwood kinetic, while at lower 0, 
pressure, CO oxidation rate 
over Ce0,-based catalysts is enhanced by a pathway involving surface re- 
action at the M/CeO, interface between CO adsorbed onto the metal and 
oxygen derived from ceria [21,130,146,171,173]. The very high activity of a 
prereduced Pt-CeO,/Al,O, 
sample has been attributed to Pto-CeO, sites lo- 
calized at the Pt-CeO, interface: the key point was the possibility of initiating 
the reaction by the oxidation of CO adsorbed on Pt due to the ‚Äúoxide‚Äù 
oxygen from neighboring ceria, in a fashion similar to that described by Jin 
et al. [146], on pure Pt/CeO,. Interestingly, a mechanism involving oxygen

migration form ceria to Rh particles is considered to be the main source of 
oxygen for CO oxidation over Rh/CeO, at high CO coverages, when 0, 
adsorption from the gas phase is strongly inhibited [268]. Some authors evi- 
denced the important role of superoxide species in activating CO toward 
oxidation over Pd-, Cu-, Au-, and Ag-containing CeO,/Al,O, 
catalysts 
[ 
124,2691; they attributed the increased capacity of these catalysts in activat- 
ing CO to a metal-semiconductor interaction, which enhances electron mo- 
bility between the metal (that plays the role of an electron reservoir) and 
CeO,. Summarizing, CO oxidation on ceria-containing catalysts can be rep- 
resented by the two simplified reaction mechanisms depicted in Fig. 12, in 
which two 
reaction pathways are represented. In the first case, adsorbed CO 
reacts with an active surface oxygen provided by ceria (in this case the su- 
peroxide ion 0; is represented, which is considered to be an active inter-

mediate in this reaction), while the second path involves alternative reduction 
and oxidation of the ceria surface with formation of double-charged oxygen 
vacancies and their successive replenishment by gas-phase oxygen. In the 
presence of the metal, it is likely that the CO adsorption step occurs on the 
metal particles with activation of 0, on ceria; in the absence of a metal, CO 
adsorption ocurs on CeO, surface, but CO oxidation activity in this case is 
strongly reduced. 
2. COIN0 Reaction 
The oxidation of CO by NO represents a major pathway for the removal 
of nitrogen oxide from automobile exhaust. The overall reaction scheme for 
the C O N 0  reaction involves the three main reactions:

CO + 2N0 -

where reaction (2), which is favored at high temperature, accounts for the 
direct formation of N,. The effect of added ceria on CO and NO conversion 
by Rh/Al,03 or SiO, [130,131,219,220-222,2711, Pt/Al,O, [1,83,131,149, 
2721, Pd/Al,03 [1,50], and Pt-Rh/Al,O, [83,173,272,273], has been studied 
in depth. TPD studies on PM/CeO,/Al,O, [131,219,273] show that CeO, pro- 
motes NO desorption as N, at much lower temperature than ceria free samples 
(compare Fig. 10). The formation of N2 following NO adsorption implies 
reoxidation of ceria by oxygen from NO. Reoxidized ceria, due to the lack 
of available Ce3+ 
sites, is much less effective in promoting NO dissociation, 
as evidenced from repeated TPD runs, which show a shift of the N2 peak to 
higher temperatures [ 
1311. TPD experiments on CeO,/Al,O, without precious 
metal showed no appreciable desorption of nitrogen-containing species, sug- 
gesting that Ce-induced changes in the N, desorption profile are probably 
correlated to interaction between the metal and the ceria surface [219]. It has 
been proposed that NO adsorbs near the perimeter of ceria islands in such a 
fashion that the nitrogen end of the molecule is attached to the Rh, and the 
oxygen end to an oxygen-deficient cerium species, thus weakening the N-0 
bond. Similar mechanisms were also proposed to explain the effect of metal 
oxide promoters on the dissociation of CO in hydrogenation reactions 
[164,274]. It is helpful to point out here the dual effect of ceria addition on 
CO oxidation and CO/NO reaction: that is, cerium oxide aids the CO-0, 
reaction with oxygen donation from CeO, to CO adsorbed on the metal, 
through the Rh-CeO, interface, while it works as an oxygen acceptor during 
the CO-NO reaction. In both cases the reaction mechanism relies on the 
important role of the metal-CeO, interface. 
The inhibiting effect of oxygen on the NO dissociation is considerably 
smaller for the ceria-containing samples; this can be attributed to oxygen 
spillover from the noble metal to the reduced ceria [273], which would de-

crease 0, adsorption on the metal, thus making available metal sites for NO 
adsorption. In agreement with these findings, the promotional effect of ceria 
in a Pt/A120, and Pt-Rh/Al,O, catalyst is much more evident for NO-CO- 
0, reaction than for CO-NO reaction, although the beneficial effect of ceria 
is visible in both reactions with a decrease of the light-off temperature (Fig. 
13) [272]. 
Addition of ceria to a Rh/Al,O, catalyst enhances NO reduction at low 
temperature by decreasing the apparent activation energy for the CO-NO 
reaction [219,222] and by shifting to positive order the rate dependence on 
NO partial pressure [219], Table 8. However, these promotional effects are 
dependent on the amount of cerium and the pretreatment conditions. While 
the addition of a few percent of ceria does not substantially alter the catalytic 
activity, catalysts containing 2 wt% or more of Ce show a significant higher 
activity [219,271]. The activity is also dependent on Rh/Ce ratio: a low Rh/ 
Ce ratio enhances the activity of Rh for this reaction [219], while catalysts

with a higher Rh/Ce ratio do not show an enhancement of activity in com- 
parison to Rh/AI,O, [222]. Moreover, they show an exceptionally low cata- 
lytic activity after heating in H,, which has been attributed to the decreased 
chemisorption ability of Rh towards NO and CO caused by a strong metal- 
support interaction. A strong but reverse effect of the pretreatment conditions 
was observed on Pt and Pd catalysts on CeO,/Al,O, support [l] and on Pt/ 
CeO, [148], in which the positive effect of ceria was evident only after a 
reductive treatment. A treatment under strong oxidizing environment or oxi- 
dation under excess 0, resulted in a decrease of activity for the ceria-con- 
taining catalysts as compared to the Ce0,-free counterpart. This detrimental 
effect of ceria was also observed in the oxidation of alkanes [173,174, 
181,1821 and has been attributed to the formation of inactive M-0 complex 
or to surface coverage with excess 0,. These findings stand in contrast with 
the beneficial effect observed in NO-CO-0, 
reaction over Pt/Al,O, pro- 
moted with ceria [272]. This difference could originate from the feed stream 
composition used: NO-CO-0,-He 
in one case [272] and a simulated ex- 
haust containing also H,O and CO, in the other [148], which might adversely 
effect the redox behavior of ceria (both supported and unsupported). The 
oxidation state and the stability of oxygen vacancies on ceria are indeed 
strongly influenced by the oxidizing power of H,O and CO, [27,162]. The 
very high activity of the prereduced Pt/CeO, has been attributed to an en- 
hanced degree of Pt-ceria interaction caused by ceria migration over the 
metal. Owing to the negligible exposed Pt surface area, the active sites are 
suggested to be reduced ceria particles covering the metal. The dual role of 
ceria can be accomplished at the same time with the oxidation of carbon 
monoxide by removal of surface oxide ions from the ceria covering, with the 
resultant oxygen vacancies acting as the active sites for nitric oxide dissoci- 
ation. The important effect of reduction of Pt and CeO, was also outlined by 
Nunan et al. [83], who studied the effect of ceria addition in the light-off

activity of TWC in a full-complement synthetic exhaust mixture. They found 
that catalysts containing ceria are very sensitive to exhaust gas environment, 
and that they can undergo facile activation in a rich gas, Since both fresh and 
lean-conditioned catalysts exhibited lower activity than rich-conditioned sam- 
ples, it appeared that fully reduced metal results in the most active state of 
the catalyst, once more indicating the role of reduced metal in contact with 
reduced ceria. 
3. Oxidation of 
Hydrocarbons 
The potential of CeO, to oxidize hydrocarbons has been known for 
several years [187,270]. Oxidation of hydrocarbons on ceria yields CO, as 
the main product, with selectivities close to 100%; only traces of partial 
oxidation products like CO are observed. Several studies have been conducted 
using methane as fuel, employing pure CeO, [8,11,132], doped CeO, [8,11, 
177,1791, or CeO, supported on Al,O, or SiO, with [181-1831 and without 
[13,184] noble metals. In the absence of precious metals, methane activation 
on CeO, has been observed at temperatures as low as 473 K [132] and is 
found to be strongly dependent on pretreatment atmosphere and temperature. 
The mechanism proposed involves activation of CH, on ceria (possibly on a 
surface coordinatively unsaturated site or on surface lattice oxygen of CeO, 
[133]) facilitated by active lattice oxygen species present. on CeO, surface. 
The role of acid-base sites cannot be excluded in promoting the activation 
of CH, by splitting of the C-H bond with formation of stabilized surface 
OH species [S]. The importance of lattice oxygen in CH,, C2H6, 
and C,H, 
oxidation over pure ceria has been clearly evidenced by Lin et al. [132,134], 
who observed that the initiation of hydrocarbon oxidation is independent on 
the presence of gaseous O,, which serves only to increase the amount of 
surface formate intermediate formed. Moreover, isotope experiments con- 
firmed that the peroxide 0;- could react with the hydrocarbons, but adsorbed 
superoxide 0, is almost inert toward hydrocarbons at temperature below 573 
K. However, at higher temperatures, 0; species participate in C,H, oxidation 
over PM/CeO,/Al,O, [175]. A strong enhancement of activity in methane 
combustion has been observed over fluorite-structured, Ce0,-based catalysts. 
Figure 14 reports the difference in the light-off temperature (T at 50% con- 
version) observed between CeO, and several Ce0,-based mixed oxides with 
the fluorite structure. The enhancement effect is attributed to the easier for- 
mation of oxygen vacancies and reduced ceria in Ce0,-MO, 
(M = Zr, Hf) 
solid solutions [ll] or to differences in acid-base properties observed by 
introduction of SrO or La,O, into CeO, lattice [S]. It should be noted also 
that CH, activation is much more sensitive than CO activation to the presence 
of dopants like Sr, La, and Sc in the CeO, lattice [S]. The presence of ceria 
in solid solution with Ago and V,O, was also found to promote selective 
oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid [189], which stands 
in sharp contrast with the completely unselective oxidation properties of CeO, 
itself observed for the same reaction. This has been explained with an in-

creased capability to donate less reactive lattice oxygen species when cerium 
atoms belongs to a Ag-V-Ce-0 
solid solution. 
The presence of noble metals has been extensively studied in the oxi- 
dation of methane [181-1831 and other hydrocarbons [50,169,174,188] over 
CeO,/Al,O, catalysts. As a general trend it is observed that introduction of 
CeO, has a detrimental effect on CO, production activity, which is most 
dramatic for Pd and Pt catalysts [50,181-1831 and less marked with Rh 
[ 
181,1821. Also, pretreatment under oxidizing or reducing conditions plays 
an important role in the final performance of the catalysts [13,182]. Generally, 
an oxidizing pretreatment is found to negatively affect the oxidation activity; 
the inverse is true for a reductive pretreatment. The reason for this behavior 
is attributed to the formation of less active Pd and Pt oxides under catalytic 
conditions or during an oxidizing pretreatment. The formation and stabiliza- 
tion of the oxidized form of the metal is promoted by interaction with ceria 
[39,50,82,137], as pointed out in a previous section. Rh is less affected by 
the presence of CeO,, which implies that the nature of metal-ceria interaction 
in Rh/CeO,/Al,O, might be different from that in Pt and Pd. Also, this dif- 
ference may be related to the fact that the water-gas shift reaction plays a 
significant role in determining the reactivity of a Rh/CeO,/Al,O, catalyst in 
comparison to a Pt-based catalyst [255,275]. An interesting application which 
uses the redox cycle of cerium oxide for the direct conversion of CH, into 
synthesis gas has been recently provided by Otsuka et al. [276]. In a two-

directly into synthesis gas with a H,/CO ratio of 2 [Eq. (5)], followed by

4. Oxidative Coupling of Methane 
Several studies have been published in the last years on the role of ceria 
and Ce0,-containing catalysts in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). 
There is a general agreement in saying that CeO, is a poor catalyst for OCM 
reaction [ 
197,200,202,205,277,2781. CeO, has the lowest C, selectivity 
among rare earth oxide catalysts at all the temperatures and CHJO, percent- 
ages [135,197,199,201,278], using either oxygen or N,O as oxidants [204], 
and also it is characterized by a very low CO/CO, ratio among the products. 
The activities and selectivities of various Ce0,-based catalysts are reported 
in Table 9. To clarify this behavior, one may focus on the two main reactions 
occurring in OCM: 
nCH, + (n - 
1/4rn)0, == C,H, + (2n - 
1/2rn)H,O 
CH, + (1 + 1/2x)O, * 
COX 
+ 2H,O 
(7) 
(8) 
There are now convincing evidences that oxidative dimerization occurs 
through the formation of methyl radicals CH,. on the catalyst surface where 
they either go into the gas phase to couple, giving the desired product [path 
(7)] or further react with some adsorbed oxygen species like O;, Of-, or 0-, 
to give complete oxidation products [path @)I. The very low activity and 
selectivity of ceria for OCM reactions is very much consistent with the ob- 
servations that methyl radicals react extensively with CeO,, leading to their 
conversion to total oxidation product like CO, [202,206], in contrast to what 
happens on other lanthanides like La,O,, Nd203, 
Sm,O,, and Eu,O, which 
react with CH,. radicals only to a smaller extent [202]. Also, the very low 
amount of CO formed, which is consistent with the combustion activity of 
ceria, is attributed to this rapid surface reaction of any CH,. radicals. The 
fast reaction of CH,. to give total oxidation products on ceria has been related 
to the presence of strong acid sites, which greatly reduces the catalyst selec- 
tivity [135]. According to this view, the radicals or the carbanion CH, pre- 
cursors are expected to be strongly adsorbed on the acid sites and likely 
undergo subsequent surface reaction with adsorbed 0 2  and 0- 
leading to the 
formation of more combustion products. Also, it was found that the presence 
of multiple stable oxidation states among rare earth oxides is not a prereq- 
uisite for activity in this reaction [202]. Although pure ceria is a very poor 
OCM catalyst, when it is modified by addition of other elements, it transforms 
from a total CH, oxidation catalyst to one that is effective in the oxidative 
coupling reaction. When CeO, is modified by addition of alkaline or alkaline

earth metals, it ceases to be a good radical scavenger and becomes an effec- 
tive catalyst for production of gas-phase CH,. radicals for coupling reactions 
[12,198,203,206,207,213]. 
Alternatively, when bulk ceria is modified by in- 
troduction of other elements into the lattice with formation of solid solutions, 
higher C, selectivities are observed which have been correlated to the 0‚Äô- 
conductivity and transport characteristics of the material [196,208,209,212, 
2151. The higher activity and selectivity observed in the presence of Na have 
been explained according to a model developed by Gaffney et al. [203] in 
which CH, is activated by Na,O,, to yield the primary product ethane and 
the oxide anion Na,O. Sodium oxide is regenerated back to Na,O, by a rapid 
change in the state of the redox couple M3+-M4+; 
the catalytic cycle is then 
completed with reoxidation of the metal by molecular oxygen. Moreover, the 
presence of a sodium-containing phase on the surface prevents CH,. radicals 
from reacting with CeO,, which would result ultimately in the formation of 
CO, [207]. In a recent study it has been found that among several Na-con- 
taining salts, Na,WO, is the most effective in enhancing the selectivity and 
C, yield of CeO, for OCM reaction [12]. Although the nature of active sites 
remains unclear, a reason for the increase in selectivity lays probably in the 
covering of CeO, by Na,WO, which diminishes the exposure of nonselective 
CeO, sites; however, from the comparison of Na,WO,/CeO, to NaWO, sup- 
ported on other oxides, it was clear that CeO, had still an active role in the 
reaction. The high activity and selectivity of Ba/CeO, (Fig. 15) has also been 
attributed to a specific interaction between Ba and Ce which prevents Ce 
from acting as a total oxidation catalyst [213]. In the case of Ce0,-containing 
solid solutions like Ce0,-CaO 
[208-2101, Ce0,-BaF, 
[212], or Ce0,- 
Yb,O, [196], the higher C, selectivity has been correlated with a variation in 
the ion conductivity of the materials due to formation of vacancies. A good 
correlation between C, selectivity and 0,- conductivity has been found by 
Zhang and Baerns with the CaO-CeO, system [208], Fig. 16; they reported 
that C, selectivity increases with increasing ion conductivity. Since 0‚Äô- min- 
imizes nonselective surface reactions [279], which might be favored by re- 
active oxygen species like O,, 0;-, 
or 0-, 
the transformation of any surface 
oxygen species into lattice oxygen (which clearly occurs on solids with highly 
mobile oxygen defects [17]), would have a positive effect on C, formation 
in the OCM reaction. A catalyst with high oxygen ion conductivity favorably 
forms a surface with a relatively small amount of weakly adsorbed oxygen 
species, transforming these weakly adsorbed oxygen into strongly bound ox- 
ygen species (02-), 
thereby reducing the nonselective surface reactions of 
methyl species and C, hydrocarbons caused by interaction with such weakly 
adsorbed oxygen species [279]. 
A few studies have also been carried out on the oxidative dehydroge- 
nation of ethane on CeO, [199] and Ce0,-containing catalysts [198,211]. The 
activity per gram and per unit surface area of CeO, is the lowest among rare 
earth oxides, although the activity for ethane oxidation is higher than that 
observed for methane oxidation, which is attributed to the ethyl (C2H5.)

peroxymethyl radicals. Kennedy and Cant investigated the effect of alkaly 
metal doping of CeO, on catalyst performance [198]. A comparison of the 
oxygen conversion and the selectivity to ethylene for pure ceria and 2%Na/ 
CeO, shows that the addition of sodium substantially improves the selectivity 
but reduces the activity, Fig. 17. This effect is attributed to sodium, which 
does not form crystalline phases but blocks the activity of the ceria surface 
for the oxidation of alkyl radicals to COX. 
5. Ammoxidation and Wet Oxidation o

 Organics 
Ce0,-based materials have been successfully used in several other oxi- 
dation reactions as reported in Table 6. Of particular relevance are the ap- 
plications in the formulation of selective ammoxidation catalysts as reported 
by the work of Bart and Giordano [223,225] and Brazdil and Grasselli 191. 
These studies pointed out the important role of cerium in the development of 
three component Te-Ce-Mo and Bi-Ce-Mo 
catalysts for ammoxidation of 
propylene to acrylonitrile. In the case of Bi-Ce-Mo, it was found that cerium 
is effective in increasing the overall activity of bismuth molybdate catalysts; 
in particular, it was found that there exist unique compositions where catalytic 
activity is maximized, which correspond to specific features in the phase

diagram, Fig. 18. A higher activity was correlated with a higher solubility of 
Ce and Bi in Bi,-,Ce,(MoO,),. 
This intimate mixing in single solid-state 
structures facilitates the action of Ce, which can aid the reoxidation and 
reconstruction of the surface active sites (i.e., Mo-Bi sites). Moreover an 
increase of the oxygen ion, electron, and anion vacancies transport in solid 
solutions contributes to the overall performances of Ce-containing catalysts 
[224]. The important role of Ce in reoxidizing molybdenum in Te-Ce-Mo 
mixed oxide ammoxidation catalyst was also pointed out [223]. 
Supported CeO, and Ce0,-based mixed oxides are effective catalysts in 
the wet oxidation of organic compounds for industrial wastewater treatment 
[ 
191,192,280,2811, or for low-temperature combustion of fats [ 
1931; their 
activity is even better than the activity of industrial copper-based catalysts in 
the removal of total organic carbon from polluted water. For comparison, 
Table 10 reports the efficiencies of Ce0,-Mn,O, 
composites in the wet ox- 
idation of various organic compounds [192]. Addition of Ce to Mn changes 
the surface manganese species from MnO, to Mn,O,, thus increasing the 
redox properties of manganese oxide catalyst. Similar action is performed by 
Ce in Co-Ce composites in the oxidation of ammonia [195]. The addition 
of MnO,/CeO, catalysts enhances also the conversion of phenol to CO, under 
catalytic supercritical conditions, promoting the oxidation pathways at the 
expense of the oligomerization pathway [281]. The presence of Ru on ceria, 
as active dispersed RuO,, was also effective in the wet oxidation of 
poly(ethy1ene glycol) or some low molecular weight compounds with a high 
oxygen content such as formaldehyde [lo], ethylene glycol, or formyc acid 
[191].

B. Hydrogenation Reactions 
1. CO-CO,/H, Reactions 
The COIH, reaction is usually carried out on metal catalysts to yield a 
wide range of hydrocarbons and oxygenate products [282]. However, in sev- 
eral investigations CeO, has been employed as pure oxide or in mixed oxide 
compositions to study CO hydrogenation. Depending on the reaction condi- 
tions (COM, ratio, temperature, and pressure), CeO, is effective as CO hy- 
drogenation catalyst giving mainly C,-C, hydrocarbons with a high selectiv- 
ity for olefins [230,247]. Methanol and other oxygenates have also been 
detected at lower temperatures, Table 1
1
 [233,283,284]. Pure CeO, was found 
efficient for the formation of branched-chain C,-C, 
hydrocarbons at 673 K 
and HJCO = 3 [230]. By varying the H,/CO ratio and lowering the temper- 
ature to 623 K, a higher selectivity in isoprene has been reported [231], which 
is enhanced by doping CeO, with other rare earth oxides, Table 12. Similarly, 
under slightly different reaction conditions, doping CeO, with In,O, resulted 
in a higher selectivity to ethene (99% of C2 
products) [247]. This was attrib- 
uted to the acceleration of formation of Ce3+ 
under reaction conditions when 
CeO, is doped with rare earth oxides (REO); Ce3+ 
is in fact recognized as 
an active site for COD‚Ç¨, reaction in the absence of the metal [247,285]. This

pendence of hydrocarbon production with Ce3' formation was detected, 
which has been tentatively attributed to the formation of methylene species 
on the surface. No oxygen products were observed by hydrogenation of ad- 
sorbed CO on partially reduced ceria; this might be well explained by the 
strong oxygen affinity of reduced ceria, that is, the strong oxygen abstraction 
ability from oxygen containing intermediates. A correlation of product dis- 
tribution with the presence of formates, which are formed by adsorption of 
CO on ceria [104,114,286], was not found [285]. 
Successive studies have 
indicated that either p-methylene (CH, c M2) and carbene (H2C 
= M) species 
(derived from q2-formaldehyde) could be the common precursors to explain 
the high selectivity for ethene and higher olefins [233]: the first is formed 
through coupling of either carbene or methylene species, while the second 
products are formed through CO insertion into a methylene or carbene and 
successive reaction with hydrides to give acyl species as intermediates for 
higher olefins formation. 
The introduction of water in the Cob‚Ç¨, reaction mixture changes the 
product composition in favor of ketones and secondary alcohols, in both CeO, 
and ceria doped with RE0 [234], although CO,, formed by the water-gas 
shift reaction, remains the major product, Table 13. The formation of CO, 
from disproportionation of CO has also been investigated over pure ceria 
[115], where it was found that, even at low temperatures, CO disproportion- 
ates over reduced ceria according to the following redox cycle:

reported. Selectivities up to 55% in C, hydrocarbons (with >90% isobutene) 
are obtained with CoO-CeO,-ZrO, 
at a very low conversion of CO (0.14%) 
[246], while a 7%Ce-ZrO2 catalyst showed a 30.7% selectivity in C, hydro- 
carbons (with >63% isobutene) at 13% conversion [244]. 
The activity and selectivity of CeO, in the hydrogenation of CO can be 
strongly modified by introduction of a metal. Several studies have been car- 
ried out on Pd and Rh supported on CeO, [77,151,236-2381. Generally a 
high selectivity to methanol and ethanol formation is observed on these cat- 
alysts; the explanation of such a selectivity involves the activation of CO on 
an oxygen vacancy of the CeO, lattice at the interface of the metal and the 
support, providing a site suitable for a chain growth [77,238]. Methanol and 
higher alcohol selectivity on Pd/CeO, is influenced by the presence of dopants 
like Li [245] or by the presence of other metals or reaction additives [242]. 
Particularly Li is effective in enhancing selectivity towards oxygenates. This 
enhancement can be ascribed either to an interaction of the dopant with the 
oxygen end of the CO molecule or to a decreased reducibility of the metal 
caused by the promoter. With the aid of TPD, chemisorption, and FT-IR 
studies the authors have proposed a mechanism for ethanol and methane 
formation on Pd-LVCeO,, which is shown in Scheme 5. The interaction of 
CO adsorbed on Pt with lithium favors the formation of formyl species sta- 
bilized by the presence of Li; the formyl species can then be hydrogenated 
to CH,OH or undergo a C-0 bond rupture forming CH, species that are 
either hydrogenated to methane or react with another adsorbed CO or formyl 
species to give ethanol [245]. Turnover frequencies showed that Pd/CeO, is 
the most active for methane formation at low pressure among rare earth ox- 
ides [236]; this was attributed to a redox cycle associated with a change in 
valence of the Ce cation from 3 to 4. These active sites are presumed to exist 
mainly at the metal-support interface, where reduction occurs easily due to 
spillover from the nearby metal. 
Rh-CeO, interaction is also effective in enhancing selectivity toward 
oxygenates [228,238,239]. The addition of a low concentration of cerium

oxide considerably lowers hydrocarbon formation without changes in the total 
amount of oxygenates, but shifts the selectivity from acethaldeyde to ethanol 
[238], Fig. 19. From CO adsorption experiments the authors have detected 
an infrared band at 1725 cm-' present on ceria-doped catalysts, which has 
been tentatively attributed to a chemisorbed CO where the oxygen interacts 
with a Lewis acid of the support, in a fashion similar to that proposed by 
Rieck and Bell for rare earth oxide moieties covering Pd metal and interacting 
with CO [164], as illustrated.

This synergetic interaction implies a high dispersion and an intimate contact 
between Rh and ceria 12281. The activity and selectivity for Ni/CeO, catalysts 
have also been reported [72,79]. Ni/CeO, is 20 times more active than Ni/ 
SiO,, with a product distribution shifted to heavier hydrocarbons, olefins, and 
a significant amount of carbon dioxide. These higher performances were at- 
tributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies on ceria that can be easily 
ionized, thereby releasing free electrons able to migrate from the support to 
the metal-support interface, leading to an enrichment of the Ni. This, in turn, 
would favor the weakening of the CO bond by enhancement of the electron

backdonation effect. Furthermore, the oxygen vacancies in the vicinity of 
nickel particles can interact with the oxygen atom of CO, facilitating CO 
dissociation as seen with Rh and Pd. Formation of CO,, which characterizes 
also CO/H, reaction over pure CeO,, can be explained by CO oxidation op- 
erated by lattice oxygen with formation of an anionic vacancy, in a fashion 
similar to that observed by Jin et al. in the interconversion of CO and CO, 
over Pt/CeO, interphase [146]. The interfacial contact between Pt and CeO, 
is also responsible for the high CO, yields in the methanation of CO over Pt/ 
CeO,/Al,O, [147]; the effect of the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) in this 
case has been excluded. Likewise, promotion of a ruthenium and a cobalt 
catalyst supported on carbon with CeO, enhances the production of long- 
chain hydrocarbon and alkenes [88,287], as a result of an increase in the rate 
constant for the C-0 bond dissociation and a decrease of the hydrogenation 
capability of the catalysts, due to chemical interaction between the promoter 
and the adsorbed species. 
Ce0,-containing catalysts derived from intermetallic CeCu precursors 
also show an interesting activity in CO/H, reactions, with a very high activity 
and selectivity for methanol, Table 14. It is suggested that during activation 
of Ce,Cu, precursor, formation of Cu/CeO, catalyst takes place according to 
the generalized reaction: 
Ce,Cu, + 2xCO + 4xH, - 
xCeO, + &CH, + yCu 
which accounts also for methane formation during the activation step. The 
special activity of these catalysts is associated with the presence of an intimate 
interaction of copper atoms with the oxide phase, a feature attributable to the 
atomic-scale mixing which characterizes the alloy precursor [288]. Moreover, 
the nature of the transition metal phase is very important as determined by 
comparing the CeCu catalyst with Au/CeO, [240] and Ag/CeO, catalysts 
[241] derived from CeAu and CeAg, which are not active for methanol 
synthesis. 
A few studies have been conducted on the hydrogenation of CO, using 
CeO, as the support for noble metals. The main product of carbon dioxide 
hydrogenation over M/CeO, at atmospheric pressure is methane [76], al- 
though in particular conditions C, and C, hydrocarbons have been detected 
[159]. The activation of noble metals by reduction at high temperatures con- 
siderably enhances the CO, methanation activity under transient conditions 
[76]. This behavior, which is the opposite of what is found on other reducible 
oxides [150], has recently been attributed to the formation of bulk and surface 
vacancies which increase the dissociation rate of CO,. The effect of reduction 
temperature on the initial and steady-state CO, methanation activity over Rh/ 
CeO, is reported in Fig. 20. It is shown that, although the initial activity is 
dramatically enhanced by the reduction treatment, an almost opposite behav- 
ior is observed for the steady-state activity. Two factors might explain these 
findings: (i) formation of surface and especially bulk oxygen vacancies after

reduction at high temperatures, which explains the high reactivity of CO, 
toward ceria; and (ii) reoxidation of ceria by water and/or oxygen from CO,, 
which explains the strong deactivation observed soon after introduction of 
the reagents. As a matter of fact, water is not detected as a reaction product 
at the beginning of the reaction [26,64,159]. The positive effect of reduction 
temperature on methanol production in the hydrogenation of CO, at high 
pressure over Pd/CeO, was also reported recently [153,154] and was attrib- 
uted to the establishment of a strong metal-support interaction between ceria 
and Pd. 
2. Hydrogenation of Organic Compounds 
CeO, has often been used as a support for hydrogenation of hydrocar- 
bons and other organic compounds. Hydrogenation of ethylene on pure ceria 
was found to proceed at a rate lower than that observed on other rare earth 
oxides, particularly La,O, [290], and it was associated to the degree of acidity 
of CeO,. Other oxides with the fluorite structure, like terbium and praseodi- 
mium oxides, were found inactive. A treatment in hydrogen at high temper- 
ature is found to activate the oxides, probably for the formation of a partial 
amount of the sesquioxides (M20,), which shows a higher activity in this 
reaction. However, in view of more recent investigations, formation of Ce 
hydrides or cerium bronzes [43,111] could be accounted for, to explain this 
behavior. The introduction of a metal generally produces active hydrogenation 
catalysts; thus formation of Pd-CeO, from CePd, intermetallic compound is 
found to enhance the rate of hydrogenation of but-1-ene, buta-1,3-diene, and

but-1-yne [291], in comparison to other REPd, intermetallic compounds. This 
behavior is interpreted as a promotion effect of cerium on the availability of 
hydrogen atoms on the palladium site, due to spillover, and also,by an elec- 
tron transfer from Pd to Ce, which keeps palladium in an electron-deficient 
state. A few studies have also been conducted on hydrogenation of benzene 
over the metakeria system; generally these studies are a part of more general 
investigations aimed at the study of the interaction between the metal and the 
support. The results, summarized in Table 15, show that regardless of the 
metal employed, the activity is strongly dependent on the reduction treatment, 
with a small difference in the behavior of Rh and Pt, whose activity after a 
high temperature reduction is still observable. There is no full agreement 
between the authors in explaining these results. In the case of Pd/CeO,, for- 
mation of intermetallic M-Ce alloys has been detected in connection with 
the loss in activity, and it was suggested as a possible cause of the deacti- 
vation observed [61]. A similar conclusion was reached by Meriaudeau et al. 
[138] on Pt/CeO, catalyst. With Ni and Ir the drop in activity has been as- 
sociated with the onset of a strong metal-support interaction [79,156]. The 
smaller decrease of activity for the Rh-containing catalyst has been associated 
to some support sintering following reduction at 773 K. No evidence for 
strong perturbations of the Rh-CeO, interface was observed [63]. This is in 
contrast with Cunningham et al.'s [44] findings in the hydrogenation of ac- 
etone over Rh/CeO,. They found progressive inhibition of hydrogenation ac- 
tivity after reduction at increasing temperatures from 473 to 673 K; the be- 
havior was connected with the onset of SMSI phenomena. On the other hand, 
Pt/CeO, after reduction at high temperature was found more active for C-0

hydrogenation in acrolein, while the ability of Pt/CeO, to hydrogenate C=C 
was not affected by the reduction treatment [248]. It is clear from the above 
data that a unique picture cannot be given easily. The effects of preparation, 
treatment procedures, and operating conditions can heavily affect the final 
results. Nevertheless it appears that the catalytic behavior of metakeria under 
hydrogenation is profoundly affected by the pretreatment in hydrogen, re- 
gardless of the metal employed and the texture properties of ceria. While it 
is not clear if this is the result of a strong interaction between metal and 
support, it is clear that the behavior of ceria differs from the behavior of other 
reducible oxides, like TiO, and Nb205, 
under similar conditions [ 
138,2481. 
C. Elimination of SO, and NO, 
Great attention is paid nowadays to the removal of sulfur oxides and 
nitric oxide emissions which originate mainly from burning of fossil fuels. 
The second stationary sources, which produces between 5% and 10% of the 
total SO, emissions, are oil refineries and especially fluid catalytic cracking 
(FCC) units. SO, and SO, emissions from FCC units are the target of severe 
regulations and a considerable amount of work have been done to develop 
systems competitive to the laborious and cost-intensive flue gas scrubbing 
and feedstock hydrodesulfurization [4-61. In FCC units it is the sulfur de- 
posited on the catalyst that during the regeneration step is oxidized to SO, 
and SO3, 
which must be eliminated. A suitable alternative to capital intensive 
hydrodesulfurization or flue gas scrubbing units is the use of a catalyst, added 
to the FCC catalyst, to reduce SO, emissions. The design of such a catalyst 
is a challenging problem: it must oxidize SO, to SO3, chemisorb SO3, and 
then release it as it leaves the regeneration unit and enters the catalytic unit. 
Moreover, it must possess good mechanical strength to survive under con- 
ditions typical of FCC units. The reaction scheme can be summarized as 
follows [4]: 
2s0, + 0, == 2s0, 
SO, + MO * 
MSO, 
MSO, + 4H, * 
MO + H,S + 3H,O 
MSO, + 4H2 * 
MS + 4H2O 
MS + H,O = MO + H,S 
in which MO represents an oxide catalyst. Steps (9) and (10) occur in the 
regeneration unit, while the others take place in the catalytic unit and include 
the regeneration of the MO catalyst with formation of H2S, which can be 
recovered by available techniques. Ceria was found to be an efficient catalyst 
for Reaction (9), and it is currently used in industrial catalyst formulations 
supported on Mg2A120, [5,6,262,263]. This composition was found to be 
more effective than either CeO,/Al,O, or CeO,/MgO catalysts, which showed

lower SO, chemisorption capabilities and stronger deactivation due to irre- 
versible sulfate formation [4]. The support Mg,Al,O, is a combination re- 
sulting form a solid solution of the spinel MgAl,O, and MgO, which showed 
the best SO, activities among several other compositions. A catalytic cycle 
has been proposed, where the role of ceria is that of oxidizing SO, to SO3, 
while the support is responsible for the storage of SO, as sulfate, Fig. 21. 
However, the known capabilities of CeO, to oxidize SO, and adsorb the 
product as sulfate [292] suggest that CeO, could also have an active role in 
the sulfur storage part of the cycle. Catalysts containing ceria, of analogous 
composition, are also reported to be effective in trapping vanadium contam- 
inants, which would affect the performances of FCC zeolite-based catalysts 
[293]. Other catalyst compositions in which CeOJMg-Al is used in com- 
bination with CuO as cocatalyst [264,294], or CeO, is used as a part of a 
Ce0,-containing mineral like bastnaesite [295,296], show excellent properties 
on both the SO, oxidation and regeneration step. Similar catalysts formula- 
tions have been studied in the conversion of NO to N2 in the FCC units, 
including the spinel-based SO, reduction catalyst CeO,/MgAl,O,-MgO 
[297,298]. The catalyst is very active for the complete reduction of NO at 
temperatures higher than 593"C, and its activity is attributed to the redox 
properties of ceria. A mechanism in which ceria undergoes cycling reduction 
(by SO, or CO present in the stream) and oxidation (by NO and/or 0,) is 
proposed. The potential of CeO, to simultaneously remove SO, and NO, from 
flue gases has also been pointed out recently [261]. The authors have pro- 
posed use of a two-step process in which CeO,/Al,O, serves as oxidation

IV. CERIA IN AUTOMOTIVE EXHAUST CATALYSTS 
Probably the most important application of CeO, is in the formulation 
of three-way catalysts (TWC) for automotive exhaust gas treatment. A de- 
tailed description of the catalytic chemistry of TWC is beyond the scope of 
this review and has been presented elsewhere [299-3011. Instead we will 
focus only on those aspects of TWCs that directly involve CeO,. Catalysts 
are used in the exhaust system to control the emission of pollutants, mainly 
NO, CO, and hydrocarbons. Three-way catalysts are designed to simultane- 
ously remove these pollutants. They primarily consist of noble metals and 
metal oxides dispersed either on the surface of alumina pellets or on an 
alumina washcoat anchored to a monolithic ceramic substrate. Although the 
exact role of CeO, in TWC is still not clear, it has been firmly established 
that ceria contributes to the performance of TWCs by (i) enhancing the ef- 
fectiveness of Pt-Rh catalysts under dynamic oscillating conditions which 
are typical of the operating environment of TWCs [2,24,253,302-3041, and 
(ii) interacting synergistically with noble metals, resulting in the formation 
of catalytically active sites at the M-CeO, interface (these sites simultane- 
ously promote the oxidation of CO and the reduction of NO) [21,33, 
83,119,130,146,149,173,219,273,305]. In this case, oxygen vacancies at the 
metal-oxide interface of reduced ceria are believed to play a key role in the 
process. 
A. The Role of 
Ceria in the Dynamic Behavior of 
TWC 
The majority of industrial catalysts operate under steady-state condi- 
tions. However, a catalyst for automotive exhaust control is exposed to con- 
stantly varying conditions (e.g., temperature increase at the beginning of ve- 
hicle operations, fluctuation of exhaust flow rate and composition due to 
change in the driving style and speed). For optimum catalyst performance the 
air-to-fuel ratio (A/F) has to be near the stoichiometric value (A/F),. The 
immediate vicinity of (A/F)s 
forms the so-called TWC window [defined as 
the range of A/F ratios near the stoichiometric point over which conversion 
of each pollutant does not fall below a required percentile (often prescribed 
by environmental legislature)]. Owing to the intimate nature of the automotive 
exhaust, A/F oscillations occur with a frequency of 1 Hz [253]; these A/F 
oscillations have been shown to affect catalyst performance for CO oxidation 
on the rich side (0,-poor zone) of the window as well as NO reduction on 
the lean side (0,-rich zone). The role of ceria in improving TWC performance 
in this dynamic environment is twofold: its oxygen storage capacity [2,24, 
217,253,254,302,304,3061 affects CO and NO conversion when switching

from a leadrich to a rich/lean exhaust composition, while its ability to pro- 
mote the water-gas shift reaction [21,29,253-255,3071 allows for the con- 
version of CO and H,O to CO, and H,. 
I .  Oxygen Storage Capacity 
Ghandi et al. [3] recognized the potential benefits of including an "ox- 
ygen storage" component in the catalyst to diminish the effects of the oscil- 
lating feedstream between rich and lean exhaust stoichiometries. Such a com- 
ponent should have the ability of accumulating and storing the excess oxygen 
during the lean cycle of the oscillations and making it available during ex- 
cursions on the rich side of the stoichiometric point, to help oxidation of CO 
and HCs. This accumulation and storage of oxygen and subsequent conver- 
sion to CO, in rich exhaust has been demonstrated to be an important transient 
process affecting the dynamic of the Ce0,-containing three-way catalysts. In 
particular, it was observed that following a switch from a lean environment 
to a rich environment, the transient CO conversion was higher than expected 
in comparison to that estimated from an instantaneous response [2,253,302, 
3081. This was evident when Ce0,-based TWCs were used, and the effect 
was less pronounced with Ce0,-free materials. CO conversion responses of 
three-way catalysts to rapid and continuous changes in exhaust composition 
were also reported [303,308] and it was found that CO emission following 
lean to rich transitions during A/F step changes and A/F cycling is lower 
than CO emission estimated from instantaneous catalyst response, the effect 
being enhanced over ceria-containing catalysts. These results, corroborated 
by 0, uptake experiments performed on H, reduced samples 13021, have been 
explained by the ability of ceria to undergo a redox cycle, shifting between 
Ce'" under reducing conditions and Ce'" under 0,-rich conditions. In the 
exhaust environment, the following reactions have been proposed to account 
for the storage of oxygen: 
Ce,O, + 0.50, == 2Ce0, 
Ce,O, + NO * 
2Ce0, + 0.5N2 
Ce,O, + H,O * 
2Ce0, + H, 
and for its release: 
2Ce0, + H2 - 
Ce,O, + H,O 
2Ce0, + CO - 
Ce,O, + CO, 
Following these investigations, several studies have appeared on the ox- 
ygen storage capacity (OSC) behavior of ceria-based materials. A first 
distinction that should be made is between the dynamic OSC and the ultimate 
OSC [24,218]. The first, which is more useful, is obtained by cycling contin- 
uously between a reducing and an oxidizing stream, and measuring the dy- 
namically adsorbed 0, in transient conditions; the second represents the ox-

ygen uptake measured after a step change from a reducing (H, or CO) and 
an oxidizing (0,) atmosphere. It is generally observed that OSC of Ce0,- 
containing materials is generally higher than the OSC of the corresponding 
Ce0,-free counterpart. For example, it has been reported that OSC of Rh, Pt, 
and Pd on Al,O, is significantly lower than the oxygen storage capacity of 
Rh/CeO, [ 
169,2181 or of Rh(Pt,Pd)/CeO,/Al,O, [13,24,169,304], as can be 
seen from the values reported in Table 16. Another interesting feature that 
appears from these data is that addition of precious metals (PM) significantly 
enhances the OSC of ceria and CeO,/Al,O,, which is attributed to mutual 
synergetic interaction between PM and CeO,: PM promotes the redox of 
CeO,, while CeO, stabilizes the dispersion of the precious metal. High-tem- 
perature aging [24,162,304] and presence of SO, [304] in the feeding stream 
adversely affect the OSC of PM/CeO,. However, if OSC is calculated on the 
basis of surface area available [169], it is positively influenced by thermal 
treatments at high temperatures, which can be explained by invoking the 
participation of lattice oxygen in the process [93-95,166,2181. Different pro- 
moters have been also used to enhance the OSC of ceria and Rh/CeO, cat- 
alysts [SO], Fig. 22. These promoters (and particularly copper) may affect the 
surface redox properties of the catalyst by interacting synergetically with both 
the precious metal and ceria. As a consequence, the redox behavior of both 
ceria and the dopant is enhanced, thus allowing a much lower temperature 
for the surface reduction and oxidation processes. 
The actual importance of oxygen storagehelease during dynamic oper- 
ations is determined not only by the OSC but also by the rates of the change 
of the oxygen content of a catalyst (i.e., the rates of cerium oxidation and 
reduction processes). These rates have been estimated over a PM/CeO,/Al,O, 
catalyst following a step change in A/F ratio (from lean to rich and vice 
versa) of a real exhaust [302]. The results, reported in Fig. 23, show that the 
increase and decrease of oxygen content of the catalyst change linearly with 
pulse duration, with the rate of the oxygen increase being higher than that of 
oxygen depletion. This indicates that the oxidation process is faster than the 
reduction process, and consequently the oxygen content of the catalyst will 
tend to remain high if the air-fuel ratio is cycled symmetrically about the 
stoichiometric point. In other words, the quasi-equilibrium oxidation state of 
Ce-containing catalysts under dynamic air-fuel ratio conditions is close to 4. 
This implies that most of cerium is present in the catalyst as CeO,. These 
findings are confirmed by recent studies carried out by Padeste et al. [27,53] 
which found that under cycled conditions, different kinetics drive the oxi- 
dation and reduction processes on pure CeO, and Rh/CeO,. While the oxi- 
dation of reduced ceria is fast (under both 0, 
[27] and NO [53] atmospheres) 
and controlled only by the amount of oxidant present, the reduction rate is 
slower and controlled by diffusion. This is well illustrated in Fig. 24, where 
the catalyst response to redox cycling is reported. As can be seen, H, is 
consumed over a longer period of time while 0, is totally and instantaneously 
consumed after switching. A quantification of the process indicates that about

2.5% of the ceria is reversibly reduced. This value might be different in real 
catalysts, where reduction of ceria is also affected by CeO, dispersion and 
high-temperature redox aging conditions [ 
1621. Moreover, the presence of 
water in real exhaust may change the reduction kinetics, acting as an impor- 
tant source of oxygen [27,162,302]. As a matter of fact, the ratio of CeO, 
reduction is significantly lowered in the presence of water (Fig. 24, B), as 
evidenced by a reduction in the H, consumption and a shorter reoxidation 
time. 
The OSC of Ce0,-containing catalysts plays an important role also in 
the enhancement of CO-NO reaction under cycling conditions [217,218]. In 
these studies it was first developed the idea of enhancing the catalytic activity 
of noble metals for NO decomposition by improving the oxygen storage/ 
transport characteristics of the support material. A very interesting finding is 
that by doping CeO, with aliovalent oxides like Gd203, 
the creation of the 
so-called extrinsic oxygen vacancies on the mixed oxide support (to differ- 
entiate them from the intrinsic oxygen vacancies formed by reduction of Ce4+ 
to Ce3' and removal of oxygen) leads to an increase in the oxygen transport 
characteristics of the material. This, in turn, augments the oxygen storage 
capacity, both the total and the kinetically accessible part, especially at higher 
temperatures, where 0, mobility is higher. The target is to create a material 
having, at the same time, a high number of oxygen vacancies and a high 
mobility; in fact, an increase in the number of vacancies only does not nec- 
essarily provide a higher OSC, unless the uptake rate or oxygen mobility is 
sufficiently fast [218]. Similar conclusions were reached by Miki et al. [166], 
who observed an enhancement of the OSC of a La,O,-doped PM/CeO,/Al,O, 
catalyst. They also attributed the increased OSC of lanthanum-doped catalysts

to a higher diffusion rate of lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancies in 
lanthana-ceria crystallites. A prerequisite for this enhancement is the solu- 
bility of the aliovalent oxides in CeO, and the presence of a precious metal 
which promotes the redox behavior of doped ceria. Other factors may affect 
the oxygen storage capacity as well; the high OSC of a Pt/CeO,/Al,O, catalyst 
doped with La,O, [81] was attributed to the higher dispersion of Pt and CeO, 
induced by La,O,. In this case other possibilities, including the decrease of 
the amount of Ce3+ 
stabilized as CeAlO, [309] or the stabilization of surface 
area [310], may account for the higher OSC. High oxygen storage capacities 
were observed for Ce0,-ZrO, solid solutions both in the presence [93,311] 
and in the absence of noble metals [95]. In these cases the high OSC capacity 
has been related to the high reducibility of Ce'" in Zr-doped CeO,, which is 
a consequence of the high 0'- mobility inside the fluorite lattice. The reason 
for the increased mobility lies in the high defective structure and lattice strain 
which is generated by introduction of the smaller isovalent Zr cation into the 
CeO, lattice (Zr4+ 
has a crystal ionic radius of 0.84 A, smaller than 0.97 8, 
found for Ce4+ 
in the same coordination environment [ 
107,3121). A similar 
behavior has been observed with Hf-substituted CeO, [ll], and with several 
metal (M = Ca2+, 
Zn2+, 
Co3+, 
Pb4+, 
Mn4')-doped ceria samples [313]. The 
important role of lattice ion mobility is well illustrated in Fig. 25, which 
shows the dependence of the OSC of a series of Ce0,-ZrO, solid solutions 
with surface area. The decrease in surface area does not bring to a corre- 
spondent decrease of OSC, which can be explained by the high mobility and 
diffusion of oxygen into the fcc structure o

solid solutions [92,314] and their activity in CO-NO reaction [94] make these 
materials innovative catalysts for auto exhaust treatment. 
Another interesting point which need to be addressed here is the role 
played by hydrocarbons in the oxygen storagehelease cycle under transient 
feedstream conditions. As expected, the extent of the catalyst redox reactions 
depends on the nature of the reducing gas. Hence, the contribution of hydro- 
carbons to the dynamic oxygen storage capacity is lower than that of H, and 
CO. This can be seen in Table 17, in which the contributions of H,, CO, and 
propene to catalyst reduction and oxygen storage are reported [307]. The 
ability of hydrocarbons to act as reducing gases and the easy availability of 
lattice oxygen from CeO, favor the transient conversion of CxHy 
to CO, (or 
CO) according to the following scheme, which implies the reduction of the 
catalyst [ 
1861: 
CxHy

xC0, + 0.5yHZO + (4x + y)e- 
and where 0, indicates an oxygen from the ceria lattice. In particular, the 
oxidation of hydrocarbons by oxygen coming from ceria, and thus in the 
absence of gaseous oxygen, has been specifically reported for CH, [132,134, 
2011, C,H, [132,201], C,H, [132,186,201], C,H, [307], and C,H, [307] under 
transient conditions, at temperatures higher than 573 K. Another interesting 
feature which determines the fate of hydrocarbons under cycling conditions 
is their ‚Äúretention‚Äù on the catalyst during a rich excursion as carbon particles 
[ 
186,3021, presumably resulting from cracking of the hydrocarbons adsorbed 
on the catalyst. This would improve the overall HC conversion as such HC 
would be readily oxidized in a subsequent lean excursion. Moreover the HC 
conversion is also increased by the presence of steam in exhaust gases which

promotes the steam reforming reaction [307]. The presence of CeO, is also 
important at this stage, as its capability of inhibiting coking processes and 
enhancing steam reforming of hydrocarbons is known [265,315-3171. A pos- 
sible explanation is that the presence of cerium in a lower valence state may 
help the dissociative adsorption of water as -0 
and -OH 
species which 
are then transferred to the surface carbon to form CO, CO,, and H,O. 
2. Water-Gas Shift 
Reaction 
The role of ceria in enhancing the WGSR during transient oscillations 
of the exhaust has been pointed out by several authors [2,21,29,253- 
255,3071. Schlatter and Mitchell [253] first proposed that WGSR could ac- 
count for the enhanced transient CO conversion they observed following a 
step change from lean to rich conditions on a PM/CeO,/Al,O, catalyst, Fig. 
26. They verified that this enhancement was accompanied by formation of 
equimolar amounts of CO, and H, during the transient period, and also no 
substantial modification of CO conversion was evidenced in the absence of 
water. Similar results were obtained also by Kim [2], who demonstrated that 
the transient CO conversion efficiency must be largely due to the water-gas 
shift reaction, although a contribution (which has been estimated to account 
for approx. 33% of CO conversion) from the CO + 0 
(surface) reaction was 
established, thus accounting also for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria. In 
these first studies a definitive picture accounting for the reason of these be- 
haviors was not given, although the authors associated the increase in the 
WGSR activity to the presence of an oxidized state of Rh, induced under

lean conditions, and stabilized by ceria [253]. Recent studies [250,251] have 
pointed out the important role of Rh in the strong (ca. 100 times) enhance- 
ment of the WGSR over Rh/CeO, in comparison to pure ceria. It was estab- 
lished that WGSR proceeds on Ce-0 sites of ceria, and the effect of Rh was 
that of modifying the local electronic structure and surface morphology 
around the reaction site. Although these studies were conducted in conditions 
far from that encountered in real exhaust catalysts, the important role of 
Ce-0 sites near Rh is described. Under exhaust gas conditions, there are 
some additional factors that must be considered in the assessment of the role 
of WGSR: (i) the enhancement of WGSR is transient, being higher only 
following a change from a 0,-rich to a 02-poor 
atmosphere; (ii) this enhance- 
ment is considerably higher in the presence of precious metals, particularly 
Rh, which is much more effective than Pt in promoting WGSR under exhaust 
gas conditions [255]; (iii) the presence of SO, may have a deprimental effect 
on WGSR activity, thus decreasing its importance in the actual exhaust en- 
vironment [273,318]; and (iv) Rh/CeO,/Al,O, shows a higher WGSR activity 
following a switch from a lean to a rich step compared to Rh/Al,O, catalyst, 
but its activity decreases more rapidly when ceria is present, Fig. 27. By 
following these guidelines a mechanism for WGSR on Rh/CeO, under con- 
ditions typical of exhaust has been proposed to account for the enhancement 
in activity [254]. This is based on the formation of an active Rh oxide catalyst 
under lean conditions; deactivation occurs by adsorption of water and for- 
mation of hydroxyl groups strongly bonded to the surface, which prevent the 
regeneration of the active species. Another justification for the enhancement

of WGSR is given by Zafiris and Gorte [275]. They found evidence that 
oxygen can migrate from ceria onto deposited Rh particles at relatively low 
temperatures. This oxygen can actually be used to oxidize CO to CO,; then 
partially reduced ceria can be reoxidized by water [319], completing the cat- 
alytic cycle. The authors did not find any evidence for oxygen migration onto 
Pt particles, which could also help to explain the fact that Pt is much less 
effective in promoting the WGSR in auto exhaust catalysts [255], although 
Pt/CeO, catalyst, under different conditions, is active in the conversion of 
CO and H,O into CO, and H, [235]. Despite this large number of studies 
focusing on the role of C0/H20 
reaction, the contribution of WGSR pro- 
moted by ceria on the overall CO conversion is not without criticism. Re- 
cently, the role of steam in the oxidation of CO over a Pt-Rh/CeO,/Al,O, 
catalyst has been examined [320]; in the presence of steam the CO oxidation 
activity is enhanced by reaction of OH and 0, species adsorbed on ceria, 
yielding reactive oxygen adatoms which further react forming C02, 
according 
to a mechanism which excludes any contribution from the water-gas shift 
reaction. 
B. The Role o
f
 
M-CeO, Interactions in the Promotion of 
CO-NO 
Reaction 
Of special importance are metal-ceria interactions in Ce0,-containing 
PM/Al,O, and PM/CeO, catalysts that will affect the behavior in CO/NO 
reaction occurring under conditions typical of auto exhaust. It was obvious 
that the effect of ceria could not be explained only on the basis of the en- 
hancement of CO conversion under transient oscillating conditions. Factors 
other than the oxygen storage capacity and the water-gas shift reaction 
should be operative in automotive exhaust catalysts containing ceria. Oxygen 
vacancies associated with reduced ceria in the proximity of noble metal par- 
ticles have been suggested as active sites for NO and CO conversion 
[21,29,33,50,75,82-S4,130,131,14S,149,161,173,183,219,273]. Although in 
the majority of studies laboratory ‚Äúclean‚Äù feedstreams were used, and not 
real exhaust compositions, it is expected that a great diversity of results will 
be obtained, keeping in mind the strong sensitivity of the catalysts to gas 
composition. However, despite the presence of these difficulties, which affect 
to some extent the results, a general unifying picture coming out from these 
studies can be condensed in the following points: 
M-CeO, interactions affect the catalytic properties at the interfacial 
sites between the metal and the support. 
Prereduction of the catalyst promotes CO-NO reaction, probably due 
to the simultaneous formation of reduced metal and oxygen vacancies 
on ceria.

CATALYTIC PROPERTIES OF CERIA

A strongly oxidizing environment or a pretreatment under 0, at high 
temperatures is detrimental for CO oxidation activity, as less active 
M-0 species form on the surface. 
A preferential deposition of the metal on Ce0,-rich areas is seen, 
which contributes to the establishment of M-CeO, interactions. 
C. Additional Features o
f
 Ceria 
Additional features contribute to the overall performance of ceria in 
three-way catalysts. Addition of ceria results in a reasonable stabilization of 
Pt dispersion up to temperatures of 700" and 800"C, if compared to Pt on 
Al,O,. This is probably the result of Pt-Ce interactions which block the 
platinum on the surface against sintering, as a Pt2'-02p-Ce4' 
surface com- 
plex [21,321]. 
Ceria also increases the mechanical strength of Al,O, [322] and stabi- 
lizes Al,O, against surface area loss [29,323], by preventing the transfor- 
mation of y-Al,O, to a-A1203. 
These effects are strongly dependent on the 
preparation methods and on the CeO, loading; low CeO, loading is the most 
effective in the promotion of thermal stability of alumina while high CeO, 
loading is almost ineffective, Fig. 28. Recently, addition of ceria to Al,O, 
was found to induce an important synergetic effect on both CeO, and A1203, 
which are also strongly dependent on CeO, loading [324]: (i) the presence 
of Al,O, induces on CeO, an enhanced acidity of the surface cus Ce4+ 
sites, 
as detected by CO adsorption experiments; and (ii) the presence of ceria 
induces in the alumina network an altered porous texture and an increased

overall strong Lewis acidity. Specifically the presence of ceria stabilizes the 
most acidic AILys sites that have a low concentration on pure Al2O,. At higher 
CeO, loading, the substitution of cus A

 centers by cus Ce4+ 
takes place, 
inducing a gradual formation of a surface mixed-oxide phase. However there 
are no proofs that these effects modify the catalytic performances, although 
they are probably important in CO activation. 
Another effect of adding ceria to a three-way catalyst is the promotion 
of sulfur storage [29,325,326]. Sulfur-containing compounds (mainly SO, and 
SO,), which are present in the exhaust at concentration of about 20-40 ppm, 
can be trapped by cerium under fuel-lean conditions to form stable sulfates

Ce,(S04), + 2Ce,O3 
The release of this stored sulfur is induced by a change from fuel-lean 
to fuel-rich conditions and is accomplished by reduction to H2S, which is 
generally emitted with a large spike [325]. The relation between ceria and 
H,S production was clearly evidenced by Engler et al. [326], who showed 
that the complete reduction of SO, to H,S on ceria-containing catalysts is 
more effective than on ceria-free catalysts, whether the sulfur component is 
part of the gas phase or is already stored on the catalyst surface. 
D. Ceria in Diesel Emission Control 
Emissions from diesel engines contain gaseous, liquid, and solid com- 
pounds [327]. Cerium aids the removal of particulate that deposits in the 
filtering device of diesel engines. The presence of cerium compounds at a 
very low concentration in the fuel is shown to drastically reduce the temper- 
ature of the burn-off of soot deposits on the filter [328]. This probably occurs 
through oxidation of cerium derivatives to finely divided cerium oxide par- 
ticles (5-25 nm) which grow in close contact with soot particulate [329]. 
Upon deposition of these mixture (containing approx. 0.01% of CeO,) on the 
filter, CeO, acts as an oxidation catalyst to reduce the autoignition temperature 
of soot particles, thus allowing on-site filter regeneration. This system is being 
developed by Rhone Poulenc [329,330]. Alternatively, CeO, can be used 
directly as an efficient additive to particulate traps, to lower the combustion 
temperature of soot [331,332]. Table 18 lists the temperatures for maximum 
combustion efficiency and CO/CO, product ratio of various oxides mixed 
with soot; it is shown that CeO, has one of the lowest combustion tempera- 
tures, although it is adversely affected by the presence of SO, in the gas 
stream, probably by formation of sulfates which need regeneration [331]. 
Mechanical and thermal properties of CeO, supported on cordierite-based 
particulate traps show that no modifications occurs up to 1473 K, indicating 
that these systems are good candidates for particulate combustion in diesel 
traps [333].

CONCLUSIONS 
The use of cerium oxide in catalysis will probably grow, particularly 
because of the wider use of automobile exhaust emission control. The variety 
of catalytic systems which can benefit from the use of ceria will also increase 
and might provide further systems with commercial potential. Of relevance 
is the growing use of Ce0,-based mixed oxide as oxidation and combustion 
catalysts. Their oxidation capabilities, which rely mainly on the high effi- 
ciency of the Ce redox couple and on the high ion transport properties, could 
provide interesting materials for the use in several catalytic processes for 
environmental applications, from the incineration of volatile organic com- 
pounds to application in wastewater treatment. Also, a better understanding 
of the relation between the structural and the catalytic properties of ceria and 
Ce0,-based mixed oxides may provide a powerful tool for the targeted design 
of new, multicomponent systems. And last, but not less important, is the need 
for a deeper knowledge on how metal-ceria interactions affect the catalytic 
behavior, which at the moment is still not forthcoming.
