[1] "The inclusion of different side reactions such as propane reforming and coke formation which corresponds to different catalysts and operating conditions in the reaction network results in dramatic changes in equilibrium compositions."
[2] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[3] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[5] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[6] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

The literature discusses the effect of operating conditions and side reactions on the equilibrium conversions and product compositions in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The inclusion of different side reactions, such as propane reforming and coke formation, leads to significant changes in equilibrium compositions. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher compared to the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen. The experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are substantially lower than predicted by equilibrium due to rapid catalyst deactivation. Incorporating side reactions in thermodynamic simulations increases propane conversion and decreases propylene selectivity because these reactions are thermodynamically more favorable. Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, while higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation and propylene yield, except for catalysts that control undesired side reactions kinetically.

文献讨论了在氧化脱氢反应中，操作条件和副反应对丙烷与二氧化碳平衡转化率和产物组成的影响。不同副反应（如丙烷重整和焦炭形成）的引入导致了平衡组成显著变化。热力学分析表明，在存在CO2的情况下，丙烷的平衡转化率高于惰性气体或氢气的存在情况。报道的实验转化率在单步和两步丙烷脱氢过程中远低于由平衡预测的结果，这可以归因于催化剂的快速失活。在热力学模拟中包含副反应显著增加了丙烷的转化率并降低了丙烯选择性，因为这些反应从热力学角度来看更为有利。提高温度增强了CO和氢的选择性，而更高的温度和CO2/C3H8比降低了焦炭形成和丙烯产量，除了那些控制不希望的副反应动力学的催化剂。
