[1] "The inclusion of different side reactions such as propane reforming and coke formation which corresponds to different catalysts and operating conditions in the reaction network results in dramatic changes in equilibrium compositions."
[2] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[3] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[5] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[6] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

1. The inclusion of side reactions like propane reforming and coke formation in the reaction network leads to significant changes in equilibrium compositions. This is influenced by the specific catalysts and operational conditions.

2. In the presence of CO2, propane's equilibrium conversion surpasses that in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen, with a two-step pathway being more advantageous than a one-step pathway.

3. The experimental conversion levels for one-step and two-step propane dehydrogenation are notably lower than the equilibrium predictions. This discrepancy can be attributed to rapid catalyst deactivation.

4. Incorporating side reactions in thermodynamic simulations enhances propane conversion and diminishes propylene selectivity, as these reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than the primary reaction.

5. Higher temperatures improve the product selectivity towards CO and hydrogen, specifically in the context of propane dry reforming.

6. Elevated temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios decrease the propensity for coke formation and propylene yield, except for catalysts that control unwanted side reactions kinetically.

1. 包含副反应如丙烷重整和焦炭形成在反应网络中导致平衡组成显著变化。这受到特定催化剂和操作条件的影响。

2. 在CO2存在下，丙烷的平衡转化率超过在惰性气体或氢气中的转化率，两步路径比一步路径更优。

3. 一阶和二阶丙烷脱氢实验的转化率远低于平衡预测值。这种差异可归因于快速催化剂失活。

4. 在热力学模拟中包含副反应增加丙烷转化率并降低丙烯选择性，因为这些反应从热力学角度看比主要反应更为有利。

5. 更高的温度提高了CO和氢的选择性，特别是在丙烷干重整的背景下。

6. 更高的温度和CO2/C3H8比率降低了焦炭形成倾向和丙烯产量，除了控制不希望的副反应动力学的催化剂外。
