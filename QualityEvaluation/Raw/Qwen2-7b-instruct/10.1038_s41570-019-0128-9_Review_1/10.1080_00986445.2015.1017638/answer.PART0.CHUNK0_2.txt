FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, generally exhibit superior activity and selectivity compared to vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts have been noted for their high performance and selectivity (Michorczyk et al., 2011). However, these catalysts face challenges such as deactivation during operation (Zheng et al., 2005). The deactivation mechanism involves the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in chromium-based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011). Redox oxides, including Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO, and V2O5, have been proposed to facilitate CO2 participation in the reaction through a redox cycle (Michorczyk et al., 2008). The production of H2 indicates a twostep pathway for the reaction (Michorczyk et al., 2004). The effectiveness of CO2 in CO2-ODH is attributed to its ability to consume hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) or to directly oxidize propane to propylene (Michorczyk et al., 2008).

FeexNiy/CeO2催化剂，尤其是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，通常在CO2-ODH反应中表现出较高的活性和选择性，与氧化钒催化剂相比。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂因其高性能和选择性而受到关注（Michorczyk等，2011）。然而，这些催化剂在操作过程中面临失活的问题（Zheng等，2005）。催化剂失活机制涉及六价铬还原为三价铬（Zhang等，2011）。Cr2O3、Cr2O5、ZnO和V2O5等红氧氧化物被提议通过一个红氧循环促进CO2参与反应（Michorczyk等，2008）。生成H2表明反应具有两步路径（Michorczyk等，2004）。CO2在CO2-ODH中的有效性归因于其通过逆向水煤气变换反应消耗氢或直接将丙烷氧化为丙烯的能力（Michorczyk等，2008）。
