[1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011)."

[2] "Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005)."

[3] "Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, are compared with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions based on their activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts exhibit better activity and selectivity compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The support material, composition, and structural factors play crucial roles in determining their performance. Challenges include rapid deactivation due to coke formation and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Potential for improvement lies in developing more efficient catalysts that can effectively control coke formation and maintain activity over longer periods.
