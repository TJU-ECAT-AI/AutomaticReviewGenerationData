[1] "The inclusion of different side reactions such as propane reforming and coke formation which corresponds to different catalysts and operating conditions in the reaction network results in dramatic changes in equilibrium compositions."
[2] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[3] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[5] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[6] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

1. The inclusion of side reactions like propane reforming and coke formation in the reaction network leads to significant changes in equilibrium compositions. This is influenced by the specific catalysts and operational conditions.

2. In the presence of CO2, propane's equilibrium conversion surpasses that in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen, with a two-step pathway being more advantageous than a one-step pathway.

3. The experimental conversion levels for one-step and two-step propane dehydrogenation are notably lower than the equilibrium predictions. This discrepancy can be attributed to rapid catalyst deactivation.

4. Incorporating side reactions in thermodynamic simulations enhances propane conversion and diminishes propylene selectivity, as these reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than the primary reaction.

5. Higher temperatures improve the product selectivity towards CO and hydrogen, specifically in the context of propane dry reforming.

6. Elevated temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios decrease the propensity for coke formation and propylene yield, except for catalysts that control unwanted side reactions kinetically.

1. 包含副反应如丙烷重整和焦炭形成在反应网络中导致平衡组成显著变化。这受到特定催化剂和操作条件的影响。

2. 在CO2存在下，丙烷的平衡转化率超过在惰性气体或氢气中的转化率，两步路径比一步路径更优。

3. 一阶和二阶丙烷脱氢实验的转化率远低于平衡预测值。这种差异可归因于快速催化剂失活。

4. 在热力学模拟中包含副反应增加丙烷转化率并降低丙烯选择性，因为这些反应从热力学角度看比主要反应更为有利。

5. 更高的温度提高了CO和氢的选择性，特别是在丙烷干重整的背景下。

6. 更高的温度和CO2/C3H8比率降低了焦炭形成倾向和丙烯产量，除了控制不希望的副反应动力学的催化剂外。

The literature discusses the effect of operating conditions and side reactions on the equilibrium conversions and product compositions in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The inclusion of different side reactions, such as propane reforming and coke formation, leads to significant changes in equilibrium compositions. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher compared to the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen. The experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are substantially lower than predicted by equilibrium due to rapid catalyst deactivation. Incorporating side reactions in thermodynamic simulations increases propane conversion and decreases propylene selectivity because these reactions are thermodynamically more favorable. Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, while higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation and propylene yield, except for catalysts that control undesired side reactions kinetically.

文献讨论了在氧化脱氢反应中，操作条件和副反应对丙烷与二氧化碳平衡转化率和产物组成的影响。不同副反应（如丙烷重整和焦炭形成）的引入导致了平衡组成显著变化。热力学分析表明，在存在CO2的情况下，丙烷的平衡转化率高于惰性气体或氢气的存在情况。报道的实验转化率在单步和两步丙烷脱氢过程中远低于由平衡预测的结果，这可以归因于催化剂的快速失活。在热力学模拟中包含副反应显著增加了丙烷的转化率并降低了丙烯选择性，因为这些反应从热力学角度来看更为有利。提高温度增强了CO和氢的选择性，而更高的温度和CO2/C3H8比降低了焦炭形成和丙烯产量，除了那些控制不希望的副反应动力学的催化剂。

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, generally exhibit superior activity and selectivity compared to vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts have been noted for their high performance and selectivity (Michorczyk et al., 2011). However, these catalysts face challenges such as deactivation during operation (Zheng et al., 2005). The deactivation mechanism involves the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in chromium-based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011). Redox oxides, including Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO, and V2O5, have been proposed to facilitate CO2 participation in the reaction through a redox cycle (Michorczyk et al., 2008). The production of H2 indicates a twostep pathway for the reaction (Michorczyk et al., 2004). The effectiveness of CO2 in CO2-ODH is attributed to its ability to consume hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) or to directly oxidize propane to propylene (Michorczyk et al., 2008).

FeexNiy/CeO2催化剂，尤其是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，通常在CO2-ODH反应中表现出较高的活性和选择性，与氧化钒催化剂相比。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂因其高性能和选择性而受到关注（Michorczyk等，2011）。然而，这些催化剂在操作过程中面临失活的问题（Zheng等，2005）。催化剂失活机制涉及六价铬还原为三价铬（Zhang等，2011）。Cr2O3、Cr2O5、ZnO和V2O5等红氧氧化物被提议通过一个红氧循环促进CO2参与反应（Michorczyk等，2008）。生成H2表明反应具有两步路径（Michorczyk等，2004）。CO2在CO2-ODH中的有效性归因于其通过逆向水煤气变换反应消耗氢或直接将丙烷氧化为丙烯的能力（Michorczyk等，2008）。

[1] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[2] "The onestep CO2PDH, on the contrary, shows the lowest conversion at lower diluent concentrations and even no conversion at zero CO2 concentration."
[3] "The main carbon containing product is coke over most of the range (Fig. 11)."
[4] "Unfortunately, this is not the case for carbon dioxide dehydrogenation, as shown in Table 4. The main cause is rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation rendering precise conversion measurements impossible."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses several aspects of propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) and side reactions, which include propane reforming and coke formation. It states that the inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulations leads to higher propane conversions and lower propylene selectivities because these side reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than the main CO2PDH reaction. Specifically, the onestep CO2PDH shows the lowest conversion at lower diluent concentrations and no conversion at zero CO2 concentration. The document also highlights that the main product in the presence of side reactions is coke, which is thermodynamically favored over propylene production. Furthermore, the rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation is identified as the main reason why precise conversion measurements for CO2PDH are difficult, leading to a significant difference between theoretical equilibrium conversions and experimental data.

文献讨论了丙烷在二氧化碳（CO2PDH）和副反应下的脱氢，包括丙烷重整和焦炭形成。文献指出，在热力学模拟中加入副反应可以显著提高丙烷转化率并降低丙烯选择性，因为这些副反应在热力学上比主要的CO2PDH反应更为有利。具体来说，单步CO2PDH在较低稀释剂浓度下显示出最低的转化率，并且在零CO2浓度时没有转化。文献还强调，在存在副反应的情况下，主要产物是焦炭，这是在热力学上更有利于丙烯生成的。此外，文献指出，催化剂由焦炭快速失活导致精确的转化率测量变得困难，这是造成理论平衡转化率与实验数据之间差异的主要原因。
