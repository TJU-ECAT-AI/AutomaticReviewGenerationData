[1] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[2] "The onestep CO2PDH, on the contrary, shows the lowest conversion at lower diluent concentrations and even no conversion at zero CO2 concentration."
[3] "The main carbon containing product is coke over most of the range (Fig. 11)."
[4] "Unfortunately, this is not the case for carbon dioxide dehydrogenation, as shown in Table 4. The main cause is rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation rendering precise conversion measurements impossible."

The document discusses several aspects of propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) and side reactions, which include propane reforming and coke formation. It states that the inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulations leads to higher propane conversions and lower propylene selectivities because these side reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than the main CO2PDH reaction. Specifically, the onestep CO2PDH shows the lowest conversion at lower diluent concentrations and no conversion at zero CO2 concentration. The document also highlights that the main product in the presence of side reactions is coke, which is thermodynamically favored over propylene production. Furthermore, the rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation is identified as the main reason why precise conversion measurements for CO2PDH are difficult, leading to a significant difference between theoretical equilibrium conversions and experimental data.

文献讨论了丙烷在二氧化碳（CO2PDH）和副反应下的脱氢，包括丙烷重整和焦炭形成。文献指出，在热力学模拟中加入副反应可以显著提高丙烷转化率并降低丙烯选择性，因为这些副反应在热力学上比主要的CO2PDH反应更为有利。具体来说，单步CO2PDH在较低稀释剂浓度下显示出最低的转化率，并且在零CO2浓度时没有转化。文献还强调，在存在副反应的情况下，主要产物是焦炭，这是在热力学上更有利于丙烯生成的。此外，文献指出，催化剂由焦炭快速失活导致精确的转化率测量变得困难，这是造成理论平衡转化率与实验数据之间差异的主要原因。
