2. Presently, in industry, methane is transformed into bulk chemicals by the indirect route. That is, methane is converted into syngas (CO + H2) at an elevated temperature (>973 K),3,4 and then the syngas is used to make a wide spectrum of hydrocarbons or alcohols with the use of catalysts.5,6 The process is energy intensive and the cost is high, and so it would be useful to lower the reaction temperature for the transformation of methane into chemicals. Ironically, the direct conversion of methane to derivatives, e.g., methanol, is thermodynamically feasible, but kinetically difficult.7,8 Moreover, methanol or some other products or intermediates are more reactive than the CH4 reactant, and so the kinetic protection or the selective separation of the product is necessary, which leads to more challenges in the chemical process. However, much effort has been devoted to direct methane conversion to produce the desired chemicals in high yields in order to make the direct conversion process economically competitive with the indirect route. Many researchers have given examples of how CH bond conversion can be controlled with the use of catalysts and the correct reaction environment. The ultimate goal of these studies is the development of strategies to exploit methane resources more efficiently and cleanly.

Answer: In industry, methane is typically converted into syngas through an indirect route involving high temperatures, which is energy-intensive and costly. Direct conversion of methane to various derivatives, including methanol, faces challenges due to kinetic difficulties. Researchers aim to develop strategies to control CH bond conversion using catalysts and suitable environments to increase yields and make the direct process economically viable compared to the indirect method. The ultimate goal is to efficiently and cleanly exploit methane resources.
