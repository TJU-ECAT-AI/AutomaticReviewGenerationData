[1] "Steam reforming and dry reforming hardly occur at low temperatures (<450 K)."
[2] "At high temperatures (11001300 K) and atmospheric pressure, with a suitable catalyst,these three reforming reactions readily result in more than 90% methane conversion and more than 90% selectivity to CO and H2."
[3] "Unlike the reforming processes, the TCD process only produces solid carbon and hydrogen."
[4] "The TCD reaction requires more than 1500 K to achieve a reasonable yield without a catalyst."
[5] "Metal loading for the supported catalysts used in this process is usually more than 10% which is high compared to normal supported metal catalysts."
[6] "The water splitting reaction (2H2O  2H2 + O2, DH  484 kJ mol1) is another important reaction to produce high-quality hydrogen."
[7] "Despite much effort devoted to the OCM reaction, only a few catalysts can give a C2+ yield higher than 25% and selectivity to C2+ higher than 80%, which are the minimum criteria for its industrial applications."

The document discusses the conversion of methane to valuable chemicals through various processes. The reforming of methane to produce syngas (CO + H2) is emphasized as an industrially significant method, especially in the context of its use in methanol synthesis and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane to pure hydrogen and solid carbon is another process highlighted, offering a way to produce high-quality hydrogen without the presence of CO or CO2, thus simplifying gas separation. The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) and non-oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) reactions are presented as methods for producing ethane, ethylene, and water. These reactions are described in terms of their thermodynamics, kinetics, and the catalysts used. The document also mentions the challenges associated with these processes, including the need for high temperatures, catalyst deactivation, and the production of carbonaceous deposits that can poison catalysts. Additionally, the water splitting reaction is noted as an alternative method for hydrogen production, albeit with higher thermodynamic requirements compared to the TCD process.

文档讨论了通过各种过程将甲烷转化为有价值的化学品。甲烷重整以产生合成气（CO + H2）作为工业上重要的一种方法，特别是在甲醇合成和费歇尔-特罗斯合成的背景下。热催化分解（TCD）将甲烷分解为纯氢气和固体碳被强调，提供了一种生产高质量氢气的方法，无需CO或CO2的存在，从而简化了气体分离。氧化甲烷耦合（OCM）和非氧化甲烷耦合（NOCM）反应被描述为生产乙烷、乙烯和水的方法。这些反应在热力学、动力学和所用催化剂方面进行了描述。文档还提到了这些过程面临的挑战，包括需要高温、催化剂失活以及产生的碳沉积物可以毒害催化剂的问题。此外，水分解反应被提到作为一种替代的氢气生产方法，尽管与TCD过程相比，其热力学要求更高。
