[1] "The thermodynamic data of the reaction of partial oxidation of methane to syngas are shown in Fig. 1. At high temperatures (11001300 K) and atmospheric pressure, with a suitable catalyst,these three reforming reactions readily result in more than 90% methane conversion and more than 90% selectivity to CO and H2."
[2] "The main problems in the partial oxidation of methane to syngas are safety issues. First, a mixture of methane and oxygen is extremely dangerous in industrial application.Second, the partial oxidation of methane to syngas is only autonomous at high temperature, where the reaction is very difficult to control. Finally, hot spots formed in this autonomous oxidative process are difficult to handle and would result in local overheating."
[3] "It was found that the metal crystallite size strongly affects the coke formation rate.15 When Ni particles are smaller than 1 nm, almost no coke is formed on the metal surface."
[4] "In the laboratory, a circulating fluidized bed is used to develop a continuous process, but this process requires the regeneration of the catalysts by oxidation, resulting in the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases (CO and CO2)."
[5] "The reasons why this process is not applied on a large scale are: first, a continuous reaction process that is suitable for TCD industrial application is still to be developed."

1. The partial oxidation of methane to syngas involves high temperatures, and it presents safety issues due to the danger of a methane-oxygen mixture in industrial applications. Additionally, controlling the reaction at high temperatures is challenging, and local overheating caused by hot spots is hard to manage.
2. The size of metal crystallites significantly influences the rate of coke formation. When nickel particles are smaller than 1 nanometer, almost no coke is formed on the metal surface.
3. Continuous processes suitable for industrial application of the thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane are yet to be developed. Currently, a circulating fluidized bed is used in the lab, but this requires catalyst regeneration through oxidation, leading to the release of substantial greenhouse gases.

1. 部分氧化甲烷产生合成气的过程涉及高温，存在工业应用中的安全问题，由于甲烷与氧气混合物极其危险。此外，在高温下控制反应具有挑战性，并且由热点形成的局部过热难以处理。
2. 金属晶粒大小显著影响焦炭生成速率。当镍颗粒小于1纳米时，在金属表面几乎不会形成焦炭。
3. 适用于工业应用的连续反应过程尚未开发出来。目前在实验室中使用循环流化床，但此过程需要通过氧化再生催化剂，导致大量温室气体的释放。
