[1] "The thermodynamic data of the reaction of partial oxidation of methane to syngas are shown in Fig. 1. At high temperatures (11001300 K) and atmospheric pressure, with a suitable catalyst,these three reforming reactions readily result in more than 90% methane conversion and more than 90% selectivity to CO and H2."
[2] "The main problems in the partial oxidation of methane to syngas are safety issues. First, a mixture of methane and oxygen is extremely dangerous in industrial application.Second, the partial oxidation of methane to syngas is only autonomous at high temperature, where the reaction is very difficult to control. Finally, hot spots formed in this autonomous oxidative process are difficult to handle and would result in local overheating."
[3] "It was found that the metal crystallite size strongly affects the coke formation rate.15 When Ni particles are smaller than 1 nm, almost no coke is formed on the metal surface."
[4] "In the laboratory, a circulating fluidized bed is used to develop a continuous process, but this process requires the regeneration of the catalysts by oxidation, resulting in the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases (CO and CO2)."
[5] "The reasons why this process is not applied on a large scale are: first, a continuous reaction process that is suitable for TCD industrial application is still to be developed."

1. The partial oxidation of methane to syngas involves high temperatures, and it presents safety issues due to the danger of a methane-oxygen mixture in industrial applications. Additionally, controlling the reaction at high temperatures is challenging, and local overheating caused by hot spots is hard to manage.
2. The size of metal crystallites significantly influences the rate of coke formation. When nickel particles are smaller than 1 nanometer, almost no coke is formed on the metal surface.
3. Continuous processes suitable for industrial application of the thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane are yet to be developed. Currently, a circulating fluidized bed is used in the lab, but this requires catalyst regeneration through oxidation, leading to the release of substantial greenhouse gases.

2. Presently, in industry, methane is transformed into bulk chemicals by the indirect route. That is, methane is converted into syngas (CO + H2) at an elevated temperature (>973 K),3,4 and then the syngas is used to make a wide spectrum of hydrocarbons or alcohols with the use of catalysts.5,6 The process is energy intensive and the cost is high, and so it would be useful to lower the reaction temperature for the transformation of methane into chemicals. Ironically, the direct conversion of methane to derivatives, e.g., methanol, is thermodynamically feasible, but kinetically difficult.7,8 Moreover, methanol or some other products or intermediates are more reactive than the CH4 reactant, and so the kinetic protection or the selective separation of the product is necessary, which leads to more challenges in the chemical process. However, much effort has been devoted to direct methane conversion to produce the desired chemicals in high yields in order to make the direct conversion process economically competitive with the indirect route. Many researchers have given examples of how CH bond conversion can be controlled with the use of catalysts and the correct reaction environment. The ultimate goal of these studies is the development of strategies to exploit methane resources more efficiently and cleanly.

Answer: In industry, methane is typically converted into syngas through an indirect route involving high temperatures, which is energy-intensive and costly. Direct conversion of methane to various derivatives, including methanol, faces challenges due to kinetic difficulties. Researchers aim to develop strategies to control CH bond conversion using catalysts and suitable environments to increase yields and make the direct process economically viable compared to the indirect method. The ultimate goal is to efficiently and cleanly exploit methane resources.

[1] "The first process has better atomic economy since the oxygen atom in CO is included in the product, whereas the oxygen atom of CO and some hydrogen atoms are wasted in the form of water in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis."
[2] "For example, Olah et al. suggested that bi-reforming of methane to syngas with a CO : H2 ratio of 1 : 2 is possible under high pressures, and this can be used directly in methanol synthesis."
[3] "A wide range of metal oxides are active for this reaction. LiMgO and WMn SiO2 are the most widely studied catalysts."

The direct conversion of methane to ethylene through the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction is an alternative to traditional methods based on petroleum and syngas. In this process, methane is converted into ethane, ethylene, and water in the presence of oxygen and a suitable catalyst. Ethylene, a critical building block in the chemical industry, can be converted to propylene or polymerized into polyethylene. Ethane can be easily converted to ethylene via oxidative dehydrogenation. A variety of metal oxides, including LiMgO and WMnSiO2, are active catalysts for this reaction. However, achieving a high C2+ yield (greater than 25%) and selectivity (greater than 80%) for industrial applications remains a challenge.

The document discusses the conversion of methane to valuable chemicals through various processes. The reforming of methane to produce syngas (CO + H2) is emphasized as an industrially significant method, especially in the context of its use in methanol synthesis and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane to pure hydrogen and solid carbon is another process highlighted, offering a way to produce high-quality hydrogen without the presence of CO or CO2, thus simplifying gas separation. The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) and non-oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) reactions are presented as methods for producing ethane, ethylene, and water. These reactions are described in terms of their thermodynamics, kinetics, and the catalysts used. The document also mentions the challenges associated with these processes, including the need for high temperatures, catalyst deactivation, and the production of carbonaceous deposits that can poison catalysts. Additionally, the water splitting reaction is noted as an alternative method for hydrogen production, albeit with higher thermodynamic requirements compared to the TCD process.
