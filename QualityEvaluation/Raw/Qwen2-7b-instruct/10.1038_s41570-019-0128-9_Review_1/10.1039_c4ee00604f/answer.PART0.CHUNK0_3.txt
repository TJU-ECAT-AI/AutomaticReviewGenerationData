[1] "The first process has better atomic economy since the oxygen atom in CO is included in the product, whereas the oxygen atom of CO and some hydrogen atoms are wasted in the form of water in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis."
[2] "For example, Olah et al. suggested that bi-reforming of methane to syngas with a CO : H2 ratio of 1 : 2 is possible under high pressures, and this can be used directly in methanol synthesis."
[3] "A wide range of metal oxides are active for this reaction. LiMgO and WMn SiO2 are the most widely studied catalysts."

The direct conversion of methane to ethylene through the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction is an alternative to traditional methods based on petroleum and syngas. In this process, methane is converted into ethane, ethylene, and water in the presence of oxygen and a suitable catalyst. Ethylene, a critical building block in the chemical industry, can be converted to propylene or polymerized into polyethylene. Ethane can be easily converted to ethylene via oxidative dehydrogenation. A variety of metal oxides, including LiMgO and WMnSiO2, are active catalysts for this reaction. However, achieving a high C2+ yield (greater than 25%) and selectivity (greater than 80%) for industrial applications remains a challenge.

直接将甲烷转化为乙烯通过甲烷氧化耦合反应（OCM）是基于石油和合成气的传统方法的替代方案。在这个过程中，甲烷在氧气和合适的催化剂存在下转化为乙烷、乙烯和水。乙烯作为聚合物工业的重要原料，可以被转化为丙烯或聚合成聚乙烯。乙烷可以通过氧化脱氢过程容易地转化为乙烯。各种金属氧化物，如LiMgO和WMnSiO2，都是活性催化剂。然而，实现工业应用所需的高C2+产率（大于25%）和选择性（大于80%）仍然是一个挑战。
