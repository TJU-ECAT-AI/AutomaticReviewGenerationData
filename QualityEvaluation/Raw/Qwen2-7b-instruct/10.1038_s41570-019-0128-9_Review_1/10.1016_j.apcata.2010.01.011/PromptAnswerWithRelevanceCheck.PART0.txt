[1] "Among the various catalysts studied, the InAl mixed oxides have been found to exhibit superior performance for propane dehydrogenation due to the formation of highly dispersed InOx species in the as-synthesized materials."
[2] "Combined XRD and H2-TPR results demonstrated that the specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 can result in the formation of In2O3Al2O3 in which the structural and surface redox properties are substantially modified."
[3] "Our results show that the highest catalytic performance can be attained at a In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalyst with a 20 mol% indium content, which allows the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of ca. 27% in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K."
[4] "The high catalytic activity of the present In2O3Al2O3 catalysts has been attributed to the favorable creation of surface stabilized metallic In0 nanoclusters as a consequence of in situ reduction of well-dispersed surface indium sites during the induction period."

This study demonstrates that supported indium oxide (In2O3)-based materials, especially when combined with aluminum oxide (Al2O3), are highly effective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). The InAl mixed oxides have been found to exhibit superior performance due to the formation of highly dispersed InOx species within the synthesized materials. The specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 results in the formation of In2O3Al2O3, which has significantly modified structural and surface redox properties. The highest catalytic performance is achieved when the catalyst contains 20 mol% indium, allowing for the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of around 27% during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the favorable creation of surface-stabilized metallic In0 nanoclusters, which are generated in situ through the in situ reduction of well-dispersed surface indium sites during the induction period.

[1] "Recently, the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant to activate the short chain alkanes has emerged as new promising technology for the development of safer, more economical and environmentally friendly propane dehydrogenation process."
[2] "Several techniques including N2 adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction, H2-temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were applied to characterize the physicochemical properties of the as-synthesized materials."
[3] "Catalytic tests showed that all In-containing samples were active in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane with good propylene selectivity."
[4] "The specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 leading to a high component dispersion is suggested to play a key role in regulating the redox and structural properties of surface indium species, which makes the In2O3Al2O3 composite highly active and stable for the reaction."
[5] "In view of the interesting catalytic behavior of the In2O3-based catalysts, it is of interest to elucidate the likely active species for propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "The favorable in situ creation of In0 sites from well-dispersed surface indium sites in the mixed oxide catalysts is the key factor in determining the catalytic performance of the In2O3Al2O3 materials."

This study reveals that supported indium oxide (In2O3) materials can serve as efficient catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). Among the various catalysts explored, the In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts, particularly those with a 20 mol% indium content, demonstrate superior performance. This is attributed to the specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3, which leads to a high dispersion of In2O3 components and the formation of metallic In0 nanoclusters through in situ reduction of well-dispersed surface indium sites during the induction period. These In0 sites are proposed to be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The highest catalytic performance is achieved when the catalyst contains 20 mol% indium, enabling the stable production of a maximum propylene yield of approximately 27% under reaction conditions of 873 K. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by the support material, composition, and structural factors, highlighting their potential for developing more efficient and sustainable propane dehydrogenation processes.

这项研究揭示了支持的氧化铟（In2O3）材料可以作为在二氧化碳（CO2）存在的条件下丙烷脱氢的有效催化剂。在各种催化剂中，In2O3Al2O3混合氧化物催化剂，特别是含20摩尔%的铟含量，表现出优越的性能。这归因于In2O3和Al2O3之间特定的相互作用，导致In2O3成分的高度分散，并通过原位还原表面均匀分散的铟物种形成金属In0纳米簇。这些In0位点被认为是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。实现最高催化性能的最佳催化剂是含20摩尔%的铟，这使得在873K下稳定产生丙烯的最大产率为约27%。催化剂的性能受到支撑材料、组成和结构因素的影响，表明它们在开发更高效和可持续的丙烷脱氢过程方面具有潜力。

The In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts, especially those with 20 mol% indium content, demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane. The specific interaction between indium oxide (In2O3) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) leads to a high dispersion of indium species, which is crucial for the redox and structural properties of the catalyst, enhancing its activity and stability. The catalysts exhibit a steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of around 27% at 873 K, indicating their superior performance for this reaction.

[1] "In2O3MOx binary mixed metal oxide catalysts (M: Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si, and Ce) prepared by a coprecipitation or solgel method have been tested for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of carbon dioxide."

[8] "It is important to note that the slow deactivation of the InAl-20 sample, when compared to the Ga2O3-based catalysts, could be due to the apparently low carbon deposition (see Table 2) as a consequence of its moderate surface acidity [35]."
[9] "The rate of deactivation of the InAl-20 catalyst increases with increasing the reaction temperature and time as shown in Fig. 5."
[10] "The main finding reported here is that supported In2O3 can be applied as new effective catalyst for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2."
[11] "In2O3-containing catalysts, most notably in combination with zeolites and other oxidic materials (e.g. Al2O3 or TiO2) have in the past been shown to exhibit high activity and selectivity in de-NOx reactions [2731]."
