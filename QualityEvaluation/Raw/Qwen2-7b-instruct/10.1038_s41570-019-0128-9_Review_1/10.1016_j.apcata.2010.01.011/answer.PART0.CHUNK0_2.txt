[1] "All In-containing samples were active in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane with good propylene selectivity."
[2] "The specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 leading to a high component dispersion is suggested to play a key role in regulating the redox and structural properties of surface indium species, which makes the In2O3Al2O3 composite highly active and stable for the reaction."
[3] "The highest catalytic performance can be attained at a In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalyst with a 20 mol% indium content, which allows the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of ca. 27% in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K."

The In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts, especially those with 20 mol% indium content, demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane. The specific interaction between indium oxide (In2O3) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) leads to a high dispersion of indium species, which is crucial for the redox and structural properties of the catalyst, enhancing its activity and stability. The catalysts exhibit a steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of around 27% at 873 K, indicating their superior performance for this reaction.

在二氧化碳促进的丙烷脱氢反应中，含20摩尔%铟含量的In2O3Al2O3混合氧化物催化剂显示出高活性和选择性。铟氧化物（In2O3）与铝氧化物（Al2O3）之间的特定相互作用导致了铟物种的高度分散，这对于催化剂的还原性和结构特性至关重要，从而提高了其活性和稳定性。这些催化剂能够在873 K下稳定形成最大丙烯产率约27%，表明它们在该反应中的出色性能。
