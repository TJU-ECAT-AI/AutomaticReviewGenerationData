[1] "In2O3MOx binary mixed metal oxide catalysts (M: Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si, and Ce) prepared by a coprecipitation or solgel method have been tested for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[2] "Catalytic tests showed that all In-containing samples were active in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane with good propylene selectivity."
[3] "In2O3Al2O3 afforded the highest yield of propylene (25.6%) amongst the various binary metal oxide catalysts."
[4] "The order of the steady activity of binary metal oxides at the reaction temperature of 873 K was as follows: InAl-20 > InZn-20 > In Zr-20 > InTi-20 > InFe-20 > InMg-20 > InSi-20 > InCe-20."
[5] "For the sake of comparison, the activity of bulk In2O3 is also included. While all In2O3MOx binary mixed oxides display an appreciable or pronounced activity for propylene formation, the simple oxide of bulk In2O3 demonstrated a very low activity."
[6] "The propylene selectivities in all the binary metal oxide catalysts were >75% in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."
[7] "The conversion of propane over different compositions of In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts as a function of the reaction time has been depicted in Fig. 2."
[8] "It is important to note that the slow deactivation of the InAl-20 sample, when compared to the Ga2O3-based catalysts, could be due to the apparently low carbon deposition (see Table 2) as a consequence of its moderate surface acidity [35]."
[9] "The rate of deactivation of the InAl-20 catalyst increases with increasing the reaction temperature and time as shown in Fig. 5."
[10] "The main finding reported here is that supported In2O3 can be applied as new effective catalyst for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2."
[11] "In2O3-containing catalysts, most notably in combination with zeolites and other oxidic materials (e.g. Al2O3 or TiO2) have in the past been shown to exhibit high activity and selectivity in de-NOx reactions [2731]."
