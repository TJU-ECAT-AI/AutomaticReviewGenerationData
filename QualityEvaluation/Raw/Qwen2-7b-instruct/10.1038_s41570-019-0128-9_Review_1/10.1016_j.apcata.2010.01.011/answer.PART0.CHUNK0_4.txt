[1] "All In-containing samples were active in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane with good propylene selectivity."
[2] "Among the In2O3MOx catalysts tested, the In2O3Al2O3 sample containing a 20 mol% indium content showed the highest dehydrogenation activity with superior long-term stability."
[3] "The propylene selectivities in all the binary metal oxide catalysts were >75% in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."
[4] "The highest catalytic performance can be attained at a In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalyst with a 20 mol% indium content, which allows the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of ca. 27% in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K."
[5] "The high catalytic activity of the present In2O3Al2O3 catalysts has been attributed to the favorable creation of surface stabilized metallic In0 nanoclusters as a consequence of in situ reduction of well-dispersed surface indium sites during the induction period."

1. The In-containing samples were active in CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane with good propylene selectivity. 
2. The In2O3Al2O3 sample with a 20 mol% indium content displayed the highest dehydrogenation activity and superior long-term stability. 
3. All binary metal oxide catalysts had propylene selectivities greater than 75% in the presence of CO2. 
4. A 20 mol% indium content in the In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalyst resulted in the highest catalytic performance, allowing for a steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of around 27% at 873 K. 
5. The high catalytic activity of the In2O3Al2O3 catalysts was attributed to the creation of surface stabilized metallic In0 nanoclusters through in situ reduction of dispersed indium sites during the induction period.
