[1] "Among the various catalysts studied, the InAl mixed oxides have been found to exhibit superior performance for propane dehydrogenation due to the formation of highly dispersed InOx species in the as-synthesized materials."
[2] "Combined XRD and H2-TPR results demonstrated that the specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 can result in the formation of In2O3Al2O3 in which the structural and surface redox properties are substantially modified."
[3] "Our results show that the highest catalytic performance can be attained at a In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalyst with a 20 mol% indium content, which allows the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of ca. 27% in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K."
[4] "The high catalytic activity of the present In2O3Al2O3 catalysts has been attributed to the favorable creation of surface stabilized metallic In0 nanoclusters as a consequence of in situ reduction of well-dispersed surface indium sites during the induction period."

This study demonstrates that supported indium oxide (In2O3)-based materials, especially when combined with aluminum oxide (Al2O3), are highly effective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). The InAl mixed oxides have been found to exhibit superior performance due to the formation of highly dispersed InOx species within the synthesized materials. The specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 results in the formation of In2O3Al2O3, which has significantly modified structural and surface redox properties. The highest catalytic performance is achieved when the catalyst contains 20 mol% indium, allowing for the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of around 27% during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the favorable creation of surface-stabilized metallic In0 nanoclusters, which are generated in situ through the in situ reduction of well-dispersed surface indium sites during the induction period.

本研究证明，支持的氧化铟（In2O3）基材料，特别是与氧化铝（Al2O3）结合时，是丙烷在二氧化碳（CO2）存在的条件下进行脱氢反应的有效催化剂。InAl混合氧化物表现出优越的性能，这得益于合成材料中形成的高度分散的InOx物种。In2O3和Al2O3之间的特定相互作用导致了In2O3Al2O3的形成，该化合物的结构和表面还原性显著改变。在20摩尔%的铟含量下，获得最高催化性能的催化剂允许在873 K时稳定地形成丙烯产量约为27%。这种高催化活性归因于在诱导期期间通过原位还原表面积分散的表面铟物种生成的表面稳定金属In0纳米簇的有利创建。
