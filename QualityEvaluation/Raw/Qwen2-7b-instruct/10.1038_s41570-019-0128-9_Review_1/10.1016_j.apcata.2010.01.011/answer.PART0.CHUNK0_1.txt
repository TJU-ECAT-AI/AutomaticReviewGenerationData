This study reveals that supported indium oxide (In2O3) materials can serve as efficient catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). Among the various catalysts explored, the In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts, particularly those with a 20 mol% indium content, demonstrate superior performance. This is attributed to the specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3, which leads to a high dispersion of In2O3 components and the formation of metallic In0 nanoclusters through in situ reduction of well-dispersed surface indium sites during the induction period. These In0 sites are proposed to be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The highest catalytic performance is achieved when the catalyst contains 20 mol% indium, enabling the stable production of a maximum propylene yield of approximately 27% under reaction conditions of 873 K. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by the support material, composition, and structural factors, highlighting their potential for developing more efficient and sustainable propane dehydrogenation processes.

这项研究揭示了支持的氧化铟（In2O3）材料可以作为在二氧化碳（CO2）存在的条件下丙烷脱氢的有效催化剂。在各种催化剂中，In2O3Al2O3混合氧化物催化剂，特别是含20摩尔%的铟含量，表现出优越的性能。这归因于In2O3和Al2O3之间特定的相互作用，导致In2O3成分的高度分散，并通过原位还原表面均匀分散的铟物种形成金属In0纳米簇。这些In0位点被认为是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。实现最高催化性能的最佳催化剂是含20摩尔%的铟，这使得在873K下稳定产生丙烯的最大产率为约27%。催化剂的性能受到支撑材料、组成和结构因素的影响，表明它们在开发更高效和可持续的丙烷脱氢过程方面具有潜力。
