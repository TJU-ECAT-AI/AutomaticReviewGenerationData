The study utilizes DFT calculations to analyze the interaction of CO2 with ceria (CeO2) (110) surfaces. Oxygen vacancies significantly affect CO2 adsorption energies on these surfaces. The electronic properties of ceria are essential for its catalytic activity in CO2 activation processes. Reduced ceria (110) surfaces, which contain oxygen vacancies, effectively promote CO2 dissociation, demonstrating the importance of surface defects in enhancing catalytic performance.
