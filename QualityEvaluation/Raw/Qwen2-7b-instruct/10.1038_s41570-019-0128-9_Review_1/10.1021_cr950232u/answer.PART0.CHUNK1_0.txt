[1] "Despite these general similarities, the reactivities of carbide-modified surfaces are not identical on all substrate, particularly for the activation of the CH bonds of alkanes. This might be attributed to the differences in the electronic and structural properties of these carbides."
[2] "The strong reactivities of the clean surfaces are passivated on carbide-modified surfaces, although the degree of passivation depends on the specific metal substrate and adsorbate."
[3] "Reactions on carbide-modified surfaces often produce surface intermediates and desorption products that are different from those on the parent metal surfaces."

1. The reactivities of carbide-modified surfaces are not identical on all substrates, particularly for alkane CH bond activation, due to variations in the electronic and structural properties of the carbides.

2. The strong reactivities of clean surfaces are mitigated or 'passivated' on carbide-modified surfaces, with the extent of passivation varying depending on the specific metal substrate and adsorbate.

3. When reactions occur on carbide-modified surfaces, they typically yield different surface intermediates and desorption products compared to those found on the parent metal surfaces.

1. 碳化物修饰表面在所有基质上的反应活性并非完全相同，特别是对于烷烃的CH键活化，这可能归因于碳化物的电子和结构性质的差异。

2. 清洁表面的强烈反应性在碳化物修饰表面上被钝化或“抑制”，钝化程度取决于特定金属基质和吸附剂。

3. 当在碳化物修饰表面上发生反应时，它们通常会产生与父金属表面不同的表面中间体和脱附产物。
