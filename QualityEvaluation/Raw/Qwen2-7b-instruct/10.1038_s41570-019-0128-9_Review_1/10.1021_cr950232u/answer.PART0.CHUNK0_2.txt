[1] "The majority of these studies involved the preparation of thin carbide or nitride layers on the single-crystal surfaces of groups IVBVIB transition metals."
[2] "Comparing to bulk carbide/nitride single crystals, the advantages for choosing carbide/nitride overlayers as model systems are primarily 2-fold: (1) It allows one to directly compare the electronic properties and reactivities of the carbide/nitride overlayers with those of the parent metal surfaces, providing direct information on how the surface properties are modified as a result of carbide/nitride formation. (2) It enables one to readily control the nonmetal/metal stoichiometries and in some cases the structures of the carbide/nitride overlayers, while the crystalline orientations of bulk carbide/nitride single crystals are generally limited, due to experimental difficulties in cleaning procedures, to fcc(100), fcc(110) for carbides, and fcc(100) for nitrides."

The preparation of thin carbide or nitride layers on single-crystal surfaces of groups IVBVIB transition metals offers several advantages over using bulk carbide/nitride single crystals. Firstly, it enables a direct comparison of the electronic properties and reactivities of the carbide/nitride overlayers with those of the parent metal surfaces, thereby providing insights into how the surface properties are altered by carbide/nitride formation. Secondly, it facilitates the control of the nonmetal/metal stoichiometries and, in some cases, the structures of the carbide/nitride overlayers, which is challenging with bulk single crystals due to limitations in cleaning procedures affecting their crystalline orientations.

在IVBVIB族过渡金属单晶表面制备薄碳化物或氮化物层提供了一系列优势，超过使用单晶碳化物或氮化物。首先，它能够直接比较碳化物/氮化物覆层与母金属表面的电子性质和反应性，从而提供关于碳化物/氮化物形成如何改变表面性质的见解。其次，它使控制非金属/金属摩尔比，并在某些情况下控制碳化物/氮化物覆层的结构成为可能，这在单晶碳化物或氮化物由于清洁程序的限制而对其晶向的限制中是具有挑战性的。

[1] "The results shown in Figures 21 suggest that VC/V(110) should be much more effective for the dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons than clean V(110). This is because the carbide overlayer shows an enhancement in the activation of the CH bond of saturated hydrocarbons (reactants in dehydrogenation reactions) and a decrease in the reactivity toward the CC bond of unsaturated molecules (products in dehydrogenation reactions)."

The figures indicate that VC/V(110) is significantly more efficient for the dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons compared to clean V(110). This is due to the carbide overlayer enhancing the activation of the CH bonds in saturated hydrocarbons (which are reactants in dehydrogenation processes) and reducing the reactivity towards the CC bonds in unsaturated molecules (which are products in dehydrogenation reactions).

图中的结果显示，VC/V(110)对于饱和烃的脱氢反应比纯净的V(110)更为有效。这是因为碳化物覆盖层增强了饱和烃（脱氢反应的反应物）中的CH键的活化，并减少了不饱和分子（脱氢反应的产物）中CC键的反应性。
