[1] "Despite these general similarities, the reactivities of carbide-modified surfaces are not identical on all substrate, particularly for the activation of the CH bonds of alkanes. This might be attributed to the differences in the electronic and structural properties of these carbides."
[2] "The strong reactivities of the clean surfaces are passivated on carbide-modified surfaces, although the degree of passivation depends on the specific metal substrate and adsorbate."

1. The reactivities of carbide-modified surfaces are not identical on all substrates, particularly for alkane CH bond activation, due to variations in the electronic and structural properties of the carbides.

2. The strong reactivities of clean surfaces are mitigated or 'passivated' on carbide-modified surfaces, with the extent of passivation varying depending on the specific metal substrate and adsorbate.

3. When reactions occur on carbide-modified surfaces, they typically yield different surface intermediates and desorption products compared to those found on the parent metal surfaces.

[2] "Temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy has been applied to investigate the decomposition mechanisms of formic acid, methanol, formaldehyde, and methyl formate on W(100) and (5×1)-C/W(100)."

[3] "At room temperature, these oxygenate molecules decompose on the clean W(100) surface."

[4] "The formation of carbide passivates the reactivities of W(100) toward the oxygenate molecules, although substantial decomposition still occurs on the carbide-modified surface."

[7] "On the other hand, formaldehyde adsorbs molecularly on the carbide surface at 300 K."

[1] "The results shown in Figures 1517 demonstrate that the decomposition mechanisms of ethylene are qualitatively different on Mo(110) and on carbide modified Mo(110), although the degree of decomposition, as judged from TPD results, is nearly the same on the two types of surfaces."
[2] "The latter observation is somewhat different from ethylene reactions on carbide-modified Mo(100)48 and W(100),72 which concluded that the degree of ethylene decomposition on the carbide-modified surfaces was significantly lower than on the clean surfaces."
[3] "The results shown in Figures 21 suggest that VC/V(110) should be much more effective for the dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons than clean V(110)."
[4] "The enhancement in the activation of CH bond of saturated hydrocarbons on the carbide-modified V(110) surface supports the surface science observations."
[5] "However, the presence of carbide alters the decomposition products of n-butane. As shown in Figure 23, the decomposition product is primarily H2 on clean Mo(100) and on carbide-modified surfaces with low carbon concentrations."
[6] "Despite the change in the reaction products, the amount of n-butane dissociation is not enhanced on the carbide-modified Mo(100) surface."
[7] "The discrepancies between the activation of CH bonds of n-butane on carbide-modified V and Mo demonstrate the complex mechanisms of alkane activation over carbide surfaces."

1. The decomposition processes of ethylene on Mo(110) and carbide-modified Mo(110) are distinct, yet the degree of decomposition as assessed by TPD is comparable. This contrasts with previous findings on carbide-modified Mo(100) and W(100) surfaces, where ethylene decomposition was notably less on the carbide-modified surfaces compared to clean surfaces.

2. The carbide-modified V(110) surface is found to be more efficient in dehydrogenating saturated hydrocarbons than the clean V(110) surface, which aligns with surface science observations. 

3. The presence of carbide modifies the decomposition products of n-butane, primarily resulting in H2 on clean Mo(100) and on carbide-modified surfaces with lower carbon concentrations. However, the amount of n-butane dissociation remains unchanged on the carbide-modified Mo(100) surface.

4. There are complexities in alkane activation over carbide surfaces, as evidenced by the divergent behaviors of n-butane on carbide-modified vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo) surfaces.

The document discusses the decomposition of oxygenate molecules on carbide surfaces, particularly focusing on formic acid, methanol, formaldehyde, and methyl formate. It states that these oxygenates decompose on clean carbide surfaces, albeit with varying degrees of reactivity compared to clean metal surfaces. The presence of carbide layers reduces the reactivity of the underlying metal, but decomposition still occurs. The bonding of these oxygenates on carbide surfaces is influenced by lone pair electrons on the oxygen atoms. Formaldehyde exhibits distinct reaction mechanisms on clean and carbide-modified surfaces, with complete decomposition occurring on clean W(100) surfaces and associative adsorption followed by hydrogenation leading to methane and methanol production on carbide surfaces.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms for CO2-ODH reactions. However, it does describe the behavior of oxygenate molecules on carbide surfaces. For instance, the decomposition of formic acid, methanol, formaldehyde, and methyl formate on W(100) and (5×1)-C/W(100) surfaces is discussed. The presence of a carbide layer reduces the reactivity of the underlying metal surface towards oxygenates, allowing for decomposition to occur even at lower temperatures. This suggests that the formation of a carbide layer can passivate the surface, affecting the catalytic properties for reactions involving oxygenates. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, the literature focuses on the surface chemistry and decomposition mechanisms of oxygenates on carbide surfaces rather than comparing them specifically to vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

Answer: The majority of studies focus on preparing thin carbide or nitride layers on the single-crystal surfaces of groups IVBVIB transition metals. This is done to directly compare the electronic properties and reactivities of carbide or nitride overlayers with those of the parent metal surfaces, thereby understanding how the surface properties are modified as a result of carbide or nitride formation. This approach enables researchers to control the non-metal/metal stoichiometries and, in some cases, the structures of the carbide or nitride overlayers, while the crystalline orientations of bulk carbide or nitride single crystals are often limited due to experimental difficulties in cleaning procedures. The review focuses on discussing the preparation, characterization, and reactivities of carbide and nitride overlayers on the single-crystal surfaces of groups IVBVIB transition metals.

ChineseVersionAnswer:

大多数研究集中在将薄碳化物或氮化物层制备到IVBVIB族过渡金属单晶表面上，以直接比较碳化物或氮化物覆层与母金属表面的电子性质和反应活性。这种方法允许研究人员控制非金属/金属的化学计量比，在某些情况下还可以控制碳化物或氮化物覆层的结构，而整体碳化物或氮化物单晶的晶格取向往往受限于清洗程序的实验困难。本综述主要讨论了将碳化物或氮化物覆层制备到IVBVIB族过渡金属单晶表面上的制备、表征和反应性。
