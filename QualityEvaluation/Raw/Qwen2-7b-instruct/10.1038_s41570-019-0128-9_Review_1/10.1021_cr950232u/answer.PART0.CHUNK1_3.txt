[1] "The reactions of oxygenate molecules on carbide surfaces are crucial in evaluating whether carbide materials can be used as catalysts for partial oxidation of hydrocarbons."
[2] "Temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy has been applied to investigate the decomposition mechanisms of formic acid, methanol, formaldehyde, and methyl formate on W(100) and (5×1)-C/W(100)."
[3] "At room temperature, these oxygenate molecules decompose on the clean W(100) surface. The formation of carbide passivates the reactivities of W(100) toward the oxygenate molecules, although substantial decomposition still occurs on the carbide-modified surface."
[4] "In general, methanol, formaldehyde, and methyl formate were bonded on the (5×1)-C/Mo(100) surface in a similar fashion, most likely through the lone-pair electrons on the oxygen atoms."
[5] "For example, Table 4 summarizes the different reaction mechanisms of formaldehyde on W(100) and (5×1)-C/W(100)."
[6] "The general trends in the reactions of oxygenate molecules are (1) the carbide surfaces are still relatively reactive to the decomposition of oxygenate molecules and (2) the formation of carbide favors hydrocarbon molecules as reaction products."

These quotes discuss the decomposition mechanisms of various oxygenate molecules on carbide surfaces, specifically focusing on the differences in reactivity between clean and carbide-modified surfaces. They also highlight the role of carbides in facilitating the decomposition of oxygenates and their preference for producing hydrocarbon molecules as reaction products. The formation of carbides seems to reduce the reactivity of the underlying metal surface towards oxygenates, yet the carbide surfaces remain active in decomposing these molecules. Formaldehyde, methanol, and methyl formate are mentioned as examples of oxygenates that are studied for their reactions on carbide surfaces.

这些引文讨论了各种氧原子分子在碳化物表面的分解机制，特别是关注清洁表面与碳化物修饰表面之间的反应性差异。它们还强调了碳化物在分解氧原子分子中的作用，并指出碳化物倾向于产生烃类分子作为反应产物。碳化物的形成似乎减少了基础金属表面对于氧原子分子的活性，但碳化物表面仍能有效分解这些分子。甲醛、甲醇和甲基甲酸酯被提到作为研究在碳化物表面上反应的例子。
