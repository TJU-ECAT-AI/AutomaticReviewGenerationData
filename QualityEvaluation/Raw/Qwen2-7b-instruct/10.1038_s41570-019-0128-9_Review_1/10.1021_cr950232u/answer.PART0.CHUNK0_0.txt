The literature discusses the preparation, characterization, and reactivities of carbide and nitride overlayers on single-crystal surfaces of early transition metals. The aim is to provide background information and motivation for studying the chemical reactivities of these materials. The properties of bulk carbides and nitrides, preparation procedures, thermal stabilities, electronic properties, and reactivities are reviewed in sections II through V, respectively. The sections collectively offer insights into the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of carbide and nitride materials, their preparation methods, and their interactions with organic molecules.
