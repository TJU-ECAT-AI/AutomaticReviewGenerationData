[1] "The reactions of oxygenates on carbide surfaces are crucial for evaluating the use of carbide materials as catalysts for partial oxidation of hydrocarbons."

[2] "Temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy has been applied to investigate the decomposition mechanisms of formic acid, methanol, formaldehyde, and methyl formate on W(100) and (5×1)-C/W(100)."

[3] "At room temperature, these oxygenate molecules decompose on the clean W(100) surface."

[4] "The formation of carbide passivates the reactivities of W(100) toward the oxygenate molecules, although substantial decomposition still occurs on the carbide-modified surface."

[5] "In general, methanol, formaldehyde, and methyl formate were bonded on the (5×1)-C/Mo(100) surface in a similar fashion, most likely through the lone-pair electrons on the oxygen atoms."

[6] "For example, Table 4 summarizes the different reaction mechanisms of formaldehyde on W(100) and (5×1)-C/W(100)."

[7] "On the other hand, formaldehyde adsorbs molecularly on the carbide surface at 300 K."

[8] "The decomposition mechanisms on (5×1)-C/W(100) is further complicated because the adsorbed formaldehyde molecules can also react among themselves to produce methyl formate or react with surface oxygen to produce surface formate."

[9] "Overall, the general trends in the reactions of oxygenate molecules are (1) the carbide surfaces are still relatively reactive to the decomposition of oxygenate molecules and (2) the formation of carbide favors hydrocarbon molecules as reaction products."

[10] "A fundamental understanding of the reactions of carbide/nitride overlayers with sulfur- and nitrogen-containing organic molecules is of practical importance since it provides information on the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) activities of these catalysts."

[11] "It was found that the HDS of thiophene to C4 hydrocarbons (1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, and n-butane) and H2S can be catalyzed by Mo2C powder catalysts."

[12] "One of the important observations in Figure 24 is that the peak area of the H2 desorption peak at 690 K shows an increase on the carbide-modified surfaces."

[13] "Although the above two examples demonstrate that the CS and CN bonds can be dissociated on the carbide-modified surfaces, more detailed investigations are needed for an overall understanding of the HDS and HDN mechanisms on these surfaces."

[14] "Despite these general similarities, the reactivities of carbide-modified surfaces are not identical on all substrate, particularly for the activation of the CH bonds of alkanes."

[15] "This might be attributed to the differences in the electronic and structural properties of these carbides."

[16] "A more detailed understanding of the structural information, especially the locations of carbon atoms and the local carbon/metal stoichiometries should provide insightful information on the differences in the reactivities."

[17] "Finally, the differences in the reactivities of carbide- and nitride-modified Mo(110) surfaces demonstrate that the presence of carbon and nitrogen atoms in the subsurface/interstitial sites is critical for the modeling of the reactivities of bulk carbide and nitride materials."
