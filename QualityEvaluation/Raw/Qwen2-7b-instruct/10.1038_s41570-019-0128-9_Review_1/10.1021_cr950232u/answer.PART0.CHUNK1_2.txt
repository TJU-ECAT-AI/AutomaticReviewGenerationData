The document discusses the decomposition of oxygenate molecules on carbide surfaces, particularly focusing on formic acid, methanol, formaldehyde, and methyl formate. It states that these oxygenates decompose on clean carbide surfaces, albeit with varying degrees of reactivity compared to clean metal surfaces. The presence of carbide layers reduces the reactivity of the underlying metal, but decomposition still occurs. The bonding of these oxygenates on carbide surfaces is influenced by lone pair electrons on the oxygen atoms. Formaldehyde exhibits distinct reaction mechanisms on clean and carbide-modified surfaces, with complete decomposition occurring on clean W(100) surfaces and associative adsorption followed by hydrogenation leading to methane and methanol production on carbide surfaces.

文献讨论了碳化物表面上氧化合物的分解，特别是对甲酸、甲醇、甲醛和甲基甲酸盐。它指出这些氧化剂在干净的碳化物表面上分解，但与金属表面的反应活性存在差异。碳化层减少了底层金属的活性，但分解仍然发生。这些氧化合物在碳化物表面的结合受到氧原子孤对电子的影响。甲醛在干净的W(100)表面完全分解，在碳化物修饰的表面上则经历吸附和氢化，产生甲烷和甲醇。
