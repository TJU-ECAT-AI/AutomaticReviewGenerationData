[1] "The majority of these studies involves the preparation of thin carbide or nitride layers on the single-crystal surfaces of groups IVBVIB transition metals."
[2] "Comparing to bulk carbide/nitride single crystals, the advantages for choosing carbide/nitride overlayers as model systems are primarily 2-fold: (1) It allows one to directly compare the electronic properties and reactivities of the carbide/nitride overlayers with those of the parent metal surfaces, providing direct information on how the surface properties are modified as a result of carbide/nitride formation. (2) It enables one to readily control the nonmetal/metal stoichiometries and in some cases the structures of the carbide/nitride overlayers, while the crystalline orientations of bulk carbide/nitride single crystals are generally limited, due to experimental difficulties in cleaning procedures, to fcc(100), fcc(110) for carbides, and fcc(100) for nitrides."

The preparation of thin carbide or nitride layers on single-crystal surfaces of groups IVBVIB transition metals offers several advantages over using bulk carbide/nitride single crystals. Firstly, it allows for direct comparisons between the electronic properties and reactivities of the carbide/nitride overlayers and their parent metal surfaces, providing insights into how the surface properties change due to carbide/nitride formation. Secondly, it facilitates easier control over the nonmetal/metal stoichiometries and, in some cases, the structures of the carbide/nitride overlayers, overcoming limitations in achieving uniform orientations in bulk carbide/nitride single crystals due to experimental challenges in cleaning processes.

在组IVBVIB过渡金属单晶表面制备碳化物或氮化物薄层提供了一系列优势，与使用纯碳化物/氮化物单晶体相比。首先，它允许直接比较碳化物/氮化物覆盖层与母金属表面的电子性质和反应性，提供有关由于碳化物/氮化物形成导致表面性质变化的见解。其次，它使更容易控制非金属/金属组成，并且在某些情况下，覆盖层的结构，克服了由于清洁过程实验挑战而实现均匀晶体取向的限制在纯碳化物/氮化物单晶体中。
