The literature does not provide direct comparisons between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms for CO2-ODH reactions. However, it does describe the behavior of oxygenate molecules on carbide surfaces. For instance, the decomposition of formic acid, methanol, formaldehyde, and methyl formate on W(100) and (5×1)-C/W(100) surfaces is discussed. The presence of a carbide layer reduces the reactivity of the underlying metal surface towards oxygenates, allowing for decomposition to occur even at lower temperatures. This suggests that the formation of a carbide layer can passivate the surface, affecting the catalytic properties for reactions involving oxygenates. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, the literature focuses on the surface chemistry and decomposition mechanisms of oxygenates on carbide surfaces rather than comparing them specifically to vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

文献没有直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和二氧化钒催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和反应机理。但是，文献描述了氧原子分子在碳化物表面的行为。例如，讨论了甲醛、甲醇、甲醛和甲基甲醛在W(100)和(5×1)-C/W(100)表面上的分解机制。碳化层的存在可以钝化底层金属表面的活性，即使在较低温度下仍能发生氧原子分子的分解。这表明碳化层的形成可以钝化表面，影响含氧化合物反应的催化性质。对于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，文献主要关注碳化物表面的表面化学和氧原子分子的分解机制，而不是特别比较它们与二氧化钒催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的性能。
