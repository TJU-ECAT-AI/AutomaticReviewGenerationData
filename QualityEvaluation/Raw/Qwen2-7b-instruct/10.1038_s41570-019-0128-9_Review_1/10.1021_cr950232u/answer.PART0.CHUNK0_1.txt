[1] "The results shown in Figures 1517 demonstrate that the decomposition mechanisms of ethylene are qualitatively different on Mo(110) and on carbide modified Mo(110), although the degree of decomposition, as judged from TPD results, is nearly the same on the two types of surfaces."
[2] "The latter observation is somewhat different from ethylene reactions on carbide-modified Mo(100)48 and W(100),72 which concluded that the degree of ethylene decomposition on the carbide-modified surfaces was significantly lower than on the clean surfaces."
[3] "The results shown in Figures 21 suggest that VC/V(110) should be much more effective for the dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons than clean V(110)."
[4] "The enhancement in the activation of CH bond of saturated hydrocarbons on the carbide-modified V(110) surface supports the surface science observations."
[5] "However, the presence of carbide alters the decomposition products of n-butane. As shown in Figure 23, the decomposition product is primarily H2 on clean Mo(100) and on carbide-modified surfaces with low carbon concentrations."
[6] "Despite the change in the reaction products, the amount of n-butane dissociation is not enhanced on the carbide-modified Mo(100) surface."
[7] "The discrepancies between the activation of CH bonds of n-butane on carbide-modified V and Mo demonstrate the complex mechanisms of alkane activation over carbide surfaces."

1. The decomposition processes of ethylene on Mo(110) and carbide-modified Mo(110) are distinct, yet the degree of decomposition as assessed by TPD is comparable. This contrasts with previous findings on carbide-modified Mo(100) and W(100) surfaces, where ethylene decomposition was notably less on the carbide-modified surfaces compared to clean surfaces.

2. The carbide-modified V(110) surface is found to be more efficient in dehydrogenating saturated hydrocarbons than the clean V(110) surface, which aligns with surface science observations. 

3. The presence of carbide modifies the decomposition products of n-butane, primarily resulting in H2 on clean Mo(100) and on carbide-modified surfaces with lower carbon concentrations. However, the amount of n-butane dissociation remains unchanged on the carbide-modified Mo(100) surface.

4. There are complexities in alkane activation over carbide surfaces, as evidenced by the divergent behaviors of n-butane on carbide-modified vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo) surfaces.

1. 乙烯在Mo(110)和碳化物修饰的Mo(110)上的分解过程存在差异，但通过TPD评估的分解程度相似。这与在碳化物修饰的Mo(100)和W(100)表面发现的乙烯分解明显较少的情况形成对比。

2. 碳化物修饰的V(110)表面在脱氢饱和烃方面比清洁的V(110)表面更有效，这与表面科学观察相吻合。

3. 在碳化物的存在下，n-丁烷的分解产物发生变化，主要为H2在清洁的Mo(100)表面上以及在碳浓度较低的碳化物修饰表面上。然而，在碳化物修饰的Mo(100)表面上，n-丁烷的分解量没有增加。

4. 碳化物表面在烷烃活化方面的复杂机制，体现在n-丁烷在碳化物修饰的钒(V)和钼(Mo)表面之间的不同行为上。
