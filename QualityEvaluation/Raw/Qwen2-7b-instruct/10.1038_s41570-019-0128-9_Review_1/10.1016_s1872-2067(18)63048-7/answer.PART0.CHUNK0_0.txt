The nVMCM41 catalysts were prepared by onestep hydrothermal synthesis and applied to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in the presence of CO2. Several stateoftheart charactherization methods were performed to explore the correlation between catalytic performance and the physicochemical characterizations of the catalysts. 

The 6.8VMCM41 (V content 6.8 wt%) catalyst exhibits high activity and stability, and the C3H8/CO2 molar ratio (1:4) was suitable. 

The promoting effect of CO2 on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ODHP was demonstrated as the reaction coupling mechanism and lattice oxygen mechanism. 

The reaction mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 includes a reaction coupling mechanism and a lattice oxygen mechanism, which can be expressed as the reaction coupling of simple propane dehydorgenation with the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction and the lattice oxygen of isolated tetrahedral VO43. 

The regeneration performance of the 6.8VMCM41 catalyst is good. After the reactionregeneration study with four cycles, the catalyst still shows good reactivity.
