[1] "The 6.8VMCM41 catalyst exhibits high activity and stability, and the C3H8/CO2 molar ratio (1:4) was suitable."
[2] "It is worth mentioning that the nVMCM41 catalyst performs very well even after four oxidative regenerations."
[3] "The reason that the highest catalytic activity of 6.8VMCM41 has a high degree of dispersion of isolated VO43 has been verified by Raman and XPS analysis."
[4] "It is clear that the 6.8VMCM41 catalyst exhibits much higher C3H8 conversion and propene selectivity than mesoporous, traditional silica-supported VOx catalysts."
[5] "The regeneration performance also benefits from the superior thermal stability of the nVMCM41 mesoporous silica framework, which has been proved by TG analysis."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The 6.8VMCM41 catalyst demonstrates high activity and stability in the CO2-ODH reaction, with optimal results at a C3H8/CO2 molar ratio of 1:4. This catalyst maintains its performance even after four oxidative regenerations. High dispersion of isolated VO43 is a key factor contributing to its superior catalytic activity. Compared to mesoporous, traditional silica-supported VOx catalysts, 6.8VMCM41 shows significantly higher conversion of C3H8 and selectivity for propene. The catalyst's remarkable performance is further bolstered by its inherent thermal stability, which is evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis.

6.8VMCM41催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中表现出高活性和稳定性，最适合的C3H8/CO2摩尔比为1:4。即使经过四次氧化再生后，该催化剂仍能保持其性能。孤立的VO43高度分散是其优异催化活性的关键因素。与传统的介孔硅基VOx催化剂相比，6.8VMCM41显示出更高的C3H8转化率和丙烯选择性。该催化剂的出色性能还得到了其固有的热稳定性的增强，这是通过热重分析证明的。
