[1] "The reaction mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 includes a reaction coupling mechanism [52,53] and a lattice oxygen mechanism [54,55], which can be expressed as the reaction coupling of simple propane dehy drogenation with the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction and the lattice oxygen of isolated tetrahedral VO43."
[2] "It has been suggested that metal species of octahedrally coordinated V2O5 have low activity in the dehydrogenation reaction because of the lack of free coordination sites [24]."
[3] "The 6.8VMCM41 catalyst exhibits much higher C3H8 conversion and propene selectivity than mesoporous, traditional sili casupported VOx catalysts."
[4] "As can be seen from Fig. 14, propane conversion and propene selectivity significantly increase in the presence of CO2. With increasing CO2/C3H8 ratios, propane conversion increases gradually, while propene selectivity exhibits almost no variation."
[5] "After the reactionregeneration study with four cycles, the catalyst still shows good reactivity. Propane conversion and propene selectivity are almost the same as the initial reactions because the lattice oxygen of isolated VO43 is almost completely restored after regeneration by O2 at 550 C."

1. The reaction mechanism for CO2-ODH involves a reaction coupling mechanism and a lattice oxygen mechanism, combining simple propane dehydrogenation with the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction and the lattice oxygen of isolated tetrahedral VO43. Octahedrally coordinated V2O5 has low activity in dehydrogenation reactions due to lacking free coordination sites.

2. The 6.8VMCM41 catalyst demonstrates superior activity and selectivity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to traditional silica-supported VOx catalysts.

3. The presence of CO2 leads to a significant increase in propane conversion and propene selectivity. As the CO2/C3H8 ratio increases, propane conversion rises gradually while propene selectivity remains relatively constant.

4. After undergoing four regeneration cycles, the catalyst retains its reactivity. Propane conversion and propene selectivity remain comparable to initial conditions, as the lattice oxygen of isolated VO43 is fully restored through regeneration at 550°C with oxygen.

1. CO2-ODH反应机制包括反应耦合机制和晶格氧机制，将简单丙烷脱氢与逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应以及孤立四面体VO43的晶格氧结合在一起。八面体配合的V2O5在脱氢反应中活性较低，因为缺乏自由配位点。

2. 6.8VMCM41催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的活性和选择性显著优于传统二氧化硅支持的VOx催化剂。

3. CO2的存在导致丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性显著增加。随着CO2/C3H8比例的增加，丙烷转化率逐渐上升，而丙烯选择性基本不变。

4. 经过四次再生周期后，催化剂保持其活性。丙烷转化率和丙烯选择率与初始条件相似，因为通过550°C氧气再生，孤立VO43的晶格氧完全恢复。
