1. Studies involving oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes have been reported with oxidants like O2, N2O, and CO2. CO2 promotes the ODH of propane through reaction coupling and lattice oxygen mechanisms.
2. The nVMCM41 catalysts were synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method, utilizing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as silica source and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a template.
3. Ordered mesoporous materials feature a large specific surface area, enabling efficient dispersion of active sites, and a uniform pore size within the mesoporous range facilitates the diffusion of bulky molecules.
4. The 6.8VMCM41 catalyst, containing 6.8 wt% vanadium, demonstrates high activity and stability in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with an optimal propane-to-CO2 molar ratio of 1:4.
5. The nVMCM41 catalyst retains its performance even after undergoing four cycles of oxidative regeneration.

1. 近期有大量关于轻烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）研究，使用如O2、N2O和CO2作为氧化剂。CO2通过反应耦合机制和晶格氧机制促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢。
2. nVMCM41催化剂通过一步水热合成方法制备而成，以四乙氧基硅酸酯（TEOS）为硅源，十六烷基三甲基溴化铵（CTAB）为模板。
3. 有序介孔材料具有较大的比表面积，可有效分散活性位点，并且在介孔范围内均匀的孔径有利于大分子的扩散。
4. 含有6.8 wt%钒的6.8VMCM41催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中表现出高活性和稳定性，最优的丙烷与CO2摩尔比为1:4。
5. nVMCM41催化剂即使经过四次氧化再生后仍能保持良好的性能。
