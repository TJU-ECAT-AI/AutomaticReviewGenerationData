[1] "The aim of this work is to synthesize and characterize nVMCM41 mesoporous molecular sieves and investigate the effects of different V amounts in ODHP in the presence of CO2."
[2] "The nVMCM41 catalysts were prepared by a onestep hydrothermal method using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica source and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the template."
[3] "Because moderate amounts of V species were introduced into the framework of MCM41, the catalyst maintained a large specific surface area, a highly ordered mesoporous structure, and highly dispersed V active sites (monomeric and dimeric V oxide species), while the highvanadiumdoping catalysts caused an enhancement in the number of acidic sites and V2O5 crystallites."
[4] "The 6.8VMCM41 (V content 6.8 wt%) catalyst exhibits high activity and stability, and the C3H8/CO2 molar ratio (1:4) was suitable."
[5] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ODHP was demonstrated as the reaction coupling mechanism and lattice oxygen mechanism."
[6] "The 6.8VMCM41 catalyst exhibits highly active and stable catalytic performance for ODHP, which is due to the high dispersion of isolated VO43."
[7] "However, upon further increasing the V loading (8.8 and 10.6 wt%), the number of acidic sites and V2O5 crystallites increases, which reduces the reaction activity."
[8] "It is worth mentioning that the nVMCM41 catalyst performs very well even after four oxidative regenerations."

1. The research aimed to synthesize and characterize nVMCM41 mesoporous molecular sieves and examine the impact of various vanadium (V) amounts on propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) in the presence of CO2.
2. The nVMCM41 catalysts were produced through a one-step hydrothermal process utilizing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica source and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the template.
3. The introduction of V species into the MCM41 framework resulted in a catalyst maintaining a substantial specific surface area, an orderly mesoporous structure, and dispersed V active sites (monomeric and dimeric V oxide species). High V doping led to an increase in acidic sites and V2O5 crystallite numbers.
4. The 6.8VMCM41 catalyst, containing 6.8 wt% V, demonstrated high activity and stability in the ODHP process. The optimal C3H8/CO2 molar ratio was 1:4.
5. The use of CO2 in the ODHP process had a promotional effect, manifested through the reaction coupling mechanism and lattice oxygen mechanism.
6. The 6.8VMCM41 catalyst showed outstanding catalytic performance for ODHP, primarily due to the high dispersion of isolated VO43.
7. Further increments in V loading (8.8 and 10.6 wt%) led to an increase in acidic sites and V2O5 crystallites, which diminished the reaction activity.
8. Remarkably, the nVMCM41 catalyst maintained excellent activity even after four cycles of oxidative regeneration.

1. 研究的目标是合成并表征nVMCM41分子筛，并研究不同量的V在CO2存在下对丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的影响。
2. nVMCM41催化剂通过一步水热法合成，以四乙氧基硅酸酯（TEOS）为硅源和十六烷基三甲基溴化铵（CTAB）为模板。
3. 将V物种引入MCM41框架后，催化剂保持了较大的比表面、有序的介孔结构和分散的V活性位点（单体和二聚体V氧化物种）。高V掺杂导致酸性位点和V2O5晶粒数量增加。
4. 含有6.8 wt% V的6.8VMCM41催化剂在ODHP过程中表现出高活性和稳定性。最佳的C3H8/CO2摩尔比为1:4。
5. CO2在ODHP过程中的使用促进了反应耦合机制和晶格氧机制。
6. 6.8VMCM41催化剂在ODHP中显示出卓越的催化性能，主要原因是高度分散的VO43。
7. 进一步增加V负载（8.8和10.6 wt%）导致酸性位点和V2O5晶粒数量增加，从而降低了反应活性。
8. 值得一提的是，nVMCM41催化剂即使经过四次氧化再生后仍能保持良好的活性。
