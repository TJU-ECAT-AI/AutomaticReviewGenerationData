[1] "For example, for hydrogen production, the reaction cycle for the metal oxide MO2, where M represents Ce and often also a dopant element, can be described as follows."
[2] "The specific reactions employed were TH : Fe3O4 3FeO + 1 2O2(g)"
[3] "An analogous reaction cycle can be written for CO2 reduction,where thermodynamics predicts that the product will be CO rather than C(graphite) when the lower-temperature step is carried out at sufficiently high temperatures."
[4] "The governing reaction establishing the oxygen non-stoichiometry is the equilibration of ceria and gas-phase oxygen, i.e. the redox reaction,"
[5] "The oxygen enthalpy and entropy measured as a function of oxygen non-stoichiometry (Panlener et al. 1975) were interpolated using appropriate exponential or polynomial functions."
[6] "The computed thermodynamic HHV efficiency for the supported nickel ferrite cycle operating between 1673 K and 1273 K is approximately 24 per cent (obtained by the same methodology as in this work),"

These quotes provide insights into the reaction cycles for producing hydrogen and CO2 reduction using metal oxides, the redox reaction that establishes oxygen non-stoichiometry in ceria, and the thermodynamic analysis of the efficiency of various metal oxide cycles. They describe the specific reactions for hydrogen production involving metal oxides like Fe3O4, the prediction of CO as the product of CO2 reduction under certain conditions, and the use of interpolating functions to determine oxygen enthalpy and entropy. Additionally, they mention the efficiency of a nickel ferrite cycle operating between 1673 K and 1273 K, which is around 24%.

这些引文提供了使用金属氧化物产生氢气和CO2还原的反应循环的见解，以及在铈中建立氧非化学计量性的还原氧化反应。它们描述了氢生产过程中涉及金属氧化物（如Fe3O4）的具体反应，CO2还原在特定条件下预测为CO而非石墨的情况，以及使用插值函数来确定氧的热焓和熵的方法。此外，它们还提到了在1673 K和1273 K之间运行的镍铁氧体循环的效率大约为24%。

Since the questions are not provided, I am unable to extract specific quotes or answer the questions directly. However, based on the context, these quotes cover aspects of the reaction mechanisms, thermodynamics, and efficiency analysis of metal oxide cycles, particularly focusing on ceria and iron oxides.
