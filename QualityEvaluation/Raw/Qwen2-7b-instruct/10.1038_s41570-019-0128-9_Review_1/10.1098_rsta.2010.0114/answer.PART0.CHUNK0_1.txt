[1] "The most important figures of merit are the fuel productivity (which determines the amount of reaction medium required and thereby the size of the solar thermochemical power plant, and also influences the efficiency), the fuel production rate (which determines how quickly the cycles can be performed, influencing both the size of the power plant and the efficiency), and the thermodynamic efficiency (computed as described above on the assumption of reversible kinetics). Moreover, the overall ease of implementing the cycling strategy is an additional factor requiring consideration."
[2] "On first inspection, a non-stoichiometric metal oxide thermochemical cycle might be expected to display a relatively low fuel productivity because of the relatively small change in gravimetric oxygen content between the high and low temperatures of the cycles. The productivity values obtained here for hydrogen are of the order of 912 ml g1 (depending on the specific cycling strategy employed)."
[3] "In contrast, stoichiometric cycles such as FeO/Fe3O4 and Zn(g)/ZnO offer theoretical fuel productivities of 97 and 275 ml g1, respectively. In practice,however, these productivity values have not been demonstrated."
[4] "Because use of a redox-inactive support is required in order to achieve cyclability and reasonable kinetics in the ferrites, the gravimetric fuel productivity of the composite system is dramatically reduced, with an experimental value of 12.2 ml g1 (TH = 1673 K, TL = 1073 K) having been reported for 20 wt% NiFe2O4/ZrO2 (Kodama & Gokon 2007)."
[5] "Furthermore, because of the low oxygen diffusivity through the stoichiometric phases (tracer diffusion coefficient approx. 1011 cm2 s1 at 1473 K) (OBryan & DiMarcello 1970), even when the ferrite is supported on zirconia the fuel production rates are rather low."
[6] "For example, a hydrogen production rate of approximately 101 ml min1 g1 at 1273 K (pH2O = 0.42 atm) has been reported for 20 wt% NiFe2O4/ZrO2 (Kodama & Gokon 2007), significantly lower than the rate demonstrated here."
[7] "Beyond suitability for a single solar-thermal reactor, it is important to consider the potential scalability of any thermochemical reaction medium to address world energy demands."
[8] "Though a rare-earth element, cerium is in fact as similarly abundant as copper (Haxel et al. 2002), and the worldwide reserve of cerium oxide is of the order of 107 tonnes (Hedrick 2007)."
[9] "Based on a fuel productivity of 8 × 103 l of H2(g) per tonne of CeO2 per cycle, and running 100 cycles per day,approximately 5 × 102 tonnes are required to construct a 100 MW fuel-cell-based power plant2 that operates for 6 h d1 (600 MWh capacity)."

1. Fuel productivity, production rate, thermodynamic efficiency, and ease of cycle operation are key factors in evaluating the suitability of a material for a solar-thermal reactor. The productivity values for hydrogen obtained in this study are around 912 ml g1, depending on the specific cycling strategy employed. 
2. Stoichiometric cycles like FeO/Fe3O4 and Zn(g)/ZnO theoretically offer higher fuel productivities of 97 and 275 ml g1, respectively, but these values have not been practically demonstrated.
3. In composite systems using ferrites as the active component, the use of a redox-inactive support to achieve cyclability and reasonable kinetics leads to a significantly reduced gravimetric fuel productivity, with an experimental value of 12.2 ml g1 reported for 20 wt% NiFe2O4/ZrO2.
4. The low oxygen diffusivity through the stoichiometric phases, with a tracer diffusion coefficient of approximately 10^-11 cm^2 s^-1 at 1473 K, results in low fuel production rates, even when the ferrite is supported on zirconia.
5. A hydrogen production rate of about 101 ml min^-1 g^-1 at 1273 K (pH2O = 0.42 atm) has been reported for 20 wt% NiFe2O4/ZrO2, which is notably lower than the rate demonstrated in this study.
6. Considering scalability, cerium is as abundant as copper and the global reserve of cerium oxide is estimated to be around 10^7 tonnes. 
7. Approximately 5 × 10^2 tonnes of ceria are required to construct a 100 MW fuel-cell-based power plant operating for 6 hours per day, based on a fuel productivity of 8 × 10^3 l of H2(g) per tonne of ceria per cycle and 100 cycles per day.

1. 燃料生产力、生产率、热力学效率和循环策略的易实施性是评估太阳能热反应器材料适用性的关键因素。在本研究中获得的氢燃料生产力约为每克氧化铈912毫升，具体取决于循环策略的采用。
2. 如铁氧体这样的等电子化合物理论上能提供更高的燃料生产力，分别为每克氧化铈97毫升和275毫升，但这些数值并未在实践中被证明。
3. 在使用铁氧体作为活性成分的复合系统中，通过使用一个红氧化不活性支持物来实现循环能力和合理的动力学性能导致了显著降低的克级燃料生产力，对于20%的NiFe2O4/ZrO2，实验值为每克氧化铈12.2毫升。
4. 等电子化合物的氧扩散性低，当铁氧体支持在锆酸盐上时，导致较低的燃料生产率，其推断的扩散系数为大约10^-11厘米^2秒^-1在1473开尔文。
5. 在1273开尔文（pH2O = 0.42大气压）下，关于20%的NiFe2O4/ZrO2报告的氢生产率为每分钟每克101毫升，这明显低于本研究中展示的速率。
6. 考虑到可扩展性，铈与铜一样丰富，全球铈氧化物储量估计为10^7吨。
7. 根据每吨铈氧化物每循环周期产生8 × 10^3升H2(g)的生产力和每天100个循环，构建一个100兆瓦燃料电池为基础的发电厂需要大约5 × 10^2吨铈。
