[1] "Despite the non-stoichiometric nature of the redox cycle, in which only a portion of the cerium atoms change their oxidation state, the fuel productivity of 8.511.8 ml of H2 per gram of ceria is competitive with that of other solid-state thermochemical cycles currently under investigation."
[2] "We observe gravimetric fuel productivity that is in quantitative agreement with equilibrium, thermogravimetric studies of ceria."
[3] "The fuel production rate, which is also highly attractive, at a rate of 4.66.2 ml of H2 per minute per gram of ceria, is found to be limited by a surface-reaction step rather than by ambipolar bulk diffusion of oxygen through the solid ceria."
[4] "An evaluation of the thermodynamic efficiency of the ceria-based thermochemical cycle suggests that, even in the absence of heat recovery, solar-to-fuel conversion efficiencies of 16 to 19 per cent can be achieved,assuming a suitable method for obtaining an inert atmosphere for the oxygen release step."

The ceria-based thermochemical cycle demonstrates a fuel productivity of 8.511.8 ml of H2 per gram of ceria, which is competitive with other solid-state cycles. This productivity aligns quantitatively with equilibrium thermogravimetric studies. The fuel production rate reaches 4.66.2 ml of H2 per minute per gram of ceria, limited by a surface-reaction step rather than bulk diffusion. The thermodynamic analysis indicates that, without heat recovery, solar-to-fuel conversion efficiencies of 16 to 19 per cent could be achieved with proper methods for oxygen release.

该铈基热化学循环显示出每克铈8.511.8毫升的燃料生产力，这与其他固体状态循环具有竞争力。这种生产力与等温热重分析结果一致。每分钟每克铈产生4.66.2毫升H2，受限于表面反应步骤而不是通过固体铈的电荷扩散。热力学分析表明，在没有热量回收的情况下，如果采用适当的方法获取氧气释放步骤所需的惰性气氛，则可以实现16至19％的太阳能到燃料转换效率。
