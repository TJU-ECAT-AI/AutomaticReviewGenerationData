[1] "The most important figures of merit are the fuel productivity (which determines the amount of reaction medium required and thereby the size of the solar thermochemical power plant, and also influences the efficiency), the fuel production rate (which determines how quickly the cycles can be performed, influencing both the size of the power plant and the efficiency), and the thermodynamic efficiency (computed as described above on the assumption of reversible kinetics). Moreover, the overall ease of implementing the cycling strategy is an additional factor requiring consideration."
[2] "On first inspection, a non-stoichiometric metal oxide thermochemical cycle might be expected to display a relatively low fuel productivity because of the relatively small change in gravimetric oxygen content between the high and low temperatures of the cycles. The productivity values obtained here for hydrogen are of the order of 912 ml g−1 (depending on the specific cycling strategy employed)."
[3] "The computed thermodynamic HHV efficiency for the supported nickel ferrite cycle operating between 1673 K and 1273 K is approximately 24 per cent (obtained by the same methodology as in this work), with the heating of the zirconia as the main energy penalty."

The evaluation of ceria's thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics indicates its attractiveness as a thermochemical reaction medium. Compared to other materials, ceria offers notable benefits such as high fuel productivity, production rate, and thermodynamic efficiency. Its high abundance makes it suitable for addressing global energy demands. However, challenges include high operational temperatures and managing the energy penalty of using gases with low oxygen partial pressure. Targeted doping strategies could optimize ceria's performance by modifying the enthalpy and entropy terms of the redox reaction, potentially improving the oxygen non-stoichiometry's sensitivity to oxygen partial pressure and temperature.
