[1] "The results revealed an almost linear relationship between the activity and surface vanadium sites."
[2] "Isolated vanadium species were more active for iso-butane dehydrogenation."
[3] "The iso-butane dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2 could proceed simultaneously via oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."

The document discusses the synthesis of V-MCM-41 catalysts and their application in CO2-assisted isobutane dehydrogenation. It is highlighted that there is an almost linear relationship between the catalyst's activity and the surface vanadium sites. Isolated vanadium species demonstrate higher activity compared to other forms in the dehydrogenation process. Moreover, the reaction proceeds via both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction when CO2 is used as a soft oxidant.

文献讨论了V-MCM-41催化剂的合成及其在CO2辅助异丁烷脱氢的应用。指出催化剂活性与表面钒物种数量之间存在几乎线性关系。孤立的钒物种在脱氢过程中的活性较高。此外，反应通过氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢途径进行，随后是水煤气逆向反应，当使用CO2作为软氧化剂时。
