[1] "Vanadium containing mesoporous siliceous catalysts were demonstrated to be active for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[2] "It is widely acknowledged that the catalytic performance of the vanadium based catalyst was largely determined by the valance state and form of the vanadium species."
[3] "Many researchers had proved that V3+ showed a close relationship with the catalysts activity."
[4] "Compared with the traditional impregnation method, vanadium species were more evenly distributed and less likely to aggregate on catalysts derived from in situ synthesized method."

The document discusses the synthesis and application of V-MCM-41 catalysts in CO2-assisted isobutane dehydrogenation. These catalysts are characterized by their ability to maintain mesoporous structure and high specific surface area, along with well-dispersed vanadium species on the surface. The presence of both isolated vanadium species and polymeric vanadium species contributes to their enhanced catalytic activity. The study reveals that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds via oxidative and non-oxidative pathways, facilitated by CO2 as a soft oxidant. The catalysts show improved performance compared to traditional methods due to the even distribution of vanadium species, which reduces aggregation and enhances the reaction efficiency.

本文讨论了在CO2辅助下进行异丁烷脱氢的V-MCM-41催化剂的合成与应用。这些催化剂保持了介孔结构和高比表面积，并且表面分布着分散良好的钒物种。存在的孤立钒物种和聚集体钒物种共同促进了其催化活性。研究发现，脱氢反应通过氧化和非氧化途径进行，由CO2作为软氧化剂促进。催化剂的性能优于传统方法，由于钒物种的均匀分布减少了聚集，提高了反应效率。
