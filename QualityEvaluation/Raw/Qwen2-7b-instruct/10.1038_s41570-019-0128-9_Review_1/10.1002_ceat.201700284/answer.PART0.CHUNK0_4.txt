The synthesis of V-MCM-41 catalysts involves using methanol as a medium to combine an organic vanadium precursor with a silica source. The valence state and form of vanadium species significantly influence the catalytic performance of vanadium-based catalysts. Research indicates that vanadium trivalent ions (V3+) have a close relationship with catalyst activity. The in situ synthesis of these catalysts results in more even distribution of vanadium species, reducing aggregation compared to traditional impregnation methods.

本文中，使用甲醇作为介质，结合有机钒前体与硅源。钒物种的价态和形态显著影响基于钒催化剂的催化性能。研究表明，三价钒（V3+）与催化剂活性之间存在密切关系。原位合成这些催化剂能够实现更均匀的钒物种分布，减少与传统浸渍方法相比的聚集现象。
