The study highlights the synthesis of V-MCM-41 catalysts and their application in CO2-assisted isobutane dehydrogenation. The relationship between the activity and surface vanadium sites is almost linear. Isolated vanadium species demonstrate higher activity for isobutane dehydrogenation. The catalysts were prepared using methanol as a medium to combine organic vanadium precursor with silica source. The valence state and form of vanadium species significantly influence the catalytic performance. V3+ shows a close relationship with catalyst activity. Compared to traditional impregnation methods, the in situ synthesis leads to more even distribution and less aggregation of vanadium species on the catalyst surface.

This paper describes the synthesis of V-MCM-41 catalysts through an in situ method using methanol as a medium to combine organic vanadium precursor with silica source. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and oxygen chemisorption. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was also utilized for additional characterization. These methods allowed for detailed examination of the catalyst's structure, vanadium species, and surface properties.

The document discusses the synthesis of V-MCM-41 catalysts and their application in CO2-assisted isobutane dehydrogenation. It is highlighted that there is an almost linear relationship between the catalyst's activity and the surface vanadium sites. Isolated vanadium species demonstrate higher activity compared to other forms in the dehydrogenation process. Moreover, the reaction proceeds via both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction when CO2 is used as a soft oxidant.

The document discusses the synthesis and application of V-MCM-41 catalysts in CO2-assisted isobutane dehydrogenation. These catalysts are characterized by their ability to maintain mesoporous structure and high specific surface area, along with well-dispersed vanadium species on the surface. The presence of both isolated vanadium species and polymeric vanadium species contributes to their enhanced catalytic activity. The study reveals that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds via oxidative and non-oxidative pathways, facilitated by CO2 as a soft oxidant. The catalysts show improved performance compared to traditional methods due to the even distribution of vanadium species, which reduces aggregation and enhances the reaction efficiency.

The synthesis of V-MCM-41 catalysts involves using methanol as a medium to combine an organic vanadium precursor with a silica source. The valence state and form of vanadium species significantly influence the catalytic performance of vanadium-based catalysts. Research indicates that vanadium trivalent ions (V3+) have a close relationship with catalyst activity. The in situ synthesis of these catalysts results in more even distribution of vanadium species, reducing aggregation compared to traditional impregnation methods.
