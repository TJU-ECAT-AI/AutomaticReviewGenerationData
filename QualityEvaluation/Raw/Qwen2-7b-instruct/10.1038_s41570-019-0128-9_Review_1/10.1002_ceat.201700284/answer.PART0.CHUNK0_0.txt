The study highlights the synthesis of V-MCM-41 catalysts and their application in CO2-assisted isobutane dehydrogenation. The relationship between the activity and surface vanadium sites is almost linear. Isolated vanadium species demonstrate higher activity for isobutane dehydrogenation. The catalysts were prepared using methanol as a medium to combine organic vanadium precursor with silica source. The valence state and form of vanadium species significantly influence the catalytic performance. V3+ shows a close relationship with catalyst activity. Compared to traditional impregnation methods, the in situ synthesis leads to more even distribution and less aggregation of vanadium species on the catalyst surface.

该研究探讨了V-MCM-41催化剂的合成及其在CO2辅助异丁烷脱氢反应中的应用。活性与表面钒物种的数量之间存在几乎线性关系。孤立的钒物种在异丁烷脱氢反应中表现出更高的活性。催化剂通过将有机钒前体与硅源结合使用甲醇作为介质来制备。钒物种的价态和形态显著影响催化性能。V3+与催化剂活性之间存在密切关系。与传统的浸渍方法相比，原位合成方法导致了更均匀的钒物种分布和较少的团聚现象。
