This paper describes the synthesis of V-MCM-41 catalysts through an in situ method using methanol as a medium to combine organic vanadium precursor with silica source. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and oxygen chemisorption. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was also utilized for additional characterization. These methods allowed for detailed examination of the catalyst's structure, vanadium species, and surface properties.
