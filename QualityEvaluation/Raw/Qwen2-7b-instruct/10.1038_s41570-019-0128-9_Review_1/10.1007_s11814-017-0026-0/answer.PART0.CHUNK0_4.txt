[1] "Interesting effects of various contents of SO4 2 ion introduction to the MgO-ZrO2 combined support were investigated. The results confirmed that SO4 2 ion changed the support character and activity in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene."
[2] "On the other hand, the introduction of SO4 2 ion led to the formation of three-dimen- sional porous structures and enhanced the surface area of nano- catalysts and impressed the interaction between support and active phase and dispersion of vanadium."
[3] "The FTIR results revealed the S=O bonds, which indicate the acidity of nanocatalysts, increased by increasing sulfur content of support."
[4] "Among the studied nanocatalysts, V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) showed superior catalytic activity at 700 oC giving 52.03% ethylene yield due to uniform morphology, small particle size and suitable acid-base property."

1. The introduction of SO4 2 ions to the MgO-ZrO2 combined support significantly altered the catalyst's character and activity in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene. It transformed the support structure, creating a three-dimensional porous network, which increased the surface area and improved the interaction between the support and the active phase, enhancing dispersion.

2. The sulfur content of the support influenced the formation of S=O bonds, indicating the acidity of the nanocatalyst. This acidity increased with higher sulfur content.

3. V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) demonstrated exceptional catalytic performance at 700 oC, yielding 52.03% ethylene due to its uniform morphology, small particle size, and optimal acid-base characteristics.

1. 向MgO-ZrO2复合支撑材料中引入SO4 2离子，显著改变了催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢生成乙烯过程中的性质和活性。它转变了支撑结构，形成三维多孔网络，增加了表面积并改善了支撑与活性相之间的相互作用，促进了分散。

2. 支撑材料中的硫含量影响了S=O键的形成，指示了纳米催化剂的酸性。随着硫含量的增加，酸性也随之增强。

3. 在700 oC下，V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1)表现出卓越的催化性能，产生52.03%的乙烯，这归功于其均匀的形态、微小的颗粒尺寸以及最佳的酸碱特性。
