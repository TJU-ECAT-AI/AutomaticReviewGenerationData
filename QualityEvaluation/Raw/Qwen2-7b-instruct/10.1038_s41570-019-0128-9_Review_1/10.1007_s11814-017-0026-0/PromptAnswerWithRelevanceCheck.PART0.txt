The document discusses the effects of various contents of SO4 2 ion on the MgO-ZrO2 composite support in the context of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene. The sulfur ions alter the support characteristics and activity, causing the monoclinic phase of zirconia to disappear and decreasing the crystallinity of the tetragonal phase of ZrO2. The introduction of SO4 2 ions leads to the formation of three-dimensional porous structures, enhancing the surface area of the nano-catalysts and influencing the interaction between the support and the active phase, as well as improving the dispersion of vanadium. The V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) catalyst, with its uniform morphology, small particle size, and suitable acid-base property, demonstrated superior catalytic activity at 700°C, yielding 52.03% ethylene.

The literature discusses the impact of sulfur content in MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) supports on the catalytic properties and performance of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 nanocatalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. The introduction of sulfur changes the support characteristics, affecting crystallinity, morphology, and the interaction between support and active phase. The highest catalytic performance and ethylene productivity were achieved with the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) nanocatalyst, which demonstrated superior acid-base property, smaller particle size, better dispersion of active phase, and uniform morphology.

1. The SO4 2 ion significantly altered the support's characteristics and activity in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene process. It facilitated the formation of three-dimensional porous structures, enhancing the surface area of the nano-catalysts and improving the interaction between the support and the active phase. This led to better dispersion of vanadium.

2. The introduction of SO4 2 ions led to the creation of porous structures within the nano-catalysts, which increased their surface area. This enhancement improved the interaction between the support and the active phase, and facilitated better dispersion of vanadium, thereby boosting the catalytic performance.

3. As the sulfur content in the MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) catalyst increased, the crystallinity of the tetragonal ZrO2 phase decreased. This suggests that the sulfur content played a crucial role in modifying the crystalline structure of the catalysts.

4. The V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) catalyst demonstrated superior activity at 700°C, yielding 52.03% ethylene, owing to its uniform morphology, small particle size, and appropriate acid-base property.
