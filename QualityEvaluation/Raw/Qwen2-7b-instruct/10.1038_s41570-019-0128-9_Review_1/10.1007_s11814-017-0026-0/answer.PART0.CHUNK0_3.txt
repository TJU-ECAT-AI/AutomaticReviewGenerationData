[1] "The crystallinity of tetragonal ZrO2 was decreased by increasing H2SO4 molarity used in ZrO2 (Sx) synthesising."
[2] "On the other hand, the introduction of SO4 2 ion led to the formation of three-dimensional porous structures and enhanced the surface area of nano-catalysts and impressed the interaction between support and active phase and dispersion of vanadium."
[3] "The uniform and small particle size was observed for V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1)."
[4] "Among the studied nanocatalysts, V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) showed superior catalytic activity at 700 oC giving 52.03% ethylene yield due to uniform morphology, small particle size and suitable acid-base property."

1. 提高H2SO4溶液摩尔浓度在合成ZrO2 (Sx)过程中，四角形ZrO2的结晶性会降低。
2. 引入SO4 2离子导致形成三维多孔结构，提高了纳米催化剂的表面积，并改善了支持物和活性组分之间的相互作用以及钒的分散。
3. V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1)展现出均匀且粒径较小的特点。
4. V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1)在700 oC下显示出优越的催化活性，产乙烷量达到52.03%，这归因于其均匀的形态、较小的粒径以及合适的酸碱性质。
