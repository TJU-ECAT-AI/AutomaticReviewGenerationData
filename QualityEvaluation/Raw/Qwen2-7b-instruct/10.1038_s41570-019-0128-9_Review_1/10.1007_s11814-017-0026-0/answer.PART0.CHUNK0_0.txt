[1] "The results confirmed that SO4 2 ion changed the support character and activity in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene."
[2] "The crystallinity of tetragonal phase of ZrO2 decreased by increasing the sulfur content used for MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) preparation."
[3] "On the other hand, the introduction of SO4 2 ion led to the formation of three-dimensional porous structures and enhanced the surface area of nano-catalysts and impressed the interaction between support and active phase and dispersion of vanadium."
[4] "The uniform and small particle size was observed for V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1)."
[5] "Among the studied nanocatalysts, V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) showed superior catalytic activity at 700 oC giving 52.03% ethylene yield due to uniform morphology, small particle size and suitable acid-base property."

The document discusses the effects of various contents of SO4 2 ion on the MgO-ZrO2 composite support in the context of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene. The sulfur ions alter the support characteristics and activity, causing the monoclinic phase of zirconia to disappear and decreasing the crystallinity of the tetragonal phase of ZrO2. The introduction of SO4 2 ions leads to the formation of three-dimensional porous structures, enhancing the surface area of the nano-catalysts and influencing the interaction between the support and the active phase, as well as improving the dispersion of vanadium. The V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) catalyst, with its uniform morphology, small particle size, and suitable acid-base property, demonstrated superior catalytic activity at 700°C, yielding 52.03% ethylene.

文档讨论了SO4 2 离子在乙烷氧化脱氢到乙烯过程中的镁氧锆复合支撑材料的各种含量对催化性能的影响。硫离子改变了支撑材料的特性和活性，使得单斜相的锆酸盐消失，并降低了四面体相的锆酸盐的结晶性。引入SO4 2 离子导致形成三维多孔结构，增强了纳米催化剂的表面积，影响了支持和活性组分之间的相互作用，并提高了钒的分散。V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) 催化剂具有均匀的形态、较小的颗粒大小和合适的酸碱性质，在700°C时表现出优异的催化活性，乙烯产率达到了52.03%。
