1. The SO4 2 ion significantly altered the support's characteristics and activity in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene process. It facilitated the formation of three-dimensional porous structures, enhancing the surface area of the nano-catalysts and improving the interaction between the support and the active phase. This led to better dispersion of vanadium.

2. The introduction of SO4 2 ions led to the creation of porous structures within the nano-catalysts, which increased their surface area. This enhancement improved the interaction between the support and the active phase, and facilitated better dispersion of vanadium, thereby boosting the catalytic performance.

3. As the sulfur content in the MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) catalyst increased, the crystallinity of the tetragonal ZrO2 phase decreased. This suggests that the sulfur content played a crucial role in modifying the crystalline structure of the catalysts.

4. The V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) catalyst demonstrated superior activity at 700°C, yielding 52.03% ethylene, owing to its uniform morphology, small particle size, and appropriate acid-base property.

1. SO4 2 离子显著改变了支持物在乙烷氧化脱氢至乙烯过程中的特性和活性。它促进了三维多孔结构的形成，增加了纳米催化剂的表面积，并改善了支持物与活性相之间的相互作用和钒的分散，从而提高了催化性能。

2. 引入SO4 2 离子导致催化剂内部形成多孔结构，增加了它们的表面积。这种增强改善了支持物与活性相之间的相互作用，并使钒得到了更好的分散，从而提高了催化剂的性能。

3. 随着MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) 催化剂中硫含量的增加，四方晶系ZrO2 的结晶性降低。这表明硫含量在修改催化剂晶体结构方面发挥了关键作用。

4. V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) 催化剂在700°C时表现出卓越的活性，产出了52.03%的乙烯，这归因于其均匀的形态、较小的颗粒大小以及合适的酸碱性质。
