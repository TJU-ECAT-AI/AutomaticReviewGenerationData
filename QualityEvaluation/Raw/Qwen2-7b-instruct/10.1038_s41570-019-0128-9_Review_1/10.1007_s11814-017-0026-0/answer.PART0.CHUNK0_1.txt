<p>According to the literature, the ZrO2 was treated by various molarities of H2SO4 solution (0, 0.5, 1 and 2) then mixed by MgO and impregnated with 5 wt% of V2O5. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET and FTIR techniques.</p>
<p>The crystalline structures of MgO and ZrO2 were confirmed by XRD analysis. The crystallinity of tetragonal ZrO2 was decreased by increasing H2SO4 molarity used in ZrO2 (Sx) synthesizing.</p>
<p>The highest catalytic performance and ethylene productivity (C2H4 yield of 48% and ethane conversion of 79% at 700 oC) were obtained on the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) nanocatalyst.</p>
<p>The results confirmed that SO4 2 ion changed the support character and activity in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene. The monoclinic phase of zirconia approximately disappeared after sulfidation of the MgO-ZrO2 combined support.</p>
<p>The crystallinity of tetragonal phase of ZrO2 decreased by increasing the sulfur content used for MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) preparation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the introduction of SO4 2 ion led to the formation of three-dimensional porous structures and enhanced the surface area of nanocatalysts and impressed the interaction between support and active phase and dispersion of vanadium.</p>
<p>The uniform and small particle size was observed for V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1).</p>

The literature discusses the impact of sulfur content in MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) supports on the catalytic properties and performance of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 nanocatalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. The introduction of sulfur changes the support characteristics, affecting crystallinity, morphology, and the interaction between support and active phase. The highest catalytic performance and ethylene productivity were achieved with the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) nanocatalyst, which demonstrated superior acid-base property, smaller particle size, better dispersion of active phase, and uniform morphology. The sulfur content influences the surface area and three-dimensional porous structure of the nanocatalysts, enhancing their activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene.

文献讨论了硫含量在MgO-ZrO2（Sx）支持物中对V2O5/MgO-ZrO2纳米催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的催化性质和性能的影响。引入硫改变了支持物的特性，影响了结晶性、形态以及支持物与活性相之间的相互作用。在V2O5/MgO-ZrO2（S1）纳米催化剂中实现了最高的催化性能和乙烯产率，这显示出了优异的酸碱性、更小的颗粒尺寸、活性相的良好分散性和均匀形态。硫含量影响了纳米催化剂的表面积和三维多孔结构，从而增强了它们在乙烷氧化脱氢为乙烯过程中的活性。
