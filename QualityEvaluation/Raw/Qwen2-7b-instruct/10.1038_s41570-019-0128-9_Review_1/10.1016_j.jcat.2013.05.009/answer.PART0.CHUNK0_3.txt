1. Many experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted on model surfaces to understand the origins of the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts. Techniques like Low-Energy Ion Spectroscopy (LEIS) and Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STM) have been used to confirm the structure of these surfaces.

2. The mono-layer NiAPtAPt(111) surface structure has been confirmed using Low-Energy Ion Spectroscopy (LEIS) and Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STM).

3. Segregation energies of various bimetallic combinations have been calculated to study the stability of bimetallic surfaces, using Ni(111), Pd(111), and Pt(111) as substrates.

4. Experimentally, it was found that in the presence of hydrogen, Ni atoms diffuse into the Pt substrate to form a subsurface (Pt-terminated) structure. Conversely, in the presence of oxygen, Ni atoms segregate to form a surface (Ni-terminated) configuration.

5. There is less clarity in correlating the results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultra-high vacuum (UHV) experiments with the performance of supported catalysts for the reforming of ethylene glycol.

6. The PtANi bimetallic catalysts experience structural changes during the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of ethylene glycol.

1. 对于理解双金属催化剂独特性质的起源，已经进行了许多关于单晶基底上的模型表面的实验和理论研究，并在几篇综述中进行了总结。

2. 通过低能离子光谱（LEIS）和扫描隧道光谱（STM），确认了单层NiAPtAPt(111)表面结构。

3. 计算了不同双金属组合的分离能，以研究这些表面的稳定性，使用Ni(111)，Pd(111)，和Pt(111)作为基底。

4. 实验发现，在氢气存在下，Ni原子会扩散进入Pt基质形成亚表面（Pt终止）结构。而在氧气存在下，Ni原子则会分层形成表面（Ni终止）配置。

5. 在乙二醇水解反应中，密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和超高压真空（UHV）实验与支持催化剂的结果之间的相关性并不明确。

6. PtANi双金属催化剂在乙二醇水解过程中经历结构变化。
