[1] "In order to truly achieve the design of bimetallic catalysts from first principles, it is essential that the bimetallic structures and compositions of model surfaces are as close as possible to those under reaction conditions."
[2] "Similar correlations have led to the utilization of PtA3d bimetallic catalysts for the low-temperature hydrogenation of the C@C bond in conjugated hydrocarbons (1,3-butadiene [25]) and aromatic molecules (benzene [24]), as well as the hydrogenation of the C@O bond in propanal [30] and acrolein [14,31]."
[3] "The 3dAPtAPt(111) bimetallic configuration that is favorable for reforming is not stable at high temperatures [20], because the sur- face monolayer 3d atoms diffuse into the Pt bulk [15] and lead to significantly diminished activity."

The design of bimetallic catalysts requires model surfaces that closely resemble their actual conditions under reaction scenarios. This ensures accurate predictions of their properties and functionalities. Bimetallic catalysts have been successfully applied to hydrogenate various molecules like 1,3-butadiene, benzene, propanal, and acrolein. However, the 3dAPtAPt(111) configuration, which is beneficial for reforming reactions, becomes unstable at high temperatures due to the diffusion of surface 3d atoms into the Pt bulk, leading to a decline in catalytic activity.

设计双金属催化剂需要模型表面尽可能接近其在反应条件下的状态。这确保了对它们属性和功能的准确预测。双金属催化剂已被成功应用于氢化各种分子，如1,3-丁二烯、苯、丙醛和丙酮。然而，在高温下，有利的3dAPtAPt(111)配置变得不稳定，因为表面3d原子扩散到Pt内部，导致催化活性下降。
