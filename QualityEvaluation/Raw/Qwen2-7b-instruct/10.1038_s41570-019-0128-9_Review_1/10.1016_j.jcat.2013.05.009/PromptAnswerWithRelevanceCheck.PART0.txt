The literature discusses the challenges and opportunities in correlating bimetallic model surfaces and supported catalysts, focusing on hydrogenation and reforming reactions. Model surfaces on single-crystal substrates have been extensively studied to understand the origins of novel bimetallic properties. Techniques like Low-Energy Ion Spectroscopy (LEIS) and Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STM) have confirmed the structure of bimetallic surfaces. Adsorbate-induced metal diffusion and segregation have significant implications for catalytic properties. Bimetallic catalysts have proven effective for hydrogenation reactions, such as the low-temperature hydrogenation of C@C and C@O bonds in various molecules. However, the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts is less clear for reforming reactions, particularly for ethylene glycol. The unstable nature of the 3dAPtAPt(111) bimetallic configuration at high temperatures poses a challenge for reforming catalysts.

[1] "In order to truly achieve the design of bimetallic catalysts from first principles, it is essential that the bimetallic structures and compositions of model surfaces are as close as possible to those under reaction conditions."

The design of bimetallic catalysts requires model surfaces that closely resemble their actual conditions under reaction scenarios. This ensures accurate predictions of their properties and functionalities. Bimetallic catalysts have been successfully applied to hydrogenate various molecules like 1,3-butadiene, benzene, propanal, and acrolein. However, the 3dAPtAPt(111) configuration, which is beneficial for reforming reactions, becomes unstable at high temperatures due to the diffusion of surface 3d atoms into the Pt bulk, leading to a decline in catalytic activity.

[1] "While experimental and theoretical studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insights into their novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst, the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-sur- face-area support."
[2] "In order to achieve correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts, it is critical to bridge the well- documented materials gap between model surfaces and sup- ported catalysts, as well as the pressure gap between ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and the reaction environment."
[3] "The reforming yield in Fig. 8 is calculated based on the production of CO from the TPD measurements."

The literature discusses the challenges and opportunities in correlating bimetallic model surfaces with supported catalysts. Specifically, it addresses the successful correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts for hydrogenation reactions, where the desirable bimetallic structures are thermodynamically stable under relevant conditions. However, the correlation is less clear for reforming reactions, especially for oxygenates like ethylene glycol, due to the changes in surface compositions and structures of supported bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions. The literature suggests that understanding the bimetallic structures and their stability under reaction conditions is crucial for constructing relevant model surfaces for UHV and DFT studies. To truly achieve the design of bimetallic catalysts from first principles, the structures of model surfaces need to closely match those under reaction conditions. The reforming yield for ethylene glycol is calculated based on the production of CO from the TPD measurements.

文献讨论了在模型表面与支持催化剂之间建立联系的挑战和机遇。具体而言，它针对氢化反应中模型表面与支持催化剂之间的成功联系，其中理想的双金属结构在相关条件下具有热力学稳定性。然而，对于重整反应，尤其是对氧含量较高的分子如乙二醇，由于支持双金属催化剂表面组成和结构的变化，这种联系不太明确。文献建议，理解双金属结构及其在反应条件下的稳定性对于构建用于UHV和DFT研究的相关模型表面至关重要。为了真正实现从第一原理设计双金属催化剂，模型表面的结构需要尽可能接近反应条件下的结构。重整乙二醇的产率基于TD谱仪测量的CO产量进行计算。
