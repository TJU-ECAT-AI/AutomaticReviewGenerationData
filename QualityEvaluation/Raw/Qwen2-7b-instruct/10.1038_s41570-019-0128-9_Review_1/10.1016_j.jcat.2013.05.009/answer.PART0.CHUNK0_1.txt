[1] "In order to understand the origins of the novel bimetallic properties, model surfaces on single-crystal substrates have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies, as summarized in several reviews [810]."
[2] "For example, the mono-layer NiAPtAPt(111) surface structure was confirmed using Low-Energy Ion Spectroscopy (LEIS) and Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STM)."
[3] "The findings of adsorbate-induced metal diffusion and segregation should lead to different catalytic properties and will be the central topic of the current paper."
[4] "Similar correlations have led to the utilization of PtA3d bimetallic catalysts for the low-temperature hydrogenation of the C@C bond in conjugated hydrocarbons (1,3-butadiene [25]) and aromatic molecules (benzene [24]), as well as the hydrogenation of the C@O bond in propanal [30] and acrolein [14,31]."
[5] "Unlike hydrogenation reactions, the correlation between DFT and UHV studies on model surfaces and reactor evaluation over supported catalysts is not as clear for the reforming of ethylene glycol."
[6] "The 3dAPtAPt(111) bimetallic configuration that is favorable for reforming is not stable at high temperatures [20], because the surface monolayer 3d atoms diffuse into the Pt bulk [15] and lead to significantly diminished activity."

The literature discusses the challenges and opportunities in correlating bimetallic model surfaces and supported catalysts, focusing on hydrogenation and reforming reactions. Model surfaces on single-crystal substrates have been extensively studied to understand the origins of novel bimetallic properties. Techniques like Low-Energy Ion Spectroscopy (LEIS) and Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STM) have confirmed the structure of bimetallic surfaces. Adsorbate-induced metal diffusion and segregation have significant implications for catalytic properties. Bimetallic catalysts have proven effective for hydrogenation reactions, such as the low-temperature hydrogenation of C@C and C@O bonds in various molecules. However, the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts is less clear for reforming reactions, particularly for ethylene glycol. The unstable nature of the 3dAPtAPt(111) bimetallic configuration at high temperatures poses a challenge for reforming catalysts.

文献讨论了在氢化和重整反应中将单晶基底上的双金属模型表面与支持催化剂相关联的挑战和机遇。对单晶基底上的模型表面进行了广泛的研究，以了解新型双金属性质的起源。例如，利用低能离子光谱（LEIS）和扫描隧道光谱（STM）证实了双金属表面的结构。吸附剂诱导的金属扩散和分离对催化性能有重大影响。双金属催化剂已在氢化反应中证明有效，如低温度下C@C和C@O键在各种分子中的氢化反应。然而，对于乙二醇重整反应，模型表面与支持催化剂之间的相关性不太明确。3dAPtAPt(111)双金属配置在高温下的不稳定性质为重整催化剂带来了挑战。
