How do FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, compare with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms, and what roles do support materials, composition, and structural factors play in determining their performance, challenges, and potential for improvement?
