The literature discusses the utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalysis, with a focus on its potential for industrial applications. CO2 is highlighted as a promising concept for contributing to the mitigation of CO2 levels while also enabling the development of economical and energy-efficient syntheses of various chemicals. Key findings include:

1. CO2, due to its low reactivity, thermodynamic stability, and high oxidation state, poses a challenge for its utilization. However, it has been successfully employed in a few cases, such as in the synthesis of urea, formic acid, methanol, cyclic carbonates, lactone, and salicylic acid.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene was studied by Park et al. over a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst, which showed superior conversions compared to a simple dehydrogenation in a nitrogen atmosphere. This indicates that CO2 can effectively enhance the catalytic performance.

3. CO2 acts as a soft oxidant in catalysis, meaning it can activate the substrate without requiring high energy inputs. It can abstract hydrogen from hydrocarbons to form water, thereby facilitating oxidative reactions.

4. The literature mentions that the use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in catalytic transformations is a promising area for developing alternative technologies. It emphasizes the role of CO2 and an activator, as well as the importance of catalyst properties, surface oxygen species, and mechanistic pathways in the utilization of CO2 in oxidation reactions.

5. Alkali metals and alkaline earth metals can act as promoters, enhancing the catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions when used in the presence of CO2.

6. The surface/lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in oxidative dehydrogenation by donating oxygen from the metal oxide lattice for abstraction of hydrogen from the substrate, returning the metal oxide to its original state.

7. The literature discusses the use of CO2 as a promoter in homogeneous systems, such as the ring opening reaction of tetrahydrofuran, where CO2 changes the selectivity of the products.

8. In heterogeneous systems, the formation of peroxycarbonate species over the catalyst surface is attributed to the promotional effect of CO2, enhancing the oxidation reactions.

9. Challenges for industrial implementation include increasing CO2 conversions with minimal coke deposition, improving catalytic performances per pass, and ensuring thermal stability of the catalysts.

The literature outlines the current status and future perspectives of utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalysis, highlighting its potential to revolutionize chemical industries and contribute to sustainable practices.
