The utilization of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalysis is a promising concept for industrial applications. It aims to mitigate CO2 levels while developing economical and energy-efficient syntheses of various chemicals. Its abundant availability, non-toxic, economic, and mild oxidizing properties have driven its use in several reactions, such as the oxidative coupling of CH4 and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkyl aromatics. Despite some processes based on CO2 as a soft oxidant being realized on a technical scale, only a few have reached industrial scale operations due to challenges like extensive energy consumption, slow sorption kinetics, and the hydrogen economy. Therefore, there is a need for alternative technological methods for the utilization of CO2. One such technology is the behavior of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalytic transformations. This review aims to trace the emergence, application, and understanding of such systems to pave the way for the development of alternative technologies for industrial scale operations in the near future.
