[1] "The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter is a promising concept for industrial applications that could not only contribute to the mitigation of CO2 levels, but also the development of economical and energy efficient syntheses of various chemicals."

[2] "The abundant availability, non-toxic, economic and mild oxidizing properties of CO2 has resulted in immense interest in its use as an oxidant in several reactions, such as the oxidative coupling of CH4 and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkyl aromatics."

[3] "At present, only a few processes based on CO2 as a soft oxidant have been realized on a technical scale in spite of dedicated research."

[4] "The effect of carbon dioxide in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene was studied by Park et al. over a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst, which exhibited superior conversions compared with that of a simple dehy- drogenation in a nitrogen atmosphere."

[5] "The role of CO2 activators suggests that it plays an important role in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Moreover, alkali or alkaline earth metals can act as promoters and enhance the catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions under an optimum ratio of carbon dioxide to the substrate."

[6] "The surface/lattice oxygen plays an important role in oxidative dehydrogenation by donation of oxygen from the metal oxide lattice for abstraction of hydrogen from the substrate by reduction of higher valence states of the metal oxides to lower valence oxides along with the formation of water."

[7] "The redox properties of a material play a significant role in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. In many cases, the role of the redox catalyst in oxidative dehydrogenation is that of a mediator for the transfer of oxygen from CO2 to the hydrocarbon."

[8] "Nevertheless, even in CO2 mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the support can have a large influence on the performance of the catalyst."

[9] "The support plays a significant role as it not only provides a high surface area, immobilization and porosity, but can also overcome diffusion problems by maintaining highly dispersed active sites with large fractions on the surface, which are easily accessible for the reactants to adsorb."

[10] "The present challenges for the industrial applications of this technology involve process feasibility studies, catalyst processing, reaction engineering, improvement of carbon dioxide conversions, reactor design to decrease energy consumption and the development of catalysts with appropriate CO2 promoters."
