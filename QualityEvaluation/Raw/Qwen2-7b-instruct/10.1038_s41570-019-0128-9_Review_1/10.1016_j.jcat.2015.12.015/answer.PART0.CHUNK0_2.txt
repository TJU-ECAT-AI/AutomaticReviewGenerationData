[2] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."
[3] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[4] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."
[5] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."
[6] "In agreement with the value predicted from DFT, the experimental apparent activation energy for all investigated W/V ratios is similar and varies from 127  11 kJ/mol to 147  12 kJ/mol with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6."

1. The study examines the dehydrogenation of propane using WOxVOx catalysts supported on porous silica, focusing on the role of CO2 in the process.

2. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and plays a role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

3. One of the main functions of CO2 is to inhibit the formation of surface carbon.

4. At 600°C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-limiting step, whereas the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs at a faster timescale.

5. The catalyst with a W/V molar ratio of 0.1 has the highest average turnover frequency for C3H6, but higher selectivities are achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6.

6. The experimental apparent activation energy for all investigated W/V ratios is consistent with the DFT predictions, varying from 127 ± 11 kJ/mol to 147 ± 12 kJ/mol across W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6.
