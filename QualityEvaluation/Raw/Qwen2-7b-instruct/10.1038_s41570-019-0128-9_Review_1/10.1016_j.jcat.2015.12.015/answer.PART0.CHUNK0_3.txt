[1] "Improvement in this yield is possible with the addition of WOx. It has been reported that tungsten oxide influences the dispersion of VOx and improves the abundance of moderately distorted vanadium oxide species."
[2] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."
[3] "Moreover, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."
[4] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

The addition of tungsten oxide (WOx) to vanadium oxide catalysts enhances dispersion and abundance of moderately distorted vanadium oxide species. Among the tested catalysts, the one with a W/V ratio of 0.1 has the highest average turnover frequency for propylene production, yet higher selectivities are achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6. Carbon formation is reduced and propylene production becomes more selective when carbon dioxide (CO2) is used in the dehydrogenation process. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-limiting step in CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs more rapidly.

添加钨氧化物（WOx）可以增强钒氧化物催化剂的分散性和适度扭曲的钒氧化物种的丰度。在测试的催化剂中，W/V比为0.1的催化剂具有最高的丙烷平均转化频率，但W/V比为0.6的催化剂显示出更高的选择性。当使用二氧化碳（CO2）进行脱氢时，碳形成减少，并且丙烯生产变得更加选择性。在CO2辅助下进行的丙烷脱氢过程中，丙烷的二级CAH键的活化被确定为限制步骤，而催化剂用CO2重新氧化则发生得更快。
