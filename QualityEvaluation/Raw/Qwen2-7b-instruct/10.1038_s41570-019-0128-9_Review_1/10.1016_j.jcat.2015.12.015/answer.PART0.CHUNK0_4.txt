[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins."
[3] "Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
[4] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."
[5] "Vanadium oxide is considered to be one of the most important compounds in metal oxide catalysis [69]."
[6] "Improvement in this yield is possible with the addition of WOx."
[7] "Tungsten oxide influences the dispersion of VOx and improves the abundance of moderately distorted vanadium oxide species [15,16]."
[8] "Alternatively, it has been suggested that the promoting effect of tungsten oxide could also be beneficial for the WOxVOx/SiO2 catalyst by inhibiting the strong tendency for island formation of VOx and by interacting with neighboring vanadium oxide species."
[9] "When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides."
[10] "Moreover, because of its high heat capacity,using CO2 as a co-feed can alleviate the effects of the exothermal ODP reaction, avoiding hot spots that can lead to cracking of the alkane [21,23]."
[11] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over chromium and vanadium oxide based catalysts [20,2832]."

[13] "In the presence of CO2 with a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 1, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 C lower than that of simple dehy- drogenation to achieve 60% conversion of propane at 650 C."
[14] "It was found that the occurrence of dry reforming of propane and coke forming side reactions could strongly impact the equilibrium product composition of the multireaction system and, therefore,these reactions should be kinetically controlled [40]."
[15] "Nevertheless, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation with the use of vanadium oxide based catalysts remains poorly understood."

Vanadium oxide catalysts are used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. Tungsten oxide (WOx) can improve the dispersion of vanadium oxide (VOx) and reduce the likelihood of VOx clustering, which enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene. Carbon dioxide (CO2) acts as a mild oxidant, inhibiting total oxidation of propane and propylene. It lowers the reaction temperature and avoids hot spots that could lead to cracking of the alkane. CO2 can also enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene. The presence of CO2 reduces the temperature needed for 60% conversion of propane to propylene by 50°C. However, the role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation and its mechanism remain poorly understood, especially in relation to vanadium oxide-based catalysts. DFT calculations help explain the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2.

钒氧化物催化剂用于丙烷的氧化脱氢以产生丙烯。钨氧化物（WOx）可以改善钒氧化物（VOx）的分散，减少VOx的聚集，从而增强催化活性和丙烯的选择性。二氧化碳（CO2）作为温和的氧化剂，可以抑制丙烷和丙烯的完全氧化。它降低了反应温度并避免了可能导致烷烃裂解的热点。CO2还可以增强较低烷烃和乙基苯的脱氢作用。在CO2的存在下，将丙烷转化为丙烯所需的温度降低50°C。然而，CO2在氧化脱氢中的作用及其机制仍然不太清楚，特别是在使用钒氧化物基催化剂的情况下。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算有助于解释丙烷脱氢在CO2存在与否下的反应机制。
