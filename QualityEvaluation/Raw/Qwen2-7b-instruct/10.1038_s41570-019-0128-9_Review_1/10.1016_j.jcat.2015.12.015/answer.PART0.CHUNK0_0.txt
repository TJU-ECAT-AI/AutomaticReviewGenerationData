[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."
[2] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[3] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."
[4] "A partially reduced vana- dia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were per- formed."
[5] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

The presence of tungsten in the WOxVOx/SiO2 catalysts prevents the clustering of VOx species, thereby reducing the chance of non-selective oxygen formation and decreasing CO2 production. This leads to a higher selectivity towards propylene production and a reduction in carbon formation. The CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift reaction. The rate-determining step is the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 happens on a shorter timescale. The DFT calculations indicate that the WOx component in the catalyst plays a crucial role in maintaining VOx in a dispersed state, which contributes to the enhanced selectivity of propylene production.

在WOxVOx/SiO2催化剂中，钨的存在阻止了VOx物种的聚集，从而减少了非选择性氧的形成和二氧化碳的产生。这导致了丙烯生产的选择性提高和碳生成的减少。CO2辅助的丙烷脱氢反应可以同时进行直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后通过水煤气逆向反应。决定速率的关键步骤是丙烷二级CAH键的活化，而催化剂与CO2的重新氧化发生在较短的时间尺度上。DFT计算表明，催化剂中的WOx成分在维持VOx分散状态方面起着关键作用，这有助于提高丙烯生产的高选择性。
