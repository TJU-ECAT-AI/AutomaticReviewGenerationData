[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."
[2] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[3] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."
[4] "A partially reduced vana- dia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were per- formed."
[5] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of tungsten in the WOxVOx/SiO2 catalysts prevents the clustering of VOx species, thereby reducing the chance of non-selective oxygen formation and decreasing CO2 production. This leads to a higher selectivity towards propylene production and a reduction in carbon formation. The CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift reaction. The rate-determining step is the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 happens on a shorter timescale. The DFT calculations indicate that the WOx component in the catalyst plays a crucial role in maintaining VOx in a dispersed state, which contributes to the enhanced selectivity of propylene production.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在WOxVOx/SiO2催化剂中，钨的存在阻止了VOx物种的聚集，从而减少了非选择性氧的形成和二氧化碳的产生。这导致了丙烯生产的选择性提高和碳生成的减少。CO2辅助的丙烷脱氢反应可以同时进行直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后通过水煤气逆向反应。决定速率的关键步骤是丙烷二级CAH键的活化，而催化剂与CO2的重新氧化发生在较短的时间尺度上。DFT计算表明，催化剂中的WOx成分在维持VOx分散状态方面起着关键作用，这有助于提高丙烯生产的高选择性。

[1] "The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene."
[2] "It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species."
[3] "As a result it prevents the formation of non-selective oxygen which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane."
[4] "CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the catalyst completely to its V2O5 state."
[5] "Using CO2, it is only possible to oxidize to V2O4, as confirmed by the isothermal reduction experiments of the CO2 re-oxidized sample."
[6] "Furthermore, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."
[7] "According to isotopic experiments during reaction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."
[8] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

The addition of tungsten oxide (WOx) to vanadium oxide catalysts enhances dispersion and abundance of moderately distorted vanadium oxide species. Among the tested catalysts, the one with a W/V ratio of 0.1 has the highest average turnover frequency for propylene production, yet higher selectivities are achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6. Carbon formation is reduced and propylene production becomes more selective when carbon dioxide (CO2) is used in the dehydrogenation process. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-limiting step in CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs more rapidly.

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins."
[3] "Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
[4] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."
[5] "Vanadium oxide is considered to be one of the most important compounds in metal oxide catalysis [69]."
[6] "Improvement in this yield is possible with the addition of WOx."
[7] "Tungsten oxide influences the dispersion of VOx and improves the abundance of moderately distorted vanadium oxide species [15,16]."
[8] "Alternatively, it has been suggested that the promoting effect of tungsten oxide could also be beneficial for the WOxVOx/SiO2 catalyst by inhibiting the strong tendency for island formation of VOx and by interacting with neighboring vanadium oxide species."
[9] "When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides."
[10] "Moreover, because of its high heat capacity,using CO2 as a co-feed can alleviate the effects of the exothermal ODP reaction, avoiding hot spots that can lead to cracking of the alkane [21,23]."
[11] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over chromium and vanadium oxide based catalysts [20,2832]."

[13] "In the presence of CO2 with a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 1, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 C lower than that of simple dehy- drogenation to achieve 60% conversion of propane at 650 C."
[14] "It was found that the occurrence of dry reforming of propane and coke forming side reactions could strongly impact the equilibrium product composition of the multireaction system and, therefore,these reactions should be kinetically controlled [40]."
[15] "Nevertheless, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation with the use of vanadium oxide based catalysts remains poorly understood."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Vanadium oxide catalysts are used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. Tungsten oxide (WOx) can improve the dispersion of vanadium oxide (VOx) and reduce the likelihood of VOx clustering, which enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene. Carbon dioxide (CO2) acts as a mild oxidant, inhibiting total oxidation of propane and propylene. It lowers the reaction temperature and avoids hot spots that could lead to cracking of the alkane. CO2 can also enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene. The presence of CO2 reduces the temperature needed for 60% conversion of propane to propylene by 50°C. However, the role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation and its mechanism remain poorly understood, especially in relation to vanadium oxide-based catalysts. DFT calculations help explain the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2.

钒氧化物催化剂用于丙烷的氧化脱氢以产生丙烯。钨氧化物（WOx）可以改善钒氧化物（VOx）的分散，减少VOx的聚集，从而增强催化活性和丙烯的选择性。二氧化碳（CO2）作为温和的氧化剂，可以抑制丙烷和丙烯的完全氧化。它降低了反应温度并避免了可能导致烷烃裂解的热点。CO2还可以增强较低烷烃和乙基苯的脱氢作用。在CO2的存在下，将丙烷转化为丙烯所需的温度降低50°C。然而，CO2在氧化脱氢中的作用及其机制仍然不太清楚，特别是在使用钒氧化物基催化剂的情况下。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算有助于解释丙烷脱氢在CO2存在与否下的反应机制。
