[1] "The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene."
[2] "It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species."
[3] "As a result it prevents the formation of non-selective oxygen which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane."
[4] "CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the catalyst completely to its V2O5 state."
[5] "Using CO2, it is only possible to oxidize to V2O4, as confirmed by the isothermal reduction experiments of the CO2 re-oxidized sample."
[6] "Furthermore, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."
[7] "According to isotopic experiments during reaction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."
[8] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

1. The WOx component affects the catalyst's activity and the propane-to-propylene conversion process.
2. WOx acts as a physical barrier, preventing the VOx species from clustering.
3. This impedes the creation of non-selective oxygen, thereby reducing the likelihood of CO2 formation and complete propane oxidation.
4. CO2, as an oxidant, cannot fully revert the catalyst to its V2O5 state.
5. It can only oxidize the catalyst to V2O4, as confirmed through isothermal reduction experiments.
6. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation leads to higher propylene production selectivity and reduced carbon formation.
7. Propane dehydrogenation in CO2 presence can occur via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift, according to isotopic experiments and DFT calculations.
8. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane limits CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, while catalyst re-oxidation with CO2 happens at a faster pace.

1. WOx成分影响催化剂本身及其丙烷转化为丙烯的反应过程。
2. WOx充当物理屏障，阻止VOx物种聚集体。
3. 这阻碍了非选择性氧的形成，从而降低了CO2生成和完全丙烷氧化的可能性。
4. CO2作为氧化剂无法将催化剂完全还原为V2O5状态。
5. 它只能将催化剂氧化为V2O4，通过等温还原实验确认。
6. CO2辅助的丙烷脱氢导致更高的丙烯生产选择性和碳形成减少。
7. 根据同位素实验和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，丙烷在CO2存在下的脱氢可以通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后反水煤气变换反应同时进行。
8. 丙烷脱氢在CO2作用下受丙烷二级CAH键活化限制，而CO2对催化剂的再氧化发生在更快的时间尺度上。
