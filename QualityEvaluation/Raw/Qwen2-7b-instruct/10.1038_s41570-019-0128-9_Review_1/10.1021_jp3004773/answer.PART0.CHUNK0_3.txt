[1] "In the present work, CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation on the (110) surface of In2O3 have been studied using density functional theory slab calculations."
[2] "Our results revealed that although bicarbonate formation is energetically favorable, its subsequent conversion to CO and H2O, COOH + InH → CO + H2O, is highly endothermic."
[3] "However, disproportion reaction of the bicarbonate and the surface hydroxyl (COOH + OH → CO2 + H2O) is highly exothermic."
[4] "Consequently, this step is expected to consume the surface bicarbonate species and reproduce CO2 together with H2O."
[5] "As such, an In2O3-based catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation is expected to suppress the RWGS reaction and increase the selectivity toward formate and its subsequent products."

1. The study focused on the density functional theory slab calculations to investigate the CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation on the (110) surface of In2O3.
2. The formation of bicarbonate species during CO2 hydrogenation was energetically favorable.
3. However, the subsequent step to convert bicarbonate to CO and H2O was highly endothermic.
4. The disproportion reaction of bicarbonate with a surface hydroxyl was highly exothermic, suggesting it could consume the surface bicarbonate species.
5. An In2O3-based catalyst was expected to inhibit the RWGS reaction and enhance the selectivity towards formate and its derivatives.
