[1] "The results of CO2, H2, and H2O adsorption on the perfect In2O3(110) surface help us to understand the activity of the In2O3 surface. Among the surface sites, O3In3O4 at the center of the chain is more active than the sites either on the left or on the right."
[2] "We examined ten stable coadsorption structures of CO2 and H2 and determined that two configurations (CH-1 and CH-2 shown in Figure 6) are the most probable configurations for adsorbed CO2 reacting with the H adatoms from dissociative adsorption of H2."
[3] "The frequencies of bicarbonate species in CH-p1 and CW-p are very similar. For example, the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching frequencies of OCO are 1592 cm1 and 1421 cm1, respectively, in CH-p1 and 1605 cm1 and 1424 cm1, respectively, in CW-p."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The central O3In3O4 site of the In2O3(110) surface is more active than the sites on either side.

2. Two configurations, CH-1 and CH-2, are the most probable for CO2 reacting with H adatoms from dissociative H2 adsorption.

3. The frequencies of the bicarbonate species formed via different pathways are nearly identical, suggesting they are the same species.

1. In2O3(110)表面中央的O3In3O4位点比两侧的位点更活跃。

2. CH-1和CH-2两种构型是最有可能的CO2与来自H2解离吸附的H原子反应的配置。

3. 通过不同途径形成的碳酸氢盐物种的频率非常相似，表明它们是同一种物种。
