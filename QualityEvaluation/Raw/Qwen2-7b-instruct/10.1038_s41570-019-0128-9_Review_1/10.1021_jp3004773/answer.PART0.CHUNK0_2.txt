[1] "In the present work, CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation on the (110) surface of In2O3 have been studied using density functional theory slab calculations."
[2] "Our results revealed that although bicarbonate formation is energetically favorable, its subsequent conversion to CO and H2O, COOH + InH  CO + H2O, is highly endothermic."
[3] "However, disproportion reaction of the bicarbonate and the surface hydroxyl (COOH + OH  CO2 + H2O) is highly exothermic."
[4] "Consequently, this step is expected to consume the surface bicarbonate species and reproduce CO2 together with H2O."
[5] "As such, an In2O3-based catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation is expected to suppress the RWGS reaction and increase the selectivity toward formate and its subsequent products."

The study investigated CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation on the (110) surface of In2O3 through density functional theory slab calculations. It was found that while the formation of the bicarbonate species is energetically favorable, its subsequent conversion to CO and H2O is highly endothermic. However, the disproportion reaction of the bicarbonate species with a surface hydroxyl is highly exothermic, suggesting it consumes the surface bicarbonate species and reproduces CO2 along with H2O. This indicates that an In2O3-based catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation can suppress the RWGS reaction and enhance the selectivity towards formate and its products.

本研究通过密度泛函理论层状计算方法，探讨了In2O3（110）表面的CO2吸附和氢化。研究发现，虽然碳酸氢盐物种的形成是能量有利的，但其后续转化为CO和H2O是高度吸热的。然而，碳酸氢盐物种与表面羟基的过氧化反应是高度放热的，表明它消耗了表面碳酸氢盐物种并重新生成CO2以及H2O。这表明基于In2O3的催化剂可用于抑制RWGS反应，并提高甲酸及其产物的选择性。
