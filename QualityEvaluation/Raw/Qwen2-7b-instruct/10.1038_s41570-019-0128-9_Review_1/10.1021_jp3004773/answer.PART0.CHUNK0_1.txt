[1] "In the present work, CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation on the (110) surface of In2O3 have been studied using density functional theory slab calculations."
[2] "On the surface, the O3In3O4 part of the chain is more active than either of the OIn rings it connects due to the low coordination number of its constituent atoms."
[3] "CO2 is activated upon adsorption, and H2 adsorbs dissociatively whereas H2O adsorbs molecularly and dissociatively."
[4] "The activated CO2 on the In2O3(110) surface forms surface carbonate species with the participation of a surface O atom."
[5] "Heterolytic dissociative adsorption of H2 is less favorable as compared to the homolytically bound H adatoms."
[6] "Both molecularly and dissociatively adsorption of H2O can occur on the In2O3(110) surface, with the dissociative mode being more stable."
[7] "We examined two possible pathways for CO2 to react with the coadsorbed H adatoms: (1) CO2 is hydrogenated by the surface hydrides on the In site, forming a formate species (HCOO); (2) CO2 is protonated by the surface hydroxyl, leading to a surface bicarbonate species."
[8] "Although bicarbonate formation is energetically favorable, its subsequent conversion to CO and H2O, COOH + InH → CO + H2O, is highly endothermic."
[9] "However, disproportion reaction of the bicarbonate and the surface hydroxyl (COOH + OH → CO2 + H2O) is highly exothermic."
[10] "Consequently, this step is expected to consume the surface bicarbonate species and reproduce CO2 together with H2O."

The study focuses on the adsorption and hydrogenation of CO2 on the (110) surface of In2O3 using density functional theory slab calculations. The O3In3O4 part of the chain is more active than the other OIn rings due to its lower coordination number. CO2 becomes activated upon adsorption, and H2 adsorbs dissociatively, while H2O adsorbs both molecularly and dissociatively. CO2 forms surface carbonate species with the involvement of a surface O atom. Heterolytic dissociative adsorption of H2 is less favored compared to homolytic adsorption. Both molecular and dissociative adsorption of H2O occur on the In2O3(110) surface, with the dissociative mode being more stable. Two possible pathways for CO2 reaction with coadsorbed H adatoms are examined: hydrogenation to form a formate species (HCOO) or protonation to create a bicarbonate species. The subsequent conversion of bicarbonate to CO and H2O is highly endothermic, but its disproportionation with a surface hydroxyl is highly exothermic. This process consumes the surface bicarbonate species, reproducing CO2 and H2O.

本研究利用密度泛函理论表面计算方法，探讨了In2O3(110)表面的CO2吸附和氢化。O3In3O4部分的链比其他OIn环更活跃，由于其较低的配位数。CO2在吸附后被激活，而H2以离解方式吸附，H2O以分子性和离解性两种方式吸附到In2O3(110)表面上，其中离解性吸附更为稳定。CO2形成表面碳酸盐物种，涉及到表面的O原子。与表面H原子的离解性吸附相比，H2的离解性吸附较为不利。在In2O3(110)表面上，CO2可以与共吸附的H原子通过氢化形成形式酸物种（HCOO）或通过质子化形成碳酸酸根物种。随后，碳酸酸根物种转化为CO和H2O的反应是高度吸热的，但其与表面羟基的分解反应是高度放热的。这一过程消耗了表面碳酸酸根物种，同时生成CO2和H2O。
