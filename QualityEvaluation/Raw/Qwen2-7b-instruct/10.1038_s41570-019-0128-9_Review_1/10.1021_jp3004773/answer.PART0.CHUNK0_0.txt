[1] "The results of CO2, H2, and H2O adsorption on the perfect In2O3(110) surface help us to understand the activity of the In2O3 surface. Among the surface sites, O3In3O4 at the center of the chain is more active than the sites either on the left or on the right."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 can occur either heterolytically or homolytically, resulting in surface hydrides and hydroxyls. Heterolytic dissociative adsorption of H2 is less favorable as compared to the homolytically bound H adatoms."
[3] "Both molecularly and dissociatively adsorption of H2O can occur on the In2O3(110) surface, with the dissociative mode being more stable."
[4] "Although bicarbonate formation is energetically favorable, its subsequent conversion to CO and H2O, COOH + InH  CO + H2O, is highly endothermic. However, disproportion reaction of the bicarbonate and the surface hydroxyl (COOH + OH  CO2 + H2O) is highly exothermic."
[5] "An In2O3-based catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation is expected to suppress the RWGS reaction and increase the selectivity toward formate and its subsequent products."

The In2O3 surface, particularly the O3In3O4 part of the chain, is more active than other sites due to its low coordination number. CO2 activates upon adsorption, forming surface carbonate species with a surface O atom's participation. H2 adsorbs dissociatively, producing surface hydrides and hydroxyls, with heterolytic adsorption being less favorable compared to homolytic adsorption. H2O can adsorb both molecularly and dissociatively on the In2O3(110) surface, with the dissociative mode being more stable. The bicarbonate species, though energetically favorable, does not readily convert to CO and H2O, which blocks the RWGS reaction. Instead, the disproportion reaction with a surface hydroxyl is energetically favorable and kinetically feasible, enhancing the selectivity towards formate and its products.

In2O3表面，特别是链中的O3In3O4部分，由于其较低的配位数而更活跃。CO2在吸附时激活，并与表面O原子参与形成表面碳酸盐物种。H2以离解方式吸附，产生表面氢和羟基，其中异裂吸附比均裂吸附更不有利。H2O可以在In2O3(110)表面上以分子式或离解方式吸附，其中离解模式更为稳定。二水合物物种虽然从能量上是可取的，但不容易转化为CO和H2O，这阻止了RWGS反应。相反，与表面羟基的过量反应是能量上有利且动力学可行的，从而增加了对碳酸盐及其产物的选择性。
