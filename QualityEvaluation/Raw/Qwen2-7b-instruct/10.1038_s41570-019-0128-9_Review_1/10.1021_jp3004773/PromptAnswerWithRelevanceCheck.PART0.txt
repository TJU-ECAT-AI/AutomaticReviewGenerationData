[1] "The results of CO2, H2, and H2O adsorption on the perfect In2O3(110) surface help us to understand the activity of the In2O3 surface. Among the surface sites, O3In3O4 at the center of the chain is more active than the sites either on the left or on the right."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 can occur either heterolytically or homolytically, resulting in surface hydrides and hydroxyls. Heterolytic dissociative adsorption of H2 is less favorable as compared to the homolytically bound H adatoms."
[3] "Both molecularly and dissociatively adsorption of H2O can occur on the In2O3(110) surface, with the dissociative mode being more stable."
[4] "Although bicarbonate formation is energetically favorable, its subsequent conversion to CO and H2O, COOH + InH  CO + H2O, is highly endothermic. However, disproportion reaction of the bicarbonate and the surface hydroxyl (COOH + OH  CO2 + H2O) is highly exothermic."
[5] "An In2O3-based catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation is expected to suppress the RWGS reaction and increase the selectivity toward formate and its subsequent products."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The In2O3 surface, particularly the O3In3O4 part of the chain, is more active than other sites due to its low coordination number. CO2 activates upon adsorption, forming surface carbonate species with a surface O atom's participation. H2 adsorbs dissociatively, producing surface hydrides and hydroxyls, with heterolytic adsorption being less favorable compared to homolytic adsorption. H2O can adsorb both molecularly and dissociatively on the In2O3(110) surface, with the dissociative mode being more stable. The bicarbonate species, though energetically favorable, does not readily convert to CO and H2O, which blocks the RWGS reaction. Instead, the disproportion reaction with a surface hydroxyl is energetically favorable and kinetically feasible, enhancing the selectivity towards formate and its products.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
In2O3表面，特别是链中的O3In3O4部分，由于其较低的配位数而更活跃。CO2在吸附时激活，并与表面O原子参与形成表面碳酸盐物种。H2以离解方式吸附，产生表面氢和羟基，其中异裂吸附比均裂吸附更不有利。H2O可以在In2O3(110)表面上以分子式或离解方式吸附，其中离解模式更为稳定。二水合物物种虽然从能量上是可取的，但不容易转化为CO和H2O，这阻止了RWGS反应。相反，与表面羟基的过量反应是能量上有利且动力学可行的，从而增加了对碳酸盐及其产物的选择性。

[7] "We examined two possible pathways for CO2 to react with the coadsorbed H adatoms: (1) CO2 is hydrogenated by the surface hydrides on the In site, forming a formate species (HCOO); (2) CO2 is protonated by the surface hydroxyl, leading to a surface bicarbonate species."
[8] "Although bicarbonate formation is energetically favorable, its subsequent conversion to CO and H2O, COOH + InH → CO + H2O, is highly endothermic."

The study focuses on the adsorption and hydrogenation of CO2 on the (110) surface of In2O3 using density functional theory slab calculations. The O3In3O4 part of the chain is more active than the other OIn rings due to its lower coordination number. CO2 becomes activated upon adsorption, and H2 adsorbs dissociatively, while H2O adsorbs both molecularly and dissociatively. CO2 forms surface carbonate species with the involvement of a surface O atom. Heterolytic dissociative adsorption of H2 is less favored compared to homolytic adsorption. Both molecular and dissociative adsorption of H2O occur on the In2O3(110) surface, with the dissociative mode being more stable. Two possible pathways for CO2 reaction with coadsorbed H adatoms are examined: hydrogenation to form a formate species (HCOO) or protonation to create a bicarbonate species. The subsequent conversion of bicarbonate to CO and H2O is highly endothermic, but its disproportionation with a surface hydroxyl is highly exothermic. This process consumes the surface bicarbonate species, reproducing CO2 and H2O.

本研究利用密度泛函理论表面计算方法，探讨了In2O3(110)表面的CO2吸附和氢化。O3In3O4部分的链比其他OIn环更活跃，由于其较低的配位数。CO2在吸附后被激活，而H2以离解方式吸附，H2O以分子性和离解性两种方式吸附到In2O3(110)表面上，其中离解性吸附更为稳定。CO2形成表面碳酸盐物种，涉及到表面的O原子。与表面H原子的离解性吸附相比，H2的离解性吸附较为不利。在In2O3(110)表面上，CO2可以与共吸附的H原子通过氢化形成形式酸物种（HCOO）或通过质子化形成碳酸酸根物种。随后，碳酸酸根物种转化为CO和H2O的反应是高度吸热的，但其与表面羟基的分解反应是高度放热的。这一过程消耗了表面碳酸酸根物种，同时生成CO2和H2O。

The study investigated CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation on the (110) surface of In2O3 through density functional theory slab calculations. It was found that while the formation of the bicarbonate species is energetically favorable, its subsequent conversion to CO and H2O is highly endothermic. However, the disproportion reaction of the bicarbonate species with a surface hydroxyl is highly exothermic, suggesting it consumes the surface bicarbonate species and reproduces CO2 along with H2O. This indicates that an In2O3-based catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation can suppress the RWGS reaction and enhance the selectivity towards formate and its products.

本研究通过密度泛函理论层状计算方法，探讨了In2O3（110）表面的CO2吸附和氢化。研究发现，虽然碳酸氢盐物种的形成是能量有利的，但其后续转化为CO和H2O是高度吸热的。然而，碳酸氢盐物种与表面羟基的过氧化反应是高度放热的，表明它消耗了表面碳酸氢盐物种并重新生成CO2以及H2O。这表明基于In2O3的催化剂可用于抑制RWGS反应，并提高甲酸及其产物的选择性。
