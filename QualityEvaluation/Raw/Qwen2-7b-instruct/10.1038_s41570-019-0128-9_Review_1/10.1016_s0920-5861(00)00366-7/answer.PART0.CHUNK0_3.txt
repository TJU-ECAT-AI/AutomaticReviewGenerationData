Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K. The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significatively the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction.

The ceria catalysts demonstrated high activity and selectivity for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. In the temperature range of 953 to 993 K, the actual contribution of the heterogeneous catalysis to the formation of C2H4 was 75 to 55%. The incorporation of calcium ions in the solid solution of the ceria crystalline network significantly enhanced the selectivity towards ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as an oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction.

In our initial study [7], we analysed the contribu- tion of the homogeneous and heterogeneous processes in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 on pure ceria. It was found that this is a real het- erogeneous catalytic reaction over CeO2 catalysts. It was concluded that CeO2 is active and selective for the ODE with CO2. The redox Ce+4/Ce+3 of CeO2 can be used for the activation of CO2 and to produce active oxygen species for the reaction.

In our preliminary research, we investigated the contributions of both homogeneous and heterogeneous processes in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 on pure ceria. We discovered that this is indeed a genuine heterogeneous catalytic reaction occurring over ceria-based catalysts. It was established that ceria exhibits activity and selectivity for the ODE with CO2. The reversible redox states of ceria, Ce+4/Ce+3, enable the activation of CO2 and the generation of reactive oxygen species for the reaction.

The reaction in the gas phase between ethane and CO2 was studied in detail in a previous work [8]. It was shown that conversion depended linearly with residence times for total gas flows lower than 200 ml/min. At higher flows, this linearity disappears indicating that the reaction goes on proceeding at the post-catalytic volume, probably by dragging of radical intermediates by the gas flow.

A previous study [8] thoroughly analyzed the reaction between ethane and CO2 in the gas phase. It was revealed that the conversion rate showed a linear relationship with the residence time for total gas flows below 200 ml/min. At higher flow rates, this linearity vanished, suggesting that the reaction continues in the post-catalytic volume, likely due to the transport of radical intermediates by the gas flow.

先前的一项研究[8]详细探讨了乙烷与二氧化碳在气相中的反应。结果显示，在总气体流速低于200ml/min的情况下，转化率与停留时间成线性关系。在更高的流速下，这种线性关系消失，表明反应可能在催化剂后体积继续进行，这可能是由于气体流动拖拽中间自由基所致。

Noteworthily, the catalytic activity was stable for at least 80 h on stream. The catalytic results were also reproducible after treatment with a mixture of He and CO2 at 1023 K for 1 h. It was observed that after catalytic tests, the catalyst samples remained white,which points to the absence of carbon formation on their surface during the reaction.
