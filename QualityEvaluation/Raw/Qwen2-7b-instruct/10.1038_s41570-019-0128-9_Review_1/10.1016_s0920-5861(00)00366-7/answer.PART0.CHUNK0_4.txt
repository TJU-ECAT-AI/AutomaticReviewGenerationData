[1] "Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K."
[2] "The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significantly the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction."
[3] "In the ODE with CO2 over CeO2 catalyst, CeO2 plays the role of a redox catalyst."
[4] "The selectivity to C2H4 of the heterogeneous reaction can be higher than 90% under a proper catalyst composition and reaction condition, and that in addition to H2O, CO is the only non-selective product."

The ceria catalysts are found to be active and selective for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. The contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis ranges from 75% to 55%. The addition of calcium ions in the ceria crystalline network enhances the selectivity towards ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as an oxidant. In the reaction over ceria, CeO2 functions as a redox catalyst. Under optimal conditions, the selectivity for C2H4 in the heterogeneous reaction can surpass 90%. Moreover, besides water (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO) is identified as the sole non-selective product.

在氧化氢化乙烷（ODE）与二氧化碳的反应中，铈催化剂表现出活性和选择性。从953到993开尔文范围内，异相催化作用对C2H4形成的实际贡献为75%至55%。铈晶格网络中钙离子的固溶体增加显著提高了乙烯的选择性和二氧化碳作为氧化剂的效率。在铈氧催化剂上，铈氧化物扮演着红氧化催化剂的角色。在最佳条件下，异相反应中C2H4的选择性可以超过90%。此外，除了水（H2O），碳（CO）是唯一的非选择性产物。
