[1] "Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K."
[2] "The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significantly the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction."
[3] "It was found that CeO2 is active and selective for the ODE with CO2. The redox Ce+4/Ce+3 of CeO2 can be used for the activation of CO2 and to produce active oxygen species for the reaction."
[4] "In the ODE with CO2 over CeO2 catalyst, CeO2 plays the role of a redox catalyst. Therefore, we suggest that the catalytic reaction is carried out via the reduction of the catalyst by C2H6 and its oxidation by CO2, expressed as follows: or expressed in the following equations: 2CeO2 + C2H6 Ce2O3 + C2H4 + H2O (6) Ce2O3 + CO2 2CeO2 + CO (7)"
[5] "The selectivity to C2H4 of the heterogeneous reaction can be higher than 90% under a proper catalyst composition and reaction condition, and that in addition to H2O, CO is the only non-selective product."

Our study shows that ceria-based catalysts are capable of activating CO2 and utilizing it as a selective oxidant for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane. The redox properties and ability to store and release oxygen of CeO2 are evident when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE. The presence of calcium ions in the solid solution of the ceria crystalline network significantly enhances the selectivity towards ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as an oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction. The catalysts exhibit a complex reaction pattern due to the concurrent presence of homogeneous dehydrogenation in the gas phase and heterogeneous catalysis on the catalyst surface. In the ODE with CO2 over CeO2 catalyst, CeO2 acts as a redox catalyst. The catalytic reaction is proposed to occur through the reduction of the catalyst by C2H6 and its subsequent oxidation by CO2, as represented in equations (6) and (7).

The selectivity for C2H4 in the heterogeneous reaction can exceed 90% under suitable catalyst composition and reaction conditions, with water being the only non-selective product besides CO. Given that currently available technologies can utilize CO as raw material, the practical application of this type of reaction could lead to processes that effectively utilize 100% of the carbon-containing products.

我们的研究表明，铈基催化剂能够激活二氧化碳，并将其用作氧化氢化乙烷反应中的选择性氧化剂。铈氧化物的还原性和释放氧气的能力在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂和氧源时得以体现。铈氧化物在固溶体网络中钙离子的存在显著提高了乙烯的选择性以及二氧化碳作为异质反应中的效率。催化剂表现出复杂的反应模式，由于气体相中轻烷烃的同质脱氢与催化剂表面的异质催化同时存在。在铈氧化物催化剂上的二氧化碳氧化氢化反应中，铈氧化物充当了还原催化剂。催化反应被提议通过催化剂由C2H6的还原和随后由CO2的氧化进行，如方程（6）和（7）所示。

在异质反应中，C2H4的选择性可以超过90%，在合适的催化剂组成和反应条件下，水是唯一非选择性产物，除了CO。鉴于当前可用的技术可以将CO作为原料使用，这种类型的反应的应用可能能够导致有效利用100%碳含产物的过程。
