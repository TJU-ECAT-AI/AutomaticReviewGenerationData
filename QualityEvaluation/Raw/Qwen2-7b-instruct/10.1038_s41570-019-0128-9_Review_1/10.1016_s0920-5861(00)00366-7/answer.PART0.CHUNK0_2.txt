"Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K."
"The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significatively the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction."
"In our initial study [7], we analysed the contribu- tion of the homogeneous and heterogeneous processes in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 on pure ceria. It was found that this is a real het- erogeneous catalytic reaction over CeO2 catalysts."
"The reaction tests were carried out at short residence-time to maintain the ethane conversion relatively low, in such a way that the contribution from heterogeneous catalysis to the title reaction may be estimated on the basis of addition principle of the contributions from homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis."
"It is clear from the figure that ceria-based catalysts show a fairly good catalytic performance for the ODE with CO2. The reaction may be expressed as Eq. (2)."
"Taking into account the different stoichiometry between ethane and CO2 in the two heterogeneous re- actions (2) and (5) and their formation rates, it is pos- sible to calculate the effectiveness of CO2 for selective oxidation (i.e. the percentage of CO2 taking part in the selective ODE reaction (2)) and the actual contribution from heterogeneous ODE with CO2 to the formation"

The document discusses the use of ceria catalysts for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, highlighting their activity and selectivity for forming C2H4. Calcium ions in the ceria network enhance the selectivity for ethene and CO2's efficiency as an oxidant. The study also examines the contribution of heterogeneous catalysis to the overall reaction, noting that it can account for up to 95% of C2H4 formation. Short residence times are employed to estimate the contribution from heterogeneous catalysis based on the addition principle of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Ceria-based catalysts demonstrate good performance in ODE with CO2, and the document explains how to calculate CO2's effectiveness in selective oxidation and its actual contribution to C2H4 formation.

文献讨论了铈催化剂在乙烷与二氧化碳氧化氢化反应中的活性和选择性，特别强调了它们对形成C2H4的作用。铈网络中的钙离子显著提高了乙烯的选择性和二氧化碳作为氧化剂的效率。研究还分析了异相催化作用对总体反应的贡献，指出它可以占到C2H4生成量的95%以上。通过使用较短的停留时间来估计异相催化作用的贡献，基于同相和异相催化作用贡献的加和原则。铈基催化剂在CO2参与下的乙烷氧化氢化反应中表现出良好的性能，并解释了如何计算二氧化碳在选择性氧化中的有效性及其实际对C2H4生成的贡献。
