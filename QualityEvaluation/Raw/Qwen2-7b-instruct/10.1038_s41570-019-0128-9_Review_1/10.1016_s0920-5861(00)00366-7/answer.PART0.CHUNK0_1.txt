[1] "Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K."
[2] "The presence of calcium ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significantly the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction."
[3] "The selectivity to olefin is highly increased by the solid solution of calcium ions in the cubic framework of CeO2."
[4] "The overall reaction, i.e. (6)+(7), is reaction (2)."
[5] "Therefore, the redox properties and the ability to store and release oxygen of CeO2 are also seen when CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in the ODE."

The ceria catalysts are effective in the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, contributing significantly to the formation of C2H4. The addition of calcium ions in the ceria crystalline network enhances the selectivity towards ethene and improves CO2's efficiency as an oxidant. Calcium ions in the cubic framework of CeO2 significantly increase the selectivity for olefin formation. The redox properties of CeO2 enable it to act as an effective catalyst for CO2 in the oxidehydrogenation process.
