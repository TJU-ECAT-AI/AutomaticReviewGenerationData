However, the provided document does not contain direct comparisons between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts (specifically Fe3Ni1/CeO2) and vanadium oxide catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms, nor does it discuss the roles of support materials, composition, and structural factors in determining their performance, challenges, and potential for improvement. Therefore, the document does not provide specific information to answer the second question.
