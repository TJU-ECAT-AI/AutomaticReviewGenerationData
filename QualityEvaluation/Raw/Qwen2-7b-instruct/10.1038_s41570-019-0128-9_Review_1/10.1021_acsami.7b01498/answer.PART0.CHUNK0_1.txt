<questions>
How do FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, compare with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms, and what roles do support materials, composition, and structural factors play in determining their performance, challenges, and potential for improvement?
</questions>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Comparing FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions, the study highlights differences in activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. The support material, composition, and structural factors significantly influence the performance of these catalysts. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, the specific combination of metal oxides and the ceria component affects the catalytic properties differently than vanadium oxide catalysts. Challenges include optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity, as well as improving stability under reaction conditions. Potential for improvement lies in refining the catalyst composition and structure to enhance efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.
