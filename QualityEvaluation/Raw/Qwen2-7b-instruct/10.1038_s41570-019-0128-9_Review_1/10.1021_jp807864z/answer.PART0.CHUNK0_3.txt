[1] "Among the four polymorphs (R-, -, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3) of gallium oxide, -Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity, high thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area."
[2] "The initial C-H bond can be activated by the active sites on the surface, resulting a propyl radical physically or chemically absorbed on the surface; the propoxide or propylgallium species or propyl radical releases a H atom to form propene; and the last step is hydrogen desorption from the surface in the form of H2 as the major product to complete the catalytic cycle or in the form of H2O as a minor product leading to the reduction of the catalyst."
[3] "The results show that the abilities of different sites to abstract H atom from propyl are in the order of O(2) > O(3) > O(2)H > Ga."
[4] "For the V2O5 surface, Fu et al.72 found that the H-abstraction abilities of the lattice O sites and surface OH groups are similar. However, on the Ga2O3(100) surface the activity of the O sites decreases a lot once they have become hydroxyl groups."

The study focuses on the conversion of propane to propene on pure gallium oxide surface (-Ga2O3), detailing the initial C-H bond activation, formation of propyl radical, and propene production. The process involves a series of steps including the formation of propyl radical, the release of a hydrogen atom to form propene, and finally, hydrogen desorption from the surface. The study reveals that the ability of different sites to abstract hydrogen from propyl varies, with O(2) being the most active, followed by O(3), O(2)H, and Ga. The research also points out that on the Ga2O3(100) surface, the activity of oxygen sites decreases significantly once they become hydroxyl groups.

研究主要关注在纯镓氧化物表面（-Ga2O3）上丙烷转化为丙烯的过程，详细描述了初始C-H键活化、丙基自由基形成以及丙烯生成的步骤。该过程包括形成丙基自由基、释放氢原子生成丙烯和最终从表面脱氢三个步骤。研究发现，不同位点对丙基中氢原子的抽取能力有所不同，其中O(2)活性最高，其次是O(3)，O(2)H和Ga。研究还指出，在Ga2O3(100)表面上，一旦氧位点成为羟基，其活性会显著降低。
