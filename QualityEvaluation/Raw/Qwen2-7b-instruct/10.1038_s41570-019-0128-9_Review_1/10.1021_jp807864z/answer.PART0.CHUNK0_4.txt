3.1.1. O(2) Site Pathways. (a) O(2)-X-C. The energy
profiles of these pathways and the structures of the cyclic TSs are depicted in Figure 2. The O(2)-Ga site pair can be regarded as a Lewis acid-base pair since the active site pair is formed by a positively charged gallium atom and a negatively charged oxygen atom. This step is 9.9 kcal/mol endothermic with an energy barrier of 25.3 kcal/mol (TS1, Figure 2), which is lower than the barrier for the initial methane activation (28.7 kcal/ mol)46 but is higher than the barrier for the initial ethane activation (16.8 kcal/mol)47 on the zeolite-supported gallium atom. For the homolytic activation on the O(2)-O(2) site pair,the process is -8.9 kcal/mol exothermic with an energy barrier 38.8 kcal/mol (TS2).

3.2.2. O(3) Site Pathways. The O(3) site pathways are similar
to the O(2) site pathways except that some TSs could not be located and the energy profiles for pathways with TS located are shifted to higher energies since O(3)H group is less stable than O(2)H group. The energy barrier of the O(3)-Ga-C pathway is 16.4 kcal/mol (Figure 3) higher than that of the O(2)-Ga-C pathway. In addition, this reaction is highly endothermic with a reaction energy of 31.1 kcal/mol, and the resulting product is much less stable than that formed through theO(2)-gapathways.

3.2.3. Ga Site Pathways. All the TSs for the activation of
the initial C-H bond by the Ga site to form gallium hydride,either via concerted or radical mechanism, could not be located.

1. The O(2) site pathway for propane activation involves a stepwise radical mechanism, where the energy barrier for breaking the first C-H bond is 25.3 kcal/mol, which is lower than the barrier for methane activation (28.7 kcal/mol) but higher than the barrier for ethane activation (16.8 kcal/mol) on the zeolite-supported gallium atom. The homolytic activation on the O(2)-O(2) site pair is -8.9 kcal/mol exothermic with an energy barrier of 38.8 kcal/mol.

2. The O(3) site pathways resemble the O(2) site pathways, but some transition states could not be located, and the energy profiles for pathways with transition states located are shifted to higher energies due to the less stability of the O(3)H group. The energy barrier for the O(3)-Ga-C pathway is 16.4 kcal/mol higher than that of the O(2)-Ga-C pathway, and the reaction is highly endothermic with a reaction energy of 31.1 kcal/mol, resulting in a less stable product compared to those formed through O(2)-based pathways.

3. Activation of the initial C-H bond by the Ga site to form gallium hydride could not be located through concerted or radical mechanisms.

1. O(2)位点路径中的丙烷活化涉及逐步的自由基机制，第一个C-H键断裂的能量壁垒为25.3 kcal/mol，这低于甲烷激活（28.7 kcal/mol）的能量壁垒，但高于支撑在硅酸盐上的乙烷激活（16.8 kcal/mol）。O(2)-O(2)位点对的同裂解激活是-8.9 kcal/mol放热反应，具有38.8 kcal/mol的能量壁垒。

2. O(3)位点路径类似于O(2)位点路径，但一些过渡状态无法被定位，能量图谱中包含过渡状态的路径能量值更高，由于O(3)H组分的稳定性较低。O(3)-Ga-C路径的能量壁垒比O(2)-Ga-C路径高出16.4 kcal/mol，反应是高度吸热的，反应能量为31.1 kcal/mol，导致产物的稳定性远低于基于O(2)路径的产物。

3. 针对镓位点激活初始C-H键形成镓氢化物的过渡状态，无论是通过协同还是自由基机制，都无法被定位。
