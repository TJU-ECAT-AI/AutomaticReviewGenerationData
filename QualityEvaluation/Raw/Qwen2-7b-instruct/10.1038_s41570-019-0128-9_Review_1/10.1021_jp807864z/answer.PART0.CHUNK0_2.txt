[1] "Considering the overoxidation in the presence of O2, CO2 also becomes a promising mild oxidant introduced in the alkanes dehydrogenation reactions2-10 because CO2 would partially suppress the catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition through Boudouard reaction."
[2] "Our results also indicate that dehydrogenation of propane mainly follows a direct dehydrogenation mechanism (DDH), whereas oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is energetically less feasible but cannot be ruled out in the presence of mild oxidant such as CO2."

The document suggests that in the context of alkanes dehydrogenation reactions, CO2 is a viable mild oxidant that could be introduced. It helps mitigate the overoxidation issue typically associated with oxygen, thereby partially inhibiting catalyst deactivation caused by carbon deposition through the Boudouard reaction. The dehydrogenation of propane is primarily carried out via a direct dehydrogenation mechanism (DDH), though oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) remains a less energetically favorable process. However, ODH cannot be completely dismissed, especially when milder oxidants like CO2 are present.

文档表明，在烷烃脱氢反应中，CO2可以作为一种有前景的温和氧化剂引入。它有助于减轻氧气引起的过氧化问题，从而部分抑制由于布杜瓦德反应导致的催化剂失活。丙烷的脱氢主要通过直接脱氢机制（DDH）进行，而氧化脱氢（ODH）在能量上更不划算，但不能完全排除，尤其是在存在如CO2这样的温和氧化剂的情况下。
