[1] "Considering the overoxidation in the presence of O2, CO2 also becomes a promising mild oxidant introduced in the alkanes dehydrogenation reactions2-10 because CO2 would partially suppress the catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition through Boudouard reaction."
[2] "Micgorczyk30 suggested that carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface may contribute to the decrease in propene yield and introduced CO2 in the reaction to remove carbon deposition and improve propene yield."
[3] "In the presence or absence of CO2, a series of metal oxide catalysts have been studied in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, and among them Ga2O3 is a highly effective one."
[4] "However, increasing temperatures would favor thermal cracking of light alkanes to carbon deposition and always lead to decrease of the product yield."
[5] "On the gallium oxide catalyst, the selectivity of alkene products is usually above 90%, and the activity is also good."

The document does not directly compare FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. However, it discusses the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in alkanes dehydrogenation reactions, particularly over Ga2O3 catalysts. Carbon deposition is mentioned as a factor that can decrease propene yield, and CO2 is suggested as a way to mitigate this issue. The document highlights that Ga2O3 is an effective catalyst for alkanes dehydrogenation, with high selectivity and activity. The challenges of increasing temperatures favoring thermal cracking and carbon deposition are also discussed. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, the document does not provide specific comparisons or details on their performance, composition, or structural factors in CO2-ODH reactions. The role of support materials, composition, and structural factors in determining the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts would depend on their unique properties and how they interact with the CO2 environment in comparison to vanadium oxide catalysts.

文档并未直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂与氧化钒催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能。然而，它讨论了CO2作为烷烃脱氢反应中温和氧化剂的应用，特别是在镓氧化物催化剂上的应用。碳沉积被提及为降低丙烯产率的因素，并且提出CO2可以作为减少碳沉积和提高丙烯产率的方法。文档强调了镓氧化物在烷烃脱氢反应中的高效性，其产物选择性和活性通常很高。还讨论了增加温度有利于轻烷烃热裂解并导致产品产率下降的问题。关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，文档没有提供具体的比较或它们在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能、组成或结构因素的细节。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的性能取决于其独特的性质及其与CO2环境的相互作用方式，这可能与氧化钒催化剂不同。
