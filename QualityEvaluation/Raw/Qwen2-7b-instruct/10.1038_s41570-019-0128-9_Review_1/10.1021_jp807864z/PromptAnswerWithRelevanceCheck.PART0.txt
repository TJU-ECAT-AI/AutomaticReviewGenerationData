3.1.1. O(2) Site Pathways.
(a) O(2)-X-C. The energy
profiles of these pathways and the structures of the cyclic TSs are depicted in Figure 2. The O(2)-Ga site pair can be regarded as a Lewis acid-base pair since the active site pair is formed by a positively charged gallium atom and a negatively charged oxygen atom. This step is 9.9 kcal/mol endothermic with an energy barrier of 25.3 kcal/mol (TS1, Figure 2), which is lower than the barrier for the initial methane activation (28.7 kcal/ mol)46 but is higher than the barrier for the initial ethane activation (16.8 kcal/mol)47 on the zeolite-supported gallium atom.
(b) O(2)-X-R. As for the radical mechanism (R), all pathways share the same initial step, i.e., H abstraction by the same O(2) site. As can be seen from Figure 2, the energy barrier for the first H abstraction from propane is 18.1 kcal/mol. A physically adsorbed propyl radical is formed and its adsorption energy is 4.5 kcal/mol.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In the study of propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3(100) surface, the activation of the initial C-H bond primarily follows a radical mechanism facilitated by the two-coordinated surface oxygen site (O(2)). This mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from propane, resulting in the formation of a propyl radical and a hydroxyl group (O(2)H). Subsequently, the physically adsorbed propyl radical can form either propoxide or propylgallium intermediates. Following this, propene is produced through the abstraction of another hydrogen atom from the propyl, propoxide, or propylgallium by either surface oxygen or gallium sites. The H abstraction by the O(2) site consistently demonstrates a lower energy barrier. However, the departure of hydrogen atoms from hydroxyl groups in the form of either H2 or H2O proves challenging. Moreover, the formation of propene through H abstraction by the O(2) site tends to have a higher adsorption energy, making it prone to further dehydrogenation or oligomerization, which can lead to the fast deactivation of the catalyst. On the contrary, the formation of H2 from GaH and hydroxyl group is more straightforward but requires overcoming a higher energy barrier.

在对Ga2O3(100)表面的丙烷脱氢作用的研究中，初始C-H键的活化主要遵循由表面氧原子双配位(O(2))执行的自由基机制。该机制涉及从丙烷中提取氢原子，形成丙基自由基和羟基组（O(2)H）。随后，物理吸附的丙基自由基可以形成丙氧基或丙基镓中间体。接着，通过表面氧或镓站点从丙基、丙氧基或丙基镓中提取另一个氢原子来形成丙烯。O(2)站点的H提取始终具有较低的能量壁垒。然而，水合物中的氢原子以H2或H2O的形式离开表面的挑战很大。此外，通过O(2)站点形成的丙烯由于较高的吸附能，倾向于进一步脱氢或寡聚化，这可能导致催化剂的快速失活。相反，从GaH和羟基形成H2的过程更为直接，但需要克服更高的能量壁垒。

[1] "Considering the overoxidation in the presence of O2, CO2 also becomes a promising mild oxidant introduced in the alkanes dehydrogenation reactions2-10 because CO2 would partially suppress the catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition through Boudouard reaction."
[2] "Micgorczyk30 suggested that carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface may contribute to the decrease in propene yield and introduced CO2 in the reaction to remove carbon deposition and improve propene yield."
[3] "In the presence or absence of CO2, a series of metal oxide catalysts have been studied in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, and among them Ga2O3 is a highly effective one."
[4] "However, increasing temperatures would favor thermal cracking of light alkanes to carbon deposition and always lead to decrease of the product yield."
[5] "On the gallium oxide catalyst, the selectivity of alkene products is usually above 90%, and the activity is also good."

The document does not directly compare FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. However, it discusses the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in alkanes dehydrogenation reactions, particularly over Ga2O3 catalysts. Carbon deposition is mentioned as a factor that can decrease propene yield, and CO2 is suggested as a way to mitigate this issue. The document highlights that Ga2O3 is an effective catalyst for alkanes dehydrogenation, with high selectivity and activity. The challenges of increasing temperatures favoring thermal cracking and carbon deposition are also discussed. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, the document does not provide specific comparisons or details on their performance, composition, or structural factors in CO2-ODH reactions. The role of support materials, composition, and structural factors in determining the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts would depend on their unique properties and how they interact with the CO2 environment in comparison to vanadium oxide catalysts.

文档并未直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂与氧化钒催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能。然而，它讨论了CO2作为烷烃脱氢反应中温和氧化剂的应用，特别是在镓氧化物催化剂上的应用。碳沉积被提及为降低丙烯产率的因素，并且提出CO2可以作为减少碳沉积和提高丙烯产率的方法。文档强调了镓氧化物在烷烃脱氢反应中的高效性，其产物选择性和活性通常很高。还讨论了增加温度有利于轻烷烃热裂解并导致产品产率下降的问题。关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，文档没有提供具体的比较或它们在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能、组成或结构因素的细节。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的性能取决于其独特的性质及其与CO2环境的相互作用方式，这可能与氧化钒催化剂不同。

The document suggests that in the context of alkanes dehydrogenation reactions, CO2 is a viable mild oxidant that could be introduced. It helps mitigate the overoxidation issue typically associated with oxygen, thereby partially inhibiting catalyst deactivation caused by carbon deposition through the Boudouard reaction. The dehydrogenation of propane is primarily carried out via a direct dehydrogenation mechanism (DDH), though oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) remains a less energetically favorable process. However, ODH cannot be completely dismissed, especially when milder oxidants like CO2 are present.

文档表明，在烷烃脱氢反应中，CO2可以作为一种有前景的温和氧化剂引入。它有助于减轻氧气引起的过氧化问题，从而部分抑制由于布杜瓦德反应导致的催化剂失活。丙烷的脱氢主要通过直接脱氢机制（DDH）进行，而氧化脱氢（ODH）在能量上更不划算，但不能完全排除，尤其是在存在如CO2这样的温和氧化剂的情况下。

[1] "Among the four polymorphs (R-, -, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3) of gallium oxide, -Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity, high thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area."
[2] "The initial C-H bond can be activated by the active sites on the surface, resulting a propyl radical physically or chemically absorbed on the surface; the propoxide or propylgallium species or propyl radical releases a H atom to form propene; and the last step is hydrogen desorption from the surface in the form of H2 as the major product to complete the catalytic cycle or in the form of H2O as a minor product leading to the reduction of the catalyst."
[3] "The results show that the abilities of different sites to abstract H atom from propyl are in the order of O(2) > O(3) > O(2)H > Ga."
[4] "For the V2O5 surface, Fu et al.72 found that the H-abstraction abilities of the lattice O sites and surface OH groups are similar. However, on the Ga2O3(100) surface the activity of the O sites decreases a lot once they have become hydroxyl groups."

The study focuses on the conversion of propane to propene on pure gallium oxide surface (-Ga2O3), detailing the initial C-H bond activation, formation of propyl radical, and propene production. The process involves a series of steps including the formation of propyl radical, the release of a hydrogen atom to form propene, and finally, hydrogen desorption from the surface. The study reveals that the ability of different sites to abstract hydrogen from propyl varies, with O(2) being the most active, followed by O(3), O(2)H, and Ga. The research also points out that on the Ga2O3(100) surface, the activity of oxygen sites decreases significantly once they become hydroxyl groups.

For the homolytic activation on the O(2)-O(2) site pair,the process is -8.9 kcal/mol exothermic with an energy barrier 38.8 kcal/mol (TS2).

3.2.2. O(3) Site Pathways. The O(3) site pathways are similar
to the O(2) site pathways except that some TSs could not be located and the energy profiles for pathways with TS located are shifted to higher energies since O(3)H group is less stable than O(2)H group. The energy barrier of the O(3)-Ga-C pathway is 16.4 kcal/mol (Figure 3) higher than that of the O(2)-Ga-C pathway. In addition, this reaction is highly endothermic with a reaction energy of 31.1 kcal/mol, and the resulting product is much less stable than that formed through theO(2)-gapathways.

3.2.3. Ga Site Pathways. All the TSs for the activation of
the initial C-H bond by the Ga site to form gallium hydride,either via concerted or radical mechanism, could not be located.

1. The O(2) site pathway for propane activation involves a stepwise radical mechanism, where the energy barrier for breaking the first C-H bond is 25.3 kcal/mol, which is lower than the barrier for methane activation (28.7 kcal/mol) but higher than the barrier for ethane activation (16.8 kcal/mol) on the zeolite-supported gallium atom. The homolytic activation on the O(2)-O(2) site pair is -8.9 kcal/mol exothermic with an energy barrier of 38.8 kcal/mol.

2. The O(3) site pathways resemble the O(2) site pathways, but some transition states could not be located, and the energy profiles for pathways with transition states located are shifted to higher energies due to the less stability of the O(3)H group. The energy barrier for the O(3)-Ga-C pathway is 16.4 kcal/mol higher than that of the O(2)-Ga-C pathway, and the reaction is highly endothermic with a reaction energy of 31.1 kcal/mol, resulting in a less stable product compared to those formed through O(2)-based pathways.

3. Activation of the initial C-H bond by the Ga site to form gallium hydride could not be located through concerted or radical mechanisms.

1. O(2)位点路径中的丙烷活化涉及逐步的自由基机制，第一个C-H键断裂的能量壁垒为25.3 kcal/mol，这低于甲烷激活（28.7 kcal/mol）的能量壁垒，但高于支撑在硅酸盐上的乙烷激活（16.8 kcal/mol）。O(2)-O(2)位点对的同裂解激活是-8.9 kcal/mol放热反应，具有38.8 kcal/mol的能量壁垒。

2. O(3)位点路径类似于O(2)位点路径，但一些过渡状态无法被定位，能量图谱中包含过渡状态的路径能量值更高，由于O(3)H组分的稳定性较低。O(3)-Ga-C路径的能量壁垒比O(2)-Ga-C路径高出16.4 kcal/mol，反应是高度吸热的，反应能量为31.1 kcal/mol，导致产物的稳定性远低于基于O(2)路径的产物。

3. 针对镓位点激活初始C-H键形成镓氢化物的过渡状态，无论是通过协同还是自由基机制，都无法被定位。
