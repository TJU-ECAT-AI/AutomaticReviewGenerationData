<quotes>
[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated."
[2] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size."
[3] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[4] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[5] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors. In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania."
[6] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[7] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
[8] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48, or SBA-15."
[9] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied."
[10] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."
[11] "In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina, by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime."

[1] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[2] "The use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties."
[3] "The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface."

[1] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[2] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]."
[4] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[5] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
[6] "The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry."
[7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[8] "This implies that while in the production of, say,acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH,better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[9] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."
[10] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
[11] "Indeed, it is quite difficult to obtain a uniform picture concerning those significant catalyst characteristics that determine the performance in alkane ODH, due to the following reasons:"
[12] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated."
[13] "Very often oxygen-lean conditions are used, in order to obtain better selectivity to the olefin; this, however, implies that total oxygen conversion is reached and that, depending on the temperature, reactions leading to the formation of H2 may become significant (see Section 8)."
[14] "Furthermore, this may affect the gas-phase concentration of by-products and co-products (e.g., CO2 and H2O), the presence of which may substantially alter the nature of the cation oxidation state, degree of agglomeration, and type of interaction with the support."
[15] "For reasons of brevity, this review does not discuss the literature published on the ODH of alkanes when carried out with oxidants other than O2."
[16] "Some significant points concerning the reactivity of these systems are:"
[17] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[18] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[19] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[20] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
[21] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
[22] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116]."
[23] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system [113,115], prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."
[24] "4. Supported molybdenum oxide"
[25] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used [56]."
[26] "In the case of molybdena-based systems:"
[27] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde) [122]."

1. Compared to vanadium oxide catalysts, FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts generally exhibit higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions. The support materials, composition, and structural factors play significant roles in determining their performance. Different compositions and structural arrangements of the catalysts can lead to varying degrees of improvement in activity and selectivity. For instance, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts have shown enhanced performance over vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

2. The performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts can be improved by adjusting the composition and structure of the catalyst. Factors such as the amount of Fe and Ni, the ratio of Fe to Ni, and the support material (CeO2 in this case) can influence the catalytic activity and selectivity. The structure of the catalyst, including its morphology and the distribution of active sites, can also impact its performance. The support material CeO2, in particular, can facilitate the interaction between the active components and the reactants, enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

3. Challenges faced in optimizing FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts include finding the optimal composition and structure that maximizes activity and selectivity while minimizing side reactions. Additionally, the catalysts may require specific operating conditions to achieve optimal performance, which can impact industrial applicability. Improvements in understanding the underlying reaction mechanisms and the effects of various factors on catalyst performance are necessary to overcome these challenges.

4. Potential for improvement in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts includes exploring novel synthesis methods, modifying the catalyst composition, and developing advanced support materials. The use of composites or hybrid materials, incorporating additional elements or modifiers, could enhance the catalytic properties. Further studies on the relationship between catalyst structure, composition, and reaction kinetics are essential to guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions.
