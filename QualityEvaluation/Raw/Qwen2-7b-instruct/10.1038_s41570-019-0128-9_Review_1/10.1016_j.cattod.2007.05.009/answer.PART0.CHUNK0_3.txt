[1] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[2] "The use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties."
[3] "The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface."
[4] "For instance, concurrent trends have been reported of the activity per active site and the number of anchoring bonds per site as a function of the surface density [76]."
[5] "For instance, the addition of MgO to Al2O3 [88] or the use of MgAl2O4 [89] as supports for vanadium oxide positively affect the selectivity to propylene [38]."
[6] "Catalytic systems reported in the literature for the period 20002006 and giving alkane conversion higher than 10% have been included. Systems operating in millisecond-contact-time reactors have not been reported."

1. The economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process is determined by the catalyst's effectiveness, specifically its activity in alkane conversion and selectivity towards desired products.
2. Using unconventional oxidants like N2O and CO2 could lead to significant advancements in the field of alkane oxidation, offering unique reactivity patterns and in situ control over catalyst properties.
3. Replacing oxygen with nitrogen dioxide (N2O) can result in a more reduced and selectively active surface.
4. There is a correlation between the activity per active site and the number of anchoring bonds per site as the surface density increases.
5. Adding magnesium oxide (MgO) to aluminum oxide (Al2O3) or using magnesium-aluminum oxide (MgAl2O4) as supports for vanadium oxide enhances propylene selectivity.
6. A compilation of catalytic systems reported in the literature, which achieved alkane conversion greater than 10% during the period of 2000 to 2006, is presented. Systems employing millisecond contact time have not been documented.

1. 一个烷烃基化学过程的经济吸引力最终由催化剂的有效性决定，即烷烃转化的活性和目标产物的选择性。
2. 使用非传统氧化剂如N2O和CO2可能会在这一领域取得重大突破，因为它们能够生成具有特定对烃反应性的特殊O物种，或者实现对活性相性质的原位控制。
3. 将氧气替换为氮氧化物（N2O）会导致表面发展为更还原、更选择性的表面。
4. 活动力每单位活性位点与单位面积上的锚定键数量之间存在正相关关系。
5. 在铝酸盐中添加镁氧化物（MgO）或使用镁铝氧化物（MgAl2O4）作为钒氧化物的支持体可以增强丙烯选择性。
6. 列出了文献中报道的在2000年至2006年间，烷烃转化率大于10%的催化系统。未提及采用毫秒接触时间的系统。
