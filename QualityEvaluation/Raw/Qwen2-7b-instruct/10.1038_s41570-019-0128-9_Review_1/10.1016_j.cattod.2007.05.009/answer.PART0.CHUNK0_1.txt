[1] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In the context of VCoAPO-18, the coexistence of acidic sites (attributable to Co2+ ions) and redox sites (linked to V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+), appears to be a crucial aspect for attaining high ethylene selectivity during ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
