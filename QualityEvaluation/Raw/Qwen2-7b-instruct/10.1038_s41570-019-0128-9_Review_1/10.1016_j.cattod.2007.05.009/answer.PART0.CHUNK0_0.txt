[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated."
[2] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size."
[3] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[4] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[5] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors. In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania."
[6] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[7] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
[8] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48, or SBA-15."
[9] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied."
[10] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."
[11] "In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina, by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime."
