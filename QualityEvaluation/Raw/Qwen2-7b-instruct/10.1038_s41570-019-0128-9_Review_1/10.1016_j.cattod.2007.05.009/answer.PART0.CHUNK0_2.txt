[1] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [4-21]."
[2] "In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"
[3] "Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production?"
[4] "Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g., membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make it possible to improve performances as compared to the traditional configurations?"

The review discusses the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), focusing on the key factors that determine the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts, whether research has led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production, and if using peculiar reactor configurations or non-conventional methods for conducting reactions can improve performance compared to traditional configurations.
