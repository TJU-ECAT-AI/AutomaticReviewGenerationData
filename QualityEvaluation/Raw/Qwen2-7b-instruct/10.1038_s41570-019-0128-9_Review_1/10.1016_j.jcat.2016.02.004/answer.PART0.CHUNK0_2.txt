1. When compared to catalysts like NiPt/CeO2 and NiPd/CeO2, the CoPt/CeO2 catalyst produces the highest quantity of the desired product CO, rather than completely reducing CO2 into CH4.

2. The results illustrate that there is a general increase in the reducibility of active metals upon the formation of bimetallic compounds.

3. The concentrations of carbon-containing products over time for both bimetallic and monometallic catalysts are depicted in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.

4. This finding indicates that the mixed CoPt surface neither selectively scissions the CC bond nor the CH bond, differing from the flow reactor findings which showed selective CC bond scission for reforming over supported CoPt catalysts.

5. On this surface, the oxidation of ethane to form CH3CH2O is more energetically favorable and exothermic than the dehydrogenation of ethane to form CH3CH2.

1. 相对于NiPt/CeO2和NiPd/CeO2等其他双金属催化剂，CoPt/CeO2催化剂生成的期望产物CO量最高，而不是完全将CO2还原成CH4。

2. 结果表明，形成双金属化合物后活性金属的可还原性通常会增加。

3. 图4和图5分别显示了双金属和单金属催化剂中碳含量产物在0至10小时内随时间的变化浓度。

4. 这一结果表明，混合CoPt表面既不选择性地断裂CC键也不选择性地断裂CH键，与流反应器结果不同，后者显示在支持的CoPt催化剂上进行重整时选择性断裂CC键。

5. 在这个表面上，乙烷氧化形成CH3CH2O的能量更易于释放且更有利于，而乙烷脱氢形成CH3CH2则需要更高的能量。
