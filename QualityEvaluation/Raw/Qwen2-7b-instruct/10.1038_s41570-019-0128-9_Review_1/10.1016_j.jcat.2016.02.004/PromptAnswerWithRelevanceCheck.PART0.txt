The comparison of catalysts FexNiy/CeO2, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions involves assessing their activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. The literature discusses how the performance of these catalysts is influenced by factors such as support materials, composition, and structure. It highlights that FeNi/CeO2 catalysts show promising selectivity towards the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway for producing ethylene, rather than the CO2 reforming pathway that vanadium oxide catalysts might favor. The differences in activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms are attributed to the unique properties of FeNi/CeO2, including the role of support materials, composition, and structural factors in enhancing catalytic performance. Challenges in improving these catalysts include optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity, understanding the precise reaction pathways, and addressing potential issues related to stability and durability. Future research directions aim to refine catalyst composition, modify support materials, and develop strategies to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of CO2-ODH reactions using FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts.

比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2与氧化钒催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能涉及评估它们的活性、选择性和反应机制。文献讨论了这些催化剂性能受支持材料、组成和结构因素的影响。它强调FeNi/CeO2催化剂在通过CH键断裂产生乙烯的氧化脱氢途径中表现出有希望的选择性，而不是vanadium oxide催化剂可能倾向于的CO2重整途径。活性、选择性和反应机制之间的差异归因于FeNi/CeO2的独特性质，包括支持材料、组成和结构因素在提高催化性能方面的作用。改进这些催化剂的挑战包括优化活性与选择性之间的平衡，理解精确的反应途径，并解决稳定性与耐用性相关的问题。未来研究方向旨在细化催化剂组成、修改支持材料并开发策略以增强CO2-ODH反应中使用FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的效率和选择性。

The catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts, including CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2, is compared for the reaction of CO2 and ethane. These catalysts show enhanced catalytic stability compared to monometallic catalysts. In terms of selectivity, CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, and NiMo/CeO2 favor the reforming pathway, producing syngas via the cleavage of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds. Meanwhile, FeNi/CeO2 exhibits promising selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway, producing ethylene via the cleavage of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 confirm distinct reaction pathways, aligning with the experimental findings.

对于二氧化碳和乙烷的反应，比较了包括CoPt/CeO2、CoMo/CeO2、NiMo/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2在内的双金属催化剂的催化性能。这些催化剂的催化稳定性比单一金属催化剂高。从选择性来看，CoPt/CeO2、CoMo/CeO2和NiMo/CeO2倾向于重整途径，通过碳-碳（CC）键断裂产生合成气。同时，FeNi/CeO2显示出对氧化脱氢途径的有前景的选择性，通过碳-氢（CH）键断裂产生乙烯。密度泛函理论（DFT）在CoPt/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2上的计算结果证实了不同的反应途径，与实验结果一致。

1. When compared to catalysts like NiPt/CeO2 and NiPd/CeO2, the CoPt/CeO2 catalyst produces the highest quantity of the desired product CO, rather than completely reducing CO2 into CH4.

2. The results illustrate that there is a general increase in the reducibility of active metals upon the formation of bimetallic compounds.

3. The concentrations of carbon-containing products over time for both bimetallic and monometallic catalysts are depicted in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.

4. This finding indicates that the mixed CoPt surface neither selectively scissions the CC bond nor the CH bond, differing from the flow reactor findings which showed selective CC bond scission for reforming over supported CoPt catalysts.

5. On this surface, the oxidation of ethane to form CH3CH2O is more energetically favorable and exothermic than the dehydrogenation of ethane to form CH3CH2.

1. 相对于NiPt/CeO2和NiPd/CeO2等其他双金属催化剂，CoPt/CeO2催化剂生成的期望产物CO量最高，而不是完全将CO2还原成CH4。

2. 结果表明，形成双金属化合物后活性金属的可还原性通常会增加。

3. 图4和图5分别显示了双金属和单金属催化剂中碳含量产物在0至10小时内随时间的变化浓度。

4. 这一结果表明，混合CoPt表面既不选择性地断裂CC键也不选择性地断裂CH键，与流反应器结果不同，后者显示在支持的CoPt催化剂上进行重整时选择性断裂CC键。

5. 在这个表面上，乙烷氧化形成CH3CH2O的能量更易于释放且更有利于，而乙烷脱氢形成CH3CH2则需要更高的能量。

[1] "Compared to other bimetallic catalysts such as NiPt/CeO2 and NiPd/CeO2, CoPt/CeO2 produces the highest amount of the desired product CO, instead of fully reducing CO2 into CH4."
[2] "The reducibility of active metals in supported catalysts is investigated using temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and the comparison of each bimetallic catalyst with respective monometallic catalysts is shown in Fig. 3ad for CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2, respectively."
[3] "As summarized in Table 1, among the bimetallic catalysts, on the basis of the mass of the catalysts, CoPt/CeO2 shows the highest conversions for CO2 and ethane, 44.7% and 24.0%, respectively, approximately over twofold higher than those in the monometallic catalysts."
[4] "This means that by modifying Mo with Co, the selectivity could be tuned from partially selective to dehydrogenation to highly selective toward the reforming pathway."
[5] "Similarly, an enhanced stability is also observed in FeNi/CeO2."
[6] "On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as shown in Fig. 8b, the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage (leading to product CH2-CH2) is energetically more favorable than the pathway for CC bond cleavage. Thus the mixed FeNi(111) surface is predicted to preferentially dehydrogenate ethane to form CH2CH2."

1. In comparison to catalysts like NiPt/CeO2 and NiPd/CeO2, the CoPt/CeO2 catalyst generates the greatest amount of the desired CO product rather than completely reducing CO2 to CH4.
2. The reduction capabilities of active metals within supported catalysts were assessed using temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and this was illustrated in Figure 3 for catalysts including CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2.
3. According to Table 1, when considering catalyst mass, the CoPt/CeO2 catalyst exhibits the highest conversion rates for CO2 and ethane, achieving 44.7% and 24.0% respectively, which is roughly twice that of the monometallic catalysts.
4. Modifying molybdenum with cobalt allows for the tuning of selectivity from partial selectivity to dehydrogenation towards the reforming pathway.
5. Stability enhancements are observed in FeNi/CeO2 catalysts, similar to the improvements seen in the bimetallic catalysts.
6. On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as depicted in Figure 8b, the process for selective CH bond cleavage (yielding product CH2-CH2) is more energetically favorable than the process for CC bond cleavage. Consequently, the mixed FeNi(111) surface is forecasted to predominantly dehydrogenate ethane into CH2CH2.

3. 根据表1，以催化剂质量为准，CoPt/CeO2催化剂对CO2和乙烷的转化率最高，分别达到44.7%和24.0%，这大约是单金属催化剂的两倍。
4. 将钼改性为钴可以将选择性从部分选择性调整到脱氢至重整途径的高选择性。
5. 在FeNi/CeO2催化剂中观察到了稳定性提升，这与bimetallic催化剂中的改善情况相似。
6. 如图8b所示，在混合FeNi(111)表面上，选择性CH键断裂（产生产品CH2-CH2）的过程比CC键断裂的过程更为有利。因此，混合FeNi(111)表面预期主要将乙烷脱氢成CH2CH2。

The catalytic performance of CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalysts, along with their selectivities for CO2 and ethane reactions, were compared. The results showed that all bimetallic catalysts exhibited enhanced stability compared to their monometallic counterparts. Specifically, CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, and NiMo/CeO2 catalysts favored the reforming pathway to produce syngas via CC bond cleavage, whereas FeNi/CeO2 demonstrated promising selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to produce ethylene via CH bond cleavage. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations corroborated these experimental findings, supporting the distinct reaction pathways of these catalysts.
