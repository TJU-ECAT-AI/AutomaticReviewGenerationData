[1] "The catalytic performance of precious metal bimetallic catalyst, CoPt/CeO2, and non-precious metal bimetallic catalysts, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2 is compared for the reaction of CO2 and ethane."
[2] "In general the catalytic stability is enhanced in all bimetallic catalysts over the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[3] "In terms of selectivity, CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, and NiMo/CeO2 favor the reforming pathway to produce syngas via the CC bond cleavage, while FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity to the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to produce ethylene via the CH bond cleavage."
[4] "DFT calculated energy profiles on CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 confirm different reaction pathways, consistent with the experimental results."

The catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts, including CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2, is compared for the reaction of CO2 and ethane. These catalysts show enhanced catalytic stability compared to monometallic catalysts. In terms of selectivity, CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, and NiMo/CeO2 favor the reforming pathway, producing syngas via the cleavage of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds. Meanwhile, FeNi/CeO2 exhibits promising selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway, producing ethylene via the cleavage of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 confirm distinct reaction pathways, aligning with the experimental findings.

对于二氧化碳和乙烷的反应，比较了包括CoPt/CeO2、CoMo/CeO2、NiMo/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2在内的双金属催化剂的催化性能。这些催化剂的催化稳定性比单一金属催化剂高。从选择性来看，CoPt/CeO2、CoMo/CeO2和NiMo/CeO2倾向于重整途径，通过碳-碳（CC）键断裂产生合成气。同时，FeNi/CeO2显示出对氧化脱氢途径的有前景的选择性，通过碳-氢（CH）键断裂产生乙烯。密度泛函理论（DFT）在CoPt/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2上的计算结果证实了不同的反应途径，与实验结果一致。
