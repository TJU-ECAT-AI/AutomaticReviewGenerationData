[1] "The catalytic performance of precious metal bimetallic catalyst, CoPt/CeO2, and non-precious metal bimetallic catalysts, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2 is compared for the reaction of CO2 and ethane."
[2] "In general the catalytic stability is enhanced in all bimetallic catalysts over the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[3] "In terms of selectivity, CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, and NiMo/CeO2 favor the reforming pathway to produce syngas via the CC bond cleavage, while FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity to the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to produce ethylene via the CH bond cleavage."
[4] "DFT calculated energy profiles on CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 confirm different reaction pathways, consistent with the experimental results."

The catalytic performance of CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalysts, along with their selectivities for CO2 and ethane reactions, were compared. The results showed that all bimetallic catalysts exhibited enhanced stability compared to their monometallic counterparts. Specifically, CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, and NiMo/CeO2 catalysts favored the reforming pathway to produce syngas via CC bond cleavage, whereas FeNi/CeO2 demonstrated promising selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to produce ethylene via CH bond cleavage. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations corroborated these experimental findings, supporting the distinct reaction pathways of these catalysts.

对CoPt/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2双金属催化剂及其CO2和乙烷反应的催化性能进行了比较。结果显示，所有双金属催化剂的稳定性均优于其单一金属催化剂。具体而言，CoPt/CeO2、CoMo/CeO2和NiMo/CeO2催化剂倾向于通过CC键断裂的重整途径生产合成气，而FeNi/CeO2则表现出在通过CH键断裂的氧化脱氢途径生产乙烯的有希望的选择性。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算支持这些实验结果，确认了这些催化剂的各自不同的反应途径。
