[1] "The catalytic performance of precious metal bimetallic catalyst, CoPt/CeO2, and non-precious metal bimetallic catalysts, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2 is compared for the reaction of CO2 and ethane."
[2] "In terms of selectivity, CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, and NiMo/CeO2 favor the reforming pathway to produce syngas via the CC bond cleavage, while FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity to the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to produce ethylene via the CH bond cleavage."
[3] "DFT calculated energy profiles on CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 confirm different reaction pathways, consistent with the experimental results."

The comparison of catalysts FexNiy/CeO2, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions involves assessing their activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. The literature discusses how the performance of these catalysts is influenced by factors such as support materials, composition, and structure. It highlights that FeNi/CeO2 catalysts show promising selectivity towards the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway for producing ethylene, rather than the CO2 reforming pathway that vanadium oxide catalysts might favor. The differences in activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms are attributed to the unique properties of FeNi/CeO2, including the role of support materials, composition, and structural factors in enhancing catalytic performance. Challenges in improving these catalysts include optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity, understanding the precise reaction pathways, and addressing potential issues related to stability and durability. Future research directions aim to refine catalyst composition, modify support materials, and develop strategies to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of CO2-ODH reactions using FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts.
