[1] "Compared to other bimetallic catalysts such as NiPt/CeO2 and NiPd/CeO2, CoPt/CeO2 produces the highest amount of the desired product CO, instead of fully reducing CO2 into CH4."
[2] "The reducibility of active metals in supported catalysts is investigated using temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and the comparison of each bimetallic catalyst with respective monometallic catalysts is shown in Fig. 3ad for CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2, respectively."
[3] "As summarized in Table 1, among the bimetallic catalysts, on the basis of the mass of the catalysts, CoPt/CeO2 shows the highest conversions for CO2 and ethane, 44.7% and 24.0%, respectively, approximately over twofold higher than those in the monometallic catalysts."
[4] "This means that by modifying Mo with Co, the selectivity could be tuned from partially selective to dehydrogenation to highly selective toward the reforming pathway."
[5] "Similarly, an enhanced stability is also observed in FeNi/CeO2."
[6] "On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as shown in Fig. 8b, the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage (leading to product CH2-CH2) is energetically more favorable than the pathway for CC bond cleavage. Thus the mixed FeNi(111) surface is predicted to preferentially dehydrogenate ethane to form CH2CH2."

1. In comparison to catalysts like NiPt/CeO2 and NiPd/CeO2, the CoPt/CeO2 catalyst generates the greatest amount of the desired CO product rather than completely reducing CO2 to CH4.
2. The reduction capabilities of active metals within supported catalysts were assessed using temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and this was illustrated in Figure 3 for catalysts including CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2.
3. According to Table 1, when considering catalyst mass, the CoPt/CeO2 catalyst exhibits the highest conversion rates for CO2 and ethane, achieving 44.7% and 24.0% respectively, which is roughly twice that of the monometallic catalysts.
4. Modifying molybdenum with cobalt allows for the tuning of selectivity from partial selectivity to dehydrogenation towards the reforming pathway.
5. Stability enhancements are observed in FeNi/CeO2 catalysts, similar to the improvements seen in the bimetallic catalysts.
6. On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as depicted in Figure 8b, the process for selective CH bond cleavage (yielding product CH2-CH2) is more energetically favorable than the process for CC bond cleavage. Consequently, the mixed FeNi(111) surface is forecasted to predominantly dehydrogenate ethane into CH2CH2.

1. 相对于NiPt/CeO2和NiPd/CeO2等催化剂，CoPt/CeO2催化剂产生所需的CO产物最多，而不是完全将CO2还原为CH4。
2. 通过温度程序化还原（TPR）评估了支持催化剂中活性金属的可还原性，并在图3中展示了包括CoPt/CeO2、CoMo/CeO2、NiMo/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2在内的催化剂与各自单金属催化剂的比较。
3. 根据表1，以催化剂质量为准，CoPt/CeO2催化剂对CO2和乙烷的转化率最高，分别达到44.7%和24.0%，这大约是单金属催化剂的两倍。
4. 将钼改性为钴可以将选择性从部分选择性调整到脱氢至重整途径的高选择性。
5. 在FeNi/CeO2催化剂中观察到了稳定性提升，这与bimetallic催化剂中的改善情况相似。
6. 如图8b所示，在混合FeNi(111)表面上，选择性CH键断裂（产生产品CH2-CH2）的过程比CC键断裂的过程更为有利。因此，混合FeNi(111)表面预期主要将乙烷脱氢成CH2CH2。
