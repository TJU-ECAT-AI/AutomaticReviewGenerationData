[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated."
[2] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[4] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway."

Answer: The supported gallium oxide catalysts Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 exhibit high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Conversely, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO are ineffective for this purpose. Carbon dioxide has a dual role in the reaction: positively removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. The dehydrogenation process likely follows a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than a redox mechanism.

1. 钴氧化物催化剂Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2在脱氢丙烷生成丙烯方面表现出高活性。相反，Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO对于脱氢丙烷无效。二氧化碳在反应中具有双重作用：通过逆水煤气变换反应积极去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，消极地置换催化剂上的基本位点上的丙烷。脱氢过程可能遵循异裂解途径，而不是氧化还原机制。
