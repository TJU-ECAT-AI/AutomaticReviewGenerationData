The dehydrogenation of propane to propene was studied over supported gallium oxide catalysts in the absence or presence of CO2. Gallium oxide catalysts supported on titanium dioxide (Ga2O3/TiO2), aluminum oxide (Ga2O3/Al2O3), and zirconium oxide (Ga2O3/ZrO2) showed high activity, while those supported on silica (Ga2O3/SiO2) and magnesium oxide (Ga2O3/MgO) did not effectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane. High dehydrogenation activity was associated with the abundance of medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface. Carbon dioxide promoted the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The reaction of CO2 involves two opposing roles: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites of the catalyst. The conversion of propane in the presence of CO2 was 32%, 26%, and 30% over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. The dehydrogenation reaction proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

在无二氧化碳或二氧化碳存在的条件下，对不同支持的镓氧化物催化剂的丙烷脱氢反应进行了研究。在钛酸盐（Ga2O3/TiO2）、铝酸盐（Ga2O3/Al2O3）和锆酸盐（Ga2O3/ZrO2）上负载的镓氧化物催化剂显示出高活性，而以二氧化硅（Ga2O3/SiO2）和氧化镁（Ga2O3/MgO）为载体的催化剂则不有效地催化丙烷脱氢。高脱氢活性与催化剂表面中等强度酸性位点的丰富有关。二氧化碳促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的催化脱氢活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。二氧化碳反应涉及两个相反的作用：通过逆水煤气转换反应从催化剂表面去除离解吸附的H2的积极作用以及通过布杜瓦反应将丙烷从基本位点置换的消极作用。在二氧化碳存在下，丙烷的转化率为32%、26%和30%，分别对应于Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂。脱氢反应通过异裂分解反应途径进行。
