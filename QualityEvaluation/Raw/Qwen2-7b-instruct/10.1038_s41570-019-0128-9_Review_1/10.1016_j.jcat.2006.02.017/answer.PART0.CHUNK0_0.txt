[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated."
[2] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface."
[4] "Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."
[5] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[6] "Dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism."

1. The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts. 
2. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts showed high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective for the dehydrogenation of propane. 
3. The high activity of the catalysts is associated with the abundance of medium-strong acid sites on their surfaces. 
4. CO2 promotes the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2, but suppresses those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. 
5. The pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions suggest that CO2 plays two contradictory roles in the reaction: it removes dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and displaces propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. 
6. The dehydrogenation reaction likely proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway on the supported gallium oxide catalysts rather than a redox mechanism.

1. 研究了不同支撑镓氧化物催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应在无CO2或存在CO2情况下的活性。
2. Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出高活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO对丙烷脱氢无效。
3. 催化剂的高活性与表面中强酸位点的丰富有关。
4. CO2促进Ga2O3/TiO2的催化脱氢活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。
5. 脉冲反应和H2与丙烷的化学吸附表明，CO2在反应中扮演着两个相反的角色：通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面的离解吸附H2，以及将丙烷从催化剂的基本位点置换掉。
6. 支撑镓氧化物催化剂上的脱氢反应可能通过异裂解反应途径进行，而不是还原氧化机制。
