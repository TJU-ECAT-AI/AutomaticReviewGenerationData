Answer: The supported gallium oxide catalysts Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 exhibit high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Conversely, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO are ineffective for this purpose. Carbon dioxide has a dual role in the reaction: positively removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. The dehydrogenation process likely follows a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than a redox mechanism.

1. 钴氧化物催化剂Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2在脱氢丙烷生成丙烯方面表现出高活性。相反，Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO对于脱氢丙烷无效。二氧化碳在反应中具有双重作用：通过逆水煤气变换反应积极去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，消极地置换催化剂上的基本位点上的丙烷。脱氢过程可能遵循异裂解途径，而不是氧化还原机制。

Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated.
Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. The conversions of propane over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts at 600 C reached 23, 33, and 39%, respectively.
The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface. Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.
The conversion of propane becomes 32, 26, and 30% in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts,respectively.
Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst.
XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species.

The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, including Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2, which showed high activity. In contrast, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for this reaction. The conversion of propane reached 23%, 33%, and 39% at 600°C over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. Carbon dioxide had a promoting effect on the activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The conversion of propane increased to 32%, 26%, and 30% when CO2 was present over the respective catalysts. Pulse reaction results indicated that CO2 had two opposing roles in the reaction: a positive role in removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role in displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. XPS studies revealed that the diverse behaviors of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts could be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species. The dehydrogenation process was suggested to follow a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

研究考察了不同支持镓氧化物催化剂（如Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2）对丙烷脱氢到丙烯的活性，发现这些催化剂具有较高活性。相比之下，Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO对于该反应无效。在600°C下，丙烷的转化率分别达到了23%、33%和39%。二氧化碳对Ga2O3/TiO2的催化活性有促进作用，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。在存在二氧化碳时，丙烷的转化率分别增加至32%、26%和30%。脉冲反应结果显示，二氧化碳在反应中具有两种相反的作用：通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的氢分子的积极作用，以及通过Boudouard反应除去基本位点上的丙烷的消极作用。XPS研究表明，五种支持的Ga2O3催化剂的不同行为可以归因于它们与Ga2O3物种之间的不同相互作用。推测脱氢过程遵循异裂解反应途径。

The dehydrogenation of propane to propene was studied over supported gallium oxide catalysts in the absence or presence of CO2. Gallium oxide catalysts supported on titanium dioxide (Ga2O3/TiO2), aluminum oxide (Ga2O3/Al2O3), and zirconium oxide (Ga2O3/ZrO2) showed high activity, while those supported on silica (Ga2O3/SiO2) and magnesium oxide (Ga2O3/MgO) did not effectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane. High dehydrogenation activity was associated with the abundance of medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface. Carbon dioxide promoted the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The reaction of CO2 involves two opposing roles: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites of the catalyst. The conversion of propane in the presence of CO2 was 32%, 26%, and 30% over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. The dehydrogenation reaction proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

在无二氧化碳或二氧化碳存在的条件下，对不同支持的镓氧化物催化剂的丙烷脱氢反应进行了研究。在钛酸盐（Ga2O3/TiO2）、铝酸盐（Ga2O3/Al2O3）和锆酸盐（Ga2O3/ZrO2）上负载的镓氧化物催化剂显示出高活性，而以二氧化硅（Ga2O3/SiO2）和氧化镁（Ga2O3/MgO）为载体的催化剂则不有效地催化丙烷脱氢。高脱氢活性与催化剂表面中等强度酸性位点的丰富有关。二氧化碳促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的催化脱氢活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。二氧化碳反应涉及两个相反的作用：通过逆水煤气转换反应从催化剂表面去除离解吸附的H2的积极作用以及通过布杜瓦反应将丙烷从基本位点置换的消极作用。在二氧化碳存在下，丙烷的转化率为32%、26%和30%，分别对应于Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂。脱氢反应通过异裂分解反应途径进行。
