[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated."
[2] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "The conversion of propane over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts at 600 C reached 23, 33, and 39%, respectively."
[4] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[5] "Dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway."

1. The dehydrogenation of propane to propene was studied over different supported gallium oxide catalysts in the absence or presence of CO2. 
2. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts showed high activity for propane dehydrogenation, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective. 
3. At 600°C, the conversion of propane on Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts reached 23%, 33%, and 39% respectively.  
4. The pulse reaction and chemisorption studies revealed that CO2 has dual roles in the reaction: removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites of the catalyst.
5. The dehydrogenation reaction is proposed to occur through a heterolytic dissociation pathway.

1. 对不同支持的镓氧化物催化剂在CO2的有无下，丙烷脱氢制丙烯进行了研究。
2. Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂显示了高活性用于丙烷脱氢反应，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO则无效。
3. 在600°C下，Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂对丙烷的转化率分别达到23%、33%和39%。  
4. 脉冲反应和化学吸附研究表明，CO2在反应中具有双重作用：通过逆水煤气变换反应去除吸附于催化剂表面的离解氢，并且将基本位点上的丙烷置换出来。
5. 提议的脱氢反应途径为异裂解离路径。
