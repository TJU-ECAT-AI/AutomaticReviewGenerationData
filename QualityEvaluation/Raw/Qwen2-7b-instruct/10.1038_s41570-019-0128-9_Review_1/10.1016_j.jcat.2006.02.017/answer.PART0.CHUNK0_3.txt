Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated.
Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. The conversions of propane over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts at 600 C reached 23, 33, and 39%, respectively.
The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface. Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.
The conversion of propane becomes 32, 26, and 30% in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts,respectively.
Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst.
XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species.
The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, including Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2, which showed high activity. In contrast, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for this reaction. The conversion of propane reached 23%, 33%, and 39% at 600°C over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. Carbon dioxide had a promoting effect on the activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The conversion of propane increased to 32%, 26%, and 30% when CO2 was present over the respective catalysts. Pulse reaction results indicated that CO2 had two opposing roles in the reaction: a positive role in removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role in displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. XPS studies revealed that the diverse behaviors of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts could be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species. The dehydrogenation process was suggested to follow a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

研究考察了不同支持镓氧化物催化剂（如Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2）对丙烷脱氢到丙烯的活性，发现这些催化剂具有较高活性。相比之下，Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO对于该反应无效。在600°C下，丙烷的转化率分别达到了23%、33%和39%。二氧化碳对Ga2O3/TiO2的催化活性有促进作用，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。在存在二氧化碳时，丙烷的转化率分别增加至32%、26%和30%。脉冲反应结果显示，二氧化碳在反应中具有两种相反的作用：通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的氢分子的积极作用，以及通过Boudouard反应除去基本位点上的丙烷的消极作用。XPS研究表明，五种支持的Ga2O3催化剂的不同行为可以归因于它们与Ga2O3物种之间的不同相互作用。推测脱氢过程遵循异裂解反应途径。
