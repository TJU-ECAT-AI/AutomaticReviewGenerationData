1. Hydrocarbons partial oxidation plays a significant role in industrial, environmental, and energy applications. Processes involving C2 to C8 hydrocarbons produce monomers like ethylene, vinyl chloride, ethylene oxide, propene, acrolein, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, butenes, and methacrylic acid.

2. Isobutyric acid ODH to methacrylic acid and its esterification to methyl methacrylate using FePO or (Cu)MoPV (heteropolyacid-type) or iron or nickel oxide based catalysts have been industrialized by different companies.

3. In propane ODH, both propylene and ethylene can be formed depending on the reaction mechanism by dehydrogenation or cracking.

4. Many hydrocarbon partial oxidation processes are quite old, but have been significantly improved over the years through adjustments to preparation and activation procedures, as well as advancements in reactor design and process optimization.

5. Catalytic cracking of alkanes often results in the production of unwanted by-products and may not always be optimized for efficiency.

6. The dehydrogenation process, particularly for propane, is costly due to the high temperature or low pressure requirement to favor propene formation, which increases the overall cost of the process.

7. To make the dehydrogenation process more commercially viable, the equilibrium can be shifted by removing one of the reaction products. This can be achieved through physical means like membranes or chemical means like in-situ catalytic oxidation.

8. The exothermic oxidation associated with this approach facilitates the dehydrogenation process.

9. Alternative reactor designs can be employed to address the limitations of traditional fixed-bed reactors, which may involve issues like secondary reactions and safety concerns related to reactant over oxygen ratios.

10. The use of oxygen-selective membranes can help manage the high risk of explosion associated with mixing H2, O2, and hydrocarbons at high temperatures.

1. 在化工领域，烃类部分氧化反应扮演着重要角色，在工业、环境和能源应用中发挥关键作用。涉及C2到C8的烃类产物可以生成乙烯、氯乙烯、乙二醇、丙烯、丙酮、丙烯酸、丙烯腈、丁烯以及甲基丙烯酸等单体。

2. 通过FePO或(Cu)MoPV（杂多酸型）或铁或镍氧化物催化剂，异丁酸的氧化脱氢转化为甲基丙烯酸及其酯化为甲基甲基丙烯酸已经在不同公司实现了工业化。

3. 对于丙烷氧化脱氢，根据脱氢或裂解的反应机制，既可以形成丙烯也可以形成乙烯。

4. 许多烃类部分氧化过程相当古老，但通过调整制备和激活程序，以及在反应器设计和工艺改进方面的进展，已经得到了显著的改进。

5. 烷烃催化裂解往往会产生许多副产品，并且可能没有得到充分优化。

6. 丙烷脱氢过程的成本较高，因为为了促进丙烯的形成，需要在高温或低压条件下进行，这增加了整个过程的成本。

7. 为了使脱氢过程更具商业吸引力，可以通过移除一个反应产物来改变平衡。这可以通过物理方法（如膜）或化学方法（如原位催化氧化）实现。

8. 这种关联的氧化过程有助于促进脱氢。

9. 可以采用替代的反应器设计来解决传统固定床反应器的局限性，例如可能涉及次级反应和与氧气过量反应有关的安全问题。
