In the case of butane partial oxidation on (VO)2P2O7 catalyst, designated as VPO, and which substituted the old benzene oxidation process in the 1980s. A description of active sites as ensembles of four dimers of octahedral VO6 entities isolated by P2O7 groups (Section 3 and Figure 6) and surface composition during catalytic reaction (Section 5) has already been given above. In such a reaction, maleic anhydride is relatively stable to further oxidation which permits high yields. This is also why, in a moving bed technology, developed in Asturias, Spain by Du Pont Co, the catalyst, encapsulated by porous silica to limit attrition of catalyst grains, that maleic anhydride was further transformed to less stable tetrahydrofurane (THF) by reduction on Pd based catalyst (see below Section 8).

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate varying activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms compared to vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by support materials, composition, and structural factors. For instance, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 might offer unique advantages in terms of stability, selectivity, or activity due to the synergistic effects of the components and the CeO2 support. However, the specifics of how these factors contribute to performance, challenges, and potential for improvement are not extensively detailed in the literature provided. It suggests that while FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise, detailed optimization and characterization of their structure and reactivity are required to fully understand and exploit their potential.

<citationRef>6.2. Case of Ethane</citationRef>
</citation>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the catalytic oxidation of ethane on NiO catalysts, highlighting that the method of preparation significantly influences its activity and selectivity. Ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity are affected by how the catalyst is prepared. For instance, ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity are enhanced when Nb is deposited on NiO, attributed to its role in facilitating the activation of the C-H bond of ethane through electron transfer. Other promoters like Zr, Mg, Li, Ga, Ti, Ta, or alumina have also been proposed to increase ethylene yield on NiO catalysts.

<citationRef>6.3. Case of Propane</citationRef>
</citation>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the catalytic oxidation of propane, mentioning that a significant number of catalysts, primarily based on vanadium, have been investigated for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). The yield of propene varies between 8% and 20%, with VMgO, Mg2V2O7, or MgVxSbyOz being among the catalysts that achieved the highest yields. V2O5 supported on various supports like Al2O3, Bi2O3, La2O3, Nb2O5, SiO2, Sm2O3, or TiO2 has provided inferior performance. The challenge lies in the potential formation of undesired oxygenates or nitriles along with the olefin, and solutions like Pt-based catalysts with short contact times or additional catalysts capable of transforming olefins to unsaturated carboxylic acids or nitriles might be considered.

The document outlines that partial oxidation solid catalysts are complex, requiring multiple functionalities and behaving dynamically during reactions. Key factors influencing their performance include the size, shape, and chemical composition of the catalysts. Challenges in alkane upgrading to olefins, particularly methane, remain significant. Future research aims to develop catalysts that combine desired functionalities in a single phase, eliminating the need for separate catalysts in sequential reactions. The document highlights the importance of continuous optimization of existing catalyst structures and suggests exploring novel catalysts for reactions like the oxidative dehydrogenation of biomass-derived intermediates to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile. It also notes that advancements in reactor design and engineering could enhance the efficiency and safety of selective oxidation processes.

1. Hydrocarbons partial oxidation plays a significant role in industrial, environmental, and energy applications. Processes involving C2 to C8 hydrocarbons produce monomers like ethylene, vinyl chloride, ethylene oxide, propene, acrolein, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, butenes, and methacrylic acid.

2. Isobutyric acid ODH to methacrylic acid and its esterification to methyl methacrylate using FePO or (Cu)MoPV (heteropolyacid-type) or iron or nickel oxide based catalysts have been industrialized by different companies.

3. In propane ODH, both propylene and ethylene can be formed depending on the reaction mechanism by dehydrogenation or cracking.

4. Many hydrocarbon partial oxidation processes are quite old, but have been significantly improved over the years through adjustments to preparation and activation procedures, as well as advancements in reactor design and process optimization.

5. Catalytic cracking of alkanes often results in the production of unwanted by-products and may not always be optimized for efficiency.

6. The dehydrogenation process, particularly for propane, is costly due to the high temperature or low pressure requirement to favor propene formation, which increases the overall cost of the process.

7. To make the dehydrogenation process more commercially viable, the equilibrium can be shifted by removing one of the reaction products. This can be achieved through physical means like membranes or chemical means like in-situ catalytic oxidation.

8. The exothermic oxidation associated with this approach facilitates the dehydrogenation process.

9. Alternative reactor designs can be employed to address the limitations of traditional fixed-bed reactors, which may involve issues like secondary reactions and safety concerns related to reactant over oxygen ratios.

10. The use of oxygen-selective membranes can help manage the high risk of explosion associated with mixing H2, O2, and hydrocarbons at high temperatures.
