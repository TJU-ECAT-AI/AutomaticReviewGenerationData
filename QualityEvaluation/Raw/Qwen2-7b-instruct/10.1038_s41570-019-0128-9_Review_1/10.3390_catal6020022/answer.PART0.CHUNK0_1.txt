In the case of butane partial oxidation on (VO)2P2O7 catalyst, designated as VPO, and which substituted the old benzene oxidation process in the 1980s. A description of active sites as ensembles of four dimers of octahedral VO6 entities isolated by P2O7 groups (Section 3 and Figure 6) and surface composition during catalytic reaction (Section 5) has already been given above. In such a reaction, maleic anhydride is relatively stable to further oxidation which permits high yields. This is also why, in a moving bed technology, developed in Asturias, Spain by Du Pont Co, the catalyst, encapsulated by porous silica to limit attrition of catalyst grains, that maleic anhydride was further transformed to less stable tetrahydrofurane (THF) by reduction on Pd based catalyst (see below Section 8).

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate varying activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms compared to vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by support materials, composition, and structural factors. For instance, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 might offer unique advantages in terms of stability, selectivity, or activity due to the synergistic effects of the components and the CeO2 support. However, the specifics of how these factors contribute to performance, challenges, and potential for improvement are not extensively detailed in the literature provided. It suggests that while FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise, detailed optimization and characterization of their structure and reactivity are required to fully understand and exploit their potential.
