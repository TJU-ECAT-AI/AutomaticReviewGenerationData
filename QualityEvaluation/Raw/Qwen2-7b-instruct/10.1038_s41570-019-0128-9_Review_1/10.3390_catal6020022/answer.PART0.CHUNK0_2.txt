</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the catalytic oxidation of ethane on NiO catalysts, highlighting that the method of preparation significantly influences its activity and selectivity. Ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity are affected by how the catalyst is prepared. For instance, ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity are enhanced when Nb is deposited on NiO, attributed to its role in facilitating the activation of the C-H bond of ethane through electron transfer. Other promoters like Zr, Mg, Li, Ga, Ti, Ta, or alumina have also been proposed to increase ethylene yield on NiO catalysts.

文档讨论了在NiO催化剂上进行乙烷催化氧化，指出制备方法对活性和选择性有显著影响。乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性受到催化剂制备方式的影响。例如，在NiO上沉积Nb可以增强乙烷转化和乙烯选择性，归因于它在促进乙烷中C-H键活化过程中的电子转移作用。其他如Zr、Mg、Li、Ga、Ti、Ta或氧化铝等促动剂也被提议用于提高NiO催化剂上的乙烯产率。

<citationRef>6.3. Case of Propane</citationRef>
</citation>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the catalytic oxidation of propane, mentioning that a significant number of catalysts, primarily based on vanadium, have been investigated for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). The yield of propene varies between 8% and 20%, with VMgO, Mg2V2O7, or MgVxSbyOz being among the catalysts that achieved the highest yields. V2O5 supported on various supports like Al2O3, Bi2O3, La2O3, Nb2O5, SiO2, Sm2O3, or TiO2 has provided inferior performance. The challenge lies in the potential formation of undesired oxygenates or nitriles along with the olefin, and solutions like Pt-based catalysts with short contact times or additional catalysts capable of transforming olefins to unsaturated carboxylic acids or nitriles might be considered.

文档讨论了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的情况，指出大量基于钒的催化剂已被研究用于丙烷催化氧化。丙烯的产率在8%到20%之间，其中VMgO、Mg2V2O7或MgVxSbyOz等催化剂获得了最高产率。V2O5支持在多种载体如Al2O3、Bi2O3、La2O3、Nb2O5、SiO2、Sm2O3或TiO2上提供了较差的性能。挑战在于可能形成除烯烃之外的不希望的氧代物或腈，考虑使用Pt基催化剂与较短接触时间或额外催化剂将烯烃转化为不饱和羧酸或腈可能是解决方法。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document outlines that partial oxidation solid catalysts are complex, requiring multiple functionalities and behaving dynamically during reactions. Key factors influencing their performance include the size, shape, and chemical composition of the catalysts. Challenges in alkane upgrading to olefins, particularly methane, remain significant. Future research aims to develop catalysts that combine desired functionalities in a single phase, eliminating the need for separate catalysts in sequential reactions. The document highlights the importance of continuous optimization of existing catalyst structures and suggests exploring novel catalysts for reactions like the oxidative dehydrogenation of biomass-derived intermediates to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile. It also notes that advancements in reactor design and engineering could enhance the efficiency and safety of selective oxidation processes.
