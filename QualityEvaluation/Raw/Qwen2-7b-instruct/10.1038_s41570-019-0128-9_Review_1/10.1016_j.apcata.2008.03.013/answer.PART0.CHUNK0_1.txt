The study aims to examine the oxygen exchange between CO2 and CeO2, analyzing the role of Pt in this process. In the case of bare CeO2, the oxygen exchange might happen in one step or two consecutive steps. At temperatures between 200 and 300°C, only one oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged, while above 300°C, C16O2 is formed. The participation of Pt in the oxygen exchange varies with temperature; at high temperatures (500-600°C), Pt's effect is not noticeable. However, between 200 and 400°C, Pt accelerates the exchange rate, favoring the exchange of both oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule in two consecutive steps.

研究的目标是详细探讨CO2和CeO2之间的氧交换，并分析Pt在这一过程中的作用。对于裸露的CeO2，氧交换可能发生在一步或两个连续步骤中。在200至300°C之间，C18O2分子只有一个氧原子被交换，而高于300°C时，形成C16O2。在不同温度下，Pt对氧交换的影响有所不同；在500至600°C的高温下，Pt的作用不明显。但在200至400°C之间，Pt加速了交换速率，主要促进了C18O2分子中两个氧原子的两步连续交换。
