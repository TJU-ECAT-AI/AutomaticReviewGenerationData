[1] "It has been suggested that ceria promotes noble metal dispersion,increases the thermal stability of the Al2O3 support, promotes the water gas shift (WGS) and steam reforming reactions, favours catalytic activity at the interfacial noble metal support sites,promotes CO removal through oxidation employing lattice oxygen,and stores and releases oxygen under lean and rich conditions,respectively [1]."
[2] "The capacity to store and release oxygen is one of the particular properties of ceria that makes this material exceptionally effective in several catalytic applications."
[3] "Furthermore, it has been also reported that oxygen released from CeO2 as a consequence of oxygen exchange with gas-phase O2 plays an important role in catalysed soot oxidation [4], which has opened a new route for the development of soot oxidation catalysts based on an active oxygen species for the particulate emission control in Diesel engines."
[4] "In the mentioned study [11], CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 samples were reduced in a H2 gas flow at 400 °C and reoxidised afterwards with 18O2 and, thereby, 18O-containing CeO2 and Pt/ CeO2 samples were obtained."
[5] "It is reasonable to assume that Pt activates CO2 favouring the CO bond breaking at the Pt/CeO2 interface and, therefore, the oxygen exchange processes take place faster in the presence of Pt than in bare CeO2."
[6] "Between 200 and 300 °C, only one oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged and the only reaction taking place is reaction (2)."

The TAP experiments conducted with CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 using labeled CO2 indicate that oxygen exchange occurs between C18O2 molecules and cerium oxide across the temperature range of 200 to 600 °C. The rate and mechanism of exchange are significantly influenced by temperature. In both samples, the exchange rate accelerates with increasing temperature. The exchange of oxygen atoms in the C18O2 molecule primarily occurs in two consecutive steps, applicable to both CeO2 and Pt/CeO2. This pathway is favored over exchanging both oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule simultaneously. For bare CeO2, only one of the oxygen atoms of C18O2 is exchanged between 200 and 300 °C, requiring temperatures above 300 °C for the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2. Above 400 °C, the doubly-exchanged CO2 (C16O2) becomes the primary product. Platinum accelerates the exchange rate of oxygen from C18O2 in the lower temperature range (200-400 °C), mainly favoring the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule. At higher temperatures (above 400 °C), the effect of platinum is less apparent since the exchange rate in bare CeO2 is already fast.

进行的TAP实验使用带有标记CO2的CeO2和Pt/CeO2表明，C18O2分子和铈氧化物之间的氧交换在200至600°C的温度范围内发生。交换率和机制随温度显著变化。在两种样品中，随着温度升高，交换速率加快。C18O2分子中的氧原子主要通过两步连续过程交换，适用于CeO2和Pt/CeO2。这比同时交换C18O2分子中的两个氧原子更受青睐。对于裸露的CeO2，在200至300°C之间，仅有一个氧原子的C18O2被交换，需要高于300°C的温度才能交换C18O2的第二个氧原子。在400°C以上，双交换CO2（C16O2）成为主要产物。铂在较低温度范围（200-400°C）内加速了C18O2中氧的交换，主要促进了C18O2分子的第二氧原子的交换。在400°C以上的较高温度下，铂的效果不那么明显，因为裸露的CeO2的交换速率已经很快。
