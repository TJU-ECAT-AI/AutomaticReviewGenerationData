          [1] "The aim of this study is to investigate the exchange of oxygen between the CO2 and the CeO2 in more detail and to analyse the role of Pt during this exchange process."
          [2] "For this purpose, C18O2 has been used and the exchange mechanism has been studied in an advanced TAP (Temporal Analysis of Products) reactor."
          [3] "Between 200 and 300 8C, only one oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged and the only reaction taking place is reaction (2)."
          [4] "Above 300 8C, C16O2 is formed, but reaction (2) still occurs."
          [5] "This sequence of reactions is described in Scheme 1."
          [6] "In the case of Pt-deposited CeO2, the participation of the noble metal in the oxygen exchange processes depends on temperature."
          [7] "At high temperature (500 and 600 8C), the effect of Pt is not obvious by comparison of the CeO2 (Fig. 5a) and Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 5b) behaviour."
          [8] "Between 200 and 400 8C, Pt accelerates the oxygen exchange rate."
          [9] "It is reasonable to assume that, in this range of temperatures where the oxygen exchange rate between C18O2 and CeO2 is fast, the reactions (2) and (3) take place."
          [10] "On the contrary, at lower temperatures (200400 8C) the behaviour of CeO2 and Pt/ CeO2 is quite different."
          [11] "In the presence of Pt, as discussed for bare CeO2, the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2 could also occur with C18O16O in the gas-phase or with C18O16O-like surface species, and both reaction pathways would yield finally C16O2."
          [12] "The adsorption of C18O2 on Pt and the exchange of the first oxygen atom of C18O2 with Ce16O2 (reactions (4) and (6)) could occurs by two mechanisms."

          The study investigates the detailed exchange of oxygen between CO2 and CeO2, focusing on the role of Pt in the process. It uses C18O2 in an advanced TAP reactor to analyze the exchange mechanism. Between 200 and 300°C, only one oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged, while above 300°C, C16O2 is formed. The exchange occurs in two consecutive steps, as depicted in Scheme 1. The effect of Pt is not evident at high temperatures, but between 200 and 400°C, Pt accelerates the exchange rate, mainly favoring the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule. In the presence of Pt, the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2 can also occur with C18O16O in the gas phase or with C18O16O-like surface species, leading to the formation of C16O2.

          本研究详细探讨了CO2和CeO2之间的氧交换过程，并分析了铂在这一过程中的作用。使用C18O2在高级TAP反应器中研究了交换机制。在200至300°C之间，仅有一个氧原子的C18O2分子被交换，而高于300°C时，C16O2形成。交换过程发生在两个连续步骤中，如方案1所示。在较高温度下，铂的作用不明显，但在200至400°C之间，铂加速了交换速率，主要促进了C18O2分子中第二个氧原子的交换。在铂存在的情况下，C18O2分子的第二个氧原子也可以与C18O16O在气相中或与类似C18O16O的表面物种进行交换，最终形成C16O2。
