[1] "The capacity to store and release oxygen is one of the particular properties of ceria that makes this material exceptionally effective in several catalytic applications."
[2] "Ceria was also found to have an important dry reforming activity (CH4 + CO2) for the H2 and CO production under solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) conditions."
[3] "Furthermore, it has been also reported that oxygen released from CeO2 as a consequence of oxygen exchange with gas-phase O2 plays an important role in catalysed soot oxidation."
[4] "Recent results demonstrate that CeO2 doping, e.g. with La3+, leads to improved mixed oxides and a synergetic effects of Pt and La3+ have been observed in CeLa mixed oxide-supported Pt."
[5] "It is ambitious to define the role of CeO2 in the different catalytic applications mentioned, since the multiple effects have been attributed to this compound, but there is a common point that is related to the ability of noble metal/CeO2 systems to promote the migration/exchange of the oxygen species."
[6] "Most of the studies performed with gas molecules containing isotopic oxygen have been carried out with 18O2."
[7] "There are two reaction paths taking place: (i) both 18O atoms of the 18O2 molecule are exchanged yielding 16O2 or (ii) only one of the 18O atoms of the 18O2 molecule is exchanged yielding 16O18O."
[8] "In a few cases the interaction of CeO2-based materials with molecules containing isotopic oxygen different to 18O2 has been studied in detail."
[9] "Holmgren et al. [11] also reported the evidence of the oxygen exchange between CO2 and CeO2 following an elegant Applied Catalysis A: General 342 (2008) 144149"
[10] "In the mentioned study [11], CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 samples were reduced in a H2 gas flow at 400 8C and reoxidised afterwards with 18O2 and, thereby, 18O-containing CeO2 and Pt/ CeO2 samples were obtained."
[11] "It was concluded that it is possible to dissociatively activate CO2 on a pre-reduced cerium oxide-based catalysts at 300 8C."
[12] "The aim of this study is to investigate the exchange of oxygen between the CO2 and the CeO2 in more detail and to analyse the role of Pt during this exchange process."
[13] "For this purpose, C18O2 has been used and the exchange mechanism has been studied in an advanced TAP (Temporal Analysis of Products) reactor."
[14] "A TAP reactor, the so-called Multitrack, has been used to analyse the interaction between gas-phase C18O2 and the samples CeO2 and Pt/CeO2."
[15] "On one hand, the comparison between the shape of the Ar and CO2 MS profiles provides information about the rate of the oxygen exchange between C18O2 and the samples studied, since it is assumed that there is no chemical interaction between samples and Ar (as seen from the similar shapes of Ar profiles)."
[16] "On the contrary, the temperature affects the exchange of oxygen between the C18O2 and the samples, as it is observed in Fig. 4."
[17] "The exchange of the oxygen of C18O2 with CeO2 (Fig. 4a) increases as the temperature raises and the CO2 total profile becomes sharper as the temperature is increased from 200 to 600 8C."
[18] "Comparison between Fig. 4a and b points out that the temperature has a more accelerating effect on CeO2 (Fig. 4a) than on Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 4b), since all the CO2 total profiles in Fig. 4b are quite similar, and only a minor trend is observed in their shape from 200 to 600 8C."
[19] "One important experimental observation is that the gas profiles do not change with time and the same results are obtained for all the C18O2 pulses performed at each temperature (around 10)."
[20] "This suggests that the formation of stable carbonates does not take place to a great extent under the experimental conditions used for the TAP studies."

The literature discusses the properties and catalytic applications of ceria, including its ability to store and release oxygen, its role in dry reforming reactions, and its use in catalyzing soot oxidation. The text also mentions the effects of ceria doping with other elements like La3+ and the influence of temperature on oxygen exchange mechanisms. The use of isotopically labeled CO2 (specifically 18O2) in studying these exchange processes is highlighted. The study focuses on the exchange of oxygen between CO2 and ceria, analyzing the role of Pt in this process. The exchange is found to occur in sequential steps, especially at lower temperatures, with Pt accelerating the rate of oxygen exchange. The literature also discusses the impact of temperature on the exchange rate and the role of different catalyst materials in oxygen exchange reactions.

文献讨论了氧化铈的特性和催化应用，包括其储存和释放氧的能力、干燥重整反应的作用以及在催化烟炱氧化中的作用。文中也提到了氧化铈掺杂其他元素（如La3+）的影响，以及温度对氧交换机制的影响。特别提到使用含有同位素标记的二氧化碳（特别是18O2）来研究这些交换过程。研究重点是二氧化碳和氧化铈之间的氧交换，分析铂在这一过程中所起的作用。氧交换被发现是在连续步骤中进行的，尤其是在较低温度下，铂加速了氧交换速率。文献还讨论了温度对交换速率的影响以及不同催化剂材料在氧气交换反应中的角色。

[1] "The aim of this study is to investigate the exchange of oxygen between the CO2 and the CeO2 in more detail and to analyse the role of Pt during this exchange process."
[2] "In the case of bare CeO2, the exchange of oxygen with C18O2 could occur in a single step (reaction (1)) or a sequence of two consecutive steps (reactions (2) and (3))."
[3] "Between 200 and 300 8C, only one oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged and the only reaction taking place is reaction (2)."
[4] "Above 300 8C, C16O2 is formed, but reaction (2) still occurs."
[5] "In the case of Pt-deposited CeO2, the participation of the noble metal in the oxygen exchange processes depends on temperature."
[6] "At high temperature (500 and 600 8C), the effect of Pt is not obvious by comparison of the CeO2 (Fig. 5a) and Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 5b) behaviour."
[7] "Between 200 and 400 8C, Pt accelerates the oxygen exchange rate."
[8] "In this case, the exchange of both oxygen atoms of C18O2 at once (reactions (4) and (5)) and/or the exchange of both oxygen atoms of C18O2 consecutively (reactions (4), (6), (7) and (8)) could be also considered."

The study aims to examine the oxygen exchange between CO2 and CeO2, analyzing the role of Pt in this process. In the case of bare CeO2, the oxygen exchange might happen in one step or two consecutive steps. At temperatures between 200 and 300°C, only one oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged, while above 300°C, C16O2 is formed. The participation of Pt in the oxygen exchange varies with temperature; at high temperatures (500-600°C), Pt's effect is not noticeable. However, between 200 and 400°C, Pt accelerates the exchange rate, favoring the exchange of both oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule in two consecutive steps.

研究的目标是详细探讨CO2和CeO2之间的氧交换，并分析Pt在这一过程中的作用。对于裸露的CeO2，氧交换可能发生在一步或两个连续步骤中。在200至300°C之间，C18O2分子只有一个氧原子被交换，而高于300°C时，形成C16O2。在不同温度下，Pt对氧交换的影响有所不同；在500至600°C的高温下，Pt的作用不明显。但在200至400°C之间，Pt加速了交换速率，主要促进了C18O2分子中两个氧原子的两步连续交换。

[1] "For bare and Pt-containing CeO2, the exchange of the oxygen atoms of C18O2 takes place in the whole temperatures range studied, and the oxygen exchange rate increases with temperature."
[2] "Between 200 and 300 8C, only one oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged and the only reaction taking place is reaction (2)."
[3] "Above 300 8C, C16O2 is formed, but reaction (2) still occurs. C16O18O is detected in the whole range of temperatures studied (up to 600 8C), and this demonstrates that the exchange of the two oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule takes place consecutively throughout reactions (2) and (3)."
[4] "At high temperature (500 and 600 8C), the effect of Pt is not obvious by comparison of the CeO2 (Fig. 5a) and Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 5b) behaviour."
[5] "In the presence of Pt, as discussed for bare CeO2, the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2 could also occur with C18O16O in the gas-phase or with C18O16O-like surface species, and both reaction pathways would yield finally C16O2."

The oxygen exchange mechanism between isotopic CO2 and Pt/CeO2 has been studied in an advanced TAP reactor. The exchange of the oxygen atoms of C18O2 takes place across the entire temperature range from 200 to 600 degrees Celsius. The rate of oxygen exchange increases with temperature. In the case of bare CeO2, only one oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged between 200 and 300 degrees Celsius. Above 300 degrees Celsius, both oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule are exchanged consecutively. The presence of Pt accelerates the exchange rate of oxygen from C18O2 at lower temperatures (200-400 degrees Celsius), mainly favoring the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule. However, at higher temperatures (above 400 degrees Celsius), the effect of Pt is less noticeable, as the exchange rate in bare CeO2 is already fast.

在200至600度摄氏度的整个温度范围内，等同位素CO2和Pt/CeO2之间的氧交换机制进行了研究。随着温度的升高，氧交换速率增加。对于裸露的CeO2，在200至300度摄氏度之间，仅有一个氧原子的C18O2分子被交换。高于300度摄氏度时，C18O2分子的两个氧原子会连续交换。在Pt的存在下，与裸露的CeO2相比，它加速了C18O2中氧的交换速率，尤其是在较低温度（200-400度摄氏度）的情况下，主要有利于交换C18O2分子中的第二个氧原子。然而，在高于400度摄氏度的温度下，Pt的效果不太明显，因为在裸露的CeO2中，氧交换速率已经很快。

[1] "It has been suggested that ceria promotes noble metal dispersion,increases the thermal stability of the Al2O3 support, promotes the water gas shift (WGS) and steam reforming reactions, favours catalytic activity at the interfacial noble metal support sites,promotes CO removal through oxidation employing lattice oxygen,and stores and releases oxygen under lean and rich conditions,respectively [1]."
[2] "The capacity to store and release oxygen is one of the particular properties of ceria that makes this material exceptionally effective in several catalytic applications."
[3] "Furthermore, it has been also reported that oxygen released from CeO2 as a consequence of oxygen exchange with gas-phase O2 plays an important role in catalysed soot oxidation [4], which has opened a new route for the development of soot oxidation catalysts based on an active oxygen species for the particulate emission control in Diesel engines."
[4] "In the mentioned study [11], CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 samples were reduced in a H2 gas flow at 400 °C and reoxidised afterwards with 18O2 and, thereby, 18O-containing CeO2 and Pt/ CeO2 samples were obtained."
[5] "It is reasonable to assume that Pt activates CO2 favouring the CO bond breaking at the Pt/CeO2 interface and, therefore, the oxygen exchange processes take place faster in the presence of Pt than in bare CeO2."
[6] "Between 200 and 300 °C, only one oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged and the only reaction taking place is reaction (2)."

The TAP experiments conducted with CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 using labeled CO2 indicate that oxygen exchange occurs between C18O2 molecules and cerium oxide across the temperature range of 200 to 600 °C. The rate and mechanism of exchange are significantly influenced by temperature. In both samples, the exchange rate accelerates with increasing temperature. The exchange of oxygen atoms in the C18O2 molecule primarily occurs in two consecutive steps, applicable to both CeO2 and Pt/CeO2. This pathway is favored over exchanging both oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule simultaneously. For bare CeO2, only one of the oxygen atoms of C18O2 is exchanged between 200 and 300 °C, requiring temperatures above 300 °C for the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2. Above 400 °C, the doubly-exchanged CO2 (C16O2) becomes the primary product. Platinum accelerates the exchange rate of oxygen from C18O2 in the lower temperature range (200-400 °C), mainly favoring the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule. At higher temperatures (above 400 °C), the effect of platinum is less apparent since the exchange rate in bare CeO2 is already fast.

进行的TAP实验使用带有标记CO2的CeO2和Pt/CeO2表明，C18O2分子和铈氧化物之间的氧交换在200至600°C的温度范围内发生。交换率和机制随温度显著变化。在两种样品中，随着温度升高，交换速率加快。C18O2分子中的氧原子主要通过两步连续过程交换，适用于CeO2和Pt/CeO2。这比同时交换C18O2分子中的两个氧原子更受青睐。对于裸露的CeO2，在200至300°C之间，仅有一个氧原子的C18O2被交换，需要高于300°C的温度才能交换C18O2的第二个氧原子。在400°C以上，双交换CO2（C16O2）成为主要产物。铂在较低温度范围（200-400°C）内加速了C18O2中氧的交换，主要促进了C18O2分子的第二氧原子的交换。在400°C以上的较高温度下，铂的效果不那么明显，因为裸露的CeO2的交换速率已经很快。
