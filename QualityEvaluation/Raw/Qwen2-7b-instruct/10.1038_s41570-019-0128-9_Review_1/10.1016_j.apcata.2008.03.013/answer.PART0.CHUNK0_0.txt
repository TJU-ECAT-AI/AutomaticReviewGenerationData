[1] "The capacity to store and release oxygen is one of the particular properties of ceria that makes this material exceptionally effective in several catalytic applications."
[2] "Ceria was also found to have an important dry reforming activity (CH4 + CO2) for the H2 and CO production under solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) conditions."
[3] "Furthermore, it has been also reported that oxygen released from CeO2 as a consequence of oxygen exchange with gas-phase O2 plays an important role in catalysed soot oxidation."
[4] "Recent results demonstrate that CeO2 doping, e.g. with La3+, leads to improved mixed oxides and a synergetic effects of Pt and La3+ have been observed in CeLa mixed oxide-supported Pt."
[5] "It is ambitious to define the role of CeO2 in the different catalytic applications mentioned, since the multiple effects have been attributed to this compound, but there is a common point that is related to the ability of noble metal/CeO2 systems to promote the migration/exchange of the oxygen species."
[6] "Most of the studies performed with gas molecules containing isotopic oxygen have been carried out with 18O2."
[7] "There are two reaction paths taking place: (i) both 18O atoms of the 18O2 molecule are exchanged yielding 16O2 or (ii) only one of the 18O atoms of the 18O2 molecule is exchanged yielding 16O18O."
[8] "In a few cases the interaction of CeO2-based materials with molecules containing isotopic oxygen different to 18O2 has been studied in detail."
[9] "Holmgren et al. [11] also reported the evidence of the oxygen exchange between CO2 and CeO2 following an elegant Applied Catalysis A: General 342 (2008) 144149"
[10] "In the mentioned study [11], CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 samples were reduced in a H2 gas flow at 400 8C and reoxidised afterwards with 18O2 and, thereby, 18O-containing CeO2 and Pt/ CeO2 samples were obtained."
[11] "It was concluded that it is possible to dissociatively activate CO2 on a pre-reduced cerium oxide-based catalysts at 300 8C."
[12] "The aim of this study is to investigate the exchange of oxygen between the CO2 and the CeO2 in more detail and to analyse the role of Pt during this exchange process."
[13] "For this purpose, C18O2 has been used and the exchange mechanism has been studied in an advanced TAP (Temporal Analysis of Products) reactor."
[14] "A TAP reactor, the so-called Multitrack, has been used to analyse the interaction between gas-phase C18O2 and the samples CeO2 and Pt/CeO2."
[15] "On one hand, the comparison between the shape of the Ar and CO2 MS profiles provides information about the rate of the oxygen exchange between C18O2 and the samples studied, since it is assumed that there is no chemical interaction between samples and Ar (as seen from the similar shapes of Ar profiles)."
[16] "On the contrary, the temperature affects the exchange of oxygen between the C18O2 and the samples, as it is observed in Fig. 4."
[17] "The exchange of the oxygen of C18O2 with CeO2 (Fig. 4a) increases as the temperature raises and the CO2 total profile becomes sharper as the temperature is increased from 200 to 600 8C."
[18] "Comparison between Fig. 4a and b points out that the temperature has a more accelerating effect on CeO2 (Fig. 4a) than on Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 4b), since all the CO2 total profiles in Fig. 4b are quite similar, and only a minor trend is observed in their shape from 200 to 600 8C."
[19] "One important experimental observation is that the gas profiles do not change with time and the same results are obtained for all the C18O2 pulses performed at each temperature (around 10)."
[20] "This suggests that the formation of stable carbonates does not take place to a great extent under the experimental conditions used for the TAP studies."

The literature discusses the properties and catalytic applications of ceria, including its ability to store and release oxygen, its role in dry reforming reactions, and its use in catalyzing soot oxidation. The text also mentions the effects of ceria doping with other elements like La3+ and the influence of temperature on oxygen exchange mechanisms. The use of isotopically labeled CO2 (specifically 18O2) in studying these exchange processes is highlighted. The study focuses on the exchange of oxygen between CO2 and ceria, analyzing the role of Pt in this process. The exchange is found to occur in sequential steps, especially at lower temperatures, with Pt accelerating the rate of oxygen exchange. The literature also discusses the impact of temperature on the exchange rate and the role of different catalyst materials in oxygen exchange reactions.

文献讨论了氧化铈的特性和催化应用，包括其储存和释放氧的能力、干燥重整反应的作用以及在催化烟炱氧化中的作用。文中也提到了氧化铈掺杂其他元素（如La3+）的影响，以及温度对氧交换机制的影响。特别提到使用含有同位素标记的二氧化碳（特别是18O2）来研究这些交换过程。研究重点是二氧化碳和氧化铈之间的氧交换，分析铂在这一过程中所起的作用。氧交换被发现是在连续步骤中进行的，尤其是在较低温度下，铂加速了氧交换速率。文献还讨论了温度对交换速率的影响以及不同催化剂材料在氧气交换反应中的角色。
