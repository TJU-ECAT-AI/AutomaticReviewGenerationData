[1] "For bare and Pt-containing CeO2, the exchange of the oxygen atoms of C18O2 takes place in the whole temperatures range studied, and the oxygen exchange rate increases with temperature."
[2] "Between 200 and 300 8C, only one oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged and the only reaction taking place is reaction (2)."
[3] "Above 300 8C, C16O2 is formed, but reaction (2) still occurs. C16O18O is detected in the whole range of temperatures studied (up to 600 8C), and this demonstrates that the exchange of the two oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule takes place consecutively throughout reactions (2) and (3)."
[4] "At high temperature (500 and 600 8C), the effect of Pt is not obvious by comparison of the CeO2 (Fig. 5a) and Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 5b) behaviour."
[5] "In the presence of Pt, as discussed for bare CeO2, the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2 could also occur with C18O16O in the gas-phase or with C18O16O-like surface species, and both reaction pathways would yield finally C16O2."

The oxygen exchange mechanism between isotopic CO2 and Pt/CeO2 has been studied in an advanced TAP reactor. The exchange of the oxygen atoms of C18O2 takes place across the entire temperature range from 200 to 600 degrees Celsius. The rate of oxygen exchange increases with temperature. In the case of bare CeO2, only one oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged between 200 and 300 degrees Celsius. Above 300 degrees Celsius, both oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule are exchanged consecutively. The presence of Pt accelerates the exchange rate of oxygen from C18O2 at lower temperatures (200-400 degrees Celsius), mainly favoring the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule. However, at higher temperatures (above 400 degrees Celsius), the effect of Pt is less noticeable, as the exchange rate in bare CeO2 is already fast.

在200至600度摄氏度的整个温度范围内，等同位素CO2和Pt/CeO2之间的氧交换机制进行了研究。随着温度的升高，氧交换速率增加。对于裸露的CeO2，在200至300度摄氏度之间，仅有一个氧原子的C18O2分子被交换。高于300度摄氏度时，C18O2分子的两个氧原子会连续交换。在Pt的存在下，与裸露的CeO2相比，它加速了C18O2中氧的交换速率，尤其是在较低温度（200-400度摄氏度）的情况下，主要有利于交换C18O2分子中的第二个氧原子。然而，在高于400度摄氏度的温度下，Pt的效果不太明显，因为在裸露的CeO2中，氧交换速率已经很快。
