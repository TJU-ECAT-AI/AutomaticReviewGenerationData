Highly Tunable Selectivity for Syngas-Derived Alkenes over Zinc and Sodium-Modulated Fe5C2 Catalyst

Zn- and Na-modulated Fe catalysts were fabricated by a simple coprecipitation/washing method. Zn greatly changed the size of iron species, serving as the structural promoter, while the existence of Na on the surface of the Fe catalyst alters the electronic structure, making the catalyst very active for CO activation. Most importantly, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface suppresses the hydrogenation of double bonds and promotes desorption of products, which renders the catalyst unexpectedly reactive toward alkenesespecially C5+ alkenes (with more than 50% selectivity in hydrocarbons) while lowering the selectivity for undesired products.

This study demonstrates that zinc and sodium-modulated iron carbide catalysts exhibit exceptional selectivity for the synthesis of alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms. The presence of zinc modifies the size of iron species, acting as a structural promoter, while sodium on the catalyst surface alters the electronic structure. This results in enhanced CO activation and a significant suppression of hydrogenation reactions, favoring the production of alkenes. The catalysts show remarkable selectivity for alkenes, with more than 50% selectivity in hydrocarbon products, while reducing the yield of unwanted products.

这项研究显示，锌和钠修饰的铁碳催化剂对于合成烯烃具有极高的选择性，特别是那些含有五个或更多碳原子的烯烃。锌的存在改变了铁物种的大小，作为结构促进剂，而催化剂表面的钠则改变电子结构。这导致增强CO活化并显著抑制氢化反应，有利于烯烃的生成。这些催化剂显示出对烯烃的高选择性，超过50%的烃产品选择性，同时减少了不期望产物的产量。
