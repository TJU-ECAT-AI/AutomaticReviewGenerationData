[1] "The catalytic performance was evaluated at 340C (Table1). Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
[2] "However, the selectivity of the two catalysts was similar."
[3] "Therefore, in line with XRD and CO adsorption results, this means that Zn works as a structural promoter, the addition of which leads to smaller Fe crystals and therefore more exposed surface sites."
[4] "Consequently, the mass-specific activity is dramatically increased."
[5] "Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
[6] "Most importantly, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface suppresses the hydrogenation of double bonds and promotes desorption of products, which renders the catalyst unexpectedly reactive toward alkenesespecially C5+ alkenes (with more than 50% selectivity in hydrocarbons)while lowering the selectivity for undesired products."

The FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, specifically the Fe3Ni1/CeO2, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. The performance improvement is attributed to the support material, composition, and structural factors. The addition of zinc (Zn) acts as a structural promoter, reducing the size of iron (Fe) crystals and increasing the surface area. This leads to a significant increase in mass-specific activity. The electronic structure of the catalyst surface is crucial, as it suppresses the hydrogenation of double bonds and promotes the desorption of products, making the catalyst highly reactive towards alkenes, particularly those with five or more carbon atoms, while decreasing the selectivity for unwanted products.

FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中表现出与氧化钒催化剂相比的增强活性和选择性。性能的改善归因于支持材料、组成和结构因素。锌（Zn）作为结构促进剂的作用，减少了铁（Fe）晶粒的大小并增加了表面面积。这导致了质量特异性活性的显著提高。催化剂表面的电子结构至关重要，因为它抑制了双键的氢化并促进了产物的脱附，使得催化剂对五碳以上烯烃高度反应，同时降低了对副产品的选择性。
