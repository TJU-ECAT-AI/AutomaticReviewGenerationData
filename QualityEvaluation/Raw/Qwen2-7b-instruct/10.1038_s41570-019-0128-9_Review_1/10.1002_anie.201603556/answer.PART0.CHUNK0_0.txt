[1] "Significantly, deJong etal. reported that lower olefins can be selectively produced on S- and Na-modified Fe catalyst."
[2] "By combining various insitu characterization approaches with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a rationale for the structural modulation provided by Zn and the electronic modulation given by Na ions has been clearly revealed, which is vital for understanding complicated multicomponent FTS catalytic systems and contributes toward the development of highly selective FTS processes."
[3] "Remarkably, by comparing the Fe-Zn-0.81Na catalyst with Fe-1.2Na (the two catalysts have a similar Na content), a drastic increase in CO conversion was observed (from 48.7 to 77.2%)."
[4] "However, the o/p ratio drastically increased with an increase of Na concentration; for catalyst with 0.36%Na the o/p ratio reached 6.3. This ratio goes as high as 7.4 when the loading of Na is 3.4%."
[5] "Clearly, phase segregation occurred because of crystalline phase transformation of the sample from ZnFe2O4 and ZnO, into Fe5C2, Fe3O4, and ZnO; Zn and Fe species were separated with a clear boundary."
[6] "To understand the dramatic effect of Na on the selectivity for FTS products, we carried out reaction mechanism calculations on iron carbide catalysts."

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts in terms of CO2-ODH reactions. However, it does discuss the effects of modifying iron catalysts with zinc and sodium. The introduction of zinc changes the size of iron species, acting as a structural promoter. Sodium, when added to the surface of the iron catalyst, alters the electronic structure, promoting CO activation. Importantly, the electronic structure of the catalyst surface suppresses the hydrogenation of double bonds, leading to unexpected reactivity towards alkenes, especially C5+ alkenes, with high selectivity. The catalysts demonstrate enhanced activity for CO conversion and a significant reduction in CO2 selectivity, indicating effective control over product distribution. The use of sodium ions specifically modifies the catalyst's electronic properties, accelerating alkene desorption and suppressing secondary hydrogenation, thus improving the overall selectivity for alkenes. 

In terms of the roles of support materials, composition, and structural factors, the coprecipitation/washing method employed in the synthesis process allows for precise control over the catalyst's structure and composition. The addition of zinc changes the size of iron species, affecting the catalyst's surface area and reactivity. Sodium ions, when introduced, alter the electronic structure, impacting the catalyst's ability to activate CO and the selectivity for different products. These structural and electronic modifications contribute to the catalysts' high activity and selectivity for alkenes, making them promising for applications in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process.

文献没有直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和二氧化钒催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能。但是，它确实讨论了通过锌和钠修饰铁催化剂的影响。锌的引入改变了铁物种的大小，作为结构促进剂。当钠添加到铁催化剂的表面时，改变电子结构，促进CO激活。重要的是，催化剂表面的电子结构抑制了双键的氢化，导致意想不到的烯烃活性，尤其是C5+烯烃，具有高选择性。这些催化剂显示出增强的CO转化率和显著的CO2选择性的降低，表明对产品分布的有效控制。通过使用钠离子，特别是修改了催化剂的电子性质，加速了烯烃的脱附并抑制了次级氢化，从而提高了整体烯烃选择性。对于Fischer-Tropsch合成过程的应用来说，这些催化剂具有很大的潜力。

在支持材料、组成和结构因素的作用方面，采用共沉淀/洗涤方法进行的合成过程允许对催化剂的结构和组成进行精确控制。锌的添加改变了铁物种的大小，影响催化剂的表面积和活性。当引入钠离子时，改变电子结构，影响催化剂激活CO的能力和不同产品的选择性。这些结构和电子的修改贡献了催化剂的高活性和高烯烃选择性，使其成为Fischer-Tropsch合成过程中的有前景催化剂。
