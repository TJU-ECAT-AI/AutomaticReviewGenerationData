In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500.

The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production.

The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) of each reaction in the modelled, complete reacting system of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 also indicate that further cracking of C3H6 will affect the ultimate yield and selectivity of the final products.

An increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity.

The increase of the overall GHSV can also decrease the C3H8 conversion to a similar extent, but the further cracking of C3H6 cannot be limited.

The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 can be significantly affected by various competing side reactions which are deleterious to the targeted C3H6 yield, selectivity, and indeed to the stability of the operating catalyst.

In this paper, the advantages of specifically selecting C3H8 as the feedstock for CO2 utilisation are advanced for the lower temperature requirements, as compared to both its lighter and heavier alkane homologues, C2H6 and C4H10, respectively.

As an improved reaction of the dehydrogenation of C3H8, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 has been heavily studied over the last decade.

In seeking the possibility to convert alkanes with the energy source from accessible solar heating technology, the temperature range to be targeted in thermodynamic calculations has been localised in the range 300-500 which can be easily achieved, for example, by high pressure steam from a solar heating system.

The thermodynamic analysis was operated across a more comprehensive reaction system which covered all the possible by-products together with the generation of carbon, particularly important in a consideration of catalyst operating lifetimes.

To observe the different performance properties of a catalyst when reactants are saturated, to the availability of active sites, the reactions were operated over a ZrO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst with careful control of the various partial pressures of C3H8 but keeping a constant C3H8/CO2 ratio.

The reaction results exhibited high C3H6 selectivity by inhibiting the selectivity of by-products, which is promising result if these processes are to be applied in any larger, scale up industrial process.

The standard change of reaction in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the dehydrogenation of C2-C4 alkanes with CO2 utilisation were calculated in the temperature range of 300-500.

The highest ΔG was found for the process to dehydrogenate C2H6 with CO2 indicating that it is much harder to operate this reaction as compared to other low-n alkanes at 300-500.

Importantly, ΔG does not keep falling as the carbon number of alkane increases, and to dehydrogenate C3H8 with CO2 appears more feasible than some C4 reactions, for example.

In reality, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is not a simple single reaction but a multiple reaction system.

CO2, as a mild oxidant, is not favoured to gasify the formed carbon deposition.

The C3H8 conversion is observed to be significantly affected by the partial pressure of C3H8 within the temperature range of 300-500.

The C3H8 conversion was sacrificed due to the competitive adsorption between the produced C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules, which was the major reason for the inhibition of further cracking of C3H6.

The reduced level of C2Hx production as compared to that of the selectivity of CH4 was observed).

The decrease of CO yield was not as much as the trend of CO2 conversion; we believe this is due to the carbon gasification by reducing the chromium species (Cr6+/Cr5+) on catalyst surface.

The weight loss starting from 200 was attributed to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air.

The mechanism of C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves the primary activation of C3H8 on the catalyst surface, while CO2 provides a contribution to the reaction equilibrium shift by oxidising H2 generated from the C3H8 dehydrogenation (via the reverse water gas shift reaction).

1. The thermodynamic analysis conducted in the study revealed that the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 in the temperature range of 300-500 is advantageous compared to other alkane homologues, C2H6 and C4H10. The process was found to be more feasible for CO2 utilization due to its lower activation energy and resistance to cracking.

2. By increasing the partial pressure of C3H8, the study demonstrated a significant enhancement in the selectivity of C3H6 production during the dehydrogenation process in the presence of CO2. However, this increase in C3H8 partial pressure led to a decrease in the conversion of C3H8, illustrating the trade-off between conversion and selectivity.

3. The increase in the overall gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) also decreased the C3H8 conversion to a similar extent as increasing the C3H8 partial pressure, but it did not limit the further cracking of C3H6, suggesting that adjusting the GHSV alone cannot improve the selectivity of C3H6 production effectively.

4. The study emphasized the importance of considering competing side reactions and by-products in the dehydrogenation process, as they significantly impact the yield and selectivity of the final products. The thermodynamic analysis covered a comprehensive reaction system to account for all possible by-products and their effects on catalyst stability and performance.

5. The catalytic tests over a ZrO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst showed that the high stability of C3H8 conversion is crucial for maintaining the selectivity of C3H6 production. The results suggested that the enhanced selectivity of C3H6 can be achieved by inhibiting the further cracking of C3H6, which is influenced by the competitive adsorption of C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules on the catalyst surface.

6. The study highlighted the potential of utilizing C3H8 for CO2 conversion through dehydrogenation, as it requires lower temperatures and has lower activation energy compared to lighter and heavier alkane homologues. This makes it an attractive candidate for CO2 utilization processes that can be driven by solar thermal energy, especially considering the ease of achieving temperatures in the 300-500 range using high-pressure steam from solar heating systems.

1. 研究中的热力学分析表明，与轻质和重质烷烃同系物C2H6和C4H10相比，在300-500的温度范围内使用CO2进行C3H8脱氢是利用CO2转化碳氢化合物的有利途径。该过程在CO2利用中更为可行，主要是由于其较低的活化能和裂解抗性。

2. 研究显示，通过增加C3H8的分压，C3H8在CO2存在的条件下进行脱氢过程时，C3H6选择性的显著提高。然而，这种增加C3H8分压导致C3H8转化率下降，说明了转化率和选择性之间的权衡。

3. 增加整体气体小时空速度（GHSV）也使C3H8转化率降低到与增加C3H8分压相似的程度，但并未限制C3H6的进一步裂解，这表明仅调整GHSV不能有效提高C3H6生产的选性。

4. 研究强调了考虑副反应和副产品的必要性，这些副反应对最终产物的产率和选择性有重大影响。热力学分析覆盖了全面的反应系统，以考虑所有可能的副产品及其对催化剂稳定性和性能的影响。

5. 在ZrO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂上的催化测试表明，C3H8转化率的高稳定性对于保持C3H6生产的选择性至关重要。结果表明，通过抑制C3H6的进一步裂解，可以实现C3H6选择性的增强，这受C3H6和失活的C3H8分子在催化剂表面的竞争吸附影响。

6. 本研究强调了利用C3H8作为CO2转化途径的潜力，因为它需要较低的温度和较低的活化能，与较轻和较重的烷烃同系物相比。考虑到通过太阳能热能获取的条件，特别是使用来自太阳能加热系统的高压蒸汽实现300-500范围的温度时，这使其成为CO2利用过程的有吸引力候选者。
