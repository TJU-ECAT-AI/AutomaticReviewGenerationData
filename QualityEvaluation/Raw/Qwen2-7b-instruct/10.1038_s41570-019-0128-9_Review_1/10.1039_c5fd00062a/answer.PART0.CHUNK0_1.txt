[1] "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[2] "An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range."
[3] "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[4] "The shift of the equilibrium state by CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 has been identified from a thermodynamic analysis."
[5] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 can be significantly affected by various competing side reactions which are deleterious to the targeted C3H6 yield, selectivity and indeed to the stability of the operating catalyst."
[6] "In reality, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is not a simple single reaction but a multiple reaction system, as shown in Table 2, mainly coupling the traditional dehydrogenation of C3H8 (reaction 1) and reverse water gas shift (reaction 2)."
[7] "From this analysis, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is recognisably the best alkane to be targeted for a chemical utilisation process for CO2 operating in this temperature range."
[8] "The C3H8 conversion is observed to be significantly affected by the partial pressure of C3H8 within the temperature range of 300-500."
[9] "The C3H8 conversion was sacrificed due to the competitive adsorption between the produced C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules, which was the major reason for the inhibition of further cracking of C3H6."
[10] "The high stability of the C3H8 conversion, as shown in Figure 7, matched the observed high selectivity of the gaseous products, particularly C3H6."
[11] "Thermo gravimetric analysis results and the corresponding derivative weight-to-temperature (D-TGA) plots are displayed in Figure 10."

1. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide was studied in the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius using sustainable solar thermal energy. The calculations highlighted the potential benefits of propane over its lighter and heavier homologues, ethane and butane, in terms of both CO2 activation and coking resistance.

2. Increasing the pressure of propane led to a decrease in its conversion rate, but simultaneously improved the selectivity of propylene production.

3. The shift of the equilibrium state in the dehydrogenation of propane due to the presence of carbon dioxide was confirmed through thermodynamic analysis.

4. Various competing side reactions, detrimental to the targeted yield and selectivity of propylene and the stability of the catalyst, significantly influenced the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide.

5. The dehydrogenation process in the presence of carbon dioxide was not a simple reaction but a complex system involving multiple reactions, primarily coupling the traditional dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water gas shift.

6. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide was identified as the most promising alkane for CO2 utilization processes operating within the specified temperature range.

7. The conversion of propane was significantly influenced by the partial pressure of propane within the 300-500 degree Celsius range.

8. The conversion of propane was suppressed due to competitive adsorption between the generated propylene and inactive propane molecules, which prevented further cracking of propylene.

9. The high stability of propane conversion matched the high selectivity of the gaseous products, especially propylene.

10. Thermo gravimetric analysis revealed that an increase in the fraction of propane gas velocity led to a decrease in propane conversion, but did not limit the further cracking of propylene.

11. The weight loss and its derivative plots obtained from thermogravimetric analysis were illustrated in Figure 10.
