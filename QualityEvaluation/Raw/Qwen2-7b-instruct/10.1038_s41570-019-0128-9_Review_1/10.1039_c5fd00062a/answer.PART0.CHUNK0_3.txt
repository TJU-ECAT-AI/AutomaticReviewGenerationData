The dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered an advantageous method for producing propylene (C3H6). Thermodynamic analyses have been conducted for the dehydrogenation process at temperatures ranging from 300 to 500 degrees Celsius. This process shows enhanced potential compared to its lighter and heavier isomers, ethane (C2H6) and butane (C4H10), respectively. The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) calculations for each reaction in the modeled system confirm that further cracking of propylene influences the final product yield and selectivity. Increasing the partial pressure of propane leads to a decrease in its conversion rate but simultaneously boosts the selectivity of propylene production. The shift of the equilibrium state caused by CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane has been identified through thermodynamic analysis. Various competing side reactions negatively impact the targeted yield and selectivity of propylene, affecting the catalyst's stability. In the search for utilizing alkanes with solar heating technology, the thermodynamic calculations focused on the 300-500 degrees Celsius temperature range, which can be easily achieved using high-pressure steam from a solar heating system. This study explores the thermodynamics of using CO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane as a potential CO2 utilization technique suitable for solar thermal applications. Among the targeted alkanes, propane is recognized as the best choice for a chemical utilization process for CO2 in this temperature range, especially given the availability of solar heating technology for these conditions. The presence of CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, shifting the equilibrium without increasing the temperature. Methane (CH4) production serves as a crucial indicator for measuring the extent of side reactions during the process. Contrary to the stable conversion of propane, the conversion of carbon dioxide rapidly decreases within the first five hours. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves activating propane on the catalyst surface, while CO2 contributes to the equilibrium shift by oxidizing hydrogen generated from the dehydrogenation reaction. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) results demonstrate the weight loss and coke formation during the catalytic process. Enhancing the selectivity of the target propylene product, albeit at the expense of some propane conversion, is deemed acceptable for the final application. This type of CO2 utilization process, operating within the low to medium temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius, offers significant potential for solar thermal chemical processes, which could shift the focus of CO2 utilization from waste management to its use as a valuable chemical resource.
