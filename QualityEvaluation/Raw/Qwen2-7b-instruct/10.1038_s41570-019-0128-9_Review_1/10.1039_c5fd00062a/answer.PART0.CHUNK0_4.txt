1. Thermodynamic calculations were conducted for utilizing CO2 to convert hydrocarbons with the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, focusing on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 in the temperature range of 300-500.
2. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 is an appealing catalytic pathway for producing propylene.
3. Increasing the partial pressure of C3H8 led to a reduction in its conversion but improved the selectivity of C3H6.
4. Compared to methane, the selectivity of carbon dioxide in the reaction was lower, indicating less efficient conversion to carbon.
5. The XRD peak at 2θ=36.18 corresponds to the (1-1-0) phase of Cr2O3 with rhombohedral crystal structure.
6. The weight loss observed starting from 200°C was attributed to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air.
