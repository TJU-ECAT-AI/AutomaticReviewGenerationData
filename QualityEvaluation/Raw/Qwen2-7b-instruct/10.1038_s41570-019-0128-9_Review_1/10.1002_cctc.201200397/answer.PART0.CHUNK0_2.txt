The literature discusses the promotional effect of nickel (Ni) on a chromium oxide (CrOx) catalyst supported on silica (Si) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key points are:

1. Ni promotes the regeneration of active Cr3+ states from reduced Cr2+ states by activating CO2 and facilitating its dissociation to CO and activated O (O*ads) under ODHP reaction conditions.
2. The addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to the 10 wt% Cr/Si catalyst results in higher CO2 conversion and stable production of propylene.
3. The oxidizing ability of CO2 is confirmed by three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analysis, showing most of the Cr3+ state being regenerated in the Ni-promoted catalyst.
4. The ex situ XPS measurements reveal that Ni maintains the catalyst in the Cr3+ state, enabling the regeneration of active sites during the ODHP reaction.
5. The 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst exhibits high stability in the ODHP reaction due to the maintenance of its active Cr3+ states.

文献讨论了镍（Ni）在氧化脱氢反应中对支持在二氧化硅（Si）上的铬氧化物（CrOx）催化剂的促进作用。关键点如下：

1. Ni通过激活CO2并促进其分解为CO和激活的O（O*ads）来促进Cr2+状态向活性Cr3+状态的再生，在氧化脱氢反应条件下。
2. 向10 wt% Cr/Si催化剂中添加0.5 wt% Ni，导致更高的CO2转化率和稳定的丙烯生产。
3. 通过三步H2-温度程序化还原（TPR）分析确认了CO2的氧化能力，结果显示Ni促进了催化剂中大部分Cr3+状态的再生。
4. 通过离线XPS测量发现，Ni维持催化剂处于Cr3+状态，使活性位点在氧化脱氢反应中得到再生。
5. 0.5Ni-Cr/Si催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的稳定性高，原因是保持了其活性的Cr3+状态。
