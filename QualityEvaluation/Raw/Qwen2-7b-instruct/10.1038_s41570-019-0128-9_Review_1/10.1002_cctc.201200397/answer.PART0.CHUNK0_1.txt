1. In the presence of CO2, the surface chromium remains in a higher oxidation state compared to when CO2 is absent during the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.
2. CO2 has limited oxidizing ability due to its thermodynamically stable properties, which limits its capacity to reoxidize reduced chromium oxides.
3. Nickel-based catalysts are utilized in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, demonstrating an exceptional ability to activate CO2 under challenging conditions.
4. Choe et al. studied the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 on Ni(111) using a molecular orbital method within a 25-atom cluster.
5. The generated O*ads from Ni plays a role in reoxidizing the reduced chromium oxide species during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction.
6. Nickel induces the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads) on the catalyst surface.
7. The activated oxygen (O*ads) then regenerates the reduced chromium oxide.
8. The nickel-promoted chromium oxide/silica catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction.
9. Chromium hexavalent states reduce immediately to trivalent states upon interacting with propane, acting as a precursor for active sites.
10. The trivalent states facilitate dehydrogenation, while the generated hydrogen reduces these states to divalent, causing the catalyst's deactivation.
11. The three-step temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis confirms the enhanced oxidizing ability of CO2 and the regeneration of most of the active trivalent chromium states in the nickel-promoted catalyst.
12. Ex situ XPS measurements reveal that the non-promoted catalyst rapidly transforms its active sites from trivalent to inactive divalent states, whereas nickel maintains the catalyst in the trivalent state.
