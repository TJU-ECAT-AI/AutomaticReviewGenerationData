The Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits enhanced stability and high selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) due to the synergistic effect of Ni and CrOx. Ni promotes the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads), which in turn facilitates the regeneration of the active Cr3+ states in CrOx. This process ensures the continuous regeneration of active sites, leading to a stable yield of propylene.

1. Nickel facilitates the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads) under the conditions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction. It also confirms the oxidizing capability of CO2 and contributes to the regeneration of the active Cr3+ state in the catalyst.

2. The addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic activity and stability in the ODHP reaction. The three-step-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis validates the oxidizing ability of CO2 and shows that most of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the ODHP reaction, is restored after the CO2 treatment.

3. Without nickel, the active Cr3+ state in the catalyst rapidly transforms into the inactive Cr2+ state during the ODHP reaction. In contrast, nickel maintains the catalyst's active phase, enabling the stable production of propylene by sustaining the Cr3+ state. This is facilitated by the generation of activated oxygen (O*ads) near nickel.

3. 在没有镍的情况下，催化剂中的活性Cr3+状态在ODHP反应期间迅速转化为不活性的Cr2+状态。相比之下，镍保持了催化剂的活性相，通过维持Cr3+状态来稳定地生产丙烯，这得益于附近镍生成的激活氧（O*ads）。
