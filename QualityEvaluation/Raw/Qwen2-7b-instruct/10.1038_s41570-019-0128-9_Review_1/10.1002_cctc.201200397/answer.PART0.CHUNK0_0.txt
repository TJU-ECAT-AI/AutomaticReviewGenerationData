[1] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions2123 and the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction.24 Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."
[2] "CrOx catalysts supported on the SBA-15 support (Cr/Si) are highly active, they represent potentially promising catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP)."
[3] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[4] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[5] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[6] "The oxidizing ability of CO2 was confirmed by the three-step-TPR analysis, and most of the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction, was regenerated in the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst."
[7] "This allows one to conclude that Ni has superior ability to dissociate CO2 as well as to regenerate the active site in CrOx for the ODHP reaction, which results in a stable yield of propylene."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits enhanced stability and high selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) due to the synergistic effect of Ni and CrOx. Ni promotes the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads), which in turn facilitates the regeneration of the active Cr3+ states in CrOx. This process ensures the continuous regeneration of active sites, leading to a stable yield of propylene.

Ni促进CrOx/SBA-15催化剂在丙烷与CO2的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的稳定性及高选择性，主要得益于Ni和CrOx之间的协同作用。Ni促进CO2分解为CO和活性氧（O*ads），从而促进CrOx中活性Cr3+状态的再生。这一过程确保了活性位点的持续再生，导致了丙烯的稳定产率。
