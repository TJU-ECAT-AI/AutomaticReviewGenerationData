[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "Exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[4] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Ni promotes the stability of the CrOx catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) by maintaining the active Cr3+ state, allowing for the easy regeneration of the active phase upon CO2 treatment, and enhancing the stability of propylene production.

Answer: How does the addition of Ni to the CrOx/Si catalyst affect its performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2?

<quotes>
[1] "N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of SBA-15, Cr/Si, and 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalysts are shown in Figure3, which demonstrates typeIV isotherms with H1-type hysteresis loops for all the samples."
[2] "The mesoporous structures of all catalysts were well maintained after the addition of Ni."
[3] "Structural and textural properties of the catalysts obtained by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis and SAXS are listed in Table1."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The addition of Ni to the CrOx/Si catalyst maintains the mesoporous structure and structural properties, including BET surface area, pore volume, and pore size, indicating that Ni does not significantly alter the physical properties of the catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
向CrOx/Si催化剂中添加Ni后，保持了介孔结构和结构性质，包括BET表面积、孔体积和孔径大小，表明Ni对催化剂的物理性质影响不大。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>
