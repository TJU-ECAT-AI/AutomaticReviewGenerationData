[1] "Ni-induced dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads) under the ODHP catalytic reaction conditions."
[2] "The oxidizing ability of CO2 was confirmed by the three-step-TPR analysis, and most of the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction, was regenerated in the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst."
[3] "In exsitu XPS measurements, the non-promoted catalyst showed a rapid transformation of active sites-reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+ whereas Ni allowed the catalyst to be maintained in the Cr3+ state, which is enabled by the O*ads generated near Ni."

1. Nickel facilitates the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads) under the conditions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction. It also confirms the oxidizing capability of CO2 and contributes to the regeneration of the active Cr3+ state in the catalyst.

2. The addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic activity and stability in the ODHP reaction. The three-step-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis validates the oxidizing ability of CO2 and shows that most of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the ODHP reaction, is restored after the CO2 treatment.

3. Without nickel, the active Cr3+ state in the catalyst rapidly transforms into the inactive Cr2+ state during the ODHP reaction. In contrast, nickel maintains the catalyst's active phase, enabling the stable production of propylene by sustaining the Cr3+ state. This is facilitated by the generation of activated oxygen (O*ads) near nickel.

1. 镍能够促进CO2在ODHP催化反应条件下的分解，形成CO和激活氧（O*ads）。它还验证了CO2的氧化能力，并有助于催化剂中活性Cr3+状态的再生。

2. 向10wt% Cr/Si催化剂中添加0.5wt% Ni能提高ODHP反应中的催化活性和稳定性。三步温度程序化还原（TPR）分析证实了CO2的氧化能力，并表明在CO2处理后大部分对ODHP反应至关重要的Cr3+状态得到恢复。

3. 在没有镍的情况下，催化剂中的活性Cr3+状态在ODHP反应期间迅速转化为不活性的Cr2+状态。相比之下，镍保持了催化剂的活性相，通过维持Cr3+状态来稳定地生产丙烯，这得益于附近镍生成的激活氧（O*ads）。
