[1] "The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures."
[2] "However, it is worth noting that the activating effect of CO2 observed on ceria-zirconia based catalysts disappears when ceria is used as the sole supporting material of the palladium active phase."
[3] "Indeed, the introduction of the smaller Zr4+ cation into the fluorite lattice of CeO2 strongly enhances the efficiency of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple."
[4] "On the one hand, it is well known that CeO2 promotes oxidation of Pd to PdO."
[5] "This implies that the CO2 dissociation must occur to allow some O atoms to be consumed by the Ce-Zr-O material."
[6] "Furthermore, XPS results also clearly indicate that the Ce2(CO3)3 transforms into CeO2 under reaction conditions."
[7] "DRIFTS results also indicate that carbonate species are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C, i.e., above the light-off temperature, ruling out the hypothesis of a carbonates-related CO2 inhibition of the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst."

[2] "The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity."
[3] "Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation. This would be related to the OSC of ceria."
[4] "Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation."
[5] "DRIFTS experiments evidenced that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (at 1425 cm1) was recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He (O migration from the bulk). This would result from the use of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the recovery of full intensity of the peak (reoxidation) was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C."

1. CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and its influence depends on the type of support of the catalyst. The alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but ceria and especially ceria-zirconia as supporting materials for the palladium active phase can promote the reaction even at moderate temperatures.

2. The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the ability of the ceria-zirconia material to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, thereby enhancing its activity.

3. Ceria plays a central role in the activation of CO2, thanks to its oxygen storage capacity. Zirconia is essential to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions and to enable the ceria material to benefit from the presence of some CO2 in the feed, facilitating its activation. This relates to the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria.

4. Cooperation between palladium and ceria is also crucial for CO2 activation. Therefore, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, as reduced centers (Ce3+) are present and some palladium is available to facilitate phase cooperation.

5. DRIFTS experiments demonstrated that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst at 1425 cm1 was recovered more quickly under a CO2 atmosphere than under He, resulting from the utilization of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the reoxidation was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C.

6. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio serves as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) provides a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds primarily based on Ce(III) have a much lower ratio (15% or less).

1. 二氧化碳在甲烷催化燃烧过程中并非惰性，其影响实际上取决于催化剂的支持类型。氧化铝支持的钯催化剂受到二氧化碳抑制，但如果使用氧化铈和特别是氧化铈锆作为钯活性相的支持材料，则二氧化碳可以促进反应，即使是在温和温度下。

2. 在二氧化碳存在下，Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂活动性的提高是由于氧化铈锆材料能够分解二氧化碳为CO和活性氧物种，这些物种迁移到钯相中以维持钯在高度氧化状态，从而增强其活性。

3. 氧化铈在二氧化碳激活过程中起主要作用，这是由于其氧化存储能力。锆是增加铈支持的钯催化剂在常规操作条件下的活性并使铈材料能够利用二氧化碳流中的某些二氧化碳，从而促进其激活的关键，这与铈的氧化存储容量（OSC）相关联。

4. 钯和氧化铈之间的合作也是二氧化碳激活所必需的。因此，在Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂上观察到二氧化碳存在的激活效应，因为存在还原中心（Ce3+）并且存在一些钯以促进相合作。

5. DRIFTS实验表明，在1425 cm1处，Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂的峰值强度在二氧化碳气氛下比在氦气中恢复得更快，在去除还原处理后，这是由于氧化铈锆材料通过其分解二氧化碳来利用周围二氧化碳，然后重新氧化自己。然而，在300 8C时，氧气的重新氧化速度比二氧化碳快得多。

6. 低BE O1s/O1s比率可以作为铈整体氧化状态的相关指标：完全氧化的铈（CeO2）提供约70%的比例，而主要基于Ce(III)的化合物具有更低的比例（15%或更少）。

(1) The presence of CO2 during the catalytic combustion of methane depends on the type of catalyst support. An alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, while ceria and ceria-zirconia supports promote the reaction even at moderate temperatures.

(2) Carbonates formation is not the reason for CO2's influence on the catalytic combustion of methane. Carbonates observed on alumina-supported catalysts are unstable above 300 8C and do not form on ceria-zirconia-supported catalysts.

(3) The improvement in the activity of Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalysts in the presence of CO2 is due to the ceria-zirconia material's ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase to maintain it in an oxidized state, enhancing activity.

(4) Ceria is crucial for the activation of CO2 because of its oxygen storage capacity. Zirconia is needed to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts and enable ceria to utilize CO2, leading to its activation.

(5) Cooperation between palladium and ceria is essential for CO2 activation. The Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst exhibits an activating effect of CO2 due to the presence of reduced centers (Ce3+) and some palladium to facilitate phase cooperation.

(6) DRIFTS experiments revealed that after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst at 1425 cm1 was restored faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He. This is attributed to the ceria-zirconia material reoxidizing itself using surrounding CO2. The reoxidation process is much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C.

(7) The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio serves as a reliable indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria. Fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) yields a ratio of around 70%, while compounds primarily based on Ce(III) have a much lower ratio (15% or less).

(2) 碳酸盐形成不是CO2对甲烷催化燃烧影响的原因。仅在氧化铝支持的催化剂上观察到的碳酸盐在300 8C以上不稳定，并且在铈锆氧化物支持的催化剂上从未形成。

(3) Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂在CO2存在的活性改进是由于铈锆氧化物材料能够将CO2分解为CO和活性氧物种，这些物种迁移到钯相中以维持钯的氧化状态，从而提高活性。

(4) 氧化铈是激活CO2的关键，因为它具有氧气存储能力。氧化锆需要增加铈支持的钯催化剂的活性，并使铈能够利用CO2，从而实现其激活。

(5) 钯和氧化铈之间的合作对于CO2激活是必要的。Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂表现出CO2激活效果，因为存在还原中心（Ce3+）以及一些钯来促进相合作。

(6) DRIFTS实验表明，在去除处理后，Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂上1425 cm1处的峰的完整强度在CO2气氛下比在氦气下恢复得更快。这归因于铈锆氧化物材料通过周围CO2自身重新氧化。该重新氧化过程在300 8C下比在CO2下更快得多。
