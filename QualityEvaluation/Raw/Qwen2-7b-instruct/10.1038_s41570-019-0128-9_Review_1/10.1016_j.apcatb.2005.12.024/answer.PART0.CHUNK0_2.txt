[1] "The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures."
[2] "The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity."
[3] "Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation. This would be related to the OSC of ceria."
[4] "Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation."
[5] "DRIFTS experiments evidenced that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (at 1425 cm1) was recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He (O migration from the bulk). This would result from the use of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the recovery of full intensity of the peak (reoxidation) was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C."
[6] "The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less)."

1. CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and its influence depends on the type of support of the catalyst. The alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but ceria and especially ceria-zirconia as supporting materials for the palladium active phase can promote the reaction even at moderate temperatures.

2. The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the ability of the ceria-zirconia material to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, thereby enhancing its activity.

3. Ceria plays a central role in the activation of CO2, thanks to its oxygen storage capacity. Zirconia is essential to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions and to enable the ceria material to benefit from the presence of some CO2 in the feed, facilitating its activation. This relates to the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria.

4. Cooperation between palladium and ceria is also crucial for CO2 activation. Therefore, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, as reduced centers (Ce3+) are present and some palladium is available to facilitate phase cooperation.

5. DRIFTS experiments demonstrated that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst at 1425 cm1 was recovered more quickly under a CO2 atmosphere than under He, resulting from the utilization of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the reoxidation was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C.

6. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio serves as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) provides a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds primarily based on Ce(III) have a much lower ratio (15% or less).

1. 二氧化碳在甲烷催化燃烧过程中并非惰性，其影响实际上取决于催化剂的支持类型。氧化铝支持的钯催化剂受到二氧化碳抑制，但如果使用氧化铈和特别是氧化铈锆作为钯活性相的支持材料，则二氧化碳可以促进反应，即使是在温和温度下。

2. 在二氧化碳存在下，Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂活动性的提高是由于氧化铈锆材料能够分解二氧化碳为CO和活性氧物种，这些物种迁移到钯相中以维持钯在高度氧化状态，从而增强其活性。

3. 氧化铈在二氧化碳激活过程中起主要作用，这是由于其氧化存储能力。锆是增加铈支持的钯催化剂在常规操作条件下的活性并使铈材料能够利用二氧化碳流中的某些二氧化碳，从而促进其激活的关键，这与铈的氧化存储容量（OSC）相关联。

4. 钯和氧化铈之间的合作也是二氧化碳激活所必需的。因此，在Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂上观察到二氧化碳存在的激活效应，因为存在还原中心（Ce3+）并且存在一些钯以促进相合作。

5. DRIFTS实验表明，在1425 cm1处，Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂的峰值强度在二氧化碳气氛下比在氦气中恢复得更快，在去除还原处理后，这是由于氧化铈锆材料通过其分解二氧化碳来利用周围二氧化碳，然后重新氧化自己。然而，在300 8C时，氧气的重新氧化速度比二氧化碳快得多。

6. 低BE O1s/O1s比率可以作为铈整体氧化状态的相关指标：完全氧化的铈（CeO2）提供约70%的比例，而主要基于Ce(III)的化合物具有更低的比例（15%或更少）。
