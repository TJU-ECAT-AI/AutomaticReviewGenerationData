[1] "The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures."
[2] "The hypothesis of carbonates formation to explain the influence of CO2 upon the CCM reaction process is not relevant, since carbonates species, which are only observed on the alumina-supported catalyst, are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C. Such species were never observed in the case of the ceria-zirconia supported catalyst."
[3] "The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria- zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity."
[4] "Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation."
[5] "Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation."
[6] "DRIFTS experiments evidenced that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (at 1425 cm1) was recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He (O migration from the bulk). This would result from the use of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the recovery of full intensity of the peak (reoxidation) was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C."
[7] "The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less)."

(1) The presence of CO2 during the catalytic combustion of methane depends on the type of catalyst support. An alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, while ceria and ceria-zirconia supports promote the reaction even at moderate temperatures.

(2) Carbonates formation is not the reason for CO2's influence on the catalytic combustion of methane. Carbonates observed on alumina-supported catalysts are unstable above 300 8C and do not form on ceria-zirconia-supported catalysts.

(3) The improvement in the activity of Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalysts in the presence of CO2 is due to the ceria-zirconia material's ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase to maintain it in an oxidized state, enhancing activity.

(4) Ceria is crucial for the activation of CO2 because of its oxygen storage capacity. Zirconia is needed to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts and enable ceria to utilize CO2, leading to its activation.

(5) Cooperation between palladium and ceria is essential for CO2 activation. The Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst exhibits an activating effect of CO2 due to the presence of reduced centers (Ce3+) and some palladium to facilitate phase cooperation.

(6) DRIFTS experiments revealed that after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst at 1425 cm1 was restored faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He. This is attributed to the ceria-zirconia material reoxidizing itself using surrounding CO2. The reoxidation process is much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C.

(7) The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio serves as a reliable indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria. Fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) yields a ratio of around 70%, while compounds primarily based on Ce(III) have a much lower ratio (15% or less).

(1) 在催化燃烧甲烷过程中，CO2的作用取决于催化剂载体的类型。氧化铝支持的钯催化剂受到CO2抑制，而铈和铈锆氧化物的支持材料则促进反应，即使在温和温度下也是如此。

(2) 碳酸盐形成不是CO2对甲烷催化燃烧影响的原因。仅在氧化铝支持的催化剂上观察到的碳酸盐在300 8C以上不稳定，并且在铈锆氧化物支持的催化剂上从未形成。

(3) Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂在CO2存在的活性改进是由于铈锆氧化物材料能够将CO2分解为CO和活性氧物种，这些物种迁移到钯相中以维持钯的氧化状态，从而提高活性。

(4) 氧化铈是激活CO2的关键，因为它具有氧气存储能力。氧化锆需要增加铈支持的钯催化剂的活性，并使铈能够利用CO2，从而实现其激活。

(5) 钯和氧化铈之间的合作对于CO2激活是必要的。Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂表现出CO2激活效果，因为存在还原中心（Ce3+）以及一些钯来促进相合作。

(6) DRIFTS实验表明，在去除处理后，Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂上1425 cm1处的峰的完整强度在CO2气氛下比在氦气下恢复得更快。这归因于铈锆氧化物材料通过周围CO2自身重新氧化。该重新氧化过程在300 8C下比在CO2下更快得多。

(7) 低BE O1s/O1s比率可以作为氧化铈整体氧化状态的可靠指标。完全氧化的铈（CeO2）产生约70%的比例，而主要基于Ce(III)的化合物的比例要低得多（15%或更少）。
