[1] "The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures."
[2] "As can be seen, the presence of CO2 in the feed has an inhibiting effect on the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst (T50 = 430 8C versus 410 8C), but has no significant effect on either the Pd/CeO2 catalyst (T50 = 470 8C versus 465 8C) or the (Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2) mixture (T50 = 400 8C versus 395 8C)."
[3] "An activating effect was observed on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (T50 = 395 8C versus 405 8C)."
[4] "Our XPS results are in line with the hypothesis emitted by Wang et al. [54] concerning the active sites for CO2 activation."
[5] "The oxidizing power of CO2 at low or mild temperature has already been reported in the literature [16,17,52,57,58]."
[6] "Ce2(CO3)3 material was tested for the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane to check the influence of the potential formation of carbonate species on the ceria surface."
[7] "DRIFTS results also indicate that carbonate species are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C, i.e., above the light-off temperature, ruling out the hypothesis of a carbonates- related CO2 inhibition of the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst."

1. CO2 influences the catalytic combustion of methane differently depending on the catalyst's support: it inhibits alumina-supported palladium catalysts, but promotes ceria and ceria-zirconia supported catalysts, especially at moderate temperatures.
2. CO2 inhibits the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst but has no significant effect on the Pd/CeO2 catalyst or the Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2 mixture.
3. The Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst exhibits an activating effect when CO2 is present in the feed.
4. XPS results align with Wang et al.'s hypothesis regarding the active sites for CO2 activation.
5. The literature reports the oxidizing power of CO2 at low or mild temperatures.
6. Testing Ce2(CO3)3 for catalytic combustion of methane revealed its instability and lack of activity under reaction conditions.
7. DRIFTS results confirm that carbonate species are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C, eliminating the carbonates-related CO2 inhibition hypothesis for the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst.

1. CO2在催化剂支持类型的不同下，对甲烷催化燃烧的影响也不同：它抑制了氧化铝支持的钯催化剂，但促进了铈和铈锆氧化物支持的催化剂，特别是在温和温度下。
2. CO2抑制了Pd/g-Al2O3催化剂，但对Pd/CeO2催化剂或Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2混合物没有显著影响。
3. 当CO2存在于流体中时，Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂表现出激活效果。
4. XPS结果与王等人提出的关于CO2激活位点的假设一致。
5. 文献报道了低或温和温度下CO2的氧化能力。
6. 测试Ce2(CO3)3用于甲烷催化燃烧揭示了其在反应条件下的不稳定性及其缺乏活性。
7. DRIFTS结果证实，碳酸盐物种在300 8C以上反应条件下不稳定，排除了CO2相关的碳酸盐抑制Pd/g-Al2O3催化剂的假设。
