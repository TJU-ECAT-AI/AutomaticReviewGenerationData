[1] "The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures."
[2] "It is worth noting that the activating effect of CO2 observed on ceria-zirconia based catalysts disappears when ceria is used as the sole supporting material of the palladium active phase. Thus, it seems that zirconia is necessary in order to (i) increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions and (ii) allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed."
[3] "The hypothesis of carbonates formation to explain the influence of CO2 upon the CCM reaction process is not relevant, since carbonates species, which are only observed on the alumina-supported catalyst, are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C. Such species were never observed in the case of the ceria-zirconia supported catalyst."
[4] "The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity."
[5] "Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation."
[6] "Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation."
[7] "DRIFTS experiments evidenced that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (at 1425 cm1) was recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He (O migration from the bulk). This would result from the use of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the recovery of full intensity of the peak (reoxidation) was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C."
[8] "The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less)."

1. CO2 influences catalytic combustion of methane depending on the catalyst's support type. Alumina-supported palladium catalysts are inhibited by CO2, whereas ceria and ceria-zirconia supports promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures.

2. Zirconia is essential for increasing ceria-supported palladium catalyst activity and enabling ceria to benefit from CO2 presence.

3. Carbonates formation does not explain CO2's influence on catalytic combustion of methane, as carbonates are unstable above 300°C and not observed on ceria-zirconia-supported catalysts.

4. CO2 activation on Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalysts involves ceria-zirconia dissociating CO2 into CO and active oxygen species migrating to palladium, maintaining its high oxidation state.

5. Zirconia boosts ceria-supported palladium catalyst activity in conventional conditions and enables ceria to utilize CO2 through its oxygen storage capacity.

6. CO2 activation requires cooperation between palladium and ceria, with ceria-zirconia's ability to dissociate CO2 playing a key role.

7. DRIFTS experiments show faster reoxidation of the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst peak under CO2 than under He, indicating CO2's role in reoxidizing ceria-zirconia via its dissociation.

8. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio is a reliable indicator of ceria's overall oxidation state, with fully oxidized ceria showing a ratio of around 70%, compared to much lower ratios for Ce(III) compounds.

1. 在催化燃烧甲烷过程中，二氧化碳的影响实际上取决于催化剂的支持类型。氧化铝支持的钯催化剂被二氧化碳抑制，而铈和铈锆复合物作为活性相支持材料可以促进反应，即使是在温和温度下。

2. 氧化锆对于提高铈支持的钯催化剂的活性，并使铈能够利用二氧化碳的存在是必要的。

3. 二氧化碳形成过程不能解释甲烷催化燃烧过程中二氧化碳的作用，因为这些碳酸盐仅在氧化铝支持催化剂上观察到，在300°C以上的条件下不稳定，并且未在铈锆复合物支持催化剂上观察到。

4. Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂中二氧化碳的激活涉及铈锆复合物分解二氧化碳为CO和活性氧物种，这些物种迁移到钯上，维持钯的高氧化状态，从而提高活性。

5. 氧化锆对于常规操作条件下的铈支持钯催化剂的活性有提升作用，并且允许铈利用二氧化碳，通过其氧存储能力。

6. CO2激活需要钯和铈之间的合作，铈锆复合物分解二氧化碳的能力在其中起着关键作用。

7. DRIFTS实验显示，在300°C下，Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂峰在二氧化碳气氛中的完全再氧化速度比在氦气中快，这表明二氧化碳通过其分解，有助于铈锆复合物再氧化自身。

8. 低BE O1s/O1s比率可以作为铈总体氧化状态的可靠指标，完全氧化的铈显示出约70%的比例，相比之下，主要基于Ce(III)的化合物的比率要低得多。
