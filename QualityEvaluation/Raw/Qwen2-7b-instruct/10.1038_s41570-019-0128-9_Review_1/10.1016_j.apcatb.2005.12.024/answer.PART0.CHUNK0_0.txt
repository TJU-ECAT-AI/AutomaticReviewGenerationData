[1] "The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures."
[2] "However, it is worth noting that the activating effect of CO2 observed on ceria-zirconia based catalysts disappears when ceria is used as the sole supporting material of the palladium active phase."
[3] "Indeed, the introduction of the smaller Zr4+ cation into the fluorite lattice of CeO2 strongly enhances the efficiency of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple."
[4] "On the one hand, it is well known that CeO2 promotes oxidation of Pd to PdO."
[5] "This implies that the CO2 dissociation must occur to allow some O atoms to be consumed by the Ce-Zr-O material."
[6] "Furthermore, XPS results also clearly indicate that the Ce2(CO3)3 transforms into CeO2 under reaction conditions."
[7] "DRIFTS results also indicate that carbonate species are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C, i.e., above the light-off temperature, ruling out the hypothesis of a carbonates-related CO2 inhibition of the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst."

1. CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane. Its influence depends on the type of catalyst support. Alumina-supported palladium catalysts are inhibited by CO2, whereas ceria and ceria-zirconia supported catalysts promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures.

2. The activating effect of CO2 on ceria-zirconia based catalysts disappears when ceria is used solely as the supporting material for the palladium active phase.

3. Zirconia enhances the efficiency of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple when introduced into the fluorite lattice of CeO2.

4. CeO2 promotes the oxidation of Pd to PdO under certain conditions.

5. CO2 dissociation on ceria-zirconia materials occurs to supply oxygen for the reoxidation of the material itself.

6. Ce2(CO3)3 transforms into CeO2 under reaction conditions, indicating a chemical transformation rather than the formation of stable carbonate species.

7. Carbonate species are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C, excluding a carbonates-related CO2 inhibition mechanism for the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst.

1. CO2在甲烷催化燃烧过程中并非惰性气体。其影响取决于催化剂支持物的类型。氧化铝支持的钯催化剂受到CO2抑制，而铈和铈锆复合材料支持的催化剂则促进反应，即使在温和温度下也是如此。

2. 当仅使用铈作为钯活性相的支持物时，铈锆基催化剂上的CO2激活效果消失。

3. 将锆4+离子引入铈氧化物的氟化晶格中显著增强了Ce4+/Ce3+还原偶的效率。

4. 铈氧化物在特定条件下促进Pd氧化为PdO。

5. CO2在铈锆复合材料上的分解发生在提供材料自身再氧化所需的氧原子之前。

6. Ce2(CO3)3在反应条件下转化为CeO2，表明化学转变而非稳定碳酸盐物种的形成。

7. 在反应条件超过300 8C以上（即点火温度）时，碳酸盐物种不稳定，排除了CO2对Pd/g-Al2O3催化剂的碳酸盐相关抑制机制。
