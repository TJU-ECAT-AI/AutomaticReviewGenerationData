[1] "The activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latter's effects on reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion."
[2] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOx-support interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."
[3] "DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible."
[4] "Because the majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity."
[5] "Mixed-oxide supports have improved activity relative to single oxides due to greater acid-base bifunctionality."
[6] "If the supports are only acidic, then they can only interact weakly with V2O5, such that this oxide forms poorly dispersed crystallites."
[7] "Indeed, polymeric V species led to low alkene yield, again indicating that dispersion is a key factor in controlling selectivity."
[8] "A DFT study on the plausible VOx species (monomeric, dimeric, polymeric, compared with bulk) present on the support revealed that the optimal size of V2O5 differed when SiO2 or CeO2 was chosen as the support."
[9] "Among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-oxide catalysts (M=Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si and Ce)77, In2O3/CeO2 has the lowest CO2-ODH activity77."
[10] "By contrast, In2O3/Al2O3 affords the highest yield of C3H6 and exhibits good stability because In2O3 is highly dispersed and the material has a balance between acid and base properties."
[11] "Among a series of Ga2O3 catalysts supported on TiO2, ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, SiO2 or MgO, only Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibits an enhancement in activity and selectivity for alkene production in the presence of CO2."
[12] "Bimetallic catalysts are typically supported on high-surface-area metal oxides."
[13] "Experiments were conducted at 823K, a temperature at which both CO2-ODH and the competing DR may occur."
[14] "Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR."
[15] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions."

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, excel in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. The superior performance of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is attributed to its distinct active sites where iron interacts with nickel, facilitating selective CH bond cleavage over CO bond formation. The choice of support materials, such as CeO2, enables the release and recovery of oxygen atoms, enhancing the activation of CO2. Dispersion and the balance between acid and base properties also contribute to its stability and selectivity. However, vanadium oxide catalysts benefit from the stabilization of active VOx surface structures and the participation of O atoms from the support, improving alkene selectivity. Challenges in improving vanadium oxide catalysts include controlling dispersion and reducing the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes.

Answer: The FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, outperform vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. The distinct active sites where iron interacts with nickel enable selective CH bond cleavage over CO bond formation, leading to higher C2H4 selectivity. The use of CeO2 as a support facilitates the release and recovery of oxygen atoms, enhancing the activation of CO2. Dispersion and the balance between acid and base properties contribute to the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. However, vanadium oxide catalysts benefit from the stabilization of active VOx surface structures and the participation of O atoms from the support, improving alkene selectivity. Improvements in vanadium oxide catalysts face challenges related to controlling dispersion and reducing the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes.

FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中表现出色，与钒氧化物催化剂相比，在活性、选择性和反应机制方面。Fe3Ni1/CeO2的优越性能归因于其独特的活性位点，其中铁与镍相互作用，促进选择性CH键断裂而非CO键形成。CeO2作为支持材料的选择使氧原子的释放和回收成为可能，从而增强CO2的激活。分散性和酸碱性质之间的平衡也有助于催化剂的稳定性和选择性。然而，钒氧化物催化剂得益于VOx表面结构的稳定化和来自支持物的氧原子的参与，这提高了烯烃的选择性。改善钒氧化物催化剂的挑战包括控制分散性和减少促进烯烃裂解的酸性位点的存在。
