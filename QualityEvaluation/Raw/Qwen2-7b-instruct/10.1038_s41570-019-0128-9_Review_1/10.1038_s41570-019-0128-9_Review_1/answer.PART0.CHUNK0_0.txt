[1] "The metal centres in In oxides can undergo reduction (InIII to In0) but cannot be reoxidized by CO2 under typical reaction conditions, such that these catalysts operate through a two-step CO2-ODH pathway37,38,76."
[2] "Among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-oxide catalysts (M=Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si and Ce)77, In2O3/CeO2 has the lowest CO2-ODH activity77, despite its reported utility in catalysing the RWGS reaction when synthesized as a In2O3CeO2 mixture78."
[3] "By contrast, In2O3/Al2O3 affords the highest yield of C3H6 and exhibits good stability because In2O3 is highly dispersed and the material has a balance between acid and base properties."
[4] "Moreover, as with Cr and V oxide catalysts, the support plays a crucial role by affecting the dispersion of In2O3 and acidbase properties."
[5] "Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2 (refs49,79,80)."
[6] "Unsupported Ga2O3 has a high initial C3H6 selectivity (30%) but, after 10min, the selectivity decreases to less than 10% because coke formation deactivates the material81."
[7] "Among a series of Ga2O3 catalysts supported on TiO2, ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, SiO2 or MgO, only Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibits an enhancement in activity and selectivity for alkene production in the presence of CO2, which can readily remove chemisorbed H atoms on the catalyst surface through the RWGS reaction16."
[8] "The lower activity of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 in particular was attributed to CO2 competing with the alkane for Ga binding, such that the alkane is displaced to basic catalyst sites."
[9] "The electronic and catalytic properties of a transition metal can be modified by alloying it with C or another metal. The resulting metal carbides82 or bimetallic alloys83 are often quite distinct from their parent metals, presenting an opportunity to design new catalysts with enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability84."
[10] "Bimetallic catalysts are typically supported on high-surface-area metal oxides. For example, CO2 hydrogenation85 proceeds rapidly over bimetallics supported by CeO2 because it is a reducible support that can release O atoms and then recover them86 by inducing direct C=O scission87."
[11] "The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms protects the material because any coke deposits that form can be readily removed by oxidation88,89."
[12] "Supporting catalysts on CeO2 should promote the activation of CO2, while the choice of the bimetallic should influence selectivity43,90,91."
[13] "Experiments were conducted at 823K, a temperature at which both CO2-ODH and the competing DR may occur."
[14] "In the following sections, we use the CO2-ODH of C2H6 over FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts as a case study to illustrate the importance of combining catalytic measurements with in situ characterization and DFT calculations."
[15] "Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a)."
[16] "The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics."
[17] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions."
[18] "So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni (Fig. 3d)."

1. In oxide catalysts, such as In oxides, operate through a two-step CO2-ODH pathway. In2O3/CeO2 catalysts show the lowest CO2-ODH activity among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-oxide catalysts, except when synthesized as a In2O3CeO2 mixture, where it can catalyze the RWGS reaction effectively. In2O3/Al2O3 catalysts have a high yield of C3H6 and exhibit good stability due to the high dispersion of In2O3 and a balance between acid and base properties. The support plays a crucial role in affecting the dispersion of In2O3 and acid-base properties. Ga oxide catalysts, unlike In oxides, do not operate through a redox-active mechanism. Unsupported Ga2O3 catalysts have high initial C3H6 selectivity but lose selectivity over time due to coke formation. Among supported Ga2O3 catalysts, Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibits enhanced activity and selectivity for alkene production. The lower activity of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 can be attributed to CO2 competing with the alkane for Ga binding. Metal carbides or bimetallic alloys, when alloyed with C or another metal, can lead to new catalysts with enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability. Bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2 can promote the activation of CO2 and influence selectivity. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts have the highest C2H4 selectivity and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts have the highest CO yield, indicating that the difference in activity and selectivity comes from intrinsic kinetics. The high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for the CO2-ODH can be attributed to distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni.

1. In氧化催化剂，如In氧化物，通过两步CO2-ODH途径工作。In2O3/CeO2催化剂在In2O3/MOx双金属、混合氧化物催化剂中表现出最低的CO2-ODH活性，除非它被合成为In2O3CeO2混合物，在这种情况下，它可以催化RWGS反应。In2O3/Al2O3催化剂具有高C3H6产率和良好的稳定性，因为In2O3高度分散，并且材料具有酸性和碱性之间的平衡。支持物在影响In2O3的分散和酸碱性质方面起着关键作用。与In氧化物不同，Ga氧化物催化剂不通过还原性机制工作。未支持的Ga2O3催化剂具有高初始C3H6选择性，但随着时间的推移选择性降低，由于焦炭形成而使催化剂失活。在支持的Ga2O3催化剂中，Ga2O3/TiO2显示出增强的活性和烷烃生产的选择性。Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的较低活性可以归因于CO2与烷烃竞争Ga结合，导致烷烃转移到基质位点。合金化金属C或另一种金属可以产生新的催化剂，具有增强的CO2-ODH选择性和稳定性。CeO2支持的双金属催化剂可以促进CO2的激活并影响选择性。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂具有最高的C2H4选择性，Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂具有最高的CO产率，这表明活动性和选择性的差异来自内在动力学。Fe3Ni1/CeO2的高CO2-ODH选择性可以归因于Fe与Ni相互作用的独特活性位点。
