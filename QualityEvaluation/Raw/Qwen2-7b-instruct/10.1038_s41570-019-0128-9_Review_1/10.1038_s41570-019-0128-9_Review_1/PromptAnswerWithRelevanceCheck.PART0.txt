[1] "The metal centres in In oxides can undergo reduction (InIII to In0) but cannot be reoxidized by CO2 under typical reaction conditions, such that these catalysts operate through a two-step CO2-ODH pathway37,38,76."
[2] "Among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-oxide catalysts (M=Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si and Ce)77, In2O3/CeO2 has the lowest CO2-ODH activity77, despite its reported utility in catalysing the RWGS reaction when synthesized as a In2O3CeO2 mixture78."
[3] "By contrast, In2O3/Al2O3 affords the highest yield of C3H6 and exhibits good stability because In2O3 is highly dispersed and the material has a balance between acid and base properties."
[4] "Moreover, as with Cr and V oxide catalysts, the support plays a crucial role by affecting the dispersion of In2O3 and acidbase properties."
[5] "Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2 (refs49,79,80)."
[6] "Unsupported Ga2O3 has a high initial C3H6 selectivity (30%) but, after 10min, the selectivity decreases to less than 10% because coke formation deactivates the material81."
[7] "Among a series of Ga2O3 catalysts supported on TiO2, ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, SiO2 or MgO, only Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibits an enhancement in activity and selectivity for alkene production in the presence of CO2, which can readily remove chemisorbed H atoms on the catalyst surface through the RWGS reaction16."
[8] "The lower activity of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 in particular was attributed to CO2 competing with the alkane for Ga binding, such that the alkane is displaced to basic catalyst sites."
[9] "The electronic and catalytic properties of a transition metal can be modified by alloying it with C or another metal. The resulting metal carbides82 or bimetallic alloys83 are often quite distinct from their parent metals, presenting an opportunity to design new catalysts with enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability84."
[10] "Bimetallic catalysts are typically supported on high-surface-area metal oxides. For example, CO2 hydrogenation85 proceeds rapidly over bimetallics supported by CeO2 because it is a reducible support that can release O atoms and then recover them86 by inducing direct C=O scission87."
[11] "The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms protects the material because any coke deposits that form can be readily removed by oxidation88,89."
[12] "Supporting catalysts on CeO2 should promote the activation of CO2, while the choice of the bimetallic should influence selectivity43,90,91."
[13] "Experiments were conducted at 823K, a temperature at which both CO2-ODH and the competing DR may occur."
[14] "In the following sections, we use the CO2-ODH of C2H6 over FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts as a case study to illustrate the importance of combining catalytic measurements with in situ characterization and DFT calculations."
[15] "Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a)."
[16] "The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics."
[17] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions."
[18] "So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni (Fig. 3d)."

1. In oxide catalysts, such as In oxides, operate through a two-step CO2-ODH pathway. In2O3/CeO2 catalysts show the lowest CO2-ODH activity among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-oxide catalysts, except when synthesized as a In2O3CeO2 mixture, where it can catalyze the RWGS reaction effectively. In2O3/Al2O3 catalysts have a high yield of C3H6 and exhibit good stability due to the high dispersion of In2O3 and a balance between acid and base properties. The support plays a crucial role in affecting the dispersion of In2O3 and acid-base properties. Ga oxide catalysts, unlike In oxides, do not operate through a redox-active mechanism. Unsupported Ga2O3 catalysts have high initial C3H6 selectivity but lose selectivity over time due to coke formation. Among supported Ga2O3 catalysts, Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibits enhanced activity and selectivity for alkene production. The lower activity of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 can be attributed to CO2 competing with the alkane for Ga binding. Metal carbides or bimetallic alloys, when alloyed with C or another metal, can lead to new catalysts with enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability. Bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2 can promote the activation of CO2 and influence selectivity. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts have the highest C2H4 selectivity and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts have the highest CO yield, indicating that the difference in activity and selectivity comes from intrinsic kinetics. The high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for the CO2-ODH can be attributed to distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni.

1. In氧化催化剂，如In氧化物，通过两步CO2-ODH途径工作。In2O3/CeO2催化剂在In2O3/MOx双金属、混合氧化物催化剂中表现出最低的CO2-ODH活性，除非它被合成为In2O3CeO2混合物，在这种情况下，它可以催化RWGS反应。In2O3/Al2O3催化剂具有高C3H6产率和良好的稳定性，因为In2O3高度分散，并且材料具有酸性和碱性之间的平衡。支持物在影响In2O3的分散和酸碱性质方面起着关键作用。与In氧化物不同，Ga氧化物催化剂不通过还原性机制工作。未支持的Ga2O3催化剂具有高初始C3H6选择性，但随着时间的推移选择性降低，由于焦炭形成而使催化剂失活。在支持的Ga2O3催化剂中，Ga2O3/TiO2显示出增强的活性和烷烃生产的选择性。Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的较低活性可以归因于CO2与烷烃竞争Ga结合，导致烷烃转移到基质位点。合金化金属C或另一种金属可以产生新的催化剂，具有增强的CO2-ODH选择性和稳定性。CeO2支持的双金属催化剂可以促进CO2的激活并影响选择性。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂具有最高的C2H4选择性，Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂具有最高的CO产率，这表明活动性和选择性的差异来自内在动力学。Fe3Ni1/CeO2的高CO2-ODH选择性可以归因于Fe与Ni相互作用的独特活性位点。

Answer: 

1. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, show higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The presence of CeO2 in the support enhances the dispersion and acid-base properties of the catalyst, contributing to its performance. However, the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge for vanadium oxide catalysts. Moreover, health concerns related to V2O5 dust are also addressed.

2. In comparison to vanadium oxide catalysts, FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, exhibit better stability and lower tolerance to coking. The role of support materials, such as CeO2, in influencing dispersion and acid-base properties is crucial for enhancing the catalyst's performance.

3. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, including Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni. These sites enable selective CO2-ODH reactions, leading to high C2H4 selectivity. The catalyst's activity and selectivity are influenced by factors such as the support material, composition, and structural characteristics.

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, excel in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. The superior performance of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is attributed to its distinct active sites where iron interacts with nickel, facilitating selective CH bond cleavage over CO bond formation. The choice of support materials, such as CeO2, enables the release and recovery of oxygen atoms, enhancing the activation of CO2. Dispersion and the balance between acid and base properties also contribute to its stability and selectivity. However, vanadium oxide catalysts benefit from the stabilization of active VOx surface structures and the participation of O atoms from the support, improving alkene selectivity. Challenges in improving vanadium oxide catalysts include controlling dispersion and reducing the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes.

Vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly those supported on various oxides, demonstrate improved selectivity compared to bulk V2O5 due to the stabilization of active VOx surface structures by the interaction with the support. The incorporation of ceria (CeO2) in the support enhances oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration, contributing to the overall activity of the catalysts. However, vanadium oxide catalysts face challenges related to the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes, along with health concerns concerning vanadium dust. Induction periods are observed for In2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, where the increase in activity correlates with the concentration of In0 sites, highlighting the importance of optimal surface concentrations of these active sites. In contrast, gallium oxide catalysts supported on titanium dioxide (Ga2O3/TiO2) show enhanced activity and selectivity for alkene production when exposed to CO2, due to the support's ability to facilitate alkane activation and CO2 removal through the RWGS reaction. Bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible supports like ceria (CeO2) can effectively induce CO2 activation and hydrogenation, as the support releases oxygen atoms that participate in C=O scission, protecting the material against coke formation. In the case of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 stands out for its high C2H4 selectivity, surpassing Fe1Ni3/CeO2, which yields high CO with a high selectivity, demonstrating the potential of bimetallic catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

范德华氧化物催化剂，尤其是那些支持在各种氧化物上的催化剂，相比纯V2O5具有更好的选择性，这是由于支持物与表面结构相互作用稳定活性VOx表面结构。铈（CeO2）的引入到支持中增加了氧的移动性和空位浓度，从而提高了催化剂的整体活性。然而，范德华氧化物催化剂面临酸性位点促进烯烃裂解的挑战，以及与范德华粉尘有关的健康问题。In2O3/Al2O3催化剂的诱导期观察到了活性的增加，其与In0位点的浓度成正比，强调了这些活性位点表面浓度的重要性。相比之下，镓氧化物催化剂在钛氧化物（Ga2O3/TiO2）上表现出增强的活性和选择性，当暴露于二氧化碳时，由于支持物能够通过RWGS反应促进烷基化和二氧化碳去除，从而提高了烷基化和二氧化碳去除的选择性。双金属催化剂在可还原支持如铈（CeO2）上可以有效地诱导CO2激活和氢化，因为支持物释放的氧原子参与C=O断裂，保护材料免受焦炭形成。在FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的情况下，Fe3Ni1/CeO2因其高C2H4选择性而脱颖而出，超过了以高CO选择性提供高CO选择性的Fe1Ni3/CeO2，这表明双金属催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的潜力。

1. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts show higher selectivity compared to bulk V2O5 due to the stabilization of particularly active VOx surface structures by interactions with the support. Both one-step oxidative dehydrogenation and two-step pathways involving RWGS reaction are possible with vanadium-based catalysts, depending on the conditions.

2. Indium oxide catalysts, when operated through a two-step CO2-ODH pathway, do not have the capability to reoxidize under typical conditions. The catalysts are characterized by reduction from InIII to In0, leading to a distinct two-step pathway for CO2-ODH.

3. Among the supported gallium oxide catalysts tested on various supports, Ga2O3/TiO2 stands out for enhancing activity and selectivity in alkene production when CO2 is present, due to its ability to remove chemisorbed H atoms via the RWGS reaction.

4. Bimetallic catalysts, especially when supported on high-surface-area metal oxides, offer the potential for enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability compared to their individual components.

5. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated the highest C2H4 selectivity (over 75%) and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 showed the highest CO yield with a CO selectivity exceeding 98% in CO2-ODH reactions, highlighting the distinct performance of these bimetallic catalysts.

1. 支持的五氧化二钒催化剂在选择性方面比纯五氧化二钒更高，这是由于支持物与VOx表面结构的相互作用所导致的特别稳定的活性。在基于钒的催化剂上，无论是单步氧化脱氢还是包含RWGS反应的两步路径，根据条件的不同，都有可能实现。

2. 当In氧化物在典型条件下运行时，In氧化物通过从InIII还原到In0的过程，但不能被CO2重新氧化，这导致这些催化剂通过两步CO2-ODH路径工作。In氧化物在还原条件下表现出特定的两步路径特征。

3. 在一系列测试的Gallium氧化物催化剂中，仅Ga2O3/TiO2展现出在存在CO2时，对烷烃生产的活性和选择性增强的能力，这是由于其能够通过RWGS反应去除催化剂表面的吸附氢原子。

4. 由两种金属组成的双金属催化剂，特别是当它们被高表面积金属氧化物支持时，提供了相比于单一成分增强CO2-ODH选择性和稳定性的可能性。

5. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在C2H4选择性（超过75%）方面表现出最高水平，而Fe1Ni3/CeO2则在CO产量上表现出最高值（CO选择性超过98%），这表明这些双金属催化剂具有独特的性能。
