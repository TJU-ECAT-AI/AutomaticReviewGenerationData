[1] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."
[2] "The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4."
[3] "Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."
[4] "In a separate study, fresh and unreduced In2O3/Al2O3 undergoes induction over 3h, during which it increases in activity as the concentration of In0 sites increases."
[5] "Among a series of Ga2O3 catalysts supported on TiO2, ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, SiO2 or MgO, only Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibits an enhancement in activity and selectivity for alkene production in the presence of CO2."
[6] "Bimetallic catalysts are typically supported on high-surface-area metal oxides. For example, CO2 hydrogenation proceeds rapidly over bimetallics supported by CeO2 because it is a reducible support that can release O atoms and then recover them by inducing direct C=O scission."
[7] "Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a)."

Vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly those supported on various oxides, demonstrate improved selectivity compared to bulk V2O5 due to the stabilization of active VOx surface structures by the interaction with the support. The incorporation of ceria (CeO2) in the support enhances oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration, contributing to the overall activity of the catalysts. However, vanadium oxide catalysts face challenges related to the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes, along with health concerns concerning vanadium dust. Induction periods are observed for In2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, where the increase in activity correlates with the concentration of In0 sites, highlighting the importance of optimal surface concentrations of these active sites. In contrast, gallium oxide catalysts supported on titanium dioxide (Ga2O3/TiO2) show enhanced activity and selectivity for alkene production when exposed to CO2, due to the support's ability to facilitate alkane activation and CO2 removal through the RWGS reaction. Bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible supports like ceria (CeO2) can effectively induce CO2 activation and hydrogenation, as the support releases oxygen atoms that participate in C=O scission, protecting the material against coke formation. In the case of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 stands out for its high C2H4 selectivity, surpassing Fe1Ni3/CeO2, which yields high CO with a high selectivity, demonstrating the potential of bimetallic catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

范德华氧化物催化剂，尤其是那些支持在各种氧化物上的催化剂，相比纯V2O5具有更好的选择性，这是由于支持物与表面结构相互作用稳定活性VOx表面结构。铈（CeO2）的引入到支持中增加了氧的移动性和空位浓度，从而提高了催化剂的整体活性。然而，范德华氧化物催化剂面临酸性位点促进烯烃裂解的挑战，以及与范德华粉尘有关的健康问题。In2O3/Al2O3催化剂的诱导期观察到了活性的增加，其与In0位点的浓度成正比，强调了这些活性位点表面浓度的重要性。相比之下，镓氧化物催化剂在钛氧化物（Ga2O3/TiO2）上表现出增强的活性和选择性，当暴露于二氧化碳时，由于支持物能够通过RWGS反应促进烷基化和二氧化碳去除，从而提高了烷基化和二氧化碳去除的选择性。双金属催化剂在可还原支持如铈（CeO2）上可以有效地诱导CO2激活和氢化，因为支持物释放的氧原子参与C=O断裂，保护材料免受焦炭形成。在FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的情况下，Fe3Ni1/CeO2因其高C2H4选择性而脱颖而出，超过了以高CO选择性提供高CO选择性的Fe1Ni3/CeO2，这表明双金属催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的潜力。
