[1] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."
[2] "The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4."
[3] "Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."
[4] "Among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-oxide catalysts (M=Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si and Ce)77, In2O3/CeO2 has the lowest CO2-ODH activity77, despite its reported utility in catalysing the RWGS reaction when synthesized as a In2O3CeO2 mixture78."
[5] "By contrast, In2O3/Al2O3 affords the highest yield of C3H6 and exhibits good stability because In2O3 is highly dispersed and the material has a balance between acid and base properties."
[6] "Moreover, as with Cr and V oxide catalysts, the support plays a crucial role by affecting the dispersion of In2O3 and acidbase properties."
[7] "Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2 (refs49,79,80)."
[8] "Unsupported Ga2O3 has a high initial C3H6 selectivity (30%) but, after 10min, the selectivity decreases to less than 10% because coke formation deactivates the material81."
[9] "Among a series of Ga2O3 catalysts supported on TiO2, ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, SiO2 or MgO, only Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibits an enhancement in activity and selectivity for alkene production in the presence of CO2, which can readily remove chemisorbed H atoms on the catalyst surface through the RWGS reaction16."
[10] "The electronic and catalytic properties of a transition metal can be modified by alloying it with C or another metal. The resulting metal carbides82 or bimetallic alloys83 are often quite distinct from their parent metals, presenting an opportunity to design new catalysts with enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability84."
[11] "Bimetallic catalysts are typically supported on high-surface-area metal oxides. For example, CO2 hydrogenation85 proceeds rapidly over bimetallics supported by CeO2 because it is a reducible support that can release O atoms and then recover them86 by inducing direct C=O scission87."
[12] "Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a)."

Answer: 

1. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, show higher activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. The presence of CeO2 in the support enhances the dispersion and acid-base properties of the catalyst, contributing to its performance. However, the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge for vanadium oxide catalysts. Moreover, health concerns related to V2O5 dust are also addressed.

2. In comparison to vanadium oxide catalysts, FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, exhibit better stability and lower tolerance to coking. The role of support materials, such as CeO2, in influencing dispersion and acid-base properties is crucial for enhancing the catalyst's performance.

3. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, including Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni. These sites enable selective CO2-ODH reactions, leading to high C2H4 selectivity. The catalyst's activity and selectivity are influenced by factors such as the support material, composition, and structural characteristics.

Answer: 

1.FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，尤其是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中的活性和选择性高于钒氧化物催化剂。CeO2支持的存在增强了催化剂的分散性和酸碱性质，从而提高了其性能。然而，促进烯烃裂解的酸性位点仍然是钒氧化物催化剂面临的挑战。此外，V2O5粉尘相关的健康问题也得到了关注。

2.与钒氧化物催化剂相比，FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，表现出更好的稳定性和较低的焦化耐受性。支持材料，如CeO2的作用对于影响分散性和酸碱性质至关重要，从而增强催化剂的性能。

3.FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，包括Fe3Ni1/CeO2，显示了独特的活性位点，其中Fe与Ni相互作用。这些位点使选择性的CO2-ODH反应成为可能，导致高C2H4选择性。催化剂的活性和选择性受到诸如支持材料、组成和结构特性等因素的影响。
