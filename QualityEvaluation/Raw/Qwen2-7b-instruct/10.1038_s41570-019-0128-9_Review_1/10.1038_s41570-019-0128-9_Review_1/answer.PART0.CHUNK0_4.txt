[1] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."
[2] "DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible."
[3] "The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4."
[4] "Indeed, polymeric V species led to low alkene yield, again indicating that dispersion is a key factor in controlling selectivity."
[5] "This catalytic performance was maintained only for eight reaction-regeneration cycles (64h on stream)."
[6] "In and Ga oxides The metal centres in In oxides can undergo reduction (InIII to In0) but cannot be reoxidized by CO2 under typical reaction conditions, such that these catalysts operate through a two-step CO2-ODH pathway."
[7] "Among a series of Ga2O3 catalysts supported on TiO2, ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, SiO2 or MgO, only Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibits an enhancement in activity and selectivity for alkene production in the presence of CO2."

1. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts show higher selectivity compared to bulk V2O5 due to the stabilization of particularly active VOx surface structures by interactions with the support. Both one-step oxidative dehydrogenation and two-step pathways involving RWGS reaction are possible with vanadium-based catalysts, depending on the conditions.

2. Indium oxide catalysts, when operated through a two-step CO2-ODH pathway, do not have the capability to reoxidize under typical conditions. The catalysts are characterized by reduction from InIII to In0, leading to a distinct two-step pathway for CO2-ODH.

3. Among the supported gallium oxide catalysts tested on various supports, Ga2O3/TiO2 stands out for enhancing activity and selectivity in alkene production when CO2 is present, due to its ability to remove chemisorbed H atoms via the RWGS reaction.

4. Bimetallic catalysts, especially when supported on high-surface-area metal oxides, offer the potential for enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability compared to their individual components.

5. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated the highest C2H4 selectivity (over 75%) and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 showed the highest CO yield with a CO selectivity exceeding 98% in CO2-ODH reactions, highlighting the distinct performance of these bimetallic catalysts.

1. 支持的五氧化二钒催化剂在选择性方面比纯五氧化二钒更高，这是由于支持物与VOx表面结构的相互作用所导致的特别稳定的活性。在基于钒的催化剂上，无论是单步氧化脱氢还是包含RWGS反应的两步路径，根据条件的不同，都有可能实现。

2. 当In氧化物在典型条件下运行时，In氧化物通过从InIII还原到In0的过程，但不能被CO2重新氧化，这导致这些催化剂通过两步CO2-ODH路径工作。In氧化物在还原条件下表现出特定的两步路径特征。

3. 在一系列测试的Gallium氧化物催化剂中，仅Ga2O3/TiO2展现出在存在CO2时，对烷烃生产的活性和选择性增强的能力，这是由于其能够通过RWGS反应去除催化剂表面的吸附氢原子。

4. 由两种金属组成的双金属催化剂，特别是当它们被高表面积金属氧化物支持时，提供了相比于单一成分增强CO2-ODH选择性和稳定性的可能性。

5. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在C2H4选择性（超过75%）方面表现出最高水平，而Fe1Ni3/CeO2则在CO产量上表现出最高值（CO选择性超过98%），这表明这些双金属催化剂具有独特的性能。
