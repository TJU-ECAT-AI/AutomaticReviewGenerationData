<p>Redispersion of sintered Pt (0.61.0%)/Al2O3 catalysts at 773 K under HCl/H2O/O2/N2 atmospheres was studied by hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) experiments.</p>
<p>Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and H2 chemisorption results showed that the concentration of hydroxychlorided Pt species on the alumina carrier and, as a consequence, the metallic dispersion constantly augmented during the 8 h redispersion treatment.</p>
<p>In situ EXAFS experiments indicated that Pt(OH)4Cl22- species, which are formed by the attack of gaseous/surface chlorided species to partially oxidized metallic Pt particles, are responsible for Pt redispersion.</p>
<p>EXAFS studies also suggested that once the PtCl/PtO coordination number ratio was stable, the Pt atoms were present on the alumina carrier either in the form of small rafts containing Cl and O atoms in a slighly distorted octahedral environment or in relatively large metallic particles covered by Pt(OH)4Cl22- species.</p>

This study focused on the redispersion of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, specifically looking at the role of hydroxychlorided Pt species in the redispersion process. The researchers used a variety of techniques including hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) to analyze the catalysts. They found that the hydroxychlorided Pt species played a crucial role in redispersion, and that once the PtCl/PtO coordination number ratio was stable, the Pt atoms were present in either small rafts or large metallic particles covered by Pt(OH)4Cl22- species.

本研究专注于铂/氧化铝催化剂的再分散，特别关注羟基氯化铂物种在再分散过程中的作用。研究人员使用了多种技术，包括氢吸附、温度程序还原（TPR）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和原位X射线吸收光谱（EXAFS），来分析催化剂。他们发现羟基氯化铂物种在再分散过程中起着关键作用，并且一旦PtCl/PtO配位数比稳定下来，铂原子就以包含Cl和O原子的稍微扭曲的八面体环境的小筏或覆盖有Pt(OH)4Cl22-物种的大金属颗粒形式存在于氧化铝载体上。
