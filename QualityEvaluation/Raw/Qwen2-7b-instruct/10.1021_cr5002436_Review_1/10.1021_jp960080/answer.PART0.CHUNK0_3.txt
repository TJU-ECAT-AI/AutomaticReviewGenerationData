[1] "Redispersion of sintered Pt/Al2O3 catalysts under HCl/H2O/O2/N2 atmospheres was studied by TEM, TPR, and EXAFS."
[2] "The aim was twofold: (i) to establish the chemical nature of the surface species responsible for redispersion, and (ii) to study the effect the redispersing atmosphere composition has on the redispersion kinetics."
</quotes>

Answer: The study focused on understanding the redispersion of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts under specific atmospheres. It aimed to identify the chemical nature of species responsible for redispersion and examine how the atmosphere composition affects this process.
