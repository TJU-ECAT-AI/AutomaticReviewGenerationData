[1] "Bifunctional Pt/Al2O3Cl naphtha reforming catalysts are deactivated by side reactions such as coking, sintering, and poisoning in the course of industrial operation."
[2] "Redispersion of sintered Pt/Al2O3 catalysts at 773 K under HCl/H2O/O2/N2 atmospheres was studied by hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) experiments."
[3] "In situ EXAFS experiments indicated that Pt(OH)4Cl22- species, which are formed by the attack of gaseous/surface chlorided species to partially oxidized metallic Pt particles, are responsible for Pt redispersion."
[4] "EXAFS studies also suggested that once the PtCl/PtO coordination number ratio was stable, the Pt atoms were present on the alumina carrier either in the form of small rafts containing Cl and O atoms in a slighly distorted octahedral environment or in relatively large metallic particles covered by Pt(OH)4Cl22- species."
[5] "Redispersion occurs in two steps. In the first step, the alumina support is covered by Cl- and OH- groups following the addition of the hydroxychlorinating mixture. The surface of the metallic fraction is oxidized forming a double coating of disordered PtO2. This first step is actually an induction period characterized by the absence of chlorine coordination around platinum."
[6] "In the second step the PtO2 coating of sintered metallic Pt particles is attacked by the gaseous and surface chlorided species forming n[PtO(2-2/n)(OH)4/nCl2]2n- rafts in equilibrium with [Pt(OH)4Cl2]2- species which cause the redispersion of the Pt particles by migration through the hydroxylated/chlorided alumina surface."

1. The study focused on bifunctional Pt/Al2O3Cl catalysts, which are used in naphtha reforming. These catalysts are prone to deactivation due to side reactions like coking, sintering, and poisoning during industrial operation.
2. The redispersion of sintered Pt/Al2O3 catalysts was investigated under specific atmospheres using various analytical methods. This process helps restore the catalyst's activity.
3. Pt(OH)4Cl22- species play a crucial role in the redispersion of Pt particles. They form when chlorided species attack partially oxidized metallic Pt particles.
4. Once the PtCl/PtO coordination number stabilizes, the Pt atoms are present on the alumina carrier in either small rafts containing Cl and O atoms in a slightly distorted octahedral environment or in large metallic particles covered by Pt(OH)4Cl22- species.
5. The redispersion process can be divided into two steps. The first step involves the alumina support being coated with Cl- and OH- groups, which oxidizes the metallic fraction and forms a double layer of disordered PtO2.
6. In the second step, the PtO2 layer on the Pt particles is attacked by gaseous and surface chlorided species, forming rafts that migrate through the hydroxylated/chlorided alumina surface, causing the redispersion of the Pt particles.

1. Pt/Al2O3Cl双功能催化剂在重整轻烯烃过程中容易因焦炭、结块和中毒等副反应而失效。
2. 对于烧结的Pt/Al2O3催化剂，在特定气氛下进行了研究，使用了多种分析方法。这一过程有助于恢复催化剂的活性。
3. Pt(OH)4Cl22-物种在铂粒子重新分散中起关键作用。当氯化物物种攻击部分氧化的金属铂颗粒时，它们形成。
4. 当PtCl/PtO配位数稳定后，铂原子在氧化铝载体上以两种形式存在：一种是包含Cl和O原子的轻微扭曲八面体环境中的小筏，另一种是在Pt(OH)4Cl22-物种覆盖下的较大金属颗粒。
5. 重新分散过程可以分为两个步骤。第一步涉及氧化铝支持层被Cl-和OH-组分覆盖，这氧化了金属部分并形成了混乱的PtO2双层。
6. 第二步中，PtO2层上的铂颗粒被气体和表面氯化物种攻击，形成通过水合/氯化氧化铝表面迁移的筏，导致铂颗粒重新分散。
