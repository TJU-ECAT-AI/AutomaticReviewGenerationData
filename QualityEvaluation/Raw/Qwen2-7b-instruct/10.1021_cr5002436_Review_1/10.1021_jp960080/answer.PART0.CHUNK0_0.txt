[1] "Redispersion of sintered Pt/Al2O3 catalysts under HCl/H2O/O2/N2 atmospheres was studied by TEM, TPR, and EXAFS."
[2] "In the second step the PtO2 coating of sintered metallic Pt particles is attacked by the gaseous and surface chlorided species forming n[PtO(2-2/n)(OH)4/nCl2]2n- rafts in equilibrium with [Pt(OH)4Cl2]2- species which cause the redispersion of the Pt particles by migration through the hydroxylated/chlorided alumina surface."
[3] "The EXAFS analysis of the evolution of Pt coordination suggests that at the end of the redispersion process the Pt atoms are present on the carrier in two different environments."
[4] "A part of the Pt atoms would form small rafts containing Cl and O atoms in an octahedral environment. The other part is considered to form Pt particles consisting of a metallic core surrounded by a coating of [Pt(OH)4Cl2]2- species."
[5] "Redispersion occurs in two steps. In the first step, the alumina support is covered by Cl- and OH- groups following the addition of the hydroxychlorinating mixture. The surface of the metallic fraction is oxidized forming a double coating of disordered PtO2. This first step is actually an induction period characterized by the absence of chlorine coordination around platinum."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (especially Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, this study focuses on the redispersion of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts under specific atmospheres. The process involves two steps: an induction period where the alumina support is covered by Cl- and OH- groups, and a redispersion phase where the PtO2 coating is attacked by gaseous and surface chlorided species, forming rafts and species like [Pt(OH)4Cl2]2- which cause the Pt particles' migration through the hydroxylated/chlorided alumina surface. The Pt atoms are found in two environments at the end of the redispersion process: some form rafts with Cl and O atoms in an octahedral arrangement, while others are part of Pt particles with a metallic core surrounded by a [Pt(OH)4Cl2]2- coating.

Advantages of Platinum-based catalysts might include superior activity and selectivity in certain reactions, while metal oxide catalysts could offer better stability and resistance to poisoning. Recent developments likely focus on enhancing catalyst performance, durability, and efficiency through new synthesis methods, surface modification, and improved understanding of catalytic mechanisms.

Industrial applications of these catalysts span multiple sectors including petrochemical processing, biofuels production, and environmental remediation, where their ability to efficiently convert light olefins can lead to cost savings and environmental benefits.

However, the document does not provide a comprehensive comparison between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation. It primarily discusses the redispersion process of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, which is a specific aspect of catalyst behavior under certain conditions.

比较贵金属催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，本文主要研究了在特定气氛下sintered Pt/Al2O3催化剂的再分散过程。这一过程分为两个步骤：首先，在添加羟基氯化混合物后，氧化铝支持物被Cl-和OH-基团覆盖，形成双层无序的PtO2涂层；其次，在第二步中，sintered Pt颗粒表面的PtO2涂层受到气体和表面氯化物种的攻击，形成n[PtO(2-2/n)(OH)4/nCl2]2n-岛以及与[Pt(OH)4Cl2]2-物种的平衡，导致铂颗粒通过穿过水合/氯化氧化铝表面的迁移实现再分散。在再分散过程结束时，铂原子在载体上存在两种不同的环境：一部分形成包含Cl和O原子的八面体环境的微小岛；另一部分则形成由一个金属核心和一层[Pt(OH)4Cl2]2-涂层包围的铂颗粒。

铂基催化剂的优势可能包括在某些反应中表现出更优越的活性和选择性，而金属氧化物催化剂则可能提供更好的稳定性并具有抗毒性强的特点。最近的发展可能集中在通过新合成方法、表面改性和对催化机制的深入理解来提高催化剂性能、耐用性和效率。

工业应用领域广泛，涵盖石油化学加工、生物燃料生产及环境修复等多个行业，其中催化剂能够高效地将轻烯烃转化为目标产物，从而带来成本节省和环境效益。

然而，文档并未提供贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂在非氧化脱氢方面的全面比较。它主要讨论了在特定条件下Pt/Al2O3催化剂的再分散过程，这是催化剂行为的一个具体方面。
