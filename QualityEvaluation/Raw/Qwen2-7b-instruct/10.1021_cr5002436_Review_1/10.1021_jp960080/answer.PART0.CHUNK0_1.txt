[1] "Redispersion of sintered Pt/Al2O3 catalysts at 773 K under HCl/H2O/O2/N2 atmospheres was studied by TEM, TPR, and EXAFS."
[2] "Conclusions can be summarized as follows:"
[3] "Redispersion occurs in two steps. In the first step, the alumina support is covered by Cl- and OH- groups following the addition of the hydroxychlorinating mixture. The surface of the metallic fraction is oxidized forming a double coating of disordered PtO2. This first step is actually an induction period characterized by the absence of chlorine coordination around platinum."
[4] "In the second step the PtO2 coating of sintered metallic Pt particles is attacked by the gaseous and surface chlorided species forming n[PtO(2-2/n)(OH)4/nCl2]2n- rafts in equilibrium with [Pt(OH)4Cl2]2- species which cause the redispersion of the Pt particles by migration through the hydroxylated/chlorided alumina surface."
[5] "The EXAFS analysis of the evolution of Pt coordination suggests that at the end of the redispersion process the Pt atoms are present on the carrier in two different environments. A part of the Pt atoms would form small rafts containing Cl and O atoms in an octahedral environment. The other part is considered to form Pt particles consisting of a metallic core surrounded by a coating of [Pt(OH)4Cl2]2- species."

The study focused on the redispersion of sintered Pt/Al2O3 catalysts under specific atmospheres using TEM, TPR, and EXAFS techniques. Redispersion occurs in two stages: first, the alumina support gets coated with Cl- and OH- ions, oxidizing the surface of the metal fraction into a disordered PtO2 layer. The second step involves attacking the PtO2 layer with gaseous and surface chlorided species, forming rafts of [PtO(2-2/n)(OH)4/nCl2]2n- and [Pt(OH)4Cl2]2- complexes, causing the Pt particles to migrate and redispersion. The EXAFS analysis revealed that at the end of the process, Pt atoms exist in two states: as small rafts with Cl and O atoms in an octahedral environment or as particles with a metallic core surrounded by a [Pt(OH)4Cl2]2- coating.

研究集中在使用TEM、TPR和EXAFS技术对773 K下HCl/H2O/O2/N2气氛下的烧结Pt/Al2O3催化剂进行再分散。再分散过程分为两个阶段：首先，氧化铝基质表面被Cl-和OH-离子覆盖，金属部分氧化形成无序的PtO2层。第二阶段涉及用气态和表面氯化物攻击PtO2层，形成[PtO(2-2/n)(OH)4/nCl2]2n-和[Pt(OH)4Cl2]2-复合物，导致铂颗粒迁移和再分散。EXAFS分析表明，在再分散结束时，铂原子存在两种状态：一种是含有Cl和O原子的八面体环境的小筏；另一种是具有一个金属核心并被[Pt(OH)4Cl2]2-涂层包围的颗粒。
