The noble metal-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins typically consist of precious metals like Platinum (Pt), often supported on metal oxides or other supports. These catalysts are effective in converting paraffins into olefins under certain conditions, but they can suffer from quick deactivation and poor selectivity due to cracking and isomerization reactions. The addition of tin (Sn) to Pt-based catalysts notably improves stability and selectivity, inhibiting cracking and isomerization reactions, and reducing coke formation. The presence of tin in PtSn catalysts leads to an electronic effect, facilitating electron transfer from tin to platinum, which is crucial for the enhanced stability of the catalysts. The local structure around platinum atoms, as analyzed by EXAFS, indicates the presence of a PtSn alloy, which dilutes metallic platinum atoms. This PtSn alloy is not active in the dehydrogenation reaction but serves to inhibit cracking and coke formation, acting as a cleaning agent for the active phase. The stability of PtSn catalysts facing multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, along with the close interaction between tin and platinum, makes them highly suitable for industrial applications requiring catalyst regeneration and long-term performance.

非氧化脱氢轻烯烃时使用的贵金属催化剂通常由铂（Pt）等贵重金属组成，常被负载在金属氧化物或其他载体上。这些催化剂在特定条件下能将烷烃转化为烯烃，但容易因裂解和异构化反应而快速失效，选择性差。向铂基催化剂中添加锡（Sn）能显著提高稳定性与选择性，抑制裂解和异构化反应，减少结焦形成过程。锡的存在使得铂锡催化剂具有电子效应，实现从锡到铂的电子转移，这对于催化剂的增强稳定性至关重要。通过EXAFS分析铂周围的局部结构表明，存在铂锡合金，稀释了铂原子。这种铂锡合金在脱氢反应中不活跃，而是作为清洁剂作用于活性位点，抑制裂解和结焦形成。铂锡催化剂能够面对多个反应再生循环保持稳定的活性水平，同时锡与铂之间的紧密相互作用使得它们非常适合需要催化剂再生和长期性能的应用场景。
