XPS results show that tin is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV), being the percentage of Sn(0) lower for alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts.
Tin modified platinum catalysts, always show a decrease of approximately 1 eV in the BE of Pt, what would be indicative of an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum.
When the concentration of Sn(0) is high enough, in our case Sn(0)/Pt  0.3, EXAFS experiments demonstrated the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms, for both PtSn/g-Al2O3 and PtSn/SiO2.
The ensemble of our catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reaction-regeneration cycles, recovering the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, the former typically offer higher catalytic activity and selectivity due to their unique electronic properties. Platinum catalysts are often used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins because of their excellent hydrogenation ability. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, are cheaper and more stable, making them suitable for industrial applications where cost-effectiveness is crucial. Recent developments include the creation of supported catalysts, where noble metals are loaded onto metal oxides to improve their stability and activity. These combined catalysts can potentially overcome the limitations of individual components, offering enhanced performance in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Advantages of these catalysts include improved efficiency, longer lifetime, and better selectivity towards desired products.
