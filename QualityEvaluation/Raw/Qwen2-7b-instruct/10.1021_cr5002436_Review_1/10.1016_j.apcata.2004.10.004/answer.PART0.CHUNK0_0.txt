[1] "In this work, well defined alumina and silica supported Pt and PtSn catalysts were prepared by surface organometallic reactions and were characterized by TEM, XPS and EXAFS."
[2] "XPS results show that tin is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV), being the percentage of Sn(0) lower for alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts."
[3] "Tin modified platinum catalysts, always show a decrease of approximately 1 eV in the BE of Pt, what would be indicative of an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum."
[4] "When the concentration of Sn(0) is high enough, in our case Sn(0)/Pt ≥ 0.3, EXAFS experiments demonstrated the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms, for both PtSn/g-Al2O3 and PtSn/SiO2."
[5] "The ensemble of our catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reaction-regeneration cycles, recovering the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications."

The document discusses the preparation and characterization of supported platinum and platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts through surface organometallic reactions. These catalysts are then evaluated for their effectiveness in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction. The catalysts are characterized using techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The presence of tin in the PtSn catalysts is confirmed through XPS, indicating that tin exists in various oxidation states. The electronic state of platinum is altered by the presence of tin, showing a decrease in the binding energy of approximately 1 electron volt (eV), suggesting an electron transfer from tin to platinum. High concentrations of tin (Sn(0)) lead to the formation of a PtSn alloy that dilutes the metallic platinum, which is thought to inhibit cracking and coke formation reactions. The PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts prepared via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC/M) techniques exhibit excellent regenerability, retaining their initial activity after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles without significant changes to the catalytic surface.

本文讨论了通过表面有机金属反应制备并表征了氧化铝和二氧化硅支持的铂和铂锡(PtSn)催化剂。这些催化剂随后用于异丁烷脱氢反应的评估。通过透射电子显微镜(TEM)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)技术对催化剂进行表征。XPS结果证实了锡的存在，显示锡以不同氧化态存在。铂的电子状态由于锡的存在而改变，铂的结合能大约下降了1个电子伏特(eV)，这表明锡向铂转移了电子。高浓度的锡(Sn(0))导致形成一个稀释金属铂的PtSn合金，这被认为抑制了裂解和焦油形成反应。通过表面有机金属化学(SOMC/M)技术制备的PtSn/g-Al2O3催化剂显示出极好的再生能力，在多次反应再生循环后仍能保持初始活性，且催化表面基本没有变化。
