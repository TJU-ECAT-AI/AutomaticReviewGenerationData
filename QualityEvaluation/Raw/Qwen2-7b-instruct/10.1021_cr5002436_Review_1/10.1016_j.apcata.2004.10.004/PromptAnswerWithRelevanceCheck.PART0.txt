[1] "In this work, well defined alumina and silica supported Pt and PtSn catalysts were prepared by surface organometallic reactions and were characterized by TEM, XPS and EXAFS."
[2] "XPS results show that tin is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV), being the percentage of Sn(0) lower for alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts."
[3] "Tin modified platinum catalysts, always show a decrease of approximately 1 eV in the BE of Pt, what would be indicative of an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum."
[4] "When the concentration of Sn(0) is high enough, in our case Sn(0)/Pt ≥ 0.3, EXAFS experiments demonstrated the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms, for both PtSn/g-Al2O3 and PtSn/SiO2."
[5] "The ensemble of our catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reaction-regeneration cycles, recovering the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications."

The document discusses the preparation and characterization of supported platinum and platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts through surface organometallic reactions. These catalysts are then evaluated for their effectiveness in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction. The catalysts are characterized using techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The presence of tin in the PtSn catalysts is confirmed through XPS, indicating that tin exists in various oxidation states. The electronic state of platinum is altered by the presence of tin, showing a decrease in the binding energy of approximately 1 electron volt (eV), suggesting an electron transfer from tin to platinum. High concentrations of tin (Sn(0)) lead to the formation of a PtSn alloy that dilutes the metallic platinum, which is thought to inhibit cracking and coke formation reactions. The PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts prepared via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC/M) techniques exhibit excellent regenerability, retaining their initial activity after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles without significant changes to the catalytic surface.

本文讨论了通过表面有机金属反应制备并表征了氧化铝和二氧化硅支持的铂和铂锡(PtSn)催化剂。这些催化剂随后用于异丁烷脱氢反应的评估。通过透射电子显微镜(TEM)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)技术对催化剂进行表征。XPS结果证实了锡的存在，显示锡以不同氧化态存在。铂的电子状态由于锡的存在而改变，铂的结合能大约下降了1个电子伏特(eV)，这表明锡向铂转移了电子。高浓度的锡(Sn(0))导致形成一个稀释金属铂的PtSn合金，这被认为抑制了裂解和焦油形成反应。通过表面有机金属化学(SOMC/M)技术制备的PtSn/g-Al2O3催化剂显示出极好的再生能力，在多次反应再生循环后仍能保持初始活性，且催化表面基本没有变化。

The literature discusses the preparation, characterization, and catalytic properties of PtSn catalysts. These catalysts are prepared using surface organometallic reactions and characterized by techniques such as TEM, XPS, and EXAFS. The tin in these catalysts is found in forms of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV), with a notable electron charge transfer from tin to platinum. At high concentrations, PtSn alloys are formed that dilute metallic Pt atoms. The PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts prepared via SOMC/M techniques are shown to be stable and recoverable through multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, maintaining their initial activity and surface nature.

[4] "This fact would be indicative of the existence of an electronic effect, suggesting that there is an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum."
[5] "The presence of the PtSn coordination shell is an evidence of the existence of a PtSn alloy in the catalysts."
[6] "Taking into account the image of the surface represented in Scheme 1, where small Pt clusters coexist with PtSn alloy, and the catalytic results obtained, it seems reasonable to accept that the PtSn alloy is not active in the dehydrogenation reaction, or at least its activity level is notably lower than that of Pt clusters."

The noble metal-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins typically consist of precious metals like Platinum (Pt), often supported on metal oxides or other supports. These catalysts are effective in converting paraffins into olefins under certain conditions, but they can suffer from quick deactivation and poor selectivity due to cracking and isomerization reactions. The addition of tin (Sn) to Pt-based catalysts notably improves stability and selectivity, inhibiting cracking and isomerization reactions, and reducing coke formation. The presence of tin in PtSn catalysts leads to an electronic effect, facilitating electron transfer from tin to platinum, which is crucial for the enhanced stability of the catalysts. The local structure around platinum atoms, as analyzed by EXAFS, indicates the presence of a PtSn alloy, which dilutes metallic platinum atoms. This PtSn alloy is not active in the dehydrogenation reaction but serves to inhibit cracking and coke formation, acting as a cleaning agent for the active phase. The stability of PtSn catalysts facing multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, along with the close interaction between tin and platinum, makes them highly suitable for industrial applications requiring catalyst regeneration and long-term performance.

非氧化脱氢轻烯烃时使用的贵金属催化剂通常由铂（Pt）等贵重金属组成，常被负载在金属氧化物或其他载体上。这些催化剂在特定条件下能将烷烃转化为烯烃，但容易因裂解和异构化反应而快速失效，选择性差。向铂基催化剂中添加锡（Sn）能显著提高稳定性与选择性，抑制裂解和异构化反应，减少结焦形成过程。锡的存在使得铂锡催化剂具有电子效应，实现从锡到铂的电子转移，这对于催化剂的增强稳定性至关重要。通过EXAFS分析铂周围的局部结构表明，存在铂锡合金，稀释了铂原子。这种铂锡合金在脱氢反应中不活跃，而是作为清洁剂作用于活性位点，抑制裂解和结焦形成。铂锡催化剂能够面对多个反应再生循环保持稳定的活性水平，同时锡与铂之间的紧密相互作用使得它们非常适合需要催化剂再生和长期性能的应用场景。

[1] "The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: XPS results show that in supported PtSn catalysts, tin is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV). The contribution of Sn(0) with respect to SnTOTAL is lower for alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts. In all tin modified platinum catalysts, our results show a downwards shift of approximately 1 eV in the BE of Pt."
[2] "This fact would be indicative of the existence of an electronic effect, suggesting that there is an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum."
[3] "EXAFS experiments in PtSn supported samples allow to demonstrate the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms for the higher Sn(0)/Pt ratios, in our case approximately 0.3. This PtSn alloy seems to be not active in the dehydrogenation reaction, and would have the mission of inhibiting cracking and coke formation reactions and of cleaning the active phase."
[4] "Catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results performed in this work, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts,prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reactionregeneration cycles, recover- ing the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications."

1. The tin in supported PtSn catalysts exists as Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV). The Sn(0) content is lower for alumina-supported catalysts compared to silica-supported ones. The Pt in tin-modified platinum catalysts experiences a 1 eV downshift in binding energy, suggesting an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum.

2. This downshift in Pt's binding energy indicates an electronic effect from tin, facilitating electron transfer to platinum.

3. At high Sn(0)/Pt ratios, a PtSn alloy dilutes metallic Pt atoms in the catalyst. This alloy is inactive in dehydrogenation reactions but helps inhibit cracking and coke formation, cleaning the active phase.

4. Bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts prepared via SOMC/M techniques can undergo multiple regeneration cycles, retaining initial activity and maintaining the catalytic surface's integrity.

1. 支持型PtSn催化剂中的锡以Sn(0)和Sn(II,IV)形式存在。对于氧化铝支持的催化剂，Sn(0)的含量较低，而对硅胶支持的催化剂则较高。在锡修饰的铂催化剂中，铂的结合能下降约1电子伏特，这表明存在从锡到铂的电子转移。

2. 这一铂结合能的下降表明了锡的电子效应，促进了电子向铂的转移。

3. 在较高的Sn(0)/Pt比下，一个PtSn合金稀释了铂原子。这种合金在脱氢反应中不活跃，但有助于抑制裂解和焦炭形成，清洁活性相。

4. 使用SOMC/M技术制备的双金属PtSn/g-Al2O3催化剂可以经历多次再生周期，保持初始活性，并维持催化表面的完整性。

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, the former typically offer higher catalytic activity and selectivity due to their unique electronic properties. Platinum catalysts are often used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins because of their excellent hydrogenation ability. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, are cheaper and more stable, making them suitable for industrial applications where cost-effectiveness is crucial. Recent developments include the creation of supported catalysts, where noble metals are loaded onto metal oxides to improve their stability and activity. These combined catalysts can potentially overcome the limitations of individual components, offering enhanced performance in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Advantages of these catalysts include improved efficiency, longer lifetime, and better selectivity towards desired products.
