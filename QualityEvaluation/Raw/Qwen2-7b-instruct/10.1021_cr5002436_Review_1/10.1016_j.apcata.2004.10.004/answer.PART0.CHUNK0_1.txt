[1] "Well defined supported PtSn catalysts were prepared by surface organometallic reactions and were characterized by TEM, XPS and EXAFS."
[2] "Tin modified platinum catalysts, always show a decrease of approximately 1 eVin the BE of Pt, what would be indicative of an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum."
[3] "When the concentration of Sn(0) is high enough, in our case Sn(0)/Pt  0.3, EXAFS experiments demonstrated the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms, for both PtSn/g-Al2O3 and PtSn/SiO2."
[4] "The ensemble of our catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reaction-regeneration cycles, recovering the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications."

The literature discusses the preparation, characterization, and catalytic properties of PtSn catalysts. These catalysts are prepared using surface organometallic reactions and characterized by techniques such as TEM, XPS, and EXAFS. The tin in these catalysts is found in forms of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV), with a notable electron charge transfer from tin to platinum. At high concentrations, PtSn alloys are formed that dilute metallic Pt atoms. The PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts prepared via SOMC/M techniques are shown to be stable and recoverable through multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, maintaining their initial activity and surface nature.

文献讨论了PtSn催化剂的制备、表征及其催化性质。这些催化剂通过表面有机金属反应制备，并通过TEM、XPS和EXAFS等技术进行表征。这些催化剂中的锡以Sn(0)和Sn(II,IV)的形式存在，表现出从锡到铂的电子电荷转移。在高浓度下，形成PtSn合金稀释金属铂原子。通过SOMC/M技术制备的PtSn/g-Al2O3催化剂在多次反应再生循环中表现出稳定性，恢复其初始活性并保持其表面性质。
