[1] "The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: XPS results show that in supported PtSn catalysts, tin is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV). The contribution of Sn(0) with respect to SnTOTAL is lower for alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts. In all tin modified platinum catalysts, our results show a downwards shift of approximately 1 eV in the BE of Pt."
[2] "This fact would be indicative of the existence of an electronic effect, suggesting that there is an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum."
[3] "EXAFS experiments in PtSn supported samples allow to demonstrate the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms for the higher Sn(0)/Pt ratios, in our case approximately 0.3. This PtSn alloy seems to be not active in the dehydrogenation reaction, and would have the mission of inhibiting cracking and coke formation reactions and of cleaning the active phase."
[4] "Catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results performed in this work, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts,prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reactionregeneration cycles, recover- ing the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications."

1. The tin in supported PtSn catalysts exists as Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV). The Sn(0) content is lower for alumina-supported catalysts compared to silica-supported ones. The Pt in tin-modified platinum catalysts experiences a 1 eV downshift in binding energy, suggesting an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum.

2. This downshift in Pt's binding energy indicates an electronic effect from tin, facilitating electron transfer to platinum.

3. At high Sn(0)/Pt ratios, a PtSn alloy dilutes metallic Pt atoms in the catalyst. This alloy is inactive in dehydrogenation reactions but helps inhibit cracking and coke formation, cleaning the active phase.

4. Bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts prepared via SOMC/M techniques can undergo multiple regeneration cycles, retaining initial activity and maintaining the catalytic surface's integrity.

1. 支持型PtSn催化剂中的锡以Sn(0)和Sn(II,IV)形式存在。对于氧化铝支持的催化剂，Sn(0)的含量较低，而对硅胶支持的催化剂则较高。在锡修饰的铂催化剂中，铂的结合能下降约1电子伏特，这表明存在从锡到铂的电子转移。

2. 这一铂结合能的下降表明了锡的电子效应，促进了电子向铂的转移。

3. 在较高的Sn(0)/Pt比下，一个PtSn合金稀释了铂原子。这种合金在脱氢反应中不活跃，但有助于抑制裂解和焦炭形成，清洁活性相。

4. 使用SOMC/M技术制备的双金属PtSn/g-Al2O3催化剂可以经历多次再生周期，保持初始活性，并维持催化表面的完整性。
