Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, both are employed in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts are noted for their high activity and selectivity, while metal oxide catalysts are recognized for their stability and resistance to poisoning. Recent advancements involve the utilization of mixed metal oxides and supported catalysts to improve efficiency. Both catalyst types encounter issues of deactivation over time, necessitating periodic regeneration or replacement.
