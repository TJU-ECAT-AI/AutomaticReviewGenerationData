Metal oxide catalysts consist of elements like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum, which can be tailored for specific reactions. Platinum catalysts often require careful preparation to incorporate other elements like Re to improve stability and activity. Metal oxides can be optimized for specific conditions by adjusting the composition and structure to enhance selectivity and resistance to deactivation.

3. Industrial applications of these catalysts include the production of alkenes from alkanes, where the nonoxidative dehydrogenation process is used to selectively produce specific alkenes. The choice of catalyst depends on factors such as the reaction conditions, stability requirements, and economic considerations. Platinum catalysts are preferred for their high activity and selectivity, while metal oxides may be favored for their cost-effectiveness and resistance to deactivation under harsh conditions.
