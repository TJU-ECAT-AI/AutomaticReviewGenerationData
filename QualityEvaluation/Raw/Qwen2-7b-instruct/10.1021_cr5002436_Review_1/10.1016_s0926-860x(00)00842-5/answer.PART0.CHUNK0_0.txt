Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals distinct characteristics and applications. Platinum catalysts are highly efficient and selective in the process, offering exceptional performance in converting light olefins to alkenes. On the other hand, metal oxide catalysts, especially vanadium oxides, are noted for their stability and resistance to deactivation, making them suitable for long-term industrial applications. Recent advancements in catalyst design aim to enhance both the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. These catalysts are widely utilized in the petrochemical industry, particularly for the production of alkenes from alkanes. Noble metals benefit from their high reactivity and selectivity, whereas metal oxides are valued for their stability and resistance to deactivation. There is potential for synergistic combinations of noble metals and metal oxides to develop more effective catalysts for industrial use.
