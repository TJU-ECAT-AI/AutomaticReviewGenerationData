Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find that noble metal-based catalysts are known for their high reactivity, making them effective for dehydrogenation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are valued for their stability and cost-effectiveness. Recent advancements include the use of supported catalysts and optimized reaction conditions. Noble metal-based catalysts offer high activity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts benefit from higher stability and lower costs.
