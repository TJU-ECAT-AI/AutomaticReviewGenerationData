[1] "The five main causes of deactivation are: poisoning,fouling, thermal degradation (sintering, evaporation) initiated by the often high temperature, mechanical damage and corrosion/leaching by the reaction mixture."
[2] "In the case of egg-shell poisoning, the most accessible sites are poisoned and,as a consequence, the observed deactivation behaviour is the same as in selective poisoning."
[3] "A catalyst was discovered with satisfactory activity. It was based on K, Cu and Mo, and as a result of the preparation method used, it contained some Cl."
[4] "For extremely high or low pH carbon should be considered, not alumina."
[5] "In the classical catalytic reforming process where addition of Re to the Pt/alumina catalyst leads to strongly improved stability."
[6] "A good example is the classical catalytic reforming process where addition of Re to the Pt/alumina catalyst leads to strongly improved stability."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts offer high selectivity and stability due to their ability to resist poisoning and maintain activity at high temperatures. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, can be tailored for specific reaction conditions and may offer cost-effectiveness due to their abundance and stability under harsh conditions. Recent developments include the incorporation of rare earth metals like Re in platinum catalysts to enhance stability and activity, as well as the optimization of metal oxide compositions to improve resistance to deactivation.

2. The composition of noble metal-based catalysts includes precious metals such as Platinum, which is known for its high reactivity and resistance to poisoning. Metal oxide catalysts consist of elements like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum, which can be tailored for specific reactions. Platinum catalysts often require careful preparation to incorporate other elements like Re to improve stability and activity. Metal oxides can be optimized for specific conditions by adjusting the composition and structure to enhance selectivity and resistance to deactivation.

3. Industrial applications of these catalysts include the production of alkenes from alkanes, where the nonoxidative dehydrogenation process is used to selectively produce specific alkenes. The choice of catalyst depends on factors such as the reaction conditions, stability requirements, and economic considerations. Platinum catalysts are preferred for their high activity and selectivity, while metal oxides may be favored for their cost-effectiveness and resistance to deactivation under harsh conditions.

4. Recent developments in this field involve the optimization of catalyst compositions and preparation methods to enhance stability, selectivity, and activity. This includes the use of rare earth metals like Re to improve the performance of noble metal catalysts and the development of metal oxide catalysts with tailored structures to optimize their properties for specific reactions. Research continues to explore ways to improve catalyst durability and efficiency in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

5. Potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include their high activity, selectivity, and resistance to poisoning. These advantages make them suitable for applications requiring high conversion rates and specific product distributions. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, offer cost-effectiveness and stability under harsh conditions, making them attractive for industrial processes with stringent economic constraints. The integration of rare earth metals in noble metal catalysts and the optimization of metal oxide compositions represent promising avenues for enhancing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation processes.
