The nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins utilizes both noble metal-based catalysts, prominently featuring Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, comprising oxides of metals like Chromium, Gallium, Indium, Vanadium, Zinc, and Molybdenum. Noble metals are renowned for their high activity and selectivity, making them efficient for the dehydrogenation process. Metal oxides, especially those containing Chromium, Vanadium, and Molybdenum, are also effective due to their capability to facilitate the reaction. These catalysts find industrial applications in the production of aromatic hydrocarbons, olefins, and other petrochemicals. Recent advancements aim at optimizing catalyst formulations to enhance stability and activity. Noble metal catalysts are favored for their superior activity and selectivity, whereas metal oxide catalysts are appreciated for their cost-effectiveness and broad availability. Both types of catalysts necessitate meticulous attention to reaction conditions, feed purity, and operational tactics to ensure optimal performance.
