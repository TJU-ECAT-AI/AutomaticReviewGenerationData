[1] "Two clear differences in the catalytic behavior of samples Pt-A and Pt,Sn-A can be observed: First, sample Pt-A is significantly more active than sample Pt,Sn-A."
[2] "Second, sample Pt,Sn-A is more stable than sample Pt-A both before and after activation."
[3] "On the other hand, all results are in good agreement with what observed from FT-IR measurements (Figures 4 and 6) during activation, indicating that the increase in initial activity observed for Pt,Sn-B sample after one or several reaction-regeneration cycles is mainly due to a dramatic increase in the number of accessible Pt sites."
[4] "It is well-known from the literature that the ethane hydrogenolysis reaction, which bears strong resemblances to the ethane reforming reaction to syngas, is strongly surface sensitive."
[5] "Several groups have previously reported an increase in alkene selectivity and a corresponding decrease in cracking or reforming to syngas when Sn is added to Pt-based catalysts for alkane (ethane, propane, butane) dehydrogenation."
[6] "However, to our knowledge, the clear correlation between product selectivity and masking of low-coordinated Pt sites in supported Pt catalysts as observed in the present work has not been reported before."

The study focuses on comparing noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The main differences highlighted are:

1. **Effectiveness**: Platinum-based catalysts, especially when promoted with tin (Pt,Sn), show higher selectivity towards ethene and greater stability compared to platinum alone (Pt) and other metal oxide-based catalysts.

2. **Industrial Applications**: Platinum-based catalysts, particularly those with tin addition, are found suitable for combined dehydrogenation-oxidation processes, and are also stable even at high temperatures needed for ethane dehydrogenation reactions.

3. **Recent Developments**: There is a notable increase in initial activity for the semicommercial Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst after activation, mainly due to a substantial rise in the number of accessible Pt sites.

4. **Surface Sensitivity**: The ethane hydrogenolysis reaction, akin to ethane reforming to syngas, is highly surface-sensitive, influencing product selectivity.

5. **Product Selectivity**: The addition of tin to platinum catalysts leads to an increase in alkene selectivity and a decrease in cracking or reforming to syngas, a finding not previously reported in literature.

6. **Advantages**: The correlation between the spectroscopic properties and catalytic performance of the catalysts suggests a good match, indicating potential improvements in catalyst design and selection based on these findings.

<p>Two clear differences in the catalytic behavior of samples Pt-A and Pt,Sn-A can be observed: First, sample Pt-A is significantly more active than sample Pt,Sn-A. Taking into account that the amount of Pt is lower in sample Pt-A than in sample Pt,Sn-A (see Table 1), and that the amount of accessible Pt sites per similar Pt amount is not markedly different for the two samples (as indicated by the intensity of ν(CO) modes).</p>
<p>Second, sample Pt,Sn-A is more stable than sample Pt-A both before and after activation.</p>
<p>It is well-known from the literature that the ethane hydrogenolysis reaction, which bears strong resemblances to the ethane reforming reaction to syngas (CO and H2), is strongly surface sensitive, see, e.g., refs 59 and 60 and references therein. As such, the high selectivity to CO over sample Pt-A compared to samples Pt,Sn-A and Pt,Sn-B is well in line with the FT-IR results presented in Figure 3, which clearly shows that while sample Pt-A contains low-coordinated Pt sites, those sites are covered by Sn in samples Pt,Sn-A and Pt,Sn-B.</p>
<p>Several groups have previously reported an increase in alkene selectivity and a corresponding decrease in cracking or reforming to syngas when Sn is added to Pt-based catalysts for alkane (ethane, propane, butane) dehydrogenation, see, e.g., refs 14 and 15 and references therein. However, to our knowledge, the clear correlation between product selectivity and masking of low-coordinated Pt sites in supported Pt catalysts as observed in the present work has not been reported before.</p>
<p>Finally, the FT-IR results obtained strongly suggest that the selectivity difference observed between Pt,Sn-A and Pt,Sn-B is related to an influence of strongly basic support sites on the metal function in the Pt,Sn-B catalyst (Figure 7).</p>
<p>As for the apparent activation energies for ethane conversion, they increase in the order Pt,Sn-B &gt; Pt,Sn-A &lt; Pt-A (Table 2). It would be expected that the activation energy of reaction is lower on low-coordinated Pt sites, and not higher, as observed in the present case. However, while CH bond scission has been reported as the rate-determining step in alkane dehydrogenation reactions,61 CC bond scission is reported to be rate-determining for ethane hydrogenolysis.62,63 A combined kinetic study of H/D exchange and hydrogenolysis of ethane over Pt(111) single-crystal surfaces revealed that the activation energy was 80 and 142 kJ/mol, respectively, for the two reactions.64 Provided that ethane reforming to synthesis gas, observed in the present work, is rate-limited by the same step as ethane hydrogenolysis, the trend in apparent activation energy for the three catalysts is well in line with the selectivities observed for the three catalysts. The faster deactivation of sample Pt-A compared to Pt,Sn-A and Pt,Sn-B further suggests that adsorption of reaction intermediates, subsequently leading to coke formation, is favored on the former catalyst.</p>

The document discusses noble metal-based catalysts (specifically Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. 

Compared to noble metal-based catalysts, metal oxide-based catalysts are typically cheaper and more stable. However, they often exhibit lower activity and selectivity towards desired products. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving their activity and selectivity, often through the use of promoters or through the development of new oxide compositions. For instance, the addition of tin to platinum catalysts has been shown to improve dehydrogenation selectivity and stability. 

The document highlights the advantages of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for dehydrogenation reactions. Platinum catalysts are known for their high activity and selectivity, especially for dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene. The addition of tin to platinum catalysts results in a geometric and chemical effect on the surface properties of the exposed platinum atoms, leading to higher selectivity towards ethene and higher stability. This is attributed to the masking of low-coordinated platinum sites by tin, which covers the more energetic sites and smooths the particles.

In summary, noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, offer superior performance in dehydrogenation reactions due to their high activity and selectivity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, while cheaper and more stable, require advancements in composition and promoter addition to match the performance of noble metal catalysts.

文献强调了铂基催化剂的优势，特别是在乙烯脱氢反应中的高活性和选择性。向铂催化剂中添加锡可产生几何和化学效应，影响暴露铂原子的表面性质，导致乙烷脱氢选择性更高、稳定性更好。这归因于锡覆盖低配位铂位点，覆盖能级更高的位点并使颗粒平滑。

简而言之，铂基催化剂由于其高活性和选择性，在脱氢反应中表现出优越性能。而金属氧化物基催化剂需要在组成和添加促进剂方面的进步以匹配铂基催化剂的性能。

The document discusses noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts are noted for their high selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation processes, often surpassing metal oxide-based catalysts in terms of efficiency and product selectivity. Platinum is frequently promoted with tin to enhance catalytic activity and dehydrogenation selectivity, prevent sintering, and decrease deactivation due to coke formation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are also used in commercial dehydrogenation processes. Chromium oxide-supported alumina and platinum-tin supported on alumina are common types. The document highlights the importance of understanding the correlation between catalyst surface properties and activity/selectivity for rational catalyst design. It also discusses the role of support materials in affecting the properties of the metallic phase and modifying the selectivity of the supported catalytic system. The study focuses on Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts and investigates the reason for their high selectivity and stability in light alkane dehydrogenation. Sn addition leads to more selective and stable ethane dehydrogenation catalysts, correlating with the masking of low-coordinated Pt sites. The document further examines the effect of Sn on Pt in the PtSn bimetallic catalytic system, suggesting both geometric and electronic effects. The geometric effect involves a dilution of Pt by Sn, reducing the number of adjacent Pt atoms and decreasing the number of Pt atoms forming active sites for coke precursor formation or structure-sensitive reactions. The electronic effect refers to a change in the electronic properties of platinum by addition of Sn, decreasing the strength of the bond between adsorbed hydrocarbons and surface metal atoms. The document also discusses the importance of considering the acid-base properties of the support material, as these can affect the selectivity of the supported catalytic system. The results show that the presence of strongly basic sites on the support promotes dehydrogenation selectivity in Pt,Sn catalysts, while these sites are masked by Sn, covering the low-coordinated Pt sites that are active for ethane reforming to synthesis gas. The study concludes with a discussion on the correlation between the spectroscopic and catalytic properties of the three samples, indicating a good correlation between their properties.
