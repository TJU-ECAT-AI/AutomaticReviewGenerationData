[1] "Two clear differences in the catalytic behavior of samples Pt-A and Pt,Sn-A can be observed: First, sample Pt-A is significantly more active than sample Pt,Sn-A."
[2] "Second, sample Pt,Sn-A is more stable than sample Pt-A both before and after activation."
[3] "It is well-known from the literature that the ethane hydrogenolysis reaction, which bears strong resemblances to the ethane reforming reaction to syngas, is strongly surface sensitive."
[4] "Several groups have previously reported an increase in alkene selectivity and a corresponding decrease in cracking or reforming to syngas when Sn is added to Pt-based catalysts for alkane (ethane, propane, butane) dehydrogenation."
[5] "However, to our knowledge, the clear correlation between product selectivity and masking of low-coordinated Pt sites in supported Pt catalysts as observed in the present work has not been reported before."

The document discusses the comparative properties of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document highlights the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalyst types. It emphasizes the role of Platinum and its performance in dehydrogenation reactions compared to metal oxides. The text also mentions the importance of surface sensitivity in ethane hydrogenolysis and the impact of adding tin (Sn) to Platinum catalysts, which results in improved alkene selectivity and decreased cracking or reforming to syngas. The document notes that there is a clear correlation between product selectivity and the masking of low-coordinated Platinum sites, a phenomenon not previously reported in the literature.

文献讨论了贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，以及氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢反应中的比较性质。文献强调了这些催化剂类型在组成、有效性、工业应用、最近发展和潜在优势方面的特点。它强调了铂及其在脱氢反应中的性能与金属氧化物相比。文本还提到了乙烷氢解反应表面敏感性的关键性，并指出向铂基催化剂中添加锡（Sn）能显著提高烯烃选择性和减少裂解或合成气形成。文献指出，在现有文献中，产品选择性和低配位铂位遮蔽之间的明显相关性是一个未被报道的现象。
