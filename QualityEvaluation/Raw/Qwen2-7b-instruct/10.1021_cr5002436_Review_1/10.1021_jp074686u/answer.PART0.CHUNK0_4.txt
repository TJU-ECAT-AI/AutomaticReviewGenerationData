[1] "Two clear differences in the catalytic behavior of samples Pt-A and Pt,Sn-A can be observed: First, sample Pt-A is significantly more active than sample Pt,Sn-A."
[2] "Ethane dehydrogenation test results for sample Pt,Sn-B at 600 C are shown in Figure 9. The initial activity increases by a factor of 1.9 during the first activation cycle (passing from R1 to R2), while it increases to 2.4 times the initial R1 activity after the second activation cycle (R3)."
[3] "It is well-known from the literature that the ethane hydrogenolysis reaction, which bears strong resemblances to the ethane reforming reaction to syngas, is strongly surface sensitive."
[4] "Finally, the FT-IR results obtained strongly suggest that the selectivity difference observed between Pt,Sn-A and Pt,Sn-B is related to an influence of strongly basic support sites on the metal function in the Pt,Sn-B catalyst."
[5] "During activation, a significant increase in ethane dehydrogenation activity for a semicommercial Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst is accompanied by a dramatic increase in exposed Pt sites, observed by IR spectroscopy."

The document discusses noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts are noted for their high selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation processes, often surpassing metal oxide-based catalysts in terms of efficiency and product selectivity. Platinum is frequently promoted with tin to enhance catalytic activity and dehydrogenation selectivity, prevent sintering, and decrease deactivation due to coke formation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are also used in commercial dehydrogenation processes. Chromium oxide-supported alumina and platinum-tin supported on alumina are common types. The document highlights the importance of understanding the correlation between catalyst surface properties and activity/selectivity for rational catalyst design. It also discusses the role of support materials in affecting the properties of the metallic phase and modifying the selectivity of the supported catalytic system. The study focuses on Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts and investigates the reason for their high selectivity and stability in light alkane dehydrogenation. Sn addition leads to more selective and stable ethane dehydrogenation catalysts, correlating with the masking of low-coordinated Pt sites. The document further examines the effect of Sn on Pt in the PtSn bimetallic catalytic system, suggesting both geometric and electronic effects. The geometric effect involves a dilution of Pt by Sn, reducing the number of adjacent Pt atoms and decreasing the number of Pt atoms forming active sites for coke precursor formation or structure-sensitive reactions. The electronic effect refers to a change in the electronic properties of platinum by addition of Sn, decreasing the strength of the bond between adsorbed hydrocarbons and surface metal atoms. The document also discusses the importance of considering the acid-base properties of the support material, as these can affect the selectivity of the supported catalytic system. The results show that the presence of strongly basic sites on the support promotes dehydrogenation selectivity in Pt,Sn catalysts, while these sites are masked by Sn, covering the low-coordinated Pt sites that are active for ethane reforming to synthesis gas. The study concludes with a discussion on the correlation between the spectroscopic and catalytic properties of the three samples, indicating a good correlation between their properties.
