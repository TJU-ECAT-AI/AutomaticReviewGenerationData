1. 高贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，广泛用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，也在这一过程中被使用。铂基催化剂因其在轻烷烃脱氢中的高活性和选择性而闻名。金属氧化物催化剂比高贵金属更经济有效，但往往需要更高的温度才能达到最佳性能。最近的发展包括使用负载催化剂，通过引入锡、铜或金等促进剂来增强活性和稳定性。在工业应用中，铂基催化剂用于STAR和Oleflex过程，而金属氧化物则用于Cr基过程。铂催化剂的优点包括其在高温下的稳定性以及它们能够促进脱氢和氧化反应的能力。锡等促进剂通过覆盖铂原子上的低配位点来提高选择性和寿命，从而增强脱氢选择性。当金属氧化物与高贵金属掺杂时，可以实现更高选择性和稳定性的脱氢。正在进行努力开发具有更好热稳定性和抗结焦能力的催化剂，这对于高效的脱氢过程至关重要。
