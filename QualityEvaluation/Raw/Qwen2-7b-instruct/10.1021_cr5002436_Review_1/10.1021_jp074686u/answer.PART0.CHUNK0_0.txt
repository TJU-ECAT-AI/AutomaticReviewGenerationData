[1] "Two clear differences in the catalytic behavior of samples Pt-A and Pt,Sn-A can be observed: First, sample Pt-A is significantly more active than sample Pt,Sn-A."
[2] "Second, sample Pt,Sn-A is more stable than sample Pt-A both before and after activation."
[3] "On the other hand, all results are in good agreement with what observed from FT-IR measurements (Figures 4 and 6) during activation, indicating that the increase in initial activity observed for Pt,Sn-B sample after one or several reaction-regeneration cycles is mainly due to a dramatic increase in the number of accessible Pt sites."
[4] "It is well-known from the literature that the ethane hydrogenolysis reaction, which bears strong resemblances to the ethane reforming reaction to syngas, is strongly surface sensitive."
[5] "Several groups have previously reported an increase in alkene selectivity and a corresponding decrease in cracking or reforming to syngas when Sn is added to Pt-based catalysts for alkane (ethane, propane, butane) dehydrogenation."
[6] "However, to our knowledge, the clear correlation between product selectivity and masking of low-coordinated Pt sites in supported Pt catalysts as observed in the present work has not been reported before."

The study focuses on comparing noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The main differences highlighted are:

1. **Effectiveness**: Platinum-based catalysts, especially when promoted with tin (Pt,Sn), show higher selectivity towards ethene and greater stability compared to platinum alone (Pt) and other metal oxide-based catalysts.

2. **Industrial Applications**: Platinum-based catalysts, particularly those with tin addition, are found suitable for combined dehydrogenation-oxidation processes, and are also stable even at high temperatures needed for ethane dehydrogenation reactions.

3. **Recent Developments**: There is a notable increase in initial activity for the semicommercial Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst after activation, mainly due to a substantial rise in the number of accessible Pt sites.

4. **Surface Sensitivity**: The ethane hydrogenolysis reaction, akin to ethane reforming to syngas, is highly surface-sensitive, influencing product selectivity.

5. **Product Selectivity**: The addition of tin to platinum catalysts leads to an increase in alkene selectivity and a decrease in cracking or reforming to syngas, a finding not previously reported in literature.

6. **Advantages**: The correlation between the spectroscopic properties and catalytic performance of the catalysts suggests a good match, indicating potential improvements in catalyst design and selection based on these findings.

研究主要比较了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中，基于贵金属（特别是铂）和金属氧化物（如铬氧化物、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）催化剂的应用。主要差异包括：

1. **有效性**：添加锡的铂基催化剂（Pt,Sn）显示出更高的乙烯选择性以及更佳的稳定性，与仅含铂（Pt）或其它金属氧化物基催化剂相比。

2. **工业应用**：铂基催化剂，尤其是添加锡的催化剂，适合结合脱氢和氧化过程，并且在需要高温进行乙烷脱氢反应时表现出稳定性。

3. **最新进展**：商用Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O催化剂在激活后初始活性显著增加，主要原因是可接触的铂位点数量大幅上升。

4. **表面敏感性**：乙烷脱氢反应与合成气形成相似，高度依赖于催化剂表面特性，影响产物选择性。

5. **产品选择性**：向铂基催化剂中添加锡导致了更高程度的烯烃选择性以及较低程度的裂解或形成合成气，这一发现之前未见文献报道。

6. **优势**：光谱性质与催化性能之间的良好匹配关系提示，未来催化剂设计和选择可以根据这些发现进行优化。
