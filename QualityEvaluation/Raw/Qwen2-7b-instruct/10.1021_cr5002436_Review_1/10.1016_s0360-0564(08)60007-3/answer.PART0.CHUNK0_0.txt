Advances in Catalysis, Volume 38 discusses the composition of the catalytic cycle which includes adsorption steps, surface reactions, and desorption steps. The heat evolved upon contact between a reactive molecule and a solid surface is linked to the energy of bonds formed between adsorbed species and the adsorbent. Microcalorimetry is highlighted as a precise method for determining site strength. In studying the interaction of water vapor with highly dehydroxylated α-Al2O3, Fubini et al. identified three adsorption mechanisms: physisorption on hydroxyl groups, coordination of molecular water to Lewis sites, and dissociative adsorption on the highly dehydroxylated surface.

《催化进展》第38卷讨论了催化循环的组成，包括吸附步骤、表面反应过程和脱附步骤。当活性分子与固体表面接触时释放的热量与吸附物种与吸附剂之间形成的键能有关。微热流计被强调为确定位点强度的精确方法。在研究水蒸气与高度去羟基化的α-Al2O3的相互作用时，Fubini等人识别出三种吸附机制：羟基上的物理吸附、分子水向Lewis位点的配位以及在高度去羟基化表面上的离解吸附。
