Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, reveals several key distinctions and similarities. Noble metals, notably Platinum, are renowned for their high efficiency in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, converting these compounds into paraffins effectively. They are highly valued in applications demanding the production of lighter hydrocarbons. Metal oxides, on the other hand, offer alternative benefits. CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are recognized for their stability and cost-effectiveness, making them attractive alternatives to noble metals. Recent advancements in the field aim to enhance the selectivity and activity of both catalyst types. This includes optimizing catalyst structures, adjusting operational parameters, and exploring innovative compositions. Indium oxide (In2O3) and gallium oxide (Ga2O3) stand out as promising candidates due to their exceptional stability and resistance to poisoning. These materials are increasingly under investigation for their potential in nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Vanadium oxide (VOx) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) are utilized for their high catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions, often serving in the petrochemical sector for the transformation of heavier hydrocarbons.
