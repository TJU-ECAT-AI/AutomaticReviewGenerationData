[1] "The procedure used in the studies described above can be used to provide a more detailed characterization of the acid properties of solid acid catalysts,for example, differentiate reversible and irreversible adsorption processes."

[2] "The technique can provide a valuable method to evaluate the strong acidity of these materials."

[3] "For example, Auroux et al. (128) used these techniques with ammonia adsorption to obtain a better definition of the acidity of decationated and boron-modified ZSM-5 zeolites."

The document discusses the application of adsorption microcalorimetry in the characterization of acid properties of solid acid catalysts. It mentions that the technique can be used to differentiate between reversible and irreversible adsorption processes, providing insights into the strong acidity of materials. The method is valuable for evaluating the acidity of catalysts, exemplified by Auroux et al.'s use of ammonia adsorption to define the acidity of modified ZSM-5 zeolites.
