Noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity in this process. Metal oxide catalysts, though more affordable and durable, often have lower activity and selectivity compared to noble metal catalysts. Recent advancements involve the use of supported metal catalysts, where noble metals are loaded onto metal oxides to enhance stability and reduce costs. Indium oxide (In2O3) and gallium oxide (Ga2O3) have been studied for their potential in dehydrogenation reactions. Vanadium oxide (VOx) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) have also shown promise in specific dehydrogenation processes.

贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂金，以及金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢反应中被使用。铂基催化剂在该过程中表现出高活性和选择性。相比之下，金属氧化物催化剂虽然更耐用且成本更低，但在活性和选择性方面往往较低。近期发展包括使用负载型金属催化剂，通过将贵金属负载到金属氧化物上以提高稳定性和降低成本。已研究了铟氧化物（In2O3）和镓氧化物（Ga2O3）在脱氢反应中的潜力。此外，也发现了钨氧化物（WOx）和钼氧化物（MoOx）在某些脱氢过程中展现出前景。
