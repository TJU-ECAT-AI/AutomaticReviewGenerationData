Non-oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts play a crucial role in petrochemical industries for converting light olefins into higher value products. Noble metals such as Platinum are often used for their high reactivity and selectivity in these reactions. They can efficiently convert olefins into corresponding hydrocarbons without oxidizing them. On the other hand, metal oxides are used for their stability, cost-effectiveness, and ability to operate under harsh conditions. Examples of metal oxides include CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. These materials are effective in dehydrogenation reactions due to their acidic sites that facilitate the breaking of olefinic bonds. Recent developments focus on improving the activity and stability of these catalysts through doping, modifying the oxide structure, or combining them with other materials to achieve better performance. Industrial applications of these catalysts include the production of gasoline, diesel, and petrochemical intermediates. The potential advantages of these catalysts include higher yield, lower energy consumption, and environmental friendliness compared to traditional methods. However, ongoing research aims to further enhance their efficiency and reduce costs to make them more competitive in the market.

非氧化脱氢催化剂在石油化工行业中起着至关重要的作用，用于将轻烯烃转化为更高价值的产品。铂等贵金属常被用作此类反应的高效催化剂，因其高活性和选择性。它们能够有效地将烯烃转化为相应的烃类化合物而无需氧化。另一方面，金属氧化物因其稳定性、成本效益以及能在苛刻条件下操作而被广泛使用。例如，CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等材料在脱氢反应中表现出效用，因为它们的酸性位点能促进烯烃键的断裂。近期的研究发展集中在提高这些催化剂的活性和稳定性上，通过掺杂、改变氧化物结构或与其他材料结合来实现更好的性能。工业应用包括汽油、柴油和石化中间体的生产。这些催化剂的优势可能包括更高的产率、更低的能量消耗和更环保，但持续的研究旨在进一步提高其效率并降低成本，使其在市场中更具竞争力。
