Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins is a critical process in petrochemical industries, involving the conversion of ethene, propene, and butene into ethane, propane, and butane, respectively. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are commonly employed in this process. Platinum catalysts are highly efficient for converting ethene to ethane, while metal oxide catalysts like CrOx and others are effective in transforming propene and butene into propane and butane, respectively. Recent advancements aim to improve the stability and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts to match the performance of noble metal catalysts. Potential benefits of metal oxide catalysts include lower costs, higher stability under harsh conditions, and the ability to customize their properties through doping and modification.
