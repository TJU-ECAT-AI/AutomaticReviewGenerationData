<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins utilizes both noble metal-based catalysts, notably platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, including compounds such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Noble metals like platinum are prized for their catalytic prowess and durability in dehydrogenation processes, but they demand higher operating temperatures and pressures, and can pose environmental concerns due to their cost and potential toxicity. Metal oxides, by contrast, are more economically viable, capable of functioning under less severe conditions, and offer the promise of simpler catalyst regeneration and handling. Recent advancements aim to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of metal oxide catalysts, mitigating the risk of unwanted side reactions. While noble metals excel in catalytic performance, metal oxides represent a more affordable alternative, with ongoing research exploring their potential for more sustainable and efficient dehydrogenation applications.

非氧化性脱氢反应中，特别是轻烯烃，通常使用贵金属催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）。贵金属，如铂，因其在脱氢反应中的催化活性和稳定性而脱颖而出。然而，它们通常需要更高的温度和压力才能达到最佳性能，并且可能因成本高和潜在毒性问题而带来环境问题。金属氧化物催化剂则提供了更经济的解决方案，能够在较温和的条件下工作，并且具有更简单的催化剂再生和处理潜力。近年来的研究重点在于提高金属氧化物催化剂的选择性和效率，以减少不必要的副反应。虽然贵金属在催化性能方面表现出色，但金属氧化物代表了一个更经济的选择，目前正在进行研究，探索其在更可持续和高效脱氢应用中的潜力。
