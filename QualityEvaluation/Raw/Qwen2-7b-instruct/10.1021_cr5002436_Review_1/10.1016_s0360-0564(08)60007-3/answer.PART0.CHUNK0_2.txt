The nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins employs both noble metal-based catalysts, notably platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts. Chromium oxides (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are examples of the latter. Metal oxides typically offer advantages such as lower costs, higher stability, and broader applicability compared to noble metals. Recent advancements aim to enhance these catalysts' selectivity, activity, and resistance to poisoning. Industrially, these catalysts convert ethylene, propylene, and butenes into higher-valued hydrocarbons like propylene oxide and cyclohexene. Efforts focus on optimizing metal oxide composition and structure to match specific reactions and conditions. Researchers also investigate the benefits of combining noble metals with metal oxides. A challenge with metal oxides is their vulnerability to sintering, leading to a decline in surface area and activity over time.
