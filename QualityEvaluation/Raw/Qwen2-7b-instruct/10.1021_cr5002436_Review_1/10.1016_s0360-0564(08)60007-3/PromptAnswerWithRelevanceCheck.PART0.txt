The nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins utilizes both noble metal-based catalysts, notably platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, including compounds such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Noble metals like platinum are prized for their catalytic prowess and durability in dehydrogenation processes, but they demand higher operating temperatures and pressures, and can pose environmental concerns due to their cost and potential toxicity. Metal oxides, by contrast, are more economically viable, capable of functioning under less severe conditions, and offer the promise of simpler catalyst regeneration and handling. Recent advancements aim to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of metal oxide catalysts, mitigating the risk of unwanted side reactions. While noble metals excel in catalytic performance, metal oxides represent a more affordable alternative, with ongoing research exploring their potential for more sustainable and efficient dehydrogenation applications.

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are often used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are known for their ability to efficiently convert olefins into alkynes or aromatics without the use of oxygen. Platinum-based catalysts are favored for their high activity and selectivity, allowing for the production of high-quality products with minimal side reactions.

Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, also play significant roles in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are typically cheaper than noble metals and offer a balance between cost-effectiveness and performance. They can exhibit good activity and stability under certain conditions, making them attractive for industrial applications. However, they may require higher operating temperatures and might not achieve the same level of selectivity as noble metal catalysts.

Recent developments in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation include the use of supported metal catalysts, the optimization of operating conditions, and the exploration of new catalyst materials. Researchers are continuously working on improving catalyst efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and minimizing environmental impact. Some efforts focus on developing catalysts with enhanced selectivity towards specific product distributions, such as increasing the yield of alkenes or aromatics.

Advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include their superior activity and selectivity, but they are often associated with higher costs and potentially lower stability compared to metal oxide catalysts.
