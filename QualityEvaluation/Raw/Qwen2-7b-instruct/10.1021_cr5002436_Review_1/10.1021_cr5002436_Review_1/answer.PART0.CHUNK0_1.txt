4.1 Platinum-Based Catalysts

In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents. This new approach was inspired by the well-known bifunctional supported metal catalysts utilized in catalytic reforming, where a noble metal catalyzes hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions and the acidic support provides the active sites needed for isomerization, cyclization, and hydrocracking reactions. In contrast, dehydrogenation catalysts are monofunctional, as the acidic function must be minimized to avoid side reactions.

4.1.1 Nature of the Active Sites

Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed.

4.1.2 Catalyst Deactivation

Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity.

4.1.3 Role of the Support

Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization.

4.1.4 Role of the Promoters

Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst.

Nonoxidative dehydrogenation catalysts are primarily categorized into noble metal-based (e.g., Platinum) and metal oxide-based (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) formulations. Noble metal-based catalysts, notably Platinum, are effective due to their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity towards CC cleavage. They have been widely used in industrial applications since the 1960s, contributing significantly to the detergent industry. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as gallium and zinc oxides, offer promising results in dehydrogenation, with gallium oxide being particularly noted for its industrial use. The nature of active sites in Platinum-based catalysts is insensitive to particle size, while deactivation mechanisms involve coke formation and side reactions. The role of support and promoters aims to enhance stability and selectivity in the catalysts.
