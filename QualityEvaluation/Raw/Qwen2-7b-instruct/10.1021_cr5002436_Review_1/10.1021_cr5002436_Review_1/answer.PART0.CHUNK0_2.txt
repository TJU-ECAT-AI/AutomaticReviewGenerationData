4.1 Platinum-Based Catalysts
In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents. (26) This new approach was inspired by the well-known bifunctional supported metal catalysts utilized in catalytic reforming, where a noble metal catalyzes hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions and the acidic support provides the active sites needed for isomerization, cyclization, and hydrocracking reactions. In contrast, dehydrogenation catalysts are monofunctional, as the acidic function must be minimized to avoid side reactions.

4.1.1 Nature of the Active Sites
Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed. As only the amount of active sites is relevant, small particles are preferred. However, undesired side reactions that occur during alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, although there is no general consensus regarding the effect of dispersion on the rate of these reactions.

4.1.2 Catalyst Deactivation
Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity. As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits. However, the high temperature of both the regeneration process and the dehydrogenation reaction triggers the agglomeration or sintering of the platinum nanoparticles, the concomitant loss in active sites also resulting in catalyst deactivation.

4.1.3 Role of the Support
Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.

4.1.4 Role of the Promoters
Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst. Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support.

4.2 Metal Oxide-Based Catalysts
Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use. Furthermore, promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Nonoxidative dehydrogenation catalysts are primarily categorized into noble metal-based and metal oxide-based materials. Platinum-based catalysts, inspired by bifunctional supported metal catalysts used in catalytic reforming, are monofunctional and require a reduction step for activation. They are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, influencing the rates of side reactions like hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation. The support material must be thermally stable, limit acidity, and facilitate an optimal distribution of the metallic particles. Promoters like tin modify the catalyst's properties, enhancing selectivity and stability.

Metal oxide-based catalysts, exemplified by CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer alternative options for dehydrogenation. They have been successfully tested and show promise in industrial applications. The specific data in Table 3 compare the catalytic performance of various platinum-based catalysts, highlighting conversion, selectivity, temperature, space velocity, feed composition, specific activity, deactivation rate, and catalyst lifetime.

In summary, while platinum-based catalysts excel in dehydrogenation efficiency, they face challenges in selectivity and stability. Metal oxide-based catalysts provide alternatives, demonstrating potential in industrial applications. The use of promoters, especially tin, improves the performance of both types of catalysts.
