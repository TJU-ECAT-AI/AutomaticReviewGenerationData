4.1 Platinum-Based Catalysts

In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents. This new approach was inspired by the well-known bifunctional supported metal catalysts utilized in catalytic reforming, where a noble metal catalyzes hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions and the acidic support provides the active sites needed for isomerization, cyclization, and hydrocracking reactions. 

4.1.1 Nature of the Active Sites

Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed.

4.1.2 Catalyst Deactivation

Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity.

4.1.3 Role of the Support

High surface area alumina is the classical support employed in platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and its exceptional ability of maintaining the platinum nanoparticles dispersed, which is crucial to attain stable catalyst performance.

4.1.4 Role of the Promoters

Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support.

The nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins primarily uses two types of catalysts: noble metal-based (specifically platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts, inspired by bifunctional supported metal catalysts in catalytic reforming, are highly effective in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. Platinum is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity towards CC cleavage. The nature of the active sites is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, with small particles preferred for dehydrogenation reactions. Catalyst deactivation occurs due to carbon deposits forming on the catalyst surface, leading to a drop in activity. Platinum particles are often supported on high surface area alumina, which maintains the dispersion of the platinum nanoparticles for stable catalyst performance. Tin (Sn) is a common promoter that suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes support acidity, and facilitates the diffusion of coke species.

非氧化性脱氢主要使用两种催化剂：贵金属基（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂。铂基催化剂，受到催化重整中双功能支持金属催化剂的启发，对于氢化和脱氢反应非常有效。由于其对碳链氢键激活的优越性和对CC断裂活性较低，铂是唯一在商业应用中使用的贵金属。活性位点的性质对铂颗粒的结构不敏感，更小的颗粒更适合脱氢反应。催化剂失活的原因是催化剂表面形成碳沉积物，覆盖了活性位点，导致活性下降。铂颗粒通常被高表面积的氧化铝支持，以保持铂纳米粒子的分散，确保催化剂性能稳定。锡（Sn）是一种常见的促进剂，可以抑制氢解和异构化反应，减少金属聚集，中和支持体的酸性，并促进焦炭物种从金属表面向支撑体的扩散。
