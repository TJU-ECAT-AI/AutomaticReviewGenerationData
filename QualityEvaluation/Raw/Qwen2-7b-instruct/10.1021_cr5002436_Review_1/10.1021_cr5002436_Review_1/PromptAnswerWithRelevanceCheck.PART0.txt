4 Overview of Nonoxidative Dehydrogenation Catalyst Materials

"Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

"Furthermore, promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides."

"In contrast, dehydrogenation catalysts are monofunctional, as the acidic function must be minimized to avoid side reactions."

"Indeed, it was found that step sites are more reactive, as the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) than on the flat surface (6372 kJ mol1)."

"However, Pt can be redispersed on the catalyst by the addition of low amounts of oxygen and chlorine in the feed at temperatures around 500 C, although this process can only occur when the interaction between the support and the PtOx and PtOxCly species formed is such that mobile surface complexes are produced."

"High surface area alumina is the classical support employed in platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and its exceptional ability of maintaining the platinum nanoparticles dispersed, which is crucial to attain stable catalyst performance."

"However, most alumina supports are acidic, and therefore promoters are used to curb support acidity."

"Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step."

"Indeed, both geometric and electronic effects have been invoked to explain the mechanism through which tin influences the catalytic properties of platinum."

"Summarizing, Figure 12 shows an artist impression of a PtSn nanoparticle on alumina."

"An overview of the Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts discussed above, including relevant reaction parameters, such as conversion, selectivity, temperature, space velocity, and feed composition, is given in Table 3."

Nonoxidative dehydrogenation catalyst materials encompass both noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Platinum (Pt), a precious metal, has been extensively studied and is used in industrial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity towards CC cleavage. Various metal oxides, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been tested and show promise. Platinum catalysts are monofunctional, focusing on dehydrogenation reactions with minimized acidic functions to prevent unwanted side reactions. Step sites on Pt surfaces are more reactive for dehydrogenation, offering a lower energy barrier for propylene formation compared to flat surfaces. Redispersion of Pt nanoparticles can occur through the addition of oxygen and chlorine in the feed at certain temperatures, provided there is a suitable interaction between the support and Pt species. Alumina is a common support for Pt-based catalysts, valued for its thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain dispersed Pt nanoparticles. Promoters are often used to reduce acidity and prevent side reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization. Metal oxides, like CrOx, are used for their industrial applications and specific catalytic properties. The geometric and electronic effects of tin on Pt catalysts have been explained, showing how tin can suppress hydrogenolysis and isomerization, retard sintering of Pt nanoparticles, and facilitate the migration of coke precursors to the support. Alumina, with its high thermal stability, is a preferred support for Pt catalysts, aiding in the maintenance of dispersed Pt nanoparticles. Table 3 offers an overview of the catalytic data of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts, including parameters like conversion, selectivity, temperature, space velocity, and feed composition.

非氧化性脱氢化催化剂材料包括贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂。铂（Pt），一种贵重金属，已被广泛研究并在工业应用中使用，因为它对烷烃中的碳氢键具有优越的激活作用，并且对碳碳键的裂解活性较低。各种金属氧化物，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，也已成功测试并显示出潜力。铂催化剂是单功能的，专注于脱氢反应，同时最小化酸性功能以避免副反应。铂表面的台阶位点对于脱氢反应更为活跃，形成丙烯的能垒在台阶位点（2434 kJ mol1）比平面上（6372 kJ mol1）要低得多。通过向原料气中添加氧气和氯气并在约500℃的温度下进行，可以实现铂纳米粒子的再分散，前提是支持物与PtOx和PtOxCly物种之间存在合适的相互作用，从而产生移动表面复合物。高表面积的氧化铝被用作铂基脱氢化催化剂的支撑物，因其良好的热稳定性、机械强度以及保持分散的铂纳米颗粒的能力，这对维持稳定的催化剂性能至关重要。大多数氧化铝支撑物是酸性的，因此使用促进剂来抑制支撑物的酸性。用于脱氢化烷烃的支撑物需要在再生步骤中承受苛刻的水热条件。已提出几何和电子效应来解释锡对铂催化剂性质的影响机制。总结起来，图12展示了氧化铝上的PtSn纳米颗粒的艺术构想。对上述铂基脱氢化催化剂的概述，包括转化率、选择性、温度、空间速度和原料组成等关键参数，在表格3中给出。

4.1 Platinum-Based Catalysts

In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents. This new approach was inspired by the well-known bifunctional supported metal catalysts utilized in catalytic reforming, where a noble metal catalyzes hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions and the acidic support provides the active sites needed for isomerization, cyclization, and hydrocracking reactions. In contrast, dehydrogenation catalysts are monofunctional, as the acidic function must be minimized to avoid side reactions.

4.1.1 Nature of the Active Sites

Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed.

4.1.2 Catalyst Deactivation

Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity.

4.1.3 Role of the Support

Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization.

4.1.4 Role of the Promoters

Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst.

Nonoxidative dehydrogenation catalysts are primarily categorized into noble metal-based (e.g., Platinum) and metal oxide-based (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) formulations. Noble metal-based catalysts, notably Platinum, are effective due to their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity towards CC cleavage. They have been widely used in industrial applications since the 1960s, contributing significantly to the detergent industry. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as gallium and zinc oxides, offer promising results in dehydrogenation, with gallium oxide being particularly noted for its industrial use. The nature of active sites in Platinum-based catalysts is insensitive to particle size, while deactivation mechanisms involve coke formation and side reactions. The role of support and promoters aims to enhance stability and selectivity in the catalysts.

4.1 Platinum-Based Catalysts
In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents. (26) This new approach was inspired by the well-known bifunctional supported metal catalysts utilized in catalytic reforming, where a noble metal catalyzes hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions and the acidic support provides the active sites needed for isomerization, cyclization, and hydrocracking reactions. In contrast, dehydrogenation catalysts are monofunctional, as the acidic function must be minimized to avoid side reactions.

4.1.1 Nature of the Active Sites
Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed. As only the amount of active sites is relevant, small particles are preferred. However, undesired side reactions that occur during alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, although there is no general consensus regarding the effect of dispersion on the rate of these reactions.

4.1.2 Catalyst Deactivation
Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity. As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits. However, the high temperature of both the regeneration process and the dehydrogenation reaction triggers the agglomeration or sintering of the platinum nanoparticles, the concomitant loss in active sites also resulting in catalyst deactivation.

4.1.3 Role of the Support
Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.

4.1.4 Role of the Promoters
Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst. Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support.

4.2 Metal Oxide-Based Catalysts
Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use. Furthermore, promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Promoters like tin modify the catalyst's properties, enhancing selectivity and stability.

Metal oxide-based catalysts, exemplified by CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer alternative options for dehydrogenation. They have been successfully tested and show promise in industrial applications. The specific data in Table 3 compare the catalytic performance of various platinum-based catalysts, highlighting conversion, selectivity, temperature, space velocity, feed composition, specific activity, deactivation rate, and catalyst lifetime.

In summary, while platinum-based catalysts excel in dehydrogenation efficiency, they face challenges in selectivity and stability. Metal oxide-based catalysts provide alternatives, demonstrating potential in industrial applications. The use of promoters, especially tin, improves the performance of both types of catalysts.
