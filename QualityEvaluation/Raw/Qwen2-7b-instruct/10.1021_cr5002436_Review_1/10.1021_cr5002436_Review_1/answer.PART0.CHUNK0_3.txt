[1] "Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."
[2] "Furthermore, promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides."
[3] "In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents."
[4] "In contrast, dehydrogenation catalysts are monofunctional, as the acidic function must be minimized to avoid side reactions."
[5] "On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry."
[6] "As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits."
[7] "However, the high temperature of both the regeneration process and the dehydrogenation reaction triggers the agglomeration or sintering of the platinum nanoparticles."
[8] "In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization."
[9] "High surface area alumina is the classical support employed in platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and its exceptional ability of maintaining the platinum nanoparticles dispersed, which is crucial to attain stable catalyst performance."
[10] "Indeed, by hydrothermally treating γ-Al2O3 prior to impregnation, the formation of additional hydroxyl groups results in a better Pt dispersion after impregnation and calcination."
[11] "SBA-15 (a mesoporous silica) was found to be an unsuitable support, as the PtSn nanoparticles readily sinter due to the weak metalsupport interaction."
[12] "Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory."
[13] "Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst."
[14] "Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."
[15] "From the geometric point of view, it has been suggested that isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and the formation of coke precursors can all be suppressed by reducing the size of platinum nanoparticles."
[16] "A secondary effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum."
[17] "Dumesic et al. performed a thorough adsorption microcalorimetry study and observed that the heat of ethylene and isobutene adsorption decreases with the addition of tin."
[18] "On the other hand, the addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the PtSn (111) surface, which suggests that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface."
[19] "Finally, as a proxy for catalyst stability, we have determined the deactivation rate (rd), for which we assume a first-order deactivation mechanism:"

The document compares noble metal-based catalysts, specifically focusing on platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, including chromium oxide, gallium oxide, indium oxide, vanadium oxide, zinc oxide, and molybdenum oxide. Platinum is extensively studied due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity towards CC cleavage. It is used in industrial alkane dehydrogenation technologies like the Pacol process (UOP) and Oleflex process. Metal oxides, particularly chromium oxide, have shown promise in dehydrogenation reactions, offering alternatives to pure metals. The effectiveness of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert light olefins efficiently. However, the document notes that while platinum catalysts exhibit high activity, they lack satisfactory selectivity and stability. Promoters, especially tin, are added to optimize catalyst performance by modifying the catalytic properties of platinum. These modifications aim to reduce unwanted side reactions, minimize metal sintering, neutralize support acidity, facilitate coke species diffusion, and improve electronic properties of the catalyst. The document also discusses the role of the support, highlighting the importance of alumina and other materials that maintain dispersion and stability of the active metal. Sintering and coke deposition are major factors affecting catalyst deactivation. The document provides data on specific activities and deactivation rates for various catalyst formulations, comparing their performance and longevity. Overall, the document emphasizes the ongoing research to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation processes.
