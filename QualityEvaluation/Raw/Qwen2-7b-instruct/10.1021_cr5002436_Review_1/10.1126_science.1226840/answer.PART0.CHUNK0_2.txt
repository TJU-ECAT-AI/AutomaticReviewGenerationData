[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."
[3] "New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensi- tive to common natural gas impurities are needed if we want to do better than cracking and reforming."

Today, conventional methods for converting natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liquid products involve steam cracking and steam reforming, which are costly processes requiring high operating pressures and temperatures. These methods face challenges in terms of heat transfer and managing solid carbon deposits (coking). There is a need for innovative low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are less sensitive to common natural gas impurities to improve the efficiency of natural gas utilization beyond current cracking and reforming techniques.

今天，将天然气转化为更高价值的化学中间体和液体产品通常采用蒸汽裂解和蒸汽重整等方法，这些过程成本高昂，需要高压和高温操作，并且在昂贵的反应器中存在热传递和焦炭管理的挑战。需要新的低温、高产率烷烃转换化学方法，这些方法对常见天然气杂质不敏感，以提高天然气利用效率，超越当前的裂解和重整技术。
