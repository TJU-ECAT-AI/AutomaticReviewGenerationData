[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "In steam crackers, the steam acts as a relatively unreactive diluent that favors fragmented radical formation and minimizes solid carbon (coke)."
[3] "New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensitive to common natural gas impurities are needed if we want to do better than cracking and reforming."

The document discusses the need for new process chemistries that can efficiently convert natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liquid products. It highlights the limitations of current methods such as cracking and reforming, which produce a mixture of products and require high temperatures and pressures. The document suggests that new low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries are needed to overcome these limitations and improve the efficiency of natural gas utilization.
