[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensi- tive to common natural gas impurities are needed if we want to do better than cracking and reforming."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liquid products is crucial for reducing dependence on oil and lowering shipping costs. To achieve this, new chemical processes are required that can operate at lower temperatures, yield higher output, and be insensitive to typical impurities in natural gas.

<quotes>
[1] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."
[2] "It would seem that between cracking for olefin production and reforming to make synthesis gas, all of the chemistry needed to make use of natural gas is already available."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Steam reforming is an expensive process due to the high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) required in reactors that also face challenges with heat transfer and managing coke buildup. It appears that the chemistry needed to utilize natural gas, including processes for olefin production and synthesis gas creation, might already be available through cracking and reforming methods.

蒸汽重整是一个昂贵的过程，因为它要求在昂贵的反应器中使用高操作压力和温度（15至40大气压，700至1000°C），同时面临着热传递和焦炭管理的挑战。似乎通过裂化和重整方法已经可以获得利用天然气所需的全部化学过程，包括生产烯烃和制造合成气。
