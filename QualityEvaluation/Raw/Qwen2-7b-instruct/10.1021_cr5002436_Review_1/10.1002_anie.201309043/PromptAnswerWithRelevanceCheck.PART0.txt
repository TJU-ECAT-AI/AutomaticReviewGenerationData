[1] "Pt-based catalysts are used for hydrocarbon transformations in diverse industrial applications."
[2] "There is also a renewed research interest in catalytic properties of Pt owing to multiple promising new applications, ranging from fuel cells1 to production of renewable transportation fuels and chemical feedstocks based on biomass conversion.2"
[3] "Acetylene impurities in ethylene feedstocks are unacceptable in polymerization and, therefore, are reduced to trace levels using selective hydrogenation over metal catalysts."
[4] "The transformation of acetylene, HCCH, into vinylidene, CCH2, on Pt and other catalytic metal surfaces has attracted significant attention because the chemistry of C2 hydrocarbons on Pt surfaces has historically served as a bridge between surface science and heterogeneous catalysis studies and because acetylene hydrogenation is an important industrial reaction."
[5] "Unlike a direct H shift along the CC bond in organometallic compounds, this mechanism has a geometric site requirement of three adjacent Pt atoms in the form of a three-fold site."
[6] "Catalytic metals, such as Pt, are often modified by adding a promoter, such as Sn, to enhance their performance."
[7] "Surfaces are shown with π-adsorbed acetylene on atop Pt sites."
[8] "Acetylene was dosed at 90K, and its transformations on the Pt-Sn surfaces upon annealing to 500K were monitored with high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS)."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts are widely utilized in various industrial processes, including the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum is known for its exceptional catalytic properties, offering high efficiency in reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and isomerization. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, consist of elements like chromium (Cr), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum, which are typically combined with oxygen to form oxides. These catalysts are effective in reactions like oxidation and reduction. Recent developments in the field have focused on the synthesis of custom-tailored catalysts, aiming to optimize their compositions for specific applications. Platinum-based catalysts often exhibit superior activity due to their unique electronic properties and ability to form stable intermediates during catalytic cycles. Metal oxides, especially those with high surface area, can provide enhanced selectivity and stability in harsh environments. The choice between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts depends on factors such as the desired reaction type, operating conditions, and cost-effectiveness.

Unlike a direct H shift along the CC bond in organometallic compounds, this mechanism has a geometric site requirement of three adjacent Pt atoms in the form of a three-fold site.
The same geometric site requirement is identified for preferential CH bond cleavage of acetylene with the formation of adsorbed CCH and H species.
In the absence of three-fold Pt sites, the reaction mechanism changes, and reactions of H transfer and CH bond cleavage are suppressed.
The presence of three-fold Pt sites reduces the energy barriers for both H transfer and CH cleavage reactions.

The document discusses the geometric requirements for hydrocarbon catalytic sites on platinum surfaces. It identifies that for the transformation of acetylene to vinylidene on Pt-Sn surfaces, a geometric site requirement of three adjacent Pt atoms is necessary. This contrasts with direct H shifts in organometallic compounds. Without three-fold Pt sites, the reaction mechanism changes, and reactions of H transfer and CH bond cleavage are suppressed. The presence of three-fold Pt sites reduces the energy barriers for both H transfer and CH cleavage reactions.

该文档讨论了铂表面上烃类催化位点的几何要求。它指出，在铂-锡表面上将乙炔转化为乙烯二烯基，需要三个相邻的铂原子作为三折位点的几何位点。这与有机金属化合物中的直接H转移形成对比。缺乏三折位点时，反应机制会改变，并且H转移和CH键断裂的反应被抑制。具有三折位点的铂的存在降低了H转移和CH断裂反应的能量壁垒。

The document discusses platinum (Pt) catalysts used in hydrocarbon transformations, particularly in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are effective in industrial applications such as fuel cells, production of renewable transportation fuels, and chemical feedstocks derived from biomass conversion. Platinum catalysts are crucial in selectively reducing acetylene impurities in ethylene feedstocks to trace levels through hydrogenation. Spectroscopic studies confirm that the transformation of acetylene to vinylidene (CCH2) is the first reaction on a Pt(111) surface. The document further elaborates on the role of platinum-silver (Pt-Sn) ordered surface alloys in the catalytic transformation of acetylene, highlighting the importance of geometric requirements for Pt catalytic sites. It mentions that without specific geometric configurations, such as three-fold Pt sites, the reaction mechanisms change, leading to suppression of H transfer and CH bond cleavage reactions. Experimental evidence supports these findings through high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments.
