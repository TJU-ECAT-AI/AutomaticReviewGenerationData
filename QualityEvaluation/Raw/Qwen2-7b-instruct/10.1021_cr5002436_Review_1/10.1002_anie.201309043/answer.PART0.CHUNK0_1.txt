Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts are widely utilized in various industrial processes, including the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum is known for its exceptional catalytic properties, offering high efficiency in reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and isomerization. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, consist of elements like chromium (Cr), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum, which are typically combined with oxygen to form oxides. These catalysts are effective in reactions like oxidation and reduction. Recent developments in the field have focused on the synthesis of custom-tailored catalysts, aiming to optimize their compositions for specific applications. Platinum-based catalysts often exhibit superior activity due to their unique electronic properties and ability to form stable intermediates during catalytic cycles. Metal oxides, especially those with high surface area, can provide enhanced selectivity and stability in harsh environments. The choice between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts depends on factors such as the desired reaction type, operating conditions, and cost-effectiveness.
