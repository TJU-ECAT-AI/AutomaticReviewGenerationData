Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, both are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metals like platinum are known for their effectiveness in various industrial applications related to hydrocarbon transformations. Metal oxides, on the other hand, provide an alternative approach to catalysis, often offering distinct advantages in terms of stability, cost, and scalability. Recent advancements in synthesis methods for custom-tailored platinum-silicon (Pt-Sn) and other platinum alloy surfaces enable precise control over both the composition and geometric arrangements of the elements, potentially unlocking new possibilities for rational design in the creation of more efficient and tailored catalysts.
