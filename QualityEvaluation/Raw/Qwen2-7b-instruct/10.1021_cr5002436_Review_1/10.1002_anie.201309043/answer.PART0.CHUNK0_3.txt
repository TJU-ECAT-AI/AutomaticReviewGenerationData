[1] "Pt-based catalysts are used for hydrocarbon transformations in diverse industrial applications."
[2] "There is also a renewed research interest in catalytic properties of Pt owing to multiple promising new applications, ranging from fuel cells1 to production of renewable transportation fuels and chemical feedstocks based on biomass conversion.2"
[3] "Acetylene impurities in ethylene feedstocks are unacceptable in polymerization and, therefore, are reduced to trace levels using selective hydrogenation over metal catalysts."
[4] "Furthermore, spectroscopic studies with isotope labeling have shown that the transformation into CCH2 is the first acetylene reaction on a Pt(111) surface."
[5] "Acetylene was dosed at 90K, and its transformations on the Pt-Sn surfaces upon annealing to 500K were monitored with high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS)."
[6] "Along with spectroscopic measurements, evolution of gas-phase products after acetylene adsorption was monitored by a quadrupole mass spectrometer in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments."
[7] "These TPD results, which are shown in FigureS1, provide further evidence that both the H transfer and CH cleavage reactions are suppressed in the absence of three-fold Pt sites on the Pt2Sn surface, in agreement with the computational results for the geometric requirements for Pt catalytic sites."

The document discusses platinum (Pt) catalysts used in hydrocarbon transformations, particularly in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are effective in industrial applications such as fuel cells, production of renewable transportation fuels, and chemical feedstocks derived from biomass conversion. Platinum catalysts are crucial in selectively reducing acetylene impurities in ethylene feedstocks to trace levels through hydrogenation. Spectroscopic studies confirm that the transformation of acetylene to vinylidene (CCH2) is the first reaction on a Pt(111) surface. The document further elaborates on the role of platinum-silver (Pt-Sn) ordered surface alloys in the catalytic transformation of acetylene, highlighting the importance of geometric requirements for Pt catalytic sites. It mentions that without specific geometric configurations, such as three-fold Pt sites, the reaction mechanisms change, leading to suppression of H transfer and CH bond cleavage reactions. Experimental evidence supports these findings through high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments.

文档讨论了铂（Pt）催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，特别是在乙烯原料中减少乙炔杂质到痕量水平。这些催化剂在燃料电池、可再生交通燃料和生物质转化衍生化学品的生产等工业应用中表现出色。铂催化剂对于选择性氢化乙炔杂质以达到痕量水平至关重要。光谱学研究证实，乙炔转化为乙烯二烯（CCH2）是Pt（111）表面的第一个反应。文档进一步阐述了铂银（Pt-Sn）有序表面合金在催化乙炔转化中的作用，强调了铂催化位点的几何要求的重要性。它指出，在缺少特定的几何配置，例如三折线Pt位点的情况下，反应机制会发生变化，导致H转移和CH键断裂反应被抑制。通过高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和温度程序脱附（TPD）实验的实验证据支持了这些发现。
