[1] "Pt-based catalysts are used for hydrocarbon transformations in diverse industrial applications."
[2] "There is also a renewed research interest in catalytic properties of Pt owing to multiple promising new applications, ranging from fuel cells1 to production of renewable transportation fuels and chemical feedstocks based on biomass conversion.2"
[3] "Acetylene impurities in ethylene feedstocks are unacceptable in polymerization and, therefore, are reduced to trace levels using selective hydrogenation over metal catalysts."
[4] "The transformation of acetylene, HCCH, into vinylidene, CCH2, on Pt and other catalytic metal surfaces has attracted significant attention because the chemistry of C2 hydrocarbons on Pt surfaces has historically served as a bridge between surface science and heterogeneous catalysis studies and because acetylene hydrogenation is an important industrial reaction."
[5] "Unlike a direct H shift along the CC bond in organometallic compounds, this mechanism has a geometric site requirement of three adjacent Pt atoms in the form of a three-fold site."
[6] "Catalytic metals, such as Pt, are often modified by adding a promoter, such as Sn, to enhance their performance."
[7] "Surfaces are shown with π-adsorbed acetylene on atop Pt sites."
[8] "Acetylene was dosed at 90K, and its transformations on the Pt-Sn surfaces upon annealing to 500K were monitored with high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS)."

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), in various industrial applications. These applications range from fuel cells, renewable transportation fuels, and chemical feedstock production based on biomass conversion. Platinum is known for its role in the transformation of acetylene into vinylidene, a process crucial for reducing acetylene impurities in ethylene feedstocks used in polymerization processes. The literature highlights the importance of catalysts in these applications and mentions the geometric requirements for effective catalytic sites on Pt surfaces. Additionally, the text explains that Pt catalysts are often modified by adding promoters like tin (Sn) to enhance their performance. The study also delves into the monitoring of acetylene transformations on Pt-Sn surfaces using high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS).
