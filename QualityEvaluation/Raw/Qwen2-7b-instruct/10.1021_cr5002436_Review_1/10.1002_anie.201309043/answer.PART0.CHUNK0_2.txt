Unlike a direct H shift along the CC bond in organometallic compounds, this mechanism has a geometric site requirement of three adjacent Pt atoms in the form of a three-fold site.
The same geometric site requirement is identified for preferential CH bond cleavage of acetylene with the formation of adsorbed CCH and H species.
In the absence of three-fold Pt sites, the reaction mechanism changes, and reactions of H transfer and CH bond cleavage are suppressed.
The presence of three-fold Pt sites reduces the energy barriers for both H transfer and CH cleavage reactions.

The document discusses the geometric requirements for hydrocarbon catalytic sites on platinum surfaces. It identifies that for the transformation of acetylene to vinylidene on Pt-Sn surfaces, a geometric site requirement of three adjacent Pt atoms is necessary. This contrasts with direct H shifts in organometallic compounds. Without three-fold Pt sites, the reaction mechanism changes, and reactions of H transfer and CH bond cleavage are suppressed. The presence of three-fold Pt sites reduces the energy barriers for both H transfer and CH cleavage reactions.

该文档讨论了铂表面上烃类催化位点的几何要求。它指出，在铂-锡表面上将乙炔转化为乙烯二烯基，需要三个相邻的铂原子作为三折位点的几何位点。这与有机金属化合物中的直接H转移形成对比。缺乏三折位点时，反应机制会改变，并且H转移和CH键断裂的反应被抑制。具有三折位点的铂的存在降低了H转移和CH断裂反应的能量壁垒。
