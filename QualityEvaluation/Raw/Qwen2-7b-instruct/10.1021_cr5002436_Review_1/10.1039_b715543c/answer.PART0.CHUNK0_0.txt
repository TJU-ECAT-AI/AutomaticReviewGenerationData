[1] "Until this study, high dehydrogenation rates and catalyst stability have required the concurrent presence of H2 (.200 kPa) and the use of promoters or stabilizers (e.g. Cl to enhance Pt dispersion,4 Sn to improve stability,5 and Li to neutralize support acid sites6)."
[2] "We previously reported that Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials,prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes.7 These materials, when used as catalysts for larger alkanes, gave significant isomerization selectivities,apparently because acidic OH groups form during reduction of exchanged Pt cations by H2."
[3] "Cs was chosen because it is less mobile than Na under hydrothermal conditions prevalent during drying or regeneration thermal treatments."
[4] "Heptene formation rates (compared per Pt, because dispersion were not reported in the earlier study12) on CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 were almost ten-fold higher than on PtSn/Al2O3ClLi catalysts12 at similar conditions (Table 2)."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum (Pt) and metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the Platinum-based catalysts show remarkable activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation processes. The Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, which incorporate Na and Cs cations, provide active and stable sites for the selective conversion of n-alkanes to n-alkenes. These materials demonstrate high selectivity and stability at lower hydrogen pressures compared to conventional catalysts, requiring only 7 kPa of hydrogen. 

The Pt clusters within the [Fe]ZSM-5 channels enable efficient dehydrogenation, while the Cs cation titrates the acid sites and inhibits skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions. The incorporation of Cs leads to higher selectivity for linear alkene formation, and the stability of the catalyst is significantly improved, with a first-order deactivation rate constant of 0.0030.006 h−1. 

The metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, might exhibit different properties depending on the specific metal and its oxidation state. For instance, CrOx catalysts could potentially offer high dehydrogenation rates due to the strong Lewis acidity provided by chromium. However, they might lack the stability and selectivity demonstrated by the Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials. Gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides might also show varying degrees of activity and stability, depending on the specific application and reaction conditions.

Recent developments in the field focus on enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalysts through the use of various strategies, including the incorporation of promoters, modifying support materials, and optimizing preparation methods. The Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials exemplify these advancements by achieving unprecedented rates and stability in dehydrogenation reactions, offering promising alternatives for the synthesis of useful linear alkenes from n-alkanes as feedstocks. The ability to operate at lower hydrogen pressures and maintain high selectivity and stability distinguishes these catalysts from others in the literature.

比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌、钼氧化物），在轻烯烃脱氢中显示出显著的活性和选择性。Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5材料，通过离子交换将Pt负载到Na[Fe]ZSM-5上，显示出了在C2-C4烷烃选择性脱氢中的前所未有的速率和稳定性。这些材料用作较大烷烃的催化剂时，提供了显著的异构化选择性，这似乎是因为在H2还原交换Pt离子时形成的酸性OH组分。

引入Cs离子可以抑制骨架异构化和裂解副反应，提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。与先前的研究相比，在相同条件下，CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5催化剂的庚烯形成速率比PtSn/Al2O3ClLi催化剂高约十倍。

金属氧化物催化剂的性能可能因特定金属及其氧化状态的不同而变化。例如，CrOx催化剂可能会由于铬提供的强路易斯酸性而表现出高的脱氢速率。然而，它们可能缺乏Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5材料所展现的稳定性和选择性。镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物也可能根据具体应用和反应条件展现出不同的活性和稳定性。

该领域的近期发展集中在通过各种策略增强催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性，包括使用促进剂、修改支撑材料和优化制备方法。Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5材料代表了这些进步的例子，它们在脱氢反应中实现了前所未有的速率和稳定性，为从烷烃作为原料合成有用的线性烯烃提供了有前景的替代方案。在较低氢压下运行并保持高选择性和稳定性是这些催化剂与文献中其他催化剂的区别之处。
