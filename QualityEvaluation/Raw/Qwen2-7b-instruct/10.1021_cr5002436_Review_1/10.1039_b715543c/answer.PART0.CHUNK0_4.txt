[1] "Until this study, high dehydrogenation rates and catalyst stability have required the concurrent presence of H2 (.200 kPa) and the use of promoters or stabilizers (e.g. Cl to enhance Pt dispersion, Sn to improve stability, and Li to neutralize support acid sites)."
[2] "We previously reported that Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."
[3] "These materials, when used as catalysts for larger alkanes, gave significant isomerization selectivities, apparently because acidic OH groups form during reduction of exchanged Pt cations by H2."
[4] "Cs and Na cations titrate acid sites and inhibit skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions."
[5] "Low deactivation rates (first-order deactivation rate constant: 0.0030.006 h−1) were achieved at much lower H2 pressures (7 kPa) than required in previous reports (.200 kPa) and even without H2."
[6] "Dehydrogenation rates were calculated from measured rates, by correcting for approach to equilibrium for each alkene isomer using thermodynamic data."
[7] "The selectivity to pentenes increased from 85% to 96% during this period and cracking selectivities concurrently decreased to y1%."
[8] "Pentene formation rates (corrected for approach to equilibrium) decreased from 5.7 mol (g-atom Pt)−1 s−1 (n-pentane conversion: 25%) to 1.5 mol (g-atom Pt)−1 s−1 (n-pentane conversion: 11%) over 140 h."
[9] "Deactivation was initially rapid (kd = 0.025 h−1), but became slower with time, with a first-order deactivation constant of 0.004 h−1 after 20 h."
[10] "These deactivation rates resemble those previously reported on Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 during C2C4 alkane dehydrogenation."
[11] "We have also examined the more demanding dehydrogenation of larger alkanes (n-heptane) on CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5."
[12] "Forward pentene formation rates and selectivities are shown in Fig. 1 on CsPt/Na [Fe]ZSM-5 at 673 K."
[13] "These dienes react quickly on acid sites via Diels-Alder type reactions to give aromatics and unsaturated organic residues and are quickly scavenged on catalysts containing acid sites."
[14] "Reaction rates were lower with n-heptane than with n-pentane in the linear region of the ratetime data shown in Fig. 1 and 2, apparently because of the faster initial deactivation observed for the larger alkanes at the high conversion and high diene concentrations prevalent during the initial contact of the catalyst with reactants."

The study focuses on the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The research highlights the effectiveness of Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, which show unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2-C4 alkanes. The catalysts achieve this stability without requiring the concurrent presence of hydrogen at high pressures, which is typically needed along with other promoters or stabilizers for enhanced performance. The introduction of Cs cations after reduction of Pt cations on the Na[Fe]ZSM-5 supports helps in maintaining the high selectivity for dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to linear n-alkenes. The catalysts demonstrate low deactivation rates, even at lower hydrogen pressures and without hydrogen, which is a significant improvement over previous catalysts. The study also examines the dehydrogenation of larger alkanes, such as n-heptane, and finds that the Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials maintain high selectivity for the formation of linear heptenes. The research suggests that the stability and selectivity of these catalysts could offer an effective route for the synthesis of useful linear alkenes from n-alkanes as feedstocks, extending the applicability of these materials beyond their initial use for dehydrogenation of lighter alkanes.

本研究关注在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂。研究表明，以铂/钠铁沸石-5材料为例，这些材料在选择性脱氢C2-C4烷烃时表现出前所未有的速率和稳定性。在不需要高氢压的情况下，即通常需要与增强铂分散性的氯、提高稳定性的锡或中和支持酸基团的锂等促进剂同时存在的条件下，该催化剂展现出稳定性。引入Cs离子后，通过氢还原交换到的铂离子，对Na[铁]沸石-5支持物有助于保持线性烷烃到线性烯烃的高选择性脱氢。催化剂甚至在较低的氢压力下（低于200千帕）和无需氢的情况下，也能实现低失活率。研究还探讨了对更大烷烃（n-庚烷）的脱氢，并发现这些铂/钠铁沸石-5材料仍能维持高线性庚烯的选择性形成。研究结果表明，这些催化剂的稳定性和选择性可能为从烷烃作为原料合成有用的线性烯烃提供有效途径，从而扩展了这些材料的应用范围，超越了其最初用于脱氢更轻烷烃的用途。
