[1] "Linear alkenes are essential intermediates in the synthesis of useful chemicals, such as lubricants1 and detergent-range alkyl- aromatics.2 Alkane dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and favored by high temperatures and low H2 pressures; these conditions lead, in turn, to cracking side reactions and fast deactivation, especially for larger alkanes."
[2] "Until this study, high dehydrogenation rates and catalyst stability have required the concurrent presence of H2 (.200 kPa) and the use of promoters or stabilizers (e.g. Cl to enhance Pt dispersion,4 Sn to improve stability,5 and Li to neutralize support acid sites6)."
[3] "We previously reported that Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials,prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes.7 These materials, when used as catalysts for larger alkanes, gave significant isomerization selectivities,apparently because acidic OH groups form during reduction of exchanged Pt cations by H2."
[4] "Cs was chosen because it is less mobile than Na under hydrothermal conditions prevalent during drying or regeneration thermal treatments."
[5] "The addition of small amounts of H2 (7 kPa) to n-heptane reactants decreased the prevalent concentration of heptadienes and improved catalyst stability."

This study presents a novel method for the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to n-alkenes using Pt clusters within [Fe]ZSM-5 channels. The use of Cs and Na cations titrates the acid sites, inhibiting skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions. This results in high selectivity for dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to linear n-alkenes, even at lower hydrogen pressures compared to previous methods. The catalyst demonstrates high rates, stability, and selectivity, particularly for larger alkanes, which were previously challenging due to fast deactivation under high temperature and low hydrogen pressure conditions. The introduction of small amounts of H2 further improves catalyst stability by decreasing the concentration of heptadienes, a by-product of the dehydrogenation process.

本研究介绍了一种新型的n-烷烃选择性催化脱氢为线性烯烃的方法，使用Fe-ZSM-5通道内的铂簇。通过Cs和Na离子调节酸基团，抑制骨架异构化和裂解副反应。这导致高选择性地将n-烷烃脱氢为线性n-烯烃，即使在比以往方法更低的氢气压力下也能实现。催化剂表现出高活性、稳定性和选择性，尤其是对于较大的烷烃，由于在高温和低氢气压力条件下快速失活，这些烷烃一直是挑战。引入少量氢气进一步提高了催化剂稳定性，减少了脱氢过程中产生的七碳二烯的浓度。
