[1] "Linear alkenes are essential intermediates in the synthesis of useful chemicals, such as lubricants1 and detergent-range alkyl- aromatics.2"
[2] "Pt clusters within [Fe]ZSM-5 channels provide active and stable sites for the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to n-alkenes."
[3] "Cs and Na cations titrate acid sites and inhibit skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions."
[4] "Until this study, high dehydrogenation rates and catalyst stability have required the concurrent presence of H2 (.200 kPa) and the use of promoters or stabilizers (e.g. Cl to enhance Pt dispersion,4 Sn to improve stability,5 and Li to neutralize support acid sites6)."
[5] "We previously reported that Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials,prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes.7 These materials, when used as catalysts for larger alkanes, gave significant isomerization selectivities,apparently because acidic OH groups form during reduction of exchanged Pt cations by H2."
[6] "Cs was chosen because it is less mobile than Na under hydrothermal conditions prevalent during drying or regeneration thermal treatments."
[7] "These CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 samples gave much higher selectivities to linear pentenes (96%) than Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%)."
[8] "Reaction rates were lower with n-heptane than with n-pentane in the linear region of the ratetime data shown in Fig. 1 and 2, apparently because of the faster initial deactivation observed for the larger alkanes at the high conversion and high diene concentrations prevalent during the initial contact of the catalyst with reactants."
[9] "Our study extends the applicability of these materials beyond their initial disclosure for dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."
[10] "In summary, we provide evidence here for the unique catalytic properties of Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 with residual acid sites titrated by Cs after reduction of exchanged Pt cations for the dehydrogena- tion of n-pentane and n-heptane."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the importance of Pt clusters within iron zeolite (Fe-ZSM-5) channels as active and stable sites for selective catalytic dehydrogenation. The presence of cations such as Cs and Na helps to titrate acid sites and inhibit unwanted side reactions like skeletal isomerization and cracking. The document contrasts these noble metal catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts, noting that the latter require additional components like H2, chlorine, tin, or lithium for high dehydrogenation rates and stability. Recent developments involve the use of Cs to titrate protons formed during the reduction of Pt cations, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability in the dehydrogenation process. The study demonstrates the extension of these materials' applicability beyond the initial disclosure for the dehydrogenation of shorter alkanes, specifically extending to larger alkanes like n-heptane. The document also mentions that the deactivation rate of the catalysts can be influenced by the concentration of polyunsaturated precursors, which are more prevalent in the dehydrogenation of larger alkanes.

本文讨论了贵金属催化剂，特别是铂（Pt），在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。强调了Fe-ZSM-5通道内Pt簇作为选择性催化脱氢活性和稳定的位点的重要性。Cs和Na等离子有助于酸基团的中和并抑制不希望的副反应，如骨架异构化和裂解。与基于金属氧化物的催化剂相比，后者需要额外的成分如H2、氯、锡或锂以获得高脱氢速率和稳定性。最近的研究涉及使用Cs来中和Pt离子还原过程中形成的质子，从而提高了n-戊烷和n-庚烷脱氢过程的选择性和稳定性。研究证明了这些材料的应用范围已扩展到初始披露之外，特别是扩展到了更长链的烷烃的脱氢，例如n-庚烷。文档还提到催化剂失活率可以受到多不饱和前体浓度的影响，而在脱氢过程中，这种浓度在较大的烷烃中更高。
