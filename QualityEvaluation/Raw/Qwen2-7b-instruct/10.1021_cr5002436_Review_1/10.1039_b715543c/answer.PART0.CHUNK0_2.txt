[1] "Until this study, high dehydrogenation rates and catalyst stability have required the concurrent presence of H2 (.200 kPa) and the use of promoters or stabilizers (e.g. Cl to enhance Pt dispersion, Sn to improve stability, and Li to neutralize support acid sites)."
[2] "We previously reported that Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."
[3] "Cs and Na cations titrate acid sites and inhibit skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions."
[4] "Low deactivation rates (first-order deactivation rate constant: 0.0030.006 h−1) were achieved at much lower H2 pressures (7 kPa) than required in previous reports (.200 kPa) and even without H2."
[5] "We have also examined the more demanding dehydrogenation of larger alkanes (n-heptane) on CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5."
[6] "These materials catalyze dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates and with very high selectivity to n-alkenes."
[7] "The catalyst stability is excellent in comparison with catalytic materials in previous reports, which required much higher H2 pressures for stable operation."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high activity and selectivity. These catalysts often require hydrogen (H2) and the presence of promoters or stabilizers for optimal performance, such as chlorine (Cl) to enhance Pt dispersion, tin (Sn) to improve stability, and lithium (Li) to neutralize support acid sites. However, the study highlights the development of Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials that demonstrate unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes, achieving low deactivation rates at much lower H2 pressures (7 kPa) compared to previous reports (typically .200 kPa). These materials are capable of catalyzing the dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates and high selectivity for n-alkenes, maintaining excellent stability without the need for high H2 pressures or additional stabilizers. The use of cesium (Cs) cations in the preparation process further enhances the selectivity for linear alkene production and improves catalyst stability.

贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢反应，因其高活性和选择性而被使用。这些催化剂通常需要氢（H2）和助剂或稳定剂以达到最佳性能，例如氯（Cl）用于增强铂分散性，锡（Sn）用于改善稳定性，锂（Li）用于中和支持酸位点。然而，这项研究强调了Na[Fe]ZSM-5上负载铂（Pt）材料的发展，在选择性脱氢C2C4烷烃时展现出前所未有的速率和稳定性。在比以往报告低得多的氢气压力（7 kPa）下，这些材料能够以极低的失活率催化更大烷烃的脱氢反应，并且具有极高的线性烯烃选择性，甚至无需氢气。这些材料能够以前所未有的速率和高选择性催化更大烷烃脱氢成线性烯烃，并保持出色的稳定性，而不需要高氢气压力或其他稳定剂。制备过程中加入铯（Cs）离子进一步提高了线性烯烃产率的选择性和催化剂稳定性。
