[1] "Until this study, high dehydrogenation rates and catalyst stability have required the concurrent presence of H2 (.200 kPa) and the use of promoters or stabilizers (e.g. Cl to enhance Pt dispersion,4 Sn to improve stability,5 and Li to neutralize support acid sites6)."
[2] "We previously reported that Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials,prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes.7 These materials, when used as catalysts for larger alkanes, gave significant isomerization selectivities,apparently because acidic OH groups form during reduction of exchanged Pt cations by H2."
[3] "Cs was chosen because it is less mobile than Na under hydrothermal conditions prevalent during drying or regeneration thermal treatments."
[4] "Heptene formation rates (compared per Pt, because dispersion were not reported in the earlier study12) on CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 were almost ten-fold higher than on PtSn/Al2O3ClLi catalysts12 at similar conditions (Table 2)."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum (Pt) and metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the Platinum-based catalysts show remarkable activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation processes. The Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, which incorporate Na and Cs cations, provide active and stable sites for the selective conversion of n-alkanes to n-alkenes. These materials demonstrate high selectivity and stability at lower hydrogen pressures compared to conventional catalysts, requiring only 7 kPa of hydrogen. 

The Pt clusters within the [Fe]ZSM-5 channels enable efficient dehydrogenation, while the Cs cation titrates the acid sites and inhibits skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions. The incorporation of Cs leads to higher selectivity for linear alkene formation, and the stability of the catalyst is significantly improved, with a first-order deactivation rate constant of 0.0030.006 h−1. 

The metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, might exhibit different properties depending on the specific metal and its oxidation state. For instance, CrOx catalysts could potentially offer high dehydrogenation rates due to the strong Lewis acidity provided by chromium. However, they might lack the stability and selectivity demonstrated by the Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials. Gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides might also show varying degrees of activity and stability, depending on the specific application and reaction conditions.

Recent developments in the field focus on enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalysts through the use of various strategies, including the incorporation of promoters, modifying support materials, and optimizing preparation methods. The Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials exemplify these advancements by achieving unprecedented rates and stability in dehydrogenation reactions, offering promising alternatives for the synthesis of useful linear alkenes from n-alkanes as feedstocks. The ability to operate at lower hydrogen pressures and maintain high selectivity and stability distinguishes these catalysts from others in the literature.

比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌、钼氧化物），在轻烯烃脱氢中显示出显著的活性和选择性。Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5材料，通过离子交换将Pt负载到Na[Fe]ZSM-5上，显示出了在C2-C4烷烃选择性脱氢中的前所未有的速率和稳定性。这些材料用作较大烷烃的催化剂时，提供了显著的异构化选择性，这似乎是因为在H2还原交换Pt离子时形成的酸性OH组分。

引入Cs离子可以抑制骨架异构化和裂解副反应，提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。与先前的研究相比，在相同条件下，CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5催化剂的庚烯形成速率比PtSn/Al2O3ClLi催化剂高约十倍。

金属氧化物催化剂的性能可能因特定金属及其氧化状态的不同而变化。例如，CrOx催化剂可能会由于铬提供的强路易斯酸性而表现出高的脱氢速率。然而，它们可能缺乏Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5材料所展现的稳定性和选择性。镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物也可能根据具体应用和反应条件展现出不同的活性和稳定性。

该领域的近期发展集中在通过各种策略增强催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性，包括使用促进剂、修改支撑材料和优化制备方法。Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5材料代表了这些进步的例子，它们在脱氢反应中实现了前所未有的速率和稳定性，为从烷烃作为原料合成有用的线性烯烃提供了有前景的替代方案。在较低氢压下运行并保持高选择性和稳定性是这些催化剂与文献中其他催化剂的区别之处。

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the importance of Pt clusters within iron zeolite (Fe-ZSM-5) channels as active and stable sites for selective catalytic dehydrogenation. The presence of cations such as Cs and Na helps to titrate acid sites and inhibit unwanted side reactions like skeletal isomerization and cracking. The document contrasts these noble metal catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts, noting that the latter require additional components like H2, chlorine, tin, or lithium for high dehydrogenation rates and stability. Recent developments involve the use of Cs to titrate protons formed during the reduction of Pt cations, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability in the dehydrogenation process. The study demonstrates the extension of these materials' applicability beyond the initial disclosure for the dehydrogenation of shorter alkanes, specifically extending to larger alkanes like n-heptane. The document also mentions that the deactivation rate of the catalysts can be influenced by the concentration of polyunsaturated precursors, which are more prevalent in the dehydrogenation of larger alkanes.

本文讨论了贵金属催化剂，特别是铂（Pt），在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。强调了Fe-ZSM-5通道内Pt簇作为选择性催化脱氢活性和稳定的位点的重要性。Cs和Na等离子有助于酸基团的中和并抑制不希望的副反应，如骨架异构化和裂解。与基于金属氧化物的催化剂相比，后者需要额外的成分如H2、氯、锡或锂以获得高脱氢速率和稳定性。最近的研究涉及使用Cs来中和Pt离子还原过程中形成的质子，从而提高了n-戊烷和n-庚烷脱氢过程的选择性和稳定性。研究证明了这些材料的应用范围已扩展到初始披露之外，特别是扩展到了更长链的烷烃的脱氢，例如n-庚烷。文档还提到催化剂失活率可以受到多不饱和前体浓度的影响，而在脱氢过程中，这种浓度在较大的烷烃中更高。

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high activity and selectivity. These catalysts often require hydrogen (H2) and the presence of promoters or stabilizers for optimal performance, such as chlorine (Cl) to enhance Pt dispersion, tin (Sn) to improve stability, and lithium (Li) to neutralize support acid sites. However, the study highlights the development of Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials that demonstrate unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes, achieving low deactivation rates at much lower H2 pressures (7 kPa) compared to previous reports (typically .200 kPa). These materials are capable of catalyzing the dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates and high selectivity for n-alkenes, maintaining excellent stability without the need for high H2 pressures or additional stabilizers. The use of cesium (Cs) cations in the preparation process further enhances the selectivity for linear alkene production and improves catalyst stability.

贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢反应，因其高活性和选择性而被使用。这些催化剂通常需要氢（H2）和助剂或稳定剂以达到最佳性能，例如氯（Cl）用于增强铂分散性，锡（Sn）用于改善稳定性，锂（Li）用于中和支持酸位点。然而，这项研究强调了Na[Fe]ZSM-5上负载铂（Pt）材料的发展，在选择性脱氢C2C4烷烃时展现出前所未有的速率和稳定性。在比以往报告低得多的氢气压力（7 kPa）下，这些材料能够以极低的失活率催化更大烷烃的脱氢反应，并且具有极高的线性烯烃选择性，甚至无需氢气。这些材料能够以前所未有的速率和高选择性催化更大烷烃脱氢成线性烯烃，并保持出色的稳定性，而不需要高氢气压力或其他稳定剂。制备过程中加入铯（Cs）离子进一步提高了线性烯烃产率的选择性和催化剂稳定性。

This study presents a novel method for the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to n-alkenes using Pt clusters within [Fe]ZSM-5 channels. The use of Cs and Na cations titrates the acid sites, inhibiting skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions. This results in high selectivity for dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to linear n-alkenes, even at lower hydrogen pressures compared to previous methods. The catalyst demonstrates high rates, stability, and selectivity, particularly for larger alkanes, which were previously challenging due to fast deactivation under high temperature and low hydrogen pressure conditions. The introduction of small amounts of H2 further improves catalyst stability by decreasing the concentration of heptadienes, a by-product of the dehydrogenation process.

The study focuses on the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The research highlights the effectiveness of Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, which show unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2-C4 alkanes. The catalysts achieve this stability without requiring the concurrent presence of hydrogen at high pressures, which is typically needed along with other promoters or stabilizers for enhanced performance. The introduction of Cs cations after reduction of Pt cations on the Na[Fe]ZSM-5 supports helps in maintaining the high selectivity for dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to linear n-alkenes. The catalysts demonstrate low deactivation rates, even at lower hydrogen pressures and without hydrogen, which is a significant improvement over previous catalysts. The study also examines the dehydrogenation of larger alkanes, such as n-heptane, and finds that the Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials maintain high selectivity for the formation of linear heptenes. The research suggests that the stability and selectivity of these catalysts could offer an effective route for the synthesis of useful linear alkenes from n-alkanes as feedstocks, extending the applicability of these materials beyond their initial use for dehydrogenation of lighter alkanes.
