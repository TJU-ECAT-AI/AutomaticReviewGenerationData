          [1] "A detailed study of the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over Al2O3- and Mg Al O-supported Pt Sn catalysts was reported."
          [2] "The strong acidic sites in the alumina-supported catalysts favored the formation of aromatics and low selectivities for mono-olefins."
          [3] "Adding Mg to the sup-ports achieved the following: (i) moderated the total acidity of the catalysts, weakening the strong acidic sites; (ii) increased the interaction between the Pt and the supports, weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the Pt surface and Pt C bond strength to promote the desorption of the dehydrogenation products; (iii) increased the total pore volume and pore size diameter; (iv) decreased both the specific surface area of the supports and the Pt dispersion on the catalysts."
          [4] "The catalysts with added Mg inhibited the side reactions and enhanced both the mono-olefin selectivity and the yield while suppressing the dehydrogenation activity."
          [5] "When the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3, the optimal n-dodecene yield could be obtained."
          [6] "The coke deposition over the catalysts can increase the selectivity of the catalysts."
          [7] "The on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology is a proven and effective method that can be applied in situ during high temperature reactions for detecting the products over the catalysts rapidly and continuously."

          A comprehensive study was conducted on the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over catalysts supported by aluminum oxide and magnesium-aluminum oxide, incorporating platinum and tin metals. An innovative real-time TOF-MS monitoring technique was introduced for analyzing the products directly over these catalysts. Strong acidic sites in aluminum oxide-based catalysts promoted the formation of aromatics and reduced mono-olefin selectivity. By adding magnesium to the supports, the total acidity of the catalysts was reduced, particularly the strong acidic sites. This led to increased interaction between platinum and the supports, weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the platinum surface and the strength of the Pt-C bond, facilitating the release of dehydrogenation products. Magnesium incorporation resulted in an increase in the total pore volume and pore size diameter, and a decrease in the specific surface area of the supports, as well as a reduction in platinum dispersion on the catalysts. Catalysts with added magnesium suppressed side reactions, enhanced mono-olefin selectivity and yield, and diminished dehydrogenation activity. Achieving a magnesium-to-aluminum molar ratio of 1/3 yielded the optimal n-dodecene output. The deposition of coke on catalysts can boost the selectivity of the catalysts. Real-time TOF-MS monitoring technology is a validated and efficient method for detecting products during high temperature reactions in situ, offering rapid and continuous detection capabilities.

          对n-十二烷的脱氢作用进行了全面研究，使用了铝氧化物和镁铝氧化物支持的铂锡催化剂。引入了一种实时TOF-MS监测技术，用于直接分析这些催化剂上的产品。铝氧化物基催化剂中的强酸性位点促进了芳香化合物的形成并降低了单烯烃选择性。通过添加镁到支持物中，可以降低催化剂的总酸度，特别是强酸性位点。这导致铂与支持物之间增强的相互作用，减弱了n-十二烷在铂表面的吸附以及Pt-C键的强度，从而促进脱氢产物的释放。添加镁后，总孔体积和孔径直径增加，支持物的比表面积下降，并且铂在催化剂上的分散度减少。添加镁的催化剂抑制了副反应，提高了单烯烃选择性和产率，并减少了脱氢活性。当镁与铝的摩尔比为1/3时，可以获得最佳的n-十二碳烯产量。催化剂上的焦炭沉积可以提高催化剂的选择性。实时TOF-MS监测技术是一种在高温反应中直接检测催化剂上产品的有效和高效方法，提供快速和连续的检测能力。

          [1] "Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins involves examining their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages."
          [2] "Noble metal-based catalysts, like Platinum, are known for their high reactivity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes. They are often used due to their ability to efficiently convert light olefins into lighter hydrocarbons."
          [3] "Metal oxide-based catalysts offer a more affordable alternative. They are often used to modulate the acidity and porosity of the catalyst, which can affect the dehydrogenation rates and product selectivity."
          [4] "By adding metals like Cr, Ga, In, V, Zn, or Mo to these oxides, the catalysts can be optimized for specific reactions."
          [5] "In the context of the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane, the addition of magnesium oxide to the supports showed several benefits. It helped in moderating the total acidity of the catalysts, reducing the formation of aromatics and enhancing the mono-olefin selectivity. This resulted in improved yields and catalyst stability, with the optimal n-dodecene yield achieved when the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3. The magnesium addition also suppressed deep dehydrogenation, leading to lower coke formation and improved selectivity."
          [6] "The use of on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology proved to be an effective method for analyzing products over catalysts in situ during high-temperature reactions. It offered rapid and continuous detection of changes in reaction products, which can significantly enhance the understanding and optimization of the dehydrogenation process."
