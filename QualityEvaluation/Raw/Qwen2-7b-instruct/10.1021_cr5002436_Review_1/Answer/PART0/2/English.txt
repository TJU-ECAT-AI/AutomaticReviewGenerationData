Noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, are extensively used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high activity and selectivity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are also applied in this process, offering potentially lower costs and improved thermal stability compared to noble metals. Recent advancements aim to improve the stability and selectivity of both types of catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts are known for their exceptional performance in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation process. Metal oxide catalysts are economically attractive alternatives, providing robustness against high temperatures. These catalysts play a pivotal role in the petrochemical industry for the conversion of light olefins into valuable chemical intermediates.

The comparison of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins highlights their differences in composition, effectiveness, and industrial applications. Platinum-based catalysts are recognized for their high reactivity and selectivity in such reactions, making them suitable for various industrial uses. Metal oxides, on the other hand, are favored for their cost-effectiveness and stability, and recent advancements have involved integrating noble metals onto metal oxide supports to improve catalyst performance. Comparative analysis indicates that noble metal-based catalysts typically provide higher conversion efficiency, albeit requiring more stringent operational conditions. Conversely, metal oxide-based catalysts are more forgiving towards impurities and demonstrate better thermal stability.

Noble metal-based catalysts, like Platinum, are known for their high reactivity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes. They are often used due to their ability to efficiently convert light olefins into lighter hydrocarbons. Metal oxide-based catalysts offer a more affordable alternative. They are often used to modulate the acidity and porosity of the catalyst, which can affect the dehydrogenation rates and product selectivity. By adding metals like Cr, Ga, In, V, Zn, or Mo to these oxides, the catalysts can be optimized for specific reactions. In the context of the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane, the addition of magnesium oxide to the supports showed several benefits. It helped in moderating the total acidity of the catalysts, reducing the formation of aromatics and enhancing the mono-olefin selectivity. This resulted in improved yields and catalyst stability, with the optimal n-dodecene yield achieved when the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3. The magnesium addition also suppressed deep dehydrogenation, leading to lower coke formation and improved selectivity. The use of online TOF-MS monitoring technology proved to be an effective method for analyzing products over catalysts in situ during high-temperature reactions. It offered rapid and continuous detection of changes in reaction products, which can significantly enhance the understanding and optimization of the dehydrogenation process.

The method used for impregnation significantly affects the interaction between platinum and tin (PtSn) and the fraction of platinum that remains unalloyed after calcination and reduction. Co-impregnation methods outperform the sequential method. Adding tin (Sn) notably enhances the catalytic behavior of Pt/SiO2 catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation under severe deactivating conditions.

The study focused on comparing the catalytic performance of PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. It was found that the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst exhibited stronger resistance to catalytic deactivation compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. This enhanced stability is attributed to the faster movement of coke from the metal surface to the support, as evidenced by TGA measurements. The stability of the PtSn catalysts is influenced by the formation and transition of different PtSn alloy phases, leading to differences in coke mobility. The amount of coke generated during the reaction was quantified using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As the time on stream (TOS) increased, the coke content naturally increased on both catalysts. In the first cycle, the initial conversion over PtSn/Al was 54.9% and the final conversion was 34.6%, whereas over PtSn/ZnAlO, the initial conversion was 59.1% and the final conversion was 48.1%. These findings indicate that the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst offers improved stability and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

A new method is outlined for creating PtGa bimetallic particles on a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O support for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes. Gallium (Ga), introduced via transfer from a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material, modifies the Pt particles. Starting from an organometallic precursor, Pt nanoparticles are dispersed on the support, followed by reduction. Upon high-temperature reduction at 773873 K, PtGa alloys are observed. It is theorized that hydrogen atoms produced on the metal particle surface migrate to the support, reducing Ga3+ ions to atomic Ga. This atomic Ga then interacts with the supported Pt, forming PtGa alloys.
