Strong acidic sites in aluminum oxide-based catalysts promoted the formation of aromatics and reduced mono-olefin selectivity. By adding magnesium to the supports, the total acidity of the catalysts was reduced, particularly the strong acidic sites. This led to increased interaction between platinum and the supports, weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the platinum surface and the strength of the Pt-C bond, facilitating the release of dehydrogenation products.
