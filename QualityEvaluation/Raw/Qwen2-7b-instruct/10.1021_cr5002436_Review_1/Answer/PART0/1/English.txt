The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, are highly effective for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, showing high selectivity and activity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been utilized, although they generally exhibit lower stability and activity, especially under harsh conditions. Recent advancements in synthesis techniques have improved the performance of metal oxide catalysts. Industrial applications of these catalysts are widespread in petrochemical industries for producing ethylene and propylene. Noble metal-based catalysts offer higher efficiency and longer operational life, while metal oxide catalysts are cost-effective and use less toxic materials.

The comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals their distinct characteristics. Noble metals are distinguished by their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, making them suitable for various industrial applications. Metal oxides, however, are valued for their robustness and resistance to poisoning under harsh conditions. Recent advancements in catalyst design aim to enhance stability, activity, and selectivity, leading to more efficient catalysts. Comparatively, noble metal-based catalysts tend to offer higher efficiency and better selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts demonstrate greater stability and reduced susceptibility to deactivation.

A comprehensive study was conducted on the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over catalysts supported by aluminum oxide and magnesium-aluminum oxide, incorporating platinum and tin metals. An innovative real-time TOF-MS monitoring technique was introduced for analyzing the products directly over these catalysts. Strong acidic sites in aluminum oxide-based catalysts promoted the formation of aromatics and reduced mono-olefin selectivity. By adding magnesium to the supports, the total acidity of the catalysts was reduced, particularly the strong acidic sites. This led to increased interaction between platinum and the supports, weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the platinum surface and the strength of the Pt-C bond, facilitating the release of dehydrogenation products. Magnesium incorporation resulted in an increase in the total pore volume and pore size diameter, and a decrease in the specific surface area of the supports, as well as a reduction in platinum dispersion on the catalysts. Catalysts with added magnesium suppressed side reactions, enhanced mono-olefin selectivity and yield, and diminished dehydrogenation activity. Achieving a magnesium-to-aluminum molar ratio of 1/3 yielded the optimal n-dodecene output. The deposition of coke on catalysts can boost the selectivity of the catalysts. Real-time TOF-MS monitoring technology is a validated and efficient method for detecting products during high temperature reactions in situ, offering rapid and continuous detection capabilities.

The promoting effect of tin (Sn) in platinum-based catalysts largely depends on the preparation method. Sequential impregnation leads to a significant portion of unalloyed platinum. High-temperature air treatments after reduction negatively impact the catalytic properties of PtSn samples. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) adsorption is minimal on platinum-tin alloys.

The presence of Zinc (Zn) in noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), enhances their selectivity in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. When Zn is integrated into the silica matrix of MCM-41 spheres, it generates structural centers that are more stable under reduction treatments and exhibit a higher polarizing/activation capacity towards molecules containing a carbonyl double bond. This results in improved catalytic activity and selectivity for crotyl alcohol production compared to conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalysts. Additionally, these Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts demonstrate exceptional performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving a high selectivity of 100% that remains stable over time.

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts exhibit high stability and selectivity towards olefin production. Metal oxide catalysts contribute to enhancing stability and selectivity when combined with Platinum. Zinc aluminate supports are favored due to their neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength. The role of tin in modifying the electronic and geometric properties of Platinum is recognized, and its addition to Platinum catalyst systems positively impacts stability and selectivity towards olefins. Zinc oxide modifies the dispersion and interaction between the metal and support in Platinum-silver catalysts, leading to improved stability and selectivity. In zinc-doped Platinum-silver catalysts, high selectivity and minimal activity loss are achieved in propane dehydrogenation due to the interaction between Platinum and Zinc. Characterization techniques are employed to elucidate the active phases in Platinum-silver catalysts, as their catalytic performance critically depends on the bimetallic Platinum-silver phases. The behavior of Platinum-silver alloy phases is observed during reactions over both catalysts, with distinct influences from Aluminum oxide and zinc aluminum oxide supports on these phases. Different Platinum-silver alloy phases result in varying coke mobility across catalysts, ultimately affecting catalyst stability.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the key differences lie in their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. Noble metals, notably Platinum, are renowned for their high activity and selectivity in this process. On the other hand, metal oxides such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides offer stability and lower costs. These catalysts find extensive use in petrochemical industries for the production of olefins from hydrocarbons. Recent advancements focus on improving catalyst performance, often involving modifications to noble metals or the incorporation of co-catalysts. Noble metals provide superior activity and selectivity, yet they may come with higher costs and risk of deactivation. Metal oxides, while ensuring better stability and potentially lower costs, might fall short in achieving the high activity levels of noble metals.
