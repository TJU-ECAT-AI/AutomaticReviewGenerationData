[1] "Recent increases in demand of light olefins for the production of polymers and gasoline additives such as MTBE have increased the interest in lower alkane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The conditions best suited for this reaction, high temperatures, low pressures, and low hydrogen concentrations, favor rapid deactivation due to coke formation on the catalyst."
          [3] "Promoters like tin (Sn) enhance the catalytic ability of noble metal-based catalysts like platinum (Pt) by forming alloys with them."
          [4] "Even though Sn is one of the most efficient promoters employed in commercial processes, deactivation due to coke formation is not completely eliminated and the catalysts still exhibit short lifetimes and must undergo continuous or frequent regenerations to maintain activity."
