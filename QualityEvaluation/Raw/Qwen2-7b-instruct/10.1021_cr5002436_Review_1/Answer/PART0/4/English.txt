Increased demand for light olefins for polymer production and gasoline additives such as MTBE has sparked interest in lower alkane dehydrogenation. Conditions optimal for this reaction, involving high temperatures, low pressures, and low hydrogen concentrations, promote rapid deactivation due to coke formation on the catalyst. Promoters like tin (Sn) improve the catalytic ability of noble metal-based catalysts like platinum (Pt) through alloy formation. Although Sn is highly effective in commercial processes, deactivation due to coke formation is not fully mitigated, and catalysts have short lifetimes requiring continuous or frequent regeneration to maintain activity.
