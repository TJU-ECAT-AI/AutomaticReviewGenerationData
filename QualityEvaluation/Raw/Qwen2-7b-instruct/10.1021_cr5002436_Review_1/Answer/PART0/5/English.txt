Chromium oxide (CrOx) catalysts are renowned for their resilience and capability to efficiently transform light olefins into lighter hydrocarbons. Gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides have been investigated for their potential to enhance dehydrogenation efficiency, providing alternative methods for olefin production. Studies indicate the promise of these materials in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, showcasing favorable outcomes in terms of yield and selectivity. However, despite their benefits, metal oxide catalysts may display lower activity and selectivity compared to noble metals, requiring further research to refine their performance.
