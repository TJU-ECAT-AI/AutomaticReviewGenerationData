          [1] "The promoting effect of Sn strongly depends on the method employed in the preparation."
          [2] "Sequential impregnation results in a large fraction of unalloyed Pt."
          [3] "High-temperature treatments in air of previously reduced PtSn samples are detrimental for the catalytic properties."

          The promoting effect of tin (Sn) in platinum-based catalysts largely depends on the preparation method. Sequential impregnation leads to a significant portion of unalloyed platinum. High-temperature air treatments after reduction negatively impact the catalytic properties of PtSn samples. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) adsorption is minimal on platinum-tin alloys.

          [1] "Recent increases in demand of light olefins for the production of polymers and gasoline additives such as MTBE have increased the interest in lower alkane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The conditions best suited for this reaction, high temperatures, low pressures, and low hydrogen concentrations, favor rapid deactivation due to coke formation on the catalyst."
          [3] "Promoters like tin (Sn) enhance the catalytic ability of noble metal-based catalysts like platinum (Pt) by forming alloys with them."
          [4] "Even though Sn is one of the most efficient promoters employed in commercial processes, deactivation due to coke formation is not completely eliminated and the catalysts still exhibit short lifetimes and must undergo continuous or frequent regenerations to maintain activity."

          Increased demand for light olefins for polymer production and gasoline additives such as MTBE has sparked interest in lower alkane dehydrogenation. Conditions optimal for this reaction, involving high temperatures, low pressures, and low hydrogen concentrations, promote rapid deactivation due to coke formation on the catalyst. Promoters like tin (Sn) improve the catalytic ability of noble metal-based catalysts like platinum (Pt) through alloy formation. Although Sn is highly effective in commercial processes, deactivation due to coke formation is not fully mitigated, and catalysts have short lifetimes requiring continuous or frequent regeneration to maintain activity.
