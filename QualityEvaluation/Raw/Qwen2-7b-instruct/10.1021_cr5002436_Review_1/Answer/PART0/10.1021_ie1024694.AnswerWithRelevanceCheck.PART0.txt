          The comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals their distinct characteristics. Noble metals are distinguished by their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, making them suitable for various industrial applications. Metal oxides, however, are valued for their robustness and resistance to poisoning under harsh conditions. Recent advancements in catalyst design aim to enhance stability, activity, and selectivity, leading to more efficient catalysts. Comparatively, noble metal-based catalysts tend to offer higher efficiency and better selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts demonstrate greater stability and reduced susceptibility to deactivation.
