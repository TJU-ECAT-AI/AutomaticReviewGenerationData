        The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, are highly effective for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, showing high selectivity and activity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been utilized, although they generally exhibit lower stability and activity, especially under harsh conditions. Recent advancements in synthesis techniques have improved the performance of metal oxide catalysts. Industrial applications of these catalysts are widespread in petrochemical industries for producing ethylene and propylene. Noble metal-based catalysts offer higher efficiency and longer operational life, while metal oxide catalysts are cost-effective and use less toxic materials.

        The comparative analysis of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins highlights their distinct characteristics and performance in terms of composition, effectiveness, and industrial applications. While noble metal-based catalysts, notably platinum, are characterized by their high activity and selectivity, metal oxide catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer robustness and resistance to poisoning under harsh reaction conditions. Advances in catalyst design have led to improvements in stability, activity, and selectivity for metal oxide catalysts, making them more efficient.

        Future research might focus on exploring new synthesis methods for noble metals and metal oxides, optimizing their compositions for better performance, and developing innovative methodologies that leverage the unique properties of these catalysts. There is potential for further enhancements in catalyst efficiency, selectivity, and stability, which could lead to more sustainable and economically viable processes in petrochemical industries.

        Metal oxide catalysts offer cost-effectiveness and the possibility of using less toxic materials compared to noble metals, making them an attractive alternative for certain applications. However, they may lack the high activity and selectivity of noble metals. The integration of co-catalysts or the development of novel support materials could potentially bridge this gap, enhancing the performance of metal oxide catalysts.

        The study of the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over catalysts supported by aluminum oxide and magnesium-aluminum oxide, incorporating platinum and tin metals, reveals the complex interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and product selectivity. The addition of magnesium to the supports can modulate the total acidity, weaken the strong acidic sites, and promote more efficient dehydrogenation processes.

        The presence of zinc in noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, enhances their selectivity in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. Zinc oxide modifies the dispersion and interaction between the metal and support in Platinum-silver catalysts, leading to improved stability and selectivity. In zinc-doped Platinum-silver catalysts, high selectivity and minimal activity loss are achieved in propane dehydrogenation due to the interaction between Platinum and Zinc.

        The demand for propylene worldwide is growing faster than ethylene, causing a shortfall in propylene supply from steam cracking. The role of tin in modifying the electronic and geometric properties of Platinum is recognized, and its addition to Platinum catalyst systems positively impacts stability and selectivity towards olefins. Zinc aluminate supports are favored due to their neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength.

        Various characterization techniques have been applied to understand the active phases in Platinum-silver catalysts, as their catalytic performance critically depends on the bimetallic Platinum-silver phases. The behavior of Platinum-silver alloy phases is observed during reactions over both catalysts, with distinct influences from Aluminum oxide and zinc aluminum oxide supports on these phases. Different Platinum-silver alloy phases result in varying coke mobility across catalysts, ultimately affecting catalyst stability.

        In summary, the comparative analysis underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate catalyst based on the specific requirements of the dehydrogenation process, considering factors such as cost, efficiency, and environmental impact. The continuous development of catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions will likely play a crucial role in advancing the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.
