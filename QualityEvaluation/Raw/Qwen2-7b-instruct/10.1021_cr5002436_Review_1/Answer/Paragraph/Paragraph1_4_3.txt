        Comparative analysis of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals their distinct characteristics. Noble metals, notably platinum, are distinguished by their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, making them suitable for various industrial applications. Metal oxides, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are valued for their robustness and resistance to poisoning under harsh conditions. Recent advancements in catalyst design aim to enhance stability, activity, and selectivity, leading to more efficient catalysts. Comparatively, noble metal-based catalysts tend to offer higher efficiency and better selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts demonstrate greater stability and reduced susceptibility to deactivation. Industrial applications of these catalysts are widespread in petrochemical industries for producing ethylene and propylene. Potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include higher efficiency and longer operational life, while metal oxide catalysts are cost-effective and use less toxic materials.
