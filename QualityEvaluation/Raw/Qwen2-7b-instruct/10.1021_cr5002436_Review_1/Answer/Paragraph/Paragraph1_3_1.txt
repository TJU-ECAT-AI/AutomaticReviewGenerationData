        The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, are highly effective for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, showing high selectivity and activity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been utilized, although they generally exhibit lower stability and activity, especially under harsh conditions. Recent advancements in synthesis techniques have improved the performance of metal oxide catalysts. Industrial applications of these catalysts are widespread in petrochemical industries for producing ethylene and propylene. Noble metal-based catalysts offer higher efficiency and longer operational life, while metal oxide catalysts are cost-effective and use less toxic materials. Comparative analysis reveals that noble metal-based catalysts, like platinum, tend to offer higher efficiency and better selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts demonstrate greater stability and reduced susceptibility to deactivation. 

        The promoting effect of tin in platinum-based catalysts largely depends on the preparation method. Sequential impregnation leads to a significant portion of unalloyed platinum. High-temperature air treatments after reduction negatively impact the catalytic properties of PtSn samples. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) adsorption is minimal on platinum-tin alloys. The role of tin is to modify the electronic and geometric properties of platinum by forming PtSn alloys and diluting Pt sites, respectively. The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins. Zinc aluminate supports are favored due to their neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength. Zinc oxide modifies the dispersion and interaction between the metal and support in platinum-silver catalysts, leading to improved stability and selectivity. In zinc-doped platinum-silver catalysts, high selectivity and minimal activity loss are achieved in propane dehydrogenation due to the interaction between platinum and zinc. Characterization techniques are employed to elucidate the active phases in platinum-silver catalysts, as their catalytic performance critically depends on the bimetallic platinum-silver phases. The behavior of platinum-silver alloy phases is observed during reactions over both catalysts, with distinct influences from aluminum oxide and zinc aluminum oxide supports on these phases. Different platinum-silver alloy phases result in varying coke mobility across catalysts, ultimately affecting catalyst stability.

        A comprehensive study was conducted on the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over catalysts supported by aluminum oxide and magnesium-aluminum oxide, incorporating platinum and tin metals. An innovative real-time TOF-MS monitoring technique was introduced for analyzing the products directly over these catalysts. Strong acidic sites in aluminum oxide-based catalysts promoted the formation of aromatics and reduced mono-olefin selectivity. By adding magnesium to the supports, the total acidity of the catalysts was reduced, particularly the strong acidic sites. This led to increased interaction between platinum and the supports, weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the platinum surface and the strength of the Pt-C bond, facilitating the release of dehydrogenation products. Magnesium incorporation resulted in an increase in the total pore volume and pore size diameter, and a decrease in the specific surface area of the supports, as well as a reduction in platinum dispersion on the catalysts. Catalysts with added magnesium suppressed side reactions, enhanced mono-olefin selectivity and yield, and diminished dehydrogenation activity. Achieving a magnesium-to-aluminum molar ratio of 1/3 yielded the optimal n-dodecene output. The deposition of coke on catalysts can boost the selectivity of the catalysts. Real-time TOF-MS monitoring technology is a validated and efficient method for detecting products during high temperature reactions in situ, offering rapid and continuous detection capabilities.

        The demand for propylene worldwide is growing faster than ethylene, causing a shortfall in propylene supply from steam cracking. The study reported in this paper shows that the presence of zinc, both taking part of the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface of well-defined MCM-41 spheres, improves the selectivity of platinum catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. Interestingly, the incorporation of these zinc species into the silica matrix produces structural centers with a higher stability towards a reduction treatment together with a higher polarizing/activation ability towards molecules containing a carbonyl double bond. In fact, the newly created active sites further improve both the catalytic activity and selectivity (yield) to crotyl alcohol as compared with a conventional impregnated PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst. These zinc-doped MCM-41-based platinum catalysts exhibit also an excellent behavior in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream.

        The promoting effect of tin strongly depends on the method employed in the preparation. Sequential impregnation results in a large fraction of unalloyed platinum. High-temperature treatments in air of previously reduced PtSn samples are detrimental for the catalytic properties. CO and hydrogen adsorption does not take place to a great extent on the PtSn alloys.

        Various characterization techniques have been applied to understand the active phases in platinum-silver catalysts, since the catalytic performance strongly depends on the platinum-silver bimetallic phases. The formation and transition of platinum-silver alloy phases were directly observed during the reaction over both catalysts and the different influences of the aluminum oxide and zinc aluminum oxide supports on the behavior of platinum-silver alloy phases. The different platinum-silver alloy phases led to differences in the coke mobility over the catalysts and eventually had a strong effect on the catalyst stability.

        When the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3, the optimal n-dodecene yield could be obtained. The coke deposition over the catalysts can increase the selectivity of the catalysts. The on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology is a proven and effective method that can be applied in situ during high temperature reactions for detecting the products over the catalysts rapidly and continuously.

        In summary, noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts are crucial for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts offer high stability and selectivity for olefin production, while metal oxide catalysts contribute to enhancing stability and selectivity when combined with platinum. Zinc aluminate supports are preferred due to their neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength. The role of tin in modifying the electronic and geometric properties of platinum is recognized, and its addition to platinum catalyst systems positively impacts stability and selectivity towards olefins. Zinc oxide modifies the dispersion and interaction between the metal and support in platinum-silver catalysts, leading to improved stability and selectivity. In zinc-doped platinum-silver catalysts, high selectivity and minimal activity loss are achieved in propane dehydrogenation due to the interaction between platinum and zinc. Characterization techniques are employed to elucidate the active phases in platinum-silver catalysts, as their catalytic performance critically depends on the bimetallic platinum-silver phases. The behavior of platinum-silver alloy phases is observed during reactions over both catalysts, with distinct influences from aluminum oxide and zinc aluminum oxide supports on these phases. Different platinum-silver alloy phases result in varying coke mobility across catalysts, ultimately affecting catalyst stability. Recent advancements in catalyst design aim to enhance stability, activity, and selectivity, leading to more efficient catalysts. The comparative analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts, providing insights into their industrial applications and potential for further development.

        锡的促进效果很大程度上取决于其制备方法。顺序浸渍会导致大量未合金化的铂。还原后的PtSn样品在高温空气处理后，催化性能受损。CO和H2的吸附在铂锡合金上并不十分明显。

        应用各种表征技术来了解铂银催化剂中的活性相，因为其催化性能高度依赖于铂银双金属相。铂银合金相的形成和过渡在两个催化剂上直接观察到，并且铝氧化物和锌铝氧化物支持对铂银合金相行为的不同影响。不同铂银合金相导致催化剂上焦炭的移动性不同，最终对催化剂稳定性产生重大影响。

        当Mg/Al摩尔比为1/3时，可以获得最佳的n-十二烯产率。沉积在催化剂上的焦炭可以增加催化剂的选择性。实时TOF-MS监测技术是一种已验证的有效方法，可以在高温反应中就地快速连续检测催化剂上的产物。

        总之，贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，和金属氧化物基催化剂对于非氧化性脱氢轻烯烃至关重要。铂催化剂提供了轻烯烃生产中的高稳定性和选择性，而金属氧化物催化剂通过与铂结合时增强了稳定性和选择性。锌铝酸盐支持由于其中性特性、高热稳定性和机械强度而受到青睐。锡在修改铂的电子和几何性质方面的作用得到认可，并且其添加到铂催化剂系统中对稳定性及向烯烃的选择性和稳定性产生了积极影响。锌氧化物修改了金属和支撑之间的铂分散和相互作用，导致了稳定性和选择性的改善。在锌掺杂的铂银催化剂中，通过铂和锌之间的相互作用，实现了丙烷脱氢过程中的高选择性和最小的活性损失。应用各种表征技术来阐明铂银催化剂中的活性相，因为其催化性能高度依赖于铂银双金属相。铂银合金相的行为在两种催化剂上被观察到，铝氧化物和锌铝氧化物支持对这些相的特殊影响是不同的。不同铂银合金相导致催化剂上焦炭的移动性不同，最终影响催化剂稳定性。催化剂设计的最新进展旨在提高稳定性和活性，从而创造更高效的催化剂。比较分析强调了贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂的优势和局限性，并为它们的工业应用和未来发展提供了见解。
