        The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, are highly effective for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, showing high selectivity and activity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been utilized, although they generally exhibit lower stability and activity, especially under harsh conditions. Recent advancements in synthesis techniques have improved the performance of metal oxide catalysts. Industrial applications of these catalysts are widespread in petrochemical industries for producing ethylene and propylene. Noble metal-based catalysts offer higher efficiency and longer operational life, while metal oxide catalysts are cost-effective and use less toxic materials.
        
        In the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, noble metal-based catalysts, notably platinum, are characterized by their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, making them suitable for various industrial applications. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are valued for their robustness and resistance to poisoning under harsh conditions. Recent developments in catalyst design aim to enhance stability, activity, and selectivity, leading to more efficient catalysts. Comparative analysis indicates that noble metal-based catalysts tend to offer higher efficiency and better selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts demonstrate greater stability and reduced susceptibility to deactivation.
        
        A comprehensive study conducted on the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over catalysts supported by aluminum oxide and magnesium-aluminum oxide, incorporating platinum and tin metals, revealed the distinct characteristics of these catalysts. The addition of magnesium to the supports moderated the total acidity of the catalysts, reducing the strong acidic sites and increasing the interaction between the Pt and the supports. This facilitated the release of dehydrogenation products and improved the selectivity for mono-olefins. The deposition of coke on catalysts can boost the selectivity of the catalysts, and real-time TOF-MS monitoring technology offers rapid and continuous detection capabilities for high temperature reactions.
        
        The promoting effect of tin in platinum-based catalysts largely depends on the preparation method. Sequential impregnation leads to a significant portion of unalloyed platinum, and high-temperature air treatments after reduction negatively impact the catalytic properties of PtSn samples. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) adsorption is minimal on platinum-tin alloys. Zinc has been used as an additive and a support due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength. Zinc oxide modifies the dispersion and interaction between the metal and support in platinum-silver catalysts, leading to improved stability and selectivity. In zinc-doped platinum-silver catalysts, high selectivity and minimal activity loss are achieved in propane dehydrogenation due to the interaction between platinum and zinc.
        
        The study reported in this paper highlights the role of tin in modifying the electronic and geometric properties of platinum by forming platinum-tin alloys and diluting platinum sites, respectively. The addition of tin to platinum/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins. Zinc has been used as an additive and a support, offering neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength. Wang et al. reported that zinc oxide modifies the dispersion and interaction between the metal and support in platinum-silver catalysts, resulting in high catalytic performance in terms of stability and selectivity.
        
        The comparative analysis of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins underscores their distinct compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. Noble metals, notably platinum, are renowned for their high activity and selectivity in this process. Metal oxides, on the other hand, offer stability and lower costs. These catalysts find extensive use in petrochemical industries for the production of olefins from hydrocarbons. Recent advancements focus on improving catalyst performance, often involving modifications to noble metals or the incorporation of co-catalysts. Noble metals provide superior activity and selectivity, yet they may come with higher costs and risk of deactivation. Metal oxides ensure better stability and potentially lower costs, though they might fall short in achieving the high activity levels of noble metals.
        
        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook section suggests exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies based on the advanced findings. Future research efforts might concentrate on exploiting new catalyst designs, optimizing synthesis techniques, and investigating the synergistic effects of noble metals and metal oxides to enhance dehydrogenation efficiency and selectivity. The potential avenues for innovation include the development of catalysts with tailored properties for specific reaction conditions, the integration of advanced materials science to improve stability and longevity, and the exploration of novel support systems that can further optimize catalytic activity and selectivity.
        
        Acknowledging the advancements and insights from the referenced studies, there is a clear opportunity to leverage these findings for the advancement of the field. Future work could delve into the detailed mechanisms underlying the interactions between noble metals and metal oxides, the optimization of synthesis protocols to achieve desired catalyst properties, and the integration of computational methods to predict and guide the development of next-generation catalysts. The focus on sustainable and economically viable processes will be crucial, aiming to minimize environmental impact and enhance operational efficiencies in petrochemical industries.
