The Antrim Shale formation is a shallow gas resource in Michigan characterized by high nitrogen concentration in its gas. The Haynesville Shale is a newer shale area developed in northern Louisiana and East Texas. The Fayetteville Shale is an unconventional gas reservoir located in the Arkoma Basin, Arkansas, with a thickness ranging from 50 to 550 ft and a depth between 1500 and 6500 ft. The Haynesville Shale is noted for its depth of .10,000 ft, high bottomhole temperature of 175C, and high pressure of 3000 to 4000 psi. The compositions of the gases from these formations have been normalized to standard compounds.
