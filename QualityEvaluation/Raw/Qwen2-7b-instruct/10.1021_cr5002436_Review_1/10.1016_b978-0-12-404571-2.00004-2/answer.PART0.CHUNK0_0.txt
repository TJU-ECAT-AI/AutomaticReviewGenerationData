[1] "Shale gas refers to natural gas (mainly methane) found in fine-grained,organic-rich rocks (gas shale) (see Chapters 1 and 2)."
[2] "In addition, the degree of natural fracture development in an otherwise low-matrix-permeability shale reservoir is a controlling factor in gas producibility and, possibly, in gas properties."
[3] "The Antrim Shale is a shallow shale gas resource in Michigan. The Antrim Shale is unique because the gas is predominantly biogenic: methane is created as a by-product of bacterial consumption of organic material in the shale."
[4] "The Haynesville Shale gas resource is the newest shale area to be developed. It lies in northern Louisiana and East Texas. The formation is deep (.10,000 ft), with high bottomhole temperature (175C,350F), and high pressure (30004000 psi)."

1. Shale gas is natural gas, mainly methane, found in fine-grained, organic-rich rocks known as gas shales (see Chapters 1 and 2). The degree of natural fracture development in a low-matrix-permeability shale reservoir significantly influences gas producibility and possibly gas properties.

2. The Antrim Shale, a shallow gas resource in Michigan, uniquely produces gas primarily through biogenic processes. Methane is created as a by-product of bacterial consumption of organic material in the shale.

3. The Haynesville Shale is a newer, deep (over 10,000 ft) gas resource located in northern Louisiana and East Texas. It exhibits high bottomhole temperatures (175°C, 350°F) and pressures (3000-4000 psi).

1. 石灰岩气是存在于细粒、富含有机质的岩石（气石灰岩）中的天然气（主要为甲烷）（见第1章和第2章）。低孔隙率石灰岩储层中天然裂缝发育的程度显著影响天然气的可采性和可能的气体性质。

2. 安特里姆石灰岩是一个位于密歇根州的浅层石灰岩资源。其独特之处在于，天然气主要是通过生物生成过程产生的。细菌消耗有机物质在石灰岩中产生的甲烷作为副产品。

3. 海恩斯维尔石灰岩是较新的深层（超过10,000英尺）天然气资源，位于路易斯安那州北部和东德克萨斯州。它具有高底孔温度（175°C，350°F）和压力（3000-4000 psi）。
