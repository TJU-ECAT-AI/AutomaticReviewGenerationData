[1] "Shale gas refers to natural gas (mainly methane) found in fine-grained,organic-rich rocks (gas shale) (see Chapters 1 and 2)."
[2] "In addition, the degree of natural fracture development in an otherwise low-matrix-permeability shale reservoir is a controlling factor in gas producibility and, possibly, in gas properties."
[3] "The Antrim Shale is a shallow shale gas resource in Michigan. The Antrim Shale is unique because the gas is predominantly biogenic: methane is created as a by-product of bacterial consumption of organic material in the shale."
[4] "The Haynesville Shale gas resource is the newest shale area to be developed. It lies in northern Louisiana and East Texas. The formation is deep (.10,000 ft), with high bottomhole temperature (175C,350F), and high pressure (30004000 psi)."

1. Shale gas is natural gas, mainly methane, found in fine-grained, organic-rich rocks known as gas shales (see Chapters 1 and 2). The degree of natural fracture development in a low-matrix-permeability shale reservoir significantly influences gas producibility and possibly gas properties.

2. The Antrim Shale, a shallow gas resource in Michigan, uniquely produces gas primarily through biogenic processes. Methane is created as a by-product of bacterial consumption of organic material in the shale.

3. The Haynesville Shale is a newer, deep (over 10,000 ft) gas resource located in northern Louisiana and East Texas. It exhibits high bottomhole temperatures (175°C, 350°F) and pressures (3000-4000 psi).

[1] "Natural gas production from shale gas reservoirs is now proven to be feasible from numerous operations in various shale gas reservoirs in North America, but many challenges still remain in the full exploita- tion of these unconventional reservoirs."
[2] "Production from shale gas reservoirs requires stimulation by hydraulic fracturing due to the extremely low permeability of the reservoir rocks."
[3] "Although distinct in focus, these needs demonstrate the importance of the thorough charac- terization of shale gas reservoir (Table 4.1) as well as an understanding of how earth materials deform over various time scales and how it affect the current state of stress in the crust (Speight, 2014)."
[4] "There is an additional issue that must be resolved if shale gas is to be a major contributor to US energy resources (or to the energy plans of any country). The issue is the amenability of the gas to be included in current gas processing scenarios (Mokhatab et al.,2006; Speight, 2007)."
[5] "In addition, analysis of the gas composition of Devonian Shale wells indicates that the composition of produced gas shifts during the produc- tion history of the well (Schettler et al., 1989)."
[6] "In fact, the only way to explain observed fractionation with such classic mechan- isms is to assume that total flow has several sources within the wellbore,each with different characteristic compositions and decline curves."
[7] "The flow rate of an individual component of a gas mixture can be obtained by multiplying the total flow rate by the mole fraction of the individual component."
[8] "The second alternative is to assume that the gas composition changes observed at the wellbore reflect the changing composition of gas from at least some of the sources themselves."
[9] "Candidates for such differences in gas composition include the presence of adsorption, solution, and/or diffusion. The occurrence of adsorption is associated with the presence of certain minerals in the reservoir, such as clay."
[10] "Thus, as reservoir depletion occurs, the composi- tion of the gas produced may approach the composition of the gas orig- inally in the reservoir."
[11] "This process, while appearing to be ordered in such a description, is in fact subject to geological disorder and thence subject to differing methods of entrapment of the organic material, different methods or rates of decomposition, different rates of formation of the gas, and hence different composition of the shale gas."
[12] "However, because shale is composed primarily of tiny grains of clay minerals and quartz, the mineral components of mud, the composition of the shale reservoir can varyspecifically the rock properties such as porosity, permeability, capillary entry pressure, pore volume compress- ibility, pore size distribution, and flow path (collectively known as petrophysics) can vary considerably (Sone, 2012)."
[13] "The uncertainties of reservoir properties and fracture parameters (see Chapters 2 and 3) have a significant effect on shale gas properties and production, making the process of optimization of hydraulic frac- turing treatment design for economic gas production much more com- plex."
[14] "Characterizing these organic-rich shale formations can be challenging as these rocks vary quite significantly (Passey et al., 2010)."
[15] "Not surprisingly, gas-bearing shale formations are complex reser- voirs (with a porosity on the order of 4 to 6 porosity units and a total organic carbon content of $ 4% w/w), which represent significant vari- ety in reservoir characteristics (i.e., mineralogy, porosity, permeability,gas content, and pressure)."
[16] "In addition, the shale porosity changes at very different rates in different regions and formations."
[17] "Not surprisingly, and in accordance with the varying shale reservoir properties, it must be anticipated that there will be differences in shale gas composition and properties."
[18] "Produced shale gas observed to date has shown a broad variation in compositional makeup, with some having wider compo- nent ranges, a wider span of minimum and maximum heating values,and higher levels of water vapor and other substances than pipeline tariffs or purchase contracts may typically allow."
[19] "Indeed, because of these variations in gas composition, each shale gas formation can have unique processing requirements for the produced shale gas to be mar- ketable."
[20] "Although not highly sour in the usual sense of having high hydro- gen sulfide content, and with considerable variation from resource to resource and even from well to well within the same resource (due to extremely low permeability of the shale even after fracturing) (see Chapters 1 and 3), shale gas often contains varying amounts of hydro- gen sulfide with wide variability in the carbon dioxide content."
[21] "The Antrim Shale gas, for example, has high nitrogen concentra- tion, as does at least one well tested in the Barnett Shale formation."
[22] "New Albany Shale gas show high carbon dioxide concentrations while several wells in the Marcellus Gas Shale have tested up to 16% v/v."
[23] "In a traditional gas processing plant, the olamine of choice for hydrogen sulfide removal is N-methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) (Mokhatab et al., 2006; Speight, 2007) but whether or not this olamine will suffice to remove the hydrogen sulfide without removal of exces- sive amounts of carbon dioxide is another issue."

Shale gas production faces significant challenges, including the need for hydraulic fracturing due to the low permeability of reservoir rocks. The characterization of shale gas reservoirs and understanding of geological processes are crucial for exploitation. The composition of shale gas varies widely, influenced by factors such as organic matter content, porosity, permeability, and the presence of clay minerals. The gas composition can shift during production, affecting processing requirements. The presence of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide in varying amounts poses challenges for gas processing. Specialized techniques, such as using N-methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) for hydrogen sulfide removal, are employed but require careful consideration to avoid excessive carbon dioxide removal.

Answering the question:
Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (such as Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, it appears that the document does not provide a detailed comparison. However, based on the context, we can infer that noble metal-based catalysts might offer better efficiency and selectivity due to their high reactivity and stability, especially Platinum, which is known for its catalytic activity. Metal oxide-based catalysts could be more cost-effective and stable under harsh conditions, but they might have lower activity and selectivity compared to noble metals. The effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages would largely depend on the specific properties of the olefin being dehydrogenated and the conditions of the process. Without specific data or comparisons in the document, we cannot provide a comprehensive answer.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Shale gas refers to natural gas (mainly methane) found in fine-grained, organic-rich rocks (gas shale). The production of shale gas requires stimulation by hydraulic fracturing due to the extremely low permeability of the reservoir rocks. The natural gas is stored in shale in three different ways: adsorbed gas, free gas, and solution gas. The liquid content of a gas is often measured in terms of the condensate ratio, which is expressed in terms of barrels of liquid per million cubic feet of gas (bbls/MMcf). Gas processing usually involves the removal of oil, water, sulfur, helium, carbon dioxide, and natural gas liquids. The compositions of the shale gas vary widely depending on the specific shale formation. The Marcellus Shale gas has relatively little carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and does not require the removal of natural gas liquids for pipeline transportation. The Antrim Shale gas has high nitrogen concentration. In other shale resources, underlying Devonian formations may communicate with and contaminate the shale formations. The effective bulk permeability in gas shale is typically much less than 0.1 mD, although exceptions exist where the rock is naturally fractured.

页岩气是指存在于细粒有机质岩（页岩气）中的天然气（主要是甲烷）。页岩气的生产需要通过水力压裂来刺激，因为储层岩石的渗透性极低。天然气在页岩中以三种不同的方式储存：吸附气、自由气和溶液气。气体中的液体含量通常用凝析油比来衡量，表示每百万立方英尺气体中有多少桶液体（bbls/MMcf）。气体处理通常涉及去除油、水、硫化氢、氦气、二氧化碳和天然气液体。页岩气的组成因特定的页岩层而异。马塞勒斯页岩气含有较少的二氧化碳和氮气，并不需要去除天然气液体即可进行管道运输。安特里姆页岩气具有较高的氮浓度。在其他页岩资源中，下伏的二叠纪层可能会与页岩层沟通并污染页岩层。页岩的有效总孔隙度通常小于0.1 mD，尽管存在天然裂缝的页岩层例外，例如美国密歇根盆地的安特里姆页岩层。
