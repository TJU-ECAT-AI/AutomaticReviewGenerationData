Answering the question:
Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (such as Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, it appears that the document does not provide a detailed comparison. However, based on the context, we can infer that noble metal-based catalysts might offer better efficiency and selectivity due to their high reactivity and stability, especially Platinum, which is known for its catalytic activity. Metal oxide-based catalysts could be more cost-effective and stable under harsh conditions, but they might have lower activity and selectivity compared to noble metals. The effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages would largely depend on the specific properties of the olefin being dehydrogenated and the conditions of the process. Without specific data or comparisons in the document, we cannot provide a comprehensive answer.
