[1] "In this work, the modifying effect of alkaline metals (Li, Na and K) was studied on the acid properties of the support and on the behavior of catalytic systems PtSn/;-Al2O3, in the isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The analysis of the influ- ence of the alkaline metal addition on the solid acidity was carried out by means of the isopropyl alcohol trans- formation."
[3] "In this case, the study was performed on the modified g-Al2O3 (Li,Na,K)/g-Al2O3) and not on modified bimetallic systems (PtSn(Li,Na,K)/g-Al2O3), due to the fact that the isopropyl alcohol is dehydrogenated in presence of Pt, which masks the results referred specifically to acid base properties of the support."

The study focused on the impact of alkaline metals (Li, Na, and K) on the acid properties of the support and the catalytic behavior of PtSn/g-Al2O3 systems in isobutane dehydrogenation. The isopropyl alcohol transformation method was used to analyze the effect of these metals on the support's acidity. The researchers did not investigate modified bimetallic systems because the dehydrogenation process in the presence of Pt obscures the results related to the support's acid-base properties.

研究专注于碱金属（Li、Na和K）对支持物酸性质以及PtSn/g-Al2O3系统在异丁烷脱氢作用下的催化行为的影响。通过异丙醇转化方法分析这些金属对支持物酸性的效果。研究人员没有研究改性双金属体系，因为Pt的存在掩盖了与支持物酸-碱性质相关的结果。</ChineseVersionAnswer>
