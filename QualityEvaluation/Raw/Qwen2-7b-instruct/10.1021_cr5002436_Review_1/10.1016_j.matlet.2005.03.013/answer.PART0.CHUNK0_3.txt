[1] "In this work, the modifying effect of alkaline metals (Li, Na and K) was studied on the acid properties of the support and on the behavior of catalytic systems PtSn/;-Al2O3, in the isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The analysis of the influ- ence of the alkaline metal addition on the solid acidity was carried out by means of the isopropyl alcohol trans- formation."
[3] "Previous studies performed by our group demonstrated that the methodology of alkaline modifier incorporation has an important influence on the catalyst final properties."
[4] "Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability."
[5] "The most important tin effects on these catalysts are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the nature of the coke formed."

The study focuses on the impact of alkaline metals (Li, Na, and K) on the acidic properties of the support and the behavior of PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation. It examines how these metals affect the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability through the isopropyl alcohol transformation process. The research highlights the importance of the alkaline modifier incorporation method on the final catalyst properties. Tin is commonly used as a modifier for platinum in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, enhancing selectivity towards olefins and improving stability. The tin's primary effects include inhibiting cracking via a geometric mechanism and reducing the deactivation rate, either by decreasing coke formation or altering the coke's nature.
