[1] "In this work, the modifying effect of alkaline metals (Li, Na and K) was studied on the acid properties of the support and on the behavior of catalytic systems PtSn/;-Al2O3, in the isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The analysis of the influ- ence of the alkaline metal addition on the solid acidity was carried out by means of the isopropyl alcohol trans- formation."
[3] "For the dehydrogenation reaction, the addition of K improves the stability level of the catalyst, and, as a result, PtSnK1.7 catalyst presents the best performance activity/selectivity/stability."
[4] "Previous studies performed by our group demonstrated that the methodology of alkaline modifier incorporation has an important influence on the catalyst final properties."

In the study, the impact of adding alkaline metals (Li, Na, and K) on the acidic properties of the support and the performance of PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation was explored. The isopropyl alcohol transformation rate decreased significantly with the addition of these metals, following a sequence of Li < Na < K. Potassium addition enhanced catalyst stability, leading to the PtSnK1.7 catalyst demonstrating the highest activity, selectivity, and stability. Our group's previous research highlighted the significant effect of alkaline modifier incorporation on the catalyst's final properties.

[3] "In this case, the study was performed on the modified g-Al2O3 (Li,Na,K)/g-Al2O3) and not on modified bimetallic systems (PtSn(Li,Na,K)/g-Al2O3), due to the fact that the isopropyl alcohol is dehydrogenated in presence of Pt, which masks the results referred specifically to acid base properties of the support."

The study focused on the impact of alkaline metals (Li, Na, and K) on the acid properties of the support and the catalytic behavior of PtSn/g-Al2O3 systems in isobutane dehydrogenation. The isopropyl alcohol transformation method was used to analyze the effect of these metals on the support's acidity. The researchers did not investigate modified bimetallic systems because the dehydrogenation process in the presence of Pt obscures the results related to the support's acid-base properties.

The study examines the impact of alkaline metals (Li, Na, and K) on the acidic properties of the support and the performance of PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation. Lithium shows the least effect, sodium has a moderate effect, while potassium significantly enhances catalyst stability, making the PtSnK1.7 catalyst the most active and selective.

Tin is commonly used as a modifier for platinum in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, enhancing selectivity for olefins and improving stability. The catalyst preparation involves reacting organotin compounds with a transition metal supported on silica or alumina.

The cited methods employ Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques to synthesize stable, highly dispersed bimetallic catalysts using organotin compounds and transition metals on supports like silica or alumina.
