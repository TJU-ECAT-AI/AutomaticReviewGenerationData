[1] "In this work, the modifying effect of alkaline metals (Li, Na and K) was studied on the acid properties of the support and on the behavior of catalytic systems PtSn/;-Al2O3, in the isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The addition of K improves the stability level of the catalyst, and, as a result, PtSnK1.7 catalyst presents the best performance activity/selectivity/stability."
[3] "Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability."
[4] "These techniques involve the reaction of organotin compounds, such as tetra-n-butyltin (SnBu4), with a transition metal supported on SiO2 or Al2O3."

The study examines the impact of alkaline metals (Li, Na, and K) on the acidic properties of the support and the performance of PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation. Lithium shows the least effect, sodium has a moderate effect, while potassium significantly enhances catalyst stability, making the PtSnK1.7 catalyst the most active and selective.

Tin is commonly used as a modifier for platinum in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, enhancing selectivity for olefins and improving stability. The catalyst preparation involves reacting organotin compounds with a transition metal supported on silica or alumina.

The cited methods employ Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques to synthesize stable, highly dispersed bimetallic catalysts using organotin compounds and transition metals on supports like silica or alumina.

本研究探讨了碱金属（锂、钠和钾）对支撑体酸性特性和PtSn/g-Al2O3催化剂在异丁烷脱氢反应行为的影响。锂的作用最小，钠有中等影响，而钾显著提高了催化剂的稳定性，使得PtSnK1.7催化剂表现出最佳的活性、选择性和稳定性。

锡广泛用于铂基烷烃脱氢催化剂的改性，能提高烯烃的选择性和稳定性。催化剂制备方法涉及将有机锡化合物与硅或氧化铝支持的过渡金属反应。

引用的方法采用表面有机金属化学在金属（SOMC/M）技术，通过使用有机锡化合物和硅或氧化铝支持的过渡金属合成稳定、高度分散的二元催化剂。
