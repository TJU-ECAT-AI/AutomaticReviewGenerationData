The document focuses on the study of the modifying effect of alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) on the acid properties of a support and on the behavior of PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts for the isobutane dehydrogenation. The addition of these metals affects the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability, particularly in terms of the isopropyl alcohol transformation rate and the dehydrogenation reaction. Tin is noted as a widely used modifier for platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, enhancing selectivity and stability. The catalyst preparation involves SOMC/M techniques, and specific emphasis is placed on the impact of alkaline metals on the support's acidity and the catalyst's overall properties.
