PtSn/g-Al2O3 isobutane dehydrogenation catalysts: The effect of alkaline metals addition Guillermo J. Siria,b,*, Guillermo R. Bertolinia, Mo nica L. Casellaa, Osmar A. Ferrettia,b aCentro de Investigacio n y Desarrollo en Ciencias Aplicadas Dr. Jorge Ronco (CINDECA), Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Universidad Nacional de La Plata-CONICET, 47 N-257, 1900 La Plata, Argentina bFacultad de Ingenier a, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, 1 esq 47, 1900 La Plata, Argentina Received 23 August 2004; accepted 9 March 2005 Available online 31 March 2005 Abstract In this work, the modifying effect of alkaline metals (Li, Na and K) is studied on the acid properties of the support and on the behavior of PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalytic systems, in the isobutane dehydrogenation. The isopropyl alcohol transformation rate decreases sharply with the addition of alkaline metals, according to the sequence Li<Na<K. For the dehydrogenation reaction, the addition of K improves the stability level of the catalyst, and, as a result, PtSnK1.7 catalyst presents the best performance activity/selectivity/stability.D 2005 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins, due to the endothermic character of these reactions, presents thermodynamic difficulties and for this reason it has to be carried out at high temperatures (above 773 K for the isobutane case). This fact, apart from representing a high energetic cost, favors the appearance of undesirable lateral reactions such as formation of coke and light hydrocarbons by cracking. Taking dehydrogenation reaction of isobutane as an example, the skeletal isomerization is also an important cause of selectivity decrease to isobutene. This reaction is strongly favored by acid sites present in the g- alumina usually used as support. The neutralization of these sites by adding alkaline metals is a way to decrease the formation of lineal hydrocarbons from isobutane or from isobutene [13]. Previous studies performed by our group demonstrated that the methodology of alkaline modifier incorporation has an important influence on the catalyst final properties [4,5].
Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability [2,3,610]. The most important tin effects on these catalysts are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the nature of the coke formed. The accurate nature of supported PtSn systems is very complicated, and numerous factors affect the characteristics of these catalysts, such as the support acidity, preparation procedure, nature of the precursor compounds, etc. Preparation techniques play a significant role in controlling the type of interactions that occur between tin and platinum and between them and the support. Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) procedures applied to the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts lead to stable and highly dispersed systems, as it has been reported in the literature [2]. These techniques involve the reaction of organotin compounds, such as tetra-n-butyltin (SnBu4), with a transition metal supported on SiO2 or Al2O3 [1113]. 0167-577X/$ - see front matter D 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Materials Letters 59 (2005) 2319  2324 www.elsevier.com/locate/matlet In this work, the modifying effect of alkaline metals (Li, Na and K) was studied on the acid properties of the support and on the behavior of catalytic systems PtSn/;-Al2O3, in the isobutane dehydrogenation. The analysis of the influ- ence of the alkaline metal addition on the solid acidity was carried out by means of the isopropyl alcohol trans- formation. In this case, the study was performed on the modified g-Al2O3 (Li,Na,K)/g-Al2O3) and not on modified bimetallic systems (PtSn(Li,Na,K)/g-Al2O3), due to the fact that the isopropyl alcohol is dehydrogenated in presence of Pt, which masks the results referred specifically to acid base properties of the support.
2. Experimental
A high purity commercial g-Al2O3 with a BET surface area of 184.1 m2/g has been used. Before impregnation,alumina was calcined for 2 h at 773 K in air. Two series of alkali/alumina samples were prepared by impregnating alumina (60100 mesh) with aqueous solution of the alkali metal precursors (LiOH, NaOH, KOH, Merck, p.a.). After impregnation, samples were dried at 378 K overnight and calcined in air at 773 K. The alkali metal concentrations of the different samples are shown in Table 1.
Bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by employing SOMC/M techniques [2,14]. To prepare the base monometallic catalyst, a solution of H2PtCl6, having a concentration to obtain 1% w/w Pt exchanged, was added onto the g-Al2O3, according to the procedures described in

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
