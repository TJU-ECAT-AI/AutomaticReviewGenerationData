In the study, the impact of adding alkaline metals (Li, Na, and K) on the acidic properties of the support and the performance of PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation was explored. The isopropyl alcohol transformation rate decreased significantly with the addition of these metals, following a sequence of Li < Na < K. Potassium addition enhanced catalyst stability, leading to the PtSnK1.7 catalyst demonstrating the highest activity, selectivity, and stability. Our group's previous research highlighted the significant effect of alkaline modifier incorporation on the catalyst's final properties.

在研究中，我们探讨了碱金属（Li、Na和K）添加对支持物酸性特性和PtSn/g-Al2O3催化剂在异丁烷脱氢反应中的行为的影响。异丙醇转化率随着这些金属的添加显著降低，按照Li < Na < K的顺序。钾的添加提高了催化剂的稳定性，导致PtSnK1.7催化剂表现出最高的活性、选择性和稳定性。我们团队之前的研究表明，碱性修饰剂的引入对催化剂最终性能有重要影响。
