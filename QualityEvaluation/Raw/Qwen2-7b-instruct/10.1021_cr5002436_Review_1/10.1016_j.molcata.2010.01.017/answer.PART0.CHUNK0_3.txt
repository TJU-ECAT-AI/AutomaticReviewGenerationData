[1] "In the past three decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to improving a low energy consumption and inexpensive technology to feed the ever-increasing demand for olefins. Propylene plays a key role in petrochemical industry, and it is profitable to produce it from propane."
[2] "Compared to the direct dehydrogenation process, the so-called dehydrogenation oxidation (DHO) is preferred because of the introduction of selective oxidation of H2."
[3] "At 150 K, the dissociative adsorption of methyl could be identified by reflection-absorption infrared spectrometry (RAIRS)."
[4] "Moreover, Fuhrmann et al. [15] employed the temperature-programmed XPS and molecular beam techniques to investigate the dissociation of methane and found that methyl was adsorbed on Pt(1 1 1) at 120 K, which was dehydrogenated to CH at 260 K and further dehydrogenated to carbon above 500 K."
[5] "As for heavier hydrocarbons, Kao and Madix [16] performed both experimental and theoretical studies to verify that propane was physisorbed on the metal surface, and the trapping probability of propane on Pd(1 1 1) was higher than that on Pt(1 1 1)."
[6] "On Pt(6 5 5) and Pt(1 1 0)-(1 × 2), the corrugation of the metal surface played a key role in attracting the propane molecule."
[7] "At 200 K, the formation of propylene via -hydride elimination was identified by isotopic labeling TPD experiments."
[8] "Using RAIRS, Zaera and Chrysostomou proposed that propylene interacted with the Pt(1 1 1) single-crystal surface via two metal-carbon covalent bonds, and the rehybridization of C=C double bond of propylene took place at low coverages."
[9] "Furthermore, in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, the di-binding propylene could be easily dehydrogenated to propylidyne just below the room temperature and then to vinylmethylidyne (CCHCH2) at 450 K."
[10] "Density functional theory calculations are carried out with the VASP package [3133] using a plane wave basis set."
[11] "Calculations are performed using the generalized gradient approximation functional proposed by Perdew et al. [34]."
[12] "A four-layer slab with a p(3 × 3) supercell is used to represent the Pt(1 1 1) surface, achieving the coverage of adsorbates of 1/9 ML."
[13] "The equilibrium Pt-Pt interatomic distance is calculated to be 2.82 Å."

This study focuses on the density functional theory (DFT) investigation of the chemisorption of C1, C2, and C3 intermediates on Pt(1 1 1) during the dehydrogenation of propane. It aims to understand the adsorption energies, favored binding sites, and geometric parameters of adsorption configurations. The calculations compare the adsorption energies of C1 species (C, CH, CH2, CH3), C2 species (C2H3, C2H4, C2H5), and C3 species (propylene, propadiene, propyne) on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The study also explores the stepwise dehydrogenation of propane to propynyl (CCCH3) and predicts the most stable species and the most likely starting point for the CC scission based on the adsorption energies and Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) analysis.

本研究专注于密度泛函理论（DFT）对丙烷脱氢过程中Pt(1 1 1)表面C1、C2和C3中间体的化学吸附的研究。旨在理解吸附能、最有利的吸附位点和吸附构型的几何参数。计算比较了C1物种（C、CH、CH2、CH3）、C2物种（C2H3、C2H4、C2H5）和C3物种（丙烯、丙二烯、丙炔）在Pt(1 1 1)表面的吸附能。研究还探讨了丙烷逐步脱氢到丙基（CCCH3），并基于吸附能和Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi（BEP）分析预测最稳定物种以及CC断裂的最可能起始点。
