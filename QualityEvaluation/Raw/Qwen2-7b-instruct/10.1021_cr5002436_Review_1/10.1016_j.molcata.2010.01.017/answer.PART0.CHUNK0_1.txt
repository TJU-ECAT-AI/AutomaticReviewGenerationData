The study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the dehydrogenation and cleavage of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds based on the chemical adsorption of intermediates on a platinum (Pt) (1 1 1) surface. The main focus is on the adsorption of C3 intermediates to predict the possible products resulting from the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane.
