Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are widely used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their efficient performance in converting lower hydrocarbons into more valuable olefinic compounds. These catalysts are capable of facilitating the breaking of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds while minimizing oxidative side reactions, leading to increased selectivity and yield. Platinum-based catalysts, as well as those composed of metals like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum, offer various advantages such as high activity, stability, and resistance to poisoning by sulfur and nitrogen compounds. Industrial applications often involve the use of these catalysts in processes where the conversion of lighter hydrocarbons into higher-value products is required. Recent developments focus on enhancing catalyst stability, improving selectivity towards desired products, and reducing energy consumption. Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts demonstrate distinct compositions and effectiveness, with noble metals generally offering superior performance but potentially higher costs.
