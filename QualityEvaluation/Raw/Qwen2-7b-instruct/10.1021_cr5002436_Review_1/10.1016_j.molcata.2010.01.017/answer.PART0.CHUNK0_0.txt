[1] "Much theoretical work has been conducted to explore the adsorption and reactions of hydrocarbons in the past decade, especially for the C1 and C2 species."
[2] "They proposed that propylene preferred to be adsorbed on the surface in the di-mode and the adsorption energy was calculated to be 0.93 eV."
[3] "In 1897, Sabatier discovered that transition metals were good catalysts for the hydrogenation of hydrocarbons, and extensive research was conducted to investigate the mechanism of such reactions."
[4] "The dehydrogenation of propane involves a large number of side reactions including the deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of propane which lead to numerous fragments ranging from C1 to C3 species adsorbed on the catalyst surface."
[5] "Their calculated results were in good agreement with the recent theoretical results."
[6] "In the present study, DFT calculations are employed to inves-tigate the dehydrogenation and CC cleavage based on the chemisorption of the intermediates on Pt(1 1 1)."

The document focuses on the density functional theory (DFT) study of the chemisorption of C1, C2, and C3 intermediates during the dehydrogenation of propane on a Pt(1 1 1) surface. The study calculates the adsorption energies, favored binding sites, and optimized configurations for these hydrocarbon fragments. It also explores the stepwise dehydrogenation of propane to propynyl, suggesting that propylidyne is the most stable species on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The calculations predict propyne as the most likely starting point for the CC scission. The document does not compare noble metal-based catalysts specifically to metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

本文主要关注了密度泛函理论（DFT）在丙烷脱氢过程中，丙烷在Pt(1 1 1)表面吸附的化学吸附研究。研究计算了C1、C2和C3中间体的吸附能、最有利的吸附位点和优化配置。它还探讨了丙烷逐步脱氢到丙基烯的过程，指出丙基炔是Pt(1 1 1)表面上最稳定的物种。计算预测丙炔作为CC断裂的起始点的可能性最大。文档并未具体比较贵金属催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中的性能对比。
