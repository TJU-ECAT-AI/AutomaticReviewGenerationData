The document focuses on the density functional theory (DFT) study of the chemisorption of C1, C2, and C3 intermediates during the dehydrogenation of propane on a Pt(1 1 1) surface. The study calculates the adsorption energies, favored binding sites, and optimized configurations for these hydrocarbon fragments. It also explores the stepwise dehydrogenation of propane to propynyl, suggesting that propylidyne is the most stable species on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The calculations predict propyne as the most likely starting point for the CC scission. The document does not compare noble metal-based catalysts specifically to metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the importance of platinum in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly for the hydrogenation of olefins, dehydrogenation of paraffins, and conversion of propane to propylene. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are also mentioned in the context of recent developments in the field. The document does not provide detailed comparisons between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts, nor does it discuss their compositions or specific industrial applications. Instead, it focuses on the computational study of the chemisorption and surface reactions of hydrocarbons on platinum surfaces. The document mentions that the favored adsorption sites for certain hydrocarbons on platinum surfaces are the Bridge and Face-centered cubic (Fcc) sites. It also discusses the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the dehydrogenation and cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrocarbon molecules adsorbed on the platinum surface.

This study focuses on the density functional theory (DFT) investigation of the chemisorption of C1, C2, and C3 intermediates on Pt(1 1 1) during the dehydrogenation of propane. It aims to understand the adsorption energies, favored binding sites, and geometric parameters of adsorption configurations. The calculations compare the adsorption energies of C1 species (C, CH, CH2, CH3), C2 species (C2H3, C2H4, C2H5), and C3 species (propylene, propadiene, propyne) on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The study also explores the stepwise dehydrogenation of propane to propynyl (CCCH3) and predicts the most stable species and the most likely starting point for the CC scission based on the adsorption energies and Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) analysis.

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are widely used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their efficient performance in converting lower hydrocarbons into more valuable olefinic compounds. These catalysts are capable of facilitating the breaking of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds while minimizing oxidative side reactions, leading to increased selectivity and yield. Platinum-based catalysts, as well as those composed of metals like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum, offer various advantages such as high activity, stability, and resistance to poisoning by sulfur and nitrogen compounds. Industrial applications often involve the use of these catalysts in processes where the conversion of lighter hydrocarbons into higher-value products is required. Recent developments focus on enhancing catalyst stability, improving selectivity towards desired products, and reducing energy consumption. Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts demonstrate distinct compositions and effectiveness, with noble metals generally offering superior performance but potentially higher costs.
