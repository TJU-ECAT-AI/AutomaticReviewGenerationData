[1] "In the past three decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to improving a low energy consumption and inexpensive technology to feed the ever-increasing demand for olefins."
[2] "Propylene plays a key role in petrochemical industry, and it is profitable to produce it from propane."
[3] "Currently, commercial process for propylene synthesis through direct dehydrogenation of propane is available. However, this process suffers from several problems such as coke formation and thermodynamic limitations."
[4] "Compared to the direct dehydrogenation process, the so-called dehydrogenation oxidation (DHO) is preferred because of the introduction of selective oxidation of H2."
[5] "Much theoretical work has been conducted to explore the adsorption and reactions of hydrocarbons in the past decade, especially for the C1 and C2 species."
[6] "The dehydrogenation of propane involves a large number of side reactions including the deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of propane which lead to numerous fragments ranging from C1 to C3 species adsorbed on the catalyst surface."
[7] "The favored adsorption sites of ethylidene (CHCH3) and ethylidyne (CCH3) were the Bridge and Fcc sites, respectively."
[8] "In the present study, DFT calculations are employed to investigate the dehydrogenation and CC cleavage based on the chemisorption of the intermediates on Pt(1 1 1)."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the importance of platinum in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly for the hydrogenation of olefins, dehydrogenation of paraffins, and conversion of propane to propylene. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are also mentioned in the context of recent developments in the field. The document does not provide detailed comparisons between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts, nor does it discuss their compositions or specific industrial applications. Instead, it focuses on the computational study of the chemisorption and surface reactions of hydrocarbons on platinum surfaces. The document mentions that the favored adsorption sites for certain hydrocarbons on platinum surfaces are the Bridge and Face-centered cubic (Fcc) sites. It also discusses the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the dehydrogenation and cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrocarbon molecules adsorbed on the platinum surface.
