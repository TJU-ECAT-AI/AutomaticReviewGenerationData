Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, both types play significant roles in the process. Platinum catalysts are renowned for their high selectivity and efficiency in converting light olefins into aromatics, making them valuable in this context. On the other hand, metal oxide catalysts, including chromium oxides (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer cost benefits and enhanced robustness under harsh conditions, making them a viable alternative. Recent advancements have aimed to improve the stability and activity of these catalysts, particularly for industrial applications. Noble metal catalysts excel in reactivity and selectivity, while metal oxide catalysts are noted for their thermal stability. However, the high cost of noble metals and the potential toxicity of metal oxides are limitations that hinder their broader adoption.
