[1] "The development of catalytic processes for the conversion of CO2 into olefins might gain importance in the future as an alternative pathway for light olefins production."
[2] "Iron can be presented as the metal of choice for the FTO reaction as it is inexpensive, it is highly selective toward olefins, and it is possible to achieve methane selectivities below the prediction of the ASF product distribution."
[3] "The design of effective iron-based catalysts for the selective production of light olefins involves several factors:• The selection of a support that enables the formation of the active phase and its intimate contact with the chemical promoters • The adequate choice of promoters to increase the selectivity to light olefins and minimize methane production • The use of preparation methods that allow obtaining a homogeneous spatial distribution of iron-containing particles with narrow size distribution in the optimum size range • The selection of optimum process conditions to maximize the catalyst life without compromising product selectivity"

1. The conversion of CO2 into olefins could become a significant alternative pathway for light olefins production in the future. 
2. Iron is considered the preferred metal for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO) reactions due to its low cost, high selectivity for olefins, and ability to produce methane selectivities below the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) product distribution predictions.
3. Designing effective iron-based catalysts for the selective production of light olefins requires choosing a support that facilitates the active phase formation and its interaction with chemical promoters, selecting appropriate promoters to enhance olefin selectivity while reducing methane production, employing preparation methods to achieve a homogenous distribution of iron particles with a narrow size range, and setting optimal process conditions to prolong catalyst life without sacrificing product selectivity.

1. 将二氧化碳转化为烯烃可能成为未来生产轻烯烃的替代途径。
2. 铁被认为是Fischer-Tropsch到烯烃（FTO）反应的理想金属，因为它成本低廉、对烯烃的选择性高，并且能够产生低于Anderson-Schulz-Flory（ASF）产品分布预测的甲烷选择性。
3. 设计有效的铁基催化剂以实现轻烯烃的高选择性生产需要选择一种支持物，使其能够形成活性相并与其化学促进剂紧密接触，选择合适的促进剂以增强轻烯烃的选择性和减少甲烷生成，采用制备方法来实现铁颗粒的均匀分布和窄尺寸范围，以及设定最佳工艺条件以延长催化剂寿命而不损害产物选择性。
