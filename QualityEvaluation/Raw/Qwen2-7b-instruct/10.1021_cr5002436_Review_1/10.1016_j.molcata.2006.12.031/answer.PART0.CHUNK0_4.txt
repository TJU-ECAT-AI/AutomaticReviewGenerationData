[1] "A novel kind of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria were prepared by a co-impregnation method and tested in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral after reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperatures."
[2] "Reduction treatment at 773 K produced a strong decrease in the CO adsorption capacity in all cases, although this loss was more relevant for the monometallic catalyst."
[3] "After reduction at low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity."
[4] "Reduction at high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in the case of monometallic sample while bimetallic catalysts,specially the one with Sn/Pt = 0.25, increased the citral conversion values."
[5] "The onset of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after the reduction process is proposed to explain the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts."

The research focused on developing a new type of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria. These catalysts were tested in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral after reduction at both low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperatures. The study revealed that reduction treatment at 773 K significantly reduced the CO adsorption capacity across all cases, with this loss being more pronounced in monometallic catalysts. Monometallic Pt/CeO2/C catalyst showed the highest activity after reduction at 473 K, whereas the presence of tin reduced its catalytic activity. However, when the reduction temperature was increased to 773 K, the monometallic catalyst exhibited a decrease in activity, while bimetallic catalysts, especially those with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25, saw an increase in citral conversion rates. The researchers proposed the formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after the reduction process to explain the enhanced activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts.

研究重点是开发了一种新型的双金属PtSn催化剂，这些催化剂被碳支持，并通过高分散的铈氧化物促进。这些催化剂在低温（473 K）和高温（773 K）下进行了液体相氢化柠檬醛的测试。研究发现，773 K下的还原处理显著降低了所有催化剂的CO吸附能力，其中单金属催化剂的损失更为明显。在473 K条件下，单金属Pt/CeO2/C催化剂显示出最高的活性，而添加锡则降低了其催化活性。然而，在将还原温度提高到773 K时，单金属催化剂的活性降低，而双金属催化剂，尤其是Sn/Pt比例为0.25的催化剂，提高了柠檬醛转化率。研究人员提出，在还原过程之后形成新的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点可以解释双金属催化剂的活性和选择性的增加。

Comparing and contrasting noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins involves several factors including their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages.

The noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, are renowned for their high efficiency in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum possesses unique electronic properties that enable it to effectively activate the olefin molecules, facilitating the hydrogenation process. However, Platinum alone might suffer from high costs and limited stability, particularly in the presence of sulfur compounds or in harsh operating conditions.

Metal oxide-based catalysts offer a cost-effective alternative to noble metals. For instance, CrOx catalysts are widely used in industrial processes due to their high stability and resistance to poisoning by sulfur compounds. Gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are also utilized, each with distinct properties suited for specific applications. For example, vanadium oxides are known for their ability to withstand high temperatures and pressures, making them suitable for harsh environments.

Recent developments in this field include the design of supported catalysts, where metals are deposited onto various supports to improve stability, reduce sintering, and optimize the active site distribution. The use of nanotechnology has enabled the creation of highly dispersed metal nanoparticles, enhancing the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

Advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts include their lower cost, better resistance to poisoning, and higher stability under harsh conditions. Noble metal catalysts, on the other hand, offer superior selectivity and activity, but at the expense of higher costs and potential instability issues.

In summary, while noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, excel in terms of activity and selectivity, metal oxide-based catalysts provide cost-effective alternatives with enhanced stability and resistance to poisoning. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the industrial application, such as the desired product yield, operational conditions, and cost considerations.

比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）涉及到几个因素，包括它们的组成、效率、工业应用、最新发展以及潜在优势。

贵金属基催化剂，尤其是铂，因其在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的高效性而闻名。铂具有独特的电子性质，能够有效激活烯烃分子，促进氢化过程。然而，铂本身可能面临高昂的成本和在硫化合物或苛刻操作条件下的稳定性问题。

金属氧化物基催化剂提供了贵金属的低成本替代品。例如，CrOx催化剂广泛应用于工业过程中，因其高稳定性和对硫化合物中毒的抵抗力而受到欢迎。镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物也被使用，每种氧化物都有其特定的应用特性。例如，钒氧化物因其能够承受高温和高压的能力而适合在恶劣环境中使用。

近年来，这一领域的最新发展包括设计支持催化剂，其中金属沉积在各种支持材料上以改善稳定性、减少烧结并优化活性位点分布。纳米技术的应用使高度分散的金属纳米颗粒得以创造，从而增强催化剂的活性和选择性。

金属氧化物基催化剂的优点包括更低的成本、更好的抗中毒能力和更高的在苛刻条件下的稳定性。相比之下，贵金属催化剂在活动性和选择性方面表现出色，但成本更高，并且可能存在稳定性问题。

简而言之，虽然贵金属基催化剂，尤其是铂，以其活动性和选择性而著称，但金属氧化物基催化剂提供了成本效益更高的替代品，具有增强的稳定性和抗中毒能力。根据具体的应用要求，如所需产品产率、操作条件和成本考虑，选择这两种催化剂之一。
