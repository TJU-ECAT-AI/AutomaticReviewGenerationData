[1] "A novel kind of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria were prepared by a co-impregnation method and tested in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral after reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperatures."
[2] "Ceria reducibility was increased with tin addition."
[3] "After reduction at high temperature (773 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity."
[4] "Reduction at 773 K increased the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) in all cases, although bimetallic catalysts showed higher values than the monometallic sample."

This study focused on the development of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with ceria. The catalysts were assessed for citral hydrogenation at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperatures. Ceria reducibility was enhanced with the addition of tin. At low reduction temperatures, the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C catalyst was the most active, whereas tin addition reduced its activity. Upon high temperature reduction, the monometallic catalyst showed decreased activity, while bimetallic catalysts exhibited increased conversion rates. High temperature reduction led to an improvement in the selectivity for unsaturated alcohols in all cases, with bimetallic catalysts displaying higher selectivity than monometallic counterparts.

本研究专注于开发一种由碳支持的双金属铂锡催化剂，并通过浸渍方法促进表面分散的氧化铈。这些催化剂用于液体相氢化柠檬醛，在低温（473 K）和高温（773 K）下进行评估。随着锡的添加，氧化铈的可还原性得到了提高。在较低还原温度下，单金属Pt/CeO2/C催化剂表现出最高活性，而锡的添加降低了其活性。在高温还原后，单金属催化剂的活性降低，而双金属催化剂的转化率增加。高温还原提高了所有催化剂中不饱和醇的选择性，而双金属催化剂的选择性高于单金属催化剂。
