[1] "Noble metal catalysts supported on partially reducible oxides such as CeO2 present, under certain conditions, the strong metalsupport interaction effect (SMSI) [1]."
[2] "The origin of this effect of the activation temperature on the catalytic properties of the metal active phase has been related to its interaction with particles of partially reduced oxide placed at the metalsupport interface."
[3] "The combined effect of two promoters (cerium oxide and tin) on the catalytic properties of platinum in the selective hydrogenation of unsat- urated aldehydes has received a very scarce attention [7,12,13]."
[4] "In this work, we pretend to further investigate the combined effect of two promoters (cerium oxide and tin) on the catalytic properties of platinum in the selective hydrogenation of unsat- urated aldehydes."
[5] "After reduction at low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity."
[6] "Reduction at high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in the case of monometallic sample while bimetallic catalysts,specially the one with Sn/Pt = 0.25, increased the citral conversion values."
[7] "Reduction at 773 K also increased selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) of bimetallic samples, which presented in all cases higher values than their monometallic counterpart."

This study focuses on the combined effect of cerium oxide and tin as promoters for platinum catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes, particularly citral. It explores how these promoters influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity under different reduction temperatures. The results highlight the importance of the reduction temperature and the promoter composition in enhancing the catalytic properties for selective hydrogenation processes.
