[1] "A novel kind of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria were prepared by a co-impregnation method and tested in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral after reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperatures."
[2] "Reduction treatment at 773 K also increased selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) of bimetallic samples, which presented in all cases higher values than their monometallic counterpart."
[3] "The presence of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after reduction at high temperature is proposed to explain the increase in activity and selectivity for bimetallic catalysts."

The study focused on developing a unique type of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria. These catalysts were tested in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral after reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperatures. The research demonstrated that reduction at 773 K enhanced the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols in bimetallic samples compared to their monometallic counterparts. The increase in activity and selectivity for bimetallic catalysts was attributed to the formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after high-temperature reduction.

研究专注于开发一种独特的双金属PtSn催化剂，这些催化剂支持在碳上并用高度分散的铈氧化物促进。这些催化剂在473 K和773 K的低温下测试了液体相氢化柠檬醛的效果。研究表明，在773 K的温度下，二元催化剂对不饱和醇的选择性比单一金属催化剂高。活性和选择性的增加被归因于在高温还原后形成的新的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点。
