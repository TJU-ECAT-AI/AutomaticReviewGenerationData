1. Noble metal catalysts supported on CeO2 exhibit the strong metal-support interaction effect (SMSI), which affects the catalytic properties of the metal phase, particularly at high temperatures. The origin of this effect is attributed to the interaction of the metal with partially reduced oxide particles at the metal-support interface.

2. The addition of a second more electropositive metal to the catalyst formulation can similarly enhance the catalyst's performance in the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes.

3. Reducible supports are not the sole strategy for improving catalyst selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols in noble metal supported catalysts.

4. This research aims to explore the combined impact of cerium oxide and tin as promoters on the catalytic properties of platinum for the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes.

5. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms for the carbon and ceria-supported materials, as well as the PtSn/ceria-on-carbon catalysts, were determined.

6. X-ray diffraction patterns for the ceria-supported material and the PtSn/ceria-on-carbon catalysts were obtained.

7. Temperature-programmed reduction profiles for the ceria-supported material and the PtSn/ceria-on-carbon catalysts were measured.

8. Transmission electron microscopy images of the Pt/ceria-on-carbon catalyst were captured.

9. Room temperature CO chemisorption isotherms for the studied catalysts were measured.

10. Citral conversion rates over time for the catalysts reduced at 473K were assessed.

11. The effect of the reduction temperature on the selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols was evaluated.
