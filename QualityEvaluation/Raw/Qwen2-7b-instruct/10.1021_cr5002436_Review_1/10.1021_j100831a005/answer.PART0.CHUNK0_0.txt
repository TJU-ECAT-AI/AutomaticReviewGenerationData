[1] "The adsorption results on fresh, sintered and reactivated catalyst are interpreted by assuming (1) the existence of two types of platinum aggregation-monolayer for impregnated catalyst, pseudo-spherical for cogelled catalyst, and (2) that Hz is adsorbed as atoms at the surface interstices between platinum atoms."
[2] "It has been of interest to this laboratory to study the nature of platinum supported on alumina, in the concentration range appropriate for a re-forming catalyst."
[3] "Measurements were then made on platinum foil with a BET surface area of 2.0 mS2."
[4] "It is concluded,therefore. that at least on some faces two H atoms are adsorbed for each surface Pt atom."
[5] "We believe this to be the case for impregnated catalysts."
[6] "We feel that the dimensional values obtained for fresh and sintered catalyst have a real physical significance."
[7] "Considerations of energetics would rule out the possibility of a plaiiiium particle o f over 200 A. dissociating into 20 A. particles as might be indicated for the cogelled catalyst con- taining 0,30y0 Pt."

The document compares and contrasts noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition of the noble metal catalysts is described as being supported on alumina, while metal oxide catalysts are mentioned without specific details. The effectiveness of noble metal catalysts is highlighted through their adsorption characteristics, which are influenced by factors such as sintering, regeneration, and the preparation method (impregnation vs. cogellation). The document discusses the role of platinum in hydrogen adsorption, suggesting that finely divided platinum is more efficient in hydrogen adsorption than bulk platinum. The adsorption data is interpreted based on assumptions about the arrangement of platinum on the surface of the catalyst, distinguishing between monolayer and aggregated types. The effectiveness of the catalysts is also linked to their particle size, which is determined through both adsorption measurements and X-ray line-broadening techniques. The document notes that the adsorption data on sintered catalysts indicates a decrease in particle size, possibly due to disruptions caused by oxygen atoms. Industrial applications of these catalysts are not detailed, but the focus is on understanding their physical nature and performance characteristics. Recent developments in the field are not covered in the provided text. Potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation are inferred from their ability to maintain a steady state level of exposed platinum sites, which is believed to be crucial for maintaining activity levels in the presence of coke deposits.

本文比较和对比了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中使用的贵金属基催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）。贵金属催化剂的组成被描述为在氧化铝上支持，而关于金属氧化物催化剂的具体细节没有提及。该文档强调了贵金属催化剂的有效性，通过它们的吸附特性来体现，这些特性受到诸如烧结、再生以及制备方法（浸渍与凝聚）的影响。文中讨论了铂在氢吸附中的作用，表明了细分散的铂对于氢吸附比块状铂更有效。吸附数据的解释基于对催化剂表面铂排列方式的假设，区分了单层和聚集类型。催化剂的尺寸有效性也与通过吸附测量和X射线线宽扩展技术确定的尺寸相关联。文档指出，烧结催化剂上的吸附数据表明颗粒尺寸的减少，这可能归因于氧原子造成的破坏。工业应用领域没有详细说明，而是集中在理解催化剂的物理性质和性能特征。该领域的最近发展未在提供的文本中涵盖。这些催化剂在非氧化脱氢领域的潜在优势从维持存在焦炭沉积物时必要的稳定状态暴露铂位点的能力中可以推断出来。
