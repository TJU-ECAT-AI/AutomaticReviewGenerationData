[1] "Two types of platinum-alumina reforming catalysts, impregnated and cogelled, have been examined by means of HI adsorption and X-ray line-broadening techniques."

[3] "The adsorption results on fresh, sintered and reactivated catalyst are interpreted by assuming (1) the existence of two types o f platinum aggregation-monolayer for impregnated catalyst, pseudo-spherical for cogelled catalyst, and (2) that Hz is ad- sorbed as atoms at the surface interstices between platinum atoms."

The study examines two types of platinum-alumina reforming catalysts: impregnated and cogelled. These catalysts undergo examination in their fresh, coked, regenerated, mildly sintered, severely sintered, and reactivated states. The adsorption of H₂ is found to be independent of platinum concentration. For interpreting adsorption measurements in relation to platinum crystallite size, adsorption on pure platinum of known surface area is measured. The adsorption of H₂ is assumed to occur as atoms at the surface interstices between platinum atoms. There are two types of platinum aggregation: monolayer for impregnated catalysts and pseudo-spherical for cogelled catalysts. The adsorption process is analyzed considering the probable mode of hydrogen adsorption on platinum, which is primarily as atoms. On a hexagonal face, two such sites exist per atom, ignoring edge effects. For impregnated catalysts, the adsorption process is believed to occur similarly.

该研究考察了两种铂基氧化铝重整催化剂：浸渍型和凝聚型。这些催化剂在新鲜、焦化、再生、轻微烧结、严重烧结和重新活化后进行检查。发现氢吸附与铂浓度无关。为了将吸附测量结果与铂晶粒尺寸联系起来，需要测量具有已知表面积的纯铂的吸附量。假设氢吸附于铂表面间隙中的原子形式存在。对于浸渍型催化剂，存在两种铂聚合物：单层聚合物和伪球形聚合物。氢吸附过程被分析为考虑铂上氢吸附的可能模式，即主要以原子形式。在六边形面上，忽略边缘效应，每原子有两处这样的位置。对于浸渍型催化剂，吸附过程被认为与之相似。

Answer: 比较和对比了非氧化脱氢轻烯烃过程中使用到的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）与金属氧化物基催化剂（如铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）。讨论它们的组成、效率、工业应用、最新进展及其在该领域的潜在优势。

回答：该文献研究了两种铂基氧化铝重整催化剂：浸渍型和凝聚型。这些催化剂在新鲜、焦化、再生、轻微烧结、严重烧结和重新活化后进行了评估。氢吸附与铂浓度无关。为了解释吸附测量结果与铂晶粒尺寸的关系，需要测量具有已知表面积的纯铂的吸附量。假设氢吸附于铂表面间隙中的原子形式存在。对于浸渍型催化剂，存在两种铂聚合物：单层聚合物和伪球形聚合物。氢吸附过程被分析为考虑铂上氢吸附的可能模式，即主要以原子形式。在六边形面上，忽略边缘效应，每原子有两处这样的位置。对于浸渍型催化剂，吸附过程被认为与之相似。
