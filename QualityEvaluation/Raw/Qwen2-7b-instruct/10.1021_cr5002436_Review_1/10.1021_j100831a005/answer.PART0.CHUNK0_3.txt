The literature focuses on the examination of two types of platinum-alumina reforming catalysts, impregnated and cogelled, using HI adsorption and X-ray line-broadening techniques. The catalysts were tested in various states including fresh, coked, regenerated, mildly and severely sintered, and reactivated. The adsorption results were interpreted considering the two types of platinum aggregation-monolayer for impregnated catalysts, and a pseudo-spherical structure for cogelled catalysts. The literature also discusses the adsorption of H₂ as atoms at the surface interstices between platinum atoms. Platinum particle sizes were derived, showing good agreement with X-ray line-broadening values. The adsorption of H₂ per gram of platinum was found to be independent of platinum concentration within the investigated catalyst groups. The effect of steaming and oxygen treatment on catalysts is evident from Table I. The adsorption results on platinum foil with a BET surface area of 2.0 m² were 0.135 and 0.133 cc (STP)/m², in agreement with Boreskov and Karnaukhov's findings on sintered platinum sponge. However, these results do not apply to the catalysts under study.

文献主要关注了两种铂铝氧化物重整催化剂，浸渍和凝聚型，通过HI吸附和X射线线宽扩展技术进行研究。催化剂在原始、焦化、再生、轻度烧结、严重烧结以及经过两次烧结水平后重新激活的状态下进行了测试。吸附结果通过假设浸渍催化剂存在两种类型的铂聚合单层，浸渍型为单层结构，凝聚型为类球形结构，并且认为氢作为原子在铂原子之间的表面间隙被吸附来解释。文献还讨论了氢在铂原子之间的吸附过程。铂颗粒大小的计算与X射线线宽扩展值相吻合。每克铂的氢吸附量在所研究的催化剂组内不受铂浓度的影响。蒸气处理和氧气处理对催化剂的影响从表I中可以看出。铂箔的BET表面积为2.0 m²时的吸附量分别为0.135和0.133 cc（STP）/m²，这与Boreskov和Karnaukhov在250摄氏度和相同压力下对烧结铂海绵的吸附量一致。然而，这些结果并不适用于正在研究的催化剂。
