The document compares and contrasts noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition of the noble metal catalysts is described as being supported on alumina, while metal oxide catalysts are mentioned without specific details. The effectiveness of noble metal catalysts is highlighted through their adsorption characteristics, which are influenced by factors such as sintering, regeneration, and the preparation method (impregnation vs. cogellation). The document discusses the role of platinum in hydrogen adsorption, suggesting that finely divided platinum is more efficient in hydrogen adsorption than bulk platinum. The adsorption data is interpreted based on assumptions about the arrangement of platinum on the surface of the catalyst, distinguishing between monolayer and aggregated types. The effectiveness of the catalysts is also linked to their particle size, which is determined through both adsorption measurements and X-ray line-broadening techniques. The document notes that the adsorption data on sintered catalysts indicates a decrease in particle size, possibly due to disruptions caused by oxygen atoms. Industrial applications of these catalysts are not detailed, but the focus is on understanding their physical nature and performance characteristics. Recent developments in the field are not covered in the provided text. Potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation are inferred from their ability to maintain a steady state level of exposed platinum sites, which is believed to be crucial for maintaining activity levels in the presence of coke deposits.

本文比较和对比了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中使用的贵金属基催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）。贵金属催化剂的组成被描述为在氧化铝上支持，而关于金属氧化物催化剂的具体细节没有提及。该文档强调了贵金属催化剂的有效性，通过它们的吸附特性来体现，这些特性受到诸如烧结、再生以及制备方法（浸渍与凝聚）的影响。文中讨论了铂在氢吸附中的作用，表明了细分散的铂对于氢吸附比块状铂更有效。吸附数据的解释基于对催化剂表面铂排列方式的假设，区分了单层和聚集类型。催化剂的尺寸有效性也与通过吸附测量和X射线线宽扩展技术确定的尺寸相关联。文档指出，烧结催化剂上的吸附数据表明颗粒尺寸的减少，这可能归因于氧原子造成的破坏。工业应用领域没有详细说明，而是集中在理解催化剂的物理性质和性能特征。该领域的最近发展未在提供的文本中涵盖。这些催化剂在非氧化脱氢领域的潜在优势从维持存在焦炭沉积物时必要的稳定状态暴露铂位点的能力中可以推断出来。

The study examines two types of platinum-alumina reforming catalysts: impregnated and cogelled. These catalysts undergo examination in their fresh, coked, regenerated, mildly sintered, severely sintered, and reactivated states. The adsorption of H₂ is found to be independent of platinum concentration. For interpreting adsorption measurements in relation to platinum crystallite size, adsorption on pure platinum of known surface area is measured. The adsorption of H₂ is assumed to occur as atoms at the surface interstices between platinum atoms. There are two types of platinum aggregation: monolayer for impregnated catalysts and pseudo-spherical for cogelled catalysts. The adsorption process is analyzed considering the probable mode of hydrogen adsorption on platinum, which is primarily as atoms. On a hexagonal face, two such sites exist per atom, ignoring edge effects. For impregnated catalysts, the adsorption process is believed to occur similarly.

1. The literature examines two types of platinum-alumina reforming catalysts, impregnated and cogelled, using HI adsorption and X-ray line-broadening techniques. The catalysts undergo various treatments, including fresh, coked, regenerated, mildly and severely sintered, and reactivated states. The adsorption results are interpreted based on the type of platinum aggregation-monolayer present in the catalysts and the manner in which hydrogen is adsorbed onto the surface interstices between platinum atoms.

2. The paper discusses the application of adsorption techniques by Boreskov and I<arnaukhov to study platinum supported on silica gel, employing hydrogen as the adsorbate. It also mentions the recent use of hydrogen adsorption by Spenadel and Boudart to study Pt-A1203 catalysts, whose findings align with those presented in the paper.

3. The results obtained from comparing adsorption data with X-ray line-broadening measurements indicate a general agreement in determining platinum particle dimensions, even when the adsorption data suggest that particles are too small to be visible via X-ray techniques. The dimensional values derived for fresh and sintered catalysts are considered physically significant.

4. The paper argues that the dimensional values obtained for fresh and sintered catalysts reflect real physical properties, whereas the results from reactivated catalysts should not be interpreted as indicating a decrease in platinum particle size.

5. Weisell's observation that only a minimal level of dehydrogenation activity is needed to achieve normal total activity supports the interpretation of the adsorption data on reactivated catalysts.

1. 文献研究了两种铂铝氧化物重整催化剂，浸渍和凝胶化类型，使用HI吸附和X射线谱线展宽技术。催化剂经历了新鲜、焦化、再生、轻微烧结、严重烧结和重新活化等处理状态。吸附结果基于催化剂中铂的聚合单层类型进行解释，并且氢原子在铂原子表面间隙处吸附的方式。

2. 论文提到Boreskov和I<arnaukhov使用氢作为吸附剂对支持在硅胶上的铂进行了吸附技术的应用。它还提到了Spenadel和Boudart最近对Pt-A1203催化剂使用氢吸附的研究，他们的结论与论文中提出的一致。

3. 通过比较吸附数据与X射线谱线展宽测量的结果，发现确定铂颗粒尺寸存在一致的迹象，即使吸附数据表明颗粒太小而无法通过X射线技术观察到也是如此。对于新鲜和烧结催化剂得到的尺寸值被认为是物理上重要的。

4. 论文认为，新鲜和烧结催化剂得到的尺寸值反映了真实的物理性质，而重新活化催化剂的结果不应被解释为铂颗粒尺寸的减少。

5. Weisell的观察指出，只有最小的脱氢活性是产生正常总活性所必需的，这支持了对重新活化催化剂吸附数据的解释。

The literature focuses on the examination of two types of platinum-alumina reforming catalysts, impregnated and cogelled, using HI adsorption and X-ray line-broadening techniques. The catalysts were tested in various states including fresh, coked, regenerated, mildly and severely sintered, and reactivated. The adsorption results were interpreted considering the two types of platinum aggregation-monolayer for impregnated catalysts, and a pseudo-spherical structure for cogelled catalysts. The literature also discusses the adsorption of H₂ as atoms at the surface interstices between platinum atoms. Platinum particle sizes were derived, showing good agreement with X-ray line-broadening values. The adsorption of H₂ per gram of platinum was found to be independent of platinum concentration within the investigated catalyst groups. The effect of steaming and oxygen treatment on catalysts is evident from Table I. The adsorption results on platinum foil with a BET surface area of 2.0 m² were 0.135 and 0.133 cc (STP)/m², in agreement with Boreskov and Karnaukhov's findings on sintered platinum sponge. However, these results do not apply to the catalysts under study.

文献主要关注了两种铂铝氧化物重整催化剂，浸渍和凝聚型，通过HI吸附和X射线线宽扩展技术进行研究。催化剂在原始、焦化、再生、轻度烧结、严重烧结以及经过两次烧结水平后重新激活的状态下进行了测试。吸附结果通过假设浸渍催化剂存在两种类型的铂聚合单层，浸渍型为单层结构，凝聚型为类球形结构，并且认为氢作为原子在铂原子之间的表面间隙被吸附来解释。文献还讨论了氢在铂原子之间的吸附过程。铂颗粒大小的计算与X射线线宽扩展值相吻合。每克铂的氢吸附量在所研究的催化剂组内不受铂浓度的影响。蒸气处理和氧气处理对催化剂的影响从表I中可以看出。铂箔的BET表面积为2.0 m²时的吸附量分别为0.135和0.133 cc（STP）/m²，这与Boreskov和Karnaukhov在250摄氏度和相同压力下对烧结铂海绵的吸附量一致。然而，这些结果并不适用于正在研究的催化剂。

1. The literature discusses two types of platinum-alumina reforming catalysts: impregnated and cogelled. These catalysts were tested using HI adsorption and X-ray line-broadening techniques. The catalysts were examined in various states: fresh, coked, regenerated, mildly sintered, severely sintered, and reactivated. Adsorption was observed to decrease when coke was deposited in a naphtha reforming reactor. After a thorough burn-off of the coke, the adsorption was restored to at least half of its initial level. Mild sintering led to a significant decrease in adsorption, which was partially recovered after reactivation under high oxygen pressure. Severe sintering at one atmosphere of steam caused a decrease in adsorption that was largely irreversible despite reactivation attempts. The study aimed to understand the nature of platinum supported on alumina, particularly in the concentration range suitable for reforming catalysts. Surface area determination for catalyst components was previously conducted by Emmett and Brunauer using carbon monoxide adsorption, and later by the same method for cobalt on kieselguhr and nickel on aluminum oxide. The results for a particular sample suggested a bimodal particle-size distribution, with one mode being undetectable by X-ray techniques. The energetic considerations excluded the possibility of a platinum particle exceeding 200 A. breaking into 20 A. particles, as indicated in a cogelled catalyst with 0.30% Pt. Coking reduced hydrogen adsorption, but subsequent regeneration nearly restored it to the original level for most catalysts.

1. 文献探讨了两种铂铝催化剂：浸渍和胶化。这些催化剂通过HI吸附和X射线谱线展宽技术进行了测试。催化剂在新鲜、焦化、再生、轻微烧结、严重烧结和重新活化后进行了检查。发现焦炭沉积在轻烯烃重整反应器中会显著降低吸附。彻底清除焦炭后，吸附恢复到原始水平的一半以上。轻微烧结导致大量吸附下降，在高氧压下重新活化部分恢复。严重烧结在1大气压蒸汽下导致吸附量大幅减少，即使尝试重新活化也无法逆转。研究旨在了解铂在氧化铝上的支持性质，特别是在重整催化剂适用的浓度范围内。铁在促进氨合成催化剂上的表面面积测定由埃米特和布鲁纳尔先前通过一氧化碳吸附完成，并且后来通过相同方法对钴在硅藻土和镍在氧化铝上的应用。该样本结果表明存在双模颗粒尺寸分布，其中一种模式无法通过X射线技术检测。能量考虑排除了超过200 A.的铂粒子分解成20 A.粒子的可能性，这在含0.30% Pt的胶化催化剂中被指出。焦炭降低了氢吸附，但后续再生几乎完全恢复到原始水平，适用于大多数催化剂。
