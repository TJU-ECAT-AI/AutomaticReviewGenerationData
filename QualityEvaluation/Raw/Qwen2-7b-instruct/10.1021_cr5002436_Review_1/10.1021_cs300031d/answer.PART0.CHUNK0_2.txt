The comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, notably platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals significant distinctions in their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent advancements, and potential benefits. Platinum-based catalysts are recognized for their superior activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes. In contrast, metal oxide-based catalysts offer a more affordable option with performance parity. Recent developments focus on enhancing catalyst composition and support materials for improved stability and a wider operational temperature range. The potential advantages of these metal oxide catalysts include a reduced environmental footprint and broader applicability.
