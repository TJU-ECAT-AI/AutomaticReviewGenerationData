The comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, notably Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals several key differences. Noble metals like Platinum are renowned for their high activity and selectivity, leading to efficient conversion rates and product yields. In contrast, metal oxides such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are favored for their cost-effectiveness, enhanced stability, and resistance to sintering. Recent developments have aimed at merging the benefits of both categories to create catalysts with superior performance. These catalysts find extensive use in the petrochemical industry, significantly impacting refining processes.
