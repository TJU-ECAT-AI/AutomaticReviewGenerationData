Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, are effective in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high activity and stability. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been explored but generally show lower activity and selectivity. Recent developments aim to enhance the performance of these catalysts through various modifications. The continuous search for more efficient and eco-friendly catalysts represents an ongoing challenge in the field.

在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的过程中，特别是铂基催化剂表现出高效性和稳定性，因此特别有效。金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已被研究，但通常显示出较低的活性和目标产物的选择性。近期的发展旨在通过合金化、掺杂和结构修改来提高这些催化剂的性能。持续寻找更高效且环保的催化剂仍然是该领域的一个活跃研究方向。
