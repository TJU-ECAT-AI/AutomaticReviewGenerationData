The comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins involves their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. Noble metals like platinum are recognized for their high activity and selectivity, while metal oxides, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are valued for their cost-effectiveness and stability. Recent advancements include the use of noble metals on metal oxide supports to improve catalyst performance. Studies indicate that noble metal-based catalysts typically provide higher conversion efficiency but may demand more stringent operating conditions. Metal oxide-based catalysts, however, are more resilient to impurities and display superior thermal stability.
