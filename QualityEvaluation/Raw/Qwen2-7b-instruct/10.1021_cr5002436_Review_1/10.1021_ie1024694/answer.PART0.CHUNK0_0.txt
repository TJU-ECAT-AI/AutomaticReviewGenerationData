Noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are both utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metal-based catalysts are renowned for their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, making them ideal for various industrial applications. Metal oxide-based catalysts, however, are appreciated for their robustness and resistance to poisoning under harsh reaction conditions. Recent advancements in catalyst design have aimed to enhance stability, activity, and selectivity, leading to more efficient catalysts. In comparison, noble metal-based catalysts generally exhibit higher efficiency and better selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts are more stable and less susceptible to deactivation.

在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的过程中，贵金属基催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）都被应用。贵金属基催化剂以其在脱氢反应中的高活性和选择性而著称，使其适合于各种工业应用。相比之下，金属氧化物基催化剂因其在恶劣反应条件下对中毒的抵抗性和耐久性而受到赞赏。近年来，催化剂设计的进步集中在提高稳定性和选择性上，这导致了更高效的催化剂的开发。与之相比，贵金属基催化剂通常具有更高的效率和更好的选择性，而金属氧化物基催化剂则更加稳定且不易失效。
