Noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are both utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metal-based catalysts are renowned for their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, making them ideal for various industrial applications. Metal oxide-based catalysts, however, are appreciated for their robustness and resistance to poisoning under harsh reaction conditions. Recent advancements in catalyst design have aimed to enhance stability, activity, and selectivity, leading to more efficient catalysts. In comparison, noble metal-based catalysts generally exhibit higher efficiency and better selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts are more stable and less susceptible to deactivation.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, these catalysts exhibit distinct characteristics and performance. Noble metals like platinum are renowned for their high reactivity and selectivity, often leading to efficient conversion rates in chemical reactions. However, they can be expensive and susceptible to poisoning under certain conditions. On the other hand, metal oxides offer a more cost-effective alternative due to their abundance and stability. They can be tailored through various synthesis methods to achieve desired properties for specific applications. Recent developments have focused on enhancing the activity and stability of both types of catalysts, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact. While noble metals may offer superior catalytic activity, metal oxides show promise in terms of cost-effectiveness and scalability, making them attractive for industrial applications.
