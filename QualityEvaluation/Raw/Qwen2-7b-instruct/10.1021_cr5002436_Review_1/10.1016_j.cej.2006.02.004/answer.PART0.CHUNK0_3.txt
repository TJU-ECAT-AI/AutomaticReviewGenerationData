<p>Results show that when the Na content added to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases, different effects are observed: (1) the initial conversion decreases, (2) the deac- tivation parameter also decreases, and (3) the selectivity (both initial and final) tends to increase.</p>
<p>The lower deactivation capacity of Pt/Al2O3Na catalysts, with respect to the undoped sample, could be attributed to the presence of the alkali metal in the vicinity of the noble metal with the subsequent diminution of coke deposited on the metallic phase.</p>
<p>Com- paring the Pt/Al2O3 sample with the Pt/Al2O3Na ones in pulse experiments, the following trend in stability (related to deactivation and carbon retention) of the catalyst with the increase of Na content in the catalyst was observed (see Figs. 3 and 5): Pt/Al2O3Na (2 wt.%) > Pt/Al2O3Na (1 wt.%) > Pt/Al2O3Na (0.5 wt.%) > Pt/Al2O3</p>
<p>The formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst, with the consequent catalyst deactivation, is produced by the polymer- ization of the olefins formed during the dehydrogenation. The polymerization reaction is catalyzed both by acid and metallic sites. In the last case (catalysis by the metallic function) the reac- tion behaves as a demanding one and it is carried out on the same type of sites as the hydrogenolysis, thus, requiring determined ensembles of Pt atoms.</p>
<p>Results indicate that there is a certain modification in S1-B/S2-B ratio when the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is doped with increasing Na concentrations. The modification of the S1-B/S2-B ratio was also observed in the pulse experiments, which give information about the first stage of the reaction, such as it was observed in Fig. 7.</p>

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins differ in their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. Platinum catalysts are known for their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes. Metal oxide catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer a different set of properties based on their specific compositions. These metal oxides can have varying degrees of acidity and basicity, influencing their reactivity towards olefin dehydrogenation. Industrial applications of these catalysts depend on the specific requirements of the process, such as desired product distribution, reaction conditions, and cost-effectiveness. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst stability, reducing deactivation, and enhancing selectivity towards desired products. Potential advantages of using these catalysts include their ability to operate under mild conditions, broad substrate compatibility, and the possibility of tuning their properties through modification with other elements. The document specifically discusses how the addition of sodium to platinum catalysts modifies the acidic and metallic functions, reduces deactivation caused by carbon deposition, and affects the ratio of 1-butene to 2-butenes, indicating improved selectivity in the dehydrogenation process.
