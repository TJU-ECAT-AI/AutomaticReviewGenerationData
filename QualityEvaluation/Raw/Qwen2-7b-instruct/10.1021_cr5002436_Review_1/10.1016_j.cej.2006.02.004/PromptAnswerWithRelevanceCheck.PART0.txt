[1] "The addition of increasing amounts of Na to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst modifies both the nature of the acid function (by poisoning the stronger acid sites) and the metallic phase (by a geometric modification the metallic phase). These modifications would be the responsible for the sharp diminution of deactivation of the catalysts due to the carbon deposition."
[2] "Na addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts inhibits the formation of coke deposited on the metallic sites and the support."
[3] "The formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst, with the consequent catalyst deactivation, is produced by the polymerization of the olefins formed during the dehydrogenation. The polymerization reaction is catalyzed both by acid and metallic sites."
[4] "Results indicate that there is a certain modification in S1-B/S2-B ratio when the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is doped with increasing Na concentrations. The modification of the S1-B/S2-B ratio was also observed in the pulse experiments,which give information about the first stage of the reaction."

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins exhibit distinct characteristics, compositions, and industrial applications. Platinum catalysts are known for their high activity in dehydrogenation reactions due to their ability to facilitate hydrogen removal from hydrocarbons. On the other hand, metal oxide catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are typically employed for their acidic functionalities, which are crucial for catalyzing dehydrogenation reactions by breaking chemical bonds.

In terms of effectiveness, Platinum catalysts are highly effective in converting light olefins to shorter hydrocarbons and alkanes. They offer a bifunctional mechanism, combining both the acidic and metallic functionalities to enhance the yield of desired products. Metal oxide catalysts, particularly those with strong acidic sites, are adept at dehydrogenation reactions but may require additional treatments or additives to mitigate side reactions like cracking, isomerization, and polymerization.

Recent developments in this field include the incorporation of alkali metals like sodium (Na) into the catalyst structure. The addition of Na to Platinum catalysts leads to a geometric modification of the metallic phase, while poisoning the stronger acid sites of the metal oxide support. This results in a significant reduction of deactivation caused by carbon deposition, thereby enhancing the catalyst's performance and longevity. Additionally, the presence of alkali metals modifies the selectivity towards specific products, such as altering the ratio of 1-butene to 2-butenes, which is beneficial for optimizing the yield of desired olefinic compounds.

Potential advantages of these catalysts include improved efficiency, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation, making them suitable for various industrial applications in petrochemical processing, refining, and specialty chemical production. The use of metal oxide-based catalysts, especially those with tuned acidic properties, allows for better control over the reaction pathways, leading to higher yields of targeted products and reduced environmental impact.

In summary, the combination of noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts provides a versatile platform for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, offering tailored solutions for optimizing product distributions, improving reaction kinetics, and extending catalyst life. The integration of alkali metals further enhances the catalytic performance by addressing key challenges such as deactivation and selectivity tuning, making these systems attractive for both current and future applications in the chemical industry.

<p>Results show that when the Na content added to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases, different effects are observed: (1) the initial conversion decreases, (2) the deac- tivation parameter also decreases, and (3) the selectivity (both initial and final) tends to increase.</p>
<p>The lower deactivation capacity of Pt/Al2O3Na catalysts, with respect to the undoped sample, could be attributed to the presence of the alkali metal in the vicinity of the noble metal with the subsequent diminution of coke deposited on the metallic phase.</p>
<p>Com- paring the Pt/Al2O3 sample with the Pt/Al2O3Na ones in pulse experiments, the following trend in stability (related to deactivation and carbon retention) of the catalyst with the increase of Na content in the catalyst was observed (see Figs. 3 and 5): Pt/Al2O3Na (2 wt.%) > Pt/Al2O3Na (1 wt.%) > Pt/Al2O3Na (0.5 wt.%) > Pt/Al2O3</p>
<p>The formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst, with the consequent catalyst deactivation, is produced by the polymer- ization of the olefins formed during the dehydrogenation. The polymerization reaction is catalyzed both by acid and metallic sites. In the last case (catalysis by the metallic function) the reac- tion behaves as a demanding one and it is carried out on the same type of sites as the hydrogenolysis, thus, requiring determined ensembles of Pt atoms.</p>
<p>Results indicate that there is a certain modification in S1-B/S2-B ratio when the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is doped with increasing Na concentrations. The modification of the S1-B/S2-B ratio was also observed in the pulse experiments, which give information about the first stage of the reaction, such as it was observed in Fig. 7.</p>

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum (Pt) and metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the document focuses on the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts doped with sodium (Na). Platinum catalysts supported on alumina are effective for naphtha reforming and dehydrogenation of paraffins. The addition of sodium to these catalysts leads to a significant modification of both the acid and metallic functions. Specifically, the acid function becomes weaker due to poisoning of the stronger acid sites, while the metallic phase undergoes a geometric modification. This results in a reduction of deactivation caused by carbon deposition, as the catalyst structure changes to inhibit the formation of coke, particularly on the acid sites of the alumina. The doping of sodium also affects the selectivity ratio between 1-butene and 2-butenes, indicating a slight increase in isomerization efficiency on the metallic sites compared to undoped samples. The industrial application of these modified catalysts could lead to improved efficiency and selectivity in light olefin dehydrogenation processes.

比较铂（Pt）等贵金属基催化剂和氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，文献主要关注添加钠（Na）到Pt/Al2O3催化剂上的影响。铂基催化剂支持在氧化铝上，对于石脑油重整和低分子量烷烃的脱氢活性较高。向这些催化剂中添加钠会导致酸性和金属功能的显著改变。具体而言，酸性功能减弱，由于更强酸位被中毒，而金属相经历几何结构的改变。这导致碳沉积引起的失活降低，因为催化剂结构的变化抑制了酸位上形成的焦炭。钠的添加还影响了1-丁烯与2-丁烯选择性的比例，表明在金属位上相对于未掺杂样品对异构化效率略有提高。这些修改后的催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢过程中的工业应用可能会带来更高的效率和选择性。
