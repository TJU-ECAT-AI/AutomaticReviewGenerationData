[1] "Pt-based catalysts supported on alumina are active for naphtha reforming and for dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins [13]."
[2] "The addition of increasing amounts of Na to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst modifies both the nature of the acid function (by poisoning the stronger acid sites) and the metallic phase (by a geometric modification the metallic phase)."
[3] "These modifications in the catalyst structure by the effect of Na addition would cause the pronounced diminution of the ensembles for hydrogenolysis and carbon formation, thus,producing catalysts with a lower deactivation by coke deposition."
[4] "Two different types of coke are deposited on the alumina: a fraction deposited near to the metallic surface, and another one adsorbed on the support. Na addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts inhibits the formation of both types of coke, mainly that originated on the acid sites of the alumina, which are poisoned by the alkali metal."
[5] "There is a modification in the ratio between the selectivity to 1-butene and that of 2-butenes when Pt/Al2O3 is doped with increasing Na concentrations."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum (Pt) and metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the document focuses on the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts doped with sodium (Na). Platinum catalysts supported on alumina are effective for naphtha reforming and dehydrogenation of paraffins. The addition of sodium to these catalysts leads to a significant modification of both the acid and metallic functions. Specifically, the acid function becomes weaker due to poisoning of the stronger acid sites, while the metallic phase undergoes a geometric modification. This results in a reduction of deactivation caused by carbon deposition, as the catalyst structure changes to inhibit the formation of coke, particularly on the acid sites of the alumina. The doping of sodium also affects the selectivity ratio between 1-butene and 2-butenes, indicating a slight increase in isomerization efficiency on the metallic sites compared to undoped samples. The industrial application of these modified catalysts could lead to improved efficiency and selectivity in light olefin dehydrogenation processes.

比较铂（Pt）等贵金属基催化剂和氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，文献主要关注添加钠（Na）到Pt/Al2O3催化剂上的影响。铂基催化剂支持在氧化铝上，对于石脑油重整和低分子量烷烃的脱氢活性较高。向这些催化剂中添加钠会导致酸性和金属功能的显著改变。具体而言，酸性功能减弱，由于更强酸位被中毒，而金属相经历几何结构的改变。这导致碳沉积引起的失活降低，因为催化剂结构的变化抑制了酸位上形成的焦炭。钠的添加还影响了1-丁烯与2-丁烯选择性的比例，表明在金属位上相对于未掺杂样品对异构化效率略有提高。这些修改后的催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢过程中的工业应用可能会带来更高的效率和选择性。
