[1] "The addition of increasing amounts of Na to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst modifies both the nature of the acid function (by poisoning the stronger acid sites) and the metallic phase (by a geometric modification the metallic phase). These modifications would be the responsible for the sharp diminution of deactivation of the catalysts due to the carbon deposition."
[2] "Na addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts inhibits the formation of coke deposited on the metallic sites and the support."
[3] "The formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst, with the consequent catalyst deactivation, is produced by the polymerization of the olefins formed during the dehydrogenation. The polymerization reaction is catalyzed both by acid and metallic sites."
[4] "Results indicate that there is a certain modification in S1-B/S2-B ratio when the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is doped with increasing Na concentrations. The modification of the S1-B/S2-B ratio was also observed in the pulse experiments,which give information about the first stage of the reaction."

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins exhibit distinct characteristics, compositions, and industrial applications. Platinum catalysts are known for their high activity in dehydrogenation reactions due to their ability to facilitate hydrogen removal from hydrocarbons. On the other hand, metal oxide catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are typically employed for their acidic functionalities, which are crucial for catalyzing dehydrogenation reactions by breaking chemical bonds.

In terms of effectiveness, Platinum catalysts are highly effective in converting light olefins to shorter hydrocarbons and alkanes. They offer a bifunctional mechanism, combining both the acidic and metallic functionalities to enhance the yield of desired products. Metal oxide catalysts, particularly those with strong acidic sites, are adept at dehydrogenation reactions but may require additional treatments or additives to mitigate side reactions like cracking, isomerization, and polymerization.

Recent developments in this field include the incorporation of alkali metals like sodium (Na) into the catalyst structure. The addition of Na to Platinum catalysts leads to a geometric modification of the metallic phase, while poisoning the stronger acid sites of the metal oxide support. This results in a significant reduction of deactivation caused by carbon deposition, thereby enhancing the catalyst's performance and longevity. Additionally, the presence of alkali metals modifies the selectivity towards specific products, such as altering the ratio of 1-butene to 2-butenes, which is beneficial for optimizing the yield of desired olefinic compounds.

Potential advantages of these catalysts include improved efficiency, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation, making them suitable for various industrial applications in petrochemical processing, refining, and specialty chemical production. The use of metal oxide-based catalysts, especially those with tuned acidic properties, allows for better control over the reaction pathways, leading to higher yields of targeted products and reduced environmental impact.

In summary, the combination of noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts provides a versatile platform for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, offering tailored solutions for optimizing product distributions, improving reaction kinetics, and extending catalyst life. The integration of alkali metals further enhances the catalytic performance by addressing key challenges such as deactivation and selectivity tuning, making these systems attractive for both current and future applications in the chemical industry.

在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢反应中，贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，以及金属氧化物催化剂显示出不同的特性和应用。铂催化剂因其能够促进从碳氢化合物中去除氢的能力而高度有效，在脱氢反应中表现出高活性。另一方面，金属氧化物催化剂，包括CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，通常用于提供其酸性功能，这对于催化脱氢反应至关重要，通过破坏化学键来分解轻烯烃。

在有效性方面，铂催化剂在将轻烯烃转化为较短的碳氢化合物和烷烃方面非常有效。它们提供了双功能机制，结合酸性和金属功能，以增强所需产品的产率。金属氧化物催化剂，特别是具有强酸性位点的那些，对于脱氢反应特别有效，但可能需要额外处理或添加剂来抑制裂解、异构化和聚合等副反应。

近年来，这些领域的最新进展包括在催化剂结构中加入碱金属如钠（Na）。向铂催化剂中添加Na导致金属相的几何修改，同时毒害金属氧化物支持的更强酸位。这导致由碳沉积引起的催化剂失活显著减少，从而提高了催化剂的性能和使用寿命。此外，碱金属的存在改变了特定产物的选择性，例如改变1-丁烯与2-丁烯的比例，这对于优化目标产物的产率和提高选择性具有益处。

这些催化剂的优势可能包括提高效率、选择性和抗失活能力，使其适用于石油化学加工、精炼和特种化学品生产等各种工业应用。金属氧化物基催化剂，特别是具有调谐酸性性质的那些，允许更好地控制反应路径，从而获得目标产物的更高产率，并减少环境影响。

总之，贵金属基催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂的结合为轻烯烃非氧化脱氢提供了一个灵活的平台，提供了定制解决方案，以优化产品分布、改进反应动力学并延长催化剂寿命。通过集成碱金属进一步增强了催化剂的性能，解决了关键挑战，如失活和选择性调整，使这些系统对当前和未来应用具有吸引力，适用于化学工业。
