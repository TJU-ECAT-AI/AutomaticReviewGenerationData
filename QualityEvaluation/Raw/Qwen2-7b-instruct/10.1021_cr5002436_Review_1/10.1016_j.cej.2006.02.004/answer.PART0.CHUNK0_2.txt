[1] "The addition of increasing amounts of Na to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst modifies both the nature of the acid function (by poisoning the stronger acid sites) and the metallic phase (by a geometric modification the metallic phase)."
[2] "These modifications would be the responsible for the sharp diminution of deactivation of the catalysts due to the carbon deposition."
[3] "Na addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts inhibits the formation of coke deposited on the metallic sites and the support."
[4] "Results indicate that the Na on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts not only poisons the acid sites of the alumina but also produces a geometric modification of Pt sites as well, thus, decreasing the hydrogenolytic ensembles responsible for the coke deposition."
[5] "These important modifications in the catalyst structure by the Na addition would cause the pronounced diminution of the deactivation by the carbon deposition."

The document discusses the use of platinum (Pt) catalysts supported on aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and sodium (Na)-doped versions of the same for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light paraffins. The key findings include:

1. Sodium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts affects both the acidic and metallic functions, modifying the acid sites and the structure of the Pt phase.
2. This modification results in a significant reduction of catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition.
3. Sodium doping inhibits the formation of coke on both the metal and support surfaces.
4. Sodium causes a geometric alteration in the Pt sites, reducing the hydrogenolysis ensembles responsible for coke formation.
5. Overall, the introduction of sodium leads to a notable decrease in catalyst deactivation caused by carbon buildup.

文档讨论了铂（Pt）催化剂在铝氧化物（Al2O3）上以及钠（Na）掺杂版本对轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢的应用。关键发现包括：

1. 钠添加到Pt/Al2O3催化剂中会影响酸性和金属功能，修改酸性位点和Pt相结构。
2. 这种修改导致催化剂由于碳沉积而失活显著减少。
3. 钠掺杂抑制了金属表面和支撑表面上的焦炭形成。
4. 钠在Pt相中造成了几何上的改变，减少了负责焦炭形成的氢解合簇。
5. 总体而言，钠的引入导致由碳积累引起的催化剂失活显著减少。
