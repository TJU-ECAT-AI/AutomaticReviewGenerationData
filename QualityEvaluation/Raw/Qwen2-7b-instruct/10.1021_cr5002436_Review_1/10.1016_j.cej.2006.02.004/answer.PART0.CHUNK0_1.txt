The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts are effective in these processes, while metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer alternative options. The composition of these catalysts typically involves a metal component combined with an oxide or other supporting material. Industrial applications of these catalysts include the production of petrochemicals, particularly in the refining industry for the conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable olefinic compounds. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst stability, activity, and selectivity, especially in the context of dehydrogenation reactions. Potential advantages include higher efficiency, lower energy consumption, and reduced environmental impact. The document highlights the role of sodium (Na) doping in modifying both the acid and metallic functions of platinum on alumina catalysts, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and reduced deactivation by coke formation in the n-butane dehydrogenation process. This modification inhibits the formation of coke on both the metallic sites and the support, contributing to catalyst longevity and performance.

本文讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物催化剂的应用。铂基催化剂在这些过程中表现出高效性，而金属氧化物催化剂，如铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，提供替代选项。这些催化剂的组成通常涉及一种金属成分与氧化物或其他支持材料结合。这些催化剂在工业中的应用包括石油化学产品的生产，特别是在炼油行业中，用于将碳氢化合物转化为有价值的烯烃化合物。最近的发展集中在提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性，尤其是在脱氢反应的背景下。潜在的优势包括更高的效率、更低的能量消耗和减少对环境的影响。文档强调了钠（Na）掺杂在铂/氧化铝催化剂结构中修改酸性和金属功能的作用，导致在n-丁烷脱氢过程中提高了活性、选择性和减少了由焦炭形成引起的催化剂失活。这种修改抑制了焦炭在金属点和支撑上的形成，有助于催化剂的长期性能和表现。
