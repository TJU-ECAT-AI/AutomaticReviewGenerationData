1. The study focused on the impact of gallium (Ga) addition to platinum (Pt)/alumina (Al2O3) catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. 
2. Gallium addition improved the selectivity for propylene, decreased catalyst deactivation, and reduced carbon formation.
3. The Ga addition had a low effect on the acidity of the support but altered the structure of the metallic phase differently depending on the previous reduction temperature.
4. At a low reduction temperature (573 K), the Ga action was attributed to geometric effects only. At a higher temperature (773 K), Ga blocking and potentially electronic modification of Pt sites occurred.
5. The Ga addition led to a decrease in carbon deposition on the catalyst surface and an enhancement of propylene selectivity.
6. The Ga addition influenced the performance of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation process by modifying the structure of the metallic phase, affecting the selectivity and deactivation rates.
7. Gallium was found to have a smaller poisoning effect on the strong acid sites compared to lithium (Li).
8. The acidity of the support was slightly modified by the Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 and Al2O3.
9. Gallium addition enhanced the initial selectivity for propylene and reduced carbon retention during the dehydrogenation process.
10. The Ga addition had a minor effect on the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction rate, activation energy, and H2 adsorption capacity when samples were reduced at 573 K. This suggests that Ga could be intercalated between Pt atoms or deposited around Pt particles.

[4] "However, few papers have been reported in the literature about the performance and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 and modified by In or Ga for dehydrogenation processes, mainly for light paraffins [8-10]."
[5] "The catalytic performance of intimate mechanical mixtures (Pt/Al2O3Ga/Al2O3) was determined in order to understand the effect of Ga in these systems."
[6] "The Ga addition (up to 0.44 wt%) on the: (i) cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction rate, (ii) activation energy in the same reaction and (iii) H2 adsorption capacity, when the samples were reduced at 573 K, would indicate that the fraction of Ga in intimate contact with Pt could be either intercalated between Pt atoms or deposited in the periphery of the Pt particles."
[7] "However, the low decrease of the hydrogenolysis activity for samples with Ga0.44 wt%,previously reduced at 573 K, can be better explained by the predominance of the second effect, since the first one should lead to an important decrease of the concentration of Pt ensembles required for the CP hydrogenolysis reaction."
[8] "On the other hand, for Ga contents higher than 0.44 wt% in the bimetallic catalysts, results on both test reactions and H2 chemisorption would indicate that the Ga blocking on Pt sites are present together with both above-mentioned effects (intercalation and peripheral Ga deposition)."
[9] "When the reduction temperature increases from 573 to 773 K, additional effects between Pt and Ga would be produced."
[10] "In conclusion, the surface model postulated for this bimetallic system would involve the presence of two Ga species: one of them would correspond to Ga in an intimate contact with Pt and the another one could be assigned to Ga species localized on the support, which only produces a low modification of the support acidity."

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are commonly utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. They demonstrate superior performance, often enhancing selectivity and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. Metal oxides, such as gallium (Ga), indium (In), vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum, are also employed in these processes. Gallium addition notably boosts aromatic yield in paraffin aromatization. However, research on the performance of bimetallic catalysts based on Platinum/Al2O3 modified with Indium or Gallium, especially for light paraffin dehydrogenation, is limited. Intimate mechanical mixtures of Platinum/Al2O3 with Gallium have been tested to elucidate the impact of Gallium. At low reduction temperatures (573 K), Gallium primarily affects the geometric structure of the metallic phase, while at higher temperatures (773 K), additional effects such as blocking and electronic modification of Platinum sites might occur. Gallium's addition impacts the activity, selectivity, and deactivation of the catalysts. The surface model for this bimetallic system involves two Ga species: one in intimate contact with Platinum and the other localized on the support, affecting the acidity minimally.

The noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, show high catalytic efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique electronic and structural properties. Gallium, when added to Platinum-based catalysts, can significantly enhance the selectivity towards propylene in propane dehydrogenation, reducing carbon formation on the catalyst surface. This is attributed to the low concentration of hydrogenolysis sites, possibly due to the blocking effect of Gallium on Platinum sites. The addition of Gallium to the catalyst system also leads to a decrease in the deactivation parameter, indicating improved stability over time. The impact of Gallium addition varies depending on the reduction temperature. At lower temperatures, the effect is mainly geometric, while at higher temperatures, it includes electronic modification and blocking of Platinum sites. The surface model suggests the presence of two forms of Gallium: one in intimate contact with Platinum and the other localized on the support, which minimally modifies the support's acidity.

The document discusses the comparative analysis of noble metal-based catalysts (primarily Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field are highlighted.

Noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum are extensively used in the naphtha reforming process and the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins. They offer improved performance in terms of selectivity and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. Metal oxide-based catalysts, especially gallium, are known to enhance the yield to aromatics when utilized in paraffin aromatization processes. However, there is limited research on the performance and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 modified with Indium or Gallium for dehydrogenation processes, particularly for light paraffins.

The addition of Gallium to Platinum-based catalysts significantly enhances the selectivity to propylene and decreases catalyst deactivation and carbon formation. At low reduction temperatures (573 K), the effect of Gallium can be attributed to geometric effects, while at higher temperatures (773 K), additional effects such as blocking and potential electronic modification of Platinum sites come into play.

Recent developments in this area focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms of Gallium's influence on the performance of bimetallic catalysts. Potential advantages include improved selectivity, reduced deactivation, and decreased carbon formation, contributing to more efficient dehydrogenation processes.
