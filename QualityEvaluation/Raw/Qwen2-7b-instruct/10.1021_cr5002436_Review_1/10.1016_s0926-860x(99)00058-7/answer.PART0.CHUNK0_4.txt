[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight parafns."
[2] "In these cases the performance of bimetallic catalysts (mainly the selec- tivity and stability) is clearly improved with respect to that of the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for both catalytic processes."
[3] "Taking into account the previous comments, a study on the effect of Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 in the propane dehydrogenation reaction is reported in this paper."
[4] "It is well known that the Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in parafns aromatization processes."
[5] "This effect has been attributed to the properties developed by Ga for the recombination of H ."
[6] "Few papers have been reported in the literature about the performance and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 and modied by In or Ga for dehydrogenation processes, mainly for light parafns."
[7] "The catalytic performance of intimate mechanical mixtures (Pt/Al2O3Ga/Al2O3) was determined in order to understand the effect of Ga in these systems."
[8] "The inuence of the Ga addition toPtontheacidityofthecatalysts,theisopropanol(IPA) dehydration reaction was selected as a probe."
[9] "The Ga addition to Al2O3 produces a very slight diminution of the acidic character of the sup- port."
[10] "The major effect of the Ga addition to Pt seems to be related to the blocking and dilution effects of the active metal."
[11] "A similar behavior was found by Passos et al. [10] for PtIn/Al2O3 catalysts."
