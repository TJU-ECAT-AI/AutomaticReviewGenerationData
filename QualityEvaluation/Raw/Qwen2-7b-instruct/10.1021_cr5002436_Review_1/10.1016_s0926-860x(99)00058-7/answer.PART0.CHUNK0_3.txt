[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins."
[2] "In these cases the performance of bimetallic catalysts (mainly the selec- tivity and stability) is clearly improved with respect to that of the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for both catalytic processes."
[3] "It is well known that the Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in paraffin aromatization processes."
[4] "However, few papers have been reported in the literature about the performance and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 and modified by In or Ga for dehydrogenation processes, mainly for light paraffins."
[5] "The catalytic performance of intimate mechanical mixtures (Pt/Al2O3Ga/Al2O3) was determined in order to understand the effect of Ga in these systems."
[6] "The addition of increasing amounts of Ga to Pt/Al2O3 leads to TPR profiles with different characteristics with respect to the sum of TPR profiles of both monometallic catalysts."
[7] "In the case of the cyclopentane hydrogenolysis reaction, Fig. 11 shows that the reaction rate slightly decreases for Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 up to 0.44 wt%, when the previous reduction is carried out at 573 K."
[8] "For higher Ga contents, the reaction rate sharply decreases."
[9] "In this sense, Fig. 11 shows that when these mechanical mixtures are reduced at low temperature, the activities are very close to that of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, but, when they are reduced at 773 K, the activities markedly decreased reaching a value corresponding to that of an impregnated bimetallic catalyst with a lower Ga content."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are extensively used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts have been studied for their effectiveness in processes like naphtha reforming and dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins. They often improve selectivity and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. 

2. Gallium addition to catalysts enhances the yield to aromatics in paraffin aromatization processes. However, research on the performance and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 modified by In or Ga for dehydrogenation processes, especially for light paraffins, is scarce.

3. The effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 is studied through intimate mechanical mixtures to understand its impact on catalytic performance.

4. As the amount of gallium added to Pt/Al2O3 increases, the thermogravimetric analysis (TPR) profiles exhibit distinct characteristics compared to the sum of monometallic catalysts' profiles.

5. In the case of the cyclopentane hydrogenolysis reaction, the addition of gallium to Pt/Al2O3 decreases the reaction rate slightly up to 0.44 wt% when reduced at 573 K. For higher gallium contents, the rate sharply decreases.

6. Intimate mechanical mixtures of Pt/Al2O3 and Ga/Al2O3, when reduced at low temperatures, exhibit catalytic activities comparable to those of monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. However, after a thermal treatment at 773 K, the activities decrease significantly, reaching levels equivalent to impregnated bimetallic catalysts with a lower gallium content.

1. 钯和铝氧化物为基础的贵金属催化剂，以及如镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂，在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中被广泛使用。这些催化剂在重整过程和低分子量和高分子量石蜡的脱氢过程中已被研究。它们通常比单一金属催化剂提高了选择性和稳定性。

2. 镓的添加能增加石蜡裂化过程中的芳烃产率。然而，关于基于钯和铝氧化物的双金属催化剂的性能和特性，特别是通过镓或铟修改的催化剂用于脱氢过程的研究，尤其是对轻石蜡的研究文献较少。

3. 通过研究钯/铝氧化物和镓/铝氧化物的紧密机械混合物，来了解镓对其催化性能的影响。

5. 对于环戊烷氢解反应，当钯/铝氧化物在573 K下预处理时，添加镓导致反应速率轻微下降至0.44 wt%，直至添加0.44 wt%。对于更高含量的镓，速率急剧下降。

6. 当将钯/铝氧化物和镓/铝氧化物的紧密机械混合物在低温下预处理时，其催化活性与单金属钯/铝氧化物催化剂相当。然而，在773 K的热处理后，活性显著降低，达到较低镓含量的浸渍双金属催化剂的水平。
