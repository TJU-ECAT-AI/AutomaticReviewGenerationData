[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins."
[2] "In these cases the performance of bimetallic catalysts (mainly the selec- tivity and stability) is clearly improved with respect to that of the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for both catalytic processes."
[3] "It is well known that the Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in paraffin aromatization processes."
[4] "However, few papers have been reported in the literature about the performance and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 and modied by In or Ga for dehydrogenation processes, mainly for light paraffins."
[5] "Taking into account the previous comments, a study on the effect of Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 in the propane dehydrogenation reaction is reported in this paper."
[6] "Results showed that the selectivity to propylene is enhanced by the Ga addition, while the catalyst deactivation and the carbon formation are decreased when the Ga content increased."
[7] "The low effect of the Ga addition (up to 0.44 wt%) on the: (i) cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction rate,(ii) activation energy in the same reaction and (iii) H2 adsorption capacity, when the samples were reduced at 573 K, would indicate that the fraction of Ga in intimate contact with Pt could be either intercalated between Pt atoms or deposited in the periphery of the Pt particles."
[8] "On the other hand, for Ga contents higher than 0.44 wt% in the bimetallic catalysts, results on both test reactions and H2 chemisorption would indicate that the Ga blocking on Pt sites are present together with both above-mentioned effects (intercalation and peripheral Ga deposition)."

The document discusses the comparative analysis of noble metal-based catalysts (primarily Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field are highlighted.

Noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum are extensively used in the naphtha reforming process and the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins. They offer improved performance in terms of selectivity and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. Metal oxide-based catalysts, especially gallium, are known to enhance the yield to aromatics when utilized in paraffin aromatization processes. However, there is limited research on the performance and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 modified with Indium or Gallium for dehydrogenation processes, particularly for light paraffins.

The addition of Gallium to Platinum-based catalysts significantly enhances the selectivity to propylene and decreases catalyst deactivation and carbon formation. At low reduction temperatures (573 K), the effect of Gallium can be attributed to geometric effects, while at higher temperatures (773 K), additional effects such as blocking and potential electronic modification of Platinum sites come into play.

Recent developments in this area focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms of Gallium's influence on the performance of bimetallic catalysts. Potential advantages include improved selectivity, reduced deactivation, and decreased carbon formation, contributing to more efficient dehydrogenation processes.

文档讨论了贵金属催化剂（主要为铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的比较分析。讨论了它们的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新进展及其在该领域的潜在优势。

贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，在石脑油重整过程和低分子量烷烃的脱氢中被广泛使用。与单金属催化剂相比，它们在选择性和稳定性方面表现出明显改进。金属氧化物催化剂，尤其是镓，已知在芳烃化过程中能提高烷烃的产率。然而，关于基于Pt/Al2O3的双金属催化剂与添加铟或镓的性能和特性进行脱氢过程的研究报道较少，特别是对于轻烷烃。

将镓添加到铂基催化剂中可以显著增强丙烯的选择性并减少催化剂失活和碳形成。在较低还原温度（573 K）下，镓的作用可能归因于几何效应；而在较高温度（773 K）下，则可能包括阻塞和潜在的铂位电子修改等附加效应。

这一领域近期的发展集中在理解镓对双金属催化剂性能影响的详细机制。潜在的优势包括提高选择性、降低失活和减少碳沉积，从而促进更高效的脱氢过程。
