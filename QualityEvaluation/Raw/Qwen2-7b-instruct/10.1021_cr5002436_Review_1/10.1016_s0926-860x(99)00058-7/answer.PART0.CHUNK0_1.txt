[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins [16]."
[2] "In these cases the performance of bimetallic catalysts (mainly the selec- tivity and stability) is clearly improved with respect to that of the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for both catalytic processes."
[3] "It is well known that the Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in paraffin aromatization processes [7]."
[4] "However, few papers have been reported in the literature about the performance and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 and modified by In or Ga for dehydrogenation processes, mainly for light paraffins [8-10]."
[5] "The catalytic performance of intimate mechanical mixtures (Pt/Al2O3Ga/Al2O3) was determined in order to understand the effect of Ga in these systems."
[6] "The Ga addition (up to 0.44 wt%) on the: (i) cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction rate, (ii) activation energy in the same reaction and (iii) H2 adsorption capacity, when the samples were reduced at 573 K, would indicate that the fraction of Ga in intimate contact with Pt could be either intercalated between Pt atoms or deposited in the periphery of the Pt particles."
[7] "However, the low decrease of the hydrogenolysis activity for samples with Ga0.44 wt%,previously reduced at 573 K, can be better explained by the predominance of the second effect, since the first one should lead to an important decrease of the concentration of Pt ensembles required for the CP hydrogenolysis reaction."
[8] "On the other hand, for Ga contents higher than 0.44 wt% in the bimetallic catalysts, results on both test reactions and H2 chemisorption would indicate that the Ga blocking on Pt sites are present together with both above-mentioned effects (intercalation and peripheral Ga deposition)."
[9] "When the reduction temperature increases from 573 to 773 K, additional effects between Pt and Ga would be produced."
[10] "In conclusion, the surface model postulated for this bimetallic system would involve the presence of two Ga species: one of them would correspond to Ga in an intimate contact with Pt and the another one could be assigned to Ga species localized on the support, which only produces a low modification of the support acidity."

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are commonly utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. They demonstrate superior performance, often enhancing selectivity and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. Metal oxides, such as gallium (Ga), indium (In), vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum, are also employed in these processes. Gallium addition notably boosts aromatic yield in paraffin aromatization. However, research on the performance of bimetallic catalysts based on Platinum/Al2O3 modified with Indium or Gallium, especially for light paraffin dehydrogenation, is limited. Intimate mechanical mixtures of Platinum/Al2O3 with Gallium have been tested to elucidate the impact of Gallium. At low reduction temperatures (573 K), Gallium primarily affects the geometric structure of the metallic phase, while at higher temperatures (773 K), additional effects such as blocking and electronic modification of Platinum sites might occur. Gallium's addition impacts the activity, selectivity, and deactivation of the catalysts. The surface model for this bimetallic system involves two Ga species: one in intimate contact with Platinum and the other localized on the support, affecting the acidity minimally.

The noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, show high catalytic efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique electronic and structural properties. Gallium, when added to Platinum-based catalysts, can significantly enhance the selectivity towards propylene in propane dehydrogenation, reducing carbon formation on the catalyst surface. This is attributed to the low concentration of hydrogenolysis sites, possibly due to the blocking effect of Gallium on Platinum sites. The addition of Gallium to the catalyst system also leads to a decrease in the deactivation parameter, indicating improved stability over time. The impact of Gallium addition varies depending on the reduction temperature. At lower temperatures, the effect is mainly geometric, while at higher temperatures, it includes electronic modification and blocking of Platinum sites. The surface model suggests the presence of two forms of Gallium: one in intimate contact with Platinum and the other localized on the support, which minimally modifies the support's acidity.

贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂（Pt），在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中广泛应用。它们表现出卓越的性能，通常比单金属催化剂提高了选择性和稳定性。金属氧化物，如镓（Ga）、铟（In）、钒、锌和钼等，也被用于这些过程。镓的添加显著提高了芳香烃的产率，在烷基芳烃化过程中。然而，关于基于铂/Al2O3的双金属催化剂与铟或镓改性，特别是对轻烷基脱氢过程的性能和特性研究相对较少。对铂/Al2O3与镓的紧密机械混合物进行测试，以了解镓的影响。在较低还原温度（573 K）下，镓主要影响金属相的几何结构；而在较高温度（773 K）下，还会产生额外效应，包括阻塞和铂位的电子修改。镓的添加对催化剂的活性、选择性和失活有显著影响。这种双金属系统的表面模型涉及两种镓物种：一种与铂紧密接触，另一种定位在支撑上，仅轻微改变支撑的酸性。
