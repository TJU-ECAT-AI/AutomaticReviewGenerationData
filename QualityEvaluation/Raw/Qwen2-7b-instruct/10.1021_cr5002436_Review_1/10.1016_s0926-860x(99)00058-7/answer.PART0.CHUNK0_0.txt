[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins."
[2] "In these cases the performance of bimetallic catalysts (mainly the selectivity and stability) is clearly improved with respect to that of the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for both catalytic processes."
[3] "The Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in paraffin aromatization processes."
[4] "Few papers have been reported in the literature about the performance and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 and modified by In or Ga for dehydrogenation processes, mainly for light paraffins."
[5] "A study on the effect of Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 in the propane dehydrogenation reaction is reported in this paper."
[6] "The Ga addition to Al2O3 produces a smaller poisoning effect on the acid sites than Li."
[7] "The Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 would produce a small modification of the acidity of the support."
[8] "The Ga addition to Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 would produce a small modification of the acidity of the support."
[9] "When Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3, the initial selectivity to propylene is enhanced and the carbon retention is decreased."
[10] "The Ga addition on the: (i) cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction rate,(ii) activation energy in the same reaction and (iii) H2 adsorption capacity, when the samples were reduced at 573 K, would indicate that the fraction of Ga in intimate contact with Pt could be either intercalated between Pt atoms or deposited in the periphery of the Pt particles."

1. The study focused on the impact of gallium (Ga) addition to platinum (Pt)/alumina (Al2O3) catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. 
2. Gallium addition improved the selectivity for propylene, decreased catalyst deactivation, and reduced carbon formation.
3. The Ga addition had a low effect on the acidity of the support but altered the structure of the metallic phase differently depending on the previous reduction temperature.
4. At a low reduction temperature (573 K), the Ga action was attributed to geometric effects only. At a higher temperature (773 K), Ga blocking and potentially electronic modification of Pt sites occurred.
5. The Ga addition led to a decrease in carbon deposition on the catalyst surface and an enhancement of propylene selectivity.
6. The Ga addition influenced the performance of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation process by modifying the structure of the metallic phase, affecting the selectivity and deactivation rates.
7. Gallium was found to have a smaller poisoning effect on the strong acid sites compared to lithium (Li).
8. The acidity of the support was slightly modified by the Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 and Al2O3.
9. Gallium addition enhanced the initial selectivity for propylene and reduced carbon retention during the dehydrogenation process.
10. The Ga addition had a minor effect on the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction rate, activation energy, and H2 adsorption capacity when samples were reduced at 573 K. This suggests that Ga could be intercalated between Pt atoms or deposited around Pt particles.

1. 本研究主要关注镓（Ga）添加到铂（Pt）/氧化铝（Al2O3）催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的影响。
2. 镓添加提高了丙烯的选择性，减少了催化剂的失活和碳沉积。
3. 镓添加对支持物的酸性作用影响较小，但根据之前的还原温度不同，对金属相结构的影响也不同。
4. 在较低还原温度（573 K）下，镓的作用仅与几何效应有关。在较高温度（773 K）下，镓可能堵塞并电子修改Pt位点。
5. 镓添加导致催化剂表面碳沉积减少，并增强了丙烯选择性。
6. 镓添加通过改变金属相结构，影响了选择性和失活率，改善了脱氢过程的性能。
7. 镓添加对强酸位点的毒化作用比锂（Li）要小。
8. 镓添加略微改变了支持物的酸性。
9. 镓添加提高了初始丙烯选择性，并减少了碳沉积。
10. 当样品在573 K下还原时，Ga添加对环己烷脱氢反应速率、激活能以及H2吸附能力的影响较小。这表明Ga可能嵌入在Pt原子之间或沉积在Pt颗粒周围。
