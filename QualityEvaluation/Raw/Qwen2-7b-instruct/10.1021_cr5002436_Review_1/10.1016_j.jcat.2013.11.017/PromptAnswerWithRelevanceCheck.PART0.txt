The research aimed to investigate the effects of particle size and composition on ethane dehydrogenation using PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles. It was found that for a constant average particle size, ethane turnover frequency (TOF) and ethene selectivity increased with the addition of tin (Sn) in the PtSn particles. Lower residence times were utilized to measure the true initial activity of catalysts, which showed significantly less deactivation and stable conversion. The deactivation rate varied with particle size, and the effects of particle size and composition were explained by a combination of geometric and electronic factors.

The research focuses on the effects of composition and particle size on the dehydrogenation of ethane over platinum-tin (Pt-Sn) nanoparticles on magnesium-aluminum oxide (Mg(Al)O) catalysts. The study reveals that both the particle size and the content of tin in the Pt-Sn particles impact the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and coke accumulation. Smaller particles and higher tin content lead to lower deactivation, increased ethane turnover frequency (TOF), and selectivity towards ethene. The observed trends are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects influenced by the tin addition. Operating at low residence time conditions reduces deactivation, providing a more accurate measure of the initial activity of the catalysts. The research highlights the importance of controlling particle size and composition for optimizing the performance of Pt-Sn catalysts in ethane dehydrogenation processes.

The study examines the effects of composition and particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O catalysts. The research focuses on the role of platinum (Pt) and tin (Sn) in modifying catalyst performance. Smaller PtSn particles and higher Sn content lead to improved ethene selectivity and reduced coke formation, indicating that tin promotes activity and decreases deactivation. Particle size has a significant impact on both ethane turnover frequency (TOF) and selectivity to ethene, with larger particles showing increased TOF. This is attributed to the higher proportion of lower-coordinated surface atoms on larger particles, which enhances catalytic activity. However, the study acknowledges that the benefits of larger particles in terms of increased TOF are not substantial enough to outweigh the loss in surface area. The researchers also employ a low residence time strategy to mitigate deactivation and measure the true initial activity of the catalysts. This approach allows for a clearer assessment of the intrinsic activity of Pt and PtSn catalysts, highlighting the importance of tin in enhancing dehydrogenation efficiency.

该研究探讨了在PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O催化剂上乙烷脱氢的组成和颗粒大小的影响。研究重点在于铂（Pt）和锡（Sn）如何改变催化剂性能。更小的PtSn颗粒和更高的Sn含量导致了更高的乙烯选择性并减少了焦炭形成，这表明锡促进了活性并降低了失活。颗粒大小对乙烷转率频率（TOF）和乙烯生成的选择性有显著影响，较大的颗粒显示了增加的TOF。这是由于较大颗粒上较低配位表面原子的比例更高，从而增强了催化活性。然而，研究人员也认识到，在提高TOF方面的益处不足以弥补表面面积的损失。他们还采用低停留时间策略来减少失活并测量催化剂的真正初始活性。这种方法允许更清晰地评估Pt和PtSn催化剂的内在活性，突出了锡在提高脱氢效率中的重要性。

The literature focuses on the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It discusses their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. The document specifically explores the impact of composition and size on the performance of PtSn particles in ethane dehydrogenation. The addition of tin to platinum is highlighted as effective in increasing ethene selectivity and reducing coke formation. The TOF and selectivity for ethene production are shown to increase with the content of tin in the PtSn alloy. The document also addresses the role of surface geometry in influencing the dehydrogenation rate, indicating that while larger particles may exhibit higher TOF due to easier removal of nascent ethene, the gain is not substantial enough to outweigh the benefits of increased surface area provided by smaller particles. Industrial applications of these catalysts are not extensively discussed in the provided literature, but their importance in the production of ethene and the potential for enhanced efficiency through the use of specific compositions and sizes is emphasized.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find that:

1. Platinum is the most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation, yet it suffers from low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, leading to catalyst deactivation.
   
2. The addition of a second metal, including tin, indium, or gallium, can enhance ethene selectivity and inhibit coke formation, improving catalyst performance.

3. There is extensive research on the impact of additives on activity, selectivity, and coke accumulation in Pt-bimetallic catalysts, but the distinct effects of metal particle size and composition have not been comprehensively understood until this study.

4. In this research, the effects of composition and size on coke formation, ethane dehydrogenation rate, and ethene selectivity in PtSn nanoparticles were examined. 

5. A novel approach was developed to accurately assess the true initial activity, which led to the discovery that lowering the residence time significantly reduced deactivation, primarily due to decreased coke formation from ethene.

6. With a fixed average particle size, the turnover frequency (TOF) and ethene selectivity increased with the Sn content in the PtSn particles.

7. These outcomes are explained by a blend of geometric and electronic effects caused by the presence of Sn on the surface of Pt nanoparticles.

8. TOF was observed to rise with particle size, attributed to variations in the fraction of lower-coordinated surface atoms and the electronic properties of the particles.

In summary, while Platinum shows high activity but suffers from coke formation, the introduction of metal additives like tin can improve selectivity and reduce deactivation. The study highlights the importance of particle size and composition in enhancing catalyst performance in ethane dehydrogenation.

比较贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂金，与铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域的应用，我们发现：

1. 铂是乙烯脱氢最活跃的催化剂，但其表现出低乙炔选择性和快速焦炭沉积，导致催化剂失活。

2. 添加第二金属，如锡、铟或镓，可以提高乙炔选择性并抑制焦炭形成，改善催化剂性能。

3. 关于添加剂对活性、选择性和焦炭积累影响的研究，尤其是在Pt双金属催化剂上的研究，尽管有广泛的研究，但颗粒尺寸和组成的影响的独立理解直到这项研究才被提出。

4. 在这项研究中，研究了铂锡纳米粒子中组成和尺寸对焦炭形成、乙烯脱氢速率和乙炔选择性的影响。

5. 采用了一种新颖的方法来准确评估真正的初始活性，结果显示降低停留时间显著减少了由于乙炔形成焦炭而导致的失活。

6. 对于固定的平均颗粒尺寸，随着PtSn颗粒中锡含量的增加，乙烯消耗的转化频率（TOF）和乙炔选择性也增加。

7. 这些结果归因于锡在铂纳米颗粒表面带来的几何和电子效应的结合。

8. 随着颗粒尺寸的增加，TOF也被观察到增加，这归因于表面原子低配位比例的变化以及颗粒的电子性质差异。

综上所述，虽然铂显示出高活性但伴有焦炭形成的问题，添加金属添加剂如锡可以改善选择性并减少失活。该研究表明，在乙烯脱氢过程中，颗粒尺寸和组成对于增强催化剂性能的重要性。
