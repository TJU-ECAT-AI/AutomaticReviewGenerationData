<p>The most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, which contributes to catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Isotopic studies have revealed that both methane formation and coke accumulation originate from ethene re-adsorption and dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation.</p>
<p>While there is a considerable literature on the influence of additives on the activity, selectivity, and coke accumulation occurring on Pt-bimetallic catalysts, a clear understanding of the separate effects of metal particle size and composition has not been previously reported.</p>
<p>The effects of composition and size of PtSn particles on coke formation, rate of ethane dehydrogenation, and the selectivity to ethene were studied using PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70 6 x 6 100) nanoparticles dispersed onto Mg(Al)O.</p>
<p>A unique strategy was employed to make accurate comparisons of true initial activity. Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity.</p>
<p>For a fixed average particle size, the TOF and selectivity of these catalysts for ethene production increased with the content of Sn.</p>
<p>These trends are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects brought about by the presence of Sn on the surface of Pt nanoparticles.</p>
<p>TOF was also found to increase with increasing particle size, a trend attributed to differences in the fraction of lower-coordinated surface atoms and in the electronic properties of the particles.</p>

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find that:

1. Platinum is the most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation, yet it suffers from low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, leading to catalyst deactivation.
   
2. The addition of a second metal, including tin, indium, or gallium, can enhance ethene selectivity and inhibit coke formation, improving catalyst performance.

3. There is extensive research on the impact of additives on activity, selectivity, and coke accumulation in Pt-bimetallic catalysts, but the distinct effects of metal particle size and composition have not been comprehensively understood until this study.

4. In this research, the effects of composition and size on coke formation, ethane dehydrogenation rate, and ethene selectivity in PtSn nanoparticles were examined. 

5. A novel approach was developed to accurately assess the true initial activity, which led to the discovery that lowering the residence time significantly reduced deactivation, primarily due to decreased coke formation from ethene.

6. With a fixed average particle size, the turnover frequency (TOF) and ethene selectivity increased with the Sn content in the PtSn particles.

7. These outcomes are explained by a blend of geometric and electronic effects caused by the presence of Sn on the surface of Pt nanoparticles.

8. TOF was observed to rise with particle size, attributed to variations in the fraction of lower-coordinated surface atoms and the electronic properties of the particles.

In summary, while Platinum shows high activity but suffers from coke formation, the introduction of metal additives like tin can improve selectivity and reduce deactivation. The study highlights the importance of particle size and composition in enhancing catalyst performance in ethane dehydrogenation.

比较贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂金，与铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域的应用，我们发现：

1. 铂是乙烯脱氢最活跃的催化剂，但其表现出低乙炔选择性和快速焦炭沉积，导致催化剂失活。

2. 添加第二金属，如锡、铟或镓，可以提高乙炔选择性并抑制焦炭形成，改善催化剂性能。

3. 关于添加剂对活性、选择性和焦炭积累影响的研究，尤其是在Pt双金属催化剂上的研究，尽管有广泛的研究，但颗粒尺寸和组成的影响的独立理解直到这项研究才被提出。

4. 在这项研究中，研究了铂锡纳米粒子中组成和尺寸对焦炭形成、乙烯脱氢速率和乙炔选择性的影响。

5. 采用了一种新颖的方法来准确评估真正的初始活性，结果显示降低停留时间显著减少了由于乙炔形成焦炭而导致的失活。

6. 对于固定的平均颗粒尺寸，随着PtSn颗粒中锡含量的增加，乙烯消耗的转化频率（TOF）和乙炔选择性也增加。

7. 这些结果归因于锡在铂纳米颗粒表面带来的几何和电子效应的结合。

8. 随着颗粒尺寸的增加，TOF也被观察到增加，这归因于表面原子低配位比例的变化以及颗粒的电子性质差异。

综上所述，虽然铂显示出高活性但伴有焦炭形成的问题，添加金属添加剂如锡可以改善选择性并减少失活。该研究表明，在乙烯脱氢过程中，颗粒尺寸和组成对于增强催化剂性能的重要性。
