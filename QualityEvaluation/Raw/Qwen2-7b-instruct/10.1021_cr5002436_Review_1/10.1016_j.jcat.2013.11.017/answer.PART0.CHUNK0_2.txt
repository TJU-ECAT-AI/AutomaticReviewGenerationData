[1] "The most active cat- alyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition,which contributes to catalyst deactivation."
[2] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium,to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation."
[3] "For a fixed average particle size, ethane TOF and the selectivity to ethene increased with increasing content of Sn in the PtSn particle."
[4] "To compare the true initial activity of different catalysts, a low feed residence time was used."
[5] "Operating at a lower residence time (3.75  103 g s cm3), however, showed significantly less deactivation and stable conversion with time on stream."
[6] "The extent of deactivation between 0.3 min and 10.3 min as a function of particle size for Pt and Pt3Sn catalysts is shown in Fig. 9."
[7] "Fig. 10 shows direct measurement of the accumu- lation of coke, measured as the moles of C per mole of surface Pt, as a function of particle size at high residence time condition."
[8] "The effects of Sn content on ethane TOF and ethene selectivity for nanoparticles of nearly constant size (2.5 nm) measured after 0.3 min from the onset of reaction."
[9] "While selectivity to ethene remained nearly constant across all particle sizes for both Pt and Pt3Sn, ethane TOF increased with increasing particle size."
[10] "The extent of deactivation shown in Fig. 7 originates from coke formation, rather than sintering of the catalyst."

The study examines the effects of composition and particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O catalysts. The research focuses on the role of platinum (Pt) and tin (Sn) in modifying catalyst performance. Smaller PtSn particles and higher Sn content lead to improved ethene selectivity and reduced coke formation, indicating that tin promotes activity and decreases deactivation. Particle size has a significant impact on both ethane turnover frequency (TOF) and selectivity to ethene, with larger particles showing increased TOF. This is attributed to the higher proportion of lower-coordinated surface atoms on larger particles, which enhances catalytic activity. However, the study acknowledges that the benefits of larger particles in terms of increased TOF are not substantial enough to outweigh the loss in surface area. The researchers also employ a low residence time strategy to mitigate deactivation and measure the true initial activity of the catalysts. This approach allows for a clearer assessment of the intrinsic activity of Pt and PtSn catalysts, highlighting the importance of tin in enhancing dehydrogenation efficiency.

该研究探讨了在PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O催化剂上乙烷脱氢的组成和颗粒大小的影响。研究重点在于铂（Pt）和锡（Sn）如何改变催化剂性能。更小的PtSn颗粒和更高的Sn含量导致了更高的乙烯选择性并减少了焦炭形成，这表明锡促进了活性并降低了失活。颗粒大小对乙烷转率频率（TOF）和乙烯生成的选择性有显著影响，较大的颗粒显示了增加的TOF。这是由于较大颗粒上较低配位表面原子的比例更高，从而增强了催化活性。然而，研究人员也认识到，在提高TOF方面的益处不足以弥补表面面积的损失。他们还采用低停留时间策略来减少失活并测量催化剂的真正初始活性。这种方法允许更清晰地评估Pt和PtSn催化剂的内在活性，突出了锡在提高脱氢效率中的重要性。
