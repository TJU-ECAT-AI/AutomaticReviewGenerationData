The research focuses on the effects of composition and particle size on the dehydrogenation of ethane over platinum-tin (Pt-Sn) nanoparticles on magnesium-aluminum oxide (Mg(Al)O) catalysts. The study reveals that both the particle size and the content of tin in the Pt-Sn particles impact the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and coke accumulation. Smaller particles and higher tin content lead to lower deactivation, increased ethane turnover frequency (TOF), and selectivity towards ethene. The observed trends are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects influenced by the tin addition. Operating at low residence time conditions reduces deactivation, providing a more accurate measure of the initial activity of the catalysts. The research highlights the importance of controlling particle size and composition for optimizing the performance of Pt-Sn catalysts in ethane dehydrogenation processes.

该研究专注于铂-锡(Pt-Sn)纳米颗粒在镁铝氧化物(Mg(Al)O)催化剂上的乙烷脱氢作用，着重探讨了组成和颗粒大小对催化剂活性、选择性和焦炭积累的影响。研究发现，颗粒尺寸和锡含量的增加均能降低催化剂失活程度，提高乙烷转化频率(TOF)以及乙烯的选择性。观察到的趋势归因于锡添加所引发的几何和电子效应的结合。在低停留时间条件下运行，可以显著降低失活，提供更准确的初始活性测量。研究强调了控制颗粒尺寸和组成的必要性，以优化铂-锡催化剂在乙烷脱氢过程中的性能。
