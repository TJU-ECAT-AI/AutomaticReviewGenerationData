[1] "The aim of the present work was to identify and quantify the effects of particle size composition for PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene."
[2] "For a fixed average particle size, ethane TOF and the selectivity to ethene increased with increasing content of Sn in the PtSn particle."
[3] "To compare the true initial activity of different catalysts, a low feed residence time was used."
[4] "Operating at a lower residence time (3.75  103 g s cm3), however, showed significantly less deactivation and stable conversion with time on stream."
[5] "The extent of deactivation between 0.3 min and 10.3 min as a function of particle size for Pt and PtSn catalysts is shown in Fig. 9."
[6] "The observed effects of particle size and composition are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic factors."

The research aimed to investigate the effects of particle size and composition on ethane dehydrogenation using PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles. It was found that for a constant average particle size, ethane turnover frequency (TOF) and ethene selectivity increased with the addition of tin (Sn) in the PtSn particles. Lower residence times were utilized to measure the true initial activity of catalysts, which showed significantly less deactivation and stable conversion. The deactivation rate varied with particle size, and the effects of particle size and composition were explained by a combination of geometric and electronic factors.

本研究旨在探讨铂锡双金属纳米粒子对乙烷脱氢的影响，特别是粒子大小和组成的影响。研究发现，在恒定的平均粒子大小下，乙烷转率频率（TOF）和乙烯选择性随着铂锡合金中锡（Sn）含量的增加而增加。较低的停留时间被用于测量催化剂的真正初始活性，结果显示显著较少的失活和稳定的转化率。不同粒子大小下的失活速率存在差异，并且粒子大小和组成的效应可由几何和电子因素的组合解释。
