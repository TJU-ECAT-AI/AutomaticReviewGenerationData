[1] "The most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition,which contributes to catalyst deactivation."
[2] "Isotopic studies have revealed that both methane formation and coke accumulation originate from ethene re-adsorption and dehydrogenation."
[3] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium,to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation."
[4] "The effects of composition and size of PtSn particles on coke formation, rate of ethane dehydrogenation, and the selectivity to ethene were studied using PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70 6 x 6 100) nanoparticles dispersed onto Mg(Al)O."
[5] "For a fixed average particle size, the TOF and selectivity of these catalysts for ethene production increased with the content of Sn."
[6] "While ethane dehydrogenation may favor flatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to lose surface area by going to larger particles."

The literature focuses on the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It discusses their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. The document specifically explores the impact of composition and size on the performance of PtSn particles in ethane dehydrogenation. The addition of tin to platinum is highlighted as effective in increasing ethene selectivity and reducing coke formation. The TOF and selectivity for ethene production are shown to increase with the content of tin in the PtSn alloy. The document also addresses the role of surface geometry in influencing the dehydrogenation rate, indicating that while larger particles may exhibit higher TOF due to easier removal of nascent ethene, the gain is not substantial enough to outweigh the benefits of increased surface area provided by smaller particles. Industrial applications of these catalysts are not extensively discussed in the provided literature, but their importance in the production of ethene and the potential for enhanced efficiency through the use of specific compositions and sizes is emphasized.

文献专注于研究用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物。它讨论了它们的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展以及潜在优势。文献特别探讨了铂锡合金粒子在乙烷脱氢中的组成和大小对性能的影响。向铂中添加锡被证明能够有效提高乙烯选择性并抑制积碳形成。铂锡合金中锡含量的增加显示出对乙烯生产的转化率和选择性的提升。文献还提到表面几何学在影响脱氢速率方面的作用，指出虽然较大的颗粒可能由于新生乙烯更容易从表面释放到气体相而表现出更高的转化率，但这种收益不足以抵消通过使用更小尺寸带来的表面积增益。工业应用中的催化剂没有在提供的文献中详细讨论，但其在乙烯生产中的重要性及其通过特定组成和尺寸优化的潜力得到了强调。
