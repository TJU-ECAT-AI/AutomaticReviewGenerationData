Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, both types have distinct roles and advantages. Noble metals like Platinum are highly effective due to their exceptional activity and stability, making them ideal for rapid and efficient dehydrogenation processes. However, they tend to be less selective, often leading to higher coke formation, which is a byproduct that reduces catalyst efficiency over time. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are known for their ability to provide Lewis acidity, which helps in dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation, thus enhancing selectivity. These catalysts are widely used in petrochemical industries for producing ethylene and propylene from various hydrocarbon feedstocks. Recent advancements include incorporating promoters to improve the activity and selectivity of noble metal catalysts and exploring mixed-metal oxide systems. Future research aims to develop more sustainable catalysts with enhanced performance characteristics, such as improved activity, selectivity, and durability.

比较贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，和金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，两种类型的催化剂各有特点和优势。贵金属如铂因其出色的活性和稳定性而被广泛用于快速高效的脱氢过程。然而，它们的选型性较低，常常导致较高的焦炭生成，这会随着时间的推移逐渐降低催化剂的效率。金属氧化物催化剂以其提供路易斯酸性的能力而闻名，这有助于脱氢过程的同时减少焦炭的形成，从而提高选择性。这些催化剂在石油化学工业中被广泛应用于从各种烃类原料生产乙烯和丙烯。最近的发展包括将促进剂引入到贵金属催化剂中以提高其活性和选择性，并探索混合金属氧化物系统。未来的研究方向旨在开发更可持续的催化剂，具有增强的性能特性，如改进的活性、选择性和耐用性。
