<p>The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are calculated to be in the region of 0.650.75 eV and 0.250.35 eV on the flat and stepped surfaces, respectively.</p>

The study finds that the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene vary between 0.65-0.75 eV on flat surfaces and 0.25-0.35 eV on stepped surfaces. This indicates that stepped surfaces are more favorable for propane dehydrogenation. The selectivity towards propylene is reduced on surfaces with coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms. Propyne is identified as the starting point for CC bond breaking, leading to the formation of ethane, methane, and coke. Step sites are proposed to be the primary location for coke formation.

研究发现，丙烷脱氢形成丙烯的能量壁垒在平坦表面区域为0.65-0.75 eV，在阶梯表面区域为0.25-0.35 eV。这表明阶梯表面更有利于丙烷脱氢。在具有配合不饱和铂原子的表面上，丙烯选择性显著降低。丙炔被识别为CC键断裂的起点，导致甲烷、乙烷和焦炭的形成。阶梯表面被认为是焦炭形成的首要位置。

[1] "In the past three decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffin on transition metals for light olefin production."
[2] "Though several catalytic dehydrogenation techniques such as Oleflex, Catofin, etc. have been commercialized, there is still plenty of room to improve the catalyst performance for longer operation cycle and higher selectivity."
[3] "Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, have been widely used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their excellent activity and stability."
[4] "Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been explored for their potential in improving selectivity and reducing coke formation."
[5] "Recent developments in the field include the incorporation of promoters to enhance the activity and selectivity of noble metal catalysts, as well as the exploration of mixed-metal oxide systems."
[6] "The compositions of noble metal-based catalysts typically consist of a single or multiple noble metals, such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, and Ir, often supported on metal oxides or carbon materials to improve stability and dispersion."
[7] "Metal oxide-based catalysts are characterized by their ability to provide Lewis acidity, which facilitates the dehydrogenation process while minimizing coke formation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, both types have distinct roles and advantages. Noble metals like Platinum are highly effective due to their exceptional activity and stability, making them ideal for rapid and efficient dehydrogenation processes. However, they tend to be less selective, often leading to higher coke formation, which is a byproduct that reduces catalyst efficiency over time. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are known for their ability to provide Lewis acidity, which helps in dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation, thus enhancing selectivity. These catalysts are widely used in petrochemical industries for producing ethylene and propylene from various hydrocarbon feedstocks. Recent advancements include incorporating promoters to improve the activity and selectivity of noble metal catalysts and exploring mixed-metal oxide systems. Future research aims to develop more sustainable catalysts with enhanced performance characteristics, such as improved activity, selectivity, and durability.

[1] "In recent years, the chemisorption of propane and propylene on Pt surface has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically."
[2] "As for gaseous propane,it is known that the energy barrier for the CH activation of methyl group is higher than that for the activation of methylene group (4.35 and 4.17 eV, respectively)."
[3] "Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms."
[4] "It is therefore of vital importance to understand the reaction mechanism so as to improve the selectivity towards propylene and suppress coke formation"
[5] "The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are calculated to be in the region of 0.650.75 eV and 0.250.35 eV on the flat and stepped surfaces,respectively."
[6] "The recent theoretical studies, similar energy barriers with values in the range of 0.290.42 eV for the initial activation of ethane to ethylene on Pt(110)-(12) were obtained by Anghel et al."
[7] "The energy barriers for the CC bond breaking are lowered more significantly than those for the dehydrogenation steps with the reactions moving from the flat to stepped surface."

The document discusses the comparison between noble metal-based catalysts (specifically platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalyst types are not directly addressed. However, the document focuses on the use of platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It highlights the differences in energy barriers for the dehydrogenation process, the role of step sites on the surface, and the effect on the selectivity towards propylene and coke formation. The energy barriers for dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are lower on stepped surfaces compared to flat surfaces, indicating higher catalytic activity. The selectivity towards propylene is influenced by the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms. The document suggests that the cleaving of the CC bond may occur as the C3 intermediates are deeply dehydrogenated, starting with propyne. The overall reaction scheme for propane dehydrogenation is discussed, emphasizing the role of step sites during the quick deactivation stage and the transfer of the active center to the flat surface at the steady state.
