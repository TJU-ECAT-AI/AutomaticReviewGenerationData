The study finds that the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene vary between 0.65-0.75 eV on flat surfaces and 0.25-0.35 eV on stepped surfaces. This indicates that stepped surfaces are more favorable for propane dehydrogenation. The selectivity towards propylene is reduced on surfaces with coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms. Propyne is identified as the starting point for CC bond breaking, leading to the formation of ethane, methane, and coke. Step sites are proposed to be the primary location for coke formation.

研究发现，丙烷脱氢形成丙烯的能量壁垒在平坦表面区域为0.65-0.75 eV，在阶梯表面区域为0.25-0.35 eV。这表明阶梯表面更有利于丙烷脱氢。在具有配合不饱和铂原子的表面上，丙烯选择性显著降低。丙炔被识别为CC键断裂的起点，导致甲烷、乙烷和焦炭的形成。阶梯表面被认为是焦炭形成的首要位置。
