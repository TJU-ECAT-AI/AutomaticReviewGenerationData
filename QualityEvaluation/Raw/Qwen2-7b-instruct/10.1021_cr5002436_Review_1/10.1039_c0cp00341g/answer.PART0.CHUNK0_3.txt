[1] "In recent years, the chemisorption of propane and propylene on Pt surface has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically."
[2] "As for gaseous propane,it is known that the energy barrier for the CH activation of methyl group is higher than that for the activation of methylene group (4.35 and 4.17 eV, respectively)."
[3] "Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms."
[4] "It is therefore of vital importance to understand the reaction mechanism so as to improve the selectivity towards propylene and suppress coke formation"
[5] "The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are calculated to be in the region of 0.650.75 eV and 0.250.35 eV on the flat and stepped surfaces,respectively."
[6] "The recent theoretical studies, similar energy barriers with values in the range of 0.290.42 eV for the initial activation of ethane to ethylene on Pt(110)-(12) were obtained by Anghel et al."
[7] "The energy barriers for the CC bond breaking are lowered more significantly than those for the dehydrogenation steps with the reactions moving from the flat to stepped surface."

The document discusses the comparison between noble metal-based catalysts (specifically platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalyst types are not directly addressed. However, the document focuses on the use of platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It highlights the differences in energy barriers for the dehydrogenation process, the role of step sites on the surface, and the effect on the selectivity towards propylene and coke formation. The energy barriers for dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are lower on stepped surfaces compared to flat surfaces, indicating higher catalytic activity. The selectivity towards propylene is influenced by the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms. The document suggests that the cleaving of the CC bond may occur as the C3 intermediates are deeply dehydrogenated, starting with propyne. The overall reaction scheme for propane dehydrogenation is discussed, emphasizing the role of step sites during the quick deactivation stage and the transfer of the active center to the flat surface at the steady state.

本文讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中，基于贵金属（特别是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如铬氧化物、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）之间的比较。这些催化剂的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新进展以及在该领域的潜在优势并未直接提及。然而，文献重点研究了铂基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用。它强调了脱氢过程中的能量壁垒差异，表面台阶的作用，以及丙烯和焦炭形成的选择性。在台阶表面上，脱氢过程的能量壁垒低于平坦表面上，表明活性更高。丙烯的选择性受表面铂原子的配位不饱和状态的影响。文献指出，在深脱氢过程中，CC键断裂可能开始于丙炔，随着C3中间体的进一步深脱氢，CC键断裂发生，最终导致乙烷、甲烷和焦炭的形成。全文讨论了丙烷脱氢的总体反应方案，强调了台阶表面在快速失活阶段的作用以及活性中心从台阶表面转移到平坦表面的转移情况。
