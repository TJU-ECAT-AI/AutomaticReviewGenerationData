Before the run is also possible, particularly if the oxidation has led to sintering of the Pt into large, easily reduced particles (27).
PtSn/SiO2 shows a large H2 consumption, and the calcula- tions indicate a more complete reduction of Sn compared to the PtSn/c-Al2O3 sample. The TPR profile is poorly resolved, and detailed assignments of reduction peaks is difficult. Reoxidation shifts and changes the peaks some- what, without influencing the H2 consumption significantly.

The unpro- moted Pt/SiO2 catalyst showed peaks at 808C, at 2008C,and at the isothermal temperature (5508C). A weak feature can also be observed at 1508C.

The fraction of metallic tin in PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts has for PtSn/c-Al2O3 fits well with the desorption temperature of 4808C reported by Kramer and Andre (45) for atomic been reported to increase with repeated regeneration cy- cles (39).

Our TPR results fit this general pattern, and we conclude that tin is reducible and reflection of a difference in rates of spillover in the two cases. However, in this case the desorption of hydrogen alloying is possible when PtSn is supported on SiO2,whereas tin to a large extent is stabilized in the 12 state dissolved into possible PtSn phases cannot be excluded,since the desorption temperature is different. when PtSn is supported on c-Al2O3.

Pt sites are necessary for H2 dissociation,we cannot rule out the possibility that a small fraction of the tin is reduced to the metallic state also on c-Al2O3. and the amounts of hydrogen desorbed, corresponding to many monolayers on the available Pt, confirm that the The TPR of the reoxidized samples shows that reduction oxidation cycles influence the reduction properties.

This could indicate that the Platinum Dispersion and Chemisorption Properties large amount of desorbed hydrogen should be attributed to other hydrogen species, e.g., species formed with the PtSn The pulse chemisorption data reported here (Table 4) show an increase in hydrogen uptake with tin addition on both phase.

Catalytic Activity, Selectivity and Stability In Table 5 the initial activities from these experiments are compared to some other results from similar systems.
The table shows relative data, where the specific activity SiO2 is an order of magnitude less active on a TOF basis (Fig. 6). This confirms similar results reported by others of Pt/Al2O3 (on a TOF basis) is taken as the standard. The results from Yarusov et al. (46) show the same trend as (Table 5). In other words, surface Pt atoms in PtSn/Al2O3 and surface Pt atoms in unpromoted catalysts behave simi- our data. Furthermore, they have included PtSn alloys in their experiments, showing that a PtSn alloy surface is larly in this respect, whereas surface Pt in PtSn/SiO2 is less active and behaves as Pt in PtSn alloys (46). This is in line about one-tenth as active as the Pt alone and very similar to the PtSn/SiO2 sample. Berndt et al. (47) report the same with our characterization data. The TPR results show that Sn in PtSn/SiO2 is close to being completely reduced, and specific activity of Pt and PtSn on h-Al2O3 in cyclohexane dehydrogenation, but when the typical catalytic-reforming thus alloying with Pt is possible, whereas in PtSn/c-Al2O3 the Sn is only partly reduced. The difference in PtSn/c- reaction aromatization (dehydrocyclization) of n-heptane to toluene was studied, they found a very different trend, Al2O3 and PtSn/SiO2 is further underlined by the purging experiments. Over the PtSn/c-Al2O3 catalyst adsorbed hy- with the PtSn sample being about five times more active (per surface Pt) than the unpromoted sample. drogen aids in maintaining catalyst activity (Fig. 7a), most probably by reducing coking on the metal.
