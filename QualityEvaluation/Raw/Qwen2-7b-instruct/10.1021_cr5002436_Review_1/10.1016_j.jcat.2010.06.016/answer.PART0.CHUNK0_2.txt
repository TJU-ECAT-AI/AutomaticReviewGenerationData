[1] "Recent studies have shown that calcined hydrotalcites, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are good supports for Pt-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes and hydrogen [19]."
[2] "Such materials are hydrothermally stable and are capable of dis-persing small Pt particles due to the presence of Al cations at the support surface [10]."
[3] "High alkene selectivity,minimal coke formation, and better catalyst activity can be achieved by promoting Pt supported on Mg(Al)O or other supports with elements such as Sn, Ga, and Ge [9,1416,18]."
[4] "Hydrotalcites were prepared with Ga cations substituting for Al,i.e., Mg(Ga)(Al)O following the procedure described in [19]."
[5] "When Pt was dispersed on these materials and reduced at 873 K, Ga3+ cat- ions present at the surface of the support were reduced to Ga atoms, which then formed PtGa alloys with the dispersed Pt nanoparticles."
[6] "The presence of such alloys was confirmed by EXAFS, STEM-EDX, and high-resolution TEM."
[7] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[8] "Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case."
[9] "Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."
[10] "The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the document highlights several key aspects:

1. Platinum-based catalysts supported on hydrotalcites, such as Mg(Al)O, are effective for dehydrogenating light alkanes into alkenes and hydrogen. These catalysts are hydrothermally stable, capable of dispersing small platinum particles due to aluminum cations at the surface. Promoting these catalysts with elements like tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), indium (In), vanadium (V), zinc (Zn), and molybdenum (Mo) oxides can improve alkene selectivity, minimize coke formation, and boost catalyst activity.

2. Gallium (Ga) substitution in the hydrotalcite structure (Mg(Ga)(Al)O) allows for the formation of PtGa alloys when reduced at 873 K. These alloys were confirmed through various characterization techniques. 

3. The amount of coke deposited during propane dehydrogenation is less than during ethane dehydrogenation, and there is no correlation between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. 

4. The extent of catalyst deactivation is lower for ethane than for propane, yet more coke is deposited during ethane dehydrogenation. This suggests that most of the coke resides on the support rather than on the Pt particles.

5. The higher deactivation observed in propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane compared to ethane.

The document provides insights into the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

比较贵金属催化剂，特别是铂基催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，文献中强调了几个关键点：

1. 以镁铝氧（Mg(Al)O）为基础的铂催化剂对于轻烷烃脱氢成烯烃和氢气是有效的。这些催化剂具有水热稳定性，能够分散小颗粒的铂，这得益于支持表面存在的铝离子。通过锡（Sn）、镓（Ga）、铟（In）、钒（V）、锌（Zn）和钼（Mo）氧化物等元素的促进，可以提高烯烃的选择性、减少焦炭形成，并提升催化剂活性。

2. 镓（Ga）在水滑石结构中的替换（Mg(Ga)(Al)O）允许在873 K下还原时形成PtGa合金。这些合金通过各种表征技术得到了确认。

3. 在丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭量少于乙烷脱氢，且焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间没有相关性。

4. 对乙烷脱氢的催化剂失活程度低于丙烷，但乙烷脱氢时沉积的焦炭量更多。这表明大部分焦炭存在于支撑体上，而不是铂粒子上。

5. 在丙烷脱氢中观察到的更高失活是由丙烷产生的焦炭前体对铂的覆盖度高于乙烷所致。

文献提供了催化剂组成、有效性、工业应用、最新进展以及在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域潜在优势的见解。
