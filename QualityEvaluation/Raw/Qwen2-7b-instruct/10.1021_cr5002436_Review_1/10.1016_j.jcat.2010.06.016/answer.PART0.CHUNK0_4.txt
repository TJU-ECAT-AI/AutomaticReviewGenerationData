[1] "We have shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts prepared by the method described in Part I of this work leads to an active alkane dehydrogenation catalyst that is highly selective for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively."
[2] "Catalyst performance of novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation Georges Siddiqi, Pingping Sun, Vladimir Galvita, Alexis T. Bell *"
[3] "Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."
[4] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[5] "The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane."

The document discusses the use of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, showing they are effective for producing ethene and propene respectively. The catalysts are selective, deposit less coke, and show less deactivation compared to traditional bimetallic catalysts. The peak activity is attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys upon reduction. Adding hydrogen to the feed enhances alkene formation but reduces it as the alkene concentration approaches equilibrium. Coke formation and accumulation are greater for ethane than propane, with less of the coke residing on the Pt particles. The higher deactivation during propane dehydrogenation is due to a greater coverage of Pt by coke precursors from propane.

该文献讨论了用于脱氢乙烷和丙烷的Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂的应用，显示它们能够有效生产乙烯和丙烯。催化剂具有选择性、沉积较少的焦炭，并且与传统双金属催化剂相比表现出较少的失活。活性峰值归因于在873 K下还原时形成的PtGa合金。向反应物中添加氢气可以增加烯烃的形成速率，但在接近平衡转化率时，随着氢气浓度的增加，形成烯烃的速率会降低。焦炭的生成和积累对于乙烷大于丙烷，其中大部分焦炭位于支撑体上，只有少量位于铂颗粒表面。丙烷脱氢的更高失活是由于丙烷产生的焦炭前体在铂表面覆盖得更多。
