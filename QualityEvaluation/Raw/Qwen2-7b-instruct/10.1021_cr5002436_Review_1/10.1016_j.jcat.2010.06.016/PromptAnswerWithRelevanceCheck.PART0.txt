The study investigates the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a novel magnesium gallium aluminum oxide (Mg(Ga)(Al)O) mixed oxide support for a platinum (Pt) catalyst. The presence of PtGa alloys was confirmed using EXAFS, STEM-EDX, and high-resolution TEM techniques. The study also reveals that propane dehydrogenation experiences higher levels of deactivation compared to ethane due to a greater coverage of Pt by coke precursors from propane than from ethane.

[1] "Recent studies have shown that calcined hydrotalcites, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are good supports for Pt-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes and hydrogen [19]."
[2] "Such materials are hydrothermally stable and are capable of dis-persing small Pt particles due to the presence of Al cations at the support surface [10]."
[3] "High alkene selectivity,minimal coke formation, and better catalyst activity can be achieved by promoting Pt supported on Mg(Al)O or other supports with elements such as Sn, Ga, and Ge [9,1416,18]."
[4] "Hydrotalcites were prepared with Ga cations substituting for Al,i.e., Mg(Ga)(Al)O following the procedure described in [19]."
[5] "When Pt was dispersed on these materials and reduced at 873 K, Ga3+ cat- ions present at the surface of the support were reduced to Ga atoms, which then formed PtGa alloys with the dispersed Pt nanoparticles."
[6] "The presence of such alloys was confirmed by EXAFS, STEM-EDX, and high-resolution TEM."
[7] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[8] "Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the document highlights several key aspects:

1. Platinum-based catalysts supported on hydrotalcites, such as Mg(Al)O, are effective for dehydrogenating light alkanes into alkenes and hydrogen. These catalysts are hydrothermally stable, capable of dispersing small platinum particles due to aluminum cations at the surface. Promoting these catalysts with elements like tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), indium (In), vanadium (V), zinc (Zn), and molybdenum (Mo) oxides can improve alkene selectivity, minimize coke formation, and boost catalyst activity.

2. Gallium (Ga) substitution in the hydrotalcite structure (Mg(Ga)(Al)O) allows for the formation of PtGa alloys when reduced at 873 K. These alloys were confirmed through various characterization techniques. 

3. The amount of coke deposited during propane dehydrogenation is less than during ethane dehydrogenation, and there is no correlation between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. 

4. The extent of catalyst deactivation is lower for ethane than for propane, yet more coke is deposited during ethane dehydrogenation. This suggests that most of the coke resides on the support rather than on the Pt particles.

5. The higher deactivation observed in propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane compared to ethane.

The document provides insights into the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

比较贵金属催化剂，特别是铂基催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，文献中强调了几个关键点：

1. 以镁铝氧（Mg(Al)O）为基础的铂催化剂对于轻烷烃脱氢成烯烃和氢气是有效的。这些催化剂具有水热稳定性，能够分散小颗粒的铂，这得益于支持表面存在的铝离子。通过锡（Sn）、镓（Ga）、铟（In）、钒（V）、锌（Zn）和钼（Mo）氧化物等元素的促进，可以提高烯烃的选择性、减少焦炭形成，并提升催化剂活性。

2. 镓（Ga）在水滑石结构中的替换（Mg(Ga)(Al)O）允许在873 K下还原时形成PtGa合金。这些合金通过各种表征技术得到了确认。

3. 在丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭量少于乙烷脱氢，且焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间没有相关性。

4. 对乙烷脱氢的催化剂失活程度低于丙烷，但乙烷脱氢时沉积的焦炭量更多。这表明大部分焦炭存在于支撑体上，而不是铂粒子上。

5. 在丙烷脱氢中观察到的更高失活是由丙烷产生的焦炭前体对铂的覆盖度高于乙烷所致。

文献提供了催化剂组成、有效性、工业应用、最新进展以及在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域潜在优势的见解。

The dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a Pt catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support was investigated. Catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support,a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4, and selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the use of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, showing they are effective for producing ethene and propene respectively. The catalysts are selective, deposit less coke, and show less deactivation compared to traditional bimetallic catalysts. The peak activity is attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys upon reduction. Adding hydrogen to the feed enhances alkene formation but reduces it as the alkene concentration approaches equilibrium. Coke formation and accumulation are greater for ethane than propane, with less of the coke residing on the Pt particles. The higher deactivation during propane dehydrogenation is due to a greater coverage of Pt by coke precursors from propane.

该文献讨论了用于脱氢乙烷和丙烷的Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂的应用，显示它们能够有效生产乙烯和丙烯。催化剂具有选择性、沉积较少的焦炭，并且与传统双金属催化剂相比表现出较少的失活。活性峰值归因于在873 K下还原时形成的PtGa合金。向反应物中添加氢气可以增加烯烃的形成速率，但在接近平衡转化率时，随着氢气浓度的增加，形成烯烃的速率会降低。焦炭的生成和积累对于乙烷大于丙烷，其中大部分焦炭位于支撑体上，只有少量位于铂颗粒表面。丙烷脱氢的更高失活是由于丙烷产生的焦炭前体在铂表面覆盖得更多。
