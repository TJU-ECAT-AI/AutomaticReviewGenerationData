The study investigates the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a novel magnesium gallium aluminum oxide (Mg(Ga)(Al)O) mixed oxide support for a platinum (Pt) catalyst. The presence of PtGa alloys was confirmed using EXAFS, STEM-EDX, and high-resolution TEM techniques. The study also reveals that propane dehydrogenation experiences higher levels of deactivation compared to ethane due to a greater coverage of Pt by coke precursors from propane than from ethane.

该研究探讨了使用新型镁镓铝氧化物（Mg(Ga)(Al)O）混合氧化物支持的铂（Pt）催化剂对乙烷和丙烷的脱氢作用。通过EXAFS、STEM-EDX和高分辨率TEM技术证实了PtGa合金的存在。研究表明，与乙烷相比，丙烷脱氢过程中Pt的活性丧失更多，这是由于丙烷中形成的焦炭前体在Pt表面覆盖量大于乙烷。
