Catalyst performance of novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation Georges Siddiqi, Pingping Sun, Vladimir Galvita, Alexis T. Bell * Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1462, USA
The dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a Pt catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support was investigated. Catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support,a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4, and selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4.

The study investigates the use of novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. Catalyst performance is highly dependent on the Ga content in the support, with a peak in activity occurring at a Ga/Pt ratio of 1.45.4 for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Selectivity is also influenced by the Ga/Pt ratio, reaching almost 100% at a ratio of 5.4.

The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane.

The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Given that the quantity of carbon deposited as coke exceeds the exposed Pt amount, it is deduced that most of the coke is situated on the support, while only a minor portion is on the Pt particles.
