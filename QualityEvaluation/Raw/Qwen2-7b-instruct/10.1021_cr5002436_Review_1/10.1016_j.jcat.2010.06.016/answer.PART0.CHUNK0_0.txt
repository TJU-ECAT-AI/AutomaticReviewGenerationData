"The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The greater degree of deactivation observed during propane compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of the platinum by coke precursors derived from propane rather than ethane.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
丙烷脱氢过程中观察到的更高程度的失活归因于由丙烷而非乙烷产生的焦炭前体在铂上的覆盖度较高。
