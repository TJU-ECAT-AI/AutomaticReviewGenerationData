[1] "Supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts are widely used for reforming and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the petroleum industry and for selective hydrogenation reactions in fine chemistry because of their better performance, in terms of activity and stability, than monometallic platinum catalyst."
[2] "In the field of fine chemistry, the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to obtain the corresponding unsaturated alcohols is a reaction of industrial importance."
[3] "Another way of improving the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol is the use of supports such as CeO2 [19 21], TiO2 [11,22], ZnO [23], MgO [18], or SnO2 [24] that can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system."
[4] "The preparation mode of bimetallic catalysts has a great importance, because the interaction between both metals and the support, which determines the catalytic behaviour, depends greatly on the preparation method used."

The document discusses the use of bimetallic PtSn catalysts in various chemical processes, highlighting their superior performance in comparison to monometallic platinum catalysts. These catalysts are used for reforming and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the petroleum industry, as well as in fine chemistry for selective hydrogenation reactions. The addition of tin to platinum modifies the selectivity in naphtha reforming and improves the selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, particularly for converting a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to corresponding unsaturated alcohols. Supports like CeO2, TiO2, ZnO, MgO, and SnO2 can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system, enhancing their efficiency. The preparation method of these catalysts significantly influences their behavior due to the interaction between metals and the support, affecting their activity and selectivity.

文档讨论了PtSn双金属催化剂在不同化学过程中的应用，强调了与单金属铂催化剂相比，它们在石油工业中的重整和脱氢以及精细化学中选择性氢化反应中的优越性能。这些催化剂用于石油产品的重整和脱氢，以及将a,b不饱和醛转化为相应的不饱和醇的精细化学中的选择性氢化反应。通过向铂中添加锡来改变选择性，在加氢过程中提高了选择性。CeO2、TiO2、ZnO、MgO和SnO2等支持物可以修改分散金属或双金属系统的催化性能，从而提高其效率。这些催化剂的制备方法对其行为有很大影响，因为金属和载体之间的相互作用决定了催化行为，这取决于制备方法。
