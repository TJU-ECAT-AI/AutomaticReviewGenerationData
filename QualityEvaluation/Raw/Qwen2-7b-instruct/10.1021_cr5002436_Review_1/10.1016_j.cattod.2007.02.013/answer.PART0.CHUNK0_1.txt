[1] "In the field of fine chemistry, the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to obtain the corresponding unsaturated alcohols is a reaction of industrial importance."
[2] "An improvement in the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol can be often obtained by the addition of a second metal of the first transition row, a p block metal or an alkali element."
[3] "The enhancement of catalytic selectivity by addition of tin has been explained as a result of the cooperation of two phenomena. On one hand, the carbonyl group is activated by ionic tin species, which interact with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond and thus facilitate its hydrogenation. On the other hand, the dilution of platinum atoms by metallic tin hinders the hydrogenation of the C-C bond and suppresses the readsorption of the unsaturated alcohol formed, thus inhibiting its isomerisation to the saturated aldehyde and even its further hydrogenation to the saturated alcohol."
[4] "Another way of improving the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol is the use of supports such as CeO2, TiO2, ZnO, MgO, or SnO2 that can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system."
[5] "The preparation mode of bimetallic catalysts has a great importance, because the interaction between both metals and the support, which determines the catalytic behaviour, depends greatly on the preparation method used."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts (especially platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses on platinum and tin-based catalysts on titania supports. It highlights that tin addition enhances selectivity in the hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to form unsaturated alcohols. This is attributed to the activation of the carbonyl group by ionic tin species and the hindrance of the C-C bond hydrogenation by metallic tin. The use of supports like ceria, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, or tin oxide modifies the catalytic properties of the dispersed metals or bimetallic systems. The preparation method of bimetallic catalysts significantly influences their behavior due to the interaction between the metals and the support, which depends on the preparation technique used.

文档讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中使用贵金属催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）。文档重点介绍了铂和锡基催化剂在钛酸盐支持上的应用。它强调了锡添加可以提高a,b-不饱和醛的氢化形成不饱和醇的选择性。这归因于离子锡物种激活羰基基团以及由金属锡阻碍C-C键氢化并抑制形成的不饱和醇的再吸附，从而抑制其异构化为饱和醛甚至进一步氢化为饱和醇。使用诸如氧化铈、二氧化钛、氧化锌、氧化镁或二氧化锡之类的支持可以修改分散金属或双金属体系的催化性能。双金属催化剂的制备方法对其行为有重大影响，因为金属与支撑之间的相互作用决定了催化行为，这取决于所使用的制备技术。
