The preparation mode of bimetallic catalysts has a great importance, because the interaction between both metals and the support, which determines the catalytic behaviour, depends greatly on the preparation method used.
The aim of this work has been the study of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, with different Pt:Sn atomic ratios prepared by two different methods: coimpregnation of both metal precursors or successive impregnation with the tin precursor loaded first.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study focuses on the preparation of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with various Pt:Sn atomic ratios using two distinct methods: coimpregnation of both metal precursors and successive impregnation with the tin precursor loaded initially. The choice of preparation method significantly influences the catalyst's behavior due to the impact on the interaction between the metals and the support.
