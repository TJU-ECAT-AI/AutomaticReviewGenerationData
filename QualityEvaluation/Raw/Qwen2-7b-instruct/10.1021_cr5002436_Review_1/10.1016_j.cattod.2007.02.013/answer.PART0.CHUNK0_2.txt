[1] "Supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts are widely used for reforming and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the petroleum industry and for selective hydrogenation reactions in fine chemistry because of their better performance, in terms of activity and stability, than monometallic platinum catalyst."
[2] "In the field of fine chemistry, the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to obtain the corresponding unsaturated alcohols is a reaction of industrial importance."
[3] "Since the hydrogenation of the C=C bond is thermodynamically favored, the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol is generally poor. In this case, monometallic platinum catalysts give no or a very low selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol."
[4] "An improvement in the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol can be often obtained by the addition of a second metal of the first transition row, a p block metal or an alkali element."
[5] "Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this interaction could also modify the activity and selectivity of noble metal in different reactions, such as those involving molecules containing carbonyl bonds."
[6] "The preparation mode of bimetallic catalysts has a great importance, because the interaction between both metals and the support, which determines the catalytic behaviour, depends greatly on the preparation method used."

The document discusses the use of bimetallic PtSn catalysts in the petroleum industry and fine chemistry. These catalysts are preferred over monometallic platinum catalysts due to their superior performance in terms of activity and stability. They are particularly useful in the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to produce unsaturated alcohols. The addition of a second metal, such as tin (Sn), can improve the selectivity of these reactions. The document also highlights the importance of the preparation method in determining the catalytic behavior of bimetallic catalysts. The interaction between the metals and the support, along with the preparation method, plays a crucial role in modifying the activity and selectivity of noble metals in various reactions.
