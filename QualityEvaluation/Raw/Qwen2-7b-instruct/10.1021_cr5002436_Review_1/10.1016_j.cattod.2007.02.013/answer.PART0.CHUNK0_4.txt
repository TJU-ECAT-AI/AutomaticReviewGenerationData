[1] "In this work has been the study of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, with different Pt:Sn atomic ratios prepared by two different methods: coimpregnation of both metal precursors or succes- sive impregnation with the tin precursor loaded first."
[2] "The aim of this work has been the study of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, with different Pt:Sn atomic ratios prepared by two different methods: coimpregnation of both metal precursors or succes- sive impregnation with the tin precursor loaded first."
[3] "The preparation mode of bimetallic catalysts has a great importance, because the interaction between both metals and the support, which determines the catalytic behaviour, depends greatly on the preparation method used."
[4] "The catalysts were tested in the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
[5] "The selectivity toward crotyl alcohol was higher after reduction at 773 K and independent of the preparation method, although it increased with the amount of tin, suggesting a promoting effect of tin on this reaction."
[6] "The term strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) was introduced to describe this effect."
[7] "Some years later, these authors suggested that the migration of reduced species from the support onto the metal particle occurred after reduction at high temperature."
[8] "Moreover, the creation of special sites at the interface between the metal and the partially reduced support would account for the enhanced selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols."
[9] "The binding energies of the Pt 4f7/2 and Sn 3d3/2 levels for the catalysts reduced in situ at 473 and 773 K for 1 h are reported in Table 1."
[10] "In this region, the spectra show two peaks. The one at lower binding energy corresponds to Pt 4f7/2 level and the second one, at higher binding energies, to the Pt 4f5/2 level."

The study focused on bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with various Pt:Sn atomic ratios, prepared through two distinct methods: coimpregnation of both metal precursors or sequential impregnation with the tin precursor added first. The researchers aimed to explore the influence of preparation methods on the catalyst's behavior. The catalysts were utilized for the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Reduction at 773 K led to higher selectivity for crotyl alcohol compared to 473 K, with tin's presence enhancing this selectivity. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) concept was introduced to explain how the interaction between the metals and the support affects the catalyst's performance. This interaction was further explained by the migration of reduced species from the support to the metal particle after high-temperature reduction. The creation of unique sites at the interface between the metal and the partially reduced support was proposed to enhance the selectivity for unsaturated alcohols. The binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 and Sn 3d3/2 levels were measured for the catalysts reduced at 473 and 773 K.

本研究关注于不同Pt:Sn原子比的双金属PtSn/TiO2催化剂，通过两种不同的方法制备：将两种金属前体同时浸渍或先将锡前体加载进行连续浸渍。研究者旨在探索制备方法对催化剂行为的影响。这些催化剂用于选择性氢化丙酮醛。在773 K下的还原提高了异丁醇的选择性，与473 K相比，这一选择性独立于制备方法，并随着锡含量的增加而提高，这表明锡对此反应具有促进作用。引入了强金属-支撑相互作用（SMSI）的概念来解释金属和支撑之间的相互作用如何影响催化剂性能。这种相互作用进一步解释为在高温还原后，从支撑迁移到金属颗粒的还原物种。提出在金属和部分还原支持界面处创建的独特位点可以增强不饱和醇的选择性。测量了在473 K和773 K下还原的Pt 4f7/2和Sn 3d3/2能级的结合能。
