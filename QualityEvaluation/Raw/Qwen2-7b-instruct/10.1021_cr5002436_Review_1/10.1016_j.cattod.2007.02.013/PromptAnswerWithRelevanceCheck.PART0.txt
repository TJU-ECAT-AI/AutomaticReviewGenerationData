[1] "Supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts are widely used for reforming and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the petroleum industry and for selective hydrogenation reactions in fine chemistry because of their better performance, in terms of activity and stability, than monometallic platinum catalyst."
[2] "In the field of fine chemistry, the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to obtain the corresponding unsaturated alcohols is a reaction of industrial importance."
[3] "Another way of improving the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol is the use of supports such as CeO2 [19 21], TiO2 [11,22], ZnO [23], MgO [18], or SnO2 [24] that can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system."
[4] "The preparation mode of bimetallic catalysts has a great importance, because the interaction between both metals and the support, which determines the catalytic behaviour, depends greatly on the preparation method used."

The document discusses the use of bimetallic PtSn catalysts in various chemical processes, highlighting their superior performance in comparison to monometallic platinum catalysts. These catalysts are used for reforming and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the petroleum industry, as well as in fine chemistry for selective hydrogenation reactions. The addition of tin to platinum modifies the selectivity in naphtha reforming and improves the selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, particularly for converting a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to corresponding unsaturated alcohols. Supports like CeO2, TiO2, ZnO, MgO, and SnO2 can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system, enhancing their efficiency. The preparation method of these catalysts significantly influences their behavior due to the interaction between metals and the support, affecting their activity and selectivity.

文档讨论了PtSn双金属催化剂在不同化学过程中的应用，强调了与单金属铂催化剂相比，它们在石油工业中的重整和脱氢以及精细化学中选择性氢化反应中的优越性能。这些催化剂用于石油产品的重整和脱氢，以及将a,b不饱和醛转化为相应的不饱和醇的精细化学中的选择性氢化反应。通过向铂中添加锡来改变选择性，在加氢过程中提高了选择性。CeO2、TiO2、ZnO、MgO和SnO2等支持物可以修改分散金属或双金属系统的催化性能，从而提高其效率。这些催化剂的制备方法对其行为有很大影响，因为金属和载体之间的相互作用决定了催化行为，这取决于制备方法。

[1] "In the field of fine chemistry, the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to obtain the corresponding unsaturated alcohols is a reaction of industrial importance."
[2] "An improvement in the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol can be often obtained by the addition of a second metal of the first transition row, a p block metal or an alkali element."
[3] "The enhancement of catalytic selectivity by addition of tin has been explained as a result of the cooperation of two phenomena. On one hand, the carbonyl group is activated by ionic tin species, which interact with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond and thus facilitate its hydrogenation. On the other hand, the dilution of platinum atoms by metallic tin hinders the hydrogenation of the C-C bond and suppresses the readsorption of the unsaturated alcohol formed, thus inhibiting its isomerisation to the saturated aldehyde and even its further hydrogenation to the saturated alcohol."
[4] "Another way of improving the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol is the use of supports such as CeO2, TiO2, ZnO, MgO, or SnO2 that can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system."
[5] "The preparation mode of bimetallic catalysts has a great importance, because the interaction between both metals and the support, which determines the catalytic behaviour, depends greatly on the preparation method used."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts (especially platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses on platinum and tin-based catalysts on titania supports. It highlights that tin addition enhances selectivity in the hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to form unsaturated alcohols. This is attributed to the activation of the carbonyl group by ionic tin species and the hindrance of the C-C bond hydrogenation by metallic tin. The use of supports like ceria, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, or tin oxide modifies the catalytic properties of the dispersed metals or bimetallic systems. The preparation method of bimetallic catalysts significantly influences their behavior due to the interaction between the metals and the support, which depends on the preparation technique used.

文档讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中使用贵金属催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）。文档重点介绍了铂和锡基催化剂在钛酸盐支持上的应用。它强调了锡添加可以提高a,b-不饱和醛的氢化形成不饱和醇的选择性。这归因于离子锡物种激活羰基基团以及由金属锡阻碍C-C键氢化并抑制形成的不饱和醇的再吸附，从而抑制其异构化为饱和醛甚至进一步氢化为饱和醇。使用诸如氧化铈、二氧化钛、氧化锌、氧化镁或二氧化锡之类的支持可以修改分散金属或双金属体系的催化性能。双金属催化剂的制备方法对其行为有重大影响，因为金属与支撑之间的相互作用决定了催化行为，这取决于所使用的制备技术。

The study focused on bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with various Pt:Sn atomic ratios, prepared through two distinct methods: coimpregnation of both metal precursors or sequential impregnation with the tin precursor added first. The researchers aimed to explore the influence of preparation methods on the catalyst's behavior. The catalysts were utilized for the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Reduction at 773 K led to higher selectivity for crotyl alcohol compared to 473 K, with tin's presence enhancing this selectivity. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) concept was introduced to explain how the interaction between the metals and the support affects the catalyst's performance. This interaction was further explained by the migration of reduced species from the support to the metal particle after high-temperature reduction. The creation of unique sites at the interface between the metal and the partially reduced support was proposed to enhance the selectivity for unsaturated alcohols. The binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 and Sn 3d3/2 levels were measured for the catalysts reduced at 473 and 773 K.
