Noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, are widely used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high activity and selectivity. They have been employed industrially for decades, particularly for the production of linear olefins for detergents. Recent advancements include the use of Platinum-Sn catalysts that enhance selectivity towards mono-olefins. Metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides provide alternative options, but they often lack the high selectivity and activity of noble metals. CrOx catalysts are used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, while gallium, indium, and vanadium oxides have shown promising activity in dehydrogenation studies. Zinc and molybdenum oxides have also been applied, though their selectivity and stability are less well-established. These metal oxide catalysts can be cost-effective alternatives to noble metals, but they often require optimization for specific applications.

贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，广泛用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢，由于其高活性和选择性。它们已经被工业应用几十年，尤其是用于洗涤剂用线性烯烃的生产。最近的发展包括使用铂锡催化剂，这可以提高单烯烃的选择性。金属氧化物催化剂如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物提供了替代方案，但它们往往缺乏贵金属的高选择性和活性。CrOx催化剂用于乙烷脱氢生成乙烯，而镓、铟和钒氧化物在脱氢研究中显示出有希望的活性。锌和钼氧化物也已被应用，尽管它们的选择性和稳定性不太明确。这些金属氧化物催化剂可以作为贵金属的低成本替代品，但它们通常需要针对特定应用进行优化。
