Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find that both categories play crucial roles. Platinum catalysts are noted for their high activity and selectivity, making them ideal for producing light olefins efficiently. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, have shown promise in achieving high conversion rates but may struggle with maintaining high selectivity. Recent advancements have focused on enhancing the selectivity of metal oxide catalysts through the use of gallium and indium oxides. Industrial applications of noble metal catalysts include the manufacturing of detergents and biodegradable detergents. Metal oxide catalysts are being actively researched for their potential in reducing environmental impacts by avoiding the use of hazardous oxidants.
