[1] "During World War II, catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes, which were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel."
[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."
[3] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
[4] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
[5] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
[6] "Noble metal (Pt) catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
[7] "Synthetic detergents, based on the use of branched alkylbenzene sulfonates derived from propylene tetramer and benzene, had been introduced in the 1940s."
[8] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[9] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR."

Comparison and contrast of noble metal-based catalysts (especially Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins:

1. **Noble Metal-Based Catalysts (Platinum):**
   - Composition: Platinum (Pt) catalysts are highly active for dehydrogenation reactions. They are used in the Oleflex process for dehydrogenation of light paraffins to produce olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene. Platinum is dispersed on a high surface-area support, typically alumina, to achieve high selectivity and activity.
   - Effectiveness: Platinum catalysts offer high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. They enable continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, which maintains their activity for several years without requiring shutdowns for regeneration.
   - Industrial Applications: Platinum catalysts are widely used in commercial processes for dehydrogenation of propane and butanes, as well as in the production of detergents. They are also used in the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane.
   - Recent Developments: Platinum catalysts have been optimized for improved stability and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the Oleflex process for propylene and isobutylene production. The use of CCR technology has enhanced their efficiency and economic viability.
   - Potential Advantages: Noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, offer high activity, selectivity, and stability, making them advantageous in dehydrogenation processes. They facilitate efficient and economic production of olefins and detergents.

2. **Metal Oxide-Based Catalysts:**
   - Composition: Metal oxide catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are used for dehydrogenation and oxydehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts can exhibit different reactivity and selectivity depending on the specific metal oxide and reaction conditions.
   - Effectiveness: Metal oxide catalysts can be effective in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for the production of olefins from paraffins. They may offer competitive alternatives to noble metal catalysts in terms of cost and sustainability.
   - Industrial Applications: Metal oxide catalysts have been explored for various dehydrogenation processes, including ethane oxydehydrogenation and propane oxydehydrogenation, aiming to improve selectivity and reduce environmental impacts.
   - Recent Developments: Research on metal oxide catalysts has focused on improving their activity, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions. New catalyst designs and synthesis methods aim to optimize their performance in various applications.
   - Potential Advantages: Metal oxide catalysts can provide cost-effective solutions for dehydrogenation processes, especially in scenarios where noble metals are expensive or scarce. They offer opportunities for sustainable and environmentally friendly production methods.

Both noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts play crucial roles in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum, are widely used for their high activity, selectivity, and stability in commercial processes. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, offer potential for cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability, with ongoing research aimed at enhancing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions.
