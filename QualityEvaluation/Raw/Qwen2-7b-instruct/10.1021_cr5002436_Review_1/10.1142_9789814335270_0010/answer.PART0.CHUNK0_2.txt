Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins employs noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum alongside metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Metal oxide catalysts are noted for their affordability, robustness, and stability under challenging conditions. Chromium oxide (CrOx) is particularly effective due to its high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes. Gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are also employed thanks to their distinctive properties that enhance catalytic efficiency. Recent advancements aim to optimize synthesis techniques and additivation to boost activity and durability. Metal oxide catalysts' cost-effectiveness presents a viable option for industrial use, where noble metals may be too costly or scarce.
