[1] "Platinum-based catalysts have been traditionally favored for nonoxidative dehydrogenation due to their high activity and selectivity."
[2] "CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides offer alternative routes for the dehydrogenation process, providing a more cost-effective solution compared to precious metals."
[3] "Recent developments in catalyst synthesis have led to the creation of novel materials that combine the benefits of both noble metals and metal oxides, aiming to achieve high efficiency and selectivity while maintaining affordability."
[4] "Industrial applications of these catalysts are widespread, from petrochemical industries to the production of high-value chemicals, demonstrating their versatility and importance in chemical engineering."
[5] "Advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include superior activity and selectivity, making them ideal for specific applications. However, they are expensive and their usage is limited due to high costs."
[6] "Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are more cost-effective and can be synthesized in larger quantities. Their performance is highly dependent on the type of oxide and its surface chemistry."
