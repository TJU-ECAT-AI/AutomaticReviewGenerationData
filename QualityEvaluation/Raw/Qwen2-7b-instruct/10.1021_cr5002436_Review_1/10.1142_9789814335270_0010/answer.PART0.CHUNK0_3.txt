Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins involves the use of both noble metal-based catalysts, exemplified by platinum, which are renowned for their high activity and selectivity, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Noble metals are highly effective but can be more expensive and less stable compared to metal oxides. Recent advancements aim to enhance the activity and stability of metal oxide catalysts to match noble metal performance while preserving cost-effectiveness. Metal oxides offer benefits like resistance to sintering, lower cost, and recyclability potential.

非氧化脱氢化轻烯烃过程中，使用了两种催化剂：贵金属基催化剂（例如铂），以其高活性和选择性而著称；以及金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物），由于其成本效益和稳定性而被广泛应用。贵金属表现出卓越性能，但价格较高且稳定性较差，相比之下，金属氧化物具有优势。近年来，研究重点在于提升金属氧化物催化剂的活性与稳定性，以达到与贵金属相当的水平，同时保持成本效益。金属氧化物催化剂具有抗结块、成本低及可回收利用等优点。
