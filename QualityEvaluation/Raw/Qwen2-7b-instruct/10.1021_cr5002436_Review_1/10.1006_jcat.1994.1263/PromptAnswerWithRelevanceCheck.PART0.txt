Answer: Noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, excel in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high efficiency and product selectivity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized for their robustness and affordability, although they might show lower activity and selectivity compared to noble metals. Recent advancements aim to enhance the stability and performance of both catalyst types through alloying and surface engineering. In industry, noble metal catalysts are predominantly used in high-value manufacturing processes, whereas metal oxide catalysts are favored in large-scale operations prioritizing cost-effectiveness.
