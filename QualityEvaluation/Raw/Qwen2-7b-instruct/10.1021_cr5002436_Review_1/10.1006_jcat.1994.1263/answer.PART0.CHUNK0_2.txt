[1] "Noble metal-based catalysts, such as platinum, are widely used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high activity and selectivity."
[2] "Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer alternative options for this process, often providing cost-effective alternatives to noble metals."
[3] "Platinum-based catalysts exhibit superior performance in terms of activity and stability, making them the preferred choice in many industrial applications."
[4] "On the other hand, metal oxide catalysts are known for their durability and resistance to poisoning, which makes them particularly suitable for high-temperature and harsh environments."
[5] "Recent developments have focused on improving the efficiency of both types of catalysts through surface modification and alloying."
[6] "The choice between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts depends on factors such as cost, environmental impact, and specific operational requirements."

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins have distinct characteristics and applications. Noble metals like platinum are renowned for their high activity and selectivity, making them the go-to choice in many industrial settings. In contrast, metal oxide catalysts offer cost-effectiveness and durability, especially in high-temperature and harsh conditions. Recent advancements aim to enhance the efficiency of both types through modifications and alloying. The selection between these catalysts depends on factors including cost, environmental considerations, and specific operational needs.
