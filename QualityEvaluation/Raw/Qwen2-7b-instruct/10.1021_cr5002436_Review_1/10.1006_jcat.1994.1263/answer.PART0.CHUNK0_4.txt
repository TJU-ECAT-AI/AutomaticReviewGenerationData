Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are known for their high selectivity and activity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are gaining interest due to their potential in this field. While metal oxides may not match the activity of noble metals, they offer better stability under reaction conditions. Industrial applications include petrochemical processes aimed at enhancing efficiency and yield. Recent developments focus on improving the stability, activity, and energy efficiency of these catalysts. Noble metal-based catalysts excel in terms of activity and selectivity, whereas metal oxides might provide cost-effectiveness and enhanced durability.
