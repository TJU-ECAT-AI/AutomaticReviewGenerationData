Answer: Noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, excel in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high efficiency and product selectivity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized for their robustness and affordability, although they might show lower activity and selectivity compared to noble metals. Recent advancements aim to enhance the stability and performance of both catalyst types through alloying and surface engineering. In industry, noble metal catalysts are predominantly used in high-value manufacturing processes, whereas metal oxide catalysts are favored in large-scale operations prioritizing cost-effectiveness.

答案：由于其高效率和产物选择性，贵金属基催化剂，尤其是铂，广泛应用于轻烯烃的无氧化脱氢。金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，在这些过程中也被使用，主要是因为它们的稳定性和成本效益。然而，与贵金属相比，它们可能表现出较低的活性和选择性。近年来，通过合金化和表面工程改进了两种催化剂的稳定性和性能。在工业中，贵金属催化剂主要用于高价值制造过程，而金属氧化物催化剂则更倾向于在重视成本效益的大规模操作中使用。
