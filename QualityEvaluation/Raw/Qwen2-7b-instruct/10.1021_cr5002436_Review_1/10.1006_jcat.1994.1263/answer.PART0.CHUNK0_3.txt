Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, both are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are noted for their high selectivity and stability, which make them ideal for commercial use. Metal oxides, however, demonstrate superior thermal stability compared to noble metals. Recent advancements include the utilization of bimetallic systems and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to improve activity and selectivity. Both catalyst types find application in petrochemical processes, specifically for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons.

比较贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，以及CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂，在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中都有广泛使用。贵金属，特别是铂，以其高选择性和稳定性而著称，这使得它们适合商业应用。相比之下，金属氧化物表现出比贵金属更好的热稳定性。近期发展包括利用双金属体系和金属有机框架（MOFs）来提高活性和选择性。这两种催化剂都在石油化学过程中得到应用，特别是在芳烃的生产中。
