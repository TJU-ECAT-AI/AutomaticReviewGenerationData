[1] "The activities per g Pt of catalysts with various amounts of Pb or Sn and constant amount of 0.5 wt. % Pt are shown in Fig. 2. With increasing addition of Pb or Sn the rate of dehydrogenation is decreased and the activation energy increases."
[2] "Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb."
[3] "A correlation could be found between the weak adsorption of hydrogen and the activity in dehydrogenation."
[4] "The sites occupied at 573 K by strongly bound hydrogen seem to be inactive in the abstraction of hydrogen from the hydrocarbon and its desorption into the gas phase."

The study examines the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and chemisorption of H2 and O2 on supported Pt-Pb and Pt-Sn catalysts. As the amount of either metal increases, the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases, and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases. A correlation exists between the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and the dehydrogenation activity. The sites occupied by strongly bound hydrogen at 573 K appear to be inactive in the abstraction of hydrogen from the hydrocarbon and its desorption into the gas phase.

研究探讨了环己烷脱氢以及在Pt-Pb和Pt-Sn催化剂上H2和O2的化学吸附。随着第二种金属含量的增加，吸附氢的弱吸附量减少，吸附氧量增加，并且环己烷脱氢活性降低。弱吸附氢的数量与脱氢活性之间存在相关性。573 K时占据的强吸附氢位点似乎对从烃分子中提取氢原子以及将其释放到气相中的过程没有活性。
