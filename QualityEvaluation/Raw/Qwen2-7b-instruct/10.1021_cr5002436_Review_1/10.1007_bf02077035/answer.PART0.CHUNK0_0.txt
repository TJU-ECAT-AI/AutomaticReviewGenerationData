The study focuses on bimetallic Pt-Pb and Pt-Sn catalysts compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The Pt-Pb and Pt-Sn catalysts showed altered adsorption properties and dehydrogenation activities. Specifically, as the amount of the second metal increased, the adsorption of hydrogen at lower temperatures decreased significantly while the adsorption at higher temperatures increased slightly. Catalysts showing high hydrogen adsorption at higher temperatures were considered active in dehydrogenation processes. The authors suggest that the chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn, according to a协同 effect, might explain the changes in adsorption capacity. The study also indicates that small amounts of Sn are more toxic than Pb, affecting the catalyst's performance. A correlation was found between the weak adsorption of hydrogen and the dehydrogenation activity, suggesting that the number of active sites involved in the dehydrogenation process is proportional to the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen. Furthermore, it was observed that the sites occupied by strongly bound hydrogen at 573 K are inactive in the abstraction of hydrogen from hydrocarbons and subsequent desorption into the gas phase.

本研究关注了Pt-Pb和Pt-Sn双金属催化剂与单金属Pt催化剂的比较。Pt-Pb和Pt-Sn催化剂显示出不同的吸附性质和脱氢活性。具体而言，随着第二种金属含量的增加，低温下吸附的氢气量显著减少，而高温下的吸附量略有增加。在高氢吸附温度下表现出高活性的催化剂被认为是具有脱氢能力的。作者提出，根据协同效应，Pt通过Pb或Sn的化学修饰可能解释了吸附能力的变化。研究表明，少量的Sn比Pb更毒，影响催化剂性能。发现弱吸附氢与脱氢活性之间存在相关性，表明参与脱氢过程的活性位点的数量与弱吸附氢的数量成正比。此外，观察到在573 K时占据强烈结合氢的位点在从烃类分子中提取氢原子并将其解吸到气体相中的过程中是不活跃的。
