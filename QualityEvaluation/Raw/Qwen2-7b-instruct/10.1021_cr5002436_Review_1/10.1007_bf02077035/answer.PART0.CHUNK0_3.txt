[1] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of r/-A1203 with acidic solutions of H2ptcI6, and SnCI: or PbNOa."
[2] "The results, calculated in atomic rations H/Pt and O/Pt respectively, are shown in Fig. 1."
[3] "With increasing content of the second metal, the amount of hydrogens adsorbed at low temperature (nH2) decreases strongly and the amount adsorbed at high temperature (nH573) increases slightly."
[4] "The activities per g Pt of catalysts with various amounts of Pb or Sn and constant amount of 0.5 wt. % Pt are shown in Fig. 2."
[5] "This means that the number of weakly adsorbed hydrogen atoms is proportional to the number of active sites in the dehydrogenation process."

The study focuses on the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on supported Pt-Pb and Pt-Sn catalysts. As the amount of Pb or Sn increases, the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases, and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases. A correlation exists between the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and the dehydrogenation activity.

研究集中在Pt-Pb和Pt-Sn支持催化剂上环己烷的脱氢。随着铅或锡含量的增加，氢的弱吸附量减少，氧的吸附量增加，并且环己烷脱氢活性降低。弱吸附氢的数量与脱氢过程中的活性位点数量成正比。
