The study examines the influence of adding lead (Pb) and tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) catalysts, specifically focusing on their impact on the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the adsorption properties of hydrogen and oxygen. As the amount of Pb or Sn increases, the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases, and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases. A correlation exists between the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and the dehydrogenation activity. The mechanism of poisoning when Sn is added to the Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalyst is still unclear. The Pt dispersity in Pt-Sn catalysts can be determined through the adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen. The study also shows that the addition of Pb or Sn causes a decrease in activity and hydrogen adsorption. The results suggest that the strong influence on the adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts might be due to a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn. The activities per gram of Pt for catalysts with varying amounts of Pb or Sn are depicted in Figure 2, while the correlation between the dehydrogenation activity and the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen is illustrated in Figure 3.

研究探讨了向铂（Pt）催化剂中添加铅（Pb）和锡（Sn）的影响，特别是它们对环己烷脱氢以及氢气和氧气吸附性质的影响。随着Pb或Sn含量的增加，低温度下吸附的氢气量显著减少，高温下吸附的氢气量略有增加。环己烷脱氢活性降低。弱吸附氢的数量与脱氢活性之间存在相关性。当Sn添加到Pt/Al2O3重整催化剂中时，其机制仍不清楚。可以通过氢气和氧气的吸附来确定Pt-Sn催化剂中的Pt分散度。研究还表明，Pb或Sn的添加导致活性和氢气吸附量下降。结果表明，双金属催化剂中Pt吸附能力的强烈影响可能是由Pb或Sn对Pt的化学修饰引起的协同作用。图2描绘了Pt、Pt-Pb和Pt-Sn催化剂中Pt的活性/克，而图3则展示了脱氢活性与相应催化剂上弱吸附氢量之间的相关性。
