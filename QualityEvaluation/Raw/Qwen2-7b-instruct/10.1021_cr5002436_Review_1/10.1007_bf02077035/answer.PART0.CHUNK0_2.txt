[1] "The activities per g Pt of catalysts with various amounts of Pb or Sn and constant amount of 0.5 wt. % Pt are shown in Fig. 2. With increasing addition of Pb or Sn the rate of dehydrogenation is decreased and the activation energy increases."
[2] "Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb."
[3] "A correlation could be found between the weak adsorption of hydrogen and the activity in dehydrogenation."
[4] "The sites occupied at 573 K by strongly bound hydrogen seem to be inactive in the abstraction of hydrogen from the hydrocarbon and its desorption into the gas phase."

The study focuses on the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on supported Pt-Pb and Pt-Sn catalysts. As the amount of Pb or Sn added increases, the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases, and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases. A correlation exists between the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and the dehydrogenation activity. The sites occupied by strongly bound hydrogen at 573 K appear to be inactive in the abstraction of hydrogen from the hydrocarbon and its desorption into the gas phase.

研究主要关注在支持Pt-Pb和Pt-Sn催化剂上环己烷的脱氢作用。随着添加Pb或Sn量的增加，吸附氢的弱吸附量减少，氧吸附量增加，并且环己烷脱氢活性降低。弱吸附氢的数量与脱氢作用之间存在相关性。573 K时占据的强吸附氢位点似乎对于从烃中提取氢并将其转化为气体相中的活性是不活跃的。
