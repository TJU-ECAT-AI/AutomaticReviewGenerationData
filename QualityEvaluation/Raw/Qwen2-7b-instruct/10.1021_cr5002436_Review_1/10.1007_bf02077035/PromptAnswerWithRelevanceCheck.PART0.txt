[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst."
[2] "With increasing content of the second metal, the amount of hydrogens adsorbed at low temperature (nH2) decreases strongly and the amount adsorbed at high temperature (nH573) increases slightly."
[3] "Only catalysts with nI47 > nr are active in dehydrogenation and therefore only those will be discussed."
[4] "The reason of the strongly influenced adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts should be a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn according to a协同 effect."
[5] "In Pt-Sn alloys a decrease of deuterium adsorption has been found arid is discussed as a ligand effect, too, although an ensemble effect is not excluded."
[6] "An adsorption of oxygen on tin in Pt-Sn/A12 O3 catalysts recently was assumed by Müller et al."
[7] "The activities per g Pt of catalysts with various amounts of Pb or Sn and constant amount of 0.5 wt. % Pt are shown in Fig. 2. With increasing addition of Pb or Sn the rate of dehydrogenation is decreased and the activation energy increases."
[8] "Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb."
[9] "A correlation could be found between the weak adsorption of hydrogen and the activity in dehydrogenation."
[10] "The sites occupied at 573 K by strongly bound hydrogen seem to be inactive in the abstraction of hydrogen from the hydrocarbon and its desorption into the gas phase."

The study focuses on bimetallic Pt-Pb and Pt-Sn catalysts compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The Pt-Pb and Pt-Sn catalysts showed altered adsorption properties and dehydrogenation activities. Specifically, as the amount of the second metal increased, the adsorption of hydrogen at lower temperatures decreased significantly while the adsorption at higher temperatures increased slightly. Catalysts showing high hydrogen adsorption at higher temperatures were considered active in dehydrogenation processes. The authors suggest that the chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn, according to a协同 effect, might explain the changes in adsorption capacity. The study also indicates that small amounts of Sn are more toxic than Pb, affecting the catalyst's performance. A correlation was found between the weak adsorption of hydrogen and the dehydrogenation activity, suggesting that the number of active sites involved in the dehydrogenation process is proportional to the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen. Furthermore, it was observed that the sites occupied by strongly bound hydrogen at 573 K are inactive in the abstraction of hydrogen from hydrocarbons and subsequent desorption into the gas phase.

本研究关注了Pt-Pb和Pt-Sn双金属催化剂与单金属Pt催化剂的比较。Pt-Pb和Pt-Sn催化剂显示出不同的吸附性质和脱氢活性。具体而言，随着第二种金属含量的增加，低温下吸附的氢气量显著减少，而高温下的吸附量略有增加。在高氢吸附温度下表现出高活性的催化剂被认为是具有脱氢能力的。作者提出，根据协同效应，Pt通过Pb或Sn的化学修饰可能解释了吸附能力的变化。研究表明，少量的Sn比Pb更毒，影响催化剂性能。发现弱吸附氢与脱氢活性之间存在相关性，表明参与脱氢过程的活性位点的数量与弱吸附氢的数量成正比。此外，观察到在573 K时占据强烈结合氢的位点在从烃类分子中提取氢原子并将其解吸到气体相中的过程中是不活跃的。

The study examines the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and chemisorption of H2 and O2 on supported Pt-Pb and Pt-Sn catalysts. As the amount of either metal increases, the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases, and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases. A correlation exists between the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and the dehydrogenation activity. The sites occupied by strongly bound hydrogen at 573 K appear to be inactive in the abstraction of hydrogen from the hydrocarbon and its desorption into the gas phase.

The study examines the influence of adding lead (Pb) and tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) catalysts, specifically focusing on their impact on the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the adsorption properties of hydrogen and oxygen. As the amount of Pb or Sn increases, the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases, and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases. A correlation exists between the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and the dehydrogenation activity. The mechanism of poisoning when Sn is added to the Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalyst is still unclear. The Pt dispersity in Pt-Sn catalysts can be determined through the adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen. The study also shows that the addition of Pb or Sn causes a decrease in activity and hydrogen adsorption. The results suggest that the strong influence on the adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts might be due to a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn. The activities per gram of Pt for catalysts with varying amounts of Pb or Sn are depicted in Figure 2, while the correlation between the dehydrogenation activity and the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen is illustrated in Figure 3.

研究探讨了向铂（Pt）催化剂中添加铅（Pb）和锡（Sn）的影响，特别是它们对环己烷脱氢以及氢气和氧气吸附性质的影响。随着Pb或Sn含量的增加，低温度下吸附的氢气量显著减少，高温下吸附的氢气量略有增加。环己烷脱氢活性降低。弱吸附氢的数量与脱氢活性之间存在相关性。当Sn添加到Pt/Al2O3重整催化剂中时，其机制仍不清楚。可以通过氢气和氧气的吸附来确定Pt-Sn催化剂中的Pt分散度。研究还表明，Pb或Sn的添加导致活性和氢气吸附量下降。结果表明，双金属催化剂中Pt吸附能力的强烈影响可能是由Pb或Sn对Pt的化学修饰引起的协同作用。图2描绘了Pt、Pt-Pb和Pt-Sn催化剂中Pt的活性/克，而图3则展示了脱氢活性与相应催化剂上弱吸附氢量之间的相关性。
