[1] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields,and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane,and propene aromatization."
[2] "The ratio of propene aromatisation (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1)."
[3] "Zn cations not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conversion rates."
[4] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromatisation by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts have distinct compositions, varying degrees of effectiveness, diverse industrial applications, recent advancements, and potential benefits in this field.

2. The effectiveness of these catalysts can be compared based on their ability to increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during the conversion of ethane, propane, and propene. For instance, zinc oxide catalysts have been noted to enhance these parameters compared to standard zeolite catalysts like H-ZSM5.

3. Zinc oxide catalysts, in particular, not only facilitate alkane dehydrogenation but also accelerate alkene conversion rates. This is due to their capability to catalyze alkane dehydrogenation and alkene conversion simultaneously.

4. Zinc oxide catalysts increase the rates of alkane aromatisation by boosting the rate of recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms generated in C-H activation steps. This coupling enhances the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

1. 镍、铂等贵金属和铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌、钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢反应中得到应用。这些催化剂具有不同的组成，效用各异，适用于不同工业领域，具备近期进展与潜在优势。

2. 这些催化剂的有效性可通过提高转化率、芳香化位点时间产率以及氢气的排放速率来衡量。例如，锌氧化物催化剂在促进乙烷、丙烷和丙烯的转化方面比传统的沸石催化剂如H-ZSM5更有效。

3. 锌氧化物催化剂不仅催化烷烃脱氢，还能加速烯烃的转化。这归因于它们能够同时催化烷烃脱氢和烯烃转化。

4. 锌氧化物催化剂通过加速C-H键激活过程中产生的氢原子的重组脱附，提高了烷烃芳香化的速率。这种耦合增强了脱氢过程的效率。
