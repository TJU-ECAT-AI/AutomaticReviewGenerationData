[1] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields,and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane,and propene aromatization."
[2] "The ratio of propene aromatization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1)."
[3] "Zn cations not only cata- lyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conver- sion rates."
[4] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromati- zation by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."
[5] "Hydrogen adsorptiondesorption steps, however, remain irreversible (rate-determining) even on Zn/H-ZSM5 cata- lysts."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. 

2. These noble metals enhance the efficiency of the catalytic process, accelerating the rate of reaction and improving the selectivity towards desired products.

3. The metal oxide-based catalysts offer an alternative approach, providing a cost-effective option compared to noble metals, although they may exhibit lower activity and selectivity.

4. Recent developments in this field focus on the optimization of catalyst compositions, including the tuning of metal loading and the design of supports to enhance stability and activity.

5. The potential advantages of these catalysts include improved energy efficiency, reduced environmental impact, and the ability to handle a broader range of feedstocks.
