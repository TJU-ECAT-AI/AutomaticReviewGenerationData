[1] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization."
[2] "Zn cations not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conversion rates."
[3] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromatization by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."
[4] "Hydrogen adsorptiondesorption steps, however, remain irreversible (rate-determining) even on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts."

Noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts are known for their high efficiency and selectivity in olefin dehydrogenation, often leading to the production of aromatic compounds. Metal oxide-based catalysts, particularly those containing zinc, are noted for enhancing the dehydrogenation rates and hydrogen disposal efficiency in the conversion of ethane, propane, and propene. Zinc oxide catalysts facilitate alkane dehydrogenation and alkene conversion, thereby increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms generated during the activation of C-H bonds. However, hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps remain irreversible, even on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, which contrasts with the reversible nature of reactions occurring on noble metal catalysts. These metal oxide catalysts offer cost-effectiveness and potential for industrial application, although their performance might be limited compared to noble metals in terms of selectivity and stability over long periods.

贵金属催化剂，如铂，和金属氧化物催化剂，包括CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中被使用。铂基催化剂在烯烃脱氢方面表现出高效率和选择性，通常导致芳香化合物的生成。金属氧化物催化剂，尤其是含锌的，被注意到可以提高脱氢速率和氢气排放效率，在乙烯、丙烷和丙烯的转化中。锌氧化物催化剂促进了烷烃脱氢和烯烃转化，从而增加了在C-H键活化过程中产生的氢原子的重新组合脱附速率。然而，氢吸附-脱附步骤在Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂上仍然是不可逆的，这与在贵金属催化剂上发生的可逆反应形成对比。这些金属氧化物催化剂提供了成本效益和潜在的工业应用，但它们的性能可能在长期稳定性方面与贵金属相比有限。
