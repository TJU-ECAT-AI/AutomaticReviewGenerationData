<p>The presence of sodium modified the properties of the Pt metal phase. The Pt dispersion, combined with interaction between metal and support, were effected by the sodium content,which may be responsible for catalytic properties.</p>
<p>The sodium existence also neutralized the strong acidic sites of catalysts, thus reduced the formation of coke effectively.</p>
<p>However, the incorporation of excessive sodium prompted the reduction of Sn species to Sn0, which may be alloyed with Pt,leading to a decrease in catalytic activity.</p>

The study discusses the effect of sodium addition to PtSn/AlSBA-15 catalysts on their properties and catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The presence of sodium modifies the acid function of the catalysts and changes the structure of the metallic phase, which reduces the amount of coke deposition. The optimal sodium content of 1.0% leads to the best catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and stability. The high catalytic performance may be due to the strong interaction between metal and support. Sodium addition also reduces the formation of coke by neutralizing strong acidic sites on the catalyst surfaces. However, excessive sodium content leads to the reduction of Sn species to Sn0, which can alloy with Pt, resulting in a decrease in catalytic activity.

研究讨论了向PtSn/AlSBA-15催化剂中添加钠对它们的性质和丙烷裂解性能的影响。钠的存在改变了催化剂的酸性功能和金属相结构，从而减少了焦炭沉积量。1.0%的最佳钠含量导致了最佳的催化性能，包括丙烷转化率和稳定性。高催化性能可能归因于金属与载体之间的强相互作用。钠的添加通过中和催化剂表面的强酸性位点来减少焦炭形成。然而，过高的钠含量会导致Sn物种还原为Sn0，这可能会与Pt合金化，导致催化活性下降。
