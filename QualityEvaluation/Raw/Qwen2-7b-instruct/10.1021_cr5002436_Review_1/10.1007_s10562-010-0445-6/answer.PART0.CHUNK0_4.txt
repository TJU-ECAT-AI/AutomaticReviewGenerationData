<p>The presence of sodium modified the properties of the Pt metal phase. The Pt dispersion, combined with interaction between metal and support, were effected by the sodium content,which may be responsible for catalytic properties.</p>
<p>The sodium existence also neutralized the strong acidic sites of catalysts, thus reduced the formation of coke effectively.</p>
<p>However, the incorporation of excessive sodium prompted the reduction of Sn species to Sn0, which may be alloyed with Pt, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity.</p>

The literature discusses how the addition of sodium to PtSn catalysts, specifically PtSnNa/AlSBA-15, affects their catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation. Sodium modification influences the acid function of the catalysts and the structure of the metallic phase, thereby reducing coke deposition. The optimal amount of sodium leads to high catalytic performance, including high propane conversion and stability. However, too much sodium can cause the reduction of tin species to Sn0, potentially forming a PtSn alloy, which decreases the dispersion of Pt particles and leads to a decline in catalytic activity.

文献讨论了向PtSn催化剂，特别是PtSnNa/AlSBA-15，添加钠如何影响其在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化性质。钠修饰改变了催化剂的酸功能和金属相的结构，从而减少了焦炭沉积。适量的钠可以带来高催化性能，包括高丙烷转化率和稳定性。然而，过多的钠会导致锡物种还原为Sn0，并可能形成PtSn合金，这会降低铂颗粒的分散度并导致催化活性下降。
