The literature does not directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts supported on SBA-15 and AlSBA-15, with the addition of sodium (Na) to modify their properties. The document focuses on the effects of sodium addition on the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic behaviors of the PtSn/AlSBA-15 catalysts, particularly regarding the modification of acid function, structure of the metallic phase, and reduction of coke deposition. It also mentions that the presence of sodium can neutralize strong acidic sites, thereby reducing the formation of coke. The document does not provide information on the effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in comparison to noble metal-based catalysts.

For a comprehensive comparison, one would need access to a broader body of literature covering both types of catalysts and their specific applications in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

文献并未直接比较和对比在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中使用的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂。然而，它确实讨论了在SBA-15和AlSBA-15上负载的铂锡（PtSn）催化剂的使用，其中添加了钠（Na）以修改其性质。文档重点关注钠添加对PtSn/AlSBA-15催化剂的物理化学特性和催化行为的影响，特别是对酸功能的修改、金属相结构的改变以及焦炭沉积的减少。文档还提到，钠的存在可以中和强酸性位点，从而有效减少焦炭的形成。文档没有提供关于这两种类型催化剂的有效性、工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的详细信息。

为了进行全面比较，需要获取涵盖两种类型催化剂及其在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的特定应用的更广泛文献集。
