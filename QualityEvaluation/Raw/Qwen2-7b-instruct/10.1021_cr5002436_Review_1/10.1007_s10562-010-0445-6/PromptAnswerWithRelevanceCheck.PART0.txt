<p>The platinumtin catalysts have been widely used in reforming or dehydrogenation processes. The role of Sn in PtSn catalysts has been extensively investigated in many studies [39]. It has been proposed that tin modifies the electronic density of Pt, either owing to a positive charge transfer from Snn+ or to the different electronic structure in PtSn alloys [10]. Moreover, tin decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, reducing hydrogenolysis and coking reactions which require large Pt ensembles.</p>
<p>The use of SBA-15 is attractive, because it possesses well-ordered pore structure, high thermal stability and high surface area [11]. Recently, SBA-15 as a support has been used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Santhosh Kumar et al. [12, 13] studied the propane dehydrogenation performance of Pt and PtSn catalysts supported SBA-15, and found PtSn/SBA-15 exhibited higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propene and stability than Pt/SBA-15. Fan et al. [14] reported that PtSn catalyst supported on alumina-modified SBA-15 had higher activity than PtSn/SBA-15, which was due to alumina could enhance the interaction between metal and support.</p>
<p>Inhibiting the acid-catalyzed reaction on the support can improve the propane dehydrogenation performance. The acid sites of support containing alumina may be poisoned by adding alkali or alkali earth metal ions [23, 24]. It was reported in the literature [25] that the addition of sodium to PtSn/Al2O3 increased the catalytic performance in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction, which was attributed to a geometric modification of the metallic phase by the presence of sodium. Siri et al. [26] investigated the effect of sodium promoter on catalytic properties of PtSn/γ-Al2O3 in the isobutene dehydrogenation, and found the addition of sodium improved the stability level of the catalysts. This behavior was explained that Na+ could effectively inhibit the activity of support acid sites.</p>
<p>The goal of the present work was to investigate the modified effect of Na addition to PtSn/AlSBA-15 on the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic behaviors in the propane dehydrogenation. The additive effects of Na were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), BET, HR-TEM, hydrogen chemisorption, NH3-TPD, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Their catalytic properties were evaluated in a microreactor.</p>

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It contrasts these with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. The compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field are discussed. The document highlights the role of tin in modifying the electronic density of Platinum and the benefits of using SBA-15 as a support for Platinum and Platinum-tin catalysts. It also mentions the use of alumina to enhance the interaction between metal and support and the impact of alkali or alkali earth metal ions on the acid sites of the support. The addition of sodium to the catalyst system is shown to improve the catalytic performance by modifying the metallic phase and inhibiting the activity of support acid sites. The study aims to investigate the effects of sodium addition on the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic behavior of Platinum-tin catalysts supported on Al-SBA-15 in propane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts supported on SBA-15 and AlSBA-15, with the addition of sodium (Na) to modify their properties. The document focuses on the effects of sodium addition on the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic behaviors of the PtSn/AlSBA-15 catalysts, particularly regarding the modification of acid function, structure of the metallic phase, and reduction of coke deposition. It also mentions that the presence of sodium can neutralize strong acidic sites, thereby reducing the formation of coke. The document does not provide information on the effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in comparison to noble metal-based catalysts.

For a comprehensive comparison, one would need access to a broader body of literature covering both types of catalysts and their specific applications in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

文献并未直接比较和对比在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中使用的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂。然而，它确实讨论了在SBA-15和AlSBA-15上负载的铂锡（PtSn）催化剂的使用，其中添加了钠（Na）以修改其性质。文档重点关注钠添加对PtSn/AlSBA-15催化剂的物理化学特性和催化行为的影响，特别是对酸功能的修改、金属相结构的改变以及焦炭沉积的减少。文档还提到，钠的存在可以中和强酸性位点，从而有效减少焦炭的形成。文档没有提供关于这两种类型催化剂的有效性、工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的详细信息。

为了进行全面比较，需要获取涵盖两种类型催化剂及其在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的特定应用的更广泛文献集。

The study discusses the effect of sodium addition to PtSn/AlSBA-15 catalysts on their properties and catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The presence of sodium modifies the acid function of the catalysts and changes the structure of the metallic phase, which reduces the amount of coke deposition. The optimal sodium content of 1.0% leads to the best catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and stability. The high catalytic performance may be due to the strong interaction between metal and support. Sodium addition also reduces the formation of coke by neutralizing strong acidic sites on the catalyst surfaces. However, excessive sodium content leads to the reduction of Sn species to Sn0, which can alloy with Pt, resulting in a decrease in catalytic activity.

The literature discusses how the addition of sodium to PtSn catalysts, specifically PtSnNa/AlSBA-15, affects their catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation. Sodium modification influences the acid function of the catalysts and the structure of the metallic phase, thereby reducing coke deposition. The optimal amount of sodium leads to high catalytic performance, including high propane conversion and stability. However, too much sodium can cause the reduction of tin species to Sn0, potentially forming a PtSn alloy, which decreases the dispersion of Pt particles and leads to a decline in catalytic activity.
