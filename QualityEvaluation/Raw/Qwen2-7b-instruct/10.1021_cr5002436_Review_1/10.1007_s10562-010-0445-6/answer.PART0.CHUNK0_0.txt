<p>The platinumtin catalysts have been widely used in reforming or dehydrogenation processes. The role of Sn in PtSn catalysts has been extensively investigated in many studies [39]. It has been proposed that tin modifies the electronic density of Pt, either owing to a positive charge transfer from Snn+ or to the different electronic structure in PtSn alloys [10]. Moreover, tin decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, reducing hydrogenolysis and coking reactions which require large Pt ensembles.</p>
<p>The use of SBA-15 is attractive, because it possesses well-ordered pore structure, high thermal stability and high surface area [11]. Recently, SBA-15 as a support has been used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Santhosh Kumar et al. [12, 13] studied the propane dehydrogenation performance of Pt and PtSn catalysts supported SBA-15, and found PtSn/SBA-15 exhibited higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propene and stability than Pt/SBA-15. Fan et al. [14] reported that PtSn catalyst supported on alumina-modified SBA-15 had higher activity than PtSn/SBA-15, which was due to alumina could enhance the interaction between metal and support.</p>
<p>Inhibiting the acid-catalyzed reaction on the support can improve the propane dehydrogenation performance. The acid sites of support containing alumina may be poisoned by adding alkali or alkali earth metal ions [23, 24]. It was reported in the literature [25] that the addition of sodium to PtSn/Al2O3 increased the catalytic performance in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction, which was attributed to a geometric modification of the metallic phase by the presence of sodium. Siri et al. [26] investigated the effect of sodium promoter on catalytic properties of PtSn/γ-Al2O3 in the isobutene dehydrogenation, and found the addition of sodium improved the stability level of the catalysts. This behavior was explained that Na+ could effectively inhibit the activity of support acid sites.</p>
<p>The goal of the present work was to investigate the modified effect of Na addition to PtSn/AlSBA-15 on the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic behaviors in the propane dehydrogenation. The additive effects of Na were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), BET, HR-TEM, hydrogen chemisorption, NH3-TPD, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Their catalytic properties were evaluated in a microreactor.</p>

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It contrasts these with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. The compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field are discussed. The document highlights the role of tin in modifying the electronic density of Platinum and the benefits of using SBA-15 as a support for Platinum and Platinum-tin catalysts. It also mentions the use of alumina to enhance the interaction between metal and support and the impact of alkali or alkali earth metal ions on the acid sites of the support. The addition of sodium to the catalyst system is shown to improve the catalytic performance by modifying the metallic phase and inhibiting the activity of support acid sites. The study aims to investigate the effects of sodium addition on the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic behavior of Platinum-tin catalysts supported on Al-SBA-15 in propane dehydrogenation.
