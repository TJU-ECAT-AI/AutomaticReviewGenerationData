[1] "Most of the light molecular weight olefins are mainly produced by thermal and catalytic cracking processes but also from catalytic dehydrogenation."
[2] "The addition of tin has an important effect on the selectivity toward the dehydrogenation reaction, at the expense of hydrogenolysis reactions, by decreasing the size of platinum ensembles needed."
[3] "Improving selectivity also requires inhibiting the acid-catalyzed reactions on the support (isomerization, polymerization). The acid sites of the alumina support may be poisoned by adding alkaline metal ions."
[4] "The addition of tin improves the selectivity toward isobutene, whatever the preparation procedure employed."
[5] "Finally, the presence of both tin (added via SOMC/M) and lithium in the PtSn OM LiA sample resulted in a catalyst having high activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, with an almost complete inhibition of undesired reactions (cracking and isomerization)."

The document compares noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It discusses their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field. 

Noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, are effective in enhancing the selectivity towards desired reactions. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized for their acidic properties, which facilitate dehydrogenation processes. Recent developments involve the incorporation of additives like tin and lithium to enhance catalyst performance, stability, and selectivity. These additives can inhibit unwanted reactions, improve activity, and reduce deactivation, leading to high efficiency in converting light olefins to valuable products.

Advantages of these catalysts include improved selectivity, enhanced stability, and reduced side reactions, which contribute to their industrial applications in petrochemical processing. The document highlights the synergistic effects of combining multiple additives to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The use of advanced preparation techniques, such as surface organometallic chemistry on metals (SOMC/M), allows for the creation of well-defined bimetallic catalysts with superior properties.

The document concludes that the combination of tin and lithium with Platinum catalysts, prepared through SOMC/M, results in highly active and stable catalysts for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, with minimal undesired cracking and isomerization reactions.
