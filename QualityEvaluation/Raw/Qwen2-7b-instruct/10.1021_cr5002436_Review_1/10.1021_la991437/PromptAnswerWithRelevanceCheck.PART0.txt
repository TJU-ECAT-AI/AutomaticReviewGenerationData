The research focuses on comparing the surface properties of different Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts modified by tin and/or lithium. The study involves X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy, BET, and 2-propanol transformation. The results are correlated with the behavior of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The goal is to obtain well-defined bimetallic surfaces through surface organometallic chemistry on metals techniques and compare the nature of the active sites obtained with those prepared by conventional methods. The study reveals that tin is present in both zeroth valent and oxidized states. The addition of both tin and lithium significantly influences the characteristics of the catalyst surfaces. The order in which lithium is added generates catalysts with different properties in terms of texture, dispersion, and catalytic behavior for both Pt and PtSn systems. The research highlights the importance of tin in improving the selectivity towards the dehydrogenation reaction and enhancing catalyst stability. The addition of lithium modifies the dispersion and electronic properties of the catalysts, affecting their activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The combination of tin and lithium in the PtSn OM LiA catalyst provides high activity and stability, with almost complete inhibition of undesired reactions.

The document compares noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It discusses their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field. 

Noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, are effective in enhancing the selectivity towards desired reactions. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized for their acidic properties, which facilitate dehydrogenation processes. Recent developments involve the incorporation of additives like tin and lithium to enhance catalyst performance, stability, and selectivity. These additives can inhibit unwanted reactions, improve activity, and reduce deactivation, leading to high efficiency in converting light olefins to valuable products.

Advantages of these catalysts include improved selectivity, enhanced stability, and reduced side reactions, which contribute to their industrial applications in petrochemical processing. The document highlights the synergistic effects of combining multiple additives to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The use of advanced preparation techniques, such as surface organometallic chemistry on metals (SOMC/M), allows for the creation of well-defined bimetallic catalysts with superior properties.

The document concludes that the combination of tin and lithium with Platinum catalysts, prepared through SOMC/M, results in highly active and stable catalysts for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, with minimal undesired cracking and isomerization reactions.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find that Platinum catalysts, especially those enhanced with tin and lithium through surface organometallic chemistry on metals techniques (SOMC/M), exhibit improved selectivity towards dehydrogenation reactions. These Platinum-based catalysts, when modified with tin, show better stability and activity, with the addition of lithium further enhancing their selectivity and stability. The metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are primarily used in processes requiring oxidative conditions, whereas Platinum catalysts are preferred for nonoxidative dehydrogenation due to their high activity and selectivity. Recent developments focus on optimizing the preparation methods, including the use of SOMC/M, to achieve enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. The potential advantage of these catalysts lies in their ability to efficiently convert light olefins to valuable products with minimal side reactions, making them highly sought after in the petrochemical industry.
