<p>Most of the light molecular weight olefins are mainly produced by thermal and catalytic cracking processes but also from catalytic dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The addition of tin has an important effect on the selectivity toward the dehydrogenation reaction, at the expense of hydrogenolysis reactions, by decreasing the size of platinum ensembles needed.</p>
<p>Improving selectivity also requires inhibiting the acid-catalyzed reactions on the support (isomerization, polymerization).</p>
<p>The aim of this work is to correlate X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) information from different Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, modified by the addition of tin and/or lithium, with their behavior in the dehydrogenation of isobutane.</p>
<p>In one case (LiB catalysts) γ-Al2O3 was impregnated with an aqueous solution of LiOH, then after drying and calcination, the metallic precursors were added.</p>
<p>When tin is added on Pt catalysts, a large decrease in chemisorption capacity is observed.</p>
<p>For the LiB samples, in which lithium is added before the incorporation of the metallic precursors, the total quantity of chemisorbed hydrogen strongly decreased.</p>
<p>The changes in support acidity due to the addition of lithium were evident when the activity for 2-propanol dehydration was evaluated.</p>
<p>The addition of tin causes a decrease in the BE of the Pt 4d5/2, which is more noticeable in those catalysts prepared via SOMC/M.</p>
<p>Whatever the preparation procedure employed (SI or OM), the addition of tin produces a catalytic material having an important selectivity toward isobutene.</p>
<p>On the monometallic platinum catalysts, XPS results indicate that when lithium is added after the metallic precursor (PtLiA catalyst), a system having an important dispersion is obtained.</p>
<p>The addition of tin improves the selectivity toward isobutene, whatever the preparation procedure employed.</p>
<p>Finally, the presence of both tin (added via SOMC/M) and lithium in the PtSn OM LiA sample resulted in a catalyst having high activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, with an almost complete inhibition of undesired reactions (cracking and isomerization).</p>

The document discusses noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The study focuses on Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts modified by the addition of tin and/or lithium. The text compares the effects of lithium and tin on the selectivity, dispersion, and activity of the catalysts. It highlights the importance of controlling the addition sequence of lithium to achieve different properties in the catalysts. The document also mentions the correlation between X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and the behavior of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. Furthermore, it discusses the improvement in stability and selectivity achieved through the use of tin and lithium, particularly in the SOMC/M preparation method. The study concludes with the development of a catalyst that combines both tin and lithium to achieve high activity and stability in the dehydrogenation process.
