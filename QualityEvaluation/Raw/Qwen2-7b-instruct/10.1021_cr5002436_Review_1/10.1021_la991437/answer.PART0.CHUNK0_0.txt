<p>The addition of tin has an important effect on the selectivity toward the dehydrogenation reaction, at the expense of hydrogenolysis reactions, by decreasing the size of platinum ensembles needed.</p>
<p>The addition of tin has also been suggested to improve the stability of the catalytic systems by decreasing the adsorption energy of coke precursors, increasing their mobility so that they can migrate easily to the support.</p>
<p>The addition of tin causes a decrease in the BE of the Pt 4d5/2, which is more noticeable in those catalysts prepared via SOMC/M.</p>
<p>Whatever the preparation procedure employed (SI or OM), the addition of tin produces a catalytic material having an important selectivity toward isobutene.</p>
<p>The presence of both tin (added via SOMC/M) and lithium in the PtSn OM LiA sample resulted in a catalyst having high activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, with an almost complete inhibition of undesired reactions (cracking and isomerization).</p>

The research focuses on comparing the surface properties of different Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts modified by tin and/or lithium. The study involves X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy, BET, and 2-propanol transformation. The results are correlated with the behavior of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The goal is to obtain well-defined bimetallic surfaces through surface organometallic chemistry on metals techniques and compare the nature of the active sites obtained with those prepared by conventional methods. The study reveals that tin is present in both zeroth valent and oxidized states. The addition of both tin and lithium significantly influences the characteristics of the catalyst surfaces. The order in which lithium is added generates catalysts with different properties in terms of texture, dispersion, and catalytic behavior for both Pt and PtSn systems. The research highlights the importance of tin in improving the selectivity towards the dehydrogenation reaction and enhancing catalyst stability. The addition of lithium modifies the dispersion and electronic properties of the catalysts, affecting their activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The combination of tin and lithium in the PtSn OM LiA catalyst provides high activity and stability, with almost complete inhibition of undesired reactions.
