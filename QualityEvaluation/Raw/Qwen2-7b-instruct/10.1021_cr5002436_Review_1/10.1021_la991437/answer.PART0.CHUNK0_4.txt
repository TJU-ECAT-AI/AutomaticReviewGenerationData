[1] "Most of the light molecular weight olefins are mainly produced by thermal and catalytic cracking processes but also from catalytic dehydrogenation."
[2] "The addition of tin has an important effect on the selectivity toward the dehydrogenation reaction, at the expense of hydrogenolysis reactions, by decreasing the size of platinum ensembles needed."
[3] "Improving selectivity also requires inhibiting the acid-catalyzed reactions on the support (isomerization, polymerization)."
[4] "Obviously, a need for selectivity and stability improvement exists."
[5] "When tin is selectively deposited on platinum (via SOMC/M), the resulting material exhibits zeroth valent and oxidized states of tin."
[6] "This interaction leads to bimetallic catalysts (PtSn OM) having better properties (selectivity to isobutene and stability) than the conventional ones."
[7] "Finally, the presence of both tin (added via SOMC/M) and lithium in the PtSn OM LiA sample resulted in a catalyst having high activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, with an almost complete inhibition of undesired reactions (cracking and isomerization)."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find that Platinum catalysts, especially those enhanced with tin and lithium through surface organometallic chemistry on metals techniques (SOMC/M), exhibit improved selectivity towards dehydrogenation reactions. These Platinum-based catalysts, when modified with tin, show better stability and activity, with the addition of lithium further enhancing their selectivity and stability. The metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are primarily used in processes requiring oxidative conditions, whereas Platinum catalysts are preferred for nonoxidative dehydrogenation due to their high activity and selectivity. Recent developments focus on optimizing the preparation methods, including the use of SOMC/M, to achieve enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. The potential advantage of these catalysts lies in their ability to efficiently convert light olefins to valuable products with minimal side reactions, making them highly sought after in the petrochemical industry.

比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，以及铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。我们发现，通过表面金属化学方法（SOMC/M）改性的铂基催化剂，尤其是添加锡和锂的铂催化剂，在脱氢反应的选择性方面表现出改进。当用锡修饰铂时，这种铂基催化剂显示出更好的稳定性和活性，而添加锂进一步提高了其选择性和稳定性。相比之下，金属氧化物催化剂主要应用于需要氧化条件的过程，而铂催化剂因其高活性和选择性而在非氧化脱氢过程中更受欢迎。最近的研究重点是优化制备方法，包括使用SOMC/M，以实现增强的活性、选择性和稳定性。这些催化剂的优势在于能够高效地将轻烯烃转化为有价值的产物，同时尽量减少副反应，使其在石油化工行业备受关注。
