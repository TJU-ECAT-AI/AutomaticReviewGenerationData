[1] "Most of the light molecular weight olefins are mainly produced by thermal and catalytic cracking processes but also from catalytic dehydrogenation."
[2] "The addition of tin has an important effect on the selectivity toward the dehydrogenation reaction, at the expense of hydrogenolysis reactions, by decreasing the size of platinum ensembles needed."
[3] "Improving selectivity also requires inhibiting the acid-catalyzed reactions on the support (isomerization, polymerization)."
[4] "The aim of this work is to correlate X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) information from different Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, modified by the addition of tin and/or lithium, with their behavior in the dehydrogenation of isobutane."
[5] "When tin is added on Pt catalysts, a large decrease in chemisorption capacity is observed, as has been previously published."
[6] "For the LiB samples, in which lithium is added before the incorporation of the metallic precursors, the total quantity of chemisorbed hydrogen strongly decreased, both for the monometallic as well as for the bimetallic catalysts."
[7] "The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of γ-Al2O3 and Li-doped γ-Al2O3 are presented in Figure 2."
[8] "The Pt signal of PtLiB sample is quite more intense than that of the PtLiA catalyst, giving (Pt/Al)XPS ratios of 0.94 and 0.22, respectively."
[9] "Although the complexity of these catalytic systems does not allow the extraction of many conclusions, it is observed that for Li-modified catalysts, the BE of Pt 4d5/2 is shifted from the value corresponding to Pt/γ-Al2O3, indicating a modification of the electronic density on platinum atoms."
[10] "Whatever the preparation procedure employed (SI or OM), the addition of tin produces a catalytic material having an important selectivity toward isobutene."

The literature focuses on comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It discusses the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field. The study specifically examines the impact of tin and lithium additions on the properties of platinum/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation. The research employs various analytical techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and hydrogen chemisorption to correlate the catalyst's surface characteristics with their catalytic behavior. Tin addition affects the selectivity towards dehydrogenation, while lithium influences the dispersion and acidity of the support. Metal-metal interactions, facilitated by surface organometallic chemistry, enhance the catalyst's stability and selectivity. The literature highlights the importance of balancing the use of tin and lithium for achieving high activity, selectivity, and stability in the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene.
