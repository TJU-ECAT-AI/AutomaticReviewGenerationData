Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, the former are predominantly used in industries for hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and aromatization reactions. Platinum, as a noble metal, interacts with partially reduced metal oxides, leading to phenomena such as the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), where the adsorption capacity and the morphology and electronic properties of the metal surface are modified. Infrared spectroscopy provides insights into the size and morphology of metal particles, which is crucial for understanding the catalytic behavior. The current study represents a pioneering effort in combining infrared spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry to analyze the SMSI effect on a Platinum/Titanium Oxide catalyst. The heats of adsorption for carbon monoxide vary across different coverage regions, revealing the distinct modes of adsorption on terrace sites and bridge bonds, influenced by the reduction temperature of the catalyst. The presence of titanium suboxides on the platinum surface at higher reduction temperatures affects the adsorption characteristics, demonstrating the complex interplay between noble metals and metal oxides in catalytic processes.
