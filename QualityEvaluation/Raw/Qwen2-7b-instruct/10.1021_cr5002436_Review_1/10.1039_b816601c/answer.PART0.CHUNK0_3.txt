Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins requires an examination of their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages.

Noble metal-based catalysts, including platinum, are widely utilized for various reactions like hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and aromatization due to their high reactivity and selectivity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, often offer a more affordable alternative. They are known for their stability and resistance to poisoning by certain impurities.

Recent developments in this field have focused on improving the efficiency and selectivity of catalysts, reducing production costs, and enhancing environmental compatibility. Industrial applications of these catalysts are widespread across sectors such as petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and fine chemicals.

Advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include high activity, selectivity, and stability, especially for reactions involving carbon-carbon bonds. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are known for their robustness and cost-effectiveness, making them suitable for large-scale industrial processes.

The specific compositions and effectiveness of these catalysts depend on factors such as the type of metal, the presence of promoters, and the support material. The study of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect on a Pt/TiO2 catalyst highlights the importance of the support in modifying the catalytic behavior of noble metals.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the Pt/TiO2 catalyst reveals details about the chemical state of platinum and the oxygen chemistry on the surface. FTIR spectroscopy provides insights into the adsorption modes of CO molecules on the catalyst surface, while adsorption microcalorimetry measures the heat of adsorption, which is crucial for understanding the energetics of the reaction.

In conclusion, while noble metal-based catalysts like platinum offer superior catalytic properties, metal oxide-based catalysts provide economic benefits and robustness. Recent research focuses on optimizing these catalysts for enhanced performance and environmental sustainability in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

The combined analysis of infrared spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry in this study offers valuable insights into the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect on a Pt/TiO2 catalyst. It demonstrates the distinct characteristics of CO adsorption on the catalyst surface at different reduction temperatures, highlighting the importance of the support in modifying the catalytic behavior of noble metals.
