Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (such as Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, these catalysts differ significantly in terms of their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages.

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are known for their widespread use in various chemical and petrochemical processes including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and aromatization reactions. Their catalytic behavior is influenced by multiple factors, with the support material playing a crucial role in modifying their activity.

Metal oxide-based catalysts, exemplified by CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer alternative functionalities and properties. For instance, TiO2 has been shown to promote the activity of metals from groups 8, 9, and 10 through a phenomenon called strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), especially when reduced at high temperatures (around 773 K). This interaction can lead to changes in the adsorption ability of these metals, impacting their catalytic efficiency in various reactions.

Recent developments in this field aim to enhance the performance and selectivity of these catalysts, often focusing on understanding and optimizing the interaction between the noble metals and the metal oxides. For example, the combined use of in situ infrared spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry to study the SMSI effect on a Pt/TiO2 catalyst provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying these interactions.

In terms of industrial applications, both types of catalysts are crucial in refining processes, petrochemical manufacturing, and the production of various chemical products. Noble metal catalysts are typically more expensive but offer superior stability and selectivity, while metal oxides can provide cost-effective alternatives with specific reactivity profiles tailored to certain reaction conditions.

Advantages of these catalysts include their ability to handle high-temperature and high-pressure environments, resistance to poisoning by certain impurities, and potential for recycling. Ongoing research seeks to refine their composition, enhance their activity, and extend their operational life, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

The document does not directly compare the compositions, effectiveness, or industrial applications of these catalyst types but highlights the use of Platinum and metal oxides, particularly TiO2, in the context of dehydrogenation reactions and the impact of strong metal-support interaction on catalytic behavior.

比较用于非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的贵金属催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（例如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物），这些催化剂在组成、效率、工业应用、最新进展和潜在优势方面存在显著差异。

贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，因其广泛应用于氢化、脱氢、异构化、氢解和芳构化反应而在化学和石油化学领域被大量使用。它们的催化行为受到多种因素的影响，支持材料在调节活性方面起着关键作用。

金属氧化物催化剂，以CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物为代表，提供了不同的功能性和特性。例如，TiO2已被证明能促进第8、9、10组金属的活性，尤其是在773 K左右高温还原时，通过所谓的强金属-支持相互作用（SMSI）。这种相互作用可以改变这些金属的吸附能力，从而影响各种反应的催化效率。

该领域的近期发展旨在增强这些催化剂的性能和选择性，通常侧重于理解和优化贵金属与金属氧化物之间的相互作用。例如，对Pt/TiO2催化剂进行原位红外光谱和吸附微热分析相结合的方法研究SMSI效应，为理解这些相互作用机制提供了有价值的见解。

从工业应用的角度来看，这两种类型的催化剂在精炼过程、石油化学制造和各种化学产品的生产中至关重要。贵金属催化剂通常成本更高但提供更稳定和选择性的性能，而金属氧化物则提供成本效益更高的替代品，具有针对特定反应条件定制的特异性活性。

这些催化剂的优势包括能够在高温高压环境中工作、抵抗某些杂质的中毒，并有可能循环利用。正在进行的研究寻求改进其组成、增强活性并延长使用寿命，旨在提高效率并减少环境影响。

文档并未直接比较这些催化剂类型在组成、效率或工业应用方面的差异，而是强调了铂和金属氧化物（特别是TiO2）在脱氢反应中的使用及其对催化行为的影响。

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, the former are predominantly used in industries for hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and aromatization reactions. Platinum, as a noble metal, interacts with partially reduced metal oxides, leading to phenomena such as the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), where the adsorption capacity and the morphology and electronic properties of the metal surface are modified. Infrared spectroscopy provides insights into the size and morphology of metal particles, which is crucial for understanding the catalytic behavior. The current study represents a pioneering effort in combining infrared spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry to analyze the SMSI effect on a Platinum/Titanium Oxide catalyst. The heats of adsorption for carbon monoxide vary across different coverage regions, revealing the distinct modes of adsorption on terrace sites and bridge bonds, influenced by the reduction temperature of the catalyst. The presence of titanium suboxides on the platinum surface at higher reduction temperatures affects the adsorption characteristics, demonstrating the complex interplay between noble metals and metal oxides in catalytic processes.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, both types play significant roles in various industrial processes. Platinum is noted for its wide use across hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and aromatization reactions. It has been observed that certain supports can modify the catalytic behavior of active phases, as found by Schawb and Schultes. The concept of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), introduced by Tauster et al., describes the modification of metal adsorption abilities on partially reducible oxides like TiO2 after high-temperature reduction, typically around 773 K. This phenomenon is explained through two mechanisms: the coverage of metal surfaces by partially reduced support patches and charge transfer between the partially reduced support and the metal. Infrared spectroscopy and CO adsorption microcalorimetry are powerful tools for understanding metal particle size, morphology, and the interaction between active sites and probe molecules. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to evaluate the chemical composition of the catalyst surface. Platinum's metallic state, as indicated by binding energies at 71.2 and 70.8 eV for reductions at 473 and 773 K respectively, was determined. The surface Pt/Ti atomic ratio, a measure of platinum dispersion on the titania support, decreased with increased reduction temperature, suggesting a loss of surface platinum without evidence of sintering. Oxygen species were identified in the XPS spectra, with surface hydroxyl groups and lattice oxygen in the support contributing to the observed peaks. CO adsorption on Platinum/Titania catalysts revealed distinct regions based on coverage, indicating different adsorption modes. After reduction at 773 K, the interaction between platinum particles and partially reduced titania support led to a decrease in the heat of adsorption, suggesting a strong interaction that affects the catalyst's performance.

比较铂等贵金属催化剂与CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中的应用，这两种类型的催化剂在各种工业过程中都扮演着重要角色。铂因其广泛应用于氢化、脱氢、异构化、氢解和芳构化反应而被大量使用。已发现某些支持物能够改变活性相的催化行为，这是由Schawb和Schultes发现的。Tauster等人引入了强金属-支持相互作用（SMSI）的概念，用于描述在约773 K的高温下对部分可还原氧化物（如TiO2）上的金属进行高温度还原时，金属吸附能力的修改。这一现象通过两种机制来解释：金属表面被部分还原支持物斑块覆盖，以及部分还原支持物和金属之间的电荷转移。红外光谱学和CO吸附微热流计是了解金属颗粒大小、形态以及活性位点与探针分子之间交互的重要工具。X射线光电子能谱（XPS）用于评估催化剂表面的化学组成。铂的金属状态，通过在473 K和773 K分别进行原位氢化后测量的Pt 4f7/2能级的结合能量为71.2和70.8 eV来确定。表面Pt/Ti原子比作为铂在钛酸盐支持物上分散的度量，在提高还原温度时减少，表明表面铂的损失，同时没有证据表明发生烧结。在XPS光谱中，识别出表面羟基组分和支持体中的晶格氧。根据覆盖度的不同，铂/钛酸盐催化剂上的CO吸附揭示了不同的区域，指示了不同的吸附模式。在773 K下进行还原后，铂粒子与部分还原钛酸盐支持物之间的强相互作用导致了吸附热的降低，这表明催化剂性能的变化。
