Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, both types play significant roles in various industrial processes. Platinum is noted for its wide use across hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and aromatization reactions. It has been observed that certain supports can modify the catalytic behavior of active phases, as found by Schawb and Schultes. The concept of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), introduced by Tauster et al., describes the modification of metal adsorption abilities on partially reducible oxides like TiO2 after high-temperature reduction, typically around 773 K. This phenomenon is explained through two mechanisms: the coverage of metal surfaces by partially reduced support patches and charge transfer between the partially reduced support and the metal. Infrared spectroscopy and CO adsorption microcalorimetry are powerful tools for understanding metal particle size, morphology, and the interaction between active sites and probe molecules. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to evaluate the chemical composition of the catalyst surface. Platinum's metallic state, as indicated by binding energies at 71.2 and 70.8 eV for reductions at 473 and 773 K respectively, was determined. The surface Pt/Ti atomic ratio, a measure of platinum dispersion on the titania support, decreased with increased reduction temperature, suggesting a loss of surface platinum without evidence of sintering. Oxygen species were identified in the XPS spectra, with surface hydroxyl groups and lattice oxygen in the support contributing to the observed peaks. CO adsorption on Platinum/Titania catalysts revealed distinct regions based on coverage, indicating different adsorption modes. After reduction at 773 K, the interaction between platinum particles and partially reduced titania support led to a decrease in the heat of adsorption, suggesting a strong interaction that affects the catalyst's performance.

比较铂等贵金属催化剂与CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中的应用，这两种类型的催化剂在各种工业过程中都扮演着重要角色。铂因其广泛应用于氢化、脱氢、异构化、氢解和芳构化反应而被大量使用。已发现某些支持物能够改变活性相的催化行为，这是由Schawb和Schultes发现的。Tauster等人引入了强金属-支持相互作用（SMSI）的概念，用于描述在约773 K的高温下对部分可还原氧化物（如TiO2）上的金属进行高温度还原时，金属吸附能力的修改。这一现象通过两种机制来解释：金属表面被部分还原支持物斑块覆盖，以及部分还原支持物和金属之间的电荷转移。红外光谱学和CO吸附微热流计是了解金属颗粒大小、形态以及活性位点与探针分子之间交互的重要工具。X射线光电子能谱（XPS）用于评估催化剂表面的化学组成。铂的金属状态，通过在473 K和773 K分别进行原位氢化后测量的Pt 4f7/2能级的结合能量为71.2和70.8 eV来确定。表面Pt/Ti原子比作为铂在钛酸盐支持物上分散的度量，在提高还原温度时减少，表明表面铂的损失，同时没有证据表明发生烧结。在XPS光谱中，识别出表面羟基组分和支持体中的晶格氧。根据覆盖度的不同，铂/钛酸盐催化剂上的CO吸附揭示了不同的区域，指示了不同的吸附模式。在773 K下进行还原后，铂粒子与部分还原钛酸盐支持物之间的强相互作用导致了吸附热的降低，这表明催化剂性能的变化。
