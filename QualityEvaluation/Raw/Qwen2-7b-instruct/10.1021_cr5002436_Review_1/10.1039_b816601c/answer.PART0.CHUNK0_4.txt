The literature focuses on the use of a Pt/TiO2 catalyst in the chemical and petrochemical industry for various reactions. It discusses the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) phenomenon, particularly in the context of Pt/TiO2 systems. The study employs advanced techniques such as in situ infrared spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry to analyze the catalyst's behavior. The chemical composition of the catalyst surface is assessed through XPS. It highlights the importance of SMSI in modifying the catalyst's activity and morphology, leading to changes in its adsorption properties.
