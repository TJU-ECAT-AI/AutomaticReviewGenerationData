[1] "Although often referred to in the literature (and here) as SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis),the use o f
isotopic tracing only requires for interpretation purposes that reaction not be changing significantly during the isotopic transient period."
[2] "TOFITK ( l / z  ) and TOFchem for several structure-sensitive and structure-insensitive reactions (ethane hydrogenolysis, ammonia synthesis, methanol synthesis, and methana- tion) on metal catalysts are compared."

1. The use of isotopic tracing for SSITKA analysis assumes that the reaction does not significantly change during the isotopic transient period.
2. The turnover frequencies for several reactions, including ethane hydrogenolysis, ammonia synthesis, methanol synthesis, and methanation, are compared on metal catalysts.
3. For the methanation reaction, TOFITK has the least dependence on CO partial pressure among the turnover frequencies.
4. All turnover frequencies, including TOFsite, exhibit some dependence on reactant concentrations.
5. The hierarchy of turnover frequencies is TOFchem < TOFsite < TOFITK.
6. When interpreting the rate at the site level, the use of TOFITK is preferred.

1. 在进行SSITKA分析时，使用同位素追踪假设反应在同位素瞬态期间不会显著变化。
2. 对几种反应（包括乙烷氢解、氨合成、甲醇合成和甲烷化）在金属催化剂上的转速频率进行了比较。
3. 对于甲烷化反应，TOFITK对CO分压的依赖性最小。
4. 所有转速频率，包括TOFsite，都表现出对反应物浓度的一些依赖性。
5. 转速频率的等级为TOFchem < TOFsite < TOFITK。
6. 当需要在站点级别解释速率时，应优先使用TOFITK。
