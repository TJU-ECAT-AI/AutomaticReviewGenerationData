[1] "Although often referred to in the literature (and here) as SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis),the use o f
isotopic tracing only requires for interpretation purposes that reaction not be changing significantly during the isotopic transient period."

1. TOFITK, the turnover frequency based on the concentration of active intermediates, requires isotopic tracing only when the reaction doesn't significantly change during the isotopic transient period.
2. TOF values for various reactions like ethane hydrogenolysis, ammonia synthesis, methanol synthesis, and methanation on metal catalysts are compared.
3. Determining the actual number of active surface sites addresses the major shortcoming in the TOF measure.
4. For La3+-promoted Co/Si02 catalysts, the TOFITK (l/zM) was significantly higher than the TOFchem (from hydrogen chemisorption), with the TOF ratio ranging from 294-744 at 260C.
5. TOFITK will be larger than TOFchem unless the concentration of carbon-containing intermediates equals the concentration of sites, reflecting the nature of active sites.

1.TOFITK，基于活性中间体浓度的周转频率，仅在同位素瞬态期间反应没有显著变化时才需要同位素追踪。
2. 对于各种反应，如乙烷氢解、氨合成、甲醇合成和甲烷化在金属催化剂上的TOF值进行了比较。
3. 确定实际的活性表面位点数量可以解决TOF测量的主要问题。
4. 在260C下，对于La3+-促进的Co/Si02催化剂，TOFITK（l/zM）明显高于氢化学吸附的TOFchem，TOF比从294-744不等。
5. 除非碳含有的中间体浓度等于位点浓度，否则TOFITK将大于TOFchem，反映了活性位点的性质。
