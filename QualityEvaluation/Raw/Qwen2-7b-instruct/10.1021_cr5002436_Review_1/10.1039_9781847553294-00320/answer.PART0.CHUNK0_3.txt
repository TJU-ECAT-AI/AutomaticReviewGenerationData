8 Turnover Frequencies in Metal Catalysis: Meanings, Functionalities and Relationships BY JAMES G. GOODWIN, JR., SO0 KIM AND WILLIAM D. RHODES 1 Introduction It would be highly desirable to be able to determine the intrinsic site activity of a catalyst in order to evaluate its site efficiency relative to other catalysts active for a reaction of interest - unbiased by the amount of catalyst used, by the concen- tration of active sites per weight or volume of catalyst, or even, in the ideal, by the concentration of reactants or products. This intrinsic activity would thus reflect the catalytic essence of the reaction site. Use of such a site activity would permit discrimination between a poor catalyst candidate and an excellent one for further study that, for whatever reason, might have only a few super active sites.

The intrinsic site activity of a catalyst is essential for evaluating its efficiency without being influenced by factors like catalyst amount, active site concentration, or reactant or product concentrations. This allows for the differentiation between suboptimal and superior catalyst candidates for further investigation, even if the catalyst has only a few exceptionally active sites.

催化剂的内在活性对于在不受催化剂量、活性位点浓度或反应物或产物浓度影响的情况下评估其效率至关重要。这使得能够在考虑催化剂只有少数活性极高的位点的情况下，区分出次优和优秀的催化剂候选者进行进一步研究。

2 Determination of TOF Based on Chemisorption TOF for heterogeneous metal catalysts has been traditionally based on chemisorption due to the ability of this technique to easily and often precisely count the number of surface metal atoms on many metal catalysts [
13. Hydrogen
and CO chemisorption have especially been used successfully to determine the number of accessible surface metal atoms. Even from the beginning, TOFchem was realized to be more a measure of specific rate rather than a true site activity [l]. Gates [6] has noted that the TOF based on chemisorption (TOFchem) does not accurately represent a true site activity since the catalytically active surface sites and the surface sites measured by chemisorption may not be the same.

Traditionally, turnover frequency (TOF) for heterogeneous metal catalysts has relied on chemisorption because it enables the easy and often precise enumeration of surface metal atoms on many metal catalysts. Techniques like hydrogen and CO chemisorption have been particularly successful in determining the number of accessible surface metal atoms. Even from the outset, TOFchem was recognized as more indicative of a specific rate rather than a genuine site activity. Gates [6] has pointed out that the TOF derived from chemisorption (TOFchem) does not accurately depict a true site activity, as the catalytically active surface sites and those measured by chemisorption might not align.

对于异质金属催化剂而言，传统上基于化学吸附确定TOF，因为该技术能够轻松且经常精确地计算许多金属催化剂上的表面金属原子数量。特别是氢气和一氧化碳的化学吸附在确定可访问的表面金属原子数量方面取得了特别的成功。从一开始，TOFchem就被认为更多地反映了特定速率而不是真正的位点活性。Gates [6] 指出，基于化学吸附获得的TOF（TOFchem）并不能准确代表真实的位点活性，因为催化活性表面位点与通过化学吸附测量的表面位点可能并不相同。

Step (d),or perhaps (e), appears to be the rate-limiting step for methanation on Co, Ru, Ni, and Pt. Based on rate-limiting step (RLS) (d), the rate of reaction can be written in terms of surface concentrations as:rate of reaction = rate (RLS) = k [*HI [*CH,]

Step (d), or perhaps (e), seems to be the rate-limiting step for methanation on cobalt, ruthenium, nickel, and platinum. According to the rate-limiting step (RLS) (d), the reaction rate can be expressed in terms of surface concentrations as: reaction rate = rate (RLS) = k [*HI [*CHx]
where [SH] represents the number of surface sites derived from chemisorption. Thus, TOFchem is a function of [SH], [*HI, and [*CHx], as well as temperature and the nature of the active sites.

The rate of reaction is given by: rate of reaction = k [*HI [*CHx] / [S,] where [S,] is the number of surface sites obtained from chemisorption. Consequently, TOFchem is a function of [SH], [*HI, and [*CHx], along with temperature and the characteristics of the active sites. [*HI and [*CHx] are influenced by the partial pressures of the reactants, hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO).
