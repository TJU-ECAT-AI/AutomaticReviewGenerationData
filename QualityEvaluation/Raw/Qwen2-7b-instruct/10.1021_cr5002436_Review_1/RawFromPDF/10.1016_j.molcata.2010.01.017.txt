DFT–GGA calculations have been used to study the chemisorption of CHx (x = 0–3), C2Hy (y = 3–5) and
C3Hz (z = 3–8) on Pt(1 1 1) at the coverage of 1/9 ML. The adsorption energies, favored binding sites and
geometric parameters of adsorption conﬁgurations are determined. All the carbonaceous species are
found to be adsorbed on Pt(1 1 1) with C atoms sp3-hybridized. The geometries of adsorption conﬁgura-
tions have been compared with published experimental data to evaluate the reliability of our calculation
method. The calculated adsorption energies of C1 species, ranked in descending order, are as follows,
C > CH > CH2 > CH3, and the similar trend has been observed with respect to the chemisorption of C2
species. As for the C3 species, propylene prefers binding to the surface in the di- mode and the adsorp-
tion energy is calculated to be −0.93 eV. The stepwise dehydrogenation of propane to propynyl (CCCH3)
is investigated by calculating the change of reaction heat, which suggests that propylidyne (CCH2CH3) is
the most stable species on Pt(1 1 1). Based on the adsorption energies and Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP)
analysis, propyne is predicted to be the most likely starting point for the C–C scission.

1. Introduction
In the past three decades, extensive efforts have been devoted
to improving a low energy consumption and inexpensive tech-
nology to feed the ever-increasing demand for oleﬁns. Propylene
plays a key role in petrochemical industry, and it is proﬁtable to
produce it from propane [1–3]. Currently, commercial process for
propylene synthesis through direct dehydrogenation of propane is
available. However, this process suffers from several problems such
as coke formation and thermodynamic limitations [4]. Compared
to the direct dehydrogenation process, the so-called dehydrogena-
tion oxidation (DHO) is preferred because of the introduction of
selective oxidation of H2.
In 1897, Sabatier discovered that transition metals were good
catalysts for the hydrogenation of hydrocarbons, and extensive
research was conducted to investigate the mechanism of such reac-
tions. Pt and Pt-based alloys have long been known as important
catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Pt-based catalyst can be used
in many industry processes, including the hydrogenation of oleﬁns,
the dehydrogenation and cracking of parafﬁns, e.g., the conver-
sion of propane to propylene [5–9]. Recently, the chemisorption
of hydrocarbons on Pt surface has been extensively studied both
theoretically and experimentally [10–13].

The dehydrogenation of propane involves a large number of side
reactions including the deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis
of propane which lead to numerous fragments ranging from C1 to C3
species adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Many experimental stud-
ies on hydrocarbon adsorption over transition metals have received
a great deal of attention in recent years. At 150 K, the dissociative
adsorption of methyl could be identiﬁed by reﬂection–absorption
infrared spectrometry (RAIRS) [14]. Moreover, Fuhrmann et al. [15]
employed the temperature-programmed XPS and molecular beam
techniques to investigate the dissociation of methane and found
that methyl was adsorbed on Pt(1 1 1) at 120 K, which was dehydro-
genated to CH at 260 K and further dehydrogenated to carbon above
500 K. As for heavier hydrocarbons, Kao and Madix [16] performed
both experimental and theoretical studies to verify that propane
was physisorbed on the metal surface, and the trapping probabil-
ity of propane on Pd(1 1 1) was higher than that on Pt(1 1 1). On
Pt(6 5 5) and Pt(1 1 0)-(1 × 2), the corrugation of the metal surface
played a key role in attracting the propane molecule [17]. At 200 K,
the formation of propylene via -hydride elimination was identi-
ﬁed by isotopic labeling TPD experiments [18]. Using RAIRS, Zaera
and Chrysostomou proposed that propylene interacted with the
Pt(1 1 1) single-crystal surface via two  metal–carbon covalent
bonds, and the rehybridization of C C double bond of propylene
took place at low coverages [1,19]. This propylene adsorption con-
ﬁguration has been conﬁrmed by Tsai et al. [12]. Furthermore,
in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions, the di- binding propy-
lene could be easily dehydrogenated to propylidyne just below the

room temperature and then to vinylmethylidyne (CCHCH2) at 450 K
[20].
The modern theoretical surface science provides us an oppor-
tunity to investigate the chemisorption and surface reaction on
the atomic scale, and helps us to understand the catalysis process
intuitively. Much theoretical work has been conducted to explore
the adsorption and reactions of hydrocarbons in the past decade,
especially for the C1 and C2 species. Jacob and Goddard [11] per-
formed DFT calculations to investigate the chemisorption of CHx
(x = 1–3) species and found that the adsorption energies of methyl,
methylene and methylidyne on the Pt surface were −2.16, −4.13
and −6.35 eV, respectively. Their calculated results were in good
agreement with the recent theoretical results [21]. Similar stud-
ies have been performed on many other surfaces, such as Ni(1 1 1)
[22], Ni(1 0 0) [23], Ru(1 1 2 0) [24], Pd(1 1 1) [25] and Cu(1 1 1) [26],
etc. The comparative DFT study on the chemisorption of methyl
and ethyl on Pt(1 1 1) [27] suggested that both these two species
favor to be adsorbed at the Atop site owing to the strong agostic
interactions between C–H bonds and surface Pt. Furthermore, Jacob
and Goddard [11] pointed out that the favored adsorption sites of
ethylidene (CHCH3) and ethylidyne (CCH3) were the Bridge and Fcc
sites, respectively. In addition, Valcárcel et al. [28–30] conducted a
theoretical study on the adsorption of propylene on Pt(1 1 1). They
proposed that propylene preferred to be adsorbed on the surface
in the di- mode and the adsorption energy was calculated to be
−0.90 eV.
In the present study, DFT calculations are employed to inves-
tigate the dehydrogenation and C–C cleavage based on the
chemisorption of the intermediates on Pt(1 1 1). We focus on the
chemisorption of C3 intermediates, and thus to predict the possible
products of the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane from the
thermodynamic point of view. The dehydrogenation of the methyl
group which is far away from the Pt surface in the C3 species is not
taken into account. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
the details of computational methods are described. In Section 3,
the adsorption energies, favored adsorption sites, optimized conﬁg-
urations of the hydrocarbon fragments (C1–C3) and the changes of
reaction heat on Pt(1 1 1) are determined. In Section 4, we conclude
by discussing the chemisorption and stability of the hydrocarbons
to predict the preferred intermediate in the dehydrogenation pro-
cess and the starting point for the C–C scission.
2. Computational details
Density functional theory calculations are carried out with the
VASP package [31–33] using a plane wave basis set. Calculations
are performed using the generalized gradient approximation func-
tional proposed by Perdew et al. [34]. The interactions between
valence electrons and ion cores are represented by Blöchl’s all-
electron-like projector augmented wave method (PAW)[35], which
regards the 6s 5d states as the valence conﬁguration for Pt, 2s 2p
states for C and 1s state for H. A plane wave energy cut off of 400 eV
is used in our calculations to achieve the tight convergence. Bril-
louin zone sampling is performed using a Monkhorst-Pack grid with
respect to the symmetry of the system and the electronic occupan-
cies are determined according to a Methfessel–Paxton scheme [36]
with an energy smearing of 0.2 eV.
A four-layer slab with a p(3 × 3) supercell is used to represent
the Pt(1 1 1) surface, achieving the coverage of adsorbates of 1/9
ML. The equilibrium Pt–Pt interatomic distance is calculated to be
2.82 Å. The successive slabs are separated by a vacuum region as
thick as 12 Å in order to avoid periodic interactions. The bottom
layer of the slab is kept ﬁxed to its crystal lattice position. The ﬁrst
Brillouin zone of the p(3 × 3) supercell is sampled sufﬁciently with
a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh.

surface. The red ball denotes the initial position of H. (For interpretation of the
references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
the article.)
Some preliminary calculations have been performed to evaluate
the reliability of our calculation method. The lattice constants of C
and Pt are calculated to be 3.58 and 3.98 Å, respectively, and the
H–H bond length is found to be 0.75 Å, which are in good agreement
with the experimental results. Spin polarization is not considered
in the calculation. The binding energy (Eads) of an adsorbate is
deﬁned by subtracting the total energy of bare surface and gaseous
radical from the total energy of adsorbed adsorbate. The adsorption
energy is calculated according to the following expression:
Eads = Eadsorbate/surface −Eadsorbate −Esurface
(1)
where Eadsorbate and Esurface are DFT total energies of gaseous species
and bare surface, respectively. A negative Eads corresponds to an
energy gain process.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. H chemiadsorption on Pt(1 1 1)
H is the main product in the dehydrogenation process of
propane, and it is also the least complex atomic species in this
study. The Pt(1 1 1) surface exhibits four high-symmetry sites for H
adsorption: Atop, Bridge, Fcc and Hcp. Hence, four conﬁgurations
are employed to study the adsorption of H on Pt(1 1 1), as shown
in Fig. 1. The energetically favorable site for H adsorption is the Fcc
site, and the adsorption energy is calculated to be −2.73 eV which is
consistent with the result obtained by the helium beam diffraction
[37]. In our calculations, it is found that H can also be adsorbed at
the Atop and hollow sites, but the adsorption energies are lower
than that on the Fcc site. The atomic H is relaxed to the adjacent
Fcc site even if it is initially placed at the Bridge site. The lengths
of Pt–H bonds at the Fcc site are calculated to be 1.87 Å, which is a
little larger than the experimental value (1.78 ± 0.8 Å) [38]. This is
because the GGA functional tends to underestimate the interatomic
forces. The optimized geometric parameters and adsorption ener-
gies are in good agreement with the current theoretical results by
other groups [27,39]. The shortest H–Pt distance and the height of
the H atom above the surface are also listed in Table 1.
3.2. C1 chemisorption on Pt(1 1 1)
Methyl has one unpaired electron and it can be easily adsorbed
on Pt(1 1 1). Similar to H, the adsorption of CH3 is investigated at
the aforementioned four high-symmetry sites. At each site, two ori-
entations of the C–H bonds are considered. After optimization, it is
found that CH3 can only be adsorbed at the Atop and Hcp sites. As

for the two conﬁgurations with different orientations of methyl at
the Atop site, the adsorption energy difference is less than 0.01 eV
which falls within the range of the inherent error of DFT. The opti-
mized conﬁguration of CH3 at the Atop site is shown in Fig. 2(a),
and the adsorption energy is calculated to be −1.99 eV. For the sake
of clarity, only seven Pt atoms in the outermost layer are shown.
The distance between C and surface is optimized to be 2.27 Å. The
underlying Pt atom is displaced out of the surface along the surface
normal, and therefore the length of the C–Pt bond is 0.20 Å shorter
than dC–surface. The CH3 groups initially placed at the Bridge and Fcc
sites are relaxed to the most stable Atop site. This is because CH3 is
a monovalent adsorbate, and it tends to bind with one Pt atom in
order to keep the sp3-hybridization. Ford et al. [21] have also found
the top site to be preferred by the CH3 adsorption. Moreover, our
calculated adsorption energy and bond lengths are in good agree-
ment with the theoretical studies of Moussounda et al. [10]. The
structure parameters are listed in Table 2.
Methylene is a divalent adsorbate. It is reasonable to assume
that CH2 prefers to bind with two Pt atoms. After optimization,
the CH2 groups initially placed at the Atop and hollow sites are
relaxed to the Bridge site, which indicates a strong preference of
the Bridge site. Interestingly, it is found that the plane with the
H–C–H group involved is perpendicular to the Pt–Pt bond at the
Bridge site, and this conﬁguration also makes C to preserve the sp3
symmetry, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The adsorption energy is calcu-

lated to be −4.06 eV. For the adsorption at the Bridge site, Kua and
Goddard [40] obtained an adsorption energy of 4.52 eV using the
cluster approach and Petersen et al. [41] claimed a similar value
of 4.61 eV on Pt-(1 × 2). The optimized C–Pt bond length is 2.05 Å,
which is a little shorter than that of the methyl group.
Both CH and C favor the Fcc site though the valency of the two
species is different. The optimized C–H bond is vertical to the Pt
surface at the hollow sites. Compared with CH3 and CH2, CH is
close to the Pt surface with the dC–surface being 1.18 Å. The adsorp-
tion energy is calculated to be −6.66 eV. However, the adsorption
energy difference between the conﬁgurations located at the Fcc
and Hcp sites is only 0.10 eV, which implies that CH diffuses read-
ily between these two sites. Because C has four H atoms missing,
it is signiﬁcantly electrophilic. Hence, C prefers to bind with more
Pt atoms to get more electrons. The favored adsorption site is Fcc
with a high adsorption energy (−7.13 eV), as shown in Fig. 2(d). The
length of the C–Pt bond is calculated to be 1.90 Å, which is short-
est among the C1 species. Paul and Sautet [25] also found that the
energetically preferred adsorption site for C on Pd(1 1 1) is the Fcc
site, and the adsorption energy is calculated to be −6.40 eV.
3.3. C2 chemisorption on Pt(1 1 1)
The dehydrogenation of propane is accompanied by the C–C
cleavage which generates both C1 and C2 species. As the dehy-
drogenation of the methyl group involved in the C3 species is not
considered, the C2 species should conceive the methyl group. Thus,
the chemisorption of ethyl, ethylidene and ethylidyne is investi-
gated.
Fig. 3(a) shows the adsorption conﬁguration of ethyl on the
Pt(1 1 1) surface. Similar to methyl, ethyl prefers to be adsorbed
at the Atop site with the CH3 group positioned over the hollow
site. The adsorption energy of ethyl is calculated to be −1.84 eV,
0.15 eV lower than that of methyl. The energy difference is expected
to arise from the interaction of methyl group with the methylene
group, which weakens the Pt–C bond. The similar phenomenon
has been experimentally reported on the H–CH3 and H–CH2CH3
bond energy difference (0.14 eV) [42]. The adsorption energies of
the ethyl group with different orientations at the Atop site are very
similar (energy difference is less than 0.01 eV), which indicates that
the rotation of the adsorbate is feasible. The length of the Pt–C bond
is calculated to be 2.10 Å, a little longer than that of methyl. The
favorable adsorption conﬁguration of ethyl reported by Jacob and
Goddard [11] was in good agreement with our calculated results.
The structure parameters are illustrated in Table 3.
The energetically favored site for CHCH3 is the Bridge site, as
shown in Fig. 3(b). By replacing the methyl group with H, the
adsorption conﬁguration of ethylidene is almost the same as that
of methylene. Upon adsorption, the C–C bond of the ethylidene
radical is stretched from 1.46 to 1.50 Å. This is because some elec-
trons are transferred from the metal surface to the electrophilic

CH group, which weakens the C–C bond. The adsorption energy
of ethylidene is calculated to be −3.82 eV, which is 0.24 eV lower
than that of methylene but higher than that of ethyl. The length of
the Pt–C bond is 2.05 Å, 0.02 Å shorter than that of the methylene
group. Both methylene and ethylidene are divalent adsorbates, and
the calculated results show that the favored sites for both species
are the Bridge site, which was veriﬁed by Michaelides and Hu [43].
Ethylidyne has three H atoms missing. As shown in the Fig. 3(c),
CCH3 favors to be adsorbed at the hollow site and forms three cova-
lent C–Pt bonds with the C–C bond vertical to the Pt surface. The
calculated parameters are summarized in Table 3. From the table,
the energetically favorable site for CCH3 adsorption is the Fcc site,
and the adsorption energy is calculated to be −5.92 eV. Compared
with the calculated results of CH, the adsorption energy is lowered
by 0.74 eV, but remains 1.90 eV higher than that of ethylidene. This
is because ethylidyne is more electrophilic than ethylidene, which
enhances the interactions between the adsorbate and metal sur-
face. Ethylidyne is likely to be adsorbed at the Hcp site as well, but
the adsorption energy is a little lower (−5.84 eV).
3.4. C3 chemisorption on Pt(1 1 1)
3.4.1. C3H8 (propane)
The adsorption of propane is investigated by locating the
adsorbate at the Atop, Bridge and hollow sites on Pt(1 1 1). After
optimization, the propane molecule is repelled by the metal sur-
face, drifting over the surface. The adsorption energies fall within
the range of −0.02 to −0.06 eV, which indicates that the nature of
the interaction between propane and Pt surface is physisorption.
This is because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron, and
propane cannot be absorbed by binding with Pt atoms. The struc-
ture parameters and adsorption energy are summarized in Table 4.
From the table, it is found that the lengths of C–H bonds and C–C
bonds are almost the same as those of the isolated propane (C–C:
1.53 Å, C–H: 1.10–1.11 Å). Wang [17] investigated the effects of sur-
face step on propane adsorption on Pt(6 5 5) through molecular
dynamics simulation. It was found that the least efﬁcient zone for
propane adsorption was the top of the surface step on the upper ter-
race, while the most favored zone was near the step edge. Song and
Rees [44] claimed that the adsorption heat of propane in silicalite-1
was 0.41 eV and the diffusion barrier was 0.16 eV.
3.4.2. C3H7 (1-propyl, 2-propyl)
In our calculations, it is found that the energetically favorable
site for 1-propyl is the Atop site. 1-Propyl is relaxed to this site
even if the fragment is initially placed at the Bridge or hollow sites.
The optimized adsorption conﬁguration of 1-propyl is shown in
Fig. 4(b). The adsorption of 1-propyl is similar to the aforemen-
tioned monovalent adsorbates. The adsorption energy is calculated
to be −1.88 eV, which is a little larger than that of the ethyl group
but lower than that of the methyl group. The optimized C–C bond
length is similar to that of propane. As for the adsorption of 2-
propyl, it is predicted that the energetically preferred adsorption
site is Atop, as shown in Fig. 4(c), and the adsorption energy is cal-
culated to be −1.66 eV which is 0.22 eV lower than that of 1-propyl.
The energy difference indicates that the dissociation of C–H bond
on methyl group is thermodynamically preferred. This can also be
understood by the energy difference between the C–H bonds on the
terminal and middle C in propane which is analogous to the adsorp-
tion energy difference. It is known that the C–H bond energy in the
methylene group is 0.21 eV lower than that in the methyl group.

3.4.3. C3H6 (propylene, 1-propylidene, 2-propylidene)
Propylene is an active intermediate. As propylene has a half-
saturated double bond (C C), it can be readily absorbed and
decomposed on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The adsorption of propylene
is investigated by assigning the propylene molecule at the Atop and
Bridge sites (named as  and di- adsorption modes, respectively).
After optimization, it is found that propylene can be adsorbed sta-
bly in both adsorption modes. The energetically favorable site is the
Bridge site, and the adsorption energy is calculated to be −0.93 eV
which is 0.27 eV higher than that of the  adsorption. The optimized
geometry is consistent with the LEED results [45], which revealed
that propylene bound to two surface Pt atoms through its unsat-
urated C C bond and formed a disordered monolayer. As shown
in Fig. 4(d), the C C bond lies over the Bridge site and forms two
covalent C–Pt bonds to share the electronic density with Pt atoms.
The calculated structure parameters are listed in Table 4. From the
table, it is found that the length of the C C bond is signiﬁcantly
stretched from 1.36 (in gaseous propylene) to 1.50 Å, which is close
to the C–C distance of propane. Interestingly, the adsorbed propy-
lene loses its “planarity” as the C–H bonds bend away from the
surface plane. The distortion of propylene indicates that the di-
adsorption mode preserves the sp3 symmetry of C. The coadsorp-
tion of propylene and atomic H is also studied in the same p(3 × 3)
supercell by assigning propylene and atomic H at the Bridge and
hollow sites, respectively. The coadsorbed H favors the Fcc site,
and the coadsorption energy of these two species is calculated
to be −3.60 eV. Compared to the adsorption energy of separated
propylene, the coadsorption energy of propylene is lowered by
0.06 eV, which indicates that the adsorption of propylene is weak-
ened by the coadsorbed H. The calculated results are in agreement
with the TPD experiments studied by Zaera and Chrysostomou
[1].
To further investigate the chemisorption of propylene on
Pt(1 1 1), the density of state projected (PDOS) on the C p orbitals
of the CH2 group are given in Fig. 5. The zero energy refers to the
Fermi level. By analyzing of PDOSs, it is clear that the 2p states in
adsorbed propylene shift to low energy region, which indicates that
the C atoms interact with the Pt surface to form new covalent bonds.
However, Fig. 5 shows little evidence for the preference between
the two adsorption conﬁgurations. In order to understand the pref-
erence of propylene for the di- adsorption modes, the charge of
C atoms is investigated through Bader charge analysis. This anal-
ysis carries out the decomposition of electronic charge density
into atomic contributions. Calculations are performed for the two
adsorption conﬁgurations. The valence charges of all the atoms
in propylene are summed up so as to represent the interactions
between propylene and Pt surface. For the di- and  adsorption,
the valence charges are calculated to be 17.90 and 17.81, respec-
tively, which indicate that the interaction between propylene and
Pt surface in the di- adsorption is stronger. This is supported by
the valence charge density analysis, as shown in Fig. 6. The valence
charge density is calculated for the two conﬁgurations and plot-
ted perpendicular to the Pt surface with the C–Pt bonds involved.
As shown in Fig. 6, the strong C–Pt covalent bonds are formed by
sharing electrons in the two conﬁgurations. In the di- adsorption,
the valence charge density between C and Pt surface is larger than
that of the  adsorption, indicating a stronger C–Pt bond. Hence,
the di- adsorption is predicted to be preferred.
As shown in Fig. 4(e), 1-propylidene (CHCH2CH3) favors the
Bridge site with the ethyl group lying over the hollow site on

Pt(1 1 1). The adsorption energy is calculated to be −3.86 eV, which
is lower than those of ethylidene and methylene. The length of
C–Pt bond is 2.07 Å, and all the C–C and C–H bonds are almost the
same as those in gaseous propane. The adsorption of 2-propylidene
(CH3CCH3) is similar to 1-propylidene. The calculated results also
show that the preferred adsorption site is the Bridge site with the
methyl group lying over the hollow site, and the adsorption energy
is calculated to be −3.09 eV. The length of C–C bond and Pt–C bond
is in good agreement with the results by Valcárcel et al. [29].
3.4.4. C3H5 (1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, propylidyne)
Propenyl can be easily generated from the deep dehydrogena-
tion of propylene [20]. As the dehydrogenation of the methyl group
in vacuum is not taken into account, C1–C2–CH3 is employed to
represent the C3Hx (x = 5–8) intermediates. 1-Propenyl has three H
atoms missing, two in the C1 group and one in the C2 group. The
favorable adsorption site is the Fcc site, and the adsorption energy is
calculated to be −3.09 eV. As shown in Fig. 4(g), the C1 group binds
to the surface with two covalent bonds, and the C2 group binds to
one Pt atom, which keeps each C atom to be sp3-hybridized. The
length of the C1–C2 bond is 1.48 Å, which is shorter than that of
propane (1.53 Å). The adsorption of 2-propenyl (CH2CCH3) is simi-
lar to 1-propenyl, as shown in Fig. 4(h). The C1 group prefers to bind
with one Pt atom, while the C2 group prefers two. This is also an
evidence that the divalent adsorbates favor the Bridge site and the
monovalent adsorbates favor the Atop site. The adsorption energy

modes.
is calculated to be −2.86 eV. The optimized bond lengths of the
conﬁguration are listed in Table 4.
The LEED [20] analysis indicated that propylidyne favored the
Fcc site. The optimized adsorption geometries of propylidyne
are similar to those of methylidyne and ethylidyne. As shown
in Fig. 4(j), propylidyne is adsorbed at the Fcc site by forming
three covalent bonds with Pt atoms with the adsorption energy
calculated to be −3.56 eV, and the C–Pt bond lengths are cal-
culated to be 2.02 Å. The adsorption energies of methylidyne,
ethylidyne and propylidyne are in the following order, methyli-
dyne > ethylidyne > propylidyne. Hence, it can be deduced that the
weakening of the adsorption is attributed to the presence of the
saturate hydrocarbon group.
3.4.5. Other hydrocarbons: C3H4 (propenylidene, propyne) and
C3H3 (propynyl)
The conﬁgurations of chemisorbed propyne and propenylidene
(CCHCH3) are shown in Fig. 4(i) and (k), respectively. The gaseous
propyne binds strongly to the Pt(1 1 1) surface because of the sig-
niﬁcantly electrophilic C C triple bond. Both C1 and C2 groups
have two H atoms missing, thus the two groups favor the Bridge
sites with the triple bond lying over the Fcc site. The adsorbed
propyne loses its linearity in order to keep each C atom to be sp3-
hybridized. The bond length of C1–C2 is calculated to be 1.40 Å,
which is longer than that in the gaseous propyne but shorter than
those in the C3Hx (x = 5–8) intermediates. The adsorption energy
is calculated to be −2.09 eV. The optimized geometric parame-
ters are in good agreements with the TPD and theoretical results
[46,47]. Jacob and Goddard [11] reported that vinylidene (CCH2)
favored to be adsorbed at the Fcc site in order to keep all the C
atoms tetrahedral on the Pt(1 1 1) cluster. The conﬁguration of the
adsorbed propenylidene is similar to vinylidene by replacing the
methyl group with a H atom. After optimization, it is found that
the C1 group favors to bind to three Pt atoms, and the C2 group
prefers only one Pt atom. The lengths of the C–C and Pt–C bonds
are consistent with the results by Valcárcel et al. [29]. The structure
parameters and adsorption energies are shown in Table 4.
Propynyl is generated from both propyne and propenylidene by
the removal of one H atom. Propynyl favors to be adsorbed at the
Fcc site with the C1–C2 bond parallel to the metal surface and the
methyl group pointing towards vacuum. The C1 group prefers to
bind to three Pt atoms, while the C2 group favors only one, which
is similar to the adsorption conﬁguration of propenylidene. The
adsorption energy is calculated to be −4.63 eV, and the length of the
C1–C2 bond is 1.34 Å which is longer than that of gaseous propyne
but shorter than that in the adsorbed propyne.
3.5. Thermodynamic analysis
Dehydrogenation of propane may produce a variety of inter-
mediates. In order to investigate the stability of these species on
Pt(1 1 1), we obtain the relative energies of the intermediates with
respect to the gas-phase propane and adsorbed H, which are sum-
marized in Fig. 7. It is assumed that any H atoms detached from
the hydrocarbons are adsorbed on the surface at a distance far
away from the coadsorbed species, which allows us to neglect the
coadsorption effects of H. Based on the relative energies of the inter-
mediates, it is possible to calculate the changes of reaction heat for
different reactions, and ﬁnd out the most likely reaction pathway.
It is well known that the activation of C–H bond is strongly
endothermic in the gaseous propane, e.g., the experimental C–H
bond energies in the methyl group and methylene group are 420
and 401 kJ/mol, respectively. The formation of 1-propyl and 2-
propyl from propane is almost thermoneutral with the similar
reaction heat calculated to be −0.02 and −0.01 eV, respectively.
Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the energy barriers for

the initial activation of propane are close to each other accord-
ing to the BEP relationship [48,49]. Propylene can be obtained via
dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and isomerization. All these three
reactions are exothermic, and the most favorable pathway follows
the isomerization of 2-propylidene to propylene. The most stable
fragment on Pt surface is propylidyne because the dehydrogena-
tion of propane to produce propylidyne releases the maximum
amount of heat (−0.73 eV). Propyne is likely to be isomerized to
propenylidene and releases 0.17 eV. It is shown in the energy pro-
ﬁle that the formation of propynyl from gaseous propane is 0.30 eV
endothermic. Moreover, the reaction heat to produce propynyl
from propyne is calculated to be 0.58 eV, which is highest among
all the dehydrogenation reactions. According to the BEP relation-
ship, the barrier of the formation of propynyl is predicted to
be much higher than those of other dehydrogenation reactions.
It is reasonable to suggest that propynyl is the most energeti-
cally unfavorable intermediates involved in the decomposition of
propane. Hence, it can be concluded that the most likely reaction
pathway for propane dehydrogenation is propane →1-propyl →1-
propylidene →propylidyne.
The bond energies of C–C, C C and C≡C are calculated to be
−3.95, −7.59 and −9.87 eV, respectively, indicating that the scis-
sion of these bonds is hindered by a large barrier in the gas-phase.
However, the C–C bond cleaves readily if the metal atoms form
stronger chemical bonds with C atoms [44,45]. In our calculations,
it is found that the adsorption is generally enhanced with the pro-
ceeding of the stepwise dehydrogenation. It is therefore reasonable
to expect that the activation of the C–C bond is related to the num-
ber of H atoms in the hydrocarbons. Based on the relative energies
of the fragments and reaction heat changes of cracking shown in
Table 5, the qualitative approach is performed to investigate the
reaction. As the gaseous propane is physisorbed on the Pt(1 1 1) sur-
face, the activation energy of the cracking of propane is very close
to the C–C bond energy, which indicates that the reaction barrier is
quite high. The adsorption energy of propylene is calculated to be
−0.93 eV, while the results for the other two C3H6 isomers are larger
than −3.00 eV. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the cracking of
propylene is unfavorable. In addition, the reaction heat of the crack-
ing of 2-propylidene is 0.34 eV higher than that of 1-propylidene,
indicating that the C–C bond breaking of 2-propylidene is ener-
getically preferred. In our calculations, propylidyne is found to be
the most thermodynamically favored product in dehydrogenation,
while the reaction heat of its cracking is positively 1.09 eV, imply-
ing a large barrier according to the BEP relationship. Though the
reaction heats of the cracking of propynyl and 2-propylidene are

negative, they are not expected to be the likely starting point for
the C–C scission because both two species are not favored in the
dehydrogenation process. Hence, propyne is suggested to be favor-
able for cracking owing to strong adsorption and large negative
reaction heat.
4. Conclusion
DFT–GGA calculations have been performed to study the
chemisorption of CHx (x = 0–3), C2Hy (y = 3–5) and C3Hz (z = 3–8)
on Pt(1 1 1) at the surface coverage of 0.11 ML. Our calculated
results provide a detailed thermodynamic approach to investigate
the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane on Pt(1 1 1).
1. The atomic H prefers to be adsorbed at the Fcc site, and
the adsorption energy is calculated to be −2.73 eV. Calculated
adsorption energies of C1 species are in the following order,
C > CH > CH2 > CH3. CH3 and CH2 favor the Atop and Bridge site,
respectively, and both CH and C prefer the Fcc sites. This is an
evidence that the monovalent and divalent adsorbates favor the
Atop and the Bridge sites, respectively, and the trivalent and
tetravalent adsorbates prefer the hollow sites. The similar trend
has been observed on the adsorption of C2 species.
2. The chemisorption of C3Hx (x = 3–7) is investigated by assigning
the adsorbates at all the possible adsorption sites. In general, all
the C3 species favor to be adsorbed at the sites with C atoms
kept to be sp3-hybridized. The propane molecule is found to be
physisorbed on the Pt surface. The optimized adsorption conﬁg-
uration of propylene is characterized as the di- mode, and the
adsorption energy is calculated to be −0.93 eV which is 0.27 eV
higher in energy than that of the  adsorption mode. Our calcu-
lated results for adsorption energies and geometries are in good
agreement with the recent experimental and theoretical results.
3. In addition, the reaction heat of the dehydrogenation and crack-
ing of propane are calculated. According to the BEP relationship,
it is apparent that propylidyne is the most likely product in the
dehydrogenation process. The formation of propynyl is predicted
to be hindered by a relative high barrier on Pt surface. Combin-
ing the analysis of the chemisorption of intermediates and the
reaction heat changes of cracking, propyne is suggested to be the
most likely starting point for the C–C scission.
