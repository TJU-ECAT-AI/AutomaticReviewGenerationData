[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, -Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."
[2] "The content of carbon was measured by a thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) instrument from room temperature to 700°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min in an air flow of 30 mL/min."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a conventional quartz tubular micro-reactor and all the catalysts were reduced in H2 at 500°C for 8 h before catalytic evaluation."
[4] "The conversion of propane and selectivity were expressed as mole percent and were calculated as follows: Conversion (mol%) = moles of C3 reacted / moles of C3 fed × 100; Selectivity (mol%) = moles of product i formed / moles of C3 fed × Ni / NC3 × 100."
[5] "The main reason for the decrease in amounts of hydrogen on metallic Pt is the sintering of particles."
[6] "The most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles can be obtained when the used support is mesoporous alumina."
[7] "Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of -Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke."
[8] "In this case, the remarkable stability of dehydrogenation can be obtained over the PtSn/MA catalyst in the recycle reaction."
[9] "In the present study, the porous character of PtSn/-Al2O3 catalyst was analyzed by mercury intrusion, and the corresponding density and porosity were collected in Table 2."
[10] "Considering that the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method from BET measurement is still limited to rather large pore sizes, more standard measurement, such as mercury intrusion porosimetry, should be used to access the pore size distribution (PSD) of mesoporous or macroporous materials."

Comparisons between noble metal-based catalysts (such as Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins are not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the preparation and evaluation of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on various supports, including ZSM-5, -Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, and SBA-15. The text also outlines methodologies for measuring the properties of the catalysts, including TG-DTA for carbon content, a quartz tubular micro-reactor for dehydrogenation, and calculations for conversion and selectivity. It notes that the presence of strong acid sites in ZSM-5 supports leads to more cracking reactions, while the porous character of -Al2O3 increases coke accumulation. Furthermore, the use of mesoporous alumina supports facilitates the dispersion of metallic particles, resulting in improved catalytic stability and selectivity. For a thorough understanding of the comparative analysis of these catalyst types, additional literature focusing specifically on the comparison between noble metals and metal oxides in this context would be required.

关于非氧化性轻烯烃脱氢领域中贵金属催化剂（如铂）与金属氧化物催化剂（CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）之间的比较，文献中并未提供。然而，文献确实讨论了不同支持（包括ZSM-5、-Al2O3、多孔氧化铝和SBA-15）上双金属铂锡催化剂的制备和评估。文献也概述了测量催化剂性质的方法，包括用于碳含量的TG-DTA、用于脱氢的石英管微反应器、以及对转化率和选择性的计算。它指出，在ZSM-5支撑物中强酸位的存在会导致更多的裂解反应，而-Al2O3的多孔特性会增加焦炭积累。此外，使用多孔氧化铝支持有助于金属颗粒的分散，从而提高催化稳定性。为了深入了解这两种催化剂类型的全面比较，需要额外的文献专门探讨贵金属与金属氧化物在这方面的对比分析。
