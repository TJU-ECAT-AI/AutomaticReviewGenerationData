[1] "Among several reported catalysts, supported platinumtin catalysts have been studied in depth since they show relatively high activity and selectivity in the process."
[2] "Compared with this, the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of -Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke."
[3] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."
[4] "As discussed before, this may be due to the stabilized effect to tin species by the presence of the support."
[5] "In this way, the reduction of tin component becomes more difficult and the more strengthened interactions of Pt with SnOx species exist, which is favorable for the improvement of reaction stability."
[6] "On the other hand, the catalytic capacity to adsorb H2 at high temperature becomes stronger after the use of MA support."

1.Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are widely used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high activity and selectivity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are less frequently utilized but offer alternative options. These metal oxides typically exhibit different compositions and effectiveness depending on the specific application. Industrial applications of these catalysts include the production of propene, acrolein, polypropene, and acrylic acid. Recent developments in the field have focused on optimizing the catalyst compositions and enhancing their stability and selectivity. The advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include their high reactivity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts might offer lower costs or better resistance to poisoning. 

2. The composition of noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, often includes the noble metal itself along with a promoter to enhance activity and selectivity. In contrast, metal oxide-based catalysts consist of the metal oxide as the active phase. Noble metals like Platinum typically exhibit high activity and selectivity, whereas metal oxides might offer stability or cost-effectiveness. 

3. Industrial applications of these catalysts span various chemical industries, including petrochemicals, plastics, and fine chemicals. They are crucial in processes like the production of propene, which is essential for downstream applications such as the manufacture of polypropylene. Additionally, they play a role in the synthesis of other valuable chemicals like acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid.

4. Recent developments in the field include the optimization of catalyst formulations to improve activity, selectivity, and stability. This includes the use of advanced materials, such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) or nanocarriers, to support the active phases and enhance their performance. Research also focuses on understanding the mechanisms behind catalyst deactivation and finding ways to mitigate issues like coke formation.

5. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have potential advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and resistance to poisoning. They might offer lower costs compared to noble metal-based catalysts and could potentially withstand harsher reaction conditions. However, they typically exhibit lower activity and selectivity, necessitating longer reaction times or higher temperatures to achieve desired yields.

6. The presence of different supports in the catalyst formulations can significantly influence the catalyst's performance. Supports like mesoporous alumina (MA), ZSM-5 zeolite, and SBA-15 can affect the dispersion of metallic particles, the interaction between noble metals and metal oxides, and the catalytic stability. For instance, MA can lead to a more uniform distribution of particles and stronger interactions between Pt and SnOx species, enhancing reaction stability. ZSM-5 introduces strong acid sites that can increase cracking reactions, while -Al2O3 supports might increase coke accumulation due to its porous character. SBA-15, on the other hand, can lead to agglomeration of particles and easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction.

7. The catalytic capacity to adsorb H2 at high temperature becomes stronger after the use of MA support. This can contribute to enhanced stability and efficiency of the catalyst in the reaction process. The improved adsorption of H2 might facilitate better utilization of the catalyst by reducing the risk of coke formation and promoting the desired reaction pathways.

1. 铂基催化剂，尤其是铂，在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中因其高活性和选择性而被广泛使用。金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，则较少被应用，但提供了替代方案。这些金属氧化物根据特定应用的不同组成和有效性。工业应用包括丙烯、丙烯酸、聚丙烯和甲基丙烯酸等化学品的生产。最近的发展集中在优化催化剂组成以提高活性、选择性和稳定性上。铂基催化剂的优点包括高反应性和选择性，而金属氧化物基催化剂可能提供较低的成本或更好的抗毒性能。

2. 铂基催化剂的组成通常包含铂本身及其促进剂，以增强活性和选择性。相比之下，金属氧化物基催化剂由金属氧化物作为活性相构成。铂等贵金属通常表现出较高的活性和选择性，而金属氧化物可能提供成本效益或耐毒性能。

3. 这些催化剂在化学工业中的应用范围广泛，包括石油化学、塑料和精细化学品行业。它们对于丙烯的生产至关重要，丙烯是聚丙烯下游应用的重要原料。此外，它们在合成其他有价值的化学品如丙烯酸、聚乙酸乙烯酯和甲基丙烯酸中的作用也不可或缺。

4. 最近的研究重点在于优化催化剂配方以提高活性、选择性和稳定性。这包括使用先进材料，如金属有机框架（MOFs）或纳米载体，来支持活性相并增强其性能。研究还集中在理解催化剂失活机制并找到减轻焦炭形成等问题的方法。

5. CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂具有成本效益和抗毒性的潜在优势。与铂基催化剂相比，它们可能具有更低的成本，并且能够承受更恶劣的反应条件。然而，它们通常活性和选择性较低，需要更长的反应时间和更高的温度才能达到所需的产率。

6. 不同载体在催化剂配方中的存在可以显著影响催化剂的性能。例如，微孔氧化铝（MA）、ZSM-5沸石和SBA-15可以影响金属颗粒的分散、铂与金属氧化物之间的相互作用以及催化稳定性。微孔氧化铝可能导致更均匀的颗粒分布和更强的铂与SnOx物种之间的相互作用，从而增强反应稳定性。ZSM-5引入强酸位点，可能增加裂解反应，而-Al2O3支持可能会增加焦炭积累，因为其多孔性质。SBA-15可能导致颗粒聚集和锡物种的容易还原，这对反应不利。

7. 使用MA支持后，催化剂的高温度下吸附H2的能力增强。这可能有助于提高催化剂在反应过程中的稳定性和效率。改善的H2吸附可能通过降低焦炭形成的风险并促进期望的反应途径来增强催化剂的利用。
