The document discusses the comparative study of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on various supports for propane dehydrogenation. The key findings highlight the influence of support type on the catalyst's structure and performance. The mesoporous alumina support leads to the most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles, promoting spillover hydrogen and stabilizing the oxidative state of tin species, thus enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity. Conversely, the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 and the porous nature of -Al2O3 increase cracking reactions and coke accumulation, respectively. The use of SBA-15 support results in agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, negatively impacting the reaction. The study concludes that the selection of support material significantly affects the catalytic properties of Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts.

[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, -Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."
[2] "The content of carbon was measured by a thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) instrument from room temperature to 700°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min in an air flow of 30 mL/min."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a conventional quartz tubular micro-reactor and all the catalysts were reduced in H2 at 500°C for 8 h before catalytic evaluation."
[4] "The conversion of propane and selectivity were expressed as mole percent and were calculated as follows: Conversion (mol%) = moles of C3 reacted / moles of C3 fed × 100; Selectivity (mol%) = moles of product i formed / moles of C3 fed × Ni / NC3 × 100."
[5] "The main reason for the decrease in amounts of hydrogen on metallic Pt is the sintering of particles."
[6] "The most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles can be obtained when the used support is mesoporous alumina."
[7] "Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of -Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke."
[8] "In this case, the remarkable stability of dehydrogenation can be obtained over the PtSn/MA catalyst in the recycle reaction."
[9] "In the present study, the porous character of PtSn/-Al2O3 catalyst was analyzed by mercury intrusion, and the corresponding density and porosity were collected in Table 2."
[10] "Considering that the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method from BET measurement is still limited to rather large pore sizes, more standard measurement, such as mercury intrusion porosimetry, should be used to access the pore size distribution (PSD) of mesoporous or macroporous materials."

Comparisons between noble metal-based catalysts (such as Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins are not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the preparation and evaluation of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on various supports, including ZSM-5, -Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, and SBA-15. The text also outlines methodologies for measuring the properties of the catalysts, including TG-DTA for carbon content, a quartz tubular micro-reactor for dehydrogenation, and calculations for conversion and selectivity. It notes that the presence of strong acid sites in ZSM-5 supports leads to more cracking reactions, while the porous character of -Al2O3 increases coke accumulation. Furthermore, the use of mesoporous alumina supports facilitates the dispersion of metallic particles, resulting in improved catalytic stability and selectivity. For a thorough understanding of the comparative analysis of these catalyst types, additional literature focusing specifically on the comparison between noble metals and metal oxides in this context would be required.

[2] "Indeed, propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."
[3] "However, it should be noted that the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, which requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."
[4] "Therefore, the development of the catalysts having high activity, stability and selectivity is a topic of enormous importance."
[5] "Among several reported catalysts, supported platinum-tin catalysts have been studied in depth since they show relatively high activity and selectivity in the process [811]."
[6] "In general, the catalytic properties of the PtSn catalysts strongly depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state of Sn, and the support effect [12]."
[7] "As regards the role of support, it cannot only modify the selectivity of the process by catalyzing lateral reactions, but also influence the properties of the final metallic phase [13]."
[8] "Moreover, the presence of support has been considered as a vital factor to affect the formation, the distribution and dispersion of active sites on the catalyst [14, 15]."
[9] "Alumina has been used as an adsorbent, catalyst or catalyst support due to its desirable textual properties and surface acid-base properties."
[10] "For instance, -Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst is commonly used in reforming or dehydrogenation process [16]."
[11] "Nevertheless, the reaction performance is still not satisfactory, especially regarding the stability of the catalyst."
[12] "As a consequence, during the process of dehydrogenation reaction, the use of new carrier with distinctive structure and property has received a great deal of attention [17]."
[13] "Compared with the conventional support of -Al2O3, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel, adjusted Si Al ratio and relatively large surface area [18]."
[14] "These properties make ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."

[16] "To further promote the desired reaction, the introduction of a third metal has been confirmed as an effective method [18, 21, 22]."
[17] "It is believed that the presence of the promoter can improve the reaction selectivity by neutralizing the acidity of the support."
[18] "Meanwhile, due to the specific framework and channel structure, ZSM-5 zeolites can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability [23]."
[19] "Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-15 and mesoporous alumina are often used as the catalyst support to disperse active phase with more active sites."
[20] "Actually, SBA-15 possesses well-ordered pore structure, high thermal stability and high surface area, which are good for uniformly loading the catalytic active component and consequent catalytic reactions."
[21] "On the other hand, as for the mesoporous alumina, it has been suggested that this material simultaneously possesses the characteristics of the alumina and mesoporous materials [12]."
[22] "That is to say, when this material is selected to load Pt and Sn components, the alumina feature of the support may help to stabilize the oxidative state of Sn, while the mesoporous characteristic having a certain pore volume favors the catalytic capacity to accommodate the coke that formed or migrated."
[23] "In addition, the incorporation of some rare earth metals into the alumina matrix may increase the platinum dispersion and decrease the reduction temperature of PtSn species [26]."
[24] "Obviously, different support has its own characteristic and may exhibit the distinctive effect on the catalytic property."
[25] "Therefore, it is necessary to study the influences of the different supports on the catalytic performances for PtSn catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."
[26] "Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the systematic studies on the effect of the different supports have seldom been reported."
[27] "In the present work, a series of PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, ZSM-5, SBA-15) were prepared."
[28] "To obtain information about the changes of catalytic structure and nature of the active sites, the prepared samples were characterized by several techniques, such as XRF, XRD, nitrogen adsorption, TEM, NH3-TPD, TPR, hydrogen chemisorption, H2-TPD, and TPO."
[29] "Particular emphasis was focused on the changes of catalyst acidity and Pt characters, as well as the interaction of Pt with SnOx species."
[30] "All the results were correlated with a corresponding catalytic reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[31] "This can provide us with important information to understand the effect of support with different surface and porous character on supported metallic catalyst."
[32] "2.1. Catalyst preparation The mesoporous alumina (MA) was synthesized by solgel method as described in literature [12, 26] and the -Al2O3 powder was obtained by grinding the commercial alumina spheres."
[33] "Then, the synthesized material together with other porous materials and zeolites of different pore structures (-Al2O3, ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 90), SBA-15) were used as the supports."
[34] "The bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on different support (PtSn/M, M: different supports) were prepared by co-impregnating the supports (M) with excess aqueous solutions of 0.033 M H2PtCl6 and 0.153 M SnCl4."
[35] "Afterward, the prepared samples were dried at 80 °C for 3 h."
[36] "In all cases, the loadings of Pt and Sn were 0.5 and 1.0 wt.%, respectively."
[37] "Then, the samples supported on different supports were pelletized and crushed to 10-12 mesh size."
[38] "After totally dried, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 4 h and dechlorinated at 500 °C for 4 h in air containing steam."
[39] "The metallic contents were obtained by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements on a SWITZERLAND ARL9800 XRF."

1.Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are widely used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high activity and selectivity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are less frequently utilized but offer alternative options. These metal oxides typically exhibit different compositions and effectiveness depending on the specific application. Industrial applications of these catalysts include the production of propene, acrolein, polypropene, and acrylic acid. Recent developments in the field have focused on optimizing the catalyst compositions and enhancing their stability and selectivity. The advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include their high reactivity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts might offer lower costs or better resistance to poisoning. 

2. The composition of noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, often includes the noble metal itself along with a promoter to enhance activity and selectivity. In contrast, metal oxide-based catalysts consist of the metal oxide as the active phase. Noble metals like Platinum typically exhibit high activity and selectivity, whereas metal oxides might offer stability or cost-effectiveness. 

3. Industrial applications of these catalysts span various chemical industries, including petrochemicals, plastics, and fine chemicals. They are crucial in processes like the production of propene, which is essential for downstream applications such as the manufacture of polypropylene. Additionally, they play a role in the synthesis of other valuable chemicals like acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid.

4. Recent developments in the field include the optimization of catalyst formulations to improve activity, selectivity, and stability. This includes the use of advanced materials, such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) or nanocarriers, to support the active phases and enhance their performance. Research also focuses on understanding the mechanisms behind catalyst deactivation and finding ways to mitigate issues like coke formation.

5. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have potential advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and resistance to poisoning. They might offer lower costs compared to noble metal-based catalysts and could potentially withstand harsher reaction conditions. However, they typically exhibit lower activity and selectivity, necessitating longer reaction times or higher temperatures to achieve desired yields.

6. The presence of different supports in the catalyst formulations can significantly influence the catalyst's performance. Supports like mesoporous alumina (MA), ZSM-5 zeolite, and SBA-15 can affect the dispersion of metallic particles, the interaction between noble metals and metal oxides, and the catalytic stability. For instance, MA can lead to a more uniform distribution of particles and stronger interactions between Pt and SnOx species, enhancing reaction stability. ZSM-5 introduces strong acid sites that can increase cracking reactions, while -Al2O3 supports might increase coke accumulation due to its porous character. SBA-15, on the other hand, can lead to agglomeration of particles and easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction.

7. The catalytic capacity to adsorb H2 at high temperature becomes stronger after the use of MA support. This can contribute to enhanced stability and efficiency of the catalyst in the reaction process. The improved adsorption of H2 might facilitate better utilization of the catalyst by reducing the risk of coke formation and promoting the desired reaction pathways.

1. 铂基催化剂，尤其是铂，在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中因其高活性和选择性而被广泛使用。金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，则较少被应用，但提供了替代方案。这些金属氧化物根据特定应用的不同组成和有效性。工业应用包括丙烯、丙烯酸、聚丙烯和甲基丙烯酸等化学品的生产。最近的发展集中在优化催化剂组成以提高活性、选择性和稳定性上。铂基催化剂的优点包括高反应性和选择性，而金属氧化物基催化剂可能提供较低的成本或更好的抗毒性能。

2. 铂基催化剂的组成通常包含铂本身及其促进剂，以增强活性和选择性。相比之下，金属氧化物基催化剂由金属氧化物作为活性相构成。铂等贵金属通常表现出较高的活性和选择性，而金属氧化物可能提供成本效益或耐毒性能。

3. 这些催化剂在化学工业中的应用范围广泛，包括石油化学、塑料和精细化学品行业。它们对于丙烯的生产至关重要，丙烯是聚丙烯下游应用的重要原料。此外，它们在合成其他有价值的化学品如丙烯酸、聚乙酸乙烯酯和甲基丙烯酸中的作用也不可或缺。

4. 最近的研究重点在于优化催化剂配方以提高活性、选择性和稳定性。这包括使用先进材料，如金属有机框架（MOFs）或纳米载体，来支持活性相并增强其性能。研究还集中在理解催化剂失活机制并找到减轻焦炭形成等问题的方法。

5. CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂具有成本效益和抗毒性的潜在优势。与铂基催化剂相比，它们可能具有更低的成本，并且能够承受更恶劣的反应条件。然而，它们通常活性和选择性较低，需要更长的反应时间和更高的温度才能达到所需的产率。

6. 不同载体在催化剂配方中的存在可以显著影响催化剂的性能。例如，微孔氧化铝（MA）、ZSM-5沸石和SBA-15可以影响金属颗粒的分散、铂与金属氧化物之间的相互作用以及催化稳定性。微孔氧化铝可能导致更均匀的颗粒分布和更强的铂与SnOx物种之间的相互作用，从而增强反应稳定性。ZSM-5引入强酸位点，可能增加裂解反应，而-Al2O3支持可能会增加焦炭积累，因为其多孔性质。SBA-15可能导致颗粒聚集和锡物种的容易还原，这对反应不利。

7. 使用MA支持后，催化剂的高温度下吸附H2的能力增强。这可能有助于提高催化剂在反应过程中的稳定性和效率。改善的H2吸附可能通过降低焦炭形成的风险并促进期望的反应途径来增强催化剂的利用。
