[1] "Recently, extensive studies have been made on supported Pt or Cr catalysts [46]."
[2] "Indeed, propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."
[3] "However, it should be noted that the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, which requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."
[4] "Therefore, the development of the catalysts having high activity, stability and selectivity is a topic of enormous importance."
[5] "Among several reported catalysts, supported platinum-tin catalysts have been studied in depth since they show relatively high activity and selectivity in the process [811]."
[6] "In general, the catalytic properties of the PtSn catalysts strongly depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state of Sn, and the support effect [12]."
[7] "As regards the role of support, it cannot only modify the selectivity of the process by catalyzing lateral reactions, but also influence the properties of the final metallic phase [13]."
[8] "Moreover, the presence of support has been considered as a vital factor to affect the formation, the distribution and dispersion of active sites on the catalyst [14, 15]."
[9] "Alumina has been used as an adsorbent, catalyst or catalyst support due to its desirable textual properties and surface acid-base properties."
[10] "For instance, -Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst is commonly used in reforming or dehydrogenation process [16]."
[11] "Nevertheless, the reaction performance is still not satisfactory, especially regarding the stability of the catalyst."
[12] "As a consequence, during the process of dehydrogenation reaction, the use of new carrier with distinctive structure and property has received a great deal of attention [17]."
[13] "Compared with the conventional support of -Al2O3, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel, adjusted Si Al ratio and relatively large surface area [18]."
[14] "These properties make ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[15] "For example, Grasselli and his co-workers [19, 20] prepared the ZSM-5 supported PtSn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and achieved a near-equilibrium propene yield of 25% at 550 C."
[16] "To further promote the desired reaction, the introduction of a third metal has been confirmed as an effective method [18, 21, 22]."
[17] "It is believed that the presence of the promoter can improve the reaction selectivity by neutralizing the acidity of the support."
[18] "Meanwhile, due to the specific framework and channel structure, ZSM-5 zeolites can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability [23]."
[19] "Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-15 and mesoporous alumina are often used as the catalyst support to disperse active phase with more active sites."
[20] "Actually, SBA-15 possesses well-ordered pore structure, high thermal stability and high surface area, which are good for uniformly loading the catalytic active component and consequent catalytic reactions."
[21] "On the other hand, as for the mesoporous alumina, it has been suggested that this material simultaneously possesses the characteristics of the alumina and mesoporous materials [12]."
[22] "That is to say, when this material is selected to load Pt and Sn components, the alumina feature of the support may help to stabilize the oxidative state of Sn, while the mesoporous characteristic having a certain pore volume favors the catalytic capacity to accommodate the coke that formed or migrated."
[23] "In addition, the incorporation of some rare earth metals into the alumina matrix may increase the platinum dispersion and decrease the reduction temperature of PtSn species [26]."
[24] "Obviously, different support has its own characteristic and may exhibit the distinctive effect on the catalytic property."
[25] "Therefore, it is necessary to study the influences of the different supports on the catalytic performances for PtSn catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."
[26] "Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the systematic studies on the effect of the different supports have seldom been reported."
[27] "In the present work, a series of PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, ZSM-5, SBA-15) were prepared."
[28] "To obtain information about the changes of catalytic structure and nature of the active sites, the prepared samples were characterized by several techniques, such as XRF, XRD, nitrogen adsorption, TEM, NH3-TPD, TPR, hydrogen chemisorption, H2-TPD, and TPO."
[29] "Particular emphasis was focused on the changes of catalyst acidity and Pt characters, as well as the interaction of Pt with SnOx species."
[30] "All the results were correlated with a corresponding catalytic reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[31] "This can provide us with important information to understand the effect of support with different surface and porous character on supported metallic catalyst."
[32] "2.1. Catalyst preparation The mesoporous alumina (MA) was synthesized by solgel method as described in literature [12, 26] and the -Al2O3 powder was obtained by grinding the commercial alumina spheres."
[33] "Then, the synthesized material together with other porous materials and zeolites of different pore structures (-Al2O3, ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 90), SBA-15) were used as the supports."
[34] "The bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on different support (PtSn/M, M: different supports) were prepared by co-impregnating the supports (M) with excess aqueous solutions of 0.033 M H2PtCl6 and 0.153 M SnCl4."
[35] "Afterward, the prepared samples were dried at 80 °C for 3 h."
[36] "In all cases, the loadings of Pt and Sn were 0.5 and 1.0 wt.%, respectively."
[37] "Then, the samples supported on different supports were pelletized and crushed to 10-12 mesh size."
[38] "After totally dried, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 4 h and dechlorinated at 500 °C for 4 h in air containing steam."
[39] "The metallic contents were obtained by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements on a SWITZERLAND ARL9800 XRF."
[40] "The corresponding designation of the different catalysts is shown in Table 1."

1. Platinum-based catalysts, such as Pt or PtSn, are highly effective in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high activity, selectivity, and ability to interact with the metal oxide components, such as Sn.
