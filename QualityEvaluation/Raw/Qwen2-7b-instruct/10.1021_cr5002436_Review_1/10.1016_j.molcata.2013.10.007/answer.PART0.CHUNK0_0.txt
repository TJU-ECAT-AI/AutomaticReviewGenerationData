[1] "Indeed,propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene,acrolein,polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."
[2] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process,which requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."
[4] "Among several reported catalysts,supported platinumtin catalysts have been studied in depth since they show relatively high activity and selectivity in the process."
[5] "In our experiments,when the used support is mesoporous alumina,most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles can be obtained."
[6] "Furthermore,the presence of this support promotes the occurrence of spillover hydrogen and strengthens the interaction between Sn species and the support."
[7] "Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of -Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke."
[8] "As for the role of support,it cannot only modify the selectivity of the process by catalyzing lateral reactions,but also influence the properties of the final metallic phase."
[9] "That is to say,when this material is selected to load Pt and Sn components,the alumina feature of the support may help to stabilize the oxidative state of Sn,while the mesoporous characteristic having a certain pore volume favors the catalytic capacity to accommodate the coke that formed or migrated."
[10] "The use of new carrier with distinctive structure and property has received a great deal of attention."
[11] "These properties make ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[12] "This can provide us with important information to understand the effect of support with different surface and porous character on supported metallic catalyst."

The literature discusses the comparative study of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on different supports for propane dehydrogenation. Key points include:

1. Propane dehydrogenation is crucial for the production of propene, which is essential for polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid synthesis.
2. The process is endothermic, requiring high temperatures for efficient propene production.
3. Supported platinum-tin catalysts are studied due to their high activity and selectivity in the process.
4. Mesoporous alumina as a support leads to the most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles, enhancing catalytic properties.
5. This support promotes spillover hydrogen occurrence and strengthens the interaction between tin species and the support.
6. Strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induce more cracking reactions, while the porous nature of -Al2O3 increases coke accumulation.
7. Supports influence the selectivity and properties of the final metallic phase, modifying the catalytic process.
8. The alumina feature stabilizes the oxidative state of tin, while the mesoporous characteristic accommodates coke formation.
9. New carriers with distinct structures receive considerable attention.
10. ZSM-5 zeolite is noted for its unique physical properties, making it a promising catalyst carrier in propane dehydrogenation.
11. Understanding the impact of different supports on catalysts provides insights into their effect on supported metallic catalysts' performance.
