[1] "In our experiments,when the used support is mesoporous alumina,most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles can be obtained."
[2] "Furthermore, the presence of this support promotes the occurrence of spillover hydrogen and strengthens the interaction between Sn species and the support."
[3] "As a result, the oxidative state of Sn can be stabilized and the transformation of active sites is promoted, thus improving the catalytic stability and reaction selectivity."
[4] "Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of -Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke."
[5] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

The document discusses the comparative study of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on various supports for propane dehydrogenation. The key findings highlight the influence of support type on the catalyst's structure and performance. The mesoporous alumina support leads to the most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles, promoting spillover hydrogen and stabilizing the oxidative state of tin species, thus enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity. Conversely, the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 and the porous nature of -Al2O3 increase cracking reactions and coke accumulation, respectively. The use of SBA-15 support results in agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, negatively impacting the reaction. The study concludes that the selection of support material significantly affects the catalytic properties of Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts.

本文研究了用于丙烷脱氢的双金属铂锡催化剂在不同支撑物上的比较性研究。关键发现强调了支撑类型对催化剂结构和性能的影响。介孔氧化铝支持导致金属粒子分布最均匀且狭窄，促进溢流氢的产生并稳定锡物种的氧化态，从而提高催化稳定性与选择性。相反，ZSM-5中的强酸位点和-Al2O3的多孔性质增加了裂解反应和焦炭积累。使用SBA-15支持会导致金属颗粒聚集和锡物种的容易还原，这对反应不利。研究得出结论，选择支撑材料显著影响Pt-Sn双金属催化剂的催化性质。
