[1] "The irreversible adsorption of hydrocarbons was determined between 25 and 300C."
[2] "The adsorption data in Figures 2, 3 and 4 for the supported Pt and Pt-Sn samples are corrected for the adsorption on the support."
[3] "In the higher temperature range between 200 and 300C adsorption is characterized by: i) a continuous formation of deposits with lasting exposition to hydrocarbon, ii) a decreasing volatility of the deposits with increasing adsorption temperature."
[4] "The specific tin effect was hardly seen in the n-hexane adsorption (Figure 4)."
[5] "The observed deposit formation with l-hexene displays two characteristic results: i) the coking takes place at a constant rate, i.e., a steady state is reached, ii) during the steady state the free Pt surface area remains constant."
[6] "Consequently coking will be discussed primarily as a function of the metal and not of alumina."

The document discusses the adsorption and coke formation on Pt/Al203 and Pt-Sri/Al203 catalysts for various hydrocarbons such as methane, n-hexane, I-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene. The study reveals that depending on temperature, chemisorption, coke precursor, and coke formation are observed. Coke precursors form on Pt sites and are transferred to alumina. Two routes of coking are observed. Presence of tin decreases the adsorption bond strength of I-hexene and at low concentrations increases the amount chemisorbed. This phenomenon is explained by the ensemble effect. A drain-off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn.

文档讨论了在不同温度下，Pt/Al203和Pt-Sri/Al203催化剂上甲烷、n-己烷、I-己烯和1,5-己二烯等烃类的不可逆吸附和焦炭形成。研究表明，根据温度的不同，化学吸附、焦炭前体和焦炭形成被观察到。焦炭前体在Pt位点形成并转移到氧化铝。发现锡的存在会降低I-己烯的吸附键强度，并且在低浓度时增加化学吸附的数量。这一现象由群体效应解释。提出了一个排水效应来解释添加Sn后金属位点上的焦炭覆盖度下降。
