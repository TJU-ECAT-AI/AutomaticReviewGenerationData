The literature discusses the adsorption and coke formation on Pt/A1203 and Pt-Sri/Al203 catalysts for various hydrocarbons including methane, n-hexane, I-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene. The Pt/A1203 catalyst shows increased adsorption of hydrocarbons, particularly olefins, with temperature. Tin addition affects the adsorption capacity, enhancing it for I-hexene and decreasing it for methane. Coke formation occurs at 450°C from all hydrocarbons on both catalyst types, with coke precursors transferring to the alumina support. Tin decreases the coke coverage on the Pt sites, suggesting a 'drain-off' effect facilitates the mobility of coke precursors. Coke formation mechanisms differ between methane and C6 olefins, involving slow combination of C1 species into graphite-like structures hindered by tin.

文献讨论了在1203和Ti/Sri/Al203催化剂上各种烃类（包括甲烷、n-己烷、i-己烯和1,5-己二烯）的不可逆吸附和焦炭形成。1203上的铂催化剂显示随着温度升高，烃类的吸附量增加，特别是对于烯烃。锡的添加影响吸附能力，增强i-己烯的吸附，并减少甲烷的吸附。在450°C下，所有催化剂上的所有烃类都会发生焦炭形成，焦炭前体转移到氧化铝支持物上。锡减少了Pt位点上的焦炭覆盖，表明“排水”效应促进了焦炭前体的移动。焦炭形成机制在甲烷和C6烯烃之间不同，涉及缓慢组合C1物种成石墨结构，锡阻碍了这一过程。
