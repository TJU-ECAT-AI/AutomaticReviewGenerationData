The study investigates the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as alumina (Al2O3), in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are evaluated within a temperature range from room temperature to 450°C. The research specifically looks at the roles of Pt and the supporting Al2O3, as well as the specific impact of tin addition on the catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. It is found that tin enhancements lead to significant improvements in the catalyst's properties. The study also examines the adsorption of various hydrocarbons, including methane, n-hexane, I-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene, on these catalysts. Tin affects the adsorption of I-hexene by increasing its adsorption at room temperature and decreasing it with increasing temperature, which is explained by an ensemble effect of tin. The research discusses the transfer of coke precursors from Pt sites to acidic sites of alumina and suggests that tin can facilitate this transfer, potentially reducing the coverage of coke on the Pt surface and enhancing the stability against coking. Coking routes are identified, distinguishing between slow processes involving methane and rapid processes involving C6 olefins, with tin inhibiting methane coking and enhancing C6 olefin coking.

该研究探讨了在从室温到450°C的温度范围内，贵金属催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如氧化铝）在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。特别关注了铂和支撑的氧化铝的作用以及添加锡对铂/氧化铝重整催化剂性质的特定影响。研究发现，添加锡可以显著改善催化剂的性能。研究还分析了不同烃类，包括甲烷、己烷、异己烯和1,5-己二烯，在这些催化剂上的吸附情况。锡通过增加室温下异己烯的吸附量并在较高温度下降低其吸附量来影响异己烯的吸附，这可以通过锡的团簇效应来解释。研究讨论了从铂位转移到酸性氧化铝位的焦炭前体的转移过程，并提出锡可能通过减少铂团簇中焦炭前体的吸附强度，促进焦炭前体更易于迁移至氧化铝位形成焦炭，从而减少了铂表面的焦炭覆盖度，提高了催化剂的稳定性。识别了焦炭形成的不同途径，将甲烷的焦炭形成归为缓慢过程，而C6烯烃的焦炭形成则为快速过程，其中锡抑制了甲烷焦炭形成并增强了C6烯烃焦炭形成。
