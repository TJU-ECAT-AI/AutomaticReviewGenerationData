The study focused on comparing the roles of noble metal-based catalysts (specifically Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The research aimed to identify differences between supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. It used methane, n-hexane, I-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene as hydrocarbons to examine the impact of Platinum, the supporting alumina, and the specific role of added tin across a temperature range from room temperature to 450C. Tin was noted to enhance the catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. Adsorption studies were conducted on alumina between 25 and 300C. Carbonaceous deposits formed during the process were referred to as "coke," which remained stable at 480C in vacuum. The study also found that coke formation occurred on the Pt sites but was transferred to the alumina support.

研究主要比较了贵金属基催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的作用。研究旨在找出支持型铂和铂锡复合催化剂之间的差异。研究使用了甲烷、己烷、己烯和1,5-己二烯作为碳氢化合物，以探究铂、支撑氧化铝以及添加锡的具体作用，在从室温到450°C的整个温度范围内进行了实验。锡被发现能显著提高铂/氧化铝重整催化剂的催化性能。在25至300°C的范围内对氧化铝进行了吸附性研究。在过程中形成的碳质沉积物被称为“焦炭”，在480°C的真空条件下保持稳定。研究还发现，焦炭在铂位上形成，但随后转移到了氧化铝支持物上。
