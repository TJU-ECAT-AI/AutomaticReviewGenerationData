The study focused on comparing the roles of noble metal-based catalysts (specifically Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The research aimed to identify differences between supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. It used methane, n-hexane, I-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene as hydrocarbons to examine the impact of Platinum, the supporting alumina, and the specific role of added tin across a temperature range from room temperature to 450C. Tin was noted to enhance the catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. Adsorption studies were conducted on alumina between 25 and 300C. Carbonaceous deposits formed during the process were referred to as "coke," which remained stable at 480C in vacuum. The study also found that coke formation occurred on the Pt sites but was transferred to the alumina support.

研究主要比较了贵金属基催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的作用。研究旨在找出支持型铂和铂锡复合催化剂之间的差异。研究使用了甲烷、己烷、己烯和1,5-己二烯作为碳氢化合物，以探究铂、支撑氧化铝以及添加锡的具体作用，在从室温到450°C的整个温度范围内进行了实验。锡被发现能显著提高铂/氧化铝重整催化剂的催化性能。在25至300°C的范围内对氧化铝进行了吸附性研究。在过程中形成的碳质沉积物被称为“焦炭”，在480°C的真空条件下保持稳定。研究还发现，焦炭在铂位上形成，但随后转移到了氧化铝支持物上。

[2] "The adsorption data in Figures 2, 3 and 4 for the supported Pt and Pt-Sn samples are corrected for the adsorption on the support."
[3] "In the higher temperature range between 200 and 300C adsorption is characterized by: i) a continuous formation of deposits with lasting exposition to hydrocarbon, ii) a decreasing volatility of the deposits with increasing adsorption temperature."
[4] "The specific tin effect was hardly seen in the n-hexane adsorption (Figure 4)."
[5] "The observed deposit formation with l-hexene displays two characteristic results: i) the coking takes place at a constant rate, i.e., a steady state is reached, ii) during the steady state the free Pt surface area remains constant."

The document discusses the adsorption and coke formation on Pt/Al203 and Pt-Sri/Al203 catalysts for various hydrocarbons such as methane, n-hexane, I-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene. The study reveals that depending on temperature, chemisorption, coke precursor, and coke formation are observed. Coke precursors form on Pt sites and are transferred to alumina. Two routes of coking are observed. Presence of tin decreases the adsorption bond strength of I-hexene and at low concentrations increases the amount chemisorbed. This phenomenon is explained by the ensemble effect. A drain-off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn.

The study investigates the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as alumina (Al2O3), in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are evaluated within a temperature range from room temperature to 450°C. The research specifically looks at the roles of Pt and the supporting Al2O3, as well as the specific impact of tin addition on the catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. It is found that tin enhancements lead to significant improvements in the catalyst's properties. The study also examines the adsorption of various hydrocarbons, including methane, n-hexane, I-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene, on these catalysts. Tin affects the adsorption of I-hexene by increasing its adsorption at room temperature and decreasing it with increasing temperature, which is explained by an ensemble effect of tin. The research discusses the transfer of coke precursors from Pt sites to acidic sites of alumina and suggests that tin can facilitate this transfer, potentially reducing the coverage of coke on the Pt surface and enhancing the stability against coking. Coking routes are identified, distinguishing between slow processes involving methane and rapid processes involving C6 olefins, with tin inhibiting methane coking and enhancing C6 olefin coking.

该研究探讨了在从室温到450°C的温度范围内，贵金属催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如氧化铝）在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。特别关注了铂和支撑的氧化铝的作用以及添加锡对铂/氧化铝重整催化剂性质的特定影响。研究发现，添加锡可以显著改善催化剂的性能。研究还分析了不同烃类，包括甲烷、己烷、异己烯和1,5-己二烯，在这些催化剂上的吸附情况。锡通过增加室温下异己烯的吸附量并在较高温度下降低其吸附量来影响异己烯的吸附，这可以通过锡的团簇效应来解释。研究讨论了从铂位转移到酸性氧化铝位的焦炭前体的转移过程，并提出锡可能通过减少铂团簇中焦炭前体的吸附强度，促进焦炭前体更易于迁移至氧化铝位形成焦炭，从而减少了铂表面的焦炭覆盖度，提高了催化剂的稳定性。识别了焦炭形成的不同途径，将甲烷的焦炭形成归为缓慢过程，而C6烯烃的焦炭形成则为快速过程，其中锡抑制了甲烷焦炭形成并增强了C6烯烃焦炭形成。

1. The study investigates the adsorption and coke formation from hydrocarbons such as methane, n-hexane, I-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene on Pt/Al203 and Pt-Sn/Al203 catalysts. The adsorption properties are influenced by temperature, and coke formation is observed. Tin addition affects the adsorption of I-hexene and coke formation.

2. The adsorption of hydrocarbons on Pt/A1203 increases with temperature, particularly between 200 and 300°C. In contrast, adsorption on the support alumina decreases with temperature.

3. The adsorption of I-hexene on Pt-Sn/Al203 shows a temperature-dependent behavior. At room temperature, the adsorption is increased, but towards higher temperatures up to about 200°C, the adsorption decreases compared to the Pt-only sample.

4. Tin addition influences coke formation on Pt-Sn/Al203 catalysts. Coke formation from methane is suppressed, while coke formation from I-hexene is enhanced. The coke formation rates and coverage differ between Pt-only and Pt-Sn samples.

1. 研究了在25至300°C范围内几种烃类物质在Pt/Al203和Pt-Sn/Al203催化剂上的不可逆吸附。结果表明，吸附特性受温度影响，并观察到了焦炭形成。锡的添加影响了I-己烯的吸附和焦炭形成。

2. 在Pt/A1203上，随着温度升高，烃类物质的吸附量增加，尤其是在200至300°C之间。相比之下，支持物氧化铝上的吸附量随温度降低。

3. Pt-Sn/Al203上的I-己烯吸附表现出温度依赖性。室温时，吸附量增加，但当温度升高到约200°C时，与仅含Pt的样品相比，吸附量减少。

4. 锡的添加影响了Pt-Sn/Al203催化剂上的焦炭形成。从甲烷中形成焦炭被抑制，而从I-己烯中形成焦炭增强。Pt-Sn样品与仅含Pt的样品之间的焦炭形成速率和覆盖率不同。

The literature discusses the adsorption and coke formation on Pt/A1203 and Pt-Sri/Al203 catalysts for various hydrocarbons including methane, n-hexane, I-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene. The Pt/A1203 catalyst shows increased adsorption of hydrocarbons, particularly olefins, with temperature. Tin addition affects the adsorption capacity, enhancing it for I-hexene and decreasing it for methane. Coke formation occurs at 450°C from all hydrocarbons on both catalyst types, with coke precursors transferring to the alumina support. Tin decreases the coke coverage on the Pt sites, suggesting a 'drain-off' effect facilitates the mobility of coke precursors. Coke formation mechanisms differ between methane and C6 olefins, involving slow combination of C1 species into graphite-like structures hindered by tin.

文献讨论了在1203和Ti/Sri/Al203催化剂上各种烃类（包括甲烷、n-己烷、i-己烯和1,5-己二烯）的不可逆吸附和焦炭形成。1203上的铂催化剂显示随着温度升高，烃类的吸附量增加，特别是对于烯烃。锡的添加影响吸附能力，增强i-己烯的吸附，并减少甲烷的吸附。在450°C下，所有催化剂上的所有烃类都会发生焦炭形成，焦炭前体转移到氧化铝支持物上。锡减少了Pt位点上的焦炭覆盖，表明“排水”效应促进了焦炭前体的移动。焦炭形成机制在甲烷和C6烯烃之间不同，涉及缓慢组合C1物种成石墨结构，锡阻碍了这一过程。
