[1] "The irreversible adsorption of several hydrocarbons was determined between 25 and 300C. The results of the adsorption on alumina can be seen in Figure 1."
[2] "Contrary to the adsorption on the support, the adsorption on Pt/A1203 increases with increasing temperature, especially between 200 and 300C."
[3] "The I-hexene adsorption is influenced by tin in the following way: i) at room temperature the adsorption is increased. ii) towards higher temperatures up to about 200C the adsorption decreases, whereas on the Pt sample the adsorption increases."
[4] "Coke formation on Pt-Sn/A1203 from methane and I-hexene is compared."

1. The study investigates the adsorption and coke formation from hydrocarbons such as methane, n-hexane, I-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene on Pt/Al203 and Pt-Sn/Al203 catalysts. The adsorption properties are influenced by temperature, and coke formation is observed. Tin addition affects the adsorption of I-hexene and coke formation.

2. The adsorption of hydrocarbons on Pt/A1203 increases with temperature, particularly between 200 and 300°C. In contrast, adsorption on the support alumina decreases with temperature.

3. The adsorption of I-hexene on Pt-Sn/Al203 shows a temperature-dependent behavior. At room temperature, the adsorption is increased, but towards higher temperatures up to about 200°C, the adsorption decreases compared to the Pt-only sample.

4. Tin addition influences coke formation on Pt-Sn/Al203 catalysts. Coke formation from methane is suppressed, while coke formation from I-hexene is enhanced. The coke formation rates and coverage differ between Pt-only and Pt-Sn samples.

1. 研究了在25至300°C范围内几种烃类物质在Pt/Al203和Pt-Sn/Al203催化剂上的不可逆吸附。结果表明，吸附特性受温度影响，并观察到了焦炭形成。锡的添加影响了I-己烯的吸附和焦炭形成。

2. 在Pt/A1203上，随着温度升高，烃类物质的吸附量增加，尤其是在200至300°C之间。相比之下，支持物氧化铝上的吸附量随温度降低。

3. Pt-Sn/Al203上的I-己烯吸附表现出温度依赖性。室温时，吸附量增加，但当温度升高到约200°C时，与仅含Pt的样品相比，吸附量减少。

4. 锡的添加影响了Pt-Sn/Al203催化剂上的焦炭形成。从甲烷中形成焦炭被抑制，而从I-己烯中形成焦炭增强。Pt-Sn样品与仅含Pt的样品之间的焦炭形成速率和覆盖率不同。
