[4] "The ethane-ethylene equilibrium has been determined di- rectly by Pease (Id). Ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen unite to form ethane."

[5] "It is also possible to determine equilibrium constants or free energy change for the dissocia- tion of paraffins by calculation from thermal data (4,10,17),but the possibility of appreciable errors arising from small errors in heats of combustion has been recognized, and the direct deter- mination is accordingly desir- able particularly for compar- ing the stabilities of isomeric olefins."

Comparison and Contrast between Noble Metal-Based Catalysts and Metal Oxide-Based Catalysts in Non-Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Light Olefins:

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, play significant roles in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. 

Platinum-based catalysts are known for their efficiency and selectivity in converting paraffins to olefins and hydrogen, particularly at elevated temperatures where dehydrogenation reactions are thermodynamically possible. However, they can lose activity at higher temperatures, as noted in the text.

On the other hand, metal oxide-based catalysts offer alternative options for dehydrogenation processes. Chromium oxide (CrOx), along with other metal oxides, can participate in complex reactions at moderate temperatures, as suggested in the document. They might be more resistant to the side reactions observed in the presence of noble metals, such as the formation of methane from isobutane, as mentioned.

Industrial applications of these catalysts typically depend on the specific properties of the olefin, the desired products, and the temperature conditions. Noble metals tend to be more selective but less stable at high temperatures, while metal oxides might offer better stability but potentially lower selectivity.

Recent developments in the field aim to improve the stability, selectivity, and activity of catalysts, including the optimization of metal oxide compositions and the incorporation of noble metals in mixed-metal catalyst systems. These advancements aim to enhance the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes and reduce unwanted side reactions.

Advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include their high activity and selectivity, making them suitable for processes requiring high conversion rates and purity of products. However, they can be expensive and may require careful temperature control to maintain their performance. Metal oxide-based catalysts, while potentially offering cost-effectiveness and improved stability, might compromise on selectivity compared to noble metal catalysts.

In summary, the choice between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins depends on factors such as the desired product profile, process conditions, cost considerations, and the need for high selectivity versus stability.

非氧化脱氢化轻烯烃时，贵金属基催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）扮演着重要角色。

贵金属基催化剂，尤其是铂，在适当的温度下，可以有效地将烷烃转化为烯烃和氢气。然而，在较高的温度下，它们的活性可能会降低，如文档中所述。

相比之下，金属氧化物基催化剂提供了脱氢化过程的替代选项。例如，铬酸盐（CrOx）以及其他金属氧化物可以在适中的温度下参与复杂的反应，如文档中所暗示的。它们可能比含有贵金属的催化剂更耐受副反应，如从异丁烷中形成甲烷的情况。

这些催化剂在工业应用中的具体使用取决于特定的烯烃性质、所需产物以及操作条件。贵金属通常因其高活性和选择性而被选择，但它们在高温下的稳定性较低。金属氧化物催化剂可能提供更好的稳定性，但可能牺牲一定的选择性。

近年来，催化剂领域的发展目标是改进催化剂的稳定性和活性，包括优化金属氧化物的组成以及将贵金属整合到混合金属催化剂系统中。这些进步旨在提高脱氢化过程的效率并减少不必要的副反应。

贵金属基催化剂的优势在于其高活性和选择性，使其适合需要高转化率和产品纯度的过程。然而，它们可能成本较高，并且需要仔细控制温度以维持性能。金属氧化物基催化剂可能在成本效益和稳定性方面提供优势，尽管它们的选择性可能与贵金属催化剂相比有所妥协。

总之，选择贵金属基或金属氧化物基催化剂进行轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢化取决于因素如所需产物轮廓、操作条件、成本考虑以及高选择性与稳定性的需求之间的权衡。

1. Noble metal-based catalysts such as platinum, cobalt, nickel, copper, iron, silver, and palladium are effective for dehydrogenating paraffins into olefins at moderate temperatures. However, at higher temperatures, copper loses its activity, while platinum, palladium, and other noble metals can cause complex decompositions. 

2. A catalyst prepared from chromic oxide gel can induce the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into their corresponding olefins at temperatures between 350°C to 500°C, with minimal side reactions occurring under proper conditions.

3. The direct equilibrium measurement of the ethane-ethylene reaction was conducted by Pease, revealing that ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen at temperatures between 600°C to 700°C in the absence of a catalyst, forming ethylene and hydrogen without significant side reactions.

4. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene occurs with a lower free energy change compared to other processes, mainly due to the increased stability of the ethylene molecule resulting from the presence of a methyl substituent.

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, including platinum, are effective in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are less effective. Noble metals retain their activity better at high temperatures compared to metal oxides. They are used in industries for refining and petrochemical processes. Recent developments focus on improving the stability and selectivity of catalysts, especially for the production of high-quality olefins. Potential advantages include higher efficiency and lower energy consumption.

2. The potential difference set up between a bed of activated carbon and the metallic water-purification equipment is relatively high. This behavior is unique to activated carbon and is not observed with other carbons used in water purification. A dielectric lining is provided to prevent damage to the carbon, contamination of the water, and eventual destruction of the metallic equipment. There is a possibility that the potential difference could be related to the activity of carbons in some types of adsorption phenomena.

3. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene involves a lower free energy change compared to other paraffins. This is likely due to the increase in stability of the ethylene molecule caused by the methyl group substitution.

4. When isobutane undergoes dehydrogenation, no n-butene is formed, indicating that no rearrangement takes place. This suggests that the process is more complex for heavier paraffins.

5. In experiment 3, the produced butenes from isobutane showed a composition where the id gas contained hydrogen at 9.7%, propylene at 9.1%, and propane at 81.2%. This indicates the extent of dehydrogenation and the formation of hydrogen and propylene alongside the butane.

2. 活性炭与水净化设备中的金属之间的电位差相对较高。这种行为仅在活性炭中观察到，并且与其他用于水净化的碳不相同。提供绝缘层以防止对碳的损害、水污染以及最终破坏金属设备。有可能潜在的电位差与碳在某些吸附现象中的活性有关。

3. 丙烷转化为丙烯的过程涉及到较低的自由能变化，这可能是由于甲基团取代导致乙烯分子稳定性增加造成的。

4. 当异丁烷进行脱氢化时，没有生成正丁烯，表明没有发生重排。这表明更重的烷烃的过程更为复杂。

5. 在实验3中，异丁烷产生的丁烯组成显示id气体中含有氢9.7%，丙烯9.1%，以及丙烷81.2%。这表明脱氢化程度以及氢和丙烯的形成，同时伴随着丁烷。

1. The equilibrium constants for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reaction were determined for ethane at 400, 450", and 500" C., and for propane, isobutane, and n-butane at 350", 400, and 450" C. The dehydrogenation of isobutane did not form n-butene, suggesting no rearrangement occurred. In contrast, n-butane dehydrogenation produced all three known isomers: I-butene, n's-2-butene, and trans-2-butene. The stability of the ethylene molecule increased due to the methyl group substitution, leading to a somewhat lower free energy change in propane dehydrogenation compared to propylene. As molecular weight increases, the number of independent dehydrogenation reactions a paraffin can undergo increases, consequently increasing the extent of dissociation.
