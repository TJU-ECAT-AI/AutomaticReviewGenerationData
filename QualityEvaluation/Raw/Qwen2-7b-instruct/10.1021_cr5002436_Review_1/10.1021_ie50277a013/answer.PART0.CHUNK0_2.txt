1. Noble metal-based catalysts, including platinum, are effective in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are less effective. Noble metals retain their activity better at high temperatures compared to metal oxides. They are used in industries for refining and petrochemical processes. Recent developments focus on improving the stability and selectivity of catalysts, especially for the production of high-quality olefins. Potential advantages include higher efficiency and lower energy consumption.

2. The potential difference set up between a bed of activated carbon and the metallic water-purification equipment is relatively high. This behavior is unique to activated carbon and is not observed with other carbons used in water purification. A dielectric lining is provided to prevent damage to the carbon, contamination of the water, and eventual destruction of the metallic equipment. There is a possibility that the potential difference could be related to the activity of carbons in some types of adsorption phenomena.

3. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene involves a lower free energy change compared to other paraffins. This is likely due to the increase in stability of the ethylene molecule caused by the methyl group substitution.

4. When isobutane undergoes dehydrogenation, no n-butene is formed, indicating that no rearrangement takes place. This suggests that the process is more complex for heavier paraffins.

5. In experiment 3, the produced butenes from isobutane showed a composition where the id gas contained hydrogen at 9.7%, propylene at 9.1%, and propane at 81.2%. This indicates the extent of dehydrogenation and the formation of hydrogen and propylene alongside the butane.

1. 贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，对于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢反应非常有效，而金属氧化物催化剂如铬氧化物（CrOx）、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物的效果较差。贵金属在高温下的活性保持更好，与金属氧化物相比。它们被用于工业领域进行精炼和石油化学过程。最近的发展集中在提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性，特别是为了生产高质量烯烃。潜在优势包括更高的效率和更低的能量消耗。

2. 活性炭与水净化设备中的金属之间的电位差相对较高。这种行为仅在活性炭中观察到，并且与其他用于水净化的碳不相同。提供绝缘层以防止对碳的损害、水污染以及最终破坏金属设备。有可能潜在的电位差与碳在某些吸附现象中的活性有关。

3. 丙烷转化为丙烯的过程涉及到较低的自由能变化，这可能是由于甲基团取代导致乙烯分子稳定性增加造成的。

4. 当异丁烷进行脱氢化时，没有生成正丁烯，表明没有发生重排。这表明更重的烷烃的过程更为复杂。

5. 在实验3中，异丁烷产生的丁烯组成显示id气体中含有氢9.7%，丙烯9.1%，以及丙烷81.2%。这表明脱氢化程度以及氢和丙烯的形成，同时伴随着丁烷。
