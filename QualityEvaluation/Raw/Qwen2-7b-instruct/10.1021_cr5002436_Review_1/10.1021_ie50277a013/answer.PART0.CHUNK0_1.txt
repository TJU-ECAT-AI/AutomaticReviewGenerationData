[1] "Dehydrogenation of paraf- fins from the corre-
sponding olefins by com- bination with hydrogen has been shown to take place readily at moderate temperature in the presence of suitable catalysts,such as cobalt, nickel, copper,iron, silver, platinum, and palla- dium (1 3)- The dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins and hydrogen,however, is t h e r m o d y n a m i - cally possible only at somewhat elevated temper a t ur es . At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, plati- num, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3)."

[2] "In the course of a study of catalytic reactions of hydrocar- bons, a catalyst was prepared from chromic oxide gel which brought about the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into the corresponding olefins at 350" to 500" C. Side reactions were not marked under proper conditions, and hydrogenation as well as dehydrogenation took place without serious com- plications."

[3] "The ethane-ethylene equilibrium has been determined di- rectly by Pease (Id). Ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen unite to form ethane at 600" to 700" C. in the absence of a catalyst and without ex- cessive side reaction; satisfactory equilibrium values are ob- tained by approaching equilibrium from both sides at these temperatures."

[4] "In the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene a somewhat lower free energy change takes place (Table IV). This appears to be due mostly to an increase in stability of the ethylene molecule caused by the substituent methyl group."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts such as platinum, cobalt, nickel, copper, iron, silver, and palladium are effective for dehydrogenating paraffins into olefins at moderate temperatures. However, at higher temperatures, copper loses its activity, while platinum, palladium, and other noble metals can cause complex decompositions. 

2. A catalyst prepared from chromic oxide gel can induce the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into their corresponding olefins at temperatures between 350°C to 500°C, with minimal side reactions occurring under proper conditions.

3. The direct equilibrium measurement of the ethane-ethylene reaction was conducted by Pease, revealing that ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen at temperatures between 600°C to 700°C in the absence of a catalyst, forming ethylene and hydrogen without significant side reactions.

4. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene occurs with a lower free energy change compared to other processes, mainly due to the increased stability of the ethylene molecule resulting from the presence of a methyl substituent.

1. 铂、钴、镍、铜、铁、银和钯等贵金属催化剂在适中的温度下可以有效地将烷烃转化为烯烃。然而，在较高温度下，铜会失去活性，而铂、钯和其他贵金属可能会导致复杂的分解。

2. 从铬酸盐凝胶制备的催化剂可以在350°C到500°C的温度下诱导简单烷烃转化为相应的烯烃，且在适当条件下，副反应较少发生。

3. Pease直接测量了乙烷乙烯平衡，发现乙烷在600°C至700°C的温度下分解为乙烯和氢气，并与氢气结合形成乙烷，这一过程在没有催化剂的情况下进行，且无显著的副反应发生。

4. 烷丙烷转化为丙烯的过程伴随着较低的自由能变化，主要原因是由于甲基取代基的存在，使得乙烯分子的稳定性增加。
