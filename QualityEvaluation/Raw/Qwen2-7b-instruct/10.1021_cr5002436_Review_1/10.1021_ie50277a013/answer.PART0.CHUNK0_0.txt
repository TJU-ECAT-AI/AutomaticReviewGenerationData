[1] "The formation of paraf- fins from the corresponding olefins by com- bination with hydrogen has been shown to take place readily at moderate temperature in the presence of suitable catalysts,such as cobalt, nickel, copper,iron, silver, platinum, and palla- dium (1 3)- The dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins and hydrogen,however, is t h e r m o d y n a m i - cally possible only at somewhat elevated temper a t ur es . At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, plati- num, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3)."

[2] "Side reactions were most marked in the case of isobutane,t h e  f o r m a t i o n  of methane leading to a de- ficiency in molecular hydrogen."

[3] "Ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen unite to form ethane at 600" to 700" C. in the absence of a catalyst and without ex- cessive side reaction; satisfactory equilibrium values are ob- tained by approaching equilibrium from both sides at these temperatures."

[4] "The ethane-ethylene equilibrium has been determined di- rectly by Pease (Id). Ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen unite to form ethane."

[5] "It is also possible to determine equilibrium constants or free energy change for the dissocia- tion of paraffins by calculation from thermal data (4,10,17),but the possibility of appreciable errors arising from small errors in heats of combustion has been recognized, and the direct deter- mination is accordingly desir- able particularly for compar- ing the stabilities of isomeric olefins."

Comparison and Contrast between Noble Metal-Based Catalysts and Metal Oxide-Based Catalysts in Non-Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Light Olefins:

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, play significant roles in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. 

Platinum-based catalysts are known for their efficiency and selectivity in converting paraffins to olefins and hydrogen, particularly at elevated temperatures where dehydrogenation reactions are thermodynamically possible. However, they can lose activity at higher temperatures, as noted in the text.

On the other hand, metal oxide-based catalysts offer alternative options for dehydrogenation processes. Chromium oxide (CrOx), along with other metal oxides, can participate in complex reactions at moderate temperatures, as suggested in the document. They might be more resistant to the side reactions observed in the presence of noble metals, such as the formation of methane from isobutane, as mentioned.

Industrial applications of these catalysts typically depend on the specific properties of the olefin, the desired products, and the temperature conditions. Noble metals tend to be more selective but less stable at high temperatures, while metal oxides might offer better stability but potentially lower selectivity.

Recent developments in the field aim to improve the stability, selectivity, and activity of catalysts, including the optimization of metal oxide compositions and the incorporation of noble metals in mixed-metal catalyst systems. These advancements aim to enhance the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes and reduce unwanted side reactions.

Advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include their high activity and selectivity, making them suitable for processes requiring high conversion rates and purity of products. However, they can be expensive and may require careful temperature control to maintain their performance. Metal oxide-based catalysts, while potentially offering cost-effectiveness and improved stability, might compromise on selectivity compared to noble metal catalysts.

In summary, the choice between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins depends on factors such as the desired product profile, process conditions, cost considerations, and the need for high selectivity versus stability.

非氧化脱氢化轻烯烃时，贵金属基催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）扮演着重要角色。

贵金属基催化剂，尤其是铂，在适当的温度下，可以有效地将烷烃转化为烯烃和氢气。然而，在较高的温度下，它们的活性可能会降低，如文档中所述。

相比之下，金属氧化物基催化剂提供了脱氢化过程的替代选项。例如，铬酸盐（CrOx）以及其他金属氧化物可以在适中的温度下参与复杂的反应，如文档中所暗示的。它们可能比含有贵金属的催化剂更耐受副反应，如从异丁烷中形成甲烷的情况。

这些催化剂在工业应用中的具体使用取决于特定的烯烃性质、所需产物以及操作条件。贵金属通常因其高活性和选择性而被选择，但它们在高温下的稳定性较低。金属氧化物催化剂可能提供更好的稳定性，但可能牺牲一定的选择性。

近年来，催化剂领域的发展目标是改进催化剂的稳定性和活性，包括优化金属氧化物的组成以及将贵金属整合到混合金属催化剂系统中。这些进步旨在提高脱氢化过程的效率并减少不必要的副反应。

贵金属基催化剂的优势在于其高活性和选择性，使其适合需要高转化率和产品纯度的过程。然而，它们可能成本较高，并且需要仔细控制温度以维持性能。金属氧化物基催化剂可能在成本效益和稳定性方面提供优势，尽管它们的选择性可能与贵金属催化剂相比有所妥协。

总之，选择贵金属基或金属氧化物基催化剂进行轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢化取决于因素如所需产物轮廓、操作条件、成本考虑以及高选择性与稳定性的需求之间的权衡。
