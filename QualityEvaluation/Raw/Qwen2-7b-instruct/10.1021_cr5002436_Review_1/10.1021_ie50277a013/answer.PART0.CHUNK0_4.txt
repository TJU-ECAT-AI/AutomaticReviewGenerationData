[7] "Ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen unite to form ethane at 600" to 700" C. in the absence of a catalyst and without ex- cessive side reaction; satisfactory equilibrium values are ob- tained by approaching equilibrium from both sides at these temperatures."
[8] "This method of calculation may involve large errors in AH and AF at 298" K., but the error in AF is probably in no case more thah several hundred calories at temperatures of 573 " to 873" K. (300' to 600" C.) where these reactions are of im- portance."
