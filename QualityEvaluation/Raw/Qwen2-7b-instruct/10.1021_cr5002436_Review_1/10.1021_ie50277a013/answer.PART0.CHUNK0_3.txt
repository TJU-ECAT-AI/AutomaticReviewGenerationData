[1] "Equilibrium constants for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reaction were determined for ethane at 400, 450", and 500" C., and for propane, isobutane, and n-butane at 350", 400, and 450" C."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation of isobutane, no n-butene was formed, and evidently no rearrangement took place."
[3] "In the dehydrogenation of n-butane, all three of the known isomers-I-butene, n's-2-butene1 and trans-2-butene-were formed."
[4] "This appears to be due mostly to an increase in stability of the ethylene molecule caused by the substituent methyl group."
[5] "In the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene a somewhat lower free energy change takes place (Table IV)."
[6] "In addition, the increasing number of independent dehydrogenation reactions which a paraffin can undergo increases with molecular weight, and the extent to which the paraffin dissociates should increase accordingly."

1. The equilibrium constants for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reaction were determined for ethane at 400, 450", and 500" C., and for propane, isobutane, and n-butane at 350", 400, and 450" C. The dehydrogenation of isobutane did not form n-butene, suggesting no rearrangement occurred. In contrast, n-butane dehydrogenation produced all three known isomers: I-butene, n's-2-butene, and trans-2-butene. The stability of the ethylene molecule increased due to the methyl group substitution, leading to a somewhat lower free energy change in propane dehydrogenation compared to propylene. As molecular weight increases, the number of independent dehydrogenation reactions a paraffin can undergo increases, consequently increasing the extent of dissociation.

1. 对于乙烷，在400、450"和500" C下，以及丙烷、异丁烷和正丁烷在350、400和450" C下确定了氢化-脱氢反应的平衡常数。异丁烷的脱氢未形成正丁烯，表明没有发生重排。相反，正丁烷脱氢产生了所有三个已知异构体：1-丁烯、n's-2-丁烯和反式-2-丁烯。由于甲基基团的取代导致乙烯分子稳定性增加，丙烷脱氢时的自由能变化略有降低与丙烯相比。随着分子量的增加，烷烃可以进行的独立脱氢反应的数量增加，因此烷烃的解离程度相应增加。
