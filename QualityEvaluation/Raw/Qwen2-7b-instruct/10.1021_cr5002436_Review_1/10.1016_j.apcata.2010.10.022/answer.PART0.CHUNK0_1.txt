[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane using an equimolar mixture of propane-d0 and propane-d8 was investigated over 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2 at atmospheric pressure and different reaction temperatures."
[2] "Unlike the case of hexane aromatization, the unique structure of L-zeolite does not help in controlling the entry of propane molecules into the lobes of the L-zeolite containing the active sites; hence, bimolecular reactions do occur, leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Since Pt supported on L-zeolite is reported to be a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes [6,17,18], it is important to investigate if the unique structure of L-zeolite can play a role in those Pt-catalyzed reactions as well."

In the study, the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt/KL and Pt/SiO2 catalysts was investigated. The unique structure of L-zeolite was found not to effectively control the entry of propane molecules into the active sites, resulting in bimolecular reactions and catalyst deactivation. This finding is crucial as Pt supported on L-zeolite is known to be a promising catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation, highlighting the importance of understanding its role in such reactions.
