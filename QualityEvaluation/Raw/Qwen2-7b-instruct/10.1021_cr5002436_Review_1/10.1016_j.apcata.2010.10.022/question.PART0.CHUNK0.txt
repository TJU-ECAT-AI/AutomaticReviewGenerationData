A normal kinetic isotope effect exists (kH/kD = 1.41.5) when the reaction is conducted on Pt/KL at different temperatures (400, 500, and 600 C), suggesting that CH bond activation is involved in the kinetically relevant steps.
Furtheremore, there is hardly any HD exchange in the recovered propane during dehydrogenation at temperatures above 400 C, suggesting that adsorption and subsequent dehydrogenation of propane are essentially irreversible and that CH bond activation is the rate determining step. Unlike the case of hexane aromatization, the unique structure of L-zeolite does not help in controlling the entry of propane molecules into the lobes of the L-zeolite containing the active sites; hence, bimolecular reactions do occur, leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an important reac- tion, since propylene is a vital feedstock in the petrochemical industry. The majority of propylene is produced as a by-product from processes such as steam cracking of naphtha and fluid cat- alytic cracking (FCC) [1]. However, due to increased global demand,several new plants for the dehydrogenation of propane to propy- lene have been built worldwide [1]. Dehydrogenation of propane is a highly endothermic reaction favored by high temperatures and low hydrogen partial pressures. Typically, PtSn supported on alu- mina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are the commercial catalysts for this reaction [1,2]. A variety of Pt catalysts, often pro- moted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y- zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst.
Over Pt, alkane dehydrogenation requires elementary steps including activation of the CH bond and elimination of the hydro- gen formed. Due to the lower reactivity of the CD bond relative Corresponding author. Tel.: +1 859 257 0253; fax: +1 859 257 0302.

Davis). to CH in alkanes, isotopic switching can be used to determine if a normal kinetic isotope effect (NKIE) exists which would suggest CH bond breaking as the rate limiting step among the elemen- tary steps. Furthermore, the degree of HD scrambling in the recovered-unreacted alkanes [1013] provides important informa- tion regarding the extent of reaction of the alkane reactant with the surface hydrogen pool. Jackson et al. [14] studied the dehydro- genation of propane using a C3H8/C3D8 mixture on chromia and found an NKIE of 1.85; thus, CH bond activation was identified to be the rate determining step. Biscardi and Iglesia [15] investi- gated the elementary reaction steps of propane dehydrogenation over H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts using an equimolar mix- ture of C3H8/C3D8. At a temperature of 500 C, an NKIE of 1.03 and 1.2 for H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5, respectively, were reported and significant HD cross-exchange between C3H8 and C3D8 in the recovered propane was observed. Therefore, they [15] concluded that the CH bond activation step does not limit the overall dehy- drogenation rate and HD exchange is strongly influenced by the Bronsted acid sites on those catalysts. Recently, we [16] have found using isotope labeling that the unique structure of L-zeolite plays a significant role in controlling the entry of hexane molecules into the wider lobes of L-zeolite containing the Pt active sites during the dehydrocyclization reaction; in that case, the catalyst was pre- pared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of Pt(AcAc)2 to ensure that ultra-small Pt clusters were formed, situated inside the uni- 0926-860X/$  see front matter  2010 Elsevier B.V.

265 axial channels and with a majority nestled within the wider lobes.
Because of this unique property, the catalyst exhibited unparalleled stability for hexane aromatization, as bimolecular reactions leading to coking were avoided [15,16]. Since Pt supported on L-zeolite is reported to be a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alka- nes to alkenes [6,17,18], it is important to investigate if the unique structure of L-zeolite can play a role in those Pt-catalyzed reac- tions as well. Using propane as the reactant, the aim of this study is to determine if an NKIE exists and to investigate the extent to which intracrystalline diffusion plays a role in the dehydrogenation of lighter alkanes; this is accomplished by carrying out experiments using an equimolar ratio of C3H8 and C3D8 in the feed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A sample of potassium exchanged zeolite LTL (Sd-Chemie) was calcined in flowing air (100 cm3/min) at 400 C for 4 h. After cool- ing to ambient temperature, the calcined zeolite LTL powder was transferred to a glove bag filled with inert gas and carefully mixed with platinum acetylacetonate (Alfa Aesar); the material was then loaded into a sublimation tube, which was sealed at one end. The other end was attached to a high vacuum system, equipped with an oil diffusion pump and capable of achieving a vacuum of <106 Torr.The sublimation tube was held at room temperature for 4 h, and then the temperature was slowly ramped (1 C/min) to 70, 80, 90,and then 100 C, holding at each temperature for 1 h. Finally, the temperature was ramped to 130 C, held for 15 min, and cooled to room temperature. Following the CVD procedure, the sample was light yellow in color. To decompose the Pt(AcAc)2 compound, the catalyst was calcined at 350 C in flowing air for 4 h. The final cata- lyst was light gray in color. The loading was 1%Pt by weight. Various sublimation methods for obtaining highly dispersed Pt/KL catalysts can be found in the literature [1622].The Pt/SiO2 catalyst was prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method. Silica (The PQ Corporation, CS-2133) was used as the catalyst support. In this method, IWI of the sup- port was performed with the Pt salt, tetraamineplatinum (II) nitrate (Alfa, Stock #88960, Lot #A29T027). The loading solution volume was determined based on the average pore volume of silica used.After impregnation, the sample was dried for 6 h at 110 C and sub- sequently calcined in stagnant air at 350 C (ramp of 3 C/min) for 4 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Hydrogen chemisorption by a temperature programmed des- orption (TPD) method was carried out using a Zeton-Altamira AMI-200 unit. The catalyst was slowly heated (1 C/min) to either 450, 500 or 600 C in 30 cm3/min of a 33%H2/Ar mixture, and held at 450, 500 or 600 C for 1 h. The catalyst was then cooled in flowing hydrogen to 80 C, and purged with 25 cm3/min of flowing argon to remove weakly bound hydrogen. The catalyst was then heated in 25 cm3/min of flowing argon to 450, 500 or 600 C to desorb the hydrogen, and the evolved hydrogen was monitored using a ther- mal conductivity detector (TCD). To calibrate the signal, 10 pulses of standard amounts of hydrogen were passed into a flowing argon stream.
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) spectra were recorded using a Nicolet Nexus 870 spectrometer equipped with a DTGS-TEC detector. A Thermo Spectra-Tech cell capable of high pressure/high temperature oper- ation and fitted with ZnSe windows served as the reaction chamber for in situ CO adsorption measurements. Scans were taken at a resolution of 4 to give a data spacing of 1.928 cm1. The cata- lyst (40 mg) was first activated at 450, 500 or 600 C in 75 sccm 33%H2/He for 1 h, purged with He for 15 min, and cooled to 40 C in 50 sccm of He flow. To probe the Pt0 clusters, the catalyst was subjected to 50 sccm of 2%CO/He at 40 C for 30 min. The catalyst was then purged in 50 sccm He for 20 min. Scans were recorded during CO adsorption and following the He purge. A 1%Pt/SiO2 cat- alyst, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, served as the
