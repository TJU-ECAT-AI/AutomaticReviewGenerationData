<p>Dehydrogenation of propane using an equimolar mixture of propane-d0 and propane-d8 was investigated over 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2 at atmospheric pressure and different reaction temperatures.</p>
<p>A normal kinetic isotope effect exists (kH/kD = 1.41.5) when the reaction is conducted on Pt/KL at different temperatures (400, 500, and 600 C), suggesting that CH bond activation is involved in the kinetically relevant steps.</p>
<p>Unlike the case of hexane aromatization, the unique structure of L-zeolite does not help in controlling the entry of propane molecules into the lobes of the L-zeolite containing the active sites; hence, bimolecular reactions do occur, leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Over Pt, alkane dehydrogenation requires elementary steps including activation of the CH bond and elimination of the hydrogen formed.</p>
<p>Recently, we [16] have found using isotope labeling that the unique structure of L-zeolite plays a significant role in controlling the entry of hexane molecules into the wider lobes of L-zeolite containing the Pt active sites during the dehydrocyclization reaction; in that case, the catalyst exhibited unparalleled stability for hexane aromatization, as bimolecular reactions leading to coking were avoided [15,16].</p>

1. This study investigates the dehydrogenation of propane over 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2 catalysts. It finds that a normal kinetic isotope effect exists, indicating CH bond activation is involved in the reaction mechanism. The unique structure of L-zeolite does not control propane entry into active sites, causing coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

2. The dehydrogenation process involves activation of the CH bond and hydrogen elimination. The study uses isotope labeling to understand the reaction mechanism.

3. The research highlights the role of L-zeolite's structure in hexane aromatization, preventing bimolecular reactions and coking. The catalyst shows unparalleled stability under these conditions.

4. The study compares noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It discusses their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field.

5. The catalyst preparation involves chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for Pt/AcAc2 and incipient wetness impregnation for Pt/SiO2. Catalyst characterization includes hydrogen chemisorption and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS).
