[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane using an equimolar mixture of propane-d0 and propane-d8 was investigated over 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2 at atmospheric pressure and different reaction temperatures."
[2] "Unlike the case of hexane aromatization, the unique structure of L-zeolite does not help in controlling the entry of propane molecules into the lobes of the L-zeolite containing the active sites; hence, bimolecular reactions do occur, leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Because of this unique property, the catalyst exhibited unparalleled stability for hexane aromatization, as bimolecular reactions leading to coking were avoided."
[4] "Using propane as the reactant, the aim of this study is to determine if an NKIE exists and to investigate the extent to which intracrystalline diffusion plays a role in the dehydrogenation of lighter alkanes; this is accomplished by carrying out experiments using an equimolar ratio of C3H8 and C3D8 in the feed."
[5] "The Pt/SiO2 catalyst was prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method."

The study focuses on investigating the dehydrogenation of propane over 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2 catalysts. The research examines the role of the L-zeolite structure in catalyst performance, particularly in controlling the entry of propane molecules into the active sites. The unique structure of L-zeolite does not effectively control propane molecule entry, resulting in bimolecular reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The study uses an equimolar mixture of propane-d0 and propane-d8 to investigate the kinetic isotope effect and the extent of intracrystalline diffusion in the dehydrogenation process. A Pt/SiO2 catalyst is prepared through the incipient wetness impregnation method.

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metals like Platinum are used due to their high reactivity in activating bonds and facilitating the dehydrogenation process. Metal oxides such as Chromium Oxide (CrOx), Gallium, Indium, Vanadium, Zinc, and Molybdenum Oxides are also utilized. The composition and effectiveness of these catalysts vary, with Platinum being known for its ability to promote dehydrogenation efficiently. Industrial applications include the production of propylene from propane. Recent developments focus on optimizing catalysts for better efficiency and stability. The potential advantages of using noble metals lie in their catalytic properties, while metal oxides offer alternative pathways for the dehydrogenation process. The unique structure of L-zeolite plays a role in controlling the entry of hexane molecules into the catalyst during dehydrocyclization, preventing bimolecular reactions that lead to coking. This property makes L-zeolite-supported Platinum catalysts promising for dehydrogenation reactions.

The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over two types of catalysts: 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2. The research highlighted a normal kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD = 1.41.5) at temperatures ranging from 400 to 600°C, indicating that the CH bond activation is involved in the key steps of the process. It was also noted that there is minimal hydrogen exchange in the recovered propane at temperatures above 400°C, suggesting that the adsorption and subsequent dehydrogenation of propane are largely irreversible, with the CH bond activation being the rate-limiting step. Contrary to hexane aromatization, the unique structure of L-zeolite did not effectively control the entry of propane molecules into the active sites during dehydrogenation, resulting in bimolecular reactions that led to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

Answer: The research examined the dehydrogenation of propane using 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2 catalysts. A normal kinetic isotope effect was observed, with the CH bond activation being the rate-limiting step. There was limited hydrogen exchange in the recovered propane, implying that adsorption and dehydrogenation are irreversible. The L-zeolite's unique structure hindered effective control of propane molecule entry into the active sites, causing coke formation and catalyst degradation.

研究考察了在1%Pt/KL和1%Pt/SiO2催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢。研究结果表明，在400至600°C的温度范围内存在正常的同位素效应（kH/kD = 1.41.5），这表明CH键活化是关键步骤的一部分。此外，发现在高于400°C的温度下，回收的丙烷中几乎没有氢交换，这表明吸附和随后的脱氢是不可逆的，CH键活化是决定性步骤。与己烷异构化不同，L-沸石的独特结构并未有效地控制丙烷分子进入含有活性位点的L-沸石的隔室，导致双分子反应发生并导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活。
