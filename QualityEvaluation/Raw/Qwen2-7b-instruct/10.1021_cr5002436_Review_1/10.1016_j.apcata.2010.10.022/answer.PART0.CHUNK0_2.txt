[1] "The majority of propylene is produced as a by-product from processes such as steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [1]."
[2] "A variety of Pt catalysts, often promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y-zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst."
[3] "Because of this unique property, the catalyst exhibited unparalleled stability for hexane aromatization, as bimolecular reactions leading to coking were avoided [15,16]."
[4] "Over Pt, alkane dehydrogenation requires elementary steps including activation of the CH bond and elimination of the hydrogen formed."
[5] "Since Pt supported on L-zeolite is reported to be a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes [6,17,18], it is important to investigate if the unique structure of L-zeolite can play a role in those Pt-catalyzed reactions as well."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metals like Platinum are used due to their high reactivity in activating bonds and facilitating the dehydrogenation process. Metal oxides such as Chromium Oxide (CrOx), Gallium, Indium, Vanadium, Zinc, and Molybdenum Oxides are also utilized. The composition and effectiveness of these catalysts vary, with Platinum being known for its ability to promote dehydrogenation efficiently. Industrial applications include the production of propylene from propane. Recent developments focus on optimizing catalysts for better efficiency and stability. The potential advantages of using noble metals lie in their catalytic properties, while metal oxides offer alternative pathways for the dehydrogenation process. The unique structure of L-zeolite plays a role in controlling the entry of hexane molecules into the catalyst during dehydrocyclization, preventing bimolecular reactions that lead to coking. This property makes L-zeolite-supported Platinum catalysts promising for dehydrogenation reactions.
