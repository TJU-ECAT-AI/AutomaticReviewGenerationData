[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane using an equimolar mixture of propane-d0 and propane-d8 was investigated over 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2 at atmospheric pressure and different reaction temperatures."
[2] "Unlike the case of hexane aromatization, the unique structure of L-zeolite does not help in controlling the entry of propane molecules into the lobes of the L-zeolite containing the active sites; hence, bimolecular reactions do occur, leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Because of this unique property, the catalyst exhibited unparalleled stability for hexane aromatization, as bimolecular reactions leading to coking were avoided."
[4] "Using propane as the reactant, the aim of this study is to determine if an NKIE exists and to investigate the extent to which intracrystalline diffusion plays a role in the dehydrogenation of lighter alkanes; this is accomplished by carrying out experiments using an equimolar ratio of C3H8 and C3D8 in the feed."
[5] "The Pt/SiO2 catalyst was prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method."

The study focuses on investigating the dehydrogenation of propane over 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2 catalysts. The research examines the role of the L-zeolite structure in catalyst performance, particularly in controlling the entry of propane molecules into the active sites. The unique structure of L-zeolite does not effectively control propane molecule entry, resulting in bimolecular reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The study uses an equimolar mixture of propane-d0 and propane-d8 to investigate the kinetic isotope effect and the extent of intracrystalline diffusion in the dehydrogenation process. A Pt/SiO2 catalyst is prepared through the incipient wetness impregnation method.

研究专注于考察1%Pt/KL和1%Pt/SiO2催化剂上丙烷脱氢的性能，特别关注L-沸石结构在控制丙烷分子进入活性位点方面的作用。L-沸石的独特结构未能有效控制丙烷分子的进入，导致双分子反应发生，引发焦炭形成并导致催化剂失活。研究通过等摩尔比例的丙烷-d0和丙烷-d8混合物来探究动力学同位素效应以及轻烷烃脱氢过程中晶内扩散的程度。通过制备Pt/SiO2催化剂来实现这一目的，采用浸渍湿法进行。
