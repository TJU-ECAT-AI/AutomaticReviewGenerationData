The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over two types of catalysts: 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2. The research highlighted a normal kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD = 1.41.5) at temperatures ranging from 400 to 600°C, indicating that the CH bond activation is involved in the key steps of the process. It was also noted that there is minimal hydrogen exchange in the recovered propane at temperatures above 400°C, suggesting that the adsorption and subsequent dehydrogenation of propane are largely irreversible, with the CH bond activation being the rate-limiting step. Contrary to hexane aromatization, the unique structure of L-zeolite did not effectively control the entry of propane molecules into the active sites during dehydrogenation, resulting in bimolecular reactions that led to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

Answer: The research examined the dehydrogenation of propane using 1%Pt/KL and 1%Pt/SiO2 catalysts. A normal kinetic isotope effect was observed, with the CH bond activation being the rate-limiting step. There was limited hydrogen exchange in the recovered propane, implying that adsorption and dehydrogenation are irreversible. The L-zeolite's unique structure hindered effective control of propane molecule entry into the active sites, causing coke formation and catalyst degradation.

研究考察了在1%Pt/KL和1%Pt/SiO2催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢。研究结果表明，在400至600°C的温度范围内存在正常的同位素效应（kH/kD = 1.41.5），这表明CH键活化是关键步骤的一部分。此外，发现在高于400°C的温度下，回收的丙烷中几乎没有氢交换，这表明吸附和随后的脱氢是不可逆的，CH键活化是决定性步骤。与己烷异构化不同，L-沸石的独特结构并未有效地控制丙烷分子进入含有活性位点的L-沸石的隔室，导致双分子反应发生并导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活。
