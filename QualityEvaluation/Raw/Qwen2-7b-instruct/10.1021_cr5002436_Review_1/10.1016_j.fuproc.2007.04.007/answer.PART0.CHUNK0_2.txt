[1] "There is a growing interest in catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes due to the increase in the demand for olefins such as propylene and isobutene [1,2]."
[2] "Isobutene, a key component of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) [3] and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), is a chemical used as an oxygenate for reformulated gasoline [4,5]."
[3] "Among several catalysts, PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is one of the most suitable ones."
[4] "The addition of potassium and lithium in PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of isobutane (iC4) to isobutene has recently received considerable attention because of the increasing demand for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), as additives for gasoline to increase the octane number and to substitute lead."
[5] "PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts have been widely used in naphtha reforming or alkane dehydrogenation processes due to their high selectivity and stability [7]."
[6] "It is shown that the addition of Sn to Pt has the following effects on dehydroge- nation reaction: i Increases the catalyst stability and decrease the rate of deactivation [11]. ii Changes the selectivity by inhibiting hydrocracking, oligomerization and coke formation on the catalyst surface [3,12,13]. iii The metallic crystallites show high degree of dispersion and higher resistance to aging [11]."
[7] "Generally, platinumtin alloys are obtained only upon reductive treatments, in which a one-to-one atomic composition (PtSn) is the most frequently detected by several techniques."
[8] "Alloy formation between Pt and Sn is thermodynamically favorable and is expected when the metals are in sufficiently close proximity for the tin oxide to accept spillover hydrogen from easily reducible Pt."
[9] "For the dehydrogenation of alkanes, a great deal of work has been done to provide better supports for noble metals. Spinel-type structures, which have high thermal stability, low acidity and hydrophobic behavior, are well adapted to the expected conditions forced in dehydrogenation processes."
[10] "Several studies are being carried out to evaluate the modification of the stability, selectivity and activity of the metallic catalysts by the addition of some alkali metals such as Li, Ba, K and Ca in PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[11] "The addition of K as the promoter resulted in better selectivity toward isobutene. It was observed that alkali and alkaline earth metals are basic in character and could suppress the strong acidity responsible for the reaction chain to propagate further from isobutene such as cracking, oligomerization, cyclization and coke formation."
[12] "Catalyst 3 showed the best catalytic performance."

The literature focuses on the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane (iC4) to isobutene using PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. These catalysts are particularly useful for producing MTBE and ETBE, which are used as gasoline additives to increase octane numbers and replace lead. The addition of potassium and lithium enhances the catalyst's performance by improving stability, selectivity, and resistance to aging. Platinum-tin alloys are formed during reduction, and their thermodynamic favorability depends on the proximity of the metals. Spinel-type structures offer high thermal stability and hydrophobic behavior, making them suitable for dehydrogenation processes. The addition of alkali metals like lithium and potassium improves catalyst stability, selectivity, and activity. Potassium specifically helps in suppressing the strong acidity responsible for side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation. Catalyst 3 demonstrated the highest catalytic efficiency among the tested catalysts.
