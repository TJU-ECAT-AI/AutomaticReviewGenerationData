[1] "The presence of both K and Li in the catalysts resulted in higher activity and stability of the catalyst for the dehydroge- nation of iC4 to isobutene."
[2] "PtSnK supported catalyst used in this study showed higher selectivity than PtSnLi."
[3] "The addition of K resulted in better selectivity toward isobutene."
[4] "Catalyst 3 showed the best catalytic performance."
[5] "The best operating conditions for the highest selectivity toward isobutene production were as follows:a reaction temperature of 550 C, feed flow rate of 50 cm3/min and iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, were utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts were compared to metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Platinum-based catalysts showed higher activity and stability for the dehydrogenation of isobutane (iC4) to isobutene, especially when potassium (K) and lithium (Li) were added as promoters. Among these, PtSnK catalysts demonstrated superior selectivity compared to PtSnLi catalysts. The addition of potassium enhanced the selectivity towards isobutene production. Catalyst 3, which incorporated potassium, showed the best catalytic performance. Optimal operating conditions for maximizing isobutene selectivity included a reaction temperature of 550°C, a feed flow rate of 50 cm³/min, and an iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3.

在非氧化脱氢化轻烯烃的过程中，特别是铂基催化剂被用于异丁烷（iC4）到异丁烯的脱氢反应。这些催化剂与铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂进行了比较。铂基催化剂在异丁烷脱氢反应中表现出更高的活性和稳定性，尤其是在添加钾（K）和锂（Li）作为促进剂的情况下。其中，PtSnK催化剂的择优性高于PtSnLi催化剂。钾的加入提高了异丁烯生成的选择性。含有钾的催化剂3表现出了最佳的催化性能。为了最大化异丁烯选择性，最优的操作条件包括反应温度为550°C，进料流速为50 cm³/min，以及iC4/H2比率为1/3。
