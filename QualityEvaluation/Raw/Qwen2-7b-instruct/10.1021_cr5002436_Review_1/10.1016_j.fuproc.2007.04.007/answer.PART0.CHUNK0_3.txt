[1] "The presence of both K and Li in the catalysts resulted in higher activity and stability of the catalyst for the dehydroge- nation of iC4 to isobutene."
[2] "Suitable and sufficient weight percentage of Sn and the use of K as the promoter for reducing undesired production and acidity of the support caused the highest selectivity to isobutene."
[3] "Catalyst 3 showed the best catalytic performance."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the effectiveness of Platinum-based catalysts, especially when combined with metal promoters like potassium (K) and lithium (Li). The document mentions that the addition of K and Li enhances the activity and stability of the catalysts, leading to higher selectivity for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. Catalyst 3, which contains these metals, demonstrated the best catalytic performance. The document does not provide detailed compositions or industrial applications of the catalysts mentioned, nor does it discuss recent developments in the field.
