<p>The presence of both K and Li in the catalysts resulted in higher activity and stability of the catalyst for the dehydrogenation of iC4 to isobutene. The amount of PtxSny alloy and the percentage of Sn reduced to the metallic state were higher in those PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, in which, higher quantities of [PtCl2 (SnCl3)2]2 complex were formed during the impregnation.</p>
<p>PtSnK supported catalyst used in this study showed higher selectivity than PtSnLi. Its remarkable performance for the dehydrogenation of iC4 was associated with the structural and electronic properties.</p>
<p>Alkali and alkaline earth metals are basic in character and could suppress the strong acidity responsible for the reaction chain to propagate further from isobutene such as cracking, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation.</p>
<p>Catalyst 3 showed the best catalytic performance. The best operating conditions for the highest selectivity toward isobutene production were as follows: a reaction temperature of 550 C, feed flow rate of 50 cm3/min, and iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3.</p>

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, in the dehydrogenation of iC4 to isobutene. It compares these catalysts to metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in terms of their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. The text highlights the importance of the presence of potassium (K) and lithium (Li) in catalysts, which enhance their activity and stability. It also notes the role of the [PtCl2 (SnCl3)2]2 complex in the formation of PtxSny alloys, which contribute to the catalyst's performance. The document emphasizes the superior selectivity of PtSnK over PtSnLi catalysts, attributing this to their structural and electronic properties. Additionally, it mentions that alkali and alkaline earth metals, like K, can suppress strong acidity, preventing further reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation. The optimal operating conditions for achieving the highest selectivity in the dehydrogenation process involve a reaction temperature of 550°C, a feed flow rate of 50 cm3/min, and an iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3. These findings suggest that the use of specific catalyst compositions and operational parameters can significantly improve the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process.

The study focused on the comparison of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts, specifically Chromium oxide (CrOx), Gallium, Indium, Vanadium, Zinc, and Molybdenum oxides, in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The noble metal-based catalysts, such as PtSn/γ-Al2O3, demonstrated higher activity and stability for the dehydrogenation of isobutane (iC4) to isobutene. The presence of potassium (K) in the catalysts led to enhanced performance, resulting in higher selectivity towards isobutene production. The use of a suitable weight percentage of tin (Sn) combined with potassium as a promoter reduced undesired reactions and acidity, leading to optimal catalytic performance. The PtSnK catalyst showed superior selectivity compared to the PtSnLi catalyst. Catalyst 3 exhibited the best catalytic performance among the tested catalysts.

The literature focuses on the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane (iC4) to isobutene using PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. These catalysts are particularly useful for producing MTBE and ETBE, which are used as gasoline additives to increase octane numbers and replace lead. The addition of potassium and lithium enhances the catalyst's performance by improving stability, selectivity, and resistance to aging. Platinum-tin alloys are formed during reduction, and their thermodynamic favorability depends on the proximity of the metals. Spinel-type structures offer high thermal stability and hydrophobic behavior, making them suitable for dehydrogenation processes. The addition of alkali metals like lithium and potassium improves catalyst stability, selectivity, and activity. Potassium specifically helps in suppressing the strong acidity responsible for side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation. Catalyst 3 demonstrated the highest catalytic efficiency among the tested catalysts.
