<p>The presence of both K and Li in the catalysts resulted in higher activity and stability of the catalyst for the dehydrogenation of iC4 to isobutene. The amount of PtxSny alloy and the percentage of Sn reduced to the metallic state were higher in those PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, in which, higher quantities of [PtCl2 (SnCl3)2]2 complex were formed during the impregnation.</p>
<p>PtSnK supported catalyst used in this study showed higher selectivity than PtSnLi. Its remarkable performance for the dehydrogenation of iC4 was associated with the structural and electronic properties.</p>
<p>Alkali and alkaline earth metals are basic in character and could suppress the strong acidity responsible for the reaction chain to propagate further from isobutene such as cracking, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation.</p>
<p>Catalyst 3 showed the best catalytic performance. The best operating conditions for the highest selectivity toward isobutene production were as follows: a reaction temperature of 550 C, feed flow rate of 50 cm3/min, and iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3.</p>

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, in the dehydrogenation of iC4 to isobutene. It compares these catalysts to metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in terms of their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. The text highlights the importance of the presence of potassium (K) and lithium (Li) in catalysts, which enhance their activity and stability. It also notes the role of the [PtCl2 (SnCl3)2]2 complex in the formation of PtxSny alloys, which contribute to the catalyst's performance. The document emphasizes the superior selectivity of PtSnK over PtSnLi catalysts, attributing this to their structural and electronic properties. Additionally, it mentions that alkali and alkaline earth metals, like K, can suppress strong acidity, preventing further reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation. The optimal operating conditions for achieving the highest selectivity in the dehydrogenation process involve a reaction temperature of 550°C, a feed flow rate of 50 cm3/min, and an iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3. These findings suggest that the use of specific catalyst compositions and operational parameters can significantly improve the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process.
