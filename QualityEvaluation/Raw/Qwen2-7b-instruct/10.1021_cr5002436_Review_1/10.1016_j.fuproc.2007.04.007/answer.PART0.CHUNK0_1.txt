The study focused on the comparison of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts, specifically Chromium oxide (CrOx), Gallium, Indium, Vanadium, Zinc, and Molybdenum oxides, in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The noble metal-based catalysts, such as PtSn/γ-Al2O3, demonstrated higher activity and stability for the dehydrogenation of isobutane (iC4) to isobutene. The presence of potassium (K) in the catalysts led to enhanced performance, resulting in higher selectivity towards isobutene production. The use of a suitable weight percentage of tin (Sn) combined with potassium as a promoter reduced undesired reactions and acidity, leading to optimal catalytic performance. The PtSnK catalyst showed superior selectivity compared to the PtSnLi catalyst. Catalyst 3 exhibited the best catalytic performance among the tested catalysts.

研究重点比较了贵金属基催化剂，尤其是铂（Pt），与金属氧化物基催化剂，如铬氧化物（CrOx）、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢方面的应用。贵金属基催化剂，特别是PtSn/γ-Al2O3，对于异丁烷（iC4）脱氢生成异丁烯表现出更高的活性和稳定性。钾（K）的存在使催化剂性能提高，导致更高选择性地向异丁烯转化。使用适当的锡（Sn）重量百分比与钾作为促进剂结合，减少了不期望的反应和酸性，从而达到最佳催化性能。PtSnK催化剂在选择性方面优于PtSnLi催化剂。催化剂3在测试的催化剂中表现出最佳的催化性能。
