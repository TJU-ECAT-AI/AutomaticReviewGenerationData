The document discusses the development of highly durable catalysts for automobile industries without platinum sintering in oxidative atmospheres. Ceria-based oxides are used due to their ability to store and release oxygen and stabilize precious metal dispersion. The sintering inhibition mechanism of platinum particles on ceria-based oxide is explored using X-ray absorption analysis. The PtOCe bond, acting as an anchor, inhibits the sintering of Pt particles on ceria-based oxide. The strength of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction depends on the electron density of oxygen in the support, controlling the sintering of supported Pt particles. These findings provide a clear understanding of the relationship between the inhibitory effect of Pt sintering and Pt-oxidesupport interaction, leading to planned catalytic design.

文档讨论了在氧化气氛中无铂晶粒生长的高效催化剂在汽车工业中的开发。由于其储存和释放氧气以及稳定贵金属分散的能力，使用了铈基氧化物。通过X射线吸收分析探索了铂颗粒在铈基氧化物上的晶粒生长抑制机制。铂OCe键作为锚点，抑制了铈基氧化物上的铂颗粒晶粒生长。铂-氧化物支持相互作用的强度取决于支持氧化物中的氧电子密度，控制着支持铂颗粒的晶化。这些发现清楚地揭示了铂晶粒生长抑制效果与铂-氧化物支持相互作用之间的关系，从而实现有计划的催化设计。
