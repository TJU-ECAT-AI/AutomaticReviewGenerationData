The document discusses the development of highly durable catalysts for automobile industries without platinum sintering in oxidative atmospheres. Ceria-based oxides are used due to their ability to store and release oxygen and stabilize precious metal dispersion. The sintering inhibition mechanism of platinum particles on ceria-based oxide is explored using X-ray absorption analysis. The PtOCe bond, acting as an anchor, inhibits the sintering of Pt particles on ceria-based oxide.

The literature discusses the comparison of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically focusing on platinum (Pt) and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the differences in their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field. 

The text emphasizes the unique properties of ceria-based oxide (CZY) as a support for Pt catalysts, which inhibit sintering under oxidizing conditions. This is attributed to the formation of a PtOCe bond, which acts as an anchor and prevents Pt particles from migrating and sintering. The literature suggests that the strength of this Pt-oxidesupport interaction is influenced by the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide, enabling the control of the sintering inhibition effect on Pt. 

In summary, the document showcases the innovative approach to designing catalysts through the utilization of advanced analysis techniques, aiming to transition from trial-and-error methods to planned design and control in practical applications.

The document focuses on the study of Pt sintering inhibition mechanism on ceria-based oxide catalysts under oxidizing conditions at high temperatures. It discusses the differences in Pt behavior on ceria-based oxide (CZY) versus alumina (Al2O3) catalysts. The key findings include the identification of the PtOCe bond as an anchor that inhibits Pt particle sintering on ceria-based oxide. The document also explores the relationship between the strength of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction and the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide, showing a direct correlation in controlling the sintering inhibition effect on Pt.

Advantages of ceria-based oxide catalysts over alumina catalysts include better stabilization of high-oxidation states of Pt, preventing Pt sintering under oxidizing conditions. The PtOCe bond plays a crucial role in this mechanism. The study suggests that the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide can be manipulated to control the sintering inhibition effect on Pt, leading to improved catalytic performance and durability.

The research provides insights into planned catalytic design using advanced analysis techniques, moving beyond trial-and-error approaches. The document highlights the importance of understanding the atomic-level interactions between Pt and the support oxide in designing efficient Pt-based catalysts for various applications, including automotive emissions purification and nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

[1] "The oxidation state of Pt after aging increased with decreasing binding energy of the O(1s) electron."
[2] "Subsequently, Pt particle size after the aging decreased as the electron density of oxygen in the support increased."
[3] "As a result, the sintering inhibition effect on Pt can be controlled by the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide through the Pt-oxidesupport interaction."

The study highlights the importance of the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide for controlling the sintering inhibition effect on Pt. The higher the electron density of oxygen, the stronger the Pt-oxidesupport interaction, leading to the stabilization of the high-oxidation state of Pt. This stabilization generates a PtOCe bond, acting as an anchor and inhibiting the migration of Pt particles, thus preventing their sintering. Consequently, the sintering of Pt supported on ceria-based oxide (CZY) does not occur under oxidizing conditions, while Pt supported on alumina (Al2O3) sinters significantly.

研究强调了支持氧化物中氧的电子密度对于控制Pt烧结抑制效果的重要性。氧的电子密度越高，Pt-氧化物相互作用越强，导致Pt的高氧化态稳定化。这种稳定化产生了一个PtOCe键，作为锚点，抑制了Pt颗粒的迁移，从而防止它们的烧结。因此，在氧化气氛下，以CZY为载体的Pt不发生烧结，而以Al2O3为载体的Pt显著烧结。

This study compares noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as ceria (CeO2), in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The key findings are as follows:

1. Platinum (Pt) supported on ceria-based oxide (CeZrY mixed oxide, CZY) does not undergo sintering at 800°C under oxidizing conditions, unlike Pt supported on alumina (Al2O3), which significantly sinters.

2. During aging, Pt particles on Al2O3 grow to 23.6 nm in diameter, while those on CZY remain highly dispersed, averaging about 1 nm in size.

3. The sintering inhibition mechanism for Pt on CZY involves a strong interaction with the CZY support, which stabilizes the high-oxidation state of Pt through the formation of a rigid PtOCe bond, acting as an anchor to inhibit Pt migration.

4. The electron density of oxygen in the support oxide controls the strength of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction and, consequently, the sintering inhibition effect on Pt.

This research highlights the importance of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction in controlling Pt sintering and offers insights into planned catalytic design for more effective catalysts in industrial applications.
