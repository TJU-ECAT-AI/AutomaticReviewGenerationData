[1] "The oxidation state of Pt after aging increased with decreasing binding energy of the O(1s) electron."
[2] "Subsequently, Pt particle size after the aging decreased as the electron density of oxygen in the support increased."
[3] "As a result, the sintering inhibition effect on Pt can be controlled by the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide through the Pt-oxidesupport interaction."

The study highlights the importance of the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide for controlling the sintering inhibition effect on Pt. The higher the electron density of oxygen, the stronger the Pt-oxidesupport interaction, leading to the stabilization of the high-oxidation state of Pt. This stabilization generates a PtOCe bond, acting as an anchor and inhibiting the migration of Pt particles, thus preventing their sintering. Consequently, the sintering of Pt supported on ceria-based oxide (CZY) does not occur under oxidizing conditions, while Pt supported on alumina (Al2O3) sinters significantly.

研究强调了支持氧化物中氧的电子密度对于控制Pt烧结抑制效果的重要性。氧的电子密度越高，Pt-氧化物相互作用越强，导致Pt的高氧化态稳定化。这种稳定化产生了一个PtOCe键，作为锚点，抑制了Pt颗粒的迁移，从而防止它们的烧结。因此，在氧化气氛下，以CZY为载体的Pt不发生烧结，而以Al2O3为载体的Pt显著烧结。
