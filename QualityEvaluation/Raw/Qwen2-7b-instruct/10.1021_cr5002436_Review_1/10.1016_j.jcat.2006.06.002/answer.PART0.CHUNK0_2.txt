The document focuses on the study of Pt sintering inhibition mechanism on ceria-based oxide catalysts under oxidizing conditions at high temperatures. It discusses the differences in Pt behavior on ceria-based oxide (CZY) versus alumina (Al2O3) catalysts. The key findings include the identification of the PtOCe bond as an anchor that inhibits Pt particle sintering on ceria-based oxide. The document also explores the relationship between the strength of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction and the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide, showing a direct correlation in controlling the sintering inhibition effect on Pt.

Advantages of ceria-based oxide catalysts over alumina catalysts include better stabilization of high-oxidation states of Pt, preventing Pt sintering under oxidizing conditions. The PtOCe bond plays a crucial role in this mechanism. The study suggests that the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide can be manipulated to control the sintering inhibition effect on Pt, leading to improved catalytic performance and durability.

The research provides insights into planned catalytic design using advanced analysis techniques, moving beyond trial-and-error approaches. The document highlights the importance of understanding the atomic-level interactions between Pt and the support oxide in designing efficient Pt-based catalysts for various applications, including automotive emissions purification and nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.
