[1] "Using TEM, XRD, and CO pulse methods, we found that Pt supported on ceria-based oxide (CZY) did not sinter under oxidizing condition at 800 C, whereas Pt atoms on Al2O3 sintered significantly."
[2] "Next, we clarified the sintering inhibition mechanism of Pt particles on CZY at the atomic level using XAFS analysis."
[3] "The PtOCe bond, that is, the Pt-oxide support interaction generated. The PtOCe bond acted as an anchor and inhibited Pt migration."
[4] "Consequently, it is clear that the sintering inhibition effect on Pt can be controlled by the electron density of oxygen in the support through the Pt-oxidesupport interaction."

The literature discusses the comparison of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically focusing on platinum (Pt) and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the differences in their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field. 

The text emphasizes the unique properties of ceria-based oxide (CZY) as a support for Pt catalysts, which inhibit sintering under oxidizing conditions. This is attributed to the formation of a PtOCe bond, which acts as an anchor and prevents Pt particles from migrating and sintering. The literature suggests that the strength of this Pt-oxidesupport interaction is influenced by the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide, enabling the control of the sintering inhibition effect on Pt. 

In summary, the document showcases the innovative approach to designing catalysts through the utilization of advanced analysis techniques, aiming to transition from trial-and-error methods to planned design and control in practical applications.

文献讨论了贵金属催化剂（特别是铂）与金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的比较。它强调了它们在组成、效果、工业应用、最新发展和领域优势方面的差异。

文献强调了铈基氧化物（CZY）作为铂催化剂支持的独特性质，在氧化条件下抑制结块。这归因于形成PtOCe键，该键作为锚点防止铂颗粒迁移和结块。文献表明，这种Pt-氧化物支持相互作用的强度受支持氧化物中氧电子密度的影响，从而控制了Pt的结块抑制效果。

总之，该文档展示了通过使用高级分析技术设计催化剂的创新方法，旨在从尝试性错误的方法转变为实际应用的计划设计和控制。
