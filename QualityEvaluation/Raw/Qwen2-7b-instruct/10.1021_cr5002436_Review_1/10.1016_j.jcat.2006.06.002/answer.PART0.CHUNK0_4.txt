[1] "Using TEM, XRD, and CO pulse methods, we found that Pt supported on ceria-based oxide (CZY) did not sinter under oxidizing condition at 800 C, whereas Pt atoms on Al2O3 sintered significantly."
[2] "In contrast, Pt particles in the Pt/Al2O3 grew up to 23.6 nm (by the CO pulse method) during the aging treatment."
[3] "In contrast, Pt particles in the Pt/CZY after aging continued to be highly dispersed with a diameter of about 1 nm."
[4] "Next, we clarified the sintering inhibition mechanism of Pt particles on CZY at the atomic level using XAFS analysis."
[5] "Pt supported on CZY exhibited a strong interaction with the CZY support; therefore, the CZY support stabilized the high-oxidation state of Pt under oxidizing conditions at high temperatures and then the rigid PtOCe bond, that is, the Pt-oxide support interaction generated."
[6] "The PtOCe bond acted as an anchor and inhibited Pt migration."
[7] "Consequently, it is clear that the sintering inhibition effect on Pt can be controlled by the electron density of oxygen in the support through the Pt-oxidesupport interaction."

This study compares noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as ceria (CeO2), in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The key findings are as follows:

1. Platinum (Pt) supported on ceria-based oxide (CeZrY mixed oxide, CZY) does not undergo sintering at 800°C under oxidizing conditions, unlike Pt supported on alumina (Al2O3), which significantly sinters.

2. During aging, Pt particles on Al2O3 grow to 23.6 nm in diameter, while those on CZY remain highly dispersed, averaging about 1 nm in size.

3. The sintering inhibition mechanism for Pt on CZY involves a strong interaction with the CZY support, which stabilizes the high-oxidation state of Pt through the formation of a rigid PtOCe bond, acting as an anchor to inhibit Pt migration.

4. The electron density of oxygen in the support oxide controls the strength of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction and, consequently, the sintering inhibition effect on Pt.

This research highlights the importance of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction in controlling Pt sintering and offers insights into planned catalytic design for more effective catalysts in industrial applications.

本研究比较了用于非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的贵金属催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如铈氧化物、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）。关键发现如下：

1. 铂（Pt）负载在铈基氧化物（CeZrY混合氧化物，CZY）上，在800°C的氧化条件下不会发生烧结，而负载在氧化铝（Al2O3）上的铂则显著烧结。

2. 在老化过程中，Al2O3上的铂颗粒生长到23.6纳米直径，而CZY上的铂颗粒保持高度分散，平均直径约为1纳米。

3. 对于CZY上的铂，其与CZY支撑的强烈相互作用通过形成坚固的PtOCe键来稳定铂的高氧化状态，在高温下的氧化条件下，这种键作为锚点抑制了铂的迁移。

4. 支撑氧化物中的氧的电子密度控制着铂-氧化物支撑相互作用的强度以及铂的烧结抑制效果。

这项研究强调了铂-氧化物支撑相互作用在控制铂烧结方面的重要性，并为更有效的工业应用催化剂提供了设计指导。
