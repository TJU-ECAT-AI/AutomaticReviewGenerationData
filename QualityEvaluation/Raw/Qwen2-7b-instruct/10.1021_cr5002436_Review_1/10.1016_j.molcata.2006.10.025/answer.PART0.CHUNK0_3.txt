Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the Platinum-based catalysts showed a significant improvement in dehydrogenation selectivity when zinc was added. The effectiveness of these catalysts is highly dependent on the sequence of zinc deposition and the zinc content. The Zn(0.5%)SnPt/Al catalyst provided the highest activity and selectivity, with minimal activity loss, due to its low coke formation and high thermal stability of platinum particles. Zinc addition altered the properties of the platinum metal phase, increasing the dispersion of platinum particles and changing the electronic environment of the metal. The high electron density of the platinum metal weakened the strength of the Pt(C C) bond, promoting olefin desorption and suppressing the formation and polymerization of unsaturated coke precursors. These catalysts also exhibited a significant reduction in coke formation, highlighting zinc's role in improving their stability and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes.

比较用于非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，与铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂，添加锌后铂基催化剂在脱氢选择性上表现出显著的改进。这些催化剂的有效性高度依赖于锌沉积顺序和锌含量。Zn(0.5%)SnPt/Al催化剂提供了最高的活性和选择性，且活动损失最小，这归因于其低焦炭形成和铂颗粒的高热稳定性。锌的添加改变了铂金属相的性质，增加了铂颗粒的分散，并改变了金属的电子环境。铂金属的高电子密度削弱了Pt(C C)键的强度，促进烯烃脱附并抑制不饱和焦炭前体在金属上的形成和聚合。这些催化剂还表现出显著的焦炭形成减少，突出了锌在提高其稳定性和脱氢选择性方面的作用。
