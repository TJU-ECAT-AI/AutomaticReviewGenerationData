The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts are effective for dehydrogenation reactions, especially in the presence of zinc dopants. Zinc addition improves the catalytic performance, leading to high propylene selectivity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, can also be used for dehydrogenation, though their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages vary. Recent developments focus on optimizing catalyst composition, improving selectivity, and reducing coke formation. The zinc doping in platinum catalysts leads to changes in the metal phase properties, including increased dispersion, modified electronic environment, and reduced coke formation. This results in improved catalytic performance, particularly in the Zn(0.5%)SnPt/Al catalyst, which shows high activity, selectivity, and thermal stability. The zinc dopant reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles, weakens the Pt(C C) bond, and promotes olefin desorption, thus suppressing the formation of unsaturated coke precursors on the metal surface. The amount of coke produced is significantly reduced in zinc-doped catalysts, indicating their potential in reducing coke formation during dehydrogenation processes.

文档讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中使用贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂催化剂，以及金属氧化物催化剂的应用。铂催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出良好的效果，特别是在锌掺杂的情况下。锌的添加能够显著提高催化性能，实现高丙烯选择性。金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，也可以用于脱氢，但它们的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新进展和潜在优势有所不同。最近的发展集中在优化催化剂组成、提高选择性并减少焦炭形成。锌掺杂在铂催化剂中的作用导致金属相性质的变化，包括分散度的增加、电子环境的变化，并且减少了焦炭的形成。这导致了催化性能的改进，尤其是在Zn(0.5%)SnPt/Al催化剂中，显示出高活性、选择性和热稳定性。锌掺杂减少了表面铂簇的尺寸，削弱了Pt(C C)键，促进了烯烃的脱附，从而抑制了金属表面上不饱和焦炭前体的形成。锌掺杂催化剂产生的焦炭量显著减少，表明其在减少脱氢过程中焦炭形成方面的潜力。
