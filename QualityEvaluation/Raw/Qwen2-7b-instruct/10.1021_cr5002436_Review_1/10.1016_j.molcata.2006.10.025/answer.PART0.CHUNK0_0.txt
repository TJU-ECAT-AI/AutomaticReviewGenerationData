1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, along with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. These catalysts are effective in enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of dehydrogenation processes. Platinum catalysts have been found to offer a remarkable improvement in dehydrogenation performance when zinc is added to them, resulting in a notable enhancement in their catalytic properties. This improvement is primarily due to the geometric and electronic modifications of the metallic phase caused by the presence of zinc, which leads to better dispersion of platinum particles and changes in the electronic environment of the platinum metal. This, in turn, weakens the strength of the Pt(C C) bond and promotes olefin desorption, effectively suppressing the formation and polymerization of unsaturated coke precursors on the metal surface. This results in high selectivity towards propylene production. Zinc's ability to reduce the size of surface Pt ensembles and increase the electronic density of the platinum metal phase is crucial in enhancing the selectivity and stability of the dehydrogenation process. Furthermore, the presence of zinc significantly reduces the formation of coke, contributing to the overall efficiency and longevity of the catalysts.

1. 非氧化脱氢轻烯烃过程中，使用贵金属催化剂（尤其是铂）以及铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼酸盐等金属氧化物催化剂。这些催化剂在提高脱氢反应的选择性和效率方面非常有效。当向铂催化剂中添加锌时，会显著提高它们的催化性能，导致催化剂的催化性能总体得到提升。这种改善主要归因于锌对金属相的几何和电子修改，这促进了铂颗粒的分散并改变了铂金属的电子环境。这削弱了Pt(C C)键的强度并促进烯烃脱附，有效地抑制了金属表面不饱和焦油前体的形成和聚合。这导致丙烯的高选择性生产。锌能够减小表面铂簇的尺寸并增加铂金属的电子密度，在提高脱氢过程的选择性和稳定性方面至关重要。此外，锌的存在显著减少了焦油的生成，从而提高了催化剂的整体效率和使用寿命。
