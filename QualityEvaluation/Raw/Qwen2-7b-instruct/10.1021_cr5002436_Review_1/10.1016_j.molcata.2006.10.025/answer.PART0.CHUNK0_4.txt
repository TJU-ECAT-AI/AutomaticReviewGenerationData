The document compares noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, with metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metal catalysts typically exhibit higher activity and selectivity. Recent developments focus on improving stability and selectivity through additions like alkali metals, tin, and zinc. Metal oxide catalysts are noted for their high thermal stability and resistance to coke formation. Noble metal catalysts, especially platinum, are favored for their superior catalytic performance in industries like petrochemical production. Metal oxide catalysts offer a more cost-effective alternative. Recent advancements have led to new catalyst formulations combining the benefits of both noble metal and metal oxide components. The effectiveness of noble metal catalysts is influenced by factors like deposition sequence, modifiers, and specific application. Industrial uses include petrochemical processes for producing propylene and isobutene from naphtha.
