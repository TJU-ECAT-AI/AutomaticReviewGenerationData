The document discusses the redispersion of supported metal catalysts, particularly focusing on platinum catalysts on supports like y-Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2. The redispersion phenomenon, which refers to the increase in dispersion of crystallites of sintered supported metal catalysts, is studied using various techniques including hydrogen chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed reduction, and cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction. The study aims to answer questions related to redispersion, select reasonable mechanisms, and develop a method to determine under what conditions redispersion occurs. It is found that redispersion depends on the presence of platinum oxide which can be stabilized by forming a complex with the support. Chlorine addition during oxidation enhances redispersion, while water addition inhibits it. Redispersion occurs only when there is a strong interaction between the platinum oxide and the support, allowing the formation of a surface complex. The molecular migration model, involving the spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species, best explains the redispersion phenomenon in this study.

本文讨论了支持金属催化剂的再分散问题，特别是铂催化剂在y-Al2O3、SiO2和TiO2等支撑上的再分散。通过氢吸附、X射线衍射、透射电子显微镜、温度程序化还原和环己烯氢化反应等技术研究了铂晶粒在热处理后重新分散的现象。研究旨在回答有关再分散的问题、选择合理的机制，并寻找确定催化剂在何种条件下可以重新分散的方法。发现铂氧化物的存在是再分散的关键，它可以与支撑形成复合物以保持稳定性。氧化过程中添加氯化物能增强再分散，而水的添加则会抑制再分散。只有在铂氧化物与支撑之间存在足够强的相互作用时，才能发生再分散，从而形成表面复合物。分子迁移模型，涉及铂氧化物的扩展和迁移物种的捕获，最能解释本研究中观察到的再分散现象。
