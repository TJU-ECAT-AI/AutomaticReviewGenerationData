[1] "Although supported metal catalysts are thermally stable in general, changes in metal surface area still occur with use or treatment for a long period at elevated temperature. The resulting loss of metal surface area generally leads to a decrease in catalytic activity and, very often, to a change in the reaction selectivity (I), and it is necessary to restore the original activity of sintered catalysts by a regeneration process, termed redispersion (2)."
[2] "The objectives of this study are three-fold: first, to obtain some answers to the above questions; second, to select reasonable mechanisms; and third, to search for a simple method for determining whether or not, and under what conditions, the redisper- sion occurs."
[3] "Dispersion for Ptly-Al203 increases after treatment in oxygen below 600C. For Pt/ SiOz redispersion does not occur under any condition covered in this study. In the case of Pt/TiOz, redispersion occurs only in the presence of chlorine during oxidation."
[4] "The addition of chlorine during oxidation enhances redispersion, while the addition of water inhibits redispersion."
[5] "Redispersion can occur only under a condition in which interaction is strong enough to produce surface complex between the platinum oxide and the support."
[6] "The mechanism for redispersion (2, 24) based on the molecular migration model which involves spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species can best account for results obtained in this study."

The document discusses the redispersion of supported metal catalysts, particularly focusing on platinum catalysts on supports like y-Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2. The redispersion phenomenon, which refers to the increase in dispersion of crystallites of sintered supported metal catalysts, is studied using various techniques including hydrogen chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed reduction, and cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction. The study aims to answer questions related to redispersion, select reasonable mechanisms, and develop a method to determine under what conditions redispersion occurs. It is found that redispersion depends on the presence of platinum oxide which can be stabilized by forming a complex with the support. Chlorine addition during oxidation enhances redispersion, while water addition inhibits it. Redispersion occurs only when there is a strong interaction between the platinum oxide and the support, allowing the formation of a surface complex. The molecular migration model, involving the spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species, best explains the redispersion phenomenon in this study.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, several aspects can be highlighted:

1. Platinum is a noble metal known for its exceptional catalytic properties in various chemical reactions, including the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Its effectiveness lies in its ability to facilitate the conversion of olefins into alkynes, alkenes, or alkanes without undergoing oxidation. Platinum catalysts are often used in industrial processes due to their high efficiency and stability.

2. Metal oxides, on the other hand, are typically cheaper and more readily available than noble metals. They can exhibit catalytic activity depending on the specific metal and its oxidation state. For instance, CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides can be used as catalysts, but their performance might not match that of noble metals. These catalysts can be effective in certain reactions but might require higher operating temperatures or more rigorous conditions.

3. Industrial applications of these catalysts vary widely. Noble metal catalysts, such as platinum, are commonly employed in industries requiring high selectivity and efficiency, such as petrochemical processing. Metal oxide catalysts are often utilized in applications where cost-effectiveness is crucial, such as in smaller-scale or emerging technologies.

4. Recent developments in the field focus on improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of both types of catalysts. For noble metals, efforts aim at enhancing their dispersion and controlling the surface chemistry to optimize performance. For metal oxides, researchers strive to develop new materials or modify existing ones to improve their catalytic activity and durability.

5. Potential advantages of noble metal catalysts include superior activity, selectivity, and stability, but they come with high costs and potential environmental concerns due to their scarcity. Metal oxide catalysts offer a more affordable alternative, potentially enabling broader industrial adoption. However, they may require optimization for specific applications to achieve competitive performance.

To determine whether redispersion occurs for any catalyst system, chemisorption measurements using two different methods are essential. The presence of a significant increase in dispersion, particularly when using the Pt/y-Al203 system in the presence of chlorine during oxidation, suggests a strong interaction between the metal oxide and the support, facilitating redispersion. This mechanism can be attributed to the spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species, which is a key aspect in understanding the redisper- sion capacity of catalysts under various conditions.

比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，与金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）之间的几个方面：

1. 铂是一种贵金属，因其在各种化学反应中的卓越催化性能而闻名，包括轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。其有效性在于能够促进烯烃转化为炔、烯或烷，而不进行氧化。铂催化剂通常在工业过程中使用，因为它们具有高效率和稳定性。

2. 金属氧化物通常比贵金属更便宜且更容易获得。它们在特定金属及其氧化态下可以表现出催化活性。例如，CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物可以用作催化剂，但它们的性能可能不如贵金属。这些催化剂在某些反应中可能有效，但在更严格的条件下可能需要更高的操作温度。

3. 这些催化剂在不同工业应用中的应用范围广泛。贵金属催化剂，如铂，通常在要求高选择性和效率的行业，如石油化学加工中使用。金属氧化物催化剂往往在成本效益较高的应用中使用，如小型规模或新兴技术。

4. 最近的研究集中在提高两种类型催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的开发上。对于贵金属，努力通过提高其分散性和控制表面化学来优化性能。对于金属氧化物，研究人员致力于开发新材料或修改现有材料，以提高其催化活性和耐用性。

5. 贵金属催化剂的优势包括优越的活性、选择性和稳定性，但它们伴随着高成本和潜在的环境问题，由于它们的稀缺性。金属氧化物催化剂提供了更经济的选择，可能使更广泛的工业采用成为可能。然而，为了在特定应用中实现竞争性性能，它们可能需要进行优化。

为了确定任何催化剂系统中是否发生重新分散，需要使用两种不同方法进行化学吸附测量。当使用Pt/y-Al203系统并在氧化时加入氯化物时观察到显著增加的分散度，表明金属氧化物和支持之间存在强相互作用，从而促进重新分散。这种机制可以归因于铂氧化物的扩散和迁移物种在支持上的捕获，这是理解在各种条件下催化剂重新分散能力的关键方面。

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we observe distinct characteristics across their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. 

Platinum catalysts exhibit superior redispersion properties, especially when treated in oxygen below 600°C. This is attributed to the formation of a strong complex between the platinum oxide and the support material, notably alumina. The presence of chlorine during oxidation significantly enhances this redispersion process, offering an advantage in regenerating sintered catalysts. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon, based on the molecular migration model, explains how spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species contribute to the redispersion process.

In contrast, metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides typically do not undergo redispersion under standard conditions. These catalysts may require specific conditions, such as the presence of chlorine during oxidation, to achieve redispersion. The effectiveness of these catalysts varies depending on factors such as the type of metal oxide, its interaction with the support, and the specific reaction conditions. Industrial applications of these catalysts often focus on reactions requiring high stability and specific selectivity, where the metal oxide's inherent properties offer advantages.

Recent developments in both categories of catalysts aim to improve efficiency, selectivity, and stability. For noble metal catalysts, research focuses on enhancing redispersion capabilities and developing catalysts with improved activity and longevity. Metal oxide catalysts see advancements in optimizing the balance between stability and reactivity, as well as exploring novel synthesis routes to tailor their properties for specific applications.

Potential advantages of noble metal catalysts include superior activity and selectivity in certain reactions, while metal oxide catalysts benefit from their stability and robustness under harsh conditions. The choice between these catalyst types depends on the specific requirements of the chemical process, including reaction conditions, product specifications, and economic considerations.

Advancements in understanding the underlying mechanisms, such as redispersion and metal-support interactions, contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的催化剂中，特别是铂和金属氧化物（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的比较，我们观察到它们在组成、有效性、工业应用、最近发展和潜在优势方面的显著差异。

铂催化剂在低于600°C的氧气处理下表现出卓越的再分散特性。这归因于铂氧化物与支撑材料之间形成的强复合物，尤其是对氧化铝。在氧化条件下添加氯可以显著增强这一再分散过程，为再生烧结催化剂提供了优势。根据分子迁移模型机制解释的现象，说明了如何通过铂氧化物的扩散和迁移物种的捕获来实现再分散过程。

相比之下，金属氧化物催化剂如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物通常在标准条件下不经历再分散。这些催化剂可能需要特定条件，如氧化期间添加氯，以实现再分散。这些催化剂的有效性取决于金属氧化物的类型、它与支撑材料的相互作用以及具体反应条件。工业应用中，这些催化剂常用于要求高稳定性和特定选择性的反应，其中金属氧化物的内在性质提供优势。

近年来，在这两个催化剂类别中都取得了进展，旨在提高效率、选择性和稳定性。对于贵金属催化剂，研究集中在提高再分散能力，并开发具有改进活性和寿命的催化剂。金属氧化物催化剂的发展集中在优化稳定性和反应性之间的平衡，以及探索新的合成途径来定制其性质以满足特定应用需求。

贵金属催化剂的优势在于某些反应中的优越活性和选择性，而金属氧化物催化剂则受益于其在苛刻条件下的稳定性和坚固性。选择这两种催化剂类型取决于化学过程的具体需求，包括反应条件、产品规格和经济考虑。

对基本机制的理解进展，如再分散和金属-支撑相互作用，有助于开发更高效、更可持续的催化过程。
