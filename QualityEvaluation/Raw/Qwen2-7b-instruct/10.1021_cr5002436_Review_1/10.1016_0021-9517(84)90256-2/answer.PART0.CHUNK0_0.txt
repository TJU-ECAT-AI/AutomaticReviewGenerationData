[1] "Although supported metal catalysts are thermally stable in general, changes in metal surface area still occur with use or treatment for a long period at elevated temperature. The resulting loss of metal surface area generally leads to a decrease in catalytic activity and, very often, to a change in the reaction selectivity (I), and it is necessary to restore the original activity of sintered catalysts by a regeneration process, termed redispersion (2)."
[2] "The objectives of this study are three-fold: first, to obtain some answers to the above questions; second, to select reasonable mechanisms; and third, to search for a simple method for determining whether or not, and under what conditions, the redisper- sion occurs."
[3] "Dispersion for Ptly-Al203 increases after treatment in oxygen below 600C. For Pt/ SiOz redispersion does not occur under any condition covered in this study. In the case of Pt/TiOz, redispersion occurs only in the presence of chlorine during oxidation."
[4] "The addition of chlorine during oxidation enhances redispersion, while the addition of water inhibits redispersion."
[5] "Redispersion can occur only under a condition in which interaction is strong enough to produce surface complex between the platinum oxide and the support."
[6] "The mechanism for redispersion (2, 24) based on the molecular migration model which involves spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species can best account for results obtained in this study."

The document focuses on the redispersion of supported platinum catalysts, particularly Pt supported on aluminum oxide, silica, and titanium oxide. It discusses the effects of various treatments on the dispersion of these catalysts, including changes in surface area and activity. Redispersion refers to the process of increasing the dispersion of metal particles on the support, which can enhance the catalyst's performance. The document highlights the importance of chlorine during oxidation in enhancing redispersion, while water inhibits this process. The formation of a surface complex between platinum oxide and the support is essential for redispersion to occur. The molecular migration model explains the spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species, providing a mechanism for redispersion.

本文主要关注支持型铂催化剂的再分散，特别是铝氧化物、硅酸盐和钛氧化物支持的铂。它讨论了这些催化剂在不同处理下的分散变化，包括表面面积和活性的变化。再分散指的是增加金属粒子在支撑上的分散度的过程，这可以增强催化剂的性能。文档强调了氧化过程中氯化物对再分散的促进作用，而水抑制这一过程。铂氧化物与支撑形成表面复合物是再分散发生的必要条件。分子迁移模型解释了铂氧化物的扩散和迁移物种的捕获，为再分散提供了一个机制。
