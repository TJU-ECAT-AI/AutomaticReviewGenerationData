[1] "The objectives of this study are three-fold: first, to obtain some answers to the above questions; second, to select reasonable mechanisms; and third, to search for a simple method for determining whether or not, and under what conditions, the redisper- sion occurs."
[2] "The addition of chlorine during oxidation under the redispersion condition brought about a significant increase in dispersion."
[3] "For systems other than Ptl-y-A1203, however, hydrogen up- takes after reduction never exceed those before reduction. Therefore, if one were to determine whether redispersion occurs or not for any system, chemisorption mea- surements with two different methods are needed."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, several aspects can be highlighted:

1. Platinum is a noble metal known for its exceptional catalytic properties in various chemical reactions, including the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Its effectiveness lies in its ability to facilitate the conversion of olefins into alkynes, alkenes, or alkanes without undergoing oxidation. Platinum catalysts are often used in industrial processes due to their high efficiency and stability.

2. Metal oxides, on the other hand, are typically cheaper and more readily available than noble metals. They can exhibit catalytic activity depending on the specific metal and its oxidation state. For instance, CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides can be used as catalysts, but their performance might not match that of noble metals. These catalysts can be effective in certain reactions but might require higher operating temperatures or more rigorous conditions.

3. Industrial applications of these catalysts vary widely. Noble metal catalysts, such as platinum, are commonly employed in industries requiring high selectivity and efficiency, such as petrochemical processing. Metal oxide catalysts are often utilized in applications where cost-effectiveness is crucial, such as in smaller-scale or emerging technologies.

4. Recent developments in the field focus on improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of both types of catalysts. For noble metals, efforts aim at enhancing their dispersion and controlling the surface chemistry to optimize performance. For metal oxides, researchers strive to develop new materials or modify existing ones to improve their catalytic activity and durability.

5. Potential advantages of noble metal catalysts include superior activity, selectivity, and stability, but they come with high costs and potential environmental concerns due to their scarcity. Metal oxide catalysts offer a more affordable alternative, potentially enabling broader industrial adoption. However, they may require optimization for specific applications to achieve competitive performance.

To determine whether redispersion occurs for any catalyst system, chemisorption measurements using two different methods are essential. The presence of a significant increase in dispersion, particularly when using the Pt/y-Al203 system in the presence of chlorine during oxidation, suggests a strong interaction between the metal oxide and the support, facilitating redispersion. This mechanism can be attributed to the spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species, which is a key aspect in understanding the redisper- sion capacity of catalysts under various conditions.

比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，与金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）之间的几个方面：

1. 铂是一种贵金属，因其在各种化学反应中的卓越催化性能而闻名，包括轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。其有效性在于能够促进烯烃转化为炔、烯或烷，而不进行氧化。铂催化剂通常在工业过程中使用，因为它们具有高效率和稳定性。

2. 金属氧化物通常比贵金属更便宜且更容易获得。它们在特定金属及其氧化态下可以表现出催化活性。例如，CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物可以用作催化剂，但它们的性能可能不如贵金属。这些催化剂在某些反应中可能有效，但在更严格的条件下可能需要更高的操作温度。

3. 这些催化剂在不同工业应用中的应用范围广泛。贵金属催化剂，如铂，通常在要求高选择性和效率的行业，如石油化学加工中使用。金属氧化物催化剂往往在成本效益较高的应用中使用，如小型规模或新兴技术。

4. 最近的研究集中在提高两种类型催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的开发上。对于贵金属，努力通过提高其分散性和控制表面化学来优化性能。对于金属氧化物，研究人员致力于开发新材料或修改现有材料，以提高其催化活性和耐用性。

5. 贵金属催化剂的优势包括优越的活性、选择性和稳定性，但它们伴随着高成本和潜在的环境问题，由于它们的稀缺性。金属氧化物催化剂提供了更经济的选择，可能使更广泛的工业采用成为可能。然而，为了在特定应用中实现竞争性性能，它们可能需要进行优化。

为了确定任何催化剂系统中是否发生重新分散，需要使用两种不同方法进行化学吸附测量。当使用Pt/y-Al203系统并在氧化时加入氯化物时观察到显著增加的分散度，表明金属氧化物和支持之间存在强相互作用，从而促进重新分散。这种机制可以归因于铂氧化物的扩散和迁移物种在支持上的捕获，这是理解在各种条件下催化剂重新分散能力的关键方面。
