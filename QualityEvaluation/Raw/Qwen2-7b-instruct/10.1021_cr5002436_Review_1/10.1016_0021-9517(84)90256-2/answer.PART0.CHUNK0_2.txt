[1] "The redispersion of platinum on y-Alr03, SiOr, and TiOz is experimentally studied by means of hydrogen chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-pro- grammed reduction, and cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The objectives of this study are three-fold: first, to obtain some answers to the above questions; second, to select reasonable mechanisms; and third, to search for a simple method for determining whether or not, and under what conditions, the redisper- sion occurs."
[3] "For all catalysts the dispersion decreases drastically after treat- ment above 600C."
[4] "Redispersion can occur only in the presence of platinum oxide which could be stabilized by forming a complex with the support."
[5] "The addition of chlorine during oxidation enhances redispersion, while the addition of water inhibits redispersion."
[6] "Redispersion can occur only under a condition in which interaction is strong enough to produce surface complex between the platinum oxide and the support."
[7] "The mechanism for redispersion (2, 24) based on the molecular migration model which involves spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species can best account for results obtained in this study."

1. The document focuses on studying the redispersion of noble metal-based catalysts (specifically platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It discusses their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field.

2. The study uses techniques like hydrogen chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed reduction, and cyclohexene hydrogenation reactions to analyze the redispersion of platinum on y-Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2.

3. The document reveals that the dispersion of catalysts decreases significantly when treated above 600°C.

4. It explains that redispersion is possible only when there is a strong interaction between the platinum oxide and the support, allowing the formation of a complex that stabilizes the platinum oxide.

5. The addition of chlorine during oxidation promotes redispersion, while water hinders this process.

6. The document states that redispersion occurs only under conditions where the interaction is strong enough to produce a surface complex between the platinum oxide and the support.

7. The molecular migration model, involving the spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species, is the best explanation for the observed redispersion in this study.
