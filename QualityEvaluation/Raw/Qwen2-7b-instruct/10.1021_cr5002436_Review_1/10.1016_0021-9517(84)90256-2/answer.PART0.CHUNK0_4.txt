[1] "The redispersion of platinum on y-Alr03, SiOr, and TiOz is experimentally studied by means of hydrogen chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-pro- grammed reduction, and cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The objectives of this study are three- fold: first, to obtain some answers to the above questions; second, to select reason- able mechanisms; and third, to search for a simple method for determining whether or not, and under what conditions, the redis- persion occurs."
[3] "For all catalysts the dispersion decreases drastically after treat- ment above 600C."

[6] "From the results of TPR it is known that Ptl-y-Al203 exhibits stronger interaction between the metal and the support as compared with Pt/Si02 and Pt/TiOZ."
[7] "Redispersion can occur only under a con- dition in which interaction is strong enough to produce surface complex between the platinum oxide and the support."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we observe distinct characteristics across their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. 

Platinum catalysts exhibit superior redispersion properties, especially when treated in oxygen below 600°C. This is attributed to the formation of a strong complex between the platinum oxide and the support material, notably alumina. The presence of chlorine during oxidation significantly enhances this redispersion process, offering an advantage in regenerating sintered catalysts. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon, based on the molecular migration model, explains how spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of migrating species contribute to the redispersion process.

In contrast, metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides typically do not undergo redispersion under standard conditions. These catalysts may require specific conditions, such as the presence of chlorine during oxidation, to achieve redispersion. The effectiveness of these catalysts varies depending on factors such as the type of metal oxide, its interaction with the support, and the specific reaction conditions. Industrial applications of these catalysts often focus on reactions requiring high stability and specific selectivity, where the metal oxide's inherent properties offer advantages.

Recent developments in both categories of catalysts aim to improve efficiency, selectivity, and stability. For noble metal catalysts, research focuses on enhancing redispersion capabilities and developing catalysts with improved activity and longevity. Metal oxide catalysts see advancements in optimizing the balance between stability and reactivity, as well as exploring novel synthesis routes to tailor their properties for specific applications.

Potential advantages of noble metal catalysts include superior activity and selectivity in certain reactions, while metal oxide catalysts benefit from their stability and robustness under harsh conditions. The choice between these catalyst types depends on the specific requirements of the chemical process, including reaction conditions, product specifications, and economic considerations.

Advancements in understanding the underlying mechanisms, such as redispersion and metal-support interactions, contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的催化剂中，特别是铂和金属氧化物（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的比较，我们观察到它们在组成、有效性、工业应用、最近发展和潜在优势方面的显著差异。

铂催化剂在低于600°C的氧气处理下表现出卓越的再分散特性。这归因于铂氧化物与支撑材料之间形成的强复合物，尤其是对氧化铝。在氧化条件下添加氯可以显著增强这一再分散过程，为再生烧结催化剂提供了优势。根据分子迁移模型机制解释的现象，说明了如何通过铂氧化物的扩散和迁移物种的捕获来实现再分散过程。

相比之下，金属氧化物催化剂如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物通常在标准条件下不经历再分散。这些催化剂可能需要特定条件，如氧化期间添加氯，以实现再分散。这些催化剂的有效性取决于金属氧化物的类型、它与支撑材料的相互作用以及具体反应条件。工业应用中，这些催化剂常用于要求高稳定性和特定选择性的反应，其中金属氧化物的内在性质提供优势。

近年来，在这两个催化剂类别中都取得了进展，旨在提高效率、选择性和稳定性。对于贵金属催化剂，研究集中在提高再分散能力，并开发具有改进活性和寿命的催化剂。金属氧化物催化剂的发展集中在优化稳定性和反应性之间的平衡，以及探索新的合成途径来定制其性质以满足特定应用需求。

贵金属催化剂的优势在于某些反应中的优越活性和选择性，而金属氧化物催化剂则受益于其在苛刻条件下的稳定性和坚固性。选择这两种催化剂类型取决于化学过程的具体需求，包括反应条件、产品规格和经济考虑。

对基本机制的理解进展，如再分散和金属-支撑相互作用，有助于开发更高效、更可持续的催化过程。
