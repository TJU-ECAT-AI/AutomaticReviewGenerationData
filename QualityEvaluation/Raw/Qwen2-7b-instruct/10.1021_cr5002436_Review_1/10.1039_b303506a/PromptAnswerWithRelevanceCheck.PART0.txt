The literature compares noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metals like Platinum are extensively utilized in petrochemical and refining processes due to their catalytic properties. Metal oxides such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides offer alternative catalytic options. Platinum-based catalysts typically exhibit high selectivity and stability in alkane dehydrogenation, surpassing other materials in terms of efficiency and longevity. Metal oxides, however, may offer distinct advantages, including enhanced stability under certain conditions, reduced deactivation rates, and improved selectivity in specific reactions. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst performance through optimized compositions, enhanced dispersion, and regeneration methods that preserve catalyst integrity and activity. The literature highlights the benefits of Platinum catalysts in achieving high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unparalleled stability in dehydrogenation processes. Metal oxides, on the other hand, are noted for their ability to maintain stability and catalytic activity through mild oxidative treatments, offering potential for sustainable and efficient dehydrogenation processes.

The literature discusses various noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Among the noble metals, platinum (Pt) stands out due to its widespread use in petrochemical and refining processes, including alkane dehydrogenation. Platinum-based materials often show enhanced stability and selectivity, particularly when paired with tin (Sn) or incorporated into specific frameworks like Na-[Fe]ZSM5, which can offer higher alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability. In comparison to metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, platinum-based catalysts generally exhibit superior performance in terms of reaction rates, stability, and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. Recent developments have focused on improving catalyst stability and selectivity through the use of specific frameworks and metal combinations. The advantage of platinum-based catalysts lies in their ability to maintain high dispersion, zeolite crystallinity, and catalytic selectivities even after regeneration, allowing for efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation processes without compromising on the desired product yields or purity.

The literature discusses a novel catalyst composed of active, selective, and stable Pt clusters embedded in a Na-[Fe]ZSM5 matrix. This catalyst is specifically designed for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, offering unprecedented stability and selectivity compared to traditional platinum-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts. The catalyst's unique structure allows for high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and significantly improved stability in the process of alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments in this area involve the use of a novel catalyst that utilizes Pt clusters in a Na-[Fe]ZSM5 matrix, which provides high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and higher turnover rates and stability than previously reported. The catalyst is particularly effective in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane, with high selectivities and stability. It achieves these improvements without relying on bimetallic clusters, which can unmix during oxidative regenerations, and without requiring significant hydrogen partial pressures in alkane reactant streams.

The novel catalyst has been successfully regenerated using mild-oxidative treatments, demonstrating its ability to maintain initial rates, selectivities, and stability, as well as its resistance to undesired side reactions. The catalyst's performance surpasses that of state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts, making it a promising development in the field of petrochemical and refining processes.

The literature does not directly compare other noble metal-based catalysts (such as gold, palladium, or rhodium) or metal oxide-based catalysts (like chromium oxide, gallium oxide, indium oxide, vanadium oxide, zinc oxide, or molybdenum oxide) with the Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst in terms of their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. However, the focus on the Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst highlights its unique properties that set it apart in the field of alkane dehydrogenation.
