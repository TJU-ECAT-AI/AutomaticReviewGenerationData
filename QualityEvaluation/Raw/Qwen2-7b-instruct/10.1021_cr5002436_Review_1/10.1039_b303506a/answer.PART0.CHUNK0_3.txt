[1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, such as alkane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Here, we report a novel catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Forward reaction rates (rf) were obtained from measured rates (rnet) using rf = rnet/(1 2 h), where the approach to equilibrium (h) depends on reaction thermodynamics and on prevalent pressures of reactants and products."
[4] "Deactivation rate constants during C3H8 dehydrogenation are more than ten times smaller than on PtSn."
[5] "Non-acidic supports and PtSn clusters led to higher stability and C3H6 selectivity than Pt clusters on g-Al2O3 or SiO2 supports."
[6] "These catalysts were more stable (t  20 h) than Pt Sn/g-Al2O3 (t = 9 h) but much less stable than Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 (t = 125 h, Table 2)."
[7] "We achieve these improvements without relying on bimetallic clusters, which can unmix during oxidative regenerations, and without significant H2 partial pressures in alkane reactant streams."

The document highlights the use of platinum-based materials in petrochemical and refining processes, particularly in alkane dehydrogenation. It reports on a novel catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the deactivation rate constants during C3H8 dehydrogenation on different catalysts and the role of non-acidic supports and PtSn clusters in achieving higher stability and C3H6 selectivity. It also mentions that the catalyst Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 is more stable than other catalysts, especially PtSn/g-Al2O3, and that the catalysts achieve improvements without relying on bimetallic clusters and significant hydrogen partial pressures in alkane reactant streams.

文档提到了铂基材料在石油化工和精炼过程中的广泛应用，特别是在轻烷烃脱氢。它报告了一种新型催化剂，在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢方面具有前所未有的活性和稳定性。文档讨论了不同催化剂在C3H8脱氢过程中的脱活速率常数，并阐述了非酸性支持物和PtSn簇在实现更高稳定性和C3H6选择性方面的作用。还提到催化剂Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5比其他催化剂更稳定，尤其是PtSn/g-Al2O3，而且这些催化剂在不依赖双金属簇和烷烃反应流中显著氢分压的情况下实现了改进。
