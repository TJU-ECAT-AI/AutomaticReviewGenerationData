[1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, such as alkane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Non-acidic supports and PtSn clusters led to higher stability and C3H6 selectivity than Pt clusters on g-Al2O3 or SiO2 supports."
[3] "Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 gave substantially higher reaction rates and catalyst stability than these state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts."
[4] "These novel materials can be fully regenerated using mild-oxidative treatments without a detectable decrease in Pt dispersion, zeolite crystallinity, or catalytic selectivities and to lower rates of undesired side reactions."

The literature discusses various noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Among the noble metals, platinum (Pt) stands out due to its widespread use in petrochemical and refining processes, including alkane dehydrogenation. Platinum-based materials often show enhanced stability and selectivity, particularly when paired with tin (Sn) or incorporated into specific frameworks like Na-[Fe]ZSM5, which can offer higher alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability. In comparison to metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, platinum-based catalysts generally exhibit superior performance in terms of reaction rates, stability, and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. Recent developments have focused on improving catalyst stability and selectivity through the use of specific frameworks and metal combinations. The advantage of platinum-based catalysts lies in their ability to maintain high dispersion, zeolite crystallinity, and catalytic selectivities even after regeneration, allowing for efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation processes without compromising on the desired product yields or purity.

文献讨论了用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的各种贵金属催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂。在贵金属中，铂（Pt）因其广泛应用于石油化工和精炼过程，如烷烃脱氢而备受关注。铂基材料通常表现出增强的稳定性和选择性，特别是当与锡（Sn）结合或嵌入特定框架如Na-[Fe]ZSM5时，可以提供高双键选择性、接近平衡的双键产率以及前所未有的稳定性。与金属氧化物催化剂（如铬氧化物（CrOx）、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）相比，铂基催化剂在脱氢反应中通常显示出更高的反应速率、稳定性和选择性。最近的研究重点是通过使用特定的框架和金属组合来提高催化剂的稳定性与选择性。铂基催化剂的优势在于即使经过再生后，仍能保持高分散度、沸石结晶性和催化选择性，从而实现高效的可持续脱氢过程，同时不影响所需产物的产率或纯度。
