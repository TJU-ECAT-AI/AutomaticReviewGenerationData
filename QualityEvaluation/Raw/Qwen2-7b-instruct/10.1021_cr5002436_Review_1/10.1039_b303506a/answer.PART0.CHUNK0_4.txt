The literature discusses a novel catalyst composed of active, selective, and stable Pt clusters embedded in a Na-[Fe]ZSM5 matrix. This catalyst is specifically designed for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, offering unprecedented stability and selectivity compared to traditional platinum-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts. The catalyst's unique structure allows for high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and significantly improved stability in the process of alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments in this area involve the use of a novel catalyst that utilizes Pt clusters in a Na-[Fe]ZSM5 matrix, which provides high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and higher turnover rates and stability than previously reported. The catalyst is particularly effective in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane, with high selectivities and stability. It achieves these improvements without relying on bimetallic clusters, which can unmix during oxidative regenerations, and without requiring significant hydrogen partial pressures in alkane reactant streams.

The novel catalyst has been successfully regenerated using mild-oxidative treatments, demonstrating its ability to maintain initial rates, selectivities, and stability, as well as its resistance to undesired side reactions. The catalyst's performance surpasses that of state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts, making it a promising development in the field of petrochemical and refining processes.

The literature does not directly compare other noble metal-based catalysts (such as gold, palladium, or rhodium) or metal oxide-based catalysts (like chromium oxide, gallium oxide, indium oxide, vanadium oxide, zinc oxide, or molybdenum oxide) with the Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst in terms of their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. However, the focus on the Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst highlights its unique properties that set it apart in the field of alkane dehydrogenation.
