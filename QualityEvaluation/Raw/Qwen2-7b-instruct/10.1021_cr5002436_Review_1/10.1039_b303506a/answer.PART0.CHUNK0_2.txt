1. Platinum-based materials are commonly utilized in various petrochemical and refining processes, notably for alkane dehydrogenation.

2. The Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst stands out due to its exceptional activity, selectivity, and stability in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

3. The deactivation rate constants observed during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 are notably lower on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 compared to other materials.

4. A novel catalyst with unparalleled site activity and stability has been developed specifically for the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane.

5. The forward reaction rate (rf) can be calculated from the measured rate (rnet) using the formula rf = rnet/(1 - h), where 'h' represents the approach to equilibrium, influenced by the thermodynamics of the reaction and the prevailing pressures of reactants and products.

6. The catalyst's performance benefits from its design that avoids issues associated with bimetallic clusters, which might unmix during oxidative regeneration processes, and its ability to operate under minimal hydrogen partial pressures in alkane reactant streams.
