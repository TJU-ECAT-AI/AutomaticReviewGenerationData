[1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, such as alkane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Non-acidic supports and PtSn clusters led to higher stability and C3H6 selectivity than Pt clusters on g-Al2O3 or SiO2 supports."
[3] "We achieve these improvements without relying on bimetallic clusters, which can unmix during oxidative regenerations, and without significant H2 partial pressures in alkane reactant streams."
[4] "These novel materials can be fully regenerated using mild-oxidative treatments without a detectable decrease in Pt dispersion, zeolite crystallinity, or catalytic selectivities and to lower rates of undesired side reactions."

The literature compares noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metals like Platinum are extensively utilized in petrochemical and refining processes due to their catalytic properties. Metal oxides such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides offer alternative catalytic options. Platinum-based catalysts typically exhibit high selectivity and stability in alkane dehydrogenation, surpassing other materials in terms of efficiency and longevity. Metal oxides, however, may offer distinct advantages, including enhanced stability under certain conditions, reduced deactivation rates, and improved selectivity in specific reactions. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst performance through optimized compositions, enhanced dispersion, and regeneration methods that preserve catalyst integrity and activity. The literature highlights the benefits of Platinum catalysts in achieving high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unparalleled stability in dehydrogenation processes. Metal oxides, on the other hand, are noted for their ability to maintain stability and catalytic activity through mild oxidative treatments, offering potential for sustainable and efficient dehydrogenation processes.
