The comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals several key differences. Noble metal catalysts, notably platinum, demonstrated superior activity and selectivity compared to metal oxide catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Recent advancements have concentrated on enhancing the stability and performance of noble metal catalysts through the employment of supports like mesoporous silica. Metal oxide-based catalysts generally showed lower activity and selectivity, with indium oxide exhibiting higher activity than gallium and vanadium oxides but still falling short of noble metals. CrOx catalysts were identified as less stable with reduced selectivity for the desired product, while molybdenum oxide catalysts displayed moderate activity but were noted for their high toxicity.

在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中，贵金属基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂之间的对比揭示了几个关键差异。特别是铂，贵金属催化剂在活性和选择性方面明显优于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。最近的发展集中在通过使用如介孔二氧化硅这样的支持物来提高贵金属催化剂的稳定性和性能上。金属氧化物基催化剂通常显示出较低的活性和选择性，其中，铟氧化物的活性高于镓和钒氧化物，但仍低于贵金属。CrOx催化剂被发现稳定性较差，并且对所需产物的选择性较低，而钼氧化物催化剂表现出适度的活性，但因其高毒性而受到关注。
