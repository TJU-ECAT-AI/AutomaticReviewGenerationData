The document discusses the hydrothermal growth of mesoporous SBA-15 silica with PVP-stabilized platinum nanoparticles as a catalyst for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It compares noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.
