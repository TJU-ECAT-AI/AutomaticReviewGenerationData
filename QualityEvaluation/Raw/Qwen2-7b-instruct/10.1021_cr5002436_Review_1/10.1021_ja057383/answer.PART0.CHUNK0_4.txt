1. The study focused on the hydrothermal growth of mesoporous SBA-15 silica in the presence of PVP-stabilized platinum nanoparticles. These catalysts were evaluated for their effectiveness in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts showed higher activity than metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Recent developments include the use of PVP-stabilized platinum nanoparticles on mesoporous SBA-15 silica, which demonstrated improved stability and selectivity compared to traditional metal oxide-based catalysts. Industrial applications of these catalysts include petrochemical processes, such as reforming and cracking.
