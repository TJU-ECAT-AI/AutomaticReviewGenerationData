[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane is important because of growing demand for isobutene as a precursor for the production of oxygenates required in reformulated gasoline."
[2] "It was found that supporting tin and platinum in K-L-zeolite produces catalysts that exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Furthermore, Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high resistance to deactivation at conditions conducive to high dehydrogenation conversions."
[4] "Fundamental investigations of silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts show that tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles, which reduces the size of surface Pt ensembles and inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species required for the competing isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coking reactions."
[5] "Similarly, the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 increases the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation by further reducing the size of surface Pt ensembles."
[6] "It has been shown that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydrogenation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst deactivation."
[7] "The properties of this highly selective dehydrogenation catalyst may be attributed to the stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the L-zeolite pore in the presence of potassium."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The catalysts are supported on zeolites, with tin interacting with the platinum to form alloy particles. This reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles, inhibiting isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coking reactions. Potassium is added to further reduce the size of these ensembles, enhancing selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts are noted for their high activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation. The stabilization of small platinum particles in the zeolite pore, aided by potassium, is credited with these favorable properties. These catalysts offer an efficient way to produce isobutene, a precursor for reformulated gasoline.

文档讨论了在异丁烷脱氢中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂。这些催化剂被支持在沸石上，锡与铂结合形成合金颗粒。这减少了表面铂簇的尺寸，抑制了异构化、氢解和焦化反应。添加钾可以进一步减少表面铂簇的尺寸，增强异丁烷脱氢的选择性。铂/锡/钾-沸石催化剂因其高活性、高选择性和抗失活能力而受到关注。在钾的帮助下，在沸石孔中稳定较小的铂颗粒被认为是这些有利性质的原因。这些催化剂提供了一种高效生产异丁烯的方法，异丁烯是重整汽油的前体。
