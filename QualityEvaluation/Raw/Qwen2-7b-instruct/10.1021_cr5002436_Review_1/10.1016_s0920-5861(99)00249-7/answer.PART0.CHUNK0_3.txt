The document focuses on the use of supported Pt/Sn catalysts for the selective dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, highlighting the role of tin and potassium in improving catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. Tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles, reducing the size of surface Pt ensembles and inhibiting isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coking reactions. Potassium further reduces the size of surface Pt ensembles, enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation under conditions of low hydrogen partial pressures and moderate temperatures.

文档专注于使用支持的Pt/Sn催化剂进行异丁烷的选择性脱氢至异丁烯，强调锡和钾在提高催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性方面的作用。锡与铂形成Pt/Sn合金颗粒，减少表面铂簇的尺寸并抑制异构化、氢解和结焦反应。钾进一步减少表面铂簇的尺寸，增强脱氢选择性。Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂表现出高脱氢活性、选择性和在较低氢分压和中等温度下的抗失活能力。
