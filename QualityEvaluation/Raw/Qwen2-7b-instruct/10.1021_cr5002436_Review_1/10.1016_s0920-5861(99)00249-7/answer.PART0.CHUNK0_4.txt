1. The dehydrogenation of isobutane is crucial due to the rising demand for isobutene as a precursor for oxygenates in reformulated gasoline. 

2. Supporting tin and platinum in a potassium form of L-zeolite creates a catalyst that efficiently dehydrogenates isobutane with high activity and selectivity.

3. Adding tin to silica-supported platinum diminishes the initial heat of ethylene adsorption.

4. Potassium added to the Pt/Sn/SiO2 system boosts the isobutane dehydrogenation rate, improves selectivity, and strengthens the catalyst's resistance against deactivation.

5. Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts are noted for their exceptional dehydrogenation activity, selectivity, and durability against deactivation.

6. Previous research indicates that hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions are hindered over small platinum particles.
