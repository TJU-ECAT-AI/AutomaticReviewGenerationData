[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane is important because of growing demand for isobutene as a precursor for the production of oxygenates required in reformulated gasoline."
[2] "It was found that supporting tin and platinum in K-L-zeolite produces catalysts that exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Furthermore, Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high resistance to deactivation at conditions conducive to high dehydrogenation conversions."
[4] "Fundamental investigations of silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts show that tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles, which reduces the size of surface Pt ensembles and inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species required for the competing isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coking reactions."
[5] "Similarly, the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 increases the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation by further reducing the size of surface Pt ensembles."
[6] "It has been shown that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydrogenation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst deactivation."
[7] "The properties of this highly selective dehydrogenation catalyst may be attributed to the stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the L-zeolite pore in the presence of potassium."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The catalysts are supported on zeolites, with tin interacting with the platinum to form alloy particles. This reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles, inhibiting isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coking reactions. Potassium is added to further reduce the size of these ensembles, enhancing selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation. The Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts are noted for their high activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation. The stabilization of small platinum particles in the zeolite pore, aided by potassium, is credited with these favorable properties. These catalysts offer an efficient way to produce isobutene, a precursor for reformulated gasoline.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals distinct differences in their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages. Platinum-based catalysts, when supported in zeolites like K-L-zeolite, offer high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation due to the formation of Pt/Sn alloy particles. This reduces the size of surface Pt ensembles, inhibits isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, and enhances dehydrogenation selectivity. Metal oxide catalysts, such as CrOx, often require harsher operating conditions and may suffer from deactivation due to coke formation, whereas noble metals like Platinum can maintain stability and selectivity even under reducing conditions. Recent developments in Platinum-based catalysts focus on improving stability and selectivity through the addition of modifiers like potassium. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, continue to be researched for cost-effectiveness and robustness against deactivation. Industrial applications of these catalysts are crucial for the production of oxygenates required in reformulated gasoline, with Platinum-based catalysts showing promise in maintaining high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity at lower hydrogen pressures and moderate temperatures.

比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物），在发现将锡和铂支持在K-L沸石中产生表现出高活性和异丁烷脱氢选择性的催化剂后，揭示了它们在组成、有效性、工业应用、最近发展和潜在优势方面的不同之处。当铂基催化剂在K-L沸石中支持时，由于形成了Pt/Sn合金颗粒，对于异丁烷脱氢显示出高活性和选择性。这减少了表面铂簇的大小，抑制了异构化和氢解反应，并提高了脱氢选择性。金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx，通常需要更苛刻的操作条件，并且可能因焦炭形成而失效，而像铂这样的贵金属即使在还原条件下也能保持稳定性和选择性。铂基催化剂的近期发展集中在通过添加钾等修饰剂来提高稳定性和选择性。金属氧化物催化剂继续研究其成本效益和对失活的耐受性。这些催化剂的工业应用对于生产用于调和汽油的氧源至关重要，铂基催化剂在低氢压力和适度温度下显示出了维持高脱氢活性和选择性的潜力。

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition of the catalysts is influenced by the specific metals used, with Platinum-based catalysts showing high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation due to its ability to interact with tin to form Pt/Sn alloy particles. The size of these surface platinum ensembles is reduced, which inhibits isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions and enhances dehydrogenation selectivity. The addition of potassium to the catalyst further reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles, suppressing isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions and enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. The literature also mentions that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydrogenation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst deactivation. Industrial applications of these catalysts include the production of oxygenates required in reformulated gasoline. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst stability and activity, especially in the presence of hydrogen, to reduce deactivation and enhance dehydrogenation rates. The potential advantages include higher efficiency and selectivity in the production of valuable hydrocarbons, particularly isobutene, which is a precursor for the production of oxygenates in reformulated gasoline.
