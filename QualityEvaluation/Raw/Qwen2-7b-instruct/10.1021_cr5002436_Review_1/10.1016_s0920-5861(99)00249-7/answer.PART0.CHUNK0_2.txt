"Catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane is important because of growing demand for isobutene as a precursor for the production of oxygenates required in reformulated gasoline."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"It was found that supporting tin and platinum in K-L-zeolite produces catalysts that exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"Furthermore, Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high resistance to deactivation at conditions conducive to high dehydrogenation conversions."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"The addition of tin to silica-supported platinum reduces the initial heat of ethylene adsorption."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"The higher initial heat for ethylene adsorption on platinum surfaces at room temperature may be attributed to the dissociation of ethylene to form ethylidyne species and adsorbed hydrogen."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"The addition of tin suppresses the decomposition of adsorbed olefins to more highly-dehydrogenated species."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"The combined results of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can be explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"The average hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions rates were 2.5 times faster over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and 50 times faster over Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite compared to Pt/Sn/SiO2."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"As Fig. 5 shows, the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst deactivates in the presence of hydrogen at 873 K."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"In the TPO studies, the addition of tin to L-zeolite-supported platinum decreases the amount of deposited carbon."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"The combined results of Mssbauer spectroscopic, TEM, and kinetic investigations show that extended reduction of Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite at 873 K has detrimental effects on the catalytic performance of this material."
[Cortright et al., 2000]
"The isobutane dehydrogenation reaction rates were determined at 873 K, 0.33 atm isobutane pressure, and 0.67 atm hydrogen pressure over a 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst after 1 and 16 h pretreatments in flowing hydrogen at 873 K."

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition of the catalysts is influenced by the specific metals used, with Platinum-based catalysts showing high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation due to its ability to interact with tin to form Pt/Sn alloy particles. The size of these surface platinum ensembles is reduced, which inhibits isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions and enhances dehydrogenation selectivity. The addition of potassium to the catalyst further reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles, suppressing isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions and enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. The literature also mentions that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydrogenation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst deactivation. Industrial applications of these catalysts include the production of oxygenates required in reformulated gasoline. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst stability and activity, especially in the presence of hydrogen, to reduce deactivation and enhance dehydrogenation rates. The potential advantages include higher efficiency and selectivity in the production of valuable hydrocarbons, particularly isobutene, which is a precursor for the production of oxygenates in reformulated gasoline.

文献讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中使用贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物的应用。催化剂的组成受所用特定金属的影响，其中铂基催化剂因其能够与锡相互作用形成Pt/Sn合金颗粒而表现出高活性和选择性用于异丁烷脱氢。这些表面铂簇集的大小被减少，这抑制了异构化和氢解反应并增强了脱氢选择性。向催化剂中添加钾进一步减少了表面铂簇集的大小，抑制了异构化和氢解反应并增强了脱氢选择性。文献还提到Pt/Sn/K-L沸石催化剂具有高脱氢活性、高脱氢选择性和高催化剂失活抵抗力。工业应用包括生产用于重整汽油的氧气前体。近期发展集中在提高催化剂稳定性及活性，尤其是在氢气存在下，以减少失活并增强脱氢速率。潜在优势包括更高的效率和选择性地生产有价值的碳氢化合物，尤其是作为生产重整汽油所需氧气前体的异丁烯。
