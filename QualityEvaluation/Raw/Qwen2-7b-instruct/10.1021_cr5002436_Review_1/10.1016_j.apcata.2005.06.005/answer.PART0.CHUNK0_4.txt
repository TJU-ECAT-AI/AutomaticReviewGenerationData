[1] "In fact, DFT calculations for the adsorption of ethylene and formaldehyde on Pt(1 1 1), Pt3Zn(1 1 1) and PtZn(0 1 1) surfaces have demonstrated that addition of zinc to platinum weakens the adsorption of both olefinic (C C) and carbonyl (C O) bonds, but the effect is more important for the former."
[2] "The bimetallic catalysts showed enhanced selectivity towards the hydro- genation of the C O bond of crotonaldehyde as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst, although the catalytic activity was considerably reduced."
[3] "For this latter reaction, it has been shown that the catalytic performance depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly,on the interaction between platinum and tin species, both in the metallic state and in oxidised states."
[4] "In the field of selective hydrogenations, Consonni et al. have studied Pt/Zn catalysts in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, and they concluded that the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol) increased with the extent of alloy formation."
[5] "The results were explained on the basis of the formation of PtZn alloy phases after the reduction of Zn(II) species, which was observed to be favoured by the presence of the noble metal."
[6] "Furthermore, ZnO has n-type semiconductor character and thus, a strong interaction between platinum and ZnO can be expected."
[7] "It has been recently reported that Au/ZnO catalysts were also selective for the formation of crotyl alcohol in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
[8] "Selectivities to crotyl alcohol of about 70% were obtained during reaction at 523 K."

The document discusses the comparison between noble metal-based catalysts (primarily platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are characterized by their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages.

Platinum-based catalysts exhibit specific catalytic behavior changes when combined with zinc. DFT calculations demonstrate that zinc weakens the adsorption of both olefinic and carbonyl bonds, with a more significant impact on olefinic bonds. This leads to enhanced selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, particularly in the formation of unsaturated alcohols, as seen in the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. However, the catalytic activity is significantly reduced due to the formation of alloy phases after zinc reduction.

Metal oxide-based catalysts, including zinc oxide (ZnO), are noted for their semiconducting properties and ability to interact strongly with noble metals like platinum. These catalysts can be effective in selective hydrogenation reactions, such as the formation of crotyl alcohol in the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Recent studies have shown that Au/ZnO catalysts can achieve selectivities up to 82% under certain conditions, indicating the potential of metal oxide-based catalysts in enhancing catalytic performance.

In summary, the document highlights the unique roles of noble metals and metal oxides in catalysis, with particular emphasis on their interactions, selectivity enhancement, and application in nonoxidative dehydrogenation processes. The findings suggest promising advancements in catalyst design and optimization for industrial applications.

本文讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢反应中，贵金属催化剂（主要为铂）与金属氧化物催化剂之间的比较。这些催化剂通过其组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展以及潜在优势进行了描述。

铂基催化剂在与锌结合时表现出特定的催化行为变化。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，锌减弱了乙烯和甲醛在铂（1 1 1）、铂3锌（1 1 1）和铂锌（0 1 1）表面的吸附作用，其中对烯键的吸附影响更为显著。这导致了氢化反应中，尤其是不饱和醇的形成过程中，选择性增强。然而，由于锌还原后形成的合金相，铂的活性显著降低。

金属氧化物基催化剂，特别是锌氧化物（ZnO），因其半导体特性以及与贵金属如铂的强相互作用而受到关注。这些催化剂在选择性氢化反应中的应用潜力得到证明，例如，在蒸汽相氢化丙酮醛中形成不饱和醇。最近的研究表明，Au/ZnO催化剂在特定条件下可实现高达82%的选择性，显示了金属氧化物基催化剂在提高催化性能方面的潜力。

综上所述，本文强调了贵金属与金属氧化物在催化领域的独特作用，特别关注它们之间的相互作用、选择性增强及其在非氧化脱氢过程中的应用前景。研究结果暗示了催化剂设计和优化在工业应用方面的有希望的发展。
