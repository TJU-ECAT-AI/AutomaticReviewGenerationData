[1] "In fact, DFT calculations for the adsorption of ethylene and formaldehyde on Pt(1 1 1), Pt3Zn(1 1 1) and PtZn(0 1 1) surfaces have demonstrated that addition of zinc to platinum weakens the adsorption of both olefinic (C C) and carbonyl (C O) bonds, but the effect is more important for the former."
[2] "Furthermore, ZnO has n-type semiconductor character and thus, a strong interaction between platinum and ZnO can be expected."
[3] "The results were explained on the basis of the formation of PtZn alloy phases after the reduction of Zn(II) species, which was observed to be favoured by the presence of the noble metal."
[4] "The same authors have recently reported the catalytic behaviour of Ag/ZnO catalysts in the same reaction. Selectivities to crotyl alcohol of about 70% were obtained during reaction at 523 K."

The document does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts (like platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the catalytic behavior of platinum-based catalysts in relation to zinc. Zinc modifies the adsorption properties of platinum on surfaces, weakening the adsorption of both olefinic and carbonyl bonds, particularly olefinic bonds, due to its n-type semiconductor character. The presence of zinc favors the formation of PtZn alloy phases, enhancing the selectivity of platinum-zinc catalysts in the hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes. Additionally, the document mentions that silver/zinc oxide (Ag/ZnO) catalysts also exhibit selective hydrogenation, achieving selectivities to crotyl alcohol around 70% under certain conditions. These findings suggest that modifications to noble metal catalysts, like incorporating zinc, can improve their selectivity in specific reactions, including dehydrogenation. However, for a comprehensive comparison between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts, further detailed studies would be required.

文档没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）。然而，它确实讨论了铂基催化剂与锌的关系。锌改变了铂在表面的吸附性质，减弱了两者（烯烃和羰基）键的吸附，尤其是烯烃键，由于其n型半导体特性。铂锌合金相的存在促进了铂锌催化剂在不饱和醛氢化中的选择性。此外，文档提到银/锌氧化物（Ag/ZnO）催化剂在相同的反应中也表现出选择性的氢化，实现了约70%的对顺式醇的选择性，在特定条件下。这些发现表明，对贵金属催化剂进行修改，如引入锌，可以在某些反应中提高它们的选择性，包括脱氢反应。但是，为了进行全面比较贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂，需要进一步详细的研究。
