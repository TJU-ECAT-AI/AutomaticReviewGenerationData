[1] "This paper compares the catalytic behaviour of two activated carbon-supported catalysts, monometallic Pt and bimetallic PtZn, in two very different reactions: the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and the dehydrogenation of iso-butane."
[2] "Carbonaceous materials are being more and more frequently used as catalyst supports [30]. They contribute with a high surface area and, in bimetallic systems such as PtZn, their inertness favours the interaction between both metals, whereas undesired interactions with the support are avoided."
[3] "The reaction was carried out at a relatively high temperature (523 K), and a much higher selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol was found with Au/ZnO than with Au/SiO2 under the same reaction conditions."
[4] "Selectivities to crotyl alcohol of about 70% were obtained during reaction at 523 K [29]."

This study investigates the comparative catalytic behavior of monometallic platinum (Pt) and bimetallic platinum-zinc (PtZn) catalysts in two distinct reactions: the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and the dehydrogenation of iso-butane. Activated carbon serves as the support material, taking advantage of its high surface area. In bimetallic systems like PtZn, the inertness of carbon facilitates the interaction between the metals while avoiding unwanted interactions with the support. The research highlights the enhanced selectivity of Pt-Zn catalysts in hydrogenation reactions compared to Pt catalysts alone, especially in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and dehydrogenation of iso-butane. Additionally, gold (Au)-zinc oxide (ZnO) catalysts demonstrate superior performance in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, achieving higher selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol compared to Au-supported on silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silver (Ag)-ZnO catalysts also show promise in this reaction, albeit with slightly lower selectivity. These findings underscore the potential of bimetallic catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts in enhancing the efficiency of nonoxidative dehydrogenation processes for light olefins.

本研究对比了单金属铂(Pt)和双金属铂锌(PtZn)催化剂在两种不同反应中的催化性能：醋酸乙烯酯的蒸汽相氢化和异丁烷脱氢。活性碳作为支撑材料，利用其高表面积优势。在如PtZn这样的双金属系统中，碳的惰性促进了金属之间的相互作用，同时避免了与支持物的不利相互作用。研究表明，Pt-Zn催化剂在氢化反应中具有增强的选择性，尤其是在醋酸乙烯酯的氢化和异丁烷脱氢过程中。此外，金(Au)-锌氧化物(ZnO)催化剂在醋酸乙烯酯氢化反应中表现出优异的性能，其选择性高于Au负载在硅氧化物(SiO2)上的催化剂。银(Ag)-ZnO催化剂也在此反应中显示出潜力，尽管选择性略低。这些发现强调了双金属催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中的效率提升潜力。
