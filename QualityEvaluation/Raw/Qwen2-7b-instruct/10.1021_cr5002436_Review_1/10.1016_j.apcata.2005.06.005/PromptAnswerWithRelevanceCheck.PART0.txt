[1] "In fact, DFT calculations for the adsorption of ethylene and formaldehyde on Pt(1 1 1), Pt3Zn(1 1 1) and PtZn(0 1 1) surfaces have demonstrated that addition of zinc to platinum weakens the adsorption of both olefinic (C C) and carbonyl (C O) bonds, but the effect is more important for the former."
[2] "Furthermore, ZnO has n-type semiconductor character and thus, a strong interaction between platinum and ZnO can be expected."
[3] "The results were explained on the basis of the formation of PtZn alloy phases after the reduction of Zn(II) species, which was observed to be favoured by the presence of the noble metal."
[4] "The same authors have recently reported the catalytic behaviour of Ag/ZnO catalysts in the same reaction. Selectivities to crotyl alcohol of about 70% were obtained during reaction at 523 K."

The document does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts (like platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the catalytic behavior of platinum-based catalysts in relation to zinc. Zinc modifies the adsorption properties of platinum on surfaces, weakening the adsorption of both olefinic and carbonyl bonds, particularly olefinic bonds, due to its n-type semiconductor character. The presence of zinc favors the formation of PtZn alloy phases, enhancing the selectivity of platinum-zinc catalysts in the hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes. Additionally, the document mentions that silver/zinc oxide (Ag/ZnO) catalysts also exhibit selective hydrogenation, achieving selectivities to crotyl alcohol around 70% under certain conditions. These findings suggest that modifications to noble metal catalysts, like incorporating zinc, can improve their selectivity in specific reactions, including dehydrogenation. However, for a comprehensive comparison between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts, further detailed studies would be required.

文档没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）。然而，它确实讨论了铂基催化剂与锌的关系。锌改变了铂在表面的吸附性质，减弱了两者（烯烃和羰基）键的吸附，尤其是烯烃键，由于其n型半导体特性。铂锌合金相的存在促进了铂锌催化剂在不饱和醛氢化中的选择性。此外，文档提到银/锌氧化物（Ag/ZnO）催化剂在相同的反应中也表现出选择性的氢化，实现了约70%的对顺式醇的选择性，在特定条件下。这些发现表明，对贵金属催化剂进行修改，如引入锌，可以在某些反应中提高它们的选择性，包括脱氢反应。但是，为了进行全面比较贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂，需要进一步详细的研究。

The document discusses the use of zinc in catalysts for various reactions, including selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Zinc can act as a promoter or support for catalysts, enhancing their performance in reactions such as the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and the dehydrogenation of iso-butane. Gold and silver catalysts supported on zinc oxide (Au/ZnO and Ag/ZnO) show high selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, with selectivities reaching about 70% at 523 K. The superior performance of these catalysts is attributed to the formation of interfacial sites that activate the reactants and facilitate their hydrogenation. Zinc oxide appears to improve the catalytic behavior of noble metal catalysts in various reactions, indicating its potential as a versatile support material in heterogeneous catalysis.

文档讨论了锌在催化剂中的应用，包括选择性氢化和脱氢。锌可以作为催化剂的促进剂或支持物，提高其在如丙酮醛氢化和异丁烷脱氢等反应中的性能。金和银的催化剂负载在锌氧化物（Au/ZnO和Ag/ZnO）上，在氢化反应中显示出高选择性，523 K时的选择性约为70%。这些催化剂性能优越的原因是形成了能激活反应物并促进它们氢化的界面位点。锌氧化物似乎能够改善贵金属催化剂在各种反应中的催化行为，表明它在异质催化中作为多功能支持材料的潜力。

[1] "This paper compares the catalytic behaviour of two activated carbon-supported catalysts, monometallic Pt and bimetallic PtZn, in two very different reactions: the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and the dehydrogenation of iso-butane."

This study investigates the comparative catalytic behavior of monometallic platinum (Pt) and bimetallic platinum-zinc (PtZn) catalysts in two distinct reactions: the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and the dehydrogenation of iso-butane. Activated carbon serves as the support material, taking advantage of its high surface area. In bimetallic systems like PtZn, the inertness of carbon facilitates the interaction between the metals while avoiding unwanted interactions with the support. The research highlights the enhanced selectivity of Pt-Zn catalysts in hydrogenation reactions compared to Pt catalysts alone, especially in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and dehydrogenation of iso-butane. Additionally, gold (Au)-zinc oxide (ZnO) catalysts demonstrate superior performance in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, achieving higher selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol compared to Au-supported on silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silver (Ag)-ZnO catalysts also show promise in this reaction, albeit with slightly lower selectivity. These findings underscore the potential of bimetallic catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts in enhancing the efficiency of nonoxidative dehydrogenation processes for light olefins.

本研究对比了单金属铂(Pt)和双金属铂锌(PtZn)催化剂在两种不同反应中的催化性能：醋酸乙烯酯的蒸汽相氢化和异丁烷脱氢。活性碳作为支撑材料，利用其高表面积优势。在如PtZn这样的双金属系统中，碳的惰性促进了金属之间的相互作用，同时避免了与支持物的不利相互作用。研究表明，Pt-Zn催化剂在氢化反应中具有增强的选择性，尤其是在醋酸乙烯酯的氢化和异丁烷脱氢过程中。此外，金(Au)-锌氧化物(ZnO)催化剂在醋酸乙烯酯氢化反应中表现出优异的性能，其选择性高于Au负载在硅氧化物(SiO2)上的催化剂。银(Ag)-ZnO催化剂也在此反应中显示出潜力，尽管选择性略低。这些发现强调了双金属催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中的效率提升潜力。

This study explores the catalytic behavior of platinum and bimetallic platinum-zinc catalysts in two distinct reactions: the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and the dehydrogenation of iso-butane. The results indicate that the presence of zinc significantly enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity of the platinum catalysts in these processes. In the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, zinc promotes a higher initial activity but leads to stronger deactivation over time. Additionally, zinc reduces the activation energy and improves the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol. For iso-butane dehydrogenation, zinc significantly improves the catalytic behavior, making the bimetallic catalyst more active than its monometallic counterpart and achieving 100% selectivity to iso-butene.

The document discusses the comparison between noble metal-based catalysts (primarily platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are characterized by their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages.

Platinum-based catalysts exhibit specific catalytic behavior changes when combined with zinc. DFT calculations demonstrate that zinc weakens the adsorption of both olefinic and carbonyl bonds, with a more significant impact on olefinic bonds. This leads to enhanced selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, particularly in the formation of unsaturated alcohols, as seen in the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. However, the catalytic activity is significantly reduced due to the formation of alloy phases after zinc reduction.

Metal oxide-based catalysts, including zinc oxide (ZnO), are noted for their semiconducting properties and ability to interact strongly with noble metals like platinum. These catalysts can be effective in selective hydrogenation reactions, such as the formation of crotyl alcohol in the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Recent studies have shown that Au/ZnO catalysts can achieve selectivities up to 82% under certain conditions, indicating the potential of metal oxide-based catalysts in enhancing catalytic performance.

In summary, the document highlights the unique roles of noble metals and metal oxides in catalysis, with particular emphasis on their interactions, selectivity enhancement, and application in nonoxidative dehydrogenation processes. The findings suggest promising advancements in catalyst design and optimization for industrial applications.

本文讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢反应中，贵金属催化剂（主要为铂）与金属氧化物催化剂之间的比较。这些催化剂通过其组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展以及潜在优势进行了描述。

铂基催化剂在与锌结合时表现出特定的催化行为变化。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，锌减弱了乙烯和甲醛在铂（1 1 1）、铂3锌（1 1 1）和铂锌（0 1 1）表面的吸附作用，其中对烯键的吸附影响更为显著。这导致了氢化反应中，尤其是不饱和醇的形成过程中，选择性增强。然而，由于锌还原后形成的合金相，铂的活性显著降低。

金属氧化物基催化剂，特别是锌氧化物（ZnO），因其半导体特性以及与贵金属如铂的强相互作用而受到关注。这些催化剂在选择性氢化反应中的应用潜力得到证明，例如，在蒸汽相氢化丙酮醛中形成不饱和醇。最近的研究表明，Au/ZnO催化剂在特定条件下可实现高达82%的选择性，显示了金属氧化物基催化剂在提高催化性能方面的潜力。

综上所述，本文强调了贵金属与金属氧化物在催化领域的独特作用，特别关注它们之间的相互作用、选择性增强及其在非氧化脱氢过程中的应用前景。研究结果暗示了催化剂设计和优化在工业应用方面的有希望的发展。
