[1] "The use of zinc as promoter or support for selective hydrogenation reactions is not limited to platinum catalysts."
[2] "Au/ZnO catalysts were also selective for the formation of crotyl alcohol in the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
[3] "Selectivities to crotyl alcohol of about 70% were obtained during reaction at 523 K."

This study explores the catalytic behavior of platinum and bimetallic platinum-zinc catalysts in two distinct reactions: the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and the dehydrogenation of iso-butane. The results indicate that the presence of zinc significantly enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity of the platinum catalysts in these processes. In the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, zinc promotes a higher initial activity but leads to stronger deactivation over time. Additionally, zinc reduces the activation energy and improves the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol. For iso-butane dehydrogenation, zinc significantly improves the catalytic behavior, making the bimetallic catalyst more active than its monometallic counterpart and achieving 100% selectivity to iso-butene.

本研究探讨了铂和铂锌双金属催化剂在两种不同反应中的催化行为：乙酸丙酮的气相氢化以及异丁烷脱氢。结果表明，锌的存在显著提高了铂催化剂在这两个过程中的活性和选择性。在乙酸丙酮的氢化过程中，锌促进更高的初始活性，但导致更强烈的随时间衰减。此外，锌降低了活化能并提高了不饱和醇的选择性。对于异丁烷脱氢，锌显着改善了催化性能，使双金属催化剂比其单金属同系物更具活性，并实现了对异丁烯的100%选择性。
