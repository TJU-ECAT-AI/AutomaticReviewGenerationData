[1] "The use of zinc as promoter or support for selective hydrogenation reactions is not limited to platinum catalysts."
[2] "Au/ZnO catalysts were also selective for the formation of crotyl alcohol in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
[3] "Selectivities to crotyl alcohol of about 70% were obtained during reaction at 523 K."
[4] "The superior performance of Au/ZnO catalysts was explained by the formation of interfacial sites adjacent to Au particles that can activate the reactant and facilitate its hydrogenation."
[5] "The same authors have recently reported the catalytic behaviour of Ag/ZnO catalysts in the same reaction."

The document discusses the use of zinc in catalysts for various reactions, including selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Zinc can act as a promoter or support for catalysts, enhancing their performance in reactions such as the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and the dehydrogenation of iso-butane. Gold and silver catalysts supported on zinc oxide (Au/ZnO and Ag/ZnO) show high selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, with selectivities reaching about 70% at 523 K. The superior performance of these catalysts is attributed to the formation of interfacial sites that activate the reactants and facilitate their hydrogenation. Zinc oxide appears to improve the catalytic behavior of noble metal catalysts in various reactions, indicating its potential as a versatile support material in heterogeneous catalysis.

文档讨论了锌在催化剂中的应用，包括选择性氢化和脱氢。锌可以作为催化剂的促进剂或支持物，提高其在如丙酮醛氢化和异丁烷脱氢等反应中的性能。金和银的催化剂负载在锌氧化物（Au/ZnO和Ag/ZnO）上，在氢化反应中显示出高选择性，523 K时的选择性约为70%。这些催化剂性能优越的原因是形成了能激活反应物并促进它们氢化的界面位点。锌氧化物似乎能够改善贵金属催化剂在各种反应中的催化行为，表明它在异质催化中作为多功能支持材料的潜力。
