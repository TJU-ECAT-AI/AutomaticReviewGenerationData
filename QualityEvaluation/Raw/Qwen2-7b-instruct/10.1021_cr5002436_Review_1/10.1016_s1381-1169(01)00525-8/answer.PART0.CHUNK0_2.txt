[1] "The H2 reduction behaviors of bimetallic Pt Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts are related to tin content and preparation techniques, in the samples with 0.3 wt.% Sn, when the solgel and impregnation techniques were applied, there are two hydrogen consumption peaks, respectively, centered at about 100 and 330 C, corresponding to the reduction steps of PtO2 and SnO2 to PtOx and SnOx (1 < x < 2) and then to Pt0 and Sn0. In the samples with 0.6 wt.% Sn, besides the platinum and tin phases present, a new kind of tin species were produced, which strongly interacted with the support in the presence of platinum, it could only be reduced up to 500 C. This kind of platinum-modified tin crystals are responsible for the improvement of the catalytic activity of tin-rich samples."
[2] "Tin content showed very important effects on the catalyst acidity. Increasing tin content results in a remarkable reduction of acidity of all the catalysts prepared by different methods, this is a strong indication that some of tin species in the tin-rich samples poison the acid sites on the support by tin interaction with these acid centers."
[3] "Metal distribution, pore size distribution and acidity, shows that they strongly depend on the different preparation methods, affecting the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. The solgel catalyst shows very narrow pore size distribution and a larger number of acid sites as well as higher metal distribution, which benefit not only the dehydrogenation reaction but coke formation also, therefore the solgel catalyst shows higher selectivity to propene but lower catalytic stability."

The document discusses the use of bimetallic Pt-Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The reduction behaviors and catalytic performance of these catalysts are influenced by tin content and the preparation technique. In catalysts with 0.3 wt.% Sn, two hydrogen consumption peaks are observed at around 100 and 330°C, corresponding to the reduction of PtO2 to PtOx and SnO2 to SnOx. With 0.6 wt.% Sn, a new type of tin species forms, interacting strongly with the support and platinum, allowing only partial reduction up to 500°C. This platinum-modified tin contributes to the improved catalytic activity in tin-rich samples. The acidity of the catalysts decreases with increasing tin content, suggesting that some tin species poison the acid sites on the support. The solgel catalysts exhibit narrower pore size distribution, more acid sites, and higher metal distribution, enhancing dehydrogenation efficiency while potentially leading to lower stability due to coke formation.

文档讨论了铂锡双金属/MgAl2O4催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。这些催化剂的还原行为和催化性能受锡含量和制备技术的影响。在含0.3 wt.%锡的催化剂中，观察到两个氢消耗峰分别位于约100°C和330°C，对应于PtO2转化为PtOx和SnO2转化为SnOx的过程。对于含0.6 wt.%锡的样品，一种新的锡物种形成，并与支撑材料和铂强烈相互作用，仅允许在500°C以下部分还原。这种铂改性锡晶粒负责提高高锡含量样品的催化活性。随着锡含量的增加，催化剂的酸性显著降低，表明某些锡物种正在破坏支撑材料上的酸位点。溶胶催化剂的孔径分布较窄，酸位点较多，金属分布较高，不仅有利于脱氢反应，还可能促进焦炭形成，因此溶胶催化剂表现出更高的丙烯选择性但较低的稳定性。
