<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins utilizes both noble metal-based catalysts, primarily Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Noble metal catalysts are known for their high efficiency and selectivity, whereas metal oxide catalysts offer lower costs and broader availability, making them suitable for certain applications. Recent advancements include the introduction of new noble metals like Ruthenium and Palladium, along with enhancements in metal oxide catalysts' stability, selectivity, and efficiency. Noble metals tend to be more active but costlier, while metal oxides are more affordable and easier to synthesize.
