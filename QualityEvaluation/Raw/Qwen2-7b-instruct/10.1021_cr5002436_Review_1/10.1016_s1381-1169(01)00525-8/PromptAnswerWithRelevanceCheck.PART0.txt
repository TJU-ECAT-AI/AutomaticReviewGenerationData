Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins involves examining their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent advancements, and potential benefits. Noble metals such as Platinum exhibit exceptional activity and selectivity due to their electronic properties, while metal oxides often offer stability and affordability. Recent developments focus on enhancing stability, selectivity, and activity through novel synthesis methods, improved support materials, and catalyst design. Advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include superior activity, selectivity, and resistance to poisoning, but they are typically more expensive and require careful handling. Metal oxides, on the other hand, are cheaper and more industrially feasible, but they may suffer from lower activity and selectivity.

[1] "The H2 reduction behaviors of bimetallic Pt Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts are related to tin content and preparation techniques, in the samples with 0.3 wt.% Sn, when the solgel and impregnation techniques were applied, there are two hydrogen consumption peaks, respectively, centered at about 100 and 330 C, corresponding to the reduction steps of PtO2 and SnO2 to PtOx and SnOx (1 < x < 2) and then to Pt0 and Sn0. In the samples with 0.6 wt.% Sn, besides the platinum and tin phases present, a new kind of tin species were produced, which strongly interacted with the support in the presence of platinum, it could only be reduced up to 500 C. This kind of platinum-modified tin crystals are responsible for the improvement of the catalytic activity of tin-rich samples."
[2] "Tin content showed very important effects on the catalyst acidity. Increasing tin content results in a remarkable reduction of acidity of all the catalysts prepared by different methods, this is a strong indication that some of tin species in the tin-rich samples poison the acid sites on the support by tin interaction with these acid centers."
[3] "Metal distribution, pore size distribution and acidity, shows that they strongly depend on the different preparation methods, affecting the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. The solgel catalyst shows very narrow pore size distribution and a larger number of acid sites as well as higher metal distribution, which benefit not only the dehydrogenation reaction but coke formation also, therefore the solgel catalyst shows higher selectivity to propene but lower catalytic stability."

The document discusses the use of bimetallic Pt-Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The reduction behaviors and catalytic performance of these catalysts are influenced by tin content and the preparation technique. In catalysts with 0.3 wt.% Sn, two hydrogen consumption peaks are observed at around 100 and 330°C, corresponding to the reduction of PtO2 to PtOx and SnO2 to SnOx. With 0.6 wt.% Sn, a new type of tin species forms, interacting strongly with the support and platinum, allowing only partial reduction up to 500°C. This platinum-modified tin contributes to the improved catalytic activity in tin-rich samples. The acidity of the catalysts decreases with increasing tin content, suggesting that some tin species poison the acid sites on the support. The solgel catalysts exhibit narrower pore size distribution, more acid sites, and higher metal distribution, enhancing dehydrogenation efficiency while potentially leading to lower stability due to coke formation.

文档讨论了铂锡双金属/MgAl2O4催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。这些催化剂的还原行为和催化性能受锡含量和制备技术的影响。在含0.3 wt.%锡的催化剂中，观察到两个氢消耗峰分别位于约100°C和330°C，对应于PtO2转化为PtOx和SnO2转化为SnOx的过程。对于含0.6 wt.%锡的样品，一种新的锡物种形成，并与支撑材料和铂强烈相互作用，仅允许在500°C以下部分还原。这种铂改性锡晶粒负责提高高锡含量样品的催化活性。随着锡含量的增加，催化剂的酸性显著降低，表明某些锡物种正在破坏支撑材料上的酸位点。溶胶催化剂的孔径分布较窄，酸位点较多，金属分布较高，不仅有利于脱氢反应，还可能促进焦炭形成，因此溶胶催化剂表现出更高的丙烯选择性但较低的稳定性。

The document discusses the effects of tin content and preparation techniques on the H2 reduction behaviors of bimetallic PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts. When the tin content is 0.3 wt.%, there are two hydrogen consumption peaks, corresponding to the reduction steps of PtO2 and SnO2 to PtOx and SnOx, respectively. However, when the tin content increases to 0.6 wt.%, a new kind of tin species is produced that interacts strongly with the support, reducing only up to 500°C. The acidity of the catalysts decreases with increasing tin content, suggesting that some tin species poison the acid sites on the support. The preparation methods, such as solgel, impregnation, and coprecipitation-impregnation, affect the metal distribution, pore size distribution, and acidity, impacting the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. The solgel catalysts exhibit a narrower pore size distribution, more acid sites, and higher metal distribution, leading to higher selectivity for propene but lower stability.

文档讨论了锡含量和制备技术对铂锡双金属/MgAl2O4催化剂的H2还原行为的影响。当锡含量为0.3wt.%时，存在两个氢消耗峰，分别对应于PtO2和SnO2转化为PtOx和SnOx的还原步骤。然而，当锡含量增加到0.6wt.%时，产生了一种新的锡物种，它与支持物强烈相互作用，在铂的存在下只能在500°C以下进行还原。随着锡含量的增加，催化剂的酸性显著降低，这表明某些锡物种通过与这些酸中心的锡相互作用毒害了支持物上的酸位点。不同的制备方法，如溶胶、浸渍和共沉淀-浸渍，影响金属分布、孔径分布和酸性，进而影响催化剂的选择性和稳定性。溶胶催化剂显示出更窄的孔径分布、更多的酸位以及更高的金属分布，导致丙烯选择性更高但稳定性更低。
