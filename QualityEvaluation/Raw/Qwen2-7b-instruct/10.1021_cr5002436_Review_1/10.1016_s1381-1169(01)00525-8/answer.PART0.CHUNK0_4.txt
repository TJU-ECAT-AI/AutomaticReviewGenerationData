Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find that noble metals offer superior selectivity and stability, often requiring higher operating temperatures. Metal oxides, however, are typically cheaper and more resistant to deactivation, but they might have lower activity and selectivity. Recent developments focus on enhancing both types of catalysts' compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, and potential advantages. Noble metals are favored for their durability and efficiency, while metal oxides are chosen for their cost-effectiveness. Both catalyst types have seen advancements in synthesis methods, support materials, and combined usage. The trend is towards creating more efficient and selective catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures, reducing energy consumption. Studies have also explored the synergistic effects of combining noble metals with metal oxides to leverage their respective strengths.
