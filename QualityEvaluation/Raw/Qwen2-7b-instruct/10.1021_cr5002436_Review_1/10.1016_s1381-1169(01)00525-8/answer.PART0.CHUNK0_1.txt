Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins involves examining their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent advancements, and potential benefits. Noble metals such as Platinum exhibit exceptional activity and selectivity due to their electronic properties, while metal oxides often offer stability and affordability. Recent developments focus on enhancing stability, selectivity, and activity through novel synthesis methods, improved support materials, and catalyst design. Advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include superior activity, selectivity, and resistance to poisoning, but they are typically more expensive and require careful handling. Metal oxides, on the other hand, are cheaper and more industrially feasible, but they may suffer from lower activity and selectivity.
