Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, both types are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts are employed in the UOP Oleflex process, while chromium oxide/alumina catalysts are used in the ABB Lummus CATOFIN process. These catalysts have distinct compositions and effectiveness, with industrial applications tailored to specific processes. Recent developments aim to optimize performance and efficiency. The potential advantages of each type include stability, selectivity, and economic viability, depending on the specific application and process requirements.
