The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metal catalysts, like platinum, are effective for the dehydrogenation of alkanes due to their ability to facilitate the breaking of carbon-hydrogen bonds. They offer high selectivity and stability under reaction conditions. However, they can be expensive and may require special handling and regeneration processes. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are less expensive and often more stable than noble metals. These catalysts are used in various industrial applications for the dehydrogenation of light olefins, offering a more cost-effective solution compared to noble metals. Recent developments have focused on improving the activity and stability of metal oxide catalysts, aiming to enhance their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Metal oxide catalysts can provide better resistance to poisoning and higher yield in certain cases, making them a promising alternative in the field of alkane dehydrogenation.
