[1] "Effective catalysts for dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene can be produced by supporting tin and platinum in K-L-zeolite. These catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation after extended periods of time at temperatures from 673-773 K."
[2] "M6ssbauer spectroscopic results show that some of the tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles in reduced Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts, while the remainder of the tin is present as Sn 2+."
[3] "It appears that Sn 2+ can interchange with K + in the zeolite structure, and potassium displaced from ion exchange positions in the zeolite may interact with Pt/Sn particles in the catalyst."
[4] "The addition of excess potassium to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts further enhances the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[5] "It is suggested that tin and potassium in Pt/Sn/K-L decrease the size of surface platinum ensembles, thereby inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions of isobutane."

The document discusses the use of tin and platinum supported in K-L zeolite as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. These catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation process, even after prolonged operation at high temperatures. The tin and platinum form Pt/Sn alloy particles in the catalyst, with some tin also present as Sn 2+. The tin and potassium in the catalysts can decrease the size of the surface platinum ensembles, inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions. Excess potassium further enhances the catalyst's dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The zeolite structure may also promote the dissociative adsorption of isobutane, contributing to the catalyst's effectiveness.

该文档讨论了在K-L沸石中支持锡和铂作为异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯的催化剂的应用。这些催化剂在高温下长时间运行时表现出高活性和选择性。锡和铂形成Pt/Sn合金颗粒，部分锡以Sn 2+形式存在。在催化剂中的锡和钾可以减小表面铂簇的尺寸，抑制异构化和氢解反应。过量的钾进一步增强了催化剂的脱氢活性和选择性。沸石结构可能也有助于促进异丁烷的离解吸附，从而增加催化剂的有效性。
