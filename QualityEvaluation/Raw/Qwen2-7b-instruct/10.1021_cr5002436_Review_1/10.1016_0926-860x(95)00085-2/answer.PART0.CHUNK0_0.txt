[6] "While platinum supported in L-zeolite is highly active for isobutane conversion, this catalyst is not selective for isobutane dehydrogenation."
[7] "However, the combination of tin and platinum in the potassium form of L-zeolite produces a catalyst that exhibits high activity and high selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."
[8] "We suggest that tin and excess potassium reduce the size of the platinum ensembles in L-zeolite, while the pore structure of L-zeolite promotes the reactions of isobutane over platinum."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the literature highlights the use of platinum and tin in L-zeolite as a catalyst system for isobutane dehydrogenation. Platinum is noted for its high activity in converting n-hexane into benzene and possessing cluster-sized particles within zeolite channels. However, it is observed that pure platinum catalysts do not exhibit high selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation, possibly due to large surface platinum ensembles that facilitate hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions. Adding tin to the platinum catalyst system in the form of L-zeolite increases the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation by forming Pt/Sn alloy particles and reducing the size of surface platinum ensembles, thus inhibiting hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions. This suggests that the addition of tin and potassium to platinum in L-zeolite may lead to more efficient catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation due to the stabilization of molecularly adsorbed isobutane species in the zeolite pore structure and the enhancement of the dissociative adsorption rate of isobutane. 

Industrial applications of such catalysts include the production of oxygenated compounds required in reformulated gasoline. The recent development discussed is the utilization of platinum and tin in the form of L-zeolite, which offers high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation over prolonged periods at temperatures ranging from 673-773 K. The literature suggests that the zeolite pore structure and the presence of potassium contribute to promoting the rate of dissociative adsorption of isobutane, further enhancing the effectiveness of the catalyst. Potential advantages of this catalyst system include improved selectivity, stability, and efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for the conversion of isobutane to isobutene.

在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的领域中，贵金属催化剂（如铂）与金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）之间的比较，文献着重介绍了在L-沸石中添加铂和锡作为催化剂系统用于异丁烷脱氢的应用。铂因其在将己烷转化为苯时表现出高活性以及在沸石通道中形成簇状铂颗粒而受到关注。然而，纯铂催化剂在异丁烷脱氢的选择性方面并不高，这可能是由于表面铂团簇过大，促进氢解、异构化和结焦反应所致。在铂催化剂体系中添加锡以L-沸石的形式，可以增加异丁烷脱氢的选择性，通过形成Pt/Sn合金颗粒并减小表面铂团簇的大小，从而抑制氢解、异构化和结焦反应。这表明，铂和锡在L-沸石中的添加可能使异丁烷脱氢更有效的催化剂，因为分子吸附的异丁烷物种在沸石孔结构中的稳定化以及异丁烷离解吸附速率的增强。

工业应用包括生产用于调和汽油所需的氧合化合物。最近的发展涉及在L-沸石形式下使用铂和锡，它提供了高活性和长时间（从673-773 K）对异丁烷脱氢的高选择性。文献指出，沸石孔结构和钾的存在促进了异丁烷的离解吸附率，进一步提高了催化剂的有效性。这种催化剂系统的潜在优势包括提高选择性、稳定性和效率，在脱氢反应中，特别是将异丁烷转化为异丁烯。
