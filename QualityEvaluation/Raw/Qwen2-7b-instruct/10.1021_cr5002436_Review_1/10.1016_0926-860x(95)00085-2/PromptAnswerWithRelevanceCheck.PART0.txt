[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for alkenes such as propene and isobutene."
[2] "It is known that addition of tin to platinum-based catalysts increases the selectivity for dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene."
[3] "We showed in a previous investigation that tin interacts with silica-supported platinum..."
[4] "In the present study, L-zeolite-supported platinum and Pt/Sn catalysts were investigated in kinetic, microcalorimetric, and Mossbauer spectroscopic studies."
[5] "The rationale for this work is that small ensembles of supported platinum should be highly selective for dehydrogenation reactions, and L-zeolite can stabilize cluster-sized platinum particles within its channels."
[6] "While platinum supported in L-zeolite is highly active for isobutane conversion, this catalyst is not selective for isobutane dehydrogenation."
[7] "However, the combination of tin and platinum in the potassium form of L-zeolite produces a catalyst that exhibits high activity and high selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."
[8] "We suggest that tin and excess potassium reduce the size of the platinum ensembles in L-zeolite, while the pore structure of L-zeolite promotes the reactions of isobutane over platinum."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the literature highlights the use of platinum and tin in L-zeolite as a catalyst system for isobutane dehydrogenation. Platinum is noted for its high activity in converting n-hexane into benzene and possessing cluster-sized particles within zeolite channels. However, it is observed that pure platinum catalysts do not exhibit high selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation, possibly due to large surface platinum ensembles that facilitate hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions. Adding tin to the platinum catalyst system in the form of L-zeolite increases the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation by forming Pt/Sn alloy particles and reducing the size of surface platinum ensembles, thus inhibiting hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions. This suggests that the addition of tin and potassium to platinum in L-zeolite may lead to more efficient catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation due to the stabilization of molecularly adsorbed isobutane species in the zeolite pore structure and the enhancement of the dissociative adsorption rate of isobutane. 

Industrial applications of such catalysts include the production of oxygenated compounds required in reformulated gasoline. The recent development discussed is the utilization of platinum and tin in the form of L-zeolite, which offers high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation over prolonged periods at temperatures ranging from 673-773 K. The literature suggests that the zeolite pore structure and the presence of potassium contribute to promoting the rate of dissociative adsorption of isobutane, further enhancing the effectiveness of the catalyst. Potential advantages of this catalyst system include improved selectivity, stability, and efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for the conversion of isobutane to isobutene.

在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的领域中，贵金属催化剂（如铂）与金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）之间的比较，文献着重介绍了在L-沸石中添加铂和锡作为催化剂系统用于异丁烷脱氢的应用。铂因其在将己烷转化为苯时表现出高活性以及在沸石通道中形成簇状铂颗粒而受到关注。然而，纯铂催化剂在异丁烷脱氢的选择性方面并不高，这可能是由于表面铂团簇过大，促进氢解、异构化和结焦反应所致。在铂催化剂体系中添加锡以L-沸石的形式，可以增加异丁烷脱氢的选择性，通过形成Pt/Sn合金颗粒并减小表面铂团簇的大小，从而抑制氢解、异构化和结焦反应。这表明，铂和锡在L-沸石中的添加可能使异丁烷脱氢更有效的催化剂，因为分子吸附的异丁烷物种在沸石孔结构中的稳定化以及异丁烷离解吸附速率的增强。

工业应用包括生产用于调和汽油所需的氧合化合物。最近的发展涉及在L-沸石形式下使用铂和锡，它提供了高活性和长时间（从673-773 K）对异丁烷脱氢的高选择性。文献指出，沸石孔结构和钾的存在促进了异丁烷的离解吸附率，进一步提高了催化剂的有效性。这种催化剂系统的潜在优势包括提高选择性、稳定性和效率，在脱氢反应中，特别是将异丁烷转化为异丁烯。

The document discusses the use of tin and platinum supported in K-L zeolite as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. These catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation process, even after prolonged operation at high temperatures. The tin and platinum form Pt/Sn alloy particles in the catalyst, with some tin also present as Sn 2+. The tin and potassium in the catalysts can decrease the size of the surface platinum ensembles, inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions. Excess potassium further enhances the catalyst's dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The zeolite structure may also promote the dissociative adsorption of isobutane, contributing to the catalyst's effectiveness.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the literature highlights the use of Platinum and tin in zeolite supports for enhanced activity and selectivity in isobutane dehydrogenation. Platinum-based catalysts, when supported on zeolites like L-zeolite with tin, show high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation. The tin interacts with platinum to form alloy particles, reducing the size of surface platinum ensembles and inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions. The zeolite structure stabilizes molecularly adsorbed isobutane species, promoting the rate of dissociative adsorption. The presence of potassium further enhances dehydrogenation activity and selectivity by displacing from ion-exchange positions and interacting with platinum particles. Metal oxide catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, might offer different reactivity patterns and stability profiles but lack the specific synergistic interactions between tin and platinum in zeolite supports highlighted for isobutane dehydrogenation. Recent developments in this field focus on optimizing the composition and support materials to achieve higher efficiency and longer lifetime of catalysts. The potential advantages of these systems include improved selectivity, enhanced activity, and resistance to deactivation, making them suitable for industrial applications requiring efficient dehydrogenation of light olefins.

比较铂基催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，文献强调了通过在L-沸石中支持锡和铂来生产用于异丁烷脱氢的有效催化剂。当铂基催化剂在沸石上与锡结合时，显示出高活性和异丁烷脱氢的选择性。锡与铂形成合金颗粒，减少了表面铂簇的尺寸，并抑制了异构化和氢解反应。沸石结构稳定了分子吸附的异丁烷物种，促进了异丁烷的离散吸附速率。钾的存在进一步提高了脱氢活性和选择性，通过从离子交换位置置换并与其他铂粒子相互作用。金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，可能提供不同的反应模式和稳定性，但缺乏文献中强调的锡和铂在沸石支持材料中协同作用的特点，这些特点适用于异丁烷脱氢。该领域近期发展集中在优化组成和支撑材料，以实现更高效率和更长寿命的催化剂。这些系统的优势包括提高选择性和增强活性，以及对失活的抵抗力，使其适用于需要高效脱氢轻烯烃的工业应用。

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts, when combined with tin, exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation. The tin forms Pt/Sn alloy particles with the platinum, reducing the size of the surface platinum ensembles and inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions. This results in a high rate of isobutane dehydrogenation, possibly due to stabilization of molecularly adsorbed isobutane species by the zeolite pore structure and/or excess potassium, which enhances the rate of dissociation of isobutane. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, offer alternatives for dehydrogenation processes, potentially with different mechanisms and properties depending on the specific oxide used. Recent developments in this field focus on improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts for more efficient and environmentally friendly dehydrogenation processes. Potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include high reactivity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts may offer lower cost and broader applicability. Industrial applications include the production of alkenes such as propene and isobutene, which are essential feedstocks for the manufacturing of oxygenated compounds required in reformulated gasoline.
