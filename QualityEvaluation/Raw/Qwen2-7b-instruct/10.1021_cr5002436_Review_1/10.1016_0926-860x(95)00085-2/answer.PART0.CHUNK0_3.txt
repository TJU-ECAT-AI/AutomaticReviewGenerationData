<p>It is known that addition of tin to platinum-based catalysts increases the selec- tivity for dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene.</p>
<p>Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for alkenes such as propene and isobutene. Isobutene is in partic- ular high demand as a feedstock for the production of oxygenated compounds required in reformulated gasoline, such as methyl tert-butyl ether, ethyl tert-butyl ether, and tert-butyl alcohol.</p>
<p>The rationale for this work is that small ensembles of supported platinum should be highly selective for dehydrogenation reactions, and L-zeolite can stabilize cluster-sized platinum particles within its channels.</p>
<p>M6ssbauer spectroscopic results show that some of the tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles in reduced Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts, while the remainder of the tin is present as Sn 2 +.</p>
<p>It is suggested that tin and potassium in Pt/Sn/K-L decrease the size of the surface platinum ensembles, thereby inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions of isobutane.</p>
<p>The high activity for isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts may be attrib- uted to stabilization of molecularly adsorbed isobutane species by the zeolite pore structure and/or by excess potassium, which enhances the rate limiting dissociation of isobutane.</p>

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts, when combined with tin, exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation. The tin forms Pt/Sn alloy particles with the platinum, reducing the size of the surface platinum ensembles and inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions. This results in a high rate of isobutane dehydrogenation, possibly due to stabilization of molecularly adsorbed isobutane species by the zeolite pore structure and/or excess potassium, which enhances the rate of dissociation of isobutane. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, offer alternatives for dehydrogenation processes, potentially with different mechanisms and properties depending on the specific oxide used. Recent developments in this field focus on improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts for more efficient and environmentally friendly dehydrogenation processes. Potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include high reactivity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts may offer lower cost and broader applicability. Industrial applications include the production of alkenes such as propene and isobutene, which are essential feedstocks for the manufacturing of oxygenated compounds required in reformulated gasoline.

在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中，使用了贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）。当铂与锡结合时，铂基催化剂显示出对异丁烷脱氢的高活性和选择性。锡与铂形成Pt/Sn合金颗粒，减小表面铂簇的尺寸，并抑制异构化和氢解反应。这导致了异丁烷脱氢的高速率，可能归因于由沸石孔结构稳定分子吸附的异丁烷物种，以及/或过量钾，这增强了异丁烷分解的关键步骤速率。金属氧化物基催化剂提供了脱氢过程的替代方案，具体取决于所使用的特定氧化物，其机制和性质可能有所不同。该领域最近的发展集中在提高这些催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性，以实现更高效和环境友好的脱氢过程。贵金属基催化剂的优势可能包括高反应性和选择性，而金属氧化物基催化剂可能提供较低的成本和更广泛的适用性。工业应用包括生产丙烯和异丁烷等烯烃，它们是制造用于重整汽油的氧化化合物所需的原料。
