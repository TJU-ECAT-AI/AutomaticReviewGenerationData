[1] "Effective catalysts for dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene can be produced by supporting tin and platinum in K-L-zeolite. These catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation after extended periods of time at temperatures from 673-773 K. M6ssbauer spectroscopic results show that some of the tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles in reduced Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts, while the remainder of the tin interacts with the zeolite and is present as Sn 2+. It appears that Sn 2+ can interchange with K + in the zeolite structure, and potassium displaced from ion exchange positions in the zeolite may interact with Pt/Sn particles in the catalyst. The addition of excess potassium to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts further enhances the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[2] "The rationale for this work is that small ensembles of supported platinum should be highly selective for dehydrogenation reactions, and L-zeolite can stabilize cluster-sized platinum particles within its channels (e.g., [6,7])."
[3] "Importantly, the 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst exhibits higher dehydrogenation rates than the Pt/SiO2 and 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 1), but the heats and uptakes for hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption are similar for the 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2 and 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts, as shown in Fig. 5."
[4] "For example, metal-catalyzed isomerization of isobutane occurs through a bond-shift mechanism involving the formation of ca,/-triadsorbed intermediates [19-22]."
[5] "The higher dehydrogenation rates over the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts suggest that the zeolite pore structure and/or the presence of potassium promote the rate of dissociative adsorption of isobutane."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find that Platinum and tin supported on K-L zeolite catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation. The tin interacts with platinum to form alloy particles, and potassium can displace from ion exchange positions in the zeolite, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The small ensembles of supported platinum in the zeolite channel help stabilize cluster-sized platinum particles, which are highly selective for dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of excess potassium to the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts further enhances the dehydrogenation rate. Metal-catalyzed isomerization of isobutane occurs through a bond-shift mechanism involving the formation of ca,/-triadsorbed intermediates. The zeolite pore structure and/or the presence of potassium in the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts appear to promote the rate of dissociative adsorption of isobutane, contributing to the high dehydrogenation rates observed over these catalysts.

Advantages of Platinum-based catalysts include high selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions, while metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides offer alternative routes for dehydrogenation. The industrial application of these catalysts depends on factors such as cost, stability, and the specific chemical process requirements. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst efficiency, stability, and reducing environmental impact. Potential areas for improvement might include modifying catalyst composition, optimizing synthesis methods, and enhancing operational conditions to achieve higher yields and selectivities.
