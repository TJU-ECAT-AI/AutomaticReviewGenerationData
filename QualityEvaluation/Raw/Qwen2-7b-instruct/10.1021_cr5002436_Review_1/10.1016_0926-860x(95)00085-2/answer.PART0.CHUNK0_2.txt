[1] "Effective catalysts for dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene can be produced by supporting tin and platinum in K-L-zeolite. These catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation after extended periods of time at temperatures from 673-773 K. M6ssbauer spectroscopic results show that some of the tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles in reduced Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts, while the remainder of the tin interacts with the zeolite and is present as Sn 2+. It appears that Sn 2+ can interchange with K + in the zeolite structure, and potassium displaced from ion exchange positions in the zeolite may interact with Pt/Sn particles in the catalyst. The addition of excess potassium to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts further enhances the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[2] "It is suggested that tin and potassium in Pt/Sn/K-L decrease the size of surface platinum ensembles, thereby inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions of isobutane. Microcalorimetric measurements show that the heats and uptakes for hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption are similar for the 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2 and 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts; however, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst exhibits a significantly higher rate of isobutane dehydrogenation. The zeolite pore structure and/or the presence of potassium in the Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst appear to promote the rate of dissociative adsorption of isobutane."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the literature highlights the use of Platinum and tin in zeolite supports for enhanced activity and selectivity in isobutane dehydrogenation. Platinum-based catalysts, when supported on zeolites like L-zeolite with tin, show high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation. The tin interacts with platinum to form alloy particles, reducing the size of surface platinum ensembles and inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions. The zeolite structure stabilizes molecularly adsorbed isobutane species, promoting the rate of dissociative adsorption. The presence of potassium further enhances dehydrogenation activity and selectivity by displacing from ion-exchange positions and interacting with platinum particles. Metal oxide catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, might offer different reactivity patterns and stability profiles but lack the specific synergistic interactions between tin and platinum in zeolite supports highlighted for isobutane dehydrogenation. Recent developments in this field focus on optimizing the composition and support materials to achieve higher efficiency and longer lifetime of catalysts. The potential advantages of these systems include improved selectivity, enhanced activity, and resistance to deactivation, making them suitable for industrial applications requiring efficient dehydrogenation of light olefins.

比较铂基催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，文献强调了通过在L-沸石中支持锡和铂来生产用于异丁烷脱氢的有效催化剂。当铂基催化剂在沸石上与锡结合时，显示出高活性和异丁烷脱氢的选择性。锡与铂形成合金颗粒，减少了表面铂簇的尺寸，并抑制了异构化和氢解反应。沸石结构稳定了分子吸附的异丁烷物种，促进了异丁烷的离散吸附速率。钾的存在进一步提高了脱氢活性和选择性，通过从离子交换位置置换并与其他铂粒子相互作用。金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，可能提供不同的反应模式和稳定性，但缺乏文献中强调的锡和铂在沸石支持材料中协同作用的特点，这些特点适用于异丁烷脱氢。该领域近期发展集中在优化组成和支撑材料，以实现更高效率和更长寿命的催化剂。这些系统的优势包括提高选择性和增强活性，以及对失活的抵抗力，使其适用于需要高效脱氢轻烯烃的工业应用。
