[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[2] "The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins."
[3] "In this study, we prepared PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts and compared their catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "The amount of coke generated in the reaction was measured by TGA. With increasing TOS, the coke content naturally increased on both catalysts."
[5] "For quantitative comparison, the initial and final conversions over PtSn/Al, in the first cycle, were 54.9 and 34.6%, respectively while those over PtSn/ZnAlO were 59.1 and 48.1%, respectively."

This study compared the catalytic performance of PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation. The study proposes that this is due to the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support. The stability of the PtSn catalysts is influenced by the formation and transition of different PtSn alloy phases, which leads to different coke mobilities. The amount of coke generated during the reaction was measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The coke content increased with time on the stream (TOS) on both catalysts. The initial and final conversions over PtSn/Al in the first cycle were 54.9% and 34.6%, respectively, while over PtSn/ZnAlO they were 59.1% and 48.1%, respectively.

本研究比较了PtSn/Al2O3和PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂表现出更强的催化失活容忍度。研究提出，这是由于金属表面到支撑物的焦炭移动性较快所致。PtSn催化剂稳定性受不同PtSn合金相形成和过渡的影响，导致不同的焦炭移动性。反应过程中生成的焦炭量通过热重分析（TGA）进行测量。随着时间上流（TOS）的增加，两种催化剂上的焦炭含量自然增加。第一轮中，PtSn/Al的初始和最终转化率分别为54.9%和34.6%，而PtSn/ZnAlO分别为59.1%和48.1%。
