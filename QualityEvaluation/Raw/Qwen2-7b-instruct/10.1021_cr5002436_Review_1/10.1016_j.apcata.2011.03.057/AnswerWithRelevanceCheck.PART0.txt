          Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts exhibit high stability and selectivity towards olefin production. Metal oxide catalysts contribute to enhancing stability and selectivity when combined with Platinum. Zinc aluminate supports are favored due to their neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength. The role of tin in modifying the electronic and geometric properties of Platinum is recognized, and its addition to Platinum catalyst systems positively impacts stability and selectivity towards olefins. Zinc oxide modifies the dispersion and interaction between the metal and support in Platinum-silver catalysts, leading to improved stability and selectivity. In zinc-doped Platinum-silver catalysts, high selectivity and minimal activity loss are achieved in propane dehydrogenation due to the interaction between Platinum and Zinc. Characterization techniques are employed to elucidate the active phases in Platinum-silver catalysts, as their catalytic performance critically depends on the bimetallic Platinum-silver phases. The behavior of Platinum-silver alloy phases is observed during reactions over both catalysts, with distinct influences from Aluminum oxide and zinc aluminum oxide supports on these phases. Different Platinum-silver alloy phases result in varying coke mobility across catalysts, ultimately affecting catalyst stability.

          The study focused on comparing the catalytic performance of PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. It was found that the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst exhibited stronger resistance to catalytic deactivation compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. This enhanced stability is attributed to the faster movement of coke from the metal surface to the support, as evidenced by TGA measurements. The stability of the PtSn catalysts is influenced by the formation and transition of different PtSn alloy phases, leading to differences in coke mobility. The amount of coke generated during the reaction was quantified using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As the time on stream (TOS) increased, the coke content naturally increased on both catalysts. In the first cycle, the initial conversion over PtSn/Al was 54.9% and the final conversion was 34.6%, whereas over PtSn/ZnAlO, the initial conversion was 59.1% and the final conversion was 48.1%. These findings indicate that the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst offers improved stability and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

          研究集中于比较PtSn/Al2O3和PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能。研究发现，PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在催化失活方面表现出更强的抵抗力，相较于PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。这种增强的稳定性归因于从金属表面到支撑物的焦炭更快的移动性，这在TGA测量中得到证实。PtSn催化剂的稳定性受到不同PtSn合金相形成和转换的影响，导致焦炭移动性的差异。反应过程中产生的焦炭量通过热重分析（TGA）量化。随着上流时间（TOS）的增加，两种催化剂上的焦炭含量自然增加。在第一周期中，PtSn/Al上的初始转化率为54.9%，最终转化率为34.6%，而PtSn/ZnAlO上的初始转化率为59.1%，最终转化率为48.1%。这些发现表明，PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中提供改进的稳定性和选择性。
