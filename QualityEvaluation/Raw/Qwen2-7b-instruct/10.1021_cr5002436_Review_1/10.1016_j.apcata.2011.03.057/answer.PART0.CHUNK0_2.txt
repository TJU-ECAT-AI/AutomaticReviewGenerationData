[1] "The primary production method of propylene in the petrochem- ical industry is naphtha cracking, wherein ethylene is co-produced."
[2] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethy- lene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[3] "As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been consid- ered to address the propylene shortfall."
[4] "The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a pos- itive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins."
[5] "Zn has been used as an additive and a support, due to its neu- tral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength."
[6] "Wang et al. [11] reported that ZnO modified Pt dispersion and the interaction between the metal and support in the PtSn catalyst, resulting in high catalytic performance in terms of the stability and selectivity."
[7] "The route for synthesizing the supports also has a strong influence on the activity and coke tolerance in paraffin dehydrogenation [12]."
[8] "A zinc aluminate support showed high catalytic performance with a PtSn bimetallic system in paraffin dehydrogenation [13,14]."
[9] "Various characterization techniques have been applied to understand the active phases in PtSn catalysts, since the catalytic performance strongly depends on the PtSn bimetallic phases."
[10] "In this study, we prepared PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts and compared their catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation."
[11] "To better understand the relationship between the catalytic stability and the PtSn bimetallic alloy system, the PtSn bimetallic phases were investigated through CO chemisorp- tion, XRD, XPS, TPR, and HRTEM with fresh and spent catalysts."
[12] "The formation and transition of PtSn alloy phases were directly observed during the reaction over both catalysts and the dif- ferent influences of the Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 supports on the behavior of PtSn alloy phases."
[13] "Moreover, the different PtSn alloy phases led to differences in the coke mobility over the catalysts and eventually had a strong effect on the catalyst stability."
[14] "The addition of Sn as a promoter apparently lessened the 
coke generation."
[15] "In addition, the use of ZnAl2O4 led to a decrease in coke content."
[16] "Therefore, the ZnAl2O4 support plays an impor- tant role in the suppression of the generation of coke during the reaction."
[17] "For quantitative comparison, the initial and final conversions over PtSn/Al, in the first cycle,were 54.9 and 34.6%, respectively while those over PtSn/ZnAlO were 59.1 and 48.1%, respectively."
[18] "This observation indicates that a remarkable improvement of catalytic stability was obtained over PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst."
[19] "The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst."

The document compares noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, with metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts are known for their stability and selectivity towards olefin production. Metal oxide catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are used for their neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength. These metal oxides can enhance the performance of platinum catalysts in terms of stability and selectivity. Zinc aluminate supports have been found to show high catalytic performance with platinum-silver bimetallic systems in the dehydrogenation of paraffins. Different characterization techniques are used to understand the active phases in platinum-silver catalysts, which significantly affect their catalytic performance. In the study, PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts were prepared and compared for their catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed a stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation than the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. The stability of the PtSn catalysts depends on the type of PtSn alloy, affecting the coke transport phenomena. The use of zinc aluminate as a support led to a decrease in coke content and facilitated the transport of coke from metallic sites to the support, enhancing the catalyst's stability.

The industrial application of these catalysts is in the petrochemical industry, specifically for producing propylene through the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst stability, selectivity, and reducing coke formation. The advantages of these catalysts include high efficiency, reduced coke formation, and improved stability.

文档比较了贵金属催化剂，特别是铂金，与金属氧化物催化剂在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。铂催化剂以其稳定性、选择性生产烯烃而闻名。金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，因其中性特性、高热稳定性和机械强度而被使用。这些金属氧化物可以增强铂催化剂的稳定性和选择性性能。锌铝酸盐支持已被发现具有高催化性能与铂银双金属系统在烷基化脱氢。不同的表征技术用于理解铂银催化剂的活性相，这显著影响其催化性能。在研究中，制备了PtSn/Al2O3和PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂，并进行了丙烷脱氢的催化性能比较。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂的催化失活耐受性比PtSn/Al2O3催化剂更强。PtSn催化剂的稳定性取决于PtSn合金类型，影响焦炭运输现象。将锌铝酸盐用作支持物导致焦炭含量减少，并促进了从金属点到支持物的焦炭运输，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。

这些催化剂在石油化学工业中的工业应用是通过非氧化脱氢丙烷生产丙烯。最近的发展集中在提高催化剂的稳定性、选择性和减少焦炭形成。这些催化剂的优势包括高效、减少焦炭形成和提高稳定性。
