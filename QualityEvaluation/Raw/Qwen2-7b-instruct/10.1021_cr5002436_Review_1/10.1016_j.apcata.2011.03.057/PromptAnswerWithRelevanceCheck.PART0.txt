The literature discusses the comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are used in industrial processes to convert lighter hydrocarbons into more valuable olefinic products. Platinum-based catalysts are effective due to their ability to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, often showing higher stability and selectivity towards olefin formation. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, may offer alternative pathways for the reaction, sometimes with different selectivities or efficiencies depending on the specific oxide and reaction conditions. Recent developments in the field focus on improving catalyst stability, enhancing selectivity, and reducing the environmental impact of these processes. Potential advantages of these catalysts include improved efficiency, lower energy consumption, and the ability to handle a wider range of feedstocks. Industrial applications of these catalysts span various sectors, including petrochemical refining, chemical manufacturing, and renewable energy technologies. However, the literature does not provide specific details on compositions, effectiveness, or industrial applications for each type of catalyst, nor does it mention recent developments or potential advantages beyond general statements.

This study compared the catalytic performance of PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation. The study proposes that this is due to the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support. The stability of the PtSn catalysts is influenced by the formation and transition of different PtSn alloy phases, which leads to different coke mobilities. The amount of coke generated during the reaction was measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The coke content increased with time on the stream (TOS) on both catalysts. The initial and final conversions over PtSn/Al in the first cycle were 54.9% and 34.6%, respectively, while over PtSn/ZnAlO they were 59.1% and 48.1%, respectively.

本研究比较了PtSn/Al2O3和PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂表现出更强的催化失活容忍度。研究提出，这是由于金属表面到支撑物的焦炭移动性较快所致。PtSn催化剂稳定性受不同PtSn合金相形成和过渡的影响，导致不同的焦炭移动性。反应过程中生成的焦炭量通过热重分析（TGA）进行测量。随着时间上流（TOS）的增加，两种催化剂上的焦炭含量自然增加。第一轮中，PtSn/Al的初始和最终转化率分别为54.9%和34.6%，而PtSn/ZnAlO分别为59.1%和48.1%。

The document compares noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, with metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts are known for their stability and selectivity towards olefin production. Metal oxide catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are used for their neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength. These metal oxides can enhance the performance of platinum catalysts in terms of stability and selectivity. Zinc aluminate supports have been found to show high catalytic performance with platinum-silver bimetallic systems in the dehydrogenation of paraffins. Different characterization techniques are used to understand the active phases in platinum-silver catalysts, which significantly affect their catalytic performance. In the study, PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts were prepared and compared for their catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed a stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation than the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. The stability of the PtSn catalysts depends on the type of PtSn alloy, affecting the coke transport phenomena. The use of zinc aluminate as a support led to a decrease in coke content and facilitated the transport of coke from metallic sites to the support, enhancing the catalyst's stability.

The industrial application of these catalysts is in the petrochemical industry, specifically for producing propylene through the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst stability, selectivity, and reducing coke formation. The advantages of these catalysts include high efficiency, reduced coke formation, and improved stability.

文档比较了贵金属催化剂，特别是铂金，与金属氧化物催化剂在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。铂催化剂以其稳定性、选择性生产烯烃而闻名。金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，因其中性特性、高热稳定性和机械强度而被使用。这些金属氧化物可以增强铂催化剂的稳定性和选择性性能。锌铝酸盐支持已被发现具有高催化性能与铂银双金属系统在烷基化脱氢。不同的表征技术用于理解铂银催化剂的活性相，这显著影响其催化性能。在研究中，制备了PtSn/Al2O3和PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂，并进行了丙烷脱氢的催化性能比较。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂的催化失活耐受性比PtSn/Al2O3催化剂更强。PtSn催化剂的稳定性取决于PtSn合金类型，影响焦炭运输现象。将锌铝酸盐用作支持物导致焦炭含量减少，并促进了从金属点到支持物的焦炭运输，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。

这些催化剂在石油化学工业中的工业应用是通过非氧化脱氢丙烷生产丙烯。最近的发展集中在提高催化剂的稳定性、选择性和减少焦炭形成。这些催化剂的优势包括高效、减少焦炭形成和提高稳定性。

This research focuses on the comparative analysis of PtSn-based catalysts on Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 supports for propane dehydrogenation. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst demonstrated superior tolerance against catalytic deactivation compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. The study attributes this enhanced stability to the faster mobility of coke from the metal surface to the support, as observed through XPS measurements. XRD and HRTEM analyses revealed that the bimetallic phase transformation varied between the two catalysts, with distinct formation of PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys on the reduced catalysts. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst retained the PtSn alloy throughout the reaction, while the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst transitioned from PtSn to Pt3Sn. The differences in alloy formation and phase transition led to variations in coke mobility, impacting the catalyst's stability. Zinc oxide (ZnO) was utilized as an additive and support due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength. ZnO modification improved the Pt dispersion and interaction within the PtSn catalyst, enhancing stability and selectivity. The research highlights the importance of support selection in influencing catalyst performance and stability in propane dehydrogenation processes.

这项研究侧重于对Al2O3和ZnAl2O4支持上PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的比较分析。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在催化失活方面表现出更强的耐受性，与PtSn/Al2O3催化剂相比。研究将这种增强的稳定性归因于从金属表面到支撑物的焦炭更快的移动性，这是通过XPS测量观察到的。XRD和HRTEM分析显示，两种催化剂中合金相转变有所不同，在还原催化剂中形成了PtSn和Pt3Sn合金。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在整个反应过程中保持了PtSn合金，而PtSn/Al2O3催化剂从PtSn转变为Pt3Sn。不同的合金形成和相转变导致焦炭移动性的变化，影响了催化剂的稳定性。氧化锌（ZnO）被用作添加剂和支持物，由于其中性特性、高热稳定性和机械强度。ZnO修饰提高了Pt的分散度和PtSn催化剂内部的相互作用，增强了稳定性和选择性。研究表明，支持的选择对于影响丙烷脱氢过程的催化剂性能和稳定性至关重要。
