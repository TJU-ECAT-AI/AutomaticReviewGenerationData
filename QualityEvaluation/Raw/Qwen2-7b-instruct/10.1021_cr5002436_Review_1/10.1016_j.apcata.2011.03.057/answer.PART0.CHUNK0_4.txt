[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[2] "Zn has been used as an additive and a support, due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength."
[3] "The formation and transition of PtSn alloy phases were directly observed during the reaction over both catalysts and the dif- ferent influences of the Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 supports on the behavior of PtSn alloy phases."
[4] "With the Al2O3 support, the coke contents were 4.1 and 6.1 wt% whereas the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst generated only 2.5 and 4.9 wt% coke."
[5] "This observation indicates that the high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, which was proven by XPS measurement."

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the importance of Platinum due to its ability to modify electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst. Metal oxide-based catalysts, like ZnO, are noted for their neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength. The stability of PtSn-supported catalysts is discussed, with a focus on the role of ZnAl2O4 as a support that leads to enhanced stability due to faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support. This phenomenon is substantiated by XPS measurements. The literature also provides insights into the formation and transformation of PtSn alloy phases over the catalysts, influenced by the type of support used.

文献讨论了贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。它强调了铂的作用，因为它能够修改催化剂的电子和几何性质。锌氧化物等金属氧化物由于其中性特性、高热稳定性和机械强度而被用作添加剂和支持材料。对铂锡支持催化剂的稳定性进行了讨论，重点是锌铝氧化物作为支持材料如何通过加快从金属表面到支持体的焦炭移动性来提高稳定性，这一现象得到了XPS测量的支持。文献还提供了关于铂锡合金相在催化剂上的形成和转化的见解，这些转化受到所使用支持体类型的影响。
