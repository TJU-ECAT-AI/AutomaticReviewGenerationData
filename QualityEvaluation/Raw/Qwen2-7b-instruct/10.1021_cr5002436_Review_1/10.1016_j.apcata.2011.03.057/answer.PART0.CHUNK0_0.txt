[1] "Propane dehydrogenation on PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 was performed, and the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed a stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation than the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[2] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[3] "The role of tin is proposed to modify the electronic and geometric properties of Pt by forming PtSn alloys and dilution Pt sites, respectively."
[4] "The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins."
[5] "Zn has been used as an additive and a support, due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength."
[6] "Wang et al. [11] reported that ZnO modified Pt dispersion and the interaction between the metal and support in the PtSn catalyst, resulting in high catalytic performance in terms of the stability and selectivity."
[7] "In Zn-doped PtSn catalysts, the high selectivity and low activity loss were obtained in propane dehydrogenation, due to the interaction between Pt and Zn."
[8] "Various characterization techniques have been applied to understand the active phases in PtSn catalysts, since the catalytic performance strongly depends on the PtSn bimetallic phases."
[9] "The formation and transition of PtSn alloy phases were directly observed during the reaction over both catalysts and the different influences of the Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 supports on the behavior of PtSn alloy phases."
[10] "The different PtSn alloy phases led to differences in the coke mobility over the catalysts and eventually had a strong effect on the catalyst stability."

The literature discusses the comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are used in industrial processes to convert lighter hydrocarbons into more valuable olefinic products. Platinum-based catalysts are effective due to their ability to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, often showing higher stability and selectivity towards olefin formation. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, may offer alternative pathways for the reaction, sometimes with different selectivities or efficiencies depending on the specific oxide and reaction conditions. Recent developments in the field focus on improving catalyst stability, enhancing selectivity, and reducing the environmental impact of these processes. Potential advantages of these catalysts include improved efficiency, lower energy consumption, and the ability to handle a wider range of feedstocks. Industrial applications of these catalysts span various sectors, including petrochemical refining, chemical manufacturing, and renewable energy technologies. However, the literature does not provide specific details on compositions, effectiveness, or industrial applications for each type of catalyst, nor does it mention recent developments or potential advantages beyond general statements.
