[1] "Propane dehydrogenation on PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 was performed, and the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed a stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation than the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[2] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."
[3] "Zn has been used as an additive and a support, due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength."
[4] "Wang et al. [11] reported that ZnO modified Pt dispersion and the interaction between the metal and support in the PtSn catalyst, resulting in high catalytic performance in terms of the stability and selectivity."
[5] "The formation and transition of PtSn alloy phases were directly observed during the reaction over both catalysts and the different influences of the Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 supports on the behavior of PtSn alloy phases."
[6] "The addition of Sn as a promoter apparently lessened the coke generation. In addition, the use of ZnAl2O4 led to a decrease in coke content."
[7] "The data indicated that, in the case of the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst, coke formed on the PtSn alloys had a high mobility and transported to the ZnAlO support."

This research focuses on the comparative analysis of PtSn-based catalysts on Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 supports for propane dehydrogenation. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst demonstrated superior tolerance against catalytic deactivation compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. The study attributes this enhanced stability to the faster mobility of coke from the metal surface to the support, as observed through XPS measurements. XRD and HRTEM analyses revealed that the bimetallic phase transformation varied between the two catalysts, with distinct formation of PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys on the reduced catalysts. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst retained the PtSn alloy throughout the reaction, while the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst transitioned from PtSn to Pt3Sn. The differences in alloy formation and phase transition led to variations in coke mobility, impacting the catalyst's stability. Zinc oxide (ZnO) was utilized as an additive and support due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and mechanical strength. ZnO modification improved the Pt dispersion and interaction within the PtSn catalyst, enhancing stability and selectivity. The research highlights the importance of support selection in influencing catalyst performance and stability in propane dehydrogenation processes.

这项研究侧重于对Al2O3和ZnAl2O4支持上PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的比较分析。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在催化失活方面表现出更强的耐受性，与PtSn/Al2O3催化剂相比。研究将这种增强的稳定性归因于从金属表面到支撑物的焦炭更快的移动性，这是通过XPS测量观察到的。XRD和HRTEM分析显示，两种催化剂中合金相转变有所不同，在还原催化剂中形成了PtSn和Pt3Sn合金。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在整个反应过程中保持了PtSn合金，而PtSn/Al2O3催化剂从PtSn转变为Pt3Sn。不同的合金形成和相转变导致焦炭移动性的变化，影响了催化剂的稳定性。氧化锌（ZnO）被用作添加剂和支持物，由于其中性特性、高热稳定性和机械强度。ZnO修饰提高了Pt的分散度和PtSn催化剂内部的相互作用，增强了稳定性和选择性。研究表明，支持的选择对于影响丙烷脱氢过程的催化剂性能和稳定性至关重要。
