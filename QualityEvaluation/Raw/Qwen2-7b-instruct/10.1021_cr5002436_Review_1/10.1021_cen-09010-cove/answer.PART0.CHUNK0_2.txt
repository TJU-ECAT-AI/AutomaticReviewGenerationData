The document does not contain specific details comparing and contrasting noble metal-based catalysts (such as Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It focuses on the impact of shale gas on the North American petrochemical industry and the investment strategies of companies in this sector. Therefore, I cannot provide answers to the questions based on the information available in the document.
