10. "Executives are learning to invest in North America again."
2. "The new output has driven U.S. natural gas prices below $3.00 per million Btu for the first time in more than a decade."
3. "The cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb."
4. "Shale has since become the source of more than one-quarter of the natural gas produced in the U.S."
5. "Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemicals have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene."
6. "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons."
7. "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to."
8. "Profit margins for ethylene on the spot market are now the highest they have been since 1988."
