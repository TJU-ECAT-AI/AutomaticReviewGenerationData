<quotes>
[1] "Executives are learning to invest in North America again."
[2] "Five companies - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical - have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene."
[3] "Theres a good possibility that more companies will unveil such plans in 2012."
[4] "Beyond large projects, nearly every producer of ethylene or derivatives is contemplating expansions to take advantage of low raw material costs."
[5] "For example, the rosy North American outlook was important to Indoramas $795 million purchase of an ethylene glycol plant in Clear Lake, Texas, from Old World Industries last month."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The shale boom is significantly impacting the North American petrochemical industry. Executives are reevaluating their investments, with numerous companies planning large-scale complexes to produce ethylene and derivatives. This trend is expected to continue in 2012, as nearly every producer considers expansions to utilize the low raw material costs. The positive outlook in North America influenced Indorama's decision to purchase an ethylene glycol plant in Texas.

The document does not contain specific details comparing and contrasting noble metal-based catalysts (such as Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It focuses on the impact of shale gas on the North American petrochemical industry and the investment strategies of companies in this sector. Therefore, I cannot provide answers to the questions based on the information available in the document.

10. "Executives are learning to invest in North America again."
2. "The new output has driven U.S. natural gas prices below $3.00 per million Btu for the first time in more than a decade."
3. "The cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb."
4. "Shale has since become the source of more than one-quarter of the natural gas produced in the U.S."
5. "Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemicals have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene."
6. "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons."
7. "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to."
8. "Profit margins for ethylene on the spot market are now the highest they have been since 1988."
9. "Low natural gas prices have caused gas exploration companies to cut back on drilling."
10. "The only thing that can meaningfully affect the drilling for gas liquids is if we get a sharp correction in oil prices."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the impact of shale gas on the North American petrochemical industry, highlighting the shift towards investing in North America, the reduction in natural gas prices, the cost advantage of using ethane over naphtha as a feedstock, the increase in ethane usage in ethylene production, the preference for drilling natural gas liquids over natural gas, and the potential effects of oil price changes on drilling activities. It also mentions several companies planning new complexes for making ethylene and derivatives, emphasizing the growing role of natural gas liquids in the petrochemical sector and the high profitability of ethylene production.

[6] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to."
[7] "Chevron Phillips Chemical CEO Peter L. Cella outlined the economics at play that promise to yield ethane for the petrochemical industry."
[8] "This is the reason why the gas companies that are pulling back on natural gas drilling are also reassuring investors that they are increasing exploration for natural gas liquids."
[9] "Ethane oversupply is hitting the market from all this drilling."
[10] "With its success tied to petrochemical makers that buy natural gas liquids, the gas industry needs chemical companies to build more capacity."
