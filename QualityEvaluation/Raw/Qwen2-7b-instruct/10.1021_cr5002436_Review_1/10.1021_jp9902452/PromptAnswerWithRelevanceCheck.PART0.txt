The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The platinum catalysts are characterized by their ability to adsorb ethylene at temperatures lower than 173 K on both the platinum and silica components, leading to an average adsorption heat for Pt/SiO2 samples. At higher temperatures, ethylene preferentially occupies the platinum sites, creating adsorption plateaus corresponding to ethylene adsorption on platinum and silica surfaces. Adsorption of ethylene at temperatures from 173 to 233 K results in the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species on the surface of the Pt/SiO2 catalyst. The addition of tin to the platinum catalysts decreases the formation of ethylidyne species, promoting the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species. Quantum calculations reveal that tin transfers electrons to platinum, weakening the interaction of ethylidyne species with 3-fold hollow sites composed of three adjacent platinum atoms.

Advantages of using platinum catalysts include their high activity and selectivity for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, they can be expensive and require careful management to avoid poisoning or deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer alternative routes to dehydrogenation. These catalysts can often be cheaper and more stable than noble metals, but they might require higher operating temperatures or more complex synthesis conditions. Recent developments in this field aim to improve the stability and efficiency of these catalysts, often through the incorporation of novel metal oxides or the use of supported catalyst systems. The choice between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts depends on factors such as cost, operational conditions, and the specific requirements of the chemical process.

文档讨论了用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物基催化剂的应用。铂催化剂因其在低于173 K的温度下能够吸附乙烯在铂和二氧化硅上的特性而被描述。在较高的温度下，乙烯倾向于占据铂位点，形成与铂和二氧化硅表面对应的吸附平台。在173到233 K的温度范围内，乙烯在铂/SiO2催化剂表面上吸附导致π键和di-σ键乙烯物种的形成。向铂中添加锡减少了乙炔物种的形成，促进了铂在室温下形成的π键和di-σ键乙烯物种的生成。量子计算显示，锡向铂转移电子，显著减弱了乙炔物种与三个相邻铂原子组成的3折空位之间的相互作用。

铂催化剂的优点包括高活性和非氧化脱氢反应的选择性。然而，它们可能价格昂贵，并且需要仔细管理以避免中毒或失活。金属氧化物催化剂，如铬氧化物、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，提供了替代的途径。这些催化剂通常更便宜且稳定性更好，但可能需要更高的操作温度或更复杂的合成条件。该领域的近期发展旨在提高这些催化剂的稳定性和效率，通常通过引入新型金属氧化物或使用支持催化剂系统实现。选择贵金属基或金属氧化物基催化剂取决于成本、操作条件以及化学过程的具体要求。

The noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, are extensively used in the chemical and petrochemical industries for hydrocarbon processing reactions like hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, aromatization, and hydrogenolysis. These catalysts are characterized by their ability to efficiently facilitate these reactions. In the study, platinum catalysts were prepared with varying amounts of tin (atomic ratios of 7:1, 3:1, and 1:2) to observe their impact on ethylene adsorption. The adsorption of ethylene at temperatures ranging from 173 to 233 K led to the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species on the surface of the platinum catalyst. Under these conditions, the heat of adsorption was approximately 125 kJ/mol. At temperatures lower than 173 K, ethylene adsorption occurred on both platinum and silica surfaces, resulting in an average adsorption heat for the platinum-silica composite. The addition of tin to the platinum significantly reduced the formation of ethylidyne species, promoting the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species instead. Quantum calculations utilizing density functional theory (DFT) showed that the presence of tin weakens the interaction of ethylidyne species with 3-fold hollow sites on platinum surfaces.

贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，广泛应用于化学和石油化工行业的烃类加工反应，如氢化、脱氢、异构化、芳构化和氢解。这些催化剂因其高效促进这些反应的能力而受到重视。研究中，通过调整铂与锡的原子比例（分别为7:1、3:1和1:2）制备了催化剂，以观察其对乙烷吸附的影响。在173至233 K的温度下，乙烷在铂催化剂表面吸附时形成了π键和双σ键的乙烷物种。在此条件下，吸附热约为125 kJ/mol。当温度低于173 K时，乙烷在铂和二氧化硅表面上吸附，导致铂-二氧化硅复合材料的平均吸附热。向铂中添加锡显著减少了乙基炔物种的形成，促进了π键和双σ键乙烷物种的生成。量子计算利用密度泛函理论（DFT）显示，锡的存在削弱了乙基炔物种与铂表面3折空位的相互作用。

The study explores the adsorption of ethylene on noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, focusing on their effectiveness in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Key findings include:

1. At temperatures below 173 K, ethylene adsorption on Platinum leads to π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species, with heats of adsorption around 125 kJ/mol.
2. At room temperature, ethylene adsorption on Platinum forms predominantly ethylidyne species, with a heat of adsorption estimated at 157 kJ/mol.
3. The addition of tin to Platinum catalysts reduces the formation of ethylidyne species, promoting π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species formation.
4. Quantum chemical calculations indicate tin donates electrons to Platinum, weakening the interaction between ethylidyne species and Platinum atoms.

While the document focuses on Platinum and its alloys, it does not extensively compare them to other noble metals or metal oxides in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Therefore, the comparison to other catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides is limited. The document's emphasis is on understanding the specific interactions of ethylene with Platinum and how these are altered by the addition of tin.

Advantages of Platinum-based catalysts in this context include their ability to form strong, stable bonds with ethylene, leading to the formation of ethylidyne species. The addition of tin modifies this interaction, potentially shifting the catalytic pathway towards more desirable products in nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Industrial applications of Platinum catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions are well-established, often utilized for processes requiring high selectivity and stability. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst performance, stability, and reducing environmental impact, including exploring the role of alloying elements like tin.

For metal oxide-based catalysts, their comparative advantage might lie in their stability at higher temperatures, resistance to sintering, and broader tunability in reactivity through doping or surface modification. However, they typically require higher operating temperatures, which can limit their applicability in certain industrial settings.

In conclusion, while Platinum catalysts offer high selectivity and efficiency in nonoxidative dehydrogenation, the addition of tin modifies this selectivity, potentially opening new pathways for product distribution. Metal oxides, on the other hand, might offer a more robust platform for higher temperature reactions, with ongoing research aiming to optimize their performance and tailor their reactivity through advanced synthesis techniques.

4. 量子化学计算表明，锡向铂捐赠电子，减弱了乙炔物种与铂原子之间的相互作用。

虽然文档重点研究了铂及其合金，但并未广泛比较它们与其他贵金属或金属氧化物在非氧化脱氢反应中的应用。因此，对其他催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的比较有限。文档的主要关注点是理解乙烯与铂的具体相互作用以及添加锡如何改变这种相互作用。

铂基催化剂在这一领域的优势在于其能够形成稳定且强大的与乙烯的结合，导致乙炔物种的形成。添加锡修改了这种相互作用，可能为非氧化脱氢反应开辟新的产物分布途径。

工业应用中，铂催化剂通常用于要求高选择性和稳定性的脱氢反应。最近的发展集中在提高催化剂性能、稳定性和减少环境影响，包括探索添加元素如锡的作用。

对于金属氧化物催化剂而言，它们在高温下的稳定性、抗聚集性以及通过掺杂或表面改性调整活性的灵活性可能成为优势。然而，它们通常需要更高的操作温度，这可能限制其在某些工业设置中的应用。

总结，虽然铂催化剂在非氧化脱氢中提供高效和选择性，添加锡可以修改这种选择性，有可能开辟新的产物分布途径。金属氧化物催化剂则可能提供一个更稳定的平台进行更高温度反应，同时正在进行的研究旨在优化它们的性能，并通过先进的合成技术定制其活性。
