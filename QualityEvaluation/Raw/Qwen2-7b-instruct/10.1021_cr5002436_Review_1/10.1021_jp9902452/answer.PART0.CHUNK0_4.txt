1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are also utilized. Platinum catalysts are known for their effectiveness in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes. Metal oxide catalysts offer alternatives with different compositions and potential advantages in specific applications.

2. Recent developments in the field include the optimization of catalyst composition, the exploration of novel materials, and the enhancement of catalytic activity and stability. The use of metal oxides, especially those with unique properties, has shown promise in improving the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes.

3. Industrial applications of these catalysts are widespread, including in the petrochemical industry for refining crude oil and producing valuable chemicals. They are crucial in processes like cracking, isomerization, and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.

4. Potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include their high reactivity and selectivity, while metal oxide catalysts can offer lower cost and better stability under harsh conditions. Advances in catalyst design and synthesis aim to combine the benefits of both categories.

5. The literature demonstrates that the addition of tin to platinum catalysts decreases the extent of ethylidyne species formation, promoting the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that tin introduces an electron transfer from itself to platinum, weakening the bonding of ethylidyne species with platinum surfaces.

6. The presence of tin alters the electronic structure of platinum, leading to enhanced repulsion between ethylidyne species and platinum atoms. This effect is more pronounced for ethylidyne species than for π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species, contributing to the suppression of ethylidyne formation.

1. 非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）被广泛应用。铂催化剂在加氢和脱氢过程中表现出高效性。金属氧化物催化剂因其不同的组成和潜在优势，在特定应用中显示出吸引力。

2. 最近的研究进展集中在催化剂组分的优化、新材料的探索以及催化活性和稳定性的增强上。特别是对金属氧化物的利用，通过独特的性质提高脱氢过程的效率显示出巨大潜力。

3. 这些催化剂在石油化工行业中有广泛的应用，包括原油精炼和化学品生产。它们对于裂解、异构化和脱氢等过程至关重要。

4. 贵金属基催化剂的优势在于其高反应性和选择性，而金属氧化物催化剂则可能提供较低的成本和更好的耐受苛刻条件的能力。催化剂设计和合成的进步旨在结合这两种类别的优点。

5. 文献表明，将锡添加到铂催化剂中会减少乙炔基物种的形成，促进π键和二σ键乙烯物种的形成。量子化学计算显示，锡向铂引入电子转移，削弱了乙炔基物种与铂表面的结合力。

6. 锡的存在改变了铂的电子结构，导致乙炔基物种与铂原子之间的排斥作用增强。这种效应在乙炔基物种中的表现比π键和二σ键乙烯物种更为显著，从而抑制了乙炔基物种的形成。
