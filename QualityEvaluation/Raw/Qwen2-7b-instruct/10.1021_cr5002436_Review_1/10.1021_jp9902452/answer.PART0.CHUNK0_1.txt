The noble metal-based catalysts, especially platinum, are extensively used in the chemical and petrochemical industries for hydrocarbon processing reactions like hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, aromatization, and hydrogenolysis. These catalysts are characterized by their ability to efficiently facilitate these reactions. In the study, platinum catalysts were prepared with varying amounts of tin (atomic ratios of 7:1, 3:1, and 1:2) to observe their impact on ethylene adsorption. The adsorption of ethylene at temperatures ranging from 173 to 233 K led to the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species on the surface of the platinum catalyst. Under these conditions, the heat of adsorption was approximately 125 kJ/mol. At temperatures lower than 173 K, ethylene adsorption occurred on both platinum and silica surfaces, resulting in an average adsorption heat for the platinum-silica composite. The addition of tin to the platinum significantly reduced the formation of ethylidyne species, promoting the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species instead. Quantum calculations utilizing density functional theory (DFT) showed that the presence of tin weakens the interaction of ethylidyne species with 3-fold hollow sites on platinum surfaces.

贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，广泛应用于化学和石油化工行业的烃类加工反应，如氢化、脱氢、异构化、芳构化和氢解。这些催化剂因其高效促进这些反应的能力而受到重视。研究中，通过调整铂与锡的原子比例（分别为7:1、3:1和1:2）制备了催化剂，以观察其对乙烷吸附的影响。在173至233 K的温度下，乙烷在铂催化剂表面吸附时形成了π键和双σ键的乙烷物种。在此条件下，吸附热约为125 kJ/mol。当温度低于173 K时，乙烷在铂和二氧化硅表面上吸附，导致铂-二氧化硅复合材料的平均吸附热。向铂中添加锡显著减少了乙基炔物种的形成，促进了π键和双σ键乙烷物种的生成。量子计算利用密度泛函理论（DFT）显示，锡的存在削弱了乙基炔物种与铂表面3折空位的相互作用。
