The study explores the adsorption of ethylene on noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, focusing on their effectiveness in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Key findings include:

1. At temperatures below 173 K, ethylene adsorption on Platinum leads to π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species, with heats of adsorption around 125 kJ/mol.
2. At room temperature, ethylene adsorption on Platinum forms predominantly ethylidyne species, with a heat of adsorption estimated at 157 kJ/mol.
3. The addition of tin to Platinum catalysts reduces the formation of ethylidyne species, promoting π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species formation.
4. Quantum chemical calculations indicate tin donates electrons to Platinum, weakening the interaction between ethylidyne species and Platinum atoms.

While the document focuses on Platinum and its alloys, it does not extensively compare them to other noble metals or metal oxides in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Therefore, the comparison to other catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides is limited. The document's emphasis is on understanding the specific interactions of ethylene with Platinum and how these are altered by the addition of tin.

Advantages of Platinum-based catalysts in this context include their ability to form strong, stable bonds with ethylene, leading to the formation of ethylidyne species. The addition of tin modifies this interaction, potentially shifting the catalytic pathway towards more desirable products in nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Industrial applications of Platinum catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions are well-established, often utilized for processes requiring high selectivity and stability. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst performance, stability, and reducing environmental impact, including exploring the role of alloying elements like tin.

For metal oxide-based catalysts, their comparative advantage might lie in their stability at higher temperatures, resistance to sintering, and broader tunability in reactivity through doping or surface modification. However, they typically require higher operating temperatures, which can limit their applicability in certain industrial settings.

In conclusion, while Platinum catalysts offer high selectivity and efficiency in nonoxidative dehydrogenation, the addition of tin modifies this selectivity, potentially opening new pathways for product distribution. Metal oxides, on the other hand, might offer a more robust platform for higher temperature reactions, with ongoing research aiming to optimize their performance and tailor their reactivity through advanced synthesis techniques.

研究探讨了铂基催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，重点关注它们在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的效果。关键发现包括：

1. 在低于173 K的温度下，乙烯在铂上的吸附产生π键和双-σ键乙烯物种，吸附热约为125 kJ/mol。
2. 在室温下，乙烯在铂上的吸附主要形成乙炔物种，吸附热估计为157 kJ/mol。
3. 铂合金中添加锡减少了乙炔物种的形成，促进了π键和双-σ键乙烯物种的形成。
4. 量子化学计算表明，锡向铂捐赠电子，减弱了乙炔物种与铂原子之间的相互作用。

虽然文档重点研究了铂及其合金，但并未广泛比较它们与其他贵金属或金属氧化物在非氧化脱氢反应中的应用。因此，对其他催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的比较有限。文档的主要关注点是理解乙烯与铂的具体相互作用以及添加锡如何改变这种相互作用。

铂基催化剂在这一领域的优势在于其能够形成稳定且强大的与乙烯的结合，导致乙炔物种的形成。添加锡修改了这种相互作用，可能为非氧化脱氢反应开辟新的产物分布途径。

工业应用中，铂催化剂通常用于要求高选择性和稳定性的脱氢反应。最近的发展集中在提高催化剂性能、稳定性和减少环境影响，包括探索添加元素如锡的作用。

对于金属氧化物催化剂而言，它们在高温下的稳定性、抗聚集性以及通过掺杂或表面改性调整活性的灵活性可能成为优势。然而，它们通常需要更高的操作温度，这可能限制其在某些工业设置中的应用。

总结，虽然铂催化剂在非氧化脱氢中提供高效和选择性，添加锡可以修改这种选择性，有可能开辟新的产物分布途径。金属氧化物催化剂则可能提供一个更稳定的平台进行更高温度反应，同时正在进行的研究旨在优化它们的性能，并通过先进的合成技术定制其活性。
