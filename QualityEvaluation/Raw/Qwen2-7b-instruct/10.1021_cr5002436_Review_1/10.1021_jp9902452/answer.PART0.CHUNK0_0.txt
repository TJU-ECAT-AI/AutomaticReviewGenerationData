The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The platinum catalysts are characterized by their ability to adsorb ethylene at temperatures lower than 173 K on both the platinum and silica components, leading to an average adsorption heat for Pt/SiO2 samples. At higher temperatures, ethylene preferentially occupies the platinum sites, creating adsorption plateaus corresponding to ethylene adsorption on platinum and silica surfaces. Adsorption of ethylene at temperatures from 173 to 233 K results in the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species on the surface of the Pt/SiO2 catalyst. The addition of tin to the platinum catalysts decreases the formation of ethylidyne species, promoting the formation of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene species. Quantum calculations reveal that tin transfers electrons to platinum, weakening the interaction of ethylidyne species with 3-fold hollow sites composed of three adjacent platinum atoms.

Advantages of using platinum catalysts include their high activity and selectivity for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, they can be expensive and require careful management to avoid poisoning or deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer alternative routes to dehydrogenation. These catalysts can often be cheaper and more stable than noble metals, but they might require higher operating temperatures or more complex synthesis conditions. Recent developments in this field aim to improve the stability and efficiency of these catalysts, often through the incorporation of novel metal oxides or the use of supported catalyst systems. The choice between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts depends on factors such as cost, operational conditions, and the specific requirements of the chemical process.

文档讨论了用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物基催化剂的应用。铂催化剂因其在低于173 K的温度下能够吸附乙烯在铂和二氧化硅上的特性而被描述。在较高的温度下，乙烯倾向于占据铂位点，形成与铂和二氧化硅表面对应的吸附平台。在173到233 K的温度范围内，乙烯在铂/SiO2催化剂表面上吸附导致π键和di-σ键乙烯物种的形成。向铂中添加锡减少了乙炔物种的形成，促进了铂在室温下形成的π键和di-σ键乙烯物种的生成。量子计算显示，锡向铂转移电子，显著减弱了乙炔物种与三个相邻铂原子组成的3折空位之间的相互作用。

铂催化剂的优点包括高活性和非氧化脱氢反应的选择性。然而，它们可能价格昂贵，并且需要仔细管理以避免中毒或失活。金属氧化物催化剂，如铬氧化物、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，提供了替代的途径。这些催化剂通常更便宜且稳定性更好，但可能需要更高的操作温度或更复杂的合成条件。该领域的近期发展旨在提高这些催化剂的稳定性和效率，通常通过引入新型金属氧化物或使用支持催化剂系统实现。选择贵金属基或金属氧化物基催化剂取决于成本、操作条件以及化学过程的具体要求。
