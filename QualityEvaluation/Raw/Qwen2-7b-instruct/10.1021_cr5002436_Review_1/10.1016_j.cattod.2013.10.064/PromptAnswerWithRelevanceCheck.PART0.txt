The document focuses on the study of platinum-based catalysts, particularly in the context of dehydrogenating propane, rather than comparing them with metal oxide-based catalysts. It does not extensively discuss metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Therefore, it does not provide a detailed comparison between noble metal-based catalysts (especially Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

However, the document does mention that platinum-tin (PtSn) alloys have been widely studied for their effectiveness in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts show promise in selectively dehydrogenating lower alkanes, suppressing coke formation, and extending catalyst lifetime. The role of tin (Sn) in these PtSn systems is still unclear, indicating a need for further investigation into the precise nature of these systems.

The document discusses the impact of different reduction methods (direct reduction (DR), decomposition in inert gas (DI), and calcination-reduction (CR)) on the structure and activity of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts. This highlights the importance of controlling the interactions between platinum and tin through appropriate catalyst preparation, pretreatment, and regeneration procedures.

In summary, while the document does not extensively compare noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts, it emphasizes the use of platinum-tin alloys in catalytic dehydrogenation processes and the significance of controlling the reduction methods to optimize catalyst performance.

文档主要关注于研究铂基催化剂，特别是在丙烷脱氢方面的应用，而不是比较它们与氧化物基催化剂。它没有详细介绍诸如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物之类的氧化物基催化剂。

然而，文档确实提到了铂锡（PtSn）合金在催化丙烷脱氢方面的广泛应用。这些催化剂显示出在选择性脱氢低烷烃、抑制焦炭形成以及延长催化剂寿命方面的潜力。锡（Sn）在这些PtSn系统中的作用仍然不清楚，这表明需要进一步研究这些系统的精确性质。

文档讨论了不同的还原方法（直接还原（DR）、惰性气体分解（DI）和煅烧还原（CR））对PtSn/SiO2催化剂结构和活性的影响。这强调了通过适当的催化剂制备、预处理和再生程序控制铂和锡之间的相互作用的重要性。

总之，虽然文档没有详细比较贵金属基催化剂与氧化物基催化剂，但它强调了铂锡合金在催化脱氢过程中的使用，并且优化催化剂性能时控制还原方法的重要性。

1. The conventional method in the petrochemical industry for producing light alkenes involves steam cracking of alkanes, naphtha, and gas oil. This process is energetically unfavorable and shows low selectivity towards alkenes. In contrast, catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes provides an alternative method for producing light alkenes and hydrogen.

2. Supported platinum-tin alloy catalysts have been extensively studied for the dehydrogenation of propane. The addition of tin to the platinum system enhances the selectivity towards lower alkane dehydrogenation, reduces coke formation, and extends the catalyst's lifetime.

3. Despite years of research, the precise role of tin in platinum-tin catalysts remains unclear. The nature of the PtSn system is complex, influenced by various factors such as support material, metallic precursors, and preparation procedures.

4. In the current study, three reduction methods—direct reduction, decomposition in inert gas, and calcination-reduction—were employed to prepare PtSn/SiO2 catalysts. These methods resulted in different interactions between platinum and tin, affecting the catalyst's activity and structure.

5. The structure of the PtSn nanoparticles and its correlation with the activity in propane dehydrogenation were discussed in detail.

6. Monometallic platinum catalysts showed low activity and stability, with a propane conversion of around 5%. 

7. In comparison, the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst prepared through direct reduction exhibited the highest activity and selectivity towards propylene, exceeding 99%.

8. The addition of tin to the platinum system resulted in a slight decrease in the BET surface area compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst.

9. The particle sizes of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts ranged from 2.2 to 3.3 nanometers, showing no significant difference in size regardless of the reduction method.

10. Considering the limited amount of adsorbed CO, the surface of the Pt metal on the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst prepared through decomposition in inert gas was likely partially covered with highly dispersed tin oxide (SnO or SnO2).

11. The Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra analysis provided insights into the local structure and electronic state of platinum and tin in the catalysts.

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts, when combined with tin, show enhanced selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the conversion of propane to propylene. The tin addition helps in suppressing coke formation and prolonging catalyst life. However, the precise role of tin within the PtSn system remains unclear. The document outlines the preparation of a series of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts through various reduction methods, highlighting the influence of these methods on the catalyst's structure and activity. The structure of the PtSn nanoparticles is closely tied to the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the direct reduction method leads to the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy nanoparticle, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation compared to other reduction methods. The activity of the catalysts is influenced by the interactions between platinum and tin, and the structure of the resulting alloy. The document does not extensively compare noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of dehydrogenation reactions, but rather focuses on the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst system.

The literature focuses on the effect of reduction method on the activity of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. It discusses the use of platinum-based catalysts, particularly platinum-tin alloys, in the catalytic dehydrogenation process as an alternative to steam cracking for producing light alkenes. The role of tin (Sn) in enhancing the catalytic performance of supported platinum catalysts is highlighted. Three reduction methods—direct reduction (DR), decomposition in inert gas (DI), and calcination-reduction (CR)—are employed to prepare PtSn/SiO2 catalysts. The structure of the catalysts is characterized using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and other techniques. The relationship between the structure of the PtSn nanoparticles and their activity in propane dehydrogenation is explored. Sn is found to improve the catalytic properties, including activity and selectivity, and increase the catalyst lifetime. However, the specific roles of Sn in the PtSn system remain complex and not fully understood. The reduction methods influence the structure and thus the activity of the catalysts, indicating that the number of accessible Pt sites affects the catalytic performance.
