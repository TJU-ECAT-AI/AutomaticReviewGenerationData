1. The conventional method in the petrochemical industry for producing light alkenes involves steam cracking of alkanes, naphtha, and gas oil. This process is energetically unfavorable and shows low selectivity towards alkenes. In contrast, catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes provides an alternative method for producing light alkenes and hydrogen.

2. Supported platinum-tin alloy catalysts have been extensively studied for the dehydrogenation of propane. The addition of tin to the platinum system enhances the selectivity towards lower alkane dehydrogenation, reduces coke formation, and extends the catalyst's lifetime.

3. Despite years of research, the precise role of tin in platinum-tin catalysts remains unclear. The nature of the PtSn system is complex, influenced by various factors such as support material, metallic precursors, and preparation procedures.

4. In the current study, three reduction methods—direct reduction, decomposition in inert gas, and calcination-reduction—were employed to prepare PtSn/SiO2 catalysts. These methods resulted in different interactions between platinum and tin, affecting the catalyst's activity and structure.

5. The structure of the PtSn nanoparticles and its correlation with the activity in propane dehydrogenation were discussed in detail.

6. Monometallic platinum catalysts showed low activity and stability, with a propane conversion of around 5%. 

7. In comparison, the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst prepared through direct reduction exhibited the highest activity and selectivity towards propylene, exceeding 99%.

8. The addition of tin to the platinum system resulted in a slight decrease in the BET surface area compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst.

9. The particle sizes of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts ranged from 2.2 to 3.3 nanometers, showing no significant difference in size regardless of the reduction method.

10. Considering the limited amount of adsorbed CO, the surface of the Pt metal on the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst prepared through decomposition in inert gas was likely partially covered with highly dispersed tin oxide (SnO or SnO2).

11. The Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra analysis provided insights into the local structure and electronic state of platinum and tin in the catalysts.
