The literature focuses on the effect of reduction method on the activity of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. It discusses the use of platinum-based catalysts, particularly platinum-tin alloys, in the catalytic dehydrogenation process as an alternative to steam cracking for producing light alkenes. The role of tin (Sn) in enhancing the catalytic performance of supported platinum catalysts is highlighted. Three reduction methods—direct reduction (DR), decomposition in inert gas (DI), and calcination-reduction (CR)—are employed to prepare PtSn/SiO2 catalysts. The structure of the catalysts is characterized using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and other techniques. The relationship between the structure of the PtSn nanoparticles and their activity in propane dehydrogenation is explored. Sn is found to improve the catalytic properties, including activity and selectivity, and increase the catalyst lifetime. However, the specific roles of Sn in the PtSn system remain complex and not fully understood. The reduction methods influence the structure and thus the activity of the catalysts, indicating that the number of accessible Pt sites affects the catalytic performance.
