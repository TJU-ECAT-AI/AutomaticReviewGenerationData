[C1] "The conventional way of light alkenes in the petrochemical industry is steam cracking of alkanes,naphtha,and gas oil."
[C2] "For example,in the case of steam cracking of naphtha,the yields of ethane and propylene are ca. 30 and 20%,with substantial amounts of by-products including methane and coke."
[C3] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes provides an alternative for producing light alkenes as well as hydrogen."
[C4] "Supported platinum-tin alloy catalysts have been widely studied in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane"
[C5] "The addition of Sn to Pt/support catalyst system has been found to favor selective lower alkane dehydrogenation,suppress the coke formation and increase the lifetime of the catalyst."
[C6] "Despite extensive studies,the role of Sn in a PtSn catalyst remains elusive and the accurate nature of PtSn system is complicated for many years."
[C7] "In the present study,three different reduction procedures (direct reduction (DR),decomposition in inert gas (DI) and calcination-reduction (CR)) were applied to prepare a series of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts with different interactions between platinum and tin."
[C8] "The relationship between the structure of PtSn nanoparticles and activity for propane dehy- drogenation was discussed."
[C9] "The propane conversion on Pt/SiO2 (DR) was quite low (ca. 5%) and sharply declined,indicating that monometallic Pt catalyst showed a low activity and stability."
[C10] "The PtSn/SiO2 (DR) catalyst showed the highest activity and selec- tivity toward propylene (>99%)."
[C11] "The BET specific surface area of Pt/SiO2 (DR) was slightly larger than bare SiO2."
[C12] "When Sn was added into monometallic Pt catalyst system,the BET surface area slightly decreased compared with that of Pt/SiO2 (DR)."
[C13] "The XRD patterns of Pt/SiO2 (DR) and PtSn/SiO2 (DI) exhibit a peak at 2 = 39.8,which is assigned to Pt (1 1 1)."
[C14] "Considering a small amount of adsorbed CO,it is likely that the surface of Pt metal on PtSn/SiO2 (DI) was partially covered with highly dispersed SnO and/or SnO2."
[C15] "The intensities of diffrac- tion lines for Pt3Sn alloy phase are much stronger than those for PtSn alloy phase,suggesting that the major part of PtSn/SiO2 (DR) catalyst possesses the Pt3Sn alloy structure in the fcc arrangement."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts, when combined with tin, show enhanced selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the conversion of propane to propylene. The tin addition helps in suppressing coke formation and prolonging catalyst life. However, the precise role of tin within the PtSn system remains unclear. The document outlines the preparation of a series of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts through various reduction methods, highlighting the influence of these methods on the catalyst's structure and activity. The structure of the PtSn nanoparticles is closely tied to the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the direct reduction method leads to the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy nanoparticle, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation compared to other reduction methods. The activity of the catalysts is influenced by the interactions between platinum and tin, and the structure of the resulting alloy. The document does not extensively compare noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of dehydrogenation reactions, but rather focuses on the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst system.

文档讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂基催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂的应用。当铂与锡结合时，这些铂基催化剂在脱氢反应中的选择性和稳定性显著提高，特别是在丙烷转化为丙烯的过程中。锡的添加有助于抑制焦炭形成并延长催化剂寿命。然而，锡在PtSn系统中的确切作用仍然不清楚。文档概述了通过各种还原方法制备一系列PtSn/SiO2催化剂的方法，强调了这些方法对催化剂结构和活性的影响。PtSn纳米粒子的结构与催化剂的脱氢反应性能密切相关。例如，直接还原方法导致形成Pt3Sn合金纳米颗粒，这比其他还原方法更活跃于丙烷脱氢。催化剂活性受铂和锡之间相互作用以及形成的合金结构的影响。文档没有大量比较贵金属催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应中的应用，而是专注于PtSn/SiO2催化剂系统。
