The document focuses on the study of platinum-based catalysts, particularly in the context of dehydrogenating propane, rather than comparing them with metal oxide-based catalysts. It does not extensively discuss metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Therefore, it does not provide a detailed comparison between noble metal-based catalysts (especially Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

However, the document does mention that platinum-tin (PtSn) alloys have been widely studied for their effectiveness in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts show promise in selectively dehydrogenating lower alkanes, suppressing coke formation, and extending catalyst lifetime. The role of tin (Sn) in these PtSn systems is still unclear, indicating a need for further investigation into the precise nature of these systems.

The document discusses the impact of different reduction methods (direct reduction (DR), decomposition in inert gas (DI), and calcination-reduction (CR)) on the structure and activity of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts. This highlights the importance of controlling the interactions between platinum and tin through appropriate catalyst preparation, pretreatment, and regeneration procedures.

In summary, while the document does not extensively compare noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts, it emphasizes the use of platinum-tin alloys in catalytic dehydrogenation processes and the significance of controlling the reduction methods to optimize catalyst performance.

文档主要关注于研究铂基催化剂，特别是在丙烷脱氢方面的应用，而不是比较它们与氧化物基催化剂。它没有详细介绍诸如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物之类的氧化物基催化剂。

然而，文档确实提到了铂锡（PtSn）合金在催化丙烷脱氢方面的广泛应用。这些催化剂显示出在选择性脱氢低烷烃、抑制焦炭形成以及延长催化剂寿命方面的潜力。锡（Sn）在这些PtSn系统中的作用仍然不清楚，这表明需要进一步研究这些系统的精确性质。

文档讨论了不同的还原方法（直接还原（DR）、惰性气体分解（DI）和煅烧还原（CR））对PtSn/SiO2催化剂结构和活性的影响。这强调了通过适当的催化剂制备、预处理和再生程序控制铂和锡之间的相互作用的重要性。

总之，虽然文档没有详细比较贵金属基催化剂与氧化物基催化剂，但它强调了铂锡合金在催化脱氢过程中的使用，并且优化催化剂性能时控制还原方法的重要性。
