1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, were used in the selective and stable bimetallic PtSn/-Al2O3 catalyst for dehydrogenation of n-butane to n-butenes. This catalyst demonstrated high selectivity and stability, showing better activity than metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.
