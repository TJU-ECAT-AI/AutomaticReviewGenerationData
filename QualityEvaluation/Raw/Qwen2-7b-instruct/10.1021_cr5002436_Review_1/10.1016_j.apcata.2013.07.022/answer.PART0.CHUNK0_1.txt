The document compares noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metal-based catalysts are noted for their high activity and selectivity, making them suitable for the dehydrogenation process. Metal oxide-based catalysts, though less explored, exhibit stability and cost-effectiveness, which could make them attractive alternatives. Recent developments aim to combine the benefits of both types to enhance performance. Industrial applications span petrochemical processes and the production of higher-value chemicals. Noble metal-based catalysts offer superior activity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts provide stability and lower costs.
