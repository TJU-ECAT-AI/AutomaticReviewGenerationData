Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, highlights several key differences. Noble metals, especially Platinum, are noted for their high selectivity and stability, making them highly effective in producing n-butenes from n-butane. They also demonstrate superior performance compared to other catalysts. Recent developments focus on enhancing both selectivity and stability in catalyst design. Metal oxide-based catalysts, while widely used due to their broad availability, typically suffer from lower selectivity and reduced stability. In contrast, noble metals offer higher selectivity and stability but may come with higher costs and scalability challenges. These catalysts are predominantly applied in the petrochemical industry for olefin dehydrogenation processes.
