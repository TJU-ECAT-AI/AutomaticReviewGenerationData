Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the noble metal-based catalysts demonstrate higher activity and selectivity. The PtSn/-Al2O3 catalyst developed in this study shows excellent selectivity towards n-butenes and high stability over multiple reaction cycles. Recent developments in catalyst design have focused on enhancing the synergistic effects between metals to improve both activity and selectivity. Bimetallic catalysts offer the potential for more efficient and environmentally friendly chemical processes in industrial applications.
