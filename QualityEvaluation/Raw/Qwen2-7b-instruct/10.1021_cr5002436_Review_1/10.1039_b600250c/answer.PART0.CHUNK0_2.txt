Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the former are characterized by their high reactivity and stability under harsh conditions, making them highly effective in industrial applications such as the production of ethylene and propylene from naphtha. These catalysts typically require specialized design for recent developments aimed at enhancing selectivity, efficiency, and durability. On the other hand, metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides offer cost-effectiveness and better tolerance to impurities, making them a viable alternative in various industrial processes. The effectiveness of both types of catalysts varies based on the specific chemical reactions and conditions they are subjected to.

比较贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，和金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，前者以其在恶劣条件下的高反应性和稳定性而著称，这使得它们在工业应用中非常有效，例如从石脑油生产乙烯和丙烯。这些催化剂通常需要专门设计以适应近期的发展，以提高选择性、效率和耐用性。另一方面，金属氧化物催化剂如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物因其成本效益和对杂质的更好耐受性而成为各种工业过程的可行替代品。这两种类型的催化剂的有效性基于它们所面临的特定化学反应和条件而变化。
