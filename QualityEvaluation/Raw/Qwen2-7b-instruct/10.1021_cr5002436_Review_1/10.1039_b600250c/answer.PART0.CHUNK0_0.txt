[1] "Introduction Although catalysts have been used since the middle ages in ancient industries such as brewing, it was not until 1836 that the definition of catalysis as a substance that facilitates a reaction was introduced by Berzelius."
[2] "There are two main ways the addition of a second element affects catalysis. These are termed (1) ligand effects and (2) ensemble effects."
[3] "Traditionally platinum or palladium based catalysts have been used but these are rather aggressive catalysts usually leading to complete hydrogenation of every double bond in the target molecule."
[4] "Another major application is in direct oxidation in methanol fuel cells."
[5] "The addition of a second metal to a surface will produce large perturbations in the electronic structure of that surface giving scope to fine tune the catalysts properties for the target reaction."
[6] "The different properties of bimetallic catalysts, compared to the pure metals, will affect the chemistry that is observed."

The document provides a comprehensive overview of catalysts, particularly focusing on the historical development of catalysis and the role of metals in catalytic reactions. It highlights the significance of catalysts in various industries, including brewing and the production of methanol fuel cells. The text emphasizes the impact of adding a second metal to a catalyst's surface, which alters its electronic structure, allowing for the tuning of its properties to better suit specific reactions. Traditional catalysts, such as those based on platinum or palladium, tend to be highly reactive, often leading to complete hydrogenation of double bonds in target molecules. The document also mentions the distinction between ligand effects and ensemble effects, which are two primary ways a second metal can influence catalytic activity. Bimetallic catalysts offer distinct properties compared to pure metals, affecting the chemistry observed in reactions.

文档提供了催化剂的全面概述，特别关注催化作用的历史发展及其在酿酒等古老行业中的应用。它强调了催化剂在各种工业领域的关键作用，包括酿酒和甲醇燃料电池生产。文本强调了向催化剂表面添加第二种金属对催化剂电子结构的影响，这使得能够精确调整催化剂的性质以适应特定反应。传统的催化剂，如基于铂或钯的催化剂，往往高度活性，通常导致目标分子中所有双键的完全氢化。文档还提到了两种主要的效应——配体效应和集合效应，这是第二种金属影响催化活性的两种方式。双金属催化剂在与纯金属相比时表现出独特性质，影响观察到的化学反应。
