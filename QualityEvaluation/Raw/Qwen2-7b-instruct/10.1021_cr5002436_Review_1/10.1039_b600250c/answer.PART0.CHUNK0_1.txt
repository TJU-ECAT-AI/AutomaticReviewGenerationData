[1] "The adsorption energies for hydrogen in a series of sites on Pt and PtSn {111} surfaces have been calculated using periodic density functional theory."
[2] "The structural, electronic and vibrational data reflect the insensitivity of H adsorption to the adsorption site and tin doping."
[3] "On Pt {111} the maximum barrier to diffusion was calculated as 5 kJ mol21."
[4] "The lowest energy pathway on the tin doped surfaces gave a value over five times larger than this although many diffusion routes were significantly higher than this with the highest barrier calculated at almost 100 kJ mol21."

The study focused on calculating adsorption energies for hydrogen on Pt and PtSn {111} surfaces using density functional theory. The data showed that adsorption energies were insensitive to the specific adsorption site on Pt surfaces. When tin was doped into the surface, adsorption energies decreased slightly. On Pt surfaces, the maximum barrier to hydrogen diffusion was 5 kJ mol21. In contrast, on tin-doped surfaces, the highest diffusion barrier reached nearly 100 kJ mol21, significantly hindering hydrogen mobility.

研究使用密度泛函理论计算了氢在Pt和PtSn {111}表面的吸附能。数据显示，Pt表面不同吸附位点对吸附能影响不大。当锡掺杂到表面时，吸附能略有降低。在纯Pt表面上，氢扩散的最大能垒为5 kJ mol21。相比之下，在锡掺杂表面，最高的扩散能垒达到近100 kJ mol21，极大地阻碍了氢的流动性。
