[1] "Introduction Although catalysts have been used since the middle ages in ancient industries such as brewing, it was not until 1836 that the definition of catalysis as a substance that facilitates a reaction was introduced by Berzelius."
[2] "There are two main ways the addition of a second element affects catalysis. These are termed (1) ligand effects and (2) ensemble effects."
[3] "Traditionally platinum or palladium based catalysts have been used but these are rather aggressive catalysts usually leading to complete hydrogenation of every double bond in the target molecule."
[4] "Another major application is in direct oxidation in methanol fuel cells."
[5] "The addition of a second metal to a surface will produce large perturbations in the electronic structure of that surface giving scope to fine tune the catalysts properties for the target reaction."

The document provides a comprehensive overview of catalysts, particularly focusing on the historical development of catalysis and the role of metals in catalytic reactions. It highlights the significance of catalysts in various industries, including brewing and the production of methanol fuel cells. The text emphasizes the impact of adding a second metal to a catalyst's surface, which alters its electronic structure, allowing for the tuning of its properties to better suit specific reactions. Traditional catalysts, such as those based on platinum or palladium, tend to be highly reactive, often leading to complete hydrogenation of double bonds in target molecules. The document also mentions the distinction between ligand effects and ensemble effects, which are two primary ways a second metal can influence catalytic activity. Bimetallic catalysts offer distinct properties compared to pure metals, affecting the chemistry observed in reactions.

[1] "The adsorption energies for hydrogen in a series of sites on Pt and PtSn {111} surfaces have been calculated using periodic density functional theory."
[2] "The structural, electronic and vibrational data reflect the insensitivity of H adsorption to the adsorption site and tin doping."
[3] "On Pt {111} the maximum barrier to diffusion was calculated as 5 kJ mol21."
[4] "The lowest energy pathway on the tin doped surfaces gave a value over five times larger than this although many diffusion routes were significantly higher than this with the highest barrier calculated at almost 100 kJ mol21."

The study focused on calculating adsorption energies for hydrogen on Pt and PtSn {111} surfaces using density functional theory. The data showed that adsorption energies were insensitive to the specific adsorption site on Pt surfaces. When tin was doped into the surface, adsorption energies decreased slightly. On Pt surfaces, the maximum barrier to hydrogen diffusion was 5 kJ mol21. In contrast, on tin-doped surfaces, the highest diffusion barrier reached nearly 100 kJ mol21, significantly hindering hydrogen mobility.

研究使用密度泛函理论计算了氢在Pt和PtSn {111}表面的吸附能。数据显示，Pt表面不同吸附位点对吸附能影响不大。当锡掺杂到表面时，吸附能略有降低。在纯Pt表面上，氢扩散的最大能垒为5 kJ mol21。相比之下，在锡掺杂表面，最高的扩散能垒达到近100 kJ mol21，极大地阻碍了氢的流动性。

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the former are characterized by their high reactivity and stability under harsh conditions, making them highly effective in industrial applications such as the production of ethylene and propylene from naphtha. These catalysts typically require specialized design for recent developments aimed at enhancing selectivity, efficiency, and durability. On the other hand, metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides offer cost-effectiveness and better tolerance to impurities, making them a viable alternative in various industrial processes. The effectiveness of both types of catalysts varies based on the specific chemical reactions and conditions they are subjected to.

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, in various industrial applications, including nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts are traditionally used due to their effectiveness in hydrogenation reactions, often leading to complete hydrogenation of double bonds in target molecules. However, bimetallic catalysts, which combine two metals, offer improved activity, selectivity, and longer lifetimes compared to their pure counterparts. An example of a bimetallic catalyst is tin-doped platinum, which is used in reforming and cracking processes in the petroleum industry. These catalysts have longer lifetimes and do not require pre-sulfurisation, offering advantages over pure platinum catalysts.

In hydrogenation reactions, the dissociation of hydrogen molecules on metal surfaces plays a crucial role. Transition metal surfaces typically facilitate this dissociation, except for copper, gold, and silver. Bimetallic catalysts, such as those containing tin and platinum, can exhibit enhanced selectivity due to the electronic structure changes caused by the presence of the second metal. The document also mentions the use of computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) to study the properties of these catalysts, including their electronic structure, vibrational frequencies, and barriers to diffusion.

Regarding metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, the document does not provide a direct comparison. However, these catalysts are known for their use in various industrial processes, including catalytic cracking and oxidation reactions. Metal oxides can have distinct properties compared to noble metals, potentially affecting their reactivity and selectivity in different chemical reactions. The specific compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins are not detailed in the provided excerpt.

To summarize, the document focuses on the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum and its bimetallic variants, in industrial applications such as nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the benefits of bimetallic catalysts over pure noble metals in terms of activity, selectivity, and lifetime. The document also mentions the computational methods used to study the properties of these catalysts, including their electronic structure, vibrational frequencies, and diffusion barriers. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation.

文档讨论了在各种工业应用中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂催化剂。传统上，由于其在氢化反应中的有效性，铂基催化剂被用于氢化反应，通常导致目标分子中每个双键的完全氢化。然而，二元催化剂，即两种金属的组合，相较于其纯金属表现出改善的活性、选择性和寿命。一个例子是掺杂锡的铂催化剂，它用于石油工业中的重整和裂解过程。这些催化剂具有更长的寿命，并且不需要预硫化，相对于纯铂催化剂提供优势。

在氢化反应中，氢分子在金属表面的离解起着关键作用。除铜、金和银外，过渡金属表面通常促进这一离解。含锡和铂的二元催化剂由于第二金属的存在而显示出电子结构变化，从而表现出增强的选择性。文档还提到了使用密度泛函理论（DFT）等计算方法来研究这些催化剂的性质，包括它们的电子结构、振动频率和扩散障碍。

至于氧化物基催化剂，如铬氧化物、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，文档没有直接进行比较。然而，这些氧化物催化剂在各种工业过程中已知被使用，包括催化裂化和氧化反应。与贵金属相比，氧化物催化剂可能在不同化学反应中展现出独特的性质，影响其反应性和选择性。文档没有详细说明非氧化性轻烯烃脱氢过程中的金属氧化物催化剂的特定组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展及其在该领域的潜在优势。

简而言之，文档侧重于在工业应用中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂及其二元变体，在非氧化性轻烯烃脱氢过程中。它强调了与纯贵金属相比，二元催化剂在活性、选择性和寿命方面的优势。文档还提到了使用计算方法来研究这些催化剂的性质，包括它们的电子结构、振动频率和扩散障碍。然而，它没有提供关于金属氧化物催化剂的全面比较，尤其是在非氧化性轻烯烃脱氢过程中的背景下。

The document discusses noble metal-based catalysts, particularly focusing on platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It mentions that platinum-based catalysts, while effective, tend to completely hydrogenate every double bond in the target molecule, leading to aggressive reactions. Adding a second metal, such as ruthenium, iron, or tin, can change product distributions and improve catalytic selectivity and lifetime. The document explains that tin doping can raise the barrier to dissociation, weakening the TMH bond, and introduces the concepts of ligand effects and ensemble effects. The text also notes that bimetallic surfaces experience altered dissociation due to the presence of the second metal, potentially affecting the reaction pathways. Furthermore, it suggests that tin doping significantly impairs hydrogen mobility on surfaces, impacting catalytic activity and kinetics.

文档讨论了用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂，特别是铂基催化剂，以及金属氧化物催化剂。它提到，基于铂的催化剂在反应中表现得非常积极，往往会完全氢化目标分子中的每个双键，导致剧烈的反应。添加第二种金属，如钌、铁或锡，可以改变产物分布并提高催化选择性和寿命。文档解释说，锡掺杂会提高脱解离的障碍，并减弱TMH键，引入了配体效应和簇效应的概念。文本还指出，由于第二金属的存在，二元金属表面的脱解离会发生变化，可能影响反应途径。此外，文档表明锡掺杂严重阻碍了表面上的氢移动性，影响了催化活性和动力学。
