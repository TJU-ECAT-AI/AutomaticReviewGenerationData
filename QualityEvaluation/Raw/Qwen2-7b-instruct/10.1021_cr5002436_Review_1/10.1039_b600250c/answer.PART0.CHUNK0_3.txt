[1] "Although catalysts have been used since the middle ages in ancient industries such as brewing, it was not until 1836 that the definition of catalysis as a substance that facilitates a reaction was introduced by Berzelius."
[2] "It became clear that, quite apart from the effect on reaction rates, different catalytic substances could lead to different products giving the first indication that catalysts could be used to selectively produce a desired product while minimising the amount of undesired by-products."
[3] "Bimetallic catalysts often have improved activity, selectivity and/or lifetimes compared to their pure counterparts."
[4] "Traditionally platinum or palladium based catalysts have been used but these are rather aggressive catalysts usually leading to complete hydrogenation of every double bond in the target molecule."
[5] "Another major application is in direct oxidation in methanol fuel cells."
[6] "In addition, where dissociation occurs the TMH bond is weaker than on the pure transition metal surface."
[7] "The addition of a second metal to a surface will produce large perturbations in the electronic structure of that surface giving scope to fine tune the catalysts properties for the target reaction."
[8] "Hydrogen has been extensively studied on transition metal surfaces; see for example references 3,4."
[9] "With very few exceptions hydrogen is found to adsorb in a hollow site on the {111} surfaces."
[10] "Dissociative adsorption of H2 on metal surfaces is a very important step in hydrogenation reactions."
[11] "In general H2 dissociation is easy on transition metal (TM) surfaces with the exception of Cu, Au and Ag."
[12] "A distinction is sometimes drawn between alloying with another TM and a main group metal but hydrogenation on PtFex produces very similar results to PtSnx suggesting that any element which is more electropositive may enhance the selectivity."
[13] "The different properties of bimetallic catalysts, compared to the pure metals, will affect the chemistry that is observed."
[14] "Tin doped platinum catalysts are used for reforming and cracking in the petroleum industry as their lifetimes far exceed those of pure platinum catalysts."
[15] "They also have the advantage of not requiring pre-sulfurisation."
[16] "Such tin doped surface alloys have been studied in detail by Overbury and Ku."
[17] "The calculations have been performed using periodic density functional theory (DFT), as implemented in the code VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Program."
[18] "The phase combinations of the orbitals within adjacent unit cells (the extended electronic states) were represented by the introduction of phase factors into the wavefunctions at a series of k-points in reciprocal space."
[19] "To calculate the vibrational frequencies the harmonic approximation is used, whereby the normal mode vibrational frequencies were calculated by diagonalisation of the mass- weighted second derivative matrix."
[20] "Structure of Pt {111} and PtSn {111} The calculated lattice constant for platinum, 3.958 A , is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 3.924 A ."
[21] "The {111} surface is close packed for the fcc metals so very little relaxation is expected for the Pt {111} surface."
[22] "Platinum and tin form two ordered surface alloys as shown in Fig. 1."
[23] "When the surfaces are fully relaxed the tin sticks 0.285 A out of the surface for the (2 6 2) surface and 0.226 A for the (!3 6 !3R30u) surface."
[24] "The activation energies for each of the various hops are shown in Fig. 8 for each surface."
[25] "On the tin doped surfaces however the barrier to diffusion is much higher."
[26] "The pathways close to tin are significantly distorted away from tin as shown in Fig. 7(bc)."
[27] "The much higher barrier to diffusion on the tin doped surfaces means that hydrogen will be a lot less mobile on these surfaces."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, in various industrial applications, including nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts are traditionally used due to their effectiveness in hydrogenation reactions, often leading to complete hydrogenation of double bonds in target molecules. However, bimetallic catalysts, which combine two metals, offer improved activity, selectivity, and longer lifetimes compared to their pure counterparts. An example of a bimetallic catalyst is tin-doped platinum, which is used in reforming and cracking processes in the petroleum industry. These catalysts have longer lifetimes and do not require pre-sulfurisation, offering advantages over pure platinum catalysts.

In hydrogenation reactions, the dissociation of hydrogen molecules on metal surfaces plays a crucial role. Transition metal surfaces typically facilitate this dissociation, except for copper, gold, and silver. Bimetallic catalysts, such as those containing tin and platinum, can exhibit enhanced selectivity due to the electronic structure changes caused by the presence of the second metal. The document also mentions the use of computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) to study the properties of these catalysts, including their electronic structure, vibrational frequencies, and barriers to diffusion.

Regarding metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, the document does not provide a direct comparison. However, these catalysts are known for their use in various industrial processes, including catalytic cracking and oxidation reactions. Metal oxides can have distinct properties compared to noble metals, potentially affecting their reactivity and selectivity in different chemical reactions. The specific compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins are not detailed in the provided excerpt.

To summarize, the document focuses on the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum and its bimetallic variants, in industrial applications such as nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the benefits of bimetallic catalysts over pure noble metals in terms of activity, selectivity, and lifetime. The document also mentions the computational methods used to study the properties of these catalysts, including their electronic structure, vibrational frequencies, and diffusion barriers. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation.

文档讨论了在各种工业应用中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂催化剂。传统上，由于其在氢化反应中的有效性，铂基催化剂被用于氢化反应，通常导致目标分子中每个双键的完全氢化。然而，二元催化剂，即两种金属的组合，相较于其纯金属表现出改善的活性、选择性和寿命。一个例子是掺杂锡的铂催化剂，它用于石油工业中的重整和裂解过程。这些催化剂具有更长的寿命，并且不需要预硫化，相对于纯铂催化剂提供优势。

在氢化反应中，氢分子在金属表面的离解起着关键作用。除铜、金和银外，过渡金属表面通常促进这一离解。含锡和铂的二元催化剂由于第二金属的存在而显示出电子结构变化，从而表现出增强的选择性。文档还提到了使用密度泛函理论（DFT）等计算方法来研究这些催化剂的性质，包括它们的电子结构、振动频率和扩散障碍。

至于氧化物基催化剂，如铬氧化物、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，文档没有直接进行比较。然而，这些氧化物催化剂在各种工业过程中已知被使用，包括催化裂化和氧化反应。与贵金属相比，氧化物催化剂可能在不同化学反应中展现出独特的性质，影响其反应性和选择性。文档没有详细说明非氧化性轻烯烃脱氢过程中的金属氧化物催化剂的特定组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展及其在该领域的潜在优势。

简而言之，文档侧重于在工业应用中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂及其二元变体，在非氧化性轻烯烃脱氢过程中。它强调了与纯贵金属相比，二元催化剂在活性、选择性和寿命方面的优势。文档还提到了使用计算方法来研究这些催化剂的性质，包括它们的电子结构、振动频率和扩散障碍。然而，它没有提供关于金属氧化物催化剂的全面比较，尤其是在非氧化性轻烯烃脱氢过程中的背景下。
