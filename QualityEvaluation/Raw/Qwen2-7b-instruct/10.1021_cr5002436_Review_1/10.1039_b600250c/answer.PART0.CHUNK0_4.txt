[1] "Although catalysts have been used since the middle ages in ancient industries such as brewing, it was not until 1836 that the definition of catalysis as a substance that facilitates a reaction was introduced by Berzelius."
[2] "It became clear that, quite apart from the effect on reaction rates, different catalytic substances could lead to different products giving the first indication that catalysts could be used to selectively produce a desired product while minimising the amount of undesired by-products."
[3] "Traditionally platinum or palladium based catalysts have been used but these are rather aggressive catalysts usually leading to complete hydrogenation of every double bond in the target molecule."
[4] "It has been observed that the addition of a second metal such as ruthenium, iron or tin can change the product distributions."
[5] "Bimetallic catalysts often have improved activity, selectivity and/or lifetimes compared to their pure counterparts."
[6] "The addition of a second metal generally raises the barrier to dissociation. In addition, where dissociation occurs the TMH bond is weaker than on the pure transition metal surface."
[7] "There are two main ways the addition of a second element affects catalysis. These are termed (1) ligand effects and (2) ensemble effects."
[8] "Naturally the dissociation on a bimetallic surface will be affected by the presence of the second metal."
[9] "The diffusion calculations show significant differences in the mobility of hydrogen providing a possible explanation for the changes in catalytic action on tin doping of platinum."
[10] "The much higher barrier to diffusion on the tin doped surfaces means that hydrogen will be a lot less mobile on these surfaces."

The document discusses noble metal-based catalysts, particularly focusing on platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It mentions that platinum-based catalysts, while effective, tend to completely hydrogenate every double bond in the target molecule, leading to aggressive reactions. Adding a second metal, such as ruthenium, iron, or tin, can change product distributions and improve catalytic selectivity and lifetime. The document explains that tin doping can raise the barrier to dissociation, weakening the TMH bond, and introduces the concepts of ligand effects and ensemble effects. The text also notes that bimetallic surfaces experience altered dissociation due to the presence of the second metal, potentially affecting the reaction pathways. Furthermore, it suggests that tin doping significantly impairs hydrogen mobility on surfaces, impacting catalytic activity and kinetics.

文档讨论了用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂，特别是铂基催化剂，以及金属氧化物催化剂。它提到，基于铂的催化剂在反应中表现得非常积极，往往会完全氢化目标分子中的每个双键，导致剧烈的反应。添加第二种金属，如钌、铁或锡，可以改变产物分布并提高催化选择性和寿命。文档解释说，锡掺杂会提高脱解离的障碍，并减弱TMH键，引入了配体效应和簇效应的概念。文本还指出，由于第二金属的存在，二元金属表面的脱解离会发生变化，可能影响反应途径。此外，文档表明锡掺杂严重阻碍了表面上的氢移动性，影响了催化活性和动力学。
