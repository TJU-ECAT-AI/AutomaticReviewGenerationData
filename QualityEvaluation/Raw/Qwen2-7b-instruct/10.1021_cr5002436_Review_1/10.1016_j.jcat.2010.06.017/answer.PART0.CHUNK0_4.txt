The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Noble metals like Platinum are noted for their activity in alkane dehydrogenation, while metal oxides such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides have been applied in the dehydrogenation of light olefins. The compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent advancements, and potential benefits of these two types of catalysts warrant a comparative analysis.
