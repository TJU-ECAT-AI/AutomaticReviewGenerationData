[1] "A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes."
[2] "The modifying element, Ga, was introduced by transference from the support, a cal- cined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material."
[3] "Pt nanoparticles were dispersed onto the calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O starting from an organometallic precursor, followed by reduction."
[4] "After reduction at 773873 K, PtGa alloys were observed."
[5] "It is proposed that at high reduction temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of the metal particles spill over onto the support where they reduce Ga3+ cation to atomic Ga, which then interacts with the supported Pt to form PtGa alloys."

The literature describes a new method for preparing PtGa bimetallic particles on a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O support for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes. Gallium (Ga) is introduced from the support, a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material. Pt nanoparticles are dispersed onto the support from an organometallic precursor and then reduced. At high reduction temperatures, hydrogen atoms form on the surface of the metal particles, spill over onto the support, reduce Ga3+ cations to atomic Ga, which then interacts with the supported Pt to form PtGa alloys.

文献描述了一种新的方法，用于在煅烧的Mg(Ga)(Al)O支持上制备PtGa双金属颗粒，用于轻烷烃的脱氢生成轻烯烃。从支持物，一种煅烧的Mg(Ga)(Al)O层状双氢氧化物材料中引入镓（Ga）。从有机金属前体开始，将铂纳米颗粒分散到支持物上，然后进行还原。在高温还原后，观察到了PtGa合金的存在。在高温还原时，表面形成的氢原子溢出到支持物上，将Ga3+离子还原为原子Ga，然后与支持的Pt相互作用形成PtGa合金。

[1] "Noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins."
[2] "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation."
[3] "Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re."
[4] "The means by which the promoting element interacts with Pt and influences its catalytic properties are best understood for Sn."
[5] "Previous studies have shown that the formation of coke is minimized using non-acidic supports such as KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite."

Noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum acts as an effective catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes, though it experiences low selectivity for alkenes and rapid deactivation due to coke formation without modifiers. Adding elements like Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re can increase alkenes selectivity and reduce coke formation tendency. Studies demonstrate that coke formation is minimized with non-acidic supports like KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite.

贵金属催化剂（特别是铂），以及金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）被用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢反应。铂对于轻烷烃的脱氢反应表现出活性，但在缺乏修饰剂的情况下，它会因为快速焦炭形成而具有低烯烃选择性和活性降低的问题。通过添加Sn、Zn、Ge、Pb和Re等元素可以提高烯烃的选择性并减少焦炭生成的趋势。先前的研究表明，在KL沸石、碱改性的氧化铝、尖晶石和煅烧的层状双氢氧化物等非酸性支持物下，焦炭生成量最少。
