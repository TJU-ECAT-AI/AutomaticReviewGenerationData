This study reports a novel method for preparing PtGa bimetallic particles on a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O support. Ga3+ ions are predominantly octahedrally coordinated. As the Ga/(Ga + Al) ratio increases, the support's surface area diminishes, and the size of dispersed Pt particles grows. After reduction at 723 K, most platinum exists in Pt and PtOx particles with sizes from 1.4 to 2.2 nm. The particle size increased from 1.2 nm to 2.2 nm as the Ga/(Ga + Al) ratio rose from 0 to 1. At temperatures of 773-873 K during H2 reduction, some Ga3+ ions near the surface transform into Ga atoms thanks to H atoms from the Pt particles, resulting in PtGa alloys with Ga/Pt ratios from 0.1 to 1.1.

本研究报告了一种在煅烧的类水滑石型支持物Mg(Ga)(Al)O上制备PtGa双金属颗粒的新方法。Ga3+离子主要以八面体协调存在。随着Ga/(Ga + Al)比值的增加，支持物的表面积逐渐减小，分散的铂颗粒的尺寸增大。在723 K的还原后，大部分铂位于Pt和PtOx颗粒中，大小从1.4到2.2 nm。随着Ga/(Ga + Al)比值从0增加到1，颗粒大小从1.2 nm增加到2.2 nm。在773至873 K的H2还原过程中，靠近表面的一些Ga3+离子通过来自Pt颗粒的H原子转化为Ga原子，导致形成Ga/Pt比例从0.1到1.1的PtGa合金。
