[1] "A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes."
[2] "The modifying element, Ga, was introduced by transference from the support, a cal- cined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material."
[3] "The activity, selectivity and stability of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are described in the second part of this study."
[4] "A further attraction of hydrotalcite-derived supports is that they can be prepared with elements other than Al, e.g., Zn, Ga, In."
[5] "We have recently exploited this characteristic by preparing and evaluating a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[6] "The composition of the support used for Pt bimetallic catalysts influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself."
[7] "Previous studies have shown that the formation of coke is minimized using non-acidic supports such as KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite."
[8] "Mg(Al)O is particularly attractive because it is moderately basic and exhibits high thermal stability to steam and reaction-oxidation cycling."
[9] "The highest dehydrogenation activity was obtained with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.3, whereas 100% ethene selectivity was achieved for a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.4, with only a small loss in dehydrogenation activity."
[10] "The means by which the promoting element interacts with Pt and influences its catalytic properties are best understood for Sn."
[11] "The first of these effects increases the rate of alkene formation, whereas the latter reduces the loss of hydrogen from the readsorbed alkene, a process that leads to the formation of lower molecular weight products and coke."
[12] "To achieve intimate contact between the Sn precursor and the Pt particles, reduced Pt/Mg(Al)O was reacted with tetrabutyl tin and then reduced in H2."
[13] "The addition of Ga to the hydrotalcite-like precursor material caused a small decrease in the surface area of the calcined support as well as the pore volume."
[14] "As seen in spectrum B, increasing the Ga/Pt ratio to 12 had no detectable effect on the 71Ga NMR spectrum."
[15] "However, further increasing the Ga/Pt ratio to 96 (spec- trum C) resulted in the occurrence of additional peaks at 58.2 ppm and 201.1 ppm."
[16] "The local order of Ga atoms in Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O was probed by 71Ga NMR."
[17] "The dispersion of Pt particles on calcined hydrotalcite-like supports, determined by H2 chemisorption, is presented in Table 2."
[18] "The observed decrease in Pt dispersion with increasing Ga/Pt ratio is very likely due to the decrease in the concentration of Al cations at the surface of the support."
[19] "The sizes of these particles are consistent with the average particle size deduced from H2 chemisorption."
[20] "Analysis of the EXAFS pattern of as-prepared Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 5.4 gives PtPt (dPtPt = 2.77 Å) and PtO (dPtO = 2.05 Å) coordination numbers."
[21] "A similar analyses for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 12 gives a PtPt (dPtPt = 2.77 Å) and PtO (dPtO = 2.03 Å) coordination numbers."
[22] "Thus, EXAFS analysis suggests that after reduction at 723 K, platinum is present as a mixture of Pt and PtOx."
[23] "A good fit of the pattern could be obtained using EXAFS parameters for pure Pt and PtGa."
[24] "By this means, the PtPt coordination (dPtPt = 2.79 Å) was found to be 7.0  0.5 and the PtGa coordination (dPtGa = 2.53 Å) was found to be 1.2  0.6."
[25] "An even larger change in the EXAFS pattern was ob- served when as-prepared Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 was reduced in H2 at 873 K."
[26] "In this case, the PtPt coordination (dPt Pt = 2.75 Å) was found to be 5.2  1.0 and the PtGa coordination (dPtGa = 2.58 Å) was found to be 3.6  2.4."
[27] "The higher PtGa coordination number for the sample with Ga/Pt = 12 indicates that an increase in the reduction temperature leads to a greater degree of association of Ga with Pt."
[28] "Additional evidence for the formation of PtGa alloys was ob- tained from EDX analysis of the samples."
[29] "In areas of the support free of Pt particles, the Ga/Mg ratio measure after sample reduction at 723 K was for 1.37  0.23  102 for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and 2.28  0.5.1  102 for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 in good agreement with the bulk stoichiometric values of 1.39  102 and 2.65  102,respectively."
[30] "Figs. 11 and 12 show the distribution of Ga/Pt ratios for of the metal particles characterized by EDX after reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 at 723 K."
[31] "In this case, Figs. 11 and 12 show that the Ga/Pt ratio of the Pt particles rises to between 0.1 and 0.59 for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and between 0.1 and 1.09 for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12."
[32] "Thus, the average Ga/Pt ratio of the metal particles is larger, the larger the bulk value of Ga/Pt."

To compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the document presents a study focusing on Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts. The modifying element, gallium (Ga), was introduced by transferring from a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material. The study highlights the impact of the support's composition, specifically the presence of gallium and aluminum, on the dispersion and size of Pt particles. Ga was found to influence the stability of the metal particles, affecting their resistance to sintering and coke formation on the support. The activity, selectivity, and stability of the Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are discussed. The study proposes a mechanism for the migration of Ga atoms from the support surface to the Pt particles upon reduction, forming PtGa alloys. This contrasts with noble metal catalysts, which typically refer to metals like platinum (Pt), gold (Au), silver (Ag), and palladium (Pd) used in various industrial processes. Noble metals often offer high reactivity and selectivity but may suffer from stability issues, particularly in the presence of coke formation. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, generally exhibit different reactivity profiles and may require specific conditions for optimal performance. Recent developments in catalyst design aim to enhance stability, selectivity, and activity while minimizing coke formation. The document provides insights into the synthesis, characterization, and application of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts, offering a detailed understanding of the interaction between the noble metal Pt and the modifying element Ga on the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

为了比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂，本文研究了以Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂为例。改性元素镓（Ga）通过从煅烧的Mg(Ga)(Al)O水滑石型材料转移引入。研究表明，支持物的组成，特别是镓和铝的存在，对铂颗粒的分散和大小有影响。镓被发现会影响金属颗粒的稳定性，影响支持物上颗粒的粘连性和焦炭形成。对于轻烷烃脱氢，Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性进行了讨论。本文提出了在铂颗粒上还原时Ga原子从支持物表面迁移至形成PtGa合金的机制。这与通常指铂（Pt）、金（Au）、银（Ag）和钯（Pd）等贵金属催化剂有所不同。贵金属往往具有高反应性和选择性，但在存在焦炭形成时可能面临稳定性问题。金属氧化物催化剂通常具有不同的反应特性，并可能需要特定条件才能达到最佳性能。催化剂设计的近期发展旨在提高稳定性和选择性，同时减少焦炭形成。本文提供了合成、表征和应用Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂的详细见解，为脱氢反应中铂（Pt）与改性元素Ga之间的相互作用提供深入理解。
