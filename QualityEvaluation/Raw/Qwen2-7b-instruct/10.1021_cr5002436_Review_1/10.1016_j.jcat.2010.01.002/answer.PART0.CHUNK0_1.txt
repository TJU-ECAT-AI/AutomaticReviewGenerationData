[1] "Catalytic reforming is an important reaction used for the pro- duction of aromatics from paraffins."
[2] "The production of benzene is important, as it is a feedstock for many industrial applications in the production of drugs, plastics, synthetic rubber, and dyes."
[3] "Commercially, Pt supported on chlorinated alumina containing other metallic components, such as Re [13], Sn [46], Ir [4,7,8], and/or Ge [9,10], is the catalyst commonly used for catalytic reforming."
[4] "Despite the different hypotheses to explain the excellent catalytic performance of the Pt/KL, it is clear that the L-zeolite plays a signif- icant role in enhancing both the activity and selectivity of Pt for hexane dehydrocyclization."
[5] "The majority of the small Pt particles are located inside the channels of the KL zeolite [28 30]."
[6] "Under the actual catalytic conditions of hexane dehydrocyclization, the hexane molecules likely diffuse to the Pt active sites by Knudsen diffusion (i.e., whereby molecules frequently collide with the pore wall) prior to catalytic reaction."
[7] "It is therefore possible that the entry of the hexane molecules into the channels and intracrystalline diffusion of hexane play signifi- cant roles in determining the selectivity of the dehydrocyclization reaction."
[8] "The majority of Pt clusters are ultra-tiny and well-dispersed within the channels of L-zeolite when the catalyst was prepared using the CVD method."
[9] "There is hardly any kinetic isotope effect for the conversion of an equimolar mixture of C6H14 and C6D14 on 1%Pt/KL catalyst at 500 C and 1 atm, indicating that the dehydrocyclization reaction of hexane over Pt/KL is controlled by hexane entry into the wider lobes of the L-zeolite channels where the Pt clusters reside."
[10] "This controlled diffusion of hexane inside the channels seems to be the reason for the high stability and selectivity of the catalyst, most likely because it inhibits the bimolecular reactions that lead to coke for- mation and catalyst deactivation, in agreement with the earlier hypothesis of Iglesia."

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are often composed of metals like Platinum supported on various supports, including chlorinated alumina, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. They are effective in converting paraffins into aromatics, with a notable focus on the production of benzene, which is crucial for the manufacturing of various industrial products such as drugs, plastics, synthetic rubber, and dyes. Platinum, in particular, has shown exceptional performance when supported on zeolites like L-zeolite, especially in hexane dehydrocyclization processes. The L-zeolite plays a critical role in enhancing both the activity and selectivity of Platinum catalysts. The majority of small Platinum particles are found within the channels of the L-zeolite, suggesting that the entry of hexane molecules into these channels and subsequent intracrystalline diffusion significantly influence the selectivity of the dehydrocyclization reaction. Moreover, the literature indicates that the controlled diffusion of hexane molecules inside the L-zeolite channels, facilitated by the narrow windows, contributes to the catalyst's high stability and selectivity, as it inhibits bimolecular reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

文献讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂。这些催化剂通常由铂、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼等金属组成，支持在氯化铝、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物上。它们在将石蜡转化为芳香族化合物中非常有效，特别是在苯的生产中，苯是药物、塑料、合成橡胶和染料制造的关键原料。铂，特别是当它被支持在L-沸石上时，在己烷脱氢环化过程中显示出卓越的性能。L-沸石在提高铂催化剂的活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。大多数小铂颗粒位于L-沸石的通道内，表明己烷分子进入这些通道并随后在晶体内扩散显著影响脱氢环化反应的选择性。此外，文献表明，由于窄窗口的存在，L-沸石通道内己烷分子的可控扩散有助于催化剂的高稳定性和选择性，因为它抑制了导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活的双分子反应。
