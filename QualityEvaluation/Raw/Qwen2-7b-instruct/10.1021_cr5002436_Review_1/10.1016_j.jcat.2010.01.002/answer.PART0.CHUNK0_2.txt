[1] "Commercially, Pt supported on chlorinated alumina containing other metallic components, such as Re [13], Sn [46], Ir [4,7,8], and/or Ge [9,10], is the catalyst commonly used for catalytic reforming."
[2] "These catalysts are efficient in transforming C7 and higher paraffins to aromatics; however, over these catalysts, the transformation of hexane to benzene proceeds with much lower selectivity [11]."
[3] "In 1980, Bernard [12] reported the exceptional activity and selectivity of the non-acidic Pt/KL zeolite catalyst for the aromatisation of hexane to benzene."
[4] "It is proposed that controlling the entry of hexane into the lobes of the L-zeolite containing the active sites is the reason for the exceptional Pt/KL catalytic performance for aromatization because the narrow windows of the L-zeolite channels inhibit the occurrence of bimolecular reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[5] "The L-zeolite is reported to have uni-axial pores with a narrow 0.7-nm aperture leading to cavities of about 1.1 nm in diameter [52], and the average diameter of hexane molecule is about 0.454 nm [53]."
[6] "Comparing the diameter of the aperture of pores and the diameter of hexane molecules, one can expect that hexane enters and diffuses on a single-file basis (i.e., one-by-one)."
[7] "The observed results in this study, including the lack of NKIE at 500 C when using an equimolar of C6H14 and C6D14 over Pt/ KL CVD catalyst, the enhanced catalyst stability relative to other preparation methods, and the excellent dehydrocyclization activity and selectivity to benzene are consistent with the hypothesis of Iglesia et al. [19,20] that an important role of L-zeolite is to help maintain the Pt particles inside the channels clean by preventing bimolecular reaction pathways from occurring [19,20]."
[8] "We propose based on the kinetic isotopic effect study that the dehydrocyclization reaction over Pt/KL catalyst is controlled by the entry of hexane molecules into the wider lobes of the L-zeolite where the Pt0 active sites reside."
[9] "In contrast with non-microporous-supported Pt catalysts, the tiny windows of the L-zeolite channels allow hexane to pass through one-by-one to the larger lobes containing the Pt clusters."
[10] "This controlled diffusion of hexane inside the channels seems to be the reason for the high stability and selectivity of the catalyst, most likely because it inhibits the bimolecular reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation, in agreement with the earlier hypothesis of Iglesia."

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts, often supported on chlorinated alumina or containing other metals like Re, Sn, Ir, and Ge, are commonly used for catalytic reforming. Platinum on zeolite L (Pt/KL) stands out for its exceptional activity and selectivity in hexane aromatization to benzene. The narrow windows of the L-zeolite channels control the entry of hexane molecules, inhibiting bimolecular reactions that cause coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The hexane molecules enter and diffuse on a single-file basis through these narrow channels, leading to enhanced stability and selectivity of the Pt/KL catalyst. The literature supports the hypothesis that the L-zeolite helps maintain the Pt particles inside the channels clean, preventing bimolecular reactions, which aligns with the high performance of Pt/KL catalysts in hexane dehydrocyclization.

文献讨论了贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。这些催化剂，通常以氯化铝为载体或含有其他金属如铼、锡、铱和锗，广泛用于催化重整。铂在L沸石上的活性和选择性尤其出色，能够高效地将己烷转化为苯。L沸石的狭窄通道控制着己烷分子的进入，阻止了导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活的二分子反应。己烷分子通过这些狭窄的通道以单分子流的方式进入，导致铂/ L催化剂表现出高度的稳定性与选择性。文献支持这样一个假设：L沸石有助于保持铂颗粒在通道内部清洁，防止二分子反应，这与铂/ L催化剂在己烷脱氢化方面的高表现相一致。
