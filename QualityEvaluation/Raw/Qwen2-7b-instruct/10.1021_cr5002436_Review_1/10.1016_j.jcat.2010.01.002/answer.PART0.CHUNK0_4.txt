[1] "Commercially, Pt supported on chlorinated alumina containing other metallic components, such as Re [13], Sn [46], Ir [4,7,8], and/or Ge [9,10], is the catalyst commonly used for catalytic reforming."
[2] "Despite the different hypotheses to explain the excellent catalytic performance of the Pt/KL, it is clear that the L-zeolite plays a significant role in enhancing both the activity and selectivity of Pt for hexane dehydrocyclization; however, the reason for this enhancement is still not completely understood."
[3] "The aim of this research is to determine if a NKIE exists when conducting the experiment using an equal molar ratio of hexane-d14 and hexane-d0 as the feed."
[4] "The amount of hydrogen evolved from the 1%Pt/KL CVD catalyst during TPD was 51.2 and 50.5 lmol/g, respectively, for the two reduction temperatures of 450 C and 500 C employed."
[5] "The results indicate that there is hardly any NKIE detected for the conversion of an equimolar mixture of C6H14 and C6D14 on the tested catalyst (1%Pt/KL)."
[6] "The observed results in this study, including the lack of NKIE at 500 C when using an equimolar of C6H14 and C6D14 over Pt/ KL CVD catalyst, the enhanced catalyst stability relative to other preparation methods, and the excellent dehydrocyclization activity and selectivity to benzene are consistent with the hypothesis of Iglesia et al. [19,20] that an important role of L-zeolite is to help maintain the Pt particles inside the channels clean by preventing bimolecular reaction pathways from occurring."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are commonly used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins along with metal oxide-based catalysts such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Platinum-based catalysts are often supported on chlorinated alumina with additional metallic components like Re, Sn, Ir, and Ge. The L-zeolite catalyst shows significant enhancement in both activity and selectivity for hexane dehydrocyclization, although the exact reason for this improvement is not fully understood.

2. Platinum is the noble metal catalyst commonly used in catalytic reforming processes. Metal oxides like chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides can also be utilized in similar applications.

3. The study aimed to determine if a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) exists when hexane-d14 and hexane-d0 are used as a feed mixture.

4. The TPD analysis showed that the Pt/KL CVD catalyst released 51.2 and 50.5 μmol/g of hydrogen during reduction at 450°C and 500°C, respectively.

5. The experimental results did not detect a KIE when converting an equimolar mixture of C6H14 and C6D14 over the Pt/KL catalyst at 500°C.

6. The study's findings, including the lack of KIE, enhanced catalyst stability compared to other preparation methods, and excellent benzene selectivity, align with the hypothesis that L-zeolite helps maintain Pt particles inside the channels clean by preventing bimolecular reaction pathways.

1. 铂基贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，通常用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢反应，与铬氧化物（CrOx）、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂一起使用。铂基催化剂常被支持在氯化铝上，并且可能包含额外的金属成分如铼、锡、铱和锗。L-沸石催化剂显示出显著提高的活性和选择性，对于己烷脱氢环化，尽管这种改进的具体原因尚不完全清楚。

2. 铂是催化重整过程常用的贵金属催化剂。铬氧化物、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物也可以在类似应用中使用。

3. 研究旨在确定当使用十六烷-d14和十六烷-d0作为混合物作为进料时是否存在同位素效应（KIE）。

4. TPD分析显示，通过450°C和500°C的还原，Pt/KL CVD催化剂分别释放出51.2和50.5 μmol/g的氢气。

5. 当在500°C下使用Pt/KL催化剂转换等摩尔混合的C6H14和C6D14时，实验结果没有检测到KIE。

6. 研究发现，包括缺乏KIE、与其他制备方法相比增强的催化剂稳定性以及出色的苯选择性，都与L-沸石帮助维持铂颗粒在通道内清洁，防止二分子反应途径的观点一致，从而保持催化剂活性。
