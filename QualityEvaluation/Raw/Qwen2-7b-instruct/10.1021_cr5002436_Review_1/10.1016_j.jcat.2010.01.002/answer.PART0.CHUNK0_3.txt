[1] "Catalytic reforming is an important reaction used for the pro- duction of aromatics from paraffins."
[2] "The production of benzene is important, as it is a feedstock for many industrial applications in the production of drugs, plastics, synthetic rubber, and dyes."
[3] "Commercially, Pt supported on chlorinated alumina containing other metallic components, such as Re [13], Sn [46], Ir [4,7,8], and/or Ge [9,10], is the catalyst commonly used for catalytic reforming."
[4] "These catalysts are efficient in transforming C7 and higher paraffins to aromatics; however, over these catalysts, the transformation of hexane to benzene proceeds with much lower selectivity [11]."
[5] "In 1980, Bernard [12] reported the exceptional activity and selectivity of the non-acidic Pt/KL zeolite catalyst for the aromati- zation of hexane to benzene."
[6] "Despite the different hypotheses to explain the excellent catalytic performance of the Pt/KL, it is clear that the L-zeolite plays a signif- icant role in enhancing both the activity and selectivity of Pt for hexane dehydrocyclization; however, the reason for this enhance- ment is still not completely understood."
[7] "Over the tested period (5.5 h), the catalyst showed good stability with average conversion of 41% and 34% for C6H14 and C6D14, respectively, and an average calculated NKIE (kH/kD) of 1.2  0.1."
[8] "Surprisingly, HD exchange at 450 C occurred to a greater ex- tent than at 300 C, and the HD exchange in the unreacted hexane at 300 C is far from equilibrium."
[9] "The lack of a NKIE at 500 C (see Table 2) reveals that the chan- nels of the L-zeolite play a significant role in controlling the entry of hexane molecules to the active surface sites."
[10] "Moreover, the L-zeolite is reported to have uni-axial pores with a narrow 0.7-nm aperture leading to cavities of about 1.1 nm in diameter [52], and the average diameter of hexane molecule is about 0.454 nm [53]."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the Platinum-based catalysts, particularly when supported on zeolites like Pt/KL, have demonstrated exceptional activity and selectivity. Platinum supports, especially when prepared through chemical vapor deposition (CVD), offer the advantage of highly dispersed metal particles within the zeolite framework. This dispersion facilitates controlled diffusion of reactants into the zeolite channels, which are characterized by narrow apertures and uni-axial pores. The narrow apertures allow reactants like hexane to pass through one-by-one, which significantly influences the reaction pathways and prevents bimolecular reactions that can lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation. This mechanism is in stark contrast to non-microporous catalysts, where irreversible reactant adsorption often dictates the rate-determining step, hindering dehydrogenation efficiency.

The Pt/KL catalysts, due to their unique structure and dispersion of Pt clusters within the zeolite framework, enable a more controlled and selective dehydrocyclization of hexane to benzene, with minimal kinetic isotope effects. This indicates that the reaction is governed by the controlled entry of hexane into the wider lobes of the L-zeolite channels, where the active Pt sites are located. The enhanced stability and selectivity of the Pt/KL catalysts are thus attributed to their ability to maintain the Pt particles inside the channels clean, thereby preventing bimolecular reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

In summary, noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum supported on zeolites, exhibit superior activity, selectivity, and stability in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their unique structural features and the controlled diffusion mechanisms facilitated within the zeolite framework. Recent developments in catalyst preparation techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, have further enhanced the dispersion and reactivity of noble metals, making them more effective in industrial applications for the production of aromatic compounds.

Potential advantages of Platinum-based catalysts in the field include improved efficiency, selectivity, and stability in the production of aromatic compounds from light olefins. These catalysts offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional oxidation-based processes, reducing the overall energy consumption and pollution associated with chemical synthesis. Additionally, the precise control over the catalyst's structure and composition through advanced preparation methods enables optimization for specific reaction conditions, potentially leading to further advancements in catalytic technology.

在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的背景下，将贵金属催化剂如铂与金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）进行比较，铂基催化剂，尤其是当它们被支撑在如Pt/KL的沸石上时，显示出惊人的活性和选择性。铂支持，特别是通过化学气相沉积（CVD）制备的，提供了在沸石框架内分散金属粒子的优势。这种分散促进了反应物在沸石通道内的受控扩散，这些通道具有狭窄的开口和单轴孔径。狭窄的开口允许如己烷这样的反应物一个接一个地通过，这显著影响了反应途径，并阻止了可能导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活的二分子反应。

由于其独特的结构和铂簇在沸石框架内的分散，Pt/KL催化剂能够实现更受控和选择性的己烷脱氢环化为苯，且几乎没有动力学同位素效应。这表明反应由控制进入更宽的L-沸石通道的己烷决定，其中活性Pt位点位于其中。因此，Pt/KL催化剂的增强稳定性和选择性归因于它们能够保持铂颗粒在通道内清洁，从而防止导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活的二分子反应。

简而言之，贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂基沸石催化剂，在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中表现出优越的活性、选择性和稳定性，这得益于它们独特的结构特征以及在沸石框架内实现的受控扩散机制。最近的催化剂制备技术发展进一步提高了贵金属的分散性和活性，使它们成为工业生产芳香化合物的更有效替代方案。

铂基催化剂的优势可能包括提高效率、选择性和稳定性，以生产轻烯烃中的芳香化合物。这些催化剂提供了一种更环保的选择，减少了传统氧化工艺相关的能源消耗和污染。此外，通过高级制备方法精确控制催化剂的结构和组成，可以优化特定反应条件，从而有可能进一步推动催化技术的发展。
