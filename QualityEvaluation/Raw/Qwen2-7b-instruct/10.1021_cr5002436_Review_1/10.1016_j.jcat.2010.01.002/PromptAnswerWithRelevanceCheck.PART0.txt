[7] "It is therefore possible that the entry of the hexane molecules into the channels and intracrystalline diffusion of hexane play signifi- cant roles in determining the selectivity of the dehydrocyclization reaction."
[8] "The majority of Pt clusters are ultra-tiny and well-dispersed within the channels of L-zeolite when the catalyst was prepared using the CVD method."
[9] "There is hardly any kinetic isotope effect for the conversion of an equimolar mixture of C6H14 and C6D14 on 1%Pt/KL catalyst at 500 C and 1 atm, indicating that the dehydrocyclization reaction of hexane over Pt/KL is controlled by hexane entry into the wider lobes of the L-zeolite channels where the Pt clusters reside."
[10] "This controlled diffusion of hexane inside the channels seems to be the reason for the high stability and selectivity of the catalyst, most likely because it inhibits the bimolecular reactions that lead to coke for- mation and catalyst deactivation, in agreement with the earlier hypothesis of Iglesia."

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are often composed of metals like Platinum supported on various supports, including chlorinated alumina, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. They are effective in converting paraffins into aromatics, with a notable focus on the production of benzene, which is crucial for the manufacturing of various industrial products such as drugs, plastics, synthetic rubber, and dyes. Platinum, in particular, has shown exceptional performance when supported on zeolites like L-zeolite, especially in hexane dehydrocyclization processes. The L-zeolite plays a critical role in enhancing both the activity and selectivity of Platinum catalysts. The majority of small Platinum particles are found within the channels of the L-zeolite, suggesting that the entry of hexane molecules into these channels and subsequent intracrystalline diffusion significantly influence the selectivity of the dehydrocyclization reaction. Moreover, the literature indicates that the controlled diffusion of hexane molecules inside the L-zeolite channels, facilitated by the narrow windows, contributes to the catalyst's high stability and selectivity, as it inhibits bimolecular reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

文献讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂。这些催化剂通常由铂、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼等金属组成，支持在氯化铝、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物上。它们在将石蜡转化为芳香族化合物中非常有效，特别是在苯的生产中，苯是药物、塑料、合成橡胶和染料制造的关键原料。铂，特别是当它被支持在L-沸石上时，在己烷脱氢环化过程中显示出卓越的性能。L-沸石在提高铂催化剂的活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。大多数小铂颗粒位于L-沸石的通道内，表明己烷分子进入这些通道并随后在晶体内扩散显著影响脱氢环化反应的选择性。此外，文献表明，由于窄窗口的存在，L-沸石通道内己烷分子的可控扩散有助于催化剂的高稳定性和选择性，因为它抑制了导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活的双分子反应。

These catalysts, often supported on chlorinated alumina or containing other metals like Re, Sn, Ir, and Ge, are commonly used for catalytic reforming. Platinum on zeolite L (Pt/KL) stands out for its exceptional activity and selectivity in hexane aromatization to benzene. The narrow windows of the L-zeolite channels control the entry of hexane molecules, inhibiting bimolecular reactions that cause coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The hexane molecules enter and diffuse on a single-file basis through these narrow channels, leading to enhanced stability and selectivity of the Pt/KL catalyst.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the Platinum-based catalysts, particularly when supported on zeolites like Pt/KL, have demonstrated exceptional activity and selectivity. Platinum supports, especially when prepared through chemical vapor deposition (CVD), offer the advantage of highly dispersed metal particles within the zeolite framework. This dispersion facilitates controlled diffusion of reactants into the zeolite channels, which are characterized by narrow apertures and uni-axial pores. The narrow apertures allow reactants like hexane to pass through one-by-one, which significantly influences the reaction pathways and prevents bimolecular reactions that can lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation. This mechanism is in stark contrast to non-microporous catalysts, where irreversible reactant adsorption often dictates the rate-determining step, hindering dehydrogenation efficiency.

The Pt/KL catalysts, due to their unique structure and dispersion of Pt clusters within the zeolite framework, enable a more controlled and selective dehydrocyclization of hexane to benzene, with minimal kinetic isotope effects. This indicates that the reaction is governed by the controlled entry of hexane into the wider lobes of the L-zeolite channels, where the active Pt sites are located. The enhanced stability and selectivity of the Pt/KL catalysts are thus attributed to their ability to maintain the Pt particles inside the channels clean, thereby preventing bimolecular reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

In summary, noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum supported on zeolites, exhibit superior activity, selectivity, and stability in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their unique structural features and the controlled diffusion mechanisms facilitated within the zeolite framework. Recent developments in catalyst preparation techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, have further enhanced the dispersion and reactivity of noble metals, making them more effective in industrial applications for the production of aromatic compounds.

Potential advantages of Platinum-based catalysts in the field include improved efficiency, selectivity, and stability in the production of aromatic compounds from light olefins. These catalysts offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional oxidation-based processes, reducing the overall energy consumption and pollution associated with chemical synthesis. Additionally, the precise control over the catalyst's structure and composition through advanced preparation methods enables optimization for specific reaction conditions, potentially leading to further advancements in catalytic technology.

在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的背景下，将贵金属催化剂如铂与金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）进行比较，铂基催化剂，尤其是当它们被支撑在如Pt/KL的沸石上时，显示出惊人的活性和选择性。铂支持，特别是通过化学气相沉积（CVD）制备的，提供了在沸石框架内分散金属粒子的优势。这种分散促进了反应物在沸石通道内的受控扩散，这些通道具有狭窄的开口和单轴孔径。狭窄的开口允许如己烷这样的反应物一个接一个地通过，这显著影响了反应途径，并阻止了可能导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活的二分子反应。

由于其独特的结构和铂簇在沸石框架内的分散，Pt/KL催化剂能够实现更受控和选择性的己烷脱氢环化为苯，且几乎没有动力学同位素效应。这表明反应由控制进入更宽的L-沸石通道的己烷决定，其中活性Pt位点位于其中。因此，Pt/KL催化剂的增强稳定性和选择性归因于它们能够保持铂颗粒在通道内清洁，从而防止导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活的二分子反应。

简而言之，贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂基沸石催化剂，在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中表现出优越的活性、选择性和稳定性，这得益于它们独特的结构特征以及在沸石框架内实现的受控扩散机制。最近的催化剂制备技术发展进一步提高了贵金属的分散性和活性，使它们成为工业生产芳香化合物的更有效替代方案。

铂基催化剂的优势可能包括提高效率、选择性和稳定性，以生产轻烯烃中的芳香化合物。这些催化剂提供了一种更环保的选择，减少了传统氧化工艺相关的能源消耗和污染。此外，通过高级制备方法精确控制催化剂的结构和组成，可以优化特定反应条件，从而有可能进一步推动催化技术的发展。
