1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, which is crucial for the production of aromatics from paraffins. Several hypotheses have been put forth in the literature to explain the high activity and selectivity of the Pt/KL catalyst.

2. It's possible that the entry of hexane molecules into the channels and their intracrystalline diffusion significantly impact the selectivity of the dehydrocyclization reaction.

3. The total amount of hydrogen evolved from the 1%Pt/KL catalyst through Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) was 51.2 lmol/g at 450°C and 50.5 lmol/g at 500°C.

4. The DRIFTS spectra were fitted using a least squares fitting procedure with Gaussian peaks to analyze the data.

5. Surprisingly, HD exchange at 450°C was more extensive than at 300°C, and the exchange at 300°C was far from equilibrium.

6. The lack of a kinetic isotope effect at 500°C indicates that the L-zeolite's channels play a critical role in controlling the entry of hexane molecules to the active surface sites.

7. Over a 5.5-hour testing period, the selectivity of the catalyst towards benzene remained constant at around 70%.

1. 特别是铂金的贵金属催化剂被用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢，这是从烷烃生产芳香族化合物的重要反应。文献中提出了几个假说来解释Pt/KL催化剂的高活性和选择性。

2. 六元环烷烃分子进入通道以及它们在晶格内的扩散可能显著影响脱氢化反应的选择性。

3. 通过程序升温脱附（TPD）测得的1%Pt/KL催化剂总共释放出51.2 lmol/g的氢气在450°C时，50.5 lmol/g在500°C时。

4. 使用最小二乘拟合方法和高斯峰对DRIFTS光谱进行拟合以分析数据。

5. 令人惊讶的是，在450°C时HD交换比在300°C时更广泛，并且在300°C时的交换远未达到平衡状态。

6. 在500°C时没有检测到动力学同位素效应表明，L-沸石的通道在控制六元环烷烃分子进入活性表面位点方面起着关键作用。

7. 在5.5小时的测试期间，催化剂对苯的选择性保持在约70%不变。
