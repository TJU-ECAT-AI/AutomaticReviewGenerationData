[1] "The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, show high activity and selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins."
[2] "Metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides have been extensively studied for their potential in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Noble metal catalysts, especially Platinum, demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Metal oxides like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides have also been widely explored for their potential in this process.
