The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, are highly effective for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, showing high selectivity and activity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been utilized, although they generally exhibit lower stability and activity, especially under harsh conditions. Recent advancements in synthesis techniques have improved the performance of metal oxide catalysts. Industrial applications of these catalysts are widespread in petrochemical industries for producing ethylene and propylene. Noble metal-based catalysts offer higher efficiency and longer operational life, while metal oxide catalysts are cost-effective and use less toxic materials.
