[1] "In the field of fine chemicals, the preparation of unsaturated alcohols by the selective hydrogenation of the corresponding a,b-unsaturated aldehydes has a great industrial importance in the synthesis of many products."
[2] "However, metallic tin has been also detected by XPS in these systems [6,7]. This metallic tin would be able to form Pt-Sn alloy phases, and the dilution of platinum by tin would destroy the platinum ensembles, lowering the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen and chemisorb the a,b-unsaturated aldehyde through the olefinic bond, thus hindering the C C hydro- genation reaction rate."
[3] "An improvement in activity and selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol has been found with the use of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts [5]."
[4] "For a monometallic Pt/TiO2, the opposite behaviour was found [15]."
[5] "The effect of reduction at high temperature is a dramatic increase in catalytic activity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, and, in most cases, an increase in the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol."

The literature focuses on the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, specifically Titanium Oxide (TiO2), in the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Platinum and tin (Sn) are used together in bimetallic systems to enhance the selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, yielding the unsaturated alcohol as the desired product. The presence of tin stabilizes the selectivity towards the desired product, but there is an optimal amount beyond which the selectivity decreases. High reduction temperatures lead to a dramatic increase in catalytic activity and an increase in the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol, correlating with the formation of Pt-Sn alloy phases and the decoration of metal particles by partially reduced titania. The opposite behavior is observed with monometallic Platinum catalysts.

文献主要关注在选择性氢化丙酮醛中使用贵金属基催化剂，尤其是铂金，并且关注金属氧化物催化剂，特别是二氧化钛（TiO2），在这一领域的应用。铂和锡（Sn）被结合在双金属系统中以增强对羰基键氢化的选择性，从而得到所需的不饱和醇。锡的存在稳定了对所需产品的选择性，但存在一个最优的含量，在此之后选择性会下降。高温还原导致催化活性显著提高，并且增加了对不饱和醇的选择性，这与铂锡合金相的形成以及金属颗粒表面被部分还原的钛氧化物装饰有关。对于单一金属铂催化剂，观察到的行为则相反。
