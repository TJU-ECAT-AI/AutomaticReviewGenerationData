<p>In the field of fine chemicals, the preparation of unsaturated alcohols by the selective hydrogenation of the corresponding a,b-unsaturated aldehydes has a great industrial importance in the synthesis of many products.</p>
<p>This reaction constitutes a challenging task, since the hydrogenation of the C C bond is thermodynamically favored over the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, and with traditional hydrogenation catalysts the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol is usually low.</p>
<p>An improvement in activity and selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol has been found with the use of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts.</p>
<p>The promoter effect of tin is attributed to oxidized tin species which, acting as a Lewis acid, interacts with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond (basic group), thus weakening the C O bond and favoring its hydrogenation.</p>
<p>However, metallic tin has been also detected by XPS in these systems.</p>
<p>This metallic tin would be able to form Pt-Sn alloy phases, and the dilution of platinum by tin would destroy the platinum ensembles, lowering the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen and chemisorb the a,b-unsaturated aldehyde through the olefinic bond, thus hindering the C C hydrogenation reaction rate.</p>
<p>Another way to improve the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol is the use of a support that can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system.</p>
<p>Tauster et al. [8,9] found that, when partially reducible oxides such as TiO2 are used as support, they can modify the chemisorption behaviour of hydrogen and carbon monoxide on metals from groups 8, 9 and 10 after reduction at high temperature (about 773 K).</p>
<p>The term strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) was introduced to label this effect.</p>
<p>In the work presented here, the promoting effect of tin has been studied, in both metallic and oxidized states, in a series of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with different Pt:Sn atomic ratio, for the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde.</p>
<p>The influence of the strong metalsupport interaction effect on this reaction is also studied by using low (473 K) and high (773 K) reduction temperature treatments on the catalysts.</p>
<p>The catalysts have been characterized, after reduction at both temperatures, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, this allowing a comprehensive description of the surface composition and the available adsorption sites.</p>

The document discusses the use of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, aiming to improve the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol. Tin, in both metallic and oxidized states, plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity. High reduction temperatures lead to an increase in catalytic activity and selectivity towards crotyl alcohol. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect, induced by the use of TiO2 as a support, modifies the chemisorption behavior of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, enhancing the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond. The presence of Pt-Sn alloy phases and the dilution of platinum by tin impact the reaction rate and selectivity. The document also highlights the importance of using a support that can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system to improve the selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols.

[1] "In this work, the catalytic behaviour of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with different Pt:Sn atomic ratio is compared, after reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperature, for the vapour phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."

In the study, bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with various Pt:Sn atomic ratios were examined for vapor-phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The catalysts were reduced at 473 K and 773 K, revealing that tin exists in an oxidized state at 473 K and partly in a metallic state at 773 K. The presence of a Pt-Sn alloy was confirmed post-high-temperature reduction, with some platinum remaining in a non-alloyed state. High-temperature reduction led to a significant increase in catalytic activity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation and an enhancement in selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, resulting in the highest selectivity for the catalyst with the lowest Pt/Sn ratio. The study demonstrated that high-temperature reduction improves activity and selectivity, with the catalyst containing the highest tin content (1:2 Pt:Sn ratio) at 773 K showing the best performance in crotyl alcohol selectivity.

在研究中，不同Pt:Sn原子比的双金属PtSn/TiO2催化剂用于挥发性选择性氢化丙烯酸。催化剂在473 K和773 K下进行还原，结果显示锡在473 K时处于氧化状态，在773 K时部分为金属状态。通过原位红外光谱分析吸附CO，确认了高温度还原后催化剂中存在Pt-Sn合金，同时部分铂保持非合金状态。高温度还原显著提高了丙烯酸氢化活性，并增加了对羰基键氢化的选择性，获得最佳选择性的催化剂具有最低的Pt/Sn比例。研究结果表明，高温还原可以提高活性和选择性，含最高锡含量（1:2 Pt:Sn比例）的催化剂在773 K下表现出最佳的crotyl醇选择性。

In the study, the behavior of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with various Pt:Sn atomic ratios was compared. These catalysts were reduced at two temperatures, 473 K and 773 K, for the vapor-phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Tin was found in an oxidized state in the samples when they were not reduced or reduced at 473 K. However, at high reduction temperatures, a portion of tin was in a metallic state. High-temperature reduction led to a significant increase in catalytic activity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, and in most cases, an increase in the selectivity toward crotyl alcohol. Among the catalysts, the one with the highest tin content (Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2) and reduced at 773 K showed the best performance in terms of crotyl alcohol selectivity.

The literature focuses on the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, specifically Titanium Oxide (TiO2), in the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Platinum and tin (Sn) are used together in bimetallic systems to enhance the selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, yielding the unsaturated alcohol as the desired product. The presence of tin stabilizes the selectivity towards the desired product, but there is an optimal amount beyond which the selectivity decreases. High reduction temperatures lead to a dramatic increase in catalytic activity and an increase in the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol, correlating with the formation of Pt-Sn alloy phases and the decoration of metal particles by partially reduced titania. The opposite behavior is observed with monometallic Platinum catalysts.

文献主要关注在选择性氢化丙酮醛中使用贵金属基催化剂，尤其是铂金，并且关注金属氧化物催化剂，特别是二氧化钛（TiO2），在这一领域的应用。铂和锡（Sn）被结合在双金属系统中以增强对羰基键氢化的选择性，从而得到所需的不饱和醇。锡的存在稳定了对所需产品的选择性，但存在一个最优的含量，在此之后选择性会下降。高温还原导致催化活性显著提高，并且增加了对不饱和醇的选择性，这与铂锡合金相的形成以及金属颗粒表面被部分还原的钛氧化物装饰有关。对于单一金属铂催化剂，观察到的行为则相反。

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts (specifically Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalysts are not directly addressed. However, it is mentioned that bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts are effective in the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes, producing unsaturated alcohols. The promoter effect of tin is attributed to its ability to weaken the C=O bond, favoring hydrogenation. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect is also highlighted, which involves the formation of special sites at the interface between the metal and the support. The literature shows that reducing the catalyst at high temperatures (773 K) leads to an increase in activity and selectivity towards the production of unsaturated alcohols, compared to lower temperatures (473 K). However, the specific details of the compositions and effectiveness of CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are not provided. The literature focuses on the Pt-Sn system rather than discussing the broader range of catalyst types mentioned in the question.

文献讨论了贵金属催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。关于这些催化剂的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新进展以及潜在优势的具体信息没有直接提及。然而，文献提到双金属Pt-Sn催化剂在选择性氢化a,b-不饱和醛中有效，生成不饱和醇。锡的促进效果归因于其削弱C=O键的能力，有利于氢化。强金属-支持相互作用（SMSI）效应也被强调，涉及到金属与支持之间的界面形成特殊位点。文献表明，在高温度（773 K）下还原催化剂会导致活性和向不饱和醇生产的选择性增加，与低温（473 K）相比。然而，CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物的具体组成和有效性细节没有提供。文献专注于Pt-Sn系统，而不是讨论问题中提到的更广泛的催化剂类型。
