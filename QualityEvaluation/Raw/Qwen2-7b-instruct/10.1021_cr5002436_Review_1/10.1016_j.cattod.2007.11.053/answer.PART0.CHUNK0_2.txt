[1] "In this work, the catalytic behaviour of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with different Pt:Sn atomic ratio is compared, after reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperature, for the vapour phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
[2] "XPS results show that tin is in oxidized state when the samples are unreduced and reduced in situ at 473 K, whereas at high reduction temperature, a given amount of tin is in metallic state."
[3] "The effect of reduction at high temperature is a dramatic increase in catalytic activity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, and, in most cases, an increase in the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol."
[4] "Catalyst with the highest amount on tin (Pt:Sn = 1:2 atomic ratio) reduced at 773 K has shown the best performance in the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol."

In the study, the behavior of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with various Pt:Sn atomic ratios was compared. These catalysts were reduced at two temperatures, 473 K and 773 K, for the vapor-phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Tin was found in an oxidized state in the samples when they were not reduced or reduced at 473 K. However, at high reduction temperatures, a portion of tin was in a metallic state. High-temperature reduction led to a significant increase in catalytic activity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, and in most cases, an increase in the selectivity toward crotyl alcohol. Among the catalysts, the one with the highest tin content (Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2) and reduced at 773 K showed the best performance in terms of crotyl alcohol selectivity.

在这项研究中，对具有不同Pt:Sn原子比的双金属PtSn/TiO2催化剂的行为进行了比较。这些催化剂在473 K和773 K两种温度下被还原，用于丙酮醛的气相选择性氢化。当样品未被还原或在473 K下还原时，锡处于氧化状态。然而，在高温下，一定量的锡处于金属状态。高温还原导致了丙酮醛氢化反应活性的显著提高，并且在大多数情况下提高了向丙烯醇的选择性。在所有催化剂中，Pt:Sn比例为1:2、在773 K下还原的催化剂显示出最佳的丙烯醇选择性性能。
