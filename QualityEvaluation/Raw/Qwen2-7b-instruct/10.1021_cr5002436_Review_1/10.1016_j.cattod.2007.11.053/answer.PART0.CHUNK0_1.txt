[1] "In this work, the catalytic behaviour of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with different Pt:Sn atomic ratio is compared, after reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperature, for the vapour phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
[2] "XPS results show that tin is in oxidized state when the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, whereas a proportion is in the metallic state after reduction at 773 K."
[3] "The presence of Pt-Sn alloy in the catalysts after reduction at high temperature has been assessed by in situ IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, although a proportion of platinum remains in a non-alloyed state."
[4] "The catalytic activity in the vapour-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde increases after high temperature reduction, and the same behaviour is obtained with selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond to yield the unsaturated alcohol, the best selectivity being obtained for the catalyst with the lowest Pt/Sn ratio."
[5] "The effect of reduction at high temperature is a dramatic increase in catalytic activity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, and, in most cases, an increase in the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol."
[6] "Catalyst with the highest amount on tin (Pt:Sn = 1:2 atomic ratio) reduced at 773 K has shown the best performance in the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol."

In the study, bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with various Pt:Sn atomic ratios were examined for vapor-phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The catalysts were reduced at 473 K and 773 K, revealing that tin exists in an oxidized state at 473 K and partly in a metallic state at 773 K. The presence of a Pt-Sn alloy was confirmed post-high-temperature reduction, with some platinum remaining in a non-alloyed state. High-temperature reduction led to a significant increase in catalytic activity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation and an enhancement in selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, resulting in the highest selectivity for the catalyst with the lowest Pt/Sn ratio. The study demonstrated that high-temperature reduction improves activity and selectivity, with the catalyst containing the highest tin content (1:2 Pt:Sn ratio) at 773 K showing the best performance in crotyl alcohol selectivity.

在研究中，不同Pt:Sn原子比的双金属PtSn/TiO2催化剂用于挥发性选择性氢化丙烯酸。催化剂在473 K和773 K下进行还原，结果显示锡在473 K时处于氧化状态，在773 K时部分为金属状态。通过原位红外光谱分析吸附CO，确认了高温度还原后催化剂中存在Pt-Sn合金，同时部分铂保持非合金状态。高温度还原显著提高了丙烯酸氢化活性，并增加了对羰基键氢化的选择性，获得最佳选择性的催化剂具有最低的Pt/Sn比例。研究结果表明，高温还原可以提高活性和选择性，含最高锡含量（1:2 Pt:Sn比例）的催化剂在773 K下表现出最佳的crotyl醇选择性。
