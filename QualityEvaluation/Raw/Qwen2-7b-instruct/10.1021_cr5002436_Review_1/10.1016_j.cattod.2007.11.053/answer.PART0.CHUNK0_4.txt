[1] "In the field of fine chemicals, the preparation of unsaturated alcohols by the selective hydrogenation of the corresponding a,b-unsaturated aldehydes has a great industrial importance in the synthesis of many products."
[2] "An improvement in activity and selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol has been found with the use of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts."
[3] "The promoter effect of tin is attributed to oxidized tin species which, acting as a Lewis acid, interacts with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond (basic group), thus weakening the C O bond and favouring its hydrogenation."
[4] "The term strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) was introduced to label this effect."
[5] "Vannice found the promoter effect of TiO2 on metals from group 8 after reduction at 773 K for several reactions."
[6] "A model to explain this behaviour has been proposed, involving the formation of special sites at the interface between the metal and the support."
[7] "In this study, the only reaction products detected were butanal, crotyl alcohol and a small amount of butane and butanol."
[8] "For a monometallic Pt/TiO2, the opposite behaviour was found."
[9] "On the other hand, the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol for the catalyst with an atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 1:2 increases quickly in the first minutes on stream, reaching a maximum of 45%, and then decreases until reaching a value of 25% at the end of the reaction."
[10] "The evolution of the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol as a function of time on stream when the catalysts are reduced at high temperature (773 K) is quite similar."
[11] "For all catalysts, the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol was increased as compared to that obtained with catalysts reduced at low temperature (473 K), except for the catalyst with atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 1:2, for which the selectivity practically does not change."

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts (specifically Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalysts are not directly addressed. However, it is mentioned that bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts are effective in the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes, producing unsaturated alcohols. The promoter effect of tin is attributed to its ability to weaken the C=O bond, favoring hydrogenation. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect is also highlighted, which involves the formation of special sites at the interface between the metal and the support. The literature shows that reducing the catalyst at high temperatures (773 K) leads to an increase in activity and selectivity towards the production of unsaturated alcohols, compared to lower temperatures (473 K). However, the specific details of the compositions and effectiveness of CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are not provided. The literature focuses on the Pt-Sn system rather than discussing the broader range of catalyst types mentioned in the question.

文献讨论了贵金属催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。关于这些催化剂的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新进展以及潜在优势的具体信息没有直接提及。然而，文献提到双金属Pt-Sn催化剂在选择性氢化a,b-不饱和醛中有效，生成不饱和醇。锡的促进效果归因于其削弱C=O键的能力，有利于氢化。强金属-支持相互作用（SMSI）效应也被强调，涉及到金属与支持之间的界面形成特殊位点。文献表明，在高温度（773 K）下还原催化剂会导致活性和向不饱和醇生产的选择性增加，与低温（473 K）相比。然而，CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物的具体组成和有效性细节没有提供。文献专注于Pt-Sn系统，而不是讨论问题中提到的更广泛的催化剂类型。
