<p>In the field of fine chemicals, the preparation of unsaturated alcohols by the selective hydrogenation of the corresponding a,b-unsaturated aldehydes has a great industrial importance in the synthesis of many products.</p>
<p>This reaction constitutes a challenging task, since the hydrogenation of the C C bond is thermodynamically favored over the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, and with traditional hydrogenation catalysts the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol is usually low.</p>
<p>An improvement in activity and selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol has been found with the use of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts.</p>
<p>The promoter effect of tin is attributed to oxidized tin species which, acting as a Lewis acid, interacts with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond (basic group), thus weakening the C O bond and favoring its hydrogenation.</p>
<p>However, metallic tin has been also detected by XPS in these systems.</p>
<p>This metallic tin would be able to form Pt-Sn alloy phases, and the dilution of platinum by tin would destroy the platinum ensembles, lowering the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen and chemisorb the a,b-unsaturated aldehyde through the olefinic bond, thus hindering the C C hydrogenation reaction rate.</p>
<p>Another way to improve the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol is the use of a support that can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system.</p>
<p>Tauster et al. [8,9] found that, when partially reducible oxides such as TiO2 are used as support, they can modify the chemisorption behaviour of hydrogen and carbon monoxide on metals from groups 8, 9 and 10 after reduction at high temperature (about 773 K).</p>
<p>The term strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) was introduced to label this effect.</p>
<p>In the work presented here, the promoting effect of tin has been studied, in both metallic and oxidized states, in a series of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with different Pt:Sn atomic ratio, for the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde.</p>
<p>The influence of the strong metalsupport interaction effect on this reaction is also studied by using low (473 K) and high (773 K) reduction temperature treatments on the catalysts.</p>
<p>The catalysts have been characterized, after reduction at both temperatures, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, this allowing a comprehensive description of the surface composition and the available adsorption sites.</p>

The document discusses the use of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, aiming to improve the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol. Tin, in both metallic and oxidized states, plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity. High reduction temperatures lead to an increase in catalytic activity and selectivity towards crotyl alcohol. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect, induced by the use of TiO2 as a support, modifies the chemisorption behavior of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, enhancing the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond. The presence of Pt-Sn alloy phases and the dilution of platinum by tin impact the reaction rate and selectivity. The document also highlights the importance of using a support that can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system to improve the selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols.
