[1] "The experimental work includes a number of different pretreatments followed by different characterization techniques and activity measurements."
[2] "The bimetallic system PtSn has been much studied as a catalyst for reforming or dehydrogenation reactions."
[3] "This paper presents some experimental results from a study of Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on c-Al2O3 or SiO2 used in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
[4] "By combining the characterization results with specific activities (turnover frequencies) in propane dehydrogenation, we aim to show the influence of tin and how possible alloying influences the activity in dehydrogenation reactions."
[5] "The purpose of the wet calcination was to reduce the chlorine content of the catalysts."
[6] "Prior to activity measurements or chemisorption/TPD experiments, the catalysts were reduced in situ in flowing H2, using a heating rate of 4 K/min, up to 5198C, holding time 4 h."
[7] "The apparatus consists of a feed section with air-actuated selection valves (Valco) for switching between catalyst compositions."
[8] "The gases used in the activity measurements and characterization experiments were: H2 (purity 99.995%, Hydrogas), Ar (99.997%, Hydrogas), He (99.998%, Hydrogas), C3H8 (99.95, Air products), and N2 (99.99%, Hydrogas)."
[9] "The initial turnover frequencies (TOFs) for propane dehydrogenation over the catalysts at 4278C were close to 1 s−1."
[10] "The TPD profiles (Table 3) give some interesting information regarding the properties of these catalysts. After adsorption at 1008C (Fig. 5b) only the Pt/SiO2 shows a low temperature desorption peak."
