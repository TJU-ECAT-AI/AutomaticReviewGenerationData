Results and Discussion PtSn/SiO2 shows a large H2 consumption, and the calcula- tions indicate a more complete reduction of Sn compared to the PtSn/c-Al2O3 sample. The TPR profile is poorly resolved, and detailed assignments of reduction peaks is difficult. Reoxidation shifts and changes the peaks some- what, without influencing the H2 consumption significantly.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The PtSn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a substantial hydrogen consumption, suggesting a more thorough reduction of tin compared to the PtSn/c-Al2O3 catalyst. The Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) profile is not well-defined, making it challenging to assign specific reduction peaks. Reoxidation modifies the peaks somewhat, yet it does not significantly affect the hydrogen consumption.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
PtSn/SiO2催化剂表现出明显的氢消耗现象，暗示其锡的还原程度比PtSn/c-Al2O3催化剂更为彻底。温度程序化还原(TPR)谱图解析困难，难以明确指定还原峰的具体位置。再氧化过程会稍微改变这些峰的位置，但对氢消耗量的影响不大。
