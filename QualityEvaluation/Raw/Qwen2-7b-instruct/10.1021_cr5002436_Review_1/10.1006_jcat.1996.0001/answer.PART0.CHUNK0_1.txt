[18] "Acid-catalyzed cracking is important, giving C2H4 and H2 in equimolar amounts, and very little C2H6, ascribed to metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis."
[19] "The enhanced stability of the PtSn system is not due to reduced coke formation but to a change in the location of the coke from the metal to the support."
[20] "Both these factors point to the support and particularly the Pt-support interface as an important factor in determining the stability of the catalysts."

1. The study focuses on Pt and PtSn catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. These catalysts are supported on either c-Al2O3 or SiO2.

2. The research includes various pretreatments followed by different characterization and activity measurement techniques.

3. The catalysts were prepared using a standard impregnation process.

4. The PtSn bimetallic system has been extensively studied as a catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Sn acts as a promoter, enhancing the lifetime of the catalysts by reducing deactivation caused by coking.

6. On SiO2, Sn is more readily reduced, leading to alloy formation and increased Pt dispersion and stability.

7. Alloy formation results in similar Pt dispersion enhancement and improved catalytic stability, but a significant decrease in specific activity.

8. The catalysts' change in stability correlates with a dramatic change in hydrogen adsorption properties.

9. The initial activity after purging is affected differently; unpromoted catalysts lose activity rapidly, while promoted ones maintain activity over time.

10. The PtSn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits an initial activity increase after prolonged operation, similar to the PtSn/c-Al2O3 catalyst.

11. Purging the PtSn/c-Al2O3 catalyst with Ar reduces its initial activity by about 25%.

12. The PtSn catalysts show significantly lower selectivity to light products, with C2H6 becoming a major product.

13. Without Sn, the selectivity to light products is about 85-90%, while with Sn it reaches nearly 98%.

14. Sn promotes a substantial increase in hydrogen spillover on the catalyst surface.

15. Spillover hydrogen is present even after 30 minutes of Ar purge at 5508C.

16. SiO2-supported samples consistently exhibit high C3H6 selectivity.

17. Acid-catalyzed cracking generates C2H4 and H2 in equal amounts, with little C2H6, attributed to metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis.

18. The enhanced stability of PtSn catalysts is not due to reduced coke formation but to a shift in coke location from the metal to the support.

19. The support and, especially, the Pt-support interface play a critical role in determining catalyst stability.

20. Recent developments focus on understanding the structure, state of metals, and the impact of Sn addition on catalyst performance and stability.
