[1] "The experimental work includes a number of different pretreatments followed by different characterization techniques and activity measurements."
[2] "We have studied catalysts prepared by a standard impregnation technique."
[3] "By combining the characterization results with specific activities (turnover frequencies) in propane dehydrogenation, we aim to show the influence of tin and how possible alloying influences the activity in dehydrogenation reactions."
[4] "The bimetallic system PtSn has been much studied as a catalyst for reforming or dehydrogenation reactions."
[5] "Several suggestions have been made to explain the effect of tin as a promoter. Increased dispersion due to tin acting as a spacer (1) or formation of ensembles of a favorable size (2) are examples of explanations based on geometric effects."
[6] "It has also been suggested that tin leads to increased mobility of hydrogen (3) or poisons acidic sites on the alumina support (1, 4)."
[7] "The absence of any influence of both external and internal mass transfer resistance on the reaction rates was checked using the standard methods (larger catalyst particles and higher linear gas flow rates with constant space velocity)."
[8] "The TPR results show that Sn in PtSn/SiO2 is close to being completely reduced, and the specific activity of Pt is the same for Pt/c-Al2O3, PtSn/c-Al2O3, and Pt/SiO2, whereas PtSn/SiO2 is about one-tenth as active as the Pt alone."
[9] "The enhanced stability of the PtSn system is not due to reduced coke formation but to a change in the location of the coke from the metal to the support."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxides, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field are not directly addressed in the provided literature. 

The document focuses on the study of Platinum and Platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts supported on various supports like c-Al2O3 and SiO2 for propane dehydrogenation. It explores the preparation methods, characterization techniques, and activity measurements of these catalysts. It also delves into the state of tin in PtSn catalysts, the influence of tin on dispersion and stability, and the role of tin in promoting the activity of Platinum-based catalysts. The document highlights that the enhanced stability of PtSn systems might not be solely due to reduced coke formation but rather to a change in the location of coke deposition.

While the document provides insights into the behavior and performance of Platinum and PtSn catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions, it does not extensively compare these catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It lacks information on the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in comparison to noble metal-based catalysts for this specific application. To provide a comprehensive answer to the question, additional information from other sources would be required.

文档讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢反应中，贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的应用。关于这些催化剂的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展以及在该领域的潜在优势，提供的文献没有直接涉及。

文档重点研究了用于丙烷脱氢的铂和铂锡（PtSn）催化剂在不同支撑体（如c-Al2O3和SiO2）上的制备方法、表征技术以及活性测量。它还探讨了锡在PtSn催化剂中的状态、锡对分散性和稳定性的影响以及锡促进铂基催化剂活性的作用。文档指出，PtSn系统增强的稳定性可能不仅由于减少了焦炭形成，而是由于焦炭沉积位置的变化。

虽然文档提供了铂和PtSn催化剂在脱氢反应行为和性能方面的见解，但它没有对这两种催化剂在特定应用中的全面比较提供信息。关于金属氧化物基催化剂与贵金属基催化剂在组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展以及潜在优势方面的详细对比，需要从其他来源获取更多信息。
