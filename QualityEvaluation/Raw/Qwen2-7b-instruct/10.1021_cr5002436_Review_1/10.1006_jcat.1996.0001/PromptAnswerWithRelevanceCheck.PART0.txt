Results and Discussion PtSn/SiO2 shows a large H2 consumption, and the calcula- tions indicate a more complete reduction of Sn compared to the PtSn/c-Al2O3 sample. The TPR profile is poorly resolved, and detailed assignments of reduction peaks is difficult. Reoxidation shifts and changes the peaks some- what, without influencing the H2 consumption significantly.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The PtSn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a substantial hydrogen consumption, suggesting a more thorough reduction of tin compared to the PtSn/c-Al2O3 catalyst. The Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) profile is not well-defined, making it challenging to assign specific reduction peaks. Reoxidation modifies the peaks somewhat, yet it does not significantly affect the hydrogen consumption.

PtSn/SiO2催化剂表现出明显的氢消耗现象，暗示其锡的还原程度比PtSn/c-Al2O3催化剂更为彻底。温度程序化还原(TPR)谱图解析困难，难以明确指定还原峰的具体位置。再氧化过程会稍微改变这些峰的位置，但对氢消耗量的影响不大。

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxides, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field are not directly addressed in the provided literature. 

The document focuses on the study of Platinum and Platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts supported on various supports like c-Al2O3 and SiO2 for propane dehydrogenation. It explores the preparation methods, characterization techniques, and activity measurements of these catalysts. It also delves into the state of tin in PtSn catalysts, the influence of tin on dispersion and stability, and the role of tin in promoting the activity of Platinum-based catalysts. The document highlights that the enhanced stability of PtSn systems might not be solely due to reduced coke formation but rather to a change in the location of coke deposition.

While the document provides insights into the behavior and performance of Platinum and PtSn catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions, it does not extensively compare these catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It lacks information on the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in comparison to noble metal-based catalysts for this specific application.
