[1] "The experimental work includes a number of different pretreatments followed by different characterization techniques and activity measurements."
[2] "We have studied catalysts prepared by a standard impregnation technique."
[3] "The bimetallic system PtSn has been much studied as a catalyst for reforming or dehydrogenation reactions."
[4] "Without the promoter Pt shows the same initial specific activity on both supports, but deactivates due to coking."
[5] "The change in catalytic stability on both supports is paralleled by a dramatic change in the hydrogen adsorption properties."
[6] "The presence of subsurface hydrogen on the support surface could be very important in understanding industrial catalysts."
[7] "The mechanism of the increase in spillover observed with Sn promotion is unclear."
[8] "This experiment is suitable for determining Pt dispersion, as the spillover of hydrogen to the support obscures the measurement of the dispersion."

The document discusses the preparation, characterization, and activity measurements of noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field are not covered in the provided literature. However, the document highlights the preparation methods of the catalysts, the influence of tin as a promoter, the changes in hydrogen adsorption properties, and the impact of tin on the stability of the catalysts. The study focuses on the Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on c-Al2O3 or SiO2 and their activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts versus metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. 

The document does not discuss the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts specifically. It focuses on the Pt and PtSn catalysts and their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The document does not compare these catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts. Therefore, there is no information provided in the document to answer questions regarding the comparison of noble metal-based catalysts versus metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The information in the document is limited to the preparation, characterization, and activity measurements of the Pt and PtSn catalysts.
