[1] "The dynamics of the global market are closely linked to trends in the paper, automotive, plastics and construc- tion industries, which are significantly affected by cyclical fluctuations of the global economy."
[2] "In particular, the demand for precipitated CaCO3 (PCC) fell drastically owing to the steep decline in paper output in the USA and Europe."
[3] "The automotive industry is the largest sales market for carbon black. Its development is decisive for both the tyre segment as well as the utilization of a wide range of rubber products."
[4] "Unsurprisingly, Asia Pacific is found to be the main driver for growth; consumption and production volumes in this region are both expected to increase by more than 4.5% per annum."
[5] "Analytical laboratories, regulatory bodies and manufacturers will all use ASTM D7823 to determine whether a product meets the requirements of Section 108 of the CPSIA law."

1. The global market dynamics are closely tied to the cyclical fluctuations of the global economy, influencing industries such as paper, automotive, plastics, and construction. This relationship impacts demand patterns for materials like calcium carbonate and carbon black.
2. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) demand saw a significant drop, particularly in the USA and Europe, due to the substantial decrease in paper output.
3. The automotive industry plays a pivotal role in driving the market for carbon black, as its performance directly affects both the tyre segment and the usage of various rubber products.
4. Asia Pacific emerges as the leading driver of growth for both consumption and production volumes, with an expected annual increase of over 4.5%.
5. ASTM D7823 serves as a critical tool for analytical laboratories, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 108 of the CPSIA law regarding phthalate identification in polyvinyl chloride plastics.
