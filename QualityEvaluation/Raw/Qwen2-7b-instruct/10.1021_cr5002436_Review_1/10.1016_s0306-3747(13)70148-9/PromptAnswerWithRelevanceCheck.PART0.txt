The document discusses the global market for carbon black, noting that demand is expected to rise dynamically until 2019, with the market volume anticipated to increase by over 3.1 million tonnes from 2011 levels. The largest share of consumption is in the production of tires and various rubber products. Carbon black is also utilized in other sectors such as plastics, paints, varnishes, and printing inks as a pigment. The automotive industry is identified as the primary market for carbon black, affecting both tire production and the usage of rubber products. Asia Pacific is highlighted as the key driver for growth, with consumption and production volumes expected to increase by more than 4.5% annually. China is noted as the dominant player in the market, accounting for over 30% of the global carbon black market volume. Due to substantial capacity expansions, the region is projected to become a net exporter in the future.
