The literature does not provide information comparing and contrasting noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It focuses on topics such as the market dynamics of calcium carbonate, the growth prospects in different regions, and environmental, health, and safety issues related to plastic products and carbon black. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided information.
