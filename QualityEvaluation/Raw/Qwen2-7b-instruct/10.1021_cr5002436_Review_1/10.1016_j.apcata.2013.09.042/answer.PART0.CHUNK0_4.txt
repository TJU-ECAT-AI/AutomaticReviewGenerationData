There is a detailed study of dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over Pt Sn/Mg Al<sub>O</sub> catalysts. The Mg Al<sub>O</sub> supports with different Mg/Al mole ratio were prepared using a chemical co-precipitation method. The supports and supported Pt Sn catalysts were characterized using BET, XRD, CO-chemisorption, NH3-TPD, and TG. The dehydrogenation products were analyzed by GC. An in situ TOF-MS was developed and used to monitor the dehydrogenation products on-line during continuous reactions. Adding Mg to the supports decreased the specific surface area, increased the pore volume and diameter, moderated the acidity, and changed the strong acidic sites to weak ones. The dehydrogenation activity of the catalysts was inhibited, while the mono-olefin selectivity and yield were enhanced by Mg addition. Using a 1/3 Mg/Al molar ratio generated the optimal n-dodecene yield over the Pt Sn/Mg Al<sub>O</sub> catalysts. The TOF-MS was reliable for detecting the dehydrogenation products of the long-chain paraffins rapidly, continuously, and accurately. The study highlights the importance of Mg addition in improving catalyst performance in the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane.

对n-十二烷的Pt Sn/Mg Al<sub>O</sub>催化剂进行了详细的研究。不同Mg/Al摩尔比的Mg Al<sub>O</sub>支持体通过化学共沉淀法制备。使用BET、XRD、CO-化学吸附、NH3-TPD和TG对支持体和支持体Pt Sn催化剂进行了表征。通过GC分析了脱氢产物。开发了一种在线TOF-MS，用于连续反应过程中监测脱氢产物。向支持体中添加Mg降低了特定表面面积，增加了孔体积和直径，调节了总酸度，并将强酸性位点转变为弱酸性位点。催化剂的脱氢活性被抑制，而单烯烃选择性和产率则通过Mg的添加得到提高。使用1/3的Mg/Al摩尔比产生了最佳的n-十二烯产率。TOF-MS可靠地检测了长链烷烃的脱氢产物快速、连续和准确。研究强调了在n-十二烷脱氢过程中添加Mg对催化剂性能的重要性。
