[1] "A detailed study of the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over Al2O3- and Mg Al O-supported Pt Sn catalysts was reported."
[2] "A new on-line TOF-MS monitoring method was developed to analyze the products over the catalysts in situ."
[3] "The strong acidic sites in the alumina-supported catalysts favored the formation of aromatics and low selectivities for mono-olefins."
[4] "Adding Mg to the supports achieved the following: (i) moderated the total acidity of the catalysts, weakening the strong acidic sites; (ii) increased the interaction between the Pt and the supports, weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the Pt surface and Pt C bond strength to promote the desorption of the dehydrogenation products; (iii) increased the total pore volume and pore size diameter; (iv) decreased both the specific surface area of the supports and the Pt dispersion on the catalysts."
[5] "The catalysts with added Mg inhibited the side reactions and enhanced both the mono-olefin selectivity and the yield while suppressing the dehydrogenation activity."
[6] "When the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3, the optimal n-dodecene yield could be obtained."
[7] "The coke deposition over the catalysts can increase the selectivity of the catalysts."
[8] "The on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology is a proven and effective method that can be applied in situ during high temperature reactions for detecting the products over the catalysts rapidly and continuously."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins involves examining their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages.

Noble metal-based catalysts, like Platinum, are known for their high reactivity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes. They are often used due to their ability to efficiently convert light olefins into lighter hydrocarbons. However, they can be expensive and require careful handling to maintain their efficiency.

Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, offer a more affordable alternative. They are often used to modulate the acidity and porosity of the catalyst, which can affect the dehydrogenation rates and product selectivity. By adding metals like Cr, Ga, In, V, Zn, or Mo to these oxides, the catalysts can be optimized for specific reactions.

In the context of the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane, the addition of magnesium oxide to the supports showed several benefits. It helped in moderating the total acidity of the catalysts, reducing the formation of aromatics and enhancing the mono-olefin selectivity. This resulted in improved yields and catalyst stability, with the optimal n-dodecene yield achieved when the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3. The magnesium addition also suppressed deep dehydrogenation, leading to lower coke formation and improved selectivity.

The use of on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology proved to be an effective method for analyzing products over catalysts in situ during high-temperature reactions. It offered rapid and continuous detection of changes in reaction products, which can significantly enhance the understanding and optimization of the dehydrogenation process.

The key advantages of using these catalysts include their ability to selectively convert light olefins, reduce coke formation, and maintain high stability over prolonged periods. The integration of magnesium oxide into the catalysts' structure allows for better control over the dehydrogenation process, leading to improved yields and selectivities of desired products.

在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中，比较贵金属催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）涉及研究它们的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展以及潜在优势。

贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，因其在脱氢过程中的高反应性和选择性而闻名。它们经常被使用，因为它们能够有效地将轻烯烃转化为较轻的碳氢化合物。然而，它们可能成本较高，并且需要精心处理以保持其效率。

金属氧化物催化剂则提供了一个更经济的选择。它们通常用于调节催化剂的酸性和孔隙率，这会影响脱氢速率和产物选择性。通过向这些氧化物中添加Cr、Ga、In、V、Zn或Mo等金属，可以优化催化剂以适应特定反应。

在十二烷脱氢的背景下，向支持物中添加镁氧化物显示了一系列益处。它有助于调节催化剂的总酸度，减少芳香族化合物的形成并增强单烯烃选择性。这导致了改善的产率和催化剂稳定性，当Mg/Al摩尔比为1/3时实现了最佳的十二碳烯产率。镁的添加也抑制了深度脱氢，导致焦炭形成减少和选择性提高。

在线TOF-MS监控技术被证明是一种有效的方法，在高温反应中对催化剂上的产品进行原位分析。它提供了快速和连续的产品变化检测，这可以显著增强对脱氢过程的理解和优化。

这些催化剂的关键优势包括它们能够选择性地转化轻烯烃、减少焦炭形成并维持长时间的高稳定性。将镁氧化物整合到催化剂结构中允许更好地控制脱氢过程，从而实现理想的期望产品的产率和选择性。
