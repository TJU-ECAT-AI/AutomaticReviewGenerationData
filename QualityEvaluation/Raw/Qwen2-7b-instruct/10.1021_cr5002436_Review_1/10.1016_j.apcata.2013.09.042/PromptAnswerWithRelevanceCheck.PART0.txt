1. A comprehensive study was conducted on the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over catalysts supported by aluminum oxide and magnesium-aluminum oxide, incorporating platinum and tin metals. An innovative real-time TOF-MS monitoring technique was introduced for analyzing the products directly over these catalysts.

2. Strong acidic sites in aluminum oxide-based catalysts promoted the formation of aromatics and reduced mono-olefin selectivity. By adding magnesium to the supports, the total acidity of the catalysts was reduced, particularly the strong acidic sites. This led to increased interaction between platinum and the supports, weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the platinum surface and the strength of the Pt-C bond, facilitating the release of dehydrogenation products.

3. Magnesium incorporation resulted in an increase in the total pore volume and pore size diameter, and a decrease in the specific surface area of the supports, as well as a reduction in platinum dispersion on the catalysts. 

4. Catalysts with added magnesium suppressed side reactions, enhanced mono-olefin selectivity and yield, and diminished dehydrogenation activity. 

5. Achieving a magnesium-to-aluminum molar ratio of 1/3 yielded the optimal n-dodecene output.

6. The deposition of coke on catalysts can boost the selectivity of the catalysts.

7. Real-time TOF-MS monitoring technology is a validated and efficient method for detecting products during high temperature reactions in situ, offering rapid and continuous detection capabilities.

8. The on-line TOF-MS monitoring method provides accurate and extensive information on dehydrogenation production, enhancing the in situ monitoring of reaction product changes during the dehydrogenation process.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins involves examining their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages.

Noble metal-based catalysts, like Platinum, are known for their high reactivity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes. They are often used due to their ability to efficiently convert light olefins into lighter hydrocarbons. However, they can be expensive and require careful handling to maintain their efficiency.

Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, offer a more affordable alternative. They are often used to modulate the acidity and porosity of the catalyst, which can affect the dehydrogenation rates and product selectivity. By adding metals like Cr, Ga, In, V, Zn, or Mo to these oxides, the catalysts can be optimized for specific reactions.

In the context of the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane, the addition of magnesium oxide to the supports showed several benefits. It helped in moderating the total acidity of the catalysts, reducing the formation of aromatics and enhancing the mono-olefin selectivity. This resulted in improved yields and catalyst stability, with the optimal n-dodecene yield achieved when the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3. The magnesium addition also suppressed deep dehydrogenation, leading to lower coke formation and improved selectivity.

The use of on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology proved to be an effective method for analyzing products over catalysts in situ during high-temperature reactions. It offered rapid and continuous detection of changes in reaction products, which can significantly enhance the understanding and optimization of the dehydrogenation process.

The key advantages of using these catalysts include their ability to selectively convert light olefins, reduce coke formation, and maintain high stability over prolonged periods. The integration of magnesium oxide into the catalysts' structure allows for better control over the dehydrogenation process, leading to improved yields and selectivities of desired products.

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum is known for its high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. Metal oxides, on the other hand, can act as both acidic and basic sites, influencing the reaction pathways and product distributions. Recent developments aim to enhance the stability, selectivity, and efficiency of these catalysts by modifying their compositions, structures, and interactions with reactants.

2. Platinum-based catalysts show high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes, particularly for the production of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. They are widely used in industrial processes due to their efficiency in converting long-chain paraffins to olefins. Metal oxide catalysts, especially those with tuned acidity, can offer better selectivity for specific products like mono-olefins, reducing the formation of unwanted side products such as aromatics and di-olefins. By incorporating metals like magnesium, the catalysts can achieve a balance between acidity and surface area, leading to improved performance in terms of yield, selectivity, and lifetime.

3. Industrial applications of these catalysts include petrochemical processes, such as the conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable chemical intermediates. They play a crucial role in the synthesis of detergents, fuels, and other petrochemical products. Recent advancements focus on developing catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity, which can operate under harsher conditions with lower energy consumption.

4. The potential advantages of these catalysts lie in their ability to efficiently convert feedstocks into desired products with minimal byproducts. This not only improves the economic viability of the processes but also reduces environmental impacts by minimizing waste generation. Additionally, the development of more selective catalysts can lead to higher yields of target products, enhancing the profitability of petrochemical industries.

5. In the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, noble metals like Platinum offer unparalleled catalytic activity and selectivity. However, they can be expensive and susceptible to poisoning by certain impurities. Metal oxides, on the other hand, are more cost-effective and can be tailored to have specific acidic or basic properties, making them suitable for a wider range of reaction conditions. The incorporation of metals such as magnesium can further optimize the catalyst's performance by balancing the acidity and surface properties, leading to enhanced selectivity and lifetime.

6. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly those supported on metal oxides, demonstrate the ability to inhibit side reactions and enhance the yield of desired products, such as mono-olefins, by optimizing the balance between the acidic and basic sites on the catalyst surface. This selective dehydrogenation leads to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes.

7. The optimal n-dodecene yield was achieved when the magnesium/aluminum molar ratio was 1:3, highlighting the importance of tuning the composition of metal oxide supports to achieve the best catalytic performance. This finding underscores the potential of magnesium incorporation in enhancing the selectivity and yield of desired products in dehydrogenation reactions.

8. The presence of coke on the catalysts can actually increase the selectivity of the catalysts by blocking some acidic sites. This phenomenon suggests that the formation of coke might be beneficial in certain cases, as it can lead to an improved selectivity for specific products. However, this requires careful control to prevent excessive coke formation, which can deactivate the catalysts over time.

There is a detailed study of dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over Pt Sn/Mg Al<sub>O</sub> catalysts. The Mg Al<sub>O</sub> supports with different Mg/Al mole ratio were prepared using a chemical co-precipitation method. The supports and supported Pt Sn catalysts were characterized using BET, XRD, CO-chemisorption, NH3-TPD, and TG. The dehydrogenation products were analyzed by GC. An in situ TOF-MS was developed and used to monitor the dehydrogenation products on-line during continuous reactions. Adding Mg to the supports decreased the specific surface area, increased the pore volume and diameter, moderated the acidity, and changed the strong acidic sites to weak ones. The dehydrogenation activity of the catalysts was inhibited, while the mono-olefin selectivity and yield were enhanced by Mg addition. Using a 1/3 Mg/Al molar ratio generated the optimal n-dodecene yield over the Pt Sn/Mg Al<sub>O</sub> catalysts. The TOF-MS was reliable for detecting the dehydrogenation products of the long-chain paraffins rapidly, continuously, and accurately. The study highlights the importance of Mg addition in improving catalyst performance in the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane.
