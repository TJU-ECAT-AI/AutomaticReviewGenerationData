[1] "A detailed study of the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over Al2O3- and Mg Al O-supported Pt Sn catalysts was reported."
[2] "The strong acidic sites in the alumina-supported catalysts favored the formation of aromatics and low selectivities for mono-olefins."
[3] "Adding Mg to the sup-ports achieved the following: (i) moderated the total acidity of the catalysts, weakening the strong acidic sites; (ii) increased the interaction between the Pt and the supports, weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the Pt surface and Pt C bond strength to promote the desorption of the dehydrogenation products; (iii) increased the total pore volume and pore size diameter; (iv) decreased both the specific surface area of the supports and the Pt dispersion on the catalysts."
[4] "The catalysts with added Mg inhibited the side reactions and enhanced both the mono-olefin selectivity and the yield while suppressing the dehydrogenation activity."
[5] "When the Mg/Al molar ratio was 1/3, the optimal n-dodecene yield could be obtained."
[6] "The coke deposition over the catalysts can increase the selectivity of the catalysts."
[7] "The on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology is a proven and effective method that can be applied in situ during high temperature reactions for detecting the products over the catalysts rapidly and continuously."

The study compared noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts showed high activity initially, but the addition of magnesium oxide to the supports helped moderate the acidity, weaken the strong acidic sites, increase the interaction between Platinum and the supports, decrease the specific surface area, and reduce the Pt dispersion, thereby inhibiting side reactions, enhancing mono-olefin selectivity and yield, and improving catalyst stability. The optimal n-dodecene yield was achieved with a Mg/Al molar ratio of 1/3. The on-line TOF-MS monitoring technology was proven effective for continuously detecting the products during high temperature reactions.

该研究比较了贵金属催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。铂基催化剂表现出初期高活性，但向支撑体中添加镁氧化物有助于调节酸性，削弱强酸性位点，增强铂与支撑体之间的相互作用，减少特定表面面积并降低铂分散度，从而抑制副反应，提高单烯烃选择性和产率，并改善催化剂稳定性。获得最优的十二碳烯产率所需的镁/铝摩尔比为1/3。在线TOF-MS监控技术被证明是有效的方法，在高温反应中实时检测催化剂上的产物。
