1. A comprehensive study was conducted on the dehydrogenation of n-dodecane over catalysts supported by aluminum oxide and magnesium-aluminum oxide, incorporating platinum and tin metals. An innovative real-time TOF-MS monitoring technique was introduced for analyzing the products directly over these catalysts.

2. Strong acidic sites in aluminum oxide-based catalysts promoted the formation of aromatics and reduced mono-olefin selectivity. By adding magnesium to the supports, the total acidity of the catalysts was reduced, particularly the strong acidic sites. This led to increased interaction between platinum and the supports, weakening the adsorption of n-dodecane on the platinum surface and the strength of the Pt-C bond, facilitating the release of dehydrogenation products.

3. Magnesium incorporation resulted in an increase in the total pore volume and pore size diameter, and a decrease in the specific surface area of the supports, as well as a reduction in platinum dispersion on the catalysts. 

4. Catalysts with added magnesium suppressed side reactions, enhanced mono-olefin selectivity and yield, and diminished dehydrogenation activity. 

5. Achieving a magnesium-to-aluminum molar ratio of 1/3 yielded the optimal n-dodecene output.

6. The deposition of coke on catalysts can boost the selectivity of the catalysts.

7. Real-time TOF-MS monitoring technology is a validated and efficient method for detecting products during high temperature reactions in situ, offering rapid and continuous detection capabilities.

8. The on-line TOF-MS monitoring method provides accurate and extensive information on dehydrogenation production, enhancing the in situ monitoring of reaction product changes during the dehydrogenation process.

1. 对n-十二烷的脱氢作用进行了全面研究，使用了铝氧化物和镁铝氧化物支持的铂锡催化剂。引入了一种实时TOF-MS监测技术，用于直接分析这些催化剂上的产品。

2. 铝氧化物基催化剂中的强酸性位点促进了芳香化合物的形成并降低了单烯烃选择性。通过添加镁到支持物中，可以降低催化剂的总酸度，特别是强酸性位点。这导致铂与支持物之间增强的相互作用，减弱了n-十二烷在铂表面的吸附以及Pt-C键的强度，从而促进脱氢产物的释放。

3. 添加镁后，总孔体积和孔径直径增加，支持物的比表面积下降，并且铂在催化剂上的分散度减少。

4. 添加镁的催化剂抑制了副反应，提高了单烯烃的选择性和产率，同时抑制了脱氢活性。

5. 当镁与铝的摩尔比为1/3时，可以获得最佳的n-十二碳烯产量。

6. 催化剂上的焦炭沉积可以提高催化剂的选择性。

7. 实时TOF-MS监测技术是一种验证过的有效方法，在高温反应中原位检测催化剂上的产品，提供快速和连续的检测能力。

8. 在线TOF-MS监测方法提供了脱氢生产准确和广泛的详细信息，增强了对脱氢过程中反应产物变化的原位监测。
