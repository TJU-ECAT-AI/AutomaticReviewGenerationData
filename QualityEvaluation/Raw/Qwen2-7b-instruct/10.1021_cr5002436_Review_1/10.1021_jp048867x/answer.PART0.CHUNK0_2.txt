Ethylene hydrogenation was selected as a model reaction to evaluate the activity of the Pt/SBA-15 catalysts. The study revealed that the ethylene hydrogenation reaction was insensitive to the structure of the catalyst over a range of Pt particle sizes from 1.7 to 3.6 nm. However, the hydrogenolysis of ethane showed a weak structure sensitivity, with smaller particles exhibiting higher specific activity. It was observed that the turnover rates for ethane hydrogenolysis increased steadily with the metal dispersion, indicating that the coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms in small particles are more effective for the hydrogenolysis of ethane compared to the dominant low index planes in larger particles. A detailed discussion on the apparent structure sensitivity of ethane hydrogenolysis is provided later in the document.

乙烯氢化被选作模型反应来评估铂/SBA-15催化剂的活性。研究表明，乙烯氢化反应对催化剂结构不敏感，在1.7至3.6 nm的铂颗粒尺寸范围内。然而，乙烷的氢解表现出较弱的结构敏感性，小颗粒显示出更高的特定活性。观察到乙烷氢解的转速随金属分散度的增加而稳步增加，表明小颗粒中的可协调未饱和金属原子在乙烷氢解中比大型颗粒中的主要低指数平面更为有效。后续文档中提供了关于乙烷氢解显在结构敏感性的详细讨论。
