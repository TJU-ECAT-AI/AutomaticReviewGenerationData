[1] "Pt nanoparticles with narrow size distributions (i.e., monodispersed) were produced by various solution-based reduction methods and mesoporous SBA-15 silica was produced by well-established hydrothermal reactions."
[2] "Pt nanoparticles were embedded into the mesoporous silica using low power sonication."
[3] "The as-synthesized Pt/SBA-15 was calcined under specific conditions to remove the template polymer from the nanoparticle surface and subsequently reduced to remove oxygen from the Pt surface."
[4] "Ethylene hydrogenation and ethane hydrogenolysis were used as test reactions to compare the activity of our high-surface-area monodispersed metal nanocatalysts with classical high-surface-area catalysts."
[5] "Turnover rates for room-temperature hydrogenation of ethylene were identical to a Pt/SiO2 catalyst made by ion exchange and in good agreement with single-crystal measurements, confirming the structure insensitivity of this reaction."
[6] "Ethane hydrogenolysis rates were comparable to rates on Pt powder and an ion-exchanged Pt/SiO2 catalyst. The Pt/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated weak structure sensitivity, with smaller particles demonstrating higher activity."
[7] "These catalysts exhibited excellent thermal stability under relevant turnover conditions."

The document discusses the synthesis and characterization of high-surface-area platinum nanoparticles embedded in mesoporous SBA-15 silica. These nanoparticles were created through various solution-based reduction methods, and the synthesis process involved the use of low power sonication to embed the nanoparticles into the silica. The catalysts were then calcined to remove the template polymer and reduced to remove oxygen from the platinum surface. The nanoparticles showed identical activity to classical high-surface-area catalysts in the hydrogenation of ethylene, confirming the structure insensitivity of the reaction. For ethane hydrogenolysis, the Pt/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated weak structure sensitivity, with smaller particles showing higher activity. The catalysts maintained excellent thermal stability under relevant turnover conditions. This development provides a model system for studying structure-selectivity correlations in heterogeneous catalysis.

文档讨论了在介孔SBA-15硅中嵌入单分散铂纳米颗粒的合成和表征。这些纳米颗粒通过多种溶液基还原方法制备，合成过程中使用低功率超声波将纳米颗粒嵌入到二氧化硅中。催化剂随后被煅烧以去除模板聚合物并还原以去除铂表面的氧。这些颗粒在乙烷氢化反应中的活性与经典高比表面积催化剂相同，证实了该反应的结构不敏感性。对于乙烷氢解，Pt/SBA-15催化剂显示出较弱的结构敏感性，较小的颗粒表现出更高的活性。在相关转化条件下，催化剂表现出出色的热稳定性。这一发展为研究异相催化中的结构选择性关系提供了一个模型系统。
