[1] "Pt nanoparticles with narrow size distributions (i.e., monodispersed) were produced by various solution-based reduction methods and mesoporous SBA-15 silica was produced by well-established hydrothermal reactions."
[2] "After incorporation into mesoporous SBA-15 silica using low-power sonication, the catalysts were calcined to remove the stabilizing polymer from the nanoparticle surface and reduced by H2."
[3] "Ethylene hydrogenation and ethane hydrogenolysis were used as test reactions to compare the activity of our high-surface-area monodispersed metal nanocatalysts with classical high-surface-area catalysts."
[4] "Turnover rates for room-temperature hydrogenation of ethylene were identical to a Pt/SiO2 catalyst made by ion exchange and in good agreement with single-crystal measurements, confirming the structure insensitivity of this reaction."
[5] "Ethane hydrogenolysis rates were comparable to rates on Pt powder and an ion-exchanged Pt/SiO2 catalyst. The Pt/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated weak structure sensitivity, with smaller particles demonstrating higher activity."
[6] "These catalysts exhibited excellent thermal stability under relevant turnover conditions."
[7] "The synthesis of these catalysts is a general procedure which enables numerous metal/support systems to be constructed for the study of structureselectivity correlations in heterogeneous catalysis."

The document discusses the synthesis and characterization of platinum nanoparticles embedded in mesoporous silica. The nanoparticles, with sizes ranging from 1.7 to 7.1 nm, were produced using alcohol reduction methods. They were incorporated into mesoporous SBA-15 silica via sonication, and then calcined and reduced to prepare catalysts. The catalysts were characterized using TEM, XRD, and chemisorption techniques. Ethylene hydrogenation and ethane hydrogenolysis were used as test reactions to compare the activity of the Pt/SBA-15 catalysts with conventional high-surface-area catalysts. The results showed that the structure of the catalysts had a weak influence on the activity for ethane hydrogenolysis, with smaller particles demonstrating higher activity. The catalysts also showed good thermal stability. This research provides a model system for studying structure-selectivity relationships in heterogeneous catalysis.

Ethylene hydrogenation was selected as a model reaction to evaluate the activity of the Pt/SBA-15 catalysts. The study revealed that the ethylene hydrogenation reaction was insensitive to the structure of the catalyst over a range of Pt particle sizes from 1.7 to 3.6 nm. However, the hydrogenolysis of ethane showed a weak structure sensitivity, with smaller particles exhibiting higher specific activity. It was observed that the turnover rates for ethane hydrogenolysis increased steadily with the metal dispersion, indicating that the coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms in small particles are more effective for the hydrogenolysis of ethane compared to the dominant low index planes in larger particles. A detailed discussion on the apparent structure sensitivity of ethane hydrogenolysis is provided later in the document.
