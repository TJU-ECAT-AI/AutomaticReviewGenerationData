1. Noble metal-based catalysts, especially Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts are utilized in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum nanoparticles with a size range of 1.7 to 7.1 nm were created using alcohol reduction methods. Mesoporous SBA-15 silica, synthesized via a hydrothermal process, served as a catalyst support. Ethylene and ethane hydrogenolysis were employed as test reactions to evaluate the activity of these high-surface-area metal nanocatalysts against conventional high-surface-area catalysts. The Pt/SBA-15 catalysts showed slight structural sensitivity, with smaller particles exhibiting higher activity. Ethane hydrogenolysis rates were equivalent to those on Platinum powder and ion-exchanged Platinum/SiO2 catalysts.

1. 高贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）广泛用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。通过酒精还原方法制备了尺寸范围为1.7到7.1 nm的铂纳米颗粒。通过水热合成过程制备了具有中孔结构的SBA-15硅酸盐作为催化剂载体。乙烯和乙烷氢解用作测试反应，以比较这些高比表面积的金属纳米催化剂与经典高比表面积催化剂的活性。Pt/SBA-15催化剂显示出轻微的结构敏感性，较小的颗粒表现出更高的活性。乙烷氢解速率与铂粉和离子交换铂/SiO2催化剂相当。
