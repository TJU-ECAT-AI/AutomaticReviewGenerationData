[1] "Pt nanoparticles with narrow size distributions (i.e., monodispersed) were produced by various solution-based reduction methods and mesoporous SBA-15 silica was produced by well-established hydrothermal reactions."
[2] "After incorporation into mesoporous SBA-15 silica using low-power sonication, the catalysts were calcined to remove the stabilizing polymer from the nanoparticle surface and reduced by H2."
[3] "Ethylene hydrogenation and ethane hydrogenolysis were used as test reactions to compare the activity of our high-surface-area monodispersed metal nanocatalysts with classical high-surface-area catalysts."
[4] "Turnover rates for room-temperature hydrogenation of ethylene were identical to a Pt/SiO2 catalyst made by ion exchange and in good agreement with single-crystal measurements, confirming the structure insensitivity of this reaction."
[5] "Ethane hydrogenolysis rates were comparable to rates on Pt powder and an ion-exchanged Pt/SiO2 catalyst. The Pt/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated weak structure sensitivity, with smaller particles demonstrating higher activity."
[6] "These catalysts exhibited excellent thermal stability under relevant turnover conditions."
[7] "The synthesis of these catalysts is a general procedure which enables numerous metal/support systems to be constructed for the study of structureselectivity correlations in heterogeneous catalysis."

1. Platinum nanoparticles were synthesized using various solution-based reduction methods. They were then embedded into mesoporous SBA-15 silica via low-power sonication. Afterward, the catalysts were calcined to remove the stabilizing polymer and reduced by hydrogen. 
2. Ethylene hydrogenation and ethane hydrogenolysis were employed as test reactions to evaluate the activity of these high-surface-area metal nanocatalysts against classical high-surface-area catalysts.
3. The room-temperature ethylene hydrogenation turnover rates matched those of a Pt/SiO2 catalyst prepared by ion exchange, indicating the structure insensitivity of the reaction.
4. Ethane hydrogenolysis rates on the Pt/SBA-15 catalysts were similar to those on Pt powder and an ion-exchanged Pt/SiO2 catalyst, showing weak structure sensitivity with smaller particles being more active.
5. These catalysts maintained their stability under relevant turnover conditions.
6. The synthesis process allowed for the creation of numerous metal/support systems to study structureselectivity correlations in heterogeneous catalysis.

1. 铂纳米颗粒通过各种溶液还原方法合成。随后，它们被嵌入到微孔SBA-15二氧化硅中，通过低功率超声波。之后，催化剂经过煅烧去除表面稳定聚合物，并用氢气还原。
2. 使用乙烯氢化和乙烷氢解作为测试反应，评估这些高比表面积金属纳米催化剂与经典高比表面积催化剂的活性。
3. 室温下乙烯氢化转化率与通过离子交换法制备的Pt/SiO2催化剂相匹配，表明该反应结构不敏感。
4. 乙烷氢解速率在Pt/SBA-15催化剂上与Pt粉末和离子交换的Pt/SiO2催化剂相似，显示出弱结构敏感性，小颗粒表现更佳。
5. 这些催化剂在相关周转条件下表现出良好的稳定性。
6. 合成过程允许创建多种金属/支持系统来研究异质催化中的结构选择性相关性。
