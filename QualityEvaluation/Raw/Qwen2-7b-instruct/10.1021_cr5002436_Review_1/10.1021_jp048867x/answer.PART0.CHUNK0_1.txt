<p>The synthesis of Pt nanoparticles with narrow size distributions was achieved using various solution-based reduction methods. These particles were embedded into mesoporous SBA-15 silica using low-power sonication. After calcination and reduction, the catalysts were characterized by TEM, XRD, and selective chemisorption measurements.</p>
<p>The as-synthesized Pt particle size was unaffected by sonication, calcination, or reduction. However, particle sizes measured by selective chemisorption were larger on average.</p>
<p>Ethylene hydrogenation and ethane hydrogenolysis were used as test reactions to compare the activity of the Pt/SBA-15 catalysts with classical high-surface-area catalysts. Turnover rates for room-temperature hydrogenation of ethylene were identical to a Pt/SiO2 catalyst made by ion exchange and in good agreement with single-crystal measurements.</p>
<p>The Pt/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated weak structure sensitivity, with smaller particles showing higher activity.</p>
<p>The catalysts exhibited excellent thermal stability under relevant turnover conditions.</p>

The document discusses the synthesis and characterization of platinum nanoparticles embedded in mesoporous silica. The nanoparticles, with sizes ranging from 1.7 to 7.1 nm, were produced using alcohol reduction methods. They were incorporated into mesoporous SBA-15 silica via sonication, and then calcined and reduced to prepare catalysts. The catalysts were characterized using TEM, XRD, and chemisorption techniques. Ethylene hydrogenation and ethane hydrogenolysis were used as test reactions to compare the activity of the Pt/SBA-15 catalysts with conventional high-surface-area catalysts. The results showed that the structure of the catalysts had a weak influence on the activity for ethane hydrogenolysis, with smaller particles demonstrating higher activity. The catalysts also showed good thermal stability. This research provides a model system for studying structure-selectivity relationships in heterogeneous catalysis.

文档讨论了在介孔二氧化硅中嵌入铂纳米颗粒的合成和表征。这些尺寸在1.7到7.1 nm之间的纳米颗粒使用醇还原方法制备。它们通过超声波被整合到9纳米孔径的SBA-15二氧化硅中，然后经过煅烧和还原制备成催化剂。使用透射电子显微镜、X射线衍射和化学吸附技术对催化剂进行了表征。乙烯氢化和乙烷氢解作为测试反应，用于比较Pt/SBA-15催化剂与传统高比表面积催化剂的活性。结果表明，对于乙烷氢解，催化剂的结构对其活性影响较弱，小颗粒表现出更高的活性。催化剂还显示了良好的热稳定性。这项研究为研究异相催化中的结构选择性关系提供了一个模型系统。
