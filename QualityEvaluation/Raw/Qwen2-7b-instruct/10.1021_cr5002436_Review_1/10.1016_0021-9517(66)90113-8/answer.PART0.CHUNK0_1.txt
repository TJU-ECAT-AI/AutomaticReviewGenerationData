[1] "The present study thus concerns itself with the low-temperature (0C) hydrogenation of cyclopropane to propane, catalyzed by a platinum foil and by various platinum catalysts on three different supports differing vastly in the average particle size of the metal."
[2] "The difference in the two groups in their susceptibility to poisoning is, however, very marked. For the fresh catalysts well dispersed on alumina, the activity after oxygen treatment was only about one-hundredth of its original value."
[3] "It is remarkable that the turnover numbers on samples where almost every atom is a surface atom differ only by a factor of 2 from the turnover numbers on catalysts where bulk metal is clearly present."
[4] "It follows that a platinum surface exposed to oxygen around room temperature will be cleaned by hydrogen also around room temperature."

The study focuses on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclopropane to propane using platinum catalysts. Fresh catalysts with high dispersion on alumina show a significant decrease in activity after oxygen treatment, whereas the other catalysts are less susceptible to this effect. The turnover numbers for highly dispersed platinum catalysts are only slightly different from those with bulk metal presence. A platinum surface exposed to oxygen at room temperature can be cleaned by hydrogen at the same temperature.

研究关注的是在低温下用铂催化剂催化环丙烷氢化成丙烷的过程。高分散的铂催化剂在氧化铝上的新鲜催化剂，在氧气处理后其活性降低到原来的十分之一。相比之下，其他催化剂对这种影响的敏感性较低。高度分散的铂催化剂的周转数仅与具有明显块状金属的催化剂略有不同。暴露于室温氧气的铂表面可以在同一温度下通过氢气清洁。
