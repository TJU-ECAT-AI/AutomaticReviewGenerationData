[1] "The present study thus concerns itself with the low-temperature (0C) hydrogenation of cyclopropane to propane, catalyzed by a platinum foil and by various platinum catalysts on three different supports differing vastly in the average particle size of the metal."
[2] "The specific activity for hydrogenation of cyclopropane at 0C on platinum catalysts was found to be independent of platinum content on two different forms of alumina, independent of the nature of the support with alumina or silica gel, and almost the same for highly dispersed samples in which nearly every platinum atom is a surface atom as for a platinum foil."
[3] "The difference between the highly dispersed samples and the others (sintered, less dispersed, foil) was a modest twofold change in specific activity, while the platinum specific surface area varied by more than four orders of magnitude."
[4] "In contradistinction, a very marked susceptibility to oxygen poisoning was found for the well-dispersed catalysts that was not observed for the other samples."
[5] "It must be concluded that the observations of Boreskov et al. concerning the lack of sensitivity of the specific activity of platinum in the oxidation of sulfur oxide and hydrogen and (with one exception) in the hydrogen-deuterium exchange are confirmed and considerably strengthened by the present findings."

The study focused on the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclopropane using platinum foil and various platinum catalysts on different supports. The specific activity of hydrogenation was found to be independent of platinum content and support type. There was a modest twofold change in specific activity between highly dispersed samples and others, despite significant variations in platinum specific surface area. Well-dispersed catalysts showed a marked susceptibility to oxygen poisoning, which was not observed in other samples. The study confirmed and strengthened previous findings on the lack of sensitivity of platinum's specific activity in certain oxidation processes.

研究专注于在低温下用铂箔和不同支撑上的各种铂催化剂催化环丙烷氢化。特定活性与铂含量和支撑类型无关，高分散样品与其它样品之间的特定活性变化仅为两倍，尽管铂特定表面积变化超过四个数量级。高分散催化剂对氧气中毒表现出显著的敏感性，在其他样品中未观察到这种情况。研究证实并加强了关于铂在某些氧化过程中特定活性缺乏敏感性的先前发现。
