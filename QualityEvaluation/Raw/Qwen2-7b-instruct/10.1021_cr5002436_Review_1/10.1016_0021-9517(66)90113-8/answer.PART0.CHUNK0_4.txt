[1] "In view of the far-reaching significance of the findings of Boreskov et al., it was decided to extend their work by taking advantage of the extreme state of dispersion of platinum on q-alumina,a system which was not investigated by the Soviet workers."
[2] "From a large variety of studies involving selective chemisorption of hydrogen (6,7, 8), carbon monoxide (9), and benzene (10)) as well as the methods of electron microscopy (11), light scattering
(I,%?),
and X-ray diffraction line-broadening
(IS),
there is general agreement on the fact that almost every platinum atom in a fresh sam-ple is a surface atom and that if crystal- lites of platinum are present on the alumina surface after reduction of the catalyst, their size is certainly less t,han 35 A (IS) and probably less than 15 A (16)."
[3] "The present study thus concerns itself with the low-tempera- ture (0C) hydrogenation of cyclopropane to propane, catalyzed by a platinum foil and by various platinum catalysts on three different supports differing vastly in the average particle size of the metal."
[4] "The platinum-alumina system appears to be well-suited to a study of the specific activity of platinum since the very small aggregates dispersed on a fresh catalyst can be made to grow by heat treatment at increasingly higher temperatures until their size can be measured by X-ray diffraction line-broadening (6, 14, 15, 16)."
[5] "Further- more, in the region where the platinum particles are too small to be detected by physical methods, a measure of the plati- num surface area may now be obtained readily by a titration method consisting of selective hydrogen adsorption on a surface platinum oxide (17)."
[6] "The platinum foil used was 12.7 p in thickness. It was pretreated by being washed in benzene, etched in aqua regia,and washed in distilled water."
[7] "All rates reported were measured with an initial cyclopropane partial pressure of 10 torr and an initial hydrogen: cyclopropane ratio in the range 4.6:1 to 4.8:1."
[8] "Under the best conditions,the activity from run to run wit,h a new sample of the same catalyst was good. The arithmetic average activity for several runs is re-ported in Table 1 for each supported cata- lyst."
[9] "Thus,from the viewpoint of activity,there is a difference, by a factor of 2, be- tween the two groups, but this is an insig- nificant variation relative to the large change in dispersion, D. The difference in the two groups in their susceptibility to poisoning is, however, very marked."
[10] "Indeed, it is the first time tha,t the specific activity of the highly dispersed platinum-alumina system has been included in a study of this kind. It is remarkable that the turnover numbers on samples where almost every atom is a sur- face atom differ only by a factor of 2 from the turnover numbers on catalysts where bulk metal is clearly present."

1. This study focused on extending previous research by examining the extreme dispersion of platinum on q-alumina, a system not previously studied by the Soviet researchers. The platinum-alumina system was chosen for its ability to allow the growth of small platinum aggregates, enabling the measurement of platinum surface area by X-ray diffraction line-broadening. A key finding was that almost every platinum atom in a fresh sample is a surface atom, with crystallites present after reduction likely being less than 35 Å and possibly even less than 15 Å in size.

2. The study conducted hydrogenation tests at 0°C using various platinum catalysts on different supports, including q-alumina, alumina, silica gel, and a platinum foil. The catalysts' activity and surface area were measured under standardized conditions.

3. The study found a significant difference in activity between highly dispersed catalysts (where every atom is a surface atom) and others, with the highly dispersed catalysts showing a modest two-fold change in activity despite having a platinum surface area varying by more than four orders of magnitude compared to the others.

4. The specific activity of platinum, which refers to the number of reactant molecules converted per minute per catalytic site, was found to be remarkably insensitive to factors such as platinum content, support type, and preparation method. The study confirmed this consistency in activity across platinum-alumina systems, suggesting they are essentially reduced to the metal, despite the presence of crystallites that have evaded physical identification.

5. The results revealed that the activity of platinum catalysts is not expected to be generally consistent across different catalyst preparations. However, the study's findings suggest that the platinum-alumina system maintains almost the same specific activity as bulk platinum, indicating that these systems are intriguing for further testing of fundamental questions regarding catalytic activity.

1. 本研究聚焦于扩展先前的研究，通过考察铂在q氧化铝上的极端分散状态，这是一个之前苏联研究人员未涉及的系统。铂-氧化铝系统被选中，因为它允许小铂团簇的生长，可以通过X射线衍射线宽化测量铂表面面积。关键发现是，在新鲜样本中几乎每一个铂原子都是表面原子，还原后存在的晶粒可能小于35 Å，甚至可能小于15 Å。

2. 在0°C下，该研究对不同支持物（包括q氧化铝、氧化铝、硅胶和铂箔）上各种铂催化剂进行了氢化测试。在标准化条件下测量了催化剂的活性和表面面积。

3. 研究发现，高度分散的催化剂（其中每个原子都是表面原子）与其它催化剂之间存在显著差异，高度分散的催化剂的活性变化幅度为两倍，尽管它们的铂表面面积相对于其他催化剂变化了四个数量级。

4. 铂的特定活性，即每分钟每个催化位点转换的反应物分子数，被发现对铂含量、支持类型和制备方法等因素具有令人惊讶的稳定性。研究证实了这一点，铂-氧化铝系统的特定活动性几乎与纯铂相同，表明这些系统实际上已经还原为金属，尽管结晶体已经逃避了物理识别。

5. 结果显示，铂催化剂的活性并不预期一般情况下会在不同的催化剂准备方式中保持一致。然而，该研究的发现表明，铂-氧化铝系统在几乎所有原子都为表面原子的情况下保持几乎相同的特定活性，这表明这些系统对于进一步测试基本问题非常有趣，尤其是在金属晶体难以识别的情况下。
