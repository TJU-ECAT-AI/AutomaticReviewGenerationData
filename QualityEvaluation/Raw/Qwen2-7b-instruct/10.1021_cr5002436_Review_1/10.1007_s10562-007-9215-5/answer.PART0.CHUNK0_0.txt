[1] "The light paraffin dehydrogenation into olefins on supported metallic catalysts is accompanied by undesirable reactions that produce light products and carbon deposition."
[2] "The results above mentioned show that the Sn addition to Pt produces important modifications in the behavior of these catalysts in the butane dehydrogenation reaction."
[3] "These important modifications in the nature of the metallic function due to the simultaneous incorporation of Na and Sn to Pt/Al2O3 would be responsible for the excellent catalytic performance in the butane dehydrogenation."
[4] "The excellent stability of these bimetallic catalysts supported on Al2O3Na would be due to a low carbon formation during the reaction."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are effective in converting paraffins into olefins while minimizing the production of lighter products and carbon deposition. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are also used in this process. Recent developments in this field aim to improve the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts, reducing unwanted side reactions and enhancing the conversion of paraffins into olefins. Potential advantages of these catalysts include their ability to handle a variety of feedstocks, adaptability to different operating conditions, and potential for industrial-scale application in the petrochemical industry.
