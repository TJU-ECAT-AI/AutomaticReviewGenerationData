The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts are effective for this process due to their high reactivity and ability to facilitate dehydrogenation reactions. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, can also be used depending on the specific application. These catalysts have been developed for various industries, including petrochemical production, where they help convert paraffins to olefins.

Recent developments in this field include the introduction of novel catalyst formulations and the optimization of existing catalysts for improved efficiency and selectivity. The addition of alkali metals, like sodium (Na), to the catalyst supports can modify the structure of the catalysts, affecting both the acidic and metallic functions. This modification leads to significant improvements in the catalytic performance, enhancing the conversion rates, selectivities to butenes over 95%, and reducing deactivation capacity compared to traditional PtSn catalysts.

The combination of platinum and tin (Sn) in bimetallic catalysts, especially when supported on sodium-doped alumina, results in the formation of particles that include platinum-silver alloys and oxidized tin particles stabilized on the support. This complex structure leads to a catalyst with high dehydrogenation selectivity and low carbon formation, contributing to the catalyst's stability and efficiency.

The sodium addition to PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts introduces a complex effect that combines the poisoning of acidic sites with modifications in the metallic phase, resulting in improved catalytic performance. The excellent stability of these catalysts is attributed to the low carbon formation during the reaction, which further enhances their applicability in nonoxidative dehydrogenation processes.

In summary, the document highlights the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Recent advancements involve the development of optimized catalyst formulations, modifications to catalyst structures through alkali metal additions, and the creation of bimetallic catalysts that offer enhanced performance and stability in industrial applications.

文档讨论了贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂（Pt），和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。铂催化剂由于其高反应性和促进脱氢反应的能力，在此过程中非常有效。如铬酸盐（CrOx）、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼等金属氧化物催化剂根据具体应用的不同也可使用。这些催化剂已经在各个行业中得到发展，尤其是在石油化学生产中，帮助将烷烃转化为烯烃。

近年来，该领域的发展包括新型催化剂配方的引入和现有催化剂的优化，以提高效率和选择性。向催化剂支撑材料添加碱金属，如钠（Na），可以改变催化剂的结构，影响酸性和金属功能。这种修改导致催化性能显著改善，提高转化率，但选择性超过95%，并降低与传统PtSn催化剂相比的活性衰减能力。

铂和锡（Sn）在双金属催化剂中的结合，特别是在钠掺杂的氧化铝上，导致形成包含铂银合金和稳定在支撑物上的氧化锡颗粒的颗粒。这种复杂结构导致催化剂具有高脱氢选择性和低碳形成，进一步提高了催化剂的稳定性。

向PtSn/Al2O3催化剂中添加钠引入了一种复杂的效应，结合了对酸性位点的中毒与金属相的结构修改，从而导致催化性能的改善。这些催化剂的出色稳定性归因于反应期间低碳形成，这进一步增强了它们在非氧化脱氢过程中的适用性。

综上所述，文档强调了贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。近年来的发展涉及优化催化剂配方、通过碱金属添加修改催化剂结构以及创造提供增强性能和稳定性的双金属催化剂。
