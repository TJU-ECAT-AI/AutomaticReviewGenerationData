[1] "The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins."
[2] "In comparison, noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum exhibit high selectivity and activity in the dehydrogenation process, often achieving high conversions and selectivities to desired products."
[3] "Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, offer lower cost and wider availability, making them attractive for industrial applications."
[4] "Recent developments have focused on improving the stability, selectivity, and efficiency of these catalysts through various strategies, including the use of supports, additives, and modifying the catalyst composition."
[5] "Advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include their high activity, selectivity, and ability to operate under mild conditions, although they may be limited by cost and durability issues."
[6] "Metal oxide-based catalysts, while less expensive, may require higher temperatures and pressures, and might not achieve the same level of selectivity as noble metal catalysts."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, noble metal-based catalysts demonstrate high selectivity and activity, often achieving high conversions and selectivities to desired products. Metal oxide-based catalysts, offering lower cost and wider availability, are attractive for industrial applications. Recent developments focus on enhancing stability, selectivity, and efficiency through various strategies. Noble metal-based catalysts benefit from high activity, selectivity, and mild operating conditions, but face limitations in cost and durability. Metal oxide-based catalysts, while less expensive, may require higher temperatures and pressures and might not match the selectivity of noble metal catalysts.
