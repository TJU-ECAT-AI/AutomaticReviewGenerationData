In the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are utilized. The literature discusses the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalysts.

The platinum-based catalysts, like the silica-supported PtSn catalysts, are noted for their improved catalytic behavior when operated under high temperatures and without hydrogen addition. The impregnation method employed significantly influences the degree of interaction between platinum and tin (Sn), affecting the fraction of platinum that remains unalloyed after calcination and reduction. Co-impregnation methods were found to be superior to sequential methods in enhancing the degree of interaction between metals. The study also reveals that the fraction of unalloyed platinum rapidly deactivates under reaction conditions, impacting the turnover frequency (TOF) values derived from chemisorption measurements. 

The addition of tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) catalysts can significantly improve the catalytic behavior of Pt/SiO2 catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation under severe deactivating conditions. This improvement is attributed to the enhancement in selectivity and stability, likely due to the dilution of platinum ensembles by tin, reducing the activity towards reactions requiring large platinum ensembles. The literature also suggests that high-temperature treatments in air of previously reduced PtSn samples are detrimental to the catalytic properties, leading to an increase in the rate of deactivation due to coke formation.

In terms of recent developments, the study highlights the importance of choosing preparation methods that maximize the degree of PtSn interaction, rather than solely focusing on metal dispersion. The interaction between the active metal and the promoter plays a crucial role in determining the sustained activity of the catalyst. Moreover, the study underscores the potential of metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, emphasizing their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, and recent advancements.

The literature does not provide specific compositions or detailed industrial applications for the metal oxide-based catalysts. However, it does mention that these catalysts can be effective under certain conditions, highlighting their potential in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation. The recent developments in the field suggest ongoing research into improving the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts, as well as exploring novel materials and preparation techniques to enhance their performance.

In conclusion, the noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts have distinct roles and advantages in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. While platinum-based catalysts excel under specific conditions, such as high temperatures and without hydrogen addition, metal oxide catalysts offer alternative pathways for enhancing the dehydrogenation process. The literature emphasizes the importance of careful catalyst selection, preparation methods, and understanding the underlying mechanisms to optimize catalytic performance and achieve sustainable industrial applications.

在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域，特别是铂基催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）被广泛使用。文献讨论了这些催化剂的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新进展及其在该领域的潜在优势。

文献提到，在高温和无氢添加的情况下，使用二氧化硅支持的铂锡（PtSn）催化剂对异丁烷进行脱氢研究时，铂基催化剂表现出改进的催化行为。采用的浸渍方法对铂和锡（Sn）之间的相互作用程度以及经过煅烧和还原过程后未合金化的铂比例产生了显著影响。共浸渍方法被发现明显优于顺序浸渍方法，提高了金属间相互作用的程度。研究还揭示，在反应条件下，大量未合金化的铂迅速失活，影响了基于吸附测量的转速频率（TOF）值。

文献表明，通过添加锡（Sn）到铂（Pt）催化剂中，可以显著提高二氧化硅支持的Pt催化剂对异丁烷脱氢的催化行为，特别是在严重失活条件下，温度为500°C且不添加氢气。这种改进归因于增强的选择性和稳定性，可能是由于通过锡稀释铂簇减少了需要大量铂簇构成活性位点的反应的活性，从而降低了氢解和焦炭形成等不希望发生的反应的速率。文献还指出，对先前还原的PtSn样品进行高温度空气处理对催化剂性能有害，导致焦炭形成速率大幅增加。

关于最近的发展，文献强调选择能够最大化铂锡相互作用的制备方法的重要性，而不仅仅是关注金属分散度。铂锡相互作用的强度决定了催化剂的持续活性。此外，文献突出了金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在非氧化脱氢领域的潜力，提到了它们的组成、有效性、工业应用和最新进展。

文献没有提供具体组成或详细工业应用的信息。然而，它确实提到了这些催化剂在特定条件下的有效性，并强调了它们在非氧化脱氢领域的潜在应用。最新的发展表明，正在进行持续的研究，以提高这些催化剂的效率和选择性，并探索新材料和制备技术来增强其性能。

总之，铂基催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域具有不同的角色和优势。虽然铂基催化剂在特定条件下表现良好，但金属氧化物催化剂提供了改进脱氢过程的替代途径。文献强调了仔细选择催化剂、制备方法以及理解基本机制的重要性，以优化催化性能并实现可持续的工业应用。
