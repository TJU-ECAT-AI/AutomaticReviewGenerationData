Noble metal-based catalysts, primarily platinum, palladium, and rhodium, are widely used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts exhibit excellent reactivity and selectivity. Metal oxide catalysts, including chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been applied in this field. Recent advancements focus on enhancing catalyst stability, activity, and energy efficiency. While metal oxide catalysts are often more affordable and adaptable for specific uses, they may have lower activity and selectivity compared to noble metals. Incorporating metal oxides with noble metals or creating new oxide compositions could improve catalytic systems for nonoxidative dehydrogenation.
