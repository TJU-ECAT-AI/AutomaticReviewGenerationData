[1] "The promoting effect of Sn strongly depends on the method employed in the preparation. Catalysts prepared by co-impregnation, particularly when the solvent is an aqueous solution containing HCl, result in a high extent of PtSn interaction."
[2] "Sequential impregnation results in a large fraction of unalloyed Pt. When H2 is not added to the feed, this fraction of unalloyed Pt rapidly deactivates."
[3] "High-temperature treatments in air of previously reduced PtSn samples are detrimental for the catalytic properties. After these treatments, the rate of deactivation due to coke formation greatly increases."
[4] "CO and hydrogen adsorption does not take place to a great extent on the PtSn alloys, the small amount measured occurs mostly on unalloyed Pt."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the literature highlights several key points:

1. The effectiveness of using tin (Sn) as a promoter in platinum-based catalysts significantly depends on the preparation method. Specifically, co-impregnation, especially when utilizing an aqueous solution with hydrochloric acid, yields a high degree of interaction between platinum and tin. This results in a more effective catalyst. Conversely, sequential impregnation tends to produce a substantial fraction of unalloyed platinum, which rapidly deactivates in the absence of hydrogen in the feed.

2. In selecting a preparation method, maximizing the degree of platinum-tin interaction is crucial over maximizing metal dispersion. The fraction of alloyed platinum is the determinant factor for sustained activity in these catalysts.

3. High-temperature treatments in air following reduction of platinum-tin catalysts can significantly deteriorate their catalytic properties. Post-treatments result in a substantial increase in the rate of deactivation due to coke formation. The literature suggests that this effect is attributed to the disruption of the platinum-tin alloy structure.

4. The adsorption of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) does not occur extensively on platinum-tin alloys. The small quantity measured mainly takes place on unalloyed platinum, which rapidly deactivates in the absence of hydrogen-added feed.

These findings underscore the importance of preparation methods, the role of tin as a promoter, and the potential drawbacks of high-temperature treatments on the catalytic properties of platinum-tin catalysts. The literature emphasizes the need for careful consideration of these factors when developing and applying catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的过程中，使用贵金属催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂之间的比较揭示了一些关键点：

1. 锡（Sn）作为铂基催化剂的促进剂的效果主要取决于制备方法。特别是使用含盐酸的水溶液进行共浸渍时，铂与锡之间的相互作用程度较高。这导致更有效的催化剂。相比之下，顺序浸渍方法倾向于产生大量未合金化的铂，而未添加氢气的喂料中，这一部分未合金化的铂会迅速失活。

2. 在选择制备方法时，应优先考虑最大化铂锡之间的相互作用，而不是最大分散度。合金化铂的比例是这些催化剂保持持续活性的关键因素。

3. 高温空气处理对先前还原的铂锡催化剂有害。这些处理后，由于焦炭形成速率的大幅增加，催化性能急剧下降。文献指出，这种效果归因于合金结构的破坏。

4. 一氧化碳（CO）和氢（H2）的吸附在铂锡合金上并不广泛发生。测量的少量主要发生在未合金化的铂上，在不添加氢气的喂料中，这部分铂会迅速失活。

这些发现强调了准备方法、锡作为促进剂的作用以及高温处理对铂锡催化剂催化性质潜在负面影响的重要性。文献强调在开发和应用用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的催化剂时需要仔细考虑这些因素。
