[1] "Recent increases in demand of light olefins for the production of polymers and gasoline additives such as MTBE have increased the interest in lower alkane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The conditions best suited for this reaction, high temperatures, low pressures, and low hydrogen concentrations, favor rapid deactivation due to coke formation on the catalyst."
[3] "It is postulated that such thermal treatments lead to the disruption of the PtSn alloys causing an increase in the fraction of unalloyed surface Pt."
[4] "The rapid deactivation of unalloyed Pt is particularly important in the absence of added hydrogen."
[5] "The addition of promoters, such as Sn, to Pt catalysts enhances their catalytic ability for dehydrogenation."
[6] "One explanation for the enhanced properties of the promoted catalysts is the formation of alloys between the Pt and the Sn which reduces the size of Pt ensembles."
[7] "Even though Sn is one of the most efficient promoters employed in commercial processes, deactivation due to coke formation is not completely eliminated and the catalysts still exhibit short lifetimes and must undergo continuous or frequent regenerations to maintain activity."

Non-noble metal-based catalysts, particularly metal oxides, are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. They include CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. These catalysts are effective in dehydrogenation reactions due to their ability to facilitate the breaking of alkane bonds at high temperatures. Industrial applications often utilize these catalysts for producing polymers and gasoline additives such as MTBE. However, these catalysts suffer from short lifetimes and require frequent regenerations due to coke formation. Promoters like tin (Sn) enhance the catalytic ability of noble metal-based catalysts like platinum (Pt) by forming alloys with them. These alloys reduce the size of Pt ensembles, decreasing coke formation and increasing selectivity. Despite improvements, deactivation remains a challenge, necessitating ongoing research for more durable and efficient catalysts.

非贵金属催化剂，尤其是金属氧化物，用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。它们包括CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物。这些催化剂由于能够在高温下促进烷烃键的断裂而有效。工业应用常利用这些催化剂生产聚合物和汽油添加剂如MTBE。然而，这些催化剂寿命短且需要频繁再生以防止焦炭形成。锡（Sn）等促进剂增强了贵金属基催化剂（如铂（Pt））的催化能力，通过与它们形成合金来提高它们的性能。这些合金减少了铂簇的大小，减少了焦炭形成并提高了选择性。尽管有所改进，但脱活仍然是一个挑战，需要持续的研究以开发更耐用和高效的催化剂。
