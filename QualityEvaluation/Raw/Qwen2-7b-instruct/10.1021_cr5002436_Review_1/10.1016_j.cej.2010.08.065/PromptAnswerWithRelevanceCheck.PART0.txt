<quotes>
<p>It was found that the different preparation conditions lead to different catalytic performances. For both catalysts, the activity decreases by increasing calcination and reduction temperatures, whereas the effect on the selectivity is not uniform. For the 1%Pd0.3%Cu (wt.%) catalyst, the nitrate conversion after 5 h of reaction varies from 93% (sample calcined at 200 C and not reduced) to 25% (sample calcined and reduced at 400 C).</p>
<p>The formation of alloys during the preparation of the catalysts is prejudicial for nitrate reduction. In all the preparation conditions tested the PdCu pair is more selective for the transformation of nitrate into nitrogen.</p>
<p>The contact with hydrogen in water has an important effect on the catalytic activity. This contact allows an in situ reduction of the noble metal.</p>
</quotes>

The study highlights that the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts, specifically PdCu and PtCu, supported on activated carbon for nitrate reduction varies with preparation conditions. Specifically, increasing calcination and reduction temperatures leads to a decrease in activity, while the impact on selectivity is inconsistent. The 1%Pd0.3%Cu catalyst demonstrates a nitrate conversion ranging from 93% to 25% across different preparation conditions. Formation of alloys during preparation negatively affects nitrate reduction efficiency. The PdCu pair exhibits greater selectivity for transforming nitrate into nitrogen compared to PtCu. Contact with hydrogen in water facilitates an in situ reduction of noble metals, enhancing catalytic activity. Optimal preparation conditions are 200°C calcination and 100°C reduction for achieving reasonable activity and high selectivity to nitrogen.

研究发现，用于硝酸盐还原的双金属催化剂（特别是钯铜和铂铜）在不同制备条件下的催化性能存在差异。提高焙烧和还原温度会导致活性下降，而选择性的影响不一致。1%钯0.3%铜催化剂的硝酸盐转化率在不同的制备条件下从93%变化到25%。合金形成在催化剂制备过程中会降低硝酸盐还原效率。钯铜组合对于将硝酸盐转化为氮气的选择性高于铂铜。与水中的氢接触能够实现原位还原贵金属，增强催化活性。最优制备条件为200°C焙烧和100°C还原，以达到合理的活性和高氮选择性。

[1] "The results obtained in this work show that the reduction of nitrate is quite different depending on the supported metal and the preparation conditions. For the catalysts tested, the activity decreases with the increase of calcination and reduction temperatures, whereas the effect on the selectivity is not uniform."
[2] "The formation of alloys during the preparation of the catalysts is prejudicial for nitrate reduction."
[3] "Taking into consideration the selectivity to nitrogen, the performance of the catalysts is maximised at low calcination and reduction temperatures. The calcination at 200 C and reduction at 100 C seem to be the optimal temperatures to activate the catalysts, when both the activity and nitrogen selectivity are considered."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (like Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the document focuses on the catalytic behavior of noble metal catalysts supported on activated carbon for nitrate reduction. It highlights that the reduction of nitrate activity decreases with the increase of calcination and reduction temperatures, while the effect on selectivity varies among different catalyst preparations. The document suggests that the formation of alloys during catalyst preparation negatively impacts nitrate reduction efficiency. It also indicates that optimizing calcination at 200°C and reduction at 100°C yields the best performance, balancing activity and nitrogen selectivity for catalysts used in nitrate reduction processes.

[1] "The formation of alloys during the preparation of the catalysts is prejudicial for nitrate reduction."
[2] "Among them, PdCu, PdSn and PtCu seem to correspond to the most effective, but are still inadequate in terms of selectivity to nitrogen."
[3] "The activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalyst are highly dependent on the interaction between the metals, and this can be controlled by the preparation method, the nature of the promoter, the metal/promoter ratio and the operation conditions."
[4] "All the samples have been characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 196 C, CO adsorption microcalorimetry, TPR, XRD, XPS and TEM."
[5] "In the present work, the influence of different calcination and reduction temperatures on the catalytic behaviour of acti- vated carbon supported PdCu and PtCu bimetallic catalysts in the hydrogen-mediated reduction of nitrates in water has been studied."
[6] "The contact with hydrogen in water has an important effect on the catalytic activity. This contact allows an in situ reduction of the noble metal."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically focusing on PdCu, PdSn, and PtCu pairs, for the reduction of nitrates in water. These catalysts show high efficiency but lack adequate selectivity towards nitrogen. The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the preparation conditions, including the calcination and reduction temperatures. The study reveals that higher calcination and reduction temperatures lead to the formation of larger metal particles and/or alloys, which negatively impact the catalytic activity. The contact of hydrogen with the catalyst in water facilitates in situ reduction of the noble metal, enhancing its activity. The optimal conditions for catalyst activation are found to be calcination at 200°C and reduction at 100°C, which maximize both activity and nitrogen selectivity. This is attributed to the prevention of alloy formation and better control of metal dispersion at these temperatures.

The study compared the activity and selectivity of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically focusing on Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The research found that the performance of the catalysts varied significantly based on the supported metal and preparation conditions. Specifically, the activity of the catalysts decreased with an increase in calcination and reduction temperatures. This was attributed to the formation of larger metal particles and alloys at high temperatures. In contrast, the effect on selectivity was not uniform across all catalysts. The study highlighted that the contact with hydrogen in water played a crucial role in the catalytic activity, enabling in situ reduction of the noble metal. Optimal conditions for maximizing the performance of the catalysts were found to be a calcination temperature of 200°C and a reduction temperature of 100°C, when considering both activity and selectivity to nitrogen. These conditions were deemed to be the most effective for activating the catalysts.

本研究对比了用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物基催化剂的性能。研究发现，催化剂的性能在支持的金属和制备条件上存在显著差异。具体而言，随着焙烧和还原温度的升高，催化剂的活性降低。这是由于高温下形成了较大的金属颗粒和合金。相比之下，选择性受不同催化剂的影响不一。研究强调了水合氢与催化剂接触的重要性，它能实现原位还原贵金属。在考虑氮的选择性时，催化性能最大化是在200°C的焙烧温度和100°C的还原温度下。这些条件被认为是同时考虑活性和氮选择性时最有效的催化剂激活条件。
