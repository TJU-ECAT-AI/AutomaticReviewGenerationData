[1] "The results obtained in this work show that the reduction of nitrate is quite different depending on the supported metal and the preparation conditions. For the catalysts tested, the activity decreases with the increase of calcination and reduction temperatures, whereas the effect on the selectivity is not uniform."
[2] "The formation of alloys during the preparation of the catalysts is prejudicial for nitrate reduction."
[3] "Taking into consideration the selectivity to nitrogen, the performance of the catalysts is maximised at low calcination and reduction temperatures. The calcination at 200 C and reduction at 100 C seem to be the optimal temperatures to activate the catalysts, when both the activity and nitrogen selectivity are considered."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (like Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the document focuses on the catalytic behavior of noble metal catalysts supported on activated carbon for nitrate reduction. It highlights that the reduction of nitrate activity decreases with the increase of calcination and reduction temperatures, while the effect on selectivity varies among different catalyst preparations. The document suggests that the formation of alloys during catalyst preparation negatively impacts nitrate reduction efficiency. It also indicates that optimizing calcination at 200°C and reduction at 100°C yields the best performance, balancing activity and nitrogen selectivity for catalysts used in nitrate reduction processes.

比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物），文献主要讨论了在硝酸盐还原中，以活性炭为载体的贵金属催化剂的表现。它指出，随着煅烧和还原温度的升高，硝酸盐还原活性降低，而选择性受制备条件的影响不一。文献表明，合金的形成对硝酸盐还原效率产生不利影响。此外，文献表明，在保证活性与氮选择性的情况下，将煅烧温度设置为200°C和还原温度设置为100°C是最佳的催化剂激活条件。
