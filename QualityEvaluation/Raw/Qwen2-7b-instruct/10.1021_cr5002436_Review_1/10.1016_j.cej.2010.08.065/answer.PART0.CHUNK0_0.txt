<p>It was found that the different preparation conditions lead to different catalytic performances. For both catalysts, the activity decreases by increasing calcination and reduction temperatures, whereas the effect on the selectivity is not uniform. For the 1%Pd0.3%Cu (wt.%) catalyst, the nitrate conversion after 5 h of reaction varies from 93% (sample calcined at 200 C and not reduced) to 25% (sample calcined and reduced at 400 C).</p>
<p>The formation of alloys during the preparation of the catalysts is prejudicial for nitrate reduction. In all the preparation conditions tested the PdCu pair is more selective for the transformation of nitrate into nitrogen.</p>
<p>The contact with hydrogen in water has an important effect on the catalytic activity. This contact allows an in situ reduction of the noble metal.</p>

The study highlights that the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts, specifically PdCu and PtCu, supported on activated carbon for nitrate reduction varies with preparation conditions. Specifically, increasing calcination and reduction temperatures leads to a decrease in activity, while the impact on selectivity is inconsistent. The 1%Pd0.3%Cu catalyst demonstrates a nitrate conversion ranging from 93% to 25% across different preparation conditions. Formation of alloys during preparation negatively affects nitrate reduction efficiency. The PdCu pair exhibits greater selectivity for transforming nitrate into nitrogen compared to PtCu. Contact with hydrogen in water facilitates an in situ reduction of noble metals, enhancing catalytic activity. Optimal preparation conditions are 200°C calcination and 100°C reduction for achieving reasonable activity and high selectivity to nitrogen.

研究发现，用于硝酸盐还原的双金属催化剂（特别是钯铜和铂铜）在不同制备条件下的催化性能存在差异。提高焙烧和还原温度会导致活性下降，而选择性的影响不一致。1%钯0.3%铜催化剂的硝酸盐转化率在不同的制备条件下从93%变化到25%。合金形成在催化剂制备过程中会降低硝酸盐还原效率。钯铜组合对于将硝酸盐转化为氮气的选择性高于铂铜。与水中的氢接触能够实现原位还原贵金属，增强催化活性。最优制备条件为200°C焙烧和100°C还原，以达到合理的活性和高氮选择性。
