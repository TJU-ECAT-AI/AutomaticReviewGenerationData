[1] "The formation of alloys during the preparation of the catalysts is prejudicial for nitrate reduction."
[2] "Among them, PdCu, PdSn and PtCu seem to correspond to the most effective, but are still inadequate in terms of selectivity to nitrogen."
[3] "The activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalyst are highly dependent on the interaction between the metals, and this can be controlled by the preparation method, the nature of the promoter, the metal/promoter ratio and the operation conditions."
[4] "All the samples have been characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 196 C, CO adsorption microcalorimetry, TPR, XRD, XPS and TEM."
[5] "In the present work, the influence of different calcination and reduction temperatures on the catalytic behaviour of acti- vated carbon supported PdCu and PtCu bimetallic catalysts in the hydrogen-mediated reduction of nitrates in water has been studied."
[6] "The contact with hydrogen in water has an important effect on the catalytic activity. This contact allows an in situ reduction of the noble metal."
[7] "Taking into consideration the selectivity to nitrogen, the performance of the catalysts is maximised at low calcination and reduction temperatures."
[8] "The calcination at 200 C and reduction at 100 C seem to be the optimal temperatures to activate the catalysts, when both the activity and nitrogen selectivity are considered."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically focusing on PdCu, PdSn, and PtCu pairs, for the reduction of nitrates in water. These catalysts show high efficiency but lack adequate selectivity towards nitrogen. The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the preparation conditions, including the calcination and reduction temperatures. The study reveals that higher calcination and reduction temperatures lead to the formation of larger metal particles and/or alloys, which negatively impact the catalytic activity. The contact of hydrogen with the catalyst in water facilitates in situ reduction of the noble metal, enhancing its activity. The optimal conditions for catalyst activation are found to be calcination at 200°C and reduction at 100°C, which maximize both activity and nitrogen selectivity. This is attributed to the prevention of alloy formation and better control of metal dispersion at these temperatures.

文档讨论了用于水介质中硝酸盐还原的贵金属基催化剂，特别是PdCu、PdSn和PtCu这对，它们表现出高效率但氮选择性不足。这些催化剂的性能受制备条件显著影响，包括煅烧和还原温度。研究表明，较高的煅烧和还原温度会导致更大颗粒的金属形成或合金化，这会负面影响催化活性。氢与催化剂在水中的接触促进了贵金属的原位还原，从而增强其活性。催化剂激活的理想条件被发现是200°C煅烧和100°C还原，这能同时最大化活性和氮选择性。这是由于在这些温度下避免合金形成并更好地控制金属分散所导致的。
