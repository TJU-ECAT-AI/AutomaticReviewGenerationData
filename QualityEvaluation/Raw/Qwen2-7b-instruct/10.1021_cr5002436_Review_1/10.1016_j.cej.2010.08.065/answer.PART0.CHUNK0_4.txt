[1] "The results obtained in this work show that the reduction of nitrate is quite different depending on the supported metal and the preparation conditions. For the catalysts tested, the activity decreases with the increase of calcination and reduction temperatures, whereas the effect on the selectivity is not uniform. The calcination and reduction at high temperatures are inadequate due to the formation of larger metal particles and/or alloys. The contact with hydrogen in water has an important effect on the catalytic activity. This contact allows an in situ reduction of the noble metal. Taking into consideration the selectivity to nitrogen, the performance of the catalysts is maximised at low calcination and reduction temperatures. The calcination at 200 C and reduction at 100 C seem to be the optimal temperatures to activate the catalysts, when both the activity and nitrogen selectivity are considered."

The study compared the activity and selectivity of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically focusing on Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The research found that the performance of the catalysts varied significantly based on the supported metal and preparation conditions. Specifically, the activity of the catalysts decreased with an increase in calcination and reduction temperatures. This was attributed to the formation of larger metal particles and alloys at high temperatures. In contrast, the effect on selectivity was not uniform across all catalysts. The study highlighted that the contact with hydrogen in water played a crucial role in the catalytic activity, enabling in situ reduction of the noble metal. Optimal conditions for maximizing the performance of the catalysts were found to be a calcination temperature of 200°C and a reduction temperature of 100°C, when considering both activity and selectivity to nitrogen. These conditions were deemed to be the most effective for activating the catalysts.

本研究对比了用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，以及金属氧化物基催化剂的性能。研究发现，催化剂的性能在支持的金属和制备条件上存在显著差异。具体而言，随着焙烧和还原温度的升高，催化剂的活性降低。这是由于高温下形成了较大的金属颗粒和合金。相比之下，选择性受不同催化剂的影响不一。研究强调了水合氢与催化剂接触的重要性，它能实现原位还原贵金属。在考虑氮的选择性时，催化性能最大化是在200°C的焙烧温度和100°C的还原温度下。这些条件被认为是同时考虑活性和氮选择性时最有效的催化剂激活条件。
