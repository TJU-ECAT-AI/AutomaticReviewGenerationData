[1] "The main characteristics of those solids are hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance and very low surface acidity, which are well suited to perform in the severe conditions imposed by dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes."
[2] "Those properties make them interesting as carriers for noble metals to substitute the more traditional Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts."
[3] "Renard and Free1 [5] have shown that platinum supported on magnesium aluminates is more resistant to sintering due to regeneration by oxidative procedures than the Pt/Al2O, and Pt/SiO, systems."
[4] "For low metal contents, the results suggest that platinum diffuses into the oxygen vacancies in the spine1 lattice while at higher loadings, metal-metal interactions are dominant, leading to particle formation."
[5] "The catalytic behavior points to the necessity of strong Pt-H interactions to preserve activity."

Noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, offer unique advantages in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins compared to metal oxide-based catalysts. Noble metals, especially Platinum, are known for their exceptional catalytic activity and stability under harsh conditions. They are particularly effective due to their ability to form strong interactions with hydrogen, which aids in preserving activity. In contrast, metal oxides like Chromium Oxide (CrOx), Gallium, Indium, Vanadium, Zinc, and Molybdenum Oxides, are typically less active and may require higher operating temperatures and pressures. Their effectiveness is often limited by the risk of sintering, which leads to a loss of surface area and decreased catalytic efficiency. The industrial application of these catalysts depends on the specific reaction conditions, desired product yield, and the cost-effectiveness of production. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst stability, increasing activity, and reducing environmental impact through the use of noble metals like Platinum, combined with optimized support materials. The potential advantage of noble metal-based catalysts lies in their superior performance, stability, and ability to maintain activity over longer periods, making them ideal for commercial-scale applications in industries requiring efficient and selective dehydrogenation processes.
