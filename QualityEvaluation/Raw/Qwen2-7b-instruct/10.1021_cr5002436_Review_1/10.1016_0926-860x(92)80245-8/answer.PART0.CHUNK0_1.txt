<p>For low metal contents, the results suggest that platinum diffuses into the oxygen vacancies in the spine1 lattice while at higher loadings, metal-metal interactions are dominant, leading to particle formation.</p>
<p>The catalytic behaviour points to the necessity of strong Pt-H interactions to preserve activity.</p>
<p>Results on catalytic conversion of isobutane are condensed in Fig. 5 and Table 2. When hydrogen is used instead of helium as diluent, turn over frequency (TOF) numbers are higher and reach a maximum for a platinum concentration around 0.5 wt.-%. In contrast, in helium the activity decreases continuously as metal concentration increases.</p>
<p>When the hydrogen-isobutane mixture is used, selectivity attains the highest values (97%) remaining constant for platinum loadings higher than 0.5 wt.-%. When helium instead of hydrogen is used, hydrogen evolving from the reaction is not sufficient to transform all the platinum present to a Pt-H species, remaining platinum would promote cracking of the isobutane molecule.</p>
<p>Catalytic experiments on isobutane dehydrogenation point out that hydrogen as reaction medium is very important to achieve high activity and selectivity.</p>

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts typically exhibit higher activity and selectivity when hydrogen is used as the reaction medium. This is because hydrogen promotes strong Pt-H interactions, which are crucial for maintaining activity. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, might not perform as efficiently under the same conditions, especially when using helium as the diluent. The effectiveness of these catalysts varies based on their composition, with noble metals generally offering superior performance. Industrial applications of these catalysts include petrochemical processes, such as the production of ethylene and propylene from naphtha. Recent developments focus on improving catalyst stability and activity through optimized synthesis methods and support materials. The key advantage of noble metal-based catalysts lies in their ability to facilitate desired chemical transformations with high efficiency and selectivity, particularly in hydrogen-rich environments.

在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中，特别是铂基催化剂和CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂被广泛使用。当使用氢气作为反应介质时，铂基催化剂通常表现出更高的活性和选择性。这是因为氢气能够促进铂-氢键的强相互作用，这对于维持活性至关重要。金属氧化物催化剂在同样的条件下可能表现得不如铂基催化剂高效，尤其是在使用氦气作为稀释剂的情况下。这些催化剂的有效性取决于它们的组成，其中贵金属通常提供更好的性能。这些催化剂在工业中的应用包括石油化学过程，如从石脑油生产乙烯和丙烯。最近的发展集中在通过优化合成方法和支撑材料来提高催化剂的稳定性和活性。铂基催化剂的主要优势在于它们能够在高效率和选择性下促进所需的化学转变，特别是在富含氢气的环境中。
