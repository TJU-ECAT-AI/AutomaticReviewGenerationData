[1] "The main characteristics of those solids are hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance, and very low surface acidity, which are well suited to perform in the severe conditions imposed by dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes."
[2] "For low metal contents, the results suggest that platinum diffuses into the oxygen vacancies in the spine1 lattice while at higher loadings, metal-metal interactions are dominant, leading to particle formation."
[3] "The catalytic behaviour points to the necessity of strong Pt-H interactions to preserve activity."
[4] "Results on catalytic conversion of isobutane are condensed in Fig. 5 and Table 2. When hydrogen is used instead of helium as diluent, turn over frequency (TOF) numbers are higher and reach a maximum for a platinum concentration around 0.5 wt.-%."
[5] "Deactivation is more important in helium atmosphere than in hydrogen; in fact, deactivation constants (&) obtained by means of a first order parallel deactivation model are always greater when catalysts are tested in helium."

The study focuses on the characterization and catalytic properties of platinum supported on zinc aluminate for isobutane dehydrogenation. The key findings include the observation that at low metal contents, platinum diffuses into the oxygen vacancies in the spinel lattice, while at higher loadings, metal-metal interactions lead to particle formation. Strong Pt-H interactions are crucial for maintaining activity. Using hydrogen as the reaction medium leads to higher turnover frequency and selectivity, especially at a platinum concentration around 0.5 wt.-%. Deactivation is more pronounced in helium atmospheres compared to hydrogen atmospheres.

该研究专注于锌铝酸盐支持的铂在异丁烷脱氢反应中的表征和催化性质。关键发现包括：在低金属含量下，铂扩散到晶格氧空位中；而在较高负载下，金属间相互作用导致粒子形成。强Pt-H相互作用对于保持活性至关重要。使用氢气作为反应介质可以得到更高的周转频率和选择性，尤其是在铂含量约为0.5 wt.-%时。在氦气气氛下的失活比氢气气氛更为明显。
