<p>In the search for improved properties of dehydrogenation catalysts, great interest has been focused on spine1 type structures like magnesium and zinc aluminates.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of those solids are hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance, and very low surface acidity, which are well suited to perform in the severe conditions imposed by dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes.</p>
<p>Some of the fundamental aspects like metal-support interaction and selectivity of the Pt/ZnAIPO1 catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation leading to C, alkenes were tackled in this work.</p>
<p>Results on catalytic conversion of isobutane are condensed in Fig. 5 and Table 2. When hydrogen is used instead of helium as diluent, turn over frequency (TOF ) numbers are higher and reach a maximum for a platinum concentration around 0.5 wt.-%.</p>
<p>In contrast, in helium the activity decreases continuously as metal concentration increases.</p>
<p>Concerning selectivity, the undesirable reaction observed was cracking of isobutane to propene and methane.</p>
<p>When the hydrogen-isobutane mixture is used, selectivity attains the highest values (97%) remaining constant for platinum loadings higher than 0.5 wt.-%.</p>
<p>When helium instead of hydrogen is used, hydrogen evolving from the reaction is not sufficient to transform all the platinum present to a Pt-H species, remaining platinum would promote cracking of the isobutane molecule.</p>
<p>The higher activity and selectivity values found when hydrogen is the reaction medium suggest that the interaction Pt-H plays an important role.</p>

The study focuses on the platinum-supported zinc aluminate catalysts for the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The catalysts were characterized using techniques such as temperature-programmed reduction, hydrogen chemisorption, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and tested for isobutane dehydrogenation using helium or hydrogen as the reaction medium. For low metal contents, the results suggest that platinum diffuses into the oxygen vacancies in the spine1 lattice. At higher loadings, metal-metal interactions lead to particle formation. The catalytic behavior indicates the necessity of strong Pt-H interactions to preserve activity. The results show that hydrogen as the reaction medium leads to higher activity and selectivity, suggesting an important role of the Pt-H interaction. The study also highlights the importance of the metal-support interaction, explaining how zinc aluminate prevents metal sintering.

该研究关注铂支持的锌铝酸盐催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢。使用了如温度程序还原、氢化学吸附、高分辨率透射电子显微镜、电子能量损失光谱等技术对催化剂进行了表征，并测试了在氦气或氢气作为反应介质下异丁烷脱氢的情况。对于低金属含量，结果表明铂扩散到脊状结构中的氧空位中。在较高负载量下，金属间相互作用导致颗粒形成。催化行为指出，保持活性需要强Pt-H相互作用。结果显示，当使用氢气作为反应介质时，活动性和选择性更高，这表明Pt-H相互作用起着重要作用。研究还强调了金属-载体相互作用的重要性，解释了为什么锌铝酸盐能够防止金属烧结。
