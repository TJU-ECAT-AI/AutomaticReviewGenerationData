<p>“In the search for improved properties of dehydrogenation catalysts, great interest has been focused on spine1 type structures like magnesium and zinc aluminates [l-5]. The main characteristics of those solids are hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance and very low surface acidity, which are well suited to perform in the severe conditions imposed by dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes [31.”</p>
<p>“The aim of this work is to contribute with a multi-technique characterization of the Pt/ZnAlzOl system, including high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), hydrogen chemisorption (HC) and catalytic performance.”</p>
<p>“Results on catalytic conversion of isobutane are condensed in Fig. 5 and Table 2. When hydrogen is used instead of helium as diluent, turn over frequency (TOF) numbers are higher and reach a maximum for a platinum concentration around 0.5 wt.-%.”</p>
<p>“When helium instead of hydrogen is used, hydrogen evolving from the reaction is not sufficient to transform all the platinum present to a Pt-H species, remaining platinum would promote cracking of the isobutane molecule.”</p>
<p>“The higher activity and selectivity values found when hydrogen is the reaction medium suggest that the interaction Pt-H plays an important role.”</p>
<p>“Catalytic experiments on isobutane dehydrogenation point out that hydrogen as reaction medium is very important to achieve high activity and selectivity.”</p>

The study focuses on the characterization of Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions. The key differences between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are not explicitly discussed in the provided text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that noble metal-based catalysts like Pt offer superior activity and selectivity, especially when hydrogen is used as a reaction medium. Metal oxide-based catalysts may not perform as efficiently under the same conditions. The Pt/ZnAl2O4 system demonstrates high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation, with the best results observed at a platinum loading of around 0.5 wt.-% when hydrogen is used. The presence of hydrogen facilitates the formation of Pt-H interactions, which are crucial for maintaining activity and selectivity. The use of helium as a reaction medium leads to lower activity and selectivity, likely due to insufficient hydrogen generation for Pt-H interaction. The study highlights the importance of the Pt-H interaction in achieving high catalytic performance for dehydrogenation reactions.

该研究专注于Pt/ZnAl2O4催化剂在脱氢反应中的表征。关于贵金属基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）之间的主要差异并未明确讨论。然而，根据上下文可以推断，贵金属基催化剂如Pt在活性和选择性方面表现出色，尤其是在使用氢气作为反应介质时。金属氧化物基催化剂可能在相同的条件下效率较低。Pt/ZnAl2O4系统在异丁烷脱氢化反应中展现出高活性和选择性，最佳结果出现在氢气为反应介质且铂负载量约为0.5 wt.%时。氢气的存在促进了Pt-H相互作用，这对于维持活性和选择性至关重要。当使用氦气作为反应介质时，活性和选择性较低，这可能是由于氢生成不足导致Pt-H相互作用不足所致。研究强调了Pt-H相互作用在实现脱氢反应高催化性能中的重要性。
