[1] "Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography."
[2] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[3] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[4] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."

Numerical methods are being used to solve the structures of materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles. Researchers have developed a computational technique that constructs cluster structures atom by atom using high-resolution diffraction data, specifically atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs). This method has been applied to deduce the structure of buckyballs (C60), and while it closely matches the experimental data, slight deviations occur due to noise and experimental limitations.

对于缺乏长程有序性的材料（如纳米颗粒），正在使用数值方法来解决其结构问题。研究人员开发了一种计算技术，该技术通过使用高分辨率衍射数据（具体为原子对分布函数PDF）逐个构建簇结构。这种方法已被应用于推导出富勒烯（C60）的结构，尽管它与实验数据的匹配度很高，但由于噪声和实验限制，计算得到的结构与理想结构略有偏差。
