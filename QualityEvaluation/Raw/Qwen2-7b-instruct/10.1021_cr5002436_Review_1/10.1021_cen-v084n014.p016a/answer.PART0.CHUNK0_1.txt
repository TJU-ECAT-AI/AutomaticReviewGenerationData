Numerical methods are emerging as a solution for determining the atomic structures of materials lacking long-range order, particularly nanoparticles and aperiodic solids. These methods rely on computational algorithms and data such as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. An example of this is the Liga method, which was applied to determine the structure of buckyballs (C60) by comparing computer-generated models with experimental PDF data obtained from solid-phase neutron scattering. This approach enables structures to be solved with subangstrom resolution even when traditional crystallographic methods fail.

对于缺乏长程有序的材料，如纳米颗粒和无定形固体，数值方法正在成为确定其原子结构的一种解决方案。这些方法依赖于计算算法和从X射线和中子衍射研究中获得的数据，如原子对分布函数（PDF）。Liga方法就是一个例子，它被用来通过比较计算机生成的模型与从球状物（C60）固体相中散射实验获得的PDF数据，来确定Buckyball（C60）的结构。这种方法即使在传统晶体学方法失败时也能实现亚埃分辨率的结构解析。
