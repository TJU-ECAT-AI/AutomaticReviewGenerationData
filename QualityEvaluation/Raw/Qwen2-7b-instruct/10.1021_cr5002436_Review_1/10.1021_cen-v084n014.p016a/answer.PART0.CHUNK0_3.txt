[1] "Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography."
[2] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[3] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[4] "Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs."
[5] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."
[6] "The new approach to solving these materials' structures could be widely applicable."

1. The document does not provide specific details about noble metal-based catalysts (like Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It focuses on a computational technique for building up cluster structures of aperiodic materials, particularly C60 buckyballs, using atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. This method, named Liga, is aimed at solving the structures of materials that lack long-range order, which is a challenge for traditional crystallography methods.

2. The document discusses a computational technique developed for deducing the atomic structure of aperiodic materials, specifically C60 buckyballs, using data obtained from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. The method uses atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) to build up structures one atom at a time, comparing distances from computer-generated clusters with experimental data. The technique involves an iterative process inspired by the rules of promotion and relegation in European soccer leagues, where theoretical clusters are ranked based on their agreement with experimental data. The method was successfully applied to C60, matching experimental data closely but showing slight deviations from the ideal structure due to noise and experimental limitations.

3. The document highlights the potential applicability of the developed computational technique to a wide range of aperiodic materials, suggesting that it could be widely useful for solving the structures of such materials, which is a significant advancement in the field of materials science, particularly for nanoscale materials that lack long-range order.

1. 文档没有提供关于用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的具体细节。它关注的是用于构建无序材料（如Buckyball C60）结构的计算技术，使用X射线和中子衍射研究粉末和其他非晶态样品获得的数据。该方法，称为Liga，旨在解决缺乏长程有序的材料的结构问题，这超出了传统晶体学方法的可能性。

2. 文档讨论了一种用于推断无序材料（特别是C60 Buckyball）原子结构的计算技术，使用从X射线和中子衍射研究固体相样本获得的数据。该方法利用原子对分布函数（PDFs）逐个构建结构，并将计算机生成的簇的距离与实验数据进行比较。该过程涉及一个迭代过程，灵感来源于欧洲足球联赛中的升降级规则，理论簇根据与实验数据的一致性排名。该方法成功应用于C60，其计算数据集与实验测量结果高度吻合，但显示出轻微偏离理想结构，原因在于数据噪音和实验限制。

3. 文档强调了开发的计算技术在广泛无序材料中的潜在适用性，表明它可能对解决此类材料的结构具有重大意义，特别是在纳米尺度材料领域，这些材料缺乏长程秩序。
