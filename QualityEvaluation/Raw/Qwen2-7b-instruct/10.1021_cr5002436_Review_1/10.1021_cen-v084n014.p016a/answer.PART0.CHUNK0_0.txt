[1] "Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography."
[2] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[3] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[4] "Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs."
[5] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."
[6] "Aperiodic materials are among the technologically most interesting nanoscale materials currently under study. The new approach to solving these materials' structures could be widely applicable."

The document does not provide specific details about noble metal-based catalysts (such as Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It focuses on a computational method developed for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials, which might be relevant to understanding the structure of catalysts in a broader context. However, there is no direct comparison or discussion about the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalyst types within the provided literature.

文档没有提供关于用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的具体细节。它侧重于为确定非晶材料的原子结构开发的一种计算方法，这可能与理解催化剂结构在更广泛背景下的相关性有关。然而，该文献中没有直接比较或讨论这些催化剂类型的具体组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势。
