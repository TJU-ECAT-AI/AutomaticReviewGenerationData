Numerical methods are emerging as a solution for determining the atomic structures of materials lacking long-range order, particularly nanoparticles and aperiodic solids. These methods rely on computational algorithms and data such as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. An example of this is the Liga method, which was applied to determine the structure of buckyballs (C60) by comparing computer-generated models with experimental PDF data obtained from solid-phase neutron scattering. This approach enables structures to be solved with subangstrom resolution even when traditional crystallographic methods fail.

Numerical methods are being used to solve the structures of materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles. Researchers have developed a computational technique that constructs cluster structures atom by atom using high-resolution diffraction data, specifically atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs). This method has been applied to deduce the structure of buckyballs (C60), and while it closely matches the experimental data, slight deviations occur due to noise and experimental limitations.

1. The document does not provide specific details about noble metal-based catalysts (like Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It focuses on a computational technique for building up cluster structures of aperiodic materials, particularly C60 buckyballs, using atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. This method, named Liga, is aimed at solving the structures of materials that lack long-range order, which is a challenge for traditional crystallography methods.

2. The document discusses a computational technique developed for deducing the atomic structure of aperiodic materials, specifically C60 buckyballs, using data obtained from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. The method uses atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) to build up structures one atom at a time, comparing distances from computer-generated clusters with experimental data. The technique involves an iterative process inspired by the rules of promotion and relegation in European soccer leagues, where theoretical clusters are ranked based on their agreement with experimental data. The method was successfully applied to C60, matching experimental data closely but showing slight deviations from the ideal structure due to noise and experimental limitations.

3. The document highlights the potential applicability of the developed computational technique to a wide range of aperiodic materials, suggesting that it could be widely useful for solving the structures of such materials, which is a significant advancement in the field of materials science, particularly for nanoscale materials that lack long-range order.
