[1] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[2] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[3] "To build up structures, the algorithm 'positions' a small number of atoms in a cluster and then compares the distance list derived from the computer-generated cluster with an experimentally measured list."
[4] "Distance values obtained from other computer-generated clusters of the same size are also compared with the experimental data."
[5] "The theoretical cluster that matches the experimental data most closely 'wins' that round and is promoted to the next level, where structures of clusters with one additional atom are once again ranked according to the closeness of the match with experimental data."
[6] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."
[7] "The new approach to solving these materials' structures could be widely applicable."

Numerical methods have been developed to determine the atomic structures of aperiodic materials. These methods utilize atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and noncrystalline samples. The algorithm positions a small number of atoms in a cluster and compares the derived distance list with experimental data. Structures of clusters with additional atoms are ranked based on their similarity to experimental data. Despite slight deviations from ideal structures due to data noise and limitations, this computational technique can match experimental results closely and has the potential for wide applicability in solving materials' structures.

已经开发出了数值方法来确定非周期性材料的原子结构。这些方法利用了从粉末和非晶样品的X射线和中子衍射研究中得到的原子对分布函数（PDF）。算法将一小部分原子放置在一个簇中，并将生成簇的获得的距离列表与实验数据进行比较。对于具有额外原子的簇，根据与实验数据的相似性重新排名结构。尽管由于数据噪声和限制，与理想结构相比存在细微偏差，但这种计算技术能够紧密匹配实验结果，并且在解决材料结构方面具有广泛的应用潜力。
