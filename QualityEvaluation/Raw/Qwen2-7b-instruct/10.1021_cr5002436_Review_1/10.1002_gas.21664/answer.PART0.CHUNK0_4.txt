[1] "The sky was falling and some were even predicting brief periods for natural gas prices equal to zero, as oil producers would not even find places to store their associated natural gas."
[2] "That zero did not happen, nor did gas prices break the buck, but they did find their way below the two-dollar mark."
[3] "As you can clearly see in [Exhibit 1], the coal switching equation is incredibly sensitive and tightly correlated to natural gas pricing."
[4] "With what is hoped to be the end of last year's miserable conditionswarmest winter ever and a huge inventory glutRaymond James believes that the market in 2013 is well positioned for sharply higher natural gas prices (and gas to coal switching) this winter."
[5] "Nevertheless, if Morgan Stanley's theory is correct that in 2013 and beyond, natural gas will retain 2.1 billion cubic feet a day of the 4.2 that it gained, even with higher natural gas prices, then electric generation should still remain the preeminent use of natural gas for the near future."
[6] "Shale gas has again shaken things up such that there is a new paradigm in the natural gas and electricity industry."
[7] "At 26 billion cubic feet a day, electric generation uses 39 percent of natural gas; the second place now goes to residential/commercial with 19.3 billion cubic feet a day, which is 28 percent of the total."

The literature discusses the expectations for natural gas prices and usage in the coming years, particularly focusing on the impact of shale gas and the shift in natural gas demand from coal to gas for electricity generation. It highlights that the market is anticipated to experience sharply higher natural gas prices due to various factors such as weather, production levels, and demand from residential and commercial sectors. The text also mentions the role of shale gas in changing the paradigm of natural gas demand, with electric generation now being the largest consumer of natural gas, followed by residential and commercial uses. The document further predicts that natural gas will retain a significant portion of the gains made against coal in electricity generation, despite higher prices, for the near future.

文献讨论了未来几年天然气价格和使用情况的预期，特别是天然气需求从煤炭转向天然气的转变影响。它强调市场可能经历天然气价格的大幅上涨，原因包括天气、生产水平和住宅及商业领域的需求等因素。文本还提到页岩气在改变天然气需求模式中的作用，电力生成现在成为天然气的最大消费者，其次是住宅和商业用途。文件进一步预测，即使价格较高，天然气仍将在未来一段时间内保留与煤炭竞争后获得的大部分份额，在电力生成中占据主导地位。
