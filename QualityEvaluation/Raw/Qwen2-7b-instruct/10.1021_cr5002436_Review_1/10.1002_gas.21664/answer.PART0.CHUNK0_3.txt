Now what?

COAL-TO-GAS SWITCHING STILL ON THE LIST

Last year, with prices dropping so low, generators were abandoning coal as much as they could, given that many had long-term contracts for coal and switching to gas. As it was foreseen at the time, subsequently with lower incentives to drill wells, supply decreased, and gas prices rose again. Now the analysts say that we should be heading back toward more coal and are even predicting a rally in gas prices (see Exhibits 1 and 2).

Weak Gas Prices Increase Gas Demand

What is interesting about these data is the 95 percent strength of the correlation, which implies that coal-to-gas switching has outweighed even weather as a determinant of natural gas prices or at least it has in a black swan environment such as the one that industry has found itself in.

Morgan Stanley, Others Cite Switching but Also Other Factors

One, already mentioned, was weather. Expect continued emphasis on oil, rather than gas, drilling. The economics are just better, and producers will likely direct their efforts in that direction. With still fewer gas wells drilled, gas prices could be pushed up.

Growing effect of industrial demand is a positive for prices. At these lower prices, natural gas as a feedstock seems to be growing. Noticing a recent uptick, Morgan Stanley said, While we are aware that one data point doesn't make a trend, it is possible that the industrial sector is becoming more gas-intensive (i.e., consuming more gas per unit of output).

THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN

Because of all the fuel switching, what was definitely a second- or third-place runner in the natural gas demand picture, use as a fuel for electricity generation, is now definitely the big dog in the room.

The document discusses the future of natural gas prices and the impact of coal-to-gas switching on the market. It suggests that as gas prices drop, generators tend to switch from coal to gas due to the lower costs. However, with reduced incentives to drill new wells, gas supplies decrease, causing prices to rise again. Analysts predict a shift back towards more coal usage and an increase in gas prices. The document also highlights the strong correlation between coal-to-gas switching and natural gas prices, indicating that switching has significantly influenced prices over a 'black swan' event period. Additionally, factors such as increased industrial demand for natural gas, higher oil drilling activities, and weather conditions are mentioned as influencing gas prices. Lastly, it notes that the use of natural gas in electricity generation has become the leading consumer of natural gas in the United States.

文档讨论了天然气价格的未来以及煤炭到天然气转换对市场的影响。它指出，随着天然气价格下跌，由于成本更低，发电厂倾向于从煤炭转向天然气。然而，在钻探新井的激励减少后，天然气供应量下降，导致价格上涨。分析师预测煤炭使用量会增加，并且天然气价格会上涨。文档还强调了煤炭到天然气转换与天然气价格之间的强烈相关性，表明在“黑天鹅”事件期间，转换对价格影响显著。此外，提到的因素包括天然气在工业领域的需求增加、石油勘探活动增多以及天气条件，这些都影响着天然气价格。最后，它指出美国天然气消费的主要领域已转变为用于发电。
