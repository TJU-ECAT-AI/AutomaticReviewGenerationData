Silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt, Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation were studied.
Highly selective dehydrogenation catalysts were prepared by depositing Pt and Sn on K-L-zeolite, as well as by depositing Pt, Sn, and K on silica.
At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibited significantly higher rates of isobutene production compared to the Pt/Sn/K/ silica catalyst.
Addition of Sn and K to Pt decreased the extent of carbon deposition on the catalysts by reducing the size of the Pt surface ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species that lead to coke and other undesirable products.
The presence of Sn may also facilitate the transport of the carbon deposits from the active sites to the support.
In the absence of hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L-zeolite become blocked by carbonaceous deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K.
At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit deactivation due to coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles.
The addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn produces a highly selective isobutane dehydrogenation catalyst.
However, at 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, Pt/Sn/K/silica exhibited significantly lower isobutene production rates compared to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts.
At 798 K and in the absence of hydrogen, the addition of Sn and K to supported Pt catalysts improves the resistance of these catalysts to coking.
Both additives decrease the size of the Pt surface ensembles, thereby suppressing the hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions.
The presence of Sn may also help to transport coke from the active sites to the support.
In the absence of hydrogen, the Pt/K-L catalyst deactivates to essentially zero activity within several minutes on-stream. Carbonaceous deposits block the pores and limit access to the active sites.
In the presence of hydrogen, isobutane conversion is maintained by the Pt/K-L catalyst but the selectivity to isobutene is low.

This study focused on the development of noble metal-based (specifically Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt, Pt/Sn, and Pt/Sn/K catalysts were found to be highly selective for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene at high temperatures, particularly at 873 K with hydrogen present. The addition of tin and potassium to the Pt catalysts reduced the extent of carbon deposition by decreasing the size of the Pt surface ensembles, which inhibited the formation of coke and other undesired products. In the absence of hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L zeolite became blocked by carbonaceous deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K. The Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibited deactivation due to coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles at 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen. The addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn produced a highly selective catalyst for isobutane dehydrogenation. However, at 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K/silica catalysts showed significantly lower isobutene production rates compared to the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts. At 798 K and in the absence of hydrogen, the addition of tin and potassium to the supported Pt catalysts improved resistance to coking. Both tin and potassium reduced the size of the Pt surface ensembles, suppressing hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions. The presence of tin also helped to transport coke from active sites to the support. In the absence of hydrogen, the Pt/K-L catalyst deactivated to near-zero activity within minutes, with carbonaceous deposits blocking pores and limiting access to active sites. However, in the presence of hydrogen, isobutane conversion was maintained by the Pt/K-L catalyst, albeit with low selectivity towards isobutene production.

本研究主要关注了用于轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂的开发。二氧化硅和L沸石支持的铂、铂锡和铂锡钾催化剂在873 K下，特别是在氢气存在下，显示出高选择性将异丁烷转化为异丁烯。向铂催化剂中添加锡和钾减少了碳沉积的程度，通过减小铂表面簇的大小，抑制了形成导致焦炭和其他不希望产物的过度脱氢表面物种。在没有氢气的情况下，878 K下，铂/钾-沸石的孔隙被碳化物沉积物堵塞。在873 K下，特别是在氢气存在下，铂/锡/钾-沸石催化剂由于焦炭形成、表面锡富集和/或金属颗粒团聚而表现出失活。添加钾到二氧化硅支持的铂/锡催化剂上生产了一种高度选择性的异丁烷脱氢催化剂。然而，在873 K下，特别是在氢气存在下，铂/锡/钾/二氧化硅催化剂的异丁烯生产率显著低于铂/锡/钾-沸石催化剂。在798 K下，特别是在没有氢气的情况下，添加锡和钾到支持的铂催化剂上改善了这些催化剂对焦炭形成的抵抗力。两者都减小了铂表面簇的大小，抑制了氢解、异构化和焦炭形成反应。锡的存在也可能帮助将焦炭从活性位点运输到支撑。在没有氢气的情况下，铂/钾-沸石催化剂在几分钟内失活至几乎零活性。碳化物沉积物阻塞了孔隙并限制了对活性位点的访问。然而，在氢气存在下，铂/钾-沸石催化剂维持了异丁烷转化，但异丁烯的选择性较低。
