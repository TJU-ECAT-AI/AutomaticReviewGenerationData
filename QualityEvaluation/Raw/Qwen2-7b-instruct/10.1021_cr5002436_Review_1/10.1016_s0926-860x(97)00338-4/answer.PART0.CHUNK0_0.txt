Silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt, Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation Josephine M. Hill, R.D. Cortright, J.A. Dumesic* Department of Chemical Engineering, University of WisconsinMadison, Madison, WI 53706, USA Received 26 August 1997; received in revised form 31 October 1997; accepted 2 November 1997 Abstract Reaction kinetics measurements, temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), transmission electron microscopy, and chemisorption measurements were used to study silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K in pure isobutane and at 873 K with a 2 : 1 hydrogen : isobutane feed. Highly selective dehydrogenation catalysts were prepared by depositing Pt and Sn on K-L-zeolite, as well as by depositing Pt, Sn, and K on silica. At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibited significantly higher rates of isobutene production compared to the Pt/Sn/K/ silica catalyst. Addition of Sn and K to Pt decreased the extent of carbon deposition on the catalysts by reducing the size of the Pt surface ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species that lead to coke and other undesirable products (e.g. hydrogenolysis). The presence of Sn may also facilitate the transport of the carbon deposits from the active sites to the support. In the absence of hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L-zeolite become blocked by carbonaceous deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K. At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit deactivation due to coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles.

Answer: The study focuses on the development of catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation using silica- and L-zeolite-supported platinum (Pt), platinum with tin (Pt/Sn), and platinum with tin and potassium (Pt/Sn/K) catalysts. These catalysts are effective for selective dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene at temperatures below 773 K, especially in the presence of hydrogen. The addition of tin and potassium to the Pt catalysts reduces the extent of carbon deposition on the catalysts, inhibiting the formation of coke and other undesirable products. Tin may also aid in transporting carbon deposits from the active sites to the support. Without hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L-zeolite become blocked by carbonaceous deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K. At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit deactivation due to coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles.

该研究专注于开发用于异丁烷脱氢的催化剂，使用二氧化硅和L沸石支持的铂（Pt）、含锡的铂（Pt/Sn）以及含锡和钾的铂（Pt/Sn/K）。这些催化剂在低于773 K的温度下，尤其是有氢存在时，对异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯具有高度选择性。向铂催化剂中添加锡和钾减少了催化剂上的碳沉积，抑制了焦炭和其他不希望的产品（例如氢解产物）的形成。锡可能也有助于将碳沉积物从活性位点运输到支撑体上。没有氢的情况下，在798 K时异丁烷脱氢期间，Pt/K-L沸石的孔隙被碳沉积物堵塞。在873 K和有氢存在的条件下，Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂由于焦炭形成、表面锡富集和/或金属颗粒熔化而发生失活。
