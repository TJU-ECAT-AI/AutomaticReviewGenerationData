Silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt, Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation Josephine M. Hill, R.D. Cortright, J.A. Dumesic* Department of Chemical Engineering, University of WisconsinMadison, Madison, WI 53706, USA Received 26 August 1997; received in revised form 31 October 1997; accepted 2 November 1997

At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibited significantly higher rates of isobutene production compared to the Pt/Sn/K/ silica catalyst.

The presence of Sn may also facilitate the transport of the carbon deposits from the active sites to the support.

In the absence of hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L zeolite become blocked by carbonaceous deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K.

At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit deactivation due to coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles.

The addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn produces a highly selective isobutane dehydrogenation catalyst.

The addition of Sn and K to supported Pt catalysts improves the resistance of these catalysts to coking.

Both additives decrease the size of the Pt surface ensembles, thereby suppressing the hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coking reactions.

The presence of Sn may also help to transport coke from the active sites to the support.

In the absence of hydrogen, the Pt/K-L catalyst deactivates to essentially zero activity within several minutes on-stream. Carbonaceous deposits block the pores and limit access to the active sites.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the former typically offer higher selectivity and stability at elevated temperatures, making them preferable for selective dehydrogenation processes. Platinum-based catalysts, especially when supported on zeolites or silica, exhibit superior performance in isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. Metal oxide catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, may offer different advantages depending on their specific composition and application. For instance, metal oxides can be cheaper alternatives and may have broader temperature ranges of operation. Recent developments focus on improving the stability, selectivity, and activity of both types of catalysts, often through the incorporation of additional metals or modifiers like tin and potassium. These additives can help in reducing the extent of carbon deposition, enhancing the size of metal surface ensembles, and facilitating the transport of carbon deposits, thereby improving overall catalytic performance. In the absence of hydrogen, the Pt/K-L catalyst faces rapid deactivation due to carbonaceous deposits blocking the pores and limiting access to active sites. However, in the presence of hydrogen, these catalysts maintain activity but exhibit low selectivity for isobutene production.

比较贵金属催化剂（如铂）与金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域的应用，贵金属催化剂通常在高温下展现出更高的选择性和稳定性，使其成为选择性脱氢过程的理想选择。当铂基催化剂支持在沸石或硅胶上时，它们在异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯方面的表现尤为出色。金属氧化物催化剂，包括CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，根据其特定组成和应用可能提供不同的优势。例如，金属氧化物可以是更便宜的替代品，并且可能具有更宽的操作温度范围。最近的发展集中在提高两种类型催化剂的稳定性和活性，往往通过引入其他金属或添加剂如锡和钾来实现。这些添加剂有助于减少碳沉积的量，增加金属表面团簇的大小，并促进碳沉积物从活性位点向载体的运输，从而改善整体催化性能。在没有氢的情况下，Pt/K-L催化剂由于碳沉积物堵塞孔道并限制对活性位点的访问而面临快速失活。然而，在氢的存在下，这些催化剂保持活性，但异丁烯产率的选择性较低。
