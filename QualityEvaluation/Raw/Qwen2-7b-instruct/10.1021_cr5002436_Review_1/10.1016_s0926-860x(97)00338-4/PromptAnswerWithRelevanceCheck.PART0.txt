Silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt, Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation Josephine M. Hill, R.D. Cortright, J.A. Dumesic* Department of Chemical Engineering, University of WisconsinMadison, Madison, WI 53706, USA Received 26 August 1997; received in revised form 31 October 1997; accepted 2 November 1997 Abstract Reaction kinetics measurements, temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), transmission electron microscopy, and chemisorption measurements were used to study silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K in pure isobutane and at 873 K with a 2 : 1 hydrogen : isobutane feed. Highly selective dehydrogenation catalysts were prepared by depositing Pt and Sn on K-L-zeolite, as well as by depositing Pt, Sn, and K on silica. At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibited significantly higher rates of isobutene production compared to the Pt/Sn/K/ silica catalyst. Addition of Sn and K to Pt decreased the extent of carbon deposition on the catalysts by reducing the size of the Pt surface ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species that lead to coke and other undesirable products (e.g. hydrogenolysis). The presence of Sn may also facilitate the transport of the carbon deposits from the active sites to the support. In the absence of hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L-zeolite become blocked by carbonaceous deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K. At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit deactivation due to coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles.

Answer: The study focuses on the development of catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation using silica- and L-zeolite-supported platinum (Pt), platinum with tin (Pt/Sn), and platinum with tin and potassium (Pt/Sn/K) catalysts. These catalysts are effective for selective dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene at temperatures below 773 K, especially in the presence of hydrogen. The addition of tin and potassium to the Pt catalysts reduces the extent of carbon deposition on the catalysts, inhibiting the formation of coke and other undesirable products. Tin may also aid in transporting carbon deposits from the active sites to the support. Without hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L-zeolite become blocked by carbonaceous deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K. At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit deactivation due to coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles.

该研究专注于开发用于异丁烷脱氢的催化剂，使用二氧化硅和L沸石支持的铂（Pt）、含锡的铂（Pt/Sn）以及含锡和钾的铂（Pt/Sn/K）。这些催化剂在低于773 K的温度下，尤其是有氢存在时，对异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯具有高度选择性。向铂催化剂中添加锡和钾减少了催化剂上的碳沉积，抑制了焦炭和其他不希望的产品（例如氢解产物）的形成。锡可能也有助于将碳沉积物从活性位点运输到支撑体上。没有氢的情况下，在798 K时异丁烷脱氢期间，Pt/K-L沸石的孔隙被碳沉积物堵塞。在873 K和有氢存在的条件下，Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂由于焦炭形成、表面锡富集和/或金属颗粒熔化而发生失活。

Comparing the noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find that:

1. Platinum-based catalysts, especially when supported on L-zeolite, exhibit high selectivity and stability for isobutane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Addition of tin and potassium reduces the extent of carbon deposition by decreasing the size of the platinum surface ensembles, inhibiting the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species that lead to coke and other unwanted products. 

2. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, can also be effective for dehydrogenation processes. Their effectiveness varies depending on factors such as composition, industrial application, and recent developments. For instance, they might offer different stability profiles, selectivity towards specific products, or enhanced activity under certain conditions.

3. Recent developments in the field aim to optimize catalyst performance by improving stability, enhancing selectivity, and reducing deactivation rates. This includes the design of new supports, modification of existing catalyst components, and the creation of hybrid systems that combine the benefits of noble metals with those of metal oxides.

4. Industrial applications of these catalysts typically involve the production of higher-value olefinic products such as propene and isobutene from lighter paraffins. The choice of catalyst depends on the desired product distribution, process conditions, and cost considerations.

5. The potential advantages of these catalysts include higher yields, better selectivity, improved stability, and reduced environmental impact. Research continues to explore new catalyst designs and operating conditions to maximize these benefits.

In summary, noble metal-based catalysts like platinum, especially when combined with tin and potassium, show promise in isobutane dehydrogenation. Metal oxide-based catalysts also play a role, offering alternatives with distinct properties. Advances in catalyst design and process optimization aim to enhance efficiency and sustainability in olefin production processes.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts like Platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the former typically offer higher selectivity and stability at elevated temperatures, making them preferable for selective dehydrogenation processes. Platinum-based catalysts, especially when supported on zeolites or silica, exhibit superior performance in isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. Metal oxide catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, may offer different advantages depending on their specific composition and application. For instance, metal oxides can be cheaper alternatives and may have broader temperature ranges of operation. Recent developments focus on improving the stability, selectivity, and activity of both types of catalysts, often through the incorporation of additional metals or modifiers like tin and potassium. These additives can help in reducing the extent of carbon deposition, enhancing the size of metal surface ensembles, and facilitating the transport of carbon deposits, thereby improving overall catalytic performance. In the absence of hydrogen, the Pt/K-L catalyst faces rapid deactivation due to carbonaceous deposits blocking the pores and limiting access to active sites. However, in the presence of hydrogen, these catalysts maintain activity but exhibit low selectivity for isobutene production.

比较贵金属催化剂（如铂）与金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域的应用，贵金属催化剂通常在高温下展现出更高的选择性和稳定性，使其成为选择性脱氢过程的理想选择。当铂基催化剂支持在沸石或硅胶上时，它们在异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯方面的表现尤为出色。金属氧化物催化剂，包括CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，根据其特定组成和应用可能提供不同的优势。例如，金属氧化物可以是更便宜的替代品，并且可能具有更宽的操作温度范围。最近的发展集中在提高两种类型催化剂的稳定性和活性，往往通过引入其他金属或添加剂如锡和钾来实现。这些添加剂有助于减少碳沉积的量，增加金属表面团簇的大小，并促进碳沉积物从活性位点向载体的运输，从而改善整体催化性能。在没有氢的情况下，Pt/K-L催化剂由于碳沉积物堵塞孔道并限制对活性位点的访问而面临快速失活。然而，在氢的存在下，这些催化剂保持活性，但异丁烯产率的选择性较低。
