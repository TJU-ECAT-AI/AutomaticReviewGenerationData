[1] "Supporting tin and platinum in K-L-zeolite produces catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation that exhibit high dehydrogenation selectivity to isobutene at high isobutane conversions at 873 K in the presence of hydrogen and at 798 K with a pure isobutane feed."
[2] "The addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn produces a highly selective isobutane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[3] "However, at 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, Pt/Sn/K/silica exhibited signicantly lower isobutene production rates compared to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts."
[4] "At 798 K and in the absence of hydrogen, the addition of Sn and K to supported Pt catalysts improves the resistance of these catalysts to coking."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum-based catalysts, when supported in K-L zeolite, demonstrate high selectivity for isobutene production at high isobutane conversions at 873 K in hydrogen presence and at 798 K with pure isobutane feed. Metal oxide-based catalysts, especially when combined with tin and potassium, enhance the selectivity of isobutane dehydrogenation. 

2. In the presence of hydrogen, Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit significantly higher isobutene production rates compared to Pt/Sn/K/silica catalysts.

3. At 798 K without hydrogen, the addition of tin and potassium to supported platinum catalysts improves the catalysts' resistance to coking.

4. Metal oxide catalysts, particularly those containing tin and potassium, offer improved performance in the absence of hydrogen, demonstrating enhanced selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation compared to noble metal-based catalysts.

1. 钯基催化剂，尤其是钯，和金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中被使用。在873K下有氢存在或798K纯异丁烷喂料时，钯基催化剂在K-L沸石支持下表现出对异丁烯的高选择性。当锡和钾结合使用时，金属氧化物催化剂增强异丁烷脱氢的选择性。

2. 在有氢的情况下，K-L支持的Pt/Sn/K催化剂的异丁烯生成速率明显高于SiO2支持的Pt/Sn/K催化剂。

3. 在没有氢的798K下，含锡和钾的钯基催化剂提高了催化剂抵抗焦化的性能。

4. 含有锡和钾的金属氧化物催化剂在没有氢的情况下表现出改善的性能，相对于贵金属基催化剂提供了更好的异丁烷脱氢选择性。
