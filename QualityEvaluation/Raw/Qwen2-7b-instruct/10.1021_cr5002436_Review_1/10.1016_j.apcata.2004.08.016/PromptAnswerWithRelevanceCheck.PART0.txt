[1] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 leads to an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene)."
[2] "Besides, the bimetallic catalysts also show a good stability through the five successive reaction-regeneration cycles, mainly the PtSn/MgAl2O4 one."
[3] "The nature of the metallic phase in monometallic samples appears to be different for the two supports."
[4] "In fact, results would indicate not only a partial formation of PtSn alloys or intermetallic compounds between Pt0 and a fraction of Sn(0), but also a surface enrichment in Sn, dilution effects as well as the presence of tin stabilized on the support, probably as Sn(II/IV) oxides and SnCl2 species."
[5] "It can be concluded that the presence of Sn in the vicinity of Pt would produce a decrease both in the size of the Pt ensembles and the Ptolefin interaction strength, by geometric and electronic effects."
[6] "Therefore, once the olefin is formed (from the paraffin dehydrogenation) it is immediately desorbed, avoiding the formation of the coke precursors by a further dehydrogenation reaction on the bimetallic catalyst."

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The primary focus is on the PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 for n-butane dehydrogenation. These catalysts show improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. The Sn addition enhances the catalytic performance by modifying the structure of the metallic phase, leading to increased selectivity to olefins and reduced carbon deposition. The nature of the metallic phase differs between catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4, with Sn stabilizing on the support in the form of Sn(II/IV) oxides and SnCl2 species. The PtSn catalysts demonstrate good stability through successive reaction-regeneration cycles, with the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst showing particularly high stability. The presence of Sn in the vicinity of Pt results in a decrease in the size of Pt ensembles and the interaction strength between Pt and olefins, facilitating the immediate desorption of olefins and reducing coke precursor formation. This leads to enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity and lower carbon deposition, improving the overall catalytic performance of the bimetallic catalysts.

文献主要探讨了铂基贵金属催化剂和CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌、钼等金属氧化物在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。重点介绍了ZnAl2O4和MgAl2O4支持的PtSn催化剂用于n-丁烷脱氢的情况。这些催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面优于单金属催化剂。Sn的添加提高了催化性能，通过改变金属相的结构，导致对烯烃的选择性增加，并减少了碳沉积。支持在ZnAl2O4和MgAl2O4上的金属相性质不同，Sn在支持体上以Sn(II/IV)氧化物和SnCl2物种稳定。PtSn催化剂显示出良好的再生循环稳定性，尤其是PtSn/MgAl2O4催化剂的稳定性更高。Sn在Pt附近的存在导致Pt簇尺寸减小和Pt与烯烃之间的相互作用强度降低，使得烯烃立即脱附，减少焦炭前体的形成。这提高了脱氢选择性并降低了碳沉积，从而改善了双金属催化剂的整体催化性能。

1. The addition of tin to platinum catalysts on zinc aluminate and magnesium aluminate enhances their activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, resulting in high selectivity to various butenes. The catalysts show low deactivation parameters and slightly higher yields to all butenes when using 0.3 wt.% tin compared to 0.5 wt.% tin.

2. The structure of the metallic phase in the platinum-zinc aluminate catalyst differs from that in the platinum-magnesium aluminate catalyst. In the former, the particles exhibit a low hydrogenolysis capacity, while the latter displays a significant concentration of hydrogenolysis centers.

3. The addition of tin to platinum-based catalysts modifies the structure of the metallic phase. Tin's increased reducibility might occur through the catalytic action of platinum or the simultaneous reduction of both metals, potentially forming alloys.

4. The presence of tin next to platinum reduces the size of the platinum ensembles and weakens the interaction between the olefin and the metal surface, likely due to geometric and electronic effects.

5. The introduction of tin to the platinum catalysts decreases the size of the platinum clusters and the strength of olefin-metal interactions, facilitating easier desorption of the olefin and preventing further dehydrogenation reactions that lead to carbon deposition.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the former demonstrate superior performance in terms of activity and selectivity in n-butane dehydrogenation. Platinum-based catalysts, especially when combined with tin (PtSn), exhibit enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity towards olefin products, particularly butenes, while maintaining low deactivation parameters and showing improved stability after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, may not offer the same level of performance in terms of selectivity and stability. Recent developments in the field have focused on enhancing the efficiency and stability of these catalysts, aiming to broaden their industrial applications. Potential advantages of using noble metal-based catalysts include their high activity, selectivity, and stability, which contribute to efficient dehydrogenation processes. Metal oxide-based catalysts, while less effective in the specific context discussed, might find utility in alternative applications or in combination with noble metals to improve overall performance.

[3] "Results show that the nature of the metallic phase in monometallic samples appears to be different for the two supports.

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (such as Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (including chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find significant differences in their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages.

Platinum-based catalysts exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity in n-butane dehydrogenation when Sn is added. They show improved stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, especially in the PtSn/MgAl2O4 system. The metallic phase structure differs between Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts, affecting hydrogenolysis capacity. Sn addition to Pt catalysts increases tin reducibility, suggesting possible PtSn alloy formation, surface enrichment, and stabilization of tin species on the support. These changes in structure improve dehydrogenation selectivity and reduce carbon deposition.

Metal oxide catalysts like chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides may offer distinct properties, depending on their specific compositions and the reactions they catalyze. However, the document focuses on the Pt-Sn system and its implications for n-butane dehydrogenation rather than comparing it directly with metal oxides.

The document highlights the PtSn system's ability to modify catalyst structure, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity and stability. This suggests potential advantages in terms of efficiency and longevity for the PtSn catalysts in industrial applications targeting light olefin production.

The recent developments in this field likely involve refining catalyst composition, optimizing synthesis methods, and understanding the detailed mechanisms of metal interaction and catalytic activity. These advancements aim to improve the economic viability and environmental impact of olefin production processes.

In summary, while both noble metal and metal oxide catalysts play crucial roles in dehydrogenation reactions, the PtSn system stands out for its enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. This makes it a promising candidate for industrial applications requiring efficient conversion of paraffins to olefins.

比较贵金属催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（包括铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，我们发现了它们在组成、效率、工业应用、最新进展和潜在优势方面的显著差异。

当向铂中添加锡时，铂基催化剂在异丁烷脱氢化中表现出增强的活性和所有丁烯（正丁烯、顺式和反式2-丁烯以及1,3-丁二烯）的选择性。它们在多个反应再生周期内显示出良好的稳定性，尤其是PtSn/MgAl2O4系统。Pt/ZnAl2O4和Pt/MgAl2O4催化剂的金属相结构不同，影响氢解能力。向铂催化剂中添加锡增加了锡的可还原性，可能涉及PtSn合金或化合物的形成、表面富集、锡在支持体上的稀释效应以及作为Sn(II/IV)氧化物和SnCl2物种的稳定化。这些结构变化提高了脱氢选择性和减少了碳沉积。

金属氧化物催化剂如铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物在特定组成和催化反应中可能具有独特的性质。然而，本文主要关注的是Pt-Sn系统的特性和其对异丁烷脱氢化的影响，而不是直接与金属氧化物进行比较。

该领域最近的发展可能涉及优化催化剂组成、改进合成方法并深入了解金属相互作用和催化活性的详细机制。这些进步旨在提高轻烃生产过程中烯烃生成过程的经济性和环境影响。

简而言之，尽管贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂都在脱氢反应中发挥关键作用，但Pt-Sn系统以其增强的活性、选择性和稳定性而脱颖而出。这使其成为需要高效转换石蜡为烯烃的工业应用的有前景的候选对象。
