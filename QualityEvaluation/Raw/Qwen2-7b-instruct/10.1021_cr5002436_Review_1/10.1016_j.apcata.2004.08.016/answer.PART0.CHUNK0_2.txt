[1] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 leads to an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene)."
[2] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts shows low deactivation parameter values (close to 20%) and the yields to all butenes for the PtSn(0.3 wt.%) catalysts supported on both supports are slightly higher than for catalysts with a higher Sn content (0.5 wt.)."
[3] "The structure of the metallic phase of the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst appears to be different from that of the Pt/MgAl2O4 one."
[4] "When Sn is added to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, the tin reducibility is increased by either the catalytic effect of platinum or the PtSn co-reduction with probable alloy formation."
[5] "The presence of Sn in the vicinity of Pt would produce a decrease both in the size of the Pt ensembles and the Ptolefin interaction strength, by geometric and electronic effects."

1. The addition of tin to platinum catalysts on zinc aluminate and magnesium aluminate enhances their activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, resulting in high selectivity to various butenes. The catalysts show low deactivation parameters and slightly higher yields to all butenes when using 0.3 wt.% tin compared to 0.5 wt.% tin.

2. The structure of the metallic phase in the platinum-zinc aluminate catalyst differs from that in the platinum-magnesium aluminate catalyst. In the former, the particles exhibit a low hydrogenolysis capacity, while the latter displays a significant concentration of hydrogenolysis centers.

3. The addition of tin to platinum-based catalysts modifies the structure of the metallic phase. Tin's increased reducibility might occur through the catalytic action of platinum or the simultaneous reduction of both metals, potentially forming alloys.

4. The presence of tin next to platinum reduces the size of the platinum ensembles and weakens the interaction between the olefin and the metal surface, likely due to geometric and electronic effects.

5. The introduction of tin to the platinum catalysts decreases the size of the platinum clusters and the strength of olefin-metal interactions, facilitating easier desorption of the olefin and preventing further dehydrogenation reactions that lead to carbon deposition.

1. 在锌铝酸盐和镁铝酸盐上添加锡到铂催化剂可以增加其在正丁烷脱氢反应中的活性，并且能够产生高选择性到各种丁烯。这些催化剂的失活参数较低，使用0.3 wt.%锡时的总丁烯产量略高于使用0.5 wt.%锡的情况。

2. 铂-锌铝酸盐催化剂的金属相结构与铂-镁铝酸盐催化剂不同。在前者中，颗粒表现出低氢解能力，在后者中，存在显著的氢解中心。

3. 钛的添加改变了铂基催化剂的金属相结构。钛的增强还原性可能通过铂的催化作用或两种金属的共同还原形成合金而发生。

4. 钛的存在减少了铂簇的尺寸并削弱了烯烃与金属表面的相互作用，这可能是由于几何和电子效应导致的。

5. 将钛引入铂催化剂减少了铂簇的尺寸并减弱了烯烃与金属之间的相互作用，使烯烃更容易脱附，防止进一步的脱氢反应导致碳沉积。
