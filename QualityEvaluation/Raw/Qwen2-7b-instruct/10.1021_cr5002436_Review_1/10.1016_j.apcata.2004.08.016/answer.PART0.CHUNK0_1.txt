[1] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 leads to an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene)."
[2] "Besides, the bimetallic catalysts also show a good stability through the five successive reaction-regeneration cycles, mainly the PtSn/MgAl2O4 one."
[3] "The nature of the metallic phase in monometallic samples appears to be different for the two supports."
[4] "The addition of Sn to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts clearly improves the catalytic behaviour in n-butane dehydrogenation due to important changes in the structure of the metallic phase."
[5] "In fact, results would indicate not only a partial formation of PtSn alloys or intermetallic compounds between Pt0 and a fraction of Sn(0), but also a surface enrichment in Sn, dilution effects as well as the presence of tin stabilized on the support, probably as Sn(II/IV) oxides and SnCl2 species."
[6] "Taking into account the above mentioned results for reduced bimetallic catalysts, it can be concluded that a fraction of Sn would be as Sn(0), probably alloyed with Pt, and the remaining Sn appears to be as Sn(II)/Sn(IV) oxides and chlorinated tin species bounded to the support."
[7] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts leads to an increase of the activity and selectivity to olefins in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction."

1. The addition of tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) catalysts supported on zinc aluminate (ZnAl2O4) and magnesium aluminate (MgAl2O4) enhances their activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, leading to high selectivity towards butenes. These bimetallic catalysts also demonstrate good stability through five successive reaction-regeneration cycles, particularly in the case of PtSn/MgAl2O4.

2. The nature of the metallic phase differs between catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4. The structure of the metallic phase in monometallic catalysts appears distinct for each support type.

3. Adding Sn to Pt catalysts on both ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 significantly improves their performance in n-butane dehydrogenation by altering the structure of the metallic phase.

4. The Sn addition to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts creates a surface enrichment in Sn, introduces dilution effects, and stabilizes Sn on the support as Sn(II/IV) oxides and SnCl2 species.

5. The Sn addition to Pt catalysts on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 catalysts boosts their activity and selectivity for olefin production during n-butane dehydrogenation.

6. The Sn addition to Pt catalysts on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 leads to a decrease in hydrogen adsorption capacity, especially in the PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 sample.

7. The Sn addition to Pt catalysts on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 reduces the hydrogen adsorption capacity on both bimetallic catalysts.

8. The Sn addition to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts decreases the chemisorption capacity of hydrogen, mainly for the PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 sample.

9. The Sn addition to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts decreases the hydrogen adsorption capacity on both bimetallic catalysts.
