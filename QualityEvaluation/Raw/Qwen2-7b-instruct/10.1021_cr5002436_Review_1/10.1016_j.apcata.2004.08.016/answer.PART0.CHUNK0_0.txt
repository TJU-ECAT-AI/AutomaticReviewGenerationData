[1] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 leads to an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene)."
[2] "Besides, the bimetallic catalysts also show a good stability through the five successive reaction-regeneration cycles, mainly the PtSn/MgAl2O4 one."
[3] "The nature of the metallic phase in monometallic samples appears to be different for the two supports."
[4] "In fact, results would indicate not only a partial formation of PtSn alloys or intermetallic compounds between Pt0 and a fraction of Sn(0), but also a surface enrichment in Sn, dilution effects as well as the presence of tin stabilized on the support, probably as Sn(II/IV) oxides and SnCl2 species."
[5] "It can be concluded that the presence of Sn in the vicinity of Pt would produce a decrease both in the size of the Pt ensembles and the Ptolefin interaction strength, by geometric and electronic effects."
[6] "Therefore, once the olefin is formed (from the paraffin dehydrogenation) it is immediately desorbed, avoiding the formation of the coke precursors by a further dehydrogenation reaction on the bimetallic catalyst."

The literature discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The primary focus is on the PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 for n-butane dehydrogenation. These catalysts show improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. The Sn addition enhances the catalytic performance by modifying the structure of the metallic phase, leading to increased selectivity to olefins and reduced carbon deposition. The nature of the metallic phase differs between catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4, with Sn stabilizing on the support in the form of Sn(II/IV) oxides and SnCl2 species. The PtSn catalysts demonstrate good stability through successive reaction-regeneration cycles, with the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst showing particularly high stability. The presence of Sn in the vicinity of Pt results in a decrease in the size of Pt ensembles and the interaction strength between Pt and olefins, facilitating the immediate desorption of olefins and reducing coke precursor formation. This leads to enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity and lower carbon deposition, improving the overall catalytic performance of the bimetallic catalysts.

文献主要探讨了铂基贵金属催化剂和CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌、钼等金属氧化物在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。重点介绍了ZnAl2O4和MgAl2O4支持的PtSn催化剂用于n-丁烷脱氢的情况。这些催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面优于单金属催化剂。Sn的添加提高了催化性能，通过改变金属相的结构，导致对烯烃的选择性增加，并减少了碳沉积。支持在ZnAl2O4和MgAl2O4上的金属相性质不同，Sn在支持体上以Sn(II/IV)氧化物和SnCl2物种稳定。PtSn催化剂显示出良好的再生循环稳定性，尤其是PtSn/MgAl2O4催化剂的稳定性更高。Sn在Pt附近的存在导致Pt簇尺寸减小和Pt与烯烃之间的相互作用强度降低，使得烯烃立即脱附，减少焦炭前体的形成。这提高了脱氢选择性并降低了碳沉积，从而改善了双金属催化剂的整体催化性能。
