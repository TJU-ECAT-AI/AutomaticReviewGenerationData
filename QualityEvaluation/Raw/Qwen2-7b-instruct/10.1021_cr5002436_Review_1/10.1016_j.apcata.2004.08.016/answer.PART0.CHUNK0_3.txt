[1] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 leads to an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene)."
[2] "Besides, these bimetallic catalysts show low deactivation parameter values (close to 20%) and the yields to all butenes for the PtSn(0.3 wt.%) catalysts supported on both supports are slightly higher than for catalysts with a higher Sn content (0.5 wt.)."
[3] "PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 show good catalytic stability levels after five reaction-regeneration cycles, though the stability of the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst was clearly higher than for the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 one."
[4] "When Sn is added to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, the tin reducibility is increased by either the catalytic effect of platinum or the PtSn co-reduction with probable alloy formation."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the former demonstrate superior performance in terms of activity and selectivity in n-butane dehydrogenation. Platinum-based catalysts, especially when combined with tin (PtSn), exhibit enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity towards olefin products, particularly butenes, while maintaining low deactivation parameters and showing improved stability after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, may not offer the same level of performance in terms of selectivity and stability. Recent developments in the field have focused on enhancing the efficiency and stability of these catalysts, aiming to broaden their industrial applications. Potential advantages of using noble metal-based catalysts include their high activity, selectivity, and stability, which contribute to efficient dehydrogenation processes. Metal oxide-based catalysts, while less effective in the specific context discussed, might find utility in alternative applications or in combination with noble metals to improve overall performance.

比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的性能，前者在异丁烷脱氢反应中的活性和选择性表现更优。当铂与锡结合使用时（PtSn），表现出增强的催化活性和对所有丁烯（1-丁烯、顺式-和反式-2-丁烯以及1,3-丁二烯）的选择性，同时保持较低的失活参数，并显示出良好的再生周期稳定性。金属氧化物基催化剂在特定上下文中可能不会提供相同级别的性能。近年来的研究重点在于提高这些催化剂的效率和稳定性，以拓展其工业应用范围。使用贵金属基催化剂的潜在优势包括高活性、选择性和稳定性，这有助于高效地进行脱氢过程。而金属氧化物基催化剂虽然在具体讨论的背景下效率较低，但可能在其他应用中找到用途，或者与贵金属结合使用，以改善整体性能。
