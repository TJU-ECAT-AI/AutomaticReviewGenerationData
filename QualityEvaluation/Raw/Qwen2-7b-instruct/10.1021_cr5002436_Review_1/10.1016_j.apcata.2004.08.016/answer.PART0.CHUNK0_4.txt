[1] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 leads to an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene)."
[2] "Besides, the bimetallic catalysts also show a good stability through the five successive reaction-regeneration cycles, mainly the PtSn/MgAl2O4 one."
[3] "Results show that the nature of the metallic phase in monometallic samples appears to be different for the two supports. Thus, metallic particles with a very low concentration of hydrogenolytic sites (steps, corners, and edges) would exist in the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst in contrast with the structure of the metallic phase of the Pt/MgAl2O4 one, where the existence of an important concentration of hydrogenolytic sites is clearly observed (according to the cyclopentane hydrogenolysis results)."
[4] "The Sn addition to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts clearly improves the catalytic behaviour in n-butane dehydrogenation due to important changes in the structure of the metallic phase."
[5] "In fact, results would indicate not only a partial formation of PtSn alloys or intermetallic compounds between Pt0 and a fraction of Sn(0), but also a surface enrichment in Sn, dilution effects as well as the presence of tin stabilized on the support, probably as Sn(II/IV) oxides and SnCl2 species."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (such as Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (including chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find significant differences in their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages.

Platinum-based catalysts exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity in n-butane dehydrogenation when Sn is added. They show improved stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, especially in the PtSn/MgAl2O4 system. The metallic phase structure differs between Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts, affecting hydrogenolysis capacity. Sn addition to Pt catalysts increases tin reducibility, suggesting possible PtSn alloy formation, surface enrichment, and stabilization of tin species on the support. These changes in structure improve dehydrogenation selectivity and reduce carbon deposition.

Metal oxide catalysts like chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides may offer distinct properties, depending on their specific compositions and the reactions they catalyze. However, the document focuses on the Pt-Sn system and its implications for n-butane dehydrogenation rather than comparing it directly with metal oxides.

The document highlights the PtSn system's ability to modify catalyst structure, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity and stability. This suggests potential advantages in terms of efficiency and longevity for the PtSn catalysts in industrial applications targeting light olefin production.

The recent developments in this field likely involve refining catalyst composition, optimizing synthesis methods, and understanding the detailed mechanisms of metal interaction and catalytic activity. These advancements aim to improve the economic viability and environmental impact of olefin production processes.

In summary, while both noble metal and metal oxide catalysts play crucial roles in dehydrogenation reactions, the PtSn system stands out for its enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. This makes it a promising candidate for industrial applications requiring efficient conversion of paraffins to olefins.

比较贵金属催化剂（如铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（包括铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用，我们发现了它们在组成、效率、工业应用、最新进展和潜在优势方面的显著差异。

当向铂中添加锡时，铂基催化剂在异丁烷脱氢化中表现出增强的活性和所有丁烯（正丁烯、顺式和反式2-丁烯以及1,3-丁二烯）的选择性。它们在多个反应再生周期内显示出良好的稳定性，尤其是PtSn/MgAl2O4系统。Pt/ZnAl2O4和Pt/MgAl2O4催化剂的金属相结构不同，影响氢解能力。向铂催化剂中添加锡增加了锡的可还原性，可能涉及PtSn合金或化合物的形成、表面富集、锡在支持体上的稀释效应以及作为Sn(II/IV)氧化物和SnCl2物种的稳定化。这些结构变化提高了脱氢选择性和减少了碳沉积。

金属氧化物催化剂如铬酸盐、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物在特定组成和催化反应中可能具有独特的性质。然而，本文主要关注的是Pt-Sn系统的特性和其对异丁烷脱氢化的影响，而不是直接与金属氧化物进行比较。

该领域最近的发展可能涉及优化催化剂组成、改进合成方法并深入了解金属相互作用和催化活性的详细机制。这些进步旨在提高轻烃生产过程中烯烃生成过程的经济性和环境影响。

简而言之，尽管贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂都在脱氢反应中发挥关键作用，但Pt-Sn系统以其增强的活性、选择性和稳定性而脱颖而出。这使其成为需要高效转换石蜡为烯烃的工业应用的有前景的候选对象。
