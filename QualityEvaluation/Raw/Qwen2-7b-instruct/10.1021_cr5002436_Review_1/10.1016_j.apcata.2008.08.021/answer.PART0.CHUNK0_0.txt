[1] "The study reported in this paper shows that the presence of Zn,both taking part of the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface of well-defined MCM-41 spheres improves the selectivity of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonal- dehyde to crotyl alcohol."
[2] "Interestingly, the incorporation of these Zn species into the silica matrix produces structural centres with a higher stability towards a reduction treatment together with a higher polarizing/activation ability towards molecules containing a carbonyl double bond."
[3] "In fact, the newly created active sites further improve both the catalytic activity and selectivity (yield) to crotyl alcohol as compared with a conventional impregnated PtZn/ MCM-41 catalyst."
[4] "These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso- butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

The study reveals that adding Zinc (Zn) to Platinum (Pt) catalysts enhances their selectivity in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. When Zn is integrated into the silica matrix of MCM-41 spheres, it creates structural centers that remain stable during reduction treatments. These centers possess a high polarizing/activation capability towards molecules with carbonyl double bonds. The newly formed active sites significantly boost both the catalyst's activity and selectivity towards crotyl alcohol production compared to conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalysts. Moreover, these Zn-modified MCM-41-based Pt catalysts demonstrate outstanding performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving a 100% selectivity that remains stable over time.

研究显示，将锌（Zn）添加到铂（Pt）催化剂中可以提高其在选择性氢化顺丁烯醛到顺丁醇中的选择性。当Zn融入MCM-41球体的硅酸盐骨架时，它会产生结构中心，在还原处理过程中具有更高的稳定性。这些中心对含羰基双键的分子具有较高的极化/激活能力。新形成的活性位点显著提高了催化剂的活性和选择性，以产生顺丁醇与常规PtZn/MCM-41催化剂相比。此外，这些Zn改性的MCM-41基Pt催化剂在异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯的过程中表现出卓越性能，达到100%的选择性，且随时间保持稳定。
