[1] "The study reported in this paper shows that the presence of Zn,both taking part of the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface of well-defined MCM-41 spheres improves the selectivity of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonal- dehyde to crotyl alcohol."
[2] "Interestingly, the incorporation of these Zn species into the silica matrix produces structural centres with a higher stability towards a reduction treatment together with a higher polarizing/activation ability towards molecules containing a carbonyl double bond."
[3] "In fact, the newly created active sites further improve both the catalytic activity and selectivity (yield) to crotyl alcohol as compared with a conventional impregnated PtZn/ MCM-41 catalyst."
[4] "These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso- butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It highlights the effectiveness of Platinum catalysts when combined with Zinc in improving the selectivity for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. The presence of Zinc in the catalyst matrix enhances the stability and polarizing/activation ability of the catalyst towards molecules containing a carbonyl double bond, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. Moreover, these Zn-doped catalysts exhibit excellent behavior in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving a high selectivity of 100% which remains stable over time. The recent developments in this field focus on improving the compositions and effectiveness of these catalysts for various industrial applications.
