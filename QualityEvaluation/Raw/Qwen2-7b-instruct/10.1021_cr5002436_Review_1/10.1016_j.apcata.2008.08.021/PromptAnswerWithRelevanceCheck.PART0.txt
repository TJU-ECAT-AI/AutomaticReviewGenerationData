[1] "The study reported in this paper shows that the presence of Zn,both taking part of the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface of well-defined MCM-41 spheres improves the selectivity of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonal- dehyde to crotyl alcohol."
[2] "Interestingly, the incorporation of these Zn species into the silica matrix produces structural centres with a higher stability towards a reduction treatment together with a higher polarizing/activation ability towards molecules containing a carbonyl double bond."
[3] "In fact, the newly created active sites further improve both the catalytic activity and selectivity (yield) to crotyl alcohol as compared with a conventional impregnated PtZn/ MCM-41 catalyst."
[4] "These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso- butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

The study reveals that adding Zinc (Zn) to Platinum (Pt) catalysts enhances their selectivity in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. When Zn is integrated into the silica matrix of MCM-41 spheres, it creates structural centers that remain stable during reduction treatments. These centers possess a high polarizing/activation capability towards molecules with carbonyl double bonds. The newly formed active sites significantly boost both the catalyst's activity and selectivity towards crotyl alcohol production compared to conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalysts. Moreover, these Zn-modified MCM-41-based Pt catalysts demonstrate outstanding performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving a 100% selectivity that remains stable over time.

研究显示，将锌（Zn）添加到铂（Pt）催化剂中可以提高其在选择性氢化顺丁烯醛到顺丁醇中的选择性。当Zn融入MCM-41球体的硅酸盐骨架时，它会产生结构中心，在还原处理过程中具有更高的稳定性。这些中心对含羰基双键的分子具有较高的极化/激活能力。新形成的活性位点显著提高了催化剂的活性和选择性，以产生顺丁醇与常规PtZn/MCM-41催化剂相比。此外，这些Zn改性的MCM-41基Pt催化剂在异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯的过程中表现出卓越性能，达到100%的选择性，且随时间保持稳定。

[1] "The discovery of the M41S family materials has attracted much attention in a wide range of research fields [15]."
[2] "Unfortunately, pure siliceous MCM-41 materials exhibit poor acidity and redox properties which limit their application in research fields such as catalysis."
[3] "In this sense, Tanev et al. described an excellent activity and selectivity for Ti-containing mesoporous molecular sieves in the oxidation of phenols to quinones and the conversion of benzene to phenol [6]."
[4] "Similarly, the presence of Zn either as a promoter [1820] or as a support (as ZnO) [21] has been shown to improve the catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (crotonaldehyde) to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol."
[5] "Interestingly, in the last few years the incorporation of metal cations to the siliceous framework of MCM-41 has been extended to other metal species such Al [8,10,11], V [12], Zr [13], Cu [9,14], Zn [11,15,16], etc., and even to bimetallic mixtures such as AlZn [8,10,17], AlFe [8], CuZn [9,14], etc."
[6] "Although the metal incorporation improves the catalytic proper- ties of the pure MCM-41 material, the real location of the metal species is quite frequently a matter of debate."
[7] "In fact, the initial heat of adsorption decreases from 80 kJ mol1 on Pt/MCM-41 to 53 kJ mol1 on the Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 catalyst, this value being even lower than that reported for a bimetallic PtZn/X-zeolite catalyst (75 kJ mol1), although with a lower zinc content (0.23 wt.%) [22]."
[8] "In summary, these results confirm that incorporation of Zn into the siliceous matrix of MCM-41 drastically modifies the physico-chemical properties of the supported Pt nanoparticles, i.e. there is a weakening both in the strength and extent of their interaction with H2."
[9] "In the case of the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst, the presence of some reduced Zn would be expected due to the absence of any additional stabilization from the silica support."
[10] "Interestingly, for all Zn-containing catalysts the selectivity towards CROALC formation increases in the first minutes of the reaction (with a decrease in the conversion) up to a maximum, suddenly decreasing thereafter."
[11] "Furthermore, it has been proposed that the presence of ionic species of a second metal close to platinum can favour the migration of highly dehydrogenated species (coke precursors) from the active site to the support [44]."
[12] "The same arguments can be used for the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 although, in this case, the possible formation of a PtZn alloy could also contribute to the enhanced selectivity and stability."

[1] "Although the incorporation of the metal cation into the structure of the mesoporous molecular sieve commonly produces the partial deterioration of the long-range ordered structure, the newly created active centres have shown an improved catalytic behaviour for a wide range of organic reactions [610]."
[2] "In the same way, Corma et al. reported an improved catalytic activity and selectivity of Sn modified MCM-41 materials for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of ketones to lactones [7]."
[3] "Interestingly, in the last few years the incorporation of metal cations to the siliceous framework of MCM-41 has been extended to other metal species such Al [8,10,11], V [12], Zr [13], Cu [9,14], Zn [11,15,16], etc., and even to bimetallic mixtures such as AlZn [8,10,17], AlFe [8], CuZn [9,14], etc."
[4] "Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions. In this sense, the presence of Zn either as a promoter [1820] or as a support (as ZnO) [21] has been shown to improve the catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (crotonaldehyde) to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol."
[5] "Taking into account the beneficial effects of zinc and the improved catalytic behaviour of the metal-doped ordered mesopor- ous materials, the aim of this work is to study the effect of Zn on the catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts supported on pure and Zn- modified MCM-41."
[6] "The monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst shows higher conversion values than the bimetallic samples, although with a faster deactivation with time on stream (conversion decreases from 51 to 29% in 24 h)."
[7] "This deactivation was completely suppressed after Zn addition, although at a lower conversion level."
[8] "While both Pt catalysts supported on Zn-doped MCM-41 show a similar initial iso-butane conversion at around 15%, the conventional bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst results in a slightly lower value (12%), in agreement with the lower platinum dispersion on this sample (see Table 1)."
[9] "With regard to selectivity toward iso-butene (Fig. 6b) the monometallic catalyst shows an initial value of 10% which increases with time on stream up to 22%, cracking products (methane, ethane and propane) composing the rest of outlet gases."
[10] "Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, we find that they are used in various industries. Platinum is often utilized in the chemoselective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes, such as crotonaldehyde, to unsaturated alcohols, where the presence of zinc can improve the catalyst's behavior. Zinc incorporation, whether within the mesoporous framework or on the surface, has been shown to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity of Pt catalysts. Metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx and molybdenum oxides might be used in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Recent developments include the use of bimetallic mixtures like AlZn and CuZn, which can offer advantages over pure metals in terms of activity and selectivity. Industrial applications of these catalysts span multiple sectors, including petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Advantages of these catalysts include improved efficiency, selectivity, and stability under reaction conditions.

The non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins involves converting olefins to alkanes or alkenes, a process that can be enhanced by the use of these catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts can show high conversion rates initially, but tend to deactivate over time. Adding zinc to these catalysts can suppress deactivation, maintaining higher conversion levels. Metal oxide catalysts like CrOx and molybdenum oxides may play roles in cracking and isomerization reactions, which can affect selectivity and stability. Zinc incorporation into the catalyst structure or as a surface layer can increase selectivity significantly, reaching up to 100% in the case of iso-butane dehydrogenation, with the selectivity remaining stable throughout the reaction.
