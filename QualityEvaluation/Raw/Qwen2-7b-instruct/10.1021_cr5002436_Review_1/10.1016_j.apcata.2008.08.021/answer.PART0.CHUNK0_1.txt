[1] "The discovery of the M41S family materials has attracted much attention in a wide range of research fields [15]."
[2] "Unfortunately, pure siliceous MCM-41 materials exhibit poor acidity and redox properties which limit their application in research fields such as catalysis."
[3] "In this sense, Tanev et al. described an excellent activity and selectivity for Ti-containing mesoporous molecular sieves in the oxidation of phenols to quinones and the conversion of benzene to phenol [6]."
[4] "Similarly, the presence of Zn either as a promoter [1820] or as a support (as ZnO) [21] has been shown to improve the catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (crotonaldehyde) to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol."
[5] "Interestingly, in the last few years the incorporation of metal cations to the siliceous framework of MCM-41 has been extended to other metal species such Al [8,10,11], V [12], Zr [13], Cu [9,14], Zn [11,15,16], etc., and even to bimetallic mixtures such as AlZn [8,10,17], AlFe [8], CuZn [9,14], etc."
[6] "Although the metal incorporation improves the catalytic proper- ties of the pure MCM-41 material, the real location of the metal species is quite frequently a matter of debate."
[7] "In fact, the initial heat of adsorption decreases from 80 kJ mol1 on Pt/MCM-41 to 53 kJ mol1 on the Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 catalyst, this value being even lower than that reported for a bimetallic PtZn/X-zeolite catalyst (75 kJ mol1), although with a lower zinc content (0.23 wt.%) [22]."
[8] "In summary, these results confirm that incorporation of Zn into the siliceous matrix of MCM-41 drastically modifies the physico-chemical properties of the supported Pt nanoparticles, i.e. there is a weakening both in the strength and extent of their interaction with H2."
[9] "In the case of the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst, the presence of some reduced Zn would be expected due to the absence of any additional stabilization from the silica support."
[10] "Interestingly, for all Zn-containing catalysts the selectivity towards CROALC formation increases in the first minutes of the reaction (with a decrease in the conversion) up to a maximum, suddenly decreasing thereafter."
[11] "Furthermore, it has been proposed that the presence of ionic species of a second metal close to platinum can favour the migration of highly dehydrogenated species (coke precursors) from the active site to the support [44]."
[12] "The same arguments can be used for the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 although, in this case, the possible formation of a PtZn alloy could also contribute to the enhanced selectivity and stability."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition of these catalysts varies, with Platinum-based catalysts showing high activity in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, while metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are used in the dehydrogenation of olefins. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on factors like the type of metal, its location within the catalyst, and its interaction with the support material. Recent developments include the incorporation of various metals into the MCM-41 framework to enhance catalytic properties. The advantages of these catalysts include improved selectivity and stability in certain reactions, as seen in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene. The potential benefits include increased efficiency and lower production costs in industrial processes involving the conversion of olefins.
