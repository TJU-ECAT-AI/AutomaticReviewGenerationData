          [1] "The study reported in this paper shows that the presence of Zn,both taking part of the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface of well-defined MCM-41 spheres improves the selectivity of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonal- dehyde to crotyl alcohol."
          [2] "Interestingly, the incorporation of these Zn species into the silica matrix produces structural centres with a higher stability towards a reduction treatment together with a higher polarizing/activation ability towards molecules containing a carbonyl double bond."
          [3] "In fact, the newly created active sites further improve both the catalytic activity and selectivity (yield) to crotyl alcohol as compared with a conventional impregnated PtZn/ MCM-41 catalyst."
          [4] "These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso- butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

          The presence of Zinc (Zn) in noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), enhances their selectivity in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. When Zn is integrated into the silica matrix of MCM-41 spheres, it generates structural centers that are more stable under reduction treatments and exhibit a higher polarizing/activation capacity towards molecules containing a carbonyl double bond. This results in improved catalytic activity and selectivity for crotyl alcohol production compared to conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalysts. Additionally, these Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts demonstrate exceptional performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving a high selectivity of 100% that remains stable over time.

          在贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂催化剂中，锌（Zn）的加入提高了其在选择性氢化顺丁烯醛到顺丁醇中的选择性。当Zn融入MCM-41球体的硅酸盐骨架中时，它产生了更稳定的结构中心，在还原处理过程中具有更高的稳定性，并对含羰基双键的分子具有更高的极化/激活能力。这使得与常规PtZn/MCM-41催化剂相比，催化活性和选择性（产率）得到了改善。此外，这些Zn掺杂的MCM-41基铂催化剂在异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯的过程中表现出卓越性能，达到高达100%的选择性，并且随着时间的推移保持稳定。
