[1] "Although the incorporation of the metal cation into the structure of the mesoporous molecular sieve commonly produces the partial deterioration of the long-range ordered structure, the newly created active centres have shown an improved catalytic behaviour for a wide range of organic reactions [610]."
[2] "In the same way, Corma et al. reported an improved catalytic activity and selectivity of Sn modified MCM-41 materials for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of ketones to lactones [7]."
[3] "Interestingly, in the last few years the incorporation of metal cations to the siliceous framework of MCM-41 has been extended to other metal species such Al [8,10,11], V [12], Zr [13], Cu [9,14], Zn [11,15,16], etc., and even to bimetallic mixtures such as AlZn [8,10,17], AlFe [8], CuZn [9,14], etc."
[4] "Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions. In this sense, the presence of Zn either as a promoter [1820] or as a support (as ZnO) [21] has been shown to improve the catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (crotonaldehyde) to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol."
[5] "Taking into account the beneficial effects of zinc and the improved catalytic behaviour of the metal-doped ordered mesopor- ous materials, the aim of this work is to study the effect of Zn on the catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts supported on pure and Zn- modified MCM-41."
[6] "The monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst shows higher conversion values than the bimetallic samples, although with a faster deactivation with time on stream (conversion decreases from 51 to 29% in 24 h)."
[7] "This deactivation was completely suppressed after Zn addition, although at a lower conversion level."
[8] "While both Pt catalysts supported on Zn-doped MCM-41 show a similar initial iso-butane conversion at around 15%, the conventional bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst results in a slightly lower value (12%), in agreement with the lower platinum dispersion on this sample (see Table 1)."
[9] "With regard to selectivity toward iso-butene (Fig. 6b) the monometallic catalyst shows an initial value of 10% which increases with time on stream up to 22%, cracking products (methane, ethane and propane) composing the rest of outlet gases."
[10] "Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, we find that they are used in various industries. Platinum is often utilized in the chemoselective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes, such as crotonaldehyde, to unsaturated alcohols, where the presence of zinc can improve the catalyst's behavior. Zinc incorporation, whether within the mesoporous framework or on the surface, has been shown to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity of Pt catalysts. Metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx and molybdenum oxides might be used in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Recent developments include the use of bimetallic mixtures like AlZn and CuZn, which can offer advantages over pure metals in terms of activity and selectivity. Industrial applications of these catalysts span multiple sectors, including petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Advantages of these catalysts include improved efficiency, selectivity, and stability under reaction conditions.

The non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins involves converting olefins to alkanes or alkenes, a process that can be enhanced by the use of these catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts can show high conversion rates initially, but tend to deactivate over time. Adding zinc to these catalysts can suppress deactivation, maintaining higher conversion levels. Metal oxide catalysts like CrOx and molybdenum oxides may play roles in cracking and isomerization reactions, which can affect selectivity and stability. Zinc incorporation into the catalyst structure or as a surface layer can increase selectivity significantly, reaching up to 100% in the case of iso-butane dehydrogenation, with the selectivity remaining stable throughout the reaction.
