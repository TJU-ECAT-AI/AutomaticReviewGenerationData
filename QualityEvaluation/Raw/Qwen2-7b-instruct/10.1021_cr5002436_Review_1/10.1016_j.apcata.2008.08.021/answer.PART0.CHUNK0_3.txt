[1] "The study reported in this paper shows that the presence of Zn,both taking part of the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface of well-defined MCM-41 spheres improves the selectivity of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonal- dehyde to crotyl alcohol."
[2] "Interestingly, the incorporation of these Zn species into the silica matrix produces structural centres with a higher stability towards a reduction treatment together with a higher polarizing/activation ability towards molecules containing a carbonyl double bond."
[3] "In fact, the newly created active sites further improve both the catalytic activity and selectivity (yield) to crotyl alcohol as compared with a conventional impregnated PtZn/ MCM-41 catalyst."
[4] "These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso- butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

The study highlights the improvement in selectivity of Pt catalysts when Zn is incorporated into the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface of MCM-41 spheres. This results in higher stability and polarizing/activation abilities towards molecules with carbonyl double bonds. The newly created active sites enhance both the catalytic activity and selectivity for crotyl alcohol production compared to conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalysts. Moreover, these Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit excellent dehydrogenation behavior for iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving a high selectivity of 100% that remains stable over time.

研究显示，当锌参与硅酸盐骨架或沉积在定义明确的MCM-41球表面时，铂催化剂的选择性得到提高。这导致对含羰基双键分子更高的稳定性和激活能力。新形成的活性位点进一步提高了催化剂的活性和选择性，以生产丙烯醇与常规PtZn/MCM-41催化剂相比。此外，这些含锌修饰的MCM-41基铂催化剂在异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯的过程中表现出优异的行为，达到高达100%的高选择性，且随时间保持稳定。
