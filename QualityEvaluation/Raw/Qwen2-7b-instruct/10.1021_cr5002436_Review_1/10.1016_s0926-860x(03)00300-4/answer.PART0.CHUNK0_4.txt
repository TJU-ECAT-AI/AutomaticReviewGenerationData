[1] "Sintering experiments were carried out at constant temperature, varying the sintering time. Figs. 1 and 2 show the time-evolution of the relative dispersion as a function of sintering temperature for pO2 = 0.001 atm and pO2 = 0.21 atm, respectively."
[2] "An increase in the oxygen concentration decreases the rate of sintering."
[3] "The proposed kinetic model fits satisfactorily all the experimental data obtained during the sintering and redispersion experiments, allowing the determination of the influence of the operating conditions on the disperision variation rate during sintering experiments as well as during redispersion experiments."
[4] "The redispersion experiments show that the net rate of redispersion depends both on oxygen and HCl concentrations."

The document discusses the sintering and redispersion of a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst used in naphtha reforming. The sintering process is influenced by temperature and oxygen concentration, with higher oxygen concentration decreasing the sintering rate. The redispersion process, which restores the dispersion of the metal phase, is affected by both oxygen and HCl concentrations. A kinetic model has been developed to describe the effects of various operating conditions on the dispersion variation rates during both sintering and redispersion. The model provides a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic behavior under different conditions.

本文讨论了用于裂解重整的Pt/Al2O3催化剂的烧结和再分散。烧结过程受温度和氧浓度的影响，氧浓度的增加会降低烧结速率。再分散过程，即金属相的分散恢复，受到氧和HCl浓度的共同影响。提出了一种动力学模型，以描述在不同操作条件下，烧结和再分散过程中分散率的变化。该模型为理解催化行为提供了全面的见解。
