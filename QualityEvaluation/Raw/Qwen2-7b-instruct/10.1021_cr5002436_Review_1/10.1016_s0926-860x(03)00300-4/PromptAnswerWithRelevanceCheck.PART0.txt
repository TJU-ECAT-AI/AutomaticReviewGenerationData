<p>As regards the activation energies, the value of the parameter QS (38.61.3 kJ/mol) is also in quite good agreement with the difference between ES and ER (ES ER = 49.7 kJ/mol).</p>

[1] "Sintering and redispersion of Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts have been widely investigated [6,7]. Nevertheless,in most cases both phenomena, sintering and redis- persion, have been studied individually and often under experimental conditions which are not usually employed at industrial level [8,9]."
[2] "While sintering kinetics has been extensively inves- tigated [10,11,14,15], few works have been devoted to the redispersion (reactivation) kinetics of sintered (deactivated) catalysts [16,17]."

This document primarily discusses the sintering and redispersion of Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts, presenting a new kinetic model that addresses these phenomena. The model enables the assessment of how various operating conditions impact the dispersion variation rate during both sintering and redispersion processes. It highlights that most studies have focused on these processes separately and often under conditions not typically encountered in industrial settings. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the interaction between sintering and redispersion, especially considering their implications for catalyst performance and deactivation mechanisms.

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts are known for their efficiency in this process due to their ability to facilitate the conversion of olefins into higher value products without oxygen. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, offer a more robust and stable alternative, often with enhanced thermal resistance. Industrial applications of these catalysts vary significantly, with Platinum catalysts being crucial in petrochemical industries for the production of gasoline components and metal oxide-based catalysts being favored in the manufacturing of various chemical intermediates and fine chemicals. Recent developments in the field focus on enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts through advanced synthesis methods and alloying strategies. Potential advantages include improved efficiency, lower energy consumption, and reduced environmental impact.

The document discusses the sintering and redispersion of a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst used in naphtha reforming. The sintering process is influenced by temperature and oxygen concentration, with higher oxygen concentration decreasing the sintering rate. The redispersion process, which restores the dispersion of the metal phase, is affected by both oxygen and HCl concentrations. A kinetic model has been developed to describe the effects of various operating conditions on the dispersion variation rates during both sintering and redispersion. The model provides a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic behavior under different conditions.
