[1] "Sintering and redispersion of Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts have been widely investigated [6,7]. Nevertheless,in most cases both phenomena, sintering and redis- persion, have been studied individually and often under experimental conditions which are not usually employed at industrial level [8,9]."
[2] "While sintering kinetics has been extensively inves- tigated [10,11,14,15], few works have been devoted to the redispersion (reactivation) kinetics of sintered (deactivated) catalysts [16,17]."
[3] "In this paper we present a new kinetic model to study simultaneously the sintering and redispersion of metal supported catalysts."
[4] "The proposed kinetic model fits satisfactorily all the experimental data obtained during the sintering and redispersion experiments, allowing the determination of the influence of the operating conditions on the dis- persion variation rate during sintering experiments as well as during redispersion experiments."

This document primarily discusses the sintering and redispersion of Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts, presenting a new kinetic model that addresses these phenomena. The model enables the assessment of how various operating conditions impact the dispersion variation rate during both sintering and redispersion processes. It highlights that most studies have focused on these processes separately and often under conditions not typically encountered in industrial settings. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the interaction between sintering and redispersion, especially considering their implications for catalyst performance and deactivation mechanisms.

本文主要讨论了Pt/-Al2O3催化剂的烧结和再分散现象，提出了一种新的动力学模型来研究这些现象。该模型能够满足在烧结和再分散实验中获得的所有实验数据，从而确定操作条件对烧结实验及再分散实验中分散率变化速率的影响。研究强调了单独研究烧结和再分散过程的重要性，特别是考虑到它们对催化剂性能和失活机制的影响时。
