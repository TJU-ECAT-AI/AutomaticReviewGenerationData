1. Introduction
Sintering is one of the main causes of deactivation of bifunctional Pt/Al2O3-Cl naphtha reforming cata- lysts [1]. It mainly occurs during catalyst regenera- tion performed under oxidizing atmospheres because the reaction is highly exothermic and forms water [2].
The sintering of Pt crystallites may be partially pre- vented by adding chlorinated compounds to the ox- idizing mixtures [3]. Thus, the normal regeneration procedure involves a rejuvenation step, in which the metallic fraction of the aged catalyst is restored with a redispersion treatment with O2/HCl/H2O/N2 mixtures at 673773 K [35].

Sintering and redispersion of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts have been widely investigated [6,7]. Nevertheless,in most cases both phenomena, sintering and redis- persion, have been studied individually and often under experimental conditions which are not usually employed at industrial level [8,9].
It has been pointed out that, in most of cases, sinter- ing data attain a non-zero residual dispersion after a fi- nite sintering time and therefore kinetic models which allow for the prediction of the presence of this resid- ual dispersion should be used [10,11]. These models are called generalized power-law equations (GPLE) [10,11] or deactivation models with residual activ- ity (DMRA) [12,13]. In general reviews on sinter- ing kinetics [14,15], Bartholomew has shown that the use of generalized power-law equations provides a more comprehensive analysis of sintering kinetic data than the simple power law expression (SPLE).

on et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 248 (2003) 279289 misleading conclusions about the deactivation mech- anism and lead to systematic errors in estimating in- trinsic parameters, such as activation energies [13].
While sintering kinetics has been extensively inves- tigated [10,11,14,15], few works have been devoted to the redispersion (reactivation) kinetics of sintered (deactivated) catalysts [16,17].
In this paper we present a new kinetic model to study simultaneously the sintering and redispersion of metal supported catalysts. This model has been de- veloped to explain the effect of the main operating conditions (i.e. the chlorine and oxygen concentration in the oxidizing atmosphere, the temperature, etc.) on the dispersion variation rate under simulated industrial conditions. In addition, this kinetic model is a gener- alization of other deactivation models previously pro- posed for sintering [11,14,18].
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A catalyst containing 0.6% Pt and 0.9% Cl was prepared as previously described [12]. A high purity -Al2O3 powder (Cyanamid Ketjen CK-300) was im- pregnated at 303 K with an aqueous solution contain- ing H2PtCl6 and HCl. After impregnation, the sample was dried for 12 h at 393 K and heated in flowing air to 773 K. Then, the Cl content was regulated using a gaseous mixture of HCl, water, and air. Finally, the sample was purged with N2 and reduced in flowing H2 for 8 h at 773 K.
2.2. Hydrogen chemisorption
Accessible platinum fractions were determined by hydrogen chemisorption. Prior to the Pt dispersion measurements, the samples were reduced under flow- ing hydrogen during 2 h at 773 K and then evacuated at the same temperature. The double isotherm method was used [19], the first isotherm gave the total gas up- take and the second, obtained after 1 h of evacuation at room temperature, the weakly adsorbed gas. By differ- ence, the amount of strongly adsorbed H2, (HC)i, was determined. A stoichiometric ratio of (HC)i/Pts = 1,where Pts implies a Pt atom on surface, was used. The volumetric adsorption experiments were performed in a conventional glass vacuum apparatus equipped with an MKS Baratron pressure gauge. The pressure range of isotherms was 050 torr and extrapolation to zero pressure was used as a measure of the gas uptake on the metal.
2.3. Sintering procedure
Sintering treatments using fresh catalysts (initial dispersion, D0 = 65%) were performed with O2/N2 mixtures at temperatures ranging from 673 to 873 K.
The effect of the O2 partial pressure was examined using oxygen concentrations varying from 0.1%, cor- responding to industrial regeneration conditions, to 100% (pO2 = 0.001, 0.02, 0.21 and 1 atm).
2.4. Redispersion procedure
Redispersion treatments of a previously aged cat- alyst were carried out in a flow system at 773 K employing HCl/O2/H2O/N2 mixtures of different compositions. Water and HCl were continuously added to O2/N2 gas mixtures by employing a motor-driven syringe. To avoid water condensation the gaseous mixture was kept at a temperature higher than 353 K, before entering to the reactor. The ini- tial dispersion of the sintered sample was 12%. The effects of the O2 partial pressure and of the HCl con- centration were studied. The O2 partial pressure was varied from 0 to 100% and the HCl concentration from 0.0005 atm to 0.003 atm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Sintering
Sintering experiments were carried out at constant temperature, varying the sintering time. Figs. 1 and 2 show the time-evolution of the relative dispersion as a function of sintering temperature for pO2 = 0.001 atm and pO2 = 0.21 atm, respectively. These figures reveal that: (i) for the same sintering time, the relative disper- sion decreases with increasing sintering temperature,and (ii) the dispersion of sintered catalysts decreases as a function of time until attaining an asymptotic dis- persion value, always different from zero. This value would correspond to a pseudo-stationary state, called

Thus, a higher sintering tempera- ture produces an increase of the sintering rate and a decrease of the residual dispersion. An increase in the oxygen concentration decreases the rate of sintering.
As has already been said, because the dispersion at- tains a pseudo-steady state value, deactivation models with residual dispersion should be used [1015]. In a previous paper [18], we have developed a Sintering Kinetic Model, which provides a quantitative relation- Fig. 2. Influence of the temperature on the sintering rate, pO2 = 0.20 atm. ship between the operational variables involved during the process and the kinetic parameters. This model is in fact an extension of the kinetic model proposed by Fuentes and Ruiz-Trevio [10,11]. The sintering rate was expressed as function of the relative dispersion, Dr = D/D0, as dDr dt = ψD(Dr Drr)n (1) 282
A. Monz
on et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 248 (2003) 279289 In this expression, ψD is the deactivation function of sintering, D0 the initial dispersion, Drr the relative residual dispersion attained at t and n the deac- tivation kinetic order of sintering. As regards the value of n, it has been demonstrated that all the sintering data published in the literature can be satisfactorily fitted using either n = 1 or 2. The discrimination be- tween these two values is still an open question as was pointed out by Fuentes [20] and, for both orders, mech- anistic and/or mathematical explanations have been proposed [20,21]. In the present case, we have selected the value of n = 1 because we obtained the best fit of the data using this value, but the quality of the fitting using n = 2 was almost the same. Recently, Lif et al.
[22] in a study of sintering kinetics of a Ni/-Al2O3 catalyst, have also assumed a value of n = 1 taking into consideration the best fit obtained with this sin- tering order.
Taking into account the above considerations, the explicit relationship between Dr versus time for n = 1 is Dr = D

(4b) Eqs. (3b) and (4b) reveal that both ψD and Drr de- crease as the pO2 increases, indicating that high oxy- gen pressure inhibits the sintering process. This fact could be explained by considering the higher stability of the Pt+4 species as the pO2 increases [18]. The ac- tivation energy was 132.6 kJ/mol, which is similar to the values reported by Fuentes and Gamas [11] and Bartholomew [14,15], for the sintering of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts under air. The parameter Drr is slightly in- fluenced by pO2 and decreases as the temperature in- creases. The temperature dependence of the residual relative dispersion was well fitted using a VantHoff type equation [18]. However, the parameter QS in- volved in Eq. (4a) has no clear physical meaning.
3.2. Redispersion
Sintered catalysts were redispersed under HCl/O2/ H2O/N2 mixtures at different temperatures. The high- est catalyst redispersion was attained when the tem- perature was between 753 and 773 K. A kinetic study on the redispersion of a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was, there- fore, performed at 773 K.
The effect of the oxygen concentration during re- dispersion of a sintered catalyst at a fixed HCl partial pressure is shown in Fig. 3. An increase in the O2 concentration produces an increase in the redispersion rate and the steady state value of the dispersion also increases. It should be noted that when the O2 concen- tration is zero an additional sintering of the metallic phase takes place (see Fig. 3). This fact demonstrates that the simultaneous presence of the HCl and oxy- gen is required to produce the redispersion of the aged catalyst.
The effect of the HCl partial pressure on the redis- persion process was also investigated. Fig. 4 shows that the higher the HCl concentration, the higher the redispersion rate and a higher final value of the dis- persion is attained.
3.3. Kinetic model of sintering-redispersion
In most cases, sintering and redispersion have been studied individually in spite of the fact that both processes can be considered as a part of a sin- gle process. In recent works [2325], employing in situ EXAFS spectroscopy we have clearly shown that a [Pt(OH)4Cl2]2hydroxychlorinated complex is the key species for the sintering/redispersion pro- cess. This hydroxychlorinated species is responsible for the redispersion of the metallic fraction. Hence,the operating conditions, i.e. temperature, O2 partial pressure, H2O partial pressure, chlorine concentra- tion, determine the equilibrium between the surface species, which is the key to whether sintering or redispersion of Pt particles occurs. Therefore, the
A. Monz
on et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 248 (2003) 279289 283 Fig. 3. Influence of pO2 on the redispersion rate. evolution of the metallic dispersion should be con- sidered as a reversible process and a unique kinetic model should be able to analyze both sintering and redispersion data. This new kinetic model assumes the sintering-redispersion phenomenon as a first-order reversible process. Therefore, the net variation rate of the metallic dispersion can be written as dD dt = ψR(DT D) ψSD (5) ψR and ψS are the kinetic functions of redispersion and sintering, respectively. The term DT corresponds Fig. 4. Influence of pHCl on the redispersion rate. to the maximum allowable catalyst dispersion. Ideally the catalyst could attain a value of 100% but we as- sume that DT takes the initial value of the dispersion before the sintering treatments. In our case the value of DT is equal to 56%.
The term (DT D) represents the driving force for the redispersion process and the term D, the driv- ing force for the sintering process. Consequently, if ψR(DT D) > ψSD a redispersion process occurs while if ψR(DT D) < ψSD the sintering of the cat- alyst is observed.The variation rate of the catalyst dispersion can also be re-written as dD dt = (ψR + ψS)D + ψRDT (6) and finally, the following equation can be derived dD dt = ψG(D DSS) (7) where ψG = ψR + ψS (8) and
DSS = DT
ψR ψR + ψS (9) It is important to note that Eq. (2) (for n = 1) and Eq. (7) are mathematically equivalent in form.
However, now it is quite straightforward to assign a 284
A. Monz
on et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 248 (2003) 279289 physical meaning to the kinetic parameters involved in Eqs. (7)(9). Moreover, the deactivation function of sintering, ψD, used in Eq. (2) is, in fact, the sum of the kinetic functions for sintering and redisper- sion in this Sintering-Redispersion Kinetic Model, as indicated by Eq. (8). In addition, assuming that the dispersion attains a pseudo-steady state when t ,the following expression can be derived dD dt = 0 DSS = Dt= DT ψR ψR + ψS

(10) Therefore, this model allows the prediction of the final steady dispersion from the values of ψR, ψS and DT.
The parameter KRS in Eq. (10) represents the equi- librium constant for the sintering-redispersion process.
KRS = ψR ψS =

(DT DSS)
(11) Thus, high KRS values should be obtained during redispersion experiments while low ones should be obtained during sintering. If KRS tends to zero, the residual dispersion also tends to zero, attaining the maximum theoretical degree of sintering. On the other hand, when KRS tends to , the final dispersion tends to DT, which represents the maximum degree of redispersion.
The dependence with time of the catalyst dispersion can be obtained integrating Eq. (7).
D = DSS + (D0 DSS) exp(ψGt) (12) The above expression can be re-written in terms of the parameters corresponding to the Sintering-Redispersion Kinetic Model.

Assuming that the kinetic functions of redispersion,ψR, and sintering, ψS, depend on the operating con- ditions, temperature and atmosphere, it can be written that ψR = kR0 exp

on sintering-redispersion has not been investigated. How- ever, it could also be included in both kinetic func- tions, ψR and ψS, in a similar manner as has been done for O2 and HCl. The above equations are empiric expressions based on power-law kinetics. However, LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics usually obtained from mechanistic developments can also be used [26].
Substituting the above expressions in Eq. (9), the evolution of DSS as a function of the operating condi- tions can be obtained.

ERS = ER ES
(17) The parameters α and β represent the observable or- ders of the residual dispersion with respect to HCl and O2, respectively. According to the above expressions,the values of α and β can be positive, zero or negative,depending on the relative values of the kinetic orders in Eqs. (14) and (15). The term ERS represents the observable activation energy for the parameter DSS.
Again, depending on the relative values of the activa- tion energies involved in the sintering and redispersion processes, the value of ERS can be positive, negative or zero.
As has been pointed out, the Sintering-Redispersion Kinetic Model must be able to explain both the sintering and the redispersion data. Thus, during sintering treatments it is logical to assume that KRS 1. This implies that in Eq. (16), the term

(18) Eq. (18) is mathematically equivalent to Eq. (4), but it should be emphasized that the parameters involved in Eq. (18) have a clear physical meaning. The term DT(kRS0pα HClpβ O2) in Eq. (18) is equivalent to the term (DS0pβ O2) in Eq. (4); and the parameter ERS in Eq. (18) is equivalent to the parameter QS in Eq. (4). Hence,the negative value for the parameter QS can be eas- ily explained by assuming that the sintering activation energy is higher than the corresponding activation en- ergy for the redispersion process. In addition, accord- ing to the Sintering-Redispersion Kinetic Model, the negative dependence of the residual dispersion with respect to oxygen implies that the kinetic order with respect to oxygen for ψS (exponent mS, Eq. (15)) is higher than that for ψR (exponent mR, Eq. (14)).
In order to calculate the kinetic parameters, ψR and ψS, we have used Eq. (13) to fit the experimental data displayed in Figs. 14. The results of these fittings are shown in Figs. 58. Figs. 5 and 6 show the effect of oxygen partial pressure and temperature on the val- ues of ψR and ψS during sintering treatments. Fig. 5 reveals that both parameters decrease as the oxygen Fig. 5. Influence of temperature on the sintering-redispersion kinetic parameters during sintering. concentration increases. This fact indicates that, under sintering conditions, the increase in oxygen concen- tration inhibits not only the sintering step, as already pointed out by our previous Sintering Kinetic Model [16], but also inhibits the redispersion step. Probably both phenomena are the consequence of the stabiliza- tion of Pt+4 surface species at high oxygen concen- trations [16]. However, ψS has higher values than ψR and therefore the sintering process prevails over redis- persion. Regarding the effect of temperature, Fig. 6 shows that both parameters increase with the tem- perature following an Arrhenius-type dependence. In this figure, the values of ψG and DSS, calculated us- ing Eqs. (8) and (9), are also represented. It can be seen that both terms also follow Arrhenius-type de- pendences (in the case of DSS a negative dependence) indicating that the approximation followed in Eq. (18) is correct.
As regards the redispersion results, the influence of oxygen and HCl concentrations on ψR and ψS during redispersion treatments is shown in Figs. 7 and 8.
In Fig. 7 it can be seen that an increase of pO2 does not modify the value of ψR but strongly diminishes ψS. Therefore, the main effect of O2 during redisper- sion is the inhibition of the intrinsic sintering rate,having little effect on the redispersion step. Paradoxi- cally, both facts result in a net process of redispersion as shown in Fig. 3. 286

In Fig. 8 it is shown that an increase of pHCl pro- duces a slight decrease on the intrinsic rate of sinter- ing, but strongly increases the intrinsic rate of redisper- sion. Consequently, the most important effect of HCl during the redispersion experiments is the promotion of the redispersion process, while the sintering step is Fig. 7. Influence of pO2 on the sintering-redispersion kinetic parameters during redispersion. only slightly inhibited. Accordingly, both facts result in a net process of redispersion as shown in Fig. 4.
In our experimental conditions during sintering treatments, the kinetic functions of sintering and re- dispersion only depend on the temperature and oxy- gen concentration. Therefore, Eqs. (14) and (15) are

(20) In the above equations 823 K was used as the reparametrization temperature and therefore kR0 and kS0 correspond to the values of ψR and ψS at this temperature.
As regards redispersion treatments, given that the temperature was kept constant during these experi- ments, ψR and ψS depend only on the HCl and oxy- gen concentrations. Therefore, in this case this depen- dence is expressed as ψR = kRpnR HCl (21) ψS = kSpnS HClpmS

(22) The intrinsic kinetic parameters of the sintering-re- dispersion model (kR0, kS0 ER, ES, mR and mS for sin- tering and kR, kS, nS, mR and mS for redispersion) can also be obtained by non-linear multivariable re- gression of experimental data using Eqs. (13), (19) and (20) for sintering and Eqs. (13), (21) and (22) for redispersion. The intrinsic kinetic parameters calcu- lated in this way are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
In addition, the solid lines in Figs. 14 show that the Sintering-Redispersion Kinetic Model satisfacto- rily fits all the data.
The values reported in Table 1 are in good agree- ment with the kinetic parameters previously obtained [18]. The negative dependence of Drr with respect to oxygen (Eq. (4), γ = 0.058) is related to the fact that both ψR and ψS decrease as the oxygen concentration increases (mR = 0.78, mS = 0.69), but the ki- netic order for redispersion is lower than for sintering (mR mS = 0.09). In addition, the values of both kinetic orders, mR and mS, are similar to the value of the parameter β in Eq. (3) (β = 0.51). As regards,the intrinsic kinetic constants, value of kS0 is nearly six times higher than the value of kR0, indicating the prevalence of the sintering over the redispersion under these working conditions.

Regarding the activation energies, the value of the parameter QS (38.61.3 kJ/mol) is also in quite good agreement with the difference between ES and ER (ES ER = 49.7 kJ/mol). Besides, the value of ED in Eq. (3) (157.8  8.2 kJ/mol) is of the same order as the activation energies for ψR and ψS (185.7 and
136.0 kJ/mol, respectively). These values are in agree-
ment with the values of activation energies involved in this type of process [11,14,20].
In Table 2 the parameters of Eqs. (21) and (22) are presented, corresponding to redispersion data. These parameters are in agreement with the results shown in Figs. 7 and 8. In this fitting the value of mR has been fixed to zero, according to the results presented in Fig. 7. However, to verify this assumption further, the experimental data were also fitted leaving the parame- ter mR free in the optimization procedure. In this case,the value of this parameter was mR = 0.0270.021,being therefore statistically non-different from zero.
This means that, in fact, ψR depends only on the HCl concentration (nR = 0.72). The negative exponents of ψS (nS = 0.69, mR = 0.73) indicate that the sin- tering process is strongly inhibited under these condi- tions.
Finally, it is important to note that, as far as we know, this is one of the few systematic studies on sintering and redispersion kinetics of supported metal catalysts reported in the literature, which allows for the establishment of a relationship between the intrinsic kinetic parameters and the operating conditions.
4. Conclusions
The sintering-redispersion of the metallic crystal- lites in Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts can be considered as a reversible phenomenon. According to this hypothesis a new Sintering-Redispersion Kinetic Model has been proposed. This model explains the results obtained by previous sintering models, and allows us to assign a physical meaning to the intrinsic kinetic parameters.
The proposed kinetic model fits satisfactorily all the experimental data obtained during the sintering and redispersion experiments, allowing the determination of the influence of the operating conditions on the dis- persion variation rate during sintering experiments as well as during redispersion experiments. The influence of the operating conditions is included in the main parameters of this model: ψR, the kinetic function of redispersion and ψS, the kinetic function of sinter- ing.The sintering experiments show that the net rate of sintering depends on temperature and oxygen con- centration. When the oxygen concentration increases,the net rate of sintering (ψS) decreases. However, the increase in oxygen concentration inhibits not only the sintering step but also inhibits the redispersion step,as a consequence of the stabilization of Pt+4 surface species at high oxygen concentrations. It was found that both kinetic functions, ψR and ψS, follow an Ar- rhenius law with the temperature.
The redispersion experiments show that the net rate of redispersion depends both on oxygen and HCl con- centrations. The main effect of O2 during redispersion is the inhibition of the intrinsic sintering rate, having little effect on the redispersion step. Finally, the most important effect of HCl during the redispersion exper- iments is the promotion of the intrinsic redispersion rate, having a little effect on the sintering step.
