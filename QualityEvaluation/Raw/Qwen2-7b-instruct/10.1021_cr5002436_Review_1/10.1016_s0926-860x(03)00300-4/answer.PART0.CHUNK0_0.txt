<p>In this paper we present a new kinetic model to study simultaneously the sintering and redispersion of metal supported catalysts. This model has been developed to explain the effect of the main operating conditions (i.e. the chlorine and oxygen concentration in the oxidizing atmosphere, the temperature, etc.) on the dispersion variation rate under simulated industrial conditions.</p>
<p>As regards the activation energies, the value of the parameter QS (38.61.3 kJ/mol) is also in quite good agreement with the difference between ES and ER (ES ER = 49.7 kJ/mol).</p>
