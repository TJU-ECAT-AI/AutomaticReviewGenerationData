[1] "The sintering-redispersion of the metallic crystal- lites in Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts can be considered as a reversible phenomenon."
[2] "The proposed kinetic model fits satisfactorily all the experimental data obtained during the sintering and redispersion experiments, allowing the determination of the influence of the operating conditions on the dis- persion variation rate during sintering experiments as well as during redispersion experiments."

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts are known for their efficiency in this process due to their ability to facilitate the conversion of olefins into higher value products without oxygen. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, offer a more robust and stable alternative, often with enhanced thermal resistance. Industrial applications of these catalysts vary significantly, with Platinum catalysts being crucial in petrochemical industries for the production of gasoline components and metal oxide-based catalysts being favored in the manufacturing of various chemical intermediates and fine chemicals. Recent developments in the field focus on enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts through advanced synthesis methods and alloying strategies. Potential advantages include improved efficiency, lower energy consumption, and reduced environmental impact.
