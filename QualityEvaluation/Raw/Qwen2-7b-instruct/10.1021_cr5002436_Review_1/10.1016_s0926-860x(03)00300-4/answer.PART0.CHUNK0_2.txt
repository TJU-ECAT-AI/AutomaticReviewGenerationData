[1] "Sintering experiments were carried out at constant temperature, varying the sintering time."
[2] "The effect of the oxygen concentration during redispersion of a sintered catalyst at a fixed HCl partial pressure is shown in Fig. 3."
[3] "In most cases, sintering and redispersion have been studied individually in spite of the fact that both processes can be considered as a part of a single process."
[4] "A new Sintering-Redispersion Kinetic Model has been proposed. This model explains the results obtained by previous sintering models, and allows us to assign a physical meaning to the intrinsic kinetic parameters."

1. Sintering experiments were conducted by altering the temperature while keeping the sintering time constant. 
2. The impact of oxygen concentration on the redispersion rate of a sintered catalyst was illustrated in Figure 3. 
3. Traditionally, sintering and redispersion processes have been analyzed separately despite being integral components of a unified process.
4. A novel Sintering-Redispersion Kinetic Model was introduced. This model elucidates findings from prior sintering models and enables the interpretation of intrinsic kinetic parameters' physical significance.

1. 在保持烧结时间不变的情况下，通过改变温度进行了烧结实验。
2. 图3展示了在固定氯化氢分压下，氧浓度对烧结催化剂的重新分散速率的影响。  
3. 以往，烧结和重新分散过程通常被单独研究，尽管它们实际上构成了一个整体过程的一部分。
4. 提出了一个新的烧结-重新分散动力学模型。该模型解释了先前的烧结模型的结果，并允许我们赋予内在动力学参数的物理意义。
