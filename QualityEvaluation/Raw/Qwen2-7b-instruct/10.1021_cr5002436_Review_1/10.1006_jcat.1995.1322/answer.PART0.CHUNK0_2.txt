Answer: Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, are known for their high activity and selectivity in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins under mild conditions. These catalysts often exhibit superior performance but may be more expensive and require precise control over reaction conditions. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are noted for their robustness and affordability. They are generally less sensitive to poisoning and offer better stability at elevated temperatures, making them suitable for large-scale industrial processes. Recent advancements aim to enhance the stability and efficiency of both types of catalysts to address challenges in terms of cost-effectiveness and environmental impact.
