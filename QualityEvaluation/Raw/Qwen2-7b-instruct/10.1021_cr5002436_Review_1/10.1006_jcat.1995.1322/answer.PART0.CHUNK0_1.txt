Answer: Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, are known for their high reactivity and stability in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. They offer superior activity and selectivity, though they are more costly and require more careful handling. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are less expensive and more durable, making them suitable for industrial applications where cost and reliability are paramount. Recent research has aimed to enhance the stability and efficiency of these catalysts through innovative synthesis techniques and composite material development. However, achieving a catalyst that is both economically feasible and highly effective continues to be an unresolved issue in the field.
