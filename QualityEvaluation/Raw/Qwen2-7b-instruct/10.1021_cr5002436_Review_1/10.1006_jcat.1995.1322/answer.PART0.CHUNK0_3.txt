[1] "Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, have been extensively used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their high activity and selectivity."
[2] "Metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides have also shown promise, especially in terms of stability and cost-effectiveness."
[3] "Recent developments have focused on improving the activity and selectivity of both types of catalysts through the use of supported catalysts and the incorporation of promoters."
[4] "In industrial applications, noble metal-based catalysts tend to offer higher activity but may require more rigorous handling due to their high cost."
[5] "Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, are often preferred for their lower cost and better resistance to poisoning, although they might not always achieve the same level of activity."

Noble metal-based catalysts, notably platinum, excel in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins due to their superior activity and selectivity. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have demonstrated potential, particularly in terms of stability and cost-effectiveness. Recent advancements have concentrated on enhancing the activity and selectivity of these catalysts through the use of supported catalysts and promoter incorporation. In industry, noble metal-based catalysts typically provide higher activity but necessitate more stringent handling because of their high cost. Metal oxide-based catalysts, favored for their lower cost and resistance to poisoning, may not always match the same level of activity.

贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，由于其高活性和选择性，在轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢反应中被广泛使用。金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，也显示出潜力，尤其是在稳定性和成本效益方面的表现。最近的发展集中在通过负载催化剂和引入促进剂来提高这两种催化剂的活性和选择性。在工业应用中，贵金属催化剂通常提供更高的活性，但因其成本高昂，需要更严格的处理。相比之下，金属氧化物催化剂因其较低的成本和抗毒性强而受到青睐，尽管它们可能无法达到相同的活性水平。
