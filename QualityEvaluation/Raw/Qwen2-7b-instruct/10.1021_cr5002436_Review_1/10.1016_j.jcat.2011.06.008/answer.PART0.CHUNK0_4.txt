Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm.

<quotes>
Upon reduction at 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles. The average size of the Pt and PtIn particles is about 1 nm independent of the bulk In/Pt ratio of the catalyst.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
At a reduction temperature of 723 K, some of the In3+ ions near the support surface and close to the platinum are reduced, forming In atoms that combine with the supported platinum nanoparticles to create a PtIn bimetallic alloy. The average size of the platinum and PtIn particles remains around 1 nanometer regardless of the catalyst's bulk In/Pt ratio.

<quotes>
The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The efficiency of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts in ethane and propane dehydrogenation is significantly influenced by the bulk In/Pt ratio. The highest activity for both reactions is observed at a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, indicating a PtIn alloy that includes 12% indium.

<quotes>
The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios. Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
As the bulk In/Pt ratio rises from 0 to 0.48, the carbon buildup decreases most drastically, and the rate of decrease slows for higher In/Pt ratios. Ethane dehydrogenation loses only 0.1% of its initial activity in 2 hours, whereas propane dehydrogenation loses 20% of its initial activity over the same duration.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
当In/Pt比从0增加到0.48时，碳积累的减少最为显著，随着In/Pt比的增加，这种减少的速度逐渐放缓。在2小时内，乙烷脱氢仅损失初始活动的0.1%，而丙烷脱氢则损失初始活动的20%。

<quotes>
While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are created during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The site of this carbon accumulation is determined by the alkane being dehydrogenated.
