Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. Analysis of Pt LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data shows that the In content of the bimetallic particles increases with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature.

The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation.

During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles.

This document discusses the development of novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. These catalysts are created by dispersing Pt on a calcined hydrotalcite-like support that contains indium. The catalysts show high activity and selectivity, with the optimal In/Pt ratio being 0.48, resulting in a PtIn alloy containing approximately 12% In. This ratio maximizes the ethene and propene yield, reaching nearly 100%. Additionally, the alloying of In with Pt significantly reduces the carbon deposition during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. During ethane dehydrogenation, the carbon primarily accumulates on the support, while during propane dehydrogenation, a portion of the carbon accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles.

本文讨论了用于脱氢乙烷和丙烷的新型Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂的开发。这些催化剂通过在含有铟的煅烧水滑石样支持物上分散铂而制备。催化剂表现出高活性和选择性，最优的In/Pt比例为0.48，产生约12%的PtIn合金。此比例使乙烯和丙烯的产率最大化，接近100%。此外，In与Pt的合金化显著减少了乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中的碳沉积。在乙烷脱氢过程中，碳主要积累在支撑物上，而在丙烷脱氢过程中，部分碳积聚在PtIn纳米颗粒上。
