[1] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al, Mg(In)(Al)O."
[2] "Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles."
[3] "The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In."
[4] "The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation."

The document discusses the preparation of noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, particularly magnesium aluminum indium oxide (Mg(In)(Al)O), for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The composition of the catalysts involves dispersing platinum nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium and aluminum. Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, indium cations are reduced and form a bimetallic alloy with the platinum nanoparticles, enhancing the catalyst's performance. The effectiveness of the catalysts is highly dependent on the bulk indium-to-platinum (In/Pt) ratio, with the highest activity being achieved at a ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing approximately 12% indium. This ratio results in near-perfect selectivity towards ethene and propene, minimizing the formation of lower molecular products like methane and ethane. Indium alloying with platinum also significantly reduces carbon deposition during the dehydrogenation process, thereby preserving catalyst activity.

文档讨论了用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如铬氧化物、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的制备。催化剂的组成涉及将铂纳米颗粒分散在含有铟和铝的煅烧水滑石型支持材料（Mg(In)(Al)O）上。在温度高于723 K的还原过程中，支持表面附近的铟离子被还原，并与铂颗粒形成二元合金，提高了催化剂的性能。催化剂的有效性高度依赖于铟与铂（In/Pt）的比例，最大活性出现在比例为0.48时，相当于含约12%铟的PtIn合金。这一比例导致乙烷和丙烷脱氢产物几乎完全选择性地转化为乙烯和丙烯，显著减少了甲烷和乙烷等较低分子产品的生成。铟与铂的合金化还大大减少了脱氢过程中碳沉积，从而保持了催化剂的活性。
