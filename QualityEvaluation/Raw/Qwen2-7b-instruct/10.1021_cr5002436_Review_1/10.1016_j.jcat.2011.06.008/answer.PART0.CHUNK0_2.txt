Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. Analysis of Pt LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data shows that the In content of the bimetallic particles increases with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature.

The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation.

The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios. Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period.

The novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation showed high activity and selectivity when the bulk In/Pt ratio was 0.48, which resulted in a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. This ratio maximized the activity for both reactions, with nearly 100% selectivity for ethene and propene. The alloying of Indium with Platinum led to a significant decrease in carbon accumulation during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The amount of carbon accumulated decreased sharply as the bulk In/Pt ratio increased from 0 to 0.48, and more gradually for higher ratios. Only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation was lost in 2 hours, while 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation was lost over the same period.

新型的Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂在乙烷和丙烷脱氢反应中，当In/Pt比例为0.48时表现出高活性和选择性，形成含12%In的PtIn合金。这一比例使两种反应的活性达到最大，乙烯和丙烯的选择性接近100%。In与Pt的合金化导致了乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中碳积累的显著减少。碳积累量随着In/Pt比例从0增加到0.48而急剧下降，对于更高比例则逐渐下降。仅在2小时内，乙烷脱氢过程中的初始活性损失了0.1%，而丙烷脱氢过程中的初始活性损失了20%。
