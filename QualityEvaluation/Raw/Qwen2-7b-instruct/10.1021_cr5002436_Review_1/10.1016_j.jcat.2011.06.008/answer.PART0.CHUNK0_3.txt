[1] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al, Mg(In)(Al)O."
[2] "Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles."
[3] "The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio."
[4] "For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In."
[5] "The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48."
[6] "The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation."

1. Platinum and metal oxide-based catalysts are utilized in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts often include noble metals like platinum and metals such as chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. 
2. Platinum-based catalysts are highly effective in dehydrogenation reactions, but their efficiency can be enhanced by alloying with other metals like gallium, indium, and tin. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, offer a cost-effective alternative due to their resistance to sintering and high surface area.
3. Recent advancements focus on optimizing the composition of these catalysts to improve selectivity and stability. For instance, the introduction of indium into the catalyst system of magnesium aluminum oxide enhances the selectivity towards alkene production.
4. The effectiveness of these catalysts is strongly influenced by the bulk ratio of the promoting element to platinum. For optimal performance, the ratio is typically optimized to achieve the desired activity and selectivity.
5. The Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalyst system achieves the highest activity for a bulk indium-to-platinum ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing approximately 12% indium.
6. Alloying platinum with indium results in a significant reduction in carbon accumulation during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation processes.

1. 非氧化脱氢轻烯烃时，使用了铂和氧化物基催化剂。这些催化剂通常包括诸如铂这样的贵金属，以及镓、铟、铬、钒、锌和钼等金属的氧化物。
2. 铂基催化剂在脱氢反应中非常有效，但通过与其它金属如镓、铟、锡合金化可以提高其效率。而氧化物催化剂由于其抗结块性和高比表面积，提供了成本效益高的替代方案。
3. 最近的发展集中在优化这些催化剂的组成，以提高选择性和稳定性。例如，在镁铝氧化物中引入铟可以增强丙烯生成的选择性。
4. 这些催化剂的有效性受到促进元素与铂的比例影响。为了获得最佳性能，该比例通常被优化以实现所需的活性和选择性。
5. Pt/Mg(In)(Al)催化剂体系在0.48的批量铟到铂比率下达到最高活动性，对应于含约12%铟的PtIn合金。
6. 铂与铟的合金化导致了在乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中碳积累的显著减少。
