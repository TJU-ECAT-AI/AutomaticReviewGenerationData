The study examines the catalytic performance of Pt, PtSn, and PtGe supported on ZnAl2O4, synthesized by mechanochemical synthesis (MS) or coprecipitation (COPR). The focus is on their use in n-decane dehydrogenation to produce 1-decene. The research analyzes how the preparation methods and addition of Sn and Ge to Pt impact activity and selectivity. The findings suggest that adding Sn to the Pt phase alters not just catalytic properties, but also deactivation and stability. PtSn catalysts, especially those with higher Sn loadings, demonstrate superior activity and lower deactivation compared to PtGe catalysts. Catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS show a particularly stabilizing effect.

<p>One application of -monoolefins of high molecular weight is in the production of biodegradable detergents or ten- soactives.</p>
<p>This paper studies the production of 1-decene from the n-decane catalytic dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation of high paraffins to the corresponding n-monoolefins can take place on noble metals like Pt.</p>
<p>In consequence, it is very important to analyze the addition of modifiers (elements of the Group 14 like Sn and Ge).</p>
<p>Zinc aluminate is not reduced in the used range of temperature (25700 C).</p>
<p>The Sn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 catalyst profile shows a small but very wide reduction zone from 200 to 250 C to higher temperatures.</p>
<p>The main reduction peak of Pt is placed at 280300 C for the ZnAl2O4 MS support and at about 300 C for the ZnAl2O4 COPR one.</p>
<p>In the case of PtGe catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR and ZnAl2O4 MS (Fig. 5) two important reduction zones are observed, the first one with maxima at 220280 C and 300 C, respectively, and the sec- ond one has a maximum at about 550 C for both samples.</p>
<p>From XPS, TPR analysis and test reactions it can be concluded that the surface of reduced PtSn catalysts would be conformed by metallic platinum, Sn(II) and/or Sn(IV) in high concentrations (some of them in contact with Pt) and smaller quantities of metal- lic Sn probably in alloyed phases with metallic Pt.</p>
<p>In the case of catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR, the sec- ond metal addition decreases the hydrogen chemisorptions.</p>
<p>It can be observed that Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR and Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS showed a simi- lar average activity, the initial activity of Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalyst was slightly higher than that of Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS.</p>
<p>It can be concluded that all PtGe catalysts showed a higher deactivation than the corresponding PtSn for both supports.</p>
<p>As it was previously mentioned, undesirable side reactions and coke deposition can be important factors that influence the catalytic performance since for thermodynamic reasons it is necessary to use high temperatures.</p>
<p>In fact, the coke deposited on this catalyst is clearly lower than that deposited on the catalyst supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR, but their DP is higher than the second one, which means a higher toxicity of the carbon deposited on PtGe(0.3)/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst.</p>
<p>It must be noted that it is possible to determine average selectivities since the selectivity to each group of products slightly changes with the reaction time.</p>
<p>The light paraffins are produced by breaking of C C bonds, and they can be produced by two ways: (i) cracking via acid sites (cracking of olefins produced by dehydrogenation in the metallic phase) and (ii) hydrogenolysis catalyzed by metallic centers.</p>
<p>It is also observed that Sn or Ge addition to monometallic catalysts produces a decrease of the selectivity to [<C10], this effect being more pronounced for catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the second metal addition produces a poisoning effect on the acidity [3,60,66],which leads to bimetallic catalysts with low degradation capacity of the raw paraffin.</p>
<p>The aromatization reaction (dehydrocyclization of paraffins) is a fast and structure-sensitive one and it can be produced through a bifunctional mechanism, where the olefins produced on the metal can migrate to the acidic function for a further cyclization.</p>
<p>The addition of a second metal (Sn or Ge) to Pt would lead to a weak interaction olefins-metallic phase [3,51,62], which inhibits the consecutive dehydrogenation of the monoolefin.</p>
<p>Moreover, the lower acidity of ZnAl2O4 MS favours the dehydrogenation since it decreases the side undesirable reactions, like hydrocraking and polimerization.</p>
<p>In analyzing the selectivity to 1-decene of the catalysts supported on both ZnAl2O4 are shown in Fig. 13d.</p>
<p>It could be observed that the bimetallic catalysts were more selective to 1-decene than the corresponding monometallic ones supported on ZnAl2O4 MS and show lower deactivation.</p>
<p>These characteristics determine a good cat- alytic formulation.</p>

<p>1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents or tensitives. These catalysts are effective for converting high paraffins into corresponding monoolefins, but their performance can be enhanced by adding modifiers like tin (Sn) and germanium (Ge).</p>
<p>2. The study focuses on the production of 1-decene from n-decane catalytic dehydrogenation, utilizing noble metals like Platinum due to their ability to catalyze the reaction. The addition of modifiers such as tin and germanium is analyzed for their impact on activity, selectivity, and stability.</p>
<p>3. Zinc aluminate does not undergo reduction within the utilized temperature range (25700°C).</p>
<p>4. The addition of tin to the platinum metal phase not only modifies catalytic properties but also affects deactivation and stability. Platinum-tin catalysts on both spinels show higher activity and lower activity decline compared to platinum-germanium ones. The greater the tin loading, the more pronounced this effect is.</p>
<p>5. Platinum-tin catalysts supported on zinc aluminate by mechanical synthesis (MS) demonstrate a more stabilizing effect.</p>
<p>6. Unfavorable side reactions and coke deposition are significant factors influencing the catalyst's performance, especially at high temperatures. To mitigate these issues, the study employs zinc aluminate spinels, which are known for their low acidity and low coke formation rate.</p>
<p>7. The addition of a second metal (tin or germanium) to platinum increases the activation energy for dehydrogenation, suggesting electronic modifications likely due to alloy formation. This effect is more pronounced for platinum-tin catalysts when using mechanical synthesis (MS) as the support preparation method.</p>
<p>8. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher activity than monometallic ones, with lower deactivation. Among the bimetallic catalysts, platinum-tin catalysts supported on zinc aluminate show the lowest deactivation.</p>
<p>9. The study highlights that tin and germanium additions to platinum catalysts can significantly improve the catalytic performance for n-decane dehydrogenation, particularly in terms of selectivity and stability, compared to pure platinum catalysts.</p>
<p>10. The presence of tin or germanium modifies the interaction strength of olefins with the metallic sites, thereby maintaining a metallic surface with a low amount of coke, which is beneficial for the dehydrogenation process.</p>

<p>It must be noted that the comparison of the cat- alytic behavior of monometallic catalysts supported on the ZnAl2O4 spinel prepared by COPR, MS and ceramic method (CM) was previ- ously reported in the bibliography by Ballarini et al. [36]. The Pt catalysts prepared with ZnAl2O4 COPR presented better activity and selectivity (in the reaction of n-butane dehydrogenation) than the ones prepared with ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 CM, and this could be correlated with a higher metallic dispersion and lower particle sizes, detected by H2 chemisorption and TEM, respectively.</p>
<p>The addition of Sn to the Pt metal phase modifies not only the catalytic properties, but deactivation and stability as well.

<p>In analyzing the selectivity to 1-decene of the catalysts with the reaction time, the fall of the initial selectivities in the monometallic catalysts were higher than for the corresponding bimetallic ones,independently of the support.

1. The Pt catalysts prepared with ZnAl2O4 COPR exhibited superior activity and selectivity in n-butane dehydrogenation compared to those prepared with ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 CM. This was associated with enhanced metal dispersion and reduced particle sizes, as evidenced by H2 chemisorption and TEM analysis.
2. Adding Sn to the Pt phase altered not just catalytic properties but also deactivation and stability. PtSn catalysts demonstrated higher activity and lower deactivation than PtGe counterparts, especially with increased Sn loading. PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS showed particularly stabilizing effects.
3. The decline in initial selectivity for monometallic catalysts was greater than for bimetallic catalysts across different supports, likely due to higher carbon deposition on monometallic systems compared to bimetallic systems.
4. The PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst had a slightly lower yield to 1-decene compared to the PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR counterpart, despite its enhanced stability over time and lower deactivation. These features contributed to a favorable catalytic formulation.

1. ZnAl2O4 COPR制备的Pt催化剂在n-丁烷脱氢反应中的活性和选择性优于ZnAl2O4 MS和ZnAl2O4 CM制备的催化剂。这与金属分散度的提高和颗粒尺寸的降低有关，这些通过H2吸附和TEM分析得出。
2. 向Pt相中添加Sn不仅改变了催化性能，还影响了催化剂的失活和稳定性。PtSn催化剂的活性高于PtGe催化剂，尤其是在不同支持下，随着Sn负载量的增加，这一效果更为明显。在ZnAl2O4 MS上支持的PtSn催化剂表现出特别的稳定化效果。
3. 与不同的支持物相比，单金属催化剂的初始选择性下降幅度大于双金属催化剂，这可能是因为单金属系统中较高的碳沉积与较低的碳沉积在双金属系统中。
4. PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS催化剂对1-癸烯的产率略低于PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR催化剂，尽管其在反应时间内的稳定性更高且降解更低。这些特性为一种有利的催化配方奠定了基础。
