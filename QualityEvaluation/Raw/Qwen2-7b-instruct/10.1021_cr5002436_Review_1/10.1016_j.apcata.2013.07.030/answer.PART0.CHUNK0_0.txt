<p>These detergents were initially produced by alkylation of benzene with tetramers of propene (a mixture of C10C12 highly branched olefins) followed by sulfonation and neutralization with NaOH.</p>
<p>In the present paper monometallic (Pt) and bimetallic (PtSn and PtGe) catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 obtained by both mechanochemical synthesis (MS) or coprecipitation (COPR) are evaluated in the n-decane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The effect of the Sn or Ge loading added to Pt is also studied, in order to correlate the properties of the support with the physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts and the catalytic properties.</p>
<p>In analyzing the selectivity to 1-decene of the catalysts with the reaction time, the fall of the initial selectivities in the monometallic catalysts were higher than for the corresponding bimetallic ones, independently of the support.</p>

1. The literature discusses the production of 1-decene from n-decane dehydrogenation using noble metal-based catalysts, specifically platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as chromium oxide, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. It compares their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field.

2. The paper focuses on evaluating monometallic (Pt) and bimetallic (PtSn and PtGe) catalysts supported on zinc aluminum oxide (ZnAl2O4) obtained through mechanochemical synthesis (MS) or coprecipitation (COPR) methods in the n-decane dehydrogenation process.

3. The study investigates the impact of adding tin (Sn) or germanium (Ge) to platinum in order to correlate the properties of the support with the physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts and their catalytic performance.

4. The paper analyzes the decline in initial selectivity to 1-decene over time for monometallic catalysts compared to bimetallic catalysts, regardless of the support type.
