The effect of preparation methods and Sn and Ge addition to Pt on the activity and selectivity was analyzed. The catalytic characterization was carried out by using XRD, Specific surface area,2-propanol dehydration reaction, equilibrium pH, cyclohexane dehydrogenation (CHD), cyclopentane hydrogenolysis (CPH), TPR, H2 chemisorption, XPS, TPO, and TEM. Characterization studies indicate that the addition of Sn to the Pt metal phase modifies not only the catalytic properties, but deactivation and stability as well. PtSn catalysts on both spinels were more active, with lower activity fall than PtGe ones and the higher the Sn loading, the more noticeable this effect. Besides, PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS showed a more stabilizing effect. 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
1. Introduction
Olefins are very important raw materials in the petrochemical and petroleum refining industries due to their applications in sev- eral processes. One application of -monoolefins of high molecular weight is in the production of biodegradable detergents or ten- soactives. This industry has become very important as well, since dodecylbenzene was found to have better properties than soaps.
These detergents were initially produced by alkylation of benzene with tetramers of propene (a mixture of C10C12 highly branched olefins) followed by sulfonation and neutralization with NaOH.
This process had the problem of the lack of biodegradability of the detergents [1,2]. A new process that appeared in the mid 60s, was the production of sodium alkylbenzenesulfonate. This compound has an aliphatic linear chain of C10C14 [3,4] which allows a fast biodegradation. These biodegradable detergents are obtained by alkylation of benzene with linear -monoolefins of C10C14. The production of the biodetergents at industrial scale was successful,thus displacing the preceding technologies. In this way the produc- tion of linear alkylbenzene or linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAB or LABS) increased significantly [3,4].
This paper studies the production of 1-decene from the n-decane catalytic dehydrogenation. The dehydrogenation of high paraffins to the corresponding n-monoolefins can take place on noble metals Corresponding author. Tel.: +54 342 455 5279; fax: +54 342 453 1068.

(Group 10) like Pt. This reaction is normally accompanied by unde- sirable side ones such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, aromatization and coke formation. In consequence, it is very important to analyze the addition of modifiers (elements of the Group 14 like Sn and Ge),which can affect the activity, selectivity and stability of the cata- lysts [310]. Furthermore the coke deposition can be diminished by using H2 in the feed [11]. In the present paper monometallic (Pt) and bimetallic (PtSn and PtGe) catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 obtained by both mechanochemical synthesis (MS) or coprecipita- tion (COPR) are evaluated in the n-decane dehydrogenation. The specific surface area of ZnAl2O4 can be improved choosing the appropriate synthesis method. In general, there are several prepa- ration methods of ZnAl2O4 spinels, for example solid state-reaction or ceramic method [1219] or wet chemical routes such as precipi- tation or coprecipitation [1214,2024], solgel [1214,2528] and other methodologies like hydrothermal methods [2933], com- bustion in aqueous solution [34], molten salts synthesis [35], etc.
These techniques try to reduce the severity of the thermal treat- ments, thus achieving a material of higher specific area and higher chemical purity. It must be noted that the comparison of the cat- alytic behavior of monometallic catalysts supported on the ZnAl2O4 spinel prepared by COPR, MS and ceramic method (CM) was previ- ously reported in the bibliography by Ballarini et al. [36]. The Pt catalysts prepared with ZnAl2O4 COPR presented better activity and selectivity (in the reaction of n-butane dehydrogenation) than the ones prepared with ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 CM, and this could be correlated with a higher metallic dispersion and lower particle sizes, detected by H2 chemisorption and TEM, respectively.

reason, in this paper, ZnAl2O4 prepared by mechanochemical syn- thesis and coprecipitation was used as support of metallic catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.
With reference to this topic, there are no papers in the open liter- ature about bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 for n-decane dehydrogenation, specially the use of couples composed of Pt and Ge on these supports. It must be remembered that ZnAl2O4 has a spinel structure which is appropriated for this reaction type due to the high thermal stability, neutral acid-base characteristic and low Pt sintering rate since there is a strong metalsupport interaction [3739]. Bhasin et al. [40] studied that the unmodified alumina- supported platinum catalysts are highly active but not selective to dehydrogenation. They showed a simple reaction scheme for light paraffins dehydrogenation, but the complexity of the reaction increases when the number of C atoms in the reactant increases.
In this paper the effect of the Sn or Ge loading added to Pt is also studied, in order to correlate the properties of the support with the physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts and the catalytic properties.
2. Experimental
In the mechanochemical synthesis of the ZnAl2O4 (MS), -Al2O3 (CK 300, 99.9% from Cyanamid Ketjen) and ZnO (AnalaR, 99.7%) were ground until fine powder and they were mixed in a stoicho- metric ratio. Then distilled water was added in order to produce a paste. The paste was ground by using a grinded that consists of a teflon cylinder of 140 mL and zirconia balls with a diameter of 13 mm. The cylinder rotated at 200 rpm in contact with air at room temperature for 12 h. The paste thus obtained was dried at 120 C and calcined at 900 C for 12 h. After obtained the precursor of ZnAl2O4, a purification step was achieved by washing the pre- cursors with (NH4)2CO3 1 M to eliminate residues of ZnO. The ratio volumen of solution/mass of solid was 1.5 mL/g.
ZnAl2O4 COPR was prepared by coprecipitation of the two metallic ions (Zn and Al) at variable pH. The precipitation was made by using Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Baker, 98.9% and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Baker,99,0%. Finally the pH was adjusted at 7.5 by using a NH4(OH) 50% (v/v). After precipitation under stirring at 50 C a gel is obtained.
This gel was aged for 24 h and then washed with distilled water until total elimination of ammonia. Finally it was dried at 120 C and calcined at 800 C under air flow for 8 h.
The different samples (powders) of the support were analyzed in a XRD Diffractometer Shimadzu using a CuK radiation, volt- age: 30 kV, current: 30 mA, divergence and dispersion: 2, using the following diffraction angle range: 1080, and scanning in a continuous way.
The determination of specific surface area and pore volume was carried out by using an Accusorb equipment, Model 2100 E from Micromeritics. Samples were outgassed at 200 C and 104 mmHg for 2 h. The dead volume was determined by using He (from AGA,
99.999%) at the temperature of liquid N2 (77 K). N2 isotherms were
obtained at 77 K.The 2-propanol dehydration reaction (used for the measure- ment of the acid character of the samples) was made in a continuous flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. 2-propanol was vaporized in a H2 flow (H2/2-propanol molar ratio = 19) and it was fed with a space velocity of 0.52 mol alcohol h1 g cat1. Catalysts were previ- ously reduced in situ at 500 C for 3 h under flowing H2. The mass of the sample was 0.100 g, the reaction temperature was 210 C and feeding flow was 600 mL min1. The reaction products were analyzed by GC using a Carbowax 20 column, 2 m length × 1/8.
The determination of equilibrium pH of the aqueous suspension of the support (10 mL water g of support1) was performed fol- lowing the technique reported by Romn-Martnez et al. [41]. The suspension was stirred and the pH was measured until it reached a constant value.
The monometallic Pt (0.3 wt.%) catalyst was prepared by impregnation (6 h, 25 C) of the corresponding support (ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 COPR) with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (Aldrich 99%). The concentration of the H2PtCl6 solution was such as to obtain the desired Pt loading. The impregnating volume/support weight ratio was 1 mL g1 for ZnAl2O4 MS and 0.7 mL g1 for ZnAl2O4 COPR. After 6 h, the samples were dried at 120 C for 12 h and calcined in air at 500 C for 3 h.
Bimetallic PtSn catalysts were obtained by impregnation of the monometallic Pt catalyst (previously dried) with a SnCl2 solution (in an HCl 1.2 M medium). In all the cases the Pt concentration was
0.3 wt.%. The Sn concentrations in the impregnating solution were
0.0253 and 0.042 mol L1 Sn for 0.3 and 0.5 wt.% loading, respec-
tively. After impregnation with Sn, samples were dried at 120 C for 12 h.
Bimetallic Pt-Ge catalysts were also obtained by impregna- tion of the monometallic Pt catalyst (previously dried) with an aqueous solution of GeCl4 (dissolved in HCl 1M). The Pt con- centration in the catalysts was 0.3 wt.%. The Ge concentrations in the impregnating solutions were 0.025 and 0.04 mol L1 for the Ge loading of 0.18 and 0.3 wt.%, respectively. After impreg- nation with Ge the samples were dried at 120 C for 12 h. Finally bimetallic samples were calcined at 500 C for 3 h under flowing air.
TPR experiments of the catalysts were carried out at atmo- spheric pressure and using a reductive mixture of H2-N2 (5% H2 v/v, 10 cm3 STP min1), and a heating linear programming rate of the sample (0.300 g) equal to 6 K min1 from room temperature up to 700 C. Before the TPR measurements the samples were calcined in situ at 500 C with flowing air 160 mL min1 g cat1 for 3 h.
The H2 chemisorption was performed at 25 C in a static vol- umetric equipment. The sample used in the experiments ranged between 0.300 and 0.500 g. In these experiments the catalysts were previously reduced in H2 at 500C for 2 h, then outgassed under high vacuum (105 Torr) at the same temperature for 2 h and finally cooled down to room temperature. The H2 adsorption isotherms were performed at room temperature between 0 and 100 Torr.
The isotherms were linear in the range of used pressures and the H2 chemisorption capacity was calculated by extrapolation of the isotherms to zero pressure.
The cyclohexane (CH) dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a differential flow reactor fed at 6 mL h1 with a H2  CH mix- ture (H2/CH molar ratio = 26). Previous to the reaction the catalysts were reduced in situ under flowing H2 at 500 C for 3 h at the reaction temperature indicated in each case. The reaction prod- ucts were analyzed by GC using a Chromosorb column at 60 C. The activation energies were obtained from the slope of the curve ln R0 vs 1/T (T  temperature, K). R0 was calculated from the conver- sion obtained at three different temperatures. The sample mass was chosen to obtain a conversion less than 5%, condition in which the reactor can be considered as a differential one. For the cyclopentane (CP) hydrogenolysis reaction, the catalyst samples were previously reduced in situ under flowing H2 at 500 C for 3 h. The reaction was performed in a differential flow reactor fed at 6 mL h1 with H2  CP mixture (H2/CP molar ratio = 26). The reaction tempera- ture was 500 C. The reaction products were analyzed by GC using a Chromosorb column at 25 C.
The XPS spectra were obtained in a spectrometer Specs, by using MgK or AlK (for Ge determination at high BE) sources at 1253.6 or 1486.6 eV, respectively. Other conditions were: power of 100 W (10 kV and 10 mA) and the pressure of the analysis chamber was
4.1010 Torr. Before XPS, samples were previously reduced in H2 at
530 C for 3 h. The BE were referred to the Al2p peak (74 eV). Spec- tra were obtained by using the SpecsLab software. The peak areas

were estimated by means of a combination of Lorentzian-Gaussians curves in a different proportion and using Casa XPS software.
Transmission electron micrographs of the reduced catalysts were taken by using a JEOL 100CX microscope with a nominal resolution of 6 A, operated with an acceleration voltage of 100 kV,and magnification ranges of 80,000× and 100,000×. The specimens were introduced into the microscope column. For each catalyst,a very important number of Pt particles were observed and the distribution curves of particle sizes were done.
To quantify the carbonaceous deposits,the profiles of temperature-programmed oxidation before and after the n-decane dehydrogenation reaction were determined using the thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA) technique. The experiments were carried out on the SDTA Mettler STARe. Fresh (used as a reference) and used catalysts were stabilized under N2 flow at 250 C for 1 h before starting the TPO experiments. The samples (0.010 g) were heated at 5 C min1 from 250 to 500 C under air flow.
The n-decane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a flow reactor. The reactive mixture (n-C10-H2) is prepared in situ in the desired proportion by using a mass flow control for H2 and a Sage syringe pump for n-C10. This mixture was vaporized before injected to the reactor. All the gases were high purity (99.95% min- imum) ones. The liquid effluent obtained by condensation of the outlet of the reactor was analyzed in a Varian STAR 3400 CX chro- matograph with a FID detector and a capillary column CP-Sil-PONA CB, 50 m length, 0.2 mm diameter and 0.5 m of the film thickness.
The working temperature of the column was 250 C.
In order to determine the conversion and selectivity values, frac- tions of the liquid product were sampled at 10 min of the reaction beginning and then at intervals of 15 min until 130 min of total reaction time. By using the chromatographic analysis, five groups of compounds were identified according to the retention time:(1) Light paraffins of C5C10 from the cracking reactions, [<C10]. (2) n-decane (used as reference peak), [n-C10]. (3) 1-decene or -monoolefin of C10, [1-C10 = ]. (4) Others monoolefins (positional isomers) and conjugated diolefins and not conjugated, n-dienes, n-trienes,[C10=] (except 1-decene). (5) Non linear chains including ramified chains, isoparaffins, iso- olefins, cyclization products, aromatics, alkyl aromatics, etc.),[i-c-C10].It must be indicated that in all cases the liquid yield (<C5) was in the range of 9798%. In previous experiments it was found that a feeding of a mixture of n-decane and hydrogen with a H2/C10H22 = 4 molar ratio decreased the catalyst deactivation that allows the reac- tion evolution to be controlled. Other operating conditions were: T = 465 C, P = 1 atm, LHSV (h1) = 40 and weigth of catalyst = 0.35 g.The n-decane conversion was calculated as the sum of the per- centages of the chromatographic areas of all the reaction products affected by the corresponding response factors, except for H2.The selectivities to different group of products (j) were defined as follows: Sj = mol product/ mol product j (except H2).The yield to 1-decene was defined as: Y1-decene = conversion × selectivity to 1-decene.Fig. 1. XRD of the ZnAl2O4 obtained by coprecipitation. (a) Precursor and (b) pre- cursor calcined at 800 C.Conversions, selectivities and yields were calculated at different reaction times (10130 min). It is worth noticing that even though the catalysts were tested at conversions between 2 and 13%, no important selectivity changes were obtained at different conver- sions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of supports
Table 1 shows the results of specific surface area (SBET) and pore volumen (Vpore) of ZnAl2O4 prepared by different methods. It can be observed that the SBET of the ZnAl2O4 COPR is about two times higher than ZnAl2O4 MS one. These supports were treated under milder conditions than ZnAl2O4 prepared by the ceramic method,which displayed a lower specific surface area (about 11 m2 g1) [36]. It must be noted that assuming a Gaussian distribution of pore sizes, the average pore sizes are similar for ZnAl2O4 COPR and ZnAl2O4 MS.
Fig. 1 shows the XRD spectra after each step of the preparation of ZnAl2O4 COPR. The XRD of the precursor shows the presence of an amorphous solid (Fig. 1a) and after calcination at 800 C, it clearly shows a spinel structure [42] without impurities (Fig. 1b).
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the precursor obtained by MS (2a), calcined precursor (2b) and purified sample (after drying with aqueous solution of ammonium carbonate) (2c). Fig. 2a displays only peaks corresponding to ZnO and -Al2O3. After calcination,characteristic peaks of ZnAl2O4 are mainly produced and small lines (traces) of ZnO and -Al2O3 (Fig. 2b). When the calcined precursor is purified, only XRD lines of ZnAl2O4 are detected (Fig. 2c). In all calcined samples the XRD peaks of ZnAl2O4 are related to the fol- lowing planes: (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (3 3 1), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), (4 4 0),(6 2 0) and (5 3 3).

Fig. 2. (a) XRD of a mixture between ZnO and -Al2O3 submitted to a wet grinded (12 h) after calcination (without purification) and (c) after purification (c). all cases the reaction produces propylene. It must be noted that -Al2O3 has Lewis acidity [43] and subsequently the 2-propanol conversion is high (about 20%). With reference to ZnAl2O4 sam- ples, they show a lower dehydration capacity, evidenced by the low acidity of these supports. However ZnAl2O4 COPR shows a slightly higher conversion than ZnAl2O4 MS, and consequently the last sample has the lowest acidity.
Equilibrium pHs of the spinels obtained by different methods were 8.28.6, these values being in agreement with the very low acid character [44] of the supports according to the dehydration of 2-propanol reaction results.
3.2. Characterization of the metallic phase
Tables 2 and 3 show initial rate (R0CH) and activation energy values for cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction at 400 C (structure-insensitive reaction [45,46]) and also initial reaction val- ues from cyclopentane hydrogenolysis reaction (R0CP) at 500 C Fig. 3. 2-propanol conversion in the dehydration reaction for -Al2O3 (reference), ZnAl2O4 COPR and ZnAl2O4 MS.
(structure sensitive reaction) [4749] for Pt, PtSn and PtGe catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 COPR. When a second metal is added to a Pt catalyst, two effects can take place, viz, the geomet- ric one, this being the blocking and/or dilution of the Pt active atoms by the second metal, and the electronic one that modifies the elec- tronic structure of the Pt. It can be observed From Tables 2 and 3 that monometallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 COPR show similar activation energy values. The Sn or Ge addition increases the activation energy, this indicating a certain electronic modification of the metallic phase probably by alloy formation. This electronic effect seems to be more pronounced for Sn containing catalysts than Ge containing ones when ZnAl2O4 MS is used as sup- port. For ZnAl2O4 COPR series there are small differences in the activation energies. Besides, the second metal addition decreases R0CH values in about one order of magnitude. It can be concluded that the addition of either Sn or Ge to Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts decreases the dehydrogenation activities thus showing a blocking geometric effect by Sn or Ge that decreases the number of exposed Pt atoms and also electronic effects as it was above mentioned.
On the other hand, the cyclopentane hydrogenolysis reaction is influenced by the size and structure of the metallic particles.
Besides a special arrangement of surface active atoms are needed for this reaction to take place [50]. Results of this reaction are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Monometallic catalysts supported on both ZnAl2O4 supports show hydrogenolytic activities only from 500 C so it could be explained that these supports produce metallic structures with low density of edges and corners (active cen- ters for this reaction) [21,51]. In bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS or ZnAl2O4 COPR the second metal addition inhibits the hydrogenolytic reaction. This can be due not only to an electronic modification of Pt by Sn or Ge but also geometric effects. Sn or Ge addition decreases the concentration of metallic ensembles that the cyclopentane hydrogenolysis needs. Summarizing the results of both test reactions, the second metal introduces both geometric and electronic modifications in the metallic phase.
Fig. 4a and b shows the TPR profiles of PtSn (0.3 and 0.5 wt.%) cat- alysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 COPR. Monometallic Pt and Sn catalysts are also added for comparison. Fig. 5 shows the TPR profiles of PtGe (0.18 and 0.3 wt.%) catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS (a) and ZnAl2O4 COPR (b). The profiles of the monometallic catalysts are also included. Zinc aluminate is not reduced in the used range of temperature (25700 C) [14]. Fig. 4a shows that the Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst gives a well-defined reduc- tion peak at 260 C, whereas the corresponding peak of Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR is wider and it appears at about 300 C. These peaks would be caused by the reduction of oxychloride compounds formed during the impregnation with H2PtCl6 and successive thermal treatments [52]. The shift to higher temperatures for the ZnAl2O4 COPR- supported catalysts could be due both to smaller particle sizes and the modification of the Pt-support interaction [14]. For both sup- ports, the Sn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 catalyst profile shows a small but very wide reduction zone from 200 to 250 C to higher temperatures.
In bimetallic PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, the main reduction peak of Pt is placed at 280300 C for the ZnAl2O4 MS support and at about 300 C for the ZnAl2O4 COPR one. These shifts in the reduction tem- perature with respect to Pt monometallic catalysts together with certain widening of the peak could be attributed to a co-reduction of both metals that would form Pt-Sn alloys. Another wide and small peak at about 500550 C was observed, and it could correspond to the reduction of SnOx species. In PtSn/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalysts the same TPR peaks are observed, but shifted to higher tempera- ture. The peak at 550 C could be also due to the reduction of small quantities of free SnOx species stabilized in the support.
Fig. 5a and b shows TPR profiles of PtGe supported on ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 COPR. The Ge(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 catalysts supported on both ZnAl2O4 show a wide and poorly defined reduction zone that

begins at about 200 C and it is extended up to 700 C, which could be attributed to the reduction of Ge4+ [53] for both supports. In the case of PtGe catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR and ZnAl2O4 MS (Fig. 5) two important reduction zones are observed, the first one with maxima at 220280 C and 300 C, respectively, and the sec- ond one has a maximum at about 550 C for both samples. The main Pt reduction peak in the monometallic catalyst gets wider with Ge addition because of the co-reduction of Pt and Ge with probable alloy formation or a catalytic effect of metallic Pt on the second metal reduction in either case. The second peak could be caused by the reduction of GeOx species in the vicinity of the metallic Pt.
Table 4 shows chemisorption values for different samples. The hydrogen chemisorption of the Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR was higher than Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS. In general it was observed a decrease of the hydro- gen chemisorption in the bimetallic catalysts. These results agree with several authors [5456] that studied Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on Al2O3 and the results could be explained by synergy among three important factors: (i) electronic interactions between Pt and Sn with a probable alloy formation, which cannot chemisorb hydrogen, (ii) Sn surface enrichment which partially covers the Pt surface and (iii) blocking/dilution effect of Pt by Sn.
In the case of catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR, the sec- ond metal addition decreases the hydrogen chemisorptions. The second metal addition could not only form Pt-Sn or Pt-Ge alloys but also cover Pt crystallites with Sn or Ge, thus decreasing the H2 chemisorption capacity.

Fig. 7 shows the particle size distribution (from TEM experiments) of PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS and PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalysts. The particle size distributions (from TEM experi- ments) of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst were the following: 11.5 nm (34%), 1.52 nm (40%) and 22.5 nm (26%). The TEM characteri- zation of the PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalyst showed a particle size distribution of: 11.5 nm (57%), 1.52 nm (40%) and 22.5 nm (3.5%). In comparing the particle sizes of bimetallic catalysts with those of the monometallic ones, no noticeable differences were found which would indicate that the chemisorption decrease would not be caused by a particle size effect but electronic and/or geometric effects.
In order to determine the binding energies of Sn3d for PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS and PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalysts, and Ge3d for PtGe(0.3)/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalyst, XPS measurements were done. In both bimetallic catalysts, Pt4f signal had binding energies between 314.1 and 313.6 eV that belongs to metallic Pt.
Table 5 shows the binding energies and Sn/Pt and Ge/Pt surface atomic ratios from XPS analysis. It was not possible to discriminate between Sn3d5/2 binding energies of Sn(II) and Sn(IV) (486487 eV) since their values are very close [57]. XPS spectra (Sn3d5/2 sig- nal) of PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS and PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalysts showed two peaks. Sn would be in two oxidation states: as oxi- dized Sn species (one portion in contact with Pt, and the other one in contact with the support) and in a lower proportion in zerova- lent state, perhaps alloyed with Pt. It was found 26% of metallic Sn for PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst and 33% for PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 Fig. 6. TEM images of PtSn (0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 MS (a) and PtSn (0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalysts (b).

COPR catalyst. From Table 5 it can be observed an important surface enrichment of Sn since the Sn/Pt surface atomic ratio is higher, this being 35 for PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst and 36.5 for PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 COPR one.
From XPS, TPR analysis and test reactions it can be concluded that the surface of reduced PtSn catalysts would be conformed by metallic platinum, Sn(II) and/or Sn(IV) in high concentrations (some of them in contact with Pt) and smaller quantities of metal- lic Sn probably in alloyed phases with metallic Pt. No noticeable differences were found between the behaviour of both supports.
The
XPS
spectrum (Ge3d signal) was made for PtGe(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalyst. Ge 3d signal has a doublet at 3d3/2 and 3d5/2. It was not possible to determine the difference between Ge(II) and Ge(IV) species since there is a slight difference in their binding energies [58]. Ge3d signal of PtGe(0.3)/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalyst showed three peaks. A high proportion of Ge is in an oxidized state (Ge(II) (64%) and Ge(IV) (21%)), probably in contact with Pt or with the support, and 15% of Ge would be as Ge(0),probably alloyed to Pt as TPR and test reactions confirm. From Table 5 it can be observed that there is a surface Ge enrichment,since the Ge/Pt surface atomic ratio is 28.
Results of hydrogen chemisorption and cyclohexane dehydro- genation rate would be related to geometric effects of dilution and/or blocking of Pt by Sn and also the formation of alloys or intermetallic Pt-Sn compounds as it was observed from the test reactions rather than a particle size effect as confirmed by TEM.
Sn also exists as ionic species stabilized on the support. In the case of PtGe/ZnAl2O4 catalysts there are both electronic and geo- metrical (blocking and/or dilution) effects according to activation energy values, R0CH, R0CP and hydrogen chemisorption results.
These effects reduced the concentration of exposed Pt. The defined reduction signals in TPR for PtGe/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed that a fraction of Ge would be segregated and another part would be co- reduced with Pt and forming alloys. There would also be electronic effects as CHD reactions indicate. Besides, the alloyed particles exhibit low dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities.
3.3. Catalytic tests
Fig. 8 shows the initial and final n-decane conversion for bimetallic PtSn and PtGe catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 COPR. The behaviour of monometallic Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS and Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR are also included for comparison. It can be observed that Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR and Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS showed a simi- lar average activity, the initial activity of Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalyst was slightly higher than that of Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS. The bimetallic PtSn and PtGe catalysts show a higher activity than the corresponding monometallic Pt ones. It would be expected that the monometallic catalysts were more active than the bimetallic ones at the begin- ning of the reaction. However, if the carbon deposition in the first step of the reaction is higher in the monometallic catalysts than in bimetallic ones, the initial activity would decrease more rapidly in monometallic than in bimetallic samples. This coke deposition during the first 10 min of reaction time would produce a higher deactivation in Pt monometallic samples. It can be also observed Fig. 8. Initial n-decane conversion (X0)* and final n-decane conversion (Xf)* for PtSn (0.3 and 0.5 wt.%) and PtGe (0.18 and 0.3 wt.%) supported on ZnAl2O4 MS (a) and ZnAl2O4 COPR (b). *X0: at 10 min of the reaction time and Xf: at 130 min of the reaction time. that the initial activity (n-decane conversion) slightly increases as the Sn content increases for both supports. Similar behavior with respect to Ge content is obtained with the PtGe catalysts. Besides, PtSn catalysts were more active than the PtGe ones. Furthermore,the bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR were more active than those supported on ZnAl2O4 MS.
The results of catalyst deactivation measured by the DP values (defined as DP = 100 × (X0 Xf)/X0, where X0 and Xf are the ini- tial and the final n-decane conversions measured at 10 min and 130 min of the reaction time respectively) are shown in Fig. 9. It can be observed that the Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst (DP = 40.6%) has a lower decrease of activity than Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR one (DP = 56.6%).
This is in agreement with the total C deposited determined by TPO (0.75%C for Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR and 0.27%C for Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS).
These results indicate that the coke formation is an important fac- tor in the catalyst deactivation. It must be indicated that Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR had higher H2 chemisorption capacity, higher metallic dis- persion and lower particle size than Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS. This means that Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR has an important concentration of Pt sites which are active for dehydrogenation of large paraffins.
In the case of bimetallic catalysts, they had a lower deactiva- tion than the corresponding monometallic ones (except for PtGe (0.3)/ZnAl2O4 MS). Besides, it can be observed that bimetallic cat- alysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR had a higher deactivation than the ones supported on ZnAl2O4 MS. Moreover, PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 242

MS catalyst has the lowest DP, while PtGe(0.3)/ZnAl2O4 MS sample displays the highest deactivation of all bimetallic catalysts. It could be concluded that all PtGe catalysts showed a higher deactivation than the corresponding PtSn for both supports. This difference is more marked for the bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4
MS. For example, the DP for PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR is 38.7% while
for PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS is 19.4%. The addition of a second metal (Sn or Ge) increased the activation energy in CHD, thus indicating an electronic modification probable due to alloys formation. This effect was slightly more pronounced for PtSn catalysts than for PtGe ones when the support MS is used. Minor differences were found in bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR.
Fig. 10 shows the relationship between DP, previously defined,and the carbon content determined by TPO (at the end of the reac- tion) for different catalysts. It can be concluded that there is a good correlation between DP and the final coke content for the cata- lysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR. In the case of catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS it was not possible to obtain a good correlation between these parameters probably due to the low carbon content.
As it was previously mentioned, undesirable side reactions and coke deposition can be important factors that influence the catalytic Fig. 10. Relationship between the DP and the final carbon content (C%) for mono and bimetallic PtSn and PtGe catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR. performance since for thermodynamic reasons it is necessary to use high temperatures. When the formed olefin is strongly adsorbed on the metal through  bonds it is possible that the dehydrogenation continues, mainly at low H2 pressure. It must be also indicated that the polymerization reaction to coke can be catalyzed by both acidic and metallic centers. In the last case the hydrogenolysis reaction is a demanding one being carried out on the same metallic centers than the polymerization [40,59,60] reaction. In the case of monometal- lic Pt catalysts, the initial deactivation and the coke deposition is very important. These effects appear to be more important in Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR than in Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS. Additional determina- tions of carbon deposited (by TPO) at 10 min from the beginning of the reaction show a very important initial deposition of coke in monometallic catalysts. In fact, it was found that the initial carbon deposition was about 70% of the total carbon deposited on the cat- alysts at the end of the reaction for Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS. This deposited carbon would block the active centers for the hydrogenolisis reac- tion, thus favouring the dehydrogenation capacity, although the activity decreases. Simultaneously, the catalysts supported on Zn spinels show low coke formation rate since this support would lead to surface metallic structures with low density of edges and corners,which are the active sites for the hydrogenolysis reaction and coke formation [21,51].
The addition of the second metal decreases the amount of deposited carbon with respect to that of the monometallic ones.
Besides, the Sn or Ge addition to Pt favours the n-decane dehydro- genation to olefins, minimizing other undesirable reactions, since the electronic and geometric effects (which appear to be slightly higher for Sn than for Ge) are present. These effects can decrease the interaction strength of the olefins with the metallic sites, thus main- taining the metallic surface with low amount of the coke. This effect appears to be more pronounced when the second metal content increases. de Miguel et al. [61] found a similar effect for PtSn and PtGe catalysts supported on Al2O3 and MgO. Besides, TPO exper- iments of the PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS and PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR were made at 10 min of the beginning of the reaction too, and the results showed that the coke deposition was practically negligible (<0.1 wt.%), thus showing that the bimetallic PtSn catalysts had low initial deactivation in contrast to the monometallic ones.Fig. 11 shows the TPO profiles of Pt supported on ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 COPR at the end of the n-decane dehydrogenation reaction. It can be observed that the support has an important effect on the amount of deposited carbon. In fact, it is clearly noted that the Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst has lower carbon deposition than Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR one. Besides, the TPO of used Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS shows a burning peak at low temperature, which indicates that an important carbon fraction is deposited on the metal. On the other hand, the Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalyst shows that carbon is mainly deposited on the support.Fig. 12 displays TPO profiles taken at the end of n-decane dehydrogenation reaction for PtSn (0.5) (a) and PtGe (0.3) (b) cat- alysts supported both on ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 COPR. It can be observed not only the effect of the support but also the effect of the second metal addition. In the case of PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR it is observed a broad peak between 310 and 550 C, which corre- sponds to carbon deposited on the metallic function (although in minor proportion) and on the support (in a major quantity) [6265].In the case of the PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst, it was observed a low amount of carbon deposited on the metallic phase although with low toxicity according to the results above mentioned. From TPO profile of PtGe(0.3)/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalyst, it can be observed a peak with a maximum at 470 C which can be attributed to the burning of an important amount of coke mainly deposited on the support [6366]. In the case of the TPO profile of PtGe(0.3)/ZnAl2O4 MS, it can be observed a broad peak which begins at low tem- perature. This result would indicate that the important amount of

In fact, the coke deposited on this catalyst is clearly lower than that deposited on the catalyst supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR, but their DP is higher than the second one, which means a higher toxicity of the carbon deposited on PtGe(0.3)/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst.Fig. 13 displays the results of average selectivities (along the reaction time) to [<C10], [C10=] and to [i-c C10] in the n-decane dehydrogenation for mono and bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS y ZnAl2O4 COPR. It must be noted that it is possible to determine average selectivities since the selectivity to each group of products slightly changes with the reaction time.Fig. 13.

Fig. 13a shows the average selectivities (in the reaction time) to [<C10] in the n-decane dehydrogenation for mono and bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 COPR. The light paraffins are produced by breaking of C C bonds, and they can be produced by two ways: (i) cracking via acid sites (cracking of olefins produced by dehydrogenation in the metallic phase) and (ii) hydrogenolysis catalyzed by metallic centers [40,60,61]. Olefins are cracked or isomerized more quickly than linear paraffins. Taking into account the neutral characteristic of the supports, the reac- tions catalyzed by acid centres have a low participation. It must be noted that the selectivity to [<C10] is practically the same for both Pt monometallic catalysts, which is in agreement with the hydrogenolytic capacity of these catalysts. It should be remem- bered that the low acidity of both supports does not appear to play an important role in the reaction. It is also observed that Sn or Ge addition to monometallic catalysts produces a decrease of the selectivity to [<C10], this effect being more pronounced for catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS. Besides, PtSn catalysts are less selective to [<C10] than PtGe ones, mainly those supported on ZnAl2O4 MS.The lower selectivities to [<C10] of the bimetallic catalyst supported on ZnAl2O4 MS respect to the one supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR are due to the higher acidity of the last one. Furthermore, the second metal addition produces a poisoning effect on the acidity [3,60,66],which leads to bimetallic catalysts with low degradation capacity of the raw paraffin.The average selectivities to other monoolefins (except - monoolefin), diolefins, dienes, trienes, etc., [C10=] are shown in Fig. 13b. It must be indicated that these reactions are very fast and they are produced on the metallic phase. This Figure shows that Pt and bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS have higher selectivities to [C10=] than the same catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4
COPR. Besides, the Sn or Ge addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS or Pt/ZnAl2O4
COPR, does not produce an important modification of the selectivity to [C10=]. Furthermore, it is also observed that the Sn or Ge loading have slight influence on the selectivity to [C10=], and PtGe catalysts were slightly more selective than the PtSn ones, for both supports.
The average selectivities to non-linear chains (including branched chains, isoparaffins, iso-olefins, cyclization products, aro- matics, alkyl aromatics) [i-c C10], are shown in Fig. 13c. The aromatization reaction (dehydrocyclization of paraffins) is a fast and structure-sensitive one [40] and it can be produced through a bifunctional mechanism, where the olefins produced on the metal can migrate to the acidic function for a further cyclization. The mechanism of consecutive dehydrogenation, first on the metallic sites and then on the acidic ones can be represented by the follow- ing scheme:n-decanedecenearomatics dehydrogenation cyclization In this group of products [i-c C10] the isomerization products from the original paraffins are included. The isomerization (fast reaction) can be produced on the acidic sites of the supports and in a lower quantity on the metallic sites. It must be noted that the average selectivity to [i-c C10] for the Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst is slightly lower than for Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR one, and it is favoured by the higher acidity of the support. The average selectivities to [i-c C10] for bimetallic catalysts are higher than those of the corre- sponding monometallic ones, independently of the support. These surprising results would be not expected, and the explanation of these phenomena is that the average selectivities were calculated after 10 min of the reaction beginning. It must be considered that during the first 10 min of the reaction there is an important depo- sition of coke (both on the metal phase and the support) in the monometallic samples with respect to the bimetallic ones, which would inhibit in an important way the olefin formation, leading to isomerization and cyclization reactions in the monometallic cat- alysts and decreasing the selectivity to [i-c C10]. The bimetallic Fig. 14. Initial n-decane yield (Y0) and final n-decane yield (Yf)* for mono and bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 synthesized by MS (a) and COPR (b) methods. (*) Y0: at 10 min of the reaction time and Yf: at 130 min of the reaction time. catalysts show opposite effects where the cyclization is less affected than dehydrogenation by the second metal addition. In general,mono and bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR were more selective to [i-c C10] than those supported on ZnAl2O4 MS.
As regards the average selectivity to 1-decene of the catalysts supported on both ZnAl2O4 are shown in Fig. 13d. It could be observed that the bimetallic catalysts were more selective to 1- decene than the corresponding monometallic ones supported on ZnAl2O4 MS and show lower deactivation. The bimetallic cata- lysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR showed a higher selectivity to 1-decene than monometallic ones.
In analyzing the selectivity to 1-decene of the catalysts with the reaction time, the fall of the initial selectivities in the monometallic catalysts were higher than for the corresponding bimetallic ones,independently of the support. According to Fig. 6 the conversion level for the monometallic catalysts is lower than the bimetallic ones even for the initial conversion. This behaviour can be related to an important carbon deposition on monometallic catalysts in con- trast with the lower carbon deposition in the bimetallic systems as it was mentioned. With the Sn or Ge addition to Pt, the selectivity to 1-decene mainly in the catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS is increased. Sn and Ge produce electronic-geometric modifications of the metallic phase leading to a decrease of the hydrogenoltic capacity, thus increasing the selectivity to 1-decene. Besides, the lower acidity of ZnAl2O4 MS favours the dehydrogenation since it decreases the side undesirable reactions, like hydrocraking and polimerization. Moreover, the addition of a second metal (Sn or Ge) to Pt would lead to a weak interaction olefins-metallic phase [3,51,62], which inhibits the consecutive dehydrogenation of the monoolefin. This could be attributed to the modification of Pt ensembles by Sn or Ge (geometric and electronic effects), which decreases the olefins adsorption strength, thus avoiding the subse- quent transformation into dienes.

245 for different mono a bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 COPR and ZnAl2O4 MS. It can be observed that the Pt/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalyst has a higher yield to 1-decene than Pt/ZnAl2O4 MS one, although the final yields of both catalysts are similar. The bimetallic catalysts show higher yields with respect to those of the monometallic ones for both supports. However, PtGe catalysts have higher yields when the support is ZnAl2O4 COPR. This effect could be explained by the high conversion of these samples. Moreover,for both support types, the yield to 1-decene is higher for PtSn cat- alysts than for PtGe ones. With reference to the effect of the second metal loading on the yield to 1-decene, it is observed a positive one when the loading increases.
PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst has a yield to 1-decene slightly lower than that of PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR one, although the first catalyst is more stable with the reaction time and it has a lower deactivation. These characteristics determine a good cat- alytic formulation. The higher initial and final yields to 1-decene of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 COPR catalyst could be due to the more efficient promoter action of Sn which inhibits the undesirable side reactions due to geometric and electronic interactions.
4. Conclusions
It was possible to obtain ZnAl2O4 by mechanochemical syn- thesis (MS) or coprecipitation (COPR) with good surface area and low acidity to minimize subsequent reactions of the monoolefins formed during the n-decane dehydrogenation and low coke for- mation rate since these support surfaces lead to metal structures probably scattered on edges and corners. From the metallic char- acterization, PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts showed geometric effects of dilution and/or blocking of Pt by Sn and also the formation of alloys or intermetallic Pt-Sn compounds. In the case of PtGe/ZnAl2O4 cat- alysts there were both electronic and geometrical (blocking and/or dilution) reducing the concentration of exposed Pt. A Ge fraction would be segregated and another part would be co-reduced with Pt and forming alloys. Bimetallic catalysts were more active than monometallic ones with lower deactivation. PtSn catalysts on both spinels were more active, with lower activity fall than PtGe ones and the higher the Sn loading, the more noticeable this effect. Besides, PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS showed a more stabilizing effect.
