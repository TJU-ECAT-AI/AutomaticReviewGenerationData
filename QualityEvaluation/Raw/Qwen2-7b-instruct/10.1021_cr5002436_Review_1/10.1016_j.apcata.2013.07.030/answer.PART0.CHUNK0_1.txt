The study examines the catalytic performance of Pt, PtSn, and PtGe supported on ZnAl2O4, synthesized by mechanochemical synthesis (MS) or coprecipitation (COPR). The focus is on their use in n-decane dehydrogenation to produce 1-decene. The research analyzes how the preparation methods and addition of Sn and Ge to Pt impact activity and selectivity. The findings suggest that adding Sn to the Pt phase alters not just catalytic properties, but also deactivation and stability. PtSn catalysts, especially those with higher Sn loadings, demonstrate superior activity and lower deactivation compared to PtGe catalysts. Catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS show a particularly stabilizing effect.

研究了通过机械化学合成（MS）或沉淀法（COPR）合成的Pt、PtSn和PtGe在ZnAl2O4上对n-癸烷脱氢制备1-癸烯的催化性能。重点是它们的活性和选择性。研究分析了合成方法和向Pt中添加Sn和Ge对其活性和选择性的影响。发现向Pt相中添加Sn不仅改变了催化剂的性能，还影响了催化剂的失活和稳定性。与PtGe催化剂相比，PtSn催化剂，尤其是Sn负载更高的PtSn催化剂，在活性和失活方面表现更优。支持在ZnAl2O4 MS上的催化剂显示出特别的稳定效果。
