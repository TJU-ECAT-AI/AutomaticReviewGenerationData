<p>It must be noted that the comparison of the cat- alytic behavior of monometallic catalysts supported on the ZnAl2O4 spinel prepared by COPR, MS and ceramic method (CM) was previ- ously reported in the bibliography by Ballarini et al. [36]. The Pt catalysts prepared with ZnAl2O4 COPR presented better activity and selectivity (in the reaction of n-butane dehydrogenation) than the ones prepared with ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 CM, and this could be correlated with a higher metallic dispersion and lower particle sizes, detected by H2 chemisorption and TEM, respectively.</p>
<p>The addition of Sn to the Pt metal phase modifies not only the catalytic properties, but deactivation and stability as well. PtSn catalysts on both spinels were more active, with lower activity fall than PtGe ones and the higher the Sn loading, the more noticeable this effect. Besides, PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS showed a more stabilizing effect.</p>
<p>In analyzing the selectivity to 1-decene of the catalysts with the reaction time, the fall of the initial selectivities in the monometallic catalysts were higher than for the corresponding bimetallic ones,independently of the support. This behaviour can be related to an important carbon deposition on monometallic catalysts in con- trast with the lower carbon deposition in the bimetallic systems as it was mentioned.</p>
<p>PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst has a yield to 1-decene slightly lower than that of PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR one, although the first catalyst is more stable with the reaction time and it has a lower deactivation. These characteristics determine a good cat- alytic formulation.</p>

1. The Pt catalysts prepared with ZnAl2O4 COPR exhibited superior activity and selectivity in n-butane dehydrogenation compared to those prepared with ZnAl2O4 MS and ZnAl2O4 CM. This was associated with enhanced metal dispersion and reduced particle sizes, as evidenced by H2 chemisorption and TEM analysis.
2. Adding Sn to the Pt phase altered not just catalytic properties but also deactivation and stability. PtSn catalysts demonstrated higher activity and lower deactivation than PtGe counterparts, especially with increased Sn loading. PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 MS showed particularly stabilizing effects.
3. The decline in initial selectivity for monometallic catalysts was greater than for bimetallic catalysts across different supports, likely due to higher carbon deposition on monometallic systems compared to bimetallic systems.
4. The PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS catalyst had a slightly lower yield to 1-decene compared to the PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR counterpart, despite its enhanced stability over time and lower deactivation. These features contributed to a favorable catalytic formulation.

1. ZnAl2O4 COPR制备的Pt催化剂在n-丁烷脱氢反应中的活性和选择性优于ZnAl2O4 MS和ZnAl2O4 CM制备的催化剂。这与金属分散度的提高和颗粒尺寸的降低有关，这些通过H2吸附和TEM分析得出。
2. 向Pt相中添加Sn不仅改变了催化性能，还影响了催化剂的失活和稳定性。PtSn催化剂的活性高于PtGe催化剂，尤其是在不同支持下，随着Sn负载量的增加，这一效果更为明显。在ZnAl2O4 MS上支持的PtSn催化剂表现出特别的稳定化效果。
3. 与不同的支持物相比，单金属催化剂的初始选择性下降幅度大于双金属催化剂，这可能是因为单金属系统中较高的碳沉积与较低的碳沉积在双金属系统中。
4. PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 MS催化剂对1-癸烯的产率略低于PtSn(0.5)/ZnAl2O4 COPR催化剂，尽管其在反应时间内的稳定性更高且降解更低。这些特性为一种有利的催化配方奠定了基础。
