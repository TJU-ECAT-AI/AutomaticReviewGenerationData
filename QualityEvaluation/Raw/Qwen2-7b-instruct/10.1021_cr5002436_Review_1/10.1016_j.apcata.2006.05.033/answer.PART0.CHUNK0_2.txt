[1] "The additional hydrogen consumption peak at 530 °C on the sample 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another,less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
[2] "In the absence of platinum or after subsequent impregnation of the zeolite with both zinc and platinum, less active and less stable catalysts are obtained, e.g., the zeolites 4.2Zn,Na- mordenite and 0.5.Pt2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5, Na-mordenite (Fig. 6)."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as zinc, in the context of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, we find that platinum shows superior activity and stability. The presence of platinum allows for efficient conversion of propane to propene. On the other hand, metal oxide-based catalysts like zinc demonstrate reduced activity and stability compared to platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of zinc in the absence of or after platinum impregnation results in less active and less stable catalysts. This suggests that platinum plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and longevity of the catalysts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Recent developments in the field focus on optimizing the composition of these catalysts to achieve better performance and sustainability in industrial applications.

在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的背景下，将贵金属催化剂尤其是铂与锌等金属氧化物催化剂进行比较。我们发现，铂表现出更优越的活性和稳定性。铂的存在使得丙烷高效转化为丙烯成为可能。另一方面，锌基催化剂在活性和稳定性方面明显低于铂基催化剂。在缺少或在铂之后引入锌的情况下，催化剂活性和稳定性降低。这表明铂在提高催化剂性能和持久性方面起着关键作用。该领域的最新发展集中在优化这些催化剂的组成，以实现工业应用中的更好性能和可持续性。
