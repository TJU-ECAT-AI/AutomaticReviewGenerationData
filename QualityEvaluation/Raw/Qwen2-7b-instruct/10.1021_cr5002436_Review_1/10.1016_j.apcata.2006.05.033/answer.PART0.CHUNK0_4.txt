Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in the context of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the literature highlights several key differences. Platinum catalysts are noted for their high activity and stability under reaction conditions, making them highly effective in converting propane to propene. However, they are prone to sintering and require careful control of reaction parameters to maintain performance.

On the other hand, metal oxide-based catalysts, including zinc oxides, are generally less selective and less stable than their noble metal counterparts. They are often used as promoters or to adjust the acidity of the catalyst. Zinc oxide, for instance, is mentioned for its role in enhancing the dehydrogenation activity when combined with other metals or in the presence of platinum. It is observed to contribute to the formation of less noble species, which might affect the overall selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process.

In terms of industrial applications, noble metal-based catalysts are typically preferred due to their superior performance, although they come with higher costs. Metal oxide-based catalysts, while less efficient, are more affordable and can be used in combination with noble metals to optimize cost-effectiveness. Recent developments in the field involve the engineering of catalysts with improved stability and selectivity, aiming to enhance the efficiency of light olefin dehydrogenation processes.

The potential advantages of these catalysts lie in their ability to selectively convert light olefins into more valuable products, with a focus on reducing energy consumption and improving the environmental impact of chemical synthesis. The literature suggests that the choice between noble metals and metal oxides depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as cost constraints, desired product purity, and operational conditions.

比较在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃过程中，特别是铂基催化剂和以CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌、钼等金属氧化物为基础的催化剂之间的差异，文献中提出了几个关键的区别。铂基催化剂因其在反应条件下的高活性和稳定性而特别有效，能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。然而，它们容易发生聚集，并需要仔细控制反应参数来保持性能。

另一方面，金属氧化物催化剂，包括锌氧化物，在选择性和稳定性方面通常不如其贵金属同伙。它们通常用作促进剂或调整催化剂酸性。例如，提到锌氧化物在与其他金属结合或存在铂时增强脱氢活性的作用。它被观察到有助于形成不太贵重的物种，这可能会影响催化过程的整体选择性和效率。

就工业应用而言，贵金属基催化剂通常因其优越的性能而受到青睐，尽管成本较高。金属氧化物基催化剂，虽然效率较低，但成本较低，可以与贵金属结合使用，以优化成本效益。最近的研究涉及通过改进催化剂稳定性和选择性来提高催化性能，旨在增强轻烯烃脱氢过程的效率。

这些催化剂的优势在于能够选择性地将轻烯烃转化为更有价值的产品，重点关注降低能源消耗并改善化学合成的环境影响。文献表明，在特定应用需求（如成本限制、所需产品纯度和操作条件）下，选择贵金属与金属氧化物之间的差异。

答案总结了贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃中的不同特性、工业应用、最新进展及其潜在优势。
