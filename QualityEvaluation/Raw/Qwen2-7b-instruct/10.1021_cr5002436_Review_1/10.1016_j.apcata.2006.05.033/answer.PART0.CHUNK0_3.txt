[1] "The additional hydrogen consumption peak at 530 °C on the sample 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another,less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
[2] "In the absence of platinum or after subsequent impregnation of the zeolite with both zinc and platinum, less active and less stable catalysts are obtained, e.g., the zeolites 4.2Zn,Na- mordenite and 0.5.Pt2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5, Na-mordenite (Fig. 6)."

1. The study focuses on the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over PtZn-containing zeolites. The presence of zinc is indicated by an additional hydrogen consumption peak at 530 °C. The use of platinum leads to more active and stable catalysts compared to the absence of platinum or the presence of both zinc and platinum simultaneously.

1. 研究关注的是在含PtZn沸石上进行非氧化脱氢化丙烷。锌的存在由530°C时额外的氢消耗峰指示。与没有铂、或同时存在锌和铂的情况相比，使用铂导致更活跃和稳定的催化剂。

2. The document does not provide a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it highlights that platinum-based catalysts show higher activity and stability than those with both zinc and platinum simultaneously present. The document lacks details on the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalyst types.

2. 文档并未提供关于用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢化的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）之间的全面比较。然而，文档强调了仅含有铂的催化剂比同时含有锌和铂的催化剂具有更高的活性和稳定性。文档缺乏这些催化剂类型的具体组成、有效性、工业应用、最新进展以及潜在优势的详细信息。
