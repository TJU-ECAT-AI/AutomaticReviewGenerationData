[1] "The additional hydrogen consumption peak at 530 °C on the sample 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another,less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
[2] "The corrected table is reproduced below."
[3] "In the absence of platinum or after subsequent impregnation of the zeolite with both zinc and platinum, less active and less stable catalysts are obtained, e.g., the zeolites 4.2Zn,Na- mordenite and 0.5.Pt2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5, Na-mordenite (Fig. 6)."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the literature highlights several aspects:

1. Platinum-based catalysts exhibit specific peaks in hydrogen consumption at certain temperatures, indicating their presence and activity. For instance, the additional hydrogen consumption peak at 530°C on the sample 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 suggests the presence of another less noble species associated with zinc. This peak could be indicative of the unique reactivity profile of platinum.

2. The corrected table details the conversion of propane and selectivity for propene across various catalysts with different nSi/nAl ratios. This provides insights into the effectiveness of these catalysts under specified conditions, including time-on-stream, coke loading, zinc loss, and conversion percentages.

3. The text discusses the implications of removing platinum or adding both zinc and platinum to the zeolite structure. It notes that such changes result in less active and less stable catalysts, exemplified by the zeolites 4.2Zn,Na-mordenite and 0.5.Pt2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5, Na-mordenite. This section emphasizes the importance of platinum in maintaining high catalytic activity and stability.

比较非氧化脱氢化轻烯烃时，铂族金属催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的几个方面：

1. 铂基催化剂在特定温度下表现出特定的氢消耗峰，这表明其存在和活性。例如，在样品0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5上发现的530°C的额外氢消耗峰可能表明与锌有关的另一种不太高贵的物种的存在。这一峰值可能反映了铂的独特反应特性。

2. 更正后的表格详细记录了不同nSi/nAl比的催化剂在特定条件下的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这提供了这些催化剂有效性的见解，包括运行时间、焦炭负载、锌损失和转化百分比。

3. 文档讨论了去除铂或向沸石中添加两者的影响。它指出这样的变化会导致活性和稳定性降低的催化剂，例如4.2Zn,Na-莫尔登石和0.5.Pt2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5, Na-莫尔登石。这部分强调了铂在维持高催化活性和稳定性的关键作用。
