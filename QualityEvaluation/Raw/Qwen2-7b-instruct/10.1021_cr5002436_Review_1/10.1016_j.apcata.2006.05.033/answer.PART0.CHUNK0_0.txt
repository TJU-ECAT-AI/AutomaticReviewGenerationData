1. The additional hydrogen consumption peak at 530 °C on the sample 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species that is probably associated with the zinc.

2. The corrected table is provided for reference.

3. In the absence of platinum or after the zeolite has been impregnated with both zinc and platinum, less active and less stable catalysts are obtained, such as the zeolites 4.2Zn,Na-mordenite and 0.5.Pt2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5, Na-mordenite.

1. 样品0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5在530 °C时的额外氢消耗峰值表明存在一种与锌相关的另一种不太贵重的物种。

2. 已提供更正后的表格供参考。

3. 在缺少铂或在沸石上浸渍了锌和铂之后，会得到活性较低、稳定性较差的催化剂，如4.2Zn,Na-蒙脱石和0.5.Pt2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5, Na-蒙脱石。
