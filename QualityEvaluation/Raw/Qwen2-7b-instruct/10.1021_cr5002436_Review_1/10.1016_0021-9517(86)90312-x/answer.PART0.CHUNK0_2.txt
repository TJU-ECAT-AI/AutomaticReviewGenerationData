[1] "Under these conditions, dehydrogenation could be carried out for extended periods at these temperatures and the catalyst oxidatively regenerated, without loss of catalytic activity and with no significant change in platinum dispersion."
[2] "Catalyst activity fell off sharply after six cycles."
[3] "This was due to a gradual decrease in platinum dispersion,observed after each catalyst regeneration."
[4] "Platinum on alumina was much more prone to metal sintering in oxidizing environments."
[5] "Sulfur addition eventually led to loss of catalyst activity,however,which was not observed in dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles in its absence."
[6] "The results are discussed in terms of metal-support interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds."

The literature discusses the use of Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate as an efficient catalyst for the high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins. The addition of sulfur to the feed significantly enhances the selectivity towards olefin formation and suppresses both hydrogenolysis and coke formation. However, this leads to a gradual decrease in catalyst activity after multiple cycles due to a reduction in platinum dispersion. The platinum supported on alumina is more prone to sintering in oxidizing environments compared to magnesium aluminate. The presence of sulfur in the feed causes the catalyst to lose activity over time, which is not observed in the absence of sulfur. The deactivation process is attributed to changes in metal-support interactions influenced by sulfur compounds.

文献讨论了镁铝酸盐支持的铂在高温和长周期下对较低烷烃进行脱氢的高效催化剂应用。向原料中添加硫显著提高了选择性，促进烯烃的生成，并抑制了氢解和焦炭形成。然而，这导致催化剂活性在多次循环后逐渐下降，原因是铂分散度的减少，在每次催化剂再生后都能观察到这一点。与氧化铝相比，铂在氧化环境中更容易发生团聚。硫的存在会导致催化剂活性最终丧失，而在没有硫的情况下则不会出现这种情况。催化剂失活的原因归因于硫化合物对金属-载体相互作用的影响所引起的改变。
