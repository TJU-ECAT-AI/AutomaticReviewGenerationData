JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS 98, 235-244 (1986)

Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate spine1 is shown to be an efficient catalyst for high-temperature,long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins.

Trace amounts of sulfur in the feed (25-500 ppm) suppress both hydrogenolysis and coke formation.

With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C.

Sulfur addition eventually led to loss of catalyst activity, however, which was not observed in dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles in its absence.

Exposure to sulfur had this effect despite reduction in pure hydrogen at 600C prior to oxidative regeneration.

Platinum on alumina was much more prone to metal sintering in oxidizing environments.

The results are discussed in terms of metal-support interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds.

MgAl204 composition was confirmed by neutron activation analysis.

All dehydrogenation experiments were carried out at a 2- to-l or 3-to-l molar ratio of hydrogen to paraffin.

Sulfur was added to the feed either as H2S or thiophene.

Catalyst charges of 10 cm3 of lo- to 20-mesh catalysts were used without dilution.

Before the reactions were carried out, the catalysts were prereduced in flowing hydrogen for at least 30 min at 500C.

Regenerations were carried out at 450-500C in either flowing air or an air-helium mixture.

Values reported here are for the lined out catalyst and were taken at the end of the 5-h reaction period.

Initial studies were carried out on the dehydrogenation of isopentane to isoamyl-enes over platinum on various supports.

Dehydrogenation of isobutane at 560C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H2S.

In propane dehydrogenation, temperatures of 600C or higher must be employed in order to obtain reasonable yields of propylene.

The principal reaction was hydrogenolysis, with methane and coke the main products.

The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction.

Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained.

Sulfur also decreased coke formation, as before, and reaction could be carried out for up to 10 days before regeneration became necessary.

In the absence of sulfur, the reaction was not selective over Pt/MgAl2O4.

No change in activity was observed after the catalyst had been subjected to five regenerations at 500C in flowing air.

In the presence of sulfur, however, catalyst activity decreased after repeated regenerations.

Transmission electron micrographs showed that platinum particles in the fresh catalyst were between 10 and 20 A in diameter, while those in the spent catalyst had grown to between 25 and 80 A in diameter.

The same experiment was repeated with another sample of Pt/MgAl2O4, but in this case the catalyst was sampled after each regeneration and transmission electron micrographs obtained for each sample.

It was found that platinum crystal- lite size increased continuously with each dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle.

Good agreement was obtained between hydrogen adsorption and the electron microscope in the case of regenerated catalysts which had been run in the absence of sulfur.

A series of PtMgAl2O4 catalysts was run in a variety of environments and examined by electron microscopy.

Two samples of Pt/ MgAl2O4 were run for 6 days at 600C, one in flowing hydrogen and one in hydrogen with 200 ppm H2S.

Neither sample showed any significant increase in crystallite size.

Experiments were next carried out to differentiate between the effects of the dehydrogenation reaction itself and the regeneration in air.

Two samples of 0.5% Pt/MgAl2O4 were used for propane dehydrogenation at 600C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H2S.

Reaction was continued for 7 days.

At the end of this time, one sample was removed from the reactor without regeneration; the other was regenerated at the end of the reaction period.

It was hoped that these experiments would determine whether coke burn-off alone caused platinum sintering, or if the presence of sulfur in the feed was involved.

The study showed that sulfur is indeed an integral part of the sintering mechanism.

All 14 samples generated in the sulfur-free program had good platinum dispersions.

Large platinum crystals were not observed in any sample.

Qualitative examination of these 14 samples showed no substantial growth in platinum particle size.

Quantitative data for the final sample, regenerated seven times, showed a small increase in Pt crystallite size compared to fresh catalyst.

Thus, gross platinum sintering occurred only during carbon burn-off and then only when the catalyst had been run with sulfur present in the feed.

Significant differences in the behavior of platinum on the various supports were observed only in the presence of oxygen at high temperatures.

Significant growth in platinum crystallite size was observed after cycles of reduction in hydrogen (600C) followed by oxidation in air (500C).

More extensive platinum sintering occurred during regeneration of Pt/A1203 in air after use as a propane dehydrogenation catalyst.

This sintering grew progressively worse after each coke burn-off, and it occurred whether hydrogen sulfide was present in the propane feed or not.

Pt/MgA1204, on the other hand, was stable in all experiments except those where coke was burned off a catalyst which had been exposed to hydrogen sulfide during propane dehydrogenation.

The stability of Pt/MgA1204 in oxygen at high temperatures is more like that of Pt/MgO than Pt/A1203.

Possibly surface oxide ions which have magnesium cations as neighbors pin PtO, species in much the same way as with magnesia itself, i.e., more strongly than in the case of alumina.

Significantly, however, the catalyst did show a strong pattern for platinum metal, indicating extensive platinum sintering.

When the same catalyst was treated with a HIS/H2 mixture followed by air, a similar weight gain was observed, showing that oxidation of adsorbed H2S will lead to sulfate formation on the spine1 support.

X-Ray diffraction analysis of the reduced catalyst after this experiment showed a good spine1 pattern with no evidence of either MgO or A1203.

Significantly, however, the catalyst did show a strong pattern for platinum metal, indicating extensive platinum sintering.

We have no direct evidence for sulfur retention in reduced PtMgAl2O4 prior to coke burnoff.

The sulfur content of samples reduced at 600C before coke oxidation was below the detection limit of combustion methods.

A recent study by Mathieu and Primet (Z8) provided direct evidence for a similar cycle on Pt/Al2O3.

They found that H2S adsorbed dissociatively on Pt above 100C with release of hydrogen and full coverage of surface platinum atoms by sulfur.

Oxygen treatments removed sulfur from the platinum and led to formation of sulfate groups on the support which were detected by infrared spectroscopy.

High-temperature treatment in hydrogen reduced these sulfate groups but led to renewed poisoning of the platinum surface, as evidenced by catalyst selectivity in several test reactions; a conclusion also reached in the work of Apesteguia ef al. (19) on sulfu- rized Pt/A1203.

This result demonstrated the formation and reduction of surface sulfate species in Pt/A1203 exposed to hydrogen sulfide, and the retention of sulfur by platinum, when the catalyst is reduced.

The amount of sulfur which could be retained in this way by 0.5% Pt/MgA1203 is sufficiently small to be below the detection limit of the combustion method.

We theorized that it could nevertheless be sufficient to disrupt the bonding between platinum and spine1 by the proposed mechanism if surface sulfate is formed in close proximity to the platinum crystallites.

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are efficient for high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins. Trace amounts of sulfur suppress hydrogenolysis and coke formation, maintaining high propane conversion and propylene selectivity over multiple reaction cycles. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are typically used in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts offer different compositions and effectiveness depending on the specific application. Industrial applications vary, with recent developments focusing on improving stability, selectivity, and efficiency. Potential advantages include enhanced stability in certain environments and improved selectivity for desired products.

2. Platinum on magnesium aluminate is a stable catalyst for dehydrogenation processes, particularly when sulfur is not present. However, exposure to sulfur during dehydrogenation cycles leads to increased platinum dispersion, causing catalyst deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts generally exhibit different behavior in dehydrogenation processes, often leading to higher stability and selectivity under specific conditions. Recent advancements in catalyst design aim to optimize performance, reduce energy consumption, and enhance product yield. The choice between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts depends on factors such as reaction conditions, target products, and economic considerations.

Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate (MgAl2O4) is shown to be an efficient catalyst for high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins.

Trace amounts of sulfur in the feed (25-500 ppm) suppress both hydrogenolysis and coke formation.

Propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with a propylene selectivity of 92-94% was maintained over six 24-h reactiom-regeneration cycles at 600C.

Sulfur addition eventually led to loss of catalyst activity, however, which was not observed in dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles in its absence.

The activity loss resulted from increases in platinum particle size which occurred during coke burn-off but only in catalysts exposed to sulfur during the dehydrogenation cycle.

The results are discussed in terms of metal-support interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds.

The magnesium aluminate spinel used in this study was prepared by coprecipitation from aqueous solutions of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O by addition to a solution of NH4OH at a pH of 10.

All dehydrogenation experiments were carried out in a 1-in. i.d. tubular quartz reactor surrounded by a 13-in. tube furnace.

Before the reactions were carried out, the catalysts were prereduced in flowing hydrogen for at least 30 min at 500C.

Regenerations were carried out at 450-500C in either flowing air or an air-helium mixture.

Values reported here are for the lined out catalyst and were taken at the end of the 5-h reaction period.

Parafin Dehydrogenation Initial studies were carried out on the dehydrogenation of isopentane to isoamylenes over platinum on various supports.

The magnesium aluminate spine1 structure was confirmed by neutron activation analysis.

Hydrocarbon conversions and selectivities were calculated from gas chromatograms obtained with an 18-ft. by ±in. column of bisethoxy-2-ethyl sebacate at 25 or 50C using a thermoconductivity detector.

Sulfur increased both isopentane conversion and selectivity to isoamylenes.

The addition of 80 ppm sulfur increased selectivity to isoamylenes from 76 to 86 mol%.

Further increases in sulfur concentration from 80 to 625 ppm had only a small effect on selectivity but did cause a significant increase in conversion due to decreased coke formation.

Similar results were obtained for the dehydrogenation of isobutane at 560C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H2S.

In propane dehydrogenation, temperatures of 600C or higher must be employed in order to obtain reasonable yields of propylene.

This reaction was not selective over Pt/MgAl,OA in the absence of sulfur.

The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction.

Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained.

Effect of Regeneration

During the dehydrogenation of isopentane in the absence of sulfur, the Pt/MgAl2O4 was regenerated repeatedly with no observable loss in catalyst activity.

In dehydrogenating propane in the presence of sulfur, however, catalyst activity decreased after repeated regenerations.

Transmission electron micrographs were obtained for the fresh catalyst and for the catalyst after eight regenerations.

They showed that platinum particles in the fresh catalyst were between 10 and 20 A in diameter, while those in the spent catalyst had grown to between 25 and 80 A in diameter.

In order to determine which part of the overall reaction-regeneration sequence was responsible for platinum sintering, a series of PtMgAl2O4 catalysts was run in a variety of environments and examined by electron microscopy.

First, two samples of Pt/ MgAl204 were run for 6 days at 6OOC, one in flowing hydrogen and one in hydrogen with 200 ppm H#. 

Platinum size distributions, determined after 6 days for each sample, are shown in Fig. 2.

Experiments were next carried out to differentiate between the effects of the dehydrogenation reaction itself and the regeneration in air.

Two samples of 0.5% Pt/MgAl2O4 were used for propane dehydrogenation at 600C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H$. 

Reaction was continued for 7 days. At the end of this time, one sample was removed from the reactor without regeneration; the other was regenerated at the end of the reaction period.

Platinum crystallite size in the catalyst run 7 days without regeneration was unchanged from that of fresh catalyst.

To be completely sure, a large sample of 0.5% Pt/MgAl2O4 was charged to the reactor and run for 24 h at 600C.

After 24 h, the catalyst was reduced in hydrogen for 2 h at 600C and cooled to room temperature in helium.

One-half of the catalyst was then removed from the reactor. The other half was given a standard regeneration, as described previously, and cooled in helium.

A small sample of each half of the catalyst was removed for electron microscopy, the unregenerated half recharged, the entire charge given a standard pretreatment, and a second 24-h reaction period begun.

This procedure was repeated six times.

Examination of the samples generated in this experiment confirmed that platinum sintering became progressively worse with each regeneration and showed that all seven samples which had not been regenerated had good platinum dispersion.

The platinum crystallite size distribution obtained for catalyst run 7 days with no regeneration again was essentially the same as that of the fresh catalyst.

Two further experiments of this type were carried out.

In one case hydrogen sulfide was withheld from the feed, while in the other, only hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide were passed over the catalyst.

The study showed that sulfur is indeed an integral part of the sintering mechanism.

All 14 samples generated in the sulfur-free program had good platinum dispersions.

Large platinum crystals were not observed in any sample.

Qualitative examination of these 14 samples showed no substantial growth in platinum particle size.

Quantitative data for the sample given seven simulated regenerations showed a small increase in Pt crystallite size compared to fresh catalyst.

Thus, gross platinum sintering occurred only during carbon burn-off and then only when the catalyst had been run with sulfur present in the feed.

Platinum surface areas for some representative samples are given in Table 5.

These were calculated from the surface mean diameters of platinum crystallites in each sample, as determined by electron microscopy.

The document focuses on the role of sulfur in deactivating a specific type of catalyst, namely Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate (MgAl2O4), used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of lower paraffins. The key findings and comparisons are as follows:

1. **Catalyst Efficiency**: Platinum on magnesium aluminate is efficient for dehydrogenation reactions at high temperatures and long cycles, maintaining high conversion rates (up to 28 mol% propane conversion) and selectivity (92-94% propylene yield).

2. **Sulfur's Role**: Adding sulfur (25-500 ppm) to the feed enhances selectivity and reduces coke formation, enabling high conversion rates with minimal loss of catalyst activity. However, it leads to gradual catalyst deactivation over multiple cycles due to increased platinum particle size.

3. **Mechanism of Deactivation**: The deactivation occurs specifically when the catalyst is exposed to sulfur during the dehydrogenation process, particularly during carbon burn-off. The sulfur affects metal-support interactions, potentially weakening the bonding between platinum and the magnesium aluminate surface.

4. **Comparison with Other Catalysts**: The magnesium aluminate spine1 is notably stable against platinum sintering when compared to other supports like silica, alumina, and silica-alumina. This stability is attributed to unique interactions between platinum and magnesium aluminate.

5. **Recent Developments**: The study highlights the importance of sulfur in modifying the catalytic properties of the Pt/MgAl2O4 system. It also explores the mechanisms behind sulfur's impact on catalyst performance, including its role in sintering and its potential retention on the catalyst surface.

6. **Advantages**: The stability of Pt/MgAl2O4 under certain conditions (e.g., in reducing environments) offers advantages over other catalyst systems, particularly in maintaining activity and selectivity over multiple cycles.

**Industrial Applications**: The findings contribute to the optimization of catalytic processes in petrochemical industries, especially in refining and chemical synthesis, by providing insights into the design of more stable and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The noble metal catalysts, especially Platinum, are stable and effective in high-temperature conditions. They allow for long-term dehydrogenation processes without loss of activity or significant changes in the dispersion of the metal. The presence of sulfur compounds decreases the activity of these noble metal catalysts, causing a loss of activity that is not observed in catalysts without sulfur exposure. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, are less stable under high-temperature conditions and are more susceptible to degradation, especially when exposed to sulfur. The magnesium aluminate support material used in the document enhances the stability of the Platinum catalyst, particularly in environments with sulfur compounds. The catalysts' performance is influenced by the interactions between the noble metal and the support material, which are perturbed by sulfur compounds. The document also highlights the preparation of the magnesium aluminate spinel catalyst by coprecipitation and the effects of sulfur on the dehydrogenation process and catalyst stability.

The role of sulfur in deactivation of PtlMgAlp04 for propane dehydrogenation is discussed. The addition of sulfur to the feed increased selectivity to olefin and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation. Over 23 platinum on magnesium aluminate, with the addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C.

The results indicate that the activity loss resulting from sulfur exposure led to increases in platinum particle size, which occurred during coke burn-off but only in catalysts exposed to sulfur during the dehydrogenation cycle. Exposure to sulfur had this effect despite reduction in pure hydrogen at 600C prior to oxidative regeneration.

The dehydrogenation of propane over Pt/MgAl204 was shown to be stable in reducing environments at 600C, regardless of whether hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or propane was present. Large differences in the behavior of platinum on various supports were observed only in the presence of oxygen at high temperatures. Platinum dispersion was more stable on magnesium aluminate than on alumina in the presence of oxygen at high temperatures.

Sulfur compounds were found to play a critical role in the sintering mechanism of platinum on magnesium aluminate. The stability of Pt/MgAl204 during coke burn-off was reduced if the catalyst was exposed to hydrogen sulfide during propane dehydrogenation. This was attributed to a reaction sequence involving the formation of Pt(S), PtO2, and sulfate species on the support surface.

Flow microbalance results demonstrated that treating Pt/MgA1204 with SO2 and air led to a significant weight gain, indicating sulfate formation on the support. Subsequent hydrogen treatment resulted in a corresponding weight loss, confirming sulfate reduction. When the same catalyst was treated with a H2S/H2 mixture followed by air, a similar weight gain was observed, showing that oxidation of adsorbed H2S leads to sulfate formation on the support.

X-ray diffraction analysis of the reduced catalyst after the experiment showed a good spine1 pattern with no evidence of MgO or Al2O3. However, the catalyst displayed a strong pattern for platinum metal, indicating extensive platinum sintering. The study provided evidence for sulfur retention in reduced Pt/MgA1204 prior to coke burn-off, with sulfur content below the detection limit of combustion methods. Recent studies suggested the formation and reduction of surface sulfate species in Pt/A1203 exposed to hydrogen sulfide, leading to poisoning of the platinum surface.

1. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly those supported on magnesium aluminate (PtlMgAlp04), are effective in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. They maintain high conversion rates and selectivity to olefin products under long-term operation at high temperatures. The addition of sulfur to the feed stream enhances selectivity and suppresses hydrogenolysis and coke formation, enabling the maintenance of high conversion and selectivity over multiple reaction cycles.

2. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, exhibit different compositions and industrial applications compared to noble metal-based catalysts like platinum. While noble metals like platinum offer superior catalytic activity in many chemical transformations, metal oxides are often cheaper and more robust, making them suitable for applications requiring high thermal stability or resistance to poisoning by certain reactants. Recent developments in the field include the engineering of nanostructured metal oxides for enhanced surface area and improved catalytic performance, as well as the exploration of mixed metal oxides for synergistic catalytic activities.

3. Potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts over metal oxide-based catalysts include higher catalytic activity, better selectivity in certain reactions, and the ability to operate under harsher reaction conditions. Noble metals like platinum are often more effective in hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique electronic and structural properties. However, they can be expensive and susceptible to sintering and poisoning under certain operating conditions, especially in the presence of sulfur-containing species.

4. Metal oxide-based catalysts offer several potential advantages, including lower cost, higher thermal stability, and better resistance to poisoning. They are typically more robust against harsh reaction conditions and can withstand prolonged operation without significant loss of activity. Additionally, metal oxides can be tailored to specific catalytic applications through the selection of appropriate metal elements and modification of their surface chemistry.

5. The deactivation mechanisms of noble metal-based catalysts, such as Pt/MgAl204, in the presence of sulfur-containing species involve complex interactions between the noble metal, the support, and the sulfur compounds. Sulfur can lead to the formation of sulfate species on the support surface, which weakens the bonding between platinum and the support during oxidative regeneration, resulting in increased platinum particle size and sintering. This mechanism differs from that of metal oxide-based catalysts, which may involve different types of interactions between the metal oxide and sulfur compounds.

6. The study of Pt/MgAl204 in the presence of sulfur provides insights into the stability and deactivation mechanisms of noble metal-based catalysts in sulfur-containing environments.

1. 铂基催化剂，特别是镁铝酸盐支持的铂（PtlMgAlp04），在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢反应中表现出高效。它们能够维持高转化率和烯烃选择性，即使在长时间操作和高温下也是如此。向进料中添加硫可以提高选择性并抑制氢解和焦炭形成，从而在六次24小时反应循环中保持超过28摩尔%的丙烷转化率和高达92-94%的丙烯选择性。

2. 金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，与铂等贵金属催化剂相比，在组成、工业应用、近期发展以及在特定催化领域中的优势有所不同。虽然贵金属如铂因其独特的电子和结构特性在许多化学转换中表现出更高的活性和更好的选择性，但金属氧化物通常成本更低且更耐热，因此更适合需要高温稳定或对某些反应物有抗毒性的应用。近年来的研究包括纳米结构金属氧化物的工程设计以增强表面面积和改善催化性能，以及混合金属氧化物的探索，以实现协同催化活性。

3. 贵金属基催化剂相对于金属氧化物基催化剂的优势可能包括更高的催化活性、更好的特定反应选择性以及在苛刻反应条件下运行的能力。铂等贵金属在氢解和脱氢反应中通常更为有效，部分原因是它们独特的电子和结构特性。然而，它们也可能较为昂贵，并且在某些操作条件下容易发生聚集和中毒。

4. 金属氧化物基催化剂可能具有几个潜在的优势，包括较低的成本、更高的热稳定性以及对中毒的更好抵抗能力。它们通常能承受更长的运行时间而不会显著降低活性，并且可以通过选择合适的金属元素和调整其表面化学来适应特定的催化应用。

5. 在硫化合物存在的环境中，贵金属基催化剂（如Pt/MgAl204）的失活机制涉及复杂的相互作用，包括贵金属、支撑材料和硫化合物之间的相互作用。硫可能导致支撑表面上形成硫酸盐物种，这在氧化再生过程中减弱了铂与支撑材料之间的结合力，导致铂颗粒尺寸增加和聚集。这种机制与金属氧化物基催化剂中的不同，后者可能涉及不同的金属氧化物和硫化合物之间的相互作用方式。

6. 研究Pt/MgAl204在硫存在条件下的稳定性提供了有关贵金属基催化剂在硫含有环境中的稳定性和失活机制的重要见解。理解这些机制对于开发能够在实际工业条件下保持高活性和选择性的更耐用催化剂至关重要。未来的研究方向可能包括开发能够减轻硫负面影响的支撑材料、设计与优化交互位点的贵金属催化剂配方以及实施减少催化剂失活的高级再生技术。
