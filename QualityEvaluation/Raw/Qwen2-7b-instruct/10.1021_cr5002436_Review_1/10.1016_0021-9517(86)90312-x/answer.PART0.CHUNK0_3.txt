[1] "Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate (MgAl*OJ is remarkably stable (I, 2) in environments which lead to platinum sin- tering when silica (3), alumina (4), or sil- ica-alumina (5) are used as supports."
[2] "Under these conditions, dehydrogenation could be carried out for extended periods at these temperatures and the catalyst oxidatively regenerated, without loss of catalytic activ- ity and with no significant change in plati- num dispersion."
[3] "Sulfur addition eventually led to loss of catalyst activity,however,which was not observed in dehydrogena- tion/regeneration cycles in its absence."
[4] "Exposure to sulfur had this effect despite reduction in pure hy- drogen at 600C prior to oxidative regenera- tion."
[5] "The results are discussed in terms of metal- support interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds."
[6] "The magnesium aluminate spinels used in this study were prepared by coprecipitation from aqueous solutions of Al(NO&) * 9H20 and Mg(NO&) . 6H20 by addition to a solu- tion of NH4OH at a pH of 10."
[7] "Significant platinum sintering was observed in a sample run 4 days in hydrogen and given a simulated regeneration every 24 h."
[8] "For propane dehydrogenation,thermo- dynamics show that acceptable yields of propylene can be expected only at 600C and above in the presence of excess hydro- gen."
[9] "The stability of Pt/MgAl,O, in oxygen at high temperatures is more like that of Ptl MgO than Pt/Al,O,"
[10] "Treating Pt/MgA1204 with SOI and air gave a significant weight gain, i.e., sul- fate formation on the support."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The noble metal catalysts, especially Platinum, are stable and effective in high-temperature conditions. They allow for long-term dehydrogenation processes without loss of activity or significant changes in the dispersion of the metal. The presence of sulfur compounds decreases the activity of these noble metal catalysts, causing a loss of activity that is not observed in catalysts without sulfur exposure. Metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, are less stable under high-temperature conditions and are more susceptible to degradation, especially when exposed to sulfur. The magnesium aluminate support material used in the document enhances the stability of the Platinum catalyst, particularly in environments with sulfur compounds. The catalysts' performance is influenced by the interactions between the noble metal and the support material, which are perturbed by sulfur compounds. The document also highlights the preparation of the magnesium aluminate spinel catalyst by coprecipitation and the effects of sulfur on the dehydrogenation process and catalyst stability.

文档讨论了贵金属催化剂，特别是铂金，和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。贵金属催化剂在高温条件下稳定且有效，允许长时间进行脱氢过程而不损失活性或金属分散度的重大变化。硫化合物的存在降低了这些贵金属催化剂的活性，导致活性下降，而在没有硫暴露的情况下观察不到这种现象。金属氧化物催化剂在高温条件下更不稳定，并且在暴露于硫时更容易降解。镁铝酸盐支持材料的使用增强了铂金催化剂的稳定性，尤其是在含有硫化合物的环境中。催化剂的性能受贵金属与支持材料之间相互作用的影响，而这些作用被硫化合物扰动。文档还提到了镁铝酸盐催化剂的制备方法以及硫对脱氢过程和催化剂稳定性的影响。
