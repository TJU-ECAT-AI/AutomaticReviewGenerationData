The role of sulfur in deactivation of PtlMgAlp04 for propane dehydrogenation is discussed. The addition of sulfur to the feed increased selectivity to olefin and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation. Over 23 platinum on magnesium aluminate, with the addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C.

The results indicate that the activity loss resulting from sulfur exposure led to increases in platinum particle size, which occurred during coke burn-off but only in catalysts exposed to sulfur during the dehydrogenation cycle. Exposure to sulfur had this effect despite reduction in pure hydrogen at 600C prior to oxidative regeneration.

The dehydrogenation of propane over Pt/MgAl204 was shown to be stable in reducing environments at 600C, regardless of whether hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or propane was present. Large differences in the behavior of platinum on various supports were observed only in the presence of oxygen at high temperatures. Platinum dispersion was more stable on magnesium aluminate than on alumina in the presence of oxygen at high temperatures.

Sulfur compounds were found to play a critical role in the sintering mechanism of platinum on magnesium aluminate. The stability of Pt/MgAl204 during coke burn-off was reduced if the catalyst was exposed to hydrogen sulfide during propane dehydrogenation. This was attributed to a reaction sequence involving the formation of Pt(S), PtO2, and sulfate species on the support surface.

Flow microbalance results demonstrated that treating Pt/MgA1204 with SO2 and air led to a significant weight gain, indicating sulfate formation on the support. Subsequent hydrogen treatment resulted in a corresponding weight loss, confirming sulfate reduction. When the same catalyst was treated with a H2S/H2 mixture followed by air, a similar weight gain was observed, showing that oxidation of adsorbed H2S leads to sulfate formation on the support.

X-ray diffraction analysis of the reduced catalyst after the experiment showed a good spine1 pattern with no evidence of MgO or Al2O3. However, the catalyst displayed a strong pattern for platinum metal, indicating extensive platinum sintering. The study provided evidence for sulfur retention in reduced Pt/MgA1204 prior to coke burn-off, with sulfur content below the detection limit of combustion methods. Recent studies suggested the formation and reduction of surface sulfate species in Pt/A1203 exposed to hydrogen sulfide, leading to poisoning of the platinum surface.

1. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly those supported on magnesium aluminate (PtlMgAlp04), are effective in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. They maintain high conversion rates and selectivity to olefin products under long-term operation at high temperatures. The addition of sulfur to the feed stream enhances selectivity and suppresses hydrogenolysis and coke formation, enabling the maintenance of high conversion and selectivity over multiple reaction cycles.

2. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, exhibit different compositions and industrial applications compared to noble metal-based catalysts like platinum. While noble metals like platinum offer superior catalytic activity in many chemical transformations, metal oxides are often cheaper and more robust, making them suitable for applications requiring high thermal stability or resistance to poisoning by certain reactants. Recent developments in the field include the engineering of nanostructured metal oxides for enhanced surface area and improved catalytic performance, as well as the exploration of mixed metal oxides for synergistic catalytic activities.

3. Potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts over metal oxide-based catalysts include higher catalytic activity, better selectivity in certain reactions, and the ability to operate under harsher reaction conditions. Noble metals like platinum are often more effective in hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique electronic and structural properties. However, they can be expensive and susceptible to sintering and poisoning under certain operating conditions, especially in the presence of sulfur-containing species.

4. Metal oxide-based catalysts offer several potential advantages, including lower cost, higher thermal stability, and better resistance to poisoning. They are typically more robust against harsh reaction conditions and can withstand prolonged operation without significant loss of activity. Additionally, metal oxides can be tailored to specific catalytic applications through the selection of appropriate metal elements and modification of their surface chemistry.

5. The deactivation mechanisms of noble metal-based catalysts, such as Pt/MgAl204, in the presence of sulfur-containing species involve complex interactions between the noble metal, the support, and the sulfur compounds. Sulfur can lead to the formation of sulfate species on the support surface, which weakens the bonding between platinum and the support during oxidative regeneration, resulting in increased platinum particle size and sintering. This mechanism differs from that of metal oxide-based catalysts, which may involve different types of interactions between the metal oxide and sulfur compounds.

6. The study of Pt/MgAl204 in the presence of sulfur provides insights into the stability and deactivation mechanisms of noble metal-based catalysts in sulfur-containing environments. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of more robust catalysts capable of maintaining high activity and selectivity under practical industrial conditions. Future research directions may include the development of catalyst supports that can mitigate the negative effects of sulfur, the design of catalyst formulations that incorporate noble metals with optimized interaction sites, and the implementation of advanced regeneration techniques that minimize catalyst deactivation.
