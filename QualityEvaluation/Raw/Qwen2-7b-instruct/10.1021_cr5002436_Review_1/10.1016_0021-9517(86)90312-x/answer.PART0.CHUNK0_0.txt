JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS 98, 235-244 (1986)

Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate spine1 is shown to be an efficient catalyst for high-temperature,long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins.

Trace amounts of sulfur in the feed (25-500 ppm) suppress both hydrogenolysis and coke formation.

With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C.

Sulfur addition eventually led to loss of catalyst activity, however, which was not observed in dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles in its absence.

Exposure to sulfur had this effect despite reduction in pure hydrogen at 600C prior to oxidative regeneration.

Platinum on alumina was much more prone to metal sintering in oxidizing environments.

The results are discussed in terms of metal-support interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds.

MgAl204 composition was confirmed by neutron activation analysis.

All dehydrogenation experiments were carried out at a 2- to-l or 3-to-l molar ratio of hydrogen to paraffin.

Sulfur was added to the feed either as H2S or thiophene.

Catalyst charges of 10 cm3 of lo- to 20-mesh catalysts were used without dilution.

Before the reactions were carried out, the catalysts were prereduced in flowing hydrogen for at least 30 min at 500C.

Regenerations were carried out at 450-500C in either flowing air or an air-helium mixture.

Values reported here are for the lined out catalyst and were taken at the end of the 5-h reaction period.

Initial studies were carried out on the dehydrogenation of isopentane to isoamyl-enes over platinum on various supports.

Dehydrogenation of isobutane at 560C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H2S.

In propane dehydrogenation, temperatures of 600C or higher must be employed in order to obtain reasonable yields of propylene.

The principal reaction was hydrogenolysis, with methane and coke the main products.

The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction.

Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained.

Sulfur also decreased coke formation, as before, and reaction could be carried out for up to 10 days before regeneration became necessary.

In the absence of sulfur, the reaction was not selective over Pt/MgAl2O4.

No change in activity was observed after the catalyst had been subjected to five regenerations at 500C in flowing air.

In the presence of sulfur, however, catalyst activity decreased after repeated regenerations.

Transmission electron micrographs showed that platinum particles in the fresh catalyst were between 10 and 20 A in diameter, while those in the spent catalyst had grown to between 25 and 80 A in diameter.

The same experiment was repeated with another sample of Pt/MgAl2O4, but in this case the catalyst was sampled after each regeneration and transmission electron micrographs obtained for each sample.

It was found that platinum crystal- lite size increased continuously with each dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle.

Good agreement was obtained between hydrogen adsorption and the electron microscope in the case of regenerated catalysts which had been run in the absence of sulfur.

A series of PtMgAl2O4 catalysts was run in a variety of environments and examined by electron microscopy.

Two samples of Pt/ MgAl2O4 were run for 6 days at 600C, one in flowing hydrogen and one in hydrogen with 200 ppm H2S.

Neither sample showed any significant increase in crystallite size.

Experiments were next carried out to differentiate between the effects of the dehydrogenation reaction itself and the regeneration in air.

Two samples of 0.5% Pt/MgAl2O4 were used for propane dehydrogenation at 600C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H2S.

Reaction was continued for 7 days.

At the end of this time, one sample was removed from the reactor without regeneration; the other was regenerated at the end of the reaction period.

It was hoped that these experiments would determine whether coke burn-off alone caused platinum sintering, or if the presence of sulfur in the feed was involved.

The study showed that sulfur is indeed an integral part of the sintering mechanism.

All 14 samples generated in the sulfur-free program had good platinum dispersions.

Large platinum crystals were not observed in any sample.

Qualitative examination of these 14 samples showed no substantial growth in platinum particle size.

Quantitative data for the final sample, regenerated seven times, showed a small increase in Pt crystallite size compared to fresh catalyst.

Thus, gross platinum sintering occurred only during carbon burn-off and then only when the catalyst had been run with sulfur present in the feed.

Significant differences in the behavior of platinum on the various supports were observed only in the presence of oxygen at high temperatures.

Significant growth in platinum crystallite size was observed after cycles of reduction in hydrogen (600C) followed by oxidation in air (500C).

More extensive platinum sintering occurred during regeneration of Pt/A1203 in air after use as a propane dehydrogenation catalyst.

This sintering grew progressively worse after each coke burn-off, and it occurred whether hydrogen sulfide was present in the propane feed or not.

Pt/MgA1204, on the other hand, was stable in all experiments except those where coke was burned off a catalyst which had been exposed to hydrogen sulfide during propane dehydrogenation.

The stability of Pt/MgA1204 in oxygen at high temperatures is more like that of Pt/MgO than Pt/A1203.

Possibly surface oxide ions which have magnesium cations as neighbors pin PtO, species in much the same way as with magnesia itself, i.e., more strongly than in the case of alumina.

Significantly, however, the catalyst did show a strong pattern for platinum metal, indicating extensive platinum sintering.

When the same catalyst was treated with a HIS/H2 mixture followed by air, a similar weight gain was observed, showing that oxidation of adsorbed H2S will lead to sulfate formation on the spine1 support.

X-Ray diffraction analysis of the reduced catalyst after this experiment showed a good spine1 pattern with no evidence of either MgO or A1203.

Significantly, however, the catalyst did show a strong pattern for platinum metal, indicating extensive platinum sintering.

We have no direct evidence for sulfur retention in reduced PtMgAl2O4 prior to coke burnoff.

The sulfur content of samples reduced at 600C before coke oxidation was below the detection limit of combustion methods.

A recent study by Mathieu and Primet (Z8) provided direct evidence for a similar cycle on Pt/Al2O3.

They found that H2S adsorbed dissociatively on Pt above 100C with release of hydrogen and full coverage of surface platinum atoms by sulfur.

Oxygen treatments removed sulfur from the platinum and led to formation of sulfate groups on the support which were detected by infrared spectroscopy.

High-temperature treatment in hydrogen reduced these sulfate groups but led to renewed poisoning of the platinum surface, as evidenced by catalyst selectivity in several test reactions; a conclusion also reached in the work of Apesteguia ef al. (19) on sulfu- rized Pt/A1203.

This result demonstrated the formation and reduction of surface sulfate species in Pt/A1203 exposed to hydrogen sulfide, and the retention of sulfur by platinum, when the catalyst is reduced.

The amount of sulfur which could be retained in this way by 0.5% Pt/MgA1203 is sufficiently small to be below the detection limit of the combustion method.

We theorized that it could nevertheless be sufficient to disrupt the bonding between platinum and spine1 by the proposed mechanism if surface sulfate is formed in close proximity to the platinum crystallites.

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are efficient for high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins. Trace amounts of sulfur suppress hydrogenolysis and coke formation, maintaining high propane conversion and propylene selectivity over multiple reaction cycles. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are typically used in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts offer different compositions and effectiveness depending on the specific application. Industrial applications vary, with recent developments focusing on improving stability, selectivity, and efficiency. Potential advantages include enhanced stability in certain environments and improved selectivity for desired products.

2. Platinum on magnesium aluminate is a stable catalyst for dehydrogenation processes, particularly when sulfur is not present. However, exposure to sulfur during dehydrogenation cycles leads to increased platinum dispersion, causing catalyst deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts generally exhibit different behavior in dehydrogenation processes, often leading to higher stability and selectivity under specific conditions. Recent advancements in catalyst design aim to optimize performance, reduce energy consumption, and enhance product yield. The choice between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts depends on factors such as reaction conditions, target products, and economic considerations.
