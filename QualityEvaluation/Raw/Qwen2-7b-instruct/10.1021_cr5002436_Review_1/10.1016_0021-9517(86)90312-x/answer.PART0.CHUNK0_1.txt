Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate (MgAl2O4) is shown to be an efficient catalyst for high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins.

Trace amounts of sulfur in the feed (25-500 ppm) suppress both hydrogenolysis and coke formation.

Propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with a propylene selectivity of 92-94% was maintained over six 24-h reactiom-regeneration cycles at 600C.

Sulfur addition eventually led to loss of catalyst activity, however, which was not observed in dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles in its absence.

The activity loss resulted from increases in platinum particle size which occurred during coke burn-off but only in catalysts exposed to sulfur during the dehydrogenation cycle.

The results are discussed in terms of metal-support interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds.

The magnesium aluminate spinel used in this study was prepared by coprecipitation from aqueous solutions of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O by addition to a solution of NH4OH at a pH of 10.

All dehydrogenation experiments were carried out in a 1-in. i.d. tubular quartz reactor surrounded by a 13-in. tube furnace.

Before the reactions were carried out, the catalysts were prereduced in flowing hydrogen for at least 30 min at 500C.

Regenerations were carried out at 450-500C in either flowing air or an air-helium mixture.

Values reported here are for the lined out catalyst and were taken at the end of the 5-h reaction period.

Parafin Dehydrogenation Initial studies were carried out on the dehydrogenation of isopentane to isoamylenes over platinum on various supports.

The magnesium aluminate spine1 structure was confirmed by neutron activation analysis.

Hydrocarbon conversions and selectivities were calculated from gas chromatograms obtained with an 18-ft. by ±in. column of bisethoxy-2-ethyl sebacate at 25 or 50C using a thermoconductivity detector.

Sulfur increased both isopentane conversion and selectivity to isoamylenes.

The addition of 80 ppm sulfur increased selectivity to isoamylenes from 76 to 86 mol%.

Further increases in sulfur concentration from 80 to 625 ppm had only a small effect on selectivity but did cause a significant increase in conversion due to decreased coke formation.

Similar results were obtained for the dehydrogenation of isobutane at 560C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H2S.

In propane dehydrogenation, temperatures of 600C or higher must be employed in order to obtain reasonable yields of propylene.

This reaction was not selective over Pt/MgAl,OA in the absence of sulfur.

The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction.

Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained.

Effect of Regeneration

During the dehydrogenation of isopentane in the absence of sulfur, the Pt/MgAl2O4 was regenerated repeatedly with no observable loss in catalyst activity.

In dehydrogenating propane in the presence of sulfur, however, catalyst activity decreased after repeated regenerations.

Transmission electron micrographs were obtained for the fresh catalyst and for the catalyst after eight regenerations.

They showed that platinum particles in the fresh catalyst were between 10 and 20 A in diameter, while those in the spent catalyst had grown to between 25 and 80 A in diameter.

In order to determine which part of the overall reaction-regeneration sequence was responsible for platinum sintering, a series of PtMgAl2O4 catalysts was run in a variety of environments and examined by electron microscopy.

First, two samples of Pt/ MgAl204 were run for 6 days at 6OOC, one in flowing hydrogen and one in hydrogen with 200 ppm H#. 

Platinum size distributions, determined after 6 days for each sample, are shown in Fig. 2.

Experiments were next carried out to differentiate between the effects of the dehydrogenation reaction itself and the regeneration in air.

Two samples of 0.5% Pt/MgAl2O4 were used for propane dehydrogenation at 600C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H$. 

Reaction was continued for 7 days. At the end of this time, one sample was removed from the reactor without regeneration; the other was regenerated at the end of the reaction period.

Platinum crystallite size in the catalyst run 7 days without regeneration was unchanged from that of fresh catalyst.

To be completely sure, a large sample of 0.5% Pt/MgAl2O4 was charged to the reactor and run for 24 h at 600C.

After 24 h, the catalyst was reduced in hydrogen for 2 h at 600C and cooled to room temperature in helium.

One-half of the catalyst was then removed from the reactor. The other half was given a standard regeneration, as described previously, and cooled in helium.

A small sample of each half of the catalyst was removed for electron microscopy, the unregenerated half recharged, the entire charge given a standard pretreatment, and a second 24-h reaction period begun.

This procedure was repeated six times.

Examination of the samples generated in this experiment confirmed that platinum sintering became progressively worse with each regeneration and showed that all seven samples which had not been regenerated had good platinum dispersion.

The platinum crystallite size distribution obtained for catalyst run 7 days with no regeneration again was essentially the same as that of the fresh catalyst.

Two further experiments of this type were carried out.

In one case hydrogen sulfide was withheld from the feed, while in the other, only hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide were passed over the catalyst.

The study showed that sulfur is indeed an integral part of the sintering mechanism.

All 14 samples generated in the sulfur-free program had good platinum dispersions.

Large platinum crystals were not observed in any sample.

Qualitative examination of these 14 samples showed no substantial growth in platinum particle size.

Quantitative data for the sample given seven simulated regenerations showed a small increase in Pt crystallite size compared to fresh catalyst.

Thus, gross platinum sintering occurred only during carbon burn-off and then only when the catalyst had been run with sulfur present in the feed.

Platinum surface areas for some representative samples are given in Table 5.

These were calculated from the surface mean diameters of platinum crystallites in each sample, as determined by electron microscopy.

The document focuses on the role of sulfur in deactivating a specific type of catalyst, namely Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate (MgAl2O4), used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of lower paraffins. The key findings and comparisons are as follows:

1. **Catalyst Efficiency**: Platinum on magnesium aluminate is efficient for dehydrogenation reactions at high temperatures and long cycles, maintaining high conversion rates (up to 28 mol% propane conversion) and selectivity (92-94% propylene yield).

2. **Sulfur's Role**: Adding sulfur (25-500 ppm) to the feed enhances selectivity and reduces coke formation, enabling high conversion rates with minimal loss of catalyst activity. However, it leads to gradual catalyst deactivation over multiple cycles due to increased platinum particle size.

3. **Mechanism of Deactivation**: The deactivation occurs specifically when the catalyst is exposed to sulfur during the dehydrogenation process, particularly during carbon burn-off. The sulfur affects metal-support interactions, potentially weakening the bonding between platinum and the magnesium aluminate surface.

4. **Comparison with Other Catalysts**: The magnesium aluminate spine1 is notably stable against platinum sintering when compared to other supports like silica, alumina, and silica-alumina. This stability is attributed to unique interactions between platinum and magnesium aluminate.

5. **Recent Developments**: The study highlights the importance of sulfur in modifying the catalytic properties of the Pt/MgAl2O4 system. It also explores the mechanisms behind sulfur's impact on catalyst performance, including its role in sintering and its potential retention on the catalyst surface.

6. **Advantages**: The stability of Pt/MgAl2O4 under certain conditions (e.g., in reducing environments) offers advantages over other catalyst systems, particularly in maintaining activity and selectivity over multiple cycles.

**Industrial Applications**: The findings contribute to the optimization of catalytic processes in petrochemical industries, especially in refining and chemical synthesis, by providing insights into the design of more stable and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.
