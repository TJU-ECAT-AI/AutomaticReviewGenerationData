[1] "Addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 enhances the rate of isobutene hydrogenation and isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."
[3] "The higher rates observed over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite may be attributed to stabilization of the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium."
[4] "Importantly, these turnover frequencies are still considerably higher over the Pt/Sn/KL catalyst when the rates are based on total platinum."

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins typically consist of pure noble metals or combinations with other metals. They are effective due to their ability to facilitate the dehydrogenation reactions efficiently. Industrial applications of these catalysts include the production of olefins from paraffins, which are crucial for petrochemical industries. Recent developments focus on enhancing the catalytic properties by modifying the catalysts' composition, structure, and support materials. The addition of potassium to the Platinum-based catalysts stabilizes the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure, thus increasing the reaction rates. Supporting Platinum and tin in the potassium form of L-zeolite produces a material that exhibits significantly higher rates for both reactions, compared to silica-supported catalysts. This is attributed to the stabilization of adsorbed species on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores and/or the presence of potassium. The industrial applications of these catalysts extend beyond petrochemical industries, contributing to the synthesis of various valuable products.

贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢通常由纯贵金属或与其他金属的组合构成。它们在促进脱氢反应方面非常有效。这些催化剂的工业应用包括从烷烃生产烯烃，这对于石油化工行业至关重要。最近的发展集中在通过改变催化剂的组成、结构和支撑材料来提高催化性能。向铂基催化剂中添加钾可以稳定参与异丁烷的离解吸附/脱附过程的活性复合物在铂/锡簇内的作用，从而增加反应速率。将铂和锡支持在钾型L沸石中产生一种材料，其反应速率与二氧化硅支撑催化剂相比显著更高。这归因于小簇Pt/Sn在沸石微孔结构中的吸附物种的稳定性和/或钾的存在。铂/锡/钾L沸石催化剂的工业应用超越了石油化工领域，为合成各种有价值的产物做出了贡献。
