Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals several key differences and similarities. Noble metals like Platinum are known for their high reactivity and selectivity, making them effective in catalytic processes. Metal oxides, on the other hand, are recognized for their stability and broad applicability across industries. Recent developments include the enhancement of Pt/Sn catalysts with potassium, which boosts the rates of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation. The composition of noble metal catalysts usually consists of elements such as Platinum, Palladium, and Rhodium, whereas metal oxide catalysts are characterized by their metal oxides. Both types of catalysts are effective in different contexts, with noble metals excelling in reactivity and selectivity, while metal oxides offer cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits. The addition of potassium in Pt/Sn catalysts helps stabilize the complex involved in isobutane dissociation, contributing to higher reaction rates.
