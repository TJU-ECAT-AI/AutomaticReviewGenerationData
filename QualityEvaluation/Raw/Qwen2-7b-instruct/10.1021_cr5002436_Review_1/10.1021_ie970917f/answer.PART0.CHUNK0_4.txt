[1] "We have reported elsewhere the development of a kinetic model that describes the essential surface chemistry involved in isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over Pt/Sn-based materials."
[2] "It was previously shown that scaling the rates of isobutane and isobutene adsorption over Pt/Sn/SiO2 did not adequately describe the observed steady-state kinetics over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL (Cortright et al., 1996)."
[3] "The results of these kinetic analyses suggest that the mobility of adsorbed isobutene is limited to less than 1 degree of translational freedom and adsorbed atomic hydrogen has approximately 1 degree of translational freedom on Pt/Sn catalysts under the conditions of this study."

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The key findings highlight the effectiveness of Platinum-based catalysts, especially when combined with tin (Pt/Sn) and potassium (Pt/Sn/KL) in enhancing the rates of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation. The catalysts were characterized by their ability to stabilize the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure, or through stabilization by the presence of potassium. The kinetic model developed for these reactions involves a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The addition of potassium to the silica-supported catalysts (Pt/Sn/K/SiO2) further increases the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation and enhances the rate of dehydrogenation. Supporting the Pt/Sn alloy on the potassium form of L-zeolite (Pt/Sn/KL) yields a material with significantly higher rates for both reactions compared to silica-supported catalysts. The kinetic analysis indicates that adsorbed isobutene has limited mobility, while adsorbed atomic hydrogen has approximately 1 degree of translational freedom under the conditions of this study.

本文讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中使用贵金属催化剂，特别是铂的使用。主要发现强调了铂基催化剂的有效性，尤其是在铂与锡（Pt/Sn）和钾（Pt/Sn/KL）结合时，能够增强异丁烷脱氢和异丁烯氢化速率。这些催化剂的特点是能够稳定Pt/Sn簇在沸石微孔结构中的异丁烷解吸附/再吸附过程，或者通过钾的存在进行稳定。开发的反应动力学模型涉及霍里图-波兰尼四步机制，其中关键步骤为异丁烷的离解吸附以及氢和异丁烯的准平衡吸附。向二氧化硅支持的催化剂中添加钾（Pt/Sn/K/SiO2）进一步提高了异丁烷脱氢的选择性和速率。将Pt/Sn合金支持在钾型L沸石（Pt/Sn/KL）上产生了一种材料，其两种反应的速率显著高于二氧化硅支持的催化剂。动力学分析表明，吸附的异丁烯具有有限的移动性，而吸附的原子氢则具有约1个自由度的平移自由度，在此研究条件下。
