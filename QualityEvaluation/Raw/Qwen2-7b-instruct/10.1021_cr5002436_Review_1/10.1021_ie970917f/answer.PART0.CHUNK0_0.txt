The literature discusses noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The Platinum-based catalysts, especially those supported on silica and L-zeolite, are found to be effective in enhancing the rates of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation when potassium is added. The L-zeolite-supported catalysts exhibit even higher rates compared to silica-supported catalysts. The kinetic model developed for these catalysts explains the essential surface chemistry involved in the reactions, attributing the enhanced rates to stabilization of the activated complex for isobutane dissociation on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium. The kinetic analyses indicate that the mobility of adsorbed isobutene is limited to less than one degree of translational freedom on the surface, while adsorbed atomic hydrogen has approximately one degree of translational freedom.

文献讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中，特别是铂基催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂的作用。添加钾到硅酸盐支持的铂/锡催化剂中可以提高异丁烷脱氢和异丁烯加氢的速率。而将铂和锡支撑在钾形式的L沸石中形成的材料相比硅酸盐支持的催化剂表现出更高的反应速率。开发的反应动力学模型解释了这些催化剂表面化学反应的本质，归因于铂/锡簇在沸石微孔中的活性复合物的稳定化以及钾的存在。动力学分析表明，吸附的异丁烯在表面上的移动性受到限制少于一个自由度的平移，而吸附的原子氢则具有大约一个自由度的平移。
