The literature discusses noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The Platinum-based catalysts, especially those supported on silica and L-zeolite, are found to be effective in enhancing the rates of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation when potassium is added. The L-zeolite-supported catalysts exhibit even higher rates compared to silica-supported catalysts. The kinetic model developed for these catalysts explains the essential surface chemistry involved in the reactions, attributing the enhanced rates to stabilization of the activated complex for isobutane dissociation on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium. The kinetic analyses indicate that the mobility of adsorbed isobutene is limited to less than one degree of translational freedom on the surface, while adsorbed atomic hydrogen has approximately one degree of translational freedom.

文献讨论了在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中，特别是铂基催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂的作用。添加钾到硅酸盐支持的铂/锡催化剂中可以提高异丁烷脱氢和异丁烯加氢的速率。而将铂和锡支撑在钾形式的L沸石中形成的材料相比硅酸盐支持的催化剂表现出更高的反应速率。开发的反应动力学模型解释了这些催化剂表面化学反应的本质，归因于铂/锡簇在沸石微孔中的活性复合物的稳定化以及钾的存在。动力学分析表明，吸附的异丁烯在表面上的移动性受到限制少于一个自由度的平移，而吸附的原子氢则具有大约一个自由度的平移。

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals several key differences and similarities. Noble metals like Platinum are known for their high reactivity and selectivity, making them effective in catalytic processes. Metal oxides, on the other hand, are recognized for their stability and broad applicability across industries. Recent developments include the enhancement of Pt/Sn catalysts with potassium, which boosts the rates of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation. The composition of noble metal catalysts usually consists of elements such as Platinum, Palladium, and Rhodium, whereas metal oxide catalysts are characterized by their metal oxides. Both types of catalysts are effective in different contexts, with noble metals excelling in reactivity and selectivity, while metal oxides offer cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits. The addition of potassium in Pt/Sn catalysts helps stabilize the complex involved in isobutane dissociation, contributing to higher reaction rates.

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins typically consist of pure noble metals or combinations with other metals. They are effective due to their ability to facilitate the dehydrogenation reactions efficiently. Industrial applications of these catalysts include the production of olefins from paraffins, which are crucial for petrochemical industries. Recent developments focus on enhancing the catalytic properties by modifying the catalysts' composition, structure, and support materials. The addition of potassium to the Platinum-based catalysts stabilizes the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure, thus increasing the reaction rates. Supporting Platinum and tin in the potassium form of L-zeolite produces a material that exhibits significantly higher rates for both reactions, compared to silica-supported catalysts. This is attributed to the stabilization of adsorbed species on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores and/or the presence of potassium. The industrial applications of these catalysts extend beyond petrochemical industries, contributing to the synthesis of various valuable products.

贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢通常由纯贵金属或与其他金属的组合构成。它们在促进脱氢反应方面非常有效。这些催化剂的工业应用包括从烷烃生产烯烃，这对于石油化工行业至关重要。最近的发展集中在通过改变催化剂的组成、结构和支撑材料来提高催化性能。向铂基催化剂中添加钾可以稳定参与异丁烷的离解吸附/脱附过程的活性复合物在铂/锡簇内的作用，从而增加反应速率。将铂和锡支持在钾型L沸石中产生一种材料，其反应速率与二氧化硅支撑催化剂相比显著更高。这归因于小簇Pt/Sn在沸石微孔结构中的吸附物种的稳定性和/或钾的存在。铂/锡/钾L沸石催化剂的工业应用超越了石油化工领域，为合成各种有价值的产物做出了贡献。

The study focuses on comparing the kinetic studies of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over Pt/Sn-based catalysts, specifically Pt/Sn/SiO2, Pt/Sn/K/SiO2, and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite catalysts. The key findings include:

1. The addition of potassium to the Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst enhances the rates of both isobutene hydrogenation and isobutane dehydrogenation, while the Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite catalyst shows significantly higher rates compared to the other two catalysts.

2. The kinetic model developed for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts is based on a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, where dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene are assumed.

3. The higher reaction rates observed over the Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite catalysts might be attributed to the stabilization of the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium.

4. The kinetic analysis suggests that the mobility of adsorbed isobutene is limited to less than 1 degree of translational freedom, while adsorbed atomic hydrogen has approximately 1 degree of translational freedom on the Pt/Sn catalysts under the conditions of the study. Adsorption of isobutene and hydrogen is favored with the addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn and is further enhanced on the Pt/Sn/KL catalyst.

研究主要关注Pt/Sn基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用比较。关键发现包括：

1.Pt/Sn/SiO2中钾的添加能够增强异丁烯氢化和异丁烷脱氢的速率，而Pt/Sn/KL沸石催化剂的反应速率远高于Pt/Sn/SiO2和Pt/Sn/K/SiO2催化剂。

2.开发了一种基于四步HoriutiPolanyi机制的反应动力学模型，用于描述Pt/Sn催化剂上异丁烷脱氢和异丁烯氢化的基本表面化学过程，假设氢和异丁烯吸附达到准平衡状态，以及异丁烷的解离吸附为限速步骤。

3.Pt/Sn/K/SiO2和Pt/Sn/KL-沸石催化剂较高的反应速率可能归因于Pt/Sn簇在沸石微孔结构内的异丁烷解离吸附/去吸附激活复合物的稳定化，以及钾的存在。

4.动力学分析表明，吸附的异丁烯的迁移限制在小于1个自由度的平移自由度内，而吸附的原子氢具有大约1个自由度的平移自由度。钾的添加有利于SiO2支持的Pt/Sn催化剂上的异丁烯和氢的吸附，并且在Pt/Sn/KL催化剂上进一步增强。

The document discusses the use of noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The key findings highlight the effectiveness of Platinum-based catalysts, especially when combined with tin (Pt/Sn) and potassium (Pt/Sn/KL) in enhancing the rates of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation. The catalysts were characterized by their ability to stabilize the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure, or through stabilization by the presence of potassium. The kinetic model developed for these reactions involves a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene. The addition of potassium to the silica-supported catalysts (Pt/Sn/K/SiO2) further increases the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation and enhances the rate of dehydrogenation. Supporting the Pt/Sn alloy on the potassium form of L-zeolite (Pt/Sn/KL) yields a material with significantly higher rates for both reactions compared to silica-supported catalysts. The kinetic analysis indicates that adsorbed isobutene has limited mobility, while adsorbed atomic hydrogen has approximately 1 degree of translational freedom under the conditions of this study.
