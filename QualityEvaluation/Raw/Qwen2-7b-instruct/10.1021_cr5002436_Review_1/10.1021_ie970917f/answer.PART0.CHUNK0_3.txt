The study focuses on comparing the kinetic studies of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over Pt/Sn-based catalysts, specifically Pt/Sn/SiO2, Pt/Sn/K/SiO2, and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite catalysts. The key findings include:

1. The addition of potassium to the Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst enhances the rates of both isobutene hydrogenation and isobutane dehydrogenation, while the Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite catalyst shows significantly higher rates compared to the other two catalysts.

2. The kinetic model developed for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts is based on a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, where dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene are assumed.

3. The higher reaction rates observed over the Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite catalysts might be attributed to the stabilization of the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium.

4. The kinetic analysis suggests that the mobility of adsorbed isobutene is limited to less than 1 degree of translational freedom, while adsorbed atomic hydrogen has approximately 1 degree of translational freedom on the Pt/Sn catalysts under the conditions of the study. Adsorption of isobutene and hydrogen is favored with the addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn and is further enhanced on the Pt/Sn/KL catalyst.

研究主要关注Pt/Sn基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用比较。关键发现包括：

1.Pt/Sn/SiO2中钾的添加能够增强异丁烯氢化和异丁烷脱氢的速率，而Pt/Sn/KL沸石催化剂的反应速率远高于Pt/Sn/SiO2和Pt/Sn/K/SiO2催化剂。

2.开发了一种基于四步HoriutiPolanyi机制的反应动力学模型，用于描述Pt/Sn催化剂上异丁烷脱氢和异丁烯氢化的基本表面化学过程，假设氢和异丁烯吸附达到准平衡状态，以及异丁烷的解离吸附为限速步骤。

3.Pt/Sn/K/SiO2和Pt/Sn/KL-沸石催化剂较高的反应速率可能归因于Pt/Sn簇在沸石微孔结构内的异丁烷解离吸附/去吸附激活复合物的稳定化，以及钾的存在。

4.动力学分析表明，吸附的异丁烯的迁移限制在小于1个自由度的平移自由度内，而吸附的原子氢具有大约1个自由度的平移自由度。钾的添加有利于SiO2支持的Pt/Sn催化剂上的异丁烯和氢的吸附，并且在Pt/Sn/KL催化剂上进一步增强。
