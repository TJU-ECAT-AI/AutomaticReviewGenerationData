[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."
[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "The support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature."
[5] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually."
[6] "These results could hold the key to understanding the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst and a detailed study on this subject is underway."
[7] "It is also evident from this work that TEOM coupled with GC/MS is a powerful tool for obtaining comprehensive information of intricate catalytic reactions such as DHP."

The literature focuses on the effect of platinum particle size on the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt-SBA-15 catalysts. It reveals that smaller particles (3 nm) are more active but less selective, leading to higher rates of coking and coke formation compared to larger particles (21 nm). The support SBA-15 is noted for its lack of acidity, which rules out the effect of acidity on selectivity. The study also suggests that the size of platinum particles affects the reactivity balance between the activation of carbon-carbon (CC) and carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds. The results could shed light on the role of tin in bimetallic catalysts and warrant further investigation. The TEOM coupled with GC/MS is highlighted as a valuable tool for comprehensive analysis of complex catalytic reactions.

文献专注于不同铂颗粒尺寸对丙烷在Pt-SBA-15催化剂上的脱氢反应的影响。研究表明，较小的颗粒（3 nm）活性更高但选择性较低，导致较高的结焦速率和焦炭形成与较大颗粒（21 nm）相比。SBA-15支持被认为非酸性或弱酸性，排除了酸度对选择性的影响。研究结果表明，铂颗粒大小影响CC键和CH键激活之间的反应平衡。这些结果可能揭示了双金属催化剂中锡的作用，并值得进一步研究。还强调了结合GC/MS的TEOM作为分析复杂催化反应的有力工具的价值。
