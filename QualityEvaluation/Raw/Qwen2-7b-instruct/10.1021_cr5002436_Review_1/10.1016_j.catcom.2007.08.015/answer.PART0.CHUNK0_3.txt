[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."
[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "Pt particle size is an important parameter to be taken into account while designing a rational catalyst for DHP since particle size not only influences the activity but also plays a crucial role in determining selectivity as evidenced by coking."
[5] "Smaller particles are more active for propane conversion and coke formation while, larger particles are less active for both the reactions but more selective for propene formation."

The document discusses the effect of platinum particle size on the dehydrogenation of propane. Smaller particles (3 nm) exhibit higher activity and lower selectivity compared to larger particles (21 nm). The smaller particles lead to a faster rate of coke formation, lower selectivity towards propene, and a higher amount of coke produced. The size of the platinum particles plays a crucial role in both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Smaller particles are more active in converting propane but less selective towards propene, while larger particles are less active overall but more selective for propene formation. This information is critical for designing efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

文档讨论了铂颗粒大小对丙烷脱氢的影响。较小的颗粒（3 nm）在活性和选择性方面均低于较大的颗粒（21 nm）。较小的颗粒导致焦炭形成速率更快、丙烯选择性更低，且产生的焦炭量更多。铂颗粒的大小不仅影响活性，而且在决定选择性时也起着关键作用，这通过焦炭形成得到了证明。较小的颗粒在促进丙烷转化方面更为活跃，但对丙烯的选择性较低；而较大的颗粒整体活性较低，但对丙烯形成的选择性更高。这些信息对于设计高效的脱氢反应催化剂至关重要。
