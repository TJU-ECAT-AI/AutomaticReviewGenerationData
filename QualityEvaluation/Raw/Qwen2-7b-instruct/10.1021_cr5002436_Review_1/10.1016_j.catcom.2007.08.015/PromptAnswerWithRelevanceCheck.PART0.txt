[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."
[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "By contrast, Pt particles, which appear as bright spots in the STEM image of Fig. 1b, are homogeneously distributed with a narrow size distribution and average size of 3 nm."
[5] "The most significant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke formation during the reaction."
[6] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
[7] "This is due to the fact that true initial TOF is difficult to determine over Pt-SBA-15-DP due to rapid deactivation of Pt sites by coke as evidenced by the above results."
[8] "Consequently, selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."

The document discusses the effect of platinum particle size on the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt-SBA-15 catalysts. It reveals that smaller particles (3 nm) are more active but less selective compared to larger particles (21 nm). The reaction rate, coke formation, and coke amount are significantly higher over the smaller particles. The use of the TEOM/GC system provides comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coke formation from a single catalysis experiment. The true initial turnover frequency (TOF) is difficult to determine over the smaller particles due to rapid deactivation by coke. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation.

文档讨论了在Pt-SBA-15催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应中铂颗粒大小的影响。它揭示了3nm的小颗粒比21nm的大颗粒更活跃但选择性较低。反应速率、结焦形成以及形成的焦炭量在前者明显更高。使用TEOM/GC系统可以从单一催化实验中获取活性、选择性和结焦的全面信息。由于小颗粒上的铂位快速被焦炭失活，难以确定其真正的初始周转频率（TOF）。C3H6的选择性取决于CH和CC键激活的活性比率。

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are effective in enhancing the conversion of olefins into lighter hydrocarbons. Industrial applications include the production of propylene from propane. Recent developments focus on optimizing particle size to balance activity and selectivity. Potential advantages include high efficiency in light olefin conversion and minimal side reactions.

2. Metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are utilized in the dehydrogenation of olefins. They offer a different set of properties compared to noble metals, often providing higher stability under harsh conditions. These catalysts are typically more affordable and can withstand higher temperatures. However, they might exhibit lower activity and selectivity compared to noble metal catalysts.

3. The composition of noble metal-based catalysts is typically characterized by a single precious metal, such as Platinum, which is finely dispersed on a support material. Metal oxide-based catalysts, on the other hand, consist of a combination of metal oxides that may or may not be supported on another material. The choice of composition depends on the specific application and desired performance characteristics.

4. Recent advancements in noble metal-based catalysts involve the optimization of particle size to achieve a balance between activity and selectivity. This allows for more efficient conversion of olefins into desired products while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. Metal oxide-based catalysts are being developed with improved thermal stability and resistance to poisoning by impurities.

5. The effectiveness of noble metal-based catalysts is generally superior to that of metal oxide-based catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, metal oxide catalysts offer cost advantages and may be more suitable for industrial applications requiring high temperature stability and resistance to poisoning.

6. Platinum-based catalysts, especially those with smaller particle sizes, exhibit higher activity in dehydrogenation reactions but are less selective. Larger particle sizes, on the other hand, are less active but more selective, leading to better propene yield. The size of the Pt particles significantly affects the catalytic performance, influencing both the rate of reaction and the selectivity towards desired products.

7. The coupling of TEOM with GC/MS is a powerful analytical technique for studying complex catalytic reactions like dehydrogenation. This method provides comprehensive information on reaction kinetics, selectivity, and byproduct formation, allowing researchers to optimize catalyst design and operating conditions for enhanced performance.

The literature focuses on the effect of platinum particle size on the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt-SBA-15 catalysts. It reveals that smaller particles (3 nm) are more active but less selective, leading to higher rates of coking and coke formation compared to larger particles (21 nm). The support SBA-15 is noted for its lack of acidity, which rules out the effect of acidity on selectivity. The study also suggests that the size of platinum particles affects the reactivity balance between the activation of carbon-carbon (CC) and carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds. The results could shed light on the role of tin in bimetallic catalysts and warrant further investigation. The TEOM coupled with GC/MS is highlighted as a valuable tool for comprehensive analysis of complex catalytic reactions.

The document discusses the effect of platinum particle size on the dehydrogenation of propane. Smaller particles (3 nm) exhibit higher activity and lower selectivity compared to larger particles (21 nm). The smaller particles lead to a faster rate of coke formation, lower selectivity towards propene, and a higher amount of coke produced. The size of the platinum particles plays a crucial role in both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Smaller particles are more active in converting propane but less selective towards propene, while larger particles are less active overall but more selective for propene formation. This information is critical for designing efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, exhibit different compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages compared to metal oxide-based catalysts in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts with smaller particles (3 nm) are found to be more active but less selective in propane dehydrogenation (DHP) compared to catalysts with larger particles (21 nm). This dependence on particle size impacts both the rate of coking and selectivity to coke formation. Smaller particles are more effective for propane conversion and coking, whereas larger particles are less active for both reactions but more selective for propene formation. The size of the particles plays a crucial role in determining the overall performance of the catalyst in DHP reactions. This study highlights the importance of considering particle size when designing rational catalysts for DHP processes.
