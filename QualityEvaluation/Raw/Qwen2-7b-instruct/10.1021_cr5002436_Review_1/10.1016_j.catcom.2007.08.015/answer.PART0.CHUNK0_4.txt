[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."
[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "This work exclusively evaluates the effect of Pt particle size on the activity, selectivity and the degree of coking."
[5] "Consequently, smaller particles are more active for propane conversion and coke formation while, larger particles are less active for both the reactions but more selective for propene formation."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, exhibit different compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages compared to metal oxide-based catalysts in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum catalysts with smaller particles (3 nm) are found to be more active but less selective in propane dehydrogenation (DHP) compared to catalysts with larger particles (21 nm). This dependence on particle size impacts both the rate of coking and selectivity to coke formation. Smaller particles are more effective for propane conversion and coking, whereas larger particles are less active for both reactions but more selective for propene formation. The size of the particles plays a crucial role in determining the overall performance of the catalyst in DHP reactions. This study highlights the importance of considering particle size when designing rational catalysts for DHP processes.

贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，与氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢方面的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展和潜在优势存在差异。与较大颗粒（21 nm）的催化剂相比，具有较小颗粒（3 nm）的铂基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（DHP）反应中表现出更高的活性但选择性较低。颗粒大小对焦化速率和焦油形成的选择性有直接影响。较小的颗粒更适于丙烷转化和焦化，而较大的颗粒在两个反应中活性较低但丙烯形成选择性较高。颗粒尺寸在确定DHP反应催化剂的整体性能时起着关键作用。这项研究强调了在设计合理的DHP过程催化剂时考虑颗粒尺寸的重要性。
