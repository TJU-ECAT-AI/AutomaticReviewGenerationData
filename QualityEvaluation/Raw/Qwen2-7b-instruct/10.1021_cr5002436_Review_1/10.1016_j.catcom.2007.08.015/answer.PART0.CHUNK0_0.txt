[1] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly different Pt particle sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle."

[3] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
[4] "By contrast, Pt particles, which appear as bright spots in the STEM image of Fig. 1b, are homogeneously distributed with a narrow size distribution and average size of 3 nm."
[5] "The most significant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke formation during the reaction."
[6] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
[7] "This is due to the fact that true initial TOF is difficult to determine over Pt-SBA-15-DP due to rapid deactivation of Pt sites by coke as evidenced by the above results."

The document discusses the effect of platinum particle size on the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt-SBA-15 catalysts. It reveals that smaller particles (3 nm) are more active but less selective compared to larger particles (21 nm). The reaction rate, coke formation, and coke amount are significantly higher over the smaller particles. The use of the TEOM/GC system provides comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coke formation from a single catalysis experiment. The true initial turnover frequency (TOF) is difficult to determine over the smaller particles due to rapid deactivation by coke. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation.

文档讨论了在Pt-SBA-15催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应中铂颗粒大小的影响。它揭示了3nm的小颗粒比21nm的大颗粒更活跃但选择性较低。反应速率、结焦形成以及形成的焦炭量在前者明显更高。使用TEOM/GC系统可以从单一催化实验中获取活性、选择性和结焦的全面信息。由于小颗粒上的铂位快速被焦炭失活，难以确定其真正的初始周转频率（TOF）。C3H6的选择性取决于CH和CC键激活的活性比率。
