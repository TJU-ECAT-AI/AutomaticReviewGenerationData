[1] "The recovery of bitumen from oilsands, as well as upgrading to produce a transportable oil product is energy intensive."
[2] "Expressed in terms of an equivalent CO2 footprint, the energy use is of the order of magnitude (500900) kg of CO2 for every m3 of oil."
[3] "The thermal efficiency of SCO production from oilsands is in the same range as that of production of liquids from coal by direct liquefaction processes."
[4] "The contribution of coal mining is not reflected in these thermal efficiencies."
[5] "The CO2 footprint of any energy conversion process is related to the amount of work that has to be performed, as well as the effective H:C ratio of the raw material used in the process."

The energy use in oilsands production and bitumen upgrading is substantial. To produce oil from oilsands, the energy use is equivalent to approximately 500 to 900 kg of CO2 per m3 of oil. The thermal efficiency of producing synthetic crude oil (SCO) from oilsands is around 68%, which is comparable to direct coal liquefaction processes. However, this efficiency does not account for the energy used in coal mining. The CO2 footprint of any energy conversion process is influenced by the amount of work required and the hydrogen-to-carbon (H:C) ratio of the raw material used in the process.

油砂生产及沥青升级的能源使用量巨大。每生产1立方米石油，所需能源相当于大约500至900公斤二氧化碳。从油砂生产合成原油（SCO）的热效率约为68%，与直接煤炭液化过程相当。然而，这个效率并未考虑煤炭开采所用的能源。任何能源转换过程的二氧化碳排放量，受到所需工作量和原料中氢-碳（H:C）比的影响。
