[1] "The two largest oilsands deposits in the world are located in Venezuela and in Canada [46]."
[2] "Native bitumen also has use in road construction and as building materials [9], although these are minor applications for oilsands derived bitumen, which is mainly used in energy production."
[3] "The estimated production life of a SAGD well pair is around 15 years, with an ultimate bitumen recovery of (7080) % for continuous steam feed production and (2030) % for CSS."
[4] "The main sources of energy use during oil production from oilsands are steam generation for bitumen recovery, firing of bitumen upgrading processes and H2 production."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of the literature provided, there is no direct comparison or discussion made. The document focuses on the production and processing of oilsands, including extraction, recovery, and upgrading of bitumen. It does not delve into the specifics of catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

However, it is worth noting that in the context of oil sands processing, noble metals like platinum might be used in the upgrading of bitumen due to their ability to catalyze certain reactions efficiently. Metal oxides, on the other hand, could potentially be utilized in various steps of the process, such as in the initial extraction or in water treatment. For instance, the mention of naphthenic acids dissolution and water toxicity suggests that metal oxides might play a role in water treatment processes to remove or neutralize these substances.

In summary, while the document does not directly compare noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts in the context of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, it does hint at the potential roles these types of catalysts could play in the broader context of oilsands processing. A comprehensive review of catalysts used in the specific chemical processes described in the document would be necessary to fully understand their comparative effectiveness and industrial applications.

The document does not provide any recent developments or potential advantages regarding the use of these catalysts in the field. It focuses more on the technical aspects of oilsands production, such as extraction methods, bitumen recovery, and upgrading processes. Therefore, for a detailed comparison of catalysts used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation, one would need to refer to other sources that specifically discuss catalysts in this context.

文档没有直接比较贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂，和金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃过程中的应用。它主要关注油砂的生产与处理，包括沥青的提取、回收和升级。这并没有详细讨论在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中使用的催化剂的具体比较。

然而，值得注意的是，在油砂处理的背景下，贵金属如铂可能被用于沥青的升级，因为它们能够高效催化某些反应。金属氧化物则可能在过程的各个阶段中使用，例如初始提取或水处理。例如，提到naphthenic酸溶解和水毒性表明金属氧化物可能在水处理过程中发挥角色，以去除或中和这些物质。

总之，虽然文档没有直接比较贵金属催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃过程中的应用，但它暗示了这些类型的催化剂在更广泛意义上可能在油砂处理中的潜在作用。为了全面理解这些催化剂在文档描述的特定化学过程中的比较有效性及其工业应用，需要对催化剂进行综合审查。

文档没有提供任何关于这些催化剂在该领域最近发展的详细信息或潜在优势。它更多地关注油砂生产的技术方面，如提取方法、沥青回收和升级过程。因此，为了详细了解用于非氧化脱氢的催化剂的具体比较，需要参考其他来源，这些来源专门讨论了这一领域的催化剂。
