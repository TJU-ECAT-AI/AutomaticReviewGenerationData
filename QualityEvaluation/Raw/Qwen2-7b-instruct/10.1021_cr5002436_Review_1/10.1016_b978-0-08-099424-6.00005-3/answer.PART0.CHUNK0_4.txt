<quotes>
The recovery of bitumen from oilsands, as well as upgrading to produce a transportable oil product is energy intensive. Expressed in terms of an equivalent CO2 footprint, the energy use is of the order of magnitude (500900) kg of CO2 for every m3 of oil [1]. The main sources of energy use during oil production from oilsands are steam generation for bitumen recovery, firing of bitumen upgrading processes and H2 production.
