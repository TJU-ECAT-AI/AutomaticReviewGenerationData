[1] "The two largest oilsands deposits in the world are located in Venezuela and in Canada [46]."
[2] "The quality of the oilsands ore varies and the cut-off for economic recovery is presently 6 wt% bitumen [1,4]."
[3] "The density of bitumen is close to that of water."
[4] "In order to facilitate gravity phase separation, the extracted slurry must be aerated to separate the bitumen as a froth phase from the water and mineral matter."
[5] "The bitumen is recovered from the oilsands ore is performed using the Clark hot water extraction process."
[6] "The viscosity of the bitumen can be decreased by increasing the temperature or by dissolving the bitumen in a light solvent."
[7] "The estimated production life of a SAGD well pair is around 15 years,with an ultimate bitumen recovery of (7080) % for continuous steam feed production and (2030) % for CSS."
[8] "The main sources of energy use during oil production from oilsands are steam generation for bitumen recovery, firing of bitumen upgrading processes and H2 production."

1. The two largest oilsand deposits are found in Venezuela and Canada.
2. Economic recovery cut-off is 6 wt% bitumen.
3. Bitumen density is nearly equal to water density.
4. Gravity phase separation is facilitated by aeration of the extracted slurry.
5. Hot water extraction is used for bitumen recovery from oilsand ores.
6. Bitumen viscosity can be reduced by increasing temperature or dissolving in a light solvent.
7. SAGD well pairs have a production life of about 15 years and can recover 70-80% of bitumen with continuous steam feed, or 20-30% with cyclic steam stimulation.
8. Major energy uses in oil production from oilsands include steam generation, bitumen upgrading processes, and hydrogen production.
