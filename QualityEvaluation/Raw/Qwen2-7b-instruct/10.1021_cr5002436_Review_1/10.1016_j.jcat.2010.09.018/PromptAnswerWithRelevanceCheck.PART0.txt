[1] "The majority of literature work mainly concentrates on the characterization of catalyst systems before and after only one dehydrogenation cycle; the study of Padro et al. in which multiple regeneration steps were employed is the only notable exception."
[2] "The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions."
[3] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."
[4] "In the presence of Sn, the light products that are produced are ethane and methane in equimolar amounts, which is typical for a metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis reaction."
[5] "However, despite the amount of coke formed, PtASn/Al2O3 exhibits a much higher selectivity to propene and the amount of propene increases together with propane conversion with time on stream, displaying better catalyst stability than the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (specifically Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals several key differences:

1. **Effectiveness and Industrial Applications**: Platinum-based catalysts are highly effective due to their excellent activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, they suffer from fast deactivation due to coke formation. Metal oxide catalysts, particularly metal oxides such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer alternative routes for dehydrogenation reactions with varying effectiveness depending on the specific application. Metal oxides can exhibit different selectivities and stabilities compared to noble metals, making them suitable for specific reactions or environments.

2. **Recent Developments**: Recent studies focus on improving the stability and selectivity of catalysts, especially in the context of propane dehydrogenation. For instance, the addition of metals like Sn as promoters can enhance the catalytic behavior of Pt-based catalysts, reducing deactivation rates and improving propene selectivity. Metal oxides may also undergo advancements in synthesis methods, loading, and support materials to optimize their performance in various dehydrogenation processes.

3. **Potential Advantages**: Noble metals like Platinum offer superior activity but suffer from rapid deactivation. Metal oxides, on the other hand, can be tailored to have specific properties (e.g., high stability, improved selectivity) by adjusting their composition and synthesis conditions. They might also be more cost-effective alternatives, depending on the specific industrial application and the desired reaction conditions.

4. **Composition**: Noble metal-based catalysts typically involve a single metal (e.g., Platinum) or a combination of noble metals, whereas metal oxide catalysts consist of metal oxides, which can be pure or mixed. The presence of metal oxides can influence the acidity or basicity of the catalyst, affecting its reactivity towards different substrates.

5. **Industrial Applications**: Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in commercial alkane dehydrogenation processes due to their high activity. Metal oxide catalysts are explored for their potential in reactions requiring different properties, such as enhanced selectivity for specific products or resistance to certain deactivation mechanisms.

[1] "The work makes use of two separate in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing, plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measurements with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while performing in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements."
[2] "The majority of literature work mainly concentrates on the characterization of catalyst systems before and after only one dehydrogenation cycle; the study of Pa- dro et al. in which multiple regeneration steps were employed is the only notable exception."
[3] "The addition of Sn decreases the Pt particle size and thus creates more centers on the surface available for CO adsorption. However, the lower amount of CO observed here suggests that Sn partially covers those centers as observed in our predicted models based on the EXAFS analysis."

1. The research employs two in situ reactor setups for studying the dehydrogenation catalysts: a powder-containing plug-flow reactor for online activity measurement with UVVis and Raman spectroscopy, and a flow-through cell with a pressed pellet sample for monitoring products and performing X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

2. Most previous studies focused on catalyst characterization before and after a single dehydrogenation cycle. The study by Pador et al. is an exception that utilized multiple regeneration steps.

3. The presence of Sn leads to smaller Pt particle sizes, creating more CO adsorption sites. However, the reduced CO amount indicates that Sn partly covers these sites, as predicted by EXAFS analysis.

1. 研究采用了两种原位反应器设置：用于在线活性测量和同时记录原位紫外可见光谱和拉曼光谱数据的粉末包含分流反应器，以及用于监测出口产物并进行原位高能分辨率荧光检测X射线吸收光谱（XAS）测量的流过式细胞使用压制颗粒样本。

2. 大多数文献工作主要集中在催化剂系统在单个脱氢化周期前后进行表征；Pador等人进行的研究是唯一采用多次再生步骤的显著例外。

3. 添加Sn导致Pt颗粒尺寸减小，从而在表面上创造了更多的CO吸附点。然而，观察到的较低CO量表明Sn部分覆盖了这些点，这与基于EXAFS分析的预测模型相符。

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as propane,is of great commercial interest due to the growing demand of pro- pene as an important base chemical intermediate."
[2] "However, this catalyst system suffers from fast deactivation due to coke formation."
[3] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability."
[4] "The regeneration treatment typically consists of exposing the coked catalyst to air or oxygen at high temperatures to burn the deposits, followed by a reduction step to bring back the active form of the catalyst (i.e., metallic Pt)."
[5] "Therefore, unfortunately to date,it has not been possible to extract conclusive information regarding the basic principles of catalyst operation/deactivation of this important catalyst system under real reaction conditions."
</quotes>

Answer: Platinum-based catalysts are highly effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their exceptional activity. However, they suffer from rapid deactivation caused by coke formation. Adding tin (Sn) as a promoter helps alter the product distribution by inhibiting hydrogenolysis, isomerization, cracking, and coke formation, which enhances the catalyst's selectivity and stability. The regeneration process involves burning off the coke deposits at high temperatures followed by a reduction step to restore the active form of the catalyst, typically metallic platinum. Unfortunately, extracting definitive information about the catalyst's operational and deactivation principles under real reaction conditions remains challenging.

铂基催化剂对于烷烃脱氢反应具有极高的活性。然而，它们由于焦炭形成而迅速失活。添加锡（Sn）作为促进剂有助于通过抑制氢解、异构化、裂解和焦炭形成来改变产品分布，从而增强催化剂的选择性和稳定性。再生过程包括在高温下燃烧掉催化剂上的焦炭沉积物，然后进行还原步骤以恢复催化剂的活性形式，通常是金属铂。不幸的是，提取关于在真实反应条件下催化剂的操作和失活原理的明确信息仍然具有挑战性。

[1] "The catalytic performance of Pt and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles has been studied under realistic reaction conditions."
[2] "The results obtained from these innovative real-time characterization studies show a difference in behavior for the catalyst materials (in the presence/absence of Sn as promoter) with regard to both propane dehydrogenation/activation and coke formation (in both the amount and type of coke formed)."
[3] "Interestingly, despite this gradual catalyst deactivation, the net conversion during the experiment is always higher for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."
[5] "The addition of Sn decreases the particle size of the Pt nanoclusters as lower coordination numbers are obtained for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material."
[6] "In order to determine the distribution of Pt and Sn in the bimetallic structure for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst at the different stages:fresh, after 1 and 10 cycles, a series of models were created where the influence of the bimetal distribution on the coordination number for the first two coordination shells was examined."

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are known for their effectiveness and are widely utilized in various industrial applications. Recent developments have focused on improving their performance and stability. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been explored for these purposes. These catalysts offer potential advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. The presence of Sn as a promoter in Platinum-based catalysts improves their performance by modifying the electronic properties of Platinum, leading to enhanced activation of propane. Additionally, Sn promotes a drain-off effect, which keeps the Pt sites clean by removing coke precursors, thus preventing deactivation. The addition of Sn to Platinum results in a decrease in the particle size of the Pt nanoclusters, which could contribute to improved catalytic activity and stability. Through modeling based on EXAFS analysis, the distribution of Pt and Sn in the bimetallic structure of the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst has been determined at different stages of use, revealing how the catalyst evolves over time and how the bimetallic structure affects its performance.
