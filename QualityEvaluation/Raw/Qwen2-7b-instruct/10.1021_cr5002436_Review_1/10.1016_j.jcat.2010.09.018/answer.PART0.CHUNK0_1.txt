[1] "The majority of literature work mainly concentrates on the characterization of catalyst systems before and after only one dehydrogenation cycle; the study of Padro et al. in which multiple regeneration steps were employed is the only notable exception."
[2] "The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions."
[3] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."
[4] "In the presence of Sn, the light products that are produced are ethane and methane in equimolar amounts, which is typical for a metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis reaction."
[5] "However, despite the amount of coke formed, PtASn/Al2O3 exhibits a much higher selectivity to propene and the amount of propene increases together with propane conversion with time on stream, displaying better catalyst stability than the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."

Comparing noble metal-based catalysts (specifically Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals several key differences:

1. **Effectiveness and Industrial Applications**: Platinum-based catalysts are highly effective due to their excellent activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, they suffer from fast deactivation due to coke formation. Metal oxide catalysts, particularly metal oxides such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, offer alternative routes for dehydrogenation reactions with varying effectiveness depending on the specific application. Metal oxides can exhibit different selectivities and stabilities compared to noble metals, making them suitable for specific reactions or environments.

2. **Recent Developments**: Recent studies focus on improving the stability and selectivity of catalysts, especially in the context of propane dehydrogenation. For instance, the addition of metals like Sn as promoters can enhance the catalytic behavior of Pt-based catalysts, reducing deactivation rates and improving propene selectivity. Metal oxides may also undergo advancements in synthesis methods, loading, and support materials to optimize their performance in various dehydrogenation processes.

3. **Potential Advantages**: Noble metals like Platinum offer superior activity but suffer from rapid deactivation. Metal oxides, on the other hand, can be tailored to have specific properties (e.g., high stability, improved selectivity) by adjusting their composition and synthesis conditions. They might also be more cost-effective alternatives, depending on the specific industrial application and the desired reaction conditions.

4. **Composition**: Noble metal-based catalysts typically involve a single metal (e.g., Platinum) or a combination of noble metals, whereas metal oxide catalysts consist of metal oxides, which can be pure or mixed. The presence of metal oxides can influence the acidity or basicity of the catalyst, affecting its reactivity towards different substrates.

5. **Industrial Applications**: Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in commercial alkane dehydrogenation processes due to their high activity. Metal oxide catalysts are explored for their potential in reactions requiring different properties, such as enhanced selectivity for specific products or resistance to certain deactivation mechanisms.

比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂（尤其是铂）和金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的几个关键差异：

1. **有效性与工业应用**：铂基催化剂由于其在烷烃脱氢反应中的出色活性而非常有效。然而，它们由于焦炭形成而快速失效。金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物），对于特定的应用具有不同的效果。金属氧化物可能以不同的选择性和稳定性相对于贵金属进行脱氢反应。金属氧化物可能根据特定的应用或所需的反应条件优化其性能。

2. **最新进展**：最近的研究集中在提高催化剂的有效性和稳定性上，特别是在丙烷脱氢反应的上下文。例如，添加金属如Sn作为促进剂可以增强Pt基催化剂的催化行为，降低失活速率并提高丙烯选择性。金属氧化物也可能通过调整合成方法、负载和支撑材料来优化其性能，以适应各种脱氢过程。

3. **潜在优势**：贵金属如铂提供优越的活性，但容易快速失效。金属氧化物可以根据特定的应用和所需反应条件进行调整，以具有特定的特性（例如高稳定性、改进的选择性）。它们可能在成本效益方面更具吸引力。

4. **组成**：贵金属基催化剂通常涉及单一金属（例如铂）或多种贵金属的组合，而金属氧化物催化剂由金属氧化物组成，可能是纯的或混合的。金属氧化物的存在可以影响催化剂的酸碱性，从而影响其对不同底物的反应性。

5. **工业应用**：铂基催化剂广泛应用于商业烷烃脱氢过程，由于其高活性。金属氧化物催化剂则被探索用于需要不同性质的反应，例如特定产品的高选择性或对抗某些失活机制的抵抗力。
