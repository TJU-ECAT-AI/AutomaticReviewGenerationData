[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as propane,is of great commercial interest due to the growing demand of pro- pene as an important base chemical intermediate."
[2] "However, this catalyst system suffers from fast deactivation due to coke formation."
[3] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability."
[4] "The regeneration treatment typically consists of exposing the coked catalyst to air or oxygen at high temperatures to burn the deposits, followed by a reduction step to bring back the active form of the catalyst (i.e., metallic Pt)."
[5] "Therefore, unfortunately to date,it has not been possible to extract conclusive information regarding the basic principles of catalyst operation/deactivation of this important catalyst system under real reaction conditions."

Answer: Platinum-based catalysts are highly effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their exceptional activity. However, they suffer from rapid deactivation caused by coke formation. Adding tin (Sn) as a promoter helps alter the product distribution by inhibiting hydrogenolysis, isomerization, cracking, and coke formation, which enhances the catalyst's selectivity and stability. The regeneration process involves burning off the coke deposits at high temperatures followed by a reduction step to restore the active form of the catalyst, typically metallic platinum. Unfortunately, extracting definitive information about the catalyst's operational and deactivation principles under real reaction conditions remains challenging.

铂基催化剂对于烷烃脱氢反应具有极高的活性。然而，它们由于焦炭形成而迅速失活。添加锡（Sn）作为促进剂有助于通过抑制氢解、异构化、裂解和焦炭形成来改变产品分布，从而增强催化剂的选择性和稳定性。再生过程包括在高温下燃烧掉催化剂上的焦炭沉积物，然后进行还原步骤以恢复催化剂的活性形式，通常是金属铂。不幸的是，提取关于在真实反应条件下催化剂的操作和失活原理的明确信息仍然具有挑战性。
