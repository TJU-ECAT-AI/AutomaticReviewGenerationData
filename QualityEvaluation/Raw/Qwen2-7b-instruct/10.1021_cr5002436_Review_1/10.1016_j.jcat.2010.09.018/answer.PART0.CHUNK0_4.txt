[1] "The catalytic performance of Pt and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles has been studied under realistic reaction conditions."
[2] "The results obtained from these innovative real-time characterization studies show a difference in behavior for the catalyst materials (in the presence/absence of Sn as promoter) with regard to both propane dehydrogenation/activation and coke formation (in both the amount and type of coke formed)."
[3] "Interestingly, despite this gradual catalyst deactivation, the net conversion during the experiment is always higher for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."
[5] "The addition of Sn decreases the particle size of the Pt nanoclusters as lower coordination numbers are obtained for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material."
[6] "In order to determine the distribution of Pt and Sn in the bimetallic structure for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst at the different stages:fresh, after 1 and 10 cycles, a series of models were created where the influence of the bimetal distribution on the coordination number for the first two coordination shells was examined."

The noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, are used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are known for their effectiveness and are widely utilized in various industrial applications. Recent developments have focused on improving their performance and stability. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been explored for these purposes. These catalysts offer potential advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. The presence of Sn as a promoter in Platinum-based catalysts improves their performance by modifying the electronic properties of Platinum, leading to enhanced activation of propane. Additionally, Sn promotes a drain-off effect, which keeps the Pt sites clean by removing coke precursors, thus preventing deactivation. The addition of Sn to Platinum results in a decrease in the particle size of the Pt nanoclusters, which could contribute to improved catalytic activity and stability. Through modeling based on EXAFS analysis, the distribution of Pt and Sn in the bimetallic structure of the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst has been determined at different stages of use, revealing how the catalyst evolves over time and how the bimetallic structure affects its performance.

在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃的过程中，主要使用的是贵金属催化剂，尤其是铂。这些催化剂因其有效性而广为人知，并且在各种工业应用中得到广泛应用。最近的研究重点是提高其性能和稳定性。此外，也探索了诸如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物作为催化剂的可能性。这些催化剂在成本效益和环境影响方面具有潜在优势。在铂基催化剂中加入锡作为一种促进剂，可以改善其性能，通过修改铂的电子性质，从而增强丙烷的活化。此外，锡还可以促进一种排泄效应，将沉积在活性位点附近的焦炭前体移除至支持物上，从而防止催化剂失活。向铂中添加锡导致铂纳米簇的颗粒尺寸减小，这可能有助于提高催化活性和稳定性。基于EXAFS分析的建模揭示了在不同使用阶段PtASn/Al2O3双金属催化剂中Pt和Sn的分布情况，展示了催化剂随时间演变的方式以及双金属结构对其性能的影响。
