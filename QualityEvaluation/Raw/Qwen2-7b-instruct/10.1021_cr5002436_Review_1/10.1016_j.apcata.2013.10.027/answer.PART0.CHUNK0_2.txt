The research examines how -Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment impacts the formation and properties of platinum sites in Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts. The catalysts were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The findings revealed that the hydrothermal process significantly improved the dispersion of platinum particles and increased their stability. The treated catalyst demonstrated superior activity and selectivity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins compared to the untreated version. This enhancement is credited to the optimized interaction between platinum and alumina, influencing the electronic structure and catalytic sites.

本文研究了-Al2O3水热处理对铂位点在Pt/-Al2O3催化剂中形成和性质的影响。通过X射线衍射、透射电子显微镜和原位X射线吸收光谱对催化剂进行了分析。结果表明，水热处理显著提高了铂颗粒的分散度和稳定性。改性催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢反应中的活性和选择性比未改性催化剂更高。这种改进归因于铂与氧化铝之间的优化相互作用，影响了电子结构和催化位点。
