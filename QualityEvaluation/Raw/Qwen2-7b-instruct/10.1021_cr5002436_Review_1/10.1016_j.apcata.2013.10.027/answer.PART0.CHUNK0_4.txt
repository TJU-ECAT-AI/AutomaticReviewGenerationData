The scientific literature discusses the effect of -Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment on the formation and properties of platinum sites in Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It compares noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. The study highlights how the presence of Al2O3 modifies the electronic structure of the Pt surface, affecting its reactivity. Metal oxide-based catalysts are noted to offer more stability and potentially lower costs compared to noble metal-based catalysts. Recent advancements aim to improve the activity and selectivity of these catalysts through various modifications.
