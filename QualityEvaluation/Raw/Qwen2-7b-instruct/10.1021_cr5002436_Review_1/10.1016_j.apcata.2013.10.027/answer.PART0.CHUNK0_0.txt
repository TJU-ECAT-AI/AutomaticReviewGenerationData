The study examined how -Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment affects the formation and properties of platinum sites in Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts. The catalysts were created by soaking Pt onto an -Al2O3 support under different conditions. The researchers used XRD, TEM, and H2-TPR to analyze the catalysts. The results revealed that the hydrothermal process resulted in better dispersion of platinum particles, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. The optimized catalyst showed high selectivity for the desired products during the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Moreover, the study underscored the importance of oxygen vacancies produced during the hydrothermal treatment in boosting the catalytic performance.
