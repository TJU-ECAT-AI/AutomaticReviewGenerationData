The study examines how -Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment impacts platinum sites in Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts, resulting in improved dispersion of platinum on the alumina support. This leads to an increased surface area of platinum sites, enhancing the catalyst's activity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Compared to uncatalyzed reactions and other catalyst types, these optimized Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts demonstrate superior performance. Recent advancements in noble metal-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation involve tailoring the composition and structure through advanced synthesis methods. Metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides have also been investigated for improving the selectivity and efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.
