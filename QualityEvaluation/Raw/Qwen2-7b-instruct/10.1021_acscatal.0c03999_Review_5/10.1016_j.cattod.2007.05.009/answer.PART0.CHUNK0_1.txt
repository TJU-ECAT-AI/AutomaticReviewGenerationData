[1] "A great number of papers deal with the study of the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in propane and ethane ODH."
[2] "Some significant points concerning the reactivity of these systems are:"
[3] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[4] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[5] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[6] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[7] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
[8] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41."
[9] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[10] "For each catalyst, the best olefin yield value is given, obtained in correspondence to a set value of conversion and selectivity."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their unique pore structures, high surface area, and tunable acidity. Zeolites can be modified to optimize catalytic performance through various strategies such as dealumination and weakening methods, which adjust the acidity of the support. These modifications can enhance the selectivity and activity of the catalysts by creating a more favorable environment for the desired reaction pathways. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the desired level of acidity, and the specific reaction conditions. For example, dealumination can be used to weaken the acidic sites, leading to improved selectivity for the desired product. Conversely, weakening methods might involve the introduction of Lewis bases or modifiers to reduce acidity. The choice of strategy should be guided by the specific requirements of the catalytic process, including the desired product, conversion levels, and reaction conditions.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，沸石作为支撑材料具有独特的孔结构、高表面积和可调酸性，使其成为有前景的选择。通过不同的策略如去铝化和削弱法来调整支撑材料的酸性，可以优化催化剂性能并提高选择性和活性。这些调整可以通过创造更有利于目标反应途径的环境来实现。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括使用的沸石类型、期望的酸度水平以及特定的反应条件。例如，去铝化可以用于减弱酸性位点，从而提高所需产品的选择性。相反，削弱方法可能涉及引入Lewis碱或修饰剂以降低酸性。应根据催化过程的具体要求（如所需产品、转化水平和反应条件）来选择策略。
