[1] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [4-21]."
[2] "In the case of propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[3] "The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH [45]."
[4] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors [27,37,46,47,51-75]."
[5] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41 [49,100-111], MCM-48 [112], or SBA-15 [112-115]."
[6] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116]."
[7] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems [181,187,189,263-269]."

1. A wide range of reviews on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s.
2. The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts for propane ODH increases with the loading of V2O5, reaching a peak on domains of intermediate size, balancing the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants.
3. In ethane ODH, COx formation mainly stems from adsorbed O species.
4. Many studies have explored how the support affects the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH.
5. Zeolitic materials like MCM-41, MCM-48, and SBA-15 are examples of high-surface-area supports used in vanadium oxide-based catalysts.
6. In VCoAPO-18, the coexistence of acid sites (from Co2+ cations) and redox sites (from V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) contributes to high ethylene selectivity during ethane ODH.
7. Combinatorial/parallel systems and genetic algorithms have significantly advanced the creation and examination of catalytic systems, facilitating the discovery of new catalysts.
