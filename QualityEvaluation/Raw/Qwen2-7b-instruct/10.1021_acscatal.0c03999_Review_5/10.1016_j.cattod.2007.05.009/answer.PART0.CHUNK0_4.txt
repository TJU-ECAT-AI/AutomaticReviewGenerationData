[1] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
[2] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[3] "An outstanding value of ethylene productivity, close to 10 kg olefin per kg of catalyst per hour, has been reported for a VOx-MCM-48 catalyst containing 2.8 wt.% vanadium oxide."
[4] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique structure and acidity. Zeolites, with their microporous framework, provide a highly controlled environment for reactant adsorption and product release. Their acidity is crucial for the dehydrogenation process, facilitating the breaking of carbon-hydrogen bonds.

Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, are employed to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite framework, which can enhance acidity by decreasing the framework's rigidity and promoting more open access to active sites. Weakening methods involve altering the zeolite's framework to weaken its structure, potentially increasing the accessibility of active sites and improving the catalyst's performance.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the desired level of acidity, and the impact on the catalyst's stability and selectivity. Different zeolite structures require tailored modification approaches to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The effectiveness of these strategies is typically evaluated through comparative studies, assessing the catalysts' activity, selectivity, and stability under various reaction conditions.

The use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection, has significantly advanced the development of new catalytic systems. These methodologies enable the preparation and screening of a vast number of catalyst formulations, accelerating the discovery of high-performance catalysts for CO2-ODHP. By systematically varying catalyst components and preparation conditions, researchers can identify optimal combinations that enhance the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of CO2-ODHP catalysts.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的有前景特性涉及理解它们的独特结构和酸性。沸石，以其微孔框架提供了一个高度控制的环境，用于反应物吸附和产物释放。其酸性对于脱氢过程至关重要，能够促进碳-氢键的断裂。

各种酸度修改技术，如去铝化和减弱，被用来优化催化性能。去铝化通过减少沸石骨架中的铝含量来增强酸度，降低框架的刚性并促进活性位点的开放访问。减弱方法涉及改变沸石的框架以削弱其结构，可能增加活性位点的可接近性并提高催化剂的性能。

在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石类型、所需的酸度水平以及对催化剂稳定性和选择性的影响。不同的沸石结构需要定制的修改方法以实现最佳催化性能。这些策略的有效性通常通过比较研究来评估，评估催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性在不同反应条件下的表现。

组合/并行系统，包括遗传算法和进化催化剂选择方法，极大地推动了新催化系统的开发。这些方法允许准备和筛选大量催化剂配方，加速了高性能CO2-ODHP催化剂的发现。通过系统地改变催化剂组分和制备条件，研究人员可以识别出增强CO2-ODHP催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的最佳组合。
