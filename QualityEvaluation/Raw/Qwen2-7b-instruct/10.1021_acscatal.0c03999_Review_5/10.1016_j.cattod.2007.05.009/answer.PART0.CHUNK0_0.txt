[1] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
[2] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48 or SBA-15."
[3] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[4] "The best catalytic performance can be achieved with highly dispersed two-dimensional molybdenum species, which fully encapsulate the alumina surface."
[5] "Propane ODH turnover rates decreases monotonically while increasing both the dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide (Cs > K > Li)."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we find that zeolites are favored for their high surface area, pore structure, and ability to modify acidity. Zeolites can be optimized for CO2-ODHP catalysis through various methods, including dealumination and weakening techniques. Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, which can enhance the acidity of the remaining framework. This is particularly useful for zeolites with high aluminum content, as it can improve their catalytic performance by altering the acidity distribution within the zeolite. Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve reducing the strength of the zeolite framework, which can also affect acidity. These modifications are critical in optimizing catalytic performance, as they can influence the rate of CO2 adsorption, activation, and the subsequent dehydrogenation process. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used (e.g., zeolite A, zeolite Y, or zeolite ZSM-5), the specific acidity requirements for the CO2-ODHP reaction, and the desired level of selectivity and efficiency in the catalytic process.

分析用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的沸石作为支撑材料的特性，我们发现，沸石因其高比表面积、孔结构和酸性调整能力而成为有前景的选择。通过多种方法优化沸石用于CO2-ODHP催化，包括脱铝和削弱技术。脱铝是指从沸石骨架中去除铝原子，这可以增强剩余框架的酸性。对于高铝含量的沸石来说，这种方法特别有用，因为它可以通过改变骨架内的酸分布来改善其催化性能。削弱方法涉及减弱沸石骨架的强度，这也会影响酸性。这些修改对于优化催化性能至关重要，因为它们可以影响CO2吸附、活化以及随后的脱氢过程的速度。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石类型（如沸石A、沸石Y或沸石ZSM-5）、CO2-ODHP反应所需的特定酸性和希望达到的选分离子和效率水平。
