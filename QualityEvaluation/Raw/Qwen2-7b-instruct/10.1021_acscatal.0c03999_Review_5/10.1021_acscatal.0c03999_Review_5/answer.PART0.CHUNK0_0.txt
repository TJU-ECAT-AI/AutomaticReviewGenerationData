3.3. Zeolite-Supported Catalysts
"As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2ODHP."

3.3.1. Dealumination
"To selectively activate CH bond rather than CC bond, the modification of acid sites is critical, especially the strong acid sites."

3.3.1.1. Acid Treatment
"For comparison, AlBeta is prepared by simple calcination of TEABeta with a lower Si/Al ratio of 17."

3.3.1.2. Steaming Treatment
"The presence of strong acid sites on HZSM-5 can facilitate the conjugated effect of protons and gallium oxide, resulting in promoted activity."

3.3.2. Surface Acidity Weakening
"Increasing Si/Al ratios is an option to weaken the acidity."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporosity with a large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These features are crucial for selectively activating CH bonds rather than CC bonds. Dealumination is a technique widely used to eliminate surface acidity, which can be achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments at specific temperatures. Steaming treatments not only reduce the number of acid sites on zeolite surfaces but also weaken the interaction between metal oxides and the zeolite, potentially enhancing catalytic performance. Additionally, weakening acidity can be accomplished by tuning the aluminum amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework to displace original strong Brnsted acid sites. The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the type of zeolite used as a support, considering factors such as pore size, Si/Al molar ratio, and the presence of weak acid sites that can lead to side reactions or deactivation.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂，沸石作为支撑材料具有以下特点：微孔结构、大的比表面积、可调酸性以及良好的热稳定性。这些特性对于选择性激活CH键而非CC键至关重要。去铝化是一种广泛使用的消除表面酸性的技术，可以通过酸处理或在特定温度下的蒸气处理来实现。蒸气处理不仅可以减少沸石表面上的酸性位点数量，还可以减弱金属氧化物与沸石之间的相互作用，可能增强催化性能。此外，通过调整铝的含量或在沸石骨架中引入另一种元素来置换原有的强Brnsted酸位点可以削弱酸性。这些策略的选择和实施取决于所使用的沸石类型，考虑因素包括孔径大小、Si/Al摩尔比以及可能导致副反应或失活的弱酸位点的存在。
