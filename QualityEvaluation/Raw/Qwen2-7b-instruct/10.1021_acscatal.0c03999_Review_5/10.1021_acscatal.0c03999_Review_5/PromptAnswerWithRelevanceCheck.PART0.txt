The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporosity with a large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These features are crucial for selectively activating CH bonds rather than CC bonds. Dealumination is a technique widely used to eliminate surface acidity, which can be achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments at specific temperatures. Steaming treatments not only reduce the number of acid sites on zeolite surfaces but also weaken the interaction between metal oxides and the zeolite, potentially enhancing catalytic performance. Additionally, weakening acidity can be accomplished by tuning the aluminum amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework to displace original strong Brnsted acid sites. The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the type of zeolite used as a support, considering factors such as pore size, Si/Al molar ratio, and the presence of weak acid sites that can lead to side reactions or deactivation.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂，沸石作为支撑材料具有以下特点：微孔结构、大的比表面积、可调酸性以及良好的热稳定性。这些特性对于选择性激活CH键而非CC键至关重要。去铝化是一种广泛使用的消除表面酸性的技术，可以通过酸处理或在特定温度下的蒸气处理来实现。蒸气处理不仅可以减少沸石表面上的酸性位点数量，还可以减弱金属氧化物与沸石之间的相互作用，可能增强催化性能。此外，通过调整铝的含量或在沸石骨架中引入另一种元素来置换原有的强Brnsted酸位点可以削弱酸性。这些策略的选择和实施取决于所使用的沸石类型，考虑因素包括孔径大小、Si/Al摩尔比以及可能导致副反应或失活的弱酸位点的存在。

[2] "Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment and steaming treatments at temperatures."
[3] "Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."
[4] "As listed in Table 6, C3H8 and CO2 conversion and C3H6 selectivity show an increase with an increase in Cr loading on Cr-SiBeta catalysts under the same reaction conditions, and are all higher than those on Cr-AlBeta."
[5] "The steaming treatment results in the autoreduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ which is located at the ion-exchange sites in the vicinity of boron sites."

1. Zeolites are considered promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their unique properties including microporosity with a large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These characteristics enable them to effectively manage the dispersion of metals and preserve redox Cr species, significantly influencing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP.

2. To modify the acidity of zeolite supports, dealumination techniques, involving acid treatment or steaming treatments at specific temperatures, are widely employed. Additionally, adjusting the aluminum content within the zeolite framework or incorporating other elements can displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites, leading to acidity weakening.

3. The experimental data in Table 6 indicates that increasing the chromium loading on Cr-SiBeta catalysts, which have undergone dealumination, leads to enhanced C3H8 and CO2 conversion alongside a higher C3H6 selectivity compared to Cr-AlBeta catalysts.

4. In the context of acidity modification, steaming treatments play a crucial role in eliminating acid sites or reducing their strength by autoreducing some chromium (Cr) ions from hexavalent (Cr6+) to trivalent (Cr3+) forms. This process affects the interactions between the catalyst components, particularly gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and HZSM-5 zeolite, potentially impacting the catalyst's performance.

5. Excessive acid sites on zeolite supports can lead to detrimental effects on catalytic activity and stability due to the promotion of side reactions that result in coke formation. This clogging of 2D channels within the zeolite structure hinders the efficient operation of the catalyst.

6. Reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 zeolite is identified as a more effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of the CO2-ODHP reaction, specifically in boosting the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6. This approach contrasts with methods aimed at weakening the acidity of the zeolite support, which may not achieve the same level of effectiveness in promoting desired chemical transformations.

1. 由于其独特的微孔结构、大表面积、可调酸性和出色的热稳定性，沸石被认为是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支撑材料。这些特性使得它们能够有效地管理金属的分散和保持Cr物种的还原性，显著影响CO2-ODHP的催化性能。

2. 对于沸石支撑材料的酸度调整，通常采用去铝化技术，包括酸处理或在特定温度下的蒸气处理。此外，通过调整沸石框架中的铝含量或引入其他元素来置换原始强Brnsted酸位点，可以实现酸度的减弱。

3. 表6的数据表明，在相同的反应条件下，Cr-SiBeta催化剂上的铬负载增加导致C3H8和CO2的转化率提高，以及C3H6选择性的增加，这比Cr-AlBeta催化剂高出许多。

4. 在酸度调整的背景下，蒸气处理在消除酸位或降低其强度方面发挥着关键作用，通过将某些铬离子从六价（Cr6+）还原为三价（Cr3+）形式。这一过程可能会影响催化剂组件之间的相互作用，特别是镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和HZSM-5沸石，从而可能影响催化剂的性能。

5. 过多的酸位在沸石支撑材料上可能导致有害效果，因为它们促进了促进焦炭形成并导致活性和稳定性的副作用。这种堵塞2D通道的焦炭会阻碍催化剂的有效运行。

6. 减少HZSM-5沸石上的酸位数量被确认为提高CO2-ODHP反应催化性能的有效策略，特别是在促进C3H8转化为C3H6时。这种方法与旨在减弱沸石支撑材料酸度的方法相比，可能不会达到同样的有效性水平，以促进所需的化学转换。

Answer: 
The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporosity with a large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These characteristics are crucial for controlling the dispersion of metals and preserving redox species, which in turn influence the catalytic performance in CO2ODHP. To selectively activate the CH bond over the CC bond, the modification of acid sites, particularly the strong acid sites, is essential. Dealumination, either through acid treatment or steaming treatments at specific temperatures, is widely used to eliminate surface acidity, thereby controlling the surface acidity. Weakening the acidity can be achieved by adjusting the aluminum amount or incorporating other elements into the zeolite framework to replace the original strong Brnsted acid sites. Different types of zeolites, such as Beta zeolite, HZSM-5, phosphorus-modified HZSM-5, HZSM-48, and boron-containing MFI, have been utilized as supports in CO2-ODHP catalysts. In the context of acidity modification techniques, dealumination and weakening methods play a significant role in optimizing catalytic performance. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve balancing the trade-offs between the number of acid sites and their strength, aiming for an optimal level that maximizes activity and stability. This balance ensures that the catalysts perform efficiently in CO2-ODHP reactions.
