3.3. Zeolite-Supported Catalysts

"As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2ODHP."

"To selectively activate CH bond rather than CC bond, the modification of acid sites is critical, especially the strong acid sites."

"Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment and steaming treatments at temperatures."

"Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."

"Zeolites that have been introduced as a support include Beta zeolite, HZSM-5, and phosphorus-modified HZSM-5, and boron-containing MFI."

"3.3.1. Dealumination

3.3.1.1. Acid Treatment

Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr-loaded Beta zeolite catalysts by wet impregnation for CO2ODHP."

"3.3.1.2. Steaming Treatment

Xu et al. have carried out dealumination on HZSM-5 zeolite by steaming treatments at temperatures, followed by loading Ga2O3 via IWI."

"Zhu et al. eliminate the acid sites on boron-containing MFI zeolite-supported CrOx catalysts by steaming treatment."

"Ren et al. have prepared a Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts with the Si/Al ratios from 130 to 220."

"Differently, Ren et al. tune the Si/Al molar ratio of ZnO/HZSM-5 by varying the amount of Al source during preparation."

"Increasing Si/Al ratios is an option to weaken the acidity."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique characteristics such as microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These features enable the selective activation of CH bonds over CC bonds, crucial for the desired chemical transformations. Techniques such as dealumination and acidity modification are pivotal in optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination helps in eliminating surface acidity by treatments like acid treatment or steaming at specific temperatures. Weakening acidity through adjustments in aluminum amounts or incorporating other elements into the zeolite framework displaces strong Brnsted acid sites, balancing the trade-off between acidity and catalytic efficiency. The selection and implementation of these strategies vary across different types of zeolites, with factors like pore size, Si/Al ratio, and acidity level playing significant roles in determining their effectiveness for CO2-ODHP processes.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，沸石作为支撑材料的特性主要体现在它们的微孔结构、大表面积、可调酸性以及出色的热稳定性。这些特征能够选择性地激活CH键而非CC键，这对于所需的化学转换至关重要。通过去铝化和酸度调节等技术优化催化性能是关键。去铝化通过酸处理或在特定温度下的蒸馏处理来消除表面酸性。通过调整铝含量或在沸石框架中引入其他元素来平衡强Brnsted酸位点的替换，从而削弱酸度，实现酸度与催化效率之间的平衡。不同类型的沸石在选择和实施这些策略时存在差异，因素如孔径大小、Si/Al比率和酸性水平对CO2-ODHP过程的有效性有重要影响。
