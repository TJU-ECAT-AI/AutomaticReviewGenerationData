1. Zeolites are considered promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their unique properties including microporosity with a large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These characteristics enable them to effectively manage the dispersion of metals and preserve redox Cr species, significantly influencing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP.

2. To modify the acidity of zeolite supports, dealumination techniques, involving acid treatment or steaming treatments at specific temperatures, are widely employed. Additionally, adjusting the aluminum content within the zeolite framework or incorporating other elements can displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites, leading to acidity weakening.

3. The experimental data in Table 6 indicates that increasing the chromium loading on Cr-SiBeta catalysts, which have undergone dealumination, leads to enhanced C3H8 and CO2 conversion alongside a higher C3H6 selectivity compared to Cr-AlBeta catalysts.

4. In the context of acidity modification, steaming treatments play a crucial role in eliminating acid sites or reducing their strength by autoreducing some chromium (Cr) ions from hexavalent (Cr6+) to trivalent (Cr3+) forms. This process affects the interactions between the catalyst components, particularly gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and HZSM-5 zeolite, potentially impacting the catalyst's performance.

5. Excessive acid sites on zeolite supports can lead to detrimental effects on catalytic activity and stability due to the promotion of side reactions that result in coke formation. This clogging of 2D channels within the zeolite structure hinders the efficient operation of the catalyst.

6. Reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 zeolite is identified as a more effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of the CO2-ODHP reaction, specifically in boosting the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6. This approach contrasts with methods aimed at weakening the acidity of the zeolite support, which may not achieve the same level of effectiveness in promoting desired chemical transformations.

1. 由于其独特的微孔结构、大表面积、可调酸性和出色的热稳定性，沸石被认为是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支撑材料。这些特性使得它们能够有效地管理金属的分散和保持Cr物种的还原性，显著影响CO2-ODHP的催化性能。

2. 对于沸石支撑材料的酸度调整，通常采用去铝化技术，包括酸处理或在特定温度下的蒸气处理。此外，通过调整沸石框架中的铝含量或引入其他元素来置换原始强Brnsted酸位点，可以实现酸度的减弱。

3. 表6的数据表明，在相同的反应条件下，Cr-SiBeta催化剂上的铬负载增加导致C3H8和CO2的转化率提高，以及C3H6选择性的增加，这比Cr-AlBeta催化剂高出许多。

4. 在酸度调整的背景下，蒸气处理在消除酸位或降低其强度方面发挥着关键作用，通过将某些铬离子从六价（Cr6+）还原为三价（Cr3+）形式。这一过程可能会影响催化剂组件之间的相互作用，特别是镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和HZSM-5沸石，从而可能影响催化剂的性能。

5. 过多的酸位在沸石支撑材料上可能导致有害效果，因为它们促进了促进焦炭形成并导致活性和稳定性的副作用。这种堵塞2D通道的焦炭会阻碍催化剂的有效运行。

6. 减少HZSM-5沸石上的酸位数量被确认为提高CO2-ODHP反应催化性能的有效策略，特别是在促进C3H8转化为C3H6时。这种方法与旨在减弱沸石支撑材料酸度的方法相比，可能不会达到同样的有效性水平，以促进所需的化学转换。
