3.3. Zeolite-Supported Catalysts
"As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2ODHP."
"Zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability."
"To selectively activate CH bond rather than CC bond, the modification of acid sites is critical, especially the strong acid sites."
"Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."

3.3.1. Dealumination
"Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr-loaded Beta zeolite catalysts by wet impregnation for CO2ODHP."
"The number of acid sites monotonically decreases with the rise of steaming temperature."
"Dealumination not only enables the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-5, but it also weakens the interaction between Ga2O3 and HZSM-5, resulting in an additional decrease in the number of acid sites."

3.3.2. Surface Acidity Weakening
"Increasing Si/Al ratios is an option to weaken the acidity."
"HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher C3H6 selectivity than the HZSM-5 supported counterpart and comparable C3H6 yield, but lower C3H8 conversion."
"At TOS = 10 h, the C3H8 conversion drops from 68.3% to 50.2%."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These factors influence metal dispersion and preserve redox Cr species, impacting catalytic performance. The selective activation of CH bonds over CC bonds through acid site modification, particularly focusing on strong acid sites, is critical. To control surface acidity, dealumination and acidity weakening techniques are employed. These modifications aim to optimize catalytic performance. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve the type of zeolite used as a support, with different acidity levels and structures influencing performance. For instance, increasing the Si/Al ratio can weaken acidity, leading to improved selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions, albeit with a potential trade-off in conversion rates. Techniques like steaming treatments enable the reduction of acid sites, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂，沸石作为支持材料具有以下优势：微孔结构、大表面积、可调酸性和出色的热稳定性。这些特性影响金属分散和保持Cr物种的还原性，从而显著影响催化性能。通过强酸位点的修改，特别是选择性激活CH键而非CC键是关键。为了控制表面酸性，采用脱铝化和酸度减弱技术。这些修改旨在优化催化性能。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石类型作为支持材料，不同的酸度水平和结构会影响性能。例如，增加Si/Al比可以减弱酸性，导致CO2-ODHP反应中更高的选择性，尽管可能伴随着转化率的降低。蒸气处理技术能够减少酸位，增强催化剂稳定性并提高活性。
