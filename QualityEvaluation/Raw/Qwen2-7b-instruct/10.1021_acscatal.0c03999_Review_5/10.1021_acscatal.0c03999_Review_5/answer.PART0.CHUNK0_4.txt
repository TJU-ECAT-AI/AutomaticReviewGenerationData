3.3. Zeolite-Supported Catalysts
"As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2ODHP."
"Zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability."
"To selectively activate CH bond rather than CC bond, the modification of acid sites is critical, especially the strong acid sites."
"Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment and steaming treatments at temperatures."
"Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."
"Zeolites that have been introduced as a support include Beta zeolite, HZSM-5, phosphorus-modified HZSM-5, HZSM-48, and boron-containing MFI."
"3.3.1. Dealumination"
"3.3.1.1. Acid Treatment"
"Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr-loaded Beta zeolite catalysts by wet impregnation for CO2ODHP."
"Catalysts with higher Cr loading on Cr-SiBeta catalysts show increased C3H8 and CO2 conversion and C3H6 selectivity under the same reaction conditions."
"3.3.1.2. Steaming Treatment"
"Xu et al. have carried out dealumination on HZSM-5 zeolite by steaming treatments at temperatures."
"The steaming treatment results in the autoreduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ which is located at the ion-exchange sites in the vicinity of boron sites."
"3.3.2. Surface Acidity Weakening"
"Increasing Si/Al ratios is an option to weaken the acidity."
"Differently, Ren et al. tune the Si/Al molar ratio of ZnO/HZSM-5 by varying the amount of Al source, namely, NaAlO2, during preparation."
"As proposed, the reaction proceeds through dissociative adsorption of C3H8 on Zn oxide sites and a subsequent one-step elimination to produce H2 and C3H6."

Answer: 
The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporosity with a large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These characteristics are crucial for controlling the dispersion of metals and preserving redox species, which in turn influence the catalytic performance in CO2ODHP. To selectively activate the CH bond over the CC bond, the modification of acid sites, particularly the strong acid sites, is essential. Dealumination, either through acid treatment or steaming treatments at specific temperatures, is widely used to eliminate surface acidity, thereby controlling the surface acidity. Weakening the acidity can be achieved by adjusting the aluminum amount or incorporating other elements into the zeolite framework to replace the original strong Brnsted acid sites. Different types of zeolites, such as Beta zeolite, HZSM-5, phosphorus-modified HZSM-5, HZSM-48, and boron-containing MFI, have been utilized as supports in CO2-ODHP catalysts. In the context of acidity modification techniques, dealumination and weakening methods play a significant role in optimizing catalytic performance. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve balancing the trade-offs between the number of acid sites and their strength, aiming for an optimal level that maximizes activity and stability. This balance ensures that the catalysts perform efficiently in CO2-ODHP reactions.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂，沸石作为支撑材料具有以下特性：它们具有微孔结构和较大的表面积、可调酸性和出色的热稳定性。这些特性对于控制金属分散和保持红氧化物物种至关重要，从而影响CO2ODHP的催化性能。为了选择性地激活CH键而不是CC键，需要对酸位进行修改，尤其是强酸位。通过酸处理或在特定温度下的蒸馏处理进行脱铝化是广泛使用的消除表面酸性的方法，这有助于控制表面酸性。通过调整铝含量或在沸石框架中引入其他元素来替换原有的强Brnsted酸位可以实现酸性的减弱。不同的沸石类型，如β沸石、HZSM-5、磷改性的HZSM-5、HZSM-48和硼含有的MFI，已被用作CO2-ODHP催化剂的支持材料。在酸性修改技术的背景下，脱铝化和酸性减弱方法在优化催化性能方面起着重要作用。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括平衡酸位数量与强度之间的折衷，旨在达到最大化活性和稳定性的最优水平。这种平衡确保催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中高效运行。
