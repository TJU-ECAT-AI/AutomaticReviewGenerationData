          [1] "HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalyst was also highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2, when the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support was increased."
          [2] "However, the stability of the catalytic reaction is still an unsolved problem,which is fatal for industrial application."
          [3] "Zinc modified HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios (generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes."
          [4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is observed over ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst. Results of the influence of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation reaction suggest that there are two roles of CO2: a positive role by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role by blocking the dissociative adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface."
          [5] "The enhancing effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction can be attributed to the reverse water-gas shift reaction,which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O."
          [6] "This improvement can be attributed to the suppression of coke formation from two aspects: elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction and acceleration of desorption of the dehydrogenation product (propene) from the catalyst surface, which was also reported for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 over supported Ga2O3 catalysts."
          [7] "The initial activity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while the stability and the propene selectivity improve."

          Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding how these materials enhance catalytic performance. Zeolites, such as HZSM-5, are particularly advantageous because they offer a high surface area and well-defined pore structures, which facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products. The acidity modification techniques mentioned in the document include dealumination and weakening methods, which aim to adjust the acid strength of the zeolite surface. Dealumination reduces the number of acid sites by removing aluminum ions, while weakening methods might involve altering the framework structure to decrease acid strength. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by balancing the number and strength of acid sites, which affects the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process and the selectivity towards propene.

          分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的沸石的特性，涉及到理解这些材料如何提升催化性能。如HZSM-5等沸石因其高比表面积和定义明确的孔结构而特别有优势，这有利于反应物和产物的扩散。文档中提到的酸性修改技术包括去铝化和弱化方法，旨在调整沸石表面的酸强度。去铝化通过去除铝离子来减少酸位点的数量，而弱化方法可能涉及改变框架结构以降低酸强度。这些修改有助于优化催化性能，通过平衡酸位点的数量和强度，影响脱氢过程的效率和丙烯选择性。

          [1] "Carbon dioxide is a mild oxidant utilized in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."
          [2] "Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote the dehydrogenation reaction by the reversed water-gas shift reaction over supported Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 catalysts."
          [3] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which results in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, cracking and aromatization."
          [4] "The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts was measured in situ by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the catalysts."
          [5] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst diminishes with raising the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support."
          [6] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is observed over ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst."
          [7] "Results of the influence of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation reaction suggest that there are two roles of CO2: a positive role by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role by blocking the dissociative adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface."
          [8] "The catalytic stability is also improved by the addition of CO2 to the feed gas due to the suppression of coke formation."

          1. Zeolites, particularly high silica HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions and enhance catalytic stability. The mild oxidant nature of CO2 allows it to participate in reactions like the reversed water-gas shift, which can accelerate the formation of dehydrogenation products. The decrease in acidity on the zeolite surface, often achieved through dealumination and weakening methods, leads to a reduction in side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization, thereby improving propene yield and stability.
