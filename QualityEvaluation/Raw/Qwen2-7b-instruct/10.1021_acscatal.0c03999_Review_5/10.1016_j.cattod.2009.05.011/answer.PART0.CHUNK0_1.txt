[1] "Carbon dioxide is a mild oxidant utilized in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."
[2] "Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote the dehydrogenation reaction by the reversed water-gas shift reaction over supported Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 catalysts."
[3] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which results in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, cracking and aromatization."
[4] "The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts was measured in situ by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the catalysts."
[5] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst diminishes with raising the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support."
[6] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is observed over ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst."
[7] "Results of the influence of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation reaction suggest that there are two roles of CO2: a positive role by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role by blocking the dissociative adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface."
[8] "The catalytic stability is also improved by the addition of CO2 to the feed gas due to the suppression of coke formation."

1. Zeolites, particularly high silica HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions and enhance catalytic stability. The mild oxidant nature of CO2 allows it to participate in reactions like the reversed water-gas shift, which can accelerate the formation of dehydrogenation products. The decrease in acidity on the zeolite surface, often achieved through dealumination and weakening methods, leads to a reduction in side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization, thereby improving propene yield and stability.

2. The effectiveness of these strategies depends on the type of zeolite used. High silica HZSM-5 supports, for instance, can be optimized by adjusting the Si/Al ratio. Higher Si/Al ratios result in less acidic sites, which suppresses side reactions and enhances the stability of the catalyst. This is critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance in dehydrogenation processes involving CO2.

3. CO2 plays dual roles in the dehydrogenation reaction over zeolite-supported catalysts. On one hand, it promotes the reaction by facilitating the reverse water-gas shift, which transforms H2 into CO and H2O. This accelerates the formation of dehydrogenation products. On the other hand, CO2 negatively impacts the reaction by competing with propane for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, potentially reducing the yield of propene.

4. The addition of CO2 to the feed gas stream improves catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation. This is a significant consideration in maintaining long-term catalytic activity and efficiency, as coke buildup can lead to deactivation of the catalyst over time.

5. In selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites, key considerations include the initial acidity of the zeolite, the desired level of acidity for optimal catalytic performance, and the balance between enhancing dehydrogenation activity and minimizing side reactions. The specific techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, should be tailored to the characteristics of the zeolite to achieve the most effective modification.

1. 高硅含量的HZSM-5等沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支撑材料，它们能够促进脱氢反应并提高催化稳定性。二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂，在重整和甲烷的氧化耦合等反应中起作用，并通过逆水煤气变换反应促进催化剂表面的脱氢反应。通过降低沸石表面的酸性，通常采用去铝化和削弱方法，可以减少诸如裂解、聚合、裂化和芳香化等副反应，从而提高丙烯产率和稳定性。

2. 这些策略的有效性取决于所使用的沸石类型。例如，高硅HZSM-5支持物可以通过调整Si/Al比来优化。更高的Si/Al比导致较少的酸性位点，这抑制了副反应并提高了催化剂的稳定性。这对于实现包含CO2的脱氢过程中的最佳催化性能至关重要。

3. 二氧化碳在沸石支持的催化剂上的作用具有双重性。一方面，它通过促进逆水煤气变换反应，加速H2转化为CO和H2O的过程，从而加速脱氢产物的形成。另一方面，二氧化碳通过与催化剂表面的丙烷竞争吸附位置，可能减少丙烯产率。

4. 向气体进料流中添加二氧化碳可以改善催化剂稳定性，因为它抑制了焦炭的形成。这是维持催化剂长期活性和效率的重要考虑因素，因为焦炭积累可能导致催化剂失活。

5. 在为不同类型的沸石选择和实施这些策略时，关键考虑因素包括沸石的初始酸性、期望的最佳催化性能水平以及增强脱氢活性与减少副反应之间的平衡。应根据沸石的特性定制特定技术，以实现最有效的修改。
