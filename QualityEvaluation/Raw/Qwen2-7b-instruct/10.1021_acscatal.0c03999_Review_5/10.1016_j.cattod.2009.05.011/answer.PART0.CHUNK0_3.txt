[1] "HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalyst was also highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2, when the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support was increased."
[2] "However, there is little report focused on this so far."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is observed, which can be attributed to the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
[4] "Results of the influence of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation reaction suggest that there are two roles of CO2: a positive role by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role by blocking the dissociative adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface."
[5] "The catalytic stability is also improved by the addition of CO2 to the feed gas due to the suppression of coke formation."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding how zeolites interact with CO2 and how they influence the overall catalytic performance. The use of high silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports demonstrates their effectiveness in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in the presence of CO2. The incorporation of zinc oxide (ZnO) on these zeolites leads to a bifunctional mechanism, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity while suppressing side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization.

The acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, are crucial in optimizing catalytic performance. These modifications can lead to a decrease in the number of acid sites on the catalyst surface. The results indicate that the enhancement of catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support originates from the decrease in acidity, which leads to the suppression of side reactions. This is supported by the findings that the ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst, with a Si/Al ratio of 160, exhibits the best performance, with a propane conversion of 41.5% and a propene yield of 25.8%.

The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is observed, attributed to the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This not only accelerates the formation of dehydrogenation products but also contributes to the improved catalytic stability. The addition of CO2 to the feed gas further suppresses coke formation, thereby enhancing the overall catalytic performance.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve the balance between maintaining sufficient acidity for the desired reaction and minimizing the risk of coke formation, which can lead to deactivation. The choice of zeolite type, its Si/Al ratio, and the method of incorporating ZnO are critical factors that influence the catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP processes.

分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂载体的沸石材料的特性，涉及理解沸石与CO2的相互作用以及它们如何影响整体催化性能。使用高硅含量的HZSM-5沸石作为支持材料表明其在CO2存在下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的有效性。在这些沸石上引入锌氧化物（ZnO）导致双功能机制的形成，增强了脱氢活性，同时抑制了裂解、多聚化和芳构化等副反应。

酸性修饰技术，如去铝化和弱化方法，在优化催化性能方面至关重要。这些修改可以导致催化剂表面酸位数的减少。结果表明，随着HZSM-5支持物的Si/Al比例增加，催化剂稳定性增强的原因是酸性的降低，这导致了副反应的抑制。这得到了证实，即具有Si/Al比为160的ZnO/HZSM-5(160)催化剂表现出最佳性能，丙烷转化率为41.5%，丙烯产率为25.8%。

观察到CO2对脱氢反应的促进效果，归因于逆水煤气变换反应。这不仅加速了脱氢产物的生成，而且有助于提高催化剂稳定性。向反应气体中添加CO2进一步抑制了焦炭形成，从而提高了整体催化性能。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括维持所需反应所需的适当酸度与避免焦炭形成的风险之间的平衡。选择沸石类型、其Si/Al比例以及ZnO的引入方式是影响CO2-ODHP过程中催化性能的关键因素。
