[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "This is followed by a reaction of the two surface species by HO2 abstracting the hydrogen from the propyl to form H2O2, a thermodynamically downhill step which can occur with little to no energy barrier."
[4] "In the absence of an oxidant such as O2, the C3H7 intermediate is inert to surface-mediated CH activation and further oxidation."

The document does not discuss properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts or critically evaluates various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods. It focuses on the radical chemistry and reaction mechanisms of propane oxidative dehydrogenation over hexagonal boron nitride catalysts.

文档没有讨论使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的特性，或评估各种酸性改性技术，如去铝化和弱化方法。它专注于六方氮化硼催化剂上的丙烷氧化脱氢反应的自由基化学和反应机制。
