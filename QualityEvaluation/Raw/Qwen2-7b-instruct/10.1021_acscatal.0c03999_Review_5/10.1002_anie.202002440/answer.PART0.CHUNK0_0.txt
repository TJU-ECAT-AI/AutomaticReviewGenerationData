[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst at high temperatures at high propane conversion (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."
[4] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst."

The document does not provide information about properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts or critically evaluates the various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods. It focuses on the reaction mechanisms of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts. The document discusses how propene is primarily formed through surface reactions, and C1 and C2 products can result from both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. It also mentions the detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction over h-BN and supported boron oxide catalysts, and the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to propose detailed reaction pathways for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts. However, it does not address questions related to zeolites as support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts or the evaluation of acidity modification techniques.

文档没有提供有关使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的特性的信息，也没有批判性地评估各种酸度修改技术，如去铝化和削弱方法。它专注于六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的反应机制。文档讨论了丙烯主要通过表面反应形成，并且C1和C2产物可以从表面介导和气体相途径形成。它还提到在h-BN和硼氧化物支持催化剂上的ODHP反应中检测到了气体相甲基自由基，并使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算提出了硼基催化剂上各种产品从ODHP的详细反应途径。然而，它没有回答与沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的问题或对酸度修改技术的评估。
