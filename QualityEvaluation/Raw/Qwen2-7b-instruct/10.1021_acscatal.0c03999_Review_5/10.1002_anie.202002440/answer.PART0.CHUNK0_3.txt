[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step."
[3] "Interestingly, a recent work implied a possible influence of gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalyst in ODHP reaction,6 in which no expected relationship was found between the catalytic activity and contact time."
[4] "Wang etal.7 have proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface from the CC bond cleavage, leading to various secondary reaction pathways involving methyl radicals during ODHP."
[5] "Furthermore, the complete reaction pathways and mechanisms of ODHP reaction over the h-BN catalysts are proposed with the aid of combined kinetic study, SVUV-PIMS measurement, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations."

The properties that make hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) promising for CO2-ODHP catalysts include its high efficiency in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins with minimal COx formation. Unlike traditional redox metal oxide catalysts, h-BN exhibits low selectivity for COx and high selectivity for ethylene. Recent studies suggest that the gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalysts plays a role in the ODHP reaction, potentially influencing the catalytic activity independent of contact time. Wang et al. proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface through cleavage of the CC bond, leading to secondary reaction pathways involving these radicals. These findings were supported by kinetic studies, SVUV-PIMS measurements, and DFT calculations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanisms over h-BN catalysts.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，六方氮化硼（h-BN）具有以下有利特性：其在烷烃氧化脱氢为相应的烯烃时表现出极高的效率，同时COx形成量极低。与传统的红氧化合物氧化物催化剂不同，h-BN在选择性上表现出较低的COx生成和较高的乙烯选择性。最近的研究表明，h-BN催化剂的气相自由基化学在ODHP反应中起作用，可能影响催化活性而不依赖于接触时间。王等人提出，通过切断CC键在h-BN表面产生甲基自由基，导致涉及这些自由基的二级反应路径。这些发现得到了动力学研究、SVUV-PIMS测量和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的支持，为理解h-BN催化剂上的ODHP反应机制提供了全面的见解。
