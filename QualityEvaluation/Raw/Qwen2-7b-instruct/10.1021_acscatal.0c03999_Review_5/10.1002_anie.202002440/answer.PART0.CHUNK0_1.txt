[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."
[3] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst at high temperatures at high propane conversion (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."

The properties that make hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) promising for CO2-ODHP catalysts include its outstanding and selective catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins with minimal formation of carbon oxides. It exhibits lower selectivity towards carbon oxides compared to vanadium-based catalysts, making it suitable for applications requiring reduced COx production. However, the presence of nitric oxide (NO) under certain conditions might impact the reaction pathway and requires further investigation. The h-BN catalyst's ability to selectively produce ethylene and its low COx formation are key advantages in developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

对于二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP），六方氮化硼（h-BN）表现出一些有利的特性。它在催化烷烃转化为相应的烯烃时，表现出出色的活性和选择性，并且碳氧化物的生成量极低。与基于钒的催化剂相比，h-BN对碳氧化物的选择性较低，而对乙烯的选择性较高。这使得它在需要减少COx排放的应用中具有潜在的优势。然而，在某些条件下检测到的硝酸（NO）可能会影响反应途径，需要进一步的研究。h-BN催化剂通过选择性生产乙烷并减少COx生成，为开发高选择性的烷基氧化脱氢催化剂提供了可能性。
