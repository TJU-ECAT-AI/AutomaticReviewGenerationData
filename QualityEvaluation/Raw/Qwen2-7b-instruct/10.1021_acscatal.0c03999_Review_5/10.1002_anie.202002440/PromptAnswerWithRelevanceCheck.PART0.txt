[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst at high temperatures at high propane conversion (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."
[4] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst."

The document does not provide information about properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts or critically evaluates the various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods. It focuses on the reaction mechanisms of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts. The document discusses how propene is primarily formed through surface reactions, and C1 and C2 products can result from both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. It also mentions the detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction over h-BN and supported boron oxide catalysts, and the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to propose detailed reaction pathways for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts. However, it does not address questions related to zeolites as support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts or the evaluation of acidity modification techniques.

文档没有提供有关使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的特性的信息，也没有批判性地评估各种酸度修改技术，如去铝化和削弱方法。它专注于六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的反应机制。文档讨论了丙烯主要通过表面反应形成，并且C1和C2产物可以从表面介导和气体相途径形成。它还提到在h-BN和硼氧化物支持催化剂上的ODHP反应中检测到了气体相甲基自由基，并使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算提出了硼基催化剂上各种产品从ODHP的详细反应途径。然而，它没有回答与沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的问题或对酸度修改技术的评估。

[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."
[3] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst at high temperatures at high propane conversion (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."

The properties that make hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) promising for CO2-ODHP catalysts include its outstanding and selective catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins with minimal formation of carbon oxides. It exhibits lower selectivity towards carbon oxides compared to vanadium-based catalysts, making it suitable for applications requiring reduced COx production. However, the presence of nitric oxide (NO) under certain conditions might impact the reaction pathway and requires further investigation. The h-BN catalyst's ability to selectively produce ethylene and its low COx formation are key advantages in developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

对于二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP），六方氮化硼（h-BN）表现出一些有利的特性。它在催化烷烃转化为相应的烯烃时，表现出出色的活性和选择性，并且碳氧化物的生成量极低。与基于钒的催化剂相比，h-BN对碳氧化物的选择性较低，而对乙烯的选择性较高。这使得它在需要减少COx排放的应用中具有潜在的优势。然而，在某些条件下检测到的硝酸（NO）可能会影响反应途径，需要进一步的研究。h-BN催化剂通过选择性生产乙烷并减少COx生成，为开发高选择性的烷基氧化脱氢催化剂提供了可能性。

[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step."
[3] "Interestingly, a recent work implied a possible influence of gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalyst in ODHP reaction,6 in which no expected relationship was found between the catalytic activity and contact time."
[4] "Wang etal.7 have proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface from the CC bond cleavage, leading to various secondary reaction pathways involving methyl radicals during ODHP."
[5] "Furthermore, the complete reaction pathways and mechanisms of ODHP reaction over the h-BN catalysts are proposed with the aid of combined kinetic study, SVUV-PIMS measurement, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations."

The properties that make hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) promising for CO2-ODHP catalysts include its high efficiency in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins with minimal COx formation. Unlike traditional redox metal oxide catalysts, h-BN exhibits low selectivity for COx and high selectivity for ethylene. Recent studies suggest that the gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalysts plays a role in the ODHP reaction, potentially influencing the catalytic activity independent of contact time. Wang et al. proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface through cleavage of the CC bond, leading to secondary reaction pathways involving these radicals. These findings were supported by kinetic studies, SVUV-PIMS measurements, and DFT calculations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanisms over h-BN catalysts.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，六方氮化硼（h-BN）具有以下有利特性：其在烷烃氧化脱氢为相应的烯烃时表现出极高的效率，同时COx形成量极低。与传统的红氧化合物氧化物催化剂不同，h-BN在选择性上表现出较低的COx生成和较高的乙烯选择性。最近的研究表明，h-BN催化剂的气相自由基化学在ODHP反应中起作用，可能影响催化活性而不依赖于接触时间。王等人提出，通过切断CC键在h-BN表面产生甲基自由基，导致涉及这些自由基的二级反应路径。这些发现得到了动力学研究、SVUV-PIMS测量和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的支持，为理解h-BN催化剂上的ODHP反应机制提供了全面的见解。
