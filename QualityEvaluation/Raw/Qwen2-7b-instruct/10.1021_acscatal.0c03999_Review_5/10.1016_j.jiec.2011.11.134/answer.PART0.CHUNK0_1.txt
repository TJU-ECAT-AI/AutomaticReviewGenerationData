2.1. "HZSM-48 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared following the procedures in the literature [20]."
2.2. "The as-synthesized ZSM-48 zeolites were turned into the H-form by ion exchanging with 1 M NH4NO3 solution at 80 8C for 2 h, filtered and washed. The above ion exchange process was repeated twice more."
2.3. "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."
2.4. "However, the stability on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with Ga2O3/ HZSM-5, which may be caused by its abundant weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their ability to provide a suitable acidic environment for the dehydrogenation of propane. Zeolites, particularly those with medium pore sizes and weak acidity, such as ZSM-48, are chosen because they can inhibit undesirable side reactions while maintaining a high selectivity for propene production. Techniques for modifying acidity, such as dealumination and weakening, aim to reduce the number of acid sites, especially those with medium to strong strengths, to suppress side reactions and improve stability. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve balancing the acidity level to optimize both the dehydrogenation efficiency and the selectivity towards propene, while also ensuring adequate stability for industrial applications.

用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料，如沸石的特性包括它们能够提供合适的酸性环境来促进丙烷脱氢。特别是具有中等孔径和弱酸性的沸石，如ZSM-48，因其能抑制不希望的副反应并保持高丙烯选择性而成为理想的选择。修改酸度的技术，如去铝化和减弱法，旨在减少酸位的数量，尤其是中等到强酸位，以抑制副反应并提高稳定性。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括平衡酸度水平以优化脱氢效率和丙烯选择性，同时确保工业应用所需的足够稳定性。
