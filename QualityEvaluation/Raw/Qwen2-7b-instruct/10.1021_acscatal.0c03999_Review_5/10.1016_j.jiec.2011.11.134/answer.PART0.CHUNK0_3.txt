[1] "HZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5."
[2] "Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."
[3] "The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5, especially at low propane conversion, due to its weaker acidity."
[4] "However, the stability on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with Ga2O3/ HZSM-5, which may be caused by its abundant weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we find that HZSM-48 zeolites are particularly interesting due to their high silicon content and relatively weaker acid strength compared to ZSM-5. The linear 10-membered ring channels within HZSM-48 provide a unique pore geometry. When Ga2O3 is supported on HZSM-48, the catalyst demonstrates the highest propene yield of 22% at a Si/Al ratio of 130. This is attributed to the weak acid strength of HZSM-48, which leads to higher propene selectivity, especially at low propane conversion levels. However, the stability of the catalysts is compromised, as the abundance of weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure in HZSM-48 accelerates catalyst deactivation.

分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的沸石的独特性质，我们发现HZSM-48沸石具有高硅含量和相对较弱的酸强度，与ZSM-5相比更为突出。HZSM-48中的线性十元环通道提供了独特的孔隙结构。当在HZSM-48上负载Ga2O3时，催化剂显示出在Si/Al比为130时最高的丙烯产率为22%。这归因于HZSM-48的弱酸强度，导致在低丙烷转化率下更高的丙烯选择性。然而，催化剂稳定性受到影响，因为HZSM-48中丰富的弱酸位点和一维孔结构加速了催化剂的失活。
