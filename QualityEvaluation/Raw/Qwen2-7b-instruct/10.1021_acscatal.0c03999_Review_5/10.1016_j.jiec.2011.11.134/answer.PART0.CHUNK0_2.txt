[1] "HZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5."
[2] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which resulted in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and cracking."
[3] "In order to reduce the possibility of aromatization, the ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity."
[4] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."
[5] "However, the stability on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with Ga2O3/ HZSM-5, which may be caused by its abundant weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, it's crucial to consider factors such as pore size, acidity, and pore geometry. Zeolites like HZSM-48 are favored for their high Si content and relatively weaker acid strength compared to ZSM-5. This lower acid strength contributes to a decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength, thereby reducing side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, and cracking, which enhances the catalytic performance.

Different acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, play a significant role in optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the amount of Al in the zeolite framework, leading to a decrease in the number of acidic sites. Weakening methods involve reducing the interaction between gallium oxides and the support, which might also decrease acidity. These modifications are essential in tailoring the acidity of the support to match the requirements of the specific reaction, such as the dehydrogenation of propane.

When selecting a zeolite support, key considerations include the type of zeolite, its pore size, and its acidity level. For instance, HZSM-48 is chosen for its medium pore size and weak acidity, which are beneficial for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. On the other hand, HZSM-5 might be more suitable for applications requiring higher acidity.

Implementing these strategies requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability. For example, while HZSM-48 offers better selectivity to propene, its stability is compromised due to its weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure. Therefore, the choice of zeolite support depends on the specific reaction conditions and desired outcome, balancing between catalytic efficiency and durability.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的有利性质，需要考虑孔径大小、酸度和孔结构等因素。例如，HZSM-48由于其较高的Si含量和相对弱于ZSM-5的酸强度而受到青睐。较低的酸强度导致中等至强酸性位点数量减少，从而抑制了如聚合、环化和裂解等副反应，这有助于提高催化性能。

不同的酸度修改技术，如脱铝和减弱方法，在优化催化性能方面起着关键作用。脱铝减少了沸石框架中的Al含量，导致酸性位点数量减少。减弱方法涉及减少镓氧化物与支撑物之间的相互作用，这也可能降低酸度。这些修改对于根据特定反应（如丙烷脱氢）的需求调整支撑物的酸度至关重要。

在选择沸石支撑物时，需要考虑的关键因素包括沸石类型、孔径大小和酸度水平。例如，HZSM-48因其中等孔径和弱酸度而被选作支撑材料，这对于丙烷在CO2存在的条件下脱氢是合适的。另一方面，HZSM-5可能更适合要求更高酸度的应用。

实施这些策略需要仔细权衡活性、选择性和稳定性的折衷。例如，尽管HZSM-48提供了更好的丙烯选择性，但由于其弱酸性位点和一维孔结构，其稳定性较差。因此，选择沸石支撑物取决于特定反应条件和预期结果，平衡催化效率和耐用性。
