Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts reveals their high surface area, pore structure, and ion-exchange capacity. Acidity modification techniques, particularly dealumination and weakening methods, play a critical role in optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination enhances the acidity of zeolites by removing aluminum atoms, thereby increasing the number of Lewis acid sites. Weakening methods reduce the strength of acid sites, improving the selectivity of the CO2-ODHP reactions. In selecting and implementing these strategies, several key considerations must be taken into account, including the type of zeolite, the desired reaction conditions, and the balance between acidity and stability.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料有前景的特性，包括它们的高比表面积、孔结构和离子交换能力。酸度调整技术，尤其是去铝化和减弱方法，对于优化催化性能至关重要。去铝化通过移除铝原子增强了沸石的酸性，从而增加了路易斯酸位点的数量。减弱方法降低了酸位的强度，提高了CO2-ODHP反应的选择性。在选择和实施这些策略时，需要考虑的关键因素包括沸石的类型、期望的反应条件以及酸性和稳定性之间的平衡。
