Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we find that their unique characteristics, including high surface area, pore structure, and tunable acidity, contribute significantly to their effectiveness. Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, are essential for optimizing catalytic performance. These modifications enhance the selectivity and activity of the catalysts by adjusting the acidity levels according to the specific needs of the reactions. When selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites, it is crucial to consider factors such as understanding the specific acid sites, the stability of the zeolite structure, and the desired reaction conditions to ensure optimal performance.
