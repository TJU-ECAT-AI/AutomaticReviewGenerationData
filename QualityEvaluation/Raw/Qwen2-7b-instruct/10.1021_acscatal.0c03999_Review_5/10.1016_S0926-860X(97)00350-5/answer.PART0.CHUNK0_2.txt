The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their ability to stabilize the catalyst structure under reaction conditions, provide a suitable surface area for the active sites, and facilitate the redox cycle involving reduction of magnetite with isobutane and oxidation of iron with carbon dioxide. Zeolites can be optimized through acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods. Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite framework, which can lead to a more acidic environment that enhances the redox activity of iron species. Weakening methods involve altering the strength of the zeolite framework to control the acidity and stability of the catalyst. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the desired reaction conditions, and the balance between acidity and stability to achieve optimal catalytic performance.

The XRD analyses of the catalyst revealed that iron on the surface of the carbon support was converted into magnetite under pretreatment with carbon dioxide at 973 K. Magnetite was considered an active phase of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation of isobutane in carbon dioxide, as it played a role in the redox cycle involving the reduction of magnetite with isobutane and the oxidation of iron with carbon dioxide. The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in carbon dioxide was lower than that in an argon atmosphere, suggesting that carbon dioxide helps to prevent carbon deposition on the catalyst.

用于CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的沸石的特性包括它们在反应条件下稳定催化剂结构的能力，提供适合活性位点的表面积，以及促进磁铁矿与异丁烷的还原作用和二氧化碳与铁的氧化作用。可以通过去铝化和弱化等酸性改性方法优化沸石。去铝化减少了沸石骨架中的铝含量，这可能导致更酸性的环境，从而增强铁物种的红ox活性。弱化方法涉及改变沸石骨架的强度以控制酸性和稳定性，以实现最佳催化性能。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括使用的沸石类型、期望的反应条件以及酸性和稳定性之间的平衡。

X射线衍射分析显示，在973 K下用二氧化碳预处理后，碳支持上的铁转化为磁铁矿。磁铁矿被认为是碳氧化合物在二氧化碳气氛下的催化剂中起着活性作用的阶段，在磁铁矿与异丁烷的还原作用和铁与二氧化碳的氧化作用之间起着红ox循环的作用。在二氧化碳气氛下的催化剂上沉积的碳量低于氩气氛，表明二氧化碳有助于防止催化剂上的碳沉积。
