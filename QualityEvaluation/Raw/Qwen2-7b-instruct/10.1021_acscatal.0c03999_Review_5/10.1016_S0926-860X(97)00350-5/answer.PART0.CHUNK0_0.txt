The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their ability to stabilize catalysts, provide a suitable environment for the reaction, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process. Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, are used to optimize catalytic performance. These techniques involve altering the structure or composition of zeolites to create more acidic sites, which can accelerate the reaction and improve the yield of the desired products. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used as a support, the desired reaction conditions, and the specific goals of the catalytic process. The choice of technique depends on the characteristics of the zeolite and the requirements of the reaction, aiming to balance acidity and stability to achieve optimal performance.
