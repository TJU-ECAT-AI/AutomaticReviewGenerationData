This literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene using iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts. It discusses the optimization of catalyst loading levels, reaction conditions, and the role of carbon dioxide in the process. The redox cycle involving magnetite and metallic iron is highlighted as a key mechanism. The literature also compares the effects of using different atmospheres (argon vs. carbon dioxide) on the conversion, yield, and selectivity of isobutene. Furthermore, it examines the use of lithium co-loading to minimize catalyst deactivation during prolonged runs. The presence of carbon dioxide is shown to promote dehydrogenation by facilitating the redox cycle and reducing hydrogen partial pressure, thus optimizing the conditions for the reaction.
