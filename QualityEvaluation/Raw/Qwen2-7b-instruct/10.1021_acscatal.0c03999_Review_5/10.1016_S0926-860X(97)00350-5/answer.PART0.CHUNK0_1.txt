[1] "Effects of reaction conditions on the conversion of isobutane and the selectivity to isobutene will be discussed."
[2] "The reaction was carried out in a conventional ow type reactor made of a quartz tube (8.0300 mm) operated at atmospheric pressure."
[3] "The relative amounts of isobutane and carbon dioxide were adjusted while maintaining a constant total feed ow rate of 45 ml/min at room temperature."
[4] "The surface area of the catalyst decreased from 935650 m2/g after the reaction for 5 h at 923 K."
[5] "Effects of reaction temperatures on the dehydrogenation of isobutane with Fe(0.3)/AC catalyst were examined."
[6] "In order to understand a role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of isobutane, isobutane conversion,isobutene yield and selectivity in carbon dioxide are compared with those in an argon atmosphere using Fe(0.3)/AC catalyst."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts are their ability to modify acidity through various techniques such as dealumination and weakening. These modifications can optimize catalytic performance by enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the reactions. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve the type of zeolite used as a support, the specific chemical and physical properties of the zeolite, and the desired reaction conditions. For instance, dealumination can alter the acidity of the zeolite, potentially improving its performance for certain reactions. However, the selection and implementation of these strategies should be carefully considered to ensure compatibility with the overall catalytic system and to achieve optimal results.
