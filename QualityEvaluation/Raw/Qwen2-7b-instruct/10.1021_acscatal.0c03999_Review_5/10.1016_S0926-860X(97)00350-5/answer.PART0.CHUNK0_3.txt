[1] "In the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, the presence of carbon dioxide in the feedstream promotes the reaction as compared to feeding bulk isobutane or isobutane and argon mixture."
[2] "The addition of lithium to the iron-loaded activated carbon catalyst did not significantly affect the deactivation of the catalyst during the prolonged run."
[3] "The X-ray diffraction pattern of the iron-loaded activated carbon catalyst after treatment with carbon dioxide at 973 K showed clear diffraction peaks, indicating the formation of magnetite."
[4] "Under carbon dioxide atmosphere, the reaction of isobutane forms carbon monoxide and water, which suggests that isobutene is produced through both simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts are their ability to stabilize the catalyst structure and enhance the activity of the catalyst. Zeolites can be modified through various techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination helps in reducing the number of aluminum atoms in the zeolite framework, which can lead to an increase in the acidity of the material and thus improve the catalytic activity. Weakening methods involve breaking the bonds within the zeolite structure, which can also increase its acidity and activity. The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used as a support, considering factors such as its pore size, structure, and stability under reaction conditions.

用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的沸石支持材料的有利特性是它们能够稳定催化剂结构并增强催化剂活性。可以通过多种方法对沸石进行修改，以优化催化性能，如脱铝和减弱方法。脱铝有助于减少沸石框架中的铝原子数量，这可能导致材料酸性增加，从而提高催化活性。减弱方法涉及在沸石结构中断裂键，这也可能增加其酸性和活性。选择和实施这些策略取决于所使用的特定类型的沸石作为支撑物，需要考虑因素如其孔径大小、结构和反应条件下的稳定性。
