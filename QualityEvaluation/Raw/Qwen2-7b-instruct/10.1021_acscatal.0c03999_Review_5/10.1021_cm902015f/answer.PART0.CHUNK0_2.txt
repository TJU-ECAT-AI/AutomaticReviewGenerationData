[1] "The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area, well-defined pore structure, and tunable acidity."
[2] "Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, have been employed to optimize catalytic performance."
[3] "Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, which can weaken the acidity and potentially improve selectivity."
[4] "Weakening methods typically involve modifying the zeolite's surface chemistry to reduce acid strength."
[5] "Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used as a support, its inherent properties, and the desired catalytic activity."
