          [1] "The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area, ordered pore structure, and tunable acidity."
          [2] "Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, have been developed to optimize catalytic performance."
          [3] "Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, which can increase the proportion of Lewis acidic sites and enhance the activity of the catalyst."
          [4] "Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve altering the bond strength within the zeolite structure, which can also lead to an increase in acidity."
          [5] "The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites include the type of zeolite, the specific catalyst being used, and the desired reaction conditions."

          Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, ordered pore structure, and tunable acidity. Various techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, are used to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination increases the proportion of Lewis acidic sites, enhancing the catalyst's activity, while weakening methods adjust bond strength, leading to increased acidity. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the type of zeolite, the catalyst being used, and desired reaction conditions.

          Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, well-defined pore structure, and tunable acidity. Various techniques, including dealumination and weakening, are used to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination modifies the zeolite structure by removing aluminum, affecting its acidity and enhancing its selectivity for specific reactions. Weakening methods aim to decrease the strength of acid sites on the zeolite surface, potentially improving catalyst stability under reaction conditions. Key factors in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, specific reaction conditions, and desired product distribution.
