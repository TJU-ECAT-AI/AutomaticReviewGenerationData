[1] "The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area, ordered pore structure, and tunable acidity."
[2] "Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, have been developed to optimize catalytic performance."
[3] "Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, which can increase the proportion of Lewis acidic sites and enhance the activity of the catalyst."
[4] "Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve altering the bond strength within the zeolite structure, which can also lead to an increase in acidity."
[5] "The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites include the type of zeolite, the specific catalyst being used, and the desired reaction conditions."

Answer: Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, ordered pore structure, and tunable acidity. Various techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, are used to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination increases the proportion of Lewis acidic sites, enhancing the catalyst's activity. Weakening methods alter bond strength, also increasing acidity. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the type of zeolite, the catalyst being used, and desired reaction conditions.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答案：沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支持材料，因其高比表面积、有序孔结构和可调酸性而具有潜力。已开发出多种技术，如脱铝化和减弱方法，以优化催化性能。脱铝化增加了Lewis酸性位点的比例，从而提高了催化剂的活性。减弱方法改变了骨架内的键强度，同样也增加了酸性。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括所用的沸石类型、使用的催化剂以及所需的反应条件。
