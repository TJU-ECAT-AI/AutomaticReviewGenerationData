Answer: Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, well-defined pore structure, and tunable acidity. Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening, are employed to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination modifies the zeolite structure by removing aluminum, altering acidity and enhancing selectivity. Weakening methods aim to reduce acid site strength, potentially increasing catalyst stability. Key factors in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, reaction conditions, and desired product distribution.
