          Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, the key factors revolve around their high surface area, well-defined pore structure, and tunable acidity. Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, are utilized to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the aluminum content in the zeolite framework, enhancing the remaining framework's acidity. Weakening methods adjust the zeolite structure to increase the number of acid sites. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by enhancing the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. In choosing and implementing these strategies, key considerations involve the type of zeolite used, the desired level of acidity, and the specific reaction conditions.

          [1] "Several efficient catalyst systems have been developed, and their redox property is crucial for catalytic activity."
          [2] "The contribution of heterogeneous catalysis towards C2H4 formation is 75% to 55% in the temperature range of 680 to 720°C."
          [3] "Adding CO2 to the CH4 feed promotes catalyst stability, but excessive addition (>10%) inhibits the formation of aromatic products."
          [4] "A higher tetragonal phase in ZrO2 leads to improved EB conversion and styrene selectivity."
          [5] "Adding CeO2 to ZrO2 improves catalytic activity, attributed to increased basicity and oxygen vacancies."

          For all these reactions, several efficient catalyst systems have been developed, and their redox property plays a dominant role in catalytic activity. The actual contribution of heterogeneous catalysis towards the formation of C2H4 is between 75% and 55% across the temperature range of 680 to 720°C. Adding a small percentage of CO2 to the CH4 feed aids in promoting catalyst stability, while excessive addition (over 10%) can inhibit the formation of aromatic products. The presence of a higher tetragonal phase in ZrO2 catalysts enhances EB conversion and styrene selectivity. Incorporating CeO2 as a promoter into ZrO2 catalysts significantly improves catalytic activity, attributed to the increased basicity and oxygen vacancies in the material.

          对于所有这些反应，已经开发出了几个高效的催化剂系统，其氧化还原性质在催化活性中起着主导作用。在680至720°C的温度范围内，异质催化对C2H4形成的贡献百分比在75%到55%之间。向CH4流中添加少量的CO2有助于促进催化剂稳定性，而过量添加（超过10%）会抑制芳香族产品的形成。ZrO2催化剂中较高的四面体相含量提高了乙基苯乙烯转化率和苯乙烯选择性。将CeO2作为促进剂加入到ZrO2催化剂中显著提高了催化活性，归因于材料中增加的基本性和氧空位。
