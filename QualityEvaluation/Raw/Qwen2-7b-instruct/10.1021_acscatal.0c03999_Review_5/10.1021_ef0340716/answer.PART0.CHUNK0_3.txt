Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we find that their unique features such as high surface area, ordered pore structures, and tunable acidity play crucial roles. Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, are utilized to optimize the catalytic performance. Dealumination increases the surface acidity by removing aluminum ions, thereby enhancing the activity of catalysts. Weakening methods, which involve the introduction of metal ions or adjusting the pH, can also adjust the acidity of zeolites. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites include striking a balance between acidity and stability, as well as ensuring compatibility with the desired catalyst components.
