Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, they are chosen due to their high surface area, pore structure, and acid sites. Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, are employed to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite framework, enhancing the acidity of the remaining framework. Weakening methods involve altering the zeolite structure to increase the number of acid sites. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by enhancing the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the desired level of acidity, and the specific reaction conditions.

分析为什么沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的优质支持材料，主要是因为它们具有高表面积、孔结构和酸位点。采用的各种酸度修改技术，如去铝化和弱化，旨在优化催化性能。去铝化减少了沸石框架中的铝含量，增强了剩余框架的酸性。弱化方法涉及改变沸石结构以增加酸位点的数量。这些修改有助于通过提高催化剂的选择性和活性来优化催化性能。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石类型、所需的酸度水平以及特定反应条件。
