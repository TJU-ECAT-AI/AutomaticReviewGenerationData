[1] "Zeolites are highly porous materials with a well-defined framework structure. Their unique properties make them promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts."
[2] "Zeolites can be modified to adjust their acidity, which is crucial for catalytic activity. This is typically achieved through dealumination or weakening methods."
[3] "Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite structure, which can increase the number of acid sites available for catalysis."
[4] "Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve altering the strength of the bonds within the zeolite framework to enhance the acidity of the material."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, the key factors revolve around their high porosity and well-defined framework structure. These features facilitate the interaction between reactants and catalysts. Zeolites can be optimized for catalytic performance through various acidity modification techniques. Dealumination increases the number of acid sites by removing aluminum atoms, enhancing catalytic activity. Weakening methods adjust the strength of the zeolite framework bonds to boost acidity. Both strategies aim to optimize the catalytic performance of zeolite supports by enhancing their ability to catalyze CO2-ODHP reactions.
