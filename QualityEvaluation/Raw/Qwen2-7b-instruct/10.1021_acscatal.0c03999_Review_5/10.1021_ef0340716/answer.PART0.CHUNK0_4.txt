[1] "For all these reactions, several efficient catalyst systems have been developed, and their redox property dominates the catalytic activity."
[2] "The actual contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis is 75%55% in the temperature range of 680720 C."
[3] "Adding a few percent of CO2 to the CH4 feed resulted in the promotion of catalyst stability in forming CO, although excessive addition of CO2 (>10%) to the CH4 feed gas largely inhibited the formation of aromatic products such as C6H6, in a manner similar to complete poisoning by the addition of a few percent of O2."
[4] "The higher the tetragonal phase contained in ZrO2, the higher the EB conversion and styrene selectivity that were obtained."
[5] "The addition of a CeO2 promoter to ZrO2 improved the catalytic activity significantly, which was attributed to the increasing basicity, as well as oxygen vacancies."

1. Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their redox properties that dominate the catalytic activity. The acidity of zeolites can be modified through dealumination and weakening methods to optimize catalytic performance. These modifications enhance the activity and selectivity of the catalysts for different types of zeolites.

2. The contribution of heterogeneous catalysis towards C2H4 formation varies between 75% and 55% across the temperature range of 680 to 720°C. This highlights the importance of temperature in determining the efficiency of the catalytic process.

3. The addition of a small percentage of CO2 to the CH4 feed promotes catalyst stability by facilitating CO formation. However, excessive addition of CO2 (>10%) inhibits the formation of aromatic products like C6H6, similar to the effect of adding a small percentage of O2, which acts as a poison.

4. The tetragonal phase content in ZrO2 plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity. Higher tetragonal phase leads to improved EB conversion and styrene selectivity.

5. Incorporating a CeO2 promoter into ZrO2 catalysts enhances the catalytic activity significantly. This improvement is attributed to the increased basicity and oxygen vacancies in the material, contributing to better performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

1. 硅铝酸盐是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支持材料，因为它们的氧化还原性质主导着催化活性。通过去铝化和弱化方法对硅铝酸盐的酸性进行修改，可以优化催化剂性能。这些修改增强了不同种类硅铝酸盐催化剂的活性和选择性。

2. 在680至720°C的温度范围内，异质催化对C2H4形成贡献的百分比在75%到55%之间变化。这强调了温度在确定催化过程效率中的重要性。

3. 向CH4流中添加少量的CO2可以促进催化剂稳定性，通过促进CO的生成。然而，过量添加CO2（>10%）会抑制芳香族产物如C6H6的形成，类似于添加少量O2作为毒剂的作用。

4. ZrO2中四面体相的含量对决定乙基苯乙烯转化率和苯乙烯选择性至关重要。较高的四面体相含量导致更好的乙基苯乙烯转化率和苯乙烯选择性。

5. 将CeO2促进剂加入到ZrO2催化剂中显著提高了催化活性。这种改进归因于增加的碱性和氧空位，从而在CO2-ODHP反应中提高了性能。
