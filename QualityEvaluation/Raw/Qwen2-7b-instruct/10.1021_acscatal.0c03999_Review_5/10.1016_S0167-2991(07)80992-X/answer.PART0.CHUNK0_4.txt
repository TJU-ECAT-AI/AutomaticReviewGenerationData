[Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34]
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene.
Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes.
Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene.
The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream.

The development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable. Zeolites, due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity, are promising support materials for propylene production. Among the tested samples, H-ZSM-5 zeolite showed the best performance in catalytic cracking of C4-olefin to produce propylene. The stability of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is enhanced with smaller crystal size, which contributes to its effectiveness in propylene production.
