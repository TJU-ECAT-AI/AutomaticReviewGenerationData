[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "The acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
[3] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[4] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity level and distribution within the zeolite structure. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve the type of zeolite used, the specific reaction conditions, and the desired product yield. For instance, the study focuses on the catalytic cracking of C4-olefins over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34. Among these, H-ZSM-5 demonstrated superior performance in terms of both resistance to deactivation and propylene yield, especially when considering the size of the zeolite crystals.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，沸石作为支持材料具有良好的潜力，其原因在于它们的热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性。酸性调整技术，如去铝化和弱化，通过调整沸石结构内的酸度水平和分布来优化催化性能。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括使用的沸石类型、特定反应条件以及期望的产品产率。例如，本研究关注了对C4-烯烃进行催化裂解的沸石H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34。在这三种中，H-ZSM-5在抵抗失活和丙烯产率方面表现出最佳性能，尤其是在考虑晶粒大小的情况下。
