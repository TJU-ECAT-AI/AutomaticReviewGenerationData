[Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34]
[Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively.]
[It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite.]
[Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene.]

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, are used to optimize catalytic performance. These modifications contribute to enhancing the activity and selectivity of zeolite catalysts. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve understanding the specific requirements of the reaction conditions, the nature of the reactants, and the desired product distribution. Different types of zeolites require tailored optimization approaches due to their unique structural characteristics and reactivity profiles.
