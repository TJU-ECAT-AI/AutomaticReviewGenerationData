[1] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[2] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[3] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. These features enable zeolites to maintain their structure and functionality under reaction conditions, while selectively catalyzing specific chemical transformations. Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by enhancing the acidic sites on the zeolite surface. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the type of zeolite used as a support, aiming to balance the acidity level with stability and reactivity to achieve optimal catalytic activity.
