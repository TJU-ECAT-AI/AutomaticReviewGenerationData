The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. These characteristics enable zeolites to maintain their structure and activity under reaction conditions, facilitating efficient catalytic performance. The acidity of zeolites is crucial for promoting the desired chemical reactions. Shape selectivity ensures that specific molecules are preferentially transformed, enhancing product purity and efficiency.

Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by fine-tuning the acidity level and distribution within the zeolite. Dealumination reduces the aluminum content, which can alter the acidity pattern and improve selectivity for certain reactions. Weakening methods involve modifying the framework structure of the zeolite to weaken its acidic sites, again aiming to optimize the balance between acidity and stability. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used as a support and the desired reaction conditions. Factors to consider include the initial composition, crystal size, and the desired outcome of the catalytic process.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，沸石作为支撑材料具有出色的热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性，这些特性使得它们在工业过程中广泛应用。这些特性允许沸石在反应条件下保持其结构和活性，从而促进高效的催化性能。沸石的酸性是促进所需化学反应的关键。形状选择性确保特定分子优先被转化，从而提高产品纯度和效率。

对沸石的酸性进行修改的技术，如去铝化和减弱方法，通过调整酸度水平和分布来优化催化性能。去铝化减少了铝含量，这可以改变酸性模式并改善某些反应的选择性。减弱方法涉及修改沸石的框架结构以削弱其酸性位点，再次旨在优化酸性和稳定性的平衡。在选择和实施这些策略时，需要考虑的因素包括所用支撑材料的初始组成、晶体尺寸以及催化过程所需的特定条件。要考虑的关键因素包括初始组成、晶体大小以及期望的催化结果。

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity level and distribution within the zeolite structure. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve the type of zeolite used, the specific reaction conditions, and the desired product yield. For instance, the study focuses on the catalytic cracking of C4-olefins over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34. Among these, H-ZSM-5 demonstrated superior performance in terms of both resistance to deactivation and propylene yield, especially when considering the size of the zeolite crystals.
