Analyze the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, and critically evaluate the various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods. How do these modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance, and what are the key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports?
