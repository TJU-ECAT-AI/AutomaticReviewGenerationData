[1] "The OH/SiO2 and SiO2/Al2O3 ratios in the reaction mixtures are the key factors that affect the crystallinity and purity of ZSM-48."
[2] "Compared with currently used HZSM-5 zeolite, HZSM-48 zeolite exhibits a more excellent selectivity for the aimed olefins, especially for those with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios."
[3] "With the increasing of the aluminum content, both the conversion and the yield of the desired propylene product increase."
[4] "The addition of seed crystal can shorten the crystal time."
[5] "Coking was the main reason for the deactivation of HZSM-48 in C4-olefin cracking reactions."
