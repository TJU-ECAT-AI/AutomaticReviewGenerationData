1. The synthesis of ZSM-48 zeolites can be influenced by the addition of salts, such as NaCl and NaF, which do not favor the synthesis, whereas the addition of seed crystal can shorten the crystal time. 

2. HZSM-48 zeolites with a relatively lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratio exhibit appropriate acidity, making them suitable for the cracking of C4-olefin reactions to produce a high yield of propylene.

3. The study revealed that high temperatures and high liquid hour space velocities (LHSV) are advantageous for producing propylene with high selectivity in the C4-olefin cracking reactions using HZSM-48 catalysts.

4. Coking is identified as the primary cause for the deactivation of HZSM-48 catalysts in C4-olefin cracking reactions.

1. 添加盐，如NaCl和NaF不利于ZSM-48的合成，而添加种子晶体可以缩短晶体时间。

2. 具有相对较低SiO2/Al2O3比率的HZSM-48具有适当的酸性，使其适合用于裂解C4-烯烃反应以产生高产率的丙烯。

3. 研究表明，在使用HZSM-48催化剂进行C4-烯烃裂解反应时，高温和高液相小时空间速度（LHSV）有利于生产具有高选择性的丙烯。

4. 焦化是HZSM-48催化剂在C4-烯烃裂解反应中失效的主要原因。
