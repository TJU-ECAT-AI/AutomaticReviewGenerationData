[1] "Compared with currently used HZSM-5 zeolite, HZSM-48 zeolite exhibits a more excellent selectivity for the aimed olefins, especially for those with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios."
[2] "The results of our previous research [4] showed that although the weak acid sites remained almost unchanged, the catalytic activity decreased greatly with the decreasing of strong acid sites."
[3] "In order to shorten the synthesis time and to raise the crystallinity of zeolite, one of the effective ways is to add seed crystal or salts into the reaction mixtures."
[4] "With the increasing of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, the total acid amount monotonously decreased, while the relative ratio of strong acid sites slightly increased."
[5] "Although the acid sites with stronger strength in HZSM-5 will help the conversion of C4-olefin,they also cause the formation of the products from the hydrogen transfer reaction, e.g., ethane, propane and butane."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their uniform micropore size and controllable surface acidity. Zeolites with medium pore size, larger than the diameter of C4-olefin and smaller than the size of coke precursors, are particularly useful. HZSM-48 zeolite, with its unique framework structure and uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels, shows excellent selectivity for olefins, especially those with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. The acidity of zeolites plays a crucial role in catalytic performance; the study indicates that strong acid sites are pivotal in the C4 cracking process. To optimize catalytic performance, various acidity modification techniques are employed, such as dealumination and weakening methods. These modifications aim to adjust the acidity of zeolites to better suit the specific requirements of the catalytic reactions, such as increasing the yield of propylene. The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the type of zeolite used as a support, considering factors like the balance between acidity and stability, the potential for deactivation mechanisms like coking, and the efficiency of the catalyst in achieving high selectivity and yield for the desired products.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，具有均匀微孔结构和可控表面酸性的沸石是很有前景的支持材料。具有中等孔径（大于C4烯烃直径且小于焦炭前体尺寸）的沸石特别有用。HZSM-48沸石由于其独特的框架结构和无交联的十元环通道，显示出对烯烃的出色选择性，特别是对于较低的SiO2/Al2O3比率。沸石的酸性在催化性能中起着关键作用；研究表明，在C4裂解过程中，强酸位点至关重要。为了优化催化性能，采取了多种酸性改性技术，如去铝化和弱化方法。这些修改旨在调整沸石的酸性，以更好地满足催化反应的具体需求，如提高丙烯的产率。在选择和实施这些策略时，需要考虑所用支持材料的类型，考虑因素包括酸性和稳定性的平衡、活性降低机制（如结焦）的可能性以及催化剂在实现所需产品的高选择性和产率方面的效率。
