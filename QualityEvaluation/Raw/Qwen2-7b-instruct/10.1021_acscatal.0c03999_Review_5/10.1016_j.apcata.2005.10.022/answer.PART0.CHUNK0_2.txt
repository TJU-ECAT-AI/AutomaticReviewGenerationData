1. To enhance the crystallinity and shorten synthesis time of zeolites, adding seed crystals or salts to the reaction mixtures is an effective strategy. However, adding salts might not be advantageous for the synthesis of ZSM-48 zeolite.

2. Our previous studies revealed that while the quantity of weak acid sites remained constant, the catalytic activity significantly declined as the concentration of strong acid sites diminished.

3. The desorption of ammonia from the low-temperature peak in TPD tests can be influenced by experimental conditions. There is ongoing debate regarding whether this ammonia indicates actual weak acid sites or merely physical adsorption.

4. Zeolites with a relatively lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, like HZSM-48, exhibit suitable acidity for C4-olefin cracking, allowing for the production of a high yield of propylene.

5. The main cause of deactivation in HZSM-48 during C4-olefin cracking reactions is coking.

1. 为了提高沸石的结晶性和缩短合成时间，可以通过向反应混合物中添加种子晶体或盐来实现。然而，向沸石合成中添加盐可能不利于ZSM-48沸石的形成。

2. 我们之前的研究表明，在强酸位点浓度下降的情况下，虽然弱酸位点的数量保持不变，但催化活性显著降低。

3. 在TPD测试中的低温峰脱附的氨量受到实验条件的影响。关于低温峰脱附的氨是否代表实际的弱酸位点还是物理吸附，还存在争议。

4. 具有相对较低SiO2/Al2O3比的沸石（如HZSM-48）具有适合C4-烯烃裂解的适宜酸性，从而能够产生高产率的丙烯。

5. 在C4-烯烃裂解反应中，HZSM-48失活的主要原因是结焦。
