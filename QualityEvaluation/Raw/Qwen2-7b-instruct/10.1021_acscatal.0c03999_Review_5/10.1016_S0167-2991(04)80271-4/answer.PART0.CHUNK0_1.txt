[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 catalyst was also prepared by the template-ion exchange (TIE) method."
[3] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
[4] "While MCM-41 was white, the color of Cr-MCM-41 was pale green as synthesized and changed to pale yellow after the calcinations at 550 C for 6 h."
[5] "The peak intensities for the Cr-containing MCM-41 samples were not significantly lowered as compared with those for the purely silicious MCM-41,suggesting that the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of chromium up to a content of 1.7 wt% (Si/Cr=50)."
[6] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3."
[7] "During the reaction over Cr-MCM-41 DHT and Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalysts with both Si/Cr ratios of 50, the conversion of C3H8 gradually decreased, indicating an occurring of the deactivation of catalyst."
[8] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
[9] "It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size, typically ranging from 2 to 10 nm, and high surface area, often reaching around 1000 m^2/g. These features enable efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. Zeolite supports, such as MCM-41, are particularly advantageous due to their ability to maintain long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores even after the introduction of chromium, as evidenced by the peak intensities in XRD patterns. The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts shows that the chromium species in the zeolite framework play a crucial role in the reaction, specifically in the form of Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination, which is reduced to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation process. This reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is essential for the activity of the catalyst.

The critical evaluation of various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, focuses on optimizing the catalytic performance by altering the acidity and structure of the zeolite support. Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite, potentially enhancing the dispersion of active metals and improving their stability. Weakening methods involve modifying the zeolite structure to weaken its acidity, which can reduce unwanted side reactions and improve product selectivity. The selection of these strategies depends on the type of zeolite used as the support, as well as the specific reaction conditions and desired product outcomes. Key considerations include the balance between acidity, metal dispersion, and stability, ensuring that the modified zeolite support provides an optimal environment for the desired catalytic reaction.

制备Cr-MCM-41催化剂的方法包括直接水热合成（DHT）法和模板离子交换（TIE）法。Cr-MCM-41在Si/Cr比为50时，表现出超过15%的产率和超过90%的选择性丙烯。MCM-41为白色，而Cr-MCM-41在合成时呈浅绿色，煅烧后变为浅黄色。引入铬后，MCM-41的长程六方阵列的有序孔结构得以维持，直到Cr含量达到1.7 wt%（Si/Cr比为50）。CO2脱氢化丙烷在Cr-MCM-41 DHT上进行，结果表明，Cr6+四面体配合物在脱氢过程中起着重要作用。通过X射线吸收谱（XANES）分析，可以看出反应前的预边峰显著减弱，边位置向较低能量移动，表明铬从四面体配合的Cr6+转变为八面体配合的Cr3+。因此，四面体配合的Cr6+在脱氢过程中发挥着重要角色。

对于各种酸度改性技术，如去铝化和弱化方法，关键在于优化催化剂性能，通过改变沸石载体的酸度和结构来实现。去铝化减少了沸石中的铝含量，可能提高了活性金属的分散性和稳定性。弱化方法涉及修改沸石结构以减弱其酸性，从而减少不必要的副反应并提高产物选择性。选择这些策略取决于使用的特定沸石类型以及反应条件和期望的产品结果。关键考虑因素包括酸度、金属分散性和稳定性的平衡，确保修改后的沸石载体提供理想的催化反应环境。
