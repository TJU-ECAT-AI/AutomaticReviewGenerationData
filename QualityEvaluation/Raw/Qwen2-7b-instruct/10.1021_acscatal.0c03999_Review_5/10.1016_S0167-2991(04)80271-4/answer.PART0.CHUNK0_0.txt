[2] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size from 2 to 10 nm as well as high surface area (ca. 1000 m g−1), and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

[6] "The peak intensities for the Cr-containing MCM-41 samples were not significantly lowered as compared with those for the purely silicious MCM-41, suggesting that the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of chromium up to a content of 1.7 wt%."
[7] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content."

[9] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves considering their unique characteristics, specifically the uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels they possess, which allow for controlled pore sizes ranging from 2 to 10 nm and high surface areas (around 1000 m/g). This makes them ideal for accommodating and facilitating the reactions of interest. The direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method provides a straightforward approach to preparing these materials. Additionally, the template-ion exchange (TIE) method further enhances their versatility and adaptability. 

In the context of CO2-ODHP, the use of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating chromium into zeolite structures. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance, with a high selectivity for propene production exceeding 90% and a yield consistently above 15%. The introduction of chromium does not compromise the long-range regularity of the hexagonal arrays of mesopores, maintaining structural integrity up to 1.7 wt% of the chromium content. The conversion of propane increases almost linearly with chromium content, showcasing the critical role of chromium species in the reaction mechanism.

The reoxidation process plays a crucial role in regenerating the catalyst, allowing for its reactivation. This cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ coordination states is essential for the dehydrogenation process, highlighting the importance of the redox properties of chromium in the reaction dynamics. These findings underscore the potential of modifying zeolite supports through acidity adjustments, such as dealumination and weakening methods, to optimize catalytic performance. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve understanding the specific requirements of the reaction system, the compatibility of the modification technique with the zeolite structure, and the impact on the catalyst's overall activity and stability.
