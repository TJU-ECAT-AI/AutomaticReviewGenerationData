The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size, high surface area, and ability to sustain long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores after the introduction of chromium up to a certain content. The acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by altering the acidity and reactivity of the zeolite support. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites involve understanding the specific requirements of the catalytic process, such as the desired level of acidity, pore size distribution, and surface area, to ensure compatibility with the catalyst components and achieve optimal activity and stability.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，沸石作为支持材料的有利特性包括其具有可控孔径大小、均匀有序的介孔通道和高比表面积。在引入铬至一定含量后，沸石仍能保持长程有序的六方阵列微孔结构。酸性修饰技术，如去铝化和减弱方法，通过改变酸性和反应性来优化催化性能。选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素涉及了解特定催化过程的需求，例如所需的酸度水平、孔径分布和比表面积，以确保与催化剂组分的兼容性并实现最佳活性和稳定性。
