2.1. Materials preparation
The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by calcination of tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) parent zeolite in air at 550 C for 15 h. The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution at 80 C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95 C overnight.

2.2. Materials characterization
Analysis of the acidic properties of samples was performed by adsorption of pyridine (Py) followed by infrared spectroscopy. Before analysis, the samples were pressed at 1 ton cm2 into thin wafers of ca. 10 mg cm2 and placed inside the IR cell. Then, the wafers were activated by calcination in static conditions at 723 K for 3 h in O2 (1.6·104 Pa) and outgassed at 573 K (103 Pa) for 1 h. After the wafers were contacted at room temperature with gaseous Py (133 Pa). The IR spectra were recorded after desorption at room temperature and 423 K for 1 h with a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer (resolution 2 cm1, 128 scans).

29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 99.3 MHz with Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer and 7 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 5 kHz.
Tetramethylsilane was used as reference. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a 4.2 μs excitation pulse and a 10 s recycle delay. 27Al and 1H MAS NMR experiments were performed using a 4 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 12 kHz. The resonance frequency of 500.16 MHz and 130.33 MHz were used for recording of 1H and 27Al, respectively. An aqueous Al(NO3)3 1 N solution was used as second

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-PDH catalysts involves considering their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area. These characteristics allow for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. Dealumination modifies the acidity of zeolites by removing aluminum atoms, resulting in a lower acidity level that is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene. Weakening methods, such as reducing the strength of the zeolite framework, can also alter acidity levels. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve balancing the trade-offs between acidity and stability, ensuring high dispersion of the catalyst, and optimizing the specific surface area for efficient interaction with reactants and products.

分析用于CO2-PDH催化剂支撑材料的特性，涉及到考虑其三维结构、大孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大的比表面积。这些特点允许对铬氧化物种进行高分散和浓度的分布。去铝化通过去除铝原子来修改酸性，导致较低的酸度水平，这适合实现高丙烯选择性。减弱方法，如降低沸石骨架的强度，也可以改变酸度水平。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括平衡酸度与稳定性的权衡，确保催化剂的高分散，并优化比表面积以有效地与反应物和产物相互作用。
