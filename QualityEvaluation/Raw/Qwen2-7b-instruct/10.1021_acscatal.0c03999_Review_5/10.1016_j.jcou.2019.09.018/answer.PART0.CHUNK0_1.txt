2.1. Materials preparation
The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by calcination of tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) parent zeolite in air at 550°C for 15 h. The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L−1 HNO3 solution at 80°C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95°C overnight.

2.2. Materials characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of supports and catalysts were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 154,05 pm) in 2θ range of 545.

Analysis of the acidic properties of samples was performed by adsorption of pyridine (Py) followed by infrared spectroscopy.

Tetramethylsilane was used as reference. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 99.3 MHz with Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer and 7 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 5 kHz.

27Al and 1H MAS NMR experiments were performed using a 4 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 12 kHz. The resonance frequency of 500.16 MHz and 130.33 MHz were used for recording of 1H and 27Al, respectively.

An aqueous Al(NO3)3 1 N solution was used as second

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-PDH catalysts include their three-dimensional structure, large pore sizes, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface areas. Dealumination modifies the acidity of the zeolite by removing aluminum, which results in a more suitable low acidity for achieving high selectivity to propene. Weakening methods may refer to reducing the acidity further. These modifications optimize catalytic performance by ensuring high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used as support, the desired level of acidity, and the specific requirements of the CO2-PDH process.

使沸石成为CO2-PDH催化剂支持材料的特性包括其三维结构、大孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大的比表面积。去铝化通过去除铝来修改酸性，结果产生更适合实现高丙烯选择性的较低酸度。可能的减弱方法是指进一步降低酸度。这些修改通过确保铬氧化物物种的高分散和浓度优化了催化性能。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石类型、所需酸度水平以及CO2-PDH过程的具体要求。
