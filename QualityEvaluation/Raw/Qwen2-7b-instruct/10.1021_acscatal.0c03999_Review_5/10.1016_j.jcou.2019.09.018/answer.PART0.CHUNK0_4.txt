[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."
[2] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air."
[3] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."

1. Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-PDH catalysts due to their three-dimensional structure, larger pores compared to ZSM-5, high thermal and acid stability, and substantial surface area. These properties facilitate high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species.

2. Dealumination of zeolites like Beta enhances their suitability for CO2-PDH by removing aluminum, leading to reduced acidity. This results in better selectivity for propene formation. However, over γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts, CO2 addition can poison the catalyst, and using active carbon is limited by periodic regeneration with air.

3. Dealumination and subsequent simple impregnation procedures provide an effective strategy for dispersing chromium species on zeolite supports, resulting in excellent catalyst performance for CO2-PDH.

1. 由于其三维结构、与ZSM-5相比较大的孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及需要的大量比表面积，沸石是CO2-PDH催化剂的理想支撑材料。这些特性有利于高铬物种的分散和浓度。

2. 对于沸石如Beta进行脱铝处理可以增强其用于CO2-PDH的能力，通过去除铝降低了酸性，从而提高了丙烯选择性。然而，在γ-Al2O3支持的催化剂中，CO2的添加会导致催化剂中毒，而使用活性碳受限于周期性的空气再生。

3. 脱铝和随后的简单浸渍程序提供了一种有效的方法，用于在沸石上分散铬物种，从而实现了CO2-PDH优异的催化剂性能。
