[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."
[2] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
[3] "Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[5] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[6] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique structure, thermal and acid stability, and large surface area. Dealumination enhances these properties by removing aluminum, leading to an increased silicon-to-aluminum ratio, which is beneficial for high chromium dispersion. This results in better catalytic performance for CO2-PDH. For instance, dealumination of Beta zeolite creates a support with a higher Si/Al ratio, facilitating the dispersion of chromium species. Additionally, the acidity of the support plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity of propene formation. A lower acidity in SiBeta supports high propene selectivity (over 80%), whereas higher acidity in AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. The use of dealumination allows for optimization of acidity, leading to improved catalytic performance. Furthermore, the introduction of CO2 into the dehydrogenation process enhances propene formation rates, particularly over SiBeta-supported chromium catalysts, demonstrating the effectiveness of dealumination in enhancing CO2-PDH catalysis.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，沸石作为支撑材料具有独特结构、热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大表面积的特性使其成为理想的选择。脱铝通过提高硅与铝的比例来增强这些特性，从而有利于铬物种的分散，进而提高CO2-PDH的催化性能。例如，对Beta沸石进行脱铝处理，可获得更高硅铝比的支持物，有助于铬物种的分散。此外，支持物的酸性在决定丙烯选择性方面起着关键作用。SiBeta中较低的酸性适合实现丙烯选择性（超过80%），而AlBeta中的较高酸性则促进丙烷裂解为轻质烃类。脱铝处理允许对酸性进行优化，从而提高CO2-PDH的催化性能。此外，将CO2引入脱氢过程可以增强丙烯形成速率，尤其是在SiBeta支持的铬催化剂上表现更为明显，这证明了脱铝处理在提高CO2-PDH催化性能方面的有效性。
