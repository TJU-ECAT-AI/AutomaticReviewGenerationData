[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."
[2] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
[3] "Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[5] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[6] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique structure, thermal and acid stability, and large surface area. Dealumination enhances these properties by removing aluminum, leading to an increased silicon-to-aluminum ratio, which is beneficial for high chromium dispersion. This results in better catalytic performance for CO2-PDH. For instance, dealumination of Beta zeolite creates a support with a higher Si/Al ratio, facilitating the dispersion of chromium species. Additionally, the acidity of the support plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity of propene formation. A lower acidity in SiBeta supports high propene selectivity (over 80%), whereas higher acidity in AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. The use of dealumination allows for optimization of acidity, leading to improved catalytic performance. Furthermore, the introduction of CO2 into the dehydrogenation process enhances propene formation rates, particularly over SiBeta-supported chromium catalysts, demonstrating the effectiveness of dealumination in enhancing CO2-PDH catalysis.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，沸石作为支撑材料具有独特结构、热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大表面积的特性使其成为理想的选择。脱铝通过提高硅与铝的比例来增强这些特性，从而有利于铬物种的分散，进而提高CO2-PDH的催化性能。例如，对Beta沸石进行脱铝处理，可获得更高硅铝比的支持物，有助于铬物种的分散。此外，支持物的酸性在决定丙烯选择性方面起着关键作用。SiBeta中较低的酸性适合实现丙烯选择性（超过80%），而AlBeta中的较高酸性则促进丙烷裂解为轻质烃类。脱铝处理允许对酸性进行优化，从而提高CO2-PDH的催化性能。此外，将CO2引入脱氢过程可以增强丙烯形成速率，尤其是在SiBeta支持的铬催化剂上表现更为明显，这证明了脱铝处理在提高CO2-PDH催化性能方面的有效性。

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-PDH catalysts include their three-dimensional structure, large pore sizes, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface areas. Dealumination modifies the acidity of the zeolite by removing aluminum, which results in a more suitable low acidity for achieving high selectivity to propene. Weakening methods may refer to reducing the acidity further. These modifications optimize catalytic performance by ensuring high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used as support, the desired level of acidity, and the specific requirements of the CO2-PDH process.

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we find that Beta zeolite stands out due to its unique structure, which offers larger pores compared to ZSM-5, providing a suitable environment for the high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. This feature contributes to optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination of Beta zeolite, combined with a simple impregnation procedure for chromium dispersion, yields excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH. Mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx, with their high specific surface areas (typically over 1000 m²/g), enable better dispersion and concentration of chromium species compared to unordered silica supports. In contrast, γ-Al2O3 and active carbon suffer from CO2 poisoning and require periodic regeneration with air, limiting their application in CO2-PDH.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve assessing the zeolite's structure, surface area, stability, and compatibility with chromium dispersion methods. Beta zeolite, thanks to its unique characteristics, emerges as a preferred choice for CO2-ODHP catalysts.

分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的沸石的独特性质，我们发现Beta沸石因其独特的结构而脱颖而出，其孔径比ZSM-5大，提供了一个适合高铬氧化物种分散和集中的环境。这一特性有助于优化催化性能。对Beta沸石进行去铝化，并结合简单的浸渍方法分散铬，产生了用于CO2-PDH的优秀催化剂。介孔材料如MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15或MSUx，由于其较高的比表面积（通常超过1000 m²/g），能更好地分散和集中铬物种，相比无序硅基支持物而言。相比之下，γ-Al2O3和活性碳受到CO2中毒的影响，并且需要周期性的空气再生，这限制了它们在CO2-PDH的应用。

在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括评估沸石的结构、表面面积、稳定性和与铬分散方法的兼容性。Beta沸石，得益于其独特特性，成为首选的CO2-ODHP催化剂选择。

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-PDH catalysts involves considering their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area. These characteristics allow for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. Dealumination modifies the acidity of zeolites by removing aluminum atoms, resulting in a lower acidity level that is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene. Weakening methods, such as reducing the strength of the zeolite framework, can also alter acidity levels. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve balancing the trade-offs between acidity and stability, ensuring high dispersion of the catalyst, and optimizing the specific surface area for efficient interaction with reactants and products.
