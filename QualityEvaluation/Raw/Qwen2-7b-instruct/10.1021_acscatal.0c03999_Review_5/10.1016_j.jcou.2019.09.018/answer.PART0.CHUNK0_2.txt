[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."
[2] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
[3] "Due to large specific surface area (in the most cases above 1000 m2 g−1) of mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15 or MSUx a high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species can be obtained in comparison to unordered silica support."
[4] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we find that Beta zeolite stands out due to its unique structure, which offers larger pores compared to ZSM-5, providing a suitable environment for the high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. This feature contributes to optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination of Beta zeolite, combined with a simple impregnation procedure for chromium dispersion, yields excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH. Mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx, with their high specific surface areas (typically over 1000 m²/g), enable better dispersion and concentration of chromium species compared to unordered silica supports. In contrast, γ-Al2O3 and active carbon suffer from CO2 poisoning and require periodic regeneration with air, limiting their application in CO2-PDH.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve assessing the zeolite's structure, surface area, stability, and compatibility with chromium dispersion methods. Beta zeolite, thanks to its unique characteristics, emerges as a preferred choice for CO2-ODHP catalysts.

分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的沸石的独特性质，我们发现Beta沸石因其独特的结构而脱颖而出，其孔径比ZSM-5大，提供了一个适合高铬氧化物种分散和集中的环境。这一特性有助于优化催化性能。对Beta沸石进行去铝化，并结合简单的浸渍方法分散铬，产生了用于CO2-PDH的优秀催化剂。介孔材料如MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15或MSUx，由于其较高的比表面积（通常超过1000 m²/g），能更好地分散和集中铬物种，相比无序硅基支持物而言。相比之下，γ-Al2O3和活性碳受到CO2中毒的影响，并且需要周期性的空气再生，这限制了它们在CO2-PDH的应用。

在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括评估沸石的结构、表面面积、稳定性和与铬分散方法的兼容性。Beta沸石，得益于其独特特性，成为首选的CO2-ODHP催化剂选择。
