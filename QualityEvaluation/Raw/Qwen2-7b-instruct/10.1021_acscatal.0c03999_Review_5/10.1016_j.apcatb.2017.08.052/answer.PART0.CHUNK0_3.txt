Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, they possess unique characteristics such as high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and tunable acidity. Acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, are essential in optimizing catalytic performance. These strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used and involve altering the acidity profile by removing aluminum atoms (dealumination) or reducing the strength of acid sites (weakening methods).
