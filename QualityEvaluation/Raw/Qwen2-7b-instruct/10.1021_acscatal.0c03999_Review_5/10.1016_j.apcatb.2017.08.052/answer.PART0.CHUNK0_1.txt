Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves recognizing their high surface area, pore structure, and tunable acidity. Dealumination enhances the acidity of zeolites by modifying their structure, while weakening techniques adjust acidity through specific chemical treatments. Optimizing catalytic performance necessitates a careful selection of zeolite type and the application of appropriate acidity modification techniques. Key considerations in choosing and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, reaction conditions, and the desired product yield.
