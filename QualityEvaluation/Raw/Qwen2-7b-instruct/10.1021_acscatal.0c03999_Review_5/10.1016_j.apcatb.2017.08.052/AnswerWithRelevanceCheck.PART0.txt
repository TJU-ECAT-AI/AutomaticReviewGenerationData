          Zeolites are extensively studied due to their properties of high surface area, large pore volume, and well-defined microporous structure, which aid in the adsorption and separation of reactants and products. Techniques like dealumination and weakening are pivotal in improving the catalytic performance of zeolite supports. Dealumination entails removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, thereby increasing acidity and propylene selectivity. Conversely, weakening methods decrease the framework's strength to enhance acidity. Factors to consider when selecting and applying these strategies are the type of zeolite, the targeted level of acidity, and the specific reaction conditions.

          Zeolites are widely acknowledged as highly effective catalyst supports due to their defined pore structures, high surface area, and distinctive acidity. Different acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, are utilized to customize the acidity of zeolite supports for optimal catalytic performance. Dealumination entails removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite structure, increasing Lewis acid sites that can boost propylene formation in CO2-ODHP reactions. In contrast, weakening methods seek to lower the strength of acidic sites in zeolites, potentially enhancing propylene selectivity. The choice of the appropriate zeolite type and implementation of these strategies is contingent on aspects like specific reaction conditions and desired product distribution.
