[1] "Zeolites have been widely recognized as highly efficient supports for catalysts due to their well-defined pore structures, high surface area, and unique acidity."
[2] "Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening, are applied to tailor the acidity of zeolite supports to optimize catalytic performance."
[3] "Dealumination involves removing Al atoms from zeolite structures, leading to increased Lewis acid sites which can enhance propylene formation during CO2-ODHP reactions."
[4] "Weakening methods, on the other hand, aim to reduce the strength of acidic sites within zeolites, potentially improving the selectivity towards propylene."
[5] "The selection of appropriate zeolite type and implementation of acidity modification strategies depends on factors such as the specific reaction conditions and desired product distribution."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts reveals their well-defined pore structures, high surface area, and unique acidity. Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening, are utilized to tailor the acidity of zeolite supports. Dealumination increases Lewis acid sites, enhancing propylene formation during CO2-ODHP reactions. Weakening methods reduce the strength of acidic sites, potentially improving the selectivity towards propylene. The selection of zeolite type and implementation of these strategies depend on factors such as specific reaction conditions and desired product distribution.
