Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their high surface area and pore structure. Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, are employed to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework to alter its acidity, while weakening methods reduce the strength of acid sites on the zeolite surface. These modifications enhance the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. The choice of zeolite type and the specific modification strategy depends on the reaction conditions and desired product. For example, beta zeolites might benefit more from dealumination, while ZSM-5 could be optimized through weakening.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的有前景性质，需要理解它们的高比表面积和孔结构。各种酸性改性技术，如去铝化和弱化，被用来优化催化性能。去铝化是指从沸石骨架中去除铝原子，改变其酸性，而弱化方法则降低了沸石表面酸位的强度。这些修改可以提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。选择沸石类型和特定的修改策略取决于反应条件和所需的产品。例如，β沸石可能更适合通过去铝化受益，而ZSM-5可以通过弱化来优化。
