Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, the literature highlights their high surface area, large pore volume, and well-defined microporous structure, which are advantageous for adsorbing and separating reactants and products. Acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening, are essential in boosting catalytic performance. Dealumination increases acidity and improves propylene selectivity by removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework. Weakening methods, which reduce the framework's strength, also enhance acidity. When selecting and applying these strategies, factors to consider are the type of zeolite, the required level of acidity, and the specific reaction conditions.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料有前景的性质，文献强调了它们的高比表面积、大孔体积和明确的微孔结构，这些特征有利于吸附和分离反应物和产物。酸性修改技术，包括去铝化和减弱，对于提高沸石支撑体的催化性能至关重要。去铝化通过从沸石骨架中移除铝原子来增加酸性和提高丙烯选择性。另一方面，减弱方法通过降低骨架的强度也能增强酸性。在选择和实施这些策略时需要考虑的因素包括所使用的沸石类型、所需酸度水平以及特定反应条件。
