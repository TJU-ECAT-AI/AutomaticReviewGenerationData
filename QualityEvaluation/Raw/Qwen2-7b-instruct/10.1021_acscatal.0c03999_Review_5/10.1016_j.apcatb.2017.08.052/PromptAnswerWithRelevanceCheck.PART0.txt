[1] "Zeolites have been widely explored due to their high surface area, large pore volume, and well-defined microporous structure, which facilitates the adsorption and separation of reactants and products."
[2] "Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, are crucial in enhancing the catalytic performance of zeolite supports."
[3] "Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, leading to an increase in acidity and improved propylene selectivity."
[4] "Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve reducing the strength of the zeolite framework, which can also enhance acidity."
[5] "Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the desired level of acidity, and the specific reaction conditions."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, the literature highlights their high surface area, large pore volume, and well-defined microporous structure, which are advantageous for adsorbing and separating reactants and products. Acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening, are essential in boosting catalytic performance. Dealumination increases acidity and improves propylene selectivity by removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework. Weakening methods, which reduce the framework's strength, also enhance acidity. When selecting and applying these strategies, factors to consider are the type of zeolite, the required level of acidity, and the specific reaction conditions.
