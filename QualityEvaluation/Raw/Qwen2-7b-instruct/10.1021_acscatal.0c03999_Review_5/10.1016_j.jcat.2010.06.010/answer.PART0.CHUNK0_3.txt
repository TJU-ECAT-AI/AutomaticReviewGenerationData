[1] "It should be stressed that the concentration of V4+ sites in the as-prepared catalyst was significantly lower than that of V5+."
[2] "Moreover, the zero-field splitting of V3+ with a total electron spin of S = 1 may be too large for an allowed spin transition to occur."
[3] "The fact that there is still a small rest of the V4+ signal seen after evacuation at 773 K is an additional hint for the presence of some oligomer- ized VxOy clusters, in which vanadium species are usually octahe- drally coordinated."
[4] "This signal becomes more pronounced after a short warming to 293 K (spectrum 4 in Fig. 1A), indicating that more reduced vanadium sites have been oxidized."
[5] "When N2O reacted with reduced VOx species, no EPR-active oxygen radical species were detected."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts are their high surface areas and potential for high dispersion of catalytically active surface sites. Zeolites can provide a large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active catalysts like vanadium oxide (VOx) species. This dispersion ensures rapid diffusion of reactants and products, minimizing consecutive reactions and enhancing the selectivity of the catalyst. Zeolites' mesoporous structure allows for efficient mass transport, which is crucial for catalytic processes. Additionally, the acidity of zeolites can be modified through techniques such as dealumination and weakening to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite framework, which can alter its acidity profile and enhance the selectivity of the catalyst. Weakening involves breaking the bonds within the zeolite framework, which can also affect the acidity and thus the performance of the catalyst. The selection of these strategies depends on the type of zeolite used as a support, as different zeolites may require different modifications to achieve optimal performance.

用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料，沸石的特性主要是它们的高比表面积和为催化活性表面提供高度分散的能力。沸石可以提供大量的比表面积，这有助于分散如二氧化钒（VOx）这样的催化剂。这种分散确保了反应物和产物的快速扩散，减少了连续反应并提高了催化剂的选择性。沸石的介孔结构允许有效的质量传输，这对于催化过程至关重要。此外，可以通过去铝化和减弱等技术来修改沸石的酸性，以优化催化剂性能。去铝化降低了沸石框架中的铝含量，这可以改变其酸性特征并增强催化剂的选择性。减弱涉及破坏沸石框架内的键，这也可能影响酸性和催化剂的性能。这些策略的选择取决于所使用的沸石类型，因为不同的沸石可能需要不同的修改才能达到最佳性能。
