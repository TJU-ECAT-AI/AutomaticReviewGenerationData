The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area and ability to provide a highly dispersed surface for the catalytically active VOx species. Zeolites are particularly advantageous because they can offer large pores, which prevent mass transport limitations for the target reaction, ensuring rapid diffusion of propene out of the pore system and reducing consecutive propene combustion. 

Acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening can optimize catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity of the zeolite support. Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite framework, leading to an increase in acidity and potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Weakening involves breaking the crystal structure of the zeolite, which can also lead to increased acidity and improved performance. The selection and implementation of these strategies should consider the type of zeolite used, as different zeolites have varying requirements for acidity and dispersion of the active species. For instance, mesoporous materials like MCM-41 offer advantages over others due to their high surface area and potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites.

用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料的特性包括其高比表面积和为活性VOx物种提供高度分散表面的能力。沸石特别有前景，因为它们能够提供较大的孔隙，防止目标反应的传质限制，确保丙烯迅速从孔系统中扩散出去，减少连续丙烯燃烧。

酸性修改技术，如去铝化和削弱，可以通过调整沸石支撑的酸性来优化催化性能。去铝化减少了沸石框架中的铝含量，导致酸度增加，并可能增强催化活性。削弱涉及破坏沸石晶体结构，这也可能导致酸度增加并改善性能。在选择和实施这些策略时，应考虑所使用的沸石类型，因为不同类型的沸石对酸性和活性位点的分散有不同的需求。例如，像MCM-41这样的介孔材料因其高比表面积和活性表面VOx位点的高度分散优势而具有优势。
