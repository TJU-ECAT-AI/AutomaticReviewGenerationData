On the nature and reactivity of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O on VOx/MCM-41 used for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This study aimed to experimentally identify the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The focus was on understanding the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of propane, propene, and carbon monoxide.

By EPR measurements under controlled atmosphere conditions at two different microwave frequencies (X- and Q-band), the formation of a Vn+  O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species has been detected on the surface of a prereduced 2.7 wt.% VOx/MCM-41 catalyst after contact with gas-phase O2 and identified by spectra simulation.

EPR measurements conducted under controlled atmosphere conditions at two microwave frequencies (X-band and Q-band) revealed the formation of a Vn+  O (where n equals 4 or 5) radical anion species on the surface of a reduced 2.7% VOx/MCM-41 catalyst after exposure to gas-phase oxygen. The species was identified through spectrum simulations.

The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The increased activity but reduced propene selectivity observed with oxygen might be attributed to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O2 2, and Vn+  O species. The latter species was experimentally confirmed to be highly active, capable of partially reacting with propane and completely reacting with propene even at room temperature.

氧的存在可能归因于形成OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O2 2和Vn+  O物种。后者物种通过实验证明非常活跃，能够部分与丙烷反应，并且甚至在室温下完全与丙烯反应。

The enhanced activity yet decreased propene selectivity with oxygen could be attributed to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O2 2, and Vn+  O species. The latter species was experimentally verified to be highly active, capable of partially reacting with propane and completely reacting with propene even at room temperature.

The higher activity but lower propene selectivity observed in the ODH of propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case (which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane with N2O.
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The higher reactivity but lower propene selectivity noted in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen compared to nitrogen dioxide can be attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species in the former scenario, which preferentially consume propene. Meanwhile, in propane oxidative dehydrogenation with nitrogen dioxide, less reactive but more selective nucleophilic oxygen ions act as reactants.

在使用氧气进行丙烷的氧化脱氢反应中观察到的较高活性但较低丙烯选择性可以归因于前者的高度反应性亲电氧物种的存在，这些物种优先消耗丙烯。相比之下，在使用氮氧化物进行丙烷氧化脱氢反应时，活性较低但选择性较高的亲核氧离子作为反应物发挥作用。
