[1] "It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance."
[2] "Mesoporous silica materials provide high surface areas and, hence, the potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites."
[3] "Furthermore, vanadium sites in tetrahedral oxygen coordination, being the major species on VOx/MCM catalysts with low vanadium loadings, appeared to be less active but more selective than those in octahedral oxygen coordination."
[4] "As a result, mass transport within the pores does not limit the target reaction ensuring rapid diffusion of propene out of the pore system and, thus, reducing consecutive propene combustion."
[5] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree."
[6] "Based on this early work, similar EPR signals observed after oxygen adsorption on prereduced V silicalite [30] and after treatment of VS-1 with aqueous H2O2 [31] were assigned to V O 2 species."
[7] "For analyzing the reaction of N2O and O2 with tetravalent vanadium, a VAOH species was assumed as initial state, from which hydrogen abstraction by N2O or O2 should lead to a VO3+ vanadyl site and HO or HOO radicals, respectively, as primary intermediates [32]."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area, which allows for the dispersion of active sites, and their ability to control the coordination of vanadium species, leading to better selectivity. The tetrahedral coordination of vanadium species in zeolites tends to be less active but more selective than octahedral coordination. Zeolites also facilitate mass transport, enabling efficient diffusion of reactants and products within the catalyst structure. The activity of vanadium sites increases with the agglomerization degree of the catalyst particles. Zeolites can also modify acidity through techniques such as dealumination and weakening, which can optimize catalytic performance depending on the type of zeolite used. These modifications typically involve altering the framework structure of the zeolite to enhance or suppress acidity, thereby affecting the reactivity of the catalyst.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂，沸石作为支撑材料的有利性质包括其高比表面积，这有利于活性位点的分散，以及控制钒物种的配位能力，从而提高选择性。在沸石中的四面体配位的钒物种通常比八面体配位的活性较低但选择性较高。沸石还有助于质量传输，确保反应物和产物在催化剂结构内的高效扩散，减少丙烯连续氧化。随着催化剂颗粒聚集度的增加，钒位点的活性也会提高。沸石可以通过处理如去铝化和弱化等技术来修改酸性，这些方法通常涉及改变沸石的骨架结构以增强或抑制酸性，从而影响催化剂的活性。这取决于使用的沸石类型。

[2] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[3] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O."
[4] "This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area and ability to provide a highly dispersed surface for the catalytically active VOx species. Zeolites are particularly advantageous because they can offer large pores, which prevent mass transport limitations for the target reaction, ensuring rapid diffusion of propene out of the pore system and reducing consecutive propene combustion. 

Acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening can optimize catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity of the zeolite support. Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite framework, leading to an increase in acidity and potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Weakening involves breaking the crystal structure of the zeolite, which can also lead to increased acidity and improved performance. The selection and implementation of these strategies should consider the type of zeolite used, as different zeolites have varying requirements for acidity and dispersion of the active species. For instance, mesoporous materials like MCM-41 offer advantages over others due to their high surface area and potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites.

用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料的特性包括其高比表面积和为活性VOx物种提供高度分散表面的能力。沸石特别有前景，因为它们能够提供较大的孔隙，防止目标反应的传质限制，确保丙烯迅速从孔系统中扩散出去，减少连续丙烯燃烧。

酸性修改技术，如去铝化和削弱，可以通过调整沸石支撑的酸性来优化催化性能。去铝化减少了沸石框架中的铝含量，导致酸度增加，并可能增强催化活性。削弱涉及破坏沸石晶体结构，这也可能导致酸度增加并改善性能。在选择和实施这些策略时，应考虑所使用的沸石类型，因为不同类型的沸石对酸性和活性位点的分散有不同的需求。例如，像MCM-41这样的介孔材料因其高比表面积和活性表面VOx位点的高度分散优势而具有优势。

The higher activity but lower propene selectivity observed in the ODH of propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case (which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane with N2O.

[1] "It should be stressed that the concentration of V4+ sites in the as-prepared catalyst was significantly lower than that of V5+."
[2] "Moreover, the zero-field splitting of V3+ with a total electron spin of S = 1 may be too large for an allowed spin transition to occur."
[3] "The fact that there is still a small rest of the V4+ signal seen after evacuation at 773 K is an additional hint for the presence of some oligomer- ized VxOy clusters, in which vanadium species are usually octahe- drally coordinated."
[4] "This signal becomes more pronounced after a short warming to 293 K (spectrum 4 in Fig. 1A), indicating that more reduced vanadium sites have been oxidized."
[5] "When N2O reacted with reduced VOx species, no EPR-active oxygen radical species were detected."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts are their high surface areas and potential for high dispersion of catalytically active surface sites. Zeolites can provide a large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active catalysts like vanadium oxide (VOx) species. This dispersion ensures rapid diffusion of reactants and products, minimizing consecutive reactions and enhancing the selectivity of the catalyst. Zeolites' mesoporous structure allows for efficient mass transport, which is crucial for catalytic processes. Additionally, the acidity of zeolites can be modified through techniques such as dealumination and weakening to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite framework, which can alter its acidity profile and enhance the selectivity of the catalyst. Weakening involves breaking the bonds within the zeolite framework, which can also affect the acidity and thus the performance of the catalyst. The selection of these strategies depends on the type of zeolite used as a support, as different zeolites may require different modifications to achieve optimal performance.

Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions has been applied to elucidate the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of a reduced VOx(2.7 wt.%)/MCM-41 catalyst by gas-phase O2 or N2O.

1. Introduction: Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry.

2. Experimental: 2.1. Catalyst: The preparation and characterization of the supported VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with a vanadium content of 2.7% has been described in detail in Ref. [13].

2.2. EPR measurements under controlled atmosphere conditions: EPR measurements were performed at 77 K on a Bruker ELEXSYS 500-10/12 cw-EPR spectrometer in X-band (microwave frequency  9.5 GHz) using an ER 4102ST rectangular cavity, and in Q-band (microwave frequency  35 GHz) using an ER 5106QT low temperature cylindrical cavity.

3. Results: 3.1. Nature of oxygen species formed upon adsorption of O2 or N2O on reduced VOx/MCM-41: The EPR spectrum of as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 is characterized by a hyperfine structure (hfs) signal, which is typical for axially distorted isolated V4+ species in octahedral or square-pyramidal coordination.

3.2. Reactivity of adsorbed oxygen species against propane, propene, and carbon monoxide: The reactivity of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2 was investigated by in-situ EPR in the following way.

4. Discussion: X-band shfs signals with similar multiline features like those in Fig. 1 have been previously reported by Kazansky et al. after oxygen adsorption on a partially reduced V2O5/SiO2 catalyst [27].

This passage describes the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to study the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed when a reduced vanadium oxide catalyst, supported on mesoporous silica (MCM-41), is reoxidized by either molecular oxygen (O2) or nitrous oxide (N2O). The focus is on understanding how these oxygen species affect the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propene, a process important in petrochemical industries. The catalyst preparation, experimental methods, results, and discussion highlight the identification of Vn+ O (where n=4 or 5) radical anion species and their interactions with propane, propene, and carbon monoxide. The findings suggest that the different electronic nature of these oxygen intermediates influences the selectivity of the ODH reaction when using N2O versus O2.
