[1] "It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance."
[2] "Mesoporous silica materials provide high surface areas and, hence, the potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites."
[3] "Furthermore, vanadium sites in tetrahedral oxygen coordination, being the major species on VOx/MCM catalysts with low vanadium loadings, appeared to be less active but more selective than those in octahedral oxygen coordination."
[4] "As a result, mass transport within the pores does not limit the target reaction ensuring rapid diffusion of propene out of the pore system and, thus, reducing consecutive propene combustion."
[5] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree."
[6] "Based on this early work, similar EPR signals observed after oxygen adsorption on prereduced V silicalite [30] and after treatment of VS-1 with aqueous H2O2 [31] were assigned to V O 2 species."
[7] "For analyzing the reaction of N2O and O2 with tetravalent vanadium, a VAOH species was assumed as initial state, from which hydrogen abstraction by N2O or O2 should lead to a VO3+ vanadyl site and HO or HOO radicals, respectively, as primary intermediates [32]."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area, which allows for the dispersion of active sites, and their ability to control the coordination of vanadium species, leading to better selectivity. The tetrahedral coordination of vanadium species in zeolites tends to be less active but more selective than octahedral coordination. Zeolites also facilitate mass transport, enabling efficient diffusion of reactants and products within the catalyst structure. The activity of vanadium sites increases with the agglomerization degree of the catalyst particles. Zeolites can also modify acidity through techniques such as dealumination and weakening, which can optimize catalytic performance depending on the type of zeolite used. These modifications typically involve altering the framework structure of the zeolite to enhance or suppress acidity, thereby affecting the reactivity of the catalyst.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂，沸石作为支撑材料的有利性质包括其高比表面积，这有利于活性位点的分散，以及控制钒物种的配位能力，从而提高选择性。在沸石中的四面体配位的钒物种通常比八面体配位的活性较低但选择性较高。沸石还有助于质量传输，确保反应物和产物在催化剂结构内的高效扩散，减少丙烯连续氧化。随着催化剂颗粒聚集度的增加，钒位点的活性也会提高。沸石可以通过处理如去铝化和弱化等技术来修改酸性，这些方法通常涉及改变沸石的骨架结构以增强或抑制酸性，从而影响催化剂的活性。这取决于使用的沸石类型。
