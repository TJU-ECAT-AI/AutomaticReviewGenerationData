[1] "Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts because of their high surface area, uniform pore structure, and tunable acidity."
[2] "Acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods can be used to optimize catalytic performance."
[3] "Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite, which can weaken the acidity of the catalyst."
[4] "Weakening methods involve altering the structure of the zeolite to reduce acidity without removing aluminum."
[5] "Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the type of zeolite used as a support."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts includes their high surface area, uniform pore structure, and tunable acidity. Techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods are used to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the aluminum content, potentially weakening acidity, while weakening methods adjust the structure to reduce acidity without removing aluminum. When selecting and implementing these strategies, the type of zeolite used as a support is a key consideration.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的有利性质包括其高比表面积、均匀孔结构和可调酸性。用于优化催化性能的技术如脱铝化和弱化方法被使用。脱铝化通过减少沸石中的铝含量，可能削弱酸性，而弱化方法则通过调整结构来降低酸性而不移除铝。在选择和实施这些策略时，作为支撑使用的沸石类型是一个关键考虑因素。
