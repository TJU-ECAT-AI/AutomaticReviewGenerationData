[1] "Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and tunable acidity."
[2] "Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, are crucial in optimizing catalytic performance."
[3] "Dealumination can increase the acidity of zeolites by removing aluminum atoms, leading to a higher density of acidic sites."
[4] "Weakening methods involve reducing the strength of acidic sites, which can improve selectivity."
[5] "Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the type of zeolite used, as different zeolites may respond differently to these modifications."
[6] "Optimal strategies may involve a combination of dealumination and weakening to achieve a balance between acidity and selectivity."

1.Zeolites are considered favorable support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts because of their high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and adjustable acidity. 
2.Acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening, are essential for enhancing catalytic performance.
3.Dealumination can augment the acidity of zeolites by eliminating aluminum atoms, thereby increasing the concentration of acidic sites.
4.Weakening methods entail reducing the potency of acidic sites, which can enhance selectivity.
5.Selecting and applying these strategies requires careful consideration of the specific zeolite used, as different zeolites may exhibit varying responses to these modifications.
6.Strategies for optimization might involve a combination of dealumination and weakening to achieve a balance between acidity and selectivity.

1.沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支撑材料，因为它们具有高比表面积、明确的孔结构和可调酸性。
2.酸性调整技术，如去铝化和减弱，对于提高催化性能至关重要。
3.去铝化可以通过移除铝原子来增加沸石的酸性，从而增加酸性位点的密度。
4.减弱方法涉及降低酸性位点的强度，这可以提高选择性。
5.在选择并实施这些策略时需要考虑所使用的沸石类型，因为不同的沸石可能对这些修改有不同的响应。
6.优化策略可能涉及结合去铝化和减弱，以实现酸性和选择性之间的平衡。
