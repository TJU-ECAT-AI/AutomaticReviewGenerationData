Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we see they possess unique features such as their porous structure, high surface area, and tunable acidity. Various methods, including dealumination and weakening, can be used to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces aluminum content in the zeolite framework, enhancing acidity. Weakening methods involve breaking the framework to increase surface area and acidity. Key factors in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, desired level of acidity, and impact on catalyst stability. Different types of zeolites, such as mesoporous and microporous, may require different approaches for optimal results. The effectiveness of these modifications depends on achieving a balance between acidity enhancement and maintaining structural integrity. Optimal conditions for these modifications must be carefully determined to avoid negative impacts on catalytic activity or selectivity.

分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的沸石的独特性质，我们发现它们具有独特的特征，如其多孔结构、高比表面积和可调酸性。可以使用多种方法来优化催化性能，例如脱铝化和弱化。脱铝化减少了沸石框架中的铝含量，从而增强了酸性。弱化方法涉及破坏框架，从而增加表面面积和酸性。选择和实施这些策略的关键因素包括所使用的沸石类型、所需的酸度水平以及对催化剂稳定性的影响。不同的沸石类型，如介孔和微孔，可能需要不同的方法以达到最佳结果。这些修改的有效性取决于在增强酸性和保持结构完整性之间找到平衡。必须仔细确定这些修改的最佳条件，以避免对催化活性或选择性产生负面影响。
