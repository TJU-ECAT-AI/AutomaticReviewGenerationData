<p>The optimal steaming temperature of the parent HZSM-5 support with molar Si/Al ratio of 25 is 650 ,and its supported 5%ZnO catalyst affords the maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene at 600 .</p>
<p>The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst is a consequence of high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 support.</p>
<p>The improved stability of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 in comparison with in the absence of CO2 is due to the suppression of coke formation resulting from elimination of the coke by the Boudouard reaction.</p>

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their structure, surface area, pore volume, and acidity. Zeolites, especially MFI-type zeolites like HZSM-5, are chosen for their three-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, medium pore size, and pore channel structure that resists coking. These features make them suitable for supporting catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propylene, especially when combined with the addition of CO2.

The acidity modification techniques used to optimize catalytic performance include dealumination and weakening methods. Dealumination reduces the number of Brnsted acid sites, which can inhibit oligomerization and improve propylene yield. Weakening the acidity further enhances stability by suppressing coke formation. In the case of HZSM-5, steaming treatment at 650°C is found to be optimal, as it provides the right balance between ZnO dispersion and Brnsted acidity, leading to the highest catalytic performance. The addition of CO2 to the feed gas enhances stability by eliminating coke through the Boudouard reaction.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve understanding the specific requirements of the reaction, such as the desired product yield and stability. Different types of zeolites may require different treatments based on their inherent properties. For instance, the steaming treatment at 650°C is effective for HZSM-5, but other zeolites might benefit from different temperatures or treatments depending on their structure and composition. The goal is to find a balance that maximizes catalytic efficiency while minimizing unwanted side reactions and coke formation.

分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的沸石的特性，需要理解它们的结构、表面积、孔体积和酸性。特别是MFI型沸石如HZSM-5，因其三维微孔结构、大的特定表面积、高热稳定性和水热稳定性、中等孔径以及抗结焦的孔道结构而成为理想的选择。这些特征使其能够有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，尤其是在结合二氧化碳添加的情况下。

酸性修改技术优化催化性能包括去铝化和弱化方法。去铝化可以减少Brnsted酸中心的数量，从而抑制多聚化并提高丙烯产率。进一步弱化酸性可以进一步增强稳定性，通过消除焦炭来抑制焦炭形成。对于HZSM-5而言，发现650°C的蒸气处理是最佳的，因为它提供了锌氧化物分散和Brnsted酸性之间的正确平衡，导致最高的催化性能。向反应气体中添加二氧化碳可以增强稳定性，通过布杜瓦尔反应消除焦炭。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素涉及了解反应的具体需求，例如所需的产物产率和稳定性。不同类型的沸石可能根据其内在性质需要不同的处理方式。例如，对HZSM-5的650°C蒸气处理是有效的，但其他沸石可能需要不同的温度或处理方式，取决于其结构和组成。目标是在最大化催化效率的同时，最小化不希望的副反应和焦炭形成。
