[1] "The aim of the present study is to extend our recent work on the applications of HZSM-5-supported oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation to propylene in the presence of CO2."
[2] "Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support."
[3] "Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."

[6] "The NH3-TPD results are in agreement with the model acid-catalyzed reaction data of cumene cracking."
[7] "Therefore, on the other hand, the decrease in Brnsted acidity of HZSM-5 with steaming temperature (Table 2) would diminish the activity in propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "The optimal steaming temperature of the parent HZSM-5 support with molar Si/Al ratio of 25 is 650 ,and its supported 5%ZnO catalyst affords the maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene at 600 ."
[9] "The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst is a consequence of high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 support."

1. Zeolites, specifically HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tri-dimensional micropore structure, large surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, and resistance to coking. These properties enable efficient and stable catalytic activity.

2. The acidity of zeolites can be modified through dealumination and weakening methods to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the number of acid sites, while weakening methods reduce their strength. Both approaches can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, enhancing propylene yield.

3. Acidic sites on HZSM-5 zeolites can be measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and NH3-TPD results corroborate the data from this method. 

4. Decreasing the Brnsted acidity of HZSM-5 with increased steaming temperature diminishes the activity in propane dehydrogenation due to a balance between better ZnO dispersion and decreased Brnsted acidity.

5. The optimal steaming temperature for HZSM-5 is 650°C, which, when supported with 5% ZnO, yields maximum propylene production of 29.7% initially and 20.3% at steady state at 600°C. 

6. The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst is attributed to the high dispersion of ZnO and the appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steamed HZSM-5 support.

7. The presence of CO2 improves catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation, which is eliminated by the Boudouard reaction. This leads to enhanced stability compared to conditions without CO2.

1. 由于其三维微孔结构、大的比表面积、高的热稳定性和水热稳定性以及抗结焦性，沸石ZSM-5是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支持材料。

2. 通过去铝化和削弱方法可以修改沸石的酸性，以优化催化性能。去铝化减少了酸性位点的数量，而削弱方法则降低了酸性的强度。这两种方法都可以抑制丙烯的聚合，从而提高丙烯的产率。

3. 使用模型反应，即环己酮裂解，可以测量沸石中的酸性位点，并且NH3-TPD结果与这种方法的数据一致。

4. 随着蒸煮温度的增加，HZSM-5的酸性降低会减少丙烷脱氢反应的活性，这是因为在提高ZnO分散度的同时减少了酸性位点的强度。

5. HZSM-5的最佳蒸煮温度为650°C，在此温度下，支撑有5%ZnO的催化剂在600°C时能产生最大丙烯产量，初始值为29.7%，稳定状态为20.3%。

6. 这种催化剂的优越催化性能归因于ZnO的高度分散和经过蒸煮处理的HZSM-5支持的适当Brnsted酸性。

7. CO2的存在提高了催化剂的稳定性，因为它通过Boudouard反应消除了焦炭的形成，从而与没有CO2条件相比，表现出增强的稳定性。
