[1] "As to propane dehydrogenation, this new process has been reported to give rather high propylene selectivity due to the lack of deep oxidation of propane."
[2] "Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote the dehydrogenation reaction via a redox mechanism and/or reaction coupling between a simple dehydorgenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
[3] "It is widely recognized that the transformation of propane over zinc-promoted HZSM-5 catalyst proceeds through a bifunctional mechanism."
[4] "Therefore, the decrease in the number of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst would suppress the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, cracking and aromatization, thus leading to the high propylene yield and superior stability due to the decrease in coke formation on the catalyst surface."
[5] "Using DFT calculations, Pidko and van Santen[18] have proposed that the presence of acidic protons in the catalyst can promote the regeneration of the active sites on zinc-promoted ZSM-5, leading to an increase in activity for light alkane dehydrogenation."
[6] "Carbon monoxide was detected in the effluent gases."
[7] "The amount of coke after 30 h reaction in the presence of CO2 is 1.0 wt%, lower than that in the absence of CO2 (1.5 wt%)."
[8] "The full recovery of the activity after the air treatment is due to the removal of carbon species deposited on the catalyst."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their structural features and chemical functionalities. Zeolites, especially those with a MFI-type framework structure, are chosen for their high surface area, three-dimensional micropore structure, and resistance to coking. These attributes facilitate the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, promoting the catalytic reaction.

In terms of acidity modification techniques, dealumination and weakening methods are employed to tailor the acidity of zeolite supports. Dealumination reduces the number of Brnsted acid sites by removing Al atoms, which can inhibit unwanted side reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, cracking, and aromatization. This leads to an enhanced propylene yield and improved stability due to reduced coke formation on the catalyst surface. Weakening the acidity further minimizes these side reactions, ensuring a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene.

The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used as a support. For instance, HZSM-5, a common MFI-type zeolite, is known for its effectiveness in propane dehydrogenation processes. Its suitability as a support is influenced by its Brnsted acidity, which can be modified through dealumination or weakening methods to optimize catalytic performance. The goal is to achieve a balance that maximizes propylene yield while maintaining high stability over multiple reaction cycles.

The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture also plays a significant role in the catalytic performance. CO2 can act as a mild oxidant, promoting the dehydrogenation reaction and suppressing coke formation. This is beneficial for maintaining catalyst stability and enhancing the efficiency of the conversion process.

Regeneration efforts are made to restore the activity of the catalyst after prolonged use. This typically involves removing carbon species deposited on the catalyst surface through treatments like air regeneration, allowing for the full recovery of activity and prolonging the catalyst's lifespan.

分析用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的沸石支持材料的特性涉及理解它们的结构特性和化学功能。特别是具有MFI型框架结构的沸石因其高表面积、三维微孔结构和抗结焦性而被选为支持材料。这些属性有助于反应物和产物的吸附和脱附，促进催化反应。

在酸度修改技术方面，去铝化和削弱方法被用来调整沸石支持材料的酸度。去铝化通过移除Al原子来减少Brnsted酸中心的数量，从而抑制如聚合、环化、裂解和芳构化等副反应，这导致了更高的丙烯产率和稳定性提高，因为减少了催化剂表面的焦炭形成。进一步减弱酸性可进一步最小化这些副反应，确保更高效的丙烷到丙烯转化。

选择和实施这些策略取决于所使用的特定类型沸石作为支持物。例如，HZSM-5，一种常见的MFI型沸石，已知在丙烷脱氢过程中效果良好。其作为支持物的适用性受其Brnsted酸度的影响，可以通过去铝化或削弱方法进行调整以优化催化性能。目标是在最大化丙烯产率的同时保持高稳定性。

反应混合物中CO2的存在也对催化性能起着重要作用。CO2可以作为温和的氧化剂，促进脱氢反应并抑制焦炭形成。这对于维持催化剂稳定性并增强转化过程效率是有益的。

再生努力旨在恢复催化剂在长时间使用后的活性。这通常涉及到通过空气再生等处理去除催化剂表面沉积的碳物种，允许完全恢复活性并延长催化剂的使用寿命。

The properties that make zeolites, specifically ZSM-5, promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, and resistance to coking due to their medium pore size and pore channel structure. These characteristics facilitate the attachment of metal oxide catalysts like ZnO and Ga2O3, enhancing their performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Zeolites can be modified to optimize catalytic performance through acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods. Dealumination reduces the number of acid sites, while weakening the acidity of the acid sites. These modifications are critical for selecting and implementing strategies that balance the need for both sufficient and controlled acidity to avoid side reactions, such as oligomerization, cracking, and aromatization, which can reduce propylene yield and stability. The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used as a support, as different zeolites have varying structures and properties that affect their reactivity and stability.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve assessing the initial acidity of the zeolite support, understanding how different acidity modification techniques affect the balance between the required acidity for the main reaction and the suppression of unwanted side reactions, and evaluating the impact of these modifications on the stability and efficiency of the catalyst. The literature indicates that the optimal steaming temperature for the parent HZSM-5 support is 650°C, and its supported 5%ZnO catalyst provides the maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 600°C. The enhanced stability of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence is due to the suppression of coke formation, facilitated by the Boudouard reaction. This leads to a reduction in coke deposition and improved catalyst stability.

ZSM-5这类沸石之所以成为CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支持材料，是因为它们具有三维微孔结构、大比表面积、良好的热稳定性和水热稳定性，以及中等孔径和孔道结构带来的抗结焦性。这些特性有助于金属氧化物催化剂如ZnO和Ga2O3的附着，从而增强其在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯过程中的性能。对沸石进行酸性改性以优化催化性能的策略包括去铝化和减弱方法。去铝化可以减少酸性位点的数量，而减弱酸性位点的强度。这些修改对于选择和实施策略至关重要，这些策略需要平衡所需的足够且可控的酸性，以避免诸如多聚化、裂解和芳构化等降低丙烯产率和稳定性的副反应。根据特定类型的沸石作为支撑物的选择和实施策略取决于，因为不同的沸石具有不同的结构和性质，影响其活性和稳定性。

在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括评估初始酸性的沸石支撑物，理解不同酸性改性技术如何影响主要反应所需酸性和抑制不希望的副反应之间的平衡，以及评估这些修改对催化剂稳定性和效率的影响。文献表明，对于原始HZSM-5支持物的最佳蒸气处理温度为650°C，其上支持的5%ZnO催化剂在600°C下催化脱氢丙烷生成丙烯过程中提供最大丙烯产率为29.7%和20.3%，分别在初始和稳态阶段。催化剂在CO2存在的条件下相比不存在CO2时的增强稳定性是由于通过布杜瓦德反应抑制焦炭形成所致。这导致焦炭沉积量减少并改善催化剂稳定性。

2. The acidity of zeolites can be modified through dealumination and weakening methods to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the number of acid sites, while weakening methods reduce their strength. Both approaches can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, enhancing propylene yield.

3. Acidic sites on HZSM-5 zeolites can be measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and NH3-TPD results corroborate the data from this method. 

4. Decreasing the Brnsted acidity of HZSM-5 with increased steaming temperature diminishes the activity in propane dehydrogenation due to a balance between better ZnO dispersion and decreased Brnsted acidity.

5. The optimal steaming temperature for HZSM-5 is 650°C, which, when supported with 5% ZnO, yields maximum propylene production of 29.7% initially and 20.3% at steady state at 600°C. 

6. The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst is attributed to the high dispersion of ZnO and the appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steamed HZSM-5 support.

7. The presence of CO2 improves catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation, which is eliminated by the Boudouard reaction. This leads to enhanced stability compared to conditions without CO2.

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their structure, surface area, pore volume, and acidity. Zeolites, especially MFI-type zeolites like HZSM-5, are chosen for their three-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, medium pore size, and pore channel structure that resists coking. These features make them suitable for supporting catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propylene, especially when combined with the addition of CO2.

The acidity modification techniques used to optimize catalytic performance include dealumination and weakening methods. Dealumination reduces the number of Brnsted acid sites, which can inhibit oligomerization and improve propylene yield. Weakening the acidity further enhances stability by suppressing coke formation. In the case of HZSM-5, steaming treatment at 650°C is found to be optimal, as it provides the right balance between ZnO dispersion and Brnsted acidity, leading to the highest catalytic performance. The addition of CO2 to the feed gas enhances stability by eliminating coke through the Boudouard reaction.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve understanding the specific requirements of the reaction, such as the desired product yield and stability. Different types of zeolites may require different treatments based on their inherent properties. For instance, the steaming treatment at 650°C is effective for HZSM-5, but other zeolites might benefit from different temperatures or treatments depending on their structure and composition. The goal is to find a balance that maximizes catalytic efficiency while minimizing unwanted side reactions and coke formation.

分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的沸石的特性，需要理解它们的结构、表面积、孔体积和酸性。特别是MFI型沸石如HZSM-5，因其三维微孔结构、大的特定表面积、高热稳定性和水热稳定性、中等孔径以及抗结焦的孔道结构而成为理想的选择。这些特征使其能够有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，尤其是在结合二氧化碳添加的情况下。

酸性修改技术优化催化性能包括去铝化和弱化方法。去铝化可以减少Brnsted酸中心的数量，从而抑制多聚化并提高丙烯产率。进一步弱化酸性可以进一步增强稳定性，通过消除焦炭来抑制焦炭形成。对于HZSM-5而言，发现650°C的蒸气处理是最佳的，因为它提供了锌氧化物分散和Brnsted酸性之间的正确平衡，导致最高的催化性能。向反应气体中添加二氧化碳可以增强稳定性，通过布杜瓦尔反应消除焦炭。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素涉及了解反应的具体需求，例如所需的产物产率和稳定性。不同类型的沸石可能根据其内在性质需要不同的处理方式。例如，对HZSM-5的650°C蒸气处理是有效的，但其他沸石可能需要不同的温度或处理方式，取决于其结构和组成。目标是在最大化催化效率的同时，最小化不希望的副反应和焦炭形成。
