[1] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support."
[2] "Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."
[3] "Recently, we have demonstrated that Ga2O3 catalysts supported on steam-treated HZSM-5 or phosphorous-modified HZSM-5 are highly active and stable for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2."
[4] "The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst can be attributed to high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the HZSM-5(650) support."
[5] "Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote the dehydrogenation reaction via a redox mechanism and/or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
[6] "The acidity of various HZSM-5 supports was measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and the results are listed in Table 2."
[7] "As presented in Table 2, the number of weak acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 120350), strong acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350600), and total acid sites of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 are evidently lower than those of the parent HZSM-5."
[8] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst after reaction was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA)."
[9] "The enhanced catalyst stability can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 30 h."
[10] "The amount of coke after 30 h reaction in the presence of CO2 is 1.0 wt%, lower than that in the absence of CO2 (1.5 wt%)."
[11] "The full recovery of the activity after the air treatment is due to the removal of carbon species deposited on the catalyst."

The properties that make zeolites, specifically ZSM-5, promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, and resistance to coking due to their medium pore size and pore channel structure. These characteristics facilitate the attachment of metal oxide catalysts like ZnO and Ga2O3, enhancing their performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Zeolites can be modified to optimize catalytic performance through acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods. Dealumination reduces the number of acid sites, while weakening the acidity of the acid sites. These modifications are critical for selecting and implementing strategies that balance the need for both sufficient and controlled acidity to avoid side reactions, such as oligomerization, cracking, and aromatization, which can reduce propylene yield and stability. The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used as a support, as different zeolites have varying structures and properties that affect their reactivity and stability.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve assessing the initial acidity of the zeolite support, understanding how different acidity modification techniques affect the balance between the required acidity for the main reaction and the suppression of unwanted side reactions, and evaluating the impact of these modifications on the stability and efficiency of the catalyst. The literature indicates that the optimal steaming temperature for the parent HZSM-5 support is 650°C, and its supported 5%ZnO catalyst provides the maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 600°C. The enhanced stability of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence is due to the suppression of coke formation, facilitated by the Boudouard reaction. This leads to a reduction in coke deposition and improved catalyst stability.

ZSM-5这类沸石之所以成为CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支持材料，是因为它们具有三维微孔结构、大比表面积、良好的热稳定性和水热稳定性，以及中等孔径和孔道结构带来的抗结焦性。这些特性有助于金属氧化物催化剂如ZnO和Ga2O3的附着，从而增强其在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯过程中的性能。对沸石进行酸性改性以优化催化性能的策略包括去铝化和减弱方法。去铝化可以减少酸性位点的数量，而减弱酸性位点的强度。这些修改对于选择和实施策略至关重要，这些策略需要平衡所需的足够且可控的酸性，以避免诸如多聚化、裂解和芳构化等降低丙烯产率和稳定性的副反应。根据特定类型的沸石作为支撑物的选择和实施策略取决于，因为不同的沸石具有不同的结构和性质，影响其活性和稳定性。

在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括评估初始酸性的沸石支撑物，理解不同酸性改性技术如何影响主要反应所需酸性和抑制不希望的副反应之间的平衡，以及评估这些修改对催化剂稳定性和效率的影响。文献表明，对于原始HZSM-5支持物的最佳蒸气处理温度为650°C，其上支持的5%ZnO催化剂在600°C下催化脱氢丙烷生成丙烯过程中提供最大丙烯产率为29.7%和20.3%，分别在初始和稳态阶段。催化剂在CO2存在的条件下相比不存在CO2时的增强稳定性是由于通过布杜瓦德反应抑制焦炭形成所致。这导致焦炭沉积量减少并改善催化剂稳定性。
