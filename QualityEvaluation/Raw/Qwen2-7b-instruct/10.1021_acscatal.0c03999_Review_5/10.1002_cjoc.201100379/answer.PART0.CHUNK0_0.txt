[1] "As to propane dehydrogenation, this new process has been reported to give rather high propylene selectivity due to the lack of deep oxidation of propane."
[2] "Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote the dehydrogenation reaction via a redox mechanism and/or reaction coupling between a simple dehydorgenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
[3] "It is widely recognized that the transformation of propane over zinc-promoted HZSM-5 catalyst proceeds through a bifunctional mechanism."
[4] "Therefore, the decrease in the number of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst would suppress the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, cracking and aromatization, thus leading to the high propylene yield and superior stability due to the decrease in coke formation on the catalyst surface."
[5] "Using DFT calculations, Pidko and van Santen[18] have proposed that the presence of acidic protons in the catalyst can promote the regeneration of the active sites on zinc-promoted ZSM-5, leading to an increase in activity for light alkane dehydrogenation."
[6] "Carbon monoxide was detected in the effluent gases."
[7] "The amount of coke after 30 h reaction in the presence of CO2 is 1.0 wt%, lower than that in the absence of CO2 (1.5 wt%)."
[8] "The full recovery of the activity after the air treatment is due to the removal of carbon species deposited on the catalyst."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their structural features and chemical functionalities. Zeolites, especially those with a MFI-type framework structure, are chosen for their high surface area, three-dimensional micropore structure, and resistance to coking. These attributes facilitate the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, promoting the catalytic reaction.

In terms of acidity modification techniques, dealumination and weakening methods are employed to tailor the acidity of zeolite supports. Dealumination reduces the number of Brnsted acid sites by removing Al atoms, which can inhibit unwanted side reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, cracking, and aromatization. This leads to an enhanced propylene yield and improved stability due to reduced coke formation on the catalyst surface. Weakening the acidity further minimizes these side reactions, ensuring a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene.

The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used as a support. For instance, HZSM-5, a common MFI-type zeolite, is known for its effectiveness in propane dehydrogenation processes. Its suitability as a support is influenced by its Brnsted acidity, which can be modified through dealumination or weakening methods to optimize catalytic performance. The goal is to achieve a balance that maximizes propylene yield while maintaining high stability over multiple reaction cycles.

The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture also plays a significant role in the catalytic performance. CO2 can act as a mild oxidant, promoting the dehydrogenation reaction and suppressing coke formation. This is beneficial for maintaining catalyst stability and enhancing the efficiency of the conversion process.

Regeneration efforts are made to restore the activity of the catalyst after prolonged use. This typically involves removing carbon species deposited on the catalyst surface through treatments like air regeneration, allowing for the full recovery of activity and prolonging the catalyst's lifespan.

分析用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的沸石支持材料的特性涉及理解它们的结构特性和化学功能。特别是具有MFI型框架结构的沸石因其高表面积、三维微孔结构和抗结焦性而被选为支持材料。这些属性有助于反应物和产物的吸附和脱附，促进催化反应。

在酸度修改技术方面，去铝化和削弱方法被用来调整沸石支持材料的酸度。去铝化通过移除Al原子来减少Brnsted酸中心的数量，从而抑制如聚合、环化、裂解和芳构化等副反应，这导致了更高的丙烯产率和稳定性提高，因为减少了催化剂表面的焦炭形成。进一步减弱酸性可进一步最小化这些副反应，确保更高效的丙烷到丙烯转化。

选择和实施这些策略取决于所使用的特定类型沸石作为支持物。例如，HZSM-5，一种常见的MFI型沸石，已知在丙烷脱氢过程中效果良好。其作为支持物的适用性受其Brnsted酸度的影响，可以通过去铝化或削弱方法进行调整以优化催化性能。目标是在最大化丙烯产率的同时保持高稳定性。

反应混合物中CO2的存在也对催化性能起着重要作用。CO2可以作为温和的氧化剂，促进脱氢反应并抑制焦炭形成。这对于维持催化剂稳定性并增强转化过程效率是有益的。

再生努力旨在恢复催化剂在长时间使用后的活性。这通常涉及到通过空气再生等处理去除催化剂表面沉积的碳物种，允许完全恢复活性并延长催化剂的使用寿命。
