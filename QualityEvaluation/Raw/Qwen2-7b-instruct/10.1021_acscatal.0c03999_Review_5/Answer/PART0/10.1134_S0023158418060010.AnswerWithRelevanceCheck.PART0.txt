          [1] "The catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins."
          [2] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation, which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."
          [3] "An alternative to aluminum oxide can be various silicate carriers,which possess low acidity, developed surface, and porosity, for example, amorphous silica gels [3, 4], or mesoporous materials with a regular structure (MSM, SBA, MSU, etc.) [5-9]."
          [4] "The acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not considered in detail, although acid sites, especially, Lewis sites, are places for the strong adsorption of olefins, which provoke their further polymerization and coke deposition."
          [5] "The properties of the active surface and support under the conditions of dehydrogenation (at a high temperature and in a reducing atmosphere) are poorly understood, and there are almost no works on a comparison between the adsorption characteristics of reaction system components in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 on chromium oxide and gallium oxide catalysts."

          The catalytic systems based on chromium and those containing platinum are the primary industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins. Commercial CrOx/Al2O3 systems suffer from high coke deposition during operation, leading to reduced activity and necessitating cyclic regeneration procedures. Alternatives to aluminum oxide include various silicate carriers, such as amorphous silica gels and mesoporous materials with a regular structure, which exhibit low acidity, developed surface, and porosity. The acidity of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not thoroughly explored, yet acid sites, particularly Lewis sites, are crucial for the strong adsorption of olefins, potentially leading to their polymerization and coke deposition. The understanding of the active surface and support properties under dehydrogenation conditions (high temperature and reducing atmosphere) is limited, and there is a scarcity of comparative studies on the adsorption characteristics of reaction system components in the presence of CO2 when dehydrogenating propane on chromium oxide versus gallium oxide catalysts.

          基于铬的催化系统以及含铂系统的催化剂是轻烷烃脱氢的主要工业催化剂。商业化的CrOx/Al2O3系统在操作过程中表现出较高的焦炭沉积现象，导致活性降低并需要采用循环再生程序。铝氧化物的替代品包括各种硅酸盐载体，如无定形硅胶和具有规则结构的介孔材料（MSM、SBA、MSU等），这些载体具有低酸性、发达表面和孔隙度。GaOx/SiO2和CrOx/SiO2系统的酸性并未得到详细研究，但酸性位点，尤其是Lewis位点，是强烈吸附烯烃的地方，可能导致烯烃进一步聚合和焦炭沉积。在高温和还原气氛下的活性表面和支撑材料的性质理解有限，几乎没有关于在CO2存在下脱氢丙烷时，铬氧化物与镓氧化物催化剂上反应系统组件吸附特性的比较研究。

          [6] "The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."
          [7] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
          [8] "However, in order to increase the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to provide not only the disperse application but also the strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is difficult to perform with the use of a deposition method."
          [9] "The introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."
          [10] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

          Utilizing low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts leads to reduced coke formation and extended effective operational times for catalyst systems containing chromium and gallium. The acid hydroxyls of these supports are vital for forming a dispersed active surface. However, to enhance the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is essential to not only provide a dispersed application but also strongly fix the dispersed particles of the active phase onto the surface of a silicate support, a task that is challenging with traditional deposition methods. During the dehydrogenation of propane, the introduction of CO2 and its mutual displacement with propane and propylene reveal that CO2 functions as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, while it competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the catalyst surface. For chromium systems, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability resulting from the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon CO2 introduction surpasses any negative effects.

          在脱氢催化剂制备中使用低酸性硅酸盐支持物可以减少焦炭形成并延长含有铬和镓的催化剂系统的有效运行时间。这些支持物上的酸羟基对于形成分散的活性表面至关重要。然而，为了提高催化剂的特定活性和稳定性，不仅要提供分散应用，还要在硅酸盐支持物的表面上牢固固定活性相颗粒，这是使用沉积方法难以实现的任务。在脱氢丙烷过程中，引入CO2和其与丙烷和丙烯的相互置换显示，CO2不仅是氢和焦炭的氧化剂，而且它与碳氢化合物竞争吸附在催化剂表面。对于铬系系统，CO2引入后导致焦炭和氢氧化学反应引起的丙烯产量增加和操作稳定性提升，这些正面效果超过了任何负面影响。
