<p>The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane into propene is of increasing interest due to the growing demand for propene, an important raw material for producing polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application.</p>
          <p>Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades. The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism.

[6] "The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."
          [7] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
          [8] "However, in order to increase the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to provide not only the disperse application but also the strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is difficult to perform with the use of a deposition method."
          [9] "The introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."

          [7] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the CsH8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41. Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."

          [9] "The introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."

          [2] "The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, XANES, and EXAFS spectroscopic measurements."
          [3] "Cr-MCM-41 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [4] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content."
          [5] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [6] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [7] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the CsH8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41. Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."

<p>The steaming process resulted in auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI.</p>
          <p>A significantly enhanced stability was achieved over the steaming-treated catalyst, which was possibly attributed to the related Cr3+ oxide species.</p>

[6] "The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area, well-defined pore structure, and tunable acidity."
          [7] "Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, have been explored to optimize catalytic performance."
          [8] "Dealumination involves removing aluminum from the zeolite structure, which can alter its acidity and enhance its selectivity for certain reactions."
          [9] "Weakening methods aim to reduce the strength of acid sites on the zeolite surface, potentially increasing the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions."
          [10] "Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve the type of zeolite, the specific reaction conditions, and the desired product distribution."

[1] "Carbon dioxide is a mild oxidant utilized in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."
          [2] "Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote the dehydrogenation reaction by the reversed water-gas shift reaction over supported Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 catalysts."
          [3] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which results in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, cracking and aromatization."
          [4] "The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts was measured in situ by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the catalysts."
          [5] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst diminishes with raising the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support."
          [6] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is observed over ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst."
          [7] "Results of the influence of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation reaction suggest that there are two roles of CO2: a positive role by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role by blocking the dissociative adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface."
          [8] "The catalytic stability is also improved by the addition of CO2 to the feed gas due to the suppression of coke formation."
