The enhanced reactivity but lower propene selectivity noted in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen compared to nitrogen dioxide can be attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species in the former scenario, which preferentially consume propene. Meanwhile, in propane oxidative dehydrogenation with nitrogen dioxide, less reactive but more selective nucleophilic oxygen ions act as reactants.

The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane into propene is increasingly of interest due to the growing demand for propene, a vital raw material for producing polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts remains poor, causing a dramatic decline in activity over time, which hinders industrial application. Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied extensively. The aromatization reaction proceeds via a bifunctional mechanism, with gallium oxide catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane and Bronsted acid sites facilitating the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6-C9 alkenes. Steaming treatments to remove aluminum from the zeolite increase the Si/Al ratio, adjusting the catalyst's acidity. As steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and amount of catalysts decrease significantly. The decrease in acid amount is not solely due to the loss of acid sites on HZSM-5; the reduction exceeds the total number of acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses. In propane dehydrogenation reactions, the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play dual roles: enhancing catalyst activity by providing an alternative reaction pathway to the slow step and accelerating catalyst deactivation through catalyzing a series of side reactions. Excessive dealumination deteriorates the catalyst, resulting in a decrease in the initial dehydrogenation activity of HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support. The proportion of CO2 involved in each reaction can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 present before and after the reaction.

For all these reactions, several efficient catalyst systems have been developed, and their redox property plays a dominant role in catalytic activity. The actual contribution of heterogeneous catalysis towards the formation of C2H4 is between 75% and 55% across the temperature range of 680 to 720°C. Adding a small percentage of CO2 to the CH4 feed aids in promoting catalyst stability, while excessive addition (over 10%) can inhibit the formation of aromatic products. The presence of a higher tetragonal phase in ZrO2 catalysts enhances EB conversion and styrene selectivity. Incorporating CeO2 as a promoter into ZrO2 catalysts significantly improves catalytic activity, attributed to the increased basicity and oxygen vacancies in the material.

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites suitable for supporting CO2-ODHP catalysts, literature emphasizes their high surface area, large pore volume, and clear microporous structure, which are beneficial for adsorbing and separating reactants and products. Dealumination alters the structure of zeolites, enhancing their acidity. Weakening methods adjust the acidity of zeolites through specific chemical processes. To optimize catalytic performance, it's essential to carefully choose the type of zeolite and apply suitable acid modification techniques. Factors to consider when selecting and implementing these strategies are the type of zeolite, reaction conditions, and desired product yield.

Utilizing low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts leads to reduced coke formation and extended effective operational times for catalyst systems containing chromium and gallium. The acid hydroxyls of these supports are vital for forming a dispersed active surface. However, to enhance the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is essential to not only provide a dispersed application but also strongly fix the dispersed particles of the active phase onto the surface of a silicate support, a task that is challenging with traditional deposition methods. During the dehydrogenation of propane, the introduction of CO2 and its mutual displacement with propane and propylene reveal that CO2 functions as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, while it competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the catalyst surface. For chromium systems, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability resulting from the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon CO2 introduction surpasses any negative effects.

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique features, specifically the uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels they possess, which allow for controlled pore sizes ranging from 2 to 10 nm and high surface areas (around 1000 m/g). This makes them ideal for accommodating and facilitating the reactions of interest. The direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method provides a straightforward approach to preparing these materials. Additionally, the template-ion exchange (TIE) method further enhances their versatility and adaptability. In the context of CO2-ODHP, the use of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating chromium into zeolite structures. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance, with a high selectivity for propene production exceeding 90% and a yield consistently above 15%. The introduction of chromium does not compromise the long-range regularity of the hexagonal arrays of mesopores, maintaining structural integrity up to 1.7 wt% of the chromium content. The conversion of propane increases almost linearly with chromium content, showcasing the critical role of chromium species in the reaction mechanism. The reoxidation process plays a crucial role in regenerating the catalyst, allowing for its reactivation. This cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ coordination states is essential for the dehydrogenation process, highlighting the importance of the redox properties of chromium in the reaction dynamics. These findings underscore the potential of modifying zeolite supports through acidity adjustments, such as dealumination and weakening methods, to optimize catalytic performance. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve understanding the specific requirements of the reaction system, the compatibility of the modification technique with the zeolite structure, and the impact on the catalyst's overall activity and stability.

After undergoing steaming treatment, the catalyst exhibited a notable increase in stability, attributed to the auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI. This modification contributed to optimizing the catalytic performance.

Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied extensively. The aromatization reaction proceeds via a bifunctional mechanism, with gallium oxide catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane and Bronsted acid sites facilitating the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6-C9 alkenes. Steaming treatments to remove aluminum from the zeolite increase the Si/Al ratio, adjusting the catalyst's acidity. As steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and amount of catalysts decrease significantly. The decrease in acid amount is not solely due to the loss of acid sites on HZSM-5; the reduction exceeds the total number of acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses. In propane dehydrogenation reactions, the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play dual roles: enhancing catalyst activity by providing an alternative reaction pathway to the slow step and accelerating catalyst deactivation through catalyzing a series of side reactions. Excessive dealumination deteriorates the catalyst, resulting in a decrease in the initial dehydrogenation activity of HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support. The proportion of CO2 involved in each reaction can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 present before and after the reaction.

For all these reactions, several efficient catalyst systems have been developed, and their redox property plays a dominant role in catalytic activity. The actual contribution of heterogeneous catalysis towards the formation of C2H4 is between 75% and 55% across the temperature range of 680 to 720°C. Adding a small percentage of CO2 to the CH4 feed aids in promoting catalyst stability, while excessive addition (over 10%) can inhibit the formation of aromatic products. The presence of a higher tetragonal phase in ZrO2 catalysts enhances EB conversion and styrene selectivity. Incorporating CeO2 as a promoter into ZrO2 catalysts significantly improves catalytic activity, attributed to the increased basicity and oxygen vacancies in the material.

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites suitable for supporting CO2-ODHP catalysts, literature emphasizes their high surface area, large pore volume, and clear microporous structure, which are beneficial for adsorbing and separating reactants and products. Dealumination alters the structure of zeolites, enhancing their acidity. Weakening methods adjust the acidity of zeolites through specific chemical processes. To optimize catalytic performance, it's essential to carefully choose the type of zeolite and apply suitable acid modification techniques. Factors to consider when selecting and implementing these strategies are the type of zeolite, reaction conditions, and desired product yield.

Utilizing low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts leads to reduced coke formation and extended effective operational times for catalyst systems containing chromium and gallium. The acid hydroxyls of these supports are vital for forming a dispersed active surface. However, to enhance the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is essential to not only provide a dispersed application but also strongly fix the dispersed particles of the active phase onto the surface of a silicate support, a task that is challenging with traditional deposition methods. During the dehydrogenation of propane, the introduction of CO2 and its mutual displacement with propane and propylene reveal that CO2 functions as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, while it competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the catalyst surface. For chromium systems, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability resulting from the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon CO2 introduction surpasses any negative effects.

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique features, specifically the uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels they possess, which allow for controlled pore sizes ranging from 2 to 10 nm and high surface areas (around 1000 m/g). This makes them ideal for accommodating and facilitating the reactions of interest. The direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method provides a straightforward approach to preparing these materials. Additionally, the template-ion exchange (TIE) method further enhances their versatility and adaptability. In the context of CO2-ODHP, the use of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating chromium into zeolite structures. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance, with a high selectivity for propene production exceeding 90% and a yield consistently above 15%. The introduction of chromium does not compromise the long-range regularity of the hexagonal arrays of mesopores, maintaining structural integrity up to 1.7 wt% of the chromium content. The conversion of propane increases almost linearly with chromium content, showcasing the critical role of chromium species in the reaction mechanism. The reoxidation process plays a crucial role in regenerating the catalyst, allowing for its reactivation. This cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ coordination states is essential for the dehydrogenation process, highlighting the importance of the redox properties of chromium in the reaction dynamics. These findings underscore the potential of modifying zeolite supports through acidity adjustments, such as dealumination and weakening methods, to optimize catalytic performance. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve understanding the specific requirements of the reaction system, the compatibility of the modification technique with the zeolite structure, and the impact on the catalyst's overall activity and stability.

After undergoing steaming treatment, the catalyst exhibited a notable increase in stability, attributed to the auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI. This modification contributed to optimizing the catalytic performance.

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, well-defined pore structure, and tunable acidity. Various techniques, including dealumination and weakening, are used to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination modifies the zeolite structure by removing aluminum, affecting its acidity and enhancing its selectivity for specific reactions. Weakening methods aim to decrease the strength of acid sites on the zeolite surface, potentially improving catalyst stability under reaction conditions. Key factors in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, specific reaction conditions, and desired product distribution.

1. Zeolites, particularly high silica HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions and enhance catalytic stability. The mild oxidant nature of CO2 allows it to participate in reactions like the reversed water-gas shift, which can accelerate the formation of dehydrogenation products. The decrease in acidity on the zeolite surface, often achieved through dealumination and weakening methods, leads to a reduction in side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization, thereby improving propene yield and stability.

The enhanced reactivity but lower propene selectivity noted in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen compared to nitrogen dioxide can be attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species in the former scenario, which preferentially consume propene. Meanwhile, in propane oxidative dehydrogenation with nitrogen dioxide, less reactive but more selective nucleophilic oxygen ions act as reactants.
