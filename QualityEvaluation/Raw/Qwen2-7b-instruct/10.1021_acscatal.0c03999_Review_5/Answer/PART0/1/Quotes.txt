<p>Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their role in accommodating and modifying acidity. Zeolites, particularly those with high Si/Al ratios, offer a balance between acidity and stability. Dealumination through steaming treatments enhances the acidity by increasing the Si/Al ratio, which is crucial for catalytic activity. However, excessive dealumination leads to a decrease in acidity, negatively impacting the catalyst's performance.</p>
          <p>Dealumination of the zeolite by steaming treatment increases the Si/Al ratio, adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately.</p>
          <p>As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly.

[1] "The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area, ordered pore structure, and tunable acidity."
          [2] "Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, have been developed to optimize catalytic performance."
          [3] "Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, which can increase the proportion of Lewis acidic sites and enhance the activity of the catalyst."
          [4] "Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve altering the bond strength within the zeolite structure, which can also lead to an increase in acidity."
          [5] "The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites include the type of zeolite, the specific catalyst being used, and the desired reaction conditions."

[1] "HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalyst was also highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2, when the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support was increased."
          [2] "However, the stability of the catalytic reaction is still an unsolved problem,which is fatal for industrial application."
          [3] "Zinc modified HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios (generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes."
          [4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is observed over ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst. Results of the influence of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation reaction suggest that there are two roles of CO2: a positive role by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role by blocking the dissociative adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface."
          [5] "The enhancing effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction can be attributed to the reverse water-gas shift reaction,which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O."
          [6] "This improvement can be attributed to the suppression of coke formation from two aspects: elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction and acceleration of desorption of the dehydrogenation product (propene) from the catalyst surface, which was also reported for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 over supported Ga2O3 catalysts."
          [7] "The initial activity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while the stability and the propene selectivity improve."

[1] "It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance."
          [2] "Mesoporous silica materials provide high surface areas and, hence, the potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites."
          [3] "Furthermore, vanadium sites in tetrahedral oxygen coordination, being the major species on VOx/MCM catalysts with low vanadium loadings, appeared to be less active but more selective than those in octahedral oxygen coordination."
          [4] "As a result, mass transport within the pores does not limit the target reaction ensuring rapid diffusion of propene out of the pore system and, thus, reducing consecutive propene combustion."
          [5] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree."
          [6] "Based on this early work, similar EPR signals observed after oxygen adsorption on prereduced V silicalite [30] and after treatment of VS-1 with aqueous H2O2 [31] were assigned to V O 2 species."
          [7] "For analyzing the reaction of N2O and O2 with tetravalent vanadium, a VAOH species was assumed as initial state, from which hydrogen abstraction by N2O or O2 should lead to a VO3+ vanadyl site and HO or HOO radicals, respectively, as primary intermediates [32]."

[1] "The catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins."
          [2] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation, which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."
          [3] "An alternative to aluminum oxide can be various silicate carriers,which possess low acidity, developed surface, and porosity, for example, amorphous silica gels [3, 4], or mesoporous materials with a regular structure (MSM, SBA, MSU, etc.) [5-9]."
          [4] "The acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not considered in detail, although acid sites, especially, Lewis sites, are places for the strong adsorption of olefins, which provoke their further polymerization and coke deposition."
          [5] "The properties of the active surface and support under the conditions of dehydrogenation (at a high temperature and in a reducing atmosphere) are poorly understood, and there are almost no works on a comparison between the adsorption characteristics of reaction system components in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 on chromium oxide and gallium oxide catalysts."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method."
          [2] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size from 2 to 10 nm as well as high surface area (ca. 1000 m gâˆ’1), and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."
          [3] "Cr-MCM-41 catalyst was also prepared by the template-ion exchange (TIE) method."
          [4] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 with oxygen, but the selectivity to C3H6 was low and the yield of C3H6 was lower than 5%."
          [5] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [6] "The peak intensities for the Cr-containing MCM-41 samples were not significantly lowered as compared with those for the purely silicious MCM-41, suggesting that the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of chromium up to a content of 1.7 wt%."
          [7] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content."
          [8] "The peak area after the CO2 treatment was 71 % of that in a."
          [9] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

          [3] "An alternative to aluminum oxide can be various silicate carriers,which possess low acidity, developed surface, and porosity, for example, amorphous silica gels [3, 4], or mesoporous materials with a regular structure (MSM, SBA, MSU, etc.) [5-9]."
          [4] "The acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not considered in detail, although acid sites, especially, Lewis sites, are places for the strong adsorption of olefins, which provoke their further polymerization and coke deposition."
          [5] "The properties of the active surface and support under the conditions of dehydrogenation (at a high temperature and in a reducing atmosphere) are poorly understood, and there are almost no works on a comparison between the adsorption characteristics of reaction system components in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 on chromium oxide and gallium oxide catalysts."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method."
          [2] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size from 2 to 10 nm as well as high surface area (ca. 1000 m gâˆ’1), and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."
          [3] "Cr-MCM-41 catalyst was also prepared by the template-ion exchange (TIE) method."
          [4] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 with oxygen, but the selectivity to C3H6 was low and the yield of C3H6 was lower than 5%."
          [5] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [6] "The peak intensities for the Cr-containing MCM-41 samples were not significantly lowered as compared with those for the purely silicious MCM-41, suggesting that the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of chromium up to a content of 1.7 wt%."
          [7] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content."
          [8] "The peak area after the CO2 treatment was 71 % of that in a."
          [9] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

[1] "The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area, ordered pore structure, and tunable acidity."
          [2] "Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, have been developed to optimize catalytic performance."
          [3] "Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, which can increase the proportion of Lewis acidic sites and enhance the activity of the catalyst."
          [4] "Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve altering the bond strength within the zeolite structure, which can also lead to an increase in acidity."

[1] "HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalyst was also highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2, when the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support was increased."
          [2] "However, the stability of the catalytic reaction is still an unsolved problem,which is fatal for industrial application."
          [3] "Zinc modified HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios (generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes."
          [4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is observed over ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst. Results of the influence of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation reaction suggest that there are two roles of CO2: a positive role by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role by blocking the dissociative adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface."
          [5] "The enhancing effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction can be attributed to the reverse water-gas shift reaction,which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O."
          [6] "This improvement can be attributed to the suppression of coke formation from two aspects: elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction and acceleration of desorption of the dehydrogenation product (propene) from the catalyst surface, which was also reported for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 over supported Ga2O3 catalysts."
          [7] "The initial activity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while the stability and the propene selectivity improve."

[1] "It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance."
          [2] "Mesoporous silica materials provide high surface areas and, hence, the potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites."
          [3] "Furthermore, vanadium sites in tetrahedral oxygen coordination, being the major species on VOx/MCM catalysts with low vanadium loadings, appeared to be less active but more selective than those in octahedral oxygen coordination."
          [4] "As a result, mass transport within the pores does not limit the target reaction ensuring rapid diffusion of propene out of the pore system and, thus, reducing consecutive propene combustion."
          [5] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree."
          [6] "Based on this early work, similar EPR signals observed after oxygen adsorption on prereduced V silicalite [30] and after treatment of VS-1 with aqueous H2O2 [31] were assigned to V O 2 species."
          [7] "For analyzing the reaction of N2O and O2 with tetravalent vanadium, a VAOH species was assumed as initial state, from which hydrogen abstraction by N2O or O2 should lead to a VO3+ vanadyl site and HO or HOO radicals, respectively, as primary intermediates [32]."

<p>Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their role in accommodating and modifying acidity. Zeolites, particularly those with high Si/Al ratios, offer a balance between acidity and stability. Dealumination through steaming treatments enhances the acidity by increasing the Si/Al ratio, which is crucial for catalytic activity. However, excessive dealumination leads to a decrease in acidity, negatively impacting the catalyst's performance.</p>
          <p>Dealumination of the zeolite by steaming treatment increases the Si/Al ratio, adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately.</p>
          <p>As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly. Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses.</p>
          <p>Over dealumination deteriorates the catalyst, leading to a decrease in the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support.</p>
          <p>The proportion of CO2 participated in each reaction can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 present before and after reaction.</p>
