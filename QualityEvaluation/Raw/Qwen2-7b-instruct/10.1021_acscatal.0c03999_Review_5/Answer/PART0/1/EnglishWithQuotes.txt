Excessive dealumination deteriorates the catalyst, leading to a decline in the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support.

This makes them ideal for accommodating and facilitating the reactions of interest. The direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method provides a straightforward approach to preparing these materials. Additionally, the template-ion exchange (TIE) method further enhances their versatility and adaptability. In the context of CO2-ODHP, the use of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating chromium into zeolite structures. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance, with a high selectivity for propene production exceeding 90% and a yield consistently above 15%. The introduction of chromium does not compromise the long-range regularity of the hexagonal arrays of mesopores, maintaining structural integrity up to 1.7 wt% of the chromium content. The conversion of propane increases almost linearly with chromium content, showcasing the critical role of chromium species in the reaction mechanism. The reoxidation process plays a crucial role in regenerating the catalyst, allowing for its reactivation. This cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ coordination states is essential for the dehydrogenation process, highlighting the importance of the redox properties of chromium in the reaction dynamics.
