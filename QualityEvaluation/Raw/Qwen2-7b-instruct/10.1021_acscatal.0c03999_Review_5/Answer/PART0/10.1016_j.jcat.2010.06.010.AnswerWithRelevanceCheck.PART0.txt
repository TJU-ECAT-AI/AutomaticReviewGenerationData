          [1] "It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance."
          [2] "Mesoporous silica materials provide high surface areas and, hence, the potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites."
          [3] "Furthermore, vanadium sites in tetrahedral oxygen coordination, being the major species on VOx/MCM catalysts with low vanadium loadings, appeared to be less active but more selective than those in octahedral oxygen coordination."
          [4] "As a result, mass transport within the pores does not limit the target reaction ensuring rapid diffusion of propene out of the pore system and, thus, reducing consecutive propene combustion."
          [5] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree."
          [6] "Based on this early work, similar EPR signals observed after oxygen adsorption on prereduced V silicalite [30] and after treatment of VS-1 with aqueous H2O2 [31] were assigned to V O 2 species."
          [7] "For analyzing the reaction of N2O and O2 with tetravalent vanadium, a VAOH species was assumed as initial state, from which hydrogen abstraction by N2O or O2 should lead to a VO3+ vanadyl site and HO or HOO radicals, respectively, as primary intermediates [32]."

          The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their high surface area, which allows for the dispersion of active sites, and their ability to control the coordination of vanadium species, leading to better selectivity. The tetrahedral coordination of vanadium species in zeolites tends to be less active but more selective than octahedral coordination. Zeolites also facilitate mass transport, enabling efficient diffusion of reactants and products within the catalyst structure. The activity of vanadium sites increases with the agglomerization degree of the catalyst particles. Zeolites can also modify acidity through techniques such as dealumination and weakening, which can optimize catalytic performance depending on the type of zeolite used. These modifications typically involve altering the framework structure of the zeolite to enhance or suppress acidity, thereby affecting the reactivity of the catalyst.

          对于CO2-ODHP催化剂，沸石作为支撑材料的有利性质包括其高比表面积，这有利于活性位点的分散，以及其控制钒物种的配位能力，从而提高选择性。在沸石中的四面体配位的钒物种通常比八面体配位的活性较低但选择性较高。沸石还有助于质量传输，确保反应物和产物在催化剂结构内的有效扩散，减少连续丙烯燃烧。随着催化剂颗粒聚集度的增加，钒位点的活性也会提高。沸石还可以通过去铝化和削弱等技术来修改酸性，这些方法可以根据使用的沸石类型优化催化性能。这些修改通常涉及改变沸石的骨架结构以增强或抑制酸性，从而影响催化剂的活性。

          [1] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
          [2] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
          [3] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O."
          [4] "This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

          The enhanced reactivity but lower propene selectivity noted in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen compared to nitrogen dioxide can be attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species in the former scenario, which preferentially consume propene. Meanwhile, in propane oxidative dehydrogenation with nitrogen dioxide, less reactive but more selective nucleophilic oxygen ions act as reactants.

          在使用氧气进行丙烷的氧化脱氢反应中观察到的较高活性但较低丙烯选择性可以归因于前者的高度反应性亲电氧物种的存在，这些物种优先消耗丙烯。相比之下，在使用氮氧化物进行丙烷氧化脱氢反应时，活性较低但选择性更高的亲核氧离子作为反应物发挥作用。

          [1] "It should be stressed that the concentration of V4+ sites in the as-prepared catalyst was significantly lower than that of V5+."
          [2] "Moreover, the zero-field splitting of V3+ with a total electron spin of S = 1 may be too large for an allowed spin transition to occur."
          [3] "The fact that there is still a small rest of the V4+ signal seen after evacuation at 773 K is an additional hint for the presence of some oligomer- ized VxOy clusters, in which vanadium species are usually octahe- drally coordinated."
          [4] "This signal becomes more pronounced after a short warming to 293 K (spectrum 4 in Fig. 1A), indicating that more reduced vanadium sites have been oxidized."
          [5] "When N2O reacted with reduced VOx species, no EPR-active oxygen radical species were detected."

          The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts are their high surface areas and potential for high dispersion of catalytically active surface sites. Zeolites can provide a large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active catalysts like vanadium oxide (VOx) species. This dispersion ensures rapid diffusion of reactants and products, minimizing consecutive reactions and enhancing the selectivity of the catalyst. Zeolites' mesoporous structure allows for efficient mass transport, which is crucial for catalytic processes. Additionally, the acidity of zeolites can be modified through techniques such as dealumination and weakening to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite framework, which can alter its acidity profile and enhance the selectivity of the catalyst. Weakening involves breaking the bonds within the zeolite framework, which can also affect the acidity and thus the performance of the catalyst. The selection of these strategies depends on the type of zeolite used as a support, as different zeolites may require different modifications to achieve optimal performance.

          用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料，沸石的特性主要是它们的高比表面积和为催化活性表面提供高度分散的能力。沸石可以提供大量的比表面积，这有助于分散如二氧化钒（VOx）这样的催化剂。这种分散确保了反应物和产物的快速扩散，减少了连续反应并提高了催化剂的选择性。沸石的介孔结构允许有效的质量传输，这对于催化过程至关重要。此外，可以通过去铝化和减弱等技术来修改沸石的酸性，以优化催化剂性能。去铝化降低了沸石框架中的铝含量，这可以改变其酸性特征并增强催化剂的选择性。减弱涉及破坏沸石框架内的键，这也可能影响酸性和催化剂的性能。这些策略的选择取决于所使用的沸石类型，因为不同的沸石可能需要不同的修改才能达到最佳性能。
