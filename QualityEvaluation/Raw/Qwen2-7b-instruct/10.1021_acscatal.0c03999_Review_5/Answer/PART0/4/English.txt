At two microwave frequencies (X-band and Q-band) under controlled atmosphere conditions, EPR measurements detected the formation of a Vn+  O (where n equals 4 or 5) radical anion species on the surface of a pre-reduced 2.7% VOx/MCM-41 catalyst after exposure to gas-phase oxygen, and this species was identified through spectral simulations.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP) reaction is renowned for its high energy efficiency. Zeolites have been extensively studied as support materials because of their high surface area and pore structure. Techniques like dealumination and weakening are employed to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination entails removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, affecting its acidity. Weakening methods reduce the strength of acid sites on the zeolite surface. These adjustments are vital for enhancing catalyst selectivity and stability. The selection of zeolite type and the specific modification strategy depends on the reaction conditions and desired product. For example, beta zeolites might benefit more from dealumination, while ZSM-5 could be optimized through weakening.
