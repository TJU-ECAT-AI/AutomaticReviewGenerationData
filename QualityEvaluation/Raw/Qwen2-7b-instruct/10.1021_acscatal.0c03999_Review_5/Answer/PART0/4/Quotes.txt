          [3] "The fact that there is still a small rest of the V4+ signal seen after evacuation at 773 K is an additional hint for the presence of some oligomer- ized VxOy clusters, in which vanadium species are usually octahe- drally coordinated."
          [4] "This signal becomes more pronounced after a short warming to 293 K (spectrum 4 in Fig. 1A), indicating that more reduced vanadium sites have been oxidized."
