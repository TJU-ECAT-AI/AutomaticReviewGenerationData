          [2] "Moreover, the zero-field splitting of V3+ with a total electron spin of S = 1 may be too large for an allowed spin transition to occur."
          [3] "The fact that there is still a small rest of the V4+ signal seen after evacuation at 773 K is an additional hint for the presence of some oligomer- ized VxOy clusters, in which vanadium species are usually octahe- drally coordinated."
          [4] "This signal becomes more pronounced after a short warming to 293 K (spectrum 4 in Fig. 1A), indicating that more reduced vanadium sites have been oxidized."
          [5] "When N2O reacted with reduced VOx species, no EPR-active oxygen radical species were detected."

[1] "Zeolites have been widely recognized as highly efficient supports for catalysts due to their well-defined pore structures, high surface area, and unique acidity."
          [2] "Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening, are applied to tailor the acidity of zeolite supports to optimize catalytic performance."
          [3] "Dealumination involves removing Al atoms from zeolite structures, leading to increased Lewis acid sites which can enhance propylene formation during CO2-ODHP reactions."
          [4] "Weakening methods, on the other hand, aim to reduce the strength of acidic sites within zeolites, potentially improving the selectivity towards propylene."
          [5] "The selection of appropriate zeolite type and implementation of acidity modification strategies depends on factors such as the specific reaction conditions and desired product distribution."
