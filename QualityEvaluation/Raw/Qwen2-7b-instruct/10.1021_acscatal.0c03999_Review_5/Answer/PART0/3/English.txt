The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts are their high surface areas and potential for high dispersion of catalytically active surface sites. Zeolites can provide a large surface area, which facilitates the dispersion of active catalysts like vanadium oxide (VOx) species. This dispersion ensures rapid diffusion of reactants and products, minimizing consecutive reactions and enhancing the selectivity of the catalyst. Zeolites' mesoporous structure allows for efficient mass transport, which is crucial for catalytic processes. Additionally, the acidity of zeolites can be modified through techniques such as dealumination and weakening to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the amount of aluminum in the zeolite framework, which can alter its acidity profile and enhance the selectivity of the catalyst. Weakening involves breaking the bonds within the zeolite framework, which can also affect the acidity and thus the performance of the catalyst. The selection of these strategies depends on the type of zeolite used as a support, as different zeolites may require different modifications to achieve optimal performance.

Zeolites are widely acknowledged as highly effective catalyst supports due to their defined pore structures, high surface area, and distinctive acidity. Different acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, are utilized to customize the acidity of zeolite supports for optimal catalytic performance. Dealumination entails removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite structure, increasing Lewis acid sites that can boost propylene formation in CO2-ODHP reactions. In contrast, weakening methods seek to lower the strength of acidic sites in zeolites, potentially enhancing propylene selectivity. The choice of the appropriate zeolite type and implementation of these strategies is contingent on aspects like specific reaction conditions and desired product distribution.
