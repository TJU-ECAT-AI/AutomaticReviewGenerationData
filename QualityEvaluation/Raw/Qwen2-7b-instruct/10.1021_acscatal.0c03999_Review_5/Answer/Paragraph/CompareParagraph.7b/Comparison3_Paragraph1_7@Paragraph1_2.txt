    "Summary": "Both reviews effectively cover the topic of optimizing zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, presenting a balanced mix of information, analysis, and potential contributions to the field. They share similar strengths and weaknesses, particularly in terms of structure, organization, academic standards, innovation and contribution, methodology assessment, timeliness and cutting-edge nature, and practicality and application value. The slight differences lie in the depth of analysis, clarity of argumentation, and explicitness of proposed solutions, making neither review definitively superior over the other."
