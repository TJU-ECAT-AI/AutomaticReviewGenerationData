Their similarities in content quality, structure, organization, academic standards, innovation and contribution, methodology assessment, timeliness and cutting-edge nature, writing quality, practicality and application value, and critical thinking reflect their high standard of research. However, they slightly differ in the clarity of logical structure, comprehensiveness of information, accuracy of information, and quality of introduction and conclusion, with both achieving nearly identical scores. Due to the close scores across all categories, it is difficult to determine a clear superior review; therefore, both are considered equally excellent."
