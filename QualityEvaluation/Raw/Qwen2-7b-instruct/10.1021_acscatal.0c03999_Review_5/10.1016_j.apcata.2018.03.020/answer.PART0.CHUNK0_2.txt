Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts reveals their high surface area, well-defined pore structure, and tunable acidity. Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, play crucial roles in optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination modifies the zeolite structure by removing aluminum atoms, leading to an increase in acidic sites. Weakening reduces the strength of acid sites, typically by altering the coordination environment of the acidic centers. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve the type of zeolite, the desired level of acidity, and the reaction conditions.
