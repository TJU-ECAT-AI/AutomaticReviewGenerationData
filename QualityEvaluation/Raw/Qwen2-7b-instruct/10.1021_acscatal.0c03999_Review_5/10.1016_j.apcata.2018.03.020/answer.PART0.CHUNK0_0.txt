Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we find that they offer high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and the capability to modulate acidity. Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, have been utilized to enhance catalytic performance. Dealumination increases acidic sites by removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite structure, while weakening methods introduce defects or alter the framework structure to reduce the strength of acid sites. The choice and application of these strategies are contingent upon the specific type of zeolite used as the support material, taking into account factors such as stability, activity, and selectivity.
