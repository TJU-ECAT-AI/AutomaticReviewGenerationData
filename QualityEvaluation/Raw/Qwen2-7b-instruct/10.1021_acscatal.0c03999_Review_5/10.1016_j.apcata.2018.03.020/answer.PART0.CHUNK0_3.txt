[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation process (ODHP) of propane has been widely studied as an alternative to conventional hydrodealkylation processes."
[2] "Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their unique properties such as high surface area, well-defined pore structure, and tunable acidity."
[3] "Different acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, have been investigated to optimize the catalytic performance of zeolite supports."
[4] "Dealumination involves the removal of aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, leading to increased acidity and improved catalytic activity."
[5] "Weakening methods involve altering the bond strength within the zeolite framework, which also contributes to enhanced acidity."
[6] "Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites include the desired level of acidity, the stability of the modified zeolite, and the compatibility with the catalyst loading."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves considering their unique features such as high surface area, well-defined pore structure, and tunable acidity. Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, have been explored to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination increases acidity by removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, while weakening methods alter the bond strength within the framework to enhance acidity further. Key considerations in choosing and applying these strategies for different types of zeolites include the desired level of acidity, the stability of the modified zeolite, and its compatibility with the catalyst loading.

分析为什么沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的有希望的材料，需要考虑它们的独特特性，如高比表面积、精确的孔结构和可调酸度。不同的酸性改性技术，包括去铝化和弱化方法，已被研究以优化催化性能。去铝化通过从沸石骨架中移除铝原子来增加酸度，而弱化方法则通过改变骨架内的键强度来增强酸度。选择和应用这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括所需的酸度水平、修改后的沸石稳定性以及与负载催化剂的兼容性。
