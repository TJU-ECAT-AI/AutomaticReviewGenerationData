Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts reveals their unique features such as high surface area and pore volume, crucial for efficient reactant adsorption and diffusion. Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, have been utilized to enhance catalytic performance. Dealumination increases acidity by removing aluminum atoms, while weakening methods aim to improve selectivity by reducing the strength of acid sites. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, its initial acidity, and the desired product distribution.
