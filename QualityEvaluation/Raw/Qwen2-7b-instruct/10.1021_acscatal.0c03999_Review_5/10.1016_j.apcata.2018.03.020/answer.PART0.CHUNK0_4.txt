[1] "The use of zeolites as supports for CO2-ODHP catalysts offers several advantages due to their unique properties."
[2] "These properties include high surface area, pore structure, and the ability to tune acidity through various modification techniques."
[3] "Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, are crucial in optimizing catalytic performance."
[4] "Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework, which can lead to increased acidity and improved selectivity."
[5] "Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve reducing the strength of acid sites within the zeolite, potentially enhancing stability."
[6] "Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the type of zeolite used, aiming for a balance between acidity and stability."
