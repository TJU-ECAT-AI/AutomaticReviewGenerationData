The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their porous structures which match the requirements of target reactions and provide suitable accessibility for guest molecules. Zeolites have been widely used in oil refining and petrochemical processes such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), aromatics conversion, and olefin production. The rational design and regulation of the pore structure play a significant role in the conversion of raw materials and the distribution of final products in FCC processes. Zeolites like zeolite Y, which have unique pore architectures, have been introduced into processes like FCC to enhance catalytic efficiency. As the demand for sustainability and environmental protection increases, efforts to improve the efficiency of current industrial processes or develop new techniques for creating new (petro)-chemical processes have intensified. The unique pore architectures of zeolites provide a perfect match with the requirements of target reactions and ensure a suitable accessibility of active sites for guest molecules. The construction of proper pore architectures, especially hierarchical structures, is particularly attractive for meeting the higher requirements of zeo-catalysts in terms of plentiful feedstocks and novel reactions.

<p>With the increasing demand for sustainability and environmental protection, many engineers and scientists have devoted themselves to improve the efficiency of current industrial processes or explore new techniques for developing new (petro)- chemical processes. However, two major challenges still remain in zeo-catalyzed processes:1924 (1) the necessity to develop new processes and catalysts for poor-quality or alternative raw materials, for example, the production of light olefins from coal or biomass instead of a conventional oil route has attracted much attention in the past two decades;25 although an indirect method from synthesis gas (syngas) to light olefins is now on its way to being commercialized, a direct process is highly desirable. And (2) the demand for maximizing the efficiency and reducing the energy consumption in currently available technology.</p>

The two major challenges in zeo-catalyzed processes are:
1. Developing new processes and catalysts for alternative raw materials, specifically focusing on converting coal or biomass to light olefins, aiming for a direct process instead of conventional routes.
2. Maximizing efficiency and minimizing energy consumption in existing technologies.

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique pore architectures and the accessibility of their active sites. Zeolites have been pivotal in catalytic processes due to their versatile porous features. Their suitability for specific reactions stems from their pore structures providing a match for reactant and product sizes. The accessibility of active sites for guest molecules is crucial for catalytic efficiency. To enhance their performance in various applications, especially for abundant feedstocks and novel reactions, the construction of proper pore architectures, particularly hierarchical ones, is highly desirable. This approach allows for optimized mass transfer and enhanced reactivity.

[1] "Zeolites have become the most attractive catalysts for the selective conversion of aromatics,such as p-xylene production through xylene isomerization and alkylbenzene preparation via benzene alkylation."
[2] "An enhanced efficiency of catalysts is achieved via lowering of the diffusion limitation of the reactant/product but maintaining the shape-selectivity of the intrinsic microporosity of the zeolite."
[3] "For large-pore zeolites with bigger void spaces or wider pore sizes, the isomerization would undergo a bimolecular mechanism and require disproportionation and transalkylation involving tri- and tetramethyl- ated diphenylmethane (3mDPM and 4mDPM) derivatives as reaction intermediates."
[4] "The diffusion of large inter- mediates and the selective formation of ethylbenzene, but inhibited the generation of multinuclear aromatic hydrocarbons for coke formation."
[5] "The sizes of the main hydrocarbon pool intermediates for the MTO process are suggested to be between 5.7 and 6.0 Å."
[6] "By using 12C-/13C-methanol switching technology, Liu et al. comparatively studied MTO conversion over ZSM-5, ZSM-22 and SAPO-34.163"

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts are their microporous structures which facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, and their shape-selectivity that allows for efficient conversion of aromatics. Techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods modify the acidity of zeolites. Dealumination creates a pseudo three-dimensional pore network that slows down coking rates, while weakening methods adjust the strength of the acid sites. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the reactions. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve the type of zeolite, its pore size, and the specific reaction conditions. Different types of zeolites require tailored approaches to achieve optimal catalytic activity and stability.
