<p>With the increasing demand for sustainability and environmental protection, many engineers and scientists have devoted themselves to improve the efficiency of current industrial processes or explore new techniques for developing new (petro)- chemical processes. However, two major challenges still remain in zeo-catalyzed processes:1924 (1) the necessity to develop new processes and catalysts for poor-quality or alternative raw materials, for example, the production of light olefins from coal or biomass instead of a conventional oil route has attracted much attention in the past two decades;25 although an indirect method from synthesis gas (syngas) to light olefins is now on its way to being commercialized, a direct process is highly desirable. And (2) the demand for maximizing the efficiency and reducing the energy consumption in currently available technology.</p>

The two major challenges in zeo-catalyzed processes are:
1. Developing new processes and catalysts for alternative raw materials, specifically focusing on converting coal or biomass to light olefins, aiming for a direct process instead of conventional routes.
2. Maximizing efficiency and minimizing energy consumption in existing technologies.

泽催化剂过程面临的两大挑战是：
1. 开发用于替代原材料的新工艺和催化剂，特别是将煤炭或生物质转化为轻烯烃，目标是实现直接过程而不是传统路线。
2. 在现有技术中最大化效率并减少能耗。
