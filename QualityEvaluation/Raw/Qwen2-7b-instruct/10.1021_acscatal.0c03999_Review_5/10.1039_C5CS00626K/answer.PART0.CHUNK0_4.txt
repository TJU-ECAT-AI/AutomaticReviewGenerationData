[1] "Zeolites have found widespread applications and have proved to be substantial and paradigmatic in oil refining and petrochemical processes, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), aromatics conversion and olefin production."
[2] "The construction of pore systems in zeo-catalysts, especially multi-modal pore structures, has a great impact on the development of these processes. An enhanced efficiency of catalysts is achieved via lowering of the diffusion limitation of the reactant/product but maintaining the shape-selectivity of the intrinsic microporosity of the zeolite."
[3] "The rational design and regulation of the pore structure is of significance in determining the conversion of the raw material and the distribution of the final products in the FCC process."
[4] "Many studies have been conducted for the development of this process. It was found that for uni-micropore systems, the zeolites with a medium size gave a notably higher conversion and higher yield than any of those with a large pore size."
[5] "An intergrown structure of ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 zeolites with special reaction space of multi-micropores was synthesized by Mobil. This mechani- cally bi-micropore structure favored the diffusion of large intermediates and the selective formation of ethylbenzene, but inhibited the generation of multinuclear aromatic hydrocarbons for coke formation."

1.Zeolites are widely used in oil refining and petrochemical processes, including fluid catalytic cracking, aromatics conversion, and olefin production. Their pore structure, particularly multi-modal pore systems, significantly influences the development of these processes by improving efficiency through minimizing diffusion limitations while preserving shape-selectivity.

2.Rational pore system design is crucial for determining the conversion of raw materials and the distribution of final products in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes. Multi-modal pore structures can enhance catalyst performance.

3.For uniform micropore systems, zeolites with medium-sized pores typically provide higher conversion and yield compared to those with larger pores.

4.Mobil synthesized an intergrown structure of ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 zeolites. This bi-modal pore structure facilitates the diffusion of large intermediates and promotes the selective formation of ethylbenzene while inhibiting coke formation.

1.沸石在石油精炼和石油化工过程中有广泛的应用，包括流化催化裂化、芳烃转化和轻烯烃生产。它们的孔结构，尤其是多模孔系统，在很大程度上影响了这些过程的发展，通过减少反应物/产物的扩散限制并保持沸石微孔内在形状选择性来提高效率。

2.合理设计和调节孔结构对于确定FCC过程中的原料转化和最终产品分布至关重要。多模孔结构可以增强催化剂性能。

3.对于单模微孔系统，具有中等孔径的沸石通常比大型孔径的沸石提供更高的转化率和产量。

4.美孚合成了一种由ZSM-5和ZSM-11沸石组成的复合结构。这种双模孔结构有利于大中间体的扩散，并促进乙苯的择形生成，同时抑制焦炭形成。
