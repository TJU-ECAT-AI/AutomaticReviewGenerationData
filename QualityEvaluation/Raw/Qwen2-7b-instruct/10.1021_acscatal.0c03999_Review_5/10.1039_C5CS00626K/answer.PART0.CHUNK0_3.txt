[1] "Zeolites have become the most attractive catalysts for the selective conversion of aromatics,such as p-xylene production through xylene isomerization and alkylbenzene preparation via benzene alkylation."
[2] "An enhanced efficiency of catalysts is achieved via lowering of the diffusion limitation of the reactant/product but maintaining the shape-selectivity of the intrinsic microporosity of the zeolite."
[3] "For large-pore zeolites with bigger void spaces or wider pore sizes, the isomerization would undergo a bimolecular mechanism and require disproportionation and transalkylation involving tri- and tetramethyl- ated diphenylmethane (3mDPM and 4mDPM) derivatives as reaction intermediates."
[4] "The diffusion of large inter- mediates and the selective formation of ethylbenzene, but inhibited the generation of multinuclear aromatic hydrocarbons for coke formation."
[5] "The sizes of the main hydrocarbon pool intermediates for the MTO process are suggested to be between 5.7 and 6.0 Å."
[6] "By using 12C-/13C-methanol switching technology, Liu et al. comparatively studied MTO conversion over ZSM-5, ZSM-22 and SAPO-34.163"

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts are their microporous structures which facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, and their shape-selectivity that allows for efficient conversion of aromatics. Techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods modify the acidity of zeolites. Dealumination creates a pseudo three-dimensional pore network that slows down coking rates, while weakening methods adjust the strength of the acid sites. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the reactions. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve the type of zeolite, its pore size, and the specific reaction conditions. Different types of zeolites require tailored approaches to achieve optimal catalytic activity and stability.

CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料，如沸石的特性在于它们的微孔结构，这有助于反应物和产物的扩散，并且其形状选择性允许高效地转化芳香族化合物。技术如去铝化和减弱方法调整了沸石的酸性。去铝化创建了一个伪三维孔网络，减慢了焦炭形成速率，而减弱方法调整了酸位的强度。这些修改通过增强反应的选择性和效率来优化催化性能。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括沸石的类型、孔径大小以及特定的反应条件。不同类型的沸石需要定制的方法以实现最佳的催化活性和稳定性。
