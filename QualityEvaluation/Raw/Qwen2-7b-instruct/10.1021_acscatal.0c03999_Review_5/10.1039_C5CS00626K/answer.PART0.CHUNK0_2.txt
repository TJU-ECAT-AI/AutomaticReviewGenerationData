Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique pore architectures and the accessibility of their active sites. Zeolites have been pivotal in catalytic processes due to their versatile porous features. Their suitability for specific reactions stems from their pore structures providing a match for reactant and product sizes. The accessibility of active sites for guest molecules is crucial for catalytic efficiency. To enhance their performance in various applications, especially for abundant feedstocks and novel reactions, the construction of proper pore architectures, particularly hierarchical ones, is highly desirable. This approach allows for optimized mass transfer and enhanced reactivity.
