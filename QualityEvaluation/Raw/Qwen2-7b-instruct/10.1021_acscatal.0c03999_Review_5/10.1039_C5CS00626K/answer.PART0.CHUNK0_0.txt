[1] "The petrochemical industry plays a crucial role in the economic growth of our modern society."
[2] "Zeolite catalysts (zeo-catalysts),being famous for their porous features, have found widespread applications and have proved to be substantial and paradigmatic in oil refining and petrochemical processes, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), aromatics conversion and olefin production."
[3] "The development of zeo-catalysts shows that the rational design and regulation of the pore structure is of significance in determining the conversion of the raw material and the distribu- tion of the final products in the FCC process."
[4] "For example, the introduction of zeolite Y into the FCC process greatly increased the catalytic efficiency for fuel production."
[5] "With the increasing demand for sustainability and environ- mental protection, many engineers and scientists have devoted themselves to improve the efficiency of current industrial processes or explore new techniques for developing new (petro)- chemical processes."
[6] "The most prob- able reason could be due to their unique pore architectures that provide a perfect match with the requirement of target reactions, and their possessing a suitable accessibility of active sites for guest molecules."
[7] "To fit in with the higher requirements of zeo-catalysts for plentiful feed stocks and novel reactions, explorations on the construction of proper pore architectures and their effects, especially those of hierarchical structures, are particularly attractive."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their porous structures which match the requirements of target reactions and provide suitable accessibility for guest molecules. Zeolites have been widely used in oil refining and petrochemical processes such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), aromatics conversion, and olefin production. The rational design and regulation of the pore structure play a significant role in the conversion of raw materials and the distribution of final products in FCC processes. Zeolites like zeolite Y, which have unique pore architectures, have been introduced into processes like FCC to enhance catalytic efficiency. As the demand for sustainability and environmental protection increases, efforts to improve the efficiency of current industrial processes or develop new techniques for creating new (petro)-chemical processes have intensified. The unique pore architectures of zeolites provide a perfect match with the requirements of target reactions and ensure a suitable accessibility of active sites for guest molecules. The construction of proper pore architectures, especially hierarchical structures, is particularly attractive for meeting the higher requirements of zeo-catalysts in terms of plentiful feedstocks and novel reactions.
