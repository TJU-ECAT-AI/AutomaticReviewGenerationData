[1] "It is clear that the ADAM/CHA-cage pair has a highly favorable host/guest interaction. This is evidenced from molecular modeling, the large conditional flexibility (F, OH, IZC, ...) and the high structural specificity, certainly when compared to, e.g., tetra-alkylated ammonium or piperidinium-based OSDAs."

[2] "Given the clear structural links between KFI, RHO, and LTA, based on the large cage and with KFI being a member of the d6r-only family, the synthesis of KFI presents an interesting case."

[3] "The abundance of 6MR in the structure could matter in the IZC conversion routes starting from FAU but is yet to be proven."

[4] "The best OSDA for making these zeolites over the broadest Al-content range is the methyl-quinuclidinium cation."

1. The ADAM/CHA-cage pair exhibits a highly favorable host/guest interaction, as demonstrated through molecular modeling, large conditional flexibility, and high structural specificity compared to other OSDAs like tetra-alkylated ammonium or piperidinium-based ones.

2. The synthesis of KFI is intriguing due to its structural connections with KFI, RHO, and LTA, particularly given its large cage and membership in the d6r-only family.

3. The presence of 6MRs in the LEV structure may influence its interzeolite conversion routes starting from FAU, although this has yet to be conclusively proven.

4. The methyl-quinuclidinium cation is identified as the optimal OSDA for synthesizing zeolites with a broad range of aluminum contents.

1. ADAM与CHA笼之间的配位对表现出高度有利的主客体相互作用，这通过分子建模、较大的条件灵活性（F、OH、IZC等）和高结构特异性得到证实，与四烷基铵或哌啶基类OSDA相比尤其明显。

2. KFI的合成是一个有趣的研究案例，因为它在大型笼子的基础上与KFI、RHO和LTA之间存在明显的结构联系，并且属于仅由d6r单元组成的家族。

3. LEV结构中的6MR可能影响其从FAU出发的互转化途径，尽管这尚未得到确证。

4. 甲基季戊醇基胺离子被确定为在广泛的铝含量范围内制造这些沸石的最佳OSDA。
