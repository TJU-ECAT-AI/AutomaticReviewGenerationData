[1] "Small-pore zeolites are essential to lean-burn diesel engine exhaust cleaning catalyst technology. Cu-SSZ-13 is already commercial, and its performance is linked to its excellent stability under hydrothermal conditions."
[2] "Detailed studies to understand the full mechanistic aspects and catalytic cycle of this system are still published regularly."
[3] "The discovery of the SSZ-13 zeolite (4) thus led to great progress in exhaust cleaning technology."
[4] "The CHA zeolite is however made with ADAM, and this OSDA is quite costly."
[5] "The excellent SCR performance has thus motivated researchers to look for alternative CHA synthesis recipes, and in turn brought great innovation in the synthesis field."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts are their ability to provide a stable, acidic environment that facilitates the conversion of CO2 to methanol. This is achieved through the modification of zeolite acidity, which can be optimized through techniques such as dealumination and weakening. Dealumination reduces the number of Al atoms in the zeolite framework, which increases the number of Brønsted acid sites available for CO2 activation. Weakening methods involve modifying the strength of the acid sites to enhance their reactivity. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the desired level of acidity, and the overall catalytic performance required. The effectiveness of these modifications depends on the specific zeolite structure and the reaction conditions, necessitating careful optimization for each application.

CO2-ODHP催化剂中使用沸石作为支持物的特性在于它们能够提供稳定的酸性环境，从而促进二氧化碳转化为甲醇。这通过修改沸石的酸性来实现，并可以通过去铝化和削弱等技术优化。去铝化减少了沸石框架中的Al原子数量，从而增加了Brønsted酸位点的数量，这些酸位点可用于二氧化碳活化。削弱方法涉及改变酸位点的强度，以增强其反应性。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石类型、所需的酸度水平以及所需的整体催化性能。这些修改的有效性取决于特定的沸石结构和反应条件，因此需要对每个应用进行仔细的优化。
