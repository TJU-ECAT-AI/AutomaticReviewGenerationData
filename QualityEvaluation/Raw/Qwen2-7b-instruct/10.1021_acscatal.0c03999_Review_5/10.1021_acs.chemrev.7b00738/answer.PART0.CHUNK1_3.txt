[1] "It is clear that the ADAM/CHA-cage pair has a highly favorable host/guest interaction. This is evidenced from molecular modeling, the large conditional flexibility (F, OH, IZC, ...) and the high structural specificity, certainly when compared to, e.g., tetra-alkylated ammonium or piperidinium-based OSDAs."

[2] "Based on the charge balance and counting cages, the ideal Si/Al ratio of a defect-free SSZ-13 is 11, assuming one ADAM per cage and no sodium in the synthesis (cfr. AEI)."

[3] "The work of Gounder and coauthors in preparing and characterizing the amount of Al-pairs (potentially of use as divalent cation exchange sites) is instructive. It shows that the random Al-distribution, e.g., entailing 16% of the Al-atoms occurring in pairs for Si/Al = 15, is obtained if the Na/ADAM ratio in the synthesis is fixed at 1 for specific amorphous inorganic sources."

[4] "The authors were able to prepare SSZ-13 particles sizing around 200-300 nm (DLS). The difference with small-crystal SSZ-62 zeolites is thus the more siliceous nature."

[5] "By combining parameter insights, the authors were able to prepare SSZ-13 particles sizing around 200-300 nm (DLS)."

[6] "The systems of study were gels made from fumed silica and aluminum hydroxide with Si/Al at 19, and Na/Si, ADAM/Si, and H2O/Si ratios at 0.2, 0.1, and 44, respectively."

[7] "The use of growth-modifiers and insights into the particle attachment mechanism should be further explored for different Si/Al ratios within CHA (e.g., lower ratios are used in SCR, higher in MTO, viz. sections 3.2 and 3.4) and for other frameworks."

[8] "This latter result is in line with data from the Zones patent that combined ADAM and BTMA to get SSZ-13 from fumed silica and Al2O3, while noticing that the presence of (at least one-seventh) ADAM was unconditional."

[9] "The use of growth-modifiers and insights into the particle attachment mechanism should be further explored for different Si/Al ratios within CHA (e.g., lower ratios are used in SCR, higher in MTO, viz. sections 3.2 and 3.4) and for other frameworks."

[10] "The difference with small-crystal SSZ-62 zeolites is thus the more siliceous nature."

[11] "Evidence for the attachment of larger amorphous precursors to growing crystals was mainly found from atomic force and electron microscopy, where features resembling the former amorphous particles were seen."

[12] "The authors noted that the obtainable Si/Al ratio in the materials was very limited (between 8 and 11) and that only 0.6-1.3 F-anions were incorporated per unit cell (along with 6 quinuclidiniums (ammonium))."

[13] "The best OSDA for making these zeolites over the broadest Al-content range is the methyl-quinuclidinium cation."

[14] "The authors also added methylamine to some synthesis and noted that, in its presence, a part of the OSDA incorporated was in situ formed MeQ (entry 8)."

[15] "The authors rightfully noted that the diquat in this case plays a structurally nonspecific space-filling role, as it is also known to lead to NON, MTW, and MOR in similar inorganic-dominated gels."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their structural characteristics, acidity, and ability to facilitate the chemical reactions required for the oxidation of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons. Zeolites, particularly those with a large surface area and high porosity, are ideal for hosting catalysts that can efficiently convert CO2 into valuable products. The high structural specificity and flexibility, as well as the ability to incorporate various organic additives, contribute significantly to their effectiveness.

Various acidity modification techniques are employed to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination, for instance, reduces the Al content in the zeolite, which can alter the acidity profile and potentially enhance the selectivity of the catalyst towards desired products. Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve adjusting the strength of the acidic sites, which can affect the reaction kinetics and product distribution.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the specific catalyst being hosted, and the desired reaction conditions. Different zeolites may require different treatment methods depending on their inherent properties, such as Si/Al ratio, pore size, and acidity. For example, dealing with aluminosilicate zeolites like SSZ-13 might involve using ADAM or BTMA to stabilize the structure and control the particle size. In contrast, modifying the acidity of LTA zeolites might focus on adjusting the ratio of sodium or other cations to manipulate the Lewis or Brønsted acidity.

These modifications aim to tailor the zeolite properties to enhance the catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability of the overall CO2-ODHP process. Careful consideration of the interplay between zeolite structure, catalyst properties, and reaction parameters is crucial for achieving optimal performance in the conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的特性涉及理解它们的结构特征、酸性以及促进所需化学反应的能力。特别是具有大表面积和高孔隙率的沸石，是有效承载能够高效将二氧化碳转化为有价值的产物的催化剂的理想选择。其高度的结构特异性、灵活性以及能够容纳各种有机添加剂的特性对其实效性贡献巨大。

用于优化催化性能的各种酸性修改技术包括减少铝含量（dealumination）和减弱酸性（weakening）。减少铝含量可以改变酸性轮廓并可能提高催化剂对目标产物的选择性。相反，减弱方法涉及调整酸性位点的强度，这可能会影响反应动力学和产物分布。

在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括使用的沸石类型、所承载的催化剂以及期望的反应条件。不同的沸石可能需要根据其固有性质（如硅铝比、孔径大小和酸性）采用不同的处理方法。例如，对铝硅酸盐沸石如SSZ-13进行处理时，可能需要使用ADAM或BTMA来稳定结构并控制颗粒尺寸。相比之下，修改LTA沸石的酸性可能侧重于调整钠或其他阳离子的比例以调节路易斯或布隆斯特酸性。

这些修改旨在通过调整沸石属性来增强催化效率、选择性和稳定性，从而优化CO2-ODHP过程。仔细考虑沸石结构、催化剂属性以及反应参数之间的相互作用对于实现CO2转化为碳氢化合物的最佳性能至关重要。
