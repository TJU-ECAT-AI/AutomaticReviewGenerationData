[1] "Zeolites, with their well-defined pore structures and tunable acidity, make them promising candidates for CO2-ODHP catalyst supports."
[2] "Dealumination, a technique that selectively removes aluminum from zeolite structures, can significantly enhance the acidity of the material."
[3] "Weakening methods involve reducing the overall acidity of zeolites, which can prevent the formation of unwanted side-products during the CO2-ODHP reaction."
[4] "Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, the desired level of acidity, and the reaction conditions."
[5] "For example, in the case of CHA zeolites, dealumination might lead to an increased selectivity towards formic acid, while in SSZ-13, it could improve the selectivity for methanol."
[6] "The choice of acidity modification technique should align with the specific requirements of the CO2-ODHP process and the properties of the target catalyst."

1. Zeolites are attractive support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their precise pore architecture and adjustable acidity. Dealumination, which selectively removes aluminum from zeolite structures, can markedly increase the acidity of the material, enhancing its catalytic activity. Conversely, weakening methods that reduce overall acidity can prevent the formation of undesirable byproducts during the reaction. When selecting and applying these strategies, several factors must be considered, including the type of zeolite, the desired level of acidity, and the reaction conditions. For instance, in CHA zeolites, dealumination might boost the selectivity for formic acid, whereas in SSZ-13, it could improve the selectivity for methanol. The selection of the acidity modification technique should match the specific demands of the CO2-ODHP process and the characteristics of the intended catalyst.

1. 硅铝酸盐凭借其明确的孔结构和可调酸性，使其成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的有前景候选物。选择性去除硅铝酸盐结构中的铝（即脱铝）可以显著增强材料的酸性，从而提高其催化活性。相反，减弱方法通过降低整体酸性来防止反应过程中形成不希望的副产品。在选择并实施这些策略时，需要考虑的因素包括所用硅铝酸盐的类型、期望的酸度水平以及反应条件。例如，在CHA硅铝酸盐中，脱铝可能促进对甲酸的选择性，而在SSZ-13中，它可能改善了对甲醇的选择性。选择酸性改性技术应与CO2-ODHP过程的具体需求和目标催化剂的特性相匹配。
