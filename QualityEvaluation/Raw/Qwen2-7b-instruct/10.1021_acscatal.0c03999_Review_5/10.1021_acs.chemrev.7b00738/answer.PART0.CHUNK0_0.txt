[1] "Small-pore zeolites possess pores that are constructed of eight tetrahedral atoms (Si4+ and Al3+), each time linked by a shared oxygen. These eight-member ring pores (8MR) provide small molecules access to the intracrystalline void space, e.g., to NOx during car exhaust cleaning (NOx removal) or to methanol en route to its conversion into light olefins, while restricting larger molecule entrance and departure that is critical to overall catalyst performance."

[2] "Although the field of 8MR zeolite chemistry has expanded in many directions, the progress in synthesis is framework-specific, leaving insights and generalizations difficult to realize."

[3] "The first forays into zeolite synthesis were conducted by geothermal mimicking (Method A, Table 2), in an attempt to simulate the mineralization process found in the Earth's crust."

[4] "The use of organic structure directing agents (OSDAs), especially bulkier per charge than classic alkali cations, revolutionized the synthesis field. Important was the realization that the larger organic cations required less aluminum to be built-in in the zeolite framework (countercharge), thus opening up the possibility of high-silica materials."

[5] "The most siliceous AFX Si/Al (17) was reported using the monoquaternary bis-ADAM-imidazolium linked OSDA (Figure 11), likely due to the lower charge-over-size ratio of this organic."

[6] "Typically, the unit cell of a zeolite contracts with decreasing Al incorporation, due to the larger bond length of AlO vs SiO. The unit cell parameters of Eilertsen's SSZ-13 series with Si/Al ranging from 15133 were measured for both as-made and calcined materials."
