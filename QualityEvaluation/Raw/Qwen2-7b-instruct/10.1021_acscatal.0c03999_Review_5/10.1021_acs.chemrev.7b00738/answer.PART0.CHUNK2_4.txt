The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their ability to provide a stable, well-defined pore structure and high surface area, which can facilitate the reaction pathways for CO2 hydrogenation. Zeolites can be modified to enhance their acidity, which is crucial for the ODHP reaction. Techniques such as dealumination and weakening can be used to adjust the acidity of zeolites. Dealumination, for instance, involves removing Al atoms from the zeolite framework, which can lead to an increase in Brønsted acidity. Weakening techniques aim to reduce the strength of the zeolite framework, making it more susceptible to chemical modification, which can also affect acidity. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite and the desired outcome in terms of acidity and stability. Different types of zeolites, such as MFI, MOR, and BEA, may require different modifications to optimize catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP reactions. For example, MFI zeolites might benefit from dealumination to enhance Brønsted acidity, while MOR zeolites could be weakened to facilitate better interaction with the catalysts. The effectiveness of these modifications depends on factors such as the type of catalyst loaded onto the zeolite, the reaction conditions, and the desired product selectivity.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂，沸石的特性包括提供稳定的孔结构和高比表面积，这可以促进CO2氢化反应途径。可以通过修改来增强沸石的酸性，这对于ODHP反应至关重要。可以使用去铝和减弱等技术来调整沸石的酸性。去铝涉及从沸石骨架中去除Al原子，这可能导致Brønsted酸性的增加。减弱技术旨在降低沸石骨架的强度，使其更容易化学改性，这也会影响酸性。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素取决于特定类型的沸石和期望的结果，即酸性和稳定性。不同类型的沸石，如MFI、MOR和BEA，可能需要不同的修改来优化CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能。例如，MFI沸石可能受益于去铝以增强Brønsted酸性，而MOR沸石可以通过增强与催化剂的相互作用来实现更好的性能。这些修改的有效性取决于催化剂的类型、反应条件和所需产物选择性等因素。
