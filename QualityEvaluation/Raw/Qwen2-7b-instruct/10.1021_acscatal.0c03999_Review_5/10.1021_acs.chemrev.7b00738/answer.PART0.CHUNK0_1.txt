[1] "Small-pore zeolites have received greater attention than large- and medium-pore molecular sieves that have historically dominated the literature. This is primarily due to the commercialization of two major catalytic processes, NOx exhaust removal and methanol conversion to light olefins, that take advantage of the properties of these materials with smaller apertures."
[2] "Small-pore zeolites possess pores that are constructed of eight tetrahedral atoms (Si4+ and Al3+), each time linked by a shared oxygen These eight-member ring pores (8MR) provide small molecules access to the intracrystalline void space, e.g., to NOx during car exhaust cleaning (NOx removal) or to methanol en route to its conversion into light olefins, while restricting larger molecule entrance and departure that is critical to overall catalyst performance."
[3] "Although the AEI zeolite can thus be made with a different range of organics (Table 4, Zones patent), the inorganic conditions are thought to predominate over the organic/inorganic interactions. Zones noted this, because these zeolites are formed in the presence of high OH contents (i.e., 0.7 OH/Si)."
[4] "Given the d6r-only feature of AFX and the fact that the CHA zeolite, with structural similarity, can be made over the full range of Si/Al ratios, there does not appear to be a thermodynamically-induced lower limit to Al-incorporation. An all silica version of AFX should thus be able to form."

Analyzing the properties of zeolites for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique pore structures and chemical functionalities. Small-pore zeolites, particularly those with eight-membered ring (8MR) structures, are promising due to their ability to selectively control the passage of molecules through their confined spaces. This feature is crucial for catalytic processes, especially in exhaust cleaning and the conversion of methanol to light olefins, where the 8MR zeolites' small apertures allow for efficient molecule capture and transformation without allowing larger molecules to pass through.

In the synthesis of zeolites, the organic/inorganic interactions play a significant role. High hydroxide content in the synthesis medium facilitates the formation of zeolites with even-membered rings (such as 8MR) by solubilizing aluminum and promoting cage formation. However, the inorganic conditions, including the choice of precursor materials and the balance of silica and alumina ratios, often dominate over the organic components in determining the final structure and properties of the zeolite.

For the 8MR zeolite AEI, the synthesis involves a range of organics, particularly piperidinium-based compounds, with the high hydroxide content in the gel promoting the formation of cages and even-membered rings. The organic sensitivity in the synthesis process, as noted by Zones, suggests that the relative proportions of the organic/inorganic components can affect the product's characteristics, including its Si/Al ratio.

Regarding the AFX zeolite, which shares structural similarities with CHA but has a broader range of Si/Al ratios that can be achieved, the d6r-only feature allows for a more flexible approach to aluminum incorporation. This flexibility suggests that all-silica versions of AFX can potentially be synthesized, offering a broader spectrum of properties for catalytic applications.

Optimizing the catalytic performance of zeolite supports for CO2-ODHP reactions involves considering the acidity, which can be modified through techniques such as dealumination and weakening. These modifications aim to adjust the acidity levels to better facilitate the desired chemical transformations while maintaining the stability of the zeolite structure. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the specific reaction conditions, and the desired outcome of the catalytic process. The effectiveness of these modifications depends on achieving a balance between acidity enhancement and structural integrity to ensure efficient and selective catalysis.

分析用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的沸石性质涉及理解它们独特的孔结构和化学功能。小孔径沸石，特别是具有八个成员环（8MR）结构的沸石，因其能够通过其受限的空间选择性控制分子通过而表现出潜力。这种特性对于催化过程尤为重要，特别是在汽车尾气清洁和甲醇转化为轻烯烃中，8MR沸石的小开口允许有效捕获和转化分子，同时阻止较大分子的进入或离开，这对整体催化剂性能至关重要。

在沸石合成过程中，有机/无机相互作用起着重要作用。高羟基含量的合成介质有助于形成具有偶数成员环（如8MR）的沸石，通过溶解铝并促进笼子形成。然而，在决定最终结构和性质方面，无机条件，包括前体材料的选择和硅与铝的比例平衡，往往比有机成分占据主导地位。

对于AEI沸石的合成，涉及到一系列有机化合物，特别是哌啶基化合物，高羟基含量的凝胶有助于形成笼子和偶数成员环。由Zones指出的有机敏感性表明，有机/无机成分的比例可能会影响产品的特性，包括其Si/Al比率。

对于AFX沸石，它具有与CHA相似的结构但可以实现更广泛的Si/Al比率，由于其d6r-only特征，允许铝的更多灵活性。这种灵活性表明，可以合成全硅版本的AFX，为催化应用提供了更广泛的选择范围。

优化用于CO2-ODHP反应的沸石支持的催化性能涉及考虑酸度，可以通过技术如脱铝和削弱进行调整。这些修改旨在通过调整酸度水平来更好地促进所需化学转化，同时保持沸石结构的稳定性。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石类型、特定反应条件以及期望的催化过程结果。这些修改的有效性取决于在保持结构完整性和高效选择性催化之间的平衡。
