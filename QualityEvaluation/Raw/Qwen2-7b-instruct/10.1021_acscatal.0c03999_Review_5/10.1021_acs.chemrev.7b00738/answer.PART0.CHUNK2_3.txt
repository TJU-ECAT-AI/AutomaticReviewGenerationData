Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we find they possess unique attributes such as high surface area, regular pore structure, and the capability to modulate acidity. Techniques like dealumination and weakening are employed to optimize catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity of the zeolite. Dealumination reduces acidity by removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite structure, while weakening methods destabilize the framework to decrease acidity. The choice of acidity modification strategy depends on the type of zeolite used. For instance, dealumination might be more appropriate for zeolites with high aluminum content, whereas weakening methods could be beneficial for more stable zeolite frameworks. Important considerations involve achieving a balance between acidity and stability, as well as evaluating the potential impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的潜力属性，我们发现它们具有独特的特性，如高比表面积、规则孔结构和调节酸性的能力。调整酸性的方法，如脱铝和削弱，通过调整沸石的酸性来优化催化性能。脱铝通过从沸石结构中去除铝原子来降低酸性，而削弱方法则通过破坏框架稳定性来减少酸性。选择酸性修改策略取决于所用沸石的类型。例如，脱铝可能更适合高铝含量的沸石，而削弱方法可能更适合更稳定的框架。重要考虑因素包括在酸性和稳定性之间取得平衡，以及评估对催化剂活性和选择性的影响。
