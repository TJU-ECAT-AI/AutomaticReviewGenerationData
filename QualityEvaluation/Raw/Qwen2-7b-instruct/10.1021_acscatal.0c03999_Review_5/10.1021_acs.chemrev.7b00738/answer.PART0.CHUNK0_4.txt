The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporous structure, high surface area, and ability to selectively adsorb and react with specific molecules. Zeolites can be modified to optimize catalytic performance through various techniques, such as dealumination and weakening. Dealumination involves removing aluminum from the zeolite structure, which can change its acidity and affect its catalytic activity. This technique is particularly useful for zeolites where aluminum plays a crucial role in their structure. Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve reducing the strength of the zeolite framework, which can also alter its acidity profile. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite and the desired outcome of the catalytic process. For example, for zeolites with high aluminum content, dealumination may be beneficial, whereas for those with lower aluminum content, weakening might be more suitable to enhance their catalytic properties.

小孔径沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有其独特的性质，包括微孔结构、高比表面积以及对特定分子的选择性吸附和反应能力。沸石可以通过多种技术优化其催化性能，例如去铝化和削弱方法。去铝化是指从沸石结构中去除铝，这可以改变其酸度并影响其催化活性。对于在结构中起关键作用的铝含量高的沸石，这种技术特别有用。削弱方法则涉及减弱沸石骨架的强度，这也会影响其酸度特性。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素取决于特定类型的沸石及其催化过程的预期结果。例如，对于铝含量高的沸石，去铝化可能是有益的；而对于铝含量较低的沸石，削弱可能更适合增强其催化性能。
