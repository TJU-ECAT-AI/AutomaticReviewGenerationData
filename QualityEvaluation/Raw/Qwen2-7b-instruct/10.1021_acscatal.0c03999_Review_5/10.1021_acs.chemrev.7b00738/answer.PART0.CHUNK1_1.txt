[1] "The demonstration of control over particle size in CHA syntheses is rather exceptional in the 8MR zeolite literature."
[2] "Lessons learned for CHA could be transferable to zeolites with structural similarity based on 6MR (ABC-6: LEV, ERI, EAB, ...) or d6r (AEI, AFX, KFI, SFW, SAS)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The ability to control particle size in CHA synthesis stands out in the 8MR zeolite field. Insights gained from this process could potentially be applied to other zeolites sharing structural similarities, particularly those with 6MR (such as LEV, ERI, EAB) or d6r (such as AEI, AFX, KFI, SFW, SAS) structures.

[1] "The authors noted a sigmoidal relation between the particle size and synthesis temperature for static conditions, a strange observation, since Arrhenius type behavior is to be expected for crystal growth rate."
[2] "A third interesting series unexpectedly showed that diluting the synthesis mixtures led to increased particle sizes. Normally, the sizes are expected to be smaller because the growth rate depends on the concentration of reagents."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
For static conditions, the authors observed a sigmoidal relationship between particle size and synthesis temperature, an unusual finding considering Arrhenius-type behavior would typically predict a linear relationship for crystal growth rate. A third intriguing series revealed that diluting the synthesis mixtures paradoxically resulted in larger particle sizes, contrary to expectations that growth rates would decrease with lower concentrations of reactants.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在静态条件下，作者观察到粒子大小与合成温度之间存在S形关系，这是一个不寻常的发现，因为Arrhenius类型的行为通常会预测晶体生长速率与温度成线性关系。第三个引人注目的系列揭示了稀释合成混合物会导致更大的粒子尺寸，这与预期的生长速率会随反应物浓度降低而降低相悖。

[1] "Based on these insights, the addition of several growth modifiers was tested. Remarkably, the addition of 1.6 wt % of polyethylenimine (PEIM, Figure 13) resulted in 130 nm large zeolite particles."
[2] "Similar effects were found for hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). In reverse, adding cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) or PDDAC (Figure 13) seemed to decrease nucleation time and enhance crystal growth, leading to crystals of 20 μm in size (with some mesopores), likely by speeding up attachment."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
By incorporating several growth modifiers, notable results were achieved. Specifically, adding 1.6 wt% of polyethylenimine (PEIM) led to the formation of zeolite particles measuring 130 nm in size. Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) exhibited similar outcomes. Conversely, the introduction of cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) or PDDAC accelerated nucleation and crystal growth, producing crystals measuring 20 μm (with some mesopores), presumably by enhancing the attachment process.

[1] "The Corma and Yu groups further explored the merits of CTAB (growth modifier) addition, in a different way: (208)"
[2] "After a classic SSZ-13 synthesis mixture (Si/Al 20, Na/Si 0.2, ADAM/Si 0.2; H2O/Si 44) had been in the oven at 160 C for 1 day, CTAB was added, at a CTAB/Si ratio of 0.12. After 9 more days, this resulted in aggregated SSZ-13, with a bulk Si/Al ratio of 17, sizing in the 50200 nm range."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Corma and Yu groups further investigated the advantages of CTAB addition for growth modification, employing a distinct methodology. Initially, a traditional SSZ-13 synthesis mixture (Si/Al ratio 20, Na/Si ratio 0.2, ADAM/Si ratio 0.2; H2O/Si ratio 44) was heated in an oven at 160°C for 1 day. Subsequently, CTAB was introduced at a CTAB/Si ratio of 0.12. Following an additional 9 days, the resultant product comprised aggregated SSZ-13 with a bulk Si/Al ratio of 17, measuring 50 to 200 nm in size.
