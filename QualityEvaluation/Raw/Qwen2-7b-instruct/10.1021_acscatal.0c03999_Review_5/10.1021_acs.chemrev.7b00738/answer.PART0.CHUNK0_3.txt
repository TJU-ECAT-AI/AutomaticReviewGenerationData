[1] "Small-pore zeolites have received greater attention than large- and medium-pore molecular sieves that have historically dominated the literature."
[2] "These eight-member ring pores (8MR) provide small molecules access to the intracrystalline void space, e.g., to NOx during car exhaust cleaning (NOx removal) or to methanol en route to its conversion into light olefins, while restricting larger molecule entrance and departure that is critical to overall catalyst performance."

[7] "Zeolites with Si/Al ratios higher than 10 are often required for catalytic applications, as they are more stable than their more aluminous counterparts at high temperatures or in steam-rich conditions."
[8] "In synthesis mixtures with Si/Al ratios below 55, the zeolite can now readily be made with the according Si/Al ratio in the material. Above that ratio, the hydroxide syntheses also starts to produce MWW, STT, and AFI-type zeolites."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their small pore size, which allows them to restrict larger molecule entrance and departure while enabling small molecules to access the intracrystalline void space. This property is critical for applications like NOx removal and methanol conversion to light olefins. The forty-four structurally different small-pore zeolites, including the first synthetic zeolite KFI, can be synthesized, and they are often used in catalysis due to their pore size and structure. Zeolites' role as molecular sieves allows them to selectively retain or release molecules based on their size, which is beneficial for catalytic applications. The size of the pores and the presence of cages or larger intersections influence the chemical reactions and catalytic performance within the zeolites. Larger Si/Al ratios in zeolites are preferred for catalytic applications because they enhance stability at high temperatures or in steam-rich conditions. In synthesis mixtures with lower Si/Al ratios, the zeolite can be made with a specific Si/Al ratio, while higher ratios may lead to the formation of other zeolite types like MWW, STT, and AFI.

小孔径沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂载体的特性包括它们的小孔径，这允许它们限制大分子的进入和离开，同时使小分子能够访问晶体内的空腔空间。这一性质对于NOx去除和甲醇转化为轻烯烃的应用至关重要。这44种结构不同的小孔径沸石，包括第一种合成沸石KFI，可以进行合成，并且它们常用于催化应用，因为它们的孔径和结构。沸石作为分子筛的作用使它们能够根据大小选择性地保留或释放分子，这对催化应用有益。孔径的大小以及笼子或更大交集的存在影响沸石内的化学反应和催化性能。更高的Si/Al比在沸石中更优选于催化应用，因为它们在高温或蒸汽丰富的条件下提高了稳定性。在低Si/Al比例的合成混合物中，可以将沸石制成特定的Si/Al比例，而较高的比例可能会导致形成其他沸石类型如MWW、STT和AFI。
