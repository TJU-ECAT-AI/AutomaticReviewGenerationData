[1] "The Si/Al ratios of classic LTA zeolites (<3) are not high enough to ensure a good performance in acid-catalyzed reactions. This is due to the low hydrothermal stability and low hydrophobicity."
[2] "The charge density mismatch approach seems to work well for small pore-zeolite synthesis, since next to LTA, ERI and UFI zeolites can been made that way (Tables 2 and 3: method E)."
[3] "These mixtures stay solutions even after long times at higher temperatures, due to the charge density mismatch between the relatively high Al-content (high charge density potential framework) and the (low charge density) CDM OSDA (ideally tetrapropylammonium or TEA, in mixtures with Si/Al > 10 at OH/Si 0.8)."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their hydrothermal stability and hydrophobicity. The charge density mismatch approach works well for synthesizing small pore zeolites, including LTA, ERI, and UFI zeolites. The mixtures used in this process maintain solubility even at high temperatures due to the charge density mismatch between the high aluminum content and the charged organic structure directing agent (OSDA).

用于CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的沸石特性包括其热稳定性与疏水性。电荷密度不匹配方法适用于合成小孔径沸石，如LTA、ERI和UFI沸石。在高温下使用的混合物保持溶解性，这是由于高铝含量和带电有机结构导向剂（OSDA）之间的电荷密度不匹配。

[1] "Interzeolite conversion is a relatively unexplored route for zeolite synthesis. Many aspects of IZC remain unclear, because the crystalline source material can interact with all constituents of the synthesis mixture in more than one way."
[2] "True IZC, and everything in between, uses lower OH/Si ratios and OSDAs, often to yield surprising results."

Interzeolite conversion is a less researched method for synthesizing zeolites. The interactions between the crystalline source material and the synthesis mixture components can occur in multiple ways, leading to unclear aspects of interzeolite conversion. True interzeolite conversion and related processes typically involve lower OH/Si ratios and OSDAs, often producing unexpected outcomes.

中间沸石转换是沸石合成中较少研究的方法。结晶源材料与合成混合物成分之间的相互作用可能以多种方式发生，导致中间沸石转换的许多方面仍不清楚。真正的中间沸石转换以及相关过程通常涉及较低的OH/Si比和OSDA，经常产生意想不到的结果。

[1] "The impact of topology on SCR activity is highlighted by the study of Cu-SSZ-13, Cu-SSZ-16, Cu-ZSM-5, and Cu-CHA zeolites. The CHA topology showed superior SCR activity and stability compared to the others."
[2] "A novel breakthrough in SCR catalysts was the discovery of LTA zeolites with Si/Al ratios exceeding 11, which retained high SCR activity even after severe hydrothermal aging."

The study of Cu-SSZ-13, Cu-SSZ-16, Cu-ZSM-5, and Cu-CHA zeolites highlights the impact of topology on SCR activity. The CHA topology demonstrated superior SCR activity and stability compared to the other zeolites. A novel breakthrough in SCR catalysts was the discovery of LTA zeolites with Si/Al ratios above 11, which maintained high SCR activity even after severe hydrothermal aging.

通过研究Cu-SSZ-13、Cu-SSZ-16、Cu-ZSM-5和Cu-CHA沸石，突出了拓扑结构对SCR活性的影响。CHA拓扑结构显示出与其他沸石相比更优的SCR活性和稳定性。在SCR催化剂领域的一个新突破是发现Si/Al比率超过11的LTA沸石，即使经过严重的热老化处理，这些沸石仍然保持了高活性。
