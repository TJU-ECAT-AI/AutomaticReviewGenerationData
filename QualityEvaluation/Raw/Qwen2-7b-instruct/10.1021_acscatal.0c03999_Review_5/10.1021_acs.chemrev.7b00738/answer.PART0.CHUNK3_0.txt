3.5.1. Introduction to Zeolite-Catalyzed Methylamine Synthesis

Methylamines are crucial chemicals in many industrial processes. They are not only intermediates for amine-functionalized chemicals (pesticides, solvents, ...) but also have their own uses (water treatment). The Brnsted acid-catalyzed amination of methanol yields a thermodynamically controlled product profile, with trimethylamines (TrMA) being most abundant, followed by dimethylamine (DMA) and monomethylamine (MMA, structures, see Figure 2).

3.5.2. Small-Pore Zeolites for Methylamine Synthesis from Methanol and Ammonia

Generally, the acidic zeolite should hinder (the formation or) escape of TrMA (3.9 × 5.4 × 6.1 Å) from the pores, while still allowing DMA (3.9 × 4.7 × 6.0 Å) and MMA (3.7 × 3.9 × 4.4 Å) to form. (164) Hong et al. tested a range of different small-pore zeolites in identical conditions, i.e., H-form at 400 C. Similar and high conversions were attained for UFI, CHA, AFX, and RHO (Table 11), allowing fair comparison of the selectivities. For LEV, MTF, and DDR, however, lower conversions were found.

Properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their ability to hinder the formation or escape of TrMA, while allowing DMA and MMA to form. Zeolites with small pore sizes are effective at controlling the product profile during the amination of methanol. The acidic zeolite should have a pore size that prevents the formation of TrMA but allows the formation of DMA and MMA. Small-pore zeolites such as UFI, CHA, AFX, and RHO are effective in methylamine synthesis.

Acidity modification techniques used to optimize catalytic performance include dealumination and weakening methods. Dealumination modifies the zeolite by removing aluminum ions, which can weaken the acidity of the zeolite. This can help reduce the formation of unwanted byproducts and improve the selectivity towards DMA and MMA. Weakening methods involve altering the structure of the zeolite to reduce its acidity without completely removing aluminum. This can also improve selectivity by reducing the formation of TrMA. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites include the type of zeolite, the desired product profile, and the specific reaction conditions.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，沸石作为支撑材料的特性包括其能够阻碍三甲胺（TrMA）的形成或逃逸，同时允许二甲胺（DMA）和单甲胺（MMA）的生成。具有小孔径的沸石在甲醇氨化过程中能有效控制产物分布。酸性沸石应具备合适的孔径大小，既能防止TrMA的生成，又能促进DMA和MMA的生成。UFI、CHA、AFX和RHO等小型孔径沸石在甲基胺合成中表现出良好的性能。

酸度调整技术用于优化催化性能，包括脱铝和弱化方法。脱铝通过移除铝离子来修改沸石，从而削弱沸石的酸性。这有助于减少不希望的副产品生成并提高目标产物DMA和MMA的选择性。弱化方法涉及改变沸石结构以降低酸性而不完全移除铝。这也能通过减少TrMA的生成来改善选择性。在为不同类型的沸石选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括沸石类型、期望的产品分布以及特定反应条件。
