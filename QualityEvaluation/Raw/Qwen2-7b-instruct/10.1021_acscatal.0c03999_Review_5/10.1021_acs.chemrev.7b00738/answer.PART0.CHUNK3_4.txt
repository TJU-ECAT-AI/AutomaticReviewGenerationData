Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their high surface area and microporous structure, which are favorable for capturing and converting CO2. Acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, play a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination removes Al3+ ions, altering the acidity and basicity of the zeolite. Weakening methods reduce the strength of acidic sites by increasing the framework density. Balancing acidity and stability is essential for effective catalytic performance. Tailored strategies for acidity modification are necessary for different types of zeolites, considering their unique structures and functionalities.
