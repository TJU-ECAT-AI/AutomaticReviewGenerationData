[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide in the presence or absence of CO2 was studied."
[2] "β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2."
[3] "H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C."
[4] "Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3."
[5] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves considering their acidity, porosity, and surface area. Zeolites can provide a highly porous structure that allows for efficient mass transport and the creation of active sites for reactions. To optimize catalytic performance, acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening can be employed. Dealumination reduces the content of aluminum in the zeolite, which can lead to the formation of more acidic sites. Weakening methods involve altering the framework structure of the zeolite, potentially creating more open sites for reactants to access. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the desired reaction conditions, and the trade-offs between acidity and stability. Different types of zeolites, such as Y, ZSM-5, and MFI, may require tailored approaches based on their unique structures and properties.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的特性涉及考虑其酸性、孔隙率和表面积。沸石可以提供高度多孔的结构，这有利于高效的物质传输和反应活性位点的产生。为了优化催化性能，可以通过改性技术如去铝化和弱化来调整酸性。去铝化减少了沸石中的铝含量，这可能导致形成更多酸性位点。弱化方法涉及改变沸石的骨架结构，可能创造出更多的开放位点，让反应物可以接近。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石类型、期望的反应条件以及酸性和稳定性的权衡。不同类型的沸石，如Y型、ZSM-5型和MFI型，可能需要基于其独特结构和性质的定制方法。
