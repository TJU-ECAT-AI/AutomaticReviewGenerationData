<quotes>
[1] "Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity [1,2]."
[2] "Since carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases, the use of carbon dioxide is attractive not only economically but also ecologically."
[3] "The olefin yield is greatly increased in the presence of CO2."
[4] "Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3. The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."
[5] "The reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 account for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability in the presence of CO2."
[6] "NH3-TPD measurement shows that the surface acid site density of β-Ga2O3 is the highest among all of the polymorphs, which facilitates the conjugated effect of protons and oxide and promotes the reaction."
[7] "The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton is to replace the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4)."
[8] "TPR and XPS results show that about 15 mol% of the fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C, but this part of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after reaction and O2 regeneration."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their ability to enhance catalytic performance through various acidity modification techniques. These techniques include dealumination and weakening methods, which can optimize catalytic performance by altering the acidity and basicity of the zeolite surface.

Dealumination, for instance, involves removing aluminium atoms from the zeolite framework. This can lead to a decrease in the acidity of the zeolite, thereby reducing the risk of unwanted side reactions while maintaining or enhancing the primary desired reaction pathways. This technique is crucial in preserving the zeolite's structural integrity while improving its selectivity for the target product.

Weakening, on the other hand, typically refers to reducing the strength of the zeolite's pore structure, which can affect the diffusion of reactants and products within the zeolite. By weakening the zeolite, one can potentially control the reaction pathways and improve the selectivity towards the desired product, especially in complex catalytic systems involving multiple reaction mechanisms.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites include the type of reaction (e.g., dehydration, oxidation, etc.), the specific requirements for acidity and basicity, and the potential impact on the zeolite's stability and long-term performance. For instance, the choice of dealumination technique (e.g., ion exchange, acid treatment) depends on the zeolite's composition and the desired outcome. Similarly, the degree of weakening must be carefully controlled to avoid detrimental effects on the zeolite's functionality.

Optimizing these modifications requires a deep understanding of the zeolite's structure-reactivity relationship, as well as thorough experimentation to validate the theoretical predictions. The goal is to create a tailored zeolite support that maximizes the catalytic performance for the specific reaction of interest, balancing the need for high activity, selectivity, and stability.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景支持材料的特性，涉及理解它们通过各种酸度修改技术增强催化性能的能力。这些技术包括去铝化和弱化方法，可以通过改变沸石表面的酸度和碱度优化催化性能。

去铝化，例如，涉及从沸石框架中去除铝原子。这可能导致沸石酸度的降低，从而减少非目标副反应的风险，同时维持或增强主要目标反应途径。这种技术对于在保持沸石结构完整性的同时提高选择性至关重要。

另一方面，弱化通常指的是减弱沸石孔结构的强度。这可能会影响反应物和产物在沸石中的扩散。通过减弱沸石，可以有可能控制反应路径并改善目标产品的选择性，特别是在涉及多个反应机制的复杂催化系统中。

选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括反应类型（例如，脱水、氧化等）、特定的酸度和碱度要求以及对沸石稳定性和长期性能的影响。例如，去铝化技术的选择（例如，离子交换、酸处理）取决于沸石的组成和预期结果。同样，削弱的程度必须仔细控制，以避免对沸石功能产生不利影响。

优化这些修改需要深入了解沸石的结构反应关系，并进行彻底实验来验证理论预测。目标是创建一个量身定制的沸石支持，最大限度地提高特定反应的催化性能，平衡高活性、选择性和稳定性的需求。

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves considering their acidity, porosity, and surface area. Zeolites can provide a highly porous structure that allows for efficient mass transport and the creation of active sites for reactions. To optimize catalytic performance, acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening can be employed. Dealumination reduces the content of aluminum in the zeolite, which can lead to the formation of more acidic sites. Weakening methods involve altering the framework structure of the zeolite, potentially creating more open sites for reactants to access. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the desired reaction conditions, and the trade-offs between acidity and stability. Different types of zeolites, such as Y, ZSM-5, and MFI, may require tailored approaches based on their unique structures and properties.
