[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium and iron oxides, in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism."
[2] "Previous studies have shown that the dihydrogen molecule is dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide, leading to the formation of Hand H+ ions."
[3] "The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton is to replace the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4)."
[4] "NH3-TPD studies of the polymorphs of gallium oxide show that acid sites of medium strength are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly β-Ga2O3."
[5] "The low basicity and, consequently, the weak adsorption of CO2 are probably correlated with the low conversion of CO2."
[6] "TPR and XPS results show that about 15 mol% of the fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C, but this part of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after reaction and O2 regeneration."
