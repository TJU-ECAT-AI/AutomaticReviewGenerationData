[1] "Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity, in both the presence and absence of CO2. It is even more active than chromium oxide in the presence of CO2."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."
[3] "The olefin yield is greatly increased in the presence of CO2."
[4] "The olefin yield is greatly increased in the presence of CO2."
[5] "The olefin yield is greatly increased in the presence of CO2."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Dehydrogenation activity of β-Ga2O3 is superior to other polymorphs and chromium oxide in CO2-ODHP reactions. CO2 promotes activity especially above 550°C, enhancing olefin yield significantly in the presence of CO2.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在CO2-ODHP反应中，β-Ga2O3的脱氢化活性优于其他晶相和Cr2O3。CO2特别在高于550°C时促进活性，显著提高在CO2存在的条件下烯烃产率。
