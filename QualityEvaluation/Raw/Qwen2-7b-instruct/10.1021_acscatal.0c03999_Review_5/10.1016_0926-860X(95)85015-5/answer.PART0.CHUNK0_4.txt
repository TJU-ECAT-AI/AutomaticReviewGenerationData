[1] "An attempt to use carbon dioxide as a diluent and oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene was carried out over an activated carbon-supported iron catalyst (Fe 17 wt.-%) at 773-973 K, CO,/ethylbenzene=50-70 mol/mol and W/F= 30-120 g h/mol."

1. The study successfully used carbon dioxide as both a diluent and oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene over an activated carbon-supported iron catalyst. The catalyst was operated at temperatures ranging from 773 to 973 K with a CO2/ethylbenzene ratio of 50-70 mol/mol and a weight-to-flow rate (W/F) of 30-120 g h/mol.

2. The addition of lithium nitrate to the iron catalyst significantly increased its catalytic activity.

3. The maximum styrene yield was 40.45%, with a selectivity greater than 90%, achieved at a lithium to iron ratio of 0.1 to 0.2 mol/mol.

4. The products of the reaction included styrene, carbon monoxide, and water, indicating an oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism.

5. During the treatment of the iron-lithium co-loaded activated carbon catalyst under carbon dioxide at 973 K, added lithium nitrate transformed into lithium ferrite.

6. Lithium ferrite was identified as the active center of the reaction.

7. Table 1 and Table 3 in the document describe experiments using different types of activated carbon supports. 

8. Increasing the iron loading level to 3 mmol on 1 g of carbon led to an increase in ethylbenzene conversion, but the conversion leveled off beyond this point.

9. The higher packing density of the support when using Darco G-60 led to a higher pressure drop compared to granular activated carbon, necessitating a higher W/F ratio for Darco G-60.

10. Ethylbenzene conversion was found to increase with the iron loading level until reaching 3 mmol on 1 g of carbon.

11. The higher pressure drop associated with the use of Darco G-60 was due to its larger packing density.

12. Darco G-60, when used as a support, led to a higher pressure drop compared to granular activated carbon, necessitating adjustments in the W/F ratio.

13. At 773 K, the specific activity of the catalyst was calculated to be 3.7 mol styrene/mol Fe h, exceeding unity, suggesting that iron species were acting catalytically at this temperature.

14. The atomic ratio of lithium to iron in LiFeO2 matched the optimal ratio for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, and the intensities of the diffraction peaks ascribed to lithium ferrite decreased after reacting with ethylbenzene, indicating its critical role in forming active sites.

15. The disappearance of ferrite and magnetite was considered a contributing factor to catalyst deactivation.
