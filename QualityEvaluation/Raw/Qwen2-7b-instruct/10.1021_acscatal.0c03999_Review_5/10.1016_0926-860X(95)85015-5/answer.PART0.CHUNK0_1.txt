Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we find that they are effective in enhancing catalytic performance. Zeolites, with their unique pore structures and acid sites, enable efficient interaction between reactants and catalysts. They can be optimized through various acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods. Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite structure, leading to an increase in acidity and better selectivity for certain reactions. Weakening methods, on the other hand, involve reducing the strength of the acid sites, which can prevent over-oxidation of the catalyst and improve its stability. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the reaction conditions, and the desired product selectivity. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by improving the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts towards specific reactions.

分析用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料——沸石的独特性质，我们发现它们在增强催化性能方面具有很高的潜力。沸石独特的孔隙结构和酸性位点使得反应物与催化剂之间能有效互动。通过各种酸性改性技术，如去铝化和弱化方法，可以优化沸石。去铝化涉及从沸石结构中去除铝原子，这会导致酸性增加和对某些反应更好的选择性。相反，弱化方法则是降低酸性位点的强度，这可以防止催化剂过氧化并提高其稳定性。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石类型、反应条件以及期望的产品选择性。这些修改有助于通过提高催化剂的活性和选择性来优化催化性能，以特定反应为目标。
