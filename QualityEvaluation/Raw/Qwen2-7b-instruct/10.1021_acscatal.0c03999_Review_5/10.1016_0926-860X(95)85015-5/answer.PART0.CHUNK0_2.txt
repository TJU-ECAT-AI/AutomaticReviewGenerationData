[1] "The addition of 20-30 mol-% lithium nitrate to iron resulted in a significant increase in the catalytic activity."
[2] "X-ray diffraction analyses of lithium promoted carbon-supported iron indicated that iron and lithium on the surface of the carbon support were converted into magnetite and lithium ferrite under pretreatment with carbon dioxide at 973 K."
[3] "Since the lithium ferrite phase disappeared in the reaction of ethylbenzene in an argon atmosphere, lithium ferrite is considered to be an active phase of the catalyst."
[4] "The amounts of carbon monoxide and water produced during the reaction agreed well with the amount of styrene. The results indicate a redox cycle a follows: ( 1) lattice oxygen of iron oxide in lithium ferrite abstracts hydrogen from ethylbenzene to give styrene; (2) carbon dioxide oxidizes oxygen defects in the iron oxide phase in lithium ferrite."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their ability to modify acidity through various techniques such as dealumination and weakening. These modifications optimize catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity levels to suit the specific reactions. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve understanding the type of zeolite used, its structure, and how the chosen modification technique affects its surface properties and reactivity. For instance, dealumination can reduce the aluminum content, altering the acid strength and distribution on the zeolite surface. Weakening techniques might involve removing weaker acid sites or enhancing the stability of stronger acid sites, depending on the desired reaction pathway. The effectiveness of these strategies is crucial for achieving high efficiency and selectivity in CO2-ODHP processes.
