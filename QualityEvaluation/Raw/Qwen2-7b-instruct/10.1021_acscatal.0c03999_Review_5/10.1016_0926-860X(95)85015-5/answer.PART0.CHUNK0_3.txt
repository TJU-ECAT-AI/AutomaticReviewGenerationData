The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts are their unique pore structure and high surface area, which can accommodate the active sites of the catalyst. Zeolites also offer good thermal stability and chemical resistance. Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by enhancing the acidity of the zeolite surface, which facilitates the reaction mechanism. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the desired reaction conditions, and the balance between acidity enhancement and stability maintenance. These modifications can significantly improve the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, leading to higher yields of desired products while minimizing unwanted side reactions.
