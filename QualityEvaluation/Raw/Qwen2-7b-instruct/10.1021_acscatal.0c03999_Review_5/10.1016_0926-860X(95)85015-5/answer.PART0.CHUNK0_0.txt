[1] "An attempt to use carbon dioxide as a diluent and oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene was carried out over an activated carbon-supported iron catalyst (Fe 17 wt.-%) at 773-973 K, CO,/ethylbenzene=50-70 mol/mol and W/F= 30-120 g h/mol."

[3] "Added lithium nitrate was converted into lithium ferrite during the treatment of an iron-lithium co-loaded activated carbon catalyst under carbon dioxide at 973 K."

[6] "Since the lithium ferrite phase disappeared in the reaction of ethylbenzene in an argon atmosphere, lithium ferrite is considered to be an active phase of the catalyst."
[7] "The amounts of carbon monoxide and water produced during the reaction agreed well with the amount of styrene."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their structure, stability, and ability to modify acidity. Zeolites offer high surface areas and well-defined pore structures, which facilitate efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants. Their crystalline nature also allows for precise control over the pore size and framework composition, which can be tailored to optimize catalytic activity.

Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by altering the acid strength and distribution within the zeolite. Dealumination reduces the aluminum content in the zeolite framework, leading to increased Lewis acidity and better selectivity for certain reactions. This can enhance the ability of the catalyst to promote the desired chemical transformations while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

Weakening methods involve manipulating the zeolite's structure to weaken its acidic sites, which can reduce deactivation rates and improve long-term stability. By carefully controlling the degree of weakening, one can achieve a balance between strong acid sites necessary for catalysis and weaker sites that prevent excessive sintering and poisoning.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites include the desired reactivity profile, the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.), and the compatibility of the zeolite with the intended catalyst loading. For instance, a zeolite with a high basicity might require a dealumination approach to enhance acidity, while a more stable material might benefit from a weakening technique to maintain structural integrity under harsh operating conditions.

The specific examples provided in the literature demonstrate the successful implementation of these techniques in a CO2-ODHP process, where the addition of lithium nitrate to an iron catalyst supported on activated carbon led to an increase in catalytic activity. X-ray diffraction analyses revealed the formation of lithium ferrite, an active phase that facilitated the redox cycle responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction. This highlights the importance of modifying the acidity of zeolite supports to optimize the performance of catalysts in CO2-ODHP processes.

分析用于CO2-ODHP催化剂支持材料的特性涉及到理解它们的结构、稳定性和酸性修饰能力。沸石提供了高比表面积和明确的孔结构，这有利于反应物的有效吸附和扩散。它们的晶体性质也允许精确控制孔径大小和框架组成，这可以通过优化催化活性来调整。

各种酸性修饰技术，包括去铝化和弱化方法，通过改变沸石中的酸强度和分布来优化催化性能。去铝化减少了沸石框架中的铝含量，导致Lewis酸性增加，选择性更好。这可以增强催化剂促进所需化学转化的能力，同时减少不必要的副反应。

弱化方法涉及调整沸石的结构以削弱其酸性位点，这可以降低失活速率并提高长期稳定性。通过精确控制弱化程度，可以获得平衡强酸位点（对于催化至关重要）和较弱位点（防止过度结块和中毒）的平衡。

在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括期望的反应性轮廓、反应条件（温度、压力等）以及与预期催化剂负载的兼容性。例如，具有高碱性的沸石可能需要去铝化方法来增强酸性，而更稳定的材料可能从弱化技术中受益以保持在苛刻操作条件下结构完整性。

文献中提供的具体示例展示了在CO2-ODHP过程中成功实施这些技术的例子，其中向铁催化剂上添加活性炭的锂盐导致催化活性增加。X射线衍射分析揭示了锂铁氧体的形成，这是催化过程中的活性相，负责促进还原氧化脱氢循环。这突出了在CO2-ODHP过程中优化催化剂性能时调整沸石支撑材料酸性的关键性。
