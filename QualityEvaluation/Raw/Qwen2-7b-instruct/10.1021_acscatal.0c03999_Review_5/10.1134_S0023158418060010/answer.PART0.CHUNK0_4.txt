[1] "The catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins."
[2] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation, which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."
[3] "Another way to increase the efficiency of dehydrogenation of light paraffins is to carry out the process in the presence of oxidizing additives, which remove hydrogen from the reaction and remove coke."
[4] "Studies of the effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reactions of C2C4 paraffins on chromium oxide catalysts are promising lines in the development of these processes because they have shown a positive effect of CO2 on both the activity and the yield of olefins."
[5] "Despite a large number of studies, many questions related to the basic, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction properties of catalysts and carriers and the mechanisms of the reactions remain open questions."
[6] "The acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not considered in detail, although acid sites, especially, Lewis sites, are places for the strong adsorption of olefins, which provoke their further polymerization and coke deposition."
[7] "In the case of the gallium catalysts, the appearance and growth of catalytic activity with temperature was accompanied by the formation of the reduced forms of gallium oxide, the fraction of which was limited under the conditions of dehydrogenation (600C)."
[8] "In the case of the chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."
[9] "In contrast to the chromium oxide systems, a considerable decrease in the conversion of CO2 in the first hour of operation was not observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the gallium oxide catalysts."
[10] "The major portion of the Ga-containing samples were prepared based on the chromatographic Silica gel, which possessed a lower acidity than that of KSKG silica gel."

Analysis of the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, and critical evaluation of various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, involves understanding how these modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include:

1. **Zeolite Properties**: Zeolites offer low acidity, a developed surface, and porosity, which are beneficial for catalytic processes like dehydrogenation. Their microporous structure allows for precise control over reactant and product interactions, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

2. **Acidity Modification Techniques**:
   - **Dealumination**: This technique involves removing aluminum atoms from zeolite structures, leading to an increase in acidity. It can enhance the activity of the catalyst by providing more active sites for reactants to bind and react. However, too much dealumination might compromise the structural integrity of the zeolite, affecting its stability and selectivity.
   - **Weakening**: This involves modifying the zeolite framework to weaken its structure, potentially increasing the accessibility of active sites while maintaining or improving stability. This approach aims to balance the need for high activity with the requirement for robust catalyst performance.

3. **Optimizing Catalytic Performance**:
   - **Acid Sites**: Acid sites, particularly Lewis acid sites, play a crucial role in catalysis by facilitating strong adsorption of olefins. These sites can lead to polymerization and coke deposition, which negatively impacts catalytic activity. Therefore, strategies must be employed to manage the balance between providing enough active sites for desired reactions and minimizing adverse effects like coke formation.

4. **Temperature Dependence**:
   - The formation of reduced gallium oxide species and chromium oxide species with temperature can influence catalytic activity. Understanding how these transformations occur and their impact on catalyst performance is essential for optimizing process conditions.

5. **CO2 Influence**:
   - CO2 can act as both an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke removal and as a competitive adsorbent of hydrocarbons. Its introduction can have both positive and negative effects on catalytic performance, depending on the type of catalyst and the specific conditions.

6. **Support Selection**:
   - Different types of zeolites, such as KSKG and Silica gel, have varying acidity levels and properties. Selecting the appropriate type of zeolite support depends on factors like the desired level of acidity, porosity, and the specific catalytic process requirements.

By carefully considering these aspects and tailoring the acidity modification techniques to the specific needs of the catalytic process, it is possible to optimize the performance of CO2-ODHP catalysts using zeolite supports. This optimization aims to achieve a balance between maximizing catalytic activity, ensuring stability, and maintaining selectivity for the desired products.

分析用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的沸石支持材料的特性，并对诸如去铝化和弱化等酸度修改技术进行批判性评估，涉及到理解这些修改如何优化催化性能。在为不同类型的沸石作为支持物选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括：

1. **沸石特性**：沸石提供低酸度、发达的表面和孔隙率，这对脱氢反应非常有利。它们的微孔结构允许对反应物和产物的精确控制，提高催化效率。

2. **酸度修改技术**：
   - **去铝化**：此技术涉及从沸石结构中去除铝原子，导致酸度增加。这可以通过提供更多活性位点来增强催化剂活性，促进反应物的结合和反应。然而，过度去铝化可能损害沸石的结构完整性，影响其稳定性和选择性。
   - **弱化**：这种方法涉及修改沸石框架以削弱其结构，可能增加活性位点的可访问性，同时保持或改善稳定性。这种策略旨在在需要高活性与维持稳健催化剂性能之间取得平衡。

3. **优化催化性能**：
   - **酸位**：酸位，特别是路易斯酸位，在催化作用中起着关键作用，通过强吸附烯烃促进反应。这些位点可能导致聚合和焦炭沉积，从而负面影响催化活性。因此，必须采取策略来管理足够的活性位点以促进所需反应与减少不利影响之间的平衡。

4. **温度依赖性**：
   - 随着温度升高，镓氧化物物种和铬氧化物物种的形成可以影响催化活性。了解这些转化过程及其对催化剂性能的影响对于优化工艺条件至关重要。

5. **CO2影响**：
   - CO2既可作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，也可作为碳氢化合物的竞争吸附剂。其引入可以在催化剂的不同类型和特定条件下产生正面和负面效应。

6. **支持选择**：
   - 不同类型的沸石，如KSKG和硅胶，具有不同的酸度水平和特性。选择合适的沸石支持物取决于所需的酸度水平、孔隙率以及特定催化过程的要求。

通过仔细考虑这些方面并根据具体需求定制酸度修改技术，有可能优化使用沸石支持的CO2-ODHP催化剂的性能。这一优化旨在实现活性最大化、确保稳定性以及保持目标产品的选择性之间的平衡。
