[1] "The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."
[2] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[3] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their low acidity and developed surface area. Low acidity prevents intense coke deposition, contributing positively to the stability of catalyst operation. Acid hydroxyls of zeolite supports are crucial in forming a disperse active surface. The introduction of CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, and it competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the catalyst surface. This competitive adsorption affects the conversion of propane and the yield of propylene.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，分析让沸石成为有前景支撑材料的特性涉及到它们的低酸性以及发达的比表面积。较低的酸性能够减少焦炭形成，从而增加催化剂的有效运行时间。沸石支持物上的酸羟基在形成分散活性表面中扮演重要角色。二氧化碳作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，并且它与碳氢化合物竞争吸附于催化剂表面。这种竞争性的吸附影响了丙烷的转化率和丙烯的产率。
