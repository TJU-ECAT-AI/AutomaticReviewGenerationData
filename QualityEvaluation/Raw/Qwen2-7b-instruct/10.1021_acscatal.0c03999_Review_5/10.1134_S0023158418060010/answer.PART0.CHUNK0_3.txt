[1] "The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."
[2] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[3] "However, in order to increase the specific activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to provide not only the disperse application but also the strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is difficult to perform with the use of a deposition method."
[4] "Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption."
[5] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves evaluating their low acidity and developed surface and porosity. These features prevent intense coke deposition, positively impacting catalyst stability. The acid hydroxyls of zeolite supports play a crucial role in creating a dispersed active surface. To optimize catalytic performance, strategies like dealumination and weakening can be applied. These modifications enhance the fixation of the active phase, leading to improved specific activity and stability. In the presence of CO2, it acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, preventing olefin adsorption and subsequent polymerization. This reduces propane conversion by inhibiting its adsorption. For chromium systems, CO2's introduction increases propylene yield and operational stability by oxidizing coke and hydrogen, outweighing any negative effects.

分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂载体的沸石材料具有潜力的特性，需要评估其低酸性和高比表面积和孔隙率。这些特征能够减少焦炭沉积，对催化剂操作稳定性产生积极影响。沸石支持物上的酸羟基在形成分散活性表面中起着关键作用。为了优化催化性能，可以采用去铝化和弱化等策略。这些修改提高了活性组分在支撑物表面的固定性，从而提升了特定活性和稳定性。在CO2的存在下，它作为一种氧化剂，对氢和焦炭进行氧化，阻止烯烃吸附及其随后的聚合，减少了丙烷转化，因为阻止了其吸附。对于铬系系统，CO2的引入通过氧化焦炭和氢气增加了丙烯产量，并增强了操作稳定性，这比任何负面影响更为显著。
