[1] "The catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins [1]."
[2] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation [2], which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."
[3] "An alternative to aluminum oxide can be various silicate carriers,which possess low acidity, developed surface, and porosity, for example, amorphous silica gels [3, 4], or mesoporous materials with a regular structure (MSM, SBA, MSU, etc.) [5-9]."
[4] "The acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not considered in detail, although acid sites, especially, Lewis sites, are places for the strong adsorption of olefins, which provoke their further polymerization and coke deposition."
[5] "The properties of the active surface and support under the conditions of dehydrogenation (at a high temperature and in a reducing atmosphere) are poorly understood, and there are almost no works on a comparison between the adsorption characteristics of reaction system components in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 on chromium oxide and gallium oxide catalysts."

To analyze the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we refer to quote [3]. Zeolites are favored due to their low acidity, developed surface, and porosity. These features enable better control over the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, leading to optimized catalytic performance. Specifically, the low acidity minimizes coke deposition, thereby maintaining the catalyst's activity over multiple cycles. The developed surface and porosity enhance the accessibility of reactants and products, promoting efficient catalytic reactions.

Regarding acidity modification techniques, quotes [4] and [5] suggest dealing with the acidity of catalyst supports through methods like dealumination and weakening. Dealumination involves removing aluminum atoms from zeolite structures, reducing the acidity and improving the stability of the support. Weakening methods aim to modify the acidity of the support without completely eliminating it, allowing for a balance between acidity and stability. The selection of these strategies depends on the specific requirements of the catalyst system. For instance, while dealumination might be suitable for reducing acidity in aluminum-based supports, weakening techniques might be more applicable to zeolites with inherent acidity.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used, the desired level of acidity, and the impact on the catalyst's overall activity and selectivity. For example, the choice between dealumination and weakening might depend on whether the goal is to maintain a certain level of acidity for optimal catalytic activity or to reduce acidity to minimize coke formation. Additionally, the effectiveness of these strategies might vary depending on the specific chemical and physical properties of the zeolite material.

In summary, zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their low acidity, developed surface, and porosity. Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, can optimize catalytic performance by balancing acidity and stability. The selection of these strategies requires careful consideration of the zeolite type, desired acidity level, and impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.

为了分析为何沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的有前景选择，我们可以参考引用[3]。沸石因其低酸性、发达表面和孔隙度而受到青睐。这些特性能够更好地控制反应物和产物的吸附与脱附，从而优化催化性能。具体而言，低酸性有助于减少焦炭沉积，从而保持催化剂的活性。发达的表面和孔隙度增强了反应物和产物的可接近性，促进高效的催化反应。

关于酸性修改技术，引用[4]和[5]提到了通过dealumination（去铝）和弱化方法来调整催化剂支撑材料的酸性。去铝化涉及从沸石结构中去除铝原子，降低酸性和提高支撑材料的稳定性。弱化方法旨在调整支撑材料的酸性，而不完全消除它，从而在酸性和稳定性之间找到平衡。在选择这些策略时，需要考虑使用的沸石类型、期望的酸性水平以及对催化剂整体活性和选择性的影响。例如，去铝化可能更适合于降低基于铝的支撑材料的酸性，而弱化方法可能更适合于具有固有酸性的沸石。

选择这些策略的关键考虑因素包括使用的沸石类型、所需的酸性水平以及对催化剂活性和选择性的影响。例如，去铝化和弱化策略的选择可能取决于目标酸性水平是否需要维持以获得最佳催化活性，或者是否需要降低酸性以最小化焦炭形成。此外，这些策略的有效性可能取决于特定的化学和物理性质的沸石材料。

总之，由于其低酸性、发达表面和孔隙度，沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景支撑材料。通过去铝化和弱化等酸性修改技术可以优化催化性能，通过平衡酸性和稳定性。在选择这些策略时，需要仔细考虑沸石类型、期望的酸性水平以及对催化剂活性和选择性的影响。
