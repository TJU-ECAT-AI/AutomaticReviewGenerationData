[1] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
[2] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
[3] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
[4] "The possible reasons for the superior catalytic behavior were discussed."
[5] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
[6] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
[7] "On the other hand, acid sites also catalyze coke formation via side reactions, such as oligomerization and cyclization."
[8] "Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result,and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves considering their ability to provide strong acidity and control the activity-deactivation balance. Zeolites, especially those with high Si/Al ratios, can be modified through dealumination processes, which increases their acidity by removing aluminum species from the framework. This enhances the catalyst's activity by providing more acidic sites for reactions to occur. However, the excessive presence of strong acid sites can lead to side reactions such as oligomerization and cyclization, which accelerates catalyst deactivation. 

To optimize catalytic performance, acidity modification techniques focus on balancing the number of strong acid sites. Techniques like dealumination allow for the adjustment of acidity levels by altering the Si/Al ratio. This helps in controlling the rate-determining steps in the reaction mechanism, particularly the dissociative adsorption of propane and the subsequent decomposition steps. The key consideration in selecting and implementing these strategies depends on the specific requirements of the catalytic process, such as the desired selectivity towards propene and the tolerance for coke formation. For instance, the study found that the catalyst Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) exhibited high stability and optimal propene yield due to its precise balance of acidity and stability, demonstrating the importance of fine-tuning the acidity level for achieving optimal catalytic performance.

分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的沸石的特性，需要考虑它们提供强酸性和控制活性与失活平衡的能力。特别是高Si/Al比的沸石可以通过去铝过程进行修改，通过从框架中去除铝物种来增加其酸性。这通过提供更多的酸性位点来增强催化剂的活性，从而使反应发生。然而，强酸位点的过多存在可能导致副反应如聚合和环化，从而加速催化剂的失活。

为了优化催化性能，酸度修改技术集中在平衡强酸位点的数量上。去铝技术允许通过改变Si/Al比来调整酸度水平。这有助于控制反应机制中的决定性步骤，特别是丙烷的离解吸附及其后续分解步骤的速度。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素取决于催化过程的具体需求，例如期望的丙烯选择性和对焦炭形成的容忍度。例如，研究表明催化剂Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)由于其精确的酸性和稳定性的平衡，表现出高稳定性和最佳丙烯产率，这表明精确调节酸度水平对于实现最优催化性能的重要性。
