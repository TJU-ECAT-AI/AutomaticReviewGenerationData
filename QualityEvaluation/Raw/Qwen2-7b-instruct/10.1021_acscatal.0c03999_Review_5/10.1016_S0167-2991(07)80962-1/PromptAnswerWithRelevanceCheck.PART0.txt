<p>The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane into propene is of increasing interest due to the growing demand for propene, an important raw material for producing polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application.</p>
<p>Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades. The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6-C9 alkenes.</p>
<p>Dealumination of the zeolite by steaming treatment increases the Si/Al ratio, adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately.</p>
<p>On the XRD patterns of the catalysts, no other diffraction peaks except those of the HZSM-5 supports were observed, indicating that gallium oxide is well dispersed on all the supports.</p>
<p>As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly. Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses.</p>
<p>It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions.</p>
<p>Over dealumination deteriorates the catalyst, leading to a decrease in the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support.</p>
<p>The proportion of CO2 participated in each reaction can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 present before and after reaction.</p>

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their role in accommodating and modifying acidity. Zeolites, particularly those with high Si/Al ratios, offer a balance between acidity and stability. Dealumination through steaming treatments enhances the acidity by increasing the Si/Al ratio, which is crucial for catalytic activity. However, excessive dealumination leads to a decrease in acidity, negatively impacting the catalyst's performance. The key considerations involve finding an optimal Si/Al ratio that balances acidity and stability, minimizing the side reactions that occur with high acidity while maintaining sufficient activity for the desired dehydrogenation reaction. The acidity modification techniques aim to fine-tune the catalyst's reactivity and stability, optimizing the catalytic performance for the specific reaction conditions. The role of CO2 in the reaction is also significant, as it affects both the activity and stability of the catalyst. Its impact on the reaction mechanism and the catalyst's performance necessitates careful consideration in the selection and implementation of these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports.

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves considering their ability to provide strong acidity and control the activity-deactivation balance. Zeolites, especially those with high Si/Al ratios, can be modified through dealumination processes, which increases their acidity by removing aluminum species from the framework. This enhances the catalyst's activity by providing more acidic sites for reactions to occur. However, the excessive presence of strong acid sites can lead to side reactions such as oligomerization and cyclization, which accelerates catalyst deactivation. 

To optimize catalytic performance, acidity modification techniques focus on balancing the number of strong acid sites. Techniques like dealumination allow for the adjustment of acidity levels by altering the Si/Al ratio. This helps in controlling the rate-determining steps in the reaction mechanism, particularly the dissociative adsorption of propane and the subsequent decomposition steps. The key consideration in selecting and implementing these strategies depends on the specific requirements of the catalytic process, such as the desired selectivity towards propene and the tolerance for coke formation. For instance, the study found that the catalyst Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) exhibited high stability and optimal propene yield due to its precise balance of acidity and stability, demonstrating the importance of fine-tuning the acidity level for achieving optimal catalytic performance.

分析作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的沸石的特性，需要考虑它们提供强酸性和控制活性与失活平衡的能力。特别是高Si/Al比的沸石可以通过去铝过程进行修改，通过从框架中去除铝物种来增加其酸性。这通过提供更多的酸性位点来增强催化剂的活性，从而使反应发生。然而，强酸位点的过多存在可能导致副反应如聚合和环化，从而加速催化剂的失活。

为了优化催化性能，酸度修改技术集中在平衡强酸位点的数量上。去铝技术允许通过改变Si/Al比来调整酸度水平。这有助于控制反应机制中的决定性步骤，特别是丙烷的离解吸附及其后续分解步骤的速度。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素取决于催化过程的具体需求，例如期望的丙烯选择性和对焦炭形成的容忍度。例如，研究表明催化剂Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)由于其精确的酸性和稳定性的平衡，表现出高稳定性和最佳丙烯产率，这表明精确调节酸度水平对于实现最优催化性能的重要性。

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves considering their ability to modify acidity through various techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity level to achieve an optimal balance between reactivity and stability. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include:

1. **Dealumination**: This technique increases the Si/Al ratio of zeolites, leading to a reduction in the number of Bronsted acid sites, which are crucial for promoting the dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, excessive dealumination can lead to a decrease in the amount of strong acid sites needed for efficient dehydrogenation reactions, potentially compromising catalyst activity. The study found that a high Si/Al ratio in HZSM-5 supports enhanced stability by reducing the concentration of strong acid sites, thereby minimizing side reactions and coke formation.

2. **Weakening Acid Strength**: Dealumination and other treatments can weaken the strength of the acid sites on the zeolite surface, which indirectly affects the rate of side reactions and coke formation. This is particularly beneficial in the context of CO2-ODHP reactions, where the elimination of excess acid sites helps to prevent the catalytic deactivation associated with coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

3. **Support Effect**: Different zeolites exhibit varying H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, which influence their effectiveness as supports for catalysts. These intrinsic properties interact with the metal oxide components, like gallium oxide, to modulate the overall catalytic behavior. The study highlighted that the support effect on the performance of gallium oxide catalysts is influenced by the specific properties of the zeolite used, such as its silica-to-alumina ratio and the resulting impact on the distribution of Bronsted acid sites.

4. **Optimization of Strong Acid Sites**: The amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions. By adjusting the acidity of the catalyst through dealumination and other treatments, the study demonstrated that it is possible to optimize the balance between reactivity and stability, leading to highly active and stable catalysts capable of maintaining high propene yields without deactivation over prolonged reaction periods.

In summary, the use of zeolites as support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts is promising due to their tunable acidity, which can be modified through dealumination and other treatments to optimize the catalytic performance. The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific properties of the zeolite, the desired balance between reactivity and stability, and the goal of maximizing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process while minimizing side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景支持材料的特性涉及考虑它们通过各种技术（如去铝化和削弱方法）调整酸度的能力。这些修改有助于通过调整酸度水平来优化催化性能，从而在反应活性与稳定性之间实现最佳平衡。选择和支持不同类型的沸石作为支持物时的关键考虑因素包括：

1. **去铝化**：这种方法提高了沸石的Si/Al比，导致Bronsted酸位点的数量减少，这对促进烷烃脱氢作用至关重要。然而，过度的去铝化可能导致强酸位点数量的急剧下降，这些位点对于高效脱氢反应至关重要，可能损害催化剂活性。研究表明，高Si/Al比的HZSM-5支持物通过减少强酸位点的浓度增强了稳定性，从而最小化了副反应和催化剂表面焦炭的形成。

2. **减弱酸强度**：去铝化和其他处理可以减弱沸石表面的酸位强度，这间接影响副反应和焦炭形成的速度。这对于CO2-ODHP反应特别有益，消除多余的酸位点有助于预防与催化剂表面焦炭沉积相关的催化剂失活。

3. **支持效果**：不同的沸石具有不同的H2吸附能力和酸碱性质，这些性质影响其作为催化剂支持物的有效性。这些内在性质与金属氧化物成分（如镓氧化物）相互作用，调节整体催化行为。研究表明，沸石支持的镓氧化物催化剂的性能受到所用沸石特定属性的影响，如其硅铝比和由此产生的对Bronsted酸位分布的影响。

4. **强酸位的优化**：催化剂上存在的强酸位数量是实现最优脱氢反应性能的关键。通过调整酸度，如去铝化和其他处理，研究表明，有可能优化反应活性与稳定性的平衡，导致高度活跃且稳定的催化剂能够在长时间内保持高丙烯产率而不会失活。

总之，使用沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支持材料是有前景的，因为它们的可调酸度可以通过去铝化和其他方法进行修改，以优化催化性能。选择和支持策略取决于沸石的具体属性、期望的活性与稳定性平衡以及最大化脱氢过程效率并最小化副反应和催化剂失活的目标。

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their ability to adjust acidity, which is crucial for catalytic performance. Zeolites, especially those with high Si/Al ratios like HZSM-5, offer a means to fine-tune acidity through dealumination, a process that enhances stability and efficiency. This is evidenced by the high catalytic activity and stability observed in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2, particularly when using Ga2O3 supported on HZSM-5. The propene yield stabilized at about 22% without observable deactivation in 100 hours, highlighting the importance of adjusting acidity levels. The acidity of the catalyst plays dual roles in the reaction: enhancing activity by providing alternative pathways and catalyzing side reactions like coke formation, which can lead to deactivation. The optimal balance of strong acid sites on the catalyst surface is thus key to achieving high catalytic performance. In the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700), the right amount of strong acid sites enabled the catalyst to maintain high activity and stability, demonstrating the effectiveness of using zeolites as supports in CO2-ODHP processes.

2.1. "HZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by steaming treatment of HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 60 at temperatures of 600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 oC, respectively."
2.2. "The UV adsorption band at about 240 nm corresponds to the amount of Al-O units of ZSM-5 zeolite while the band located at 320 nm is related to the extraframework oxoaluminum species."
2.3. "Since the results of chemical analysis of HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratios are often ambiguous, DRS spectra of HZSM-5 before and after steaming treatment were taken and shown in Fig. 1."
2.4. "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
2.5. "For all the supported catalysts, the propane conversion drops with reaction time and almost reaches steady state after 30 h."
2.6. "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
2.7. "As shown in Table 1, the amount of coke reduces as the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, and the reduction is more obvious initially."
2.8. "The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 2."
2.9. "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
3.1. "The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."
3.2. "The amount of CO yield in the reaction is always twice as much as the CO2 conversion, indicating that almost all CO is produced via reaction (7) over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) catalyst, so the main role of CO2 here is to eliminate coke formed on catalyst surface."
3.3. "The highest activity after 6 h on stream is obtained at a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 2. Similar results were observed over other oxide supported Ga2O3 catalysts, which was ascribed to the inhibition of propane adsorption on the catalyst by CO2."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding how they influence the acidity and stability of the catalysts. Zeolites, particularly those with high Si/Al ratios, are effective due to their ability to adjust acidity through dealumination processes. Dealumination leads to a higher Si/Al ratio, which weakens the acidity of the zeolite. This modification is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance by balancing the positive role of strong acid sites in enhancing the reaction rate and the negative role in accelerating catalyst deactivation through side reactions.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve choosing the right type of zeolite based on its intrinsic properties, such as adsorption capacity and acid-base characteristics, and determining the optimal steaming temperature for dealumination. This process helps tailor the zeolite to have a suitable level of acidity that promotes the desired reaction while minimizing unwanted side effects. The selection of the zeolite type depends on the specific catalyst being developed and the desired reaction conditions.

CO2 plays a dual role in propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3-supported catalysts. It primarily acts as a reagent for the reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions, helping to eliminate coke formed on the catalyst surface. The CO2 concentration affects the dehydrogenation activity and stability of the catalyst. An optimal CO2/C3H8 ratio of 2 maximizes activity while maintaining stability, as it balances the adsorption of propane and the prevention of coke formation.

In summary, the properties of zeolites as support materials are optimized through strategic dealumination to control acidity, thereby enhancing the efficiency of CO2-ODHP catalysts. The balance between acidity and stability is critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance, and CO2 effectively manages coke formation, contributing to the overall efficiency of the reaction.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂有前景的支撑材料的特性涉及理解它们如何影响催化剂的酸性和稳定性。特别是高Si/Al比的沸石，由于可以通过脱铝过程调整酸性而表现出高效性。脱铝导致更高的Si/Al比，从而减弱沸石的酸性。这种修改对于通过平衡增强反应速率的强酸位的积极作用和加速催化剂降解的副作用的负面影响来优化催化性能至关重要。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括根据沸石的固有属性（如吸附能力和酸碱性质）选择合适的类型，并确定进行脱铝的最佳退火温度。这一过程有助于定制沸石，使其具有适合于促进所需反应的适当水平的酸性，同时尽量减少不必要的副效应。选择的沸石类型取决于正在开发的具体催化剂以及期望的反应条件。

CO2在Ga2O3支持的催化剂上的作用是双重的。它主要作为水煤气逆向反应和布杜瓦德反应的反应物，帮助消除沉积在催化剂表面的焦炭。CO2浓度会影响催化剂的脱氢活性和稳定性。2的CO2/C3H8比例最大化了活性，同时保持了稳定性，因为它平衡了丙烷的吸附和防止焦炭形成。

简而言之，作为支撑材料的沸石的特性通过战略性脱铝来控制酸性，从而增强了CO2-ODHP催化剂的效率。酸性和稳定性的平衡对于实现最佳催化性能至关重要，而CO2有效管理焦炭形成，对整体反应效率做出了贡献。
