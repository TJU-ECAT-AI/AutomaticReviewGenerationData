          <p>Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their role in accommodating and modifying acidity. Zeolites, particularly those with high Si/Al ratios, offer a balance between acidity and stability. Dealumination through steaming treatments enhances the acidity by increasing the Si/Al ratio, which is crucial for catalytic activity. However, excessive dealumination leads to a decrease in acidity, negatively impacting the catalyst's performance.</p>
          <p>Dealumination of the zeolite by steaming treatment increases the Si/Al ratio, adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately.</p>
          <p>As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly. Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses.</p>
          <p>Over dealumination deteriorates the catalyst, leading to a decrease in the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support.</p>
          <p>The proportion of CO2 participated in each reaction can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 present before and after reaction.</p>

          Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their role in accommodating and modifying acidity. Zeolites, particularly those with high Si/Al ratios, offer a balance between acidity and stability. Dealumination through steaming treatments enhances the acidity by increasing the Si/Al ratio, which is crucial for catalytic activity. However, excessive dealumination leads to a decrease in acidity, negatively impacting the catalyst's performance. The steaming process adjusts the acidity of the catalyst by increasing the Si/Al ratio. As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and amount of the catalysts decrease significantly. This decrease is not solely due to the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5; rather, it is greater than the total number of acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses. Excessive dealumination deteriorates the catalyst, leading to a decline in the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support. The proportion of CO2 in each reaction can be estimated by measuring the amounts of CO and CO2 before and after the reaction.

          分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂有前景的支撑材料的特性，涉及理解它们在容纳和调整酸性方面的角色。特别是高Si/Al比的沸石，提供了酸性和稳定性之间的平衡。通过蒸煮处理进行脱铝可以增加Si/Al比，从而增强酸性，这对于催化活性至关重要。然而，过度的脱铝会导致酸性下降，对催化剂性能产生负面影响。蒸煮过程通过增加Si/Al比来调整催化剂的酸性。随着蒸煮温度的升高，催化剂的酸强度和酸量显著降低。这种减少不仅仅是由于HZSM-5上酸性位点的损失；相反，减少的酸性位点数量大于HZSM-5原始具有的总酸性位点数。过度的脱铝会恶化催化剂，导致HZSM-5支持的镓氧化物催化剂初始脱氢活性随HZSM-5支持物的Si/Al比增加而下降。可以通过测量反应前后CO和CO2的量来估算每种反应中参与的CO2的比例。

          <p>The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane into propene is of increasing interest due to the growing demand for propene, an important raw material for producing polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application.</p>
          <p>Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades. The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6-C9 alkenes.</p>
          <p>Dealumination of the zeolite by steaming treatment increases the Si/Al ratio, adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately.</p>
          <p>As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly. Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses.</p>
          <p>It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions.</p>
          <p>Over dealumination deteriorates the catalyst, leading to a decrease in the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support.</p>

          The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane into propene is increasingly of interest due to the growing demand for propene, a vital raw material for producing polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts remains poor, causing a dramatic decline in activity over time, which hinders industrial application. Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied extensively. The aromatization reaction proceeds via a bifunctional mechanism, with gallium oxide catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane and Bronsted acid sites facilitating the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6-C9 alkenes. Steaming treatments to remove aluminum from the zeolite increase the Si/Al ratio, adjusting the catalyst's acidity. As steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and amount of catalysts decrease significantly. The decrease in acid amount is not solely due to the loss of acid sites on HZSM-5; the reduction exceeds the total number of acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses. In propane dehydrogenation reactions, the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play dual roles: enhancing catalyst activity by providing an alternative reaction pathway to the slow step and accelerating catalyst deactivation through catalyzing a series of side reactions. Excessive dealumination deteriorates the catalyst, resulting in a decrease in the initial dehydrogenation activity of HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support. The proportion of CO2 involved in each reaction can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 present before and after the reaction.

          丙烷脱氢成丙烯的催化反应因其对生产聚丙烯、聚丙烯腈、丙烯酸、丙烯酸等重要原料的需求增长而越来越受到关注。不幸的是，这些催化剂的稳定性仍然较差，导致随时间反应活性急剧下降，这对工业应用构成致命威胁。过去几十年里，研究了Ga促进的HZSM-5催化剂上轻质烷烃的芳香化。芳香化反应通过双功能机制进行，镓氧化物催化丙烷脱氢，而Bronsted酸位点则促进轻烯烃的聚合和C6-C9烯烃的环化。通过蒸煮处理从沸石中去除铝可以增加Si/Al比，从而适当地调整催化剂的酸性。随着蒸煮温度升高，催化剂的酸强度和酸量显著降低。酸量的减少不仅仅是由于HZSM-5上的酸性位点损失造成的；减少的酸性位点数量超过HZSM-5原始具有的总酸性位点数。在丙烷脱氢反应中，支持的镓氧化物催化剂上的强酸位点扮演着双重角色：通过提供替代反应途径来增强催化剂活性，同时通过催化一系列副反应加速催化剂失活。过度的脱铝会恶化催化剂，导致HZSM-5支持的镓氧化物催化剂初始脱氢活性随HZSM-5支持物的Si/Al比增加而下降。可以根据反应前后CO和CO2的量估计每种反应中参与的CO2的比例。
