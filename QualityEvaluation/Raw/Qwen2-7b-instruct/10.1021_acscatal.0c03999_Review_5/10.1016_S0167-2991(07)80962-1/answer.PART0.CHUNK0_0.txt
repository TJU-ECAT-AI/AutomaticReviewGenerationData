<p>The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane into propene is of increasing interest due to the growing demand for propene, an important raw material for producing polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application.</p>
<p>Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades. The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6-C9 alkenes.</p>
<p>Dealumination of the zeolite by steaming treatment increases the Si/Al ratio, adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately.</p>
<p>On the XRD patterns of the catalysts, no other diffraction peaks except those of the HZSM-5 supports were observed, indicating that gallium oxide is well dispersed on all the supports.</p>
<p>As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly. Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses.</p>
<p>It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions.</p>
<p>Over dealumination deteriorates the catalyst, leading to a decrease in the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support.</p>
<p>The proportion of CO2 participated in each reaction can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 present before and after reaction.</p>

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their role in accommodating and modifying acidity. Zeolites, particularly those with high Si/Al ratios, offer a balance between acidity and stability. Dealumination through steaming treatments enhances the acidity by increasing the Si/Al ratio, which is crucial for catalytic activity. However, excessive dealumination leads to a decrease in acidity, negatively impacting the catalyst's performance. The key considerations involve finding an optimal Si/Al ratio that balances acidity and stability, minimizing the side reactions that occur with high acidity while maintaining sufficient activity for the desired dehydrogenation reaction. The acidity modification techniques aim to fine-tune the catalyst's reactivity and stability, optimizing the catalytic performance for the specific reaction conditions. The role of CO2 in the reaction is also significant, as it affects both the activity and stability of the catalyst. Its impact on the reaction mechanism and the catalyst's performance necessitates careful consideration in the selection and implementation of these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports.
