[1] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
[2] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
[3] "Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades. The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism."
[4] "Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6  C9 alkenes [7-10]."
[5] "Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO. The support effect comes from their different H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, caused by the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide [12]."
[6] "In this study, a highly active and stable catalyst Ga2O3 supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio was reported for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. The possible reasons for the superior catalytic behavior were discussed."
[7] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
[8] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly. Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses."
[9] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[10] "Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves considering their ability to modify acidity through various techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity level to achieve an optimal balance between reactivity and stability. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include:

1. **Dealumination**: This technique increases the Si/Al ratio of zeolites, leading to a reduction in the number of Bronsted acid sites, which are crucial for promoting the dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, excessive dealumination can lead to a decrease in the amount of strong acid sites needed for efficient dehydrogenation reactions, potentially compromising catalyst activity. The study found that a high Si/Al ratio in HZSM-5 supports enhanced stability by reducing the concentration of strong acid sites, thereby minimizing side reactions and coke formation.

2. **Weakening Acid Strength**: Dealumination and other treatments can weaken the strength of the acid sites on the zeolite surface, which indirectly affects the rate of side reactions and coke formation. This is particularly beneficial in the context of CO2-ODHP reactions, where the elimination of excess acid sites helps to prevent the catalytic deactivation associated with coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

3. **Support Effect**: Different zeolites exhibit varying H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, which influence their effectiveness as supports for catalysts. These intrinsic properties interact with the metal oxide components, like gallium oxide, to modulate the overall catalytic behavior. The study highlighted that the support effect on the performance of gallium oxide catalysts is influenced by the specific properties of the zeolite used, such as its silica-to-alumina ratio and the resulting impact on the distribution of Bronsted acid sites.

4. **Optimization of Strong Acid Sites**: The amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions. By adjusting the acidity of the catalyst through dealumination and other treatments, the study demonstrated that it is possible to optimize the balance between reactivity and stability, leading to highly active and stable catalysts capable of maintaining high propene yields without deactivation over prolonged reaction periods.

In summary, the use of zeolites as support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts is promising due to their tunable acidity, which can be modified through dealumination and other treatments to optimize the catalytic performance. The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific properties of the zeolite, the desired balance between reactivity and stability, and the goal of maximizing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process while minimizing side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景支持材料的特性涉及考虑它们通过各种技术（如去铝化和削弱方法）调整酸度的能力。这些修改有助于通过调整酸度水平来优化催化性能，从而在反应活性与稳定性之间实现最佳平衡。选择和支持不同类型的沸石作为支持物时的关键考虑因素包括：

1. **去铝化**：这种方法提高了沸石的Si/Al比，导致Bronsted酸位点的数量减少，这对促进烷烃脱氢作用至关重要。然而，过度的去铝化可能导致强酸位点数量的急剧下降，这些位点对于高效脱氢反应至关重要，可能损害催化剂活性。研究表明，高Si/Al比的HZSM-5支持物通过减少强酸位点的浓度增强了稳定性，从而最小化了副反应和催化剂表面焦炭的形成。

2. **减弱酸强度**：去铝化和其他处理可以减弱沸石表面的酸位强度，这间接影响副反应和焦炭形成的速度。这对于CO2-ODHP反应特别有益，消除多余的酸位点有助于预防与催化剂表面焦炭沉积相关的催化剂失活。

3. **支持效果**：不同的沸石具有不同的H2吸附能力和酸碱性质，这些性质影响其作为催化剂支持物的有效性。这些内在性质与金属氧化物成分（如镓氧化物）相互作用，调节整体催化行为。研究表明，沸石支持的镓氧化物催化剂的性能受到所用沸石特定属性的影响，如其硅铝比和由此产生的对Bronsted酸位分布的影响。

4. **强酸位的优化**：催化剂上存在的强酸位数量是实现最优脱氢反应性能的关键。通过调整酸度，如去铝化和其他处理，研究表明，有可能优化反应活性与稳定性的平衡，导致高度活跃且稳定的催化剂能够在长时间内保持高丙烯产率而不会失活。

总之，使用沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支持材料是有前景的，因为它们的可调酸度可以通过去铝化和其他方法进行修改，以优化催化性能。选择和支持策略取决于沸石的具体属性、期望的活性与稳定性平衡以及最大化脱氢过程效率并最小化副反应和催化剂失活的目标。
