[1] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
[2] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
[3] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
[4] "In this study, a highly active and stable catalyst Ga2O3 supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio was reported for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2."
[5] "The propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through dealumination of the zeolite."
[6] "The decrease of the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support can be attributed to the reduction of the amount of strong acid sites."
[7] "On the other hand, acid sites also catalyze coke formation via side reactions, such as oligomerization and cyclization."
[8] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
[9] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[10] "Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their ability to adjust acidity, which is crucial for catalytic performance. Zeolites, especially those with high Si/Al ratios like HZSM-5, offer a means to fine-tune acidity through dealumination, a process that enhances stability and efficiency. This is evidenced by the high catalytic activity and stability observed in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2, particularly when using Ga2O3 supported on HZSM-5. The propene yield stabilized at about 22% without observable deactivation in 100 hours, highlighting the importance of adjusting acidity levels. The acidity of the catalyst plays dual roles in the reaction: enhancing activity by providing alternative pathways and catalyzing side reactions like coke formation, which can lead to deactivation. The optimal balance of strong acid sites on the catalyst surface is thus key to achieving high catalytic performance. In the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700), the right amount of strong acid sites enabled the catalyst to maintain high activity and stability, demonstrating the effectiveness of using zeolites as supports in CO2-ODHP processes.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂有前景的支持材料的特性，涉及到调整酸性的能力，这对催化性能至关重要。特别是Si/Al比高的沸石如HZSM-5，提供了通过去铝化调整酸性的途径，从而增强稳定性和效率。这在存在CO2的丙烷脱氢反应中观察到高催化活性和稳定性。丙烯产率稳定在约22%，在100小时内没有明显失活，突出了调整酸性水平的重要性。催化剂的酸性在反应中扮演双重角色：通过提供替代路径增强活性，并催化如焦炭形成等副反应，可能导致失活。支持CO2-ODHP过程的催化剂表面强酸位点的最佳平衡是实现高效催化性能的关键。在Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)的情况下，适当的强酸位点数量使得催化剂能够保持高活性和稳定性，证明了使用沸石作为支持物的有效性。
