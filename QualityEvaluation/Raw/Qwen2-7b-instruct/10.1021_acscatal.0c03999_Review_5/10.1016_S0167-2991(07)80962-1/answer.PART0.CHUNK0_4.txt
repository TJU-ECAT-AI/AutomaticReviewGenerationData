2.1. "HZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by steaming treatment of HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 60 at temperatures of 600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 oC, respectively."
2.2. "The UV adsorption band at about 240 nm corresponds to the amount of Al-O units of ZSM-5 zeolite while the band located at 320 nm is related to the extraframework oxoaluminum species."
2.3. "Since the results of chemical analysis of HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratios are often ambiguous, DRS spectra of HZSM-5 before and after steaming treatment were taken and shown in Fig. 1."
2.4. "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
2.5. "For all the supported catalysts, the propane conversion drops with reaction time and almost reaches steady state after 30 h."
2.6. "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
2.7. "As shown in Table 1, the amount of coke reduces as the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, and the reduction is more obvious initially."
2.8. "The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 2."
2.9. "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
3.1. "The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."
3.2. "The amount of CO yield in the reaction is always twice as much as the CO2 conversion, indicating that almost all CO is produced via reaction (7) over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) catalyst, so the main role of CO2 here is to eliminate coke formed on catalyst surface."
3.3. "The highest activity after 6 h on stream is obtained at a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 2. Similar results were observed over other oxide supported Ga2O3 catalysts, which was ascribed to the inhibition of propane adsorption on the catalyst by CO2."

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding how they influence the acidity and stability of the catalysts. Zeolites, particularly those with high Si/Al ratios, are effective due to their ability to adjust acidity through dealumination processes. Dealumination leads to a higher Si/Al ratio, which weakens the acidity of the zeolite. This modification is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance by balancing the positive role of strong acid sites in enhancing the reaction rate and the negative role in accelerating catalyst deactivation through side reactions.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve choosing the right type of zeolite based on its intrinsic properties, such as adsorption capacity and acid-base characteristics, and determining the optimal steaming temperature for dealumination. This process helps tailor the zeolite to have a suitable level of acidity that promotes the desired reaction while minimizing unwanted side effects. The selection of the zeolite type depends on the specific catalyst being developed and the desired reaction conditions.

CO2 plays a dual role in propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3-supported catalysts. It primarily acts as a reagent for the reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions, helping to eliminate coke formed on the catalyst surface. The CO2 concentration affects the dehydrogenation activity and stability of the catalyst. An optimal CO2/C3H8 ratio of 2 maximizes activity while maintaining stability, as it balances the adsorption of propane and the prevention of coke formation.

In summary, the properties of zeolites as support materials are optimized through strategic dealumination to control acidity, thereby enhancing the efficiency of CO2-ODHP catalysts. The balance between acidity and stability is critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance, and CO2 effectively manages coke formation, contributing to the overall efficiency of the reaction.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂有前景的支撑材料的特性涉及理解它们如何影响催化剂的酸性和稳定性。特别是高Si/Al比的沸石，由于可以通过脱铝过程调整酸性而表现出高效性。脱铝导致更高的Si/Al比，从而减弱沸石的酸性。这种修改对于通过平衡增强反应速率的强酸位的积极作用和加速催化剂降解的副作用的负面影响来优化催化性能至关重要。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括根据沸石的固有属性（如吸附能力和酸碱性质）选择合适的类型，并确定进行脱铝的最佳退火温度。这一过程有助于定制沸石，使其具有适合于促进所需反应的适当水平的酸性，同时尽量减少不必要的副效应。选择的沸石类型取决于正在开发的具体催化剂以及期望的反应条件。

CO2在Ga2O3支持的催化剂上的作用是双重的。它主要作为水煤气逆向反应和布杜瓦德反应的反应物，帮助消除沉积在催化剂表面的焦炭。CO2浓度会影响催化剂的脱氢活性和稳定性。2的CO2/C3H8比例最大化了活性，同时保持了稳定性，因为它平衡了丙烷的吸附和防止焦炭形成。

简而言之，作为支撑材料的沸石的特性通过战略性脱铝来控制酸性，从而增强了CO2-ODHP催化剂的效率。酸性和稳定性的平衡对于实现最佳催化性能至关重要，而CO2有效管理焦炭形成，对整体反应效率做出了贡献。
