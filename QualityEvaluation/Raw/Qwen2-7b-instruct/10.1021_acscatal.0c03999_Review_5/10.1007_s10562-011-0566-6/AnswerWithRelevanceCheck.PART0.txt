          <p>The oxidative dehydrogenation function of Cr-loaded catalysts has been exhibited in the transformation of isobutane to isobutylene, which is used as a feedstock for methyl tert-butyl ether [11, 12].</p>
          <p>The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions.</p>

          Zeolites are considered promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their diverse topologies, robust hydrothermal stability, versatile surface properties, and unique micropore environments. These features facilitate the stabilization of transition metal complexes, which are essential for catalytic reactions. Various acidity modification techniques, including dealumination and weakening methods, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity of the zeolite support. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve understanding the specific requirements of the catalytic reaction, the nature of the zeolite material, and the potential impact on the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.
