<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation function of Cr-loaded catalysts has been exhibited in the transformation of isobutane to isobutylene, which is used as a feedstock for methyl tert-butyl ether [11, 12].</p>
<p>The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>The use of boron in the borosilicate framework modified the nature of introduced Cr species. According to UVvis, Raman and H2-TPR, the steaming process resulted in auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI. A significantly enhanced stability was achieved over the steaming-treated catalyst, which was possibly attributed to the related Cr3+ oxide species.</p>

To analyze the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we consider their structural attributes. Zeolites offer a wide range of topologies, strong hydrothermal stability, and versatile surface properties, including hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. These characteristics enable the stabilization of transition metal complexes, which are essential for catalytic reactions. Boron incorporation into the borosilicate framework modifies the nature of introduced chromium species, facilitating the auto-reduction of some chromium hexavalent compounds to trivalent compounds via steaming processes. This leads to an enhancement in catalyst stability, likely attributed to the presence of trivalent chromium oxide species.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve assessing the specific requirements of the catalytic reaction, such as the desired reactivity, stability, and selectivity. The choice of zeolite topology and the extent of acidity modification should align with the reaction conditions and the nature of the transition metal complex. The steaming treatment is particularly advantageous for reducing Brönsted acidity, which contributes to improved reaction stability. The goal is to optimize the balance between reactivity and stability to achieve the best catalytic performance.

要分析为什么沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支持材料，我们需要考虑它们的结构特性。沸石提供了多种拓扑结构、强大的水热稳定性以及多变的表面性质，包括疏水性和亲水性。这些特点使过渡金属复合物的稳定化成为可能，这对于催化反应至关重要。硼的引入改变了沸石框架中引入的铬物种的性质，通过蒸气过程，部分六价铬化合物被还原为三价化合物。这导致催化剂稳定性显著增强，这可能归因于相关三价铬氧化物种的存在。

在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素涉及评估催化反应的具体需求，如所需反应性、稳定性和选择性。选择沸石拓扑结构和酸性改性程度应与反应条件和过渡金属复合物的性质相匹配。蒸气处理特别有利于减少布伦斯特酸性，从而提高反应稳定性。目标是在活性和稳定性之间实现最佳平衡，以获得最佳的催化性能。
