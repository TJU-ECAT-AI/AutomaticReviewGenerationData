[1] "The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions."
[2] "It has been shown that acidic properties of the zeolite support strongly influence the formation of Cr species."
[3] "However, there have been controversies about the catalytic roles of Cr species in the literature, and systematic studies are necessary to unravel the relevant reaction mechanisms."
[4] "Unfortunately, although great efforts have been devoted into the synthesis, there is hardly solid evidence for successful incorporation of Cr3+ into the framework of silicalite-1 materials, possibility owing to the high crystallization energies of octahedral coordination of Cr3+."
[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation function of Cr-loaded catalysts has been exhibited in the transformation of isobutane to isobutylene, which is used as a feedstock for methyl tert-butyl ether."
[6] "Moreover, redox properties of the Cr catalysts are determined by the Cr valence states, coordination numbers, molecular structures, bulk oxide features, active phase density, etc., which are related with preparation methods, the nature of supports and the pretreatment conditions."
[7] "In the present study, we have prepared Cr supported catalysts over silicalite-1 (MFI topology) and borosilicate H[B]MFI, and tested their catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CO2 as the oxidant."
[8] "We observed no significant change after the catalysts were used for the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2."
[9] "The UVvis measurement of the prepared samples was obtained under ambient conditions, and the spectra are displayed in Fig. 2."
[10] "The presence of Cr6+ resulted from the oxidation of Cr3+ by the calcination in the preparation procedures."
[11] "Compared with the silicalite-1 support, the use of H[B]MFI as the support resulted in the absence of band in the 463 and 608 nm (Fig. 2b), suggesting the efficiency of the transformation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ on H[B]MFI support."
[12] "In other words, Cr was more readily converted to Cr6+ on H[B]MFI than on silicalite-1, and we suggest that the majority of Cr species on Cr/H[B]MFI were Cr6+."
[13] "However, further streaming treatment over Cr/H[B]MFI led to the appearance of bands at 463 and 608 nm (Fig. 2c), indicating the generation of Cr3+ species although the steaming was performed in the presence of O2."
[14] "Obviously, the water vapor played crucial roles in the auto-reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ during the steaming process."
[15] "Moreover, such readily-reduced Cr6+ species on Cr/H[B]MFI could be transformed into Cr3+ by steaming treatment, as suggested by the TPR of Cr/H[B]MFI-st in which no reduction from Cr6+ to Cr3+ was observed (Fig. 4c)."
[16] "Therefore, we propose that there might be two kinds of Cr6+ species on Cr/H[B]MFI; one Cr6+ species was similar to the Cr6+ species over Cr/silicalite-1 that was difficult to be reduced, and the other was the Cr6+ species related with the presence of boron, and was readily reduced to Cr3+ with H2 reduction or by steaming treatment."
[17] "For the Cr species that can be detected by XPS, it is evident that the Cr3+ to Cr6+ ratio was significantly higher on Cr/H[B]MFI-st than on Cr/H[B]MFI; this underpinned the UVvis observation that steaming treatment converted some Cr6+ oxide species into Cr3+ oxide species."
[18] "Moreover, no broad line at ca. 1710 ppm, the characteristic resonance of nonframework trigonal boron species, was visible on either of the samples, suggesting that the majority of boron species were located in the borosilicate framework even after steaming treatment."
[19] "Hence, we propose that the steaming treatment converted the trigonal boron to the tetrahedral one in the zeolite framework, leading to the disappearance of the broad band due to trigonal boron center."
[20] "Together with the octahedral coordination nature of Cr3+, the possibility of incorporation of Cr3+ into the zeolite framework during the steaming process can be excluded."
[21] "In short, the IR of adsorbed NO confirmed that there was a difference in the supported Cr species between Cr/H[B]MFI and Cr/silicalite-1 catalysts, and that steaming treatment of Cr/H[B]MFI led to the transformation of certain Cr species."
[22] "Moreover, both the reaction selectivities toward the desired product of propylene remained nearly unchanged (ca. 90%) as listed in Table 2."
[23] "Indeed, the catalytic roles of different Cr3+ species in the ODH of propane were elaborated [11, 25, 26], and it was claimed that the reduced Cr3+ formed from Cr6+ during the reaction was less active than the dispersed Cr3+ oxide [11]."
[24] "Indeed, the catalytic roles of different Cr3+ species in the ODH of propane were elaborated [11, 25, 26], and it was claimed that the reduced Cr3+ formed from Cr6+ during the reaction was less active than the dispersed Cr3+ oxide [11]."
[25] "This is in accordance with our finding that the initial activity of Cr/H[B]MFI was higher than that of Cr/H[B]MFI-st."
[26] "Indeed, the catalytic roles of different Cr3+ species in the ODH of propane were elaborated [11, 25, 26], and it was claimed that the reduced Cr3+ formed from Cr6+ during the reaction was less active than the dispersed Cr3+ oxide [11]."
[27] "In other words, different Cr3+ species could play different catalytic functions."

Analyze the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, and critically evaluate the various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods. How do these modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance, and what are the key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports?

Zeolites are attractive support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their diverse topologies, robust hydrothermal stability, versatile surface functionalities, and unique micropore structures. These features enable the stabilization of transition metal complexes, crucial for catalytic reactions. Zeolites can be modified through various techniques to optimize catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the aluminum content, altering the acidity of the zeolite, which influences the formation and stability of chromium species. Weakening methods involve weakening the zeolite framework, potentially facilitating the incorporation of chromium ions. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite (e.g., MFI, BEA, etc.), the desired catalytic properties, and the reaction conditions. Different types of zeolites require tailored approaches to maximize their potential in CO2-ODHP catalysts.
