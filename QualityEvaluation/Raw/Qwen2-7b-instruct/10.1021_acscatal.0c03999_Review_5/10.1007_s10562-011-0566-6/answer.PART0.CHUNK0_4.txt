The oxidative dehydrogenation function of Cr-loaded catalysts has been exhibited in the transformation of isobutane to isobutylene, which is used as a feedstock for methyl tert-butyl ether [11, 12].
The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions.

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their diverse topologies, hydrothermal stability, versatile surface properties, and unique micropore environments. These features enable the stabilization of transition metal complexes critical for catalytic reactions. Zeolites' wide range of topologies, robust stability under hydrothermal conditions, easily modifiable surface properties (such as hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity), and distinctive micropore architectures offer significant advantages in supporting transition metals to enhance catalytic performance.

Different acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity level and distribution of the zeolite support. Dealumination involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, which can weaken acidity and reduce coke formation. Weakening methods, on the other hand, aim to modify the acidity without altering the overall structure of the zeolite. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve understanding the specific requirements of the catalytic reaction, the nature of the zeolite material, and the potential impact on the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. The choice of technique depends on factors such as the desired level of acidity, the type of transition metal loading, and the reaction conditions.

由于其多样的拓扑结构、水热稳定性、可调表面性质（如疏水性和亲水性）和独特的微孔环境，沸石作为催化剂载体展现出巨大的潜力。这些特征使得过渡金属复合物在催化反应中得到稳定，对提高催化性能至关重要。沸石广泛多样的拓扑结构、在水热条件下的坚固稳定性、易于调整的表面特性（例如疏水性和亲水性）以及特有的微孔结构为支持过渡金属提供了显著优势。

不同的酸度改性技术，如去铝化和削弱法，通过调整酸度水平和分布来优化催化性能。去铝化涉及从沸石框架中去除铝，这可以减弱酸度并减少焦炭生成。削弱方法则旨在修改酸度而不改变沸石的整体结构。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括了解特定催化反应的需求、沸石材料的性质以及催化剂稳定性和选择性的潜在影响。选择技术取决于需要的酸度水平、加载到沸石上的过渡金属类型和反应条件等因素。
