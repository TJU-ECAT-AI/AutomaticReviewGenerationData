[1] "Among the less conventional but milder oxidants, the employment of CO2 in the ODH of propane is of particularly interest since the utilization of CO2 as a reactant presents a formidable challenge for the chemistry."
[2] "We gave further steaming treatment of the catalyst with H[B]MFI as the support to take the advantage of the high reactivity of Cr species toward water molecule to obtain various Cr species."
[3] "The steaming process resulted in auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI."
[4] "A significantly enhanced stability was achieved over the steaming-treated catalyst, which was possibly attributed to the related Cr3+ oxide species."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their wide range of topologies, strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modifiable surface properties, and unique micropore environments. These characteristics provide potential for stabilizing transition metal complexes, crucial for catalytic reactions. Various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity of the zeolite support. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve the specific type of zeolite used as a support, the desired level of acidity for the catalyst, and the impact of acidity on the stability and selectivity of the catalytic process. The steaming treatment of Cr/H[B]MFI catalysts resulted in the auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+, enhancing the stability of the catalyst. This improvement likely stems from the related Cr3+ oxide species, which are better suited for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2 as the oxidant.

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂而言，沸石的优良特性包括它们丰富的拓扑结构、强大的水热稳定性、可调整的表面特性和独特的微孔环境。这些特征为稳定过渡金属复合物提供了可能，这对催化反应至关重要。不同的酸度调节技术，如去铝化和削弱方法，通过调整沸石支持材料的酸性来优化催化性能。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括作为支持材料的特定类型的沸石、催化剂所需的酸度水平以及酸度对催化过程的稳定性和选择性的影响。对Cr/H[B]MFI催化剂进行的蒸煮处理导致了一些Cr6+还原为Cr3+，提高了催化剂的稳定性。这种改善可能源于与之相关的Cr3+氧化物物种，这些物种更适合于丙烷在CO2作为氧化剂的情况下氧化脱氢生成丙烯。
