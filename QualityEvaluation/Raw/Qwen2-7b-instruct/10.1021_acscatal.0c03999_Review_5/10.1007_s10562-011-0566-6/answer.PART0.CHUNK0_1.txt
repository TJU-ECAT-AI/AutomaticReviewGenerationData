<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation function of Cr-loaded catalysts has been exhibited in the transformation of isobutane to isobutylene, which is used as a feedstock for methyl tert-butyl ether [11, 12].</p>
<p>Cr can be present as an isolated unit and bulk oxide with different agglomeration forms. Moreover, redox properties of the Cr catalysts are determined by the Cr valence states, coordination numbers, molecular structures, bulk oxide features, active phase density, etc., which are related with preparation methods, the nature of supports and the pretreatment conditions.</p>
<p>The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>In the present study, we have prepared Cr supported catalysts over silicalite-1 (MFI topology) and borosilicate H[B]MFI, and tested their catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CO2 as the oxidant. Borosilicate has been claimed to be an effective support to prepare vanadium-loaded catalysts for the ODH of propane [17].</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was investigated over a series of chromium-based catalysts supported on MFI zeolitic materials. Structural characterization suggests that the boron present in the framework modified the nature of introduced Cr species. According to UVvis, Raman and H2-TPR, the steaming process resulted in auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI.</p>
<p>A significantly enhanced stability was achieved over the steaming-treated catalyst, which was possibly attributed to the related Cr3+ oxide species.</p>

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique characteristics. Zeolites offer a wide range of topologies, strong hydrothermal stability, and versatile surface properties such as hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. These features enable the stabilization of transition metal complexes, crucial for catalytic reactions. In the study, chromium catalysts were prepared over silicalite-1 (MFI topology) and borosilicate H[B]MFI. Borosilicate was noted as an effective support for vanadium-loaded catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The study also highlighted the importance of steaming treatment, which led to the auto-reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI, enhancing the stability of the catalyst. The key consideration in selecting and implementing these strategies depends on the specific properties of the zeolite support used.

The modifications aimed at optimizing catalytic performance typically involve dealing with the aluminum content (dealumination) and weakening the acidity of the zeolite framework. Dealumination can improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst by removing acidic sites that may deactivate the catalyst or interfere with the desired reaction pathways. Weakening the acidity, often achieved through steaming or other treatments, can also contribute to enhanced reaction stabilities by reducing the potential for side reactions or deactivating the catalyst through the formation of coke or other byproducts. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used as the support, the specific catalyst loading, and the reaction conditions, such as temperature and reactant composition, which can influence the effectiveness of the modifications.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的特性能从以下几个方面入手：广泛的拓扑结构、强大的热稳定性、可修改的表面特性（如疏水性和亲水性）以及独特的微孔环境。这些特性允许稳定过渡金属复合物，这对催化反应至关重要。在研究中，制备了含铬催化剂，分别位于MFI拓扑结构的硅铝酸盐和硼硅酸盐H[B]MFI。有报道称，硼硅酸盐是用于丙烷氧化脱氢的钒负载催化剂的有效支撑材料。研究还强调了蒸馏处理的重要性，该处理导致了Cr/H[B]MFI上的Cr6+自动还原为Cr3+，显著提高了催化剂的稳定性。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素取决于所使用的特定沸石支撑材料。

旨在优化催化性能的修改通常涉及去除铝含量（去铝化）和减弱沸石框架的酸度。去铝化可以通过提高选择性和稳定性来改进催化剂，通过移除可能使催化剂失活或干扰所需反应路径的酸性位点。通过蒸馏或其他处理削弱酸度也可能有助于增强反应稳定性，通过减少可能形成焦炭或其他副产品的潜在副反应或催化剂失活。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石支撑材料类型、催化剂负载的具体情况以及温度和反应物组成等反应条件。
