To analyze the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, we consider their structural attributes. Zeolites offer a wide range of topologies, strong hydrothermal stability, and versatile surface properties, including hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. These characteristics enable the stabilization of transition metal complexes, which are essential for catalytic reactions. Boron incorporation into the borosilicate framework modifies the nature of introduced chromium species, facilitating the auto-reduction of some chromium hexavalent compounds to trivalent compounds via steaming processes. This leads to an enhancement in catalyst stability, likely attributed to the presence of trivalent chromium oxide species.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve assessing the specific requirements of the catalytic reaction, such as the desired reactivity, stability, and selectivity. The choice of zeolite topology and the extent of acidity modification should align with the reaction conditions and the nature of the transition metal complex. The steaming treatment is particularly advantageous for reducing Brönsted acidity, which contributes to improved reaction stability. The goal is to optimize the balance between reactivity and stability to achieve the best catalytic performance.

要分析为什么沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支持材料，我们需要考虑它们的结构特性。沸石提供了多种拓扑结构、强大的水热稳定性以及多变的表面性质，包括疏水性和亲水性。这些特点使过渡金属复合物的稳定化成为可能，这对于催化反应至关重要。硼的引入改变了沸石框架中引入的铬物种的性质，通过蒸气过程，部分六价铬化合物被还原为三价化合物。这导致催化剂稳定性显著增强，这可能归因于相关三价铬氧化物种的存在。

在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素涉及评估催化反应的具体需求，如所需反应性、稳定性和选择性。选择沸石拓扑结构和酸性改性程度应与反应条件和过渡金属复合物的性质相匹配。蒸气处理特别有利于减少布伦斯特酸性，从而提高反应稳定性。目标是在活性和稳定性之间实现最佳平衡，以获得最佳的催化性能。

Analyzing the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts involves understanding their unique characteristics. Zeolites offer a wide range of topologies, strong hydrothermal stability, and versatile surface properties such as hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. These features enable the stabilization of transition metal complexes, crucial for catalytic reactions. In the study, chromium catalysts were prepared over silicalite-1 (MFI topology) and borosilicate H[B]MFI. Borosilicate was noted as an effective support for vanadium-loaded catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The study also highlighted the importance of steaming treatment, which led to the auto-reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI, enhancing the stability of the catalyst. The key consideration in selecting and implementing these strategies depends on the specific properties of the zeolite support used.

The modifications aimed at optimizing catalytic performance typically involve dealing with the aluminum content (dealumination) and weakening the acidity of the zeolite framework. Dealumination can improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst by removing acidic sites that may deactivate the catalyst or interfere with the desired reaction pathways. Weakening the acidity, often achieved through steaming or other treatments, can also contribute to enhanced reaction stabilities by reducing the potential for side reactions or deactivating the catalyst through the formation of coke or other byproducts. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used as the support, the specific catalyst loading, and the reaction conditions, such as temperature and reactant composition, which can influence the effectiveness of the modifications.

分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的特性能从以下几个方面入手：广泛的拓扑结构、强大的热稳定性、可修改的表面特性（如疏水性和亲水性）以及独特的微孔环境。这些特性允许稳定过渡金属复合物，这对催化反应至关重要。在研究中，制备了含铬催化剂，分别位于MFI拓扑结构的硅铝酸盐和硼硅酸盐H[B]MFI。有报道称，硼硅酸盐是用于丙烷氧化脱氢的钒负载催化剂的有效支撑材料。研究还强调了蒸馏处理的重要性，该处理导致了Cr/H[B]MFI上的Cr6+自动还原为Cr3+，显著提高了催化剂的稳定性。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素取决于所使用的特定沸石支撑材料。

旨在优化催化性能的修改通常涉及去除铝含量（去铝化）和减弱沸石框架的酸度。去铝化可以通过提高选择性和稳定性来改进催化剂，通过移除可能使催化剂失活或干扰所需反应路径的酸性位点。通过蒸馏或其他处理削弱酸度也可能有助于增强反应稳定性，通过减少可能形成焦炭或其他副产品的潜在副反应或催化剂失活。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括所使用的沸石支撑材料类型、催化剂负载的具体情况以及温度和反应物组成等反应条件。

[1] "The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions."
[2] "It has been shown that acidic properties of the zeolite support strongly influence the formation of Cr species."
[3] "However, there have been controversies about the catalytic roles of Cr species in the literature, and systematic studies are necessary to unravel the relevant reaction mechanisms."
[4] "Unfortunately, although great efforts have been devoted into the synthesis, there is hardly solid evidence for successful incorporation of Cr3+ into the framework of silicalite-1 materials, possibility owing to the high crystallization energies of octahedral coordination of Cr3+."
[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation function of Cr-loaded catalysts has been exhibited in the transformation of isobutane to isobutylene, which is used as a feedstock for methyl tert-butyl ether."
[6] "Moreover, redox properties of the Cr catalysts are determined by the Cr valence states, coordination numbers, molecular structures, bulk oxide features, active phase density, etc., which are related with preparation methods, the nature of supports and the pretreatment conditions."
[7] "In the present study, we have prepared Cr supported catalysts over silicalite-1 (MFI topology) and borosilicate H[B]MFI, and tested their catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CO2 as the oxidant."
[8] "We observed no significant change after the catalysts were used for the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2."
[9] "The UVvis measurement of the prepared samples was obtained under ambient conditions, and the spectra are displayed in Fig. 2."
[10] "The presence of Cr6+ resulted from the oxidation of Cr3+ by the calcination in the preparation procedures."
[11] "Compared with the silicalite-1 support, the use of H[B]MFI as the support resulted in the absence of band in the 463 and 608 nm (Fig. 2b), suggesting the efficiency of the transformation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ on H[B]MFI support."
[12] "In other words, Cr was more readily converted to Cr6+ on H[B]MFI than on silicalite-1, and we suggest that the majority of Cr species on Cr/H[B]MFI were Cr6+."
[13] "However, further streaming treatment over Cr/H[B]MFI led to the appearance of bands at 463 and 608 nm (Fig. 2c), indicating the generation of Cr3+ species although the steaming was performed in the presence of O2."
[14] "Obviously, the water vapor played crucial roles in the auto-reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ during the steaming process."
[15] "Moreover, such readily-reduced Cr6+ species on Cr/H[B]MFI could be transformed into Cr3+ by steaming treatment, as suggested by the TPR of Cr/H[B]MFI-st in which no reduction from Cr6+ to Cr3+ was observed (Fig. 4c)."
[16] "Therefore, we propose that there might be two kinds of Cr6+ species on Cr/H[B]MFI; one Cr6+ species was similar to the Cr6+ species over Cr/silicalite-1 that was difficult to be reduced, and the other was the Cr6+ species related with the presence of boron, and was readily reduced to Cr3+ with H2 reduction or by steaming treatment."
[17] "For the Cr species that can be detected by XPS, it is evident that the Cr3+ to Cr6+ ratio was significantly higher on Cr/H[B]MFI-st than on Cr/H[B]MFI; this underpinned the UVvis observation that steaming treatment converted some Cr6+ oxide species into Cr3+ oxide species."
[18] "Moreover, no broad line at ca. 1710 ppm, the characteristic resonance of nonframework trigonal boron species, was visible on either of the samples, suggesting that the majority of boron species were located in the borosilicate framework even after steaming treatment."
[19] "Hence, we propose that the steaming treatment converted the trigonal boron to the tetrahedral one in the zeolite framework, leading to the disappearance of the broad band due to trigonal boron center."
[20] "Together with the octahedral coordination nature of Cr3+, the possibility of incorporation of Cr3+ into the zeolite framework during the steaming process can be excluded."
[21] "In short, the IR of adsorbed NO confirmed that there was a difference in the supported Cr species between Cr/H[B]MFI and Cr/silicalite-1 catalysts, and that steaming treatment of Cr/H[B]MFI led to the transformation of certain Cr species."
[22] "Moreover, both the reaction selectivities toward the desired product of propylene remained nearly unchanged (ca. 90%) as listed in Table 2."
[23] "Indeed, the catalytic roles of different Cr3+ species in the ODH of propane were elaborated [11, 25, 26], and it was claimed that the reduced Cr3+ formed from Cr6+ during the reaction was less active than the dispersed Cr3+ oxide [11]."
[24] "Indeed, the catalytic roles of different Cr3+ species in the ODH of propane were elaborated [11, 25, 26], and it was claimed that the reduced Cr3+ formed from Cr6+ during the reaction was less active than the dispersed Cr3+ oxide [11]."
[25] "This is in accordance with our finding that the initial activity of Cr/H[B]MFI was higher than that of Cr/H[B]MFI-st."
[26] "Indeed, the catalytic roles of different Cr3+ species in the ODH of propane were elaborated [11, 25, 26], and it was claimed that the reduced Cr3+ formed from Cr6+ during the reaction was less active than the dispersed Cr3+ oxide [11]."
[27] "In other words, different Cr3+ species could play different catalytic functions."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their diverse topologies, hydrothermal stability, versatile surface properties, and unique micropore environments. These features enable the stabilization of transition metal complexes critical for catalytic reactions. Zeolites' wide range of topologies, robust stability under hydrothermal conditions, easily modifiable surface properties (such as hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity), and distinctive micropore architectures offer significant advantages in supporting transition metals to enhance catalytic performance.

Different acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening, contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by adjusting the acidity level and distribution of the zeolite support. Dealumination involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, which can weaken acidity and reduce coke formation. Weakening methods, on the other hand, aim to modify the acidity without altering the overall structure of the zeolite. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies involve understanding the specific requirements of the catalytic reaction, the nature of the zeolite material, and the potential impact on the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. The choice of technique depends on factors such as the desired level of acidity, the type of transition metal loading, and the reaction conditions.
