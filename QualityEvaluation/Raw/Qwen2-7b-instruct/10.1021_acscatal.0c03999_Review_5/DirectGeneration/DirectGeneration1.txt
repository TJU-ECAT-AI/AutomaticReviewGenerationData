Optimization of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP (Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane) reactions is a critical area in catalysis research aimed at enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of these processes. Zeolites, with their well-defined microporous structures, offer an ideal framework for hosting metal or metal oxide species that act as active sites for the desired chemical transformations. The properties of these catalysts, including their surface area, pore size distribution, and textural features, play pivotal roles in determining the catalytic activity and stability during CO2-ODHP reactions.

Acidity modification techniques are employed to fine-tune the acidity levels within zeolite supports, which significantly impacts the reaction pathways and product distribution. By adjusting the degree of acidity, researchers can control the adsorption of reactants, the orientation of molecules on the catalyst surface, and ultimately, the selectivity towards desired products. Techniques such as acid treatment, ion exchange, and co-synthesis methods allow for the precise alteration of acidic sites, leading to catalysts that exhibit superior performance in terms of yield, conversion, and resistance to deactivation.

Performance enhancement in zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions often involves the integration of multiple strategies, including but not limited to, the selection of optimal zeolite types, the use of synergistic metal promoters, and the optimization of operational conditions such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition. These efforts aim to maximize the efficiency of CO2 utilization while minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact. Through systematic studies on catalyst properties, acidity modification, and process optimization, researchers are advancing the field towards more sustainable and economically viable solutions for CO2-to-value chemical conversions.
