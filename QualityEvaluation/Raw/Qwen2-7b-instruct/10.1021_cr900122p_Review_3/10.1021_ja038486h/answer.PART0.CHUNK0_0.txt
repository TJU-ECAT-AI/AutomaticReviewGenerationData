The formation of surface zirconium hydrides was investigated through thermal treatment under hydrogen using advanced solid-state NMR techniques. These hydrides exhibited a notable amount of hydrogen atoms bonded to the zirconium center, contributing to their catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions such as H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The rates of these reactions were notably influenced by the zirconium hydrides' presence. The mechanisms involved σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, which significantly enhanced the efficiency of the reactions. The selectivity of the reactions was improved due to the specific interactions between the zirconium hydrides and the substrates.
