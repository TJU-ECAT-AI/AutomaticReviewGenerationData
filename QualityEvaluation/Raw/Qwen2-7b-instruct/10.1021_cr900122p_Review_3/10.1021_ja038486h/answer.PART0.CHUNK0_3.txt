The study focused on understanding the formation of surface zirconium hydrides through thermal treatment under hydrogen conditions using advanced solid-state NMR techniques. The research aimed to characterize the structure and catalytic properties of these hydrides. The structure of the zirconium hydrides was influenced by the support material used. In C-H bond activation reactions, σ-bond metathesis played a significant role. Hydrogenolysis and chain walking were identified as key mechanisms contributing to the process. The evaluation of reaction rates, selectivity, and the efficiency of the catalyst provided insights into the catalytic performance of zirconium hydrides.
