The study compared the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The formation of surface zirconium hydrides was investigated through thermal treatment under hydrogen using advanced solid-state NMR techniques. The mechanism of hydrogenation involved the breaking of Si-O bonds and the formation of zirconium hydride. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrated higher activity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions compared to alumina-supported thorium hydrides. Faster reaction rates were observed for silica-supported zirconium hydrides due to the higher density of active sites. Enhanced selectivity towards specific products was also noted. The mechanisms involved σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. These processes facilitated the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds, cleavage of hydrogen atoms, and the movement of the growing alkene chain along the catalyst surface, respectively.
