The study in the Journal of the American Chemical Society investigated the molecular understanding of the formation of surface zirconium hydrides through thermal treatment under hydrogen, utilizing advanced solid-state NMR techniques. The [(SiO)Zr(CH2tBu)3] compound served as the precursor for the zirconium hydride formation. The catalysts' structures were characterized via solid-state NMR spectroscopy, providing insights into their properties. The zirconium hydrides' catalytic activities were assessed in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions, involving mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The study discussed the reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of these mechanisms in detail.
