Since there are no specific details provided in the literature regarding the comparison, preparation, structure, catalytic properties, and mechanisms of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, including discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes, I am unable to provide an answer to the questions posed. The provided literature focuses on the preparation of a rhenium catalyst for olefin metathesis and does not contain information pertinent to the requested comparisons and mechanisms related to zirconium and thorium hydrides.
