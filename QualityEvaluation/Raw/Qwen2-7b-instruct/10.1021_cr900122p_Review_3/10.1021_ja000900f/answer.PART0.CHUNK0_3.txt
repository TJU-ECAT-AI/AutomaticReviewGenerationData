The study describes the development of a highly active rhenium heterogeneous catalyst for olefin metathesis, prepared through surface organometallic chemistry. This catalyst demonstrated exceptional activity and selectivity in olefin metathesis reactions, with its preparation involving specific surface organometallic chemistry steps. Its structure was characterized using high-resolution X-ray diffraction. The mechanism of action included σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. In H/D exchange reactions, the catalyst efficiently activated C-H bonds, and in alkane metathesis, it facilitated the rearrangement of alkane molecules. Compared to traditional homogeneous catalysts, the reaction rates were significantly faster, and selectivity was improved due to the unique structure and mechanism of the catalyst.
