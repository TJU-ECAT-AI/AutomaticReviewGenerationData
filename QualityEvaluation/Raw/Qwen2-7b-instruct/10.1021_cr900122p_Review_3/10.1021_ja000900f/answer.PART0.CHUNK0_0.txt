Since the specific details comparing and contrasting the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, including their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, as well as discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are not provided within the given literature, it is not possible to provide detailed answers based solely on the content available. Further information from the actual text of the article would be required to accurately address these questions.
