Since the specific details comparing and contrasting the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, including their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, as well as discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are not provided within the given literature, it is not possible to provide detailed answers based solely on the content available. Further information from the actual text of the article would be required to accurately address these questions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study describes the development of a highly active rhenium heterogeneous catalyst for olefin metathesis, prepared through surface organometallic chemistry. This catalyst demonstrated exceptional activity and selectivity in olefin metathesis reactions, with its preparation involving specific surface organometallic chemistry steps. Its structure was characterized using high-resolution X-ray diffraction. The mechanism of action included σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. In H/D exchange reactions, the catalyst efficiently activated C-H bonds, and in alkane metathesis, it facilitated the rearrangement of alkane molecules. Compared to traditional homogeneous catalysts, the reaction rates were significantly faster, and selectivity was improved due to the unique structure and mechanism of the catalyst.

Since there are no specific details provided in the literature regarding the comparison, preparation, structure, catalytic properties, and mechanisms of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, including discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes, I am unable to provide an answer to the questions posed. The provided literature focuses on the preparation of a rhenium catalyst for olefin metathesis and does not contain information pertinent to the requested comparisons and mechanisms related to zirconium and thorium hydrides.
