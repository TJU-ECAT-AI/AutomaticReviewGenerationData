<p>High-resolution 29Si MAS NMR spectra of galliumhydroxosodalite containing different amounts of gallium were evaluated by Hayashi et al.175 and compared with aluminum hydroxosodalite (Figure 47).</p>
<p>The spectrum of the aluminosilicate (Figure 47c) shows one asymmetric line overlapped by Si(4Al) and Si(3Al) signals. In the gallosilicate (Figure 47a,b), the spectra are composed of two lines with δ = 75 and 83 ppm assigned to Si(4Ga) and Si(3Ga) configurations, respectively.</p>
<p>Relative intensities of the lines (Sample A, Si/Ga ratio = 1.05 according to NMR) led to the estimation that 81% is contributed by Si(4Ga) and 19% by Si(3Ga) units.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The preparation of gallium-containing zeolites involves comparing their NMR spectra with aluminum counterparts to determine the distribution of gallium species within the zeolite framework. The relative intensities of the lines in the 29Si MAS NMR spectra indicate that in the gallosilicate, 81% of the silicon is in the Si(4Ga) configuration, while 19% is in the Si(3Ga) configuration. This distribution is estimated based on the Si/Ga ratio determined by NMR analysis.
