The preparation of silica-supported zirconium hydrides involved a sol-gel method utilizing zirconium tetraisopropoxide as the precursor. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides were created through a calcination process that included thorium oxide and alumina powders. Both hydride structures were analyzed using XRD and TEM techniques. In terms of catalytic properties, silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibited higher activity in H/D exchange reactions due to the presence of acid sites. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, excelled in alkane metathesis reactions because of the strong Lewis acidity provided by thorium ions. Reaction rates for H/D exchange were faster in zirconium hydrides, whereas alkane metathesis proceeded more efficiently with thorium hydrides. Both systems showed high selectivity with minimal formation of side products. Mechanistically, σ-bond metathesis occurred in alkane metathesis, while hydrogenolysis played a critical role in H/D exchange reactions. Chain walking was observed in both processes, aiding in the rearrangement of carbon atoms within the molecules.

对二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢的制备、结构和催化性质进行了研究。二氧化硅支持的锆化氢通过溶胶-凝胶法合成，以四异丙氧基锆为前体。氧化铝支持的钍化氢通过将氧化钍和氧化铝粉末进行煅烧制备。两种化氢的结构使用XRD和TEM技术进行了表征。在催化性能方面，二氧化硅支持的锆化氢在氢/氘交换反应中表现出更高的活性，这是由于酸性位点的存在。而氧化铝支持的钍化氢在烷烃裂合反应中表现出更好的性能，因为钍离子提供了强烈的路易斯酸性。氢/氘交换反应中，锆化氢的反应速率更快，而烷烃裂合反应则在钍化氢中进行得更高效。两种系统均显示出高选择性，副产物极少。从机制上讲，烷烃裂合反应中发生了σ键裂合，而在氢/氘交换反应中，则是氢解离起着关键作用。观察到链行走现象，在这两种过程中都促进了碳原子在分子内的重排。
