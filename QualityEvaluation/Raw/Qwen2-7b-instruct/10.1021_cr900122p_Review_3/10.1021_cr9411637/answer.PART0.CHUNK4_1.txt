Answer: 
1. In 1994, more than 20 million tons of gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were produced using acid-catalyzed equilibrium reactions of methanol and isobutene at low temperatures (330-350 K). 
2. Methanol can be converted into gasoline, aromatics, or olefins with acidic catalysts at temperatures above 670 K. 
3. By controlling the shape of zeolites, the length of olefins can be adjusted to maximize the yield of C2-C4 olefins.
4. Gallium-based zeolite catalysts have limited applications compared to others.
5. Inui tested a wide range of aluminum-free ZSM-5 catalysts containing gallium, chromium, vanadium, scandium, germanium, manganese, lanthanum, aluminum, nickel, zirconium, titanium, iron, cobalt, and platinum at Si/Me ratios less than 3200.
6. There were no reported conversion data for methanol in these tests.
7. Besides aliphatic compounds, aromatics are also formed as products of the reaction.
8. Gallium-modified ZSM-5 catalysts produce primarily C5-C11 aliphatic compounds.
9. Iron-, cobalt-, and platinum-modified catalysts showed significantly higher efficiency than aluminum-ZSM-5 catalysts.
10. No conversion data for methanol were provided in the referenced work.

1. 1994年，通过在低温（330-350 K）下进行甲醇和异丁烯的酸催化平衡反应，生产了超过2000万吨的汽油添加剂甲基叔丁基醚（MTBE）。
2. 在高于670 K的温度下，可以通过酸性催化剂将甲醇转化为汽油、芳香烃或烯烃。
3. 通过控制沸石的形状，可以调整烯烃的长度以实现C2-C4烯烃的最大产率。
4. 含有镓的沸石催化剂的应用相对较少，与其它催化剂相比。
5. Inui测试了一系列铝含量少于3200的无铝ZSM-5催化剂，含有镓、铬、钒、钪、锗、锰、镧、铝、镍、锆、钛、铁、钴和铂。
6. 没有关于甲醇转化的数据被报告出来。
7. 反应产物中除了烷烃外，还检测到了芳香烃。
8. 镓改性的ZSM-5催化剂主要生成C5-C11的烷烃。
9. 铁、钴和铂改性的催化剂比铝-ZSM-5催化剂显示出更高的效率。
10. 没有关于甲醇转化的数据提供在引用的工作中。
