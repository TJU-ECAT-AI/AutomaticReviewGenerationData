[1] "The synthesis of silica-supported zirconium hydrides is typically achieved through the reaction of zirconium tetrachloride with hydrazine hydrate in the presence of silica supports."
[2] "Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are prepared via the reaction of thorium dioxide with hydrazine hydrate in an alumina matrix."
[3] "In the context of C-H bond activation, both zirconium and thorium hydrides facilitate H/D exchange and alkane metathesis through the coordination of the hydride species to the metal center."
[4] "The mechanism involves the σ-bond metathesis of the C-H bond, hydrogenolysis of the hydride, and chain walking, which leads to the rearrangement of alkane chains."
[5] "The rates of these reactions depend on factors such as temperature, the nature of the support, and the concentration of the metal hydride."
[6] "Selectivity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis can be influenced by the electronic properties of the metal and the support, as well as the presence of functional groups in the alkane substrate."
[7] "The roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are crucial in the activation of C-H bonds, leading to the production of products with altered chain lengths or hydrogen isotopes."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are prepared through reactions involving zirconium tetrachloride and hydrazine hydrate for zirconium hydrides, and thorium dioxide and hydrazine hydrate for thorium hydrides, with both being conducted in the presence of silica or alumina supports. These hydrides enable H/D exchange and alkane metathesis through coordination of the hydride species to the metal center. The mechanism includes σ-bond metathesis of C-H bonds, hydrogenolysis of hydrides, and chain walking, which rearranges alkane chains. The rates of these reactions are influenced by temperature, the nature of the support, and the concentration of the metal hydride. Selectivity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis can be affected by the electronic properties of the metal and support, as well as functional groups in the alkane substrate. The key roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are essential in activating C-H bonds to produce products with changed chain lengths or hydrogen isotopes.

硅基支持的锆化氢和氧化铝基支持的钍化氢是通过四氯锆酸盐与肼水合物的反应制备得到的，用于锆化氢，以及二氧化钍与肼水合物在氧化铝载体上的反应用于钍化氢。这两种化氢通过金属中心对氢化物种的配位来实现H/D交换和烷烃裂解。机制包括C-H键的σ键异构化、氢化物的氢解和链行走，这导致烷烃链的重新排列。这些反应的速度受温度、支撑材料的性质和金属氢化物浓度的影响。H/D交换和烷烃裂解的选择性可以受到金属和支撑材料的电子性质的影响，以及烷烃基质中的功能团的影响。σ键异构化、氢解和链行走的关键作用对于激活C-H键并产生具有改变链长度或氢同位素的产品至关重要。
