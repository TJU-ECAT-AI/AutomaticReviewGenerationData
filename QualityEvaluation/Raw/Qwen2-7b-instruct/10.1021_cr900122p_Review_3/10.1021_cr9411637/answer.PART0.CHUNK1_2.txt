Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, we find contrasting preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. These catalysts are employed in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, where mechanisms involve σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Reaction rates and selectivity are crucial indicators of their effectiveness. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides display faster reaction rates but lower selectivity, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides offer slower reaction rates but higher selectivity.

对比二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键活化反应中的应用，我们发现它们在制备、结构和催化性质上有显著差异。这些催化剂用于H/D交换和烷烃裂合，其机制涉及σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走。反应速率和选择性是评估这些催化剂效果的关键指标。二氧化硅支持的锆化氢显示出更快的反应速率但较低的选择性，而氧化铝支持的钍化氢则提供了较慢的反应速率但更高的选择性。
