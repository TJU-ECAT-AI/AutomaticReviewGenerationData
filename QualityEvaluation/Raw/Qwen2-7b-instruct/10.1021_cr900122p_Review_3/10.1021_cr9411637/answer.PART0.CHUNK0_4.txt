[1] "A detailed analysis of the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions was conducted."
[2] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides typically exhibit faster reaction rates in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis processes due to their higher surface area and better dispersion of the active metal hydride."
[3] "Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, offer superior selectivity in C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in hydrogenolysis and chain walking processes."
[4] "The role of σ-bond metathesis is prominent in the catalytic activity of silica-supported zirconium hydrides, enhancing the efficiency of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis."
[5] "Hydrogenolysis plays a critical role in the catalytic performance of alumina-supported thorium hydrides, contributing significantly to the selectivity of C-H bond activation."

Comparisons of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions reveal distinct characteristics. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrate faster reaction rates in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis due to their high surface area and efficient dispersion of the active metal hydride. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides showcase superior selectivity in C-H bond activation, especially in hydrogenolysis and chain walking processes. The role of σ-bond metathesis is pivotal in enhancing the efficiency of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis in silica-supported zirconium hydrides. Meanwhile, hydrogenolysis is a critical factor contributing to the high selectivity of alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation.
