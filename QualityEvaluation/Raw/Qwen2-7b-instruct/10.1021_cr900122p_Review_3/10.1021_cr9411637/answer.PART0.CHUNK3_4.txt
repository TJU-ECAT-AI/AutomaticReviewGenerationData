[1] "With the aromatization of propane, Price and Kanazirev454 observed very long induction periods (up to 24 h) for ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts."
[2] "The authors ascribed this effect to the slow reduction process creating redispersed active Ga+ species that migrate into the zeolite interior where a solid-state ion exchange occurs."
[3] "Pretreatment of the freshly prepared catalyst with hydrogen at elevated temperatures was found to shorten the induction period and to increase activity."
[4] "This kind of thermal pretreatment obviously anticipates reduction/redispersion of Ga species otherwise proceeding in the early stages of the catalytic reaction."
[5] "Considering the magnitude of distances (several micrometers) to be bridged by migration of gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it seems reasonable to modify the concept of bifunctional configuration of active sites based on adjacent gallium species and acidic protons."

The aromatization of propane with β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a long induction period, typically up to 24 hours. This is attributed to a slow reduction process causing the dispersion of gallium species, which migrate into the zeolite and undergo a solid-state ion exchange. Pretreatment of the catalyst with hydrogen at high temperatures reduces this induction period and enhances activity. Given the significant distances between the gallium species in the cocatalyst and the zeolite, the traditional concept of bifunctional configuration needs to be reconsidered to accommodate the proximity of gallium species and acidic protons.

丙烷的芳香化使用β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要很长的诱导期，通常为24小时。这归因于缓慢的还原过程导致镓物种分散，并迁移到沸石内部，在那里发生固态离子交换。在高温下对催化剂进行氢处理可以缩短诱导期并提高活性。考虑到镓物种在共催化剂和沸石之间的巨大距离，需要重新考虑双功能配置的概念，以适应相邻镓物种和酸性质子的接近。

[3] "Both a monofunctional and a bifunctional activation have been proposed."
[4] "The monofunctional activation of alkanes by a direct protonation of CC or CH bonds requires superacidic sites and gives rise to carbonium ions which rearrange to carbenium ions."
[5] "Analyzing initial product selectivities, Kwak et al.458 found that the addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has no essential effect on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but increases the dehydrogenation rate 7.7-fold (T = 803 K)."

For propane, the most commonly used alkane in aromatization studies, detailed suggestions and possibilities for catalytic activation are illustrated in Figure 78. Both monofunctional and bifunctional activation mechanisms have been proposed. Monofunctional activation involves direct protonation of CC or CH bonds at superacidic sites, leading to the formation of carbonium ions that rearrange into carbenium ions. Kwak et al. found that adding gallium to H-ZSM-5 catalysts has little impact on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but significantly increases the dehydrogenation rate (7.7 times) at 803 K.

对于丙烷，广泛应用于芳构化的最常用烷烃，在图78中详细描述了其催化活化的一些建议和可能性。提出了单功能和双功能激活机制两种。单功能激活涉及直接对CC或CH键的质子化，在超强酸性位点上产生碳正离子，这些碳正离子重组为碳烯正离子。Kwak等人发现，在H-ZSM-5催化剂中添加镓对丙烷裂解（甲烷和乙烯等摩尔形成）的速率影响不大，但在803 K时将脱氢化速率提高了7.7倍。

[1] "The bifunctional activation pathway comprises the concerted action of acid sites of the framework and those located at nonframework gallium."

The bifunctional activation pathway involves the collaborative action of framework acid sites and those located at non-framework gallium sites. In a bifunctional process, a Brnsted site can be assisted by a gallium site to dehydrogenate an incoming alkane. Kwak et al. found that adding gallium to H-ZSM-5 has little impact on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but significantly increases the dehydrogenation rate (7.7 times) at 803 K.

双功能激活途径包括框架酸性位点和位于非框架镓位置的酸性位点的协作作用。在双功能过程中，一个Brnsted位点可以通过一个镓位点来帮助脱氢化进入的烷烃。Kwak等人发现，在H-ZSM-5中添加镓对丙烷裂解（甲烷和乙烯等摩尔形成）的影响不大，但在803 K时将脱氢化速率提高了7.7倍。
