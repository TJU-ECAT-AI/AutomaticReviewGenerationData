[1] "In this spectral range, absorption bands of stretching vibrations of the terminal silanol groups of acid-bridging GaO(H)Si groups and of the OH groups located at nonframework gallium species appear."
[2] "The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions."
[3] "For [Al]-ZSM-5, a systematic shift of the asymmetric TOT stretching vibration is known to be dependent on the Al content in framework positions."
[4] "The shift of the TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers after isomorphous substitution of Si by larger atoms is due to the change in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the lengthening of the TO bond by large T atoms."
[5] "The adsorption of ammonia, 2-propanol, and 2-propanamine over H[Ga]-ZSM-5 has been examined through temperature-programmed desorption and thermogravimetric analysis."

1. In the infrared region, there are absorption bands of stretching vibrations of silanol groups connected to gallium and hydroxyl groups attached to gallium species not embedded in the framework. These vibrations confirm the incorporation of gallium into the zeolite structure.

2. The presence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations demonstrates that gallium is integrated into the zeolite's framework structure.

3. The asymmetric TOT stretching vibration in [Al]-ZSM-5 shifts systematically with the aluminum content in the framework positions.

4. The shift in the TOT framework vibration frequency towards lower wavenumbers after replacing silicon with larger atoms is attributed to alterations in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the elongation of the TO bond due to the larger atoms.

5. Ammonia, 2-propanol, and 2-propanamine have been adsorbed onto H[Ga]-ZSM-5 through temperature-programmed desorption and thermogravimetric analysis.

1. 在红外区域，酸桥接的GaO(H)Si基团和非框架结构的镓物种上的羟基上出现了伸缩振动吸收带。这些振动表明镓已集成到沸石骨架中。

2. SiOHGa伸缩振动的存在证明了镓被整合到沸石的骨架结构中。

3. [Al]-ZSM-5中的异构TOT伸缩振动的位移与框架位置中的铝含量成系统性变化。

4. 在用较大的原子替换硅后，TOT框架振动频率向较低波数的位移归因于SiOT谐振子质量减小的变化以及TO键由于较大原子的延长而产生。

5. 通过温度程序脱附和热重分析的方法，氨、2-丙醇和2-丙胺已被吸附至H[Ga]-ZSM-5。
