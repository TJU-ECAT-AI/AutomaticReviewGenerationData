[1] "In the presence of steaming, the activity for n-butane cracking proceeds through a maximum depending on the steaming time."
[2] "Results of K+ ion-exchange capacity confirmed the complete incorporation of gallium into framework positions."
[3] "This kind of thermal pretreatment obviously anticipates reduction/redispersion of Ga species otherwise proceeding in the early stages of the catalytic reaction."
[4] "The more intimately Ga2O3 and H-ZSM-5 are mixed, the faster proceeds reduction."
[5] "Conversion of propane and selectivity to aromatics run through a maximum with changing degrees of replacement of H+ by Ga+."
[6] "Analyzing initial product selectivities, Kwak et al. found that the addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has no essential effect on the rate of propane cracking but increases the dehydrogenation rate 7.7-fold."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The activity of n-butane cracking reaches its peak based on the steaming time duration.
2. The K+ ion-exchange capacity test proved the full integration of gallium into the framework structure.
3. Thermal pretreatment facilitates the redispersion of gallium species that would otherwise undergo dispersion in the early catalytic reaction stages.
4. The faster reduction occurs when Ga2O3 and H-ZSM-5 are more intimately combined.
5. The optimal conversion of propane and the preference for aromatic products occur with varying proportions of hydrogen replaced by gallium.
6. Ga addition to H-ZSM-5 notably enhances the dehydrogenation rate of propane, without affecting the cracking rate.
