[1] "The phenomenon of isomorphous substitution is well-known in the field of mineralogy. 5,6 By isomorphous substitution, framework atoms of crystalline compounds are replaced by atoms of other elements without changing the type of the crystal structure. 7"
[2] "Altogether, the structural diversity of zeolites discussed above is responsible for a wide range of interesting zeolite properties such as ion-exchange capacity, specific adsorption behavior, catalytic activity due to acidity, shape selectivity caused by size and polarity of molecules, high thermal stability and resistance against solvents, and wide flexibility for adjustments by isomorphous substitution of framework constituents."
[3] "The thermodynamics of isomorphous substitution have been considered by Barrer. 10 Ione and Vostrikova 11 summarized the main factors governing the isomorphous substitution as follows."

The isomorphous substitution of elements into zeolite frameworks leads to a wide range of interesting properties, including ion-exchange capacity, specific adsorption behavior, catalytic activity, shape selectivity, thermal stability, and flexibility for adjustments. This process is governed by factors such as the difference in atomic radii, coordination number, electronegativity, and ionization potential of the substituting elements.
