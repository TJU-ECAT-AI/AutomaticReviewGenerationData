[1] "Methanol is a versatile basic chemical."
[2] "Its application as alkylating agent for the transformation of aromatics was described in section VI.B."
[3] "The production of the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) by the acid-catalyzed equilibrium reaction of methanol and isobutene over ion-exchange resin catalysts at low temperatures (330350 K) consumed more than 20 million tons in 1994."
[4] "Applications of Ga-based zeolite catalysts are not very numerous, as can be seen from Table 24."

The literature provides limited information on the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text focuses mainly on methanol chemistry, particularly its applications in alkylating agents and production of gasoline additives. It mentions the use of Ga-based zeolite catalysts, but does not detail the preparation, structure, or specific catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions.
