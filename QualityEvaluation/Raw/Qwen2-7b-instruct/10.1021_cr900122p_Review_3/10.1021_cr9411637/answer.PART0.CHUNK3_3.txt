C-H bond activation reactions involving silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are characterized by the mechanisms of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. These processes enable H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Reaction rates are influenced by catalyst structure, surface area, and functional group presence. Selectivity can be tuned through catalyst composition and operating conditions. For H/D exchange, deuteration selectivity improves with optimized catalyst loading or temperature. In alkane metathesis, σ-bond metathesis drives new alkane formation. Hydrogenolysis breaks C-H bonds, impacting product diversity. Chain walking enables alkyl group movement, affecting product distribution. Understanding these mechanisms is key to designing catalysts with enhanced performance.
