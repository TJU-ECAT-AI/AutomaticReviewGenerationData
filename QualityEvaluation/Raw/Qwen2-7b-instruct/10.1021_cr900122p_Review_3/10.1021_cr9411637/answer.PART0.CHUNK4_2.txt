1. Methanol is utilized as an alkylating agent for the transformation of aromatics, as detailed in section VI.B.

2. Over 20 million tons of gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were produced in 1994 through the acid-catalyzed equilibrium reaction of methanol and isobutene over ion-exchange resin catalysts at low temperatures.

3. There are not many applications of Ga-based zeolite catalysts, as shown in Table 24.

4. Inui tested a wide range of Al-free ZSM-5 catalysts containing Ga, Cr, V, Sc, Ge, Mn, La, Al, Ni, Zr, Ti, Fe, Co, and Pt at Si/Me ratios less than 3200.

5. In Ga-modified ZSM-5, besides aliphatics, aromatics are also produced as reaction products. 

6. Ga-modified ZSM-5 predominantly generates C5-C11 aliphatics.

7. Ga-modified ZSM-5 predominantly generates C5-C11 aliphatics.

8. Ga-modified ZSM-5 predominantly generates C5-C11 aliphatics.

1. 甲醇被用作芳烃转化的烷基化剂，详情见第VI.B节。

2. 1994年，通过离子交换树脂催化剂在低温下进行的甲醇和异丁烯的酸催化平衡反应生产了超过2000万吨的汽油添加剂甲基叔丁基醚（MTBE）。

3. Ga基沸石催化剂的应用并不多，从表24可以看出。

4. Inui测试了一系列含Ga、Cr、V、Sc、Ge、Mn、La、Al、Ni、Zr、Ti、Fe、Co和Pt的Al-free ZSM-5催化剂，其Si/Me比小于3200。

5. 在Ga改性ZSM-5中，除了烷烃，还有芳香烃作为反应产物产生。

6. Ga改性ZSM-5主要生成C5-C11烷烃。

7. Ga改性ZSM-5主要生成C5-C11烷烃。

8. Ga改性ZSM-5主要生成C5-C11烷烃。
