[7] "The positions of bands shift with changing composition depending on the kind and the content of the framework atoms."
[8] "The shift of the TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers after isomorphous substitution of Si by larger atoms is due to the change in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the lengthening of the TO bond by large T atoms."
