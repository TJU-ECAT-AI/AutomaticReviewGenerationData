The preparation of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides involves the use of supported metal hydride catalysts. Silica supports are used for zirconium hydrides, while alumina supports are used for thorium hydrides. In both cases, the metal hydride is immobilized onto the support through a chemical bonding process. The catalysts are typically prepared by impregnation of the metal hydride onto the support using aqueous solutions of the metal salt. 

The structure of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides is characterized by the distribution of the metal hydride on the surface of the support. Silica supports allow for the formation of mesoporous structures, which can provide high surface areas for better contact between the catalyst and the reactants. Alumina supports provide a more rigid structure that can withstand higher temperatures.

In terms of catalytic properties, silica-supported zirconium hydrides are effective in C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange reactions. The mechanism involves the formation of a zirconium-bound hydrogen species that abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate. The zirconium-bound hydrogen then inserts into the C-H bond, leading to the formation of a hydroxylated product. The reaction rate is influenced by the surface area of the silica support, with higher surface areas providing faster reaction rates.

Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, are used in alkane metathesis reactions. The mechanism involves the migration of a thorium-bound alkene species along the surface of the alumina support, which facilitates the exchange of alkene fragments. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the stability of the thorium-bound alkene species and the diffusion rate on the alumina surface. Chain walking is a key feature in these reactions, allowing for the sequential transfer of alkene fragments to produce longer alkane chains.

Both catalysts show high selectivity in their respective reactions, with the role of σ-bond metathesis being crucial in alkane metathesis. Hydrogenolysis plays a significant role in H/D exchange reactions, where the hydrogen bound to the metal hydride abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate. The catalysts' performance is also influenced by the support's properties, such as its thermal stability and surface chemistry.

制备硅酸盐支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢涉及使用支持金属氢化物催化剂。硅酸盐用于锆化氢，而氧化铝用于钍化氢。两种情况下，金属氢化物通过化学键合过程固定在支撑物上。通常，通过水溶液中的金属盐浸渍方法来准备催化剂。

硅酸盐支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢的结构特征在于金属氢化物在支撑物表面的分布。硅酸盐支持允许形成介孔结构，可以提供更高的比表面积，以便催化剂与反应物更好的接触。氧化铝支持则提供更坚硬的结构，可以承受更高的温度。

从催化性能来看，硅酸盐支持的锆化氢在C-H键激活反应中非常有效，特别是H/D交换反应。其机制涉及形成与锆结合的氢物种，该物种从基质中提取一个氢原子。然后，锆结合的氢插入到C-H键中，产生一个羟基化产物。反应速率受到硅酸盐支持物比表面积的影响，较高的比表面积提供更快的反应速率。

另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍化氢用于烷烃的裂合反应。其机制涉及沿氧化铝表面迁移的钍结合的烯烃物种，这促进了烯烃片段的交换。选择性由钍结合的烯烃物种的稳定性以及在氧化铝表面的扩散速率决定。链走动是这些反应的关键特性，允许沿着表面进行烯烃片段的顺序传输以产生更长的烷烃链。

这两种催化剂在各自的反应中都表现出高选择性，σ键裂合在烷烃裂合反应中起着关键作用。在H/D交换反应中，金属氢化物结合的氢原子从基质中提取一个氢原子。催化剂的性能还受到支持物性质的影响，如热稳定性和表面化学性质。
