[1] "Generally, the detection of Brnsted acid sites in a gallosilicate structure is an indication that gallium has entered tetrahedral framework positions."
[2] "The adsorption of ammonia, 2-propanol, and 2-propanamine over H[Ga]-ZSM-5 has been examined through temperature-programmed desorption and thermogravimetric analysis."
[3] "As observed with the MFI structure ZSM-5, Ga analogues of other zeolite structures show a shift of the stretching IR vibration of Brnsted acid sites to higher values as compared with pure aluminosilicate structures."
[4] "TPDA profiles with two peaks are received. Inui et al. 221 presented TPDA profiles of modified MFI structures obtained from thermogravimetric studies after adsorption of ammonia at 353 K and subsequent desorption at a heating rate of 20 K min-1."

Gallium incorporation into zeolite framework positions is indicated by the detection of Brnsted acid sites. Ammonia, 2-propanol, and 2-propanamine adsorption studies have been conducted over H[Ga]-ZSM-5 through temperature-programmed desorption and thermogravimetric analysis. In Ga analogues of other zeolite structures, the stretching IR vibration of Brnsted acid sites shifts to higher values compared to pure aluminosilicates. TPDA profiles for modified MFI structures, after ammonia adsorption at 353 K and subsequent desorption at 20 K/min, have been presented by Inui et al.

在高岭石结构中，镓嵌入到框架位置通常被检测到酸性布伦斯特位点作为指示。通过温度程序脱附和热重分析，对氨、2-丙醇和2-丙胺在H[Ga]-ZSM-5上的吸附进行了研究。在其他高岭石结构的镓衍生物中，Brnsted酸性位点的红外拉伸振动的频率相较于纯硅酸盐体系更高。Inui等人报告了在353 K下氨吸附后，在随后以20 K/min的加热速率进行脱附的MFI结构的TPDA谱图。
