[1] "The synthesis of these new materials is achieved by combining an appropriate surfactant molecule, usually hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide or hydroxide (CTABr or CTAOH) with a silicon source like SiO2, silica sol, water glass, or tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in aqueous solution."
[2] "The mechanism of the formation of mesostructured M41S-type silicates (Figure 63) is still under discussion, and probably different routes are possible depending on the synthesis conditions."
[3] "The presence of large amounts of silanol groups is confirmed by IR OH vibration spectra. Three types of silanol groups are found: terminal (vibrating at 3740 cm-1), internal H-bound (3710 cm-1), and associated silanol groups giving rise to a broad absorption band between 3400 and 3600 cm-1."
[4] "The use of CO and C2H4 as probe molecules allowed a classification of the terminal hydroxyl groups with regard to their acid character. Accordingly, POH groups should be of medium Brnsted acidity (H0 = 6) and GaOH groups exhibit weak acidity (H0 = 3)."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are both catalysts used in C-H bond activation reactions. However, the document does not provide a direct comparison between the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of these two types of hydrides. 

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are synthesized by combining silica with zirconium hydride. The mechanism of their formation is still under discussion, and different routes are possible depending on the synthesis conditions. The document mentions that large amounts of silanol groups are present in mesoporous silicas, which could affect the catalytic properties. The silanol groups can be classified based on their acid character, with terminal hydroxyl groups being of medium Brnsted acidity and GaOH groups exhibiting weak acidity.

Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, are synthesized by combining alumina with thorium hydride. The document does not provide details about the preparation or structure of these hydrides. However, it does discuss the classification of terminal hydroxyl groups in the context of a material called cloverite, which contains large cavities and a complex framework built of double four-rings with alternating Ga and P atoms. The hydroxyl groups in cloverite are classified as medium Brnsted acidity (terminal POH groups) and weak acidity (GaOH groups).

In terms of catalytic properties, the document does not provide specific information on the reaction rates, selectivity, or mechanisms of activation for either silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It is mentioned that the presence of silanol groups in silica supports could influence the catalytic activity, and that the classification of hydroxyl groups in cloverite suggests that both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites are present, which could facilitate C-H bond activation. However, the role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes is not discussed.

Answer: The document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. It discusses the synthesis and properties of mesoporous silicas, the classification of hydroxyl groups in cloverite, and the potential role of silanol groups in catalytic activity. However, specific details on the mechanisms of activation, reaction rates, selectivity, and the involvement of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are not provided.

硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢是用于C-H键活化的催化剂。然而，文档没有提供这两种类型化氢之间的直接比较。

硅支持的锆化氢通过将硅与锆化氢结合合成。它们的形成机制仍在讨论中，可能取决于合成条件的不同路径。文档提到，在微孔硅中存在大量硅醇基团，这可能会影响催化性能。硅醇基团可以根据其酸性特征进行分类，终端羟基为中等Brnsted酸性（H0 = 6），而GaOH基团表现出弱酸性（H0 = 3）。

另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍化氢通过将氧化铝与钍化氢结合合成。文档没有提供这些氢化物的制备或结构细节。然而，它确实讨论了在称为“cloverite”的材料中的羟基分类，该材料包含大型腔室和由交替的Ga和P原子的双四环组成的复杂框架。cloverite中的羟基被分类为中等Brnsted酸性（终端POH基团）和弱酸性（GaOH基团）。

关于催化性能，文档没有提供关于两种硅支持的锆化氢或氧化铝支持的钍化氢的具体信息，包括反应速率、选择性和激活机制。文档提到了硅支持材料中硅醇基团的存在可能影响催化活性，并且在cloverite中分类的羟基表明存在Brnsted和Lewis酸位点，这可能促进C-H键活化。但是，σ键异构化、氢解离和链行走在这些过程中的作用并未讨论。

答案：文档没有提供硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键活化反应中的全面比较。它讨论了微孔硅的合成和性质、cloverite中羟基的分类以及硅醇基团可能对催化活性的影响。然而，特定细节如激活机制、反应速率、选择性和σ键异构化、氢解离和链行走的作用并未提供。
