If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document does not provide a direct comparison of the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, including their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. It focuses on the characterization of surface organometallic complexes using high resolution 2D solid-state NMR spectroscopy, specifically applying this technique to the full characterization of a silica-supported metal carbyne. For a comprehensive comparison, one would need access to additional research articles or databases that specifically address the catalytic properties and mechanisms of these materials.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Silica-supported metal carbynes, such as SiOMo(CBu-t)(CH2Bu-t)2, have been characterized using high resolution 2D solid-state NMR spectroscopy. This technique allows for detailed characterization of surface organometallic complexes. The focus is on the catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The characterization includes discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the mechanisms involved in processes such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Answer: There are no specific details provided in the literature regarding the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, nor their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Therefore, it is not possible to compare and contrast these aspects based on the information available in the document.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答案：文献中没有提供关于二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质的具体信息，也无法比较它们在H/D交换和烷烃裂解过程中的机制。因此，无法根据文档中的信息来对比这些方面。
