Silica-supported metal carbynes, such as SiOMo(CBu-t)(CH2Bu-t)2, have been characterized using high resolution 2D solid-state NMR spectroscopy. This technique allows for detailed characterization of surface organometallic complexes. The focus is on the catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The characterization includes discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the mechanisms involved in processes such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking.
