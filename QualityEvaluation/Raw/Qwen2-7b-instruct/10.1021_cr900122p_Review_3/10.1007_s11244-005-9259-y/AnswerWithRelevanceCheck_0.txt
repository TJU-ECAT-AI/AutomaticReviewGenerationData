          [1] "Among such processes are the olefin polymerization [17], hydrogenation of olefins [8], isotope exchange in alkanes [9], as well as hydroisomerization and hydrog- enolysis of alkanes [1014]."
          [2] "Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the processes involving the formation and the cleavage of the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions."
          [3] "Among those, the formation of M(III) hydrides was hypothesized [1] and subsequently detected [57]."
          [4] "The real catalytic system always contains a rather large amount of Zr(III) compounds, among those the presence of Zr(III) hydrides was detected [5,7]."
          [5] "The unique ability of these systems to catalyze both processes depending on the presence of hydrogen in the system was rationalized."
          [6] "We have shown that different catalytic processes occur involving different surface hydrides."
          [7] "Since the amount of monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH present in the system is always much larger than that of dihydrides, the former should be considered as the major catalytic species for the polymerization reaction."
          [8] "Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable."
          [9] "In contrast to this, the dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably proved earlier [4,8]), can act as the catalysts of hydrog- enolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al. [911]."
          [10] "The main distinctions between dihydrides and monohydrides are a higher degree of coordinative unsaturation of the Zr atom and the presence of an additional site for binding the substrate in the former."
          [11] "Relatively high degree of coordinative unsaturation of the surface species in all the systems studied is respon- sible for rather low regioselectivity of the process."
          [12] "Earlier [18], we have shown that the activation energy for isotope exchange in methane on zirconium hydrides reported in the experimental study by Hall et al. [9] is somewhat lower than the energy barrier to the reaction of dihydrides with the methane molecule obtained from our calculations (7 vs. 911 kcal mol)1, respectively)."
          [13] "Despite the fact that Basset et al. reliably proved that monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH were the major type of the surface metal hydrides in the samples of catalysts employed in their study [10], we believe that additional experimental investigations are required."

          The provided answers discuss the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in the context of C-H bond activation reactions. They cover topics such as olefin polymerization, hydrogenation of olefins, isotope exchange in alkanes, hydroisomerization, and hydrogenolysis of alkanes. The answers highlight the unique ability of these systems to catalyze both processes depending on the presence of hydrogen, the roles of different surface hydrides, and the differences between monohydrides and dihydrides in terms of their catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and mechanisms involving σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The answers also touch upon reaction rates, selectivity, and the importance of the high degree of coordinative unsaturation in determining the regioselectivity of the processes.

          [1] "Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are typically prepared by coating the surface of partially dehydroxylated silica with organometallic compounds containing zirconium, followed by heating under hydrogen conditions."
          [2] "Structure: Zirconium hydrides often exist as monohydrides (ZrH) and dihydrides (ZrH2) on silica supports, whereas thorium hydrides could potentially form trivalent hydrides (ThH3) on alumina."
          [3] "Catalytic properties: In C-H bond activation, silica-supported zirconium hydrides can facilitate processes like olefin polymerization and hydrogenolysis of alkanes. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides may enable similar reactions, with the potential for enhanced stability or selectivity due to the different support materials."
          [4] "Mechanisms: Reaction mechanisms involve σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. For both systems, these processes can lead to the formation of olefin polymers, the cleavage of alkanes, or the isotope exchange in methane."
          [5] "Rates: Rates of reactions can vary significantly based on factors such as the presence of hydrogen, substrate type, and the specific hydride species involved."
          [6] "Selectivity: Low regioselectivity is characteristic of reactions involving highly coordinated zirconium and thorium species. This aligns with experimental observations showing mixtures of products in hydrogenolysis of alkanes and polyethylene formation."
          [7] "Roles: In both systems, the role of σ-bond metathesis is crucial for alkane metathesis, while hydrogenolysis facilitates the cleavage of C-H bonds. Chain walking is a key aspect of olefin polymerization on both zirconium and thorium hydrides."

          The provided answers offer insights into the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in the context of C-H bond activation reactions. They describe the typical preparation method of zirconium hydrides on silica, the common forms of zirconium hydrides (monohydrides and dihydrides) on silica supports, and the potential formation of trivalent hydrides on alumina for thorium. The answers discuss how these catalysts facilitate reactions such as olefin polymerization and hydrogenolysis of alkanes, highlighting the potential for enhanced stability or selectivity in alumina-supported thorium hydrides due to the different support materials. The mechanisms underlying these reactions involve σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, leading to the formation of olefin polymers, cleavage of alkanes, or isotope exchange in methane. The answers also address the variability of reaction rates based on factors like hydrogen presence, substrate type, and hydride species, along with the characteristic low regioselectivity of reactions involving highly coordinated zirconium and thorium species. The roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in the catalytic processes are emphasized, particularly in the context of alkane metathesis and olefin polymerization on both zirconium and thorium hydrides.
