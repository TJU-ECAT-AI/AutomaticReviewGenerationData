<p>The model reactions of ethylene polymerization and hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes (propane, n-butane, and n-pentane) on the silica-supported zirconium hydrides (BSiAO)3ZrIVH, (BSiAO)2ZrIVH2, and (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH were studied using the DFT approach.</p>
<p>Catalytic processes under study were shown to occur involving different surface hydrides.</p>
<p>The ethylene polymerization was found to proceed at comparable rates on the zirconium monohydrides, (BSiAO)3ZrH, and dihydrides, (BSiAO)2ZrH2.</p>
<p>Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable; however, the dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2 can act as catalysts of the process under mild conditions.</p>
<p>A feature of all the systems studied is low regioselectivity of the corresponding processes.</p>
<p>Despite a considerable body of experimental data on these systems, it is still unclear which species are responsible for the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Among those, the formation of M(III) hydrides was hypothesized [1] and subsequently detected [57].</p>
<p>It was found that the calculated activation parameters of the reactions involving zirconium dihydrides are in better agreement with those reported in the experimental study by Hall et al. [9].</p>
<p>The reasons are as follows. First, the electronic properties of the fluorine atoms are similar to those of the oxygen atoms in the OSi fragment.</p>
<p>Second, in contrast to the OH fragment, the fluorine atoms are incapable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which distort the structure of the model species.</p>
<p>Third, we have also studied a number of less constrained models and found that the energies and thermodynamic parameters of the reaction intermediates are only slightly dependent on the choice of the model.</p>
<p>It should be noted that subsequent interaction of 17 with the next ethylene molecule can result in insertion of ethylene both into the ZrAEt bond to give a dibutyl derivative and into the ZrABu bond to give an ethyl-hexyl derivative.</p>
<p>Analysis of the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of these channels shows their proximity.</p>
<p>The real catalytic system always contains a rather large amount of Zr(III) compounds, among those the presence of Zr(III) hydrides was detected [5,7].</p>
<p>Therefore, we considered compound 3 as a possible model of the surface hydride (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH and estimated the possibility for ethylene polymerization to occur on the Zr(III) hydride species.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the rates of both processes at room temperature are rather high for both monohydrides 1 and dihydrides 2, since the catalytic species provide the possibility for insertion of only one ethylene molecule at each instance of time.</p>
<p>The energy barriers to the limiting stage of the reaction 18 ! 27 ! 14 (1.0  10)11 s)1 for T  298 K and 6.3  10)6 s)1 for T  423 K) and of the equilibrium between 18 and 14 (2.4  105 for T  298 K and 1.1  104 for T  423 K) suggest that hydrogenolysis of butane on dihydrides 2 is thermodynamically allowed and can occur at rather high rates at the elevated temperatures (423 K).</p>
<p>Moreover, the process turns out to be thermodynamically favorable in the case of the b-methyl transfer (a, c) compared to the b-ethyl transfer (b, d).</p>

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides were studied for their catalytic properties in ethylene polymerization and hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes. Different surface hydrides were involved in these processes. Ethylene polymerization occurred at comparable rates on zirconium monohydrides and dihydrides. Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides was thermodynamically unfavorable, but dihydrides could act as catalysts under mild conditions. The systems showed low regioselectivity. The catalytic activity was unclear, with zirconium(III) hydrides being hypothesized. The calculated activation parameters matched experimental studies better for zirconium dihydrides. The electronic properties of fluorine atoms influenced the structure and electronic properties of the model species. The catalytic processes involved different mechanisms, including hydrogenolysis, chain walking, and σ-bond metathesis. The rates of the processes were high at room temperature for both monohydrides and dihydrides. The hydrogenolysis of butane on dihydrides was thermodynamically allowed and occurred at high rates, especially with the b-methyl transfer being more favorable than the b-ethyl transfer.

在研究中，我们对二氧化硅支持的锆化氢进行了研究，以了解它们在乙烯聚合和线性烷烃氢解过程中的催化性质。不同的表面氢化物参与了这些过程。乙烯聚合在锆单氢化物和二氢化物上发生相似速率。线性烷烃在单氢化物上的氢解是热力学不利的，但二氢化物可以在温和条件下作为催化剂。系统显示出较低的区域选择性。催化活性不清楚，锆(III)氢化物被假设存在。计算的活化参数与实验研究匹配得更好对于锆二氢化物。氟原子的电子属性影响了模型物种的结构和电子性质。催化过程涉及不同的机制，包括氢解、链行走和σ键互换。过程在室温下具有较高的速率对于单氢化物和二氢化物。但烷基转移比乙基转移更有利于但烷基的氢解在二氢化物上进行，特别是在较高温度（423 K）下。
