          [1] "Among such processes are the olefin polymerization [17], hydrogenation of olefins [8], isotope exchange in alkanes [9], as well as hydroisomerization and hydrog- enolysis of alkanes [1014]."
          [2] "Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the processes involving the formation and the cleavage of the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions."
          [3] "Among those, the formation of M(III) hydrides was hypothesized [1] and subsequently detected [57]."
          [4] "The real catalytic system always contains a rather large amount of Zr(III) compounds, among those the presence of Zr(III) hydrides was detected [5,7]."
          [5] "The unique ability of these systems to catalyze both processes depending on the presence of hydrogen in the system was rationalized."
          [6] "We have shown that different catalytic processes occur involving different surface hydrides."
          [7] "Since the amount of monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH present in the system is always much larger than that of dihydrides, the former should be considered as the major catalytic species for the polymerization reaction."
          [8] "Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable."
          [9] "In contrast to this, the dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably proved earlier [4,8]), can act as the catalysts of hydrog- enolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al. [911]."
          [10] "The main distinctions between dihydrides and monohydrides are a higher degree of coordinative unsaturation of the Zr atom and the presence of an additional site for binding the substrate in the former."
          [11] "Relatively high degree of coordinative unsaturation of the surface species in all the systems studied is respon- sible for rather low regioselectivity of the process."
          [12] "Earlier [18], we have shown that the activation energy for isotope exchange in methane on zirconium hydrides reported in the experimental study by Hall et al. [9] is somewhat lower than the energy barrier to the reaction of dihydrides with the methane molecule obtained from our calculations (7 vs. 911 kcal mol)1, respectively)."
          [13] "Despite the fact that Basset et al. reliably proved that monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH were the major type of the surface metal hydrides in the samples of catalysts employed in their study [10], we believe that additional experimental investigations are required."

          The provided answers cover a range of topics related to the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. Key points include the synthesis methods, structural differences, and mechanisms of activation processes involving σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The answers highlight the role of these catalysts in olefin polymerization, hydrogenation of olefins, isotope exchange in alkanes, hydroisomerization, and hydrogenolysis of alkanes, noting differences in reaction rates, selectivity, and the specific hydride species involved. The documents also discuss the unique ability of these systems to catalyze both formation and cleavage of C-H bonds based on the presence of hydrogen, and the role of different surface hydrides in these processes. Specific examples include the comparison of monohydrides and dihydrides, highlighting their differing catalytic properties and the impact of coordinative unsaturation on regioselectivity.

          [1] "Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are typically prepared by coating the surface of partially dehydroxylated silica with organometallic compounds containing zirconium, followed by heating under hydrogen conditions."
          [2] "Structure: Zirconium hydrides often exist as monohydrides (ZrH) and dihydrides (ZrH2) on silica supports, whereas thorium hydrides could potentially form trivalent hydrides (ThH3) on alumina."
          [3] "Catalytic properties: In C-H bond activation, silica-supported zirconium hydrides can facilitate processes like olefin polymerization and hydrogenolysis of alkanes. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides may enable similar reactions, with the potential for enhanced stability or selectivity due to the different support materials."
          [4] "Mechanisms: Reaction mechanisms involve σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. For both systems, these processes can lead to the formation of olefin polymers, the cleavage of alkanes, or the isotope exchange in methane."
          [5] "Rates: Rates of reactions can vary significantly based on factors such as the presence of hydrogen, substrate type, and the specific hydride species involved."
          [6] "Selectivity: Low regioselectivity is characteristic of reactions involving highly coordinated zirconium and thorium species. This aligns with experimental observations showing mixtures of products in hydrogenolysis of alkanes and polyethylene formation."
          [7] "Roles: In both systems, the role of σ-bond metathesis is crucial for alkane metathesis, while hydrogenolysis facilitates the cleavage of C-H bonds. Chain walking is a key aspect of olefin polymerization on both zirconium and thorium hydrides."

          提供的回答总结了二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。制备通常涉及在部分脱水的二氧化硅上涂覆含锆的有机金属化合物，并在氢条件下加热。二氧化硅支持的锆化物通常以单氢化物（ZrH）和二氢化物（ZrH2）形式存在，而钍化物可能在氧化铝上形成三价氢化物（ThH3）。在C-H键激活中，这些催化剂使如乙烯聚合和烷烃氢解等过程成为可能，由于不同的支持材料，这些过程可能表现出增强的稳定性和选择性。反应机制涉及σ键迁移、氢解和链行走，导致烯烃聚合物形成、烷烃断裂或甲烷同位素交换。反应速率可以根据氢的存在、底物类型和特定的氢化物物种等因素变化。高度协调的锆和钍物种参与的反应表现出低区域选择性，这与实验观察到的烷烃氢解和聚乙烯形成过程的混合产物结果相吻合。两个系统都依赖于σ键迁移进行烷烃的迁移，氢解促进C-H键的断裂，链行走是锆和钍氢化物上乙烯聚合的关键方面。
