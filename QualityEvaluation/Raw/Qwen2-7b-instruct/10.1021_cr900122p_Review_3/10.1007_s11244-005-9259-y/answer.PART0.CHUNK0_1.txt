[1] "Among such processes are the olefin polymerization [17], hydrogenation of olefins [8], isotope exchange in alkanes [9], as well as hydroisomerization and hydrog- enolysis of alkanes [1014]."
[2] "Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the processes involving the formation and the cleavage of the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions."
[3] "Among those, the formation of M(III) hydrides was hypothesized [1] and subsequently detected [57]."
[4] "The real catalytic system always contains a rather large amount of Zr(III) compounds, among those the presence of Zr(III) hydrides was detected [5,7]."
[5] "The unique ability of these systems to catalyze both processes depending on the presence of hydrogen in the system was rationalized."
[6] "We have shown that different catalytic processes occur involving different surface hydrides."
[7] "Since the amount of monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH present in the system is always much larger than that of dihydrides, the former should be considered as the major catalytic species for the polymerization reaction."
[8] "Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable."
[9] "In contrast to this, the dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably proved earlier [4,8]), can act as the catalysts of hydrog- enolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al. [911]."
[10] "The main distinctions between dihydrides and monohydrides are a higher degree of coordinative unsaturation of the Zr atom and the presence of an additional site for binding the substrate in the former."
[11] "Relatively high degree of coordinative unsaturation of the surface species in all the systems studied is respon- sible for rather low regioselectivity of the process."
[12] "Earlier [18], we have shown that the activation energy for isotope exchange in methane on zirconium hydrides reported in the experimental study by Hall et al. [9] is somewhat lower than the energy barrier to the reaction of dihydrides with the methane molecule obtained from our calculations (7 vs. 911 kcal mol)1, respectively)."
[13] "Despite the fact that Basset et al. reliably proved that monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH were the major type of the surface metal hydrides in the samples of catalysts employed in their study [10], we believe that additional experimental investigations are required."

1. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides are catalysts for olefin polymerization, hydrogenation of olefins, isotope exchange in alkanes, hydroisomerization, and hydrogenolysis of alkanes under mild conditions. Among these, the formation of M(III) hydrides was hypothesized and detected. 

2. The catalytic systems contain a significant amount of Zr(III) compounds, including Zr(III) hydrides, which play a role in these processes.

3. Different catalytic processes occur involving various surface hydrides, with monohydrides and dihydrides showing distinct roles in olefin polymerization and hydrogenolysis of alkanes.

4. Monohydrides are considered the major catalyst for olefin polymerization due to their abundance compared to dihydrides.

5. Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides is thermodynamically unfavorable, whereas dihydrides can act as catalysts under the same conditions as reported by Basset et al.

6. Dihydrides possess a higher degree of coordinative unsaturation and an additional substrate binding site compared to monohydrides.

7. High coordinative unsaturation across all systems leads to low regioselectivity in the processes.

8. The activation energy for isotope exchange in methane on zirconium hydrides is lower than the energy barrier for dihydrides reacting with methane.

9. Additional experimental investigations are needed to confirm the dominant role of monohydrides as catalysts, as reliably proven by Basset et al.

1. 硅基载有锆氢化物是烯烃聚合、烯烃氢化、烷烃同位素交换、异构化和烷烃氢解等过程在温和条件下催化作用的载体。其中，M(III)氢化物的形成被假设并被检测到。

2. 这些催化系统包含大量的Zr(III)化合物，包括Zr(III)氢化物，在Basset等人所用催化剂样品中可靠证明了其存在。

3. 不同的催化过程涉及不同的表面氢化物，单氢化物和二氢化物在乙烯聚合和烷烃氢解中显示出不同的作用。

4. 由于单氢化物在系统中的丰度远大于二氢化物，它们被认为是聚合反应的主要催化剂。

5. 线性烷烃在单氢化物上的氢解是热力学不利的，而二氢化物可以在与Basset等人报告的实验研究相同温度下作为催化剂发挥作用。

6. 二氢化物具有更高的配位不饱和度和额外的基团结合位点，与单氢化物相比。

7. 所有系统的高配位不饱和度导致过程的低区域选择性。

8. 对于甲烷在锆氢化物上的同位素交换的激活能低于二氢化物与甲烷反应的能量壁垒。

9. 需要额外的实验调查来确认Basset等人可靠证明的单氢化物作为主要催化剂的角色。
