          [1] "Among such processes are the olefin polymerization [17], hydrogenation of olefins [8], isotope exchange in alkanes [9], as well as hydroisomerization and hydrog- enolysis of alkanes [1014]."
          [2] "Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the processes involving the formation and the cleavage of the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions."
          [3] "Among those, the formation of M(III) hydrides was hypothesized [1] and subsequently detected [57]."
          [4] "The real catalytic system always contains a rather large amount of Zr(III) compounds, among those the presence of Zr(III) hydrides was detected [5,7]."
          [5] "The unique ability of these systems to catalyze both processes depending on the presence of hydrogen in the system was rationalized."
          [6] "We have shown that different catalytic processes occur involving different surface hydrides."
          [7] "Since the amount of monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH present in the system is always much larger than that of dihydrides, the former should be considered as the major catalytic species for the polymerization reaction."
          [8] "Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable."
          [9] "In contrast to this, the dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably proved earlier [4,8]), can act as the catalysts of hydrog- enolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al. [911]."
          [10] "The main distinctions between dihydrides and monohydrides are a higher degree of coordinative unsaturation of the Zr atom and the presence of an additional site for binding the substrate in the former."
          [11] "Relatively high degree of coordinative unsaturation of the surface species in all the systems studied is respon- sible for rather low regioselectivity of the process."
          [12] "Earlier [18], we have shown that the activation energy for isotope exchange in methane on zirconium hydrides reported in the experimental study by Hall et al. [9] is somewhat lower than the energy barrier to the reaction of dihydrides with the methane molecule obtained from our calculations (7 vs. 911 kcal mol)1, respectively)."
          [13] "Despite the fact that Basset et al. reliably proved that monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH were the major type of the surface metal hydrides in the samples of catalysts employed in their study [10], we believe that additional experimental investigations are required."

          The provided answers detail the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. These include processes such as olefin polymerization, hydrogenation of olefins, isotope exchange in alkanes, and hydroisomerization/hydrogenolysis of alkanes. The structure of the catalysts varies, with zirconium hydrides existing as monohydrides (ZrH) and dihydrides (ZrH2), and thorium hydrides potentially forming trivalent hydrides (ThH3). The catalytic properties highlight their ability to facilitate σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, leading to olefin polymerization, alkane cleavage, and isotope exchange. Reaction rates and selectivity depend on factors such as the presence of hydrogen, substrate type, and the specific hydride species. The roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are crucial in these processes. Additional experimental investigations are recommended for further clarification regarding the dominant role of monohydrides in the catalytic system.

          提供的回答阐述了二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键活化反应中的准备、结构和催化性质。这些包括如乙烯聚合、烯烃氢化、烷烃同位素交换和烷烃异构化/氢解等过程。催化剂的结构有所不同，锆化物以单氢化物（ZrH）和二氢化物（ZrH2）的形式存在，而钍化物可能形成三价氢化物（ThH3）。催化性质强调了它们促进σ键迁移、氢解和链行走的能力，导致乙烯聚合、烷烃断裂和同位素交换。反应速率和选择性取决于氢的存在、底物类型和特定氢化物物种等因素。σ键迁移、氢解和链行走在这些过程中扮演关键角色。对于确定单氢化物在催化体系中的主导作用，建议进行进一步的实验调查。
