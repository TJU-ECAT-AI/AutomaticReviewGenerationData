[1] "Among such processes are the olefin polymerization [17], hydrogenation of olefins [8], isotope exchange in alkanes [9], as well as hydroisomerization and hydrog- enolysis of alkanes [1014]."
[2] "Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the processes involving the formation and the cleavage of the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions."
[3] "Among those, the formation of M(III) hydrides was hypothesized [1] and subsequently detected [57]."
[4] "The real catalytic system always contains a rather large amount of Zr(III) compounds, among those the presence of Zr(III) hydrides was detected [5,7]."

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides were studied for their catalytic properties in ethylene polymerization and hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes. Different surface hydrides were involved in these processes. Ethylene polymerization occurred at comparable rates on zirconium monohydrides and dihydrides. Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides was thermodynamically unfavorable, but dihydrides could act as catalysts under mild conditions. The systems showed low regioselectivity. The catalytic activity was unclear, with zirconium(III) hydrides being hypothesized. The calculated activation parameters matched experimental studies better for zirconium dihydrides. The electronic properties of fluorine atoms influenced the structure and electronic properties of the model species. The catalytic processes involved different mechanisms, including hydrogenolysis, chain walking, and σ-bond metathesis. The rates of the processes were high at room temperature for both monohydrides and dihydrides. The hydrogenolysis of butane on dihydrides was thermodynamically allowed and occurred at high rates, especially with the b-methyl transfer being more favorable than the b-ethyl transfer.

The model reactions of ethylene polymerization and hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes (propane, n-butane, and n-pentane) on the silica-supported zirconium hydrides (BSiAO)3ZrIVH, (BSiAO)2ZrIVH2, and (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH were studied using the DFT approach. Catalytic processes under study were shown to occur involving different surface hydrides. The ethylene polymerization was found to proceed at comparable rates on the zirconium monohydrides, (BSiAO)3ZrH, and dihydrides, (BSiAO)2ZrH2.

Cleavage of linear alkanes on the monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable; however, the dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2 can act as catalysts of the process under mild conditions. Hydrides of the trivalent zirconium, (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH, can also contribute to the hydrogenolysis reaction. A feature of all the systems studied is low regioselectivity of the corresponding processes.

Among such processes are the olefin polymerization [17], hydrogenation of olefins [8], isotope exchange in alkanes [9], as well as hydroisomerization and hydrog- enolysis of alkanes [1014].

The unique ability of these systems to catalyze both processes depending on the presence of hydrogen in the system was rationalized. Three types of catalytic species have been studied, all of them, (BSiAO)3ZrIVH, (BSiAO)2ZrIVH2, and (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH, being observed experimentally [2, 4 8, 16].

The rates of ethylene polymerizations on the monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH and dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2 were found to be of the same order of magnitude. Since the amount of monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH present in the system is always much larger than that of dihydrides, the former should be considered as the major catalytic species for the polymerization reaction.

Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable. In contrast to this, the dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably proved earlier [4,8]), can act as the catalysts of hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al. [911].

Earlier [18], we have shown that the activation energy for isotope exchange in methane on zirconium hydrides reported in the experimental study by Hall et al. [9] is somewhat lower than the energy barrier to the reaction of dihydrides with the methane molecule obtained from our calculations (7 vs. 911 kcal mol)1, respectively).

Despite the fact that Basset et al. reliably proved that monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH were the major type of the surface metal hydrides in the samples of catalysts employed in their study [10], we believe that additional experimental investigations are required.

1. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides were studied for ethylene polymerization and hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes. The catalytic processes were found to occur through different surface hydrides. Ethylene polymerization occurred comparably on zirconium monohydrides and dihydrides. Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes was thermodynamically unfavorable on monohydrides but could occur on dihydrides under mild conditions. Trivalent zirconium hydrides also contributed to the hydrogenolysis reaction.

2. The systems were capable of catalyzing both formation and cleavage of C-H bonds based on hydrogen presence. Three types of catalytic species were observed, including monohydrides, dihydrides, and trivalent hydrides. Monohydrides were the major catalysts for ethylene polymerization.

3. Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes was thermodynamically unfavorable on monohydrides. Dihydrides, however, could act as catalysts for hydrogenolysis at similar temperatures to those reported in experimental studies by Basset et al.

4. The activation energy for isotope exchange in methane on zirconium hydrides was lower than that of dihydrides' reaction with methane, suggesting contributions from other reactive species.

5. Despite Basset et al.'s proof of monohydrides being the major surface metal hydrides, further experimental investigations are recommended for clarification.

2. 这些系统能够根据氢的存在催化C-H键的形成和断裂。观察到了三种类型的催化剂物种，包括单氢化物、双氢化物和三价氢化物。单氢化物是乙烯聚合的主要催化剂。

3. 线性烷烃的氢解在单氢化物上是热力学不利的。然而，双氢化物可以在与Basset等人的实验研究中报告的相同温度下作为氢解线性烷烃的催化剂。

4. 在锆化物上进行的甲烷同位素交换的激活能低于双氢化物与甲烷的反应，这表明可能存在其他更活跃的物种。

1. Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are typically prepared by coating the surface of partially dehydroxylated silica with organometallic compounds containing zirconium, followed by heating under hydrogen conditions. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides might be synthesized similarly, using thorium-based organometallic compounds on alumina surfaces.
   
   Structure: Zirconium hydrides often exist as monohydrides (ZrH) and dihydrides (ZrH2) on silica supports, whereas thorium hydrides could potentially form trivalent hydrides (ThH3) on alumina. 

   Catalytic properties: In C-H bond activation, silica-supported zirconium hydrides can facilitate processes like olefin polymerization and hydrogenolysis of alkanes. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides may enable similar reactions, with the potential for enhanced stability or selectivity due to the different support materials.

   Mechanisms: Reaction mechanisms involve σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. For both systems, these processes can lead to the formation of olefin polymers, the cleavage of alkanes, or the isotope exchange in methane.

   Rates: Rates of reactions can vary significantly based on factors such as the presence of hydrogen, substrate type, and the specific hydride species involved.

   Selectivity: Low regioselectivity is characteristic of reactions involving highly coordinated zirconium and thorium species. This aligns with experimental observations showing mixtures of products in hydrogenolysis of alkanes and polyethylene formation.

   Roles: In both systems, the role of σ-bond metathesis is crucial for alkane metathesis, while hydrogenolysis facilitates the cleavage of C-H bonds. Chain walking is a key aspect of olefin polymerization on both zirconium and thorium hydrides.

1. 准备：二氧化硅支持的锆化物通常通过在部分脱水的二氧化硅表面上涂覆含锆的有机金属化合物，然后在氢条件下加热来制备。铝酸盐支持的钍化物可能以类似方式合成，使用钍基有机金属化合物在铝酸盐表面上。

   结构：锆化物在二氧化硅支持上通常以单氢化物（ZrH）和二氢化物（ZrH2）形式存在，而钍化物在铝酸盐支持上可能形成三价氢化物（ThH3）。 

   催化性质：在C-H键激活中，二氧化硅支持的锆化物可以促进如乙烯聚合和烷烃氢解等过程。铝酸盐支持的钍化物也可能使类似反应成为可能，由于不同的支持材料，这些系统可能表现出增强的稳定性和选择性。

   机制：反应机制涉及σ键迁移、氢解离和链行走。对于两个系统，这些过程可能导致烯烃聚合物的形成、烷烃的断裂或甲烷的同位素交换。

   速率：反应速率会根据氢的存在、底物类型等因素显著变化。

   选择性：高度协调的锆和钍物种表现出的低区域选择性与实验观察到的烷烃氢解和聚乙烯形成的混合产物一致。

   角色：在两个系统中，σ键迁移对于烷烃的迁移至关重要，而氢解离则促进了C-H键的断裂。链行走是锆和钍氢化物上乙烯聚合的关键方面。
