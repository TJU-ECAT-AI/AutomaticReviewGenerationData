</quotes>

The document focuses on the transformation of lower alkanes into aromatic hydrocarbons over ZSM-5 zeolites, specifically discussing the conversion of ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and hexane. It also covers the conversion of alkenes into aromatics and the preparation of gallium- and zinc-loaded zeolites, as well as their acidic properties. However, there are no relevant quotes provided to compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis.
