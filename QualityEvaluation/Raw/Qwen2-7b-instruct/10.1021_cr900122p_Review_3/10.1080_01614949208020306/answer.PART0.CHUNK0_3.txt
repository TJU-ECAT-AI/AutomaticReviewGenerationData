<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The provided literature does not contain any information regarding silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides, nor does it discuss their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Therefore, it is not possible to compare and contrast these topics based on the given document.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
提供的文献中没有包含关于二氧化硅支持的锆化氢或氧化铝支持的钍化氢的信息，也没有讨论它们的制备、结构、催化性质，或在H/D交换和烷烃异构化过程中的机制。因此，无法根据给定的文档比较和对比这些主题。
