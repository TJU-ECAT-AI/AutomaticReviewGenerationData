1. The study focuses on the dehydrofluorination of hydrofluorocarbons using titanium alkylidynes, specifically examining the synthetic, structural, and mechanistic aspects of 1,2-CH bond addition and β-fluoride elimination.
2. The comparison shows that silica-supported zirconium hydride has superior activity and selectivity in C-H bond activation reactions over alumina-supported thorium hydride.
3. The mechanism of H/D exchange involves the cleavage of the C-H bond followed by the substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms.
4. In alkane metathesis, the process occurs through sequential steps including σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, facilitating the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds within alkanes.
