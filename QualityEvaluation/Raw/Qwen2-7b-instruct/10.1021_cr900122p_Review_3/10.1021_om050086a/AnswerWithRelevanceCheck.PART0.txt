          Silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrate faster reaction rates and higher selectivity in H/D exchange reactions compared to alumina-supported thorium hydrides. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides excel in alkane metathesis reactions. The mechanism of H/D exchange includes σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, while alkane metathesis is enhanced by the distinctive surface characteristics of alumina.

          二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物在H/D交换反应中的反应速率更快且选择性更高，与氧化铝负载的钍氢化物相比。氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在烷烃裂合反应中表现更优。H/D交换的机制涉及σ键裂解、氢解离和链行走，而烷烃裂合则得益于氧化铝的独特表面特性。
