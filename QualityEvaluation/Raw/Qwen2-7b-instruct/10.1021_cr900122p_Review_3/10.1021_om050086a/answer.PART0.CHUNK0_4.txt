1. The preparation of silica-supported zirconium hydrides involves the reaction of zirconocene chloride with silica, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides are prepared by treating thorium(IV) oxide with hydride sources. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit faster reaction rates and higher selectivity in H/D exchange reactions compared to alumina-supported thorium hydrides. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are more effective in alkane metathesis reactions. The mechanism of H/D exchange involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, whereas alkane metathesis is facilitated by the unique surface properties of alumina.

1. 硅基载锆化物的制备涉及锆二氯化物与硅的反应，而氧化铝基载钍化物则是通过处理四氧化钍与氢化物源的反应得到的。硅基载锆化物在氢氘交换反应中的反应速率更快且选择性更高，相比氧化铝基载钍化物。相反，氧化铝基载钍化物在烷烃裂解反应中更为有效。氢氘交换的机制涉及σ键裂解、氢解离和链行走，而烷烃裂解则由氧化铝的独特表面性质所促进。
