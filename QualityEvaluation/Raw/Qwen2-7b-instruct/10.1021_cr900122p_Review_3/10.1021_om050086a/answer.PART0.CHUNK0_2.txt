The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides were compared in the context of their use in C-H bond activation reactions. The study focused on H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, detailing the mechanisms involved. In H/D exchange, the process was explained through a series of reactions, including σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. For alkane metathesis, the study highlighted how these processes contribute to the transformation of alkanes under specific conditions.
