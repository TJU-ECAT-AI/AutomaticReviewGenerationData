The literature discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of well-defined surface tungstenocarbyne complexes formed through the reaction of [W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] with silica. These complexes are compared with silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis are explored, along with reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.
