[1] "Our strategy to prepare first row d0 metal alkylidynes from vanadium alkylidenes contrasts Schrock's two-electron reduction reactions of high-valent alkylidenes to prepare TaC linkages."
[2] "We have determined that both bulky alkyl groups and large coordinating anions are needed in order to promote steric crowding and subsequent α-hydrogen abstraction."
[3] "The dichloride precursor (nacnac)TiCl2(THF) reacts readily with 2 equiv of LiNHAr to afford the bis-anilido titanium(III) complex (nacnac)Ti(NHAr)2 in 92% yield (Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3, Scheme 7)."
[4] "Complex 12 is remarkably stable as a solid, but solutions of 12 slowly transform to the four-coordinate titanium imide (nacnac)TiNAr(OTf) and H2NAr, and the former can be isolated as red prisms in 67% yield (Scheme 7)."
[5] "Alkylation of such species followed by one electron oxidation, should in principle promote another α-hydrogen abstraction to furnish the VC linkage in a high-valent state."
[6] "The broad range of oxidation states for vanadium allows us to carry out two one-electron oxidation/one α-hydrogen abstraction processes in the sequence V(III) V(IV) + e- + H+ V(V) + e- + H+ (alternatively referred to as proton-coupled electron transfer, PCET)."
[7] "Complex 24 is a highly reactive complex inasmuch as it transforms in benzene at 27 C over 11.9 h (4.5 half-lives) to (PNP)TiCHtBu(C6H5) quantitatively."

The document discusses the preparation and reactivity of low-coordinate titanium and vanadium complexes containing terminal metalligand multiple bonds, specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, and imides. The synthesis of these complexes is achieved through one-electron oxidatively induced α-hydrogen abstraction reactions. Titanium alkylidenes, such as (nacnac)Ti(CH2tBu)2, can undergo α-hydrogen abstraction to form the TiC linkage, leading to further reactivity involving the nucleophilic MC bond. Vanadium alkylidenes similarly allow for the generation of TiC and VC linkages through α-hydrogen abstraction and subsequent one-electron oxidation. The document also describes the synthesis of titanium imides, vanadium alkylidynes, and titanium alkylidynes, highlighting the versatility of these complexes in various chemical transformations. Additionally, the document mentions the preparation of titanium complexes containing terminal phosphinidene functionalities, such as (nacnac)TiPMes*(CH2tBu), which can undergo α-hydrogen migration to form the TiP linkage. The document provides detailed procedures and characterization data for these complexes, demonstrating their potential in catalysis and reactivity.
