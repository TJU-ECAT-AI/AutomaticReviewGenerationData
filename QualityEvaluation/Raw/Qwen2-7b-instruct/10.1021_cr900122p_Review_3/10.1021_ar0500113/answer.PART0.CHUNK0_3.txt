[1] "The protocol to prepare low-coordinate and terminal titanium alkylidene complexes involved a modification of the synthesis of (nacnac)TiCl2 (nacnac- = [Ar]NC(Me)CHC(Me)N[Ar], Ar = 2,6-(CHMe2)2C6H3), reported previously by Budzelaar and co-workers. (27)"
[2] "We chose the sterically encumbering nacnac- ligands given their precedent to generate low-coordination environments."
[3] "Following Budzelaar's procedure, we recrystallized the THF base adduct (nacnac)TiCl2(THF) (1) from toluene in 70% yield as dark green blocks."
[4] "When complex 2 was treated with AgOTf or 1/2 equiv of I2, a rapid color change from green to red brown was observed concurrent with formation of the alkylidene complexes (nacnac)TiCHtBu(X) (X- = OTf, 89%; X- = I, 61%) as evaluated by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic methods (Scheme 2)."
[5] "The low-coordination number in 3-OTf and 3-I was also confirmed by single-crystal crystallographic studies."
[6] "To block these decomposition pathways from occurring, we prepared Ti(III) precursors supported by more robust ancillary ligands such as nacnactBu- ([Ar]NC(tBu)CHC(tBu)N[Ar], Ar = 2,6-(CHMe2)2C6H3) and PNP- (N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2)."
[7] "As a result, kinetically stable titanium alkylidene complexes such as (nacnactBu)TiCHtBu(X) (X- = OTf, 4-OTf; X- = I, 4-I), and (PNP)TiCHtBu(OTf) (5) can also be prepared via the one-electron oxidatively induced α-hydrogen abstraction protocol but using instead the precursors (nacnactBu)TiCl2 (6) and (PNP)TiCl2 (7) (Schemes 4 and 5, respectively)."
[8] "Unlike titanium, vanadium displays more diverse redox chemistry; hence oxidation states ranging from +2 to +5 are commonly allowed."
[9] "Using Budzelaar's precursor (nacnac)VCl227 and 2 equiv of LiCH2tBu, we prepared the bis-neopentyl complex (nacnac)V(CH2tBu)2 (8) in 80% yield as dark brown needles (Scheme 6)."
[10] "One-electron oxidation of 8 with AgBPh4 generated a Ag0 mirror concurrent with the vanadium(IV) alkylidene complex [(nacnac)VCHtBu(THF)][BPh4] (9) in 74% yield (Scheme 6)."
[11] "By anion exchange with MgI2, the neutral vanadium(IV) alkylidene (nacnac)VCHtBu(I) (10) can be readily prepared."
[12] "Unlike complex 2, which displays an irreversible oxidative wave at 0.90 V (referenced vs FeCp2/FeCp2+ in THF/TBAH, TBAH = [Bu4N][PF6]) for the Ti(III)/Ti(IV) couple, complex 11 revealed a reversible oxidation wave at 0.89 V for the Ti(III)/Ti(IV) couple, thus suggesting that one-electron oxidation is not the rate-determining step for this type of transformation."
[13] "We believe Ag+ not only acts as an oxidant but partakes in the salt metathesis of Cl- for OTf-."
[14] "Terminal alkylidyne ligands in groups 4 and 5 transition metals are far more limited when compared to the alkylidene functionality."
[15] "Given our ability to generate four-coordinate vanadium(IV) alkylidenes, it was thought that alkylation of such species followed by one electron oxidation, should in principle promote another α-hydrogen abstraction to furnish the VC linkage in a high-valent state."
[16] "Complex 18 exhibits a solution magnetic moment of 1.90 μB, and the EPR spectrum is in accordance with a V(IV) radical center."
[17] "Interestingly, our strategy to prepare first row d0 metal alkylidynes from vanadium alkylidenes contrasts Schrock's two-electron reduction reactions of high-valent alkylidenes to prepare TaC linkages."
[18] "The broad range of oxidation states for vanadium allows us to carry out two one-electron oxidation/one α-hydrogen abstraction processes in the sequence V(III)  V(IV) + e- + H+  V(V) + e- + H+ (alternatively referred to as proton-coupled electron transfer, PCET) (41) to generate the VC linkage."
[19] "Alkylation of 7 with LiCH2tBu in pentane allows for clean isolation of the titanium neopentylideneneopentyl complex (PNP)TiCHtBu(CH2tBu) (24) (Scheme 10)."
[20] "As observed with 24, benzene solutions of 26 gradually react with C6H6, albeit more slowly (40 C, 24 h), to afford the alkylidene phenyl derivative (PNP)TiCHSiMe3(C6H5) (27) (Scheme 10)."
[21] "Formation of 29 is proposed to occur via transmetallation of LiPHMes* with 3 to furnish a putative neopentylidenephosphide (nacnac)TiCHtBu(PHMes*) intermediate, which rapidly undergoes α-H-migration to form the TiP linkage."
[22] "The molecular structure of 29 displayed a four-coordinate titaniumphosphinidene complex possessing a short TiP bond (2.1831(4) Å)48 and a linear TiPCipso angle (164.44(5))."
[23] "Solid-state structural studies of these phosphinidene compounds depict short vanadiumphosphorus multiple bonds (30, 2.174(4) Å; 31, 2.1602(6) Å)."
[24] "Both structural features and high-level DFT studies suggest these radical species to be stabilized not only kinetically but via a pseudo-JahnTeller effect of second order."
[25] "Primary amides such as LiNHAr can also be transmetallated with 5 to furnish the imidealkyl functionalities in the complex (PNP)TiNAr(CH2tBu) (33) via an α-hydrogen migration step (Scheme 15)."

1. The literature discusses the preparation of low-coordinate titanium and vanadium complexes containing terminal metalligand multiple bonds through one-electron oxidatively induced α-hydrogen abstraction reactions. Titanium alkylidenes are prepared using precursors like (nacnac)TiCl2, while vanadium alkylidenes are synthesized from (nacnac)VCl2. These complexes can be further transformed into imides, phosphinidenes, and alkylidyne functionalities via α-hydrogen migration or other reactions.

2. Titanium and vanadium complexes with terminal metalligand multiple bonds exhibit various catalytic properties. Titanium complexes can undergo intermolecular C-H activation reactions and ring-opening metathesis of aromatic substrates. Vanadium complexes show reactivity in C-H activation, alkane metathesis, and other transformations due to the presence of terminal alkylidyne, phosphinidine, and imide functionalities.

3. The literature does not provide direct comparisons between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in terms of C-H bond activation reactions. However, it describes the preparation and properties of low-coordinate titanium and vanadium complexes, which might offer insights into the behavior of hydride-supported catalysts in similar reactions.
