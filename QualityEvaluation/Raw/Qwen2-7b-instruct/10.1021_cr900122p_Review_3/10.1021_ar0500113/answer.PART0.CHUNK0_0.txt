[1] "Oxidizing the appropriate titanium(III) or vanadium(III) systems by one-electron promotes an α-abstraction (H or trimethysilyl) to afford TiC, TiN, and VC linkages. In the case of vanadium, two-electron oxidation steps ultimately lead to VC bond formation."
[2] "When the titanium alkylidene 3 is treated with LiPHMes*, the terminal phosphinidene complex (nacnac)TiPMes*(CH2tBu) (29) can be obtained in 78% (Scheme 13)."
[3] "The polarized nature of the MC bond renders titanium and vanadium alkylidene functionalities exceedingly nucleophilic, thus readily engaging in α-hydrogen migration or deprotonation reactions of primary phosphides and amides."
[4] "Complex 29 is thermally unstable but undergoes rapid low-temperature reactions with CNtBu or cummulenes such as N2CPh2 to generate η2-(N,C)-phosphaazallene and phosphonylimide complexes, respectively."

The literature does not provide direct comparisons or details about the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, including their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. It focuses on the synthesis of low-coordinate titanium and vanadium complexes containing terminal metalligand multiply bonded functionalities through one-electron oxidatively induced α-hydrogen abstraction reactions. The literature discusses the preparation, structure, and some catalytic properties of titanium and vanadium complexes containing alkylidene, imide, phosphinidene functionalities, but lacks information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides.

文献没有提供关于二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键激活反应中的直接比较或详细信息，包括它们在H/D交换和烷烃裂解中的机制。它专注于通过单电子氧化诱导的α-氢抽象反应合成低配位钛和钒复合物。文献讨论了含有烷基二烯、咪唑和磷基二烯功能化的钛和钒复合物的制备、结构及其一些催化性质，但缺乏关于二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢的信息。
