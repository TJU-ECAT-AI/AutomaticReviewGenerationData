          A well-defined silica-supported tungsten imido alkylidene complex was utilized as a catalyst for olefin metathesis reactions, displaying high activity and stability. This catalyst had superior thermal stability compared to unsupported tungsten complexes. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides were less effective in C-H bond activation, showing lower selectivity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Zirconium hydrides supported on silica showed faster reaction rates than thorium hydrides.

          硅支持的钨酰基烷基二烯烃复合物被用作烯烃环化反应的催化剂，表现出高活性和稳定性。与未支持的钨复合物相比，该催化剂具有更优的热稳定性。相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的效率较低，显示出在H/D交换和烷烃环化中较低的选择性。二氧化锆氢化物在硅支持下的反应速率比钍氢化物快。
