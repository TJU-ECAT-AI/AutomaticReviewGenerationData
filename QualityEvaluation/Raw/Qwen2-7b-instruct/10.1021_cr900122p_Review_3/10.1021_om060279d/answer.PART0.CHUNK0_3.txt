<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides were examined in the context of C-H bond activation reactions. The catalysts utilized in these processes included mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, which were integral to H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The study also delved into the rates of reaction and the selectivity achieved through these catalytic activities.
