<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Silica-supported tungsten imido alkylidene complexes were utilized as catalysts for olefin metathesis reactions, showing high activity and stability. These catalysts also exhibited superior thermal stability compared to unsupported tungsten complexes. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides were less effective in C-H bond activation reactions, demonstrating lower selectivity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Zirconium hydrides on silica support showed faster reaction rates and improved selectivity, attributed to the precise control over reaction conditions. The mechanisms involved σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, which contributed to the enhanced performance of the catalysts.

硅支持的钨酰基烷基二烯烃催化剂被用于烯烃裂合反应，显示出了高活性和稳定性。与未支持的钨复合物相比，这些催化剂还表现出更好的热稳定性。相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的效率较低，显示出在H/D交换和烷烃裂合中较低的选择性。二氧化锆氢化物在硅支持下显示出更快的反应速率和改进的选择性，这归因于对反应条件的精确控制。机制涉及σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走，这些都促进了催化剂的性能提升。

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in terms of their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties for C-H bond activation reactions. However, it discusses a well-defined silica-supported tungsten imido alkylidene olefin metathesis catalyst. The catalyst involves silica support and tungsten, which might be relevant to understanding the properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The focus is on H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, discussing reaction rates and selectivity. The mechanisms involve σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. However, specific details about the structure and preparation of the silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are not provided.

文献并未直接比较二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。然而，它讨论了一种定义明确的二氧化硅支持的钨酰基烷基二烯烃烯烃环化催化剂。催化剂涉及二氧化硅支持和钨，这可能有助于理解二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢的性质。重点是H/D交换和烷烃环化，讨论了反应速率和选择性。机制包括σ键环化、氢解离和链行走。然而，关于二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢的具体结构和制备细节并未提供。

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides were examined in the context of C-H bond activation reactions. The catalysts utilized in these processes included mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, which were integral to H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The study also delved into the rates of reaction and the selectivity achieved through these catalytic activities.
