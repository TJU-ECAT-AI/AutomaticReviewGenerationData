Silica-supported tungsten imido alkylidene complexes were utilized as catalysts for olefin metathesis reactions, showing high activity and stability. These catalysts also exhibited superior thermal stability compared to unsupported tungsten complexes. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides were less effective in C-H bond activation reactions, demonstrating lower selectivity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Zirconium hydrides on silica support showed faster reaction rates and improved selectivity, attributed to the precise control over reaction conditions. The mechanisms involved σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, which contributed to the enhanced performance of the catalysts.

硅支持的钨酰基烷基二烯烃催化剂被用于烯烃裂合反应，显示出了高活性和稳定性。与未支持的钨复合物相比，这些催化剂还表现出更好的热稳定性。相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的效率较低，显示出在H/D交换和烷烃裂合中较低的选择性。二氧化锆氢化物在硅支持下显示出更快的反应速率和改进的选择性，这归因于对反应条件的精确控制。机制涉及σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走，这些都促进了催化剂的性能提升。
