[1] "This review paper presents the significant advances which were made in the last decade in the understanding of the transformation over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts of the cheap and readily available C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products: mechanism of activation, reaction scheme, nature of the active sites."
[2] "Both the transformations of pure alkanes: n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization and of alkanes in mixture with alkenes: isobutanebutene alkylation or with aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene alkylation with ethane or propane are considered."

This review paper discusses the advancements in understanding how inexpensive and easily accessible C2C4 alkanes are transformed into more valuable products using acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts. The focus includes the mechanisms of activation, reaction schemes, and the nature of the active sites involved. The paper considers various transformations such as n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, and alkanes reacting with alkenes or aromatic hydrocarbons through processes like isobutanebutene alkylation or benzene alkylation with ethane or propane.
