The document does not provide information to compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. It focuses on the transformation of C2C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts into more valuable products, including isomerization, aromatization, and alkylation reactions. The document discusses mechanisms such as activation, disproportionation, and isomerization, as well as the influence of acidity and pore structure on these processes. However, it does not delve into the specifics of silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides, nor does it cover H/D exchange or alkane metathesis in the context of these materials.

文档没有提供有关比较和对比二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质的信息，详细阐述它们在H/D交换和烷烃裂解中的机制。它关注了C2C4烷烃在酸性和双功能沸石催化剂上的转化，形成更宝贵的产物，包括异构化、芳构化和烷基化反应。文档讨论了如激活、分解和异构化等机制，以及酸性和孔结构对这些过程的影响。然而，它没有深入探讨二氧化硅支持的锆化氢或氧化铝支持的钍化氢的具体情况，也没有涵盖这些材料在H/D交换和烷烃裂解方面的具体应用。
