This review paper discusses the advancements in understanding the transformation of C2C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts into more valuable products. It covers various transformations including n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, isobutanebutene alkylation, and benzene alkylation with ethane or propane. Key mechanisms such as the carbenium-chain mechanism, protolytic mechanism, disproportionation, and isomerization are highlighted. The paper also delves into the light alkane aromatization process, the nature of active sites, dehydrogenation steps, and the bifunctional mechanism. It examines the hydroisomerization and dehydroisomerization of n-butane, alkylation reactions involving small alkanes with aromatics, and the thermodynamics of these reactions. It compares different catalysts and their performance in alkane transformations. The paper concludes with general insights into the field.
