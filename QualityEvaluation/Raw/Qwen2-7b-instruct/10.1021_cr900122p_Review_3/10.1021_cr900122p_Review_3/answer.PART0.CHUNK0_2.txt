[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"
[2] "These species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"
[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"
[4] "A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored (Ea > 65 kcal mol1), because it involves a four-center transition state with a carbon in the β-position (Scheme 15e). (227)"
[5] "The related silica supported tantalum hydrides are prepared in a similar way. They are mixtures of surface species (Scheme 16a), and current data are consistent with the presence of mono- and tris-hydride species. (234)"
[6] "This system displays a similar reactivity to zirconium hydrides, i.e. the low temperature activation of alkanes and H/D exchange reactions, through very likely the same mechanism, σ-bond metathesis (Scheme 15c and d, M = Ta). (235-238)"
[7] "In the case of methane, it leads to the formation of TaCH3, TaCH2, and TaCH species (Scheme 16c). (234)"
[8] "Alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"
[9] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c)."
[10] "Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides share similarities in preparation, structure, and catalytic properties, particularly in C-H bond activation reactions. Both are mixtures of mono- and bis-hydrides. The zirconium hydrides are more reactive towards CH4 than their mono-hydride counterparts, and they catalyze H/D exchange reactions through a stepwise mechanism involving σ-bond metathesis, which forms a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis. The reaction pathway is two-step, avoiding a direct one-step process due to high energy barriers. The thorium hydrides, prepared similarly, display similar reactivity to zirconium hydrides in alkane activation and H/D exchange reactions, facilitated by σ-bond metathesis. The rate of H/D exchange on thorium hydrides is fast, especially for terminal CH bonds, though the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, leading to isomerization of dimethylcyclohexanes via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism.

二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在制备、结构和催化性质上具有相似性，特别是在C-H键活化反应中。两者都是单核-双核混合物。锆化物对甲烷的反应活性高于其单核形式，并且它们通过涉及σ键异构化的逐步机制催化H/D交换反应。该反应途径是两步的，避免了一步直接过程，因为能量壁垒高。钍化物以类似的方式制备，显示出与锆化物相似的烷基活性和H/D交换反应，由σ键异构化促进。钍化物的H/D交换速率很快，尤其是对于末端C-H键，尽管掺入氘并不选择性，导致二甲基环己烷异构化通过β-H转移和链行走机制。
