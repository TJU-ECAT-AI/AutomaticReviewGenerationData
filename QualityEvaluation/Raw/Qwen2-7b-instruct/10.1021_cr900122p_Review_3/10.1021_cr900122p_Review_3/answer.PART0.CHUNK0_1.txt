[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"

[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"

[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"

[4] "A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored (Ea > 65 kcal mol1), because it involves a four-center transition state with a carbon in the β-position (Scheme 15e). (227)"

[5] "They are mixtures of surface species (Scheme 16a), and current data are consistent with the presence of mono- and tris-hydride species. (234)"

[6] "This system displays a similar reactivity to zirconium hydrides, i.e. the low temperature activation of alkanes and H/D exchange reactions, through very likely the same mechanism, σ-bond metathesis (Scheme 15c and d, M = Ta). (235-238)"

[7] "The formation of [ThH] involves treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyzing H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"

[8] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h−1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c)."

[9] "Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit distinct properties in C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. 

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides consist of mono- and bis-hydrides, with the bis-hydride being significantly more reactive than the mono-hydride. This system catalyzes H/D exchange reactions through a stepwise mechanism, even at low temperatures, involving σ-bond metathesis for CH bond activation, followed by hydrogenolysis. A direct one-step reaction pathway is energetically unfavorable due to the complexity of the transition state.

2. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are mixtures of surface species, including mono- and tris-hydride forms. These hydrides display similar reactivity to zirconium hydrides, including low-temperature alkane activation and H/D exchange reactions, which likely proceed through a σ-bond metathesis mechanism.

3. The alumina-supported thorium hydride catalysts enable fast H/D exchange reactions with alkane mixtures, achieving high rates of up to 800-1200 h−1. The reactions are slightly selective for terminal CH bonds, but the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, leading to cistrans isomerization of dimethylcyclohexanes through β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism.

二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活反应，特别是H/D交换和烷烃裂合中表现出不同的特性。

1. 二氧化硅支持的锆化物由单氢化物和双氢化物组成，其中双氢化物比单氢化物更具有反应活性。这个系统通过逐步机制催化H/D交换反应，即使在低温下也能实现，涉及σ键裂解以激活CH键，随后是氢解离，重新生成金属氢化物并在烷烃中整合氘。直接一步反应路径因过渡态复杂而能量上不利。

2. 氧化铝支持的钍化物是表面物种的混合物，包括单氢化物和三氢化物形式。这些化物与锆化物显示相似的反应性，包括低温烷基化和H/D交换反应，这很可能通过σ键裂解机制进行。

3. 氧化铝支持的钍化物催化剂能够快速实现H/D交换反应，与烷基混合物结合，达到每小时高达800-1200的高速率。反应对于终端CH键有轻微的选择性，但氘的整合不是选择性的，导致二甲基环己烷的cis-trans异构化，通过β-H转移和链行走机制。
