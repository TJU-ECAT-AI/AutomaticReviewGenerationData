(a) "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"

(b) "These species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"

(c) "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"

(d) "A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored (Ea > 65 kcal mol1), because it involves a four-center transition state with a carbon in the β-position (Scheme 15e). (227)"

(e) "The related silica supported tantalum hydrides are prepared in a similar way. They are mixtures of surface species (Scheme 16a), and current data are consistent with the presence of mono- and tris-hydride species. (234)"

(f) "This system displays a similar reactivity to zirconium hydrides, i.e. the low temperature activation of alkanes and H/D exchange reactions, through very likely the same mechanism, σ-bond metathesis (Scheme 15c and d, M = Ta). (235-238)"

(g) "In the specific case of cycloalkanes, the cycloalkyl surface species evolved toward more highly unsaturated species through dehydrogenation processes. For instance, activation of cyclopentane yields a well-defined silica supported cyclopentandienyl tantalum species, (238) which involves successive CH bond activation processes (Scheme 16b). (239, 240)"

(h) "For instance, activation of cyclopentane yields a well-defined silica supported cyclopentandienyl tantalum species, (238) which involves successive CH bond activation processes (Scheme 16b). (239, 240)"

(i) "In the case of methane, it leads to the formation of TaCH3, TaCH2, and TaCH species (Scheme 16c). (234)"

(j) "Computational studies suggest that the tris-hydride Ta species is probably the active species and activates alkanes via σ-bond metathesis. (241)"

(k) "Alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"

(l) "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c)."

(m) "Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides share similarities in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Both types of hydrides are mixtures of mono- and bis-hydrides. The zirconium hydrides exhibit a stepwise mechanism for H/D exchange, with the bis-hydride being more reactive than the monohydride. The mechanism involves CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, followed by hydrogenolysis, which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium into the alkane. In contrast, a direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored due to the energy barrier involved.

Thorium hydrides also display a similar mechanism for alkane activation, involving σ-bond metathesis. The reactions are fast at low temperatures, with a slight selectivity for terminal CH bonds. The incorporation of deuterium during the H/D exchange process is not selective, leading to cistrans isomerization of dimethylcyclohexanes, possibly through β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism. The reaction rates of the thorium hydrides are faster, with rates of 800 to 1200 h^-1.

在硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢中，它们在制备、结构和C-H键激活反应中的催化性质方面具有相似性，尤其是在H/D交换和烷烃裂合。这两种化氢都是单氢和双氢的混合物。锆化氢表现出一种步进机制来进行H/D交换，双氢比单氢更活跃。该机制涉及通过σ键互换激活CH键，随后进行氢解离，再生金属氢化物并将氘纳入烷烃中。相比之下，直接一步反应路径由于碳β位置涉及的四中心过渡态的能量壁垒而高度不利。

钍化氢也显示了一种类似的烷烃激活机制，涉及σ键互换。反应在低温下快速进行，对于终端CH键有轻微的选择性。在H/D交换过程中，氘的整合并不选择性，导致二甲基环己烷的cis-trans异构化，可能通过β-H转移和链行走机制。钍化氢的反应速率更快，每小时为800到1200次。
