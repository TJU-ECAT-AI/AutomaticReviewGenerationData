<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The silica-supported zirconium hydrides consist of a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides, with the bis-hydride showing significantly greater reactivity towards methane than the monohydride. These hydrides catalyze a stepwise H/D exchange reaction in mixtures of hydrogen-deuterium or methane-deuterium, which is notably fast even at sub-room temperatures. The mechanism involves a two-step process: CH bond activation through σ-bond metathesis to form a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis to regenerate the metal hydride and incorporate deuterium into the alkane. A direct one-step reaction is highly unfavorable due to the energy barrier involved. The alumina-supported thorium hydrides also exhibit similar reactivity patterns, including low temperature alkane activation and H/D exchange, likely through σ-bond metathesis. The alumina-supported thorium hydride species catalyze fast H/D exchange reactions with alkane mixtures, albeit with slight selectivity for terminal CH bonds. The incorporation of deuterium is generally non-selective, leading to isomerization of dimethylcyclohexanes during the exchange process, possibly via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism. Computational studies support the involvement of σ-bond metathesis in the exchange of methyl groups on zirconium hydrides and the phenyl ligand on silica-supported iridium complexes.

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit distinct properties in C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. 

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides consist of mono- and bis-hydrides, with the bis-hydride being significantly more reactive than the mono-hydride. This system catalyzes H/D exchange reactions through a stepwise mechanism, even at low temperatures, involving σ-bond metathesis for CH bond activation, followed by hydrogenolysis. A direct one-step reaction pathway is energetically unfavorable due to the complexity of the transition state.

2. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are mixtures of surface species, including mono- and tris-hydride forms. These hydrides display similar reactivity to zirconium hydrides, including low-temperature alkane activation and H/D exchange reactions, which likely proceed through a σ-bond metathesis mechanism.

3. The alumina-supported thorium hydride catalysts enable fast H/D exchange reactions with alkane mixtures, achieving high rates of up to 800-1200 h−1. The reactions are slightly selective for terminal CH bonds, but the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, leading to cistrans isomerization of dimethylcyclohexanes through β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism.

3. 氧化铝支持的钍化物催化剂能够快速实现H/D交换反应，与烷基混合物结合，达到每小时高达800-1200的高速率。反应对于终端CH键有轻微的选择性，但氘的整合不是选择性的，导致二甲基环己烷的cis-trans异构化，通过β-H转移和链行走机制。

[12] "Evidence for this process has been obtained in the metathesis of alkane (CH3CH2R) on various well-defined metal neopentyl neopentylidene species (M = Ta, (251, 252) Mo, (253, 254) W, (255) and Re (254)) through the formation of cross-metathesis products with the following selectivity tBuCH3 > tBuCH2CH3 > tBuCH2CH2R, while the coupling product, tBuCH2CH2CH2R, is not detected (Table 1, entries 19)."
[13] "Note that the formation of these products requires neopentyl neopentylidene surface species and an alkane of general structure RCH2CH3. This implies that both the neopentyl and the neopentylidene ligands are important and that β-H transfer is probably a key step."
[14] "These products probably result from a stepwise mechanism involving known elementary steps of molecular organometallic chemistry (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = tBu): (i) CH bond activation of RCH2CH3 on the metal alkylidene, thus forming an intermediate with three pendant alkyl ligands [M(CH2tBu)2(CH2CH2R)], (247-250) of which one has a β-H;"
[15] "Intramolecular CH bond activation processes Thermal decomposition of bis-alkyl surface species leads to formation of well-defined silica supported metal alkylidene complexes via α-H abstraction. This elementary step involves the intramolecular activation of the CH bond at one of the alkyl ligands in the α-position by an adjacent ligand (here another alkyl), which corresponds to an intramolecular version of a σ-bond metathesis process. (246, 266)"
[16] "This process is typically observed upon the grafting of molecular alkylidene complexes on silica surfaces, e.g. Ta and Re, (267-269) which first react with the surface silanols via [1,2]-addition, yielding bis-alkyl species before decomposing into the alkylidene (Scheme 20a)."
[17] "The α-H abstraction process has also been observed upon the thermal treatment of bis(alkyl) surface species [(SiO)2M(CH2R)2] (M = Ti, Zr, and Cr; Scheme 20d), which yields [(SiO)2M(CHR)]. (273-275)"
[18] "Finally, the mechanism of grafting [Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], a d2 complex, is also noteworthy and leads to [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] via isomerization of the metal fragment from a bis-alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne complex (Scheme 21a). (276)"
[19] "One of the key steps involves an intramolecular CH bond activation process, α-H transfer, to transform the bis-alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne fragment."
[20] "Experimental and theoretical studies point toward two possible grafting processes: (i) isomerization of [Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] into [Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] upon coordination of a surface silanol through α-H transfers followed by σ-bond metathesis or (ii) grafting via σ-bond metathesis followed by isomerization of the metal fragment. This is in sharp contrast with the grafting of the corresponding alkylidyne complexes [M(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] of d0 metals (M = Mo and W), which takes place via σ-bond metathesis without isomerization of the metal fragment (Scheme 21b).

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are both used for C-H bond activation reactions, with the former being more reactive towards methane than the latter. Both systems exhibit low temperature activation of alkanes and H/D exchange reactions, facilitated by a two-step mechanism involving σ-bond metathesis. The zirconium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange reactions in mixtures of H2/D2 or CH4/D2, showing high reactivity even at sub-room temperatures. In contrast, the thorium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange reactions of D2/alkane mixtures at faster rates, particularly for terminal CH bonds, but with less selectivity for the incorporation of deuterium into the alkane. The mechanism involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and potentially a chain walking mechanism.

2. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides both involve the preparation of metal alkylidene complexes through α-H abstraction from bis-alkyl species. The zirconium hydrides activate CH bonds via σ-bond metathesis, forming metalalkyl intermediates that undergo hydrogenolysis to regenerate the metal hydride and incorporate deuterium into the alkane. This process contrasts with the grafting of d0 metal alkylidyne complexes, where σ-bond metathesis occurs without isomerization of the metal fragment. In the case of the d2 complex [Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], isomerization of the metal fragment from a bis-alkylidene to an alkyl alkylidyne complex facilitates the formation of [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2].

2. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢都通过α-H抽象从双烷基物种制备金属烷基衍生物。锆化氢通过σ键裂合激活CH键，形成金属烷基中间体，随后进行氢解离以再生金属氢化物并使烷基化合物中的氘掺入烷烃。这一过程与d0金属烷基衍生物的嫁接形成不同，后者涉及σ键裂合而无需金属片段的异构化。对于d2复合物[Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2]的情况，金属片段从双烷基衍生物异构化为烷基烷基衍生物，有助于形成[(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]。
