[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"
[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"
[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"
[4] "A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored (Ea > 65 kcal mol1), because it involves a four-center transition state with a carbon in the β-position (Scheme 15e). (227)"
[5] "This system displays a similar reactivity to zirconium hydrides, i.e. the low temperature activation of alkanes and H/D exchange reactions, through very likely the same mechanism, σ-bond metathesis (Scheme 15c and d, M = Ta). (235-238)"
[6] "The formation of [ThH] is generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyzing H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"
[7] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c)."
[8] "Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."
[9] "While not directly evidenced experimentally, computational studies suggest that the methyl/methyl exchange of the d0 zirconium methyl species in the presence of methane can readily take place via σ-bond metathesis (Scheme 18a). (228)"
[10] "Similarly, the silica supported Ir-complex (SiO)Ir(Ph)(PMe3)Cp* reacts with benzene to exchange its phenyl ligand, like its molecular equivalents (Scheme 18b). (245)"
[11] "Surface metal alkylidene species are typically formed via decomposition of bis-alkyl intermediates via α-H abstraction, (246) and the reverse step corresponds to the CH bond activation of an alkane onto a MC bond. (247-250)"
[12] "Evidence for this process has been obtained in the metathesis of alkane (CH3CH2R) on various well-defined metal neopentyl neopentylidene species (M = Ta, (251, 252) Mo, (253, 254) W, (255) and Re (254)) through the formation of cross-metathesis products with the following selectivity tBuCH3 > tBuCH2CH3 > tBuCH2CH2R, while the coupling product, tBuCH2CH2CH2R, is not detected (Table 1, entries 19)."
[13] "Note that the formation of these products requires neopentyl neopentylidene surface species and an alkane of general structure RCH2CH3. This implies that both the neopentyl and the neopentylidene ligands are important and that β-H transfer is probably a key step."
[14] "These products probably result from a stepwise mechanism involving known elementary steps of molecular organometallic chemistry (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = tBu): (i) CH bond activation of RCH2CH3 on the metal alkylidene, thus forming an intermediate with three pendant alkyl ligands [M(CH2tBu)2(CH2CH2R)], (247-250) of which one has a β-H;"
[15] "Intramolecular CH bond activation processes Thermal decomposition of bis-alkyl surface species leads to formation of well-defined silica supported metal alkylidene complexes via α-H abstraction. This elementary step involves the intramolecular activation of the CH bond at one of the alkyl ligands in the α-position by an adjacent ligand (here another alkyl), which corresponds to an intramolecular version of a σ-bond metathesis process. (246, 266)"
[16] "This process is typically observed upon the grafting of molecular alkylidene complexes on silica surfaces, e.g. Ta and Re, (267-269) which first react with the surface silanols via [1,2]-addition, yielding bis-alkyl species before decomposing into the alkylidene (Scheme 20a)."
[17] "The α-H abstraction process has also been observed upon the thermal treatment of bis(alkyl) surface species [(SiO)2M(CH2R)2] (M = Ti, Zr, and Cr; Scheme 20d), which yields [(SiO)2M(CHR)]. (273-275)"
[18] "Finally, the mechanism of grafting [Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], a d2 complex, is also noteworthy and leads to [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] via isomerization of the metal fragment from a bis-alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne complex (Scheme 21a). (276)"
[19] "One of the key steps involves an intramolecular CH bond activation process, α-H transfer, to transform the bis-alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne fragment."
[20] "Experimental and theoretical studies point toward two possible grafting processes: (i) isomerization of [Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] into [Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] upon coordination of a surface silanol through α-H transfers followed by σ-bond metathesis or (ii) grafting via σ-bond metathesis followed by isomerization of the metal fragment. This is in sharp contrast with the grafting of the corresponding alkylidyne complexes [M(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] of d0 metals (M = Mo and W), which takes place via σ-bond metathesis without isomerization of the metal fragment (Scheme 21b). (67, 277, 278)"

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are both used for C-H bond activation reactions, with the former being more reactive towards methane than the latter. Both systems exhibit low temperature activation of alkanes and H/D exchange reactions, facilitated by a two-step mechanism involving σ-bond metathesis. The zirconium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange reactions in mixtures of H2/D2 or CH4/D2, showing high reactivity even at sub-room temperatures. In contrast, the thorium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange reactions of D2/alkane mixtures at faster rates, particularly for terminal CH bonds, but with less selectivity for the incorporation of deuterium into the alkane. The mechanism involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and potentially a chain walking mechanism.

2. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides both involve the preparation of metal alkylidene complexes through α-H abstraction from bis-alkyl species. The zirconium hydrides activate CH bonds via σ-bond metathesis, forming metalalkyl intermediates that undergo hydrogenolysis to regenerate the metal hydride and incorporate deuterium into the alkane. This process contrasts with the grafting of d0 metal alkylidyne complexes, where σ-bond metathesis occurs without isomerization of the metal fragment. In the case of the d2 complex [Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], isomerization of the metal fragment from a bis-alkylidene to an alkyl alkylidyne complex facilitates the formation of [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2].

1. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢都用于C-H键活化反应，前者对甲烷的反应活性高于后者。两者都能在低温下激活烷烃并进行H/D交换反应，借助于涉及σ键裂合的两步机制。锆化氢催化H/D交换反应在H2/D2或CH4/D2混合物中，即使在低于室温的温度下也能表现出很高的反应性。相比之下，钍化氢催化D2/烷烃混合物中的H/D交换反应速度更快，特别是对于末端CH键，但对烷烃中氘的掺入选择性较低。该过程涉及σ键裂合、氢解离，并可能涉及链行走机制。

2. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢都通过α-H抽象从双烷基物种制备金属烷基衍生物。锆化氢通过σ键裂合激活CH键，形成金属烷基中间体，随后进行氢解离以再生金属氢化物并使烷基化合物中的氘掺入烷烃。这一过程与d0金属烷基衍生物的嫁接形成不同，后者涉及σ键裂合而无需金属片段的异构化。对于d2复合物[Os(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2]的情况，金属片段从双烷基衍生物异构化为烷基烷基衍生物，有助于形成[(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]。
