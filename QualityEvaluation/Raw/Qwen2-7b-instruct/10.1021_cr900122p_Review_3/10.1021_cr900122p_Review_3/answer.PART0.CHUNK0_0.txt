[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"
[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"
[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"
[4] "A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored (Ea > 65 kcal mol1), because it involves a four-center transition state with a carbon in the β-position (Scheme 15e). (227)"
[5] "This system displays a similar reactivity to zirconium hydrides, i.e. the low temperature activation of alkanes and H/D exchange reactions, through very likely the same mechanism, σ-bond metathesis (Scheme 15c and d, M = Ta). (235-238)"
[6] "Alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"
[7] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c)."
[8] "Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."
[9] "While not directly evidenced experimentally, computational studies suggest that the methyl/methyl exchange of the d0 zirconium methyl species in the presence of methane can readily take place via σ-bond metathesis (Scheme 18a). (228)"
[10] "Similarly, the silica supported Ir-complex (SiO)Ir(Ph)(PMe3)Cp* reacts with benzene to exchange its phenyl ligand, like its molecular equivalents (Scheme 18b). (245)"

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides consist of a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides, with the bis-hydride showing significantly greater reactivity towards methane than the monohydride. These hydrides catalyze a stepwise H/D exchange reaction in mixtures of hydrogen-deuterium or methane-deuterium, which is notably fast even at sub-room temperatures. The mechanism involves a two-step process: CH bond activation through σ-bond metathesis to form a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis to regenerate the metal hydride and incorporate deuterium into the alkane. A direct one-step reaction is highly unfavorable due to the energy barrier involved. The alumina-supported thorium hydrides also exhibit similar reactivity patterns, including low temperature alkane activation and H/D exchange, likely through σ-bond metathesis. The alumina-supported thorium hydride species catalyze fast H/D exchange reactions with alkane mixtures, albeit with slight selectivity for terminal CH bonds. The incorporation of deuterium is generally non-selective, leading to isomerization of dimethylcyclohexanes during the exchange process, possibly via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism. Computational studies support the involvement of σ-bond metathesis in the exchange of methyl groups on zirconium hydrides and the phenyl ligand on silica-supported iridium complexes.

二氧化硅支持的锆化氢由单氢和双氢的混合物组成，双氢对甲烷的反应性远大于单氢。这些化氢通过逐步的氢/氘交换反应催化混合物中的氢/氘或甲烷/氘，即使在低于室温的温度下也非常快速。该机制涉及两个步骤：通过σ键重排激活CH键以形成金属烷基中间体，随后是氢解离以再生金属氢化物并将在烷烃中引入氘。直接一步反应由于涉及碳β位的四中心过渡态而高度不利。铝氧化的钍化氢也表现出类似的行为，包括低温烷基激活和氢/氘交换，很可能是通过σ键重排。铝氧化的钍化氢物种以非常快的速度催化氢/氘与烷烃混合物的交换反应，尽管对末端CH键有轻微的选择性。氘的插入通常是非选择性的，导致二甲基环己烷在交换过程中发生顺反异构化，可能通过β-H转移和链行走机制。计算研究支持σ键重排在锆化氢的甲基组交换和二氧化硅支持的铱复合物的苯基组交换中的作用。
