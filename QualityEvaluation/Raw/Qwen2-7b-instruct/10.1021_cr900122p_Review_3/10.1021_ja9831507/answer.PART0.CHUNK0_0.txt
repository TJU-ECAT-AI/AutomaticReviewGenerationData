[1] "Kinetics experiments with 1 were performed at various temperatures between 62 and 110 C, Figure 4. At each temperature, 1 equiv of CMe4 was the exclusive gaseous product of thermolysis."
[2] "The evolution of SiMe4 from 2 and 3 was monitored in the same way as for 1 and was, in both cases, first order."
[3] "The rate constants, Table 3, were used to construct a Eyring plot, which is also nonlinear, Figure 5b."
[4] "The ability of the alkylidene surface complexes 46 to undergo metathesis with styrene and catalyze its polymerization suggests that these single-site catalysts may perform using the Green-Rooney alkylidene mechanism."

The document discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported chromium hydrides and vanadium hydrides in comparison to alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. However, there are no direct comparisons made between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in the provided text. The document focuses on the detailed mechanisms of thermolysis and metathesis reactions involving the supported chromium and vanadium hydrides, rather than the properties of zirconium or thorium hydrides. Therefore, it is not possible to compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides based on the information provided.

文档讨论了二氧化硅支持的铬氢化物和钒氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质，与氧化铝支持的钍氢化物进行了比较。然而，在提供的文本中没有直接将二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物进行比较。文档主要关注受支持的铬和钒氢化物热解和共轭双键移位反应的详细机制，而不是锆或钍氢化物的性质。因此，根据提供的信息，无法基于所提供的内容比较和对比二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物的制备、结构和催化性质。
