1. Silica-supported chromium(IV) and vanadium(IV) complexes, (SiO)2M(CH2R)2, undergo thermal transformations to generate alkylidene complexes, (SiO)2MCHR, releasing alkane molecules. The reactions are quantitative and kinetically first order, indicating that all surface organometallic complexes have similar coordination environments. Isotope-labeling and kinetics experiments support intramolecular α-H elimination as the mechanism.

2. When heated, silica-supported chromium(IV) complexes produce neopentane as the only volatile product. Treatment with HCl liberates CMe4, consistent with α-H elimination to form alkylidene complexes.

3. Silica-supported vanadium(IV) complexes, similarly, undergo thermal transformations to release SiMe4, with the alkylidene complex, 6, having a magnetic moment of 1.63 μB/V, consistent with a mononuclear d1 V(IV) formulation.

4. Similar to chromium complexes, vanadium complexes undergo α-H elimination, forming alkylidene complexes. Isotope labeling supports this mechanism.

5. The rate of thermal decomposition of chromium complexes containing deuterated compounds is slower than those without deuterium, indicating a primary kinetic isotope effect.

6. Reaction of the deuterated chromium complex with HCl or DCl produces CMe4, with varying degrees of deuteration, demonstrating the α-H elimination process.

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions involves understanding their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The literature focuses on chromium and vanadium complexes rather than zirconium and thorium, but some principles can be extrapolated. 

Silica-supported chromium and vanadium complexes undergo thermal α-H elimination to form alkylidene complexes, indicating uniform coordination environments across the surface. The reactions are first-order, suggesting similar activation energies and pathways. The mechanism for chromium complexes involves an α-H elimination to form a supported alkylidene complex, while for vanadium complexes, concerted α-H elimination is more probable. The activation enthalpy for vanadium complexes is lower than that for chromium, which correlates with the higher stability of the vanadium complexes. The negative entropy change for vanadium complexes indicates that surface assistance plays a significant role in the rate-determining step. 

The ability of these alkylidene complexes to undergo metathesis with styrene and catalyze its polymerization suggests potential applications in single-site catalysts for polymerization reactions. The literature does not directly compare zirconium and thorium hydrides, but based on similarities in the reactions of chromium and vanadium complexes, it can be inferred that zirconium hydrides might exhibit comparable reactivity in C-H bond activation. The specific mechanisms for H/D exchange and alkane metathesis in zirconium and thorium hydrides would depend on the coordination environments and electronic properties of the metals, which are not detailed in the provided literature.

1. The silica-supported chromium complexes undergo clean thermal transformations to generate supported alkylidene complexes, releasing alkane molecules. The reactions are first order, indicating similar coordination environments on the surface. The temperature dependences of the first-order rate constants give nonlinear Eyring plots, suggesting a two-step mechanism involving reversible (alkyl)(alkylidene)CrVI hydride formation followed by reductive elimination of alkane.

2. The alumina-supported thorium hydrides, unlike the silica-supported chromium complexes, do not undergo clean thermal transformations to generate supported alkylidene complexes. Their behavior is not described in the provided literature, and thus, specific mechanisms for H/D exchange and alkane metathesis cannot be compared.

3. The kinetics of the thermolysis reactions for the silica-supported chromium complexes are first order, with the rate constants varying with temperature. The Eyring plots are nonlinear for the chromium complexes, while they are linear for the vanadium complexes. The activation enthalpy (ΔH) for the vanadium complexes is 11.0 ± 1.0 kcal/mol, and the entropy change (ΔS) is 43 ± 3 cal K-1 mol-1, indicating surface assistance in the rate-determining step.

4. The role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in C-H bond activation reactions is not specifically discussed in the provided literature. However, the successful transformation of the chromium complexes to alkylidene complexes through thermal α-H elimination suggests that these processes may be involved in the mechanism of C-H bond activation for the silica-supported chromium complexes.

5. The role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in C-H bond activation reactions is not specifically discussed in the provided literature for the alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The lack of detailed information regarding these mechanisms makes direct comparison with the silica-supported chromium complexes impossible.

6. The selectivity of the reactions for the silica-supported chromium complexes is high, as indicated by the quantitative liberation of alkane molecules. The reaction rates are temperature-dependent, with the highest rates occurring at higher temperatures.

7. The selectivity of the reactions for the alumina-supported thorium hydrides is not described in the provided literature. The lack of information regarding the selectivity of these reactions makes direct comparison with the silica-supported chromium complexes impossible.

8. The catalyst activity of the silica-supported chromium complexes is demonstrated by their ability to catalyze styrene polymerization, suggesting the potential for using these materials in industrial applications. The mechanism of this polymerization is currently under investigation.

9. The catalyst activity of the alumina-supported thorium hydrides is not described in the provided literature. The lack of information regarding the catalytic activity of these materials makes direct comparison with the silica-supported chromium complexes impossible.

10. The role of hydrogenolysis in the C-H bond activation reactions for the silica-supported chromium complexes is evident from the α-H elimination process, which liberates alkane molecules. The role of hydrogenolysis in the C-H bond activation reactions for the alumina-supported thorium hydrides is not described in the provided literature.

11. The role of σ-bond metathesis in the C-H bond activation reactions for the silica-supported chromium complexes is demonstrated by their ability to undergo metathesis with styrene and catalyze its polymerization. The role of σ-bond metathesis in the C-H bond activation reactions for the alumina-supported thorium hydrides is not described in the provided literature.

12. The role of chain walking in the C-H bond activation reactions for the silica-supported chromium complexes is not specifically discussed in the provided literature.

Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, the silica-supported chromium complexes undergo clean thermal transformations to alkylidene complexes through intramolecular α-H elimination. This process is characterized by a high activation enthalpy (ΔH) of 11.0 ± 1.0 kcal/mol and a large negative activation entropy (ΔS) of -43 ± 3 cal K-1 mol-1, indicative of surface assistance in the rate-determining step. Deuterium-labeling experiments confirm this α-H elimination to form a supported alkylidene complex. The silica surface facilitates the stabilization of coordinatively unsaturated species, allowing for regeneration and subsequent substrate binding.

In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides would require distinct mechanisms for C-H bond activation, as the properties and reactivities of alumina and silica differ significantly. The exact nature of these reactions, including reaction rates, selectivity, and roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, would depend on the specific conditions and structures of the alumina-supported thorium hydrides. Without specific details or experimental data for alumina-supported thorium hydrides, it is challenging to draw a detailed comparison. However, the differences in support materials (silica vs. alumina) and the different metallic centers (zirconium vs. thorium) would likely influence the catalytic properties and mechanisms involved in C-H bond activation.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键激活反应中的性质，二氧化硅支持的铬复合物通过内部分子α-H消除经历清洁的热转变生成支持的烷基二烯化合物。这一过程的特点是高活化焓（ΔH）为11.0±1.0 kcal/mol和较大的负活化熵（ΔS）为-43±3 cal K-1 mol-1，这表明表面辅助是决定性步骤。脱氘标记实验确认了这种α-H消除以形成支持的烷基二烯化合物。二氧化硅表面促进了协调不饱和物种的稳定，并允许再生和随后的底物结合。

相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物需要不同的机制进行C-H键激活，因为二氧化硅和支持材料（氧化铝）的性质和活性差异显著。具体反应速率、选择性和σ键裂合、氢解和链行走的作用取决于氧化铝支持的钍氢化物的具体条件和结构。没有特定细节或实验数据，很难详细比较这些反应。然而，支持材料的不同（二氧化硅与氧化铝）以及不同的金属中心（锆与钍）可能会对催化性质和涉及的C-H键激活机制产生影响。
